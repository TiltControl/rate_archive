#**All Stars ASSEMBLE!**

What's up, twinks? My name is Hammer, and I'm here to guide you through what will probably be the messiest rate in the history of this sub. Get ready.

**The All Stars Rate** is a fairly simple concept: We've asked every past rate host to select 2 songs they thought were robbed from their respective rates. This left us with 58 starting songs, and *then* we asked all of you to submit up to 10 songs you thought were robbed from that process. I tallied up the 7 highest vote getters, and voila! 65 songs, 65 fan favorites, 65 individual messes.

Now! Let's get into the rules. Most of you already know how to proceed, but for the newbies here...

- **Listen to every song.** Duh. I won't accept any incomplete ballots.

- **Score each song from 1 to 10**. You are allowed **ONLY ONE 11** and **ONLY ONE 0.** Decimal places are allowed but only to the first digit: scores like 7.5 and 8.3 are allowed, but not 5.97 or 4.696. It gives the program a headache and turns it straight. **You can change your scores at any time, just PM me.**

- Remember, **you don't have to use your 11 or 0!**

- This one is important, so listen up. There will be a lot of emotion in this, since it's everyone's faves against another. But for the love of god, **please don't sabatoge.** Be honest and fair.

If you don't use the right format, I'll still accept, but you're liable to a stern scolding and no TV for a week.

- **Comments are allowed and encouraged!** To leave a comment, just put a space after your score and write away.

HERE is an example of a proper comment:

> Colors: 10 Wow a true pop queen!

Here is NOT how to format your comments:

> Colors: 10: Wow a true pop queen!

> Colors: 10 - Wow a true pop queen!

> Colors: Wow a true pop queen! (10)

> Colors: I'm giving this a 10 because Halsey is a true pop queen!

If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me.

There's no set date because I will obviously allow extensions, but please try to get them in before the end of the month.

**REMEMBER**, Formation won't be on either playlist because Beyonce is a greedy fatty. That being said, [the full song is on YouTube, so use this link,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZJPJV__bQ) assuming you haven't bought the album or the song.
