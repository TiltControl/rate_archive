blue_heart_: The standard deviation, i.e. the average difference between the average score and the scores. So songs that get very different scores will have a high controversy.

=====

thenshecamelikeaaah: So r/popheads runs "rates", usually 2 each month. Most of the rates are a selection of similar albums, or albums from similar artists, or albums within a genre released in the same year. Sometimes there's a collection of songs instead, for example all the Grammy Songs of the Year. 

This has been happening for over a year now. These songs are some of the most well-liked songs that did not win in their rates, and the people who ran those rates submitted two songs each to make an all-stars rate. People give a score from 1 to 10 (with an optional 0 and an optional 11) and then the person running the rate collects all the scores and reveals them over 3 days during a weekend the next month. 

Edit: and they're all fucking garbage

Yikes, you guys were very mean to this song...it's pretty good though. Not really groundbreaking, but it's fun and catchy. Also, I wasn't the only one who heard that Dua-esque voice.

---
**berober04** (10): Yes it's just Dutcha Lipa, but since when is more Dua a bad thing???

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok my fucking wig is fucking gone holy shit this is a great song

**joshually** (10): Titelsong Meesterspion... is my drag name

**kappyko** (10): Was there a thing where all European pop tried to be Dua Lipa? There's kind of a weird resemblance of the pointillist synth melodies and white-girl-R&B vocals to the stylistics of "Be the One", but that may be consequent of the general sound that Dua mined from. Anyways, this song is more entrancing than it has any right to be, with genuinely probably the best post-chorus in the rate? It's fantastic pop music that deserves to get further than it probably will. I love when songs incorporate the chorus near the end with a different backing, and the claps on this are cute. This is perfect in what it's trying to be.

**SkyBlade79** (10): This was such an underdog for Eurovision, and I love it. It got my second highest score. It’s like “Be The One” but better. Her voice is so strong and varied, the production is such an earworm, and it’s just so sweet. That post-chorus is what really gives the song it’s power.

**twat\_brained** (10): I've heard this only once before but even then I know it's still nothing short of perfect.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.5): I usually hate the "Spotify sound" but this bops

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): a BOP

**eklxtreme** (9): this is a really cool song cus the production sounds pretty fresh and the vocals are quirky in a good way.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): a bop

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): ok surprise bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Never heard this song before but it’s super delightful. The production and vocals are super interesting and unique.

**swankyhoodrat** (8.5): This song is a tad overproduced but her voice is beautiful.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Really love the upbeat production, which felt pretty unique on a pop song. Maan's vocals do everything to sell the song as well.

**rickikardashian** (8.3): _Oh baby c’mon let me get to know ya

**awryj** (8): Dutcha Lipa

**rocketgamer31** (8): Never heard this in my life but I really like it! The chorus is great

**skargardin** (8): Solid, tight pop song but not really a fan of the wailing in the chorus

**strawberryswing1** (8): wow a bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): IDK where this bop came from but I love it so

**jhxcb** (7.9): Beautiful voice here, but it seems to be missing some kind of emotion.

**stansymash** (7.7): pop music has lots of good places it comes from

**MissyBee37** (7.5): This rate has been educational for songs I've never heard and artists I don't know at all. This is good!

**wailordfan** (7.5): this is super cute and the production is so cool. I’ve never heard it before but damn I will hear it a lot more now!

**zamomattel** (7.5): this was really nice, I enjoyed it

**DraculaWeekend** (7): This is fun

**grxmes** (7): Interesting, that's all I have to say.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): a bop!

**TheTimidMartian** (7): good use of falsetto. effective vocal layering during choruses. the overall sound is somewhat annoying however, especially the production.

**topesmachine** (7): this sounds like the mediocre love-child of Dua Lipa and Jessie Ware

**cadastre** (6): Beat reminds me a lot of Be The One, except BTO is a lot better and this makes me wish I was listening to that.

**quaerex** (6): After listening to like 25 songs about love, this one falls flat. Forgettable.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): it is somehow exactly what I was expecting.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): meh

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): this is a more boring version of Be The One with a way less interesting performer.

**WilsonJason** (5): and also shes pretty hot

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): isn't i

**carliescion** (4): What is this song

**shineflyer** (4): pretty unoriginal

**JustinJSrisuk** (3.9): No thanks, in good.

**Raykel** (3.5): Did I just listen to a commercial?

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.5): this sounds like someone doing a bad Dua Lipa impression and Dua bores me 95% of the time

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x1) triptoyourheart (3 x3) Leftoflinus, Shipsinker22, TheTimidMartian 

---
One of our foreign outfits in this rate, Cocovan is a French artist with a specialization in some catchy synthpop. This song definitely encapsulates her sound well, although it supposedly hasn't translated well to us English speakers, hence the low placement.

---
**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): S Y N T H W A V E // the drums and that bassline are seriously creamy

**berober04** (10): I love my French Carly Rae Jepsen

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): This is like Carly Rae Jepsen but better

**VodkaInsipido** (9): What Is This And Why Is It So Fantastic

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Reminds me a lot of Emotion in terms of both vocals and production. That's never a bad comparison on its own, and this song would be good even if you had never heard Carly. Also, the production at the beginning sounds like video game boss battle music.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): lowkey generic 80s vibe BUT it's so infectious that i cant not love it

**twat\_brained** (8.1): I liked this better when it was called "Gimmie Love". I give Cocoran credit at least for trying to recreate the E•MO•TION sound.

**boogiepanda** (8): First time listening to this but definitely a go

**calltehshots** (8): oooh where did this bop come from? body rolls into the 80s

**eklxtreme** (8): the 80s inspired vibe and production are done really well. Carly should've gotten on this.

**grxmes** (8): Stray observation: first time listening to her and she sounds like the love child of Grimes and CRJ

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Yes ‘80s bop!

**rocketgamer31** (8): Never heard this one before, but I almost hear CRJ in the vocals. Catchy track

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I've never heard this track before but I'm bopping now. Whatever rate it was in, it was robbed.

**zamomattel** (8): this sounds like a positive dancing on my own

**Albert\_Cole** (7.7): Wow. "Ooh, look at me, I have options, but I turn people down because I can afford to"

**rickikardashian** (7.6): i never thot i would find a watered down Carly Rae Jepsen wow ^^^jk ^^^i ^^^actually ^^^liked ^^^the ^^^song

**awryj** (7.5): its a bop but it sounds like a rejected demo for emotion (in a sorta bad way)

**banananaise** (7.5): i tried to look up Cocovan to find out more about her but both google and wikipedia insisted i was saying Coq au vin instead

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): I’m unfamiliar with this artist, but I dig this - it sounds kind of like a CRJ b-side.

**kappyko** (7.5): Nile Rodgers is shaking in his stacks of production royalties

**stansymash** (7.3): Nice! I Love 'Gimmie Love' (2015) By Carly Rae Jepsen! Good Music! Love It!

**chipsi1** (7): this is like carly rae jepsen but misspelled as carly jae repsen

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7): cute !

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Is this CRJ?

**jhxcb** (7): I was going to rate it higher, but I feel like something is wrong with the chorus.

**JMez2612** (7): Okay, this kinda bops

**joshually** (7): it's a fun bop but I feel like Covocan is like... just slightly off key or something

**Kaylaboe** (7): e•mo•tion, but it’s french and a c-side

**skargardin** (7): It never really took of for me but still quite cute

**SkyBlade79** (7): a harmless bop

**PenOrAPencil** (6.5): Sounds sort of like Gimmie Love by Carly Rae

**quaerex** (6.5): I don’t like that she’s singing from the back of her throat (is that just her voice?)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): is this Charlie Ray Jensen?

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): this is weird but nice

**letsallpoo** (6): I remember everyone thinking this would win but in the end I'm glad Italy prevailed - this is Carly-lite.

**OxfordSemicolon** (6): This is the kind of song people mean when they say all pop music sounds alike.

**wailordfan** (6): This too seems to fall flat for me. I just don't really get it.

**shineflyer** (5.5): It's a lot like an EMOTION track, but with a much less charismatic singer. This singer has more of an 80's vibe to her.

**dirdbub** (5): https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=152707903

**Elitefourbrad** (5): basic song flop

**fourchip** (5): fighting back yawns

**MissyBee37** (5): Meh. I've never heard this before, but my first reaction is that it sounds like discount E-MO-TION, but nowhere near as good as bonafide Carly (and I'm not even one of her resident diehards).

**swankyhoodrat** (5): The 80s vibe is nice but it doesn’t really go anywhere.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): not bad but its missing some oomph

**carliescion** (4): Discount CRJ

**nooodisaster** (4): Unmemorable except for the fact that the instrumental sounds like "Gimme Love" by God.

**TheTimidMartian** (3): cliched lyrics and bad vocals are saved by the production.

This European bop kind of shares some surf rock influence coupled with Europop? It's interesting, but it just works out. This is a catchy, fun tune that you all decided to just call alright. So it goes.

---
**berober04** (10): I want to dance like her.

**blue\_heart\_** (10): I have no clue what she's singing about but I'm living. Very close candidate for my 11.

**eklxtreme** (10): holy shit that’s a great melody. the instrumentation is crazy good, especially the cool horn solos. this is probably the first time in a rate where a song that’s new to me is getting a 10.

**Kaylaboe** (10): is this what you can call impact? during the fantasy eurovision part deux i got assigned Armenia, and originally i was devastated since what i’ve seen and heard from the Armenian music industry isn’t much to brag about. after an hour of searching armenian videos and songs i was intrigued by this really colourful thumbnail - i clicked it and instantly found a major bop.

**jhxcb** (9.7): I have no idea what they are saying, but this song ROCKS!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): a banger! also lowkey Feel It Still sounds a lot like this lmao

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This just sounds great

**triptoyourheart** (9): Holy shit this is good!

**axestogrind** (8.5): I normally can’t get into foreign songs because I like understanding and singing the lyrics but WHEW this bop transcended all of our human conceptions of language and linguistics.

**cyborglilith** (8.5): unintelligible bop

**kappyko** (8.5): fun af and perky pop rock with some great horns. my top choice in the original fantasy eurovision

**followingfreeways** (8): don't know a single word they're saying but this is such a bop

**skargardin** (8): Well-produced, fun bop.

**SkyBlade79** (8): it’s a bop but it’s getting out within the first ten lmao

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I have no idea what this is, but I like it.

**topesmachine** (8): ok this song is a BOP

**stansymash** (7.9): oh well this is fun and a different language

**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): Better lyrics than Katy - and it sounds like they managed to get Kenny G as well

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.8): This feels vaguely prejudiced, but I was hoping the non-English pop world would sound a bit different from the pop world I knew. Ooo-ooh, I'm a rebel just for kicks now.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): I have no idea what this musician is saying. All I know is that the vocalist knows how to sing, but she's singing a bit too hard for my liking. Also, the clapping and saxophone combo reminds me a bit too much of "Ain't My Fault". I mean, I like it, but let's be real, this isn't gonna last long.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): I don’t know what she’s saying but it sounds fun.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): hey terry you want some? this bitch empty. YETE

**omgcow** (7): I'm so goddamn dumb i typed in this title and expected it to be french

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This came out of nowhere but I'm bopping infinitely.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6.5): she speaks better english than ariana

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): I don’t speak Armenian, so I’m not sure what to give this. The artist sounds good, though.

**rocketgamer31** (6.5): No idea what this is but it's actually not bad

**fourchip** (6): i don’t want to guess the language cos i know i’ll get it wrong

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): i can’t understand shit

**sasuke-lp** (6): in which language is this?

**quaerex** (5.5): I really hate these quiet vocals in the beginning. The verses sound like Selena Gomez, weirdly enough. I have no idea what the singer is saying, but I think the chorus comes in well.

**shineflyer** (5.5): we love Armenian Shakira!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): I'd rather be listening to New Rules rn.

**carliescion** (5): What is this song?

**swankyhoodrat** (5): This songs like “Feel It Still” sung in another language by a woman

**joshually** (4): The title of this song is how I sound when I got an itchy throat and a congested lung

**nooodisaster** (4): Within 30 seconds I had opened Candy Crush

**zamomattel** (4): this is a nice song, but we are in the big leagues

**TheTimidMartian** (3): her vocals are especially poor; she belts and it sounds good but her placement is bad and her technique is everywhere.

**Elitefourbrad** (2): lol what is this

**Raykel** (2): Sounds really generic.

Holy shit, this took me by huge surprise. This song literally never left the bottom 10 throughout the entire thing. Which shocked me, I'm not a Bey fan and I did not like this album, but I love this song; it's fierce, empowering with a lot of personality. One of her best to me.

---
**chipsi1** (10): this is kinda better than the remix hehe

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Throwback to that time I met Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This goes off. Also, the remix with Nicki makes me feel way cooler than I actually am.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I said it in the last rate and I'll say it again, ***Flawless is a feminist anthem. It bangs, with three sections: a braggadocio first act where Bey struts her stuff, an interlude that features an Adichie passage from We Should All Be Feminists, and a final message of empowerment for women everywhere. All three parts bang. The song is flawless.

**twat\_brained** (10): When I went into this I expected something quite different but what I got was absolutely sensational; this is easily the 2nd best song on BEYONCE behind "Drunk in Love".

**VodkaInsipido** (10): One Of Beyoncé's Best

**zamomattel** (10): I prefer the remix but I also love chimanda’s speech so I’ll appreciate any bey I can get

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): the OG woke (up like this) song

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9.5): Where were you when Beyonce invented feminism?

**quaerex** (9.5): Beyoncé shows more personality in this song than she ever has in any interview she’s ever done. It works. Her voice carries her. Chimamanda’s part is a genius inclusion; the hook is iconic.

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): Such a fun and ferocious song. The Chimamanda sample has the perfect amount of production behind it. I could have lived without the intro sample but this song lives up to its name otherwise.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): BOW DOWN TO QUEEN BEY BITCHES

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): THE NICKI VERSION IS BETTER

**skargardin** (9): I like the Nicki remix better but it's still a fierce track nonetheless

**TheTimidMartian** (9): the feature is excellently placed and is thoughtfully chosen. the song itself is unremarkable vocally (and is mostly spoken) excepting the operatic head voice clip. production is very good, as is typical of beyonce.

**topesmachine** (9): but only because i like the remix better

**banananaise** (8.5): when i was bored on exchange in France i bought the self-titled Beyonce album the day it came out, completely based on the social media hype (and because my parents had connected the itunes account to their card but they never checked how much i bought), and this track made me

**PenOrAPencil** (8.5): GO OFF CHIMAMANDA

**piccprincess** (8.5): I WOKE UP LIEK DIS

**blue\_heart\_** (8): Didn't age very well.

**calltehshots** (8): chimamanda spitting bars

**dirdbub** (8): https://redd.it/27atqj

**enecks** (8): This is the moment Beyonce's feminism became convincing and powerful - sampling a speech about the meaning of feminism is a lot more powerful and meaningful than just saying that girls run the world. However this isn't all the way there - Beyonce got better at expressing these ideas in Lemonade, and Chimamanda is problematic to say the least (her views on trans women are kinda bad NGL)

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Nici version obviously superior, but this being in an entire section being devoted to comments about the nicki version being better probably shows I'm not breaking new ground

**joshually** (8): The highly instagrammable quote "I woke up like this" turns me extra basic every time!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): literally what did Beyonce do in this track other than to proclaim she woke up like this?

**nooodisaster** (8): This song seriously had my wig when I first listened to it. My thoughts back in 2013 "Literally she named a song *Flawless because two ""s weren't enough and hAS A FOURTH OF THE SONG BE A SPOKEN WORD FEMINIST SPEECH." Also, I live for how Chimamanda drools out "loooove and marriage" with such distain lmao.

**rickikardashian** (8): I have a _FLAWLESS_ sweatshirt and it’s my most loved piece of clothing. Should have chosen the remix tho, that’s like a 12/10

**rocketgamer31** (8): BOW DOWN BITCHES

**boogiepanda** (7.7): hnnng bass

**stansymash** (7.6): the spoken word bit in the middle is super cool, put that in more pop songs

**sletrab07** (7.2): My thing with Flawless is that I always imagine it to be bigger and better than it actually is until I sit down and listen.

**Albert\_Cole** (7): The message is very good but the beat is... not

**axestogrind** (7): Never caught the hype of this song. The iconic Chimamanda interlude gives it a really interesting texture but otherwise the song falls flat on its repetitiveness IMO.

**cadastre** (7): Is Beyonce tokenizing feminism or one of its biggest champions? Discuss.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This is great song with a great message (and also wonderful memes). I just don’t think it has a ton of replay-ability and the lyrics are a little lazy.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): like lbr the version with nicki isso much better

**kappyko** (6.5): this song kinda made me root for skeleton crew

**MissyBee37** (6.5): Bow down to the attitude and message of this song. I love the aggressive level of confidence & empowerment. Buuut I don't love it as a song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): I like Beyoncé and I love BEYONCÉ, but this is probably the weakest song there. I guess it gets like half an extra point for quotability though.

**wailordfan** (6.5): this ends so much better than it starts, after Chimamanda's speech it gets so much better, but the countless 'Bowdown Bitches' makes it just a bit too, bland? I guess. It's solid.

**deadspiderwall** (6): I wish I could get into this song more :(

**followingfreeways** (6): better than formation, but it was also used in a Spotify ad for like 3 years so it just kinda reminds me of that

**PuggleMaster** (6): the original and the remix out skinnied

**SkyBlade79** (6): the sample is kind of long but still a bop

**triptoyourheart** (6): This is... mediocre. The remix >>>>>

**Raykel** (5): I'm not here for Chimamanda's transphobia.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): In general, I think this song is OK. But I also feel like the spoken word part in the middle drags on a little long.

**LuckyKidA** (4.8): GIRL POWER if only the song was better.

**eklxtreme** (4.5): ngl, as great as the speech is, it feels very shoehorned into the song. if you’re gonna incorporate speech like that, don’t abruptly stop the song for like a whole minute.

**jhxcb** (4.1): It seems to have a good message, but that doesn't mean the song was that good.

**carliescion** (4): Flawless ft Nicki is so much better

**ComeOnAndSlang** (4): supposed to be all stars ?

**AFlyingWhale\_** (3): feminist message aside, this is a bad brooke candy reject

**fourchip** (3): why did beyonce and chimichanga do this to my ears

**shineflyer** (2.5): the first minute and a half are so irritating. then, it becomes okay.

**cyborglilith** (1): WHY

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (0): this is still bad, omfg i hate this song so fucking much and i don't care if y'all love it, this is the hill i'd die on, it's so shallow and i'm just gonna paste my comment again: I just find it so shallow to be all like “I woke up like this and I’m so beautiful” when the truth is that you never just “woke up like this”, it’s just not realistic and not real either, you don't wake up flawless and that's good, fuck this fake deep bullshit, i'm not here for this. Words can’t explain how much I hate this song. Also fuck this trend in music of making a song where the samples are the only good thing. Thanks to Rashad Muhammad, Rey Reel, Hit-boy and The-Dream.

**NapsAndNetflix** (0): i do NOT get this song, sorry gays!

Like the rest of Charli's music, this song is a glitchy midtemp electropop tun, with pitched sample vocals and Charli's typical sassy demeanor. As one of her earlier albums, True Romance hasn't quite reached the levels of acclaim that her later projects had, but it was a nice pop album that set Charli apart from the rest and You (Ha Ha Ha) is the centerpiece.

---
**PendulumThief** (11): I loved the instrumental version of this, and was SHOOK when Charli improved on it.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): by every metric i should dislike this song, the writing doesn't go anywhere and the whiny thing in the mix is very prominent. but it's a solid solid track idk why

**chipsi1** (10): Ed Sheeran (Ha Ha Ha)

**Leixander** (10): YOUUUUU YOUUU LIEEEEDDD! HA HA HA HA I WAS RIIIGHHTTTT

**nooodisaster** (10): Pettiness at its absolute finest. She legit sounds GLEEFUL this guy turned out to be a fuckboi, JUST because it proved her point. Imo, Charli's greatest of all time.

**rickikardashian** (10): She sounds oddly happy for some that got lied on

**shineflyer** (10): Such a mood. The drums/percussion make up a lot of why this song works, in conjunction with the chipmunked vocals, and the piano on the chorus. And, of course, Charli's vocal presence moves the song to center stage.

**suspicious\_padding** (10): Truly amazing.It’s one of the best Charli XCX songs.Usage of Gold Panda’s You fits perfectly.More popheads should check this kinda Charli XCX.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): The first Charli song I ever heard (I Love It doesn’t count) and it’s still so good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Perhaps my favorite Charli XCX song, this absolute bop is trademark Charli, sassy and snappy. The chorus is absolutely infectious and the instrumental is lush and Charli is perfect for it. The sample is used brilliantly and this song was a serious 11 contender for me, but I unfortunately know it will be robbed even worse here.

**topesmachine** (10): it's charli baby

**fourchip** (9.5): i didn’t know charli got an alvin and the chipmunks feature

**enecks** (9): I thought I hadn't heard this but I have oh my god chipmunked vocals that are actually good what the fuck

**Marshynarsh** (9): I initially gave this a 7 when I started ranking at the start of the year and it's now my most played song of the year so far

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This is cute.

**rocketgamer31** (9): I love Charleak Xbox

**skargardin** (9): I love the production on this one and the melodies are insanely catchy

**banananaise** (8.5): another song that's great for shouting the lyrics

**dirdbub** (8.5): hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaimdyingsendhelphahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Now I really like Charli's vocals here along with the beat, but the pitched vocal gets pretty annoying after a while.

**grxmes** (8.1): The opening (and really just the whole production) reminds of the music Casey Neistat uses in his vlogs.

**stansymash** (8.1): having only been aware of charli through like, vroom vroom and pop 2, this makes me feel funny

**boogiepanda** (8): Wasn't my favourite off True Romance from the get go but every listen it grows on me, including this time. 8.3

**zamomattel** (8): like the song girl, but like title bothers me for some reason

**calltehshots** (7.5): you x 10000000000000000000000000

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): Only knock against this song is that the YOU Y-Y-YOU YOU Y-Y-YOU gets annoying after a while, it basically never leaves the song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): she looks fucking phenomenal in this video

**jhxcb** (7.1): It just seems so meh.

**awryj** (7): I really like the structure of the chorus, but the sample is just too annoying :(

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I like the sample more than the song itself

**omgcow** (7): Hm I used to hear this at the mall a lot but I never knew Charli sang it! Interesting.jpg

**saucymac** (7): this is an ear worm

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Pop 2>>>>>>>>>>

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): It’s interesting but I just don’t like the squeaky noise in the song it just annoying. Also the song ends so abruptly it’s a bit jarring. I love the talking part in the bridge though.

**PenOrAPencil** (6): pretty boring but the bridge is pretty

**VodkaInsipido** (6): Ha Ha Ha This Song Is Not Very Good Tbh

**axestogrind** (5.5): I'm just... not into True Romance-era Charli, it sounds outdated and messy (but not in a purposeful Pop2 kind of way). Glad she went down the PC route because everything before N1A kinda give me a headache.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): Parts of this song I like, but the production is honestly grating in a way that other Charli tracks with strange production aren't. The vocal sample is just too loud honestly, it drowns out Charli and it's just so hard to ignore.

**eklxtreme** (5): that is one of the best uses of a vocal sample ever but the song falls pretty flat otherwise. charli can do much better.

**quaerex** (5): The music overpowers her voice, it’s pretty distracting. I can barely hear her.

**TheTimidMartian** (5): horrible choruses.

**wailordfan** (5): the song just feels so directionless, there isn't a strong hook to catch onto, but damn in the playlist the transition from this into Vroom Vroom makes me want to change the score higher even though it isn't intentional.

**WilsonJason** (5): beep beep

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): i'm not gonna say nothing cause i'm a classy lady

**carliescion** (4): The production is annoying

**JustinJSrisuk** (4): I’m sure glad that Charli XCX hooked up with PC Music because I don’t see her building a career on music this bland.

**mustangs16** (4): uhh this song is kind of painful to listen to listen to at times? what is that instrumental?

**JMez2612** (3): WTF is this overproduced mess, Charli sweetie ily but you're better than this.

**Elitefourbrad** (2): This song is awful and didn’t deserve to be in this rate. Charli’s worst song ever.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): yeah, I'm sorry, I just really don't get Charli

**joshually** (2): The song annoys me

**kappyko** (2): tbh the best part of this is the instrumental which is literally sampled from Gold Panda. charli sounds too quiet on this, the chorus is more of an annoying taunting earworm than something that comes naturally. it's one of the shortest songs in the rate and i already want it to be over. sorry dear, you've come a long way since true romance

**MissyBee37** (2): Oh. My. God. The "you"s kill this song for me. So, so annoying. The best part is when the "you"s drop out and she sounds kinda like Gwen Stefani in the middle.

**NapsAndNetflix** (1): 2 out there 4 me

**Albert\_Cole** (0): I didn't think I would find a song bad enough to give a zero to, but here it is

Probably the brightest song on Badlands, this sunny tune maintains the catchiness and edge that Halsey is known for. The hook is so smooth and just glides over the synths, and Halsey's voice sounds lovely. Sadly, others didn't really feel the same this time around.

---
**carliescion** (11): A fucking iconic masterpiece that needs to get more respect. No line will ever give me emotions on the same level that "cause i imagine the weight of your ribs if you lied between my hips in the backseat and i imagine the tears in your eyes the very first night I'll sleep without you" gave me. The chorus drop is so fucking good.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): go away discount lorde this deserved to win the tumblr rate

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): why did you hate this?

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I’m literally shaking as I listen to this. I want a Roman Holiday with Halsey. Everything is just perfect here, with the best production on the album by far and amazing lyrics. Also I love the lyrics about looking for the sunlight through the darkness and the taste of each other’s lips, just little things like that completely make a song for me and that’s what Halsey did here.

**fourchip** (10): roman BOPiday

**JMez2612** (10): I'm gonna gush for a second. This is my favorite Halsey song of ALL time because (it has the least cringy lyrics) she encapsulates young love so perfectly, and I find it beautiful and it BOPS.

**Leixander** (10): Best Halsey song imo.

**rickikardashian** (10): This is the kind of songs that helps you understand why some people like Halsey. She doesn’t feel too faux deep in this, or trying to rough the edges of the song to make it seem more artsy, it’s just a beautiful written song about running away from everyone and everything to be happy even just for a moment. There’s still the feeling of not fitting in and having problems with society, but instead of coming off as arrogant and moody, it feels carefree, like she’s really just searching for freedom and a place to be herself. **ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RANT ABOUT BLUE NEIGHBOURHOOD NOT BEING IN THIS RATE, THAT ALBUM IS A MASTERPIECE AND Y’ALL ARE HOES FOR NOT VOTING IT IN

**SkyBlade79** (10): one of halsey’s best in every aspect

**swankyhoodrat** (10): Probably the most underrated song on Badlands. It doesn’t really crescendo in a way that most radio hits do (or are supposed to) but it’s just so pleasant.

**twat\_brained** (10): I gave this a 10 when I first rated this. I'm giving it a 10 now. I'd give it a 10 again if I could. This is easily one of my top 10 Halsey songs. Because it's Halsey, though, I can see this going out on day 1.

**letsallpoo** (9): Who gave Halsey the RIGHT to make an album track this good

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Go Awf queen!

**quaerex** (9): Probably one of my favorite Halsey songs. The verses are filled with great imagery and the chorus simply crescendos and explodes in a way that makes it impossible not to sing along.

**shineflyer** (9): I underrated this last time. It's really positive for a song on this album, and just embodies a feeling of hope.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): The Second Good Song In Badlands

**grxmes** (8.9): THE BEST HALSEY SONG

**Albert\_Cole** (8.5): How is it different to a normal holiday? Am I just stupid for not knowing?

**awryj** (8.5): Pretty much the only song from Badlands I still go back to

**nooodisaster** (8): Yeah, it's a damn good song

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): I adore the lyrics in this. Also it’s stupidly catchy.

**therokinrolla** (8): eh

**wailordfan** (8): https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/stylus/1646379-nicki-minaj-2-grammys-2012-show-302.jpg

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7.5): kinda a discount colors

**eklxtreme** (7.5): the production feels a bit overbearing but it’s has a nice vibe and nice lyrics. it feels like a track from 1989.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): All these midtempo 80s throwback bops are starting to blur together.

**kappyko** (7.5): this is p gorgeous actually lol i'm shook

**jhxcb** (7.4): Decent, but kind of boring, to be honest.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): I don't get the love for this song. It's ok but like it doesn't stand out. Sorry hammer.

**banananaise** (6.5): i honestly missed where 'Colors' ended and 'Roman Holiday' began

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): I guess this one's at least tolerable...

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): Better than Colors in both production and vocals, but I don't think it's really standout in any way. Kind of a by the numbers moody indie-pop track.

**enecks** (6): Inflation is a serious problem

**topesmachine** (6): it's fine whatever

**triptoyourheart** (6): Take your medication Roman you’ll be okay.

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.7): this is actually decent until the chorus and then it falls flatter than her vocals

**rocketgamer31** (5): Has always been one of the tracks I tend to skip on Badlands

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Better than Colors but god is Halsey's lyricism just profoundly annoying. It's probably one of the less annoying songs on Badlands, though, so I've arrived at this score.

**DraculaWeekend** (4): I hate this rate for making me listen to Halsey

**nbapip** (4): I've never listened to Halsey but listening to both her songs in a row I can't tell the difference and they're both getting a 4

**stansymash** (4): halsey's voice makes me feel unsafe and not in a good way

**dirdbub** (2.5): Roman Holiday is a 1953 American romantic comedy film directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance; the screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ianws Service", finds her without recognizing who she is. He offers her money so she can take a taxi home, but she is too woozy. Thinking she is intoxicated, Joe finally lets her spend the night in his apartment. The next morning, Joe hurries off late to work and gives his editor, Mr. Hennessy (Hartley Power), false details of his press conference with the princess. It is only when Hennessy informs him that the event had been cancelled and shows him a news item about her “sudden illness” that he realizes who it actually is in his apartment. Seeing an opportunity, Joe proposes getting an exclusive interview with the princess and Hennessy agrees, offering $5,000 if the interview is all Joe claims it will be, but betting Joe $500 that he will not succeed.

**joshually** (2): Why is there so many Halsey songs in this rate? Is she really an "all star"?

**zamomattel** (2): this is super boring, wish it was nicki’s roman holiday instead

**TheTimidMartian** (0): production is bad, vocals are bad, lyrics are bad. there's literally nothing good about this track.

This song I feel like had potential to be something truly great and was kind of faltered by Selena's whispering. The best part of the song is the pre-chorus where she's actually singing, annd for the most part, the writing is just bad. However, the beat is silky smooth and it's catchy as all hell, so I think as a pop song, it does its job.

---
**skiddos** (11): she might have half an octave, but she also has my whole heart ♥︎

**calltehshots** (10): this seriously should've been a number 1 smash for 12 weeks like selena snapped, max martin snapped, im snapping along, you're snapping, snapping turtles.

**joshually** (10): Queen of Vocals Selena goes above & beyond all of our expectations to blow us out of the water with this banger.

**MissyBee37** (10): Ahhh this is one of my absolute favorite Selena tracks. I absolutely love her playfulness here, in lyrics and in the way she sings it. Does it get better than that wink of a line: "I mean I could but why would I want to?" No, no it does not.

**mustangs16** (10): "i mean i could but why would i want to" makes this song

**PenOrAPencil** (10): Invented whispering. I don’t stan Selena but I stan this song, along with 2 other songs from her entire discography (namely LYLALS and Fetish)

**rickikardashian** (10): I’m not writing a long ass comment for this. I’ll save it for when this inevitably goes out in day 1. :)

**fourchip** (9.2): selena repeating one of the worst lines i’ve ever heard in a long time with “you’re metaphorical gin and juice” is the equivalent of a small child yelling “mom! mom look at this! mom!” before proceeding to do something mediocre. despite this and selena’s incredibly lacking vocals (surprise!), however, HTM is still a total pussy popper

**cadastre** (9): This bridge is 100% pop perfection along with the opening lines of Into You and the chorus of Style.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): another song which had me shook listening to it the first time. Before I got to the first chorus, I had no idea why this song had so many streams. And then it dropped, flushed

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I mean I could give this a 10, but why would I want to?

**nooodisaster** (9): "I mean I could but why would I want to?" is the most transformative two seconds of any pop song ever.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I wasn't a part of this rate but I want locations of anybody who gave this lower than a 7.

**topesmachine** (9): this song is a bop but also Selena's only good song

**VodkaInsipido** (9): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/291002690673180672/399953354475700224/346531048261156864.png

**awryj** (8.8): I feel like people underrate the production of this song

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8.75): i love the mature subject throughout the song and the classy way it’s presented (looking at you Miss Steinfeld with your in-your-face ode to masturbation). Great music video with a surprising twist, oh god that breathy thing she does makes me weak in the knees. And don’t get me started on the way she sings that “ooh” at the beginning of the pre-chorus, would have given it a higher rating but that “you’re metaphorical gin and juice” is too cringy. But that wig has me S H O O K

**cyborglilith** (8.5): Pre-chorus is pretty bad

**Raykel** (8.5): I hate Pantene for overplaying the beat in their ads. This used to be a 10!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Love the minimalist production and the hook. The love/drug metaphor is a bit played out though.

**axestogrind** (8): I'll never forgive Julia Michaels for the atrocity that is 'metaphorical gin and juice'

**chipsi1** (8): i mean i could give this a 8.5 but why would i want to

**ignitethephoenix** (8): “I mean I could but why would I want to?” Is the best part of the song honestly. The rest of it’s okay but for the first time when listening to this song, I actually got slightly annoyed by Selena whispering talking.

**quaerex** (8): For all of Selena’s vocal limitations, she sure knows how to make a song. Also, the quirkiness of her lyrics has kind of become her thing, and it works well in this song.

**skargardin** (8): Creds to Selena for fully utilizing her “whisper voice” to perfection on this but it’s still a little disappointing to me.

**swankyhoodrat** (8): The whisper queen at her peak

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): we get it Haley you masturbate. [2]

**jhxcb** (7.1): It's a bop, but I'm conflicted. The vocals are weak in some places and stellar in others.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I mean I could but why would I want to?

**DrunkHurricane** (7): Hot take: "I mean I could but why would I want to" is a terrible line

**shineflyer** (7): To people telling me to give this a better score - I mean I could, but why would I want to?

**SkyBlade79** (7): probably her best whisper singing song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): the line “I mean I could but why would I want too” makes the song tbh

**Albert\_Cole** (6.7): Metaphorical gin & juice?!?! Also she shouldn't be ignoring medical advice

**stansymash** (6.5): no wait selena what about the track's momentum, don't do that

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): it's ok i guess, but certainly better than bad liar which is held up as something amazing and revolutionary for some inexplicable reason

**kappyko** (6): the instrumental is kind of entrancing faux-twigs-if-she-was-white type music. this song is p decently pretty actually. not the best and will get out day 1 unfortunately. also that line is stupid stop calling it pop perfection

**MaydayPVZ** (5): Why is this even in the rate

**TheTimidMartian** (4.5): poor vocals save for the belted parts, which aren't as bad as you would expect for selena. weak production.

**suspicious\_padding** (4.2): I mean I could but why would I want to?

**eklxtreme** (4): the song never really hits a dynamic peak and feels kinda all over the place partially because of that

**nbapip** (3.5): "i mean i could but why would i want to" earned 2.5 of these points

**zamomattel** (3.5): I could give this a higher score but why would I want to? Tbf that is a cute line but the rest of the song is kind of dull

**Leixander** (3): Nothing besides that "I Mean I Could But Why Would I Want To" line

**JustinJSrisuk** (2.5): I’d say that Selena could do better than this, but I’m not even sure if she even cares to, seeing how little effort was put into this and subsequent songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): I really don't understand why this song is know as Selena's best. The chorus is a mess, her vocals are average and it just feels like this song has nothing special about it besides 1 admittedly catchy line. But outside of that? This song has no character and I have no idea why we actually voted this as Selena's best song she's ever done.

**rocketgamer31** (2): I hate this song

**deadspiderwall** (1): vomit

**Elitefourbrad** (1): Wow this is a disgustingly awful song from our whisper queen trying to act sexy. Instead is just sounds like a baby crying for their mama.

**JunkyGS** (1): Can she learn to keep her whispers to herself?

**LandonKidatrea** (1): I can't listen to this song for more than 30 seconds (I mean I could but why would I want to?)

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (1): This song infuriates me, from her ASMR voice (that sometimes works but this is NOT one of those times) to the stupid Julia Michaels lyrics, it’s all garbage.

**WilsonJason** (1): absolute shit

**enecks** (0): And here is a 0. I considered not doing a 0 for this rate. I saw this song and I realised that would have to be changed. My motivation at first was selfish - SELENA was involved in Thirteen reasons why, SELENA's fandom sent me death threats and pictures of trans suicide victims. But I thought - I'll ignore that possibility. When I listened to that song I realised - no that was a dumb idea. Selena's vocals are so badly suited to conventional pop - thank fuck she figured out how to do anything good with them in It Ain't Me and Bad Liar.

**gannade** (0): This song has aged very poorly, cant stand it these days

**triptoyourheart** (0): Why does this sound like Selena is whispering he verses while having Sia singing the chorus?

**twat\_brained** (0): Not only does she CLARIFY that the subject of her desire metaphorically compares to gin and juice, she does it TWICE! And she doesn't even use her chest voice that much, unlike "Same Old Love". Honestly, this is just a retread of "Love You Like a Love Song" just in a different key.

Absolutely gorgeous song. Frank is a master of songwriting and this is no exception. The stripped back guitar, the heartfelt vocal delivery, it's everything I love about Frank, and you all did it so dirty. I'm disappointed.

---
**LuckyKidA** (11): Not even the best song on the album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): I gave this a 9.5 in the original rate and it's just like, WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING? I mean I know why I didn't give it an 11 (White Ferrari), but this is such an easy 10 that I wonder what I was trying to do. Anyway this is by far my favorite song in this rate, and knowing that it probably won't win kinda sucks even though this is a meaningless internet game. I just love Frank so much and this song has so many memorable moments and it brings back memories even though I lead a boring life lol. I'm just so happy this song and this album exist. Thanks daddy Frank ily.

**chipsi1** (10): it's ironic that this is called self control because i lose my self control every time this comes on

**dirdbub** (10): I watched him put the peach in his mouth and slowly begin to eat it, staring at me so intensely that I thought even lovemaking didn’t go so far. [...] I could tell he was tasting it at that very instant. Something that was mine was in his mouth, more his than mine now. I don’t know what happened to me at that moment as I kept staring at him, but suddenly, I had a fierce urge to cry. And rather than fight it, as with orgasm, I simply let myself go, if only to show him something equally private about me as well. I reached for him and muffled my sobs against his shoulder. I was crying because no stranger had ever been so kind or gone so far for me [...].I was crying because I’d never known so much gratitude and there was no other way to show it.

**grxmes** (10): First time hearing this and this is just so good

**kappyko** (10): i feel really uncomfortable giving a score to this kind of song in this kind of rate tbh. this is gonna be first out bc of it being sad and the opening lyrics and being acoustic pop unless something gets dragged to the mud horribly. like those chipmunk vocals? the lack of drums? the "wet dreams" line? this is so gonna turn people off. why didn't u just choose Pink + White so Frank didn't have to get hurt so badly again :(((( /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus

**Kaylaboe** (10): such a gorgeous track. pink+white was robbed though

**skargardin** (10): This song hits all the right spots and emotions for me. I cry very easily and this one always manages to make me cry it’s just so beautiful.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I've already screeched too much during the 2016 Hip Hop Rate (which had tragic results), but this intimate and stripped down Frank track may damn well be one of the best tracks he's ever done. It's got some precious moments, little handmade points of production that all lead to he absolutely stunning and tearjerking outro, a Beach Boys-esque fading goodbye.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): A gorgeous, beautiful, incredible song. I could probably throw a bunch more adjectives to describe just how good this song is, but I've made my point. The first part of the song, with its melodic guitar and great backing vocals from the underrated and talented Austin Feinstein, is fantastic, but then the strings kick in and its taken to another level. The final section of the song combines gorgeous, building instrumentation with what sounds like a chorus of Franks serenading you. This is one of the few songs that get me kind of weepy.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): I'll Stop Writing Like This To Say JESUS CHRIST MY FUCKING FEELINGS OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD FRANK WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME I HAVEN'T BROKEN UP WITH SOMEBODY YET YOU STILL WANT TO MAKE ME JUMP OUT OF A FUCKING WINDOW STOP WRITING BEAUTIFUL AND SAD SONGSSSSSSSS Thank You

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.5): Only dock against is the pitched-up vocals, which feel like an ill-advised attempt to "modernize" a simple acoustic track

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): YOU USED TO LIVE A BLONDED LIFE

**swankyhoodrat** (9): This song is a little slow for my liking, but it’s really a beautiful piece of music. The outro is just lovely.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): quite a beautiful song with great vocal performances from frank and Yung lean

**stansymash** (8.3): that second half is T to the I to the N to the G to the L to the E to the S and what does that spell: TINGLES

**enecks** (8): Of all the songs for Blonde you pick this? I mean it's emotionally impactful but you can do better.

**nooodisaster** (8): when did i start crying

**shineflyer** (8): It has flaws, but it's a really pretty song.

**topesmachine** (8): frank ocean marry me already

**twat\_brained** (8): Hmm. I've never really been able to get into Frank Ocean, I guess I'm just not much of a mellow R&B kind of guy. This song is unfortunately not doing much to rectify that. I do admire the layered vocals in the final minute or so of the song, though.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.8): Gorgeous production, but not my favorite song by Frank.

**quaerex** (7.5): Frank is known for his lyrics, and this song is no exception. I don’t like the baby voice, though.

**jhxcb** (7.1): Parts of this song are 9, parts are 5.

**rocketgamer31** (7): Pretty chill

**fourchip** (6.6): sparks of brilliance but nothing great

**Albert\_Cole** (6.4): He doesn't sound like he's lost self-control in the good way. He just sounds like he's too tired to think straight

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): black mac demarco

**awryj** (6): I don't get Frank Ocean :(

**rickikardashian** (6): ,

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5.6): when’s this song supposed to get good

**ignitethephoenix** (5): Its very soothing sounding and I like the layered voice effects with Franks voice, but it’s just forgettable to me.

**Leixander** (5): why frank, you have a perfect voice, what is this chipmunk thing? (Don't spank me hammer) Got kinda better in the latter half though

**strawberryswing1** (5): this song is annoying

**wailordfan** (5): This has such a great concept. Powerful vocals and a ballad should mean huge emotional ballad, but this felt like a rollercoaster that went in a circle, never going up or down, leaving you even more disappointed then if you were to never ride it at all.

**carliescion** (4): This is like Drake but more whiny

**Elitefourbrad** (4): I seriously do not get the hype around Frank, when he’s just another whiny R&B singer.

**JMez2612** (4): Ivy deserved a spot over this boring ass song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): Meh.

**WilsonJason** (4): khalid level bad vocals :(

**zamomattel** (3.5): laura branigan’s wig is unbothered

**TheTimidMartian** (3): lyrics are thoughtful (but on occasion questionable) but that is literally the only good thing about the song.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): isn't it

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): oh ma'am we are NOT tolerating these vocals!

**joshually** (2): There's literally nothing going on in this song, thank god it's not my Friday night

This is TOO FAR, YO. This song is quintessential Disney, the layered pop rock production, the metaphorical lyrics, the catchy ass chorus, this song is everything. Sure, Hilary has the vocals of a pebble but STILL. COME ON. YOU WERE ALL KIDS BEFORE.

---
**gannade** (11): I STILL CANNOT believe that Hilary not only LOST the disney singles rate but went out at #18. The biggest injustice in the history of popheads rates. Anyone who didnt give this a good score probably missed out on Lizzie Mcguire in their childhood, and instead watched Ari on Victorious, which is punishment enough for their stupidity.

**agentofscranton** (10): there has never been a greater injustice on this sub than the children disrespecting hilary duff

**calltehshots** (10): let's go back...back to the beginning...back to when popheads fucked this song over that rate. let's NOT do that again and give hit television star hilary duff her JUSTICE.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): #i'mwithher

**deadspiderwall** (10): THAT bitch

**eklxtreme** (10): I experience true happiness when this song comes on. meth got nothing on this song. it brings back a rush of childhood memories and it makes me sad when the song is over and when I realize my childhood is over.

**followingfreeways** (10): if you didn't give this song at least a 10 I honestly feel bad for you

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Nothing but respect for MY President!

**mustangs16** (10): this song was such a huge part of my teenage years, lmao

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): if you think hilary duff has ever put out a song that is less than a 10, give your head a shake because you are SADLY mistaken.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Invented Rain.

**omgcow** (10): All of the 14 year olds on this sub will probably do this song dirty AGAIN but Hilary invented Disney Channel pop and she deserves respect! None of the other girls could ever.

**Raykel** (10): She paved the way for every Disney star, heck even the Nickelodeon ones. Put some respect on her name and this bop!

**skargardin** (10): easily Hillary’s best song

**skiddos** (10): if you’ve never stared outside the window during a rainy day and lipped “let’s go back, back to the beginning” you’re too young

**strawberryswing1** (10): You baby popheads need to put some respeck on Hilary's name!!! She has so many classics, this being one of them.

**twat\_brained** (10): The biggest problem in the Disney/Nick rate we had was that there were too many people born after 1998 rating this song, as /u/omgcow pointed out. What you guys should have all realized now is that without Hilary Duff, there'd be no Miley Cyrus, there'd be no Selena Gomez, nor Demi Lovato, Zendaya, ~~Bella Thorne~~ or even Sabrina Carpenter. This is absolute pop perfection and is one of the greatest 21st Century hits sung by a teenager. I wanna see some respek on Hilary's name for once.

**JMez2612** (9.5): I did NOT like this song among the other generic pop rock in its OG rate, but now I realize this song is a torrential masterpiece

**jhxcb** (9.2): This song deserves better. This should've been the song for my generation.

**saucymac** (9): what an ageless bop

**LuckyKidA** (8.8): A solid member of the early 2000s melancholy-ish solo pop singer songwriter sound club. HEY NOW HEY NOW. We all knew Lizzie had some bops in her. I'm saying this too: Even Stevens and Lizzie McGuire > all other Disney Channel shows.

**axestogrind** (8.5): OHHHH MY GOD I thought I didn't know this song but as soon as the first note hit... let's go back... back to the beginning........ back to when the earth... the sun the stars all alligned........

**rickikardashian** (8.5): Will this be do wrong again in this rate? Probably

**Albert\_Cole** (8.2): I had my playlist on shuffle and this came on right after Kelly Clarkson, so Hilary's voice sounds really weak by comparison

**joshually** (8): I tell all my hookups, especially when I just changed to fresh sheets: "Please... come clean"

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Probably deserves to be half point lower, but It's my fav from an era I just don't like that much pop music from.

**swankyhoodrat** (8): Nostalgia overload omg

**chipsi1** (7): this is kinda rough but it bops

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7): wow a bop !

**DraculaWeekend** (7): main pop girl

**ignitethephoenix** (7): That chorus cleared my acne and cleaned by soul. Thanks Hilary!

**PenOrAPencil** (7): I remembered the chorus being more explosive when I first listened to it years ago

**stansymash** (7): i was gonna write 'And I'm Coming With Delight!" but it made me feel filthy and also made me giggle

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): like I love the song but it just hasn’t aged well for me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): OK THIS IS A BOP

**zamomattel** (7): Clean has been dewigged

**MissyBee37** (6.5): This song does not age as well as I thought it would. I had a lot more nostalgia for it before I listened to it for the rate. It's not bad, though.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): Pretty basic and definitely sounds like a early to mid 2000s Disney Channel star track, but Hillary sounds nice and it gives me some nostalgic vibes even though I never really watched the live action Disney Channel shows.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): isn't it

**PendulumThief** (6): Hilary's voice sounds like it's been scrubbed clean of all personality and is restricted to singing in monotone.

**rocketgamer31** (6): Cute, but it's a little too Radio Disney for me, sorry

**SkyBlade79** (6): generic chorus, interesting verses

**fourchip** (5.7): i guess??

**enecks** (5): When I come it's not clean I feel dirty I hate myself I feel impure I want death

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): She sounds like she’s not even trying.

**quaerex** (5): I never got the Hilary Duff appeal, and I still don’t. She sounds like a less iconic Britney.

**JustinJSrisuk** (4.8): Bland pop-rock production and Hilary Duff’s weak vocals bring down this unmemorable little song.

**shineflyer** (4.5): Ah, yes, cheap and overlayered Disney production.

**Elitefourbrad** (4): Y’all really overrate Hilary Duff when she’s a dollar store Lindsay Lohan.

**nooodisaster** (4): I feel bad b/c some rates are at such a disadvantage here. Like what does it mean to be the best of Disney singles in a rate with actual musicians?

**therokinrolla** (4): I DONT SEE THE HYPE IM SORRY

**TheTimidMartian** (4): honestly great production but terrible lyrics and terrible vocals. that chorus though

**wailordfan** (4): This just seems like a Walmart version of any Fearless era Taylor Swift song but not even that good.

**awryj** (3): Her voice reminds me of a cat in heat

**Kaylaboe** (3): painfully average

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3): I'm not trying to be mean this is just realistically a 3.

**topesmachine** (3): this song's iconic but only because it's a mess

**WilsonJason** (3): can we just leave her in the 00s

**kappyko** (2.5): sorry this is still boring lol i gave this my 0 before and i won't give it today but :///

**berober04** (1.5): In a Disney rate? Straight 10. Against the cream of the pop crop? Doesn't come close.

**carliescion** (0): Hilary Duff should never had made music

**sletrab07** (0): hammer pls, I love Hillary, but this is not the way to bring her back to relevance.

dropthehammer11: **dirdbub** (5): “Clean” I wrote as I was walking out of Liberty in London. Someone I used to date— it hit me that I’d been in the same city as him for two weeks and I hadn’t thought about it. When it did hit me, it was like, ‘Oh, I hope he’s doing well’. And nothing else. And you know how it is when you’re going through heartbreak. A heartbroken person is unlike any other person. Their time moves at a completely different pace than ours. It’s this mental, physical, emotional ache and feeling so conflicted. Nothing distracts you from it. Then time passes, and the more you live your life and create new habits, you get used to not having a text message every morning saying, ‘Hello, beautiful. Good morning.’ You get used to not calling someone at night to tell them how your day was. You replace these old habits with new habits, like texting your friends in a group chat all day and planning fun dinner parties and going out on adventures with your girlfriends, and then all of a sudden one day you’re in London and you realize you’ve been in the same place as your ex for two weeks and you’re fine. And you hope he’s fine. The first thought that came to my mind was – I’m finally clean. (i’ve done my research on this song, and many websites say that this is about Tay’s love life. i agree, but i also think there is another meaning behind the obvious, as there is to many songs. maybe it’s just me and my pessimistic mind, but the lines “ten months sober, i must admit; just because you’re clean don’t mean you don’t miss it”, “hung my head as i lost the war; the sky turned black like a perfect storm” and “the water filled my lungs, i screamed so loud but; but no one heard a thing” kinda hits me as her describing depression. but then again, it may just be me and my pessimistic mind. but as someone who has gone through depression, and is still battling it, i relate with those lines in that way. sometimes, you’re crying inside so much, you’re mentally yelling, but no one realizes what you’re going through. and depression is normally associated w dark clouds and such. “just because you’re clean don’t mean you don’t miss it” sometimes, it’s quite hard to not miss the pain. but remember, this is just my personal opinions. everyone has secrets that they try to express; but sometimes they don’t express it in the obvious ways. (of course, i’m not saying Taylor Swift is being horrible or anything))

Okay, this song is a paradox. Hailee Steinfeld is the most generic, lifeless, dull pop artist out there right now, making the most trie pop songs possible. However...this bops? Pretty hard. The beat is nice, the hook is infectious as all hell, melodies on point...lightning struck.

---
**gannade** (10): A future EGOT winner who is currently going through her flop phase. Release your album Hailee and stop doing Pitch Perfect/Transformer movies >____>

**Mudkip1** (10): wow a bop

**twat\_brained** (10): I gave this a 10 the first time around, I'm giving this a 10 the second time around. Also, I realize that neither this nor "Touch Of My Hand" is the generation-defining masturbation anthem. That would be "Dancin' In Circles".

**jhxcb** (9.3): Take notes. This is what a real bop sounds like.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): as usual, it's better than the better-known song with the same name

**awryj** (9): This song sounds so stereotypically mid-2010s and yet it's such a bop

**calltehshots** (9): straight up tampon commercial music but my oscar nominated queen did that tampon commercial justice

**enecks** (9): I am so pathetic I have to make a lizardsona version of myself with all the things I want to love myself. I have to give her nice breasts and a big dick I'm such a mess. I commission porn of myself. Is this the ultimate bizarre form of self love?

**followingfreeways** (9): queen of screaming her own name

**MissyBee37** (9): I love this song. This song made me love Hailee. Those "ah la la"s are fire.I know what it's really about but I like to enjoy the lighter layer that it's just about loving yourself emotionally lol. It's such a fun, feel-good song... And then there's that layer that gives it a sexy edge. Kudos to her for being bold enough to go for this song!

**mustangs16** (9): not as good as "i touch myself" if we're talking about masturbation songs but it's a good spiritual successor for the millennial generation

**skargardin** (9): it’s a little too bombastic and unnecessarily noisy in the chorus but quite solid all around

**swankyhoodrat** (9): It’s so fucKING CATCHY

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.9): queen of masturbation

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): this is a #mood

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Definitely one of the more memorable songs out there on the topic of masturbating. The chorus is so infectious.

**boogiepanda** (8): Can't believe from all the bangers off Haiz this is the only that r/popheads chose, truly a sub of no taste

**rickikardashian** (8): I always thought it was a stretch that this was considered a masturbation song, until I read the lyrics. I’m just disturbed knowing, somewhere in the world, there’s a little girl right now singing about “*touching the pain away*”

**wailordfan** (8): https://media.tenor.com/images/02a959c1924d2fb7e9553af4199d34b3/tenor.gif

**JMez2612** (7.9): We love a 1/8 Black queen of masturbation!!

**sletrab07** (7.9): Queen of masturbation

**stansymash** (7.7): Harry Seinfeld and Justin Beebo continue to exchange response tracks in their ongoing beef and with this one Halsey really takes the edge. i hate myself

**eklxtreme** (7.5): it's really well produced and it's a fun song when you know what it's about.

**grxmes** (7.5): Very cookie-cutter self-empowerment song BUT a very unique subversive masturbation bop (a masturbop if you will)

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7.5): Jerking off is cool now, kids

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): Queen of masturbating

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): I've always thought the biggest problem with Hailee as a pop singer is that she doesn't really stand out from the crowd in terms of her music or vocals. This song gives her something though in that I can't think of many other pop girls would put out a song that's so clearly about masturbation. It's also her best song, so I guess Hailee should just exclusively write about jerking off. But she also shouldn't because it would ruin my idea for a concept album.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.3): A fun (literal) self-love anthem that is hampered by Hailee Steinfeld’s rather anonymous vocal delivery.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.2): It's definitely not the best pop song about female masturbation I've ever heard. To be fair, it has some pretty strong competition in that field (Dancin' in Circles, I Touch Myself).

**axestogrind** (7): I refuse to believe an entire writing camp wrote this song and NOT knew what it sounded like. When Hailee gave that interview like 'people can interpret however they want' you KNOW home girl was speaking out of her ass. Just... 'at night, I feel it deep inside without you'? 'I'm gonna touch the pain away'??? 'Know how to satisfy / Keeping that tempo right'?????? No one at the writing table like... hey guys this sounds like Hailee is fingering her own coochie... should we keep writing this?? Anyways... Dancin' in Circles could never, Tove Lo found dead etc. etc.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): the message is a little weird. If you are gonna do a song about masturbation go all the way, don’t leave it in the middle between “guys, love yourselves” and “guys, touch yourselves”. It kinda feels too short, like there’s something missing. The chorus is really catchy but once you’ve finished it that’s the only thing you’ll remember.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): I'm biased against "you're beautiful, no matter what they say" songs because they just don't raise my spirits like they're supposed to. I just think "good for you, I guess".

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): a mood always.

**Raykel** (7): This song is so confusing, like it's cliche mom pop but the innuendos make it so that even my hoe ass cringes at some of the lines. "I'm gonna love me so hard til it hurts." Gurl be careful that ain't fun in the long run. Yet with all this, I still find myself quivering to the rythmn.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): has anyone masturbated to this

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I'm about this Hailee bop but there's tough competition in this rate, but I really do appreciate how upbeat and massive this song sounds.

**WilsonJason** (7): woop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): we get it Haley you masturbate.

**carliescion** (6): I've overplayed this far too much to enjoy it more

**kappyko** (6): ~~this is legitimately good fun fuck off lol~~ nvm lol.

**nooodisaster** (6): it's so wild to remember she's the true grit girl.

**zamomattel** (5.5): the coco montrese among alaskas

**letsallpoo** (5): I love MAY

**shineflyer** (5): kinda cheesy, the layered "I love me" is a bit much.

**fourchip** (4.5): stop making me listen to stuff like this

**omgcow** (4): A masturbation anthem but honestly? Britney did it better with "Touch of My Hand" and that's that on THAT

**saucymac** (4): generic generic generic

**triptoyourheart** (4): Her most interesting song and it’s still about as interesting as mayonnaise with salt and pepper added.

**suspicious\_padding** (3.4): Do we really need this model girl?

**LuckyKidA** (3.2): She was great in True Grit and Edge of Seventeen.

**joshually** (3): This song struggles to present a hook to the listener.

**TheTimidMartian** (3): generic and already dated (!) production. vocals are dry and unsupported. the melody is bad, the choruses are atrocious

**Elitefourbrad** (1): wow a song from an instagram model!!!

**JunkyGS** (1): No.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f-uU4dXfRnM/T3IFlMV8t4I/AAAAAAAAAFs/r6BTOq5_BHU/s1600/101_1104.JPG

**quaerex** (0): The cringe I feel listening to this is only surpassed by the cringe she must have felt singing it.

dropthehammer11: **dirdbub** (2.5): "Love Yourself" is a song recorded by Canadian singer Justin Bieber for his fourth studio album Purpose (2015). The song was released first as a promotional single on November 8, 2015, and later8] On November 9, 2015 "Lond for the song at first, and the original lyric was indeed "fuck yourself." [19] In the song's bridge, Bieber uses a "brass-and-vocalese" style.[20] Andrew Unterberger of Spin called it "an earth-salting, cruelly chuckling kiss-off track, it features an unprecedented-for-Bieber caliber of lyrical detail, and its minimal arrangement allows every lyrical barb to pop like one of the song’s palm-mutes. For such sour grapes, though, 'Love Yourself' still sounds exultant; one of many reminders this year that for all his insistence on being a good person, Bieber may ultimately be best served as a Top 40 heel."[14] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly complimented the track as one of her favourites from the album, naming it "the world’s first campfire-folk diss track."[21] Amy Davidson of Digital Spy agreed, calling it a 'deliciously evil pusic Times thought the song was "a cool change of pace and nod musically to his 2014 duet with Cody Simpson 'Home to Mama'," adding: "Bieber is a great vocalist and does well on acoustic tracks."[23] For Consequence of Sound editor Janine Schaults, "all the credit goes to Sheeran’s cherubic magic powers. Refreshingly, just a guitar and a lonely trumpet interlude accompany Bieobby ex, is generic acoustic-pop."[27] In a less favorable review, Pitchfork's Brad Nelson wrote that, lyrically, "it's needlessly mean, neither funny nor clever, and it doesn't do much to justify the severity of its perspective."[28] Al Horner of NME noted that the song is "more traditionally Bieber, and [its] big pop hook [is] out of place amidst the forward-thinking electronic scuttle."[29] Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine called the lyrics "unintentionally hilare Yourself" was replaced at the top by Rihanna's "Work" and descended to number two.[38] By the middle of 2016, the song had sold 1.6 million copies in the U.S.[39] On the chart dated 7 Maer on the Adult Contemporary chart.[42] The song was the most-played song in the United States in 2016, with nearly 4 billion audience impressions.[43]

tbh I was gonna write about this one, but I'm just gonna ping /u/kappyko because this is pretty much his song

---
**kappyko** (11): wow we love a rate winner, i'm so glad i could choose it for this rate for it to win with a 9+ average ;). just can't say no to this wonderful electro-disco-R&B track, led by OFWGKTA alumni Syd tha Kyd. KAYTRANADA knows how to make a beat, and this has just enough subtlety and pretty mixing to make it matter.

**awryj** (10): a bop

**calltehshots** (10): dances around my room

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ABSOLUTELY ROBBED! A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE BALLAD!

**Kaylaboe** (10): honestly one of the best electronic songs in history

**over9000skeletons** (10): this sub sleeps on syd and kaytranada and the internet smh

**swankyhoodrat** (10): My favorite find from this rate!

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Glowed Up Deserved Better But I’ll Be Happy With This

**axestogrind** (9): Queer POC excellence

**DraculaWeekend** (9): So chill.

**eklxtreme** (9): the production is perfection and kaytranada is one of the best of our time.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This Beat is sick great

**PenOrAPencil** (9): it’s so groovy

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): My favorite Kaytranada song, the bouncy production is simple but so well executed and ready for dancing. The real MVP though is Syd, who just kills it. Her airy, laid-back vocals are kind of unique for a dance song but they fit so well on here. When will Syd become a main pop girl?

**twat\_brained** (8.9): I just found myself getting lost in this beat and that's the kind of EDM I can really admire. I wish I could've seen this at Igloofest last weekend. :/

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): A groovy hip-house bop.

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): This is a bop, Syd sounds great

**skargardin** (8.5): funky, fun bop

**topesmachine** (8.5): I would bottom for kaytranada

**stansymash** (8.1): im sorry kapy

**dirdbub** (8): This is the point where I start linking irrelevant yet funny Tumblr posts: http://durbikins.tumblr.com/post/162705240641/

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A solid, if sleepy Kaytranada track. The whole album front to back is brilliant, and while this one is one of the lesser tracks on the album, it's still very good.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): Smooth. *Too* smooth.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7.5): smooth, and the production is slightly throwback but very very 2017

**boogiepanda** (7.5): Not a fan of the house beats

**shineflyer** (7.5): C H I L L M U S I C

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): good.

**omgcow** (7): cool

**SkyBlade79** (7): kind of a bop, too bad it’s out first day

**jhxcb** (6.8): The vocal effects are distracting.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (6.7): ok okay !

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): isn't it

**deadspiderwall** (6): background music

**cadastre** (5): Wasn’t snubbed.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): sounds like a weird soundcloud remix of an already existing song (sorry kappy)

**nooodisaster** (5): so rock a bye baby rockabye (is sleepy song)

**wailordfan** (5): the vocals bug the living hell out of me. It’s overly produced, too soft and minimalistic and feels almost pandering to an unknown audience.

**zamomattel** (4.5): this was nice but got a little forgettable

**Elitefourbrad** (4): This sounds like something I could make in five minutes in GarageBand.

**quaerex** (4): I generally dislike the overprocessed, artificially quiet vocals, and that’s way too prominent on this song. Also, why maracas?

**JMez2612** (2): This was kinda boring, the beat kind of stopped in the middle and I got disinterested real quick.

**joshually** (2): this is perhaps TOO low-key for me... I almost feel like I have no permission to do anything while this song is playing except be high and slouch

**TheTimidMartian** (1): unlistenable. vocals are awful, and it sounds like background music.

I'm a Halsey stan as most of you know, and this song is one of her strongest. The hook is absolutely incredible, the beat is punchy and beaming, the lyrics are super memorable and very much Halsey. Most of y'all called this a Tumblr anthem, while I call it pop perfection.

---
**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): go away discount lorde this deserved to win the tumblr rate

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): tbh this should have won that rate

**calltehshots** (10): another song i'm sad i'm not giving my 11 to. i don't think halsey can ever top this song tbh. (and the video is incredible)

**dirdbub** (10): What's your favorite idea? Mine is being creative. How do you get the idea? I just try to think, creatively. Now when you look at this orange, tell me please, what do you see? It's just a boring old orange! Maybe to you, but not to me. I see a silly face! (wow!) Walking around and smiling at me. I don't see what you mean.. 'Cause you're not thinking creatively! So take a look at my hair. (cool!) I use my hair to express myself. That sounds really boring.. I use my hair to express myself. Now when you stare at the clouds in the sky, don't you find it exciting? (no..) Come on, take another look! (oh right!) I can see a hat, I can see a cat, I can see a man with a baseball bat! I can see a dog, I can see a frog, I can see a ladder leaning on a log. Think you're getting the hang of it now! Using your minds to have a good time. I might paint a picture of a clown! Whoa there, friend, you might need to slow down. Here's another good tip! (yeah?) Of how to be a creative whiz kid. Go and collect some leaves and sticks and arrange them into your favorite color. Blue! Red! Green! NO! Green is not a creative color. There's one more thing that you need to know before you let your creativity flow. Listen to your heart, listen to the rain, listen to the voices in your brain. Come on guys, let's get creative! Get creative! Get creativle! Get;ljdfls Crejatljdsl;fkjasodijtl;kajfl.,da  jf;lsafd !! ;cljoei  CRea tiv t vdle e !Lkjl; fdf jals  J!I LIJ oijf :LU*#O ;ljkF L:jd;l  ;lJ ;Ljk Now let's all agree to never be creative again.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Halsey is a lyrical genius. It really shows here, as everything is blue, literally and figuratively. The colour that everyone is defines who we are as a person and differentiates ourselves from the rest of the crowd. Meanwhile, Halsey is exploring her daddy fetish in this song, Demi Lovato is shook.

**gannade** (10): An amazing song! Halsey is not only an inspirational WOC, but she truly respects everyone, regardless of color.

**nooodisaster** (10): i mean, it's no him & i, but

**rickikardashian** (10): “Finally, it’s done” *The white tumblr girl* cheered. She had been working on that picture to post for like, forever. Her friend, *hipster guy that thinks he’s a professional photographer because he has a Canon* did a photoshoot with her in front of a parking lot, and after arduous hours of editing the picture on VSCO, it was perfect, it totally followed her B&W pale grunge _A  E  S  T  H  E  T  I  C_, now there was only 1 thing left to do, and it was to choose a caption. The picture wouldn’t be complete with an edgy yet classy yet funny yet relatable yet artsy caption, it would ruin her feed. She sat down to think, but nothing came, she was frustrated, she hadn’t been through this hard of a time since she dyed the tips of her hair blonde herself. She was desperate. She was about to give up, until she thought about it, to steal a quote from a song. She went on her Spotify a considered her options. A Marina song? Not edgy enough. A Lana song? Too vintage. An Alessia song? Too mainstream. What could encapsulate her totally unique personality and show to the world that she was mysterious, not like other girls and fantasizes about having a threesome with James Dean and her drug dealer? “I GOT IT!” She screamed. She ran to her McBook and typed the phrase that was totally her af. _“You were red, and you liked me because I was blue, but you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky… Then you decided purple just wasn't for you”_. She smiled and posted her picture. She was happy... She couldn’t even.

**skargardin** (10): impeccable melodies and Halsey’s enunciation is not as irritating as it usually is here.

**SkyBlade79** (10): the rainbow is shaken

**swankyhoodrat** (10): I don’t need y’all sending this to the bottom

**twat\_brained** (10): When I first rated this, I gave it a 10. Rating this now, it's still a 10. I also stated that "'you were red and you liked me because I was blue' fucking destroys your fave's existence". I still stand by this statement. As a Halsey stan, all I want is for this to at least make day 2.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): An Iconic Song And One Of The Only Two Good Songs In Badlands (A Trash Album Sorry Hammer)

**wailordfan** (10): Honestly a perfect alternative pop sound, and Halsey’s best song on Badlands, deserves top 10 here, and top 10 on Billboard.

**shineflyer** (9.8): there's too much going on to describe, so instead, I'll just point out how on the original rate the song title is "Colours," while it is "Colors" on this one.

**fourchip** (9.3): jess / 18 / bands n stuff / you were red, and you liked me because i was blue / bisexual / normal people scare me

**jhxcb** (9.1): Some of Halsey's best work.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): https://m.imgur.com/MDayyFJ

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A great chorus! Great Verses! A bridge!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Tri-bi legend snapped here.

**therokinrolla** (9): blue balls from halsey losing its rate

**axestogrind** (8.5): 1) Overwritten lyrics 2) Production slaps 3) wAaaelcum to mAai Kiiitzchden 4) Lyrics that will supply Tumblr lyric edits for years to come... it's peak Halsey.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8.5): halsey’s best by FAR

**followingfreeways** (8): tumblr's impact

**kappyko** (8): it makes me sooo mad how this chorus, in terms of production and melody, is probably one of the best of the decade yet Halsey wastes it on a song about brockhampton

**saucymac** (8): oh shit I like Halsey

**WilsonJason** (8): one of the worst recent artists and her only listenable song

**awryj** (7.5): YO LISTEN UP HERES A STORY ABOUT A LITTLE HALSEY THAT LIVES IN A BLUE WORLD AND AAALL DAY AND AAALL NIGHT AND EVERYTHING SHE SEES IS JUST BLUE LIKE HER IN-SIIIDE AND OUT-SIIIDE BLUE HER HOUSE WITH A BLUE LITTLE WINDOW AND A BLUE CORVETTE AND EVERYTHING IS BLUE FOR HER AND HERSELF AND EVERYBODY AROUND CUZ SHE AINT GOT NOBODY TO LISTEEEN

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I still think this song is about falling in love with an older man after seeing the video. Listening to the song on its didn’t change that.

**theburningundead** (7.5): I just can't manage to hate this song, as much as the bridge and some of the lyrics make me want to

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): alright Ashley we get it you wanna suck a Smurf dick but you ain't the only one so get over it.

**carliescion** (7): Not Halsey's best song, but the stripped version is so good

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): It’s still better than most of the tracks off of Hopeless Fountain Kingdom.

**omgcow** (7): Very 2015 tumblr. I feel like I should be reblogging photos of these song lyrics superimposed on vaguely hipster settings

**strawberryswing1** (7): It's really catchy but that cringey ass bridge ruins it ugh

**triptoyourheart** (7): A Halsey song that isn’t completely cringe worthy? I’m shook.

**rocketgamer31** (6.5): I used to like this but now it kinda annoys me, especially the BLLLUUUEEEE in the chorus

**banananaise** (6): i really don't like the pattern in Halsey songs for her voice to be drowned out by the loud and busy production

**boogiepanda** (6): Cringe

**chipsi1** (6): this is mediocre

**eklxtreme** (6): her attempt at a big pop song. it's catchy as hell but i dont think it has a whole lot going for it, otherwise. she has so many better songs.

**enecks** (6): You only got a high score from me because of relativity to the rate

**grxmes** (6): Overrated

**NapsAndNetflix** (6): apart from closer this is halseys best song and it's only a 6, pretty sad!

**quaerex** (6): The lilac sky part is trying way too hard. Also, her vocals are too overprocessed.

**suspicious\_padding** (5.5): Halsey’s best song.

**berober04** (5): But loving him was Red *fluting intensifies*

**LandonKidatrea** (5): YO LISTEN UP, HERE'S A STORY

[/r/popheads/comments/7uus6a/rate_all_stars_day_1_let_the_rate_fall_down/dtnhc2l/]

=====

dropthehammer11: **stansymash** (5): i can't believe popheads made me listen to frickin halsey

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): I know this is supposed to be her best song, but I'm just not a big fan of her vocals or the production on it. Halsey sounds kind of flat vocally to me and the production ranges from serviceable to kind of weird and almost disjointed, like there's something just slightly off about it.

**zamomattel** (5): in the realm of halsey songs this is brilliant, but otherwise not so much

**sletrab07** (4.2): Goddamnit it, this song irritates me to no end.

**JunkyGS** (4): Blue.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): I really just do not like Badlands-era Halsey

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): Okay wow this song is definitely more annoying than I remembered and this is probably a lower score than I gave it before but it's easily the worst song in this rate, but I also see another Halsey song ahead so I'm ready to be proved wrong.

**topesmachine** (4): i don't like halsey and this song is meh

**joshually** (3): I feel like Halsey is just a bad vocalist in general, like she should just be on youtube, but not famous

**cadastre** (2): If Spectrum by Flo and avocado voice had a baby but nobody knew who the father was and the mom didn’t want a paternity test because she didn’t want people to know who the real dad was out of shame and regret.

**DraculaWeekend** (2): It's blue da ba dee da ba daa

**TheTimidMartian** (2): songwriting is atrocious and the rhymes are horrible. the vocals are absolutely terrible

**deadspiderwall** (1): buy Red on iTunes

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (0): These lyrics are the cringiest r/im14andthisisdeep shit I’ve ever heard. And the production is not good enough to save this mess of a song. Ratsey you can do so much better.

---
This song is just very happy. It starts out kind of ethereal but then builds to one hell of a chorus which is honestly the heart and soul of this song. So damn catchy.

---
**agentofscranton** (10): i can't believe there was a rate between CHVRCHES and MisterWives and I wasn't here to give this my 11

**calltehshots** (10): okay this is straight up TJ maxx shopping music but that doesnt mean it doesnt completely SLAP

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is honestly a bop.

**LandonKidatrea** (10): A year ago I would've given this song my 11. Such a fool I was, wasting my 11s on my actual faves.

**sasuke-lp** (10): MisterWives really knows how to make you feel happy, and this song is a perfect example for that. I fucking love them so much <3

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Oh God This Is My First Listen And Honestly? I’m In Love

**WilsonJason** (10): misterwives are actually good

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9.5): dat enunciation, it's somehow lovely tho

**shineflyer** (9.5): what an EXPLOSIVE chorus.

**skargardin** (9.5): I had no idea who ‘Misterwives’ were before this but I can’t deny that this song is a fun, anthemic piece of pop.

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): YoOoOoOoOouUuUuUu

**eklxtreme** (9): it’s songs like these that remind me why indie pop is so amazing. misterwives know how to write a perfect pop chorus and back it with great instrumentation and powerful dynamics overall.

**grxmes** (9): It's a good song but this cover will always be better

**JMez2612** (9): I'm giving too many high scores omg, this song is super good wow wig

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): I’ve always had troubles getting through MisterWhore’s discography because I always found the female vocals to be a bit shout-y especially at her higher registers, but I know a bop when I hear it!

**therokinrolla** (9): remember when people thought misterwives could win that rate right before the top 3 were revealed? good times. i miss it

**kappyko** (8.9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SU0gFPMwP8

**awryj** (8.8): ok this is kind of a bop

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Great beat but I wish I could understand more than every third word the vocalist is saying.

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.1): Mandy Lee’s unique, almost keening voice absolutely makes this song for me.

**carliescion** (8): This sounds like Aurora

**fourchip** (8): solid song but vocalist’s voice brings it down a bit for me

**Kaylaboe** (8): love the song but the vocals are grating

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): A cute bop

**rocketgamer31** (8): First time hearing this, really catchy

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): sorry to detract from the song but this girl/lead singer is so fucking pretty

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A great Misterwives track!!! They did a good job of this love and bumps this one up a few points.

**jhxcb** (7.8): I like it, but I also am not 100% feeling her voice with this style.

**stansymash** (7.8): well this sure is peppy! like the hare

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): started off well but didn't really go anywhere. Still kinda enjoyable though.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): i love joanna newsom

**SkyBlade79** (7): I love how unexpected that chorus is. Very nice change.

**topesmachine** (7): this only gets points because of that one vine

**axestogrind** (6.5): The only song I can get into on the album is Machine. Everything else is so mediocre :/

**DraculaWeekend** (6): The singer has a very…unique voice. Not my favorite by them.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): I can’t stop thinking about how they tried to make this a hit on Vine

**nooodisaster** (6): Yasss, slay those vocals queen! (Idk who this artist is)

**LuckyKidA** (5.1): "This reminds me of vine so bad" is the top Youtube comment.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Cool a decent Eurovision song!

**joshually** (5): I've heard worse songs I guess....

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): isn't it

**boogiepanda** (3): Don't like the chorus at all

**quaerex** (3): The girl singing sounds like she injected herself with helium and then tried to imitate Britney Spears. If she went down an octave, this song might be palatable.

**TheTimidMartian** (3): very bad vocals means this song relies wholly on its production which is thankfully pretty good.

**triptoyourheart** (3): Whalecum to mai keychain, we have bananies, and avocadies

**zamomattel** (3): Christina outsold (but like she actually did this time)

One of the quintissential emo songs of the millenium, this was the anthem to several middle school phases. Fall Out Boy definitely spoke to an entire generation with their music. Their lyrics stick in your head like glue and those guitar riffs will stay forever catchy. This is probably their signature song; as it should be.

---
**strawberryswing1** (11): "Am I more than you bargained for yet?" Is there a more relatable and perfect opening line? There are "better" songs in this rate, but this song and Fall Out Boy in general will always have a special place in my heart, and it deserves my 11. Pete Wentz deserves more credit for his songwriting skills, tbh.

**calltehshots** (10): kings. anybody who gives less than an 8 has no soul.

**carliescion** (10): The best emo song of all time

**dirdbub** (10): http://erickspb.tumblr.com/post/63608271364/

**DraculaWeekend** (10): From Under the Cork Tree remains one of my favorite albums ever.

**followingfreeways** (10): this song just makes me so insanely happy????? it's definitely because of the nostalgia but this song makes me so happy I love this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This song is a major goddamn fucking bop even if he the hook is just GOINGDONWDOWN INNARLERROND.

**kappyko** (10): DOOOOOWN DOOOOWN INALEOULEIELEO

**mustangs16** (10): such a good song that i fear will not get the respect it deserves in this rate

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Go Off Kings of Rock.

**omgcow** (10): This song is SO MUCH FUN to sing along to even if it involves making up the chorus because the enunciation is so bad

**swankyhoodrat** (10): AM I MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED FOR YET I’VE BEEN DYING TO TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANNA HEAR CAUSE THAT’S JUST WHO I AM THIS WEEK

**jhxcb** (9.4): This is true FOB. Catchy, lyrics nobody can understand, and tons of emo.

**banananaise** (9): i remember thinking the "cock it and pull it" part was so dirty when i was a kid

**eklxtreme** (9): this is how i like my pop punk; strong vocals, heavy guitars, and nostalgic vibes

**shineflyer** (9): I'm always down with some classic pop punk tracks. And this one's got a punch. The backup vocals on the bridge help make it even more anthemic.

**wailordfan** (9): Another strong song, but the strength and sound of the guitar riffs at the intro and in the song part separations doesn’t really fit the rest of the song, if it weren’t so heavy, it would fit the feel of the song more.

**twat\_brained** (8.9): I know people complain about Ariana Grande's enunciation, but Patrick Stump is something else.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.6): But what is a loaded God complex

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): , SUGAR WE’RE GOING DOWN INTO THE PITS OF MY FORMER WANNABE EMO SELF

**Elitefourbrad** (8): my inner emo comes out whenever this song comes on and i shake my ass all over the floor

**rocketgamer31** (8): Reminds me of my angsty emo phase, but who am I kidding I'm still emo

**SkyBlade79** (8): one of the best emo songs. Still can’t wait for the English version to come out

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): One of Fall Out Boy's best songs, probably honestly because it takes a more traditional pop song style and doesn't get hung up on oversinging or bizarre lyrics too much. It's a far cry from Young and Menace, that's for sure.

**fourchip** (7.9): emo classic

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): yeah it kinda bops but it's dated and meh and I'll be fine if I never listen to it again.

**topesmachine** (7.5): a decent pop punk song

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): it's iconic but not legendary, sorry fangirl

**chipsi1** (7): what is special about this

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7): 2000s bop

**JMez2612** (7): Which 2000s teen flick did I hear this in? Also I wish the singer would stop doing those Ariana Grande enunciations in the middle.

**joshually** (7): Whereas I hate the affected "punk voice" that's being used by the vocalist, it is a pretty good song.

**nooodisaster** (7): str8 boy bands? in MY popheads? (also i watched the mv for the first time so wholesome and weird! the antler boy has HORRIBLE teeth tho)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I'm not the biggest FOB fan, and this classic track doesn't do much to change my mind. I've always been more of a fan of a Thnks fr the mmrs or however the fuck you spell it. This chorus is nice though.

**zamomattel** (7): not as good as their recent stuff /s

**grxmes** (6.5): Iconic but Sophomore Slump or Dance Dance would probably get a better score from me

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I don’t really have a nostalgia connection to this song, since I didn’t grow up listening to this kind of music, so this song is just kind of meh to me. The chorus is good though and definitely iconic, just not my cup to tea.

**enecks** (5): The other bands in this rate were so much better. Definitely can hear bits of Young and Menace in this.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (4): emo rock is huge among my age group and i will for the life of me never understand why

**theburningundead** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGTe9bLQNIE

**JustinJSrisuk** (3.5): I’ve been to a lot of Warped Tours in my day, and I didn’t like FOB’s music then and still don’t now.

**sasuke-lp** (3): never liked anything by this band

**stansymash** (3): patrick bateman or whatever his name is makes me feel All American Nausea

**TheTimidMartian** (2): bad production and bad vocals. both of these are typical of the artist, but the lyrics here are especially questionable.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): i missed out on an emo phase so i never could get into any of these kinds of groups with the exception of Paramore but i only listen to their latest two albums so

**MaydayPVZ** (0): How is this even enjoyable

---
This song is very much a product of its time and in the modern age, it falls a bit short, but this song is Alanis' commercial peak for its strong chorus and memorable lyrics.

---

**PendulumThief** (0): Alanis honey, nothing in this song is actually ironic.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I'm gonna be that pedantic asshole and say none of these lyrics are actually ironic

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): inb4 comments about nothing being ironic [2]

**carliescion** (8): Queen of not using ironic right

**kappyko** (3): i wonder how many comments make fun of the lyrics not actually being ironic like lol we get it David you took English class

---
**blue\_heart\_** (10): iconic

**deadspiderwall** (10): Queen Alanis

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is honestly one of the best songs that came out on the 90s. You better not make this flop.

**joshually** (10): "10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife" is the story of all my faghags when they go with me to gay clubs

**LandonKidatrea** (10): How did this lose? That rate must've been brutal if Ironic didn't win.

**Leixander** (10): don'tcha think?

**topesmachine** (10): people are still talking about the meaning of irony and if Alanis is using it correctly/incorrectly which is WILD also you can read this song as gay which i do of course

**MissyBee37** (9.5): Forget ironic; this song is ICONIC. (Yeah, I'm sure I'm the hundredth person to make that joke.) But seriously, poor understanding of irony notwithstanding, it's a pop classic. What this song nails is a mood.

**shineflyer** (9.5): This song is a feel-good radio staple. Despite how many times I've heard it, it still puts you in a positive mood. Who cares about whatever bullshit goes down?

**LuckyKidA** (9.4): An inaccurate bop.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): Alanis has such a weird voice

**followingfreeways** (9): all I can think of when I hear this song is the time we talked about this song is not actually ironic in my English class freshman year of high school, also how all my friends made fun of me because I say "figure" like she does :/

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A major bop! Get ready for all the "But nothing in the song is ironic!" comments tho!

**omgcow** (9): Iconic

**PuggleMaster** (9): Iconic movie song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): IT'S LIKE RAAAYYYEEEAYYNNNN

**therokinrolla** (9): this sub doesn't deserve ironic

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): Truly a classic, and responsible for an annoying-ass proto-meme during the ‘90s involving people adding the phrase ”Don’t you think?” every time the word “ironic” was mentioned.

**mustangs16** (8.5): head over feet was so robbed that it didn't even make it into the rate of songs that were robbed!!

**jhxcb** (8.2): There's a reason Ironic and Iconic are only one letter away. However, although all of the situations not being ironic was supposedly "on purpose", I also don't believe it.

**stansymash** (8.2): i feel a lot of power in my belly

**JMez2612** (8): I only like this song because I heard it in that episode of Black Mirror, looses points for irony inception

**nbapip** (8): There will be exactly 0 other people that say this but it's not as good for me after Four Year Strong's cover

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): insert joke about it not being ironic here

**PenOrAPencil** (8): the chorus is so recognizable

**rickikardashian** (8): _This song being chosen over It’s All Coming Back To Me Now although that one is a better song. And isn’t it ironic…._

**sletrab07** (8): This but unironically

**wailordfan** (8): This is the first time I've ever heard this song, and some of the lyrics are amazing, especially in the bridge, 'and you meet the man of my dreams, and then meeting his beautiful wife'. It's cute, and really well performed, but the chorus is a bit grating and a tiny bit screamy, but unlike Demi, the lyrics here make it almost dismiss-able.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I had no clue this song was Alanis! I feel like this is one of the most recognizable 90’s songs out there. That chorus is so memorable.

**axestogrind** (7.5): Alanis is an icon

**dirdbub** (7.5): Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): i fuck with mom pop, ESPECIALLY the 90s rock-influenced songs.

**calltehshots** (7): this song is so stupid but ironically it is also a bop

**chipsi1** (7): I still have no idea what point was she trying to make with this but it's kind of a bop. also i'm pretty sure a lot of the "ironic" situations described in this song can be easily exposed for not actually being ironic but i'm not exactly knowledgeable on what ironic exactly means so ii'l just leave this to the harvard gays

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): You know, I think having 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife actually is ironic. That's one out of like thirty right.

**rocketgamer31** (7): Takes me back

**swankyhoodrat** (7): The chorus is one of the best to sing along to but the verses don’t really stand out to me tbh.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): The production is very 90s. I don't know if it's too much of a knock, the song is far from bad. Out of Alanis's big singles, I think I prefer You Oughta Know though.

**twat\_brained** (7): +3 points for the chorus being great to sing along to, but as has been stated time and time again, the most ironic element of the song itself is that Alanis thinks she's mentioning things which are literal examples of irony but more than anything are grievances. And that's why it has to go out on day 1.

**VodkaInsipido** (7): Iconic Song But Not That Good Tbh

**TheTimidMartian** (6.5): iconic but not very well written, and poorly sung. use of falsetto and falsetto flips are often inappropriate

**berober04** (6): The chorus is iconic, but the verses aren't quite at the top tier for me. Also, the jokes around the lyrics do blunt the song a bit (yes I know, but the jokes still exist).

**Elitefourbrad** (6): Canadian queen, but I hate this song because my aunt sings this in the car if I ever go anywhere with her and she butchered it for me

**nooodisaster** (6): I've never listened to this song before, and decided to start listening to the All Stars playlist in bed right as I was falling asleep. When that chorus dropped I SH RIEKD.

**quaerex** (6): That chorus goes really, really hard. The opening wails take this down from a 7 though.

**strawberryswing1** (6): Her voice is annoying sorry

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): oh I know this song. I just don't care for it.

**zamomattel** (6): I do not mind this song, but it is a little irritating. I didn’t do this rate because at that time I hated Celine (idek why) and I probably would’ve given this song a better score then, but also maybe not because it is irritating

**boogiepanda** (5.6): Not a fan of the tinny dated sound, the remastered version is more my cup of tea

**Raykel** (5.5): The way she says "figures" sounds racist.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): ironic like a good country song

**DraculaWeekend** (5): I know this song is a classic but I never really liked it. It's pretty depressing and "IT'S LIKE RAIIIIIN" drives me nuts.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (4): yikes that chorus is kinda high key not good

**enecks** (4): Ironic. This song is the first song in a rate of all stars and yet is thoroughly bland and blends into the background.

**fourchip** (3): IT’S LIKE RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYAAAAAAAIIIIIINNN

**sasuke-lp** (3): sorry no

**WilsonJason** (3): everything she can do avril lavigne does better

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): i gave this my 0 last time but i wanna save it for another horrible song, i repeat what i said back then: this hasn't aged well. For real, people that say they still listen to this today are either braindead. lying, deaf or all of the above.

**SkyBlade79** (1): I hate this song. The lyrics are super bad, her voice is just annoying, and the production is mediocre.

Beloved synthpop group CHVRCHES have amassed quite a following over the years, and this track is very much who they am. Punchy, bright synths coupled with lovely female vocals and strong percussion. I'm not crazy about CHVRCHES like everyone else, but they definitely deserve the acclaim they get.

---
**AFlyingWhale\_** (11): recover is easily my favorite chvrches song, "i'll give you one more chance to say we can change or part ways/and you take what you need and you don't need me" is just heartbreaking. they perfected their whole emo lyrics + upbeat production schtick. i'm scared for their new album though, get out was pretty disappointing

**theburningundead** (11): I love this song so much, such a satisfying chorus and a fantastic instrumental so I hope everyone gives this the love it deserves

**agentofscranton** (10): there was a CHVRCHES rate?!

**Elitefourbrad** (10): My first time listening to CHVRCHES is an amazing one. I love the 80s synth pop so much and the vocals here are breathy and dreamy.

**sasuke-lp** (10): The first song that got me into CHVRCHES, still has one of the best choruses I've ever heard.

**shineflyer** (10): The chorus feels so passionate, and I love it. Grabs my heart every time.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): CHVRCHES' majestic single off of their debut EP, Recover is brash and bold synthpop, and it's got crashing drums that hit like a truck. Its glorious and it will probably be robbed in this rate

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Jesus Christ Hammer Stop Making Me Listen To Great Songs

**stansymash** (9.7): i love this song so mvch

**fourchip** (9.6): synthpop icons deliver with a very solid track, a chvrches classix

**eklxtreme** (9.5): chvrches doing what they do best: explosive choruses with lauren’s great voice and infectious synths.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): http://bit.ly/2GkE0tY I love Lauren's voice.

**boogiepanda** (9): Give me Lauren Mayberry's voice any day

**skargardin** (9): A heartfelt bop

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPD8Ja64mRU

**dirdbub** (8): Recovery is the seventh studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released on June 18, 2010, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records as the follow-up to Eminem's previous album Relapse (2009). Originally planned to be released as Relapse 2, the album was Studio in Ajax, Ontario, Canada, Playhouse in Parkland, Florida, Avex Honolulu Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii, Encore Studios in Burbank, California, Sun Studios in Temple Bar, Dublin, and Shake 'Em Down Studios in Queens, New York.[6] The album was dedicated "To anyone who's in a dark place tryin' to get out. Keep your head up... It does get better! [sic]" [7] Eminem told Billboard that he was in "full-blown addiction" while recording Encore. He felt happier and "first got sober" during the recording of Relapse, having overcome his addiction. While recording Relapse, he admitted that he had not been "paying attention to what the average listener might like or not like." Just Blaze, the first producer of the album said, "[Eminem] already knew what sort of mistakes he has made with the previous album and where he wanted to go from there." Thus, Recovery was more "emotionally driven" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, "[just] rap records."[8] In contrast to Eminem's previous ite-Trash Party") is considered similar to his early records with lighter and simple rhythmic frame.[12] "Going Through Changes", which samples Black Sabbath's "Changes", depicts Eminem's sorrow and shows himself trapped within fame.[14] "Not Afraid", a mid-tempo song, focuses on personal changes in Eminem, including an end to drug abuse, feuds and violence.[15] Idolator commented that the song was based on the "dark days Eminem has lived through," and "he seems to be at peace with himself now."[16] A writer for MuchMusic website noted that Eminem chose to use his Marshall Mathers ego for the song, rather than Slim Shady.[17] "No Love" features Lil Wayne as a hype man. Eminem's verses follow Lil Wayne,ibes a couple's refusal to separate despite having an abusive relationship. Rihanna sings the chorus, backed by an electric guitar and a piano,[22][23] while acoustic guitar, violin and drums accompany Eminem's verses.[22][24] Rihanna's singing expresses "grief and regret" throughout the song.[25]

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is probably getting out on the first day because it's not as iconic as most of the songs here.

**omgcow** (8): I've never listened to Chvrches but this reminds me of The Birthday Massacre which gives me warm memories of being an angsty high schooler! Love it tho

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): CHVRCHES doing what they do best. Great vocals from Lauren over strong synthy production. Kind of textbook but still good. I love how the synths build during the chorus.

**awryj** (7.8): I like this song but it sounds kinda... tacky? The synths feel jarring to me. Definitely my least favorite single from The Bones of What You Believe

**Albert\_Cole** (7.1): She just sounds so... unbothered by what she's singing.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): oh nice, we stan and wig flew

**enecks** (7): Another song that feels out of its league in this rate a bit, but it's still well constructed on its own merits. 7 is harsh but I have to scale to the competition.

**LandonKidatrea** (7): This is a B tier CHVRCHES song AT BEST.

**Leixander** (7): Definitely not one of their best songs, cough cough Gun was robbed. cough

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): it happened.

**topesmachine** (7): not chvrches best tbh

**WilsonJason** (7): beep beep

**zamomattel** (7): this is such a popheads song

**jhxcb** (6.9): I don't really have much to say about this one. It's not bad.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): I liked it a lot at first, but it kinda got old after listens.

**wailordfan** (6.5): I just realized I have no clue what this song sounds like looking back. It was pretty, but there wasn't anything that made me think it was better then most of the songs in this rate.

**calltehshots** (6): i mean this song is fine but listening to it in the midst of all these grade A bops and borderline masterpieces it's underwhelming

**ComeOnAndSlang** (6): production is nice… vocals are forgettable

**JMez2612** (6): This is not too bad, I feel like popheads will stan anything with gated reverb drums. I don't see the appeal.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): This was the first thing I ever heard from them. It’s alright

**rocketgamer31** (6): Can't say I stan this, but I also don't really hate it either

**quaerex** (5.5): This feels like elevator music.

**axestogrind** (5): It drags on for so... long.... it needed to be a whole minute shorter and the song is only 3:30

**carliescion** (5): Any songs with a clapping beat loses points

**JustinJSrisuk** (5): I’m always undecided as to whether or not I like Lauren Mayberry’s girlish, pleading and occasionally mewling vocals on CHVRCHES’ songs - and on this track I definitely don’t.

**kappyko** (5): it makes me really sad this isn't as good as i used to find it. this used to be so absolutely entrancing to me, but now the production feels limp. maybe it's just this song, bc "the mother we share" and "gun" hold up particularly well. still kinda vivid and pretty but not worth hearing again unfortunately

**mockturtle\_soup** (5): an average score for an average song by a band that has always been average.

**SkyBlade79** (5): this is literally bananies and avocadies I’m screaming

**triptoyourheart** (5): I’m gonna get roasted for this score but I don’t get the love for this. A very average synthpop song.

**cadastre** (4): I can’t stand CHVRCHES

**swankyhoodrat** (4): First time hearing this song. The combination of her voice and the production is pretty irritating to me. The chorus isn’t as bad (note: I thought the pre-chorus was the chorus??? ok).

**joshually** (3): This song is boring

**TheTimidMartian** (1): reductive lyrics; horrible lyrics are poorly veiled by excessive vocal processing and excessive reliance on production that is not very strong at all

This song right here man. Stromae is a beast, and this song snatched the fuck out of me when I heard it. The production is immaculate, the horns are so fucking LIT. He's smooth af over it too, even though I have no idea what he's saying. Also, y'all ain't clever with your "memes ahah" comments.

---
**Raykel** (11): Stromae serves bops, vocals, well thought out lyrics/social commentary, talented dance moves, artistic music videos, and lewks he designs himself. Our English speaking faves try but they just can't relate.

**awryj** (10): such a clever song

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i regret not giving this a 10 in the original french rate tbh its so GOOD

**kappyko** (10): I walk into the Steam Locomotive themed milkbar with a fake limp. I mutter under my breath, "Greeting Sir! What a fine establishment!" whilst removing my trilby. I place my trenchcoat with oversized collar on a coat rack whilst adjusting my monocle. I check my pocketwatch, loosen my brass breastplate, put the safety on my steam powered glock, and unsheath my cane. I tap on the counter and order a drink. I tell the bartender "Cheers good sir" whilst sipping in gentlemanly fashion. I think about how the world should adopt a steampunk aesthetic. I walk over to the jukebox. I take out a coin sack. I insert a coin. "VOUS LES HOMMES ÊTES TOUS LES MÊMES"

**swankyhoodrat** (10): Fuck I love electric swing. His voice is great too.

**twat\_brained** (10): lol, les hommes sont pas merde

**VodkaInsipido** (10): JESUS FUCKING CHRIST HAMMER I HATE YOU WHY IS IT SO HARD TO CHOOSE AN 11 IN THIS RATE

**Albert\_Cole** (9.5): Je ne pense pas que je comprenne ce que les paroles signifient, mais j'adore le voix de Stromae

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.4): [FRESH] Is Witness Katy's ARTPOP?

**jhxcb** (9.4): It's upbeat, it's fun, what's not to love?

**PenOrAPencil** (9): A French bop, and as someone who speaks French at an upper intermediate level, it’s cool to understand most of the lyrics

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): dad went off!!

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.5): I am feeling this

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): iconic sample

**enecks** (8): I hate to say it but modern meme culture sucks. It's just using irony to get away with being shitty people

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6.8): i can’t understand shit, pt.2

**TheTimidMartian** (6.8): effective songwriting and vocal delivery. definitely weaker without video; excessive reliance on production during chorus

**stansymash** (6.7): this was trying very hard not to be boring and in the process became boring

Norwegian queen Dagny came through with the smoothest of Europop. The guitar-based drop is so damn pleasant on the ears, while Dagny's singing and lyrics are sexy and seductive. Definitely a bop, and robbed a bit in this rate.

---
**berober04** (11): No shocker, I've been hyping this one for like 2 months now. What gets me is how it gets better every listen. This is a work of art I swear.

**nikitasd** (11): Dagny in general has been one of favourite discoveries in recent memory, every track released so far from her has an insanely sticky chorus and a smooth instrumental. Wearing Nothing is no different, the upbeat percussion and funk-lite bass delivers that summery vibe so well.

**swankyhoodrat** (11): Okay, I know I’m gonna be That One Bitch that gives this my 11 even though there are so many timeless, earth-shattering BOPS on this list. Why? Because here I am, in a corner by myself, playing this shit over and over. The groovy bass line and the pounding drum make for such a slick, understated chorus experience that, for me, is the ultimate experience. I’m thinking nobody gave a shit about this song on popheads other than me, to be honest. Then I clicked the rate. There she is in all her glory: That One Bitch, Dagny, who has been putting out under hyped pop goodness since she dropped “Backbeat”. But this? This is the pinnacle of Norwegian pop.

**agentofscranton** (10): everybody should listen to Dagny's Ultraviolet EP - it's just back to back bops, you're missing out if you don't

**carliescion** (10): My favorite Norwegian pop girl

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): my entire ass is out

**dirdbub** (10): "Strip That Down" is the debut solo single by English singer and songwriter Liam Payne, featuring guest vocals from American rapper Quavo. It was released as the lead single for his forthcoming debut studio album on 19 May 2017, via Capitol Records in the UK and Republic Records in the US.[3] The song was written by Payne, Ed Sheeran—who contributes uncredited vip-hop vibe while slinking around with twerking back-up dancers."[20] Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that the video is "as awkward as the song", saying: "The Migos rapper appears completely at ease in his surroundings, while Liam looks like he accidentally wandered on to the set."[21] As of 23 November 2017, the video has over 210 million views on YouTube, becoming Payne's first Vevo-certified video without One Direction. "Strip That Down" charted within the top 5 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The single reached number eaked at number 13 in May 2012); he also eclipsed his fellow members, three of whom also had top tens on this chart (two from Zayn, one each from Horan and Tomlinson respectively; Styles' debut "Sign of the Times" peaked at 37 in June 2017). In the case of Quavo, it surpassed his featured collaboration (with Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) on DJ Khaled's "I'm the One", which peaked at number two in July 2017.[23]

**Mudkip1** (10): wow a bop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Now. This. Is. A. Bop.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is such a fun song

**rickikardashian** (10): me until i realize im insecure about my body and hide it in joggers and oversized sweaters

**sasuke-lp** (10): so fucking good! Queen of feel good pop

**kappyko** (9.9): i'm absolutely curious how this song is going to do in the rate since it never truly got RATED. didn't give this any points in fantasy eurovision and while part of me regrets it part of me doesn't bc i won lol sorry mashluke

**twat\_brained** (9.7): The song itself is near-perfect. My only criticism is that I feel it deserves an explosive final chorus. One that really sets the song into a full-blown sprint to the end.

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): backbeat >> but still a complete banger

**Leixander** (9.5): NOTHING AT ALL

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): crude oil is coming to rule the world

**JMez2612** (9): This song has that Max Martin formula, I'm here for this

**MissyBee37** (8.5): This is new to me but I quite like it! Love the beat and the hook. She has a nice voice. Why has this girl only released a handful of singles?? I'd be interested to hear more.

**skargardin** (8.5): Norway delivers on the new pop girl front. It’s got insane production but I’m not much of a fan of the melodies in the verses

**zamomattel** (8.5): imagine if the real Eurovision songs bopped this hard

**boogiepanda** (8.2): Not a fan of the semi-shouting parts but otherwise good track

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): Absolutely love the production on this. It’s just a simple, yet breezy and fun song.

**awryj** (8): shes like tove lo but without the parental guidance notice

**enecks** (8): a nudist anthem

**followingfreeways** (8): never heard this and man is it a BOP

**rocketgamer31** (8): Cute bop, probably never would have discovered it without popheads

**WilsonJason** (8): me too

**jhxcb** (7.7): Good, but I feel like it missed an opportunity for a great chorus.

**axestogrind** (7.5): Dagny belongs in a category of 'white indie girls that I see a lot of rave about on popheads but the music doesn't click with me'. She has undeniably good pop songs but none that really stand out. Other artists in this category include: Luna Shadows, Elohim, Purity Ring, CHVRCHES, the XX.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7.5): A low key cute bop

**Albert\_Cole** (7.3): I have never heard this song before, and yet somehow it feels like I've already heard it. This sounds like a song Max Martin wrote just to see if he could write a boring song.

**banananaise** (7): this sounds like the kind of song that would have an ad on spotify which is just a clip of the song and the artist saying "please listen to my new single" over the top

**cadastre** (7): Thoroughly average.

**quaerex** (7): I’m a sucker for European accents, not the “mmm” in the chorus though.

**SkyBlade79** (7): reminds me of MO. Quite the bop

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i'm going to sing this to the next guy i decide to date

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Not much to say about this track, but it's solid indie pop.

**VodkaInsipido** (7): Eh

**wailordfan** (7): This just feels like a solid pop song? Nothing feels out of this world or special with the song, and could just be brushed off as an album track and I’d believe you. The best part of the song is the bass in the chorus, but I am leaving the song feeling very whelmed.

**eklxtreme** (6.5): the song has great production and builds up really nicely but it kinda falls flat with the chorus.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): Playlist filler

**OxfordSemicolon** (6.5): When I think generic mid-2010s pop song, this is what I get.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): https://i.imgur.com/aBWVo4u.gif

**stansymash** (6): i looked away for 5 seconds and forgot this song existed

**deadspiderwall** (5): put something on

**letsallpoo** (5): Not even the smoothest drop in the world can't stop this from sounding a lil derivative.

**nooodisaster** (5): Slightly better than average

**shineflyer** (5): Idk, I don't really get what people see in this one. The guitar part's nice.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): YouTube-core in the worst possible way.

**topesmachine** (4): this sounds like every song released in 2011

**Elitefourbrad** (3): Meh, this song could really just need better production

**TheTimidMartian** (3): completely unremarkable. weak vocals.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): isn't it

**joshually** (2): Who is Dagny? Don't answer that - I don't care

Mariah came through with a very catchy, danceable, hip-hop inspired 90s bop here. Her voice sounds angelic like always, the piano keys glide over the drums effortlessly, it's just composed very well and a great song all around.

---
**GlialUreterostenosis** (11): Holy crap that piano line instantly sent me back 20 years

**kanyewestrep** (11): Be sure to check out the remix featuring Mase and The Lox

**omgcow** (11): Everyone's probably making semen jokes so I will not!

**TheTimidMartian** (11): stan my queen. honestly, the vocals are flawless in their effectiveness as well as their technique; belting ability and vocal technique in this song surpasses every other song on the rate by a far margin.

**agentofscranton** (10): a jizz anthem - when will [artist who also sang about jizz]?

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): isn't it

**calltehshots** (10): this disgusting cum anthem set to a fun hip hop and beautiful mariah vocals, what more do you truly need?

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented cum

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Mariah, queen of cumshots.

**grxmes** (10): GIVE MARIAH HER TEA

**MaydayPVZ** (10): The only number 1 debut in this list

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Now what we going to do right here… We going to smooth it out… Peak R&B Mimi. The production? Wig. The vocal layering? Wig. The samples? Wig. And most importantly… it’s a mf bop.

**saucymac** (10): this song is summer and iconic Mariah

**skargardin** (10): Just an excellent, smooth, sexy R&B jam.

**triptoyourheart** (10): When will CupcakKe create an anthem about semen as godly as this?

**joshually** (9): As far as Mariah's one-word-title lead-single streak of the 90s are concerned, this is in second-to-last place for me. For those who care, the order is: Dreamlover, Fantasy, Heartbreaker, Emotions, Honey, Loverboy.

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): 1990s Mariah Carey + hip hop-inflected production = classic hit.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Skinny legend absolutely snapped.

**twat\_brained** (9): Before listening: "Mariah Carey is overrated, her biggest hit is only played one month out of the year. This won't be all that and a bag of chips." After listening: Mariah is skinny, fuck blue lives. Honestly, my biggest gripe with the song is the weird synth track that plays in the verses. Apart from that the song is great.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.9): that piano riff is gorgeous by taylor swift now available on itoons

**MissyBee37** (8.5): That beat!! Mariah will forever be a legend.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Giving me serious late 90s/early 2000s R&B nostalgia vibes. The song has a great funky groove and some great vocals from Mariah that range from breathy and airy to the belting chorus, and she nails all of it.

**zamomattel** (8.5): oooooohhhhh honey. But like what a bop

**sletrab07** (8.2): According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Can you believe this is happening? I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. You got lint on your fuzz. Ow! That's me! Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! Hey, Adam. Hey, Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive. You did come back different. Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You going to the funeral? No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances. Well, Adam, today we are men. We are! Bee-men. Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15. That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick our job today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. Wonder what it'll be like? A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! That girl was hot. She's my cousin! She is? Yes, we're all cousins. Right. You're right. At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. What do you think he makes? Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. What does that do? Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Can anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): This sounds so 90s, I love it

**eklxtreme** (8): mariah is definitely one of the great parts of this song but only cus of her smooth harmonies. she has better vocal performances in general. production on point!

**rocketgamer31** (8): Those vocals tho

**awryj** (7.8): the true queen bee

**quaerex** (7.5): Mariah, queen of not-subtlety, provides a song that’s just barely coded enough for radio.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.2): Too sticky

**axestogrind** (7): As someone who cannot get into Mariah's music at all, this was enjoyable. Metaphorical semen queen.

**therokinrolla** (7): stilllll dont really understand the hype for mariah

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): this is background music at best.

**stansymash** (6.3): mariah carey makes me sleepy :)

**kappyko** (6): This song moves as slowly and as viscously as its namesake, as Mariah croons about wanting nut on her face

**nooodisaster** (6): If it's not The Roof, huh, I ain't interested! (but srsly this is so average, and overlong at that)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Not one of my favorite Mariah tracks, the instrumental didn't age well, and the chorus is too quiet for my tastes.

**wailordfan** (6): Let’s just run every note over the entire 5 minute song and moan a bit and do some soft bass and call it a great song.

**fourchip** (5.5): i have an older gay friend who told me to give this my 11 but i don’t see the appeal in this dusty, ancient ass track. next

**carliescion** (5): Mariahs music is way too smooth and lifeless to give me anything

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I’m just not a fan of of Mariah’s whispering singing. She’s so much better when she actually uses her voice and belts rather than trying to sound like Selena Gomez. Also this song was not meant for headphones, as it’s super annoying hearing a shaker in only right headphone all the time.

**shineflyer** (5): that bass thing is cool, but songs like this really don't need to be five minutes when they really only offer enough material for three minutes

**jhxcb** (4.1): I did not like this.

**topesmachine** (4): love Mimi but this song is kind of a mess

**AFlyingWhale\_** (3): i'm not feeling the skinny magic sorry

**WilsonJason** (3): one of the most overrated artists of all time

**dirdbub** (2): I’m dying right now at this point in the rate and all this is reminding me of is the fucking Berenstein Bears and fukcign ls=pelling that shit

You know, as a straight guy, I just don't really get this song like the gays on here. I entirely understand its appeal though: the catchy melodies, the memorable self-aware lyrics, and the overall sassy, IDGAF attitude of the track. It's a Disney all-star, and for good reason.

---
**calltehshots** (10): aly & slayj had their foots on the other disney girl's necks with this pop-rock masterpiece. potential winning song? :eyes:

**deadspiderwall** (10): still have my cd from middle school, good times :)

**dirdbub** (10): **THEY'RE LESBIANS, HAROLD**

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This is such an earworm.

**gannade** (10): "I want my first place back. Did you hear that? I want my DESERVED first place in this rate!" - Aly & AJ, as they witness themselves losing this rate to a less talented Disney/nick star

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking WIG! the 2 queens of disney really did that!

**kappyko** (10): i was gonna give this a lower score but tbh no aly & aj truly did it. i wanna make out to this

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): this is honestly peak music

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I mean, just a fantastic song.

**omgcow** (10): An absolute legend and I remember LIVING for this when it came on Disney Channel.

**Raykel** (10): Bad autotune sometimes, will be completely dated eventually, a bop always.

**rickikardashian** (10): _”As a straight man, I just don’t get it”_ Hammer about this song

**strawberryswing1** (10): I can't beleive this song did so poorly in the original rate, it's incredible

**VodkaInsipido** (10): #I Gave This A 2 In The Original Rate But I Have Decided To Redeem Myself And Get The Hype Behind This Song

**jhxcb** (9.7): This is true pop-rock.

**axestogrind** (9.5): One of the best things to come out of Hollywood Records. Witty meta lyrics, catchy hooks, fun 2000s production, it's just kinda all around great. STREAM TEN YEARS ON YOUR PREFERRED STREAMING PLATFORM.

**zamomattel** (9.5): whatever beat this. Did not deserve to I can tell you that

**twat\_brained** (9.2): When I first rated this, I gave it a 10, blinded by childhood nostalgia. Listening to this again, I realize now that it's excellent, but it's not **perfect**. I only wanna give 10s to perfect songs.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): A CERTIFIED BOP. This song makes me want to smash my non-existent ex’s things and slam the door in the their face.

**poppinmmolly** (9): a bop

**rocketgamer31** (9): Oh my god this was my childhood, you better believe I screamed along to these lyrics despite not even going through a breakup

**awryj** (8.5): I'm not a fan of the chorus. It feels kind of weak compared to the rest of the song (which is pop perfection btw)

**Albert\_Cole** (8): The musical style of this reminds me of 3OH!3 for some reason and I feel terrible for saying that

**enecks** (8): A funky and energetic song that is too good to come out of the soulless vending machine of Disney.

**stansymash** (8): wasn't aj and ally a disney channel show about that blonde white boy and some girl with faux anxiety

**swankyhoodrat** (8): This song is so dated and yet it’s so fun I don’t care??? The same feeling The Fame gives me tbh.

**topesmachine** (8): this song is still so memorable all these years later even though aly and aj couldn't be more irrelevant

**blue\_heart\_** (7.5): With all the hype this gets, it kind of... whelmed me.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): this song is so energetic and catchy, especially the chorus.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): kinda dated

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Pokemon Theme Song remix is shook.

**LandonKidatrea** (7): In grade school my teachers used to make us write poems about different topics, and sometimes I would write a line but afterwards realize it's like one or two syllables off so instead of rewriting it I just throw in some filler words to make it fit the meter. This song is written like that.

**nooodisaster** (7): I live for the cheap green screen cover of this album. Teen Wolf WISHES.

**shineflyer** (7): So corny, and it has cheap, plastic production, but also such a bop? I love the subtle ska guitar on the chorus.

**TheTimidMartian** (7): simple and memorable prechorus and chorus makes up for the poorly aged production, bad verses, and bad vocals. falsetto flips in chorus are nicely and cleanly sung.

**banananaise** (6.5): at first i gave this a 5 because i'm sick of the 2000s pop-rock sound, but after i listened to it again, i like that it's a bit synthpop in a way that reminds me of Little Boots, and the castanet bit is kinda fun. wish it had more of those aspects and less of the guitar.

**quaerex** (6.5): The dripping anger in her voice makes this song good but the rest is sort of forgettable.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): this isn't bad but like it's also not good? it suffers from being just there.

**joshually** (6): I feel like they're trying to sound like a knock-off Ke$ha

**wailordfan** (6): I don't get it. The production and lyrics don't fit for at least half of the song, I didn't rate the song when it was in its own rate, but I honestly don't think this is that good, and honestly hope it is out day 1.

**grxmes** (5.6): Overrated disney song

**therokinrolla** (5.5): several rates later and i still dont see the hype :'(

**Kaylaboe** (5): meh vocals

**SkyBlade79** (5): the autotuned is kind of meh

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): The autotuned parts are honestly pretty grating to me, they're super unnecessary and really drag the quality down. The parts with no autotune are a noticeable improvement, but I don't think the song really goes beyond typical mid 2000s pop-rock. There's a decent groove to it, so I get why so many love it.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): i highkey never got the hype tbh

**sasuke-lp** (4): generic as hell

**sletrab07** (4): This sounds like a Eurovision reject. Can we Definitely Breakup, Song?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I didn't like this song at all in the Disney rate, and nothing changed. It's got a grating instrumental, which sounds pretty dated. It's all over the place and I really don't vibe with this.

**carliescion** (3): What is this electronic, distorted voice-pop mess?

**JMez2612** (2.5): Upon multiple listens to try and find out why this is Aly & AJ's biggest song, I could not find anything, Like Woah outsold (and aged better).

**JustinJSrisuk** (2): Who are these people? The production sounds so cheap.

**triptoyourheart** (1): Why is this sub obsessed with this song? I don’t get it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): holy fucking hell how do people enjoy this it's so aggressively bad.

THIS IS COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHIT. YOU **PEONS** DISGUST ME. Kanye is my favorite artist ever, and this is one of my favorite songs by him. The production is breathtaking, Ty Dolla $ign adds a smooth, tender layer as the feature, and Kanye raps some of his most personal, real lyrics of his career. TLOP was a mixed bag, but this was his most polished, well-thought out track from that era: it's really something special. I hate you all.

---
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): One of Kanye's most personal and emotional tracks. While the problems Kanye talks about are fairly specific to his situation, he does something he does very well and makes them still relatable. The themes of growing distant from the people close to you are something many of us deal with, and Kanye tells it so well. You really feel his sadness in a way Kanye hasn't conveyed this well since 808s, and like 808s the raw emotion and personal struggle that contrasts Kanye's typical persona on tracks is what really makes the song work. The production is minimal, but it sets the right mood for the song. Just an amazing song.

**axestogrind** (10): Certified wavy or whatever the straight Ye fans say.

**calltehshots** (10): introspective yeezy at his best

**Raykel** (10): The instrumentals sound like they're crying wow

**skargardin** (10): This song is so real and damn, it hits you smack-hard right in the face. There’s so much frustration and anger in Kanye’s delivery. I dunno, it really gets me thinking. Outstanding song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): An absolute life changing honest rap track that's a serious breath of fresh air. From the light production to the introspective lyrics, it's one of the best offerings on Kanye's TLOP, and one of his best songs, period.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): technically a rate winner since Ultralight Beam is basically otherworldly. Fr tho Kanye snapped!

**VodkaInsipido** (10): As Katy Perry Once Said, Don’t Be Afraid To Catch F e e l s

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): don’t need no fake friends, might as well shut down 😤

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): TLOP is kind of a toss-up of an album, but this track gives that reflective trait that I love most about Kanye’s music.

**zamomattel** (9.5): camila cabello literally could never. Kanye outsold and outskinnied

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): why is this so sad

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): what an amazing song……. the beat is nice… ty $ feature is great… hanh

**eklxtreme** (9): One of the most chilling, cold productions I've heard from kanye, with great personal lyricism all around.

**enecks** (9): I'm going to be blunt - No More Parties in LA should've been picked for this rate instead. Still - good beat, good lyrics, too relatable. I don't have real friends I just have a mess.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): Oh hey I just got that line from TIWWCHNT

**rocketgamer31** (9): This is good, maybe I should check this album out

**topesmachine** (9): a really underrated Kanye song tbh

**stansymash** (8.7): kanye west is so good and worth my time

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Pretty relaxing to listen to but it's no Camila Cabello

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): The most relatable part of the song is when Kanye yell's out "Trust Issues!"

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): Really like the production in this song, but also like the lyrics and how Kanye grappling with who his real friends are. One of his best songs lyrically as of recently.

**cadastre** (8): I wish this and No More Parties had been a single track

**Elitefourbrad** (8): kayne is a god and a daddy

**JMez2612** (8): I wasn't expecting to like this, but color me impressed, Camila is SHAKING

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): it’s fine

**quaerex** (8): Kanye’s best songs are his most personal ones, this is no exception.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.9): One of my favorite songs off of Pablo, I’ll always have a soft spot for Ty Dolla $ign.

**jhxcb** (7.7): Not my style, but I can definitely appreciate the backing track and he's got pretty good rhythm.

**MissyBee37** (7): These lyrics are strikingly honest (in a good way).

**strawberryswing1** (7): Has iconic lines but not an amazing song on its own tbh

**TheTimidMartian** (7): production is pretty good. lyrics are exceptionally thoughtful as is typical of kanye. feature sucks though

**Albert\_Cole** (6.7): Camila did it better sorry

**nooodisaster** (6): Definitely popularized "real friends; how many of us?" into my friends lexicon, but feels like it drags at only 4 minutes. The cousin laptop line is iconic tho.

**shineflyer** (6): Like a regular generic rap track, but it's Kanye, so it can't be THAT generic.

**wailordfan** (6): For an album that I praise for its production play and experimentation, this song just feels so vanilla, and doesn’t feel like it should’ve been the song chosen to represent Kanye as an artist.

**carliescion** (5): Life of Pablo Kanye is Worst Kanye

**saucymac** (5): Kanye Swift coming in with those spite lyrics

**rickikardashian** (4): Buy Camila on Itunes

**omgcow** (3): Real friends.... i have none

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.4): this goes nowhere

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): isn't it

**joshually** (2): As far as Kanye songs go, this is not really that good

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): camila outpeaked

**SkyBlade79** (2): most overrated Kanye song

**kappyko** (0): this is part of the most overrated stretch on TLOP for me :( this is weirdly a slog and i just really don't want this to get anywhere. this kind of ":'( rap" from him doesn't resonate when it's surrounded by a beat that feels as lifeless as this. i've espoused my dislike of the "Real Friends"/"FML"/"Wolves" trio before, and i will now. if i wanted to listen to sad Kanye i'd listen to 808s or "Guilt Trip" or "Runaway"

More Europop for your head top? This thing is so funky man, the lil bouncy synths are so nice on the ears, and her French (?) vocals are smooth like silk. Very lovely tune.

---
**agentofscranton** (10): i'm already prepared for this song to get done wrong in this rate which sucks because it's honestly such a bop

**awryj** (10): Cornpletement fou

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): comment dit-on "banger"

**enecks** (10): A cheeky bit of pop mastery that would tear up the charts if the US would give it a chance.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ok I don't have a joke for this french song and I'm sorry if my previous jokes about the french have offended anyone, I hope you know that was not my intent and I will promise to become a better person in the future.

**kappyko** (10): you're a "complete fool" if you don't like this haha i'll be here all day folks x. (on a serious note, this is a great way to end the rate bc of the fact this is the greatest outro of all time)

**Kaylaboe** (10): this is just completely crazy and i adore it. the last minute could revive the dead

**Leixander** (10): CORN

**Mudkip1** (10): wow a bop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Issa bop.

**skargardin** (10): French is such a beautiful language, plus the production on this one absolutely slaps.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): stromae can choke on yelle's corn sorry

**twat\_brained** (10): Je ne sais rien de Yelle sauf que trois chansons, "A cause des garçons", particulièrement de mon expérience avec *UEFA EURO 2008* sur le PS2, "Je veux te voir", puis "Que veux-tu?" parce que mon sœur a joué le rémix du Madeon tous les temps. Sur la sujet d'elle, "Complètement Fou" est une fabuleuse réintroduction à sa musique, puis je hâte à découvrir son placement dans les tableaux. Yes, I do speak French. Albeit not as well as I'd like.

**axestogrind** (9.5): I fucking love Yelle

**eklxtreme** (9.5): it sounds so fucking fresh. I love the sound of European pop.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): Je parle un peu de francais donc je comprends qu'elle est amoureuse (bien sûr, c'est déja clair, étant donné que c'est un chanson que /r/popheads écoute). Néanmoins, je ne comprends pas les interjections pendant les versets (avec, je pense, un bébé?)

**nbapip** (9): ok i've never heard this but it's a lot of fun

**shineflyer** (9): That synth tone is always enjoyable. And the piano's great, too.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Another foreign song I haven't rated, but my god is this a bop.

**topesmachine** (9): not my favorite yelle song but it still bops

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I knew that flu meant crazy is French beforehand from the times I suffered through French class during school, and completement means completely so at that

**SkyBlade79** (8.5): actually a bop, memes aside. Queen of corn

**swankyhoodrat** (8.5): Goes off but is also is nothing new.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): yas i can’t understand the words but i live!

**JMez2612** (8): I heard the piano and instantly knew this song would SMACK

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): i can’t understand shit, pt.3

**fourchip** (7.5): this is actually super good i usually don’t like songs in other languages

**carliescion** (7): This song is catchy as hell

**stansymash** (7): i am gonna throw up ive heard so much pop music today

**triptoyourheart** (7): I like the production.

**jhxcb** (6.9): It's fun, but it seems kind of repetitive, and some of the vocals are really lacking.

**quaerex** (6.5): The man talking in the chorus throws this entire song off.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): isn't it

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): I was feeling this but the ending sounds so dated (which would be okay if the song was older but it’s from 2014) I can’t get into it

**rocketgamer31** (6): It's okay I guess

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): justice for Christine!!!

**zamomattel** (5.5): the production is really nice but the content is lacking

**nooodisaster** (5): got bored after the first two minutes

**WilsonJason** (5): idk i dont really do songs in non-english

**TheTimidMartian** (3): overreliance on production. the vocals are weak and add little.

**joshually** (2): I feel like I don't have to be Franch to determine that this song sucks.

The most controversial song in this rate for good reason. Vroom Vroom is an abrasive, loud, cocky banger with so many memes attached to it. Despite its very polarizing opinions (or maybe because of it), this song is etched into this subreddit's lore forever, no matter what position is ends up in.

---
**chipsi1** (11): wow i can't believe charli was ghostwriting for Kendrick this entire time

**stansymash** (11): the opening verse is the greatest rap verse of all time. the chorus is the greatest chorus of all time. the singing is the best singing of all time. the production is the greatest production of all time. I am a willing bitch who cannot catch Charli because she is simply too cute, sexy and her ride is too sporty. i am nothing in the face of the lavender lambourghini. ride all u want charli, you have done enough good to last a lifetime. we are the bitches.

**topesmachine** (11): yeah i'm a Charli stan but this is the song/video of the millennium

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): [FRESH] vroom vroom made me care about the boom clap girl and the EP is her best release ever. could have been my 11.

**calltehshots** (10): beep beep so let's ride

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): B E E P B E E P

**dirdbub** (10): Cold. Dark. Dreary. Cornered in the back of an alley, the days of innocence were over. There's no way I could get out of this alive. I've been evading them for hours, running, running, running until I couldn't feel my legs. Fumbling around in my jacket, I pull out the gun that's saved me times before. I looked up, only to see a sinister, bright white smile looming over me, letting their shadow consume my soul. "What the fuck do you want from me?" I screamed, trembling while failing to hold the gun steady to their face. With a smile that only grew larger, it began to laugh. Who the hell is this lady? I tremble, watching as the mouth widened, scared for my life but couldn't look away. As I was cornered, paralyzed, almost swallowed whole, I screamed, "Why? Why do you do this?" It pulled away. Thinking I was free, I tried to run but couldn't. I just stared, watching as the smile grew wider and wider and wider. The crooked teeth began to laugh, and started to speak. "Beep beep," it said, "let's ride." I screamed, as it laughed while consuming my body whole in one swift bite.

**enecks** (10): The Vroom Vroom EP marks a moment in pop history in which two rising forces - Charli XCX and PC Music - collided and peaked in a spectacle of vantablack suits and industrial bubblegum. While this title track isn't the peak of that project (it isn't the indescribable Nightcore genius of Paradise, which might be one of the best songs ever composed), it's still a damn good slice of pop and is undoubtedly [FRESH]

**grxmes** (10): LET'S RIDE

**Leixander** (10): LET'S RIDE

**Mudkip1** (10): wow a bop

**omgcow** (10): Took a while to grow on me but now I'll never get off Charli's wild ride

**PuggleMaster** (10): This would get my 11 if my queen wasn't in this rate

**rocketgamer31** (10): BEEP BEEP. I've always liked what I've heard from Charli before this EP, so I'm not gonna lie I was like wtf when I first heard this. But, it's completely re[fresh]ing and brought Charli back on the map for me. Now I'm a filthy stan. LET'S RIDE

**skargardin** (10): Yes it’s meme-y but of the good kind. The production is an absolute banger and it’s not really meant to be taken in a serious manner. It really feels like a wild ride from start to finish. There are so many elements that are just utterly ridiculous but it’s just so much fun!

**SkyBlade79** (10): always an iconic song, one of the best songs to get pumped ever. Shame on the people who don’t like it tbh

**suspicious\_padding** (10): YAAS CHARLI DID THAT,MY WIG IS GONE,PUSSY THROBBING etc.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): I was GAGGED when I heard this for the first time. This really marked the beginning of her experimental pop viewpoint. It’s just as good as TR but so different at the same time. LET’S RIDE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Another day, another Charli track robbed. The EP rate was brimming with competition (okay honestly in my opinion not really but I'm not the only person doing rates am I), and in the end this [FRESH] track failed to nab the win. I've already ranted about this track endlessly so I'll keep this short. Vroom Vroom is a once in a lifetime bop, dissonant and abrasive yet so scarily catchy. SOPHIE and Charli XCX struck gold here, and while I think a lot of their later collabs resulted in hits, this is still the best thing they've ever done. It's provocative, it's violent, and it's unique, even a few years after it made its live debut.

**theburningundead** (10): I know this song is very polarising but I love how insane and unpredictable it is, I wish I could go back and experience listening to it for the first time again. B E E P B E E P L E T ' S R I D E

**VodkaInsipido** (10): The Change From The Past Song (You (Ha Ha Ha)) To This Song Was So Sudden For A Moment I Thought 'What The Fuck What Is Vroom Vroom Doing Here, Did Charli Update You (Ha Ha Ha) A La Kanye To Add Vroom Vroom As A Second Part Of The Song?' Still A Great Song And An 11 Contender

**zamomattel** (10): lets ride my wig like a magic carpet

**kappyko** (9.8): If my [FRESH] Charli XCX - Vroom Vroom 🚗🎵 and my girl😍👰 both drowning😱🌊 and I could only save one😤😬 Catch me looking super cute and freaky at my girls funeral😔👻🌹 Because my girl wanted to ride 🚘💯🔥😎🚨🏎️

**blue\_heart\_** (9.6): kachow

**eklxtreme** (9.5): the production post-chorus production still blows my mind. pc music makes the wildest bops.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I’m not the biggest PC music fan but I really love this song. The production works really well with the lyrics and Charli’s singing/rapping.

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): i aspire to buy a lavender lambo one day

**wailordfan** (9.5): Ok this song is peak Charli. She won't do better than this song ever again. Perfect production, and lack of auto-tuned voice? Yes please, sign me the FUCK up.

**fourchip** (9.2): dose slugz no dey cnt cach mi

**boogiepanda** (9): lmao only just realised the lyrics are 'those thugs can't catch me' not 'those socks can't catch me'

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): The twinkling synths over that violent kickdrum make this track a slut-drop for the ages.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): INB4 every comment is LET’S RIDE.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I really like this song as pump up music.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): [FRESH] Charli XCX - Vroom Vroom VROOM VROOM BEEP BEEP LET'S RIDE LET'S RIDE BTICHES KNOW U CAN'T CATCH ME

**cyborglilith** (8): makes me feel like a badass

**deadspiderwall** (8): ok this is great

**OxfordSemicolon** (6.5): Brits, don't rap.

**jhxcb** (6.1): Seems more like a bad mashup than it does a song. Each individual part is good, though.

**mustangs16** (6): i mean...it's better than the other charli song in this rate?

**shineflyer** (6): This is really enjoyable trash. It still is trash, though. But whatever, have fun ya raccoons.

**LuckyKidA** (5.8): This sounds like a Y E E Z U S outtake.

**quaerex** (5.5): Somehow talk-rapping sounds so much better in a British accent. The chorus is a little high for my liking, though.

**borpo** (5): The chorus deserves better than the verses

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): this… is not… good

**DraculaWeekend** (5): I'm sorry but I don't get the hype for Charli at all.

I get that she was trying to do the k-pop thing where there's a different hook every 20 seconds, but the problem is that near no one is gonna like every part of the song equally.

**Albert\_Cole** (4): No

**carliescion** (4): The production isn't as annoying as You but Charli should never rap

**rickikardashian** (3.5): this is at least 4 different songs badly stitched together into this mess. There’s like 4 sections, and just when i’m starting to get into the mood of one of those, they change it to another different part. Y’all hated LWYMMD for its antichorus but apparently this is a popheads fave? mess

**TheTimidMartian** (3.5): she cannot rap for her life; this comes across as a limp white girl take on edgier music, much like uffie

**joshually** (3): I just feel like this song could've offered more, but chose not to, like a Sizzler's that had flooded, so they had to close most of the buffet stations, and so you weren't given much choice 

**letsallpoo** (3): The transition from You (Ha Ha Ha) to this is one of the most depressing things I've witnessed

**twat\_brained** (3): Let's be honest, this song is only in the rate because memes. It's a fun guilty pleasure song but I feel like if you're not in on the joke it just sounds really weird. +1 for the Fernando Alonso shoutout though.

**sasuke-lp** (2): everything in this song sounds like crap to me except the pre-chorus

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): why can't we give more 0s, this is trash. It’s a confusing mess. I honestly don’t get the circlejerk. It sounds like 3 songs all together under 3 minutes and 13 seconds.

**NapsAndNetflix** (1): [fresh]

**WilsonJason** (1): beep beep

**agentofscranton** (0): i think i've just come to terms with the fact that i'm just not gonna get this song, and i never will

Another emo anthem. Who doesn't know this song by heart! It's so catchy and memorable, everything about it is just iconic for its genre. Damn shame that Brendon Urie got sick of performing it, it's one of their best songs!

---
**nbapip** (11): my 14 year old self would never forgive me for any other score

**Elitefourbrad** (10): SHUT THE GOD DAMN DOOR

**gannade** (10): A classic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): If you don’t know the lyrics to this song, leave this sub and NEVER COME BACK (Gollum voice)! jk but honestly this is such a memorable song and it’s so fun to sing along to. Brendon Urie has such a great voice and makes it so playful.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): probably the best song we voted to put into this rate!

**Leixander** (10): POIIISEEEE ANDDDD RATIONALITEEEEYYYYYYYYYYY

**mustangs16** (10): no lie: the first song i listened to in 2018. thanks, radio!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Should’ve won the rate. But you emo dorks kept creaming yourself over a g-note.

**omgcow** (10): I remember I saw this music video for the first time on VH1 at like 4 in the morning when i was up with the flu, then I fell asleep, and when I woke up I was still so deliriously sick that I couldn't tell if the video was real or just something I imagined in a feverish haze.

**shineflyer** (10): The intrumental is so fun - glockenspiel, pizzicato strings, and cello that suddenly disappear for a smash of a pop-punk chorus. It ends with a dissonant chord, which is such a nice thing to hear in a genre that can sometimes be unoriginal. And these harmonies are golden, Brendon Urie is honestly one of my vocal goals.

**skargardin** (10): This is GOAT Panic! and that’s a fact.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): if this song didn’t turn you emo in 2006 then dnt talk to me

**twat\_brained** (10): The strings, the xylophone, the sound which perfectly encapsulates the mid-'00s rock zeitgeist + the fact that Brendon was only 18 at the time of recording, not to mention all the memes of this song = one of the best songs of the rate. Also, have this shitpost: https://vine.co/v/eYrbgj7nP2r/

**jhxcb** (9.9): I can't help it. This song is a masterpiece.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9.5): actually iconic… used to think this was by Fall Out Boy

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I like to pretend this has the never-ending success of Mr. Brightside.

**quaerex** (9): Brendon is great because of his ability to emote. This song is no exception. The barely concealed disgust when he sings “whore” makes you think he’d be great on Broadway. I love the complexity of the story in the lyrics, as well.

**swankyhoodrat** (9): Panic!’s first album had such a unique sound. I had never heard anything like this song when I first heard it in 6th grade, and I still haven’t heard anything comparable since.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Nothing like hearing this in rural American radio where they censor the word "goddamn".

**WilsonJason** (9): close the goddamn door mum

**kappyko** (8.9): what a shame the poor groom's bride is a thotty am i right fellas this isn't funny im sorry

**topesmachine** (8.7): not my favorite P!ATD song but this album made me gay and i'm so thankful

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): oh goodness. This takes me back to high school.

**calltehshots** (8): the most popular song but i always thought it was a little overrated. fun when it comes on at a party tho.

**carliescion** (8): My inner emo loves this song

**DraculaWeekend** (8): I was a massive P!ATD fan in high school. I remember hearing them on Myspace for the first time and realizing I just found a new favorite band. This song is iconic (although not my fave), and this album is still their best one.

**rocketgamer31** (8): My inner emo kid is pleased

**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): Well it's not their best song, so it's a shame this is the only big one

**fourchip** (7.5): what a beautiful wedding! slut shaming is not ok tho brendon so unfortunately i’m gonna bring that score down

**LuckyKidA** (7.5): I don't really like P!ATD but this song is pretty ICONIC.

**zamomattel** (7.5): I like this more than I thought I would but prefer death of a bachelor <3

**stansymash** (7.2): this is better than fall out boy but the vocals sound a bit too round like a boring sphere

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): isn't it

**enecks** (7): smh

**grxmes** (7): Overrated, even Brendon's tired of it

**nooodisaster** (7): Iconic, but pretty repetitive.

**over9000skeletons** (7): for being iconic but its legit the same melody for the whole song wtf

**sletrab07** (6.8): But It's Better If You Do is better tbh.

**sasuke-lp** (6.5): Not a fan of this band but this song is not bad

**eklxtreme** (6): i like this song and it’s so quotable, but i’ve never loved it so unfortunately i won’t be scoring this high.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): i thought this was Fall Out Boy

**therokinrolla** (6): this song is a sin

**axestogrind** (5.5): This is what 'rawr means I love you in dinosaur xD' would sound like if it was a song

**AFlyingWhale\_** (5): poor lonely brendon

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): One of the better songs on an album I didn't care for at all. I never thought I would be praising Fall Out Boy but their highs are way higher than Panic's.

**chipsi1** (4): well this is both a sin and a tragedy so i guess you do write both

**static\_int\_husp** (4): I think I got tired of this song about the second time I ever heard it...

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): meeehhhh

**Raykel** (3): I don't see what's special about this. It's not catchy, in fact it sounds off and mixed poorly. I'll just never understand why it drives people emo.

**VodkaInsipido** (3): Sorry I Hate Emo

**joshually** (2): This song drains my insides, makes me feel empty and leaves me in a state of apathy.

**TheTimidMartian** (2): the introductory production (the pizzicato strings) sound like it was taken from ad. lyrics are horrible and thoughtless, and the vocals are not very strong

**suspicious\_padding** (1.3): LMAOOOOOO

This song absolutely NAILS what Lana was going for sonically on Born to Die. The 50s inspired baroque pop string sections mixed with some hip hop, and some sing rapping by Lana, matched with her sultry voice, amazing song.

---
**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): another potential 11!! one of lana's icon songs imo, it just says so much about her artistry. people would recommend this song for anyone wanting to get into lana, and i'm so thankful for that. she hooked me in.

**axestogrind** (10): Classic Lana song that literally invented Ms. Bald Bitch

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): a bop, I know the monologue by heart. This is so good omg i’m crying this is so good we don’t deserve this, humanity doesn’t deserve this, this is too good for us.

**deadspiderwall** (10): QUEEN LANA

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I picked this song to be in the rate. :janet:

**Elitefourbrad** (10): this really should be our national anthem!

**MaydayPVZ** (10): Born to Die is my favorite album of all time and this is one of the best tracks

**omgcow** (10): This is my favorite Lana song and the first one I ever heard from her, I love it

**skargardin** (10): Lana captured the old Hollywood/America romance vibe perfectly on this one. I can’t really explain why I guess it comes down to the lyrics and just the production in some sense.

**SkyBlade79** (10): Definitely some of Lana’s best work, along with Born to Die. One of the few songs where a choir chorus actually works. It’s so cynical but it works. Kiss kiss!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): Lana says Money is the anthem of success, therefore you should give Poppy your 11s if you want to be successful in life

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): My favorite Lana song. It has a pretty melancholy and epic feel that really builds and stays throughout the song, and I just love the hook.

**therokinrolla** (10): the chorus and bridge to this song is incredibly euphoric and Lana shines here. Hope it gets retribution from its robbery in the original rate

**twat\_brained** (10): This song ranks right up there in Lana's discography along with "Lust For Life" and "West Coast".

**VodkaInsipido** (10): First Contact I Had With Lana (And A$AP Rocky): Watching This On MTV At 7AM In A Summer Morning When I Was 12. Queen.

**wailordfan** (10): this started around an 8, but damn the bridge hit me hard, this is so good and so well written and the delivery, fuck me up a bit sis.

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): The REAL American anthem

**calltehshots** (9): should be our actual national anthem but america doesnt deserve it tbh

**chipsi1** (9): wow the real american national anthem is actually great

**zamomattel** (9): lana’s best song that isn’t on the great Gatsby soundtrack

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Wait since when is Lana Del Rey a rapper?

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8.5): Melania could NEVER

**quaerex** (8.5): Lana makes singing about sex and money sound patriotic, which sounds weird until you remember what America was founded on.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): queen (video games is better tho).

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): this has grown on me but it's still overrated in her discography (BTD in general is overrated)

**dirdbub** (8): I pledge allegiance to the flag of the- just kidding holy fuck lol bye bye USA

**ImADudeDuh** (8): A surprisingly good Lana song! This kinda had me shook!

**rocketgamer31** (8): Catchy bop

**Albert\_Cole** (7.9): Hey baby, are you the national anthem? Because I'm standing to attention ;-)

**topesmachine** (7.6): i have a very complicated relationship with this album but this is a good song

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): "Money is the reason we exist, everyone knows it, it's a fact, kiss kiss" Everyone dragging Witness' lyrics needs to fight the real enemy

**carliescion** (7): I overplayed this when I was 13 :/

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Honestly, as a big fan of Lana, I still can't most of BTD, but this is one of the few tracks that soars past its contemporaries, but there's still moments of lyrics mess that confuse me.

**eklxtreme** (6.5): it's a cute song but she definitely has better songs.

**Raykel** (6.5): If the chorus was more bombastic it would've been over for you bitches.

**rickikardashian** (6.5): This sounds like a song that was written by another person that hasn’t heard a Lana del Rey before and was just described what her general vibe is. _”Okay so, she’s like very chill and her music usually sounds e words or phrases that don’t rhyme or fit the melody and timing of the song it would be great. Got it?”_

**stansymash** (6.5): no lana this isn't the best you can do

**jhxcb** (6.2): I really like these lyrics, but I don't like this song.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.2): I’m a Lana fan, but this is definitely one of her more forgettable tracks.

**awryj** (6): feels unfinished

**berober04** (6): I really didn't know how to score this against the rest of the rate. I went with 6 in the end, but I still don't know if that is a fair score or not.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): Radiohead's The National Anthem >>>>

**followingfreeways** (5): don't come after me with torches but I just can't get into Lana and hate her music im sorry but also not

**kappyko** (5): I'd like to remain seated but thanks Lana

**OxfordSemicolon** (5): This is my first real exposure to Lana, and I don't like it. The whispers are terrible and the concept makes no sense - "tell me I'm your national anthem"? Like, everyone kind of knows you, but they mostly pretend to pay attention to you to be polite?

**suspicious\_padding** (4.2): Bleak

**joshually** (4): As far as boring, sad Lana songs goes, this one is probably one of the most boring and saddest ones.

**TheTimidMartian** (4): the vocals are weaker than most lana songs, as they do not capitalize on her strengths.

**WilsonJason** (4): not a fan of her voice in this one

**enecks** (3): America isn't worth "artistically" worshipping like this

**letsallpoo** (3): I've always considered this to be Lana's worst song in an otherwise strong discography. The lyrics are just so inane and poorly written. It's peak pointlessness.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): this sounds so boring.

**nooodisaster** (2): Wow, I forgot how much Lana glowed up from her first album. The intro to this is so beautiful and then... Lana raps. This is mostly either cringy or boring. Like I can't include all the examples of lines that make me want to vomit in this song.

**shineflyer** (2): why is this just an extra-vapid New Americana?

**JMez2612** (0): I never really resonated with Lana for some reason, it's whack

**LandonKidatrea** (0): residentsleeper residentsleeper residentsleeper

wanderingimpromptu3: I can't believe Tous Les Memes went out the first day. That's legitimately one of the best songs in the entire rate. Non-English songs are always at a disadvantage, but *especially* when the strength of the song is in its lyricism. 

This is a song with a verse wherein the narrator rants at length to her boyfriend about how she's leaving him ("Take one last look at my ass / It’s right next to my suitcase") only to conclude with 

> What? You wanna break up now? 

> You’ve got it all wrong 

> I was only saying that to get a reaction 

> And you were actually thinking about it!

Such a clever, cheeky song (even better in French bc these lines all rhyme). I was delighted when I first looked up the translated lyrics. (It doesn't help that a lot of the translations are bad, but this one https://genius.com/2162071 is really good)
