callmetidle: > The blatant bias against Taylor is just a bit extra don't you think?

Not really I don't think any of her songs here are really her best. Maybe All Too Well but slower songs don't tend to do too well in rates so that's not really an anti-taylor thing. 
[/r/popheads/comments/7v8ank/rate_reveal_all_stars_rate_day_3_purple/dtq99rq/]

=====

BrokenGlassSparkling: As I said on Day 2, some of the comments were clearly just biased against Taylor. The best example, which I used yesterday, was that someone said Taylor‚Äôs voice on All Too Well was monotone. You can say that you didn‚Äôt like her voice, that it was grating or something like that, but ‚Äúmonotone‚Äù can‚Äôt really be used to describe her voice there, it really seems like this commenter just wanted to give her a zero because she‚Äôs Taylor. They also said the lyrics were incredibly boring, which... I guess all lyrics are subjective but I really want to know what they think good lyrics are. Could that be an isolated incident? Yeah. But I‚Äôm pretty sure there were other people like that too. It‚Äôs fine if you give the song a chance, but this person clearly didn‚Äôt.

Beyonce's original location in the pop world was in the girl group Destiny's Child, a very sassy, sexy girl group that ruled the late 90s and early 2000s. This song is a landmark with woefully unapologetic lyrics and a timeless beat. A diva anthem if I've ever heard one.

---
**zamomattel** (11): Beyonc√© is my fave singer and kandi burruss my fave housewife (not really, Luann forever) so I fully accept this bop

**awryj** (10): the late 90s futuristic design of the mv is my aesthetic

**calltehshots** (10): cracks me up that michelle and farrah are in the video when they're not in the song. farrah said "say my name" the other girls left her on read

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): THE HARMONIES! THE BREAKDOWN! THE PRODUCTION!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song and music video are iconic.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Destiny‚Äôs Child is amazing and this song deserves ALL the 10s. Beyonce and Kelly carried this song while Michelle lipped as usual.

**JMez2612** (10): Legends only, if this isn't a 10 for you, then you need to reevaluate yourself

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Iconic.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): How can I give anything less than a 10 to a song that snatched Walter White himself?

**twat\_brained** (10): The first time I rated this, I gave it an 11. To this day, that rate was the closest I had ever come to seeing my 11 win a rate. Destiny's Child was a talented group, but what they really needed was a producer who could bring out the very best in them. Enter Darkchild. Put them together and you've got possibly the best song of 1999, which says a lot because 1999 had some SENSATIONAL music.

**kappyko** (9.5): back in the 90s R&B stood for Runescape-Music and Beyonc√©

**enecks** (9): YOUR NAME IS MITSUHA MIYAMIZU

**PenOrAPencil** (9): Fifth Harmony did a cover that did this great song justice

**rocketgamer31** (9): Still a bop, serves major nostalgia too

**shineflyer** (9): The classic acoustic guitar + strings R&B thing is always enjoyable. Maybe a bit repetitive by the end, though.

**jhxcb** (8.6): Aged surprisingly well.

**chipsi1** (8.5): beyonce

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): I literally do not care at all about Destiny's Child but this is a bop and it is by far the best Beyonc√© song in this rate.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.3): I don't think their expectation for him are exactly logical ("say my name when no-one is around you" - how do you check that then?)

**eklxtreme** (8): it has that catchy magic of 2000s pop that i absolutely adore

**joshually** (8): ProTip: Those echoes in the verses will KILL IT at karaoke!

**omgcow** (8): A classic for sure

**quaerex** (8): Great song about confronting a cheater, vocal harmonies on display. Beyonc√©‚Äôs Chi‚Äìuh, I mean, Destiny‚Äôs Child‚Äìis great for empowerment anthems.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Wtf this isn't Florence Welch and Calvin Harris

**topesmachine** (8): Beyonce really got better after DC damn

**VodkaInsipido** (8): A Great Destiny's Child Song

**wailordfan** (8): a great song, great production and the vocals all work super well together without holding onto obvious products of its times, making it much more listenable/comparable to music being released today too.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.8): iconic, 5 year old me sang this with so much atttitude even tho i'd never had a boyf who cheated on me

**stansymash** (7.5): i recognise the people on this album cover

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): isn't it

**nooodisaster** (7): First verse: Oo they gave Beyonce the first verse on the hit single, I see what they're doing. | Second verse: and the.... second one? | Third verse: wow this legit was Beyonce ft. Destiny's Child

**TheTimidMartian** (7): vocals are excellent, production is great, arrangement is dated but still good. beyonce takes cake, and everyone else takes backseat.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.8): While this song is endlessly catchy and nostalgic as hell, now that I‚Äôm listening to it, the speeded-up pre-chorus breakdown sounds kind of ridiculous and dated.

**dirdbub** (6): This is the funniest article that deals with Destiny's Child: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/a-date-with-destiny-20010524

**fourchip** (4): tove styrke did it better

**sasuke-lp** (3): not my thing at all

**SkyBlade79** (3): beyonce

**suspicious\_padding** (3): Next

**Mudkip1** (2): i only listen to scandipop wuneens like tove styrke who is destiny's child

---
The infamous #2! This song is Ellie's commercial peak and probably her artistic peak as well. The mirrored, bouncy synths couple with her raspy, pitched voice sounds wonderful, with a chorus for the ages. A great song that was sadly robbed too many times.

---
**Kaylaboe** (11): Probably the first song I really fell in love with? I first heard this back in 2011 and I was instantly drawn to it. The lyrics, melodies, vocals and synths are all perfection in this track, and this is easily Ellie‚Äôs magnum opus. Still sounds as good today as it did back then

**LandonKidatrea** (11): I joined this rate for one reason and one reason only. To give Lights my 11. I said it before and I'll say it again. Lights was robbed. It should have won.

**Leixander** (11): One of my all-time favorite songs. I have a huge connection with it, and I can feel it is going to be #2 again oops.

**shineflyer** (11): There's an underlying fear under all the synth tones going everywhere and the catchy beats of this song, a certain desperation. Ellie's vocals are as captivatingly airy as usual, and compliment the emotion behind the track.

**SkyBlade79** (11): how many times are we going to rob this song? This is, in my book, one of the best pop songs ever; it‚Äôs definitely in the top 10. It‚Äôs pop perfection in every way. It‚Äôs been like 6 years and it still sounds just as fresh.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): the first time i heard this song was in a nigahiga parody, "you turn the lights out and i turn them back on/and i'm shining like i'm a liiight" and i thought those were the actual lyrics for like six months

**agentofscranton** (10): one of the best things ellie has ever done

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): I really love this song, I had a heart then but the queen has been overthrown is one of my fave lyrics, it gives me goosebumps. Ellie should go back to making more of this shit. @ellie get your shit together plz.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): screw that carly flop jepsen girl for cockblocking this from #1

**enecks** (10): Pop perfection is something that's hard to describe. People like Max Martin have tried to quantify it into a formula - "correct" pop - but have lost what makes it good through their fingers. The whole point of pop perfection is that it's intangible genius that is hard to analyse with all but the most skilled critical outlooks. So yeah this is pop perfection and I have nothing to say about it.

**followingfreeways** (10): this rate is just trying to prove that I am pop radio trash

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Hypnotizing would be the word to describe this song. This song made me fall in love with Ellie voice and it complements the song perfectly. And it‚Äôs also a bop that you have to sing along too!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fucking BOP. This song is gonna be one of those songs that I play in the morning on my speaker throughout the house to let my children know that that day is gonna be a cleaning day and I am READY FOR IT!

**kappyko** (10): i never actually realized how cinematic this song was until recently. that bass guitar? fuck, i never actually heard that until now and it adds a whole gorgeous dimension to a song i knew i already liked. the chorus is triumphant, she sounds genuinely longing, it's catchy as fuck, and beautifully lush electropop. great work here, girl

**letsallpoo** (10): This getting 2nd is so iconic and I don't even know why tbh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love Ellie Gouldong

**Mudkip1** (10): wow a bop

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): rolling in the deep deserved

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Something, Something, deserves to win.

**nooodisaster** (10): This song will never get old, and it should go Diamond through pure iconic-ness.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): When Ellie was actually awake and not sleepwalking through albums she could SNAP

**skargardin** (10): I don‚Äôt think Ellie will ever top this dream-pop masterpiece.

**strawberryswing1** (10): deserved #1

**swankyhoodrat** (10): My first Ellie song! Go back to this type of pop queen!!!!!

**Albert\_Cole** (9.6): Ellie Goulding has stated that this song is literally about turning on lights at night. Still bangs

**axestogrind** (9.5): Everything about this song is so euphoric. It's just so clean and so meticulous. It's called a sleeper hit because everyone sleeps on it as a modern pop classic.

**berober04** (9.5): the atmosphere on this song is second to none

**PenOrAPencil** (9.5): The Bassnectar remix goes OFF

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): something something adele

**jhxcb** (9.1): Wonderful.

**MaydayPVZ** (9): I love this song but I hear it in every commercial

**rickikardashian** (9): I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever understood this song, and i doubt i ever will. I don‚Äôt think it even has a meaning, but whatever, it bops ^(also just a fair warning even tho i gave this a 9 i can say with 100% confidence, that i‚Äôll get mad when this makes it further than like a bunch of songs, bc let‚Äôs be real, this is probs making top 10)

**twat\_brained** (9): As great as this song is, it doesn't register on the same level for me as "Burn", "Figure 8", "Starry Eyed" or even "Aftertaste".

**wailordfan** (9): This is such a pure pop song, I love it. I have no complaints about it, a strong hook, great synths, only gets hurt from the vocal performance, and honestly it feels bad, but this would be a perfect 10 in all stars if she just had a bit more grit or strength behind the song. Give me the vocals of Love Me Like You Do in here and I‚Äôd love it.

**sletrab07** (8.6): This song makes me sad to listen to now, knowing what Ellie has become.

**boogiepanda** (8.5): wow a real throwback to this song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): my Trump-supporting friend really likes this song which makes sense since both Trump and this song tend to finish #2 in the popular vote.

**awryj** (8): This song is so unique, when you think about it. A midtempo electropop song from 2009-2010 that features vocal chops, a bonus track that turned out to be a sleeper hit, with lyrics about being afraid of the dark and sleep paralysis... and Blondie did a mashup of it and Atomic.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8): what a GOOD chorus !

**deadspiderwall** (8): solid pop song, you go ellie

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Almost wanted to give this a 0 just to see if my 0 prevented the song from potentially winning.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): We need new Ellie music!!

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): The sparkling synths, evocative lyrics and Ellie Goulding‚Äôs ethereal and fragile-sounding voice gives this track a rather hauntingly beautiful, almost otherworldly quality.

**OxfordSemicolon** (8): Good, but it deserved to lose Rolling in the Deep (which is an instant classic)

**quaerex** (8): Big chorus and pretty good lyrics make this a song I‚Äôll revisit in lots of Throwback Thursday playlists.

**rocketgamer31** (8): I've always liked this one, can't say I've listened to anything else by her though

**stansymash** (8): fun fact: this peaked at 2 in the US. in the UK where she is from, it peaked at 49. i am british and have never heard this song in my entire life.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): I love the mood this song sets above all. The production and melodies and vocals are all nice, but they all combine to set a really unique mood among pop songs. It all feels very cinematic and epic, like you're really being taken to another world.

**VodkaInsipido** (8): An Overrated Song

**WilsonJason** (8): bangerrrrrrrrrrrr

dropthehammer11: **eklxtreme** (7.5): that little keyboard sequence in the beginning is genius. the song is just wonderfully produced overall.

**grxmes** (7.5): Legit only remember this because of the DJ Earworm thing.

**JMez2612** (7.5): I REALLY wish I could understand what she's saying

**cadastre** (7): I prefer the Bassnectar remix :(

**joshually** (7): I swear this song is about growing up poor & destitute and always going hungry and having your electricity cut off

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I highly, highly prefer the Bassnectar remix, but this song still bops. It's a cute little track, and it has a bit more personality than all the recent stuff Ellie's been doing.

**fourchip** (6.5): ellie‚Äôs done better

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): idk this wasn't a hit in australia, which is fine bc burn is the better song

**zamomattel** (6.5): if this gets 2nd again I will sell various organs on the black market (probs just my kidney tho)

**TheTimidMartian** (6): enunciation is poor at times and support is spotty. thoughtful use of head voice and vocal layering saves the song from its downfalls.

**calltehshots** (4): idk if this is a popheads sin but this song is so annoying lmao. it makes me feel like a really annoying alien is about to possess me but not a cool one - like a really annoying one.

**suspicious\_padding** (3.2): Indie wannabe.Boring.

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): this is highkey her worst pre-Delusional song

**topesmachine** (2): this song is so damn annoying, it's like 30 bpm too slow and the production is shit

**dirdbub** (1): If this gets second again, I'm counting that as a win for the song.

Say it with me now: it should have been a single. This disco inspired album cut has always been a fan favorite to Arianators, and for good reason; the chorus, the verses, the key change, it's just a wonderful song.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): not even my love for mexican leyenda Valentina can make me hate this it's just so RIGHT

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): DAE GREEDY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE?

**Elitefourbrad** (10): VALENTINA KILLED THIS OKAY SHA SHEY AWAY

**enecks** (10): A shamelessly camp and joyous song that embraces pop for all it is. It's all cliches, yes, but when they're this well constructed and executed, who gives a fuck - look Ariana just did a key change! It's irony free fun and Ariana's peak as an artist so far.

**grxmes** (10): NOW HERE IS A BOP. A traumatic bop (take that thing off of your mouth) but a bop nonetheless.

**kanyewestrep** (10): really good key change https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFLSOIufuhM

**mustangs16** (10): keychange!!!!!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): God, I forgot how good this song was

**rocketgamer31** (10): GREEEEDDDDYYYYY OOOHHH! That key change at the end changed my life. Should've been a single but tbh the gays took care of that anyway

**skargardin** (10): I‚Äôve played this track so many times and yet I always get shivers whenever the key change comes

**swankyhoodrat** (10): I‚Äôm truly sorry Valentina couldn‚Äôt take in and moisturize her skin with this bop.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): if you‚Äôre bitter that this wasn‚Äôt a single that became a hit in every country clap your hands clap clap

**topesmachine** (10): me to my wig: i'd like to keep it on please

**twat\_brained** (10): GREEDAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY WHOO! When I first heard this, I instantly knew this would be one of my top 3 DW tracks. And that key change? A bitch was left **SNATCHEDT**. It's a shame this one isn't gonna win.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Jesus Fucking Christ Why Are There So Many 11s In This Rate

**zamomattel** (10): I remember when I heard this was going to be lipsynced to on rpdr I was worried it was going to be tainted, but the bop is more iconic than ever

**Albert\_Cole** (9.5): Ari's whispering is better than my singing

**blue\_heart\_** (9.5): WOO

**followingfreeways** (9.5): CAUSE I'M SO! CAUSE I'M SO!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): An underrated bop everywhere (except on popheads). It‚Äôs just so fun and care free.

**MaydayPVZ** (9.5): Why this wasn't a single I will never know

**axestogrind** (9): Ariana Grande Deals With Hair Loss - http://www.inqusitr.com

**calltehshots** (9): i literally cannot listen to this song without thinking of "i'd like to keep it on please" that makes it even more iconic

**carliescion** (9): Iconic intro, the best song at my zumba class

**DraculaWeekend** (9): That key change!!

**fourchip** (9): seriously valentina it‚Äôs not a difficult song to remember (also inb4 EVERY gay that rates this song references this mess)

**rickikardashian** (9): VALENTINA YOU LITERALLY HAD THE ENTIRE SHOW BY YOUR HANDS, THE JUDGES LOVED YOU, ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS TO KIND OF MUMBLE SOME WORDS AND MOVE YOUR HANDS A LOT AND THEY WOULD HAVE SAVED YOU, GOD, I CANT LISTEN TO THIS SONG WITHOUT REMEMBERING THAT MOMENT. I ALREADY KNEW THAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF SPOILERS AND I STILL SCREAMED WHEN THE WHORE CAME OUT IN A MASK **GOD**

**wailordfan** (9): Girl is cute, and a key change makes me wet. It is a good song, but something about it feels like an album track, so I don't think this should've been a single, and I don't think it is perfect either. We'll see.

**awryj** (8.8): I SO hope CRJ4 is like this song. It's so energetic and funky

**sletrab07** (8.7): inb4 "should've been a single", but... it should've been a fucken single

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the production is a great mix of burlesque pop styles and modern pop. it‚Äôs addictive just because of the production and it helps that ari slays on the vocals.

**kappyko** (8.5): ow, horny horns! crazy, sexy, cool pop soul from ms. grande herself. obligatory key change mention, some of the best vocals of her career, and orchestrated perfectly

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Originally, I didn't really get the hype for this track. But it's grown on me a lot since then, it has a really nice groove and killer production. Ariana does her thing, and hits some great notes on the hook.

**stansymash** (8.3): I was about to say that popheads had finally run out of taste, but then the key change hit and I did that big quint style 'woah hol up' motion

**banananaise** (8): like i get why people rave about this song, but this is so gay-specific it would have never succeeded as a single

**berober04** (8): I used to think that this was better than One Last Time, but I ended up flip flopping so much over their respective scores. In the end, I decided Greedy was slightly worse, for reasons I explain in the OLT comment.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8): NO VALENTINA POR QU√â POR QU√â NO ES TAN COMPLICADO POR QU√â? BTW SHEA WAS ROBBED HASHTAG WHITE MEDIOCRITY!

**JMez2612** (8): I still can't decide if I like this song because I actually like it, or because everyone else loves it...

**Marshynarsh** (8): Mask Snatched

**MissyBee37** (8): Oooh when that key change hits around 2:40... That seals the deal. This is a solid bop.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): INB4 every comment is about maskgate.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): K E Y C H A N G E

**WilsonJason** (8): groovyy as fuck damn

**jhxcb** (7.6): It feels a little dated already, but pretty good.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): One of the grooviest songs Ariana has ever released.

**quaerex** (7.5): I like the gospel flair, but the adlibs detract.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): it's good but I can't say I understand the hype around it.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): Bruno Mars can do this better than Max Martin.

**SkyBlade79** (7): chorus isn‚Äôt amazing but the rest is great, especially that key change

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6): am i the only pophead who thinks this song is like only ok

**NapsAndNetflix** (6): i've never understood the hype tbh

**joshually** (5): I honestly think this is my first time hearing the entire song as all I've heard is the clip from Valentina's infamous lipsynch

**nooodisaster** (5): Lol I seriously cannot enjoy this song anymore because all I think about is Maskgate. Although while we're on the topic, Nina SLAYED that. Problematic fav.

**shineflyer** (5): This is really overrated 'round these parts. It's got some good elements, like the bass or the vocal part in the pre-chorus, but it's still a bit weak to me.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (4): would be a good song without ari yelling greedy

**cyborglilith** (4): Doesn‚Äôt fit with the album aesthetic, and I don‚Äôt like the fancy high school musical shouting vocals.

**dirdbub** (4): In this we find ourselves, as lone subjects, isolated in chairs experiencing the spectacle of reovlution: no participation required. Until it's your turn to stand in a park and scream. You too can be part of the spectacle. Late capitalism has come to a breaking point with its apparatuses for reproducing narratives. Their truths must compete on the artificial markets that were hastily constructed by opportunistic businesses working in tandem with state agencies, trying to contain this new imaginary space as fast as it could be constructed. It has outsourced the most important function in media: it has crowd sourced the news' narrative function. It no longer has a way to construct the narratives and can not possibly dismiss every counternarrative. Huffington Post can be owned by whomever has the capital to assert control over it, yet its content can not be monitored. Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, but anyone editing must answer to the disposable multitude. There is a different sort of information order emerging, and it is not suited for repressing information: this information could be purely fantasy or it could correspond directly to state of affairs. In the vast body of information, larger than any that has ever existed, this information is reposited and reproduced a million fold. This sort of historical momentum is not to be trifled with, can not be bargained with, and can not be dissected. There can be no show trial. It can not accuse it of perverse sexual acts. It can not bring it into the fold. It can not have it work within the confines of a party.

**suspicious\_padding** (3.5): Basic and uninspired hot mess song.

**TheTimidMartian** (2): production is cheesy and the vocals suffer the standard issues that characterize ariana's vocals. songwriting is horrible and the melody is irritating and bad.

**deadspiderwall** (0): I HATE AMERICA

Kelly is just a great pop artist. Awesome voice, solid writer, just great. This song is a nice driving ballad with a hook for the ages, and those amazing vocals we all know from Katy. I honestly think this is better than the other Kelly song in this rate...y'all disagreed, but to each their own.

---
**Albert\_Cole** (10): I think you can hear the hint of a Swedish accent at times on this song. I really want to hear the Max Martin demo that no doubt exists.

**calltehshots** (10): yes this is kelly clarkson's best song. no this is not an argument. how did this lose to complicated? life is a true mystery.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ten y/o me was absolutely NOT ready to feel these things!

**deadspiderwall** (10): QUEEN KELLY

**dirdbub** (10): http://peppermintparvati.tumblr.com/post/164025454844/

**DraculaWeekend** (10): HERE I AM ONCE AGAIN I'M TOOORN INTO PIECES

**eklxtreme** (10): these vocals slayed my life. this is mom pop-rock done right and Kelly will forever be a legend for this.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): HERE I AM KELLY WHILE YOU SNATCH MY WIG

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A gut punch of a song, in a good way!

**joshually** (10): Jellz Jellz is my #1 idol, and this album's singles were truly stellar. The pent up anger is quite palpable.

**letsallpoo** (10): Fuck Avril

**mustangs16** (10): ooooof. this is the song i listened to while crying my eyes out after getting my heart broken for the first time, ngl

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Legend snapped here.

**nooodisaster** (10): I remember when I was in Elementary school, and would watch this show on VH1 every Saturday morning. It was basically a top 40 countdown as voted by viewers, and they'd show the music videos for the top songs. The week this song dropped far enough that they didn't show the MV I cried to my mom.

**omgcow** (10): The music video for this song gave me LIFE as an 8 year old, i used to see it on VH1 in the mornings all the time and it still sticks in my mind to this day. When she throws the ring at the guy she's supposed to marry and runs away like!!!! Fuck it up!!!!

**PuggleMaster** (10): HAZEL EYE MOB

**rickikardashian** (10): Paramore, FOB, PATD and Evanescence spent their entire careers trying to out-emo this song, but they never were able to.

**skargardin** (10): Clever lyrics, amazing buildup, show-stopping vocals, this one‚Äôs got it all.

**strawberryswing1** (10): I bought this CD at Walmart when it came out. I still love it, and am glad other popheads appreicate it too. So many bops. All these years later, this song is still amazing.

**jhxcb** (9.8): Near perfection.

**topesmachine** (9.5): god i love u Kelly

**wailordfan** (9.5): It bugs me that she hits that high harmony note every time instead of making it feel special or as a build up near the end.

**boogiepanda** (9): ahhhh the 2000s pop rock sound

**swankyhoodrat** (9): POP PUNK KELLY BEST KELLY

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Actual classic track, invented eye colors and the word hazel.

**stansymash** (8.5): hit my eardrum more like this

**awryj** (8): This song makes me feel like I'm about to get divorced

**banananaise** (8): Kelly Clarkson looks about 12 in the Breakaway album art

**followingfreeways** (8): this song was so emo for me in middle school, since I have hazel eyes, however everyone probably saw the tears I cried

**LuckyKidA** (8): What happened to Michelle Branch? A true pop queen.

**shineflyer** (8): a sad jam. you ever have those days where you're sad, but you don't want to ACTUALLY cry? this is the song for that

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): the hook either sounds like every other song to come out around this time or it's just one of the more memorable hooks of all time cause as soon as it came on I was like wtf I know this song.

**TheTimidMartian** (8): good vocals, good songwriting and appropriate, if somewhat dated, production. timeless chorus and relatable material.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): To me, the narrative loses ground when Kelly says "you won't get to see these tears I cry". How do we know that? Did her lover move away? Did she move away? It's entirely possible she DOES cry in front of her lover when they break up. Also, aren't tears supposed to come out the front of your eyes instead of behind them? I can't ignore these flaws I'm afraid.

**JMez2612** (7.5): Replace this with some more jesus-y lyrics and we got ourselves a CCM song

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): Queen of hazel eyes

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): I like this bc I have hazel eyes and hazel eyes are never referred to

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): isn't it

**kappyko** (7): My friend's mom's name is Kelly Clark so that effectively makes him Kelly Clarkson. Anyways that story is almost as interesting as this song

**saucymac** (7): I cannot stand this song, but objectively it's catchy and has a great build up

**VodkaInsipido** (7): Jesus I Remember Why I Hate Pop-Rock, Iconic Song But It Hasn‚Äôt Aged Well

**grxmes** (6.5): Why couldn't we have Breakaway instead?

**OxfordSemicolon** (6.5): I've heard this before but didn't realize it.

**zamomattel** (5.5): angsty icon

**JustinJSrisuk** (4.5): Wow, it‚Äôs certainly a blast from the past to hear Kelly on a pop rock song. Wait a minute - this sounds an awful lot like an Evanescence track, and that‚Äôs a bad thing.

**SkyBlade79** (4): actually sounds kind of dated

Oh man, this song honestly had no business being as good as it was. Autotune, kinda cheap synth beat, lyrics about nothing...yet, it's a complete banger of a song and already remembered as a favorite from the time period. This firmly established Kesha as the force she was/is, and it's really a great great track.

---
**jhxcb** (11): You all owe everything to this song. Come at me.

**awryj** (10): I remember thinking back in 2009 "I hate this song now but it will give me massive nostalgia in 10 years" and here we are, it's not even 8 years old and I love it.

**axestogrind** (10): Remember when everyone hated this song so bad that Kesha cried in an MTV interview? I'm glad we all accept that this is peak Dr Puke pop perfection now. Gay people can go outside without facing discrimination.... us 2009 Ke$ha stans didn't have the same luxury.

**carliescion** (10): The best party anthem

**dirdbub** (10): I remember as a kid wanting to make a music video for this song and choreographing the entire thing in my head and honestly I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt realize I was gay then and I don‚Äôt know how.

**Kaylaboe** (10): don‚Äôt stop make it pop dj blow my bussy up

**MissyBee37** (10): Oh, "Ke$ha". I'm so happy for who you are now, but it's hard not to love your iconic, catchy af early hits. This song is still so great.

**mustangs16** (10): trashy party girl kesha at her best!!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Iconic debut.

**PenOrAPencil** (10): My awkward 8th grade self was SHOOK when this song came on for the first time

**rickikardashian** (10): fUCK I FORGOT HOW GOOD THIS IS. 2010-2012 was filled of trashy loud party music, but Tik Tok will always remain as the best and biggest of all them. It has the ability to just make you want to dance to it and keep it in repeat for hours. Kesha always said all she wanted was to make fun music that people could be happy with , and she truly was able to make that with this, because no matter how dumb this song is ~~cuz lmao let‚Äôs be real, the lyrics can get dumb and trashy~~ you can‚Äôt help it but to dance to it hardcore. The glitter queen began her reign **RIGHT**

**strawberryswing1** (10): iconic

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): ANOTHER DEFINING SONG OF YEAR 9, I‚Äôd pay to see kesha perform this song live for two hours

**topesmachine** (10): I've heard this song so many times in my life and it's never enough

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Honestly? Play This At My Funeral Because Jesus Christ I‚Äôll Come Alive Just To Bop To It

**fourchip** (9.5): wake up in the morning feeling like p diddy grab my glasses im out the door im gonna hit the city before i leave brush my teeth with a bottle of jack cos when i leave for the night i ain‚Äôt comin back i‚Äôm talki

**twat\_brained** (9.2): This song is nothing short of iconic, but something I can't help but ignore is how Kesha is such an amazing vocallist that she doesn't even NEED AutoTune. That being said, I hope y'all are somewhere **PRAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYING** this goes top 10 yet *again*, because I know I will.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): :(

**calltehshots** (9): dr luke sucks never forget buuuuuut chugs a bottle of jack

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): i lowkey dislike this because this blocked Bad Romance from getting number to 1 but it‚Äôs a banger idk

**OxfordSemicolon** (9): This is trash but it's good trash.

**shineflyer** (9): Simple, stupid, and yet, still a bop.

**stansymash** (9): i have not spent THAT much time on popheads, but by osmosis i guess it's made change in me. the strongest of those changes being my shift from hating to Tik Tok to giving it a comfortable 9 in a rate and wondering if I should give it here. HOW

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): an iconic chart topper.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the production is so simplistic and dated tbh but that doesn't mean it's still not a bop. you can't deny its iconic influence.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): I wish I liked Animal era Kesha more than I did. She is a very charasmatic and likable artist with a sound and aesthetic that stood out from everyone else in 2010, and she did Uffie a billion times better than Uffie did Uffie, but... There's no denying the #iconic nature of this song, though.

**quaerex** (8.5): I said before that I don‚Äôt like artificial vocals... unless it‚Äôs Ke$ha. This is the party anthem America didn‚Äôt know it needed, but the one it most certainly deserved.

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.4): Kesha back in the $-sign days was full of the vivacious, bratty impetuousness that‚Äôll prove to inspire artists from Charli XCX to Taylor Swift in the present day.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): I remember my 12 year old self pretending to hate this song and Kesha because she was trashy, but in reality I was bopping to this song whenever it came on the radio. This is such a fun song and it‚Äôs super catchy, so it succeeded in what it was trying to achieve.

**kappyko** (8.1): when i was younger my oldest sister would play this song a lot as she browsed myspace and like she would get pissed if i mentioned the site around my parents lol

**chipsi1** (8): ended clocks

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8): what a blassic

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Kesha‚Äôs debut single is a slutdrop anthem we all know and love.

**enecks** (8): Yeah I know I gave Teenage Dream a 5 because Dr Luke alone but this song has Kesha on it and I don't want to judge her for someone else's actions. Dr Luke is a piece of shit and I hope he gets all his nerves eternally stabbed in the fieriest depths of hell

**ImADudeDuh** (8): God, this is a great song, heard this on the radio the other day and it felt unreal.

**nooodisaster** (8): This has never been my favorite Kesha song, but I can't deny it was a revelation as her first single. From the very first line, we're dropped into a sleazy, idgaf universe that's sure to scar suburban moms everywhere.

**omgcow** (8): jamz

**rocketgamer31** (8): Still a bop

**skargardin** (8): Part of me wants to say that this is soo dated but it still remains a fun, if ridiculous pop song.

**swankyhoodrat** (8): This song is catchy as fuck but Kesha has so many songs that are better than this tbh.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Synths haven't aged well but this is a mega bop.

**WilsonJason** (8): the most infectious song of whenever it came out

**TheTimidMartian** (7.5): poorly aged production and vocal processing, but the lyrics are honestly timeless. tuneless verses

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): a nice bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this aged like milk

**deadspiderwall** (7): ah middle school

**SkyBlade79** (7): sleazy bop that didn‚Äôt deserve my 11

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): It toes the line between bop and obnoxious for me, and there's also Dr. Luke, but it's catchy and memorable so I can't hate on it.

**zamomattel** (7): I remember when this first came out I thought I was a bad bitch for listening to it

**Albert\_Cole** (6.7): I'm going to be honest here: I love Kesha, and I've heard her perform this live, and she was fantastic. This is one of her worst songs, and frankly it's one of the most generic songs of the 2010s. Kesha has so much personality and potential that Luke very clearly *suppressed* for the sake of an image he invented. And Luke is a really capable producer, who clearly wasn't making more of an effort on this song than he needed to. This song could have been so much better in so many ways.

**cadastre** (6): The Royals of Kesha‚Äôs discography. Her most famous song but also not that good compared to her other hits.

**wailordfan** (6): um. This isn‚Äôt that good and is really best in the context of its own rate, but in comparison to the rest here it really shouldn‚Äôt be insanely high compared.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): I'm sorry, Kesha's great but I heard this song way too much in high school and can't stand it now

**grxmes** (5): Your Love Is My Drug outsold and was better in general

**joshually** (3): If you told me 8 (!!!) years ago that Kesha's album would be my favorite album of the year, I'd stand up and punch them out, because lesbihonest, this song is fun, but it's... awful

**suspicious\_padding** (2.5): Kesha came a looooong way

Prince is that dude. He's pretty much the co-king of pop right next to Michael, and this song proves exactly why. It's 8 minutes of sonic art, seriously, its incredible to watch this song take shape into what it becomes. The progression was so ahead of its time and Prince is legitimately a genius for the music he created. RIP.

---
**Damoojo** (11): It's so great!

**enecks** (11): This is one of those songs that is just one of the best songs ever composed. It's simple yet grand, emotional yet universal, punchy yet accessible, visual yet musical. Prince is a god damn genius and popheads should never forget that

**static\_int\_husp** (11): As a Minnesotan I feel like I'm obligated to give this high of score to Prince. Even if I wasn't, Purple Rain is not only one of my favorite songs of all time, but also one of my facorite albums. A true classic.

**berober04** (10): Absolute perfection. Just, what a song.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): isn't it

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): :(

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): No words necessary. Fantastic.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This such a perfect make out song ugh why am I so lonely. Also RIP.

**omgcow** (10): Absolutely legendary. When he performed this in during the SB halftime show in the rain an impossibly high standard was set and nobody, and i mean nobody, will ever reach it

**OxfordSemicolon** (10): The Super Bowl performance of this is one of the best performances I've ever seen.

**rickikardashian** (10): My ass hasn‚Äôt been in the mood for long outros lately, so this is actually like an 8 rn, but when my moody ass decides it can handle this song in all its 9 minute glory, i know i wil transferred into another galaxy where Prince is the main pop girl, doves cry and everyone wears stravagant outfits, and that‚Äôs when i‚Äôll find my place

**skargardin** (10): The definition of an explosive epic.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): It‚Äôs Purple Rain, duh.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Perfection, that is all.

**TheTimidMartian** (10): timeless. vocals, arrangement, production, and guitar demonstrate impeccable artistry. vocals are strong and lyrics are meaningful and the production complements the feel of the song excellently.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.6): I don't want to give this too high a score because it could win, but it also fully deserves to so here I am

**Elitefourbrad** (9.5): Everytime I listen to this song, my toes go purple from how good it is.

**quaerex** (9.5): An iconic classic. You can almost hear the pain and longing in his voice.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Prince being Prince.

**deadspiderwall** (9): rip prince

**joshually** (9): If you looked up "epic" in the dictionary, you would see... no you wouldn't see this song LOL... but I mean it's pretty great tbh.... instead you would see: adjective 1. relating to or characteristic of an epic or epics....

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): Prince is a legend for a reason. Not quite as iconic as When Doves Cry, but it's incredible that a nine minute long song didn't leave me bored at all.

**stansymash** (8.8): like yeah, this song is great, but isn't this rate to give glory to songs and artists that haven't tasted it? surely Prince has already had his glory with a first and second finish. everything just seems to already go really well for him, other than him dying and that

**topesmachine** (8.5): a slow jam!

**banananaise** (8): my mum is selling her old vinyls and one of my friends said he'd buy her Purple Rain vinyl, but it's been like 5 months and he hasn't done anything

**ImADudeDuh** (8): A classic that kinda goes on a little long!

**nooodisaster** (8): First time I ever heard this song ever. That was an epic experience of which I cannot say what happened.

**twat\_brained** (7.2): 8:40? I'm listening to this last. For all intents and purposes, all the comments will be made as I go along throughout the song. FIRST THOUGHTS: At least Prince didn't make a long-ass intro and started from 20 seconds in, bringing in some drums. "I never wanted to be your weekend lover"? SZA IS SHOOK! I'm about 2 and a half minutes in now. I'm still not sure what purpose the "purple rain" is meant to serve. One minute later, I'm starting to vibe to it, but I'm offput by Prince shrieking the lyrics. The guitar is quite redeeming, though. JESUS, that is some inCREDIBLE guitar work! I hope the rest of the song isn't like this, though, and Prince can start singing again. 6 minutes in, the vocalization was pretty good, and I'm really liking the guitar stuff, especially now that it's kicking into high gear at the 6 and a half minute mark, but this feels like the song is ending now. **7 MINUTES IN** and I wonder why the studio recording was made to be this long when it would've worked so much better as a live performance. Final minute: I'm enjoying the strings and the tambourine but is all that really necessary? Also, are those cheers in the background? Yes they are. Was this a live performance? Finally, it's done. Post-listening thoughts: Prince is a rockstar, but he's not a prog rockstar, despite what the song length may indicate. This would've gotten a 10 from me if it was at least 4 minutes shorter.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I feel like outside the chorus, this song is kind of meh compared to other Prince songs. I do really like the ending with the guitar, violins and piano it‚Äôs gorgeous. Also it‚Äôs way too long I prefer a shortened version of this song.

**kappyko** (7): rather over-indulgent for my tastes, but still quite gorgeous in a way

**shineflyer** (7): There's a lot to be said for a song that's over 8 minutes long, but doesn't feel like it. Still, the strings at the end did go on a bit much.

**jhxcb** (6.7): Overrated. But maybe that's because I'm from MN and I hear it ALL THE TIME.

**eklxtreme** (6.5): great instrumental break. I think he has much more interesting songs though.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): why is this so long

**SkyBlade79** (6): too long and the instrumental portions make up too much of the song

**rocketgamer31** (5.5): I'm sorry this song is boring to me and imo way too long

**PuggleMaster** (5): it's way too long

**Raykel** (5): I just don't get it. It's so long, the song never changes up, and it's not even catchy enough to warrant any of that. This would've been great if it were 4 mins long max.

**boogiepanda** (4): I think I have a problem with non-modern production because I can't struggle to make out the lyrics

**fourchip** (4): my dad would kill me for this score but then again he‚Äôd kill me if he knew i sucked dick so

**PendulumThief** (2): Too Long zzz

**zamomattel** (2): this song is so long and boring. I feel like the beautiful ones does what this does but in a concise manner. I know that everyone thinks its epic but I really cant stand it. Prince has many tunes but this just does not do it.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (0): not a great song (or even a good one, just forgettable) which people hype up as the greatest song of all time like tf

Nelly was the queen of pop at a point, probably purely because of this song. her and Timbaland have endless chemistry, and this sexy jam has so much flavor and passion to it. The back and forth vocals are everything.

---
**agentofscranton** (10): hot take - promiscuous > dilemma

**awryj** (10): i will choke every ho who gives this bop anything below a 5

**calltehshots** (10): a middle/high school ho bop for my fellow young thotties in the world

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): BUY THE RIDE ON ITUNES

**ComeOnAndSlang** (10): a 2000s blassic‚Ä¶ love it especially for the shoutout to one of my favorite basketball players of all time in Steve Nash

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Still upset that this song is #4. This song deserved to win.

**eklxtreme** (10): this is the best thing either of them have ever done. 10 years later and i‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head around how insanely good this is and how perfectly it‚Äôs produced.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Belly and Timbaland were the original Ed and Beyonce

**gannade** (10): A classic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is the pinnacle of the 2000‚Äôs. It truly is iconic.

**kanyewestrep** (10): Really tough to choose between this and Honey for an 11, Honey got the edge

**kappyko** (10): this is the flushed emoji as a song

**Kaylaboe** (10): a noughts staple

**letsallpoo** (10): Y'all don't know the true meaning of SABOTAGE. /u/PandoraKris gave this ha 0 for no other reason to stop it from winning, and that singlehandedly knocked it down from first to like fourth. A damn MESS

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Legendary.

**nooodisaster** (10): "You expect me to just let you hit it / But will you still respect me if you get it?" Summarizes patriarchal slut shaming in 5 seconds of the first verse, leaving the rest of the song to be a BOP. From the very opening of "Am I throwing you off?" this song DOES NOT LET UP. Sluts, gather and drop.

**omgcow** (10): Legendary!

**shineflyer** (10): Timbaland knows how to make a beat. (Sometimes.) The guitar at the end really brings it all together

**skargardin** (10): An iconic duet that hits all the right spots. This is how a duet should be done.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): One of the most iconic beats and choruses since the dawn of music.

**therokinrolla** (10): HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG

**twat\_brained** (9.8): The spoken word back-and-forth is cute and it's the backbone of the song and it features some of Timbaland's best production. He's also a much better vocallist/producer than Will.I.Am is. The only thing holding me back from a 10 is Nelly's hesitance to maximize the use of her voice like she does on the "Say It Right" chorus.

**jhxcb** (9.5): This is just a really well made song.

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.5): This track is an example of Timbaland at the height of his creative ability, and Nelly Furtado brings so much sensuality and attitude to her vocal delivery in this song.

**fourchip** (9.2): my mum used to love this album

**axestogrind** (9): Where were you when Nelly and Timbaland invented heterosexuality and subsequently became the Adam and Eve of our generation?

**deadspiderwall** (9): fuck yes

**enecks** (9): Say no to kinkshaming

**followingfreeways** (9): so Iconic. chivalry is dead

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): This song is such peak Timbaland and Nelly, it's great.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): I Appreciate The Love You Mods Have For Spain!! Come To Spain Hermosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa :]]]]]]] üá™üá∏üá™üá∏üá™üá∏

**Albert\_Cole** (8.6): It really feels like Nelly is out of Timbaland's league

**MaydayPVZ** (8.5): Say It Right is better

**quaerex** (8.5): Iconic song was the feminist anthem of our time. Timbaland adds to this track for sure.

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Yaaas an anthem

**cadastre** (8): If your friends don‚Äôt trade bars with you when this comes on are you even homies??

**joshually** (8): The OG call & response male-female hip-hop pop collaboration

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): Yeah this goes the fuck off

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): @10 year old me asking mum what promiscuous was and she said someone with a lot of relationships

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Nelly Furtado is a hip-hop legend.

**suspicious\_padding** (7.6): Bop.But an overproduced one.Easy on the Timbaland Nelly.

**stansymash** (7.4): MIA was wrong, timbaland is dead. he was born dead.

**topesmachine** (6): the song itself is okay but the "didn't think so" is so damn iconic

**berober04** (4): Does Timbaland's sound age well? I'm not so sure tbh

**TheTimidMartian** (4): spoken parts are pretty awful. the production is good however.

**zamomattel** (4): the sort of song a thot like me should adore but he is so irritating

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): isn't it

**saucymac** (3): this song is so beneath Nelly Furtado

I didn't expect a top 10 appearance for this song at all. I knew it was loved, but not THAT loved. Shakira may be the hottest woman on the planet and this may as well be the hottest song in history. This is like the Colombian national anthem I'm pretty sure.

---
**dirdbub** (11): This 11 is purely for my Colombian roots. I was born stanning Shakira.

**Albert\_Cole** (10): I would like to take this opportunity to remind everybody to listen to the Fugees' 1996 album The Score, which also had Wyclef rapping and Jerry Wonda producing. Apparently this was supposed to be recorded for the Fugees reunion, but Lauryn Hill didn't like it. If this had been a Fugees song, perhaps the world would be a better place (and even without that, this song is great)

**awryj** (10): I want to have Shakira's body. I'm a man

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): my hips are still shook

**ComeOnAndSlang** (10): iconique

**eklxtreme** (10): this song is an EXPERIENCE. these are two underappreciated legends and I'm glad they got together on such an incredible production to make this iconic bop. since I couldn't give this an 11 because of One Last Time, I decided to lower my score for nearly everything else in the rate by 0.5. :) :) :)

**Elitefourbrad** (10): When is Shakira doing hip dancing lessons? I‚Äôll pay for them.

**enecks** (10): SHAKIRA SHAKIRA

**nbapip** (10): once i did this as karaoke when steaming, and the dj called my name and thought it would be a girl bc of my name, then when he saw me said "normally this would be sung by a diva" and in mock outrage i said "normally?!" but i was drunk enough that i didn't notice someone had put the mic in my hands and the whole bar heard and from then on i was known in work as shakira but anyway the point is good song 10/10

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Should‚Äôve won its rate. Still bitter.

**quaerex** (10): Sorry, can‚Äôt give my childhood bop anything other than the score it deserves. Shakira makes you want to get up and dance. This song makes me want to speak Spanish.

**skargardin** (10): An iconic sexy banger. It‚Äôs damn near impossible not to dance while listening to this.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is forever the credits track to any YouTube tutorial for me.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): This Song Gets Played Every Year At My Family Gathering And It‚Äôs A Bop Yet I Never Knew What The Title Actually Was And Honestly? Thank You Popheads For Making Me Discover The Title Of This Bop

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.2): http://stahl-ebooks.tumblr.com/post/76098337643/heres-a-midi-of-hips-dont-lie-with-a-banjo-as-the

**calltehshots** (9): a reminder that this was my mom's ringtone for 2 years

**cyborglilith** (9): very messy but iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (9): NO FIGHTIN‚Äô

**LandonKidatrea** (9): ##shakirawin

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): i wish Shakira‚Äôs verses bounced a little more like the chorus, but otherwise this is a throwback bop

**MissyBee37** (9): You can't listen to this song and not want to dance.

**SkyBlade79** (9): dios mios

**swankyhoodrat** (9): Shakiiiira Shakiiira

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): OH MY FUCKING GOD IT'S A WORLD CUP YEAR I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED AHHHHHHHHHH!!!

**topesmachine** (9): a bop

**zamomattel** (9): shakira can do no wrong

**jhxcb** (8.9): Lots of memories with this song.

**banananaise** (8.5): this song gives me faint flashbacks to the class lego robotics competition, where one group made their robot dance to Hips Don't Lie. it was upstaged by the robot dancing to Irreplacable though

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Iconic throwback

**cadastre** (8): The first song I ever bought on iTunes tbh

**rickikardashian** (8): Like 10 years passed since the release of this song, and Shakira has aged like 5 months since

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): A bop, but I find it so hard sometimes to hear Wyclef Jean and not think of him yelling on that We Are the World remake

**stansymash** (7.9): this song is horny in two ways

**twat\_brained** (7.7): Highly boppable but if we're being real here then Wyclef should have top billing here. It's really his song with some Shakira lyrics layered in. I'm not sure why she gets so much praise for it. It's a shame this is her only U.S. #1 when it should really be "Whenever, Wherever" or "Waka Waka".

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7.5): Still a classic bop but I HATE Wyclef Jean‚Äôs first verse, it brings the song down.

**shineflyer** (7.5): It's not mixed well, but it's still a bop deep down.

**fourchip** (7): a true classic but i can‚Äôt take shakira seriously after that one vine of the chick doing the impression of shakira putting her hand under unexpectedly hot water

**nooodisaster** (7): the translation of the spanish the dude says: "what's your name? pretty. my house."

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): isn't it

**letsallpoo** (6): Luv Shakira but this never sounded fully realized to me. Half of its parent album is better

**theburningundead** (6): In my head this song is perfect but I am always a bit underwhelmed when I actually listen to it

**TheTimidMartian** (6): shakira's delivery saves this, but she sings like a frog-- way too throaty and with non-neutral larynx which is unhealthy.

**joshually** (4): This is a third-world version of Promiscuous in my opinion.

The King of Pop never disappoints! This song is 80s pop perfection, the guitar playing is masterful and this is some of Michael's strongest lyricism. His vocals are powerful and aggressive, all around amazing song. RIP

---
**blue\_heart\_** (10): I give this a 10 solely for the delivery on "they'll kick you and they'll beat you and they'll tell you it's fair."

**carliescion** (10): MJ is a legend

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): legendary tbh that's all that needs to be said

**deadspiderwall** (10): rip King of Pop

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Iconic

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Classic 80‚Äôs hit from MJ! WE STAN!

**enecks** (10): It's not peak MJ but peak MJ won the rate soooo

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Everything that has been said about this song has already been said, so I‚Äôll just give it a ten/ten and leave it at that.

**kappyko** (10): can u believe the actual michael jackson is now a moderator on this very subreddit and he's been dutch(?) this entire time

**LandonKidatrea** (10): HOW DID THIS NOT WIN?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I really like this, but this should be Human Nature‚Äôs spot.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): NO ONE can sell a song like Michael

**shineflyer** (10): I forget how good this song actually is. Shout out to Eddie Van Halen, seeing as this will be my only opportunity to ever say that here.

**skargardin** (10): What an iconic masterpiece. The bassline, the guitar solo, the vocals. It‚Äôs still as good as I remembered.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): HOW IS A SONG THIS LEGENDARY ON A LEFTOVERS RATE????? POPHEADS WYD

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Wow I can't believe Michael invented beating it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): a legendary song from a legendary man that deserves justice.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): It's prime MJ and Quincy Jones, what else is there to say? Killer vocals from Michael, great production, and a shredding guitar solo. Fun fact: there's a Fall Out Boy version where John Mayer does the guitar solo.

**twat\_brained** (9.7): The synths in the beginning don't have anything to do with the rest of the song, so I'm removing a point for that. The Van Halen solo redeems 0.7 points from me. Apart from that, is there anything else to say about this song? It's Michael fucking Jackson at his absolute peak!

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9.5): now this is the DEFINITION of a blassic.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): Weird Al did it better (okay maybe not, but he did it pretty well too)

**axestogrind** (9): TIME‚Ä¢LESS

**TheTimidMartian** (9): production is still good, the sound is still good, michael jackson is still good.

**stansymash** (8.7): i do not want to be defeated. he is right. isn't it wonderful how songs perfectly capture what we are thinking

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8.5): someone needs to make a porno feat. this song yea dude beat it yea keep going beat it that's right mmm

**quaerex** (8.5): The King of Pop is amazing because of the lyrics he fits into impeccable production. A catchy chorus keeps this a pop masterpiece.

**rocketgamer31** (8.5): Classic bop

**jhxcb** (8.3): Great, iconic, all of those words. But I feel like the recording was kinda bad.

**joshually** (8): An 80s classic for sure.

**nooodisaster** (8): I C O N S O N L Y . (Unfortunately not my fav MJ song)

**SkyBlade79** (7.5): one of the few oldies songs that deserves it

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): ins't it

**eklxtreme** (7): this is fun and iconic for the chorus and that riff. i think it‚Äôs far from michael‚Äôs best song but it‚Äôs a legendary song.

**saucymac** (7): controversial but this song is boring without the film clip

**boogiepanda** (6): Honestly prefer Fall Out Boy's version

**fourchip** (5.6): fall out boy‚Äôs cover was better and that‚Äôs the tea

**zamomattel** (5): worst song on thriller that doesn‚Äôt feature paul mccartney

**LuckyKidA** (4): Ooh Eddie Van Halen is sooooo talented.

The Fame Monster is, in my opinion, Gaga at her best. This song is one of the best on that project, with her oddly aggressive yet cute lyrics, subtle vocals, and a head-bobbing beat in the background. It's aged better than most songs on that album and I'm glad it's gotten the respect it deserves.

---
**skargardin** (11): THIS beast of a song. The production is really ominous and so are the lyrics and ‚Äúpaparazzi‚Äù metaphor but her vocals, on the other hand, are sweet and it flows so well. The bridge is also so extravagant and over-the-top, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre plastic, but we still have fun!‚Äù. This song is uniquely Gaga in its theme and execution. Paparazzi has got a special place in my heart, for it was at that moment that I had fallen in love with pop music and I just love everything about this song. It would be criminal to not give the song that opened up my love for pop music my 11, well done Gaga.

**agentofscranton** (10): gaga's goat

**axestogrind** (10): Did someone call for a modern pop classic because the call just went straight through

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): wig flew

**calltehshots** (10): her best song. did any of her other songs have her hanging by arm as she bleed? no.

**carliescion** (10): this track is so good. The Fame was the first ever album i bought and i remember playing this song every day

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of her best! pop perfection!

**dirdbub** (10): Another instance where I should have realized I‚Äôm gay but completely didn‚Äôt. I choreographed a dance with my cousin to this song.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): queen of killing her boyfriend

**fourchip** (10): this made me want to poison my non-existent boyfriend

**ImADudeDuh** (10): My most played Gaga song! And it's a major bop!

**joshually** (10): This. This song is the reason I became a Little Monster way back in the day. The song, that video my god, the iconic VMA performance... Gaga ruled the world.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Yes. Just yes.

**omgcow** (10): Legit my favorite Gaga song

**poppinmmolly** (10): my 2nd favorite Gaga song!

**rickikardashian** (10): [me doing the math to see what score i should give this song to make sure it gets 2nd place again](https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J3TXLyaTqjKFtm0/giphy.gif)

**SkyBlade79** (10): definitely top 3 gaga songs. Perfect lyrics, voice, and inflection. I want to love someone like Gaga loves the paparazzi ‚òπ

**swankyhoodrat** (10): Another iconic bop

**theburningundead** (10): Iconic song, even more iconic VMAs performance

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): one of the best hooks I've ever heard and one of the best videos I've ever seen and just a legendary bop overall.

**therokinrolla** (10): the best song from the fame. period.

**twat\_brained** (10): This song hooks you right in, the synths and percussion are relentless, and it perfectly encapsulates what *the fame* is like. Not to mention the **iconic** VMAs performance Gaga did. This is not on the same level as "Poker Face" for me but it's still a highlight on the album.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Honestly? Icon, Gaga Please Come Back To The Fame/Monster Again, Come Back To Doing Good Albums, One Thing You Haven‚Äôt Done in 7 Years. Thank You.

**zamomattel** (10): this video was like the first time I saw art

**chipsi1** (9.5): okay this is probably too serious but like how does someone have the will to work as a paparazzi person like why would you want to do that i need answers

**eklxtreme** (9.5): her vocals on this are so great and it has a very nostalgic, sweet, simple vibe that never gets old.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This is probably my one of my favourite Gaga songs of all time. Who knew a song about being a stalker would be so catchy? The chorus is amazing and how she says paparazzi is perfect.

**PenOrAPencil** (9.5): the VMA performance of this song kickstarted her career

**quaerex** (9.5): Gaga‚Äôs never better than when she‚Äôs using that tongue in cheek look at fame, like on this album, and Paparazzi is perhaps the most perfect example of that.

**jhxcb** (9.4): I love this.

**stansymash** (9.4): OOH BABY

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): I miss this gaga‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Go back to making bops !

**rocketgamer31** (9): Still one of my favorite Gaga songs

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Wow I can't believe Gaga invented TMZ

**kappyko** (8.9): most overrated the fame single. still good tbh but come on guys

**TheTimidMartian** (8.5): the sound gaga is known for. vocal technique is weak (weaker than modern gaga) but vocals are effective (more than modern gaga)

**Albert\_Cole** (8.3): This is *better without the music video come at me*

**deadspiderwall** (8): classic lg

**enecks** (8): A catchy well constructed song that I can't deny has aged

**grxmes** (8): Paparazzi found dead, remains eaten by Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows

**nooodisaster** (8): This is another song that's inseparable from its music video, to the point where I'm not sure how to rank this song by itself.

**sasuke-lp** (8): Great song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): is this one of the most iconic videos ever? Discuss.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): This song has honestly dated better than G.U.Y., and it has a great hook. One of Gaga's better early singles.

**sletrab07** (7.6): FADGA IS HOT

**wailordfan** (7.5): the vocals kinda bug me mostly because her live performances with the lower register harmonies really fuck me up and the song feels empty without them.

**shineflyer** (5): It's really not one of Gaga's best. The chorus is a kinda boring 4-Chords-Of-Pop progression. (The Stuart Price Remix is really good, though.)

**LuckyKidA** (2): I've heard this song too many times, as annoying as real life Paparazzi probably. What a terrible metaphor.

**mustangs16** (2): this is one of my least favorite gaga songs. i just don't get the hype!!

The best song on 1989, that's a given. This song is seriously genius, the guitar-driven synthpop beat is intoxicating as the pulsating bass dominates your headspace, and the verses are written so carefully. The chorus is memorable and very cute, this is just an essential Taylor song and encapsulates everything great about her. Sadly, couldn't pull out a victory/

---
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (11): orgasm, eargasm everywhere, wig flew

**cyborglilith** (11): places me in another dimension in the right situation

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): Let me tell you all a wonderful story about how I got into pop music. I was a lowly kid who streamed and pirated whatever got good Pitchfork reviews and whatever hiphopheads and indieheads were raving about. I didn't care for much pop, and the stuff that I did was EDM-oriented. That was, until 1989. Blank Space caught my attention - I absolutely loved the production and how self-aware the lyrics were (although my favorite line was the infamous Starbucks lovers line, which I didn't find was misheard until like two years later), but it was Style that truly made me sit back and say, goddamn, this girl is making classic records. As a former Pennsylvania resident who lived close to where Taylor used to reside, I felt betrayed and held a dumb grudge against her, but secretly enjoyed her hit singles. It wasn't until Style where I felt confident that this was something special, and this feeling only increased when I actually heard all of 1989. Style is one of those songs that's self-explanatory; it's a thesis for 1989 that not only usurps most of the other tracks on the album, but does it with ease. I don't expect this to win the rate, but nothing else really could get my 11 at this point. It's perfect.

**boogiepanda** (10): Fun fact the only Taylor Swift merch I only is the Style T-shirt. During the first few listens I fell in love with the bass line, when the MV was released I fell in love once again with the a e s t h e t i c

**calltehshots** (10): and we've come to taylor's masterpiece and the best song in her discography. idk how this taylor became look what you made me do taylor but we'll always have this.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): a DRIVING BOP!

**ComeOnAndSlang** (10): been my favorite song off of 1989 since my first listen‚Ä¶.. Top 2 taylor too

**deadspiderwall** (10): TAKE ME HOME

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song (and Blank Space) completely changed my opinion of Taylor. I'm not sure she'll ever top this.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Pure pop perfection

**enecks** (10): This is genius, no doubt about it

**followingfreeways** (10): I have never been more torn in my life when it came to giving either this song or all too well my 11. all too well won, BUT if ties were allowed this would get an 11 too. this is probably the only Taylor song ever made that never got annoying to me due to excessive radio play

**fourchip** (10): pop perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A classic song!

**joshually** (10): My fave Tasha Sweetums song of all time!

**Kaylaboe** (10): taylor‚Äôs peak

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Still her best song. Fight me.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Pop Taylor at her absolute best, everything about this song is on point and screams pop perfection.

**PenOrAPencil** (10): This is one of only 2 songs on 1989 that I actually like and tolerate

**quaerex** (10): A pop masterpiece, a world encapsulated in a tiny collection of syllables, a nostalgic look at the kind of relationship we‚Äôve all been in - we know it‚Äôs wrong, but it‚Äôs also too right. Perfectly crafted, exquisitely produced, Style is one of the best songs in Taylor‚Äôs entire repertoire.

**skargardin** (10): If there‚Äôs any song that truly captured the essence of 1989, it‚Äôs this one. God I love it so much.

**stansymash** (10): i wrote an essay in another comment about how taylor is passable at best and then i gave Style a 10 because i watch todd in the shadows

**strawberryswing1** (10): Perfect pop tbh.

**suspicious\_padding** (10): Taylor please keep making songs like this.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): I also love Dominic Sherwood being in this video

**therokinrolla** (10): i fucking cant with this perfectly put together pop song. the guitar, the lyrics, it ooozes cool

**twat\_brained** (10): Taylor Swift's 2010s discography has largely been hit-or-miss with half her album being good and the other half ranging from poor to simply unlistenable. Every so often, she hits that sweet spot where she finds a good beat, solid lyrics and a melody which doesn't push her voice to limitations it can't reach. "Style" is right down that alley for Taylor, making it a crowning musical achievement of hers.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): I Love You Taylor [3]

**zamomattel** (10): I remember being scandalized when one direction released that style ripoff

**jhxcb** (9.6): It's nice and sexy.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I think this is my favourite Taylor song of all time. The production is mesmerizing with the guitar and fits the song so well. And chorus is great and I love the descriptiveness of it so you know she‚Äôs talking about Harry Styles Taylor really hit the mark with song.

**OxfordSemicolon** (9.5): Better than anything on Reputation.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.3): Trust Taylor to release a song referencing bisexual icon James Dean, when will Gaga

**awryj** (9): A very good song technically, but it doesnt have that je ne sais quoi to be a 10.

**topesmachine** (9): One of the only Taylor songs I actually enjoy, it's a bop and one of her best tracks

**axestogrind** (8.5): Okay I thought y'all picked too many Taylor songs but all of these are top Snake material

**shineflyer** (8.5): That guitar and the low synth play off each other so well.

**Leixander** (8): Kinda overrated but still great.

**swankyhoodrat** (8): A cute bop!

**eklxtreme** (7.5): great chorus with an infectious melody (can it just be 4 mins of just the chorus and the guitar?)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): one of her better songs.

**rocketgamer31** (7): I've heard this so many times at various malls that I always associate it with shopping now

**kappyko** (6): radio overplay killed it a bit but it's still pretty

**nooodisaster** (6): it may never go out of style, but it's never particularly interesting either

**SkyBlade79** (6): kind of overrated

**TheTimidMartian** (5): overreliance on production

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3.5): Something about the vocal melody has really kind of grated on me over the time since the original rate. I don't know what it is, and I know it's a hot take, just not a fan of the hook.

**mustangs16** (0): before people say it -- NOT A SABOTAGE. i legitimately hate this song, and i've got a comment history to back it up. it's just grating and annoying and i disliked it from the first time i heard it.

I knew this song was loved, I mean who could hate it? The chorus is already iconic, and it's probably Kelly's signature song...but holy shit, top 5? I'm honestly impressed. This song suffered from some unfortunate events in its rate, and while it didn't win this one, a top 5 finish against the cream of the crop is honestly damn good.

---
**awryj** (10): I can't wait for the moment when I'm a 40-something year old father of a teenage son and I'm driving him and his friends to a party and this song comes on the radio so I turn it up and scream the hell out of my lungs to it and my son just wants to die and then I dab.

**calltehshots** (10): kelly clarkslay has 2 masterpieces on here that's how dirty you guys did her in the rates smh

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): THE BEST BRIDGE OF THE 00s

**ComeOnAndSlang** (10): one of the first songs i remember hearing in America‚Ä¶ will always hold a special place in my heart !

**deadspiderwall** (10): QUEEN KELLY

**dirdbub** (10): https://kidzbopdeathgrips.tumblr.com/post/168516254917/

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song proves that Kelly Clarkson is the best thing to come out of American Idol.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This would‚Äôve been closer to winning if /u/jailhousepoop didn‚Äôt actively sabotage Kelly. Her best song ever!

**joshually** (10): Every single female pop star merely wishes this was their signature song

**MaydayPVZ** (10): Kelly is the best thing that came from American Idol

**MissyBee37** (10): That chorus alone is ten out of ten. But it's still a great song start to finish, too.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Why didn‚Äôt this win its rate? I‚Äôm confused. This is like a top 5 song of all time.

**PenOrAPencil** (10): A true classic by Ms. Kellegend.

**PuggleMaster** (10): MY GAY ASS USED TO SCREAM THIS SONG WHEN I WAS LITTLE

**rickikardashian** (10): :)this:)lost:)due:)to:)sabotage:)complicated:)isnt:)better:)than:)this:)i:)hate:)this:)sub:)

**skargardin** (10): Kelly made such perfect pop rock. This is amazing through and through.

**stansymash** (10): easiest 10 of my entire life

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Okay the other Kelly track is a classic but this is cemented in history as life changing and skin clearing.

**topesmachine** (10): this is the best break up song

**twat\_brained** (10): SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GOOOOOOOONE!!!! There's really no point in reviving *American Idol* because it's clear that none of their alumni will ever come **close** to topping this.

**wailordfan** (10): honestly perfect pop-rock and a great representation of that entire musical era.

**grxmes** (9.9): I would give this a 10 but I have limited myself to only eight tens

**jhxcb** (9.6): Breakaway Kelly is some of the best Kelly.

**berober04** (9.5): This isn't a knock, but it's not surprising that Jimmy Fallon used it in his Lip Sync battles before they became their own show, because it's just one of the most entertaining songs to perform.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): kelly‚Äôs vocals are flawless as usual and the build-up to the chorus is incredible.

**kappyko** (9.5): wow it's really cool of kelly to cover ester dean's song from pitch perfect

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): POP PUNK KELLY BEST KELLY

**Albert\_Cole** (9.4): This is so painful for me rn. My headphones are slightly broken, so if I move my head to a wrong angle, the right headphone stops working, so I can't bang my head nearly as much as this song deserves

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9): a modest bop

**carliescion** (9): Kelly Clarkson at her peak

**enecks** (9): Fuck people who rig rates

**nooodisaster** (9): My platonic soulmate once called this the ultimate shower song, and I think that's a perfect descriptor. You HAVE to sing along to this song, whether it's the original or the Pitch Perfect cover.

**quaerex** (9): An incredible breakup anthem, which helps contextualize some of those feelings you have when someone leaves. You‚Äôre angry at them. And you‚Äôre glad they‚Äôre unhappy, because it legitimizes your own unhappiness. Kelly puts this into words and then she sings the hell out of those words.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): me singing passionately to this song even though I‚Äôve been single since May 2014.

**fourchip** (8.9): a mom pop classic

**boogiepanda** (8): Is it bad that I prefer the Pitch Perfect version

**OxfordSemicolon** (8): It's all in the chorus here.

**SkyBlade79** (8): a bop and still fresh

**rocketgamer31** (7.5): I remember when this song used to be everywhere, time flies

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): An anthem for a reason, and probably her best song. The chorus is instantly recognizable and great.

**shineflyer** (7): if you're wondering why this score isn't higher, well, here's the thing - we started off friends, it was cool bu

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Because of You got robbed.

**TheTimidMartian** (7): good vocals but poorly aged production and thoughtless songwriting.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.8): A song bursting with the righteous indignation of a lover scorned... but there isn‚Äôt really anything else here besides Kelly‚Äôs raw intensity.

**zamomattel** (4.5): can you remember when this song was‚Ä¶. sabotaged in the original rate. I didn‚Äôt really care because I think it is pretty boring and the verses are super forgettable

**omgcow** (3): I never really liked this one tbh and I can't really articulate why. it's just too loud.

Is this Katy's peaK? Most definitely seem to think so, and for good reason. This is the ultimate young love song. The lyrics are cute as all hell, production is damn fine and hasn't aged a day. The chorus....really just a great fucking song. Deserves all the acclaim.

---
**agentofscranton** (11): one of the greatest pop songs of all time

**JMez2612** (11): POP PERFECTION

**MissyBee37** (11): Pop perfection, without question. Quintessential head-over-heels crush song. I can't say enough positive things about the way this song just feels like it feels when you are so totally in love. It feels like its video - driving with the object of your affections, their hands on you, your hair blowing in the wind, the sun shining on your face, a dopey grin ear to ear, dancing on the beach. Cute lyrics; sweet vocal. That catchy chorus! Pure joy.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): This is probably the best pure pop song of all time. Beatles who?

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): too plain iconic, essential listening for the modern poptimist

**Albert\_Cole** (10): This song would be a good song, if not for the bridge, which turns it into an *amazing* song

**axestogrind** (10): It aged well for a 2010 song but then again pop perfection is timeless

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): issa bop

**boogiepanda** (10): I like this song

**calltehshots** (10): the best song of katy's career. one of the best songs of the decade honestly.

**carliescion** (10): This is a pop masterpiece

**chipsi1** (10): unimpressive witness joke

**cyborglilith** (10): The anthem of adolescence.

**dirdbub** (10): manic_pixie_dream_girl.mp4

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Perfect pop song.

**followingfreeways** (10): My middle-school self bopped SO hard to this it was such an iconic song at the time and is still one of her best songs to this day, Witness could never.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Another modern pop classic. Easily one of Katy‚Äôs best songs and one of her most memorable. Also I would like to thank Katy for creating this song and allowing it to be covered on Glee by the Warblers and giving me my first celeb crush on Darren Criss. A winning song in all ways.

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): No matter how messy the Witness era was, it‚Äôs timeless morsels of pop perfection like Teenage Dream that‚Äôll always make me give Katy Perry another chance.

**kanyewestrep** (10): this is like the song i would use to describe pop music... good song...

**kappyko** (10): https://web.archive.org/web/20170703062424/https://atrl.net/forums/topic/51860-i-ate-my-mom-out-in-a-dream-why/

**Kaylaboe** (10): popfection

**LandonKidatrea** (10): It's amazing that Teenage Dream didn't win its respective rate.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is peak Katy Perry

**mustangs16** (10): kind of a perfect pop song, even after all this time

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This definitely should‚Äôve won.

**nooncrawler** (10): Katy has yet to top this song.

**omgcow** (10): One of the most perfect pop songs imo

**PenOrAPencil** (10): Far and away Katy‚Äôs best song to date. One of the quintessential pop songs pf the early 2010s. Witness could never

**poppinmmolly** (10): a sweet bop that takes me back to senior year of high school. Ah, memories.

**skargardin** (10): This is just such a perfect pop song. I can‚Äôt really find anything negative to say about it.

**skiddos** (10): katy perry is the mozart of the 2010s. a couple of centuries from today everyone will regard this song the same way we do with classical music.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Perfect pop.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): My favorite Katy song for sure. It‚Äôs so infectious; once you listen to it, you just wanna keep it on repeat and it will not get out of your head.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): FUCK THIS SONG IS ONE OF THE THREE DEFINING SONGS OF YEAR 9, AMAZING, HOW DID IT NOT GET A GRAMMY, ABSOLUTE PERFECTION

**twat\_brained** (10): Here's a headcanon: Katy's "teenage dream" could just be that she wanted to be a successful popstar and have a wildly successful career, and the "you" she's singing to is Max Martin, because he's allowing her to live out her teenage dream via his work on her singles. Should I stop deifying Max Martin?

**VodkaInsipido** (10): If Edgar Allen Poe Were Alive And Drinking In The Summer Of 2010, He Very Well May Have Fucked With ‚ÄúTeenage Dream‚Äù. That‚Äôs Right: The Man Who Noted That ‚ÄúAll That We See Or Seem Is But A Dream Within A Dream‚Äù 165 Years Ago Might Have Found Some Metaphysical Solace In This Song Sung By A 25-Year-Old California Girl Dreaming About A 15-year-old‚Äôs Dream About What It Means To Get Deliriously Rearranged By Love. The Possibilities Of The Subconscious, It Turns Out, Are About As Lasting As A Perfect Pop Song. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Ever Look Back,‚Äù Pleads Katy Perry, While Doing Exactly That. Though ‚ÄúTeenage Dream‚Äù Does Everything In Its Power To Crack Off The Rearview Mirror, Pop The Top, And Swoosh Headlong Into An Eternity Of First Touches And Skintight Calvins, It Endures In Part Because Of This Dream-doubling Longing, This Sense That The Teenage Dream Is So Often A Dream Deferred. That Push/Pull‚ÄîBetween ‚ÄúWe Can Dance Until We Die‚Äù And ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll Be Young Forever‚Äù‚ÄîIs The Song‚Äôs Unspoken Engine. On The Surface, You‚Äôve Got Pop Geniuses Including Dr. Luke And Max Martin Offering Their Choicest Material Along With Perry, Who Turns In A Dynamic Vocal That Knows The Difference Between The Shaky, Real-World Verses And The Heaven-Bound Fantasia That Is The Song‚Äôs Chorus. But They‚Äôre All Cyphers For Our Collective Paradise, Where Dreams Don‚Äôt End. - VodkaInsipido For Popheads.

**topesmachine** (9.2): this is just such a solid pop song

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): legendary but Witness is her best title track now

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): i miss this katy

**fourchip** (9): no regrets,,,, just love

**nooodisaster** (9): yes.

**quaerex** (9): This is the sound of summers, and childhood, and the feeling that you‚Äôre almost free but that you‚Äôre not quite sure what freedom is yet. Katy Perry knows how to capture exuberance, and that‚Äôs never more on display than in this song.

**SkyBlade79** (9): a classic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A serious powerhouse single that totally played Katy's strengths as a singer, and has a classic chorus that feels so huge.

**TheTimidMartian** (9): effective songwriting, especially in the verses. good vocal control in verses as well.

**WilsonJason** (9): one of the few good songs shes ever made

**jhxcb** (8.7): It really is a true bop, but I feel like it has a really distractingly shaky start.

**stansymash** (8.6): katy perry made a good song once remember

**eklxtreme** (8.5): I love the pop rock vibes and they sound dated at all. always been my favorite Katy song.

**wailordfan** (8.5): I feel like Katy ignoring the whole concept of a bridge in music is a tad lazy, especially with the songs we have here. Typically this would be a 9-10, but gotta stretch this.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Katty does a good job here singing about having sex as a teenager, wait that‚Äôs actually sort of bad. Meh, we‚Äôve all done it, Katty just spilling the hot tea! I‚Äôm^sorry^virgins^sorry^not^sorry.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): This song sonically is amazing but it kinda feels like it's missing.... something? I really have no idea but it just doesn't feel complete.

**joshually** (8): A great song, but not her best... that's The One That Got Away

**rocketgamer31** (8): Bring bubblegum pop back

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): definitely one of Katy Perry's best songs. I kinda miss being tired of her on the radio.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): I have a lot of mixed feelings about the album Teenage Dream, but I've never been able to dislike this song. It's very restrained for Katy, and it works to the song's advantage. It's a simple premise, and she sells it super well. Not groundbreaking, but just a good straightforward pop song with a great hook.

**deadspiderwall** (7): rip katy perry

**grxmes** (7): Overrated. ET was better

**OxfordSemicolon** (7): This is a solid 7. Good, catchy, and nothing more.

**shineflyer** (7): a jam for the car, like the video suggests.

**zamomattel** (7): as a massive Perryhead, im not crazyyy about this song

**enecks** (5): Fuck you Dr Luke

**Raykel** (5): Katy's best song but that doesn't really mean much.

**suspicious\_padding** (1.4): Dr. Luke produced mess.I can‚Äôt believe it is considered ‚Äúpop classic‚Äù.

This was the favorite to win this rate outright and sadly, it did fall short a bit. This is Ariana's magnum opus and one of Max Martin's finest production credits. The four-to-the-floor driving synthbeat that all leads to the bombastic chorus we all know and love. It was the hallmark of pop for 2016 and it's a shame it didn't blow up like it should have.

---
**grxmes** (11): Another bop. One of the best pop songs of the year, decade, whatever. THIS HAS TO WIN

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I really wish I joined this sub back when this rate happened so I could just praise Dangerous Woman. This song is one of the best pop songs to come out recently. The thumping beat, the production, Ariana‚Äôs vocals, and lyrics make this song pop perfection. When I first heard this song, I fell in love with it and I had to check out the album. And I don‚Äôt regret it one bit because there are so many great songs on DW.

**letsallpoo** (11): I feel a personal obligation to give this an 11 because it was really my fault this never got the crown it deserved. Nothing was going to be RAWM, but if any song even remotely stood a chance, it was going to be this one. I want nothing more from /r/popheads than for this to win - if not this, than at least something in the future.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (11): Still the best song of all time.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (11): okay honestly this was the song that inspired me to listen to the rest of her discography and now Ariana is one of my favourite artists and I AM SO GRATEFUL TO THIS SONG IT SHOULD‚ÄôVE BEEN NUMBER ONE FOR 10 WEEKS

**agentofscranton** (10): i wasn't on the subreddit when the first rate was done so I missed out on my chance to give this an 11 initially (this is probably gonna win so I'm not gonna give it my 11), this is one of my favourite pop songs of all time, it's just pop perfection isn't it?

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): a bop, no need for more. it's a bop, issa bop.

**calltehshots** (10): did this seriously not win a rate? we truly are flopheads

**carliescion** (10): Her best song

**chipsi1** (10): yes

**cyborglilith** (10): doesn‚Äôt matter if you love bops, or capital B O Ps

**dirdbub** (10): You had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you. In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, or pray that their sons land on their feet soon enough. But I am not such a parent. In your place, if there is pain, nurse it, and if there is a flame, don't snuff it out, don't be brutal with it. Withdrawal can be a terrible thing when it keeps us awake at night, and watching others forget us sooner than we'd want to be forgotten is no better. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything ‚Äî what a waste!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): One of the best pop songs of 2010s.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): The best song of 2016 and one of the best pop songs EVER.

**enecks** (10): Into You is an interesting contrast to Greedy. It's sensual, a bit moody, and serious. But it's no less well constructed, and no less an ode to pop music at its peak.

**followingfreeways** (10): absolute pop perfection. such a summer song

**kappyko** (10): im so in2 poo

**Kaylaboe** (10): popfection

**Leixander** (10): SO BABY COME LIGHT ME UP

**Mudkip1** (10): wow a bop

**mustangs16** (10): the fact that i'm giving this song a 10 despite it being REALLY hard for me to listen to it this time of year just goes to show how damn good of a song it is

**nooncrawler** (10): The best pop song of 2016.

**nooodisaster** (10): Is "Too much for the half-open heart", A) Poetry line from a noble-prize winning poet; B) Lyrics from an acclaimed break-up album adored by millions; or C) a fucking tweet by Lorde stanning this pop song. You have one guess.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Another perfect pop song

**PenOrAPencil** (10): It‚Äôs criminal that this masterpiece didn‚Äôt reach number 1, let alone #13??? I hate America

**quaerex** (10): Possibly my favorite Ariana song, it‚Äôs a gorgeous display of her sultry, slightly smoky voice in the verses, and that brilliant prechorus explodes into the chorus and makes this a basically perfect song.

**rickikardashian** (10): something something pop perfection something something it flopped and the us sucks something something it deserved better ^(~~real talk tho, this song is amazing and if it doesn‚Äôt make top 10, im sueing~~)

**rocketgamer31** (10): Ugh this is pop perfection, I really don't have much else to say

**skargardin** (10): Honestly, her songs in this rate are her best ones, period. This one doesn't need explaining.

**skiddos** (10): deserves to win.

**stansymash** (10): this was the first time popheads told me to listen to a song they liked, and I'm upset by how right they were

**strawberryswing1** (10): Pop perfection

**swankyhoodrat** (10): Lorde was right about this song tbh. The GP wasn‚Äôt ready for such an up-front, sensual banger. It‚Äôs a crime this song didn‚Äôt do better on the charts.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): It's THAT track. One of those irresistible displays of pop prowess that doesn't fail to impress. "I'm so into you, i can barely breathe," she laments.

**theburningundead** (10): https://twitter.com/lorde/status/729539532517826564

**topesmachine** (10): the gay anthem to end all gay anthems

**twat\_brained** (10): I am rating this at damn near 3 AM but that isn't deterring me from giving Ariana's magnum opus anything less than a round & complete 10.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): A Good Song

**wailordfan** (10): Her pronunciation is actually good, the synths are perfectly touched, and the vocal replication of synths in the final chorus is musical viagra.

**zamomattel** (10): lorde said it best, pop perfection

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.5): Sheer pop perfection that features stellar production, the ‚Äúooh-ooh-oooh‚Äù cooing on the bridge still sends shivers down my spine.

**awryj** (9): im so interview i can belly brie

**axestogrind** (9): This song dredges up memories about August 2017 when Ariana cancelled her concert on the date where I was supposed to go. My friends, who were huge Arianators, both had $800 M&G tickets and one of them got in trouble with her parents for skipping school to get ready for the concert. We went to Popeyes after the cancellation and Popeyes was running an Ariana promotion where you spend $40 on chicken to get a free ticket so umm....... yeah.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): It took a while for me to actually consider this song to be one of her best. Definitely deserves to be a bigger hit in America. I would imagine in a few years when kids who liked this song would be surprised to find out that the song isn't even in the top 10.

**eklxtreme** (9): ariana is just flawless on this and the production is fantastic. everything is fantastic.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A bop!

**OxfordSemicolon** (9): This is very good pop, but it's too disposable to be truly great. You could swap it out with a hundred other pop songs.

**sasuke-lp** (9): Amazing song! Ariana at her best

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): When I listened to Dangerous Woman for the original rate, I didn't really have an idea of the hyped songs, and gave Into You a 6. I later found out it was the overwhelming favorite song on the album from the fans, and I had accidentally made a hot take. Since then, it's steadily grown on me and is now my favorite song on the album. It's just so well made as a song, and Ariana has never sounded better, honestly.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): honestly i've worn myself out on this song somehow

**fourchip** (8.5): the stranger things mashup i found on youtube was lowkey 10 timesbetter but go off i guess

**shineflyer** (8.5): inb4 overrated, but it actually is really good. that chorus bass is so good, and the chorus after the bridge???

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): a very good pop song.

**sletrab07** (8.4): I never reached the hype everybody else has for this song, but I'm not an idiot, I can recognise a choon when it slaps me in the face.

**boogiepanda** (8.2): I'm into you too Ari

**MissyBee37** (7): Sorry not sorry, I don't love this song as much as most people. It's fine. But Ariana has so many others I like better.

**deadspiderwall** (6): I'm not into you

dropthehammer11: 
**jhxcb** (5.6): My mom told me that if I don't have anything nice to say, I shouldn't say anything at all.

**joshually** (5): The "Touch My Body" reference pulls it up. I just find Ariane's voice to be so personality-less... like someone's just pushing buttons on a machine to create her vocals. Where's the soul, gurl?? Where's the feeling???

**TheTimidMartian** (2): the verses are notable because ariana attempts to explore her lower register only to find nothing there

**suspicious\_padding** (0): The most overrated song on this planet.

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) suspicious\_padding 

---
We have our winner. Let me tell y'all, this song went straight to the top and did not budge once. At one point it had like a 40 point gap over the 2nd place, it was never really super close. Honestly, this is a deserved winner. Everything about this song encapsulates why Britney was the superstar she was. The production is other-worldly and still sounds fresh today, Britney's vocals are sultry and sexy, this song is just pop perfection to a T.

---
**calltehshots** (11): this losing it's rate was another popheads rate tragedy that i refuse to live through again. this song is IT people. britney, the production, the video - come ON popheads smh

**DraculaWeekend** (11): Pop perfection.

**mockturtle\_soup** (11): tbh i would have given my 11 to waterfalls by TLC but i know it's going to eliminated day 1 & i want to be on the winning side of history.

**mustangs16** (11): this was a hard decision, but it feels right. god, what an iconic song, i love it so much. (i also associate it with that tumblr video where it plays over the first fight scene between captain america and the winter solider in captain america 2, and it's just perfect???)

**PenOrAPencil** (11): One of Britney‚Äôs most classic and iconic songs. How did it only peak at #9???

**rocketgamer31** (11): I've never met anyone who hated this song, and if they say they do, they're lying. I have literally never skipped this song in my life, and it's probably my favorite song of all time, so how can I not give it my highest score? Catch me bopping to it like it was released yesterday

**twat\_brained** (11): There was absolutely no possible way I was going to give any other song my 11 for this rate. After seeing the devastation that was Fever vs Music vs In The Zone which led to Kylie committing absolute theft of the #1 Godney Jean Spearsus so rightfully deserved, I want nothing more than to see this win the rate. It is just **pure pop perfection** in EVERY sense of the term, and deserved AT LEAST top 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. If this doesn't win the rate I will be in a VERY surly mood come the Y2K rate. In fact, if this doesn't win them I'm gonna deactivate my @charlie_th0 account on Twitter from its elimination to the end of the month. **THAT'S** how much I know "Toxic" is gonna win the rate.

**Albert\_Cole** (10): I still don't think it's Britney's best song, but that doesn't mean it's not a 10/10

**awryj** (10): This song is undoubtedly not only a pop classic, but a classic in music in general. Britney said that it's her favorite song and she's goddamn right. Cathy Dennis' and Bloodshy & Avant's genius blows my mind to this day and this would be my 11, but it was supposed to be Kylie's song so I gotta do her justice :jonet:

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): iconic, ICONIC, I C O N I C, i c o n i c

**carliescion** (10): This is POP 101

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): iconic

**deadspiderwall** (10): it's Britney bitch

**dirdbub** (10): Recently I had a hookup that had some.. interesting results. I hadn't fucked/been fucked in forever so when I got the chance I decided to hop on it. So I arrive at the place and open the door and the dude is just naked waiting there for me. So I go over to where he is and basically we get to the down and dirty. Well, when he was supposed to top me, he couldn't stay hard so we decided to jerk off, so we kinda just decided to do our thing for that. Right when I was about to climax, however, he whispered into my ear, "God, if you were my neighbor when you were twelve, it would have been hard for me to not destroy that ass." So I'm just thinking "WAIT WHAT THE FUCK" while climaxing because that's just where I was for the jo session at that point and basically the point of this story is I've been fucked up ever since that happened.

**eklxtreme** (10): this is pop perfection. this is what historians will look back at 700 years from now as an example of what music should be. I feel blessed to be alive while this song exists.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): I almost gave this my 11 until I realized we weren‚Äôt rating the shitty flute version.

**enecks** (10): The beat of toxic is a genuine miracle of pop. Its call and response of guitar and violin in the verses is maybe some of the best production ever. This production is so good, with a fairly basic mashup it can make Look What You Made Me Do - one of the greatest dumpster fires of contemporary pop history - into a great song.

**followingfreeways** (10): this song is a classic bop, but also the first thing I think of when I hear it is that one George guy from xfactor who sang this and he said ride like "roid" and I thought it was the funniest thing ever

**grxmes** (10): Another one I wouldn't be mad at winning

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Actual perfection. This is Britney‚Äôs signature song and I think her best song ever. It‚Äôs rare to have a hit pop song that is also lyrical great and clever but this song does that, along with being catchy and interesting. Honestly one of the most iconic pop songs out there.

**joshually** (10): Triple P: Pure Pop Perfection

**kappyko** (10): EPITOME OF BRITNEY LMAO! DESERVES TO WIN AND I'LL BE PRESSED IF IT DOESN'T. guitars are absolutely sexy, a masterpiece of melody and songwriting. there's an aesthetic to Britney music that nobody else can pull off, and this song kinda proves it. a sleazy, slightly urban but not entirely, electronic, pitch perfect aura surrounds this song and I've been for this ever since i first heard it. if you don't like this song i'm banning you from /r/popheads. no seriously, disliking this seems antithetical to the entire /r/popheads purpose

**Kaylaboe** (10): popfection

**MissyBee37** (10): I wish I had two elevens. This song is that good. Absolute pop perfection. Catchy af. The music! That vocal! This has to be one of her best vocals. Britney is hypnotic, sexy, fun, on top of her game.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song shouldn‚Äôt be here, because it should‚Äôve won.

**omgcow** (10): An icon! One of the cornerstones of pop music history and honestly a life changing moment for me. And one of her best videos for sure.

**PendulumThief** (10): A true classic.

**poppinmmolly** (10): a classic bop

**shineflyer** (10): I've seen people calling this overrated, but honestly, this has masterful production on it. The sampling is great, the guitar is great, and that synth that leads into the chorus is SO suspenseful. Like, the anticipation there is crazy.

**skargardin** (10): THIS is the definition of iconic, truly a career-defining song

**strawberryswing1** (10): Perfect pop

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): do u know how fucking hard it was to choose between this and into you for my 11 like i feel i've betrayed my favourite child this song is just perfect in every way

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Can you give this anything but a 10? The iconic sample, Britney's bombastic chorus, and honestly, the best instrumental she's ever sung on by quite a margin. It's a perfect pop song if I've ever heard one.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): pop perfection, iconic, unforgettable, Britney's best song, the rest of them wish they could write a song as timeless.

**TheTimidMartian** (10): polished track; the production is excellent and timeless, the lyrics are great but even more so is the delivery, which is sexy and accurately captures the feeling of danger that britney is after.

**topesmachine** (10): Brit's best song of all time, indisputably

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Why Are There So Many 11 Candidates In This Rate

**zamomattel** (10): I am a homosexual, I see toxic I put a 10

**fourchip** (9.7): little gay me‚Äôs sexual awakening

**stansymash** (9.5): you know that bit where the string part plays something different instead of the usual classic riff. yeah i gave birth at that bit

**jhxcb** (9.2): Iconic song.

**banananaise** (9): when i was a teenager, i listened to Toxic and Womaniser on repeat while playing mass effect 2, and i think it enhanced my experience of both the music and the game

**boogiepanda** (9): I c o n i c

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): a blassic bop

**quaerex** (9): I think I did a dance performance to this song as a kid. I‚Äôm sure I was terrible, but Britney is incredible, so it probably all worked out. Her growl on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm addicted to you‚Äù is burned into my ears - in a good way.

**sletrab07** (8.9): The gays could praise this better than I ever could.

**axestogrind** (8.5): I feel obligated to my 7 year old self to give this a high score

**cyborglilith** (8.3): When I found this song on Just Dance, I was addicted. Listening to it again, I realize it‚Äôs nothing special, and the strings are annoying. However, that chorus is still boppy.

**nooodisaster** (8): If this was a videography rate, it'd be a serious contender for the 11. That video is inseparable from this song for me.

**SkyBlade79** (8): actually iconic

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): An iconic song for a reason. I'm not as high on it as some people, but I'm not going to deny that it's a good pop song and song in general.

**wailordfan** (8): Her vocals have always been a bit bothersome to me. They are cute, but I feel like we needed a bit stronger of a voice to absolutely own this song. The production is really great though and seriously iconic.

**WilsonJason** (8): classical music

**OxfordSemicolon** (7.5): I've never liked Britney. I wasn't paying attention when she was big and now she sounds like a pop star making average music with a worse-than-average voice. That said, she sounds good in this song, the strings are great, and this is catchy as hell.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): why does everyone worship this song so much
