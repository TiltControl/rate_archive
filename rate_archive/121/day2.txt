WHAT DID SONIC EVER DO TO YOU!!! Live and Learn has such nostalgia for me and I was so glad it was voted in!  Still, it's a shame to see it go now. Sure it's butt rock, but it's good butt rock!

# Hanging on the edge of tomorrow

**1998tweety** (10): yes i listen to rock music yes im straight.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is the best sonic song in this rate. No I will not accept criticism in this correct take.

**Parkouricus** (10): i learned the lyrics to this at like 7... but what we should REALLY be focusing on here is the sheer perfection of that guitar work!! JUN SENOUE WENT BONKERS!!

**Qwilphish** (10): sonic songs are so iconic. im goin fast

**runaway3212** (10): I love this soo much im so hyperglad it got voted in

**waluigiest** (10): I always imagine shadow the hedgehog himself is singing this

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hell yeah, now this fucking rips

**akanewasright** (9.5): Iconique

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): anyone who gives this a low score isn't hanging on the edge of tomorrow

**nt96** (9.5): The fact that this game is already over 20 years old….I think I just got crow’s feet

**shhhneak** (9.2): Rock opera excellence.

**Chevsapher** (9): Say what you wanted about the dated production, but these melodies are excellent. The guitar solo is fun, and the breaks before the choruses are the cherry on top.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): we need olivia rodrigo to go into Sonic the Hedgehog rock for her next album

**UltimateDomon** (9): I need Crush 40 to come back for the next Sonic game please

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Forget video game music, that guitar riff is flat out one of the most iconic I’ve ever heard for any song

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): more than a little bit iconic!

**steelstepladder** (8.5): Butt rock has one use and that's in Sonic Soundtracks

**stryxen** (8.2): this was a great surprise this fucking hits

**cheatviathan** (8): Crush 40’s music still has a nostalgic soft spot in my heart, and this track still rages after all these years. I still know the words to this one by heart, and will not hesitate to sing it when it comes on.

**nooodisaster** (8): I will

**pig-serpent** (8): Ducktails! Whoo Hoo! Hangin on the edge of tomorrow!

**skargardin** (8): oh wait this goes off!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): we love a budget Aerosmith

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I can see this fitting on Crazy Taxi (now that I think of it, SEGA surely loves this punk sound a lot)

**PhloxInvar** (7.5): WOAH. This is a good Sonic song, that borders on great? Wow.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): this kind of song is just hilarious in the context of fuccingg sonic the hedgehog

**BoneStreetSand** (7.1): I only stan Sonic Heroes.

**bbfan132** (7): kind of tacky but still fun lol

**hikkaru** (7): i actually kinda really hate sonic adventure 2 and a little part of me dies inside every time it's hailed as the best 3d sonic if not the best sonic game period. i don't know who thought it was a good idea to make a SONIC game literally only a third of the game (far less than that in total playtime though, really, as the other two level styles take far more time to complete) but it's actually horrible. playing through sa2 is enjoying the high-speed fast-paced sonic/shadow segments and then slogging through the tails/eggman and knuckles/rouge stages. the tails/eggman stages are like, fine i guess but they're so... BORING like going from the fast paced style of level to this weird shooter/platformer hybrid thing while you are inside of a clunky large vehicle is not what i want to do, especially since sonic adventure 1 had already made a gameplay style for tails that was more enjoyable than this? it's just so uninteresting!! the true enemy though is the knuckles/rouge stages oh my GOD like i already didn't love the knuckles stages in sa1 but i don't know why when they were developing sa2 they were like "u know what we should do? we should add another character that does these emerald hunting stages... AND we should make it so the radar/tracker only shows one at a time when it worked perfectly fine in the first game to show all three at once... yes yes this is good!" like omfg BYEEEEEEE in no universe would i ever want a third of the stages to be this format, but the thing is that some of them are so frustrating in design they're literally a damn maze so they take AGES so it is literally so draining and i just ! it rly makes me not want to play the game anymore! i get that a lot of people have nostalgia for sonic adventure 2 but unfortunately i didn't play it until i was a bit older and it was just really disappointing to not really enjoy it at all after hearing so much praise. i would much rather play main pop girls GENERATIONS and COLOURS which slap simply because they focus on what makes the core gameplay of sonic enjoyable and don't meander with boring and unenjoyable alternative gameplay styles that are really unnecessary and just, as a whole, make the experience frustrating

**ReallyCreative** (7): the most listenable Sonic track, it's pretty good but still a little corny

# I HATE THAT HEDGEHOG

**turtle\_on\_mars** (6.1): LIVEANDLEARN

**BebeLuigi** (6): Not a fan of this kind of rock in Sonic but damn it is catchy

**2dina3dworld** (5): Foo Fighters but make it Sonic (2)

**wavingwolves** (5): what scorpions song is this

**alexpiercey** (3.8): Sorry but sonic blows

**RandomHypnotica** (3.5): this is the kind of song my parents would listen to, which is music i've been vastly overexposed to, and i think as a result i've been desensitized to it? I just feel excessive boredom listening to this, and it lingers on for 4 and a half exhausting minutes

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): I love all the music from sonic adventure 2 EXCEPT this edgelord anthem

**AHSWeeknd** (3): damn ma is Sonic that serious?

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): This is my lowest score for the Sonic songs so I’ll use it as the place to talk about how my friend invited me to see the Sonic The Hedgehog movie with him (he can’t drive so I took him) and when it ended we both sat there dumbfounded and exited the theater in complete silence… neither of us said anything for a while until he apologized for asking me to see the movie and then paid me back for the cost of the ticket. who the fuck was that owl

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (2): somehow, incredibly, feels longer than through the fire and flames. i have lived and learned never to listen to another sonic track

rslashpoopheads: I'm very late but I need to say this. K.K. Slider was the only reason I made it through the pandemic and you guys eliminated him in 54th. Please take some time to reflect on your actions. Thank you.

Well there goes the first of the Persona tracks and this was probably the best to go. I find this to be one of the weaker Persona tracks, but it seemed to be the most well known from the game so it went in. It's still fun, but I think there are a few things holding it back from being *great*.  Mostly the delivery on the verses is a bit of a mess, but again still a good track. This one was pretty solidly day 2 for most of the rate 

---

# True Love

**alexpiercey** (10): Charlie Tunoku is a hero

**skargardin** (10): Even after having played x hours of this game it never gets old, perfect battle music I think

**steelstepladder** (10): Junes theme is a 10 as well

**Parkouricus** (9.5): reading the lyrics does not make this any more comprehensible! BUT IT SLAPSj

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (8.5): best part of an honestly extremely mediocre game (fight me)

**wavingwolves** (8.3): i love rock

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): Time to Make History outsold (so did most of this soundtrack, this was kinda the weakest vocal song from this soundtrack)

**Awkward\_King** (8): is she saying lesbeans

**bbfan132** (8): i really use this one term for every song but this is very fun!

**cheatviathan** (8): You hear those guitars, you hear those organs, and you can’t help but sing along to that chorus. Not my favorite vocal track from P4. “Heartbeat, Heartbreak” and “Pursuing My True Self” come to my mind as better, but this is still a kickass battle theme.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I really like the chorus to this, but the verses are just like they wrote the lyrics before the melody.

**seanderlust** (8): Do not waste your time in hating flirting guys / Use your mind to AIs, bring justice to them all -- SPILL BESTIE

**UltimateDomon** (8): I like the guitar on this one a lot

**1998tweety** (7): I wish this was doing more for me but its ok [2]

**BebeLuigi** (7): Yes love it

# Truth Hurts

**ImADudeDuh** (7): “Reach Out for the Truth” sounds like the tagline of an alt-right website

**RetrohTanner** (7): If this song ends up in the top 10 of the rate I will consider it to be an implicit endorsement of Yosuke Hanamura's homophobia by the popheads userbase

**Roxieloxie** (7): why are there so many personas

**rslashpoopheads** (7): it ain't Mass Destruction but it'll do

**runaway3212** (7): not quite as big a banger as dancing all night but still pretty good

**waluigiest** (7): what about the homo man?

**Chevsapher** (6.7): What even is this songwriting? Oof.

**plastichaxan** (6.5): this sounds like the beginning of a no doubt song...just the beginning

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I swear she says "lesbians" somewhere in there

**Qwilphish** (6): the chorus is great but the rest of the song pales in comparison

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): uhh do the lyrics make sense in the context of the game?

**stryxen** (5.5): sure it’s a song

**fadedblue09** (5): The top comment for this on YT said they thought the song was sung in Japanese. That alone says a lot.

**nooodisaster** (5): I expect better

**pig-serpent** (5): I've listened to this song about four times now for this rate and I don't think I've paid attention to it any of those times.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): I wonder who songs these songs

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): so corny the state of Nebraska has sued for copyright infringement

**2dina3dworld** (2): this sounds like a reject Puffy AmiYumi song

A tik tok SMASH! (Apparently. i honestly didn't know til the comments came in) Anyways this is a solid 10 and deserved day 3 at minimum. It's the most meaningless thing to make a song about, but they both are having so much fun with it! The beat is nice and it's almost impossible not to bop along. Really a lot of the soundtrack of this game is amazing, but this one takes the cake.

---

# Got their drivers license last week

**agentofscranton** (10): god miss mooselini was really in her bag that day

**anothertown** (10): i seriously recommend playing this and the sequel or watching videos (they’re short) it's so good. one of the final songs in the first one is all the characters rapping about being in line to poop in the public bathroom

**Awkward\_King** (10): cant stop thinking abt someone saying this sounded like bree runway

**ImADudeDuh** (10): tiktok smash

**jayjaysortagay** (10): this shit is from a PS1 game?!

**JunkyGS** (10): How many people going to learn the tiktok sound is from this....

**ManofOranges** (10): Plssss this literally hits too close to home because this reminds me of when I went to take my driver's test and then did everything right except I hit the barricades during parallel parking and immediately failed because of that and then I had a breakdown.

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): omg Bree Runway? is that you??

**plastichaxan** (10): this actually goes on after the tiktok même huh?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): is this that "Driver's License" song that's been blowing up??

**Raxxin** (10): this is a masterpiece

**ReallyCreative** (10): TikTok has rotted my brain, BOP

**Roxieloxie** (10): me next month when my mom sends me to driving school

**steelstepladder** (10): DID YOU CHECK THE TOILETS ON THE LEFT

**teenwitches** (10): maybe "step on the gas" will be our always. step on the gas? step on the gas.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (9.5): DO-YOU-KNOW-WHY-THIS-IS-A-9.5? (DO-I-KNOW-WHY-THIS-IS-A-9.5?) THAT'S BECAUSE I JUST REALLY LIKE IT. (WOOO-HOOOO!)

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): I'm obsessed with this song and need to play this game somehow

**alexpiercey** (9.4): WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!! I HAD NO IDEA

**Alumineous** (9): Really needed this tutorial as a gay man.

**bbfan132** (9): yes.

**Chevsapher** (9): Woah-ho-ho-HO! This is adorable.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): got my drivers license last week

**pig-serpent** (9): I love this kind of piano beat for rap songs and the MC has a surprising amount of charisma for being a driving instructor.

**runaway3212** (9): banger

**seanderlust** (9): queen of knowing what is and isn't kung fu

**UltimateDomon** (9): I think about this song every time I drive

**waluigiest** (9): this is from a video game?? camp

**luckyphase** (8.7): please, no one gove this song a zero

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I was gonna knee-jerk give this a bad score but honestly it actually kinda slaps? That piano is a great foundation for the song and the delivery sells the weird “playground game” vibe

**turtle\_on\_mars** (8.4): iconic, olivia rodrigo wishes she could write as well as this

**1998tweety** (8): omg this is a serve, tiktok smash

**akanewasright** (8): Apparently this was a thing in TikTok? Either way it makes me smile

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Vote for frog's TikTok grab bag.

**nt96** (8): This is a bop

**Parkouricus** (8): this is, in fact, the best song about getting your driver's license

**skargardin** (8): I should play this in the car someday

**stryxen** (8): well this was simply whiplash

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): I can see how this would be iconic if I had nostalgia for it

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): step on the gas

**2dina3dworld** (7): unfortunately I cannot drive, so I am vaguely envious of Parappa the weird dog thing for being able to drive

**BoneStreetSand** (7): PaRappa's got nothing on the Kongs. Would've scored it much lower but I respect his hustle.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): gonna go for a drive and see where these directions take me

**cheatviathan** (7): Just to get my implicit biases as a critic out of the way, it took me two tries to pass my road test. With that said, it’s a fun enough song. That jaunty piano is nice. I’m sure this is a fun level to play in the game, but not something that I’d willingly seek out outside of it.

**cremeebrulee** (7): olivia rodrigo be like

**kirby31200** (7): https://youtu.be/mGlCGMm8Qag

**Qwilphish** (7): i will never stop stepping on the gas

**static\_int\_husp** (7): PaRappa we're never gonna fuckin get anywhere if you keep jerking on the brakes so often

**nooodisaster** (6.5): is cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): WAIT THIS IS WHERE THAT TIKTOK SOUND COMES FROM

# Red lights, stop signs

**LesApfels** (5.5): She kinda sucks as a driving instructor ngl

**BebeLuigi** (5): I love how those songs are incorporated into the level but I wouldn't listen to them of my own outside of it

**RetrohTanner** (5): Why is she named after a fascist dictator

**wavingwolves** (5): tiktok led me to believe the lyrics to this were "alright we're here just sitting in a car i want you to show me if you can get FUCKED" when it's not

**AHSWeeknd** (4): step on the gas????

**EnCaine** (4): there are much better parappa songs

**N454545** (4): Cringiest lyrics

**ignitethephoenix** (3): this being a video game song confuses me so much because it sounds like something on a children’s tv show

**PhloxInvar** (3): I'm so sorry Romantic Love, you deserved a spot over this.

**shhhneak** (3): if only it was that easy.

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Rating a song about driving...in a mostly gay subreddit. Good luck sis!

**endcreditouilles** (0): Woah ho ho ho! Stop the song!

**NFLfreak98** (0): Boom boom boom bam bam bam? I don’t think I want to learn how to drive from you

**rslashpoopheads** (0): Yo! It's PB! PB! Who's Peabo Bryson? Two years ago I renewed my license Anyway, why'd I start my verse like that?! You can suck a dick, you can suck on a ballsack No, no, I don't endorse that, pause that, abort that Just the other day mi go a-London, saw dat, kids down di street Paparazzi, all dat Hey hey, what can I say?

Nier Automata's been on my to playlist for a very long time, so I actually don't really know the context of this song. That said, it's an absolutely gorgeous vocal and even without context you can feel the pain shine through. There was also mention of the Japanese version > English version in the comments so I listened after and fully agree there. At the very least it seems like the English version they had to do some weird timing to fit in the worlds into every line of the song, where the Japanese one feels much more natural and fitting for the song. English versions were mostly chosen to be standard so my own biases wouldn't be the ones deciding which versions were used over others (otherwise we'd have gotten Passion instead of Sanctuary) but after listening to the primary version perhaps the switch should've been made in this case.

---

# Carrying the weight of the rate

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is MY SHIT, tell me a story!

**koopaastroopas** (10): (I don’t have enough 11s for this ;_;)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): one of the few songs that has the power to make me cry, this is stunning in every way, both on it's own and in the context of the game, easily one of my favourite songs of all time, even outside of gaming. But also, ACTUAL GAME SPOILERS: Ending E was so beautiful with the chorus singing added ugh, who knew credits could make me sob

**skargardin** (10): I didn't notice that I had Slayyyter's "Letters" in the queue as this was supposed to play and when I tell you that I was VERY confused there for a second

**UltimateDomon** (10): The End of Yorha version would have been a 12

**1998tweety** (9.5): this is beautiful [2]

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Alright, I'm convinced to check out this game series.

**Parkouricus** (9.5): trying to keep myself from spoiling myself by reading the comments. which is HARD. BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY BEAUTIFUL

**AHSWeeknd** (9): I wonder if the dreams came to life

**cremeebrulee** (9): oh this is lovely

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I know nothing about this game except that it had like, robots or something and people thought it was weird? And then the sequel game or remaster or something had a transphobic achievement in the game. The song is pretty though, cinematic ballads like this can be hit or miss but this hits all the right beats and the string arrangement really elevates it. The lyrics are a bit on the nose but the content actually resonates with me… like yeah there is such a burden to not being able to save everyone and having to keep believing that you can is so hard.

**nooodisaster** (9): I haven't played the game but reading the comments something goes DOWN in this game

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): Wow this is really good

**pig-serpent** (9): The type of slow song that always feels like it's battling to hold my attenntion, but is winning that battle handily.

**stryxen** (9): nah cos this could make me cry

**welcome2thejam** (9): Don't know if I'd rate it so high if it didn't soundtrack such an incredible ending, but it is what it is. Anyway, shoutout to Pascal, the funky little robot who deserves the world

**BoneStreetSand** (8.9): Great song, but another immediate shot of depression because it reminds me of the game it's from. Still traumatised.

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is gorgeous

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): yeah this one lives up to the title for sure.

**Chevsapher** (8.4): The songwriting feels like something from a Katy Perry deep cut, but the production is gripping and emotional.

**Roxieloxie** (8): they're right, i am just one girl

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The lyrics are a bit awkward, but I can resonate with the message of this song

**bbfan132** (7.5): very pleasant

**kirby31200** (7.5): Kinda just depressing. I've never been a fan of dismal media where there's no hope and everyone's sad

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7.5): i don't think it's fair to score this one off the english version, whose different lyrics alter the whole message of the song. definitely recommend listening to the japanese version, the singer poured her whole heart into the song and gets so caught up her voice starts to shake near the end of the song and it's a really emotional and touching experience

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i feel your pain girlie let it all out it's okay

**cheatviathan** (7): Solid tune all around. This is one that has been sitting in my “to play” list for a long time. Maybe someday.

# Are you punishing me

**EnCaine** (7): i'm not crazy about the song but i love the context of it in the game

**rslashpoopheads** (7): :sadge:

**seanderlust** (7): fittingly, I feel about this song the way I felt about nier: automata. pretty good, but I really don't see myself returning to it for a while

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): RIP Ayn Rand you would have loved Nier:Automata but probably for the wrong reasons

**Qwilphish** (6.5): nothing that special kind of predictable production

**BebeLuigi** (6): I have a bad memory of not connecting to the online and not being able to finish that part and that last chorus repeating again and again so it annoys me more than anything now dsfsdfs A beautiful song still but I can't listen to it now

**RetrohTanner** (5): Another one that feels like it suffers from me not knowing the context of when it plays in game

**steelstepladder** (5): LOVE Nier, I really really do... This song is just fine

**LesApfels** (4): Whoever wrote these lyrics has clearly never heard of melodic maths

**runaway3212** (4): This wasn't interesting in any way but it was pretty

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i thought it was fun, i liked the beat. So… yeah...

**PhloxInvar** (2.5): It’s a whole bunch of not much to be honest. It’s lacking substance aside from “I’m sad and I have an orchestra to demonstrate.”

Bastion was my first introduction to SuperGiant and what a time it was. This was one of the earliest games from the Indie boom I remember and after playing the game this song stuck with me for a long, long time. The song is played at the end of the game and is a mashup of two of the character tracks from earlier in the game. Everything about it does such a great job tying the tracks together and was honestly in consideration for my 11. A little sad to see it go early.

---

# Setting Sail

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I mean wow, what a good track.

**alexpiercey** (10): truly amazing how good this song is

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really wish there was a pyre soundtrack here but that would probably be too many supergiant games and I don’t remember that game being vocal heavy. I really like the female vocals here and I listened to it while building walls in Minecraft lol.

**nt96** (10): I was NOT ready for this the first time I heard this in the credits. Years later, I’m still not ready. Easily one of the greatest mashups of all time.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (10): the juxtaposition of two separate solos to create more than the sum of its parts is such a fantastic musical device and this is just incredible musically as well as narratively. i don't know the story but i'm tearing up

**Raxxin** (10): i didnt even care about the game that much playing it but this song made me sob

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): Bastion didn’t really grab me like other supergiant games did, but this song is just phenomenal, and hit’s perfectly in the ending

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I didn't fully understand the lyrics at first because of the two vocalists, but I think that's half the point. It's just really good.

**nooodisaster** (9): Beautiful. The vocals on top of each other are so melodically pleasing and just gives me sailing and turncoat vibes

**PhloxInvar** (9): One of my favorite things about Darren Korb’s songs is their roughness. The underlying beat is this kind of grungy, scratchy sound yet somehow it conveys this feeling of melancholy and strife so well, and the feeling of setting sail. Combined with the much more smoother guitars that gives this such a wonderful variety in texture. You see more of this unique style in Transistor, but for his first game, Darren Korb knocked it out of the park with this mash-up.

**runaway3212** (9): I could actually see myself listening to this it's so cozy

**Chevsapher** (8.6): I love the textures, and the intertwined vocal lines make this track distinctive.

**Parkouricus** (8.5): why do all good indie games' soundtracks have their characters with headphones on as the cover?

**Brendon-Urine** (8): the production goes off!

**ManofOranges** (8): Kind of a bop

**NFLfreak98** (8): This is my favorite In Rainbows b-side

**ReallyCreative** (8): cool sound, cool vocals, but I'm very much not in love with the mixing

**RetrohTanner** (8): I love how the two voices play off each other in this. I wish it was longer!

**seanderlust** (8): "build that wall and build it strong" darren korb in his MAGA era

**UltimateDomon** (8): Darren and Ashley duets own my ass

# Going Home

**bbfan132** (7.5): the production was cool, it was a bit too short though

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Intriguing trip hop influences, slightly forgettable vocals

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): This is nice, Once again dont know much about this game, never heard of it but nice song

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute, need to get around to finally playing this

**celladonn** (7): I think Darren's music has improved a lot since Bastion tbh

**cheatviathan** (7): The vocal harmonies are cool, as are the reverby drums. Solid stuff. I have this game, and still haven’t touched it, so make of that what you will.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Well they've definitely improved on the soundtracks in their later games.

**pig-serpent** (7): The vibe on this song is really cool, but I think it loses out to the other supergiant songs in the rate. Also I'm not normally the type of person to complain about Youtube compression but I hope y'all loaded up your streaming service of choice for this song.

**skargardin** (7): This is not my absolute favorite on the soundtrack but it works really well in the context of the ending

**steelstepladder** (7): Build That Wall lowkey deserved

**stryxen** (7): can you say cinematic

**akanewasright** (6.6): Not really something I’d listen to on my own, but still quite nice

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): cute but it drags a bit to me.

**BebeLuigi** (6): It has a huge "protagonist realise the truth" anime vibe haha

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s alright. I’m surprised by how much it sounds like it could be from Hades

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i once gave my 11 to an interlude called coming home, i believe i prefer that

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Like a lot of these songs, this one is great at matching the feeling of playing the game, but doesn't hold up as a song on its own.

**anothertown** (5): Maybe I'll be Tracer I'm already Tracer What about Widowmaker? I'm already Widowmaker I'll be Bastion Nerf Bastion You're right, so, Winston I wanna be Winston I guess I'll be Genji I'm already Genji Then I'll be McCree I already chose McCree I have an idea What's your idea? You should be I'm not gonna be Mercy

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is giving me high school theater kids vibes

**Qwilphish** (5): True background music. The beat is nice but actually no variation which makes it a bit of a slog

**wavingwolves** (4.9): i have no thoughts about this whatsoever

**jayjaysortagay** (4): the singing in this was unpleasant to me

**Alumineous** (3): This rate is divided between good songs and songs that are inflated by nostalgia. And this is the latter.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I actually never made it past the first stage of Bastion because my gaming setup was a MacBook Air with the trackpad so maybe if I’d finished it I’d have more of an emotional connection to it but as it stands this sounds like the kind of music I don’t like. None of the melodies are very interesting and that drum loop or whatever it is just dominates the song in a really bad way

**rslashpoopheads** (2): 2 long 2 emo

And another Persona track falls.  In hindsight this one grew on me quite a bit so I regret not scoring it a little higher. It's got a good groove going on and would be perfect to have in the background in a game. The rap during the verses falls a little flat, but overall it's not a bad song and this is a pretty fair place for it.

# Massive fans

**rslashpoopheads** (11): when I run for President I'm going to make them play this while I walk up to my podium at the debates

**Marshynarsh** (10): babybabybabybabybabybabybabybabybaby

**okbitch** (10): this was my other contender for top spot

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): BABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABYBABY

**stryxen** (9.5): this is a whole banger omg

**endcreditouilles** (9.3): more like Ass Destruction because this song FUCKS

**seanderlust** (9.3): BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY! this is FUNKY.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the number of times i’ve had ‘baby baby’ stuck in my head is not ok

**skargardin** (9): oh YEAH! da da da da.. da da da da da.. oh BABY BABY!!.. so true

**UltimateDomon** (9): Instant hype

**welcome2thejam** (9): For the longest time, I knew exactly one thing about Persona 3, and that one thing was BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY

**Chevsapher** (8.7): The rap is a bit cheesy, but this track has so much crunch. The horns are the my favorite part.

**bbfan132** (8.5): fun production!

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Sounds wack but I like it??

**Parkouricus** (8.5): watching the8bitdrummer has made me expect wario instead of trumpets

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): BABY BABY

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): yo danny fenton he was just 14 when his parents built a very strange machine

**cheatviathan** (8): “Kimi no Kioku” would have been an instant 11, but this is still pretty great. The “babybabybabybabybaby” vocals are iconic.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Wow this one really grabs you from the start? But then it doesn’t really go anywhere, it’s pleasant background noise but kinda flatlines as a song. Still good though

**Qwilphish** (8): persona tracks really do just hit different

**akanewasright** (7.5): I love Danny Phantom!

**kirby31200** (7.5): I think the rapper just woke up. He gives me 4kids theme song vibes while everything else in the song is great

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7.5): the verses are kind of inaudible and uninspiring (eneneneneneneMASS.DESTRUCTION!) but the hook/chorus bangs. BABYBABYABYABAYBABYAYBYBABY (abe shinzo smiling at opacity 30%.jpg)

**wavingwolves** (7.3): [redacted comment]

# Massive damage

**1998tweety** (7): I wish this was doing more for me but its ok

**anothertown** (7): okayy it's giving linkin park a bit

**nooodisaster** (7): It's funky but at what cost?

**nt96** (7): Early 2000s vibes. Love it

**runaway3212** (7): I dont hate it but it feels a bit off

**celladonn** (6.5): BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY BABY

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): I feel like this is going for the same kind of vibe as Funky Dealer but doesn’t do it as well

**ImADudeDuh** (6): im not into scat, sorry.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): bebebebebebebebe

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): forgettable but also OOH YEAH

**AHSWeeknd** (5): What is this chorus oh my god

**BebeLuigi** (5): Falls a bit flat compared to Persona 4 and 5 themes, still good!

**pig-serpent** (5): I mean, I do like horns... But the rapping is cringey 90s dance rap.

**RetrohTanner** (5): I don't like the rap verse on this, the dude just doesn't sound great

**ReallyCreative** (4): the rap isn't bad but it's mixed too low. Everything else requires ibuprofen, and a lot of it

**PhloxInvar** (1): I know most people like this song. It’s the theme song of Persona 3. I hate it. There’s nothing to latch on to for me to like it.

Another track that comes up at the top of a lot of these lists (or really anytime anyone even says the works "Tony Hawk") but this one is 100% deserved! Ska was probably best left in the 90's but in terms of the energy this song brings it's hard not to bop along.

---

# Superman

**cheatviathan** (10): Actually listening through the Pro Skater 1 soundtrack for the first time made me realize just how much this track sticks out considering how heavy the rest of it is. I’d still call “Police Truck” my favorite from that game, but this is still an excellent piece of ska that I will always shout along and pick it up to, regardless of the circumstances.

**endcreditouilles** (10): fun fact, this song is technically an arrangement of Canon In D. Sorry Pachelbel, remix outsold

**ManofOranges** (10): YUP YUP YUP

**nt96** (10): For a song that exemplified summer vacation, the lyrics really hit you when you’re older. It’s also crazy to think the THPS1 only had 11 songs, felt like it went on forever.

**Parkouricus** (10): THIS IS A LEGITIMATE MASTERPIECE THOUGH. SKA PUNK FOR LIFE!!

**Raxxin** (10): SKA IS NEVER GONNA DIE

**steelstepladder** (10): THE NOSTALGIA

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hopefully, y'all rated this well and it has a good average score, but if not, then this 10 should certainly Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!

**bbfan132** (9): it gives me late 90s cali stoner vibes in a great way

**RandomHypnotica** (9): man i miss ska

**UltimateDomon** (9): I wish I was cool enough to skate

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): my first ever video game was Tony Hawk for the GameBoy Color that my parents gave me and when I saw that my friend got Pokemon I cried

**Chevsapher** (8.3): I wasn't impressed at first, but the songwriting pulled me in.

**ReallyCreative** (8): Tony Hawk's Pro Ska-ter

**seanderlust** (7.5): this guy's voice kind of sounds like weird al

# Superman 64

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ska is camp for straight people

**TragicKingdom1** (7): tbh for the first minute i thought this was simlish too

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Superman is the hottest superhero, haters can choke

**nyoom** (6): i thought this would be IF.I.GO.CRA-ZY THEN WOULD YOU.STILL.CALL ME SU-PERMAN and i'm not sure if i'm disappointed that it wasn't but anyway i don't like it edit: you know what, this is kinda growing on me, sounds like sunshine and reminds me of my brief ska-adjacent phase in middle school

**RetrohTanner** (6): Ska!

**sarcasticsobs** (4): you can’t make me like ska no matter how hard you try, even by throwing “punk” into it

**AHSWeeknd** (2): unnecessarily loud.

CHVRCHES really knocks it out of the park with their video game music huh. First Mirror's Edge and now Death Stranding. The game itself never really intrigued me much tbh, but I'm so glad that it spawned this track at the very least. I'm a little surprised it's going now, but again, the competition is pretty fierce now so we're bound to get some rough cuts.

---

# Delivery!

**bbfan132** (10): love this, chvrches at their best

**BebeLuigi** (10): Also my favourite CHVRCHES song!

**hikkaru** (10): probably the best chvrches song since every open eye and i say that as a love is dead defender

**ManofOranges** (10): Touching in a very inexplicable way

**nooodisaster** (10): These lyrics make as much sense as the game.

**Parkouricus** (10): this would've changed my entire life at age 13. GODLIKE

**PhloxInvar** (10): The vocals make it feel like a Winx Club song.

**shhhneak** (10): This is such an unexpectedly gorgeous song for the most batshit crackedt game of all time.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I really love this

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): This is the best CHVRCHES song they've released since 2016 honestly

**cyborglilith** (9): the mv is beautiful

**1998tweety** (8.5): wait i wasnt expecting this to be good

**stryxen** (8.5): CVLTVRAL RESET

**Chevsapher** (8.3): The best parts are the verse melodies and the prolonged chords.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.2): Could listen to this any time. Great song.

**Awkward\_King** (8): i think i want to like chvrches more than i actually like chvrches :/// having said that, this is one of my favourite chvrches songs i've heard

**ImADudeDuh** (8): chvrches can you please make good music again. Please i am begging and i am borrowing. Just give me a song that is as good as the album tracks on every open eye, thats all i ask. Its not a big ask. Please please please.

**kirby31200** (8): The first Strand type song

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I would like to be stranded with CHVRCHES

# Drone delivery preferred

**bigbigbee** (7.5): This is like way too long, right? I like CHVRCHES and this is not one of their best.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): god bless the intern who made this lyric video and had to shove in all these clips of a freaky baby

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): it's fine I guess

**2dina3dworld** (7): this song just lacks the “oomph” that would make it go from good to great. I think the vocals are the main factor behind this lack of “oomph”, they’re too sweet and soft and the emotion isn’t as raw as I’d like it to be.

**akanewasright** (7): Lauren Mayberry i am free on friday on friday i am free in [undisclosed location in the US] i am free Lauren Mayberry to eat lunch i am free Lauren Mayberry on friday

**anothertown** (7): there was so much hype and news about this game before it came out but then i didn't hear anything after release.. did no one play it or

**cheatviathan** (7): Lauren kills it as per usual, but instrumentally, there’s nothing for me to latch onto. Given how long the track is, and how many extended breaks there are, that’s a problem. Still better than a significant chunk of Love Is Dead, tho.

**nt96** (7): I’ve never been into CHVRCHES, but it’s a great song.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7): this is...not what i expected the theme to Death Stranding to sound like. it's pretty and does kind of get me in my feelings, but it also feels a bit too upbeat for its lyrics, and i think it would have worked better with the themes of the game as a slower (not necessarily sadder) song. maybe something more cautiously hopeful.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): I miss this style of Chvrches songs

**steelstepladder** (7): I prefer Elephant Stranding

**welcome2thejam** (7): Just gotta appreciate fellow CHVRCHES fan Hideo Kojima just going out and living his dreams

**Qwilphish** (6.5): nothing particularly game-y about it which is a bummer. but not a bad song by any means

**wavingwolves** (6.5): every time i hear this i like it more but i also never feel like i want to listen to this

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I thought this was a super dark game

**celladonn** (6): Ludens outsold

**EnCaine** (6): i like the percussion a lot but the rest of the song is whatever

**N454545** (6): I like it.

**pig-serpent** (6): Chvrches have made much better, but I suppose they have also made much worse.

**skargardin** (6): This isn't bad by any means but I can't help but compare this to Warning Call that is just perfection

**waluigiest** (6): It feels longer than it stays interesting for

**CrimsonROSET** (5): yeah this is exactly what I expected from a song called Death Stranding for the video game Death Stranding

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): ehh nothing’s really standing out to me

**cremeebrulee** (4): i’m a fan of long songs but this one is one that feels like it doesn’t go anywhere with the runtime it has

**RetrohTanner** (4): I feel like this one suffers a lot from me not having played the game so not really getting the context or emotion behind it

**UltimateDomon** (4): Maybe I'd like this more if I played the game but its pretty boring

**runaway3212** (3): Girl I wish you'd take my ears so I didnt have to listen to this

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Very overproduced and does little to justify its running time. And I just don't get the appeal of CHVRCHES in general.

This song (and game) is a trip. Yet it somehow all works? I really have no idea how to describe it otherwise. It's an interesting song for sure, so I'm glad popheads didn't cut it day 1. This was actually top 10 / day 3 for a good amount of May, but the later ballots (and a 0) brought it down to day 2.

**anothertown** (10): this soundtrack may be my alltime favorite album.... perhaps....

**bbfan132** (10): easy 10, excellent production and great song overall

**cheatviathan** (10): It’s an irresistible sugar rush of a track that stays enthralling through the entirety of its six minute runtime. The propulsive drumwork, the horn stabs, the infectious backing vocals. It all coalesces into the perfect soundtrack for rolling up entire continents into a ball.

**cremeebrulee** (10): fuck /u/runaway3212

**cyborglilith** (10): Mozart could never

**Marshynarsh** (10): This song was the reason I bought the game

**Qwilphish** (10): i believe in katamari supremacy

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this walked so Calum Bowen could run

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is another fun one that I like but I do have to once again remind myself that the songs arent long but rather the scenes in the space they are meant to occupy are

**steelstepladder** (10): Throwback to when I played the wrong version of this in beatsense

**UltimateDomon** (10): Katamari Damacy has my favorite soundtrack of any video game, the whole thing is incredible

**LesApfels** (9.5): Simply iconic

**PhloxInvar** (9.5): Lonely Rolling Star is more popular, and rightly so. BUT THIS. This is Katamari in its essence.

**BebeLuigi** (9): Love how it manages to sound so coherent but so messy at the same time, definitely set the tone as to what Katamari is as a game

**CrimsonROSET** (9): a katamari on the rocks sounds delicious honestly

**EnCaine** (9): the only lalala/nanana hook greater than this is can't get you outta my head

**nooodisaster** (9): https://xkcd.com/851_make_it_better/

**nt96** (9): Very fun!!!

**pig-serpent** (9): This song feels like it's borrowing elements from punk and breakbeat, but also I hear a lot of early prog with the horns and Yes-esque harmonies. Yeah, ok.

**seanderlust** (9): AU where new directions sang this song at sectionals and everyone cheered and they won first place and brittany was immediately installed as President of the United States because of it

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is fun omg

**Parkouricus** (8.5): man... katamari damacy was right. don't worry do your best :pensive:

**wavingwolves** (8.1): bawp

**Chevsapher** (8): There's so much happening here, but somehow, it works.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Can I just take a moment to say that I’m baffled by the fact that when they ported this game to the Switch they made no effort to make the controls more user friendly? What was up with that? Anyways this song is so iconic but I can’t say it’s the kind of thing I’d want to listen to casually

**skargardin** (8): I'm bopping!!

**1998tweety** (7): this is ok

**Awkward\_King** (7): why is random ps2 music so elite

**ImADudeDuh** (7): im bopping a bit

**letsallpoo** (7): this game was weird

**rslashpoopheads** (7): stream Brave Girls - Rollin

**slimboyfriend** (7): am I high

**stryxen** (7): I was hating it until it got good we love a prog rock moment

# Stuck in the Katamari

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Should have been shorter.

**fadedblue09** (6): There are some fun moments in the instrumental but there's little of interest considering the length

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): uhhhhh this song kinda stresses me out lol

**AHSWeeknd** (3): there’s a lot to digest

**N454545** (3): Maybe I just don't get it

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (3): more like crapamari damashit

**pietrohonkhonk** (3): Boring, this did not need to be 6 minutes long

**ReallyCreative** (3): Could I get that tron, could I get that remy? Could I get that coke, could I get that henny? Could I get that Katamari on the rock rock rocks? can I get salt all around that rim, rim, rim, rim?

**2dina3dworld** (1): this sounds like a cross between the worst of the Mario Kart and the Sonic songs

**runaway3212** (0): I literally cant describe how much I hate this

There's an easy reason why this is far above the rest of the Final Fantasy tracks ~~and it's balladphobia~~. Mostly joking, but this song is such a bop that it's hard not to place a notch above the rest of the FF franchise. (this was robbed a bit tho)

---

# Stream Emotion

**anothertown** (10): is this camp?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): THAT GUITAR SOLO OUT OF NOWHERE? Just take my soul!

**Marshynarsh** (10): what. a. bop. Yuna is top pop girl (hot take x-2 is a good game)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): AND THOUGH, I KNOW, THE WORLD OF REAL EMOTION HAS SURROUNDED ME, I WON’T GIVE IN TO IT! This was the runner up for my 11, this is peak 2000's pop perfection, infectious lyrics, that absolutely insane guitar and the driving beat are just so incredibly fun, and it's one of the most iconic Video Game opening songs ever imo

**Raxxin** (10): what is it about pop songs named Emotion being masterpieces hmm

**seanderlust** (10): remember when leblanc catfished as yuna and put on a banger of a concert where she only sang one song and left but the song was so goddamn good that nobody cared? can ariana do that? can taylor? can gaga? I didn't THINK so.

**stryxen** (9.5): this is almost perfect but there’s something about the recording i don’t love and i can’t place it. Anyway the guitar section cutting out into silence before the chorus kicks in again… that part is a whole 11

**Awkward\_King** (9): this bops

**BoneStreetSand** (9): Only reason why it isn't a 10 is because it makes me feel like a weeaboo again and I don't know if I like that.

**N454545** (9): It slaps.

**nt96** (9): I remember seeing this on G4 and falling in love with it. Years later, I still do.

**Roxieloxie** (9): oh now this is a bop

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Some weird funk fused with J-pop, and I surprisingly liked it! But yeah, obviously this was meant to be sung in Japanese

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This sounds like a B-side from a late ‘90s/early ‘00s (one hit wonder) teen pop star but like… that’s actually a compliment if you think about it. Like this could easily have been a Tata Young cut, legends only

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This game was a strung out twink's fever dream, but fake Yuna served everything here. Yuna really said "I just watched my boyfriend evaporate into the void after we killed his dad but now I wanna be a pop star!"

**Chevsapher** (8.4): Is Final Fantasy gatekeeping emotion? Carly Rae Jepsen would like a word.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**akanewasright** (8): This is a bop and a nice change of pace!

**cheatviathan** (8): With the other pieces of FF representation being low-key ballads and a “Stand by Me” cover, I was not expecting a bop like this to be lurking amongst them. The grooves are tight, the vocal performance is passionate enough to keep me engaged, and there’s even a cheeky guitar solo in the bridge.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this makes me think of Carly Rae Jepsen

**nooodisaster** (8): Finally a Final Fantasy bop!!!

**skargardin** (8): WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU

**welcome2thejam** (8): Hopefully hearing this will finally get me in the mood to finish FFX, so I can move on to Duel Wielding Pop Idol Yuna

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): what can I do for you?

**UltimateDomon** (7.5): I like the mid-2000s J-pop vibe of this game a lot

**bbfan132** (7): fun song to listen to while playing, probably

**ImADudeDuh** (7): tbh I think we should’ve rated the original version of this instead of the English version. Still a bop tho

**Parkouricus** (7): jesus christ the contrast between ffx and this LOL kinda goes hard though

**pig-serpent** (7): This one has a pretty cool beat and it's easy to bob along to.

**Qwilphish** (7): lizzie mcguire soundtrack teas

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): so many key changes

**wavingwolves** (7): "what i can do for you? i can kill you'' THEN DO IT

# Prefers Dedicated

**AHSWeeknd** (6): is this Chromatica 😍?

**Alumineous** (6): Nice break from the ballads, but it's missing that extra special sauce.

**jayjaysortagay** (6): this is giving me S Club 7

**ReallyCreative** (6): an odd title given the fact that I don't really feel any emotions listening to it

**RetrohTanner** (6): Stan main pop girl Yuna of Besaid Island

**turtle\_on\_mars** (6): what can i do for you?? give me any actual emotion??

**celladonn** (5.5): Yuna main pop girl but this is a bit of a mess lol

**BebeLuigi** (5): A bit whatever to me

**runaway3212** (5): a bit too busy

**rslashpoopheads** (4): a lot of video game music sounds very 90s in a bad way

**waluigiest** (3): despite the title this is such an emotionless performance

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (1): this inspired a Real Emotion in me. that emotion was fury. official theme of the employee following you around the store

Why did a medival fantasy game decide to have a weird electronic-based song as the theme? We may never know. But it's so much fun that I'll let it slide. I kind of prefer the ending version, but this one seemed more popular which is why it's here. Gonna be honest I'm pretty surprised (and glad) that it even made it this far. Also Blue Lions > other houses I will not be taking any alternate opinions

# Crimson Flower

**agentofscranton** (10): edelgard goddess - the original girlboss

**CrimsonROSET** (10): BE stans DNI

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this SLAPS! I handed out this ten in like the first thirty seconds of the song and it held onto it for the whole thing, I’m a sucker for a song with a stirring string arrangement like this

**lolcevan** (10): god-shattering star outsold tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (10): an absolute masterpiece of a soundtrack, and an incredible song. Oh also, Crimson Flower > all other routes

**rslashpoopheads** (10): most iconic dubstep performance of all time, Skrillex could never

**PhloxInvar** (9.8): Whoever mixed the vocals really did not do it right. But aside from that, this song’s incredible.

**Parkouricus** (9.5): EXCUSE ME WHAT DO YOU MEAN FIRE EMBLEM HAS A DNB SONG? YOU'RE LYING. WHAT. whoa these lyrics are sad

**BoneStreetSand** (9.1): Currently playing this game and this song makes me feel some kind of way. Mostly depressed. Dimitri looks great with an eyepatch.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): went off

**Alumineous** (9): Anthemic is what this is.

**astrologicalangel** (9): this is absolutely not the point but I just want to state, for the record, that Claude can 100% get it any day of the week

**endcreditouilles** (9): REACH FOR MY HAAAND *bass DROP

**sarcasticsobs** (9): edelgard did nothing wrong

**1998tweety** (8.5): Lost In Thoughts All Alone, this is cute tho

**nooodisaster** (8.5): e-mo-tion

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (8.5): i'm sure all these songs are more meaningful and impactful in the context of their associated games, but i really appreciate in particular the insight this song offers into >!edelgard's psyche as a seventeen-year-old whose convictions have led her to start a war that will destroy every softness and peace she's found at last.!< i would not have chosen "in cherished halls" but the slight shake in "i fear the edge of dawn" makes it hit so hard

**seanderlust** (8.5): it bangs, but also feels kind of long

**bigbigbee** (8): This, like most songs written for Japanese, has a bit of an awkward cadence in English. However, I think that this is only partially true for this song (where its' true for the entire song for other things in this playlist), the melody is nice, and I really like the line "I fear the edge of dawn".

**N454545** (8): it slaps

**Raxxin** (8): edelgard stans rise up

**rotating3Dtext** (8): wub wub

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): CLAUDE WHY WON’T YOU MARRY MEEE ahem anyways this song is really good. Throwing EDM into orchestral music is a very questionable choice, but I think they find the right balance between the two

**Chevsapher** (7.9): The production is massive! If only the songwriting wasn't so clunky.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this definitely improves by the end of the song

**kirby31200** (7.5): Good but also kind of the typical grandiose video game song

**stryxen** (7.5): VERY fire emblem core

# Silver Snow

**ImADudeDuh** (7): what genre is this

**shhhneak** (7): Never played Three Houses but you will still catch me worshipping at Edelgard’s feet.

**slimboyfriend** (7): Lyrics from JRPG songs are so dramatic and for WHAT

**bbfan132** (6.5): kind of forgettable to me

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): i love this game but this song has never done much for me

**BebeLuigi** (6): It sounds so much like an opening of a slice of life anime that the english makes it very weird to me sdfqsdfs The last part is great!

**Roxieloxie** (6): eh not bad but not my favorite thing ever

**runaway3212** (6): I don't like that it feels like its not going anywhere

**steelstepladder** (6): Not bad but theres 10 songs that sound exactly like this in the rate and this isn't one of the better ones. The main theme deserved

**wavingwolves** (6): if this was a little bit shorter it probably would get a higher score

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I know nothing about this, but this SO obviously feels like one of those "originally in Japanese, but force-translated into English" songs. Shame cuz the vocalist sounds great.

**akanewasright** (5): this feels like the Walmart version of an anime song.

**cheatviathan** (5): It’s a remarkable feat that, despite an instrumental that swells and shifts with regularity, this song makes for exceptionally ignorable background music.

**pig-serpent** (5): This is an anime OP I watch for the first 3 episodes and say that it's fine but end up skipping it for the remaining 23 episodes because it feels much longer than it really is and I'm never in the mood to listen to it.

**Qwilphish** (5): i dont remember this production in fire emblem?? lmfao this is WILD in perhaps not the best way

**ReallyCreative** (5): this goes back and forth between being embarrassingly bad and kinda iconic and it ends up somewhere in the middle

**RetrohTanner** (5): Why is this the style of song they made for medieval strategy waifu simulator

**skargardin** (5): I'm not really too fond of this and I can't really say why

**Awkward\_King** (4): her voice is kinda doing absolutely nothing for me im sorry

**UltimateDomon** (4): I feel like the vocals don't fit well with the song

This track breaks me in the context of the game. Even outside of it it's such a heartfelt track that makes the sadness so relatable. I mean it must do a pretty good job to get 4 11's. 

---

# Doing A-OK :' (

**alexpiercey** (11): I gave my eleven out already but I had to go back and change it when this started playing. What an absolutely beautiful, emotionally devastating game and song.

**celladonn** (11): This song is very special to me. Part of it is that this game, and the song's use in it, absolutely broke me and had me bawling, but the song's hold on me has lingered long after the game. The lyrics hit me in a very personal way and make me very emotional.

**cyborglilith** (11): oh my fucking god. I thought Utada had my 11 on lock but this song is just so emotive, it's unbearable.

**pig-serpent** (11): This song is comfort in sonic form. I don't think there's a situation where I wouldn't calm down and fell peace upon immedatly listening to the beautiful piano playing and right amount of lofi fuzz on this song. I have a feeling it's not going to do super well in the rate, and I just want to ask anyone who was lukewarm on this track to check it out again after the rate while staring up at the night sky and see if it wins you over.

**Alumineous** (10): Yes, I'm crying.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): no but this made me cry for some reason? wtf

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m *such* a sucker for space imagery in lyrics and the sheer sentimentality of this one really does it for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck, not this song reminding me of when I would watch P*wd**p**.

**N454545** (10): Don't remind meeeee. This is traumatic. Everything is NOT alright. :'(

**nt96** (10): Absolutely Beautiful. I’ll be very upset if this doesn’t make the top 10.

**PhloxInvar** (10): The Markiplier cover version by Emily Scholz is better, but the original is also pretty great. It’s really fun to sing, particularly because the lyrics are just really well written.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): To the Moon is on my list of games I really need to play, and this song has bumped it up a few spots, it's REALLY pretty

**steelstepladder** (10): If this gets robbed I will cry harder than the ending of To The Moon

**Parkouricus** (9.5): ;-;

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): This is so pretty actually.

**hikkaru** (9): gorgeous... a game i still haven't played that is rotting in my steam library i fear, i really need to get on it. maybe when i feel like crying

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Oh my god this is so pretty… and sad…

**Chevsapher** (8.8): Simple but sweet.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): what this so pretty for tf

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Wish the lyrics on this weren't so awkward because I think the melody is gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous

**Marshynarsh** (8.5): I played this 7 years ago and I'm still not ready to play it again

**2dina3dworld** (8): Time to have a cry to this, I guess

**fadedblue09** (8): Lovely vocals, solemn instrumentation. The contrast between this and Zombies on Your Lawn display her versatility well

**ManofOranges** (8): I'm suspending my balladphobia for this one <3

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this thing destroyed me back then

**rslashpoopheads** (8): :sadge:

**runaway3212** (8): super heartfelt and good

**wavingwolves** (7.5): soothing

**BebeLuigi** (7): It's a lovely track!

**cheatviathan** (7): On a scale from “Astronaut in the Ocean” by Masked Wolf to “Space Oddity” by David Bowie, I give this “The Commander Thinks Aloud” by The Long Winters.

**nooodisaster** (7): V wholesome :)

**skargardin** (7): such a gorgeous, simplistic piano ballad. Fits the vibe of the game so well

**slimboyfriend** (7): we love a heartfelt Disney princess-esque ballad

**UltimateDomon** (7): This is nice

**bbfan132** (6): nice song to fall asleep to

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (6): it's pretty i guess but it's giving me nothing, kind of a drugstore gregory and the hawk aesthetic why are the lyrics so awkward i thought this was a translated cover

**ReallyCreative** (6): Phoebe Bridgers's voice getting swallowed up by a piano is NOT alright

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Bayonetta’s moon song outsold.

**waluigiest** (5): to to to to the moon

**Qwilphish** (3): im sure this songs usage in the game is breathtaking, but with no context this does nothing for me

I have still yet to play Life Is Strange, so maybe I don't have the right attachment to this track yet, but even then it's still a gorgeous song. I've heard amazing things about the whole soundtrack so it would've been difficult to have a vocal rate without it. In hindsight I would've score this as a 10 with all the other bonus tracks.

---

# Life is good

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This is my least favorite of the four LiS songs I consider iconic (along with Mt. Washington, To All Of You and Spanish Sahara), but it's still a 10. This game traumatized me beyond repair, lmao.

**NFLfreak98** (10): Honorary 11. No song gives me a great feeling of nostalgia

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i adore this song, and the LiS soundtrack truly defined part of my taste, it's such an incredible soundtrack and i love it to bits (although I wish we were rating To All of You or Spanish Sahara instead, those are the highlights of the soundtrack imo)

**steelstepladder** (10): The guitar is so beautiful and the way the entire song builds around the main riff... ugh perfect

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): stream marina - life is strange

**BoneStreetSand** (9.7): Only not a 10 because the song's audio sounds better in-game.

**seanderlust** (9.5): the lyrics on this are just gorgeous.

**Alumineous** (9): I think the reason why I haven't heard this song before is because YouTubers remove the songs due to copyright. If I heard this in the true ending, I would probably start crying. Great choice of music by whoever at DONTNOD.

**EnCaine** (9): the soundtrack is the one thing that life is strange really got right

**Parkouricus** (9): somehow both cute and overwhelming

**stryxen** (9): :’)

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The atmosphere is palpable.

**bbfan132** (8.5): beautiful song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): this was such a cool game that completely failed to stick the landing

**ImADudeDuh** (8): come on, coming of age soundtrack

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a cute buildup

**UltimateDomon** (8): This song is a lot more enjoyable than Life is Strange

**AHSWeeknd** (7): production could’ve been better

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): This fits the game perfectly

**welcome2thejam** (7): Hmmm, jury is still out on whether or not this gets me ready for the mosh pit, shaka brah

# Blocked by obstacles

**luckyphase** (6): au revoir i bet you dont even know what that means

**rslashpoopheads** (5): ok

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (2): i wish i'd foreseen this obstacle

YESS. This is a full retro bop! In fact the whole soundtrack is really stellar. Even people who didn't like the rest of the sonic music might have enjoyed this change of pace. The fact that it's placing this low is criminal. It was day 3 for a portion of the rate, but it wasn't meant to last.

# Sunny Day

**1998tweety** (10): i just know this song is gonna get robbed even though its so iconic

**akanewasright** (10): This is europop perfection

**anothertown** (10): my god

**bbfan132** (10): :puggofast3:

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): what the fuck, I listened to the Sonic songs section backwards for some reason and this was such a nice change of pace from the more rock tinged songs that preceded it, my ass began shaking when I heard that house beat. I really like this one! The controlled chaos of the production perfectly captures the vibe of Mr. The Hedgehog at his best, you really feel like you’re running through space so fast that it feels like you’re drifting in slow motion.

**hikkaru** (10): YASS GRENADE YASS AIRSTRIKE GAY ANTHEM

**LesApfels** (10): A super hyper megabop

**Qwilphish** (10): im racing through the city just listening to it. playing it must be absolutely euphoric

**RandomHypnotica** (10): at the time of writing this, i'm in a stage 4 lockdown so no, i cannot feel the sunshine

**steelstepladder** (10): Give this a 10 or Tails Doll will kill you

**UltimateDomon** (10): This song makes me feel like life is worth living

**waluigiest** (10): Omg as a child I used to rent this game from our local movie store and just dance to all of the music while “racing” I was such a gay little boy

**nt96** (9.5): I can feel the 90s, that’s for sure :’)

**Parkouricus** (9.5): THIS GAME HAS FIVE TRACKS. BUT IT GOES SO HARD AT EVERY MOMENT. YOU CAN BEAT THIS GAME IN 30 MINUTES AND IT WILL BE THE GREATEST 30 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE

**Chevsapher** (9): Late 90s dance music is my kryptonite, apparently. The manic drums and swirling synths are perfect for a racing game. The songwriting is a little clunky, but not enough to detract from the overall effect.

**Roxieloxie** (9): :daisybop:

**seanderlust** (9): they really captured the musical equivalent of "gotta go fast" here

**EnCaine** (8.6): this is camp

**BebeLuigi** (8): love how much it screams 90s

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the bpm on this one sounds messed up, which funny because sonic haha

**nooodisaster** (8): Gets points for being aggressively wholesome I frickin love it. i CAN feel the sunshine :D

**runaway3212** (8): I wish I could feel the fucking sunshine it's been nothing but cloudy here in the netherlands

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): very Mario Kart esque lol

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Kinda tiring for the first few minutes but the last 2 minutes are heaven

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): running in the 90s

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): if u think about it, sonic popularized chiptune

**2dina3dworld** (7): it’s winter, I cannot feel the sunshine

**BoneStreetSand** (7): I only stan Sonic Heroes.

**cheatviathan** (7): I do have somewhat of an appreciation for this soundtrack. The game is absolutely abysmal, but these songs are dated in just the right way to keep me engaged. I’m not going to call this great or transcendent, and rhyming “alive” with “survive” is on par with “fire” and “desire”, but this is a fun piece of junk food music.

**ManofOranges** (7): OMG THIS SONG. The way this was actually locked away in memory just waiting to be exhumed like a corpse with an ancient jewel

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I'm walking on sunshine

**stryxen** (7): i feel like this might really grow on me but atm i just think it’s quite good and the last 2 minutes are excellent

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This song cured my depression… then gave me anxiety

# Rain Dance

**wavingwolves** (6.6): i have vitamin d deficiency

**astrologicalangel** (6): catchy, but oh my gosh the rhyme scheme is so basic

**cremeebrulee** (6): no i cant im depressed actually

**skargardin** (6): My sonic scores are going to pretty middling I fear. I just have never had any connection or interest with the franchise or its music really. This is just okay for me.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): interesting

**Awkward\_King** (5): i can its bloody hot rn

**pig-serpent** (5): It's like a lame Rainbow Road with lame new age pop vocals? At the least it's fairly energetic and it has a nice chorus.

**Raxxin** (5): overrated

**ReallyCreative** (4): the synth line is cool but these lyrics and this vocal delivery... the only thing I can feel is embarrassed

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (3): if i had to choose between living in darkness forever or hearing this song every time i step into the sun i guess i'd have to design my sonic molesona

**RetrohTanner** (2): Too long!

I really underestimated how much of a bop the Rhythm Heaven soundtrack is. This is a ton of fun to bop along to and I can only imagine how much fun it'd be to play in time with the song. Unfortunately most of the video versions of this song are shortened, cause otherwise they're a ton of fun to watch. Like the others gone today so far, this was pretty solidly day 2 for most of the rate

---

# Heaven

**akanewasright** (10): I want a music video

**Alumineous** (10): I am thinking of many, many dance routines to this song.

**anothertown** (10): yup! yup!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): if mitski sang these lyrics, the gays would cry

**PhloxInvar** (10): Honestly, Rhythm Heaven deserved more than one song in this rate, but I’ll take it.

**Qwilphish** (10): the beginning made my ears bleed but it turned into such a bop im seriously impressed

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Rhythm Heaven is such an amazing series, largley because of the fantastic soundtrack and inventive rhythm game sections, and this song is a highlight.

**Raxxin** (10): doesnt sound as good without the badminton cat adlibs but still a ten

**stryxen** (10): wouldn’t mind this winning

**1998tweety** (9): SMASHA

**cheatviathan** (9): Always psyched to see Rhythm Heaven representation in a rate like this. The flurries of synth, the bouncy basswork, and above all, that impassioned vocal performance, make it a worthy addition to the rate.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I will neither confirm or deny I’ve sang this with someone over discord karaoke once.

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): What can I do, what can I do

**runaway3212** (9): super catchy and fun

**Chevsapher** (8.8): I was obsessed with this game in high school, and I'm delighted that this song still holds up. It's radio-worthy pop, with with that distinctly quirky Rhythm Heaven flair.

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): banger.

**Parkouricus** (8.5): this bounce!! THIS BOUNCE!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I wish this had a killer bridge or something because that would really take it to the next level… that’s the problem with some of these video game songs, some of them are intended to be *functional* so they miss out on opportunities to take it up a notch as songs because it might be distracting

**hikkaru** (8): I've only played the one on ds but this is a nice bop

**ManofOranges** (8): Now wait a minute this is a hit

**nooodisaster** (8): damn like... emotion??? bop???

**bbfan132** (7.5): kind of bops

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Cute bitty production and solid vocals elevate these trite lyrics.

**wavingwolves** (7.1): not great but good

**pig-serpent** (7): Pretty cool song.

**UltimateDomon** (7): Listening to Rhythm Heaven songs without all the minigame sound effects feels weird

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Not my favorite Rhythm Heaven song, but it is pretty catchy!

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): nice

# ... or hell

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it starts really strong but it doesn't really do anything from there

**jayjaysortagay** (6): every video game session singer has this voice

**seanderlust** (6): this feels fairly mid-tier. fun, but not something I would seek out

**steelstepladder** (6): Frog chorus deserved

**BebeLuigi** (5): Quite forgettable

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (5): girl dump his ass

**AHSWeeknd** (3): This ain’t it

**rslashpoopheads** (1): like warioware but bad

This was an amazing discovery from the thread I had never ever heard of (song or game). But the track sounds so refined that despite being a man and not being pop it still managed to rank past half of the other tracks. It was even day 3 for a brief 2 ballots!

# Countryheads

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is actually good though.

**anothertown** (10): fuck taylor swift this has a great bridge

**CrimsonROSET** (10): my favorite discovery of the rate, no doubts.

**endcreditouilles** (10): simple and stunning

**pig-serpent** (10): I'm happy that indiependant video games are keeping true country music alive. These loner ballads are some powerful stuff, and I'm positive that the "I listen to everything except country" wouldn't be as common if mainstream country music was as powerful and move as this song.

**seanderlust** (10): i'm a sucker for dark bluegrass tunes about preparing for death

**Chevsapher** (9.8): This is the rate's hidden gem. It cuts right to your soul.

**steelstepladder** (9.7): This fucks wow

**cremeebrulee** (9): this cover art is gorgeous omg mayhaps i will check this game out

**nooodisaster** (9): my fucking god! these bitches yeehaw! good for them! good for them!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Welp, add another game I'm now interested in thanks to a song off the soundtrack

**bigbigbee** (8.5): If all country music sounded like this I would be a certified countryhead. I love dark, folk-y country about life and history etc.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I have a soft spot for the Americana genre so I like this quite a bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I submitted this one and I’m really glad it got voted in… mostly because I like the game, I think it was a really unique experience and I’ve never heard of any other video game quite like it. This song is pretty but I’ve heard it like ninety times because you spend so much of this game roaming across empty stretches of map listening to it so it’s hard for me to have much of an emotional reaction to it at this point.

**EnCaine** (8.2): positive yeehaw

**ImADudeDuh** (8): nice

**Parkouricus** (8): pretty gorgeous in that very specific way! sad lyrics

**rslashpoopheads** (8): reminds me of The Decemberists in a good way

**skargardin** (8): Hold on, this is such a nice discovery. The cover art for this game really intrigues me

**UltimateDomon** (8): Sad country boy songs make me wish I was a gay cowboy

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This song is very simplistic and yet I can feel the abundance of emotion coming from the singer and the lyrics

**1998tweety** (7): this is cute

**cheatviathan** (7): A solid, stripped back piece of acoustic outlaw country balladry. Looking at this game’s Steam page has me intrigued. Might have to pick this one up when I have disposable income.

**runaway3212** (7): not terrible but not great

# Misandryheads

**plastichaxan** (6.8): don't mind me i'm just imagining how much better this would sound if it was an orville peck song

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): [pretty, just not particularly my style, and it feels like it just never progresses

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): Jesus is a gay icon, not because he died for our sins and came back from the dead or whatever, but because he can turn water into wine. We love a walking box of Franzia, and the life of every party

**stryxen** (6.8): this being the final song in the playlist feels so so so right

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s fine

**Qwilphish** (6): popheads cant get me to listen to country [2] but this one is better

**BebeLuigi** (5): quite similar to the RDR osts except that it doesn't work as well I fear

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (4): every time i hear a song like this all i ever think is "this narrator's probably racist" sorry bout it

ROBBBBED

Anyways otherwise this is right where I'd expect one of the rate's most controversial tracks. At least it picked up an 11 this time after so many promises were broken during Charity Rate 2. Yeah it's cheesy, but it goes in on it 100%! This opening is one of the most iconic ones I can remember and precisely for that reason! Wish it made day 3, but I wasn't optimistic.

---

# Knows the words and can join in too!

**bbfan132** (11): yes.

**nt96** (11): This game was the pinnacle of my childhood and this song is the best. Anyone who says otherwise can fight me thx :)

**1998tweety** (10): i dont even have to explain this, obvious 10

**agentofscranton** (10): 'he has no style he has no grace this kong has a funny face' if that ain't me

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Deserves to be in the Library of Congress

**akanewasright** (10): Perfection

**anothertown** (10): happy pride to tha crew

**Awkward\_King** (10): AND THEN THERE'S CHUNKY, HE'S DEAD. D K, CHUNKY'S DEAD.

**BebeLuigi** (10): Unironically slap

**BoneStreetSand** (10): Pure brilliance. The stakes are unbearably high, the characters’ motives are unclear, and morality is knotty, but there is a central force you can feel steering every moment.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): it's a classic, what else can you say?

**cremeebrulee** (10): TAKE IT TO THE FRIDGE TOP 5

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ‘take it to the fridge’ instead of bridge i mean how can you not stan

**endcreditouilles** (10): E X P A N D D O N G

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this cured my depression

**jayjaysortagay** (10): my name is Kong and I like to rap, when I hit the bong I don't take no crap. My stylings so fly you can't believe, if you don't like me then suck on deez. Worddd.

**koopaastroopas** (10): (I can’t not)

**ManofOranges** (10): You bet your ass I go apeshit listening to this

**plastichaxan** (10): walnuts peanuts deez...

**ReallyCreative** (10): never forget the Charity Rate where this was submitted, everyone said they would give it their 11, and it received no 11s

**Roxieloxie** (10): D K DONKEY KONG, CAN YOU BELIEVE WE RATED THIS IN THE TRANS RIGHTS CHARITY RATE AND IT DIDNT EVEN LEAVE DAY 1??? ITS PRIDE MONTH YOU ALL BETTER LET THIS WIN

**rslashpoopheads** (10): when Lanky Kong farted himself into the stratosphere I ascended with him

**steelstepladder** (10): Throwback to when I submitted this for charity and it went out day one

**waluigiest** (10): omg when I heard this in Melee as a child I lost my whole mind!!! DK. DONKEY KONG.

**welcome2thejam** (10): "Inflate himself, just like a balloon" E X P A N D K O N G

**2dina3dworld** (9): It’s such a shame these promising young kongs went down the wrong path, rest in peace Chunky.

**Chevsapher** (9): Classic. It's absolutely... bananas.

**kirby31200** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4htVcaTo1z4

**Qwilphish** (9): TAKE IT TO THE FRIDGE

**runaway3212** (9): IM ALLERGIC TO WALNUTS BUT ID SWALLOW DADDY KONG'S NUT

**skargardin** (9): it's the smash

**slimboyfriend** (9): The smash bros melee remix goes harder, but this is still great even thought they didn't have to come for Lanky like that

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): it's camp

**celladonn** (8.5): I know the words and am joining in too

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (8.5): bars so strong it isn't funny (it's totally funny)

**shhhneak** (8.4): Cranky Kong for Fighter’s Pass 3!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Unironically I kinda miss this era of “educational rap,” where everyone thought that doing slow, crunchy raps over these canned beats was the way to connect with the youngsters.

**stryxen** (7.5): this crazy kong just digs this tune

**astrologicalangel** (7): this is fine, but I prefer the HBomberguy DK stream version about trans rights

**cheatviathan** (7): I too enjoy listening to five apes exercise their Second Amendment rights. How about you?

**Parkouricus** (7): it took me ten years to realize "take it to the fridge" is a pun

**seanderlust** (7): walnuts, peanuts, pineapple smells, grapes, melons, oranges and coconut shells AH YEAH

**UltimateDomon** (7): I like the Melee version more as an actual song but the original is too iconic

# Has no style, has no grace

**luckyphase** (6.9): ?

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): why does this song feel like 5 minutes song when it’s only 3

**Alumineous** (5): Eh, it's iconic, but it's not good.

**teenwitches** (5): i waited the whole time for the chunky's dead part before i found out that's not from the actual song

**wavingwolves** (5): [thinking of this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/823334183053033494/855930206400282664/92hkerehs4151.png?width=799&height=609)

**pig-serpent** (4): It has no style. It has no grace. This song is a Fucking Disgrace (but I love it anyway tbh)

**hikkaru** (3): I've never played DK64 so this is just more annoying than anything fdlkgjfd

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I’m so sorry… this song is god-awful… you can ban me now…

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): dakotaz >>>

**N454545** (2): Cringe

**NFLfreak98** (2): ‘He can do a handstand when he needs to’ and ‘He can throw a boulder with relative ease’ are such minor boasts that I’m really not sure if they want me to be scared of them or not

**PhloxInvar** (2): Funny, but I’m rating it low because I do not desire for this to get anywhere near a top spot.

**cyborglilith** (1): he can't rap

**fadedblue09** (1): I don't get this sorry

**TragicKingdom1** (1): FUCK DIDDY KONG!!!

**nooodisaster** (0): I was going to give this a 10 ironically, but then I realized: no. It's actually just very very bad. Like all things involving DK64, let's leave this in the 90s.

**Raxxin** (0): yeah no giving this a zero to balance out the people that think they're funny by giving this an eleven. also its just terrible

And there goes the oldest track in the rate! This was a weird one, first it was day 3 for a bit, then dropped to day 1, then averaged back out into day 2. This is a really cute and fun track but I think this is an alright spot for it. Still, I have no idea how it picked up 2 0's!

---

# I believe in you!

**ReallyCreative** (11): How do I explain how much this song and this series means to me? MOTHER, for all its quirky aesthetics and humor, is a dark series, with plots rooted in apocalypse and characters molded by intense trauma and tragedy. Yet, even when these games are at their bleakest, there is always a sliver of hope, and Pollyanna embodies that hope. I'm not expecting this song to do well, but I'm giving this my 11 because of what this series represents.

**agentofscranton** (10): now why did this make me cry?

**akanewasright** (10): This is actually really rad. Can’t believe this was in a game in the 80’s.

**Awkward\_King** (10): bestie i dont believe in me at this point but thank u

**BebeLuigi** (10): Another song that makes me very emotional... It was the other contender for my eleven with another song I'm crushed I can't give it to her really

**bigbigbee** (10): This reminds me of a Ghibli movie - not a particular one, but just the vibe.

**celladonn** (10): My favourite new discovery of the rate, what a lovely song!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I can't not give a disco song a 10 tbh.

**ManofOranges** (10): SING IT!!!!

**Parkouricus** (10): fun fact: this song is older than Taylor Swift!

**Qwilphish** (10): this song gives me an obscene amount of hope and love. it really makes me feel so good inside

**Raxxin** (10): REALLY pleasantly surprised that this song got in because i absolutely adore it

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is kinda corny but it also is very wholesome in a way that i cant hate it

**rslashpoopheads** (10): okay but the Mother and Mother 2 medleys for the Onett stage in SSB Melee are some of the most iconic songs of all time

**UltimateDomon** (10): Listening to this song always makes me feel so happy and hopeful, I love it a lot

**wavingwolves** (10): POLLYANNA I BELIEVE IN YOU TOO!!!!!!! YOU GOT THIS BITCH!!!

**LesApfels** (9.5): Her earnestness is infectious

**nooodisaster** (9.5): We need this level of optimism in this world.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.1): why is this so cheesy yet comforting?!

**AHSWeeknd** (9): This sounds like it’s from the 80s ngl

**CrimsonROSET** (9): that makes one of us, polly!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Earthbound? My wig isn’t

**steelstepladder** (9): This is so cute omg

**welcome2thejam** (9): Really grew on me! Lots of interesting & fun flourishes

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is nice

**Brendon-Urine** (8): why is this just the warmest hug I've ever gotten?

**Chevsapher** (8): TIL this song has lyrics. Bonus points for honky-tonk piano.

**nt96** (8): This is so cute!

**RetrohTanner** (8): Such positive vibes

**skargardin** (8): Mother is a series I've always been interested in but have never gotten around to playing.. I really should change that

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I’ve heard this song before but not this version… I think it’s really sweet and makes me feel all warm inside!

**luckyphase** (7.5): awww 🥰

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): if you want to be called Pollyanna i'll call you that, you just had to say so, i'm not gonna call you crazy

**bbfan132** (7): fun but not remarkable to me

**ignitethephoenix** (7): not bad but corny

# Unbelievers

**2dina3dworld** (6): kinda cute

**cheatviathan** (6): I remember enjoying it while it’s on, but cannot recall a single detail after it ends.

**fadedblue09** (6): This felt so bland to me but I can imagine people finding this nostalgic

**ImADudeDuh** (6): ok

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (6): i disliked pollyanna intensely when i read it as an abridged edition back in grade school or whatever and maybe it was internalized misogyny but maybe it is because boundless optimism is just really friggin obnoxious. i will NEVER see your point of view not-pollyanna. you are a crazy loon-fool. go snort a silver lining score bumped up because i caught myself humming it gdi

**pig-serpent** (6): I think the vocals clash with the instrumental and that an instrumental version of this would shred.

**stryxen** (6): i love about half of this and kinda dislike the other half

**runaway3212** (5): the good thing about this song is that we'll hear Cher after this

**PhloxInvar** (1): Reminds of the Twinkle Nora Rock Me OST. That anime has an amazing OST despite its sounds, Pollyanna is less fun and interesting.

**cyborglilith** (0): This is just trash.

**jayjaysortagay** (0): very annoying

Well this track lives up to its name for sure! It's so much fun to bop along to! This spent some time in day 3 (pretty much all the next eliminated songs did too). In other JSRF notes: Concept of Love was very nearly included in the rate, but was the final cut.


---

# Aces

**bigbigbee** (11): Amazing surprise. I LOVE how cool and sleek this feels. The lyrics' theme is unique and the music is immediately ear-catching. Listening to this makes me feel like I'm a video game final boss with my own boss music, like the start of a pokemon battle or something. I look a right fool strutting down the street to this.

**akanewasright** (10): This fucks

**BebeLuigi** (10): SO happy Jet Set Radio is on here! One of the most impecable ost out here

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i wish poker was this funky when I played

**ReallyCreative** (10): can we please be Gamers™ for once and commit enough misogyny to get this into the top 10?

**seanderlust** (10): if the avalanches made a heavy funk banger

**steelstepladder** (10): HIGH AND A WINNER, GOT A HOT HAND

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): this getting past day 1 would be a real funky deal.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Sounds kinda wack but it works! Love the funkiness

**Chevsapher** (9.4): This is art.

**Awkward\_King** (9): someone help me explain how this feels like an alternate univers bmbmbm

**ImADudeDuh** (9): the transition from Good Riddance, a calm folk duet into this with no warning whatsoever fucking sent me

**luckyphase** (9): i think i like this

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (9): this is the spiritual ancestor of the TWEWY soundtrack. love the craps dealer/commentator theme

**Parkouricus** (9): as much as i wish we rated right there, ride on, this is FIERY and i never realized how much the bassline is doing

**pig-serpent** (9): It's a little too chaotic on first listen but once you get acoustomed to it it's hard to deny the raw slappage of this tune.

**Qwilphish** (9): high energy, high fun, high as hell a great great track to a great game

**Raxxin** (9): the hold this song has youtube montage monsters

**runaway3212** (9): I love playing poker

**skargardin** (9): Now I'm kicking myself for not playing Jet Set Radio bc this absolutely SLAPS

**slimboyfriend** (9): This is everything video game music should be

**plastichaxan** (8.8): yass hyperpop

**anothertown** (8.5): now what do the kids know about this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is a game so ahead of its time, I feel like everybody today wants what this game had and you can still see echoes of it in the indie scene. The hip-hop/Jpop fusion soundtrack perfectly matched the futuristic streetwear aesthetic of the game and it makes you feel like such a badass

**1998tweety** (8): bop, this is ahead of its time

**bbfan132** (8): a bit too repetitive but still fun

**Brendon-Urine** (8): would probably like this more as just an instrumental but GOD that bass is doing things to me

**cheatviathan** (8): I probably would’ve picked either “Shape da Future” or “Fly Like a Butterfly”, but this is still a killer in its own right. The bassline and vocal samples do a lot to keep me invested.

**RetrohTanner** (8): Really great sample work

**Roxieloxie** (8): idk whats going on here but sure!

**wavingwolves** (7.9): bop

**EnCaine** (7.7): i've been dealt funk

**LesApfels** (7.5): The sheer power needed to conceptualize a song this bizarre-

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): reminds me of an Avalanches song

# Twos

**CrimsonROSET** (7): grammys listening to after hours

**N454545** (7): I kind of like but I also think it's annoying.

**nooodisaster** (7): "I ain't a winner." True.

**UltimateDomon** (7): I like the JSR soundtracks a lot, not one of my favorites from it though

**ignitethephoenix** (6): reminds me of those remixes people made in 2010 on YouTube

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): This is like I’ve Seen Footage by Death Grips over Mario Kart music

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): It the voice saying “I ain’t a winner” or “place your bets” repeated less or they did something else as well, I would have liked this song a lot more.

**PhloxInvar** (5): I think I appreciate the instrumental more than I like it, it’s not their best song in my opinion.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): who wants to come?

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I was waiting so intently for actual singing to start… and it never did

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Video Games!!

**celladonn** (4): four four the point's marked four

**stryxen** (4): ?? !! do i like this??

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): from the makers of the light is coming

**shhhneak** (1): This sounds like a Number Station and it triggered my fight or flight.

A classic smash!! This fit so well with the wasteland aesthetic in Fallout that it would've been impossible not to have it in the rate. There are a few songs on the radio in game that get on my nerves after too many listens but this is not one of them!

---

# Firefighters

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Fallout is fun, and we stan vintage excellence.

**endcreditouilles** (10): Another perfect song to set the scene for another incredible game. Sync placements like this are just *chefs kiss

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ICONIC AS FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**ManofOranges** (10): Hate or love Bethesda for what they did to Fallout, the one thing I will always give them credit for is the ungodly ability to make the experience of walking through a nuclear wasteland while listening to 50s music feel so special and unforgettable. I would love to see Bethesda get their groove back because memories associated with this song and this game are unparalleled for some.

**BoneStreetSand** (9.5): Gave me chills.

**shhhneak** (9.5): no phones just BioShock vibes.

**nt96** (9): Classic

**rslashpoopheads** (9): this makes me feel good

**UltimateDomon** (9): We need to bring this sound back

**Chevsapher** (8.8): Of course this is from Fallout. Those games are the sole reason my boyfriend knows any non-holiday songs from before the rise of rock music.

**Parkouricus** (8.5): alright yeah this would be really cute 80 years ago i respect it

**cremeebrulee** (8): well i do i love arson

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): old music is good sometimes

**nooodisaster** (8): Sleepy but in a good way

**seanderlust** (8): didn't realize this got popular because of anti-war sentiments! I live.

**steelstepladder** (8): Fucks

**bbfan132** (7.5): cute!

# Arson

**stryxen** (6): overrated

**EnCaine** (5): i'm too modern and gay and tasteless for this

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (4): one simp two simp three simp...four simp.

I'm so bummed this ended up going today instead of day 3. It was actually 2nd for most of May (well for 2 ballots, but the time between those 2 ballots was like 2 weeks). ANYWAYS, this song is the most sickeningly sweet thing I've ever heard and y'all did it a disservice

---

# Rolling Stars

**cheatviathan** (11): This was my 11 going into the rate, and while a few songs came close, nothing unseated it. This track is the perfect blend of catchy, hopeful, zany, and melancholic, and in its intended setting of rolling shit up into a ball, it slays. That chorus will live rent free in my head until the end of time.

**UltimateDomon** (11): This is my favorite video game song of all time

**2dina3dworld** (10): I’m a sucker for music that sounds like idol music, and this ticked that box

**cremeebrulee** (10): twitch starting soon screen type beat

**Qwilphish** (10): that chorus is so amazing and the whole song is such a vibe

**ReallyCreative** (10): ICONIC

**steelstepladder** (10): There's like 10 Katamari Damacy songs that could be in this rate and they are all 10s

**stryxen** (10): wait this is adorable oh my GOD it’s me phobic that this isn’t on spotify (second favourite discovery)

**Parkouricus** (9.5): i feel like if i understood the lyrics i'd cry but this song is just. :)

**wavingwolves** (9.5): if my life was a game i would love for this to be the soundtrack of it

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I like how the lyrics of this one cheekily relate to the actual gameplay, like they sound so inspirational out of context but they’re actually about something rather silly!

**waluigiest** (9): it makes me so so happy

**1998tweety** (8.5): now THIS is a smash

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Keep rolling back to me ;___;

**PhloxInvar** (8.5): Honestly, iconic. Though I prefer Katamari on the Rocks, this is such a brilliant song for such a brilliant game.

**Chevsapher** (8.2): Cute. I thought the chiptune sounds would get annoying, but the variety in the production kept it interesting.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): a fun bop

**bbfan132** (8): still dancing to this

**ImADudeDuh** (8): relatable title

**LesApfels** (8): That chorus is heavenly

**runaway3212** (8): This is really cute

**skargardin** (8): This makes me happy. Instant serotonin I think

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): album: we love katamari SO TRUE!

# Stationary

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): The chorus here eats, but the verse is fasting

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7): don't talk to me i'm in my feelings over these lyrics JUST COME BACK DUDE SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU DAMN

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I keep hearing the singer say doggy style even though I know that’s not what she’s saying help

**BebeLuigi** (5): A bit whatever to me and kinda dragging but still cute!

**fadedblue09** (5): Really dislike the dubstep

**pig-serpent** (5): The instrumental parts of this song are nice and relaxing, but the energy tapers off in the vocal sections and they just aren't as good.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Gotta be honest and say I didn’t like this one… at least it’s a fitting song for Katamari

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (4): I don’t really like the 8 bit sounds?

**seanderlust** (3): this is nitpicky, but there's a little chirpy noise in the background of the chorus that i don't like and overall the production of this I don't like

**rslashpoopheads** (2): im dizzy

**cyborglilith** (1): i sleep

WTF POPHEADS. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TASTELESS DECISIONS THIS RATE, BUT NOT HAVING SONIC MAKE DAY 3???? WITH THIS JAM??? I CAN'T ANYMORE

anyways this is the best rock song of the 2000's and it's placing 24th

---

# Happy Pride!

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): “Got places to go, gotta follow my rainbow!” happy fucking pride

**waluigiest** (11): an iconic first level with an even more iconic soundtrack. I can’t rate this fairly because I loved this game so much and was so obsessed with all of the different vocal music the different characters had. It’s a fun, funky track and it holds up really well.

**1998tweety** (10): one of the greatest songs to ever exist

**agentofscranton** (10): buttrock has never sounded as good as when it soundtracked the world's fastest hedgehog

**akanewasright** (10): Literally I don’t know how you can make a more bright, infectious song to accompany a first level

**anothertown** (10): me when im flying down lombard street and sending a truck flying into some 100 year old victorian houses

**Awkward\_King** (10): i will not be mad if this wins :waiting:

**Brendon-Urine** (10): PEAK 2000s video game nostalgia.

**EnCaine** (10): this is unironically better than almost every pop-crossover rock song in the last 15 years

**fadedblue09** (10): Never played this Sonic title before, but damn this makes me feel I've played it a thousand times.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Iconic, this feels so fun and wholesome! It captures that late ‘90s sweet spot of garage band earnestness that makes me melt when done properly. I can see this being a win contender, Top 10 at least.

**hikkaru** (10): that was a classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is just the plot of Tracy Chapman - Fast Car

**ManofOranges** (10): GOTTA FOLLOW MY RAINBOW YASSS SAY IT AGAIN

**nt96** (10): Makes me want to become a wanted criminal and escape the police.

**Qwilphish** (10): Twitch chat is popping off right now.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I could never get into sonic, i tried to play mania and i gave up on the airship level but my brother had a bit of a phase, i think there is this sort of corny charm to sonic that even if youve never played its easy to see the nostalgia and charm people have for it. thats basically how this makes me feel

**steelstepladder** (10): FOLLOW MEEEEEEEEEEEEE SET ME FREEEEEEEE TRUST ME AND WE WILL ESCAPE FROM THE CITY

**endcreditouilles** (9.7): Me living in LA when the pandemic hit

**bigbigbee** (9.5): This is a nostalgia score. I played this level SO FUCKING MUCH as a kid. Confession: I also wrote f*n f*ction about this game with my friend, over EMAIL, in lime green font.

**astrologicalangel** (9): Sonic as a franchise is worth it for this song alone

**celladonn** (9): I am so easily won over by this kind of music

**cheatviathan** (9): Quite possibly the best bop this franchise has given us. It’s just a fun song with a killer bassline that makes me want to attempt to do an ollie on a skateboard. I especially like how at the beginning of the city escape level, Sonic landing on the ground is perfectly synched up to when the drums and guitars come crashing in during the intro.

**cremeebrulee** (9): this is like . one of three games i’ve played in this rate lmao so i’m obligated to score this well

**Parkouricus** (9): prefer the cash cash remix (classic stage in sonic generations) a little bit!! this is so incredibly 2001 though i love it

**pig-serpent** (9): Darn solid pop punk track with a killer bassline.

**Raxxin** (9): bop

**slimboyfriend** (9): "Gotta follow my rainbow... that's gay rights"

**UltimateDomon** (9): I miss my childhood

**wavingwolves** (8.9): fun and memorable

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND

**bbfan132** (8): this makes me nostalgic in a way that i don’t totally understand

**CrimsonROSET** (8): honestly in some reality there’s a sick anime with this as an op

**sarcasticsobs** (7.8): i will not meme i will not meme i will not meme

**Chevsapher** (7.5): I like the song itself, but the unrelentingly aggressive production is fatiguing.

**LesApfels** (7.5): ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND

**stryxen** (7.5): perfect for the soundtrack but i’m a bit sick of it now

**BoneStreetSand** (7.2): I only stan Sonic Heroes.

**nooodisaster** (7): Mid tier bop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): gotta go fast

# Gotta go slow

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): Escape from the City... for City Escape... for Escaping City... City Escaping For... Escape City Music... City for Escaping from... Escape

**skargardin** (6): i mean..

**2dina3dworld** (5): Foo Fighters but make it Sonic

**PhloxInvar** (5): ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND. What is vocal mixing though?

**runaway3212** (5): iconic but bad

**BebeLuigi** (4): Not of fan of this kind of rock in Sonic

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (4): set me free from this song, i wish to Escape from the Shitty

**alexpiercey** (3.8): Sorry but sonic blows

**AHSWeeknd** (3): it really seems like the vocals were recorded for another beat but this beat was made last minute to add excitement or something.

**ReallyCreative** (3): Sonic music is plagued by trying to sound way cooler and way more interesting than it actually is, and Escape from the City is an excellent example

**rslashpoopheads** (3): this weirdly reminds me of NKotB

I know very little about this game tbh other than the soundtrack is a BOP! This song especially stands out as an amazing 80's throwback and a fantastic track to bop along to

---

# Peggle 2!

**Alumineous** (10): This is very close to synthwave, sort of, and that's why I love it. Love the 80s vibes.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this bops

**cyborglilith** (10): bop

**jayjaysortagay** (10): she's got it, yeah baby she's got it, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire...

**PhloxInvar** (10): WOAAAHHHHH. Pure 80s. Amazing lyrics, amazing production, amazing melodies, amazing hooks and amazing vocals. If you told me this was a hit in the old times, I’d believe you. CALLING ME!

**Qwilphish** (10): surprise hit i didnt know before this rate. synth pop perfection

**seanderlust** (10): @ pop girls THIS is how you do 80s

**anothertown** (9.5): this is what we call pastiche and it's working !

**Chevsapher** (9.5): HOLY SHIT. This is like “Shattered Dreams” meets synthwave. It's crack for my ears, and I'm delighted that this fabulous song is now in my life.

**nt96** (9.5): Holy crap this was a surprising one! Love it!!!

**BebeLuigi** (9): A really good surprise! Love it

**skargardin** (9): Future Nostalgia could never

**waluigiest** (9): they should play this at the gym

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): This is just pure 80's synthpop and i love it

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): Funkytown but make it city pop-lite

**akanewasright** (8.5): This actually slaps

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): I can imagine this playing in a movie scene with neon while a guy shoots a bunch of people in a gunfight and movie nerds cum in their pants

**LesApfels** (8.5): This is leagues better than a lot of the 80s inspired songs we're getting nowadays

**Parkouricus** (8.5): holy shit this was like six years ahead of the synthwave ... wave, and it's comparably awesome

**bbfan132** (8): i like the synths!

**cheatviathan** (8): This is exactly the sort of ‘80s throwback that short circuits my critical faculties, and compels me to just vibe. It’s certainly on par with what I’d expect from my favorite beat ‘em up soundtracks.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): love an 80’s bop but why does it end when the song so still going on

**runaway3212** (8): bop!

**steelstepladder** (8): Delightful 80's synth!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): What a bop!

**shhhneak** (7.7): This is so fun. If she didn’t say laser beams you could’ve told me this was an 80s radio hit.

**kirby31200** (7.5): The 80s amirite

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): 80s bop

**AHSWeeknd** (7): a bop

**CrimsonROSET** (7): audio jungle

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Really feels like something from the soundtrack of an ‘80s film… an overrated genre.

**nooodisaster** (7): Decent 80s pop

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7): honestly kinda reminds me of funkytown (that's a good thing)

**pig-serpent** (7): I can groove to the cheesy 80s vibes.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): It's fun, generic 80s pop!

# Hates sequels

**UltimateDomon** (6): The chorus is great, the rest is ok

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): great except for the vocals, and seeing how this is the video game vocal rate... well

**N454545** (5): It's nice but the lyrics are kind of awkward

**RetrohTanner** (5): This is a perfectly fine song, but there's something about it that feels so... derivative? souless? idk

**fadedblue09** (4.5): I like the new wave sound but the vocals sounds so bland and dead inside. But of course popheads will overrate this.

**ManofOranges** (4): I do have to give props that this sounds EXACTLY like a song from the 80s but like not a good one

**rslashpoopheads** (4): hmm

**wavingwolves** (4): just like doctor who's the silence, once i'm not listening to this song i forget what it sounds like

REALLY surprised this is going out before day 3, I honestly thought it was a lock for top 10, let alone day 3. Anyways this song's a ton of fun (as is most of the Persona soundtrack really). 

---

# Cat people

**Qwilphish** (11): words cant describe how perfect this song is. the game's sound motif as the basis of the game.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I know liking this soundtrack is a meme at this point but I really do like it that much...

**CrimsonROSET** (10): not my favorite (daredevil) but it’s still so fucking good

**Marshynarsh** (10): This song is great but I cannot believe the audacity of people to not vote for Rivers in the Desert in the thread. But yeah this song is very good at hyping up for the bosses!

**ReallyCreative** (10): how can Persona be good if they need 5 of them, how are you supposed to keep track of 5 different personas? I can barely remember what happened to me last week

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this song is so good I love it so much

**skargardin** (10): Dittoing my persona 4 comment

**welcome2thejam** (10): Woah, looking cool, Popheads! Just the perfect track to build and hype you up for the upcoming boss fights. Sure, the stakes are high and the pressure's on, but blasting this track makes you feel unstoppable. My second favorite video game song of all time, if only it wasn't in a rate with my no. 1...

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): pog

**Parkouricus** (9.5): THIS ISN'T IN SMASH ULTIMATE?

**UltimateDomon** (9.5): The bass breakdown before the chorus rocks my socks off

**1998tweety** (9): now HERE is the smasha!

**bigbigbee** (9): Reminds me of Narcissus by Roisin Murphy but slightly less good. But since Narcissus is an 11 (literally, in my case), a slightly worse version is still pretty great.

**nooodisaster** (9): POV: You took your mask off

**Raxxin** (9): problematic fave

**seanderlust** (9): I actually played this game! this song was always a great pump-up song

**PhloxInvar** (8.7): It’s not my favorite Persona 5 song. That goes to Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There and Whims of Fate. That said, it’s incredible how catchy all the Persona 5 songs are. They’ve perfected the style by the fifth game and it shows.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): one of the funkiest bass lines in gaming tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The best one out of the persona’s

**anothertown** (8): i played like 10-15 hours of this last year and i feel like i will never finish it because i forgot everything.

**bbfan132** (8): banger

**cheatviathan** (8): This is my first time sitting down and listening to the original version of this in a non-mashup capacity. The prechorus, with the descending bassline and organ chords, is the highlight of this track. Hell, the bass across the whole track is one of the smoothest things I’ve ever heard.

**Chevsapher** (8): Those disco-esque strings are addictive.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): That riff in the intro was SOOOO GOOD, but the song kinda plateaued afterwards, except for the cute string parts from time to time.

**pig-serpent** (8): The best of the Persona songs, easy.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): at least this franchise’s music improves over time

# Not cat people

**kirby31200** (7.5): I don't know why but Last Surprise is the only Persona song that really hits for me, everything else I'm just kind of eh on

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7.5): oh i like this, kind of reminds me of that cowboy bebop/baccano! chase jazz aesthetic. vocals don't really do it for me though

**BebeLuigi** (7): The hype it creates in finishing a chapter... love it, but I'd rather not listen to it in full it gets a bit boring at some points sdfsdsdq

**Roxieloxie** (7): why are there so many persons!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s fine but I think there are better P5 songs

**wavingwolves** (6.2): a liiiiiitle tiring but it's not bad

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): What, uh, what is up with the vocals on this one? They’re so flaccid, they really drag the song down. I think I like the idea of this more than the song itself, the teeth are blunt.

**runaway3212** (6): more annoying than good but still good

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is boring lowkey

**plastichaxan** (5): not bad but yeah this isn't my type of music

**fadedblue09** (4): Would've been decent if the vocalist wasn't shouting all the time

**stryxen** (2.5): this dragged im sorry it wasn’t terrible but i didn’t like it

**cyborglilith** (2): I simp for Ryuji

**jayjaysortagay** (2): another very annoying one

And with the last of the songs going today, we say goodbye to our first Bayo track. Honestly, even though this was on the curated side I don't really love this track. Especially compared to the other two. That said it's still pretty good and managed to score a couple of 11's too!

---

# Trying for tomorrow

**endcreditouilles** (11): The Bayonetta games are partially responsible for my bisexual awakening. I based my entire high school personality off of Bayonetta and the Umbra Witches (sorry mom)

**LesApfels** (11): If you get it you get it, if you don't you don't, if you know you know and if you don't know then I honestly feel bad for you

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Damn maybe I should play this game.

**cyborglilith** (10): wig evaporated

**PhloxInvar** (10): BANG BANG DOWN DOWN. Haha! Each section of this song is just really well made and the transitions are great too. The verses, the pre-chorus and the actual chorus are all memorable and so catchy in their own ways with great hooks.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): yet another absolutely flawless Bayonetta song, and it's even more impressive that this isn't a cover and it STILL bops, and has AMAZING lyrics

**ReallyCreative** (10): Bayonetta music single handedly saved the piano industry

**runaway3212** (10): okay I surrender if you'll give us more bops like this

**steelstepladder** (10): God I need to replay Bayonetta 2

**waluigiest** (10): the syncopated parts are such a serve

**1998tweety** (9): this is another bop, but, like with the other 2 songs, I feel like they would work better with a bit more mature of a voice

**Awkward\_King** (9): all the bayonetta tracks sound like mario galaxy went through the bimbofication process

**cheatviathan** (9): Same banging piano-based instrumentation of the other tracks in this rate, now with a vocal performance with more personality, and a unique vocal melody. The way she sings “You won't know what hit you/When I spin around/Leave you in my dust” is catchy and entertaining as all hell.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The top comment on this YouTube video is a six year old comment saying Bayonetta should be in Smash and it has 500 replies… this is a cultural artifact.

**Parkouricus** (9): "don't miss me too much ;)" bINCH IT'S BEEN 3 YEARS

**Qwilphish** (9): The beat is crazy but the vocals are getting lost which is a shame bc theyre really nice

**skargardin** (9): A banger for sure

**UltimateDomon** (9): This shit is so iconic

**shhhneak** (8.9): I hope the woman they had sing all this songs got paid extravagantly.

**Chevsapher** (8.6): Fun melodies, and I'm always a sucker for a 90s house piano. I only the wish the vocals were more forward in the mix.

**anothertown** (8.5): Lenscrafter face ass

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why are the bayonetta songs serves

**nooodisaster** (7.5): You can have it.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7.5): i like the little intermittent asides, overall very upbeat and playful and reminds me of like a persona dancing track

**bigbigbee** (7): Not as good as the two covers were, but still pretty fun, and really energetic, which I assume you want for a Bayonetta game

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this song when we reach day 1

**Raxxin** (7): a bit better

**Roxieloxie** (7): I think this is my least favorite one of the bayonetta songs its not bad but compared to the other ones its no question

**rslashpoopheads** (7): https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8f/11/ab/8f11abf378c0f10621f32c9703cbda70.gif

# Going today

**stryxen** (6.5): this makes me anxious but it’s a bop i guess

**2dina3dworld** (6): Who put aespa’s next comeback in Bayonetta?

**bbfan132** (6): short, repetitive, and i had the same issues with the production

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6): I feel like with all the Bayonetta songs the instruments are all louder and clearer then her voice and it’s an odd choice that I don’t like.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Okay, the Bayonetta songs kinda blend together.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is like if Fight Song was made in the Bayonetta universe

**pig-serpent** (6): If the Moon River rip didn't have an awkward ending I probably wouldn't have noticed that this is a different song. I think this one is slightly worse.

**Alumineous** (5): Apparently, this plays in the battles? Well, this is a example of liking something only because you're heard it a million times. It's nothing special.

**BebeLuigi** (5): idk if it's because Moon River was just before but this one bores me sadly

**ManofOranges** (5): You know, I kinda feel diminishing returns on the musical stylings of Bayonetta. One song, and it's novel, two songs and it gets a little old but still nice, but three kinda makes me feel like it's a bit repetitive and boring.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Very bubbly and boppy. But I can’t say I like it...

**wavingwolves** (5): is it bitch

**fadedblue09** (3): Wow that was a highkey mess. Now I get why they resort to using covers LOL.

**N454545** (3): It sounds like two songs are playing at once.

Chevsapher: It's sad that “Vagrant Song” is out, but at least it reached day 2! I'm currently rooting for “Baba Yetu,” “Still Alive,” and “Snake Eater,” and I'm delighted that “Ashley's Song” is still in.

TiltControls: It was doing so well for most of the rate too! But the last bunch of ballots brought and kept it to day 2 unfortunately
