##June Update:

**REMINDER THAT SCORES ARE DUE ON ~~JUNE 13th (SUNDAY) AT MIDNIGHT EST!!!~~ BEFORE I WAKE UP MONDAY MORNING**

(Honestly, if you get it in before the last of the extensions come in (Tuesday night EST) I'll happily take your scores. Just give me a heads up if they're going to be late so I know how many ballots I'm waiting on)

___

I can give a couple days for extensions (up to Tuesday night), but please let me if you need one!

~~Also if you still need to listen to the songs there'll be doing two final half-listening parties at **3PM EST** on **Saturday the 12th** and **Sunday the 13th**! [Join the Beatsense here!](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj#/)~~

And don't forgot the reveal which will be on Friday the 18th!

[Here are the current participants! Let me know if you're name isn't here but you've submitted!](https://pastebin.com/ThLyaG6Q)

Welcome to the Video Game Vocal Rate Final Mix 2.8 Alpha Version Deluxe Game of the Year Edition! [After a long wait](https://i.imgur.com/iUWreiz.png) it's finally time to get the rate started! I'm your host [TiltControls](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/503/370/dc4.gif) and I'm so excited to finally be hosting this battle royale spectacle!

I got a lot of great submissions and you all did a fantastic job with the voting! There were a ton of hard cuts and songs that missed the cutoff that would've done fantastic if there was space! Maybe if VGV2 ever happens then [they'll get their chance then](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/793/595/4c2.gif). The 16 tracks have been added to the list below along with the 48 other songs coming from the curated side.

If my talking has already started to bore you and you're mashing B to skip my post like the past 100 unskippable "How to catch a Pokemon" tutorials over the years then here's the **[message link for the ballot](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=TiltControls&subject=Video%20Game%20Vocal%20Ballot&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAnimal%20Crossing%20-%20Forest%20Life%3A%20%0A%0AApe%20Escape%203%20-%20Banana%20Heartbreak%3A%0A%0ABastion%20-%20Setting%20Sail%2C%20Coming%20Home%3A%0A%0ABayonetta%20-%20Fly%20Me%20to%20the%20Moon%3A%0A%0ABayonetta%202%20-%20Moon%20River%3A%0A%0ABayonetta%202%20-%20Tomorrow%20Is%20Mine%3A%0A%0ABugsnax%20-%20It's%20Bugsnax!%3A%0A%0ACivilization%20IV%20-%20Baba%20Yetu%3A%0A%0ACyberpunk%202077%20-%20Circus%20Minimus%3A%0A%0ADeath%20Stranding%20-%20Death%20Stranding%3A%0A%0ADevil%20May%20Cry%20V%20-%20Devil%20Trigger%3A%0A%0ADonkey%20Kong%2064%20-%20DK%20Rap%3A%0A%0ADouble%20Dragon%20Neon%20-%20City%20Streets%202%3A%0A%0AFinal%20Fantasy%20VIII%20-%20Eyes%20on%20Me%3A%0A%0AFinal%20Fantasy%20X%20-%20Suteki%20Da%20Ne%3A%0A%0AFinal%20Fantasy%20X-2%20-%20Real%20Emotion%3A%0A%0AFinal%20Fantasy%20XV%20-%20Stand%20By%20Me%3A%0A%0AFire%20Emblem%20Three%20Houses%20-%20The%20Edge%20of%20Dawn%3A%0A%0AGravity%20Rush%20-%20Douse%20Shinundakara%3A%0A%0AHades%20-%20Good%20Riddance%3A%0A%0AJet%20Set%20Radio%20Future%20-%20Funky%20Dealer%3A%0A%0AKatamari%20Damacy%20-%20Katamari%20on%20the%20Rocks%3A%0A%0AKatamari%20Damacy%20-%20Lonely%20Rolling%20Star%3A%0A%0AKingdom%20Hearts%20-%20Simple%20and%20Clean%3A%0A%0AKingdom%20Hearts%20II%20-%20Sanctuary%3A%0A%0AKingdom%20Hearts%20III%20-%20Face%20My%20Fears%3A%0A%0ALeague%20of%20Legends%20-%20Get%20Jinxed%3A%0A%0ALeague%20of%20Legends%20-%20POP%2FSTARS%3A%0A%0AMetal%20Gear%20Solid%203%20Snake%20Eater%20-%20Snake%20Eater%3A%0A%0AMirror's%20Edge%20-%20Still%20Alive%3A%0A%0AMOTHER%20-%20Pollyanna%20%28I%20Believe%20In%20You%29%3A%0A%0ANier%20-%20Kaine%20%2F%20Salvation%3A%0A%0ANier%20Automata%20-%20The%20Weight%20of%20the%20World%3A%0A%0ANiGHTS%20Journey%20of%20Dreams%20-%20Cruising%20Together%3A%0A%0AParadise%20Killer%20-%20Paradise%20%28Stay%20Forever%29%3A%0A%0APaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20-%20Car%20Rap%3A%0A%0APersona%203%20-%20Mass%20Destruction%3A%0A%0APersona%204%20-%20Reach%20Out%20for%20the%20Truth%3A%0A%0APersona%204%20Dancing%20All%20Night%20-%20Dance!%3A%0A%0APersona%205%20-%20Life%20Will%20Change%3A%0A%0APlants%20vs.%20Zombies%20-%20Zombie%20On%20Your%20Lawn%3A%0A%0APortal%20-%20Still%20Alive%3A%0A%0APortal%202%20-%20Want%20You%20Gone%3A%0A%0APutt-Putt%20Travels%20Through%20Time%20-%20Time%20Continuum%3A%0A%0ARed%20Dead%20Redemption%20-%20Far%20Away%3A%0A%0ARed%20Dead%20Redemption%202%20-%20House%20Building%3A%0A%0ARed%20Dead%20Redemption%202%20-%20Unshaken%3A%0A%0ARhythm%20Heaven%20-%20I%20Love%20You%2C%20My%20One%20and%20Only%3A%0A%0ASonic%20R%20-%20Can%20You%20Feel%20the%20Sunshine%3F%3A%0A%0ASonic%20Adventure%202%20-%20Escape%20from%20the%20City%3A%0A%0ASonic%20Adventure%202%20-%20Live%20and%20Learn%3A%0A%0ASonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20-%20His%20World%3A%0A%0ASonic%20Colors%20-%20Reach%20for%20the%20Stars%3A%0A%0ASplatoon%202%20-%20Fly%20Octo%20Fly%20~%20Ebb%20%26%20Flow%3A%0A%0ASuper%20Mario%20Odyssey%20-%20Jump%20Up%2C%20Super%20Star!%3A%0A%0ASuper%20Smash%20Bros.%20Ultimate%20-%20Lifelight%3A%0A%0ATetris%20Effect%20-%20Always%20Been%20But%20Never%20Dreamed%3A%0A%0AThe%20Witcher%203%20Wild%20Hunt%20-%20The%20Wolven%20Storm%3A%0A%0AThe%20World%20Ends%20With%20You%20-%20Calling%3A%0A%0ATo%20The%20Moon%20-%20Everything's%20Alright%3A%0A%0ATransistor%20-%20Paper%20Boats%3A%0A%0ATransistor%20-%20We%20All%20Become%3A%0A%0AWarioware%20Touched!%20-%20Ashley's%20Song%3A%0A%0AWhere%20the%20Water%20Tastes%20Like%20Wine%20-%20Vagrant%20Song%20%28Deep%20South%29%3A%0A%0ABONUS%20TRACKS%0A%0ABorderlands%20-%20Ain't%20No%20Rest%20for%20the%20Wicked%3A%0A%0AFallout%203%20-%20I%20Don't%20Want%20to%20Set%20the%20World%20On%20Fire%3A%0A%0AGuitar%20Hero%20III%20-%20Through%20the%20Fire%20and%20Flames%3A%0A%0ALife%20Is%20Strange%20-%20Obstacles%3A%0A%0ARobot%20Unicorn%20Attack%20-%20Always%3A%0A%0ASSX%20Tricky%20-%20It's%20Tricky%3A%0A%0AStar%20Wars%20Kinect%20-%20I'm%20Han%20Solo%3A%0A%0AThe%20Sims%203%20-%20Last%20Friday%20Night%20%5BSimlish%5D%3A%0A%0ATony%20Hawk's%20Pro%20Skater%20-%20Superman%3A%0A%0AEND)**.

**Bonus Rate (9 songs, 35m)**

While the main rate focuses on the tracks shaped by the gaming industry, we shouldn't ignore the other important part of gaming music. Licensed soundtracks! We've got 9 fantastic and iconic songs that only scratch the surface of this category. Note that the bonus rate is **optional**. You don't have to do any of it, or you can do some songs and not others, or you can do all of them!

1. [Borderlands - Ain't No Rest for the Wicked (by Cage the Elephant)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKtsdZs9LJo)

2. [Fallout 3 - I Don't Want to Set the World On Fire (by The Ink Spots)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6vqPUM_FE)

3. [Guitar Hero III - Through the Fire and Flames (by Dragonforce)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5CthPJU2N0)

4. [Life Is Strange - Obstacles (by Syd Matters)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb1SkDjaXk8)

5. [Robot Unicorn Attack - Always (by Erasure)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWqJTKdznaM)

6. [SSX Tricky - It's Tricky (by Run DMC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-O5IHVhWj0)

7. [Star Wars Kinect - I'm Han Solo (by Jason Derulo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg_FoEy8T_A)

8. [The Sims 3 - Last Friday Night (Simlish) (by Katy Perry)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkdrJWE-rqI)

9. [Tony Hawk's Pro Skater - Superman (by Goldfinger)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvziPPpryv0)

##**Playlists**

As some of the songs are not on any streaming platforms (thanks Nintendo), you'll probably need to use the Youtube versions of a few of the songs (linked above and in the playlists below).

The first playlist link has some topic videos which are better quality, but lock certain regions out. The second playlist has no restrictions, but some of the videos are a bit lower quality. The songs that use topic videos are on streaming platforms though, if you want to listen in higher quality.

**[Youtube (All Songs - Better Quality)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6JSXWo7bfKEhguZd-bXRklodTkNKskEW)**


**[Youtube (All Songs - No Region Restrictions)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6JSXWo7bfKH8UAFev1h94n0kDKANovxy)**

**[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3bHouhjcnZq0wKMPJtjioK?si=dc2f904246f24a00)** (Missing 22/64 main rate songs and 2/9 from the bonus)

* [Playlist here with only the 22 main rate and 2 bonus songs not on streaming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6JSXWo7bfKEFBMokiUR2ZgUPc-hxYcbS)

##**Rules**

- **You must listen to every song in the main rate and assign it a score from 1 to 10.** You do not have to rate every song from the bonus rate, or even any song (but I would recommend doing it!).
 - Scores should only be to a max of one decimal place. So 9 or 9.4 are valid, but 9.45 is a no go.
 - **You are allowed to give one song an 11 and one song a 0**. These should be reserved for your favourite and least favourite tracks. **You cannot use the 11 or the 0 in the bonus rate**. You are not required to use these, but I would highly recommend at least using the 11. It is also highly recommended you leave comments for these scores.
- Speaking of comments, **comments are highly encouraged!** They aren't required but it adds flavour to the rate and helps give your thoughts on the track. Comments should be formatted by commenting after the song without adding anything else. For an example:
 - Kingdom Hearts - Simple and Clean: 10 Keep the formatting simple and clean like this!
- As long as you tell me before the due date, you are also free to change your comments or scores at any point! You can message me here on Reddit (u/TiltControls) or on discord at TiltControls#5066
- **Please do not sabotage!!!** We're not playing Call of Duty. Rate everything fairly. This is a grab bag so I'm expecting hot takes galore and I'll be very lenient with them, but if you send a ballot with only 10s and 1s I'll probably ask you to do it again.

##**Dates**

Right now the due date is set for **Sunday, June 13th at 11:59 PM EST** (or more likely whenever I wake up on the Monday) with the reveal scheduled to start **June 18th**. We're going all in with the gaming theme as this is the weekend after E3. So if it turns out It's Bugsnax Part 2 gets revealed y'all can blame me for not having the rate in July instead.

##**Other Events**

I realize that for some raters the tracklist may seem a little long or daunting, especially if you're unfamiliar with many of the tracks. So there are some plans for that! 

First, I'm hosting a listening party (or two!) at a to be determined date! Most likely will be times where no other major events are happening. The first is hopefully planned for this weekend (time and date to be determined, may be moved around), with another one happening much closer to the due date.

Also every day for the next month (starting tomorrow), I'll be posting to two songs to the DD to break up the songlist into more approachable numbers for those who need it. Luckily this is a grab-bag so it won't break up any flow. If you want to follow along daily I recommend copying the ballot to a text file or notes app and filing it in while you refresh the thread for new comments. And then at the end, do one final go through and send it in! Shouldn't take more than 10 minutes a day!
