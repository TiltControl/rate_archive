Video Game Vocal Reveal Day 1: Farewell to all the 0's I gave
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/o2xk9e/video_game_vocal_reveal_day_1_farewell_to_all_the/

Welcome to the Video Game Vocal Rate ~~Day~~ Level 1! 

Today we're cutting through the goombas of the rate before we can make it on to day 2. We will be revealing songs **#64 - #43** in the main rate and **#9 - #7** for the bonus!

The reveal will be starting at **4PM Eastern Time** (about 1 hour from now)! Come join the [Beatsense Room](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj) to watch the eliminations along with everyone else! Also featuring some beatsense-exclusive game related shitposts and interludes so don't miss out on those either (I'll post them here after day 1, but it's much more fun to experience in real-time)!

Also stay around the thread as this is where I'll be posting the full results for each elimination including scores, controversy, banners, and fancy rank graphs!

TiltControls: Now cause I love games, why don't we start another! 

Anyone who can get as close to guessing the final 5 will get a **special award** (hint: [it's just gold](https://i.imgur.com/NLDVaLD.png). mostly this is just cause I have accumulated enough coins to do something with them). you can also have bragging rights at least!

Getting the highest number correct of the top 5 is key, but order will matter for tiebreakers! You have until the start of day 2 to finalize lists (and yes that means you can change them if a guess goes out today). Just comment below to guess!

Is this something I'd ever listen to on my own time? Probably not. The voices don't really sound all that great and the only nice thing I can say about it musically is that its short. Still, it's at least interesting enough to score a few points. Now was that enough to save it from basically being on the bottom the entire rate? Nope! (technically it was not last for a single ballot as I had two songs tied for last at the start of the graph)

I would also like to take this time to point out that this is also the guy who did the Skyrim theme.

# Homework Lovers

**PhloxInvar** (10): BEST SONG OF THE RATE NO QUESTION. (DON‚ÄôT QUESTION WHY IT‚ÄôS ONLY A TEN.) Extend this shit into 3 minutes people!

**Roxieloxie** (10): leapfrog is SHAKING

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i submitted it as a meme but it has a genuinely good melody sdfgdfsda

**Chevsapher** (9): I was shocked at how good this is, considering how old and obscure the game is. I only realized after I went to Wikipedia that Jeremy Soule is the guy who scored the Elder Scrolls games.

**BoneStreetSand** (8.9): I mean, it's not the Zoo song but it's alright...

**steelstepladder** (8.3): The nostalgia this brought back...

**Awkward\_King** (8): this was a 10 but then i heard tk really loved this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Glad this one got voted in for the meme of it all and because I adore the Humungous Entertainment games and Pajama Sam was a massive influence on me as a child but tbh I will be upset if this outplaces something I like more than it. But damn, they don‚Äôt make them like this anymore.

**nooodisaster** (8): Bro you're really caring more about your homework going missing than your DOG?

**EnCaine** (7.2): r.i.p. homework

**1998tweety** (7): bop game

**akanewasright** (7): This is adorable

**bbfan132** (7): lmfao, interesting song choice

**bigbigbee** (7): I truly made my parents sick with how much I played this game when I was like 5

**cremeebrulee** (7): TK is this high enough to bribe you into choosing my rate next cycle, i realistically cannot score this higher

**Parkouricus** (7): why is this purple car more concerned with his homework than his dog??

**plastichaxan** (7): "goes on forever" sees duration...

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): the 90s were just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what stuck and apparently vaudevillian anthropomorphic objects were what stuck, iconic

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): That last line gets REAL existential

**AHSWeeknd** (6): snapped lowkey

**cheatviathan** (6): It‚Äôs better than a lot of songs in old edutainment games, but that‚Äôs a low bar to cross. If I were a five year old, I‚Äôd probably love it. As a senior in college with no nostalgia for this game, it just exists.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i learned nothing but that was cute

**pig-serpent** (6): It's charming enough.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Putt-Putt and Freddi Fish and Spy Fox were my childhood and to be completely honest I don't think I ever finished a single game

**seanderlust** (6): the time continuum ate my homework

**wavingwolves** (6): cute!!!

# Not getting a rate next cycle

**ManofOranges** (5): I mean... alright

**nyoom** (5): game a straight 10 tho

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): I can respect the theatrical energy even though it‚Äôs low-key annoying

**RandomHypnotica** (4.8): look, i love Humongous Entertainment games, they're some of the best edutainment/kid focused games ever made imo, and they conistently have great songs, fun gameplay and good visuals. That being said, the very crunchy aged nature of this song doesn't do it any favours, it's only a minute long, and in such a competitive rate, i just can't justify giving it a high score

**waluigiest** (4): the time continuum is right because this felt like it was 6 minutes long

**welcome2thejam** (4): I guess Putt-Putt passed me by as a kid?

**BebeLuigi** (3): ???

**CrimsonROSET** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8K3W1wPXeA

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (3): Some of the voices are too nasally for me

**fadedblue09** (3): Is this a shitpost

**N454545** (3): The recording quality is non-existent.

**UltimateDomon** (3): It's a cute song except for the part where it's not cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): This kids song is one minute long and it nearly gave me an existential crisis

**shhhneak** (2.3): this unlocked a memory of a game I forgot existed.

**Alumineous** (2): I don't know if I'm being too harsh on this song. 1 minute of absolutely nothing. Anyway, the video is giving heavy Cyberchase vibes, like the TV show on PBS.

**stryxen** (2): ew!

**celladonn** (1): Sorry for being a hater but I did not enjoy this

**Qwilphish** (1): pajama sam outsold

**Raxxin** (1): im sorry this is terrible

**RetrohTanner** (1): This song is definitely worse than Still Alive (Mirror's Edge), but it's also over in a fifth of the time so I can tolerate it more

**runaway3212** (1): This is so scary omg

**2dina3dworld** (0): I‚Äôd rather put a putt putt up my butt than listen to this again

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): ?

**hikkaru** (0): fuck this purple car bitch

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I-

**LesApfels** (0): It might be my lack of nostalgia but this does absolutely nothing for me

**skargardin** (0): I absolutely hate that this brought back memories of playing this game

Much like the game, this is a so bad it's good type song imo. I'm not super surprised to see it near the bottom, the song kind of sucks. But I won't lie - I still jam out to it whenever it comes on. Could be a teensy bit shorter though. Also Sega - put Sonic 06 on modern platforms already. It's a piece of modern art.

---

# It's no use!

**Parkouricus** (10): FLDSNASL FUCK, I CAN'T JUSTIFY THIS BECAUSE I JUST LOVE IT

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.6): oh THIS is where this shit is from? i recognized this instantly never knew this was fucking sonic lmao

**nooodisaster** (8.5): For the authentic Sonic experience, I listened to this at 2x speed.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.4): pop rap serve

**akanewasright** (8): This is dumb as shit

**Raxxin** (8): im one of the people that unironically played this game and this song was the best part about it

**RetrohTanner** (8): Love the lyrics to this... do you guys get it? Sonic is fast. He's like a running man. Do you get it?

**runaway3212** (8): his world seems fun

**UltimateDomon** (8): The singer's voice is obnoxious but the kind of obnoxious that fits with the song pretty well

**Chevsapher** (7.6): This track is trying far too hard, but it's an admirable effort. The verses and choruses are structured well, but the delivery is mildly cringey, and the production is overwhelming and muddled. The best part is the strings, but why the obvious MIDI? Could they not hire an actual orchestra?

**hikkaru** (7.5): sonic 06 is camp

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is very mid 2000‚Äôs

**nt96** (7.5): This is further proof that Sonic is immune to bad music, no matter how bad the game is.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): when I was a wee lad I would rent this one sonic game from the local Blockbuster and I ended up getting pretty far in the different modes but all I really wanted was to play with my chao boopey

**BoneStreetSand** (7.2): I only stan Sonic Heroes.

**2dina3dworld** (7): Every single one of these Sonic songs has a ‚Äútotally radical‚Äù energy

**Awkward\_King** (7): its sonic's world and we're just not living in it because he's a cartoon character grow tf up

**bbfan132** (7): it‚Äôs this high because of the awesome production

**CrimsonROSET** (7): someone said the singer sounded like sonic and i can‚Äôt unhear it

**welcome2thejam** (7): Who gave Sonic a mid-2000s pro wrestling entrance theme?

# Take this!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): i swear i've heard this melody before somewhere else, I don't feel like Sonic 06 is where I recognise it from, but i really can't place it... which means i think i know it from Sonic 06...

**EnCaine** (6.3): the instrumental is iconic but the Remember the Name-tier rap is so bad and not in a fun way. The other vocals feel like an afterthought as well

**bigbigbee** (6): The lyrics to this are SOOOOOO overdramatic, it sends me. "In this world / Where compromise does not exist" In the world of Sonic? The one where you rescue baby animals and also you can raise little blobby things and send them to kindergarten? The world of sonic, who is a blue hedgehog wearing sneakers?

**fadedblue09** (6): Ah, the black sheep of the franchise. Honestly never played this game myself. Anyway, song's okay, kinda a mess sometimes.

**Qwilphish** (6): ow the edge

**rotating3Dtext** (6): wtf lmao

**steelstepladder** (6): The Limp Biscuit vocals... omg. The chorus and strings are great though

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A song very befitting for Coldsteel the Hedgehog

**waluigiest** (6): okay in a really weird way I feel like this could be in Rent

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (5): hostage negotiator: please sonic. please let them go. we can make a deal. sonic: (loading gun) in this world...compromise does not exist man this has big, like, green day-taking back sunday-linkin park energy

**skargardin** (5): Am I secretely a sonic anti? I don't think I am but my scores beg to differ I guess skull

**kirby31200** (4.5): It's like Kidz Bop Linkin Park

**PhloxInvar** (4.5): It‚Äôs an awful song don‚Äôt get me wrong, but It‚Äôs funny. IN THIS WOOOOOORRRRLD

**Brendon-Urine** (4): just kind of sounds like cut rate linkin park, giving me BIG "in the end" energy on the rap verses.

**cheatviathan** (4): This slice of overwrought rap rock cheese is not the main theme song that Sonic ‚Äò06 needed, but most certainly the one it deserved. I still can‚Äôt figure out how to navigate that stupid turtle level in Silver‚Äôs story.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): maybe I‚Äôm not cut out for shopping at Hot Topic after all

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): Sounds like they tried to recreate the magic of the sonic adventure 2 soundtrack, but added rapping

**BebeLuigi** (3): Wow I really dislike this sorry

**letsallpoo** (3): this sounds like one of those 2014 boy group kpop songs ive spent my life trying to forget

**static\_int\_husp** (3): can't believe the sonic 06 sountrack was as bad as the game itself

**AHSWeeknd** (2): Trying so hard and for what

**brenda\_official** (2): i can't with this sonic music omg

**pig-serpent** (2): I normally like Sonic music but what the hell is this? Did 4kids write this song??? Both the rapping and the chorus on this thing are painful to listen to. Why are we rating this instead of This Machine, Team Chaotix Theme, or I Am All I Am?

**shhhneak** (1.8): singing off key in my chorus.

**alexpiercey** (1): what are y'all doin here

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Rap Rock (derogatory)

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Linkin Park meets The Offspring meets Limp Bizkit meets the adult guy on Kidz Bop - Bring Me To Life

**NFLfreak98** (1): Super glad they got Limp Bizkit on a discount for this

**sarcasticsobs** (1): love when zebrahead tries discount linkin park

**wavingwolves** (1): fuck you u/hikkaru

**1998tweety** (0): im sorry but this is trash. I LOVE Sonic but this song (and game ain't it). The way there are like 20 difference Sonic songs that could've taken this slot instead.

**ReallyCreative** (0): I am absolutely revolted by this song. It is the definition of trying too hard, trying to do too much, and without the slightest hint of self-awareness. A perfect fit for the fanbase.

**seanderlust** (0): what in the linkin park cover band is this

**stryxen** (0): aw the sonic stretch was going so well but oh my god the vocals are annoying

Sonic's not really off to the best start here huh. This song was hanging around day 1 for a while so again, not too much of a surprise. At least we manifested a remaster out of it. And if that's not my job as rate host then what is?

I love the song though. The vocals are a mess sure, but it just sounds so fun!

---

# Remaster HYPE

**1998tweety** (10): bop song from a bop game.

**agentofscranton** (10): sounds like it'd be in the soundtrack for a mid 00s animated scooby doo movie

**hikkaru** (10): the way they announced a remaster during this rate omg.. popheads impact

**Parkouricus** (10): this song is like if owl city was, like, 120% more intense and i love every second :D

**runaway3212** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IM FLYING - the incredible big big bee

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I can't in good conscience give this a 10, because the lyrics are truly SO generic...but this song is 500% up my alley. It's that j-pop, owl city, pop-punk sound ahhhh it makes me feel like I'm soaring

**shhhneak** (9.5): we wanted Sonic Heroes but this will do.

**akanewasright** (9): This just makes me happy idc

**nooodisaster** (9): Owl City served here

**Qwilphish** (9): very boy meets world in a good way

**nt96** (8.8): When you take MDMA for the first time.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Sounds like a hybrid of Owl City and a random forgotten pop-punk band from the 2000s.

**N454545** (8): It reminds me of the owl city song idk

**EnCaine** (7.7): there are some real momentum draining moments and the vocals are mid but the synth line alone is worth a 7 so...

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): The singer's voice feels like it's just so... lacking? Like it's not off key or anything, it just doesn't have any weight to it, the whole track just feels very light/buzzy honestly

**BoneStreetSand** (7.1): I only stan Sonic Heroes.

**bbfan132** (7): ‚Äúfun‚Äù - me on every other song

**BebeLuigi** (7): All around very cute ! Sonic shonen protagonist era

**Brendon-Urine** (7): not that I expect amazing lyrics from any of these really, but these are hard to listen to. Rachel Platten - Fight Song vibes. other than that, the song is great.

**Chevsapher** (7): I want to like this track, but the lyrics need work and the drumming is overdone.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I think I‚Äôd like this more if the vocals weren‚Äôt so muffled‚Ä¶ like imagine if this were an Owl City track, that would be hot

**slimboyfriend** (7): great background music

**UltimateDomon** (7): Fun but the vocals sound too much like something from a Nick Jr. show

# Waiting for that Sonic 06 remaster first

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this drummer is doing really good at hitting that one drum

**nyoom** (6): i didn't ask to get transported back to my middle school pop punk days (ft. owl city vibes for some reason) but here i am gonna go listen to motion city soundtrack for like two hours brb

**rotating3Dtext** (6): maybe this isn‚Äôt as good as I remember but I like the vocal effects

**seanderlust** (6): it feels like angels and airwaves on pcp, and i'm honestly not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing

**stryxen** (6): why is this so intense and so cinematic

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Oh my god I never realized how much nostalgia this song would give me? But also‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not as good as I remember lol. That synth gets annoying

**wavingwolves** (6): this is gay. happy pride month!

**2dina3dworld** (5): S Club 7 did it better

**CaptainDaisyG** (5): I got through five sonic songs and not one of them was sonic heroes...

**CrimsonROSET** (5): no but why is so much going on at once there are like three different beats and none are in sync with the vocals other than in the chorus

**alexpiercey** (4.5): Why is there so much sonic!!!!

**cheatviathan** (4): While I do like this game more than most, and think this is one of the good 3D Sonic games, that didn‚Äôt stop it from having one migraine inducing main theme. The heavily processed vocals, in conjunction with that obnoxious synth riff that permeates the entire track, sound too irritating and saccharine for my tastes.

**jayjaysortagay** (4): why were so many spots used up on this boring Sonic music...

**rslashpoopheads** (4): not my favorite All Time Low song

**skargardin** (4): By far my least favorite of the sonic songs in this rate

**steelstepladder** (3): The best sonic game herefull stop... shame it's the worst song of the bunch

**sarcasticsobs** (2.5): like a bad punk-y Hellogoodbye at first pass

**AHSWeeknd** (2): Maybe sonic shouldn‚Äôt have a soundtrack.

**ReallyCreative** (2): what is this late 2000s pop punk meets Owl City trainwreck

**sssaaage** (2): this song actually so bad idc probably the worst main sonic theme

**anothertown** (1): this is so dull

**RetrohTanner** (1): Feels like the "what plays in a 13 year old boys head when he gets free mozzarella sticks" meme. In a bad way

**pig-serpent** (0): Mom I want to listen to Blink 182! No, we have Blink 182 at home.

It's camp! Especially the **YOU SCUM** section which is iconic and helps save the song a bit. The song does frighten me a little though. I never played much Ape Escape, but it has its fans on the sub at least. It was hanging around the bottom rankwise, but it's been an interesting addition to the rate! This was included with the currated side, but after seeing Putt-Putt get in I am 99% sure it would have joined the rate in voting regardless.

#B-A-N-A-N-A-S

**ImADudeDuh** (11): ‚ÄúBanana Heartbreak‚Äù by Monkey Pink (known as Pink Monkey in some parts of Europe) is by far and away, the best song in this list. Having this rate to find the best song in the rate is an insult to this song, as the answer is plainly obvious that this song should and will win. However, as this rate has gone on for 23 days as of my submission, I will humor u/tiltcontrols and explain why this song is going to win the rate and why this whole rate is a farce. First of all, the song tells the story of a love story gone wrong. This is a classic song setting. It‚Äôs a tried and true formula that is always a guaranteed emotional piece of music. Monkey Pink loves this monkey (which is implied to be Specter), but she can sense his hesitation in his love. However, she tries to believe that they‚Äôre still bonded together by love. This is all typical love song sentiments, but the second half is where the song takes a turn. Monkey Pink realizes that it‚Äôs not a problem with HER but with HIM! #Girlboss ICON! She decides to just start insulting him and trying to show that it‚Äôs his fault that he doesn‚Äôt love her, as she tries so much in the relationship. This is obviously lampooning the 1950s sitcoms of the time and the often sexist nature of the starring couples. Her mind is just so impressive, we are left with no available options left except for one: to stan. Not to mention, the way she completely shifts genre mid song is astounding! She goes from the perfectly cute J-Pop (but in english) tune of the first half into raging punk anthem against men. She has the range darling. She‚Äôs doing in one song what Taylor tried to do in her whole career. She even ends the whole song with a proclamation of ‚ÄúHERE I COME!!!!!!‚Äù which is another feminist lyric, but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable explaining how. In conclusion, this song is the greatest song to even be written in the english language. The only possible way I can see this song losing, is if we are currently in the one universe out of the infinite others where the raters didn‚Äôt have a high enough IQ to understand the complexities of this masterpiece.

**1998tweety** (10): SMASHA

**akanewasright** (10): Idc this fucks

**jayjaysortagay** (10): why is this me singing Hannah Montana in the car when I was 10? This is so camp it either has to get a 1 or a 10 and I choose 10

**letsallpoo** (10): this is camp

**plastichaxan** (10): this is hyperpop (also when the guy starts screaming it got more iconic than it already was!!)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): better than anything in the breakup pop/rock rate tbh

**runaway3212** (10): 'insane but I love it' - Bee's friend saying what I was feeling

**teenwitches** (10): i wasn't ready for how hard this goes

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): WE STAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! /u/ImADudeDuh

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i gave this a neutral 6 but then the outro started ok this FUCKS

**wavingwolves** (9.4): fun

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Using ‚ÄúYou jerk / you scum / you fool‚Äù in songs should be a norm

**anothertown** (9): a serve

**steelstepladder** (9): This is so lovely, Alexa play Only Acting by KKB

**endcreditouilles** (8.7): You fool!!!! I CAN spend the rest of my life crying!! and I will!!!!!

**kirby31200** (8.5): A very weird fun surprise

**Chevsapher** (8.3): This went from clunky but cute to aggressive and psychotic, and I'm here for it. Gotta love those goofy disco strings.

**luckyphase** (8.2): pour one out for translated lyrics üòî

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Cascada wishes.

**Raxxin** (8): this eurobeat slay

**ReallyCreative** (8): what the fuck

**Roxieloxie** (8): Please there is so much going on here dsfsdkfsdfk. so basically for this rate i will talk about what i know about these songs. first up being this one, i know nothing about this game and the song from it does not tell me much

**astrologicalangel** (7.9): hahaha wtf

**hikkaru** (7.5): the vocals are serving noitstrue

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Billie Eyelash could NEVER angst this much

**seanderlust** (7.5): miss thing get a therapist

**Alumineous** (7): That intro was like Wii Fit Plus Rhythm Kung-Fu vibes. Anyway, who doesn't love a yandere song?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): is this rina sawayama

**EnCaine** (7): why am I trembling

**LesApfels** (7): YoU sCuM

**Parkouricus** (7): the only thing i understand is that she reminds me of gabbie hanna at the endg

**skargardin** (7): Ape Escape revival when??

# YOU SCUM

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I‚Äôm glad this was included for the meme but if I‚Äôm being real, as a song this doesn‚Äôt do that much for me. I like the production and some of the lyrical ideas but the melody is so awkwardly disjointed. The shift on the bridge is pretty iconic though, the payoff was definitely worth the buildup.

**NFLfreak98** (6.5): This definitely has ‚ÄòI still love you you stupid fuck‚Äô energy

**ignitethephoenix** (6): girlie needs some voice lessons. Also this has kpop song vibes but like on a budget

**Qwilphish** (6): Clunky lyrics, but the beat is killer. +2 for the ending what the hell. So fun

**rslashpoopheads** (6): thinking about how the bassline in this is basically the same as Donna Summer - I Feel Love

**stryxen** (6): wait the last 20 seconds ruined it

**waluigiest** (6): O_O

**bbfan132** (5): i don‚Äôt know if i liked this or hated it

**BebeLuigi** (5): I never played Ape Escape so I don't know much of it but it felt inconsequential

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): Having someone whisper in your ear at 4 am ‚Äúwhy are you trembling?‚Äù Is scary. It probably doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm not familiar with the game.

**UltimateDomon** (5): The vocals are kinda annoying

**celladonn** (4.5): It's camp but that doesn't mean it's good

**fadedblue09** (4): The vocals were not great to begin with, then it somehow just got worse

**nt96** (4): Why does this remind me of 4kids? Anyways, a bit too cheesy for my taste.

**welcome2thejam** (4): The inferior song from the soundtrack of a monkey themed game in this rate.

**bigbigbee** (3): The phrasing on this is sooooo bad. "I heard you/ secretly buried / the special / banana lunches / that i make / for you every day / oh-oh say/ say it's not true." TRANSLATORS! Phrasing and sound in the target language is just as important, if not more, than fidelity to the original lyrics' meaning when translating songs. stop this now.

**cheatviathan** (3): Any trace of promise that the instrumental hints at is quickly dashed by the vocals, which are amateurish in a grating way.

**ManofOranges** (3): Sounds like a song I'd hear in Yugioh or something.

**pig-serpent** (3): This is a pretty standard beat for eurodance and the vocals are grating.

=====

TiltControls: **N454545** (2): Lyrics are so so awkward. I think this is poor translation.

**nyoom** (2): trembling in my new suit because this song is so creepy what the hell

**RetrohTanner** (2): This song is... interesting, and I love Soichi Terada, but the vocal performance really isn't there.

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): this screams ‚Äúearly 2000s localization that prioritizes accurate translation over English lyrics that are actually pleasant to listen to‚Äù

**2dina3dworld** (1): is ape escape about the apes escaping from this stalker who sings like a squeaky Gretchen Weiners?

**shhhneak** (1): nah.

**CaptainDaisyG** (0): This made me want to (ape) escape the rate on the second song.

**cremeebrulee** (0): this song feels like a hallucination

**PhloxInvar** (0): This did not deserve a spot in the rate. I looked through the songs everyone else suggested for the cruel 16 spots, and 90% of the songs here deserve a spot compared to this lackluster song.

**slimboyfriend** (0): This song is a 12-year-old girl at a school talent show reading a poem she wrote aloud for the first time over a looping ringtone

tbh I've never been the biggest fan of this song. Maybe it's just the lack of context but it doesn't really go anywhere. But like the game I hear it talked about on Reddit All. The. Time. People mostly agreed and it stuck to the bottom for a majority of the rate. Was on the fence for including this on the currated side at first, but tavern style songs are huge in the fantasy genre with other games like Skyrim or Dragon Age, so it represents an important area there. Also fun fact that I'm just finding out while writing this is that this was sung by Tom Hiddleston's sister (who was also the VA for the character!)

# Praise Geraldo!

**2dina3dworld** (10): BARDCORE, FINALLY! I‚Äôve been waiting for this since the third Charity rate!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Witcher 3 snapped as did the soundtrack.

**endcreditouilles** (10): hmm. wind's howling.

**Chevsapher** (9): Lovely vocals, engrossing textures, strong melodies. Oh, and the game is pretty damn good too.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I‚Äôve never played *The Witcher* or even watched the tv show but I have maybe possibly read an embarrassing amount of fan fiction for it so like‚Ä¶ I should give this a good score then. But seriously I do quite like this stuff, old school medieval-esque music will probably never be mainstream but it scratches a specific itch every now and again so I love that there‚Äôs still people out there making it. Also I guess I can use this space to talk about the time that I went to a renaissance fair back in high school with some friends for extra credit and I didn‚Äôt have access to a fancy costume so I cut an old shirt into a vest and wore it over a white button up and then wore a straw hat and I was proud of myself for making the effort but everyone kept asking me if I was supposed to be amish. :\

**plastichaxan** (8.8): some ballads are valid in this rate

**cheatviathan** (8): One of the better stripped-back ballads of the rate. I find the instrumental presentation compelling, I do like how events from the game are being recounted in the lyrics, even if I‚Äôve never played it to completion.

**Parkouricus** (8): holy hell someone's gonna start crying here but not sure who

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The singer is so emotive, especially in the last chorus. It adds so much to the song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): remind me when this game goes on sale again so I can buy it because I was an idiot last time and didn‚Äôt buy it while it was on sale

**shhhneak** (7.5): This song made me realize we have no Skyrim songs in this rate. How did we fuck that up? Vote for VGV 2!

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**bbfan132** (7): pretty!

**BebeLuigi** (7): This is lovely!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): A nice lullaby in a not very lullaby-esque game.

**fadedblue09** (7): Operatic vocals and a stripped-down, folk production‚Ä¶ kinda ambivalent about this combination tbh

**pig-serpent** (7): Pretty cool acoustic song.

**RetrohTanner** (7): Wanna use this space to give a shout out to how hot Henry Cavill is in the Witcher show

# Naur Geraldo

**nooodisaster** (6.5): something about this is just off, maybe im not straight enough?

**stryxen** (6.5): she‚Äôs cutesy

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): It's very nice, but overall pretty forgettable in a list like this

**steelstepladder** (6): Toss a coin to your Witcher deserved

**akanewasright** (5): This is alright :/

**cremeebrulee** (5): all i could think about while this was playing was that i should play the bardcore version of pumped up kicks after this

**skargardin** (5): I absolutely love The Witcher so I suppose I should connect with this but I just... don't

**UltimateDomon** (5): This one is just kinda boring

**anothertown** (4): k...

**Awkward\_King** (4): what she so british for tf

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Praise Geraldo.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): we get it, you liked the vvitch

**nyoom** (4): this is like "good" music right? i should like this? snorefest tbh, more like priscilla's bong am i right

**Brendon-Urine** (3): not really a fan of how long this seems to drag on, just because of how samey it sound throughout

**ManofOranges** (3): Yes I'm balladphobic and proud.

**Raxxin** (3): this is super boring

**rslashpoopheads** (3): poopy

**wavingwolves** (3): waves no wolves

**bigbigbee** (2): Wish I liked this lol

**Qwilphish** (1): im over these types of medeival songs

**runaway3212** (1): ZZZZZZZZZZZ

Well at least it'll be easier to talk about the other Still Alive now that it's the last one left. This song's good, but has kind of aged a little since the game came out. I still like the song, but definitely see how it pales to a lot of the other tracks. I wasn't expecting it to go far, but I saw it on enough lists/discussions that I'm a little surprised it was nearly bottom 5. (Also the CHVRCHES song for the next game is 100x better than this imo)

---

# Can't apologize

**1998tweety** (10): im levitating what is this masterpiece

**Alumineous** (10): Looking at the title, I thought it was going to be a situation like Spotlight Kylie and Jessie, but thankfully that's not the case. Both Still Alive songs are great.

**Parkouricus** (10): very interested to see the battle of the Still Alives! this one is my favourite in terms of actual music taste, i love that 2008 production!! btw: why was catalyst so bad i'm still upset

**runaway3212** (10): This is immaculate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I was always going to give my 11 to the other song called Still Alive in this rate, but this blew my wig off and almost made me reconsider.

**agentofscranton** (9): sounds like a Katy Perry circa Prism-era ballad but like, good

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I‚Äôm pretty I‚Äôve played this game or at least the beginning even if I remember Nothing about it.

**Chevsapher** (8.3): This 2000s rock-inspired sound normally isn't my thing, but this is tight.

**nooodisaster** (8): Deeply undersold Portal and yet it still gets an 8. That's the level Portal's Still Alive plays at.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): cute

# Portal Stans

**wavingwolves** (7.3): can't relate because i can and i will apologize for still being alive

**fadedblue09** (7): I can see myself liking this more if the vocalist pulled more punch

**skargardin** (7): reminiscing over how mismanaged the mirror's edge franchise has been

**static\_int\_husp** (7): why did I think this was another CHVRCHES song at first

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I mean it sounds nice, but it also sounds like a generic pop song

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): this sounds like it would be the background track for a 2008 era YouTube Tutorial with unregistered Hypercam 2

**LesApfels** (6.5): Imagine how awkward filming this MV must've been like she's just standing on a rooftop and pointing at thin air

**luckyphase** (6.5): nostalgic, very 2004

**shhhneak** (6.3): Everything about this screams 2008.

**Awkward\_King** (6): cute next to gorgeous

**bbfan132** (6): something doesn‚Äôt work for me here but i‚Äôm not sure what‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs still decent

**BebeLuigi** (6): This song screams Kelly Clarkson

**ManofOranges** (6): The inferior still alive in this rate and I'm not sorry to say it!

**nyoom** (6): this song is disadvantaged by the fact that i've been listening to the Mt. Eden remix for so long this feels really disconcertingly slow and honestly pretty generic to me

**Qwilphish** (6): sort of forgettable but there are some really nice moments sprinkled in

**ReallyCreative** (6): what in the Adult Contemporary Singer Songwriter Dentist Office playlist

**steelstepladder** (6): The weaker Still Alive

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Apparently the singer is swedish even though I swore she was Shania Twain on the chorus

**celladonn** (5): GLaDOS outsold

**cheatviathan** (5): The weaker of the two ‚ÄúStill Alive‚Äù songs in this rate by a considerable margin. This song always leaves my head the second it's over, whereas the other one at least has a darkly humorous lyrical conceit and robotic vocals to unsettle in an otherwise rudimentary pop rock track.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): katy perry would put this in Witness

**kirby31200** (5): Generic trailer fodder

**seanderlust** (5): this would have been a bonus track on one of avril lavigne's later albums

**UltimateDomon** (5): The inferior Still Alive

**AHSWeeknd** (4): well, it‚Äôs very early 2000s

**akanewasright** (4): Hmm this isn‚Äôt really doing anything for me. It‚Äôs not bad (well, the vocal production feels a little weird in the first verse for some reason, but other than that). It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ not for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): eh, this feels like it was generated by a computer for use in a CW show

**ImADudeDuh** (4): how come the first thing this video made me think of was the video for Jennette McCurdy - Generation Love

**2dina3dworld** (3): this is the basic white girl song of the rate

**stryxen** (3): well you should apologise this was boring

**pig-serpent** (2): Not for long I hope. This is one of a few songs where it seems like the tone and style of the song is a complete misfit for the game it's supposed to represent.

**welcome2thejam** (2): How do you take a game about parkouring off skyscrapers and bore me this bad with its theme song?

**RetrohTanner** (0): There are probably songs in the rate that are worse than this, but this is one is by far the most boring

this is a robbery and that's all I can say

---

# Cantina band who?

**bigbigbee** (10): I unironically love this. Also I love that, in the video for this song on youtube. the dancer is objectively...not good (you can see their silhouette on the left). That's the true Just Dance (knockoff) experience.

**celladonn** (10): I adore this deeply and unironically

**cremeebrulee** (10): PLEASE I CANT BELIEVE THIS EXISTS

**endcreditouilles** (10): smh men only want one thing (to watch Han Solo buss it down to Jason Derulo)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): ENDED JAOSN DERULO!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): KINGIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**koopaastroopas** (10): can I give something a 10 and a 1 at the same time? We‚Äôll go with 10 for the impact

**ManofOranges** (10): I never owned a Kinect, so I never had the (mis)fortune of being able to play Star Wars Kinect but that doesn't mean I didn't experience in real time that absolute massacre of it online by people everywhere. I remember people in particular shitting on the just-dance-esque part of the game, and I can understand why, but... this song is such a BOP. Lives in my mind rent free. The image of Han and two backup dancer stormtroopers (I think they were stormtroopers) dancing to this adaptation of riding solo by Jason Derulo is such a fever dream moment of life and yet it's just so perfect.

**Marshynarsh** (10): iconic

**plastichaxan** (10): maybe if jason derulo still did this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): iconic, legendary, it IS the moment

**Roxieloxie** (10): if this does not win with a perfect 10 average what is the point of this all

**steelstepladder** (10): Better than episode 9

**BoneStreetSand** (9.1): This is unironically great and super wholesome. Pose bonus 1275.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): ok but Lego Star Wars was highkey one of my greatest gaming experiences of all time

**LesApfels** (8.5): The sequel trilogy should've just been this

**Alumineous** (8): What I want to know is how this even exists? Star Wars and Dance Central? Weird collab.

**cheatviathan** (8): ‚ÄúRidin‚Äô Solo‚Äù was one of about two genuinely good Jason Derulo singles, and LucasArts pushed it into great territory by making it about that guy who did the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs.

**EnCaine** (8): this is maybe the only jason derulo song (both this version and the original) that i would ever give over a 6

**UltimateDomon** (8): This song has completely replaced the original version in my mind, I can't remember a single thing about it, only Han Solo now

**welcome2thejam** (8): Would not be surprised if this is Harrison Ford's favorite part of the Han Solo lore

**Chevsapher** (7.9): These lyrics are a little too on the nose for me, but this track absolutely nails that circa-2010 electronic R&B vibe.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Instead of commenting on the capitalistic hellscape that we‚Äôre in that pushes companies to create products like this in an absurd bastardization of the idea of supply and demand I‚Äôm going to link to [this fascinating article that Polygon did about the life of the Kinect](https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/14/21064608/microsoft-kinect-history-rise-and-fall), even if you didn‚Äôt own one or aren‚Äôt into video games it‚Äôs a very interesting glimpse into the world of creating and launching a product, the difficulties of innovation, and how progress and profit aren‚Äôt always compatible.

**nyoom** (7): me: if one more nerd say one more word bout the stars war i'm gonna put my foot twelve parsecs thru they ass also me: ok yeah i'm han solo

**Parkouricus** (7): i was so disappointed when this scene didn't happen in the movie solo. or. actually for all i know it might as well have happened

# The Dark Side

**bbfan132** (6.5): charming but annoying

**nt96** (6): Everyone HATED this song when this came out and I was ready to give this a 1 the moment I saw this on the list. Strangely enough it‚Äôs‚Ä¶.not that bad now. Still cheesy af tho.

**RetrohTanner** (5): I know

**rotating3Dtext** (5): do I hate it do I love it??

**skargardin** (5): this is camp

**Brendon-Urine** (4): what

**NFLfreak98** (3.7): Jason Derulo definitely knows a lot about Star Wars guys

**seanderlust** (2): I am now anti-gamer rights thanks

**AHSWeeknd** (1): ‚Äúthe pain is gone‚Äù and yet this is the real pain.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (1): I do not like it, it sounds a like a boy band reject

**fadedblue09** (1): This is‚Ä¶.cursed

**nooodisaster** (1): You either give this a 1 or 10 there is no in between

**Raxxin** (1): this is the worst song of all time maybe

**ReallyCreative** (1): iconic trainwreck

**slimboyfriend** (1): wtf is this just dance for nerds rip off

**static\_int\_husp** (1): why do you expose me to this

tbh out of all the songs included in the rate this one waned on me the most. Usually every time I've submitted I throw in a track or two thinking "oh this'll be neat" then by the next submission cycle it's off my mind entirely. This probably would've been that track. **BUT** it is still kind of a bop and I've heard great things about the game itself. Also maybe having it place this poorly here will at least inspire someone to send the masterpiece known as the Tetris Type A theme to an instrumentals rate for redemption (if we ever get around to it)

---

# I-block

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Best production.

**alexpiercey** (10): the greatest glow up in gaming history

**Roxieloxie** (10): please why is this going so hard for fucking tetris

**Parkouricus** (9.5): this reminds me of like... a mix between the naked and famous and the lego movie videogame soundtrack which is very high praise actually

**agentofscranton** (9): kinda sounds like sara bareilles?

**BebeLuigi** (9): I love Tetris Effect soundtrack, it just works so well in game

**BoneStreetSand** (9): Surprisingly really great! Would play tetris just to hear this!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): stan tetris

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): Maybe EDM is good actually

**shhhneak** (9): Tetris goes this hard??

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Tetris did not have to go so hard like it‚Äôs a rave wtf

**Awkward\_King** (8): what this so hype for tf

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this is for a tetris game!?

**static\_int\_husp** (8): yo why does tetris of all things have an original song that goes this hard

**stryxen** (8): the drop doesn‚Äôt work as well as the rest of the song does

**Chevsapher** (7.8): A perfectly serviceable serviceable song, but it doesnt stand out among the competition. The best part is the string plucking.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): the drop was the best part of the song

**nt96** (7.5): The fact that this is from Tetris is sending me. Good song tho.

**seanderlust** (7.5): "When a being goes through a ‚ÄúMetamorphosis‚Äù they undergo a fundamental change of being. To progress into the future better and stronger than ever. This change can be hard, but together, as a humanity on this planet, we can do it." - a description of a song from tetris on genius.com

**runaway3212** (7.3): I want to play tetris effect so bad

**pig-serpent** (7): The build up on this song is hype af but the drop does not live up to it.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): Tetris and having bops for a soundtrack, name a more iconic duo

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ this was made for a TETRIS game?? Well I guess it slaps

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs nice but a lot of it sounds like base GarageBand samples

# S-block

**1998tweety** (6): this is...ok

**bbfan132** (6): i sleep kind of

**sarcasticsobs** (6): just makes me want to listen to purity ring

**skargardin** (6): This was pretty cool but never really went anywhere for me to justify giving it a higher score

**cheatviathan** (5): It takes a lot for an EDM track to really grab me, and this one doesn‚Äôt have it. The vocals are good, but it doesn‚Äôt do enough to elevate this otherwise mediocre piece of EDM.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): cult leader but make it girl boss and edm for some reason? Idk gave me a headache

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I‚Äôm basically using these blurbs to tell stories from my childhood at this point and this is DEEP lore but if anyone remembers the webcomic hosting site Smackjeeves, back when I was a kid I toyed around with posting sprite comics on there and I was in one collaborative comic where we made video game characters fight in tournament style brackets and I was assigned a matchup of Samus Aran vs. the L block from Tetris and just to be quirky I had the Tetris block win... it was actually a fairly cinematic fight and one of the better ones in the short lived history of that comic. The L block would later lose to Megaman. Anyways this song is fine but it‚Äôs sooo generic and corporate in a bad way‚Ä¶ like they might as well have had the guys in the board room who focus grouped it do backing vocals, it would have made it more interesting.

**ManofOranges** (5): Feels like a very odd song to have for a game about tetris??

**nooodisaster** (5): Lowkey very Spotify radio 25 songs after a Charli XCX song

**nyoom** (5): i've always suspected tetris effect to be some kind of mkultra psy op and this isn't helping

**Qwilphish** (5): this is certainly a song

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I prefer Theme A

**welcome2thejam** (5): I know there's been tons of new Tetris games since the original, but it somehow feels sacrilege to have Tetris music that isn't just riffs off the originals.

**bigbigbee** (4): SUCKS compared to the original tetris song! the original tetris song bangs! Your fave wishes they wrote the original tetris song!

**UltimateDomon** (4): Not my thing

**akanewasright** (3): does this sample rise by solange or just take the melody for its opening

**Brendon-Urine** (3): eesh... this really just sounds like a mediocre CHVRCHES rip off, like down to every detail

**hikkaru** (3): it's so funny to me that a tetris game has a whole ass soundtrack with vocals and whatnot

**ReallyCreative** (3): This is a game about STACKING BLOCKS. IT IS NOT THIS SERIOUS!!

**RetrohTanner** (3): This feels really dated for a song released in late 2018

**fadedblue09** (2): Sounds like one of those no-name electropop singers I'm forced to listen to on All Stars rates

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Electronic music should never ever be this boring.

**steelstepladder** (1): This is a less annoying AJR song... why did they replace the synth with bees?

**wavingwolves** (0): why do you need such a dramatic song for a tetris game i must ask...

SUNFLOWER! Another track that was never doing amazing throughout the rate, though it's a little cuter than Ape Escape or Putt-Putt to place a bit higher at least. I used to LIVE PvZ and while I didn't rate the song amazingly the instrumental soundtrack is actually fantastic.

Lucky for Laura she's got another track still in (To The Moon - yeah what a tonal shift).

---

# Lorde who?

**agentofscranton** (10): so true bestie we do NOT want zombies on our lawn

**cyborglilith** (10): vocalist of our generation

**hikkaru** (10): SUNFLOWER!!!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): will probably be one of the first songs out but idgaf BOP!

**jayjaysortagay** (10): Grammy win when?

**nooodisaster** (10): When your grandpa visits your house

**PhloxInvar** (10): Nothing to say but... THERES A ZOMBIE ON YOUR LAAWWWWN.

**Roxieloxie** (10): i never played this game but this is an absolute banger

**runaway3212** (10): I would give this an 11 if I didnt already give it

**Awkward\_King** (9): singlehandedly got me to redownload pvz

**celladonn** (9): Now why is this a bop

**Chevsapher** (9): THERE'S BUTTER ON MY HEAD

**CrimsonROSET** (9): is this what primavera is like

**Parkouricus** (9): CATTAIL IS THE BEST PLANT FIGHT ME

**akanewasright** (8.5): I think about this song at least once a month

**BoneStreetSand** (8.3): Sexy and cute.

**anothertown** (8): something sweet for the kids

**cremeebrulee** (8): HARRY STYLES IS OVER!!!!!!

**fadedblue09** (8): You know, this is a childhood game for me and as much as I wanna give it a meme 10, it would be hypocritical for me to not criticize this considering my other scores lol. Laura's vocals and the beats pleasantly blend, but those zombie vocals kinda ruin the mood.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This game makes me so nostalgic even though I never played it, it was kind ahead of its time in a lot of ways. I feel like, in this era where mobile gaming is bigger than ever, a lot of games are chasing the aesthetic and gameplay loop that this game refined.

**pig-serpent** (8): This is bad but in a good way.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): damn right we don't!

**steelstepladder** (7.6): Cute!

**1998tweety** (7.5): SMASHA

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.5): it‚Äôs cute

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Ok but this kinda vibes

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Camp?

**stryxen** (7): I have so much nostalgia for this but i could swear it used to sound much better

**waluigiest** (7): the scream scared me wtf

**plastichaxan** (6.8): a zombie??? in your lawn?? more likely than you think

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): Selena who? Laura Shigihara is the new whisper queen

# Brainiacs

**EnCaine** (6.3): i've always thought this was kinda lame, but catchy

**bigbigbee** (6): Neither bad nor good enough to be truly enjoyable for me but I enjoy the concept and i LOVE the game

**welcome2thejam** (6): Tried not to cry, but "Road cones protect my head" just got to me man

**AHSWeeknd** (5): sunflower ain‚Äôt got vocals but sure has production value

**cheatviathan** (5): It was fun the first three times I heard it, but the novelty wore off incredibly quickly, and what‚Äôs left is an instrumental that sounds like a stock preset and a weak vocal performance.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): flashbacks to when I actually played this game for a bit but gave up

**SFbby** (5): I still play Plants vs. Zombies Heroes daily :/

**skargardin** (5): the seagulls (?) sound really took me out

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I thought we just rated Dedicated Side B

**N454545** (4): What was this recorded with????

**seanderlust** (4): I think if I played PvZ, I would like this a lot more

**UltimateDomon** (4): Cute enough I guess

**bbfan132** (3): stream solar power by lorde

**BebeLuigi** (3): This is a song... I guess...

**nyoom** (3): this is in the goldiflops zone of being at once not consistently cute enough to be purely charming and not cohesive or substantial enough to be considered on the merits of its content

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (2): I do not like the put on voice used for this

**Qwilphish** (2): +1 for being funny. 2009 was a simpler time. this song is peak millenial humor

**Raxxin** (2): now this is hyperpop

**RetrohTanner** (2): Apologies to Laura Shigihara but this is not it. I know it's under a minute long but Don't Forget from Deltarune should've been in the rate instead

**2dina3dworld** (1): this sounds like one of those creepy kid YouTuber songs

**ReallyCreative** (1): Grimes sounds good here, Elon sounds even better

**Brendon-Urine** (0): This is quaint and cute for a game like PvZ but as a standalone song this is unlistenable, especially with the zombie voice and the record scratches

Bang Bang!! There are no shortage of harder rock songs in gaming, but this was the one that went into the rate. This song is a nice change of pace from the rest of the songs, but unfortunately that didn't help it and it (again) spent most of the time around the bottom ranks. While it would've been cool to include other tracks of this style like Resident Evil or Doom, I'm not sure they would've fared any better. I like the song, but against the competition it kind of falters. Would be much better hearing it in game fighting demons and monsters I imagine. (Also for any non-fans just be glad we didn't rate the 7 minute version on streaming.)

# Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series

**Alumineous** (10): I should hate this, but I don't. Music video is also cool, too.

**cremeebrulee** (10): hold on i‚Äôm hearing something

**hikkaru** (10): wait omg this slaps but it's gonna be robbed for sure

**Parkouricus** (10): BANG BANG BANG!! .... pull my devil trigger :flushed:

**seanderlust** (10): one part metal, one part hardstyle dance, three parts absolute banger. shake well.

**celladonn** (9): This bangs???

**N454545** (9): It's good

**pig-serpent** (9): This style of industrial metal has a really high rate of backfiring and sounding like total garbage but this song is nailing it.

**teenwitches** (9): i want to cybergoth dance to this under a bridge

**UltimateDomon** (9): This song rules so fuckin hard

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): That chorus went hard, it gives me early 2010s dance-pop vibes.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (8): a bop tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (8): is your devil trigger your- oh my

**kirby31200** (8): "Pulling the devil trigger" is what I call flicking the bean

**ManofOranges** (8): This does sound like it would play over an AMV

**PhloxInvar** (8): I like the instrumentals. The rap‚Äôs better after a few days, the chorus has a good melody. I definitely prefer the shorter version because the long version is not as enjoyable.

**runaway3212** (8): I love MGK

**skargardin** (8): I love the pop rock rate!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Edgy in the funnest way

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it does slap

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): the first fews notes in the melody of the chorus make me think I‚Äôm listening to Bubblegum Bitch for a split second

**EnCaine** (7.2): there's no real shadow the hedgehog music in this rate so this will have to do üò≠ this kinda sucks and bangs

**cheatviathan** (7): I‚Äôm disappointed that nothing from Metal Gear Rising made it onto this rate, but this will do in a pinch. I‚Äôm all for a good nu-metal throwback, and this is that.

**Chevsapher** (7): The production has cool moments, but the song itself is rather mediocre.

**Roxieloxie** (7): we love emo music

**steelstepladder** (7): If a metal song was gonna make it from a hack and slash game I'd prefer Rules of Nature. This is still good though

# Combo'd by Dante one too many times

**bbfan132** (6.5): not totally my thing but i respect it

**akanewasright** (6): I feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong mood for this. But it might also be bad

**fadedblue09** (6): This honestly bangs, but the vocals were unremarkable

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this grew on me significantly as i relistened to the playlist a couple times, but i still hate the first verse. i also cant get the idea out of my mind that in the video they look like extras in the fnaf section of 2015 youtube rewind im so sorry

**2dina3dworld** (5): There were some interesting ideas in here, but none of them were particularly well-executed. Especially the breakdown. It sounded really promising and then kind of‚Ä¶ fizzled.

**nooodisaster** (5): ....do the Emo Rate?

**nt96** (5): not my style

**ReallyCreative** (5): is it called "Devil May Cry" because you force him to listen to this in the game? I'd cry too

**rslashpoopheads** (5): the intro fucks

**stryxen** (5): why is this so eurovision (and so average)

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Too long, and falls in that uncanny valley of being too edgy to take seriously but also not edgy enough to be a guilty pleasure‚Ä¶ also ‚ÄúPull my devil trigger‚Äù is definitely a sexual euphemism

**wavingwolves** (4.2): are you telling me the devil may cry over this?

**Brendon-Urine** (4): too much wub wub wub for me

**BebeLuigi** (3): I already didn't like the song but the mv looks so awkward I wish I didn't see it sdfgsdqfsd Devils Never Cry >>>>>>>> this

**Qwilphish** (3): objectively probably not the worst song. but im not a metal head

**nyoom** (2.5): your middle school archenemy's favorite DDR track

**alexpiercey** (2.2): the chorus is fine but woof that dude

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): aaaaaahhhhh this is too scary for me

**anothertown** (1): lmfao this video looks so cheaply made for a triple A video game budget??

**jayjaysortagay** (1): no pls

**ImADudeDuh** (0): the comments were turned off on the video, and I 100% understand why after listening to it. Sounds like evanescence tried to make a song for Dance Dance Revolution

It's a really fun song!  Though like a lot of these bottom tracks kind of pales compared to the remaining songs. Honestly I thought 2 RDR tracks was pushing it so I'm very surprised (but not disappointed) that we got another! Also more songs should use a digeridoo tbh.

# Plays Sims to build houses

**2dina3dworld** (10): the fact that is genuinely the best country song I‚Äôve heard in a couple of years‚Ä¶ sheeeesh

**akanewasright** (10): this will be robbed.

**Alumineous** (10): This is what the gay men in front of Link's house probably listen to while upgrading his house.

**fadedblue09** (10): I just love pure, raw country like this

**Roxieloxie** (10): you go you funky lil cowbow

**seanderlust** (10): SO CUTE

**steelstepladder** (10): This puts the Ye in my Haw if you catch my drift

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Joanne Act II

**CrimsonROSET** (9): home on the range realness

**ImADudeDuh** (9): they put as much country as they could possibly fit into this one song.

**pig-serpent** (9): Goofy country is certainly one of the better types of country.

**Chevsapher** (8.7): The folk style melodies and the fiddle make this a warm, interesting track. The "boing" sound panned to the right is annoying, but I can live with it.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this i can get behind this is cool i like this

**celladonn** (8.5): Will definitely blast this next time I build a house

**bbfan132** (8): daniel lanois king (if he produced this? lol)

**bigbigbee** (8): didgeridoo

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): ugh this is good but my dad started playing country music that sounded like this once while I was helping him with some yardwork once and we started having a conversation about how the opioid epidemic has ravaged so many small rural communities and then my dad just casually told me that he tried meth when he was in college and it‚Äôs like bruh‚Ä¶ you wouldn‚Äôt even give your kids Tylenol you just made us drink water when we had headaches. Anyways that‚Äôs all I can think about when I hear this

**nooodisaster** (8): Millennials spending $500,000 on an empty 600 sq foot plot of land in LA to become homeowners

**Parkouricus** (8): wh. what the hell why is this so cute :)

**skargardin** (8): genuinely a big bop

**welcome2thejam** (8): Gonna get the Squad together and build us a house I guess

**1998tweety** (7.5): this is kinda nice

**stryxen** (7.5): my favourite comment on the youtube upload was ‚Äú0% NUDITY 0% DRUGS 10% LYRICS 90% MUSIC 100% ENJOYMENT‚Äù like ??? what????

**UltimateDomon** (7.5): Fun yeehaw times with the bros

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): This is basically a country ballad and I am so picky with ballads.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): me and the boys building a house

**nyoom** (7): aw this is cute

**ReallyCreative** (7): more of a homewrecker myself

**runaway3212** (7): this is what I imagine those three pigs were singing before getting violently eaten by the wolf

**slimboyfriend** (7): Yeehaw bitch!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I don‚Äôt like folk music but‚Ä¶ this song just puts you in a mood

**wavingwolves** (6.9): good

# Choice of Minecraft shelter is a 2x2 hole

**cheatviathan** (6): A little too chipper for my taste, and the novelty wears thin by the two minute mark, but it‚Äôs fine for what it is. Not the most notable Red Dead II song in this rate.

**hikkaru** (6): yeehaw ladies!!!

**Brendon-Urine** (5): MC Boing with the surprise appearence

**Qwilphish** (4): issa vibe, but not my vibe

**EnCaine** (3.7): yeehaw

**anothertown** (3): ok

**BebeLuigi** (3): I'm not the biggest fan of country, especially this kind

**pietrohonkhonk** (3): this song is about as interesting as building a house

**plastichaxan** (3): i don't really know how to rate this??

**RandomHypnotica** (3): Sorry, this is just anti hypnocore. I appreciate the didgeridoo, and that this may be the first song we've rated with one in it, but it's just too twangy for me to enjoy, it's just grating to me

**Raxxin** (2): no thanks..

**rslashpoopheads** (1): why'd this series get 3 whole songs when they sound like this

KK Slider, a multi-genre legend! I think with this rate it'd be a little difficult to choose a single KK slider to represent everyone's tastes without snubbing someone's favourite, but perhaps it still would've worked better as a vote. Anyways, why this one? Well this is the first game theme K.K. Slider song available wayyy back in the GameCube Animal Crossing. It also doubles as one of the themes that plays during parts of the day, so that alone is a nostalgia reason why I love the track. Good alternates probably would've been K.K. Cruisin' or K.K. Disco, but it's impossible to say how those would've gone without a full on K.K. slider rate (rate comittee I am open to talks :waiting:)

This is also our first song that spent any trackable time outside of day 1! (granted it was for two ballots, but still)

---

# K.K. Slider superfans

**1998tweety** (10): incredibly iconic, K.K. Slider deserves a #1

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why do I genuinely like this, it‚Äôs honestly good.

**endcreditouilles** (10): Animal Crossing will always have a special place in my heart and that is in no small part due to the music. The score plays such a unique role in the game and the personality and charm of this track (and others) will forever be a vibe.

**hikkaru** (10): so comfy, so iconic, we love animal crossing

**ReallyCreative** (10): This is an artist that has completely revolutionized himself with every single era, outsold every single one of your faves, single-handedly invented countless genres, and has done so without compromising his values or integrity and you want to hop into the Daily Daycare thread to talk about Taylor Swift? Baby, this is so humiliating for you. Go buy a remix (derogatory) like someone gives a shit because Taylor could NOT in her lifetime do what K.K. Slider does in these 2 minutes and 12 seconds. She does not have the talent or ability and I need you to understand that.

**stryxen** (10): SING MR. SLIDER folklore found dead in the forest

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): he has such a way with words

**welcome2thejam** (10): Nothing but respect for the creator of Music, K.K. Slider.

**nt96** (9.5): I absolutely loved it but I felt a bit feel sad afterwards, like a longing for your childhood sort of thing. Such a vibe, nonetheless!

**BebeLuigi** (9): I would die for a K.K Slider album... Nintendo get on it

**ManofOranges** (9): I don't know what the fuck she is saying but girl I am LIVING.

**Parkouricus** (9): when that whistle comes in... this is super relaxing and i've never even played any animal crossing games but it still gets me nostalgic. my favourite white dog with acoustic guitar song

**Roxieloxie** (9): AC is a vibe, ive been playing the original one for the first time over discord vc since its easy to stream and its been fun seeing what improved over the years, its fun, just me and my lil whitesona walking around getting bullied by tom nook

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): not his best but KK Slider still king of music

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): some part of me really aggressively wants to compare this to sum bout u, and if this gets robbed like that was i *will* be sad

**bbfan132** (8): i like the minimalism displayed here

**Chevsapher** (8): Simple, but super cute. The vocal manipulation in Animal Crossing is fascinating.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): KK Slider as a music legend is one of those weird things where I can‚Äôt tell if people genuinely believe it or if they‚Äôre just memeing but just to be clear I am of the idea that he has had an actual influence on the music scene. Maybe not, like, the Hot 100 music scene but the sound palate of Animal Crossing has had a clear impact on a certain flavor of artists like [Kero Kero Bonito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cp2n4--1QA), [mxmtoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti5Q-JunTYA), or [the DESKPOP collective](https://deskpopmusic.bandcamp.com) who have all (at various points) embraced the laid back synths and old eight bit beeps that were a huge part of giving the *Animal Crossing* series its infamous ‚Äúvibes.‚Äù [Bandcamp did a nice little article about the success/legacy of the game](https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/animal-crossing-inspired-music-guide) and discussed some albums directly inspired by it if you wanna check that out but in general I think the music of KK Slider and this series have been a big touching point for a lot of younger musicians/music fans even if they don‚Äôt realize it. ALSO I‚Äôd like to inform everyone [that there is an *Animal Crossing* anime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hf6u_7Bo1g) and it‚Äôs the best video game movie of all time, it actually made me cry when I watched it.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its ok if a little repetitive

**rslashpoopheads** (8): iconic

**runaway3212** (8): this is strangely comforting

**slimboyfriend** (8): what can I say, I'm a guitar girl at heart

**waluigiest** (8): my favorites are Mountain Song and KK Metal, but this is pretty nice

**shhhneak** (7.6): The 7am GCN nostalgia that this has.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I sympathize with the host that it must have been tough to choose a KK Slider song since there simply are so many, and the most famous one has already been rated this year in Charity Rate 3. That being said, this isn't my favorite KK song, though I'm scoring it pretty high just based on how much I love KK as a concept in general.

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.5): Outsold that flop Taylor Swift

**jayjaysortagay** (7): cute, reminds me of Wii Music

**kirby31200** (7): Very chill and simplistic. Not the most exciting or interesting pick, but I think its simplicity is what kind of makes it special

**nooodisaster** (7): He has a point, he‚Äôs an icon, he‚Äôs a legend and, he is the moment now come on now

**nyoom** (7): not really sure where this nostalgia is coming from. i've never even crossed an animal, except for that dog i barked at every day on my way back from tennis in grade school. but that dog was a dick and totally deserved it. not kk slider tho, kk is a gentle and artistic soul. he would never make you sit there and listen to the entirety of through the fire and flames

**seanderlust** (7): spill bestie

**steelstepladder** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd7g3rRzSng

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): This song is just white boy with a guitar music in dog form

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): mr slider has outdone himself on other tracks i fear

**plastichaxan** (6.5): i don't think i'm allowed to give kk a low rating but i'm also balladphobic so this will do

**wavingwolves** (6.2): this sounds like a ringtone (non-derogatory)

**akanewasright** (6): Cute, but I don‚Äôt have good memories of animal crossing to make this nostalgic or anything. The one time I really played much, I realized that I‚Äôd accidentally hoarded my family‚Äôs switch in my bedroom for nearly a full day. I knew my younger sibling had been playing this game a lot, and that you sort of had to check in every day. So I tried to play it at 11:30 that night and do the game‚Äôs tasks for the day, but I understood NOTHING, and just‚Ä¶ found myself flailing about the map for 30 minutes. I didn‚Äôt know how to progress anything I was supposed to progress, Tom Nook was sleeping or something, and I generally did not know where anyone was. So anyway I don‚Äôt like animal crossing that much </3

**astrologicalangel** (6): Bubblegum K.K. outsold

**CrimsonROSET** (6): no but i literally thought this was elevator music and was wondering when the song was gonna start

**ignitethephoenix** (6): cute but vocal is a stretch on here (sorry KK). Wish this was a different kk cover

**Qwilphish** (6): Sort of simple. Cute but the vocals are sort of harsh

**skargardin** (6): Not K.K. Slider's finest work but it's cute

**UltimateDomon** (6): KK has done better tbh

**Brendon-Urine** (5): not the best song AC has to offer unfortunately

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): I found the fake voice very irritating :(

**EnCaine** (5): very mid as far as songs by the legendary Daddy Slider go

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Ok but if Bubblegum KK were in this rate it would be getting all the 11s

**RandomHypnotica** (4.6): definitely very peaceful and iconic, but it‚Äôs got nothing on New Leaf 7PM, and really it's just glorified background music (like, is whistling and some grunts really vocals)

**anothertown** (4): the kk soundfont doesn‚Äôt count as vocals!

**cheatviathan** (4): This isn‚Äôt an attack on K.K. Slider the person. I met him at PAX East last year, and he seems like a cool dude. I just have an allergic reaction to coffee house acoustic guitar acts. Also, while his eccentric vocal style has earned him a large audience, it irritates me when I‚Äôm not in the mood for it... which is most of the time.

**NFLfreak98** (3): I‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt speak dying synth

**pig-serpent** (3): Not really a fan of the riff, KK's vocals are a tad annoying, and the whistling feels out of place. Nah

**celladonn** (2): I know K.K. is capable of better than this

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): We're really stretching the definition of "vocal" here.

**fadedblue09** (1): Maybe I should set up a KK Slider hate account

**PhloxInvar** (1): It‚Äôs not even like a top 15 K.K. Slider song.

**N454545** (0): No. Being in a cute game doesn't magically make the vocals less grating.

The curated side of this rate has been a mix of my own choices as well as some "critically recognized" tracks. (AKA appears everytime someone on Askreddit or Games asks this same question). This one and the Witcher track appeared near the top of almost every one of those, but even before the rate started I figured they were both too anti-popheads to do well in this rate.  Still, at least now we've covered our bases. I'm honestly surprised this one made it out of bottom 10 at least (in a good way). As for the track itself, Jose Gonzalez is an amazing artist (if you like the more acoustic muted style) and he brings his talent to this track. Most people who played the games probably remember the moment this comes on. Like a few others going today this maybe works a lot better if seen in game, but it's still a fantastic track.

**welcome2thejam** (10): I'm playing through RDR for the first time atm, and even knowing all about the beloved Far Away scene, it still hits for me, making you feel the character's melancholy and loneliness while also putting you in the mood for some Real Cowboy Shit.

**nt96** (9.5): Beautiful. If this doesn‚Äôt make the top 5 so help me God‚Ä¶.

**stryxen** (9.2): finding out this was jos√© gonz√°lez wasn‚Äôt surprising this is so beautiful

**fadedblue09** (9): This has cinematic Western vibes all over it

**ReallyCreative** (9): I love this kind of broody folksy country and it's so sad that it will be eliminated with speed and prejudice

**Chevsapher** (8.6): Minimalism done right. I like how the chords change the second time around.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): To misquote *Pride and Prejudice* this is a bop, but not boppy enough to tempt me

**PhloxInvar** (8): I love guitar apocalyptic music, and this is basically that. It‚Äôs not quite Shardlight levels since it‚Äôs more cowboy and that‚Äôs not really my aesthetic, but great nonetheless.

**pig-serpent** (8): Chill acoustic country stuff.

**Roxieloxie** (8): yee fucking haw

**seanderlust** (8): this is very spooky sounding. I quite like it.

**skargardin** (8): this is very pleasant but also a painful reminder that i have rdr2 in the shelf collecting dust

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): nice but too one note

**Parkouricus** (7.5): sadly i'm gonna assume this works better in context, lovely atmosphere though

**BebeLuigi** (7): Love the Wild West vibe, very relaxing

**cheatviathan** (7): I‚Äôm sure this hits especially different in the game‚Äôs narrative arc, but divorced from it, it‚Äôs one of the most self-evident 7/10s in this entire rate. A solid enough folksy acoustic ballad amongst a rate with plenty of them.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this lowkey feels homemade but also this gives me gay vibes

**nooodisaster** (7): I feel like I teleported to r/indieheads for a second..

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It sounds alright. Just not the kind of music I listen to

# Yee-naw

**nyoom** (6.5): the melody line is great, wish i liked his voice more

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i mean that‚Äôs what i expect from a red dead redemption track

**RandomHypnotica** (6): It's got a nice melody, but feels very repetitive

**runaway3212** (6): atmospheric but boring

**UltimateDomon** (6): Something about the singer's voice kinda bugs me but it's not too bad

**waluigiest** (6): indieheads rate 2

**plastichaxan** (5): zzzzz

**rslashpoopheads** (5): short attention span gang we out here

**wavingwolves** (5): this man sounds so bored someone give him something to do

**1998tweety** (4): this is doing nothing for me sorry, the vocals aint it

**2dina3dworld** (2): this sounds like what someone‚Äôs dad would listen to while going through a divorce

**Awkward\_King** (2): this is kinda just there for me. if this were by orville peck id like it

**ManofOranges** (1): Here's a fun fact: I have NEVER liked read dead redemption. And I don't mean to be not like other girls or something but I have just never cared for it and it seems that applies to its music to!

**Qwilphish** (0): popheads cant force me to listen to country

This song is such an underrated bop. It's basically just joy and camp combined and songified. I don't know how many people will remember this game since it's a bit harder to find now, but back in 2010 this was one of the main mobile games on the market. also cause this rate had no other browser reps and this fills a pretty good niche there.

---

# Pressed Z and your wishes came true!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): it was camp

**ManofOranges** (10): Robot Unicorn Attack was a moment, and there will never be another moment like it (partially because it seems like flash games are extinct now sadly) but I distinctly remember playing this game and this song absolutely contributed to the game being as memorable as it was.

**Qwilphish** (10): ICONIC ICONIC ICONIC ICONIC

**rslashpoopheads** (10): eye con neek

**luckyphase** (9.5): ive been thinking od this song lately

**Parkouricus** (9.5): not sure if this is "ironically" good or just... really good

**EnCaine** (9): i did not expect to be rating Erasure today

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the fact this is one of the only songs I know on here haha. I remember in high school we used to play this game on my friends iPad all lunch and the song was so iconic to us

**skargardin** (9): these synths!!!

**Chevsapher** (8.7): I was not expecting Erasure in this rate, but I'm not mad.

**1998tweety** (8.5): BOP

**bbfan132** (8.5): fun!!

**UltimateDomon** (8): I wish I lived in the music video

**LesApfels** (7.5): This production is incredible oh my god

**seanderlust** (7.3): i'm....just gonna pretend I don't see the music video and focus on the fact that the song is Pretty Good.

**shhhneak** (7.1): meme song good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): ‚Äúopen your eyes for me, I see, your eyes are open‚Äù is very ‚Äúall I breathe is air‚Äù vibes

**welcome2thejam** (7): I straight-up LOST it when the dude started backflipping around and flying.

#Your dreams did not come true

**nyoom** (6.5): do you know that picture of the cat waving rainbow pennant banners and it says "i wish to live in tireless festivity / i want to live & breathe endless splendor" that's how this song makes me feel objectively it sucks tho

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): not as fun as i remember

**AHSWeeknd** (6): it‚Äôs good but gets annoying really quick.

**fadedblue09** (4): I know this as a meme song

it's a nice track, but a little bland when free of context. Also could be a teensy bit shorter (though that's true of most of the FF tracks). Anyways this was solidly day 2 for a while, but the last half of ballots were enough to bring it down here.

---

# tidusandyunalaughing.gif

**2dina3dworld** (10): the lyrics translation made me tear up

**cyborglilith** (10): WIG

**RetrohTanner** (10): I just want good things for Tidus and Yuna

**skargardin** (10): Balladphobia-ists do NOT interact

**steelstepladder** (10): Tidus Laughing Gif

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): the violin solo has me in tearssss

**Marshynarsh** (9.5): time to cry

**1998tweety** (9): beautiful

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I really like the strings here

**runaway3212** (9): I love violins

**bbfan132** (8.5): this was v relaxing

**Chevsapher** (8.5): I haven't idea what's being said, but I'm going to pretend this is a power ballad.

**nt96** (8.5): the violins tho :o

**BebeLuigi** (8): It's beautiful

**celladonn** (8): I really want to replay FFX now... also I'm going to take a moment to shout out a song we should have rated, Memories Of Life from FFIX (the best Final Fantasy)

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's very pretty and pleasant

**rslashpoopheads** (8): not gonna lie I cried when I finished this game

**seanderlust** (8): I really hope the shitpost for this is that super uncomfortable yuna and tidus laughing scene

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Again, generic 90s anime closing vibes, but the violins make it memorable

**Parkouricus** (7.5): i think i'd LOVE this if those notes in the chorus didn't feel so flat, and i want to love this. but they do feel like that. godlike game though

**UltimateDomon** (7.5): That violin player went off

**akanewasright** (7): I raised this score after the violin solo

**Alumineous** (7): I haven't played FF and this music video is just so confusing to me.

**cheatviathan** (7): A solid enough string-backed ballad with an engaging enough vocal performance, and one hell of a violin solo. Never played FFX, so context is not affecting this assessment.

# Normal laughter

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Asian mall music

**Roxieloxie** (7): not to be both balladphobic and gamerphobic [2]

**ignitethephoenix** (6.9): pretty but boring [2]

**EnCaine** (6.7): kimahri is hot. that's all

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): Very pretty, but the FF ballads have just never really done it for me, despite LIVING for the soundtracks in all other aspects

**wavingwolves** (6.2): very nice

**CrimsonROSET** (6): that violin bitch? She‚Äôs doing too much

**N454545** (6): It's fine.

**stryxen** (6): i think it‚Äôs boring towards the end but while I was engaged i enjoyed it

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i was listening to the song in another tab and i started watching the laughing video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJotVinhXJ4 and when i went back to watching the music i didnt pause the laughing so they were just laughing over very emotional parts of the game

**pig-serpent** (5): This is fine but maybe a little too long and a little too cheesy.

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): It's like they wanted to make sure I dissolved into nothingness after the ending too

**turtle\_on\_mars** (4.5): oh my mom says this was worth an 8 oops

**AHSWeeknd** (4): balladphobia

**nooodisaster** (4): I literally fell asleep halfway through listening to this sfiuksdjhfis

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): not a fan of soft rock at all sorry

**lolcevan** (3): zzz

**Qwilphish** (3): nowhere near as successful of a ballad as eyes on me

**waluigiest** (2): I apologize but I‚Äôm so bored

**nyoom** (1): did i stutter? why is this song a million years long

2RINITY: I'm kinda glad I didn't do this rate, 'cause I woulda gotten to this and complained that FFX got represented with this and not "Otherworld"--which, in my mind, is the only final boss theme in the series that can even try to contend with "One-Winged Angel"

And here comes Florence. Losing like always. Was expecting day 2 at least from all the times its been commented in Video Game Song threads and also from the Florence fans so I'm surprised to see it this low (though with an impressive amount of 10s for a day 1 song). I love the track personally despite it being a cover and I love the little touches added to make it seem more fantastical. Still, I can definitely see the criticisms of the song, especially in a rate with songs that push 'fantastical' so much further. We'll have to see if other FF tracks left can fare any better.

---

# Still waiting for that rate win

**1998tweety** (10): gorgeous song, florence really killed this.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): can‚Äôt go wrong with Florence. This is great.

**BoneStreetSand** (10): Instant tears. The song was perfect in-game and sounds perfect on its own. My queen.

**endcreditouilles** (10): i WILL cry and i WILL shed a tear thank you

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ugh i did not want to have to give florence a good score because its funny how she hasn‚Äôt won a rate yet, but this is very good

**ManofOranges** (10): Watch this make day 3 solely because of Florence

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): balladphobia bad

**shhhneak** (10): Give Florence the keys to every single Final Fantasy game.

**skargardin** (10): One of the saving graces of whatever this entry was :deadbanana:

**UltimateDomon** (10): This shit is just beautiful as hell

**celladonn** (9.5): Gorgeous, this works so much better than it should

**Chevsapher** (9): A classic song with a dynamic arrangement? A harp? Florence? Yes please.

**seanderlust** (9): if this is the one that finally wins a rate for florence....

**nt96** (8.5): Not a bad cover! I like how the prelude is quietly playing in the background.

**stryxen** (8.5): how did I not know this existed

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): This is just a decent cover by a vocalist I like, maybe it is more impactful in the game

**cheatviathan** (8): ‚ÄúStand by Me‚Äù has been covered to death, so it takes a lot of effort to make a given version stand out. This one has a stunning buildup, lavish string arrangements, and a dynamic performance from vocal powerhouse Florence Welch. I often forget that this was recorded for FFXV, and was pleasantly surprised to find it here in this rate. Great stuff.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): is this the weddingcore rate

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Florence can‚Äôt go wrong

**luckyphase** (8): a classic!

**N454545** (8): The weird echo banging sound is really distracting.

**nooodisaster** (8): Here's how Florence can still win a rate

**Parkouricus** (8): not having the context for this gives it the vibe of having walked into the movie theatre at the end of the- wait. wait movie theatres aren't real anymore. anyways god DAMN her voice

**pig-serpent** (8): Hey this is cheating! Part of me is sad that they took out the bassline but this rendition of the song is beautiful regardless.

**runaway3212** (8): Love this version

**waluigiest** (8): why was this in Final Fantasy???

**alexpiercey** (7.7): surprise covers are the best covers

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i would not have thought this would work well for florence's voice but this rly fits

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): The beginning threw me off and had me ready to write about how F+tM was not a good choice to cover this, but the second half is SUPER pretty.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): I am not a huge fan of the original, but Florence with an orchestra is hard to argue with

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I mean I love Florence's voice and the rendition is nice, but this song has been so covered to death that I can't rate this any higher

**steelstepladder** (7.5): A perfectly fine and acceptable cover

# Sean Kingston outsold

**bbfan132** (7): it‚Äôs pretty but it‚Äôs not too interesting

**RetrohTanner** (7): I'm not hating this song, I like it a lot, but I'm confused why it's in the main rate when stuff like TGIF Simlish and I'm Han Solo are relegated to the bonus?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): So the first half of the song is really beautiful and emotional, but towards the end the loudness and‚Ä¶ lack of subtlety of the orchestra kinda take me out of the magic of the song‚Ä¶ at least Florence‚Äôs vocals are perfect!

**anothertown** (6.5): this cover is really nice for the first like 2:30 mins but those last big choruses ruin it

**2dina3dworld** (6): any version of Stand by Me instantly makes me balladphobic. This was bearable, though.

**cremeebrulee** (6): welcome to the stage 9 time rate loser florence welch

**TragicKingdom1** (6): can we please stop rating this woman

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): HBHBHB spoiled me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I‚Äôm a bit confused, I thought that covers and actual songs were supposed to be in the bonus rate? Anyways not a huge fan of this, it isn‚Äôt bad but like a lot of ‚Äúedgy covers of a classic‚Äù songs created for movies/games it feels gimmicky and lacks what made the original good. In general you shouldn‚Äôt cover a really iconic song unless you‚Äôre able to do it justice and while I think Florence has it in her, she didn‚Äôt bring it out here because this is pretty wimpy. Something more epic like [Louie Zong‚Äôs flip on ‚Äú‚Ä¶Baby One More Time‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYDrmJAlz1s) would have scratched the itch I have much more

**welcome2thejam** (5): Florence is great as usual, and I especially love her voice in the climax, but it's overall just a decent cover attempt of a 10 song

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): look, i love florence, and i would love for her to finally win a rate... but with this song? A song that‚Äôs pleasant, but will get boosted from name recognition alone? No thanks. The arrangement is nice enough, and florence's vocals are obviously great, but like, it's just lacking in energy

**Alumineous** (4): I don't think I like the singer's voice. Plus, I find it interesting that they chose to cover a song rather than just make a new song. This song has been covered better by other artists and I don't see a reason to listen to this again, except when playing the game.

**EnCaine** (3.7): i like absolutely no version of this song

**akanewasright** (3): this doesn‚Äôt really work :/ Love Florence but this arrangement is not it

**astrologicalangel** (3): this is a good cover, I just don't like the song

**BebeLuigi** (3): I understand people will like it but to me it felt very uninteresting all around

**nyoom** (3): stand by yourself florence i'm going home

**rslashpoopheads** (3): sorry Florence, this ain't it

**cyborglilith** (1): I always despised this song.

**Qwilphish** (1): this is just the original song??? not even with an interesting perspective like the bayonetta tracks. of course the song is great and florence is great but cmon, this is a video game rate! not a rate for people with nice shoes

**Roxieloxie** (1): on god one day we are gonna rate a good Florence song but until then she will stay in second place (actually please kick this out day 1)

**wavingwolves** (1): this sounds like ad music one of those emotionally manipulative commercials we see a lot the during holidays

**fadedblue09** (0): An embarassing, disrespectful cover. Almost on par with Lana Del Rey covers

I feel like there've been at least 3 other comments today of me saying: "this song's a mess but I like it". And really a lot of these gaming tracks are super cheesy. Honestly my only main problem with this track is that it seems like they made the lyrics and song separately then tried to throw them together without compromise. 

Also for any future hosts planning on hosting a currated/voted grab bag, NEVER assume anything's getting in! Was expecting to see the Brawl theme alongside this one but then no one suggested it in the thread!

# Kirby Mains

**cyborglilith** (10): periodt

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I still play a lot of Ultimate and sometimes i just watch the opening again to listen to this BOP

**Roxieloxie** (10): Thank you to my friend who bought this for me so i could experience the joy of him absolutely destroying me at it

**Chevsapher** (9.2): Isn't that melody from the old series theme? What a lush arrangement! And the lyrics fit perfectly.

**nooodisaster** (9): ICONIC ALMOST CHANGED MY LIFE

**Parkouricus** (9): bear this torchic

**PhloxInvar** (9): They nailed the translation and adding vocals to what is normally an instrumental song.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): forget too many FE characters, this theme song is literally ripped straight from FE Fates

**stryxen** (9): don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever been more hyped for a game than ultimate and i still get goosebumps from this

**1998tweety** (8.5): The Brawl theme was robbed for this??????? This is good but like the other song is GODLY

**endcreditouilles** (8.5): I don't like it as much as previous SSB main themes, but it grew on me

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): Brawl main theme outsold

**2dina3dworld** (8): I bet the Rosalina main‚Äôs all bump this on the daily. Not because it has anything to do with Rosalina, it just sounds like something people who like Rosalina would like.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): surprisingly good? Like i didnt expect that from smash of all places

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I feel like this should be for any other Mario game except smash bros

**Qwilphish** (8): the brawl theme outsold but this is so high tier

**rotating3Dtext** (8): these vocals are really nice

**UltimateDomon** (8): I wonder who popheads wants for the next DLC character

**welcome2thejam** (8): Still fucks me up that the Smash theme just has lyrics now.

# Bring back Subspace!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I‚Äôve never been a huge fan of this one actually, I think the instrumental is nice but the melody sounds awkward when sung and the lyrics are packed in there uncomfortably. It sounds like one of those fan made covers of a video game theme but for some reason it‚Äôs official. That said, Nintendo put it on Spotify!

**kirby31200** (7.5): I really never cared for this as much as others do. I think the vocals just feel a little off. I would've rated the Brawl theme higher

**AHSWeeknd** (7): this is so dramatic

**bbfan132** (7): kind of forgettable but nice

**BebeLuigi** (7): I prefered the Smash Bros Brawn opening theme...

**EnCaine** (7): this is better without the vocals

**hikkaru** (7): since this is from smash im gonna take a moment to say that i fucking hate nintendo with a passion, when they had a whole segment of a direct like "u can connect ur headphones and put ur switch in sleep mode and listen to the songs in smash wherever u go!!" like BYE just put your fucking songs on streaming

**pig-serpent** (7): Pretty song: the type of song that feels like it's always existed. I seriously keep forgetting this isn't from Smash 4 or Brawl.

**teenwitches** (7): ever set a song you liked as your alarm and then slowly grew to hate it because you associate it with being violently awoken every morning? that's how i feel about this song playing at full volume every time i launch smash on my switch.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pretty epic. Though admittedly some of the English is awkward, you can tell it‚Äôs a translation

**nyoom** (6.5): (byleth.jpg) i married annette

**nt96** (6): As much as I love the Smash franchise and the different OSTs, this one didn‚Äôt really click with me.

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): It‚Äôs too wordy if that makes sense

**RetrohTanner** (6): I do like this one, but there's something about it that feels like... missed potential. I guess? Idk, I find it hard to put into words

**runaway3212** (6): a bit too long but not terrible

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I appreciate her range but she's just yelling here

**shhhneak** (5.5): Easily the worst Smash Bros theme song.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I HATE that the main theme has vocals on it because every time I boot up smash ultimate, I jump every time the game screams "COLORS WEAVE INTO A--" at me before I can prepare myself

**Awkward\_King** (5): the vocals for this aint hittin hmmmmm

**cheatviathan** (5): Here‚Äôs my worst take of the rate. This song should have stayed an instrumental, and adding vocals only detracts from it.

**ReallyCreative** (5): I love how a community as argumentative and divided as the Smash community came together and near universally agreed that this song was meh

**bigbigbee** (4.5): Cannot stand the way that this song sounds in English. Maybe it's better in Japanese or something but English wasn't meant to be sung in this meter. It feels like someone wrote a song and then was like oh, we should add lyrics to it, not like someone wrote a song with vocals in mind. It's like if I tried to give the sugar plum fairy song lyrics or something.

**LesApfels** (4): My sister overplayed the hell out of this one

**Raxxin** (3): brawl opening outsold

**TragicKingdom1** (3): her vocals kinda ruin this

**waluigiest** (2): it‚Äôs so corny, justice for the Brawl theme

**letsallpoo** (0): this song really epitomizes a problem with a lot of the songs in this rate in that the singer has a nice enough voice but she cannot emote for shit and makes this way more flaccid that it deserves to be. her delivery is the equivalent of a damp paper bag

**steelstepladder** (0): Adding lyrics to this song was such a bad idea. It did NOT need it and the Brawl theme deserved anyway

More like final flopasy am i right? Anyways I'm a little surprised how poorly the FF ballads are doing considering how many requests I seemingly had to include different ones (most are great, but I am 95% sure they'd be lumped in the same area as these three). I imagine the context for a lot of these help, but otherwise it's just regular balladphobia (although it's understandable in a gaming rate without context). Anyways I think this is gorgeous. Faye Wong does an amazing job with her singing, but the instrumentation is sparse and the track is long enough that I can see it being brought down for it.

---

**cremeebrulee** (10): wait i love this it sounds so sweet :(

**cyborglilith** (10): i cry

**plastichaxan** (10): i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve listened to a song this beautiful and epic in a long time

**Qwilphish** (10): I was prepared to be full balladphobe but I love this so much

**steelstepladder** (10): The Final Fantasy ballads are going to get so fucking robbed because they are all so fucking gorgeous

**bbfan132** (9.5): gorgeous song <3

**skargardin** (9): Just like the FF series overall, I fear this will be underrated

**Chevsapher** (8.8): How lovely. I was afraid it would get boring, but the production just kept building.

**alexpiercey** (8.6): I feel like this one would've really gotten to me if I knew the context

**1998tweety** (8.5): pretty

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): vocals were served

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): no one told me Faye Wong did English at some point. Her voice is always ridiculously pretty

**luckyphase** (8.3): it's beautiful

**anothertown** (8): it's good to have very attainable goals aka i will play a final fantasy game before i turn 30

**rslashpoopheads** (8): ugh, who let the hettest FF in here

**EnCaine** (7.7): one winged angel could have got my 11

**Parkouricus** (7.5): sadly i'm a bit too balladphobic for this.., but shit no wonder this was a hit

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This song plays during the two most ridiculous parts of the game 1) a cheesy love scene in SPACE and 2) after the nonsensical ending, but in spite of that it's still a beautiful song

**Alumineous** (7): I haven't played a Final Fantasy game in my life. So, I feel like I'm missing something. I lost interest after 3 minutes.

**BebeLuigi** (7): Very Cute!

**celladonn** (7): FFVIII isn't one of my favourites in the series but this is a pretty ballad

**CrimsonROSET** (7): how is this 6 minutes long holy shit

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I‚Äôm not a ballad person

**ignitethephoenix** (7): pretty but boring

**Roxieloxie** (7): not to be both balladphobic and gamerphobic however,,

**runaway3212** (7): A cute ballad but a bit too much for me

**UltimateDomon** (7): Cute lil ballad

**N454545** (6): It's fine.

**pig-serpent** (6): I normally hate this cheesey style of 90's ballad, but I think the setting of Final Fantasy works pretty well with the style and makes this tolerable. Good, even.

**turtle\_on\_mars** (6): too bad my mom walked in on me listening to the rate and said this was at least an 8.5

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): God the lyrics and vocals are so hokey‚Ä¶ the instrumental isn‚Äôt bad though

**wavingwolves** (6): i love you faye wong

**seanderlust** (5.5): lady yuna's 1000 words outsold

**stryxen** (5.5): My Eyes are Closing but I do really like like the woodwind solo sections and the last half is better than the first few mins

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): this song commits the heinous crime of being bland

**AHSWeeknd** (5): balladphobia

**akanewasright** (5): This is okay. Perfectly pleasant.

**cheatviathan** (5): Maybe if I had an attachment to FFVIII, this would do something for me, but I don‚Äôt and it doesn‚Äôt. It sounds like a very ‚Äò90s ballad, like some ‚ÄúMy Heart Will Go On‚Äù type shit, and I don‚Äôt mean that as a compliment.

**fadedblue09** (5): Generic 90s anime closing song teas

**nooodisaster** (5): omg 90s music was soooo boring

**bigbigbee** (4): poor final fantasy had a rough go of it this rate I think. This song is way too long and a real slog.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): i was over this by the 3 minute mark

**jayjaysortagay** (4): boring

**lolcevan** (3): zzz

**nyoom** (2): i hate BADlads. faye wong more like way wrong

Looks like the non-human vocals tracks have taken a beating. Was hoping better for this one considering it was popular enough to be voted in, but here it is heading out day 1. The song itself is fun though! It gets you up and going, through I find it a bit less memorable than some of the other Splatoon tracks. Still I think this spot was probably going to whatever Splatoon track got in regardless, which is why only one of this and Calamari Inkantation were chosen. To think, we still haven't rated the legendary Squid Sisters yet though.

---

# Booyah!

**Qwilphish** (10): stan splatoon

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i'm a squid now

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song makes me woomy all over the dancefloor

**stryxen** (10): perfectly captures the unbearable anxious intensity of splatoon but it‚Äôs so fun at the same time

**Parkouricus** (9.5): i have nothing i can add to this other than: the last minute

**wavingwolves** (9.1): FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**anothertown** (9): unproblematic bop

**BebeLuigi** (9): yes go off vocaloid squids

**N454545** (9): MARINA AND PEARL ARE MAIN POP GIRLIES

**1998tweety** (8.5): bopt

**endcreditouilles** (8.5): Marina and the Octolings

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Did anyone play *De Blob*? I have it for the Switch and this really reminds me of that, I guess this is just the vibe for games where you paint a city.

**Chevsapher** (8.1): The production and the vocals are fascinating.

**astrologicalangel** (8): I know the game only came out a few years ago, but this makes me so nostalgic

**bbfan132** (8): :puggofast800:

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i feel like i‚Äôm going insane because i can almost make out lyrics?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): this is hyperpop

**skargardin** (8): so true

**UltimateDomon** (8): Splatoon fans when they hear someone gargling piss

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I was kinda upset that nothing from the first Splatoon was on the rate but this kinda has more vocals than all of that game‚Äôs soundtrack lol

**luckyphase** (7.6): girl help i cant swim!

**AHSWeeknd** (7): This deserves the Dolby Atmos spatial audio treatment.

**RetrohTanner** (7): This is Calamari Inkantation erasure

**runaway3212** (7): you know what? spill

# Ouch!

**slimboyfriend** (7): People who like splatoon give me heavy weird gross wolf kid named Trent energy

**welcome2thejam** (7): I keep expecting In A Gadda Da Vida off the "woah-oh-oh" and it's messing me up

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i will say, ‚ÄúOctotune‚Äù is absolutely sending me as an album name

**nooodisaster** (6): more kid, less squid

**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's like Kirby music but worse

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): hmm I prefer Calamari Inkantation...

**ignitethephoenix** (5): calling this a vocal mmmkay (production bops though)

**pig-serpent** (5): I love the style of Splatoon music but the music itself is always mediocre to me. This song in particular feels like background music that doesn't sound bad but isn't supposed to elicit any reaction or emotion. The second half does have decent vocals but It's too little of interest.

**cheatviathan** (4): Any song from the Splatoon soundtrack is fighting an uphill battle to appeal to me solely because I find the vocal filters to be obnoxious, but many of them have some compelling instrumental wrinkle to keep me from turning the music off. This track is devoid of even that.

**2dina3dworld** (3): I cannot get over how the vocals in this song sound like someone gargling mouthwash

**nyoom** (3): local vocaloid drowns in kiddie pool, leaves behind mysterious ddr track. what does it mean

**waluigiest** (3): ah yes vocals

**NFLfreak98** (2.5): God the ‚Äòvocals‚Äô on this just ruin everything

**fadedblue09** (1): Gurl what, gargling doesn't count as "vocals"

**celladonn** (0): I do not care at all for the underwater vocals

Now this is an iconic song! I think if you asked anyone about what Guitar Hero song came to mind, this'd be the first to pop up! While I'm not usually the biggest fan of songs of this style, this one has enough triumph to it to make me love it. Guitar Hero might not be around anymore really, replaced with Rock Band and Rocksmith, but this song will always remind me how HUGE it was back in the day.

**steelstepladder** (10): Sometimes a song is more than a song. Sometimes a song is about what it represents, and this is forever the greatest final challenge in rhythm game history

**teenwitches** (10): if you didn't give yourself carpal tunnel trying to 100% this on expert are you really a zillennial

**UltimateDomon** (10): Dragonforce's entire discography is making the same song over and over again, but this is the best version of that song

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): if I had a vibrator as fast as this drummer I'd never leave my apt

**bigbigbee** (9): I don't enjoy the long instrumental bridge but this song is just SO iconic. Inspired a generation of guitar hero kids who wanted to be in a rock band (hey that's the name of a game). I LOVE the chorus melody. This gets me hype as fuck.

**celladonn** (9): This song's title is so dumb, like aren't fire and flames the same thing? Anyway this melted my face off

**cheatviathan** (9): I have heard this song repeatedly for over a decade, and I still haven‚Äôt tired of it. Guitar Hero III was the peak of the franchise, and this was the perfect end credits song with blistering solo after blistering solo. My taste in metal would get more sludgy and cerebral over time, but there‚Äôs still room in my heart for a song like this occasionally.

**ManofOranges** (9): Great but DAMN is it long.

**seanderlust** (9): oh weird, this version is missing the "clunk" sound effect that comes when you miss a note on GH and me muttering "fuck, goddamnit" under my breath

**Chevsapher** (8.6): What a cool song. The vocals sit too far back in the mix, unfortunately.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is the greatest boss of all time

**Parkouricus** (8.5): heard this a couple too many times from clone hero videos! this is gonna make for the absolute most hilarious intermission though LOL

**BoneStreetSand** (8.2): Hype song.

**EnCaine** (8): beating this on expert mode for the first time is infinitely better than any sex

**luckyphase** (8): I need a babymetal cover

**nt96** (8): The song that gave every kid arthritis.

**skargardin** (8): maybe power metal did make some points

**slimboyfriend** (8): ok but this song.... is camp

# Easy mode

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the way this song always manages to sound like its on 2x speed at the first riff

**shhhneak** (7): I remember when beating this level used to be a personality trait.

**plastichaxan** (6): ummm this is so long and for what it was fine the first minutes

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): we aren‚Äôt ready to discuss the major cultural impact that Guitar Hero had

**welcome2thejam** (5): F in chat for this dude's fingers

**AHSWeeknd** (4): I never liked this tbh.

**bbfan132** (4): i sleep

**sarcasticsobs** (4): cheesy but not cheesy enough to be fun

**TragicKingdom1** (3): im gay

**nyoom** (2.5): this song does indeed make me feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days, as it is approximately a thousand days long

And there goes the first of the Supergiant tracks! Picking up two on both the 11 and 0 side too! While I love the song outside of context, it works so well in game too >!Seeing the icon for Eurydice's room and then being granted a moment of respite with some bonuses is a gaming moment I'll never forget!< Honestly a little sad to see it go this early

---

# Hot people

**turtle\_on\_mars** (11): my GOTY and my 11 <3 now on xbox and ps!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): everyone in this game is so hot

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I should really play Hades‚Ä¶ this song grabbed my attention while my boyfriend was playing it, it absolutely stands on its own and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs even more impactful in context

**steelstepladder** (10): That next three boons have higher rarity porridge really hits differently

**UltimateDomon** (10): Not to be hyperbolic but this is probably the greatest song ever written

**waluigiest** (10): I‚Äôm biased because this is one of the few games in this rate I‚Äôve played, but I think this is such a beautiful song. It‚Äôs period savvy and the harmonies are so gorgeous. I‚Äôm in love with their story and how the game spins it

**PhloxInvar** (9.8): The vocals are jawdropping. Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett are the god and goddess of music in Hades, and it shows. The best part is the very deliberate twangs of the strings as the fingers placements change.

**nyoom** (9.5): hell YEAH solo duality this one doesn't hit quite as hard for me as Setting Sail, Coming Home because the Eurydice solo kind of drowns out Orpheus' so it sounds like he's just backing vocals to her song, but that's cool in itself, like his voice is shadowing hers in an inversion of their myth.

**cheatviathan** (9): Okay. You have done a better job convincing me to pick this one up than any amount of critical acclaim could have. A simple guitar lead and some gorgeous harmonies are enough to floor me in the right circumstances.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I really like Ashley‚Äôs voice and how Supergaint uses her in their games.

**luckyphase** (9): I don't think I'll ever listen to this again though

**Raxxin** (9): you guys did good picking the best hades vocal track

**seanderlust** (9): "no contracts, i'm free to do as I please" (late season drag race contestants have left the chat)

**EnCaine** (8.8): stunning

**Chevsapher** (8.6): Simple, but solid. I like how the voices sit on different sides of the mix.

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is nice. Zagreus can ruin this hole

**bbfan132** (8.5): very pleasant/relaxing

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): haven‚Äôt played this game yet but I feel like it‚Äôs a good closer to the game

**BoneStreetSand** (8.2): Almost made me buy the game.

**akanewasright** (8): I feel like I‚Äôll cry at this if I ever get around to playing hades

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this was cute! The voices compliment themselves very well.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): The in-game visuals elevate this.

**nooodisaster** (8): Beautiful duet with very somber vibes

**Parkouricus** (8): hades deserved the game awards and i'm still upset.

**pig-serpent** (8): This song really caught my attention the first time I entered Eurydice's chamber, and honestly I vastly prefer her solo version to the duet.

**ReallyCreative** (8): Me to the Sonic songs in this rate

**Roxieloxie** (8): Another turning point a fork stuck in the the road time grabs you by the wrist directs you where to go so make the best of this test and dont ask why its not a question but a lesson learned in time its something unpredictable but in the end its right, i hope you had the time of your life

**stryxen** (8): scratching some sufjan itch

# Stuck in Tartarus

**celladonn** (7.5): I'm not the biggest fan of the higher register Darren sings in as Orpheus

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I sometimes enjoy ‚Äúsoft strings indie duos‚Äù but generally I need them to either have some energy or be so emotionally investing that I appreciate their silence‚Ä¶ this is just in the middle of that. These Supergiant songs aren‚Äôt bad but I‚Äôm starting to get the sense that they‚Äôre only *really good* if you‚Äôve played the games and thus have an emotional attachment to them. Like this is very much a song that‚Äôs supposed to sound pretty in the background as you talk with your friends about what you just witnessed.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its fine but this guy in the video game is kinda hot tho

**skargardin** (7): The song is good but needed that little extra something for me to score it higher. Obviously this is wonderful though in the context of Hades' story.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is actually my least favorite of the songs from Hades‚Ä¶ oop. But it‚Äôs still really pretty, and Darren and Ashley know how to HARMONIZE!

**BebeLuigi** (6): The guitar (or whatever the string instrument is) is almost hypnoctic in the track for sure! definitely set the mood, the song by itself doesn't interest me much otherwise sdfsdfs

**N454545** (6): I had enough of that guy's falsetto. Sorry.

**Alumineous** (5): But when will Supergiant say goodbye to Ashley Barrett? That's the real question.

**astrologicalangel** (5): I prefer the Green Day one

**ManofOranges** (5): I hope you had the time of your life

**pietrohonkhonk** (5): Boring, this sounds like an interlude but it's almost 3 minutes

**runaway3212** (5): a bit too moody for me

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): me when this song goes out

**wavingwolves** (5): ''good riddance'? more like me when this goes out jk i don't really have any thoughts about this just wanted to make a joke

**fadedblue09** (4): I normally defend intimate folky songs like these, but god, there is like 0 chemistry between the vocalists.

**slimboyfriend** (4): I really wanted to like this song because the protagonist is really hot :/

**AHSWeeknd** (2): needs better production

**Qwilphish** (2): I love this game so so so so much, but the singing tracks are definitely not the reason why

**rslashpoopheads** (2): good riddance to this song

**anothertown** (0): me when this goes

**Awkward\_King** (0): i think i hate this?? i cant work out if i hate this or im just having a really weirdly negative reaction to it but either way this is not pleasing to my ears no no no not for me

One of the "gibberish" tracks in the rate, but I think this one does it the best. The swells in the song are gorgeous and even though I have pretty much no context from the game, I still love the track. This one toed the line between late day 3 / early day 2 for a bit, but unfortunately it fell short with the final ballots.

---

# Lyrical masterpiece

**fadedblue09** (11): Never thought I'd be giving my 11 to a song sung in an artificial language from a game I've never played, but here we are. I love the solemn piano playing, and the vocals are so gorgeous even if it's gibberish. I might be throwing my 11 here, but the fact I was able to resonate with this song despite no prior knowledge or context is enough reason to give it an 11.

**Parkouricus** (10): oh no this is breathtaking, i need to play these games and cry now?? OH MY GOD WAIT I LOOKED IT UP AND THIS SONG IS GAY TOO?? OW FUCK MY TEARDUCTS

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is the most beautiful and moving gibberish i've ever heard in my life

**skargardin** (10): I just think that heavenly, melancholic piano ballads in JRPGs hit different

**UltimateDomon** (10): Keiichi Okabe and Emi Evans also both own my ass

**nyoom** (9.5): this nierly brings me to tears and i kaine not explain why

**1998tweety** (9): this is beautiful

**Chevsapher** (8.9): This is beautiful. I wish the production switched up a bit, but that's a minor complaint.

**bbfan132** (8.5): this was super pretty!

**BebeLuigi** (8): A bit bummed Shadowlord isn't here but still love this a lot! Kain√© deserves the world

**cheatviathan** (8): I don‚Äôt know what the hell that language is, but I know an emotive vocal performance when I hear one, and this is most certainly that.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this sounds like the opening to a fantasy movie, with like the queen in the piano as we get to see her kingdom

**lolcevan** (8): i dont know what the fuck she‚Äôs saying but girl i‚Äôm living

**steelstepladder** (8): Wish it was the version with the sweeping ending

**seanderlust** (7.8): it takes talent to convey an emotion so clearly in a song in a made-up language. i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i'm solemn. that said, I don't see myself returning to this at all

**wavingwolves** (7.8): pretty

# Genius lyrics interview when

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Why was I waiting for this to turn into a bop like Donna Summer‚Äôs Last Dance

**akanewasright** (7): nice, short, and sweet

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Balladphobia strikes again.

**LesApfels** (7): I don‚Äôt know what the fuck she‚Äôs saying but girl I am living

**Roxieloxie** (7): i feel like i would like this more if i played the game it was for

**runaway3212** (7): a bit too out there for me, but definitly not bad

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Well it‚Äôs a pretty song. But fake languages make me cringe lol

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): I was originally going to give this song a lower score, but I realised half-way through that I was bopping to it so I decided to raise it

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): took me way too long to realize this wasn‚Äôt English, which is a shame because I think a song like this *needs* lyrics in order to work

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it's pretty but the singer's voice is not strong enough for this song

**stryxen** (6.5): these sure are video game vocals

**nooodisaster** (6): Okay

**RetrohTanner** (6): The random little irish words sprinkled in throughout this song lol

**anothertown** (5): this is boring but i like handbells

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i thought this was in simlish at first

**slimboyfriend** (5): Sounds like a cross between Simlish and Gaelic

**ignitethephoenix** (4): zzzz

**Qwilphish** (4): is this bjork

**rslashpoopheads** (4): noah fence but I hate the sound of this language

And with that we're finally at the 7 average mark! I loved this song since the moment it showed up in the pre-rate Beatsense. And was glad it got into the voting too! But unforunately it's falling slightly before day 2. Plenty of comparisons to Rihanna have been given, but even on its own I think its a slick track that wouldn't sound out of place in the glitchy (literally), cyberpunk environment created for the game (though I'd love to see what a cyberpunkified Cirque Du Soliel would even be)

# Keanu stans

**2dina3dworld** (10): imagine bopping to this in a club‚Ä¶ oh wait, we‚Äôre in the middle of a panorama

**AHSWeeknd** (10): you can‚Äôt go wrong with the Cyberpunk soundtrack

**cremeebrulee** (10): there‚Äôs only two types of people in the world: those who give this the score it deserves and /u/ElizabethDDOS

**LesApfels** (10): It's simply an incredible pop song. Definitely deserved more than getting buried in one of Cyberpunk's radio stations

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is the closest we‚Äôre gonna get to R9

**rslashpoopheads** (10): maybe we should just let JZVEL make R8

**runaway3212** (10): This is such a banger

**seanderlust** (10): outside of the context of a video game, this would be a Billboard #1 contender for sure

**wavingwolves** (10): me rn

**akanewasright** (9): This sounds like it was cut from Rihanna‚Äôs Rated R, and that‚Äôs a massive compliment

**Alumineous** (9): This has "royalty-free song you play during a Twitch intermission break" vibes all over it.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): big K/DA energy imo, plus that productions sounds clean. gj cyberpunk

**nooodisaster** (9): Just a really good modern pop song

**Qwilphish** (9): im in the club and im living, but its a little too clean and polished to truly enjoy

**shhhneak** (8.8): You bet I‚Äôm sl*t dropping to this. Sounds like Rihanna has an Ashley O alter ego.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this would go the fuck off in a club

**luckyphase** (8.5): rihanna vibes

**Parkouricus** (8.5): WHY IS THIS SO SHORT? WHY IS THIS SO SHORT. I'M UPSET

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this slaps but also sounds like a budget Rihanna song

**kirby31200** (8): I think this implies the existence of futuristic cyberpunk Cirque De Soleil which intrigues and frightens me

**ManofOranges** (8): I really dig the title

**N454545** (8): I Can't Believe It's Not Rihanna

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): RIHANNA???

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.8): omg Rihanna?

**NFLfreak98** (7.5): If Rihanna made the Tron soundtrack

**stryxen** (7.5): cirque du slay



# **aÃµÃøÕçÃπÃüÃØÕéÃ¢lÃ¥Õ†ÃëÃÇÃÅÃ∞ÕöÃ°kÃ∑ÕíÃÄÃûfÃ∂ÕóÃΩÃ£Ã©ÃódÃ∏ÕÜÃéÃìÃäÕéÕöÕáÃòsÃ∂ÃÉÕÅÕíÃûÃ†dÃ∏ÃÑÕÜÃªgÃ∏ÃÄÃâÃÄÕâÃ§Ã®Ãº,Ã¥ÃâÕ†ÃØÃ´ÃòsÃµÃÅÕÑÃìÕóÃìÃâÃüÃ©Ã£ÃºlÃ¥ÃÅÃçÕ†Ã∞aÃµÕ†ÃíÃáÃíÕöÕÖÃπsÃµÕãÃîÃ†dÃµÃöÃåÃÜÃöÕíÃîÃ®ÃôÃúÃºÃôÃ¨fÃ∏ÃçÃÑÃíÃîÕùÕåÃúÃ©Ã†**

**Chevsapher** (7.4): This track has so much potential, but the production in the chorus feels muddled and chaotic. Sorry, but Britney did it better.

**bbfan132** (7): this kind of bopped

**bigbigbee** (7): Kind of just a mid pop song

**cheatviathan** (7): I only have two things to say about this track. 1) This gives me vague Rihanna vibes on top of some suitably modern production. 2) Crunch is a failure of the management, not a triumph of the workforce.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): why didn‚Äôt they just call this cirque du soleil

**ReallyCreative** (7): the vocals save this from being really annoying, and turn it into almost being iconic

**UltimateDomon** (7): I can't believe its not Rihanna!

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Sounds something K/DA would sing, but the random noisy electro-strings take me out

**nyoom** (6.5): not rihanna's best

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I see Rihanna finally decided to release new music in 2077 but it's an outtake from Unapologetic

**1998tweety** (6): this bops but it sounds kinda generic tbh

**anothertown** (6): penis slider

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): So you‚Äôre telling me that in 56 years we STILL won‚Äôt have new Rihanna music? That really is dystopian. Anyways it‚Äôs funny that this game takes place in the future because this song sounds like it came out 15 years ago in a bad way.

**Roxieloxie** (6): is this that game that kept getting delayed and then when it did it was just fucked up a bunch

**Awkward\_King** (5): so this... this isnt rihanna huh?

**celladonn** (5): I'm a big Cyberpunk 2077 defender but this song is just ok

**rotating3Dtext** (5): the cirque du soleil still exists in 2077?

**skargardin** (5): I am pretty neutral on this, which is not what can be said of Cyberpunk in general i fear

**welcome2thejam** (5): Is... is this just an ad for Cirque Du Soleil?

**BebeLuigi** (4): quite boring...

**pig-serpent** (4): I haven't played the game, but I've heard people complain that the game feels like Cyberpunk from the ruling class point of view instead of from the street rat point of view. Seeing as this song sounds like an average EDM/Pop hybrid from 2015 instead of incoperating the usual cyberpunk genres like synthwave or idm, I have a feeling that these complaints are accurate.

**steelstepladder** (3.7): People must really be starved for new Rihanna if they think this one of the best songs in the rate

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): The multiple layers of pastiche are fitting for the game, I guess.

**EnCaine** (3): i just do not like music like this

**brenda\_official** (1): i feel like cirque du soleil will be a pretty obscure reference by 2077

This was solidly in day 2 for most of the ballots until the very last few and I'm honestly a little sad to see it not make it there. Sure Skrillex's drop on this is a mess, but Utada sounds stunning here. That ending verse is immaculate and alone solidly scored it a 10 from me.

# Chessmasters

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Kingdom Hearts snapped.

**BebeLuigi** (10): I know a lot of fans weren't happy with the weird dubstep turn they took for this one but I enjoy it a lot!

**cyborglilith** (10): stan Utada

**Marshynarsh** (10): I didn't think this would live up to the nostalgia love I had for the first song but it is so good!

**Parkouricus** (10): i honestly adore the fact this is so different from all the others. i mean, it's been thirteen years, it's only fair!! AND IT'S AMAZING TOO

**PhloxInvar** (10): Hikaru Utada‚Äôs the biggest grower of this rate. All their songs sounded bland until I actually started to actually understand and appreciate their songs.

**Qwilphish** (10): their vocals on this production are chefs kiss

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**seanderlust** (10): the album art for this kills me. keyblade master utada hikaru. let's see xehanort try and take THEM down. they're too powerful

**shhhneak** (10): Undoubtedly disappointing after waiting so long for the sequel to drop. In my head Third Eye by Florence + The Machine is KHIII‚Äôs theme song but I‚Äôm not going to be the one to disrespect Utada Hikaru.

**akanewasright** (9.9): This just bops. Nothing more to it. It‚Äôs not as good as her other two, but I like it quite a bit

**alexpiercey** (9.9): HELL YEAH

**BoneStreetSand** (9.8): Major grower for me. Utada Hikaru never misses, do they?

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): sorry i am kind of a wh*re for skrillex production

**Alumineous** (9): I'm mixed on Skrillex, but Utada's vocal performance is much improved so there's that.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): Skrillex was in his BAG on this one

**skargardin** (9): This is by far my least favorite of Utada's KH theme songs but it's no less of a major bop for that. But see when you're being compared with perfection..

**Chevsapher** (8.9): Utada and Skrillex? Yes please. That drop is immaculate, and the songwriting is just as good as expected.

**2dina3dworld** (8): the drop really does bang

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This sans Skrillex would have worked on Eurovision.

**nooodisaster** (8): A slightly dated Skrillex drop, but really catchy overall

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): the drop is not what i wished it was

**UltimateDomon** (8): Not as good as Don't Think Twice but a lot better than I expected

**astrologicalangel** (7.8): why does this sound like a Chainsmokers song though?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I like this but also at the same time the breakdown kind of annoys me?

**steelstepladder** (7.8): Not bad but the weakest Kingdom Hearts song

**1998tweety** (7): the weakest of the 3 but shes still a bop

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I like the moment at like 1:50 a lot but not the end (?) influences in the song

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): hey guys, call me crazy but I think she wants to face her fears

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the kingdom hearts songs kinda got worse as they kept going

**ManofOranges** (7): A very generic drop but I still like it for some reason

# Prefers checkers

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The speed up into the drop is cool but the drop itself is annoying.

**bbfan132** (6): boring compared to the other two songs but not bad

**kirby31200** (6): Dated in a way the other themes aren't.

**RetrohTanner** (6): As far as Utada Hikaru collabs with legendary EDM producers go, I prefer One Last Kiss

**runaway3212** (6): messy

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): The verses and Hikaru's vocals and lyrics are great... but that drop is one of the cheapest, laziest, ugliest drops i've heard in my life. It sounds like any soundcloud dubstep remix from 2010, it's just nasty

**stryxen** (5.5): I don‚Äôt dislike it but what is happening

**anothertown** (5): I'm going to use this space to link "Blow My Whistle" - Utada & Foxy Brown from the Rush Hour 2 soundtrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4S9lKSfYHI

**cheatviathan** (5): Utada Hikaru‚Äôs vocals are dynamite as usual, but Skrillex‚Äôs production just tanks the entire song for me. It was a weird curiosity for the one week it was on the Hot 100, but nothing I gravitate towards. Maybe if I had any investment in the Kingdom Hearts franchise, this would hit different.

**EnCaine** (5): she has done so much better than this

**slimboyfriend** (5): Simple and clean and Sanctuary are basically 10s, but this sounded so dated the second I heard it in the KH3 opening sequence and doesn't match the vibe at ALL.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): EDM done wrong

**fadedblue09** (4.5): I love KH but someone needs to go home first lol. Piano intro was divine though

**nyoom** (4.5): face my jeers

**lolcevan** (4): there‚Äôs no way this song didn‚Äôt crawl out of 2013

**pietrohonkhonk** (4): They really gave us two amazing songs and then a basic EDM track huh

**wavingwolves** (3.2): the verses are good, the pre chorus is fine but the drop is horrid </3

**Raxxin** (3): eh

**waluigiest** (3): I bet y‚Äôall are gonna love this

**ReallyCreative** (2): the production definitely called me a slur

**welcome2thejam** (2): Boy, the voice is nice, but the EDM sound just is not working for me on this

**CrimsonROSET** (0): this sounds like half minecraft youtubers intro, half song that got passed down like fourteen times before being sung by julia michaels on a movie soundtrack

For all the fans of this song, I'm surprised it spent so long stuck in day 1. Basically only clawing its way out at the very end of the ballots before falling back to be the last one out today. Since K/DA didn't flop today I guess somone needed to pick up the slack. Anyways for the song, it's a full bop! There's a chaotic energy that works even though I know basically nothing about league.

# Jinx mains

**Awkward\_King** (11): this song .,,,, this song man

**1998tweety** (10): big bop, I remember this came out a little after I started playing and WHEW what a cultural reset it was.

**akanewasright** (10): This FUCKS. Like this is hard enough to demolish a city. Deserves day 3

**bigbigbee** (10): I like this even more than KDA (guitars!). I wish the character's design was a little more feral, though - I think the roughness of this song doesn't jive with her polished image (I heard this before I ever saw the champion.) That's no dig at the song though, which is IMO really fantastic.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Birthed K/DA.

**PhloxInvar** (10): LOL‚Äôs first big break. Definitely a Harley Quinn inspired character but honestly, it‚Äôs so well executed and her song is so well done. There‚Äôs just so much attitude and personality in the song, that it‚Äôs hard to mad at it. The lyrics are also really fun and easy to remember. This song is just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fun!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love this song, but every since i saw someone say Jinx's look doesn't match the vibe of the song, i can't get that out of my head for some reason

**ReallyCreative** (10): "I'm not like other girls" but you actually aren't like other girls

**runaway3212** (10): HUGE BOP

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i dont even play this game but... wig

**wavingwolves** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**BebeLuigi** (9): I was in my peak lol phase when this was release and it made me so hype back then, I can't believe it's been 8 years already

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I just think this song is a lot of fun

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is a bop but can I just take this space to say that while the animation for the tv show that League is making looks good I don‚Äôt like that they chose to focus on Piltover? It‚Äôs *such* a boring setting, like, the Jinx/Vi/Caitlyn thing is fun but once you get past that there‚Äôs nothing going on there. I feel like League misunderstands what people like about their IP, they should have done an anthology show with different episodes focusing on different champions or something so they could cater to a larger crowd instead of putting all their eggs into the ‚ÄúJinx is my waifu‚Äù basket.

**stryxen** (9): good for her

**endcreditouilles** (8.7): suddenly i want to blow up the sun

**Parkouricus** (8.5): i do not endorse league of legends. but i do appreciate league of legends doing the absolute most ridiculous shit because they have such a large budget

**EnCaine** (8.2): this is better than basically every song on that k/da ep

**cremeebrulee** (8): why does this sound like it could be on the birds of prey ost

**CrimsonROSET** (8): insert here a really funny joke about league

**ImADudeDuh** (8): tf does nagl mean? Need a Good Love? Cause tea üòîüòî

**kirby31200** (8): Hardly Quinn

**skargardin** (8): Thought of tanking this because of my jinx hatred :grinny:

**steelstepladder** (8): A bop!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Wow. What a banger lol

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): I really thought "such pathetic neatness" was actually NEETness and making fun of league players or something, that's the reality I accept

# Got jinxed

**cyborglilith** (7.4): im sett's cumdump

**2dina3dworld** (7.3): this would be good as background music to use as hype, but listening through my headphones at full blast gave me audio motion sickness.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the voice actually works with the beat and makes this good

**nooodisaster** (7): The music video outsold the song I fear

**welcome2thejam** (7): Nice to see a straight-up Villain Song in this rate

**Chevsapher** (6.9): This is giving me Ava Max energy, and not in a good way.

**Qwilphish** (6.5): sounds like 3 songs mashed into one with no regard to cuts or transitions. the individual parts are fun though

**UltimateDomon** (6.5): Jinx is very cute

**cheatviathan** (6): I‚Äôm not sure if I enjoy this song, or am merely fascinated by it. The vocals are certainly raspy and theatrical, the lyrics are trying to paint this edgy image that I can‚Äôt take seriously, and the instrumental is this odd blend of revving synths and pop punk guitars. These disparate aesthetics don‚Äôt meld together smoothly or clash in a horrendous fashion. It doesn‚Äôt feel like the song is on the verge of collapsing in on itself for its entire runtime the way a masterpiece like ‚ÄúUntouched‚Äù does, even though instability is what it‚Äôs going for.

**pig-serpent** (6): I like angry female vocals, especially with the good hook, but the song itself feels almost haphazard. Like they were trying to make a song in a certain style and didn't care about how good it sounds.

**Alumineous** (4): The music video is cool.

**bbfan132** (4): not into it at all rip

**LesApfels** (4): Never understood why people are so obsessed with Jinx

**nyoom** (4): mmm yeah no i'll take the bullet to the face thanks roses are red, violets are blue, is there anything worse than a song that rhymes, but only sometimes?

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Sounds like K/DA when they're electrocuted

**pietrohonkhonk** (3): This is awful

**rslashpoopheads** (2): um hehe
