So here we are... with my 11 being the first cut of the final day. I'm glad it made it this far as it was toeing the line of day 2 for a while before finally landing in day 3. I I love this song alone, but Transistor is one of my favourite games of all time so that probably only elevates it. Ashley's vocals are STUNNING here and though the instrumentation is pretty held back for most of the song it peaks at the perfect time. What I love about Transistor is that it evokes the perfect mix of gameplay, art, and music and the soundtrack plays a major part in that relationship. So yeah, bummed it's not getting further but I'm so glad that it made day 3 at the very least.

Also here's an amazing alternate banner from u /ElizabethDDOS [(WARNING SPOILERS ONLY CLICK IF YOU'VE PLAYED THE GAME)](https://i.imgur.com/QKjpBhG.png)

# Paper

**PhloxInvar** (11): Transistor has the most amazing songs. Paper Boats is but one of six amazing vocal tracks on the game, and I think this one is the most emotional ballad out of all the ballads in this rate. It’s not quite drum and bass, but not orchestral or piano like all the other ones are. It’s driven by guitar, bass, great percussion and most importantly, Ashley Barrett’s majestic voice. Even the brief male back-up vocal in the first verse gives it such a unique edge. The greatest thing is realizing that his voice also supports starting the second chorus, ever so slightly. There’s just this underlying feeling of drift that is uniquely conveyed in this song that I can’t get enough of. It’s also super fun to sing.

**Raxxin** (11): red is THAT bitch. main pop girl of the videogame world

**1998tweety** (10): gorgeous

**Brendon-Urine** (10): that vocal line on "you can run but you can't hide" is S T U N N I N G

**celladonn** (10): Perfect song

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): This song is so good on its own and so wonderful and bittersweet in the context of the game

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): >!no don't kill yourself you're so sexy haha!<

**endcreditouilles** (10): Ashley's voice in this one is heartbreakingly good

**plastichaxan** (10): this kept getting better and better

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i adore how this is so distinct in Darren Korb's discography, it's truly a standout track in an already perfect OST.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): my favorite new discovery of this rate

**seanderlust** (10): I am in love with how the chorus sounds on this one

**skargardin** (10): I'm not crying you're-

**stryxen** (10): YES SING omg this is so good

**cheatviathan** (9): The line “We are magnets pulling from different poles” hits differently than most magnet-related lines in songs do. That, alongside great vocals from Ashley Barrett, and a moody, reverby instrumental is enough for me to love it.

**ReallyCreative** (9): this is lowkey an Ashley Barrett rate isn't it, her voice is SUPER suited for this kind of sound though

**runaway3212** (9): you can hide lil bitch - this song

**Chevsapher** (8.3): The hints of dark, brooding 90s rock give the track an edge, and the chord progressions keep it interesting.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): honestly get that check ashley

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This feels old school for some reason, and by old school I mean like ‘00s. That’s a compliment though.

**pig-serpent** (8): Is this trip hop? It's a cool song.

**steelstepladder** (8): Supergiant games have such good soundtracks

**UltimateDomon** (8): Supergiant simply cannot miss with their soundtracks

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Ashley is such a pretty singer

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): there’s a quality to the singers voice that really elevates this song

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Low key wholesome vibes

# Scissors

**bbfan132** (6.5): a song

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Struggling to find anything to say about this but the female singer sounds like Christina Perri

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (6.5): love the vocals and the verses are so good but that chorus...woof. art house banana heartbreak

**ImADudeDuh** (6): aint that a fiona apple song title?

**wavingwolves** (6): pretty

**BebeLuigi** (5): Quite forgettable

**letsallpoo** (5): she wants to be alanis morissette so bad it hurts

**AHSWeeknd** (4): balladphobia

**Qwilphish** (4): doesnt really do anything for me here

I have yet to play TWEWY actually, but it's probably at the top of my list in part due to the glowing praise and passionate fanbase the game has. Calling has such a smooth vocal performance and amazing instrumentals that it makes the perfect music to jam to. It spent a lot of time in late day 2, but I'm glad it could sneak into day 3 at least.

Twister was an alternate option (in fact I think it was the TWEWY rep the first 3 or 4 times I sent this rate) but it got switched out a little bit ago from someone's recommendation. Maybe VGV2 can get on that

# Play Wake Up by Hilary Duff

**akanewasright** (10): GOD what a fun instrumental

**BebeLuigi** (10): Love it it's just so addictive

**nooodisaster** (10): I played this game for hours but was stuck in the opening area the entire time so basically I just listened to this song on loop.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (10): massively biased because every twewy track is an auto 10 for me (but honestly i consider this one of the weakest tracks in the game)

**Parkouricus** (10): i watched a let's play of this game and this song is like the only thing i remember..... which might be good because i should actually play it instead

**ReallyCreative** (10): Rachel from the dealership regarding my vehicle's extended warranty

**stryxen** (10): favourite discovery!

**1998tweety** (9.5): an absolute serve

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): See the thing about some songs created specifically for commercial properties is despite the faint smell of plastic there’s just this undeniable *style* about them. Sure it’s all fake but being so fake is the only thing that frees people to create slick polished bops like this.

**bbfan132** (8.5): :velmaserve:

**luckyphase** (8.5): i love this game 🗣

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): a real smash, a real killer

**Chevsapher** (8.3): The simple hook works surprisingly well, and the little touches in the production keep it interesting.

**bigbigbee** (8): The vocal melody on this lets it down because that instrumental is incredible. Still really good though.

**cheatviathan** (8): This is one of my favorite discoveries of the rate. Lyrically, there’s nothing to gravitate to, but goddamn does that groove make me want to bob my head back and forth.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me to the people sleeping on this rate

**pig-serpent** (8): Solid Beat.

**Raxxin** (8): i will literally never forgive you guys for adding this song instead of one of the many iconic battle themes

**runaway3212** (8): Doesnt has as much energy as the first 10 seconds promise but still pretty good

**skargardin** (8): banger!!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): Square Enix really loved putting some jpop/electropop tracks in their early 2000's titles huh

**Qwilphish** (7.5): I love the vibes but nothing in particular is pulling me in

**AHSWeeknd** (7): such a fun bop

**celladonn** (7): This game was THAT bitch for me in 2008. I also want to shout out the end credits song Lullaby For You, which may or may not have made me cry back then

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Good but not great

# Play Wake Up system alarm

**TragicKingdom1** (6): this could be a 00s kylie song

**UltimateDomon** (6): It's alright

**fadedblue09** (4): A song telling me to wake up yet all I do is fall asleep

**ImADudeDuh** (4): it was meh

**PhloxInvar** (4): CALLLLIIIING.

Cruising Together is a fun track, but I don't know if I can say much more than that. I didn't expect it to get this far, but it seems to have gotten quite a lot of love! The vocals here are good, but I think the instrumentation really makes the song for me. And the calling in the back ground is amazing too. Though I gave it around a 7, I'm not too mad it made it this far - it's still a great song!


---

# Dream delight

**Alumineous** (11): This song makes me so happy. You can't help but dance, even when sitting down. Plus, I love the strings and woodwinds in the background, and the person that yells... something throughout the song is iconic. Just everything about it is just perfect. And thanks SEGA for putting it on Spotify!

**Parkouricus** (11): I can't really justify this but this song, this game, deserves the HELL out of this even if this is largely a nostalgia vote!! I was stunned it even got into this rate with how fierce the competition is, and even if it's most likely gonna get robbed that really doesn't matter. Even though this song (which is an arrangement of Dreams Dreams, which has the same lyrics) is ultimately very childlike, that's kind of what makes it so affecting and almost like a dream fittingly enough!! The same can largely be said for the game, too! ALSO: NiGHTS IS OUR AGENDER LORD. THEY ARE PERFECT!! Also also, this song gives me the strength to avoid all the videos about how bad Balan WonderWorld is and that's an incredible power

**agentofscranton** (10): holy shit????

**akanewasright** (10): maybe I need to play these games. This was an easy 10 and a massive breath of fresh air

**BebeLuigi** (10): Yesssss so happy it's here, it's one of my favourite video game music, that flute and that violin mixed with that funky vibe hits hard

**bigbigbee** (10): So unique! I can't name another song that sounds like this. This REALLY hit for me on first listen, and it's only grown on me since then.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I submitted this to the fan vote and I’m sooo glad it got picked because it’s a massive bop, there’s a very specific tone to this song that I don’t feel like we see enough: it’s dreamy, inspirational, and sentimental (in a non-romantic way) all at once while feeling playful rather than cloying. In the actual game this plays while you’re flying above a brilliant city of lights as fireworks go off around you and it’s suuuuch cool imagery. Lizzo should cover this.

**Qwilphish** (10): wow what a sleeper hit from nowhere. thanks for showing me this song!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i've never played NiGHTS but this song makes me want to, it sounds so magical and lively and perfect

**runaway3212** (10): this is a perfect song

**seanderlust** (10): this would feel right at home on a dancefloor in the late 70s

**PhloxInvar** (9.5): Better than any Sonic song. There’s so many small details and different instruments in each part, and so much happiness to the song. I still have no idea what the fuck she’s yelling, but in the spirit of the song let us yell, “aromaaaaaAAAAAAAA!”

**1998tweety** (9): massive bop, i will not forgive y'all for doing this dirty

**AHSWeeknd** (9): an oddly chaotic intro in this one

**anothertown** (9): no this is camp.

**bbfan132** (9): bopping to this

**nt96** (9): A perfect dancing into the starry night vibe.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (9): the strings are so happy and the joyful yelling really works for me :') feels like leaping over rooftops at night knowing no one can catch you

**ReallyCreative** (9): throwing ass right now

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): me and my grindr hookup in the car

**Chevsapher** (8.9): It's impossible to dislike the swirling disco strings or that sneaky Stardust sample.

**astrologicalangel** (8.5): I have never heard of this game in my life, but this song makes a good case for it

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Ugh a slut drop anthem tbh

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): D I S C O

**plastichaxan** (8.5): there’s an easy gay joke to make here but i’ll let someone else do it

**cheatviathan** (8): This sounds like if someone tried to adapt Stardust’s “Music Sounds Better with You” to fit a fairy tale that takes place in medieval times or something. If you’ve ever heard me talk about “Music Sounds Better with You”, you’d know that’s a high compliment. The string arrangements and pan flute solos do a great job keeping me engaged.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): come on, pan flute!

**skargardin** (8): recorder (as in the instrument) antis do not interact

**steelstepladder** (8): OMG I love Balan Wonderworld!

**UltimateDomon** (8): This is a really fun one

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): we love a mild disco influence

**LesApfels** (7.5): The NiGHTS soundtracks always snap wbk

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I'm just vibing

**stryxen** (7.5): why did i think the intro was jealousy by róisín murphy

**ImADudeDuh** (7): gay anthem?

**pig-serpent** (7): Feel good vibe song

**welcome2thejam** (7): Love getting put into a peaceful state by the soft outro of Weight of the World, and then getting legitimately fucking jumpscared by this intro

# Balan Wonderland

**EnCaine** (6.5): this is like a better version of the kidz bop we belong together ending note

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Sounds fun but I wish I could hear what they were saying

**wavingwolves** (6.1): sparkly synths yass

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): this is the cheesiest disco song i’ve ever heard

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I'm sorry but I hear the lyrics saying "drink and drive". I know that's wrong but I can't get it out of my head

**Brendon-Urine** (4): I can't with that repeated yelling in the background.

**RetrohTanner** (4): Fuck it up farmer ted!

**2dina3dworld** (1): that screaming that goes throughout the song describes how I feel about this song

And there goes the last of SuperGiant this rate. I was hoping at least one would make the top 10, but we're at the end of the road. Most of my love for the game is talked about in the Paper Boats comment, but this track is fantastic as well! It does an amazing job providing a sense of danger from early on in the game. And the part where the instruments pause and you can just hear Ashley's voice is immaculate.

I'm also so glad it made day 3 cause for a little bit of time it was actually a late day 1 track! What a robbery that wouldve been!

---

# Red

**1998tweety** (11): there were so many 11 contenders in this rate but ultimately I picked this. The way the outro hits....y'all need to play this game too cause it's really good.

**N454545** (11): THIS GAME IS FULL OF BANGERS

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Honestly, i owe so much to this song. When the first trailer for Transistor was released, with this song playing, i was absolutely obssessed. Both with the aesthetic and the music. I ended up loving the game so much, including the fantastic soundtrack, and it is still one of my all time favourite games (Red was my profile picture on so many websites for so long i was that into it), and this song is a LARGE part of it. I'm very attached to this, it's just a gorgeous, unqiue Video Game song, Ashley's vocals are insanely pretty and it's just wonderful, i couldn't NOT give it my 11

**static\_int\_husp** (11): All of supergiant's sountracks are next level, but Transistor's really knocks it out the park.

**cheatviathan** (10): Honestly, this hit harder for me than “Paper Boats” did. Ashley Barrett’s vocals are still dynamite, the lyrical content is still great, but the more intense, more synthetic instrumentation of this track just commands my attention, and forces me to marvel at it.

**PhloxInvar** (10): Showstopping song. I wouldn’t be shocked if this one won out of all the songs. There’s a reason it’s one of the first songs you hear in Transistor.

**seanderlust** (10): i'll have to check this game out or at least the soundtrack. it's 2/2 for me.

**stryxen** (10): the way this builds up is nasty i’m entranced

**welcome2thejam** (10): Don't know why I'm rating the Transitor tracks so much higher than their Supergiant counterparts. Is it the more futuristic sound? Is it because Transitor is the only one I've played? The world may never know. It is a killer soundtrack though, and this might be the best of the bunch

**nt96** (9.5): Drum & Bass goodness

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (9): pov: you're an npc in katamari damacy and you're doomed

**pig-serpent** (9): The intensity of this song is through the roof.

**plastichaxan** (9): look i'm an easy they/them i hear drum n bass i give a great rating

**steelstepladder** (8.4): Silhouettes when our bodys finally go!

**Chevsapher** (8.2): The pulsing background synth is the best part.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): one of us ay one or us ay

**fadedblue09** (8): The dramatic vocals contrast with the instrumental, but somehow it all pulls together. Kinda ended abruptly though

**Parkouricus** (8): THIS FEELS SO SHORT WHAT

**rslashpoopheads** (8): my immortal

**UltimateDomon** (8): Can you tell I'm running out of steam with these comments

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Some neat melodic and vocal ideas but the vocals are kinda flat and the drum machine drowns everything out. The final stretch is cool though!

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): I'll have what the drummer is smoking

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The singer kind of sounds like Alanis Morissette, maybe it is, who knows.

**bbfan132** (7): boppy

# Blue

**nooodisaster** (7): Wii All Become

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Just when it starts to get good it ends…

**wavingwolves** (6.8): cool

**2dina3dworld** (6): parts of this really sound like “Mad World”

**BebeLuigi** (5): Quite forgettable

**Qwilphish** (5): there is a serious mismatch between the vocal performance and the production

**runaway3212** (4): super repitative and tiring

**jayjaysortagay** (3): this sounded like shit on my speakers for some reason

And now my 2nd choice for 11 is gone : (

Baba Yetu is a GRAMMY WINNER and for good reason! Every time I hear this song it makes me feel hopeful about humanity (even though we're kind of a mess) and how much further we can go. For a little while this was day 1 which would've been a little devastating if it played out like that (though it'd be kind of funny considering there were a decent amount of winner predictions for it). Anyways, though I never played much of Civ IV, this does feel like it matches the feeling of the games where you build up your Civilization from the start and grow to be so much more. 

(also Yetti makes a really good point on the music vid )

---

# Kinda Baba

**Chevsapher** (11): Fuck, I'm crying. I remember hearing “Baba Yetu” when my dad bought Civ 4; I was 10 years old, and it felt so epic. It's been one of my favorite compositions ever since. The dynamic range, the vocals, the instrumentation, the melodies—it's all top-tier.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (11): at some point in my life i'll have spent more time exploring 3D-modeled church environments and listening to video game hymns than their real-life counterparts and i don't know when that point will be but i'm probably approaching it faster than i think (sorry mom) anyway this is gorgeous and heart-swelling and makes me think about the sheer potential of humanity and the incredible things we accomplish and the kindnesses we do each other and togetherness and unity and the light of hope in the midst of despair all those good things i promptly lose faith in as soon as the song ends. good thing i can just play it again!

**pietrohonkhonk** (11): This song is just so beautiful, I don’t know how to explain it.

**2dina3dworld** (10): deserved that Grammy

**akanewasright** (10): I wasn’t going to give this a 10, because I think this would be a boring “real music” winner for such a weird, interesting rate. But I listened to the song and nearly started crying, partially from the nostalgia of doing this song at the last choral event I had pre-covid, but also because the song is majestic as all hell

**Alumineous** (10): I did not expect a Civ song to sound this good.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this makes me feel nostalgic for a game i never even played

**BebeLuigi** (10): That track is beautiful really, I wish Sogno Di Volare had been on the rate too. As far as music goes Civilization is one of the best video game licenses out here

**bigbigbee** (10): I had an almost religious moment listening to this while on a walk one night around sunset. Holy shit is this good.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): My only memories of any Civ games are quite negative (being forced to play for HOURS with my friends while being eternally bored) but I can still recognize the genius of this song.

**celladonn** (10): Deserved that grammy. This really really really rules

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love a gospel choir

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It's memorable and sounds great.

**fadedblue09** (10): Very epic, climactic arrangements. Never played this game and I don't understand a single word, yet the last few minutes won me over

**hikkaru** (10): this is so nostalgic i remember just sitting on the title screen for civ iv bopping to this as a kid

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I can vibe to this while trying to take over greece

**ManofOranges** (10): THIS SONG IS PERFECTION!! I get chills every single fucking time I listen to this song. It's absolutely perfect, beautiful, there's nothing wrong with it. It brings a tear to my eye without fail. Impossible to hate.

**nooodisaster** (10): I was like "Am I basic for liking this song?" and then I saw it won a Grammy and I was like, "Yes"

**nt96** (10): The first video game song to win a grammy. Well deserved.

**Parkouricus** (10): oh no. oh no i've never heard this in my life but if i was 5% more unhinged today this would EASILY make me cry.

**ReallyCreative** (10): The Lord's Prayer: 👎🙅‍♀️🚫⛪🙏😒 The Lord's Prayer In Swahili:😌💋💃🎶🍑🙌😍

**runaway3212** (10): This buildup is way better than I Know The End's

**seanderlust** (10): you think church is gonna be like this until you go to a suburban church called St. Morgflop's Sacred Heart or whatever just to hear one white lady singing the Our Father prayer just one half-step down from where she should be smh

**steelstepladder** (10): Winner worthy

**stryxen** (10): I collapsed (much like civilisations tend to)

**teenwitches** (10): and if you say baba yetu, make sure you put grammy award winner in front of it

**Roxieloxie** (9.3): I have never heard of this game at all but why are they going so hard on this omg, this is an emotional experience

**bbfan132** (9): really enjoyed this

**CrimsonROSET** (9): so true babæstie

**sarcasticsobs** (9): god i’m a sucker for chanting

**1998tweety** (8): pretty

**cheatviathan** (8): I was not expecting a slapper out of this one. I was expecting something more ambient and more morose, like the menu music for Civ V. This certainly has the epic feel that you’d expect for a 4X strategy game, but is also upbeat and jubilant. This is actually something that I’d listen to unironically.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): According to the YouTube description for this video this is the first video game composition to win a Grammy in the category of “Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)" so that’s neat. Actually speaking of firsts, is this the first time outside of Worldvision that we’ve rated an artist based in Africa? That’s also neat. Vote for *The Gift* vs. *Spiderverse* vs. *Black Panther* when rerates become eligible.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): maybe the grammy's made a point with this one

**rslashpoopheads** (8): https://i.imgur.com/MXO7kyR.png

**skargardin** (8): I haven't played Civ IV but I could imagine this being a great moodsetter for sure

**slimboyfriend** (8): good in spite of the Christianity

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): oh i hear sumn

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The only song in this rate that I’ve sung in a choir. It’s beautiful yes, but it’s also kinda hard to rate it against all these other tracks that lean more towards poppy solos

**welcome2thejam** (8): The sound of this song and the initial vibes of the music video left me wildly unprepared when the catapults arrived

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): having an African Gospel choir over footage of white men colonization and conquering is certainly something

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I'm a sucker for epic chiors of people singing in foreign languages.

**Qwilphish** (7.5): sounds like those intros to an educational movie when your teacher was too hungover to teach the next day

# Kinda Yetu

**cremeebrulee** (7): maybe this will grow on me? sorry i know a bunch of people are attached to it but i think its just ok :(

**N454545** (7): not my thing but its nice.

**shhhneak** (7): r/gregorianchantheads

**UltimateDomon** (7): I get the hype for this song but its not something I'd listen to very often

**wavingwolves** (6.9): is this game about colonialism

**luckyphase** (6.7): i feel morally obligated not to tank this one as an african

**NFLfreak98** (6.7): I have no idea what this song means but I do feel it

**RetrohTanner** (6): This isn't really my vibe at all but it does go

**anothertown** (5): hey.......when are we going to be done with empire simulators

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Straight out of a 90s Disney movie

**Raxxin** (3): i dont trust men that play this game

**plastichaxan** (2): this sounds like a song from the lion king but like the remake with the dead looking lions

This track was day 1 for a bit, and that thought really frightened me. This was supposed to be his redemption for BCC! But then he rose up to day 3 with the later ballots, before solidly holding a spot in the top 15. And honestly compared to the earlier spots that was enough for me

The track itself is gorgeous. I mean it's D'Angelo, what else can I say? I haven't played RDR2 yet, but I don't really need to to appreciate how good this song sounds. Sad to see it not make the top 10

---

# Stream Shook by Tkay Maidza

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (11): I thought I was gonna give my 11 to a transistor song bc I love that video game and It affected one of my siblings’ career choices with art and everything. But God I love D’angelo and I love songs like this.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is honestly good and deserves top item in the rate.

**akanewasright** (10): D’Angelo please release more music

**Alumineous** (10): You know D'Angelo deserves. This 10 also goes to Jackbox Party Pack 4 for LAST NIGHT, you fucking know it's true.

**cheatviathan** (10): Why have I not given D’Angelo any of my attention until now? His performance on this track, especially with how the backing vocals were layered, shot my soul into the stratosphere.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): no but like, this fits so much? I’m surprised by how much it does, but I also shouldn’t be.

**endcreditouilles** (10): rated M for Masterpiece

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I listened to the first part and thought “omg this guy sounds hot” and I checked and saw it was D’Angelo and it all made sense

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i ended up dropping RDR2 because the gameplay just got way too slow for me to handle in the end, but i wish i'd stayed long enough to hear this in game, because it's STUNNING

**ReallyCreative** (10): bitch speak for yourself, I'm SHOOK at how good this is

**Roxieloxie** (10): Hi its me, popheads user Roxieloxie, known as Roxie. You may know me from febuary 2020 where i cohosted the black conscious classics rate. You know. that rate where d'angelo broke all kinds of records like getting his first 0 ( tips-of-the-yikesberk i will never forgive you) and officially being the artist that has left the rate the earliest in a 3 person lineup. I hope we all learned from out mistakes there and did not tank him here as this song is a masterpiece :)))

**runaway3212** (10): im still not over how D'angelo was treated in the BCC rate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Justice for D’Angelo!!!

**steelstepladder** (10): Y'all better be nice to D'Angelo this time for Roxie's sake

**stryxen** (10): this is… amazing?? rdr2 threw everything at this soundtrack

**wavingwolves** (10): great

**bigbigbee** (9.5): ilu arthur

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): i hate that my mind went to this but this sounds like it could be on a hunger games soundtrack

**EnCaine** (9.3): i wish i had remembered to submit for the bcc rate because I know I could have saved d'angelo 😭 I love this man so much

**bbfan132** (9): d’angelo <3 <3

**celladonn** (9): D'Angelo sounds so good here

**fadedblue09** (9): A very folky yet intimate number

**ignitethephoenix** (9): d’angelo never misses

**Parkouricus** (9): daAAMN this man's deep voice

**seanderlust** (9): me finishing other songs in this rate - aw that was fun! :) me finishing this song - I no longer fear death! :)

**skargardin** (9): TIL that D'Angelo is on the RDR soundtrack? oh wow this is a revelation

**UltimateDomon** (9): I think every video game would be improved with a D'Angelo song in it

**BoneStreetSand** (8.9): Goosebumps.

**Chevsapher** (8.6): Solid vocals, solid production, solid songwriting—this is a triple threat.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is D’Angelo’s chance to get revenge for the Black Conscious Classics Rate. The vocals and harmonies on this one would blend right in on that album but the more “outlaw” tone and darker lyrics help them blend into the world of the game very well

**Marshynarsh** (8.5): very hbo in the best way

**1998tweety** (8): ok this is MUCH better than the song from the first game

**Awkward\_King** (8): pls can we not fuck over d'angelo again please

**ManofOranges** (8): D'ANGELO?? D'ANGELO?? The way I'm basically giving this a high score because of him (but also because it's very good)

**rslashpoopheads** (8): ok actually this one is good

**BebeLuigi** (7): There's an ominous vibe to it I like it

**pig-serpent** (7): I like the more spiritual vibe and it probably fits the game well, although it's the weakest of the 3 RDR songs. I hope all 3 do well.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Honestly surprised by how much I like the RDD music? They’ve all been pretty good

My favourite of all the Bayo tracks, though this version's also a bit on the long side. Still the vocals here are amazing and track itself is an amazing rearrangement of the classic tune (though tbh I kind of really dislike a lot of the older versions of Moon River). Bayo's covers manage to find an amazing line of being recognizable while also reinventing the track and I can't wait for Bayo 3 (if it's ever actually coming...)

---

# Dream Maker

**2dina3dworld** (10): Listening to this makes me wonder if I should play Bayonetta just so that I can listen to these bops as they’re intended to be listened to

**akanewasright** (10): This is probably my favorite Bayonetta track?

**Awkward\_King** (10): remember when we thought LG6 was gonna be all video game inspired... because she tweeted abt bayonetta

**cremeebrulee** (10): i think this is my favorite of the bayo songs but its also the longest so it might flop lmao

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The best of the three.

**endcreditouilles** (10): why isn't this on Spotify!!! SEGA open your checkbook and pay those royalties!!!

**LesApfels** (10): She ate Audrey Hepburn up

**Parkouricus** (10): BAYONETTA 3 WHEN THE HELL

**PhloxInvar** (10): What a follow up to Fly Me To The Moon. Whoever managed to pick the songs for Bayonetta, they are have amazing taste. Love the variation and breaks from the intense drums with piano.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): how do you follow up the perfect Fly Me To The Moon? With another flawless cover of an old moon inspired song reinterpreted as a battle theme of course!

**ReallyCreative** (10): the moon doesn't even have a river but this still slaps

**Roxieloxie** (10): Oh this is also really nice. I was mad at the limit for a bit before i remembered that these songs are long cause they have to loop underneath the games and such so ill be forgiving of length in this rate

**seanderlust** (10): this may literally be my favorite moon river cover

**skargardin** (10): God i love the bayonetta soundtrack!!!

**steelstepladder** (10): MOON RIVERRRRRR WIIIIIIDER THAN A MIIIIILE

**waluigiest** (10): this is a chaotic rendition of this classic and let me say I’m obsessed

**shhhneak** (9.5): This gives me Dance Dance Revolution vibes and we needed that representation in this rate.

**Chevsapher** (9.1): What a cool arrangement! Dang, this is slick. I've always loved this song, but I never knew cover existed.

**1998tweety** (9): big bop

**BebeLuigi** (9): It definely is the best Bayonetta cover to me!

**runaway3212** (9): This is such a great cover

**bigbigbee** (8.5): The vocal performance on this is amazing, so playful and fun; it sounds like there's a hint of a laugh in her voice

**NFLfreak98** (8.5): The amount of synth solos here is either criminal or the best decision anyone’s made

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (8.5): i can't decide if i prefer fly me to the moon or this one. it really depends on which of the two i'm listening to at the time.

**Qwilphish** (8.5): Frank Ocean wishes his remake was this iconic

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Vinyl release when bestie?

**cheatviathan** (8): The one repeated stanza is solid, but the instrumentation, especially the piano and organ solos, maintain the same high energy that “Fly Me to the Moon” from the previous game did. This is still a banger and a half.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why does bayonetta give major Mario kart music vibes

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I want Bayonetta to moon me

**stryxen** (8): it’s simply very good and i was surprised i didn’t get bored

**UltimateDomon** (8): Never though of Moon River as a fun action song but 2014 changed everything

**fadedblue09** (7.5): So it's their brand to take a 60s classic, and give it a danceable remix? I think I like this one better but not fully worth the time

# Heartbreaker

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I liked it, but it just kept going and going and going and I felt like it never was gonna end because it went up and then back down then up then back down and I thought my YouTube was bugged

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): First of all *Breakfast at Tiffany’s* was racist, so jot that down. But anyways, I can see *why* they would pick “Moon River” for the sequel to try to recapture the magic of “Fly Me To The Moon” it doesn’t really work all that well. While I actually like “Fly Me To The Moon” (the original) less as a song, it leant itself better to adaptation than “Moon River” does because it has a more dynamic melody that lends itself to what they’re trying to go for here. “Moon River” is just such a chill song with a gentler melody that doesn’t make sense in this rollicking context and so the vocals never really manage to establish themselves in relationship to the instrumental, it always just feels like vocals being played over a mix rather than a *song*. The constituent parts are pretty good so it gets a solid number of points but it’s definitely not as good as its predecessor.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Interesting interpretation…

**bbfan132** (6.5): the production was a bit too busy for me but it was fine

**pig-serpent** (6.5): It's an interesting sound for a eurobeat song, and it has some cool parts towards the end. Like all the Baynetta songs, it sounds a little too cluttered and that's holding it back.

**wavingwolves** (6.1): i'm sorry to say but while this is cool it's also WAYYY to long

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6): Vocals are nice but this is literally just a short chorus repeated for five minutes

**nooodisaster** (6): Lowkey sounds cheap... was there no budget this time around?

**Raxxin** (6): this one flopped in comparision to fly me to the moon

**slimboyfriend** (6): Will this song ever end? Did they TRIPLE the length?

**plastichaxan** (5.4): this is so long and for what

**Alumineous** (5): Well, it's better than Fly Me To the Moon. I have nothing against the game, but damn, this is just too long. At around 3 minutes, it completely loses me because my brain finally noticed it was just repeating the same words. I just find that lazy. If this is a battle theme, I can imagine it being very fatiguing on the 10th listen, and I'll just play my own music. The only positive is that the instrumentation is really good.

**astrologicalangel** (5): everything that works for Fly Me To The Moon doesn't work here

**jayjaysortagay** (5): doesn't have the same spark as the first one

**N454545** (5): It's fine.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): not only does this not work as well as Fly Me To The Moon, it’s twice as long.

All of the Borderlands games in the franchise have pretty iconic opening songs, but this stands above the rest. I'm a little surprised this made it to day 3 considering it's probably more in indieheads' wheelhouse, but I'm not mad! Lyrically the comparison between the people he meets in the song all are a little... lopsided (but i guess that's the point anyways). But the song itself is a bop and a great opener to the game

# Vault Hunters

**astrologicalangel** (10): I never knew this was a video game theme song?? What???

**endcreditouilles** (10): The perfect opening to a top tier game. The Borderlands series are some of my favorite games of all time, I will always recommend them to any kind of gamer. Oh no, there ain't no rest for the wicked, until we close our eyes for good.

**ManofOranges** (10): Borderlands was absolutely a cultural reset and Borderlands 2 was one of my favorite games of the 2010s, fantastic games both of them. They hold a special place in my heart.

**stryxen** (10): this cutscene changed me as a child and cage the elephant is good

**BoneStreetSand** (9.6): Wowser what a track!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): One of the most iconic opening songs of the 7th generation, and it's SUCH a megabop

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**cremeebrulee** (9): BOP!!!!!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): omg this is on the LVCRFT album that came out last year

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (9): well now a couple hours passed and i was shitting at my house

**steelstepladder** (9): Cage slays live

**Chevsapher** (8.9): Probably the best lyrics in the rate. I have a hard time believing this isn't a cover of folk standard—that's how good it is.

**UltimateDomon** (8.5): This song made me feel so cool when I was 13

**ImADudeDuh** (8): bop but it gives “if you look at the lyrics, its kinda misogynistic” vibes

**Raxxin** (8): guilty pleasure

**ReallyCreative** (8): a classique

**welcome2thejam** (8): Second best of the Borderlands intro songs

**luckyphase** (7.5): anyone up for billy bunny's animal songs? [1:02] https://youtu.be/bHmPAIVUm7E

# Claptrap

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): begone, indieheads

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it’s good but if it was on the radio I’d change the station.

**cheatviathan** (7): The lyrical content reminds me of “What It’s Like” by Everlast, and not in a good way. That filthy instrumental with a generous helping of slide guitar, alongside the animated vocal performance and comparatively short length, makes up for a lot.

**nooodisaster** (7): ~that's just the way it is~

**Parkouricus** (7): lykke li outsold sorry

**nt96** (6): I’m not really into Cage the Elephant nor did I ever liked this song. Nevertheless, it fits the game pretty well.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): idk it just sounds like some generic rock band boy song

**bbfan132** (4): not my thing at all rip

**EnCaine** (2): there are not many popular alt-rock songs from the last 15 years i like less than this

It's great track, but probably not one I'd listen to outside the rate. Still, it's definitely interesting. They really sell the bond theme here and it sounds better than most of them tbh. At the very least I have to give credit to Cynthia Harrell who kills the vocal part of the song.

Also I'm a little surprised MGS didn't get more rep compared to how music great music it's put out, but a lot of the other songs are not exactly... popheads core. Still glad to see this one in day 3 though! This is the first one being eliminated today that never left day 3 after the first 10 ballots came in.

# Up the ladder

**kirby31200** (11): No opening scene could ever top this. This song evoking Bond movie themes imo is a direct assertion to the audience that this game is a cinematic work of art. This game challenged what my child self's idea of what video games were and what stories they could tell.

**steelstepladder** (11): climbs ladder

**welcome2thejam** (11): PSA: All rate participants who scored this song below a 7 will be hereby punished with multiple trips up and down The Ladder. Additionally, all rate participants who scored this classic 7 or higher will be graciously rewarded with multiple trips up and down The Ladder.

**1998tweety** (10): this is giving me DRAMA, what a bop!

**anothertown** (10): this is so fucking good!!!!!!! ahh!!!!!!!!

**cheatviathan** (10): It was a crime that Smash Bros. Brawl only put in an instrumental version of this track, because it feels naked without Cynthia Harrell’s vocals on it. The entire song is this bombastic yet smooth ballad that’s a better Bond theme than most Bond themes, and every piece just works.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I like snakes

**jayjaysortagay** (10): giving me bond theme yazz

**ManofOranges** (10): Reminds me a lot of the bond theme "goldfinger" which is a coincidence because "snake eater" and "goldfinger" are both nicknames of mine in the bedroom

**PhloxInvar** (10): A lot more low-key than some of my 10s in this rate, but it’s so well made and so good to listen to I couldn’t possibly give it anything lower. The drama, the classic jazz, the brass, the music, it’s amazing.

**ReallyCreative** (10): you put me in a room with that fine ass, FINE-ASSED man and I'll be a Snake Eater too

**RetrohTanner** (10): Billie Eilish and Adele have tried, but this is th best bond song

**skargardin** (10): I need to replay this at some point, this song really sets the theme so perfectly ugH

**UltimateDomon** (10): Might be the best opening song in video game history

**Chevsapher** (9.8): The arrangement! The drama! The VOCALS!

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): this goes harder than any Bond song, this is a very correct take

**Qwilphish** (9.5): her vocals are going off wow. such a strong track

**bbfan132** (9): short but beautiful!

**celladonn** (9): What a, and I can't stress this enough, thrill

**CrimsonROSET** (9): honestly I could see this in a Bond movie

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Throwback to /u/creemebrulee almost saying "EATER 3" to include the word snake in her Codenames hint.

**nt96** (9): I would be very surprised if this doesn’t land the top 5.

**Parkouricus** (9): i wanna climb a really big ladder now

**seanderlust** (9): bond theme vibes

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Aww hell yeah. A great Bond-esque ballad and… wait… did she just say “you feed on a tree frog”??

**waluigiest** (9): this is epic

**shhhneak** (8.8): It’s obviously inspired by vintage Bond themes, the best kind.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Kind of outsold multiple actual James Bond anthems.

**Awkward\_King** (8): ooooooooooooooo

**ImADudeDuh** (8): why is this an actual bond theme and its good???

**runaway3212** (8): sounds like a bond theme

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): we love a James Bond eqse theme

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is just so perfectly bombastic

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Bond theme teas but without the star power

**luckyphase** (7.5): the vocal mixing turns me off from listening for some reason?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): eating snakes sounds like a bad idea

# Down the ladder

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Love the concept / theme (sort of sounds like a Bond theme) but I can't say I really like listening to this.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (6.5): save the frogs :'(

**AHSWeeknd** (6): it’s good but the production could’ve been better

**stryxen** (6): it happened it was pretty good and then it ended

**BebeLuigi** (5): It's good! Really dramatic, quite forgettable tho

**slimboyfriend** (5): "someday you'll feed on a tree frog"...?

**fadedblue09** (4): Sounds like a bad parody of a James Bond song

**rslashpoopheads** (4): very melodramatic

**wavingwolves** (4): not even half as cool as the title suggests

**pig-serpent** (3): We put this slog in instead of Rules of Nature?

Surprised? So was I, except for the fact it never came close to winning the entire rate.

As many times I saw this predicted to win (and trust me it was a LOT) it was never really in contention. Heck, it never even entered the top 5 the entire rate and for parts of May was not even making day 3!

Anyways this is a bop. Yes, I am feeling kinda bug kinda snack thank you. KKB just adds so much flavour to whatever they do and this song is no exception. Did they have to go this hard for a game about bug snacks? No. Am I glad they did? 100%

---

# Kinda snax

**brenda\_official** (11): this is one of my favorite kkb songs and i dont even know what bugsnax is

**runaway3212** (11): EVERYONE'S TALKING BOUT BUGSNAX

**wavingwolves** (11): i don't care what people have to say about this being a "boring winner" and ''it's only going to win bc it's by an artist the sub likes''. you're not wrong about any of these things but the song still bangs and i looped this for hours and got to 170 plays of it in the space of two days making this my most listened song this year

**2dina3dworld** (10): this bug-SLAPS

**akanewasright** (10): This song is literally just an injection of serotonin

**alexpiercey** (10): its snugbax!

**Awkward\_King** (10): sarah bonito i am free on friday on friday i am free in [undisclosed location in the uk] i am free sarah bonito to eat lunch i am free sarah bonito on friday

**celladonn** (10): me when it's Bugsnax

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): KINDA HIKK AND KINDA TILT

**EnCaine** (10): kinda bop and kinda slaps

**endcreditouilles** (10): kinda bug and kinda snack / lick my pussy and my crack

**hikkaru** (10): contrary to popular belief, it is in fact bugsnax

**nooodisaster** (10): Outsold literally all other music

**pig-serpent** (10): KKB have three kinds of songs for me. Songs that start at a 6 and remain a 6. Songs that start at a 10 and drop to a 6 as I get bored of them, and songs that start at 10 and stay there. It might be a bit early to tell, but I think this is in the last category.

**plastichaxan** (10): it pains me so much not to give this an 11, i wish i could give 2, or 3 or 4

**Qwilphish** (10): Its a great video game track with great vocals on time what could be better!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): tbh i don’t even particularly love Bugsnax, but i feel like not giving a 10 to KKB would be sacrilege on my part

**seanderlust** (10): KINDA BUG AND KINDA SNACK https://media.tenor.com/images/c77a6b741d5afabc2063d46e1dbc8c66/tenor.gif

**steelstepladder** (10): Not only are you telling me this is kinda bug, but you are ALSO telling me that it's kinda snack??? This I gotta see.

**stryxen** (10): I want to live in this universe where EVERYONE is talking about bugsnax

**Parkouricus** (9.5): bunger deserves this

**Alumineous** (9): Cute vocals, cute lyrics. Has Kero Kero Bonito done a candy commercial? And my brain just listened to 3 mediocre Bayonetta tracks, inflating what would have been a 7.

**astrologicalangel** (9): why is this so catchy???

**BebeLuigi** (9): I really had an existential crisis over whether or not I should buy Bugsnax because of that song haha it's so addictive

**cremeebrulee** (9): kinda rate kinda loser

**kirby31200** (9): Its win may not be completely deserved but I can't be mad

**nt96** (9): Quite catchy!

**rotating3Dtext** (9): this song just makes me so happy

**skargardin** (9): EVERYONE'S TALKING BOUT BUGSNAX

**welcome2thejam** (9): My dearest dudes, I do believe that it is time to Bugsnax

**anothertown** (8.5): i did hate the gameplay but i appreciate that this was a perfect match of artist/themesong/game

**bbfan132** (8.5): super cute/fun but not my favorite kkb song

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): GIRLS WE HAVE A KEY CHANGE

**LesApfels** (8.5): It's such a cool full-circle moment for KKB to have their own video game theme after being so influenced by video game soundtracks

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (8.5): kinda sus and kinda wack

**PhloxInvar** (8.5): ICONIC. Probably not Top 20, let alone Top 10 material. Still, this is just a blessing of a song. Kero Kero Bonito is the prefect artist to tackle the cartoonish delight of Bugsnax that disguises its pretty horrifying concept under its bright colors and round shapes.

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): When she said “discover it’s Bugsnax”, I felt that

**Chevsapher** (8.1): I knew this was Keto Kero Bonito before I even read the title. It's a cute track; I feel like the quirky vocals work better in this context than on their albums.

**BoneStreetSand** (8): Really grew on me. So cute.

**cheatviathan** (8): Even if this game wasn’t based on a terrifying premise, and even if the Octodad devs weren’t creating it, I would still be interested in this one on the basis of “Kero Kero Bonito did the theme for this? Whatever it is, I’m buying.” I just wish it wasn’t an Epic Store exclusive. The track itself is as cutesy, eccentric, and infectious as a lot of KKB’s output, and I dig it for that.

**Raxxin** (8): everyone's talking about bugsnax

**rslashpoopheads** (8): icawnic

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): I hope this is not winning but i also cant sink it tooo much you know? the first time i heard this was in plug during the top 100 reveal where i did not know what it is and when i asked everyone yelled back ITS BUGSNAX which wasnt very helpful. anyway its a cute lil bop

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): it’s cute and has a great melody but I can’t stand her voice I’m sorry

**1998tweety** (7): she bops a bit

**CrimsonROSET** (7): if this wins the rate gamers will prove that they really are the most oppressed class

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Bugsnax? More like BugSLAPS! Hahaha this song is just okay though but I’m glad we’re finally rating KKB, I saw them live and it was really cute because it was a small venue and the crowd was super into it.

**slimboyfriend** (7): kkb could put this on a studio album and I'd be like "yeah"

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): KKB’s bubbly melodies and N64-esque synths fit video game music so well! Also I just looked up the plot of Bugsnax and ummm I’m uncomfortable

**waluigiest** (7): so let me get this straight wait I’M the bugsnax?

# Kinda bug

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i will be upset if this wins the rate. This is just a kero kero bonito song !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**ReallyCreative** (6): is this not just a regular KKB track

**UltimateDomon** (6): I like the novelty of KKB singing this song more than the song itself

**turtle\_on\_mars** (5.8): smh Bugsnax continuing the trend of unneeded rap verses ruining what could've been a good bop

**NFLfreak98** (5.5): I do not want to eat a snack with bug in the name

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Everyone? Everyone’s talking about bugsnax? I don’t see Lana Del Rey talking about bugsnax!!

**fadedblue09** (5): Welp this was a whelming nursery rhyme ripoff. I wasn't expecting to like this since I gave a 0 to the last KKB song I heard, but for a frontrunner I expected something more….idk, transcendental?

**RetrohTanner** (5): Feels like the Bugsnax people reached out to KKB and were like "ok, so we like flamingo, could you make a song for our game thats like flamingo but a bit less weird?", ignorant of the fact that KKB have spent all the time since flamingo just getting weirder and weirder

**N454545** (1): This is some cocomelon shit.

**shhhneak** (0): This song is half exposition and half incomprehensible.

Not very many people expected this one to get far into day 3, but instead it's going to be the first to break over the 8 barrier (if only just barely)

This track is just so interesting! It's in a language that's not even real and is singing about the pointlessness of life in a game that maybe not too many played as it was a PS Vita exclusive for a bit. Anyways when you have a song where the instruments are really fun and the singer goes all out, despite singing gibberish, you have to respect it for that at the minimum.

# I'm levitating

**2dina3dworld** (11): I thought that I’d try and write an insightful comment about why this got my 11. But, as the Tuesday extension deadline approached, I realised that I had nothing particularly interesting or worth saying about why this is my 11. The only observation I can make is that it was stuck in my head as soon as I listened to it for the first time, and has refused to exit and I enjoyed every second of it

**1998tweety** (10): ok but why is this amazing

**AHSWeeknd** (10): composition snapped!

**cheatviathan** (10): Never played this game. All I know is that even in a foreign language, this swinging jazz number about the ephemeral nature of life hit me way harder than I was expecting.

**cremeebrulee** (10): sorry i don’t speak italian

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): Very fun, particularly the piano and wind instrument moment around 1:30

**hikkaru** (10): a someone who played clarinet in band class I'm such a whore for this

**nt96** (10): They did NOT have to go this hard, but ladies and gentlemen they DID! On a made up language no less!

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (10): i love fake videogame languages and jazzy tracks, so put those together and hell yeah i'm gonna jam

**pig-serpent** (10): So they made up a fake language that sounds like french to fit into a style of jazz popular in that part of europe instead of just using French? Whatever, this song rules.

And now that we're in the top 10 we finally we have our last series not to lose a representative!

Though really both Portal tracks are so good I would've been fine with either winning. Though, and maybe uncommon opinion (now proven through this rate!) but I prefer this to Still Alive. Though both are solid 10s, I think GLaDoS really shines through better on this track than the softer Still Alive. 

---

# Want it back

**akanewasright** (10): I love this song for how much it works as a character piece for GLaDOS. Like, it explores actual complexity for her, especially about her feelings on Caroline, the woman she kind of is. It explores her mind in a way that not even Stay Alive did. Plus I love the fact that it’s essentially just a rock song that got GLaD-ified

**alexpiercey** (10): The rare follow up that's actually better than the original

**Awkward\_King** (10): what a bad bitch

**bigbigbee** (10): I wish I could know how this sounds to someone who doesn't know the story of Portal 2; as someone who DOES know it, I find this incredibly moving

**celladonn** (10): This seems so be less popular but it is ever so slightly better than Still Alive

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): In hindsight this isn't as good as Still Alive, but.. It's Portal 2..

**fadedblue09** (10): Damn, the way a fucking AI voice can sell more emotion than most human vocalists!

**LesApfels** (10): Stan GLaDOS or perish

**ManofOranges** (10): Portal 2 holds a very special place in my heart. Despite it being the sequel, it was actually the first portal game that I had played. It was like the second or third game I ever got for my PS3, and I was absolutely hooked when I played it. I had such a great time playing it, even though I had a very hard time figuring out some of the puzzles, because the game was just so endearinng. GLaDOS became one of my favorite video game characters in a matter of seconds, and that only become more evident when she got put into a potato. There's no experience I hold more dear than finishing that game for the first time and shooting that portal on the moon. I never got sick of it. That game was so fun to me that it actually ended up being the only game that I ever speedran for fun without even realizing that I was speedrunning it. I would wake up on Saturday mornings and boot up the game and see how fast I could do it. I think at one point I actually was able to complete it in like an hour or something, which I must say I'm very proud of. And in spite of playing the game so many times, I never got sick of it, because of the fantastic gameplay, atmosphere, and most importantly the ending. The turret opera at the end of Portal 2 actually has brought me to tears before. Once I'm done writing this I'll probably watch it on Youtube and cry again. It's just so beautiful. And then the game's perfect little bow on top is this song. There's absolutely nothing more satisfying than that.

**nooodisaster** (10): A sequel that in many ways out-shined the original. This ending is still amazing, not as amazing as Still Alive, but still endlessly replayable.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (10): oh, this one made me laugh but also kind of sad. "you want your freedom, take it/that's what i'm counting on/i used to want you dead/but now i only want you gone" is an incredible sequence

**plastichaxan** (10): damn who hurt them like that :(

**Qwilphish** (10): oh god i think i used to be obsessed with this song when portal 2 came out. I think I bought it on iTunes

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It's crazy that they managed to make a sequel song to Still Alive that both feels familiar and like something new. I love this just as much as the original.

**runaway3212** (10): I love Caroline Pochacheck

**skargardin** (10): "goodbye, my only friend. Oh, did you think I meant you?" is just an absolutely iconic line

**steelstepladder** (10): Lowkey amazing advice??? Like I became much happier in life after I stopped getting angry at people and just moved on from them and continued living my own life. I've legitimately listened to this after ugly breakups and it KILLS

**stryxen** (10): want you to come 2nd (and for still alive to come 1st)

**UltimateDomon** (10): Still Alive felt like a really cute gimmick song but this is like an absolute masterpiece

**welcome2thejam** (10): Still Alive works better as a Portal ending track, but as a song on its own, I like this one better

**shhhneak** (9.5): Sophia the Robot could never.

**1998tweety** (9): another bop but not as big as the previous one

**cheatviathan** (9): I’ll be honest. I enjoy this one significantly more than “Still Alive”. Those gurgling alien synths are more memorable to me than the pop rock instrumentation of that song, the lower pitched vocals are more appealing to me, and the sentiment of “Trying to kill you has become more trouble than it’s worth. Get the hell out of my sight” is one I can get behind.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is a really silly song, it would fit perfectly into a musical but the robot vocals just give it a little bit something extra with the camp factor that they add.

**Parkouricus** (9): the key change into the chorus is INCREDIBLY clever

**pig-serpent** (9): The superior Portal song as I feel like it has everything I like about Still Alive but adds in a lot of sublties to keep repeat listenings engaging.

**Roxieloxie** (9): also good

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): You know… take away the synth voice and this ABSOLUTELY something I would be rocking out to in my spare time. GLaDOS new main pop rock girl??

**bbfan132** (8.5): this production <3

**luckyphase** (8.5): this kinda goes in

**Chevsapher** (8.4): It's not “Still Alive,” but it's good for what it is.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I mean, not as good as Still Alive, but still a banger.

**lolcevan** (8): i love tomodachi life!

**RetrohTanner** (8): My god! These bitches gay! Good for them!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Which The 1975 song is this

**BebeLuigi** (7): More interesting than the song from the first game for sure

**ImADudeDuh** (7): with a few line changes, this could be a song on SOUR

**wavingwolves** (7): no i did not think you were talking about me

# Want it gone

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): I can't help but feel like this lacks the same aura that Still Alive has, that was this unsettling quiet ballad whereas this is more just straightforward rock. still well written

**2dina3dworld** (6): imagine fucking a robot off this bad

**rslashpoopheads** (6): not quite as kyoot

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I need to play the game to appreciate this more [2]

**ReallyCreative** (4): me to this song

**AHSWeeknd** (3): Well

And now we say goodbye to a gay icon. And in pride month no less!

I don't know if I love this cover, but it's still really good! And it's better than most of the versions I've heard of the song. My comment for Moon River stands similarly here as the Bayo soundtracks are really good at reinventing these classics. Good to see at least one make top 10!

---

# Play among the stars

**2dina3dworld** (10): Frank Sinatra found dead in a ditch!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Bayonetta knows how to make bops.

**endcreditouilles** (10): Bayonetta is a trip of a game and this cover is a perfect representation of it. Sailor Moon assassin vibes

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I was never that fond of the song “Fly Me To The Moon” and one too many shifts at work listening to the Frank Sinatra Pandora station made me outright hate it (seriously, just listen to [“Destination Moon”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pkiSPoZiIU) instead) but damn, this arrangement slaps. I’m always a fan of covers that make songs faster (I feel like for most people the natural inclination is to make things slower and to strip them down but no, make them poppier!) and the energy that they imbibe the original with is incredible. It’s also very evocative of the feel of Bayonetta herself, notice how the jazzy instrumental is pure controlled chaos that pumps along in a way that makes you feel like you’re barely hanging on while the vocals are completely relaxed. And it’s the vocals that push it over the edge really, her breathy tone and mirthful performance just nail the vibe that they’re going for. This is a win contender for me.

**luckyphase** (10): this one's for Mysterious Destiny 🤺

**ManofOranges** (10): Step on my neck Ms. Bayonetta

**N454545** (10): It's a banger. I don't even play Bayonetta.

**nooodisaster** (10): FLY ME TO DA MOON N LET ME PLAY AMONG DA STARS. I hadn't even played this game & I jammed to this song. Proof old white music does NOT need to be boring.

**nt96** (10): The most twerkable song on this list.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is without a doubt the best cover of this song, and honestly better than the original imo (though the original is amazing too). I absolutely adore it, it sets the tone of Bayonetta PERFECTLY, and it’s just a fanastic display of video game music.

**Roxieloxie** (10): So i've heard of this series before but I dont know much about this lady other than being a big tiddy goth lady but i love that for her.

**skargardin** (10): Im giving all Bayonetta songs straight tens to manifest Bayonetta 3 showing up at the Nintendo Direct tomorrow. It WIll happen

**UltimateDomon** (10): This is the greatest version of Fly me to the Moon ever recorded

**akanewasright** (9.5): Quite frankly outsold that flop Frankie Sinner.

**LesApfels** (9.5): Frank Sinatra WISHES

**Parkouricus** (9.5): chord progression: EXQUISITE vocals: EXQUISITE that piano solo like a minute in: COMPLETELY MAKES THIS

**plastichaxan** (9.5): that sinatra guy tried but bayonetta outsold him

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): camp

**1998tweety** (9): MASSIVE bop, the vocals could be a bit better but the rest is amazing

**cheatviathan** (9): If you ever wanted to hear what “Fly Me to the Moon” would sound like if it soundtracked a spectacle fighter focused on angels and witches, this is that, and goddamn do those pianos kill it. Stellar reinterpretation of a classic song.

**seanderlust** (9): (adds to a playlist called "songs that would k-word frank sinatra on the spot)

**shhhneak** (9): Unironically better than the original. Sinatra you’re bones.

**steelstepladder** (9): Ducktales Moon Theme

**waluigiest** (9): it’s so groovy and I live for the little flute bits

**wavingwolves** (8.9): this is frantic in a way that i really appreciate but the ending theme for neon genesis evangelion is still the best version of this song (sorry to the hag who got famous singing it)

**Chevsapher** (8.7): Ugh, I'm such a sucker for a piano and strings.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (8.5): jaunty

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This could fit on the second disc of Kylie's Light Years tbh.

**EnCaine** (8): frank sinatra could never

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i did not think this was gonna be this good wtf

**jayjaysortagay** (8): 💃💃🕺💃💃

**PhloxInvar** (8): What a reimagining of a classic song! I love that Bayonetta literally took such a sad song and made a whole new different and somewhat better song.

**pig-serpent** (8): Hey this is cheating! But actually having a more honky tonk dance remix of this song is pretty cool, but I have to admit I'll always love the Eva version.

**Qwilphish** (8): bayonetta is such a baddie

**sarcasticsobs** (8): let me rate Neon Genesis Evangelion songs, dammit

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): this cover is a serve

**NFLfreak98** (7.7): What if Frank Sinatra but it was a banger?

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun cover

**stryxen** (7.1): wig flew to the moon

# In other words

**Awkward\_King** (7): this was a 10 but i lowered it when i was reminded how fucking elite moon river and tomorrow is mine are

**BebeLuigi** (7): Bayonetta could create Sing Me To The Moon but could Sinatra defeat demons with heels guns? I don't think so

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I think the vocals get buried under the instrumentals but it’s cool seeing a jazz cover in a video game rate

**fadedblue09** (7): First thought was "sounds like a 60s pop track layered on top of more modern, danceable beats" (and it is!) Definitely an unusual song but I'm not sure how to feel about it yet.

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): Dua Lipa on the Future Nostalgia cover

**rslashpoopheads** (7): :booba:

**kirby31200** (6.5): Way too busy, it honestly sounds like two songs playing at the same time or like a bad nightcore remix of itself

**alexpiercey** (6.1): it's fine

**CrimsonROSET** (6): fly me To The Moon - Everything's Alright

**runaway3212** (6): I dont love her voice here

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): When I heard Fly Me to the Moon was in this game I didn’t expect it to sound like this…

**Alumineous** (4): I find this so interesting that this is a battle song. It's just not what I expected for, well, a battle song.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): way overproduced

I'm a little surprised this track made it this high. Sure it's a cute song, but compared to the rest of the rate (and especially day 3) it feels a little out of place. Still it's got fans at least, as evidenced by a ton of 10's (though no 11's). Anyways this made it to #2 at one point, but a few low scores brought it down to here. Never leaving the top 10 was pretty impressive though

---

# Knows her name

**agentofscranton** (10): mona pi11a robbed but ashlegend still smacks

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ashley main pop girl.

**Alumineous** (10): The Japanese version of Smash Ultimate actually has a faithful recreation of the DS original, and I'm disappointed NoA didn't do the same. The original arrangement makes sense for Ashley's character, and this arrangement sounds... too perfect. I want to stress that this version is REALLY good and I'm not against jazz, but it's not my favourite.

**anothertown** (10): eye of newt! i cast a hex on you!!!

**bbfan132** (10): queen

**BebeLuigi** (10): Ashley IS the moment, a main pop girl!!!! Mona Pizza should have been here too

**cremeebrulee** (10): she did to halsey what halsey wishes she could do to pitchfork

**hikkaru** (10): bop, miss ashley snapped. i loved warioware so much as a kid and would always play her levels (and also mona pizza, another queen with a bop) bc the song slaps so much

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This lowkey could be a broadway number

**ManofOranges** (10): Yasss not like other girls gateboss girllight gaskeep

**Qwilphish** (10): Ashley is the most relatable character in this entire rate

**Raxxin** (10): watch out ariana

**ReallyCreative** (10): girl you don't have to cast a spell to make my pants not fit

**Roxieloxie** (10): idk who ashely is and why shes not like other girls but go off sis

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic but just consider that we could have also had Mona Pizza and Tomorrow Hill if you frumpy buffoons had any taste

**runaway3212** (10): Ruling the world and doing her homework??? this girl has it all

**SFbby** (10): A classic but I still don't know who Ashley is.

**steelstepladder** (10): When Ashley is feeling goofy she'll turn your teacher into a spork

**teenwitches** (10): this is insanely good for absolutely no reason

**UltimateDomon** (10): This songs pops into my head at least once a day

**waluigiest** (10): YES I was so into this when Brawl came out

**welcome2thejam** (10): Joke's on her, I WANT my pants to be gigantic

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): who the fuck is Halsey?? This is the only main pop girl named Ashley that I recognise

**akanewasright** (9.2): This is camp ~~although I do like the Japanese version better ~~

**Chevsapher** (9): “And if you say no, you're TOAST.” Out of all the WarioWare songs, this one has the best songwriting by far. I prefer the arrangement from WarioWare Gold, but the upright bass and the organ in this version are fantastic.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): best part of submitting late: I can comment on Nintendo E3! Y’all better buy the new WarioWare when it comes out!

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): This bops, but Kaidan outsold.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song is so much fun but let’s take a second to talk about Ashley’s internalized misogyny… sis you can be a powerful witch AND have time for “girly things like that.” Don’t curse me though lol

**nt96** (9): Best song in the franchise bar none.

**PhloxInvar** (9): While I’m mad the Body Rock didn’t get in; this is such an amazing song too that I can’t even be mad.

**pig-serpent** (9): Probably the catchiest vocal song in Nintendo's catalog. The drumming is simple, but still really cool. I was obsessed with this song in 5th grade.

**shhhneak** (8.9): She said she’s the greatest Ashley and I believe her.

**plastichaxan** (8.8): outsold halsey

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop, stan this queen

**Parkouricus** (8.5): shoutout to that one supper mario broth post about how ashley probably still has more friends than the listener,. which is true

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): omg grandma's wig

**BoneStreetSand** (8): Great lyrics.

**celladonn** (8): She is everything I aspire to be

**cheatviathan** (8): This was a pleasant surprise. While I still prefer the jazzier arrangement that appeared in Smash, the deadpan delivery and DS quality mastering still has its charm. The lyrical content is still a solid introduction to Ashley as a character no matter which version we’re rating.

**cyborglilith** (8): a serve

**EnCaine** (8): flop queen

**N454545** (8): lyrics are kind of cringe but this is catchy.

**skargardin** (8): now why does this mop

**luckyphase** (7.9): could also go on a soundtrack for the fairly odd parents?

# Is this Halsey?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): Ashley main pop girl! But this song drags a bit

**seanderlust** (7): not grandma's wig! it's kind of cute, but I feel like I would enjoy this more if I knew more about nintendo/mario lore. plus one point for the trumpet going HAM during the solo.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): do break up pop rock

**nooodisaster** (6.5): "I- have- granted- kids- to- hell-!" Oh no, not again!

**pietrohonkhonk** (6.5): NLOG anthem

**wavingwolves** (3.2): ashley's too girlboss for me i fear

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Probably captures her character very well, but her vocals are so unbearable

**2dina3dworld** (1): I am not afraid of the great Ashley, but I am afraid of this musical abomination.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (0): this song is the audio equivalent of 5 hours spent babysitting your parents' church friends' terrible kid who only respects male authority because her mom's entire approach to discipline is "wait till your father gets home" i'm exhausted

# Ashleyvision

**endcreditouilles** (10): It was aaashley all along!

**jayjaysortagay** (10): Ashley All Along

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): it was ashley all along!

**stryxen** (8): wandavision wishes

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): wandavision?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): ...So we all agree that WandaVision totally copied this right?

**bigbigbee** (5): I think the vocal performance on this is kind of rough on purpose, but I don't enjoy it, and it goes on WAY too long. Also because I'll never have a place to rant about this besides here (Spoilers for Wandavision): >!Agatha All Along" is NOT that funny and I have no idea how it became such a meme. I suspect it was a heavy dose of astroturfing by Disney.!<

the other Utada track says goodbye, and making it pretty far to boot! I've mentioned it before, but this is actually my least favourite of the Sanctuaries (my top one would be Passion After the Battle) but it's still a solid 10! Also, like Portal 2, I actually like this better than Simple and Clean (though again both are 10s)

Kingdom Hearts 2 was my first Kingdom Hearts game and this song always brings me back to that simpler time when I was a kid and still had a brief idea what was going on plotwise in the franchise

---

# Organization

**BebeLuigi** (11): That song makes me so emotional, it really is perfect on every level. It's been one of my favourite songs since I was 8 and I doubt it will ever change, I can't not give it the maximum

**1998tweety** (10): hot take but this is the better of the 2 songs there I said it

**agentofscranton** (10): the best of the three kingdom hearts themes imo

**AHSWeeknd** (10): electric guitar snapped

**akanewasright** (10): This is just positively transcendent. When I listen to this, I feel like I’m walking through the remains of a broken world.

**bbfan132** (10): gorgeous, love it

**BoneStreetSand** (10): Could've been an 11 but Simp1e and C1ean exists.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the backwards vocals are great for the eerie vibe this song gives

**cyborglilith** (10): Utada is a legend

**fadedblue09** (10): Ending version would have been an 11 contender, but this is equally as divine.

**kirby31200** (10): I've always liked this one more than Simple and Clean. The opening of Kingdom Hearts 2 sticks with me all these years later.

**Parkouricus** (10): what an absolute journey in a single song, this is just. because of the context this one song feels like such a spectacle i love it to DEATH

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song is nice no i am not being held at gunpoint by a certain phcj mod to say this please dont look behind the camera oh god oh fuck

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**seanderlust** (10): OOWAIENUSKUDIEOOOWS!!! MY HEARTS A BATTLEGROUND!!!! HISWOASHOWTAWURSKEEDA!!!!!!!

**shhhneak** (10): Iconic. If I had to name one song to represent all of video games it would be this one. That’s history.

**skargardin** (10): I have a bit more nostalgia for this than Simple and Clean given that I was introduced to the franchise with KH II (probably the worst place to start, right? :deadbananatree:), although I slightly prefer simple and clean as a theme song

**steelstepladder** (10): The best Kingdo

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): why did i think poker face started playing in the background one minute into this

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): Aside from soundtracking one of the best video game openings I've ever seen, this song is great

**Chevsapher** (9.3): This has such a specific aesthetic, but it absolutely nails it.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): yas put that thing down, flip it and reverse it

**PhloxInvar** (9): The melancholy and melodrama didn’t appeal at first, but this has grown to be a favorite in this video game playlist.

**stryxen** (9): this is so dramatic i love it. main character moment

**UltimateDomon** (9): My least favorite of the main KH songs but still amazing

**nooodisaster** (8.5): lemme fall backwards through glass and land upside down on the sand w my anime gf real quick

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): When i was a kid and KH2 was my entry to the series, i had no idea what was happening in this opening, but i remember thinking the song was a bop. Fast forward to 2019 when i finished KH1 and CoM and got back to KH2 and the opening still barely made sense, but the song STILL bopped

**cheatviathan** (8): Is it a controversial take to say I like this more than “Simple and Clean”? Because I like this one more than “Simple and Clean”. The consistent good part of all of these KH tracks is Utada Hikaru, but the instrumentation here is off-kilter and dynamic enough to keep me engaged. The reversed vocals should be a grating gimmick, but they actually work here. I especially like how the electric guitar is used with just enough restraint to make its prominence in the bridge sound exhilarating.

**ReallyCreative** (8): not as big of a fan of this one, but it's still REALLY good

**runaway3212** (8): stunning

**welcome2thejam** (8): If you listen to the distorted parts backwards, the lyrics contain the message "Goofy is dead"

# Nobody

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): I feel like I should love this, but something about it 8s just a little off

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): there’s too many weird vocal effects here

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): “Easy Breezy” outsold

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (6): this beat is kind of anxious and off-putting to me. feels like it's trying to rush or fight with the vocals

**Qwilphish** (6): Not as iconic as simple and clean.... and deserved

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Meh. The backwards parts are a bit too distracting

**Brendon-Urine** (5): I love their voice so much but drum part is so disjointed and akward, doesn't mesh well imo

**pig-serpent** (5): The opening harmonies are very pretty but once the song starts it's a bit too cluttered and not particularly engaging.

**LesApfels** (3): Those jumbled vocals just don't work for me

**Raxxin** (3): not a fan

It's a fun track, but Tricky is a much better song so I'm glad that got the win. Regardless, this song's a ton of fun (actually almost all Simlish songs are)! The original is great and Simlish adds flavour to the track too. 

Also, this is the highest score any version of Katy's Last Friday Night has gotten (also the only one to get over 7.000)

# Dwam

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Here’s how Katy Perry can make a comeback.

**astrologicalangel** (10): excellence in gaming right here

**bbfan132** (10): yes.

**Chevsapher** (10): Dwam Kurty, yor borbees!

**endcreditouilles** (10): me when i'm trying to sing along to the radio but i don't remember the lyrics

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Let’s get Katy Perry a rate win in 2021, we don’t know if she’ll ever get another. She released “Electric” after the eligibility period for this rate had ended because she knew it would flop :(

**ignitethephoenix** (10): why is the bonus rate better than the main rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292042312958083075/846248369294147605/image0.gif also this seems like the obvious winner

**LesApfels** (10): Dukwey ah da kweb!

**ManofOranges** (10): The original song is a 10 and this is a 10, nothing's changed.

**plastichaxan** (10): you mean lass frooby noo

**Qwilphish** (10): the video of her recording this version lives in my head rent free

**RandomHypnotica** (10): is it bad that i barely notice most simlish songs aren't in english?

**rslashpoopheads** (10): the joke is on you, I pay no attention to lyrics so I didn't even notice this wasn't the original

**shhhneak** (10): TOWA SOOSHKA NEEBA FAY

**skargardin** (10): simlish rate WHEN

**slimboyfriend** (10): she's never sounded better

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): iconic

**BoneStreetSand** (9.1): Not a 10 because I bought the Sweet Treats expansion and I still feel deeply ashamed.

**kirby31200** (9): Still better lyrics than anything on Smile

**Parkouricus** (9): dwam ;OO

**Raxxin** (9): when she said yarby dansel dable doops imi dooka mimi shoops sipi gibsy a fergoop i felt that

**stryxen** (9): this is my go-to video to play on discord music bots

**UltimateDomon** (9): I had no idea this existed but I now fully support Katy Perry's comeback out of respect for her somehow managing to record this

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): tbh it took me a full minute to realize something was different

**turtle\_on\_mars** (8.5): dwam this is good

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**Brendon-Urine** (8): spittin facts

**celladonn** (8): dwam

**sarcasticsobs** (8): this is gonna win the bonus rate, isn’t it?

**seanderlust** (8): (Kenny G.)

**welcome2thejam** (8): Dwam.

**nooodisaster** (7): "Oh welb" When I accidentally burn my 3rd Sim alive.

**RetrohTanner** (7): Dwam... this is kinda genius

# Flerby

**NFLfreak98** (6.5): Hooba dooba froopy doo indeed

**akanewasright** (6): Is this song essentially top tier pop? Yes. Does she commit hard enough? No.

**EnCaine** (6): i never really liked this one. The simlish version is an improvement tho!

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (5.5): i don't really know what to do with the fact that the first autocomplete result for "last friday night" searched from korea gives you a cover spliced together from audio clips by a late korean ex-president this is honestly pretty charming, and i love the absolute confidence of "DWAM" (dwam? did you just say dwam?). hope i never hear it again

**nt96** (5): lol no

**steelstepladder** (5): Cute but, definitely the least of all the bonus rate songs

**fadedblue09** (3): My least favorite TD single and no matter what version I will never like it.

**cyborglilith** (1): this is the only bonus song I rated

IT'S TRICKY

So glad this one won, even though I gave most of them a 10. We really need to rate this in proper someday and when we do, it might even get my 11. It's such a classic bop that flows perfectly.

---

# It's Tricky!

**1998tweety** (10): this 100% deserves to win the bonus rate

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a whole bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this goes OFF like a nuke, underrated party song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a tiktok SMASH

**kirby31200** (10): I went to work after doing this rate and had this song stuck in my head the entire shift

**nt96** (10): This will forever be a timeless classic.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (10): aw this always makes me smile

**RandomHypnotica** (10): IT'S TRICKY TO ROCK A RHYME, TO ROCK A RHYME, THAT'S RIGHT ON TIME IT'S TRICKY!

**ReallyCreative** (10): an 11 if it were in the main rate, lets be honest

**Roxieloxie** (10): I dont know if we have rated this before in a main rate but it deserves to be a main rate winner

**skargardin** (10): omg I just got the biggest flashbacks to playing SSX!! Even disregarding the use in the game this is one big bop

**bbfan132** (9): classic

**Chevsapher** (8.8): This is so, so fun.

**Parkouricus** (8.5): REVIVE THE SSX SERIES

**cheatviathan** (8): I mean, the first game soundtrack that comes to my mind when I think of this is Forza Horizon 3, but you do you, I guess.

**seanderlust** (8): is that penn and teller in the mv

**steelstepladder** (8): TRICKY TRICKY TRICKY TRICKY

**shhhneak** (7.9): THEY TOOK MY CHANGE!

**UltimateDomon** (7): This is fun to listen to every once in a while

# Combo breaker

**plastichaxan** (6.5): idk how to rate this

**RetrohTanner** (5): I love the trappings of early rap from the 80s. Rhyming curly with girly. Bragging about not doing drugs

I want everyone to take a quick look at that rank graph first. Yep, this was the only other track besides Putt Putt to sit in last place. And here it is in the top 6. Its climb has been a slow one, but it made it up to the top eventually. For the song, this is miles better than anything on ALL OUT. It packs a punch, it's got a great rhythm, and the visuals for the MV are spectacular. K/DA might have flopped in the EP rate, but they brought it all back together here.

---

# Challengers

**ignitethephoenix** (11): HERES HOW K/DA CAN STILL WIN THE EP RATE

**SFbby** (11): How does K/DA have a lightstick before some kpop groups??? Also though this song is a major bop and I would be a-ok with Riot doing music full-time

**agentofscranton** (10): the best song in each of these artist's discographies

**AHSWeeknd** (10): absolutely snapped.

**Awkward\_King** (10): me when im a bad bitch and im in a video game but im a bad bitch

**cremeebrulee** (10): this would’ve demolished the ep rate

**CrimsonROSET** (10): now WHERE was this in the EP

**cyborglilith** (10): yasuo is my cumdump

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): Madison and particularly Soyeon are the highlights on the track for me but everyone does a great job.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Would have been top 10 in the EP rate.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I will never get over how incredible this fake band is. Soyeon's verse took no prisoners, absolute killer.

**hikkaru** (10): let's not do this dirty like we did them in the ep rate…

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a cultural reset. A popheads chart smash, not every artist has that to their credit.

**ManofOranges** (10): My mind continues to be boggled by the idea that there is a group consisting of League of Legends characters making pop songs. It's just so... weird.

**nooodisaster** (10): Riot wanted to save their sales, but they ended up saving pop.

**Parkouricus** (10): just no words for the size of this banger. impeccable. unmatched. actually absurd

**PhloxInvar** (10): Defined an entire era of LOL. It’s their most viewed video ever and rightfully so. The concept of an “idol k-pop” LOL song is such a wild thing, but they managed it incredibly well. All corporate of course, but there was a lot more effort put into this one music video than some k-pop promotions. The music video really sold the song to many people. This song and the era of POP/STARS just did so many things right. They really just dropped the ball for the follow-up, but K/DA had the perfect debut.

**Qwilphish** (10): kpoppers rise up! justice for k/da in the ep rate. on an actual rate note: one of the best pop songs not to mention video game music of recent years

**RetrohTanner** (10): Coolest video in the rate award

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**runaway3212** (10): I love the slow build towards 'WERE POPSTARS!!!!' it's so good

**seanderlust** (10): if more of ALL OUT had sounded like this i would have rated that EP a lot higher. this song strives to be a banger and, crucially, at no point lets up.

**skargardin** (10): we all make choices, but not putting this smash on the ep was definitely a choice

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i guess this would be a boring winner but i've never streamed this before and this fucking slaps? wtf

**wavingwolves** (10): look it's her... the best k/da song

**akanewasright** (9.5): This is better than most of that EP lmao

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): definitely K/DA's best offering

**1998tweety** (9): this is without a doubt a big bop, but it also feels a bit out of place in this rate and I can't exactly explain why. Its good and I'm giving it a good score, but I dont want it to win cause it would be a boring winner.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): After the EP rate I got sick of K/DA even though I rated ALL OUT so highly - I'm sure that'll happen here as well, but for now, this shmacks.

**fadedblue09** (9): I have mixed feelings on K/DA representing kpop in certain areas, but I can't deny how well executed they are

**NFLfreak98** (9): They actually just made a bop so

**plastichaxan** (9): um where was this quality on the ep

**waluigiest** (9): interesting how different rate contexts really affect my perception of K/DA

**Chevsapher** (8.6): I wasn't impressed at the beginning, but that chorus brought me around real quick. The production is delicious.

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): I swear this went harder back in 2018

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): [Just gonna copy and paste my writeup from the Jukebox (RIP):](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9yzpdf/the_popheads_jukebox_week_93_song_submissions_open/ea5aq4v/) This song is a lot like League in that it's flashy and maximalist, it just kind of blasts over you and it has no right to be as much fun as it is. They just fricking threw everything at this track, two separate features and then an entire Kpop group on top of that, and it worked. The Akali rap verse (not sure who's doing it) absolutely steals the show but Jaira and Madison are putting in the work too, the way they slam those high notes at the end of the chorus is actually thrilling. The song is loud and it would almost be a wall of noise, but there's a surprising amount of restraint displayed, with the song always pulling back right before it becomes overwhelming or obnoxious. It's by far the best Worlds song League has released. The song is a little weaker without the video, but then it's emulating Kpop which is a visual medium anyways so that's acceptable. My biggest complaint is that the song just kind of like... ends. It builds a lot of nice energy over the course of the bridge and then it's just like, done. But I always say that if my biggest complaint is that I wanted it to be longer, then they must have done something right.

**kirby31200** (8.5): Have you lived until you've played this on Expert+ in Beat Saber

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): if this was in the EP Rate it would've been an easy 10. Unfortunately, it has a LOT more competition here

**BebeLuigi** (8): Soyeon is great on the track

**BoneStreetSand** (8): Surprised that I liked this.

**LesApfels** (8): Queens of getting people to buy skins

**Roxieloxie** (8): oh hey k/da we thought you were dead

**welcome2thejam** (8): Go ahead. Bonk me. I know my crimes.

**stryxen** (7.9): more like FAD/FLOPS Jinx outsold

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7): k/da is incredibly stupid as a concept. kind of brutally funny that not even superpowered gladiators duking it out in the arena of the gods or whatever are immune from being conscripted to shake ass for the plebs. like come on now, you're not pop/stars, you're murderers. slaps tho

# Bronze

**bbfan132** (6.5): not super interesting but fun

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Pretty okay Kpop. It needs a stronger chorus.

**cheatviathan** (6): My friends at my college’s gaming club talk about this track as if it were banger incarnate, but it just kinda exists. Maybe if I were more well-versed in both k-pop and League, my impressions would be different. It’s somewhat entertaining while it’s on, but not one I’d actively choose to listen to.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): uhhh gonna be honest I’m not a fan of this kind of kpop music…

**UltimateDomon** (5): Not my thing

**pietrohonkhonk** (4.5): I really don’t get the hype for this song sorry :/

**EnCaine** (0): i dislike k/da conceptually and this is annoying. I also just don't like music that sounds like this in general.

**luckyphase** (0): it's cringey and I had a zero available sooo...

And now we say bye to Persona! This was a front runner for most of the rate, but just couldn't quite get the win. Still, top 5 is an amazing spot to be.

This is a full bop! I mean, most of the persona tracks are but this takes it to another level. I have no idea if this game is good (from what I've heard it wasn't) but it was worth it to get this at least. 

---

# Dancing All Night

**CrimsonROSET** (11): do the slut drop yosuke just do it

**Awkward\_King** (10): SO TRUE

**bbfan132** (10): i love this <3 the piano is an extra lovely touch

**cremeebrulee** (10): bop!!!!

**endcreditouilles** (10): there's a synth in this that sounds like my cat crying so i keep pausing this to check on her. Still a major vibe tho

**Qwilphish** (10): DANCE! SO. MUCH. FUN.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): there is a LOT of flaws with P4D, but this song makes me willing to forgive it all. It's one of the catchiest, funnest pop songs i've ever heard, the production is incredibly tight and it's just SO good

**seanderlust** (10): this was very nearly my 11 and if it wins I will be quite happy

**waluigiest** (10): it hits an incredible groove

**welcome2thejam** (10): Absolute megaton bop of the highest caliber. The sheer power of this song to make me want to play a rhythm game spinoff to a JPRG I've never played

**BebeLuigi** (9): Easily one of Persona's best vocal track, the rap parts really sells it

**bigbigbee** (9): why don't mind if i do

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): omg this feels like the opening to an old spy movie but with retro-future spacey vibes

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (9): bop!

**runaway3212** (9): I could totally see myself dancing to this all night that's how catchy it is

**stryxen** (9): now this is a SONG

**UltimateDomon** (9): I never played this cause I suck at rhythm games but this song rules

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I like this a lot! So groovy

**Chevsapher** (8.7): This is groovy! That bassline is immaculate, and the eurodance-style rap is a clever touch.

**1998tweety** (8): she bops a bit

**cheatviathan** (8): This is a bop. A fitting opener to the rhythm game spinoff of The Persona 4. I like the bells that come in right before the second verse, that bassline is groove personified, Shihoko Hirata and Lotus Juice play off of each other well, and it’s just a fun song overall.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this kylie minogue song title

**nooodisaster** (8): Okay this is actually a serve....

**Parkouricus** (8): oh hey this is pretty groovy! kind of can't believe this game exists but love it

**RetrohTanner** (8): Stan main pop girl Rise Kujikawa

**rslashpoopheads** (8): we groovin

**skargardin** (8): This is kind of giving a TWICE b-side

**steelstepladder** (8): A bop but kinda outclassed by the other persona songs

**wavingwolves** (8): i don't know the first thing about this game but this is massive bop

# Watching TV

**fadedblue09** (7.5): An okay song, lyrics are kinda pretentious though

**Alumineous** (7): VitaminWater marketing team could NEVER.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7): I like the female vocals a lot hut j don’t care for instrumentals/production choices

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): elevator music

**pig-serpent** (6): It has a nice groove but that's about it.

**ReallyCreative** (5): it feels like a parody of dance music but with just the slightest tinge of Adderall

**2dina3dworld** (4): the use of “special friends” is such a santisied version of “fuckbuddies”

**AHSWeeknd** (3): is this disco?

I never heard this song before it was suggested but I'm so glad it was (see Ghost's comment). Probably my favourite discovery of the rate! Everything about the track is amazing and so sleek. AND THAT SAX! And now I really want to play the game (honestly probably gonna get after this is all said and done)

---

# In paradise

**cremeebrulee** (11): this was such a pleasant surprise!! i really liked the beginning but when the saxophone came in, it just made sense to up this to an 11. also a minor thing, but i turn 25 in a couple of months and i think this would be a lovely song to play then because my other option was a mitski one and this is definitely more celebratory sdksdkj

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I basically bullied the host into including this in the rate (don’t worry I had help) so I figured it would make the most sense as my 11. This is one of the best video games I’ve played in *years* and the sheer style of it was a big part of that, the 3D ‘80s retro futuristic urban environment populated by stylish 2D characters was so cool and then the soundtrack just took it over the edge. I’m not usually a huge fan of synth wave but they nailed it on the head and really captured the appeal of vaporwave and plastic soul, it gets you right into the sexy drama and intrigue of this world. This is the only vocal song in the game but the instrumental version is featured heavily throughout the rest of the game (it’s the title screen track) so when you finally hear it at the end of the game it’s just such an “I did that” moment. The music slaps, the vocalist kills it, the saxophonist kills it… what else is there to say but “wig?”

**seanderlust** (11): you know that tiktok where the guy is listening to strangers like me by phil collins and he says "phil, this is for a children's movie. you don't have to go that hard." very that

**agentofscranton** (10): this was so good i'm buying this game purely because of this

**akanewasright** (10): me when I’m a killer in paradise (and when I stay forever)

**anothertown** (10): hmmmmm maybe i will play this when i finish ace attorney in 10,000 years

**BebeLuigi** (10): I wasn't expecting this??? I love city pop and definitely love, that woman voice is great too

**endcreditouilles** (10): this sax solo!!!! that sax player has had sex for sure, there's no way a virgin played this

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow what a serve! Sounds really sophisticated in a good way!

**PhloxInvar** (10): Hot damn, two amazing instrumental breaks give the perfect variation in between the bridge, all the while having a great chorus and good verses. Reminds me of Yukika actually.

**Qwilphish** (10): if you havent played paradise killer and if you like exploration / murder mysteries, do yourself and play it. SO FUN. this song is so amazing and is a perfect summarizer of the game's vibe

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok i feel like i'm indebted to give this a 10 given my pfp, but it truly is such a great song (and honestly the whole soundtrack is phenomenal, it matches the aesthetic of the game perfectly and it's just bop to bop.

**Roxieloxie** (10): why is this so GOOD what the FUCK. Idk what this game is or even whats going on but this absolutely fucks

**steelstepladder** (10): OMG THE SAX??? I've never played this game but I really should

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This sub is gonna eat this one up huh? It’s ok, me too

**welcome2thejam** (10): Immediately looking into this game purely off the strength of this track, yowza this is good

**1998tweety** (9): this is groovy

**Brendon-Urine** (9): the saxophone solo <3

**hikkaru** (9): SAX SOLO!!!!! I'M NUTTING!!

**ignitethephoenix** (9): who gave this the right to slap so hard

**skargardin** (9): Oooh now this is excellent! The sax solo really is everything! I've heard so many good things about this game and its soundtrack, maybe it's finally time to check it out!

**waluigiest** (9): the instrumental sounds a bit like Wham

**Chevsapher** (8.9): Ugh, that bridge! So good.

**bbfan132** (8.5): fun!!!!

**celladonn** (8.5): Bop and this game is so good

**Parkouricus** (8.5): who is the person in the black hat? they're really hot please say they're not a murderer

**Alumineous** (8): I'm getting Zero Escape vibes from this YouTube graphic. Like, the person in the middle is Mira, the one on the right middle is K, second from the left is Carlos, second from the right is Clover. And the song is good.

**EnCaine** (8): midnight city is shaking at this sax

**ImADudeDuh** (8): did she just say she never liked this song? The lack of taste

**luckyphase** (8): sample song from the yamaha psr 170 keyboard vibes

**nooodisaster** (8): I didn't expect anything but ended up really liking it

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (8): i have a weakness for both jazzy tracks and songs that aren't afraid of explicitly referencing the games they were written for, and this manages to be fun and wistfully moody at the same time. love the aesthetic.

**pig-serpent** (8): Oh this vibes.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a little unbridled but it's a bop

**RetrohTanner** (8): I had never heard of this game before but this song is great and the character designs look so fun

**runaway3212** (8): a bit repetitive but I love the sax solo

**shhhneak** (7.8): absolutely have time for this saxophone solo!

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I'm still vibing

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This could have been an actual hit in 1986

**UltimateDomon** (7.5): Never heard of this but it's pretty nice

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the sax went off. Is it a sax? Maybe a trombone. Probably a trumpet.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): living my best live thriving

**LesApfels** (7): Ok but Yuri can get it

# Never liked this song

**cheatviathan** (6): Elevator jazz-fusion? My favorite. Nothing remarkable about it aside from an okay sax solo and a decent vocal performance

**stryxen** (6): good but forgettable

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): that sax do be going hard

# Superstars

**EnCaine** (11): there was never any doubt which main pop girl was getting my 11

**hikkaru** (11): YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS PAULINE SLAY THE HOUSE DOWN BOOTS MAWMA!!! MAIN POP GIRL SHIT

**lolcevan** (11): PAULINE IS A MAIN POP GIRL WBK!!!

**Roxieloxie** (11): I LOVE THIS GAME I LOVE THIS SONG. Im conflicted on if i should 11 this again after doing it in charity 2 but I truly do just love it plus i finally 'completed' the game so i just have so much love for it

**TragicKingdom1** (11): its the smasha...i had this on repeat that e3 when they unveiled the song

**agentofscranton** (10): pauline the true main pop girl of the mushroom kingdom. peach could never. daisy found wilting. rosalina and her lumas falling into a black hole.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Snapped, unlike the sonic soundtrack.

**akanewasright** (10): Literally this playing at end of the level it’s in is such a lovely payoff. You do all those little tasks, save the city twice, and then you get this joyous number as you go through a stage as pixilated Mario. The song is just pure happiness and cheese and all things good and Mario with the world.

**alexpiercey** (10): No joke, I literally cry every time I play this bit ingame

**bbfan132** (10): i had so much fun playing this last year <3

**cheatviathan** (10): God, electing not to give this my 11 was the most painful decision of the rate. Here we have a jazzy number that perfectly captures the sense of wonder and exuberance of the game it’s a part of. This is a song where the singer somehow manages to make the line “I’ll be your 1-up girl” not sound cringe by completely owning it. Couple that with a key change that takes it over the top, and we have something special on our hands.

**cremeebrulee** (10): fuck /u/RandomHypnotica idk what he gave this song but he prob deserves it

**endcreditouilles** (10): Nintendo still knows how to make an instant classic of a game. Pauline is THE main pop girl

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I forever think of the time u/kappyko gave this a 1 and was then told “society will celebrate your demise”

**kirby31200** (10): The part where this plays in-game is one of the most magical recent experiences in gaming

**ManofOranges** (10): MASTERPIECE

**nooodisaster** (10): ICONIC CHANGED MY LIFE

**Parkouricus** (10): they must've put crack in this song because literally every second is a hook

**Qwilphish** (10): shes a legend shes an icon and she IS the moment

**steelstepladder** (10): We love mario

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Just a great big burning bundle of audible joy and happiness that perfectly represents the Mario series, and the fun and wonder of playing video games as a whole!

**waluigiest** (10): Nintendo put their everything into this song

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh Mario Mario, you've done it again!

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Super Mario Odyssey singlehandedly changed my opinion on "react" content. I always found it to be kind of low effort until I somehow stumbled across someone reacting to the Super Mario Odyssey second trailer (the one that introduced this song)...and I was hooked. It's just fun to watch people getting excited about stuff that you yourself love. On that day I think I watched upwards of 30 "Mario Odyssey Trailer Reaction!" videos, and as a consequence, I heard this song a lot. And it grew on me! It's just fun.

**PhloxInvar** (9.5): God, I know it’s a glorified Nintendo/Mario advertisement song, but it is supremely enjoyable. The lyrics don’t bother me in the slightest, and it’s just incredibly fun.

**wavingwolves** (9.3): detonating the yass grenade

**1998tweety** (9): BAWP

**CrimsonROSET** (9): should’ve been on the redemption rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I’m just gonna say it… Mario Odyssey was good but not as good as everyone said it was. The “you can be anything!” gimmick was massively overstated, you often only have only one or two specific options for any given situation and while you’re given flexibility on the order that you collect the moons you’re actually railroaded into doing most of them in very specific ways so it’s not like you have that much freedom. This song/scene is iconic though, regardless of my feelings about the actual gameplay the Mario universe is always resplendent with fun and you can really hear that radiating out here.

**nt96** (9): This is one of those songs that puts a smile on your face. You can even hear the singer smiling.

**seanderlust** (9): oh I love this! the big band feel is so fun. you can tell the singer is having fun with this number too

**UltimateDomon** (9): I wish this song had better lyrics cause otherwise its perfect

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The big band sound was a great choice, and the lyrics have just the right amount of cheese.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): still a major bop (also I really need to finish the game)

**shhhneak** (8.8): Now why isn’t Pauline in every Smash Bros/Mario Kart/Mario Party? We need girl boss representation @Nintendo.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): feel like pure shit just want to be someone's superstar nrs

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Very Broadway-flavored and carefree-sounding

**stryxen** (8.4): the only part i don’t like is odyssey yasee but the rest is genuinely perfect

**BebeLuigi** (8): Love it, go Mario go

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (8): jazzy

**pig-serpent** (8): I hope every Mario soundtrack has a peppy throwback jazz song in the soundtrack from now on.

**ReallyCreative** (8): overrated but Pauline served vocals

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I really regret how much time I spent 100%ing this game speaking of which FUCK THE JUMP ROPE IM GONNA STRANGLE U BITCHES

**runaway3212** (8): Pauline main pop girl

# Bowser's minions

**skargardin** (7): This is good but nothing more

**Alumineous** (2): I don't like it. I actually destined for this to be my least favourite song going into this rate. And I actually own and completed the game! This is not Nintendo's forte. I mean, just look at BoTW's voice acting. When one of the best Mario themes, Fossil Falls, is in the game, this fails so hard as a vocal attempt of a Gusty Garden Galaxy. Or TLoZ Theme. Or Ballad of the Goddess. This mediocre song marks the climax of a phenomenal game? Just no. And ugh, the word 'odyssey' doesn't work in this damn song, or ANY song. Sorry, Nintendo. Maybe next time?

**RandomHypnotica** (0): i gave this a 0 in Charity Rate 2 and i still stand by it. This song feels extremely generic and overrated, which just intensifies my dislike of it.

Iconic. What more is there to say? While this was never in the leader spot it really swept up this rate by never leaving the top 5. I mentioned that I liked Portal 2 better but again this is still a solid 10! GLaDoS deserves main pop girl status!

---

# A Triumph

**agentofscranton** (11): obvious 11 is obvious, but glados is an icon and I need her to sit beside the likes of gaga, kylie, beyonce, and madonna in the popheads hall of fame

**Brendon-Urine** (11): so fake gamer moment - I know this song from it being on Rock Band, not Portal. I went on to play the Portal games and enjoyed them, but before that little 11 year old me fucked with this song HEAVY on rock band. It seriously holds up even now, just as a standalone song. GLaDOS is absolutely a main pop girl

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): This is just too iconic to miss out on my 11, sorry, Jinx!

**ManofOranges** (11): This song is just pure beauty to me. The portal games, all 2 of them, are perfection to me and this song was an utterly fantastic way to end the first game.

**nooodisaster** (11): Literally was my most listened to song on iTunes at one point. Probably the most iconic song here, and imo the best.

**plastichaxan** (11): why did the first seconds make me think i was listening to emily montes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): The PC Music-print. “But there's no sense crying over every mistake, you just keep on trying till you run out of cake” is evergreen advice, honestly.

**stryxen** (11): literally just one of my favourite songs ever and i’m feeling brave enough to call this one of the best art pop (no its true) songs of all time

**1998tweety** (10): this has no right being a 10 but here we are

**akanewasright** (10): I love both the portal songs for completely different reasons. This one is just so goddamn blunt. It’s exactly in character for what we know about GLaDOS in this game, it’s a lovely addendum that lets you know she survived - ha ha, and it just bops. It’s an easy pleasure imo, but my god what a pleasure it is

**Awkward\_King** (10): might fuck abt and play this at my ~~wedding~~ funeral

**bigbigbee** (10): Despite being a Certified Nerd in high school I somehow made it to this year without ever hearing this song...boy was I missing out. This is absolutely fantastic; clever lyrics, great production, and somehow kind of moving despite its ostensibly jokey subject matter.

**Chevsapher** (10): Top-notch melodies, Top-notch songwriting. This song was the only reason I played Portal, and I'm so glad I did.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is THE video game song, in my opinion. Like, when you think iconic, this is the one.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love this game so much

**fadedblue09** (10): Legit empowering and gives off this triumphant feeling. God lemme replay Portal sometime soon

**ImADudeDuh** (10): main pop robot GLaDOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**LesApfels** (10): Stan GLaDOS or perish

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (10): i have a soft spot for songs that sound sweet and innocent but have menace lurking underneath the surface, and jonathan coulton's lyrics are always a ton of fun.

**Parkouricus** (10): still very interested in the battle of the Still Alives!! this one is my favourite in terms of sheer vibes and meaning, something about it tugs at the heartstrings in a really mystical way!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is for y'all that live for rate trauma comments. Ok so, not long after i discovered Portal, it was also around the time i started using the internet, and i also found out dubstep existed. I didn't have a very broad sense of music, and this song was one of my favourites at the time, so i decided to search for some Still Alive dubstep and could only find one video on YouTube. The video was using footage from a japanese horror film and was VERY gory and intense. It including such scenes as (TW: Gore) >!a woman deepfrying and eating her own hand, another stabbing things through her skin constantly, and most scarring of all, a woman sticking a butterknife into her eyeball, pulling the eyeball out and eating it!< It scarred me for a LONG time and turned me off this song. Anyway, this is super cute and iconic haha

**runaway3212** (10): I love Hannah Diamond

**shhhneak** (10): I’m ‘downloaded this from Limewire onto my MP3 player’ years old.

**skargardin** (10): main pop girl GLaDOS yasss

**steelstepladder** (10): Maybe the first song I think of when I think of Video Game Vocal music

**waluigiest** (10): this has always been so beautiful

**welcome2thejam** (10): The rate is a lie

**celladonn** (9.9): A classic for a reason

**EnCaine** (9): i remember wasting so much time trying to get this to play on the jukebox in left 4 dead 2

**hikkaru** (9): glados main pop girl

**nt96** (9): A perfect balance of robotic tenderness and dark humor

**PhloxInvar** (9): The verses are amazing, and it’s so fun to sing the entire song. THS WAS A TRIUMPH.

**Roxieloxie** (9): yeah im a gamer i watched matpad vids about portal in 2013

**seanderlust** (9): this is cute but also the "i feel fantastic" bit reminded me of that youtube video which absolutely triggered my fight or flight response

**bbfan132** (8.5): i totally forgot that this existed rip

**UltimateDomon** (8.5): Main pop girl Glados

**BoneStreetSand** (8.3): I'm a little scared, but also a little turned on.

**2dina3dworld** (8): Okay, my original comment was “the singer of this song needs therapy”. Turns out, the singer is a murderous robot, and I stand by my previous statement

**luckyphase** (8): 😌

**pig-serpent** (8): I used to love this song but it feels like a representation of the juvinile nerd pride that was popular in that era and it's a part of me I like to leave behind.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's overrated but the superior Still Alive of this rate

**slimboyfriend** (8): sad indie girl but make it a robot

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): mom pick me up im scared

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I remember all the memes and I cringe… but it’s not the song’s fault

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The “vocals” and production for this one are great but the melody isn’t anything that special.

**cheatviathan** (7): It’s a solid enough ending to one of my favorite games of all time, but not something I’d go back to outside of that context. The lyrics are darkly humorous, and the robotic vocals do add an unsettling edge to it, but the pop rock instrumentation does nothing for me.

**Qwilphish** (7): glados is THAT bitch.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): vewwy kyoot >__< -^

**BebeLuigi** (6): It's lovely

# The cake is a lie

**cremeebrulee** (6): i think maybe playing this game will make it more … sentimental to me? i’m sorry but i don't really like this otherwise jdfhsjd

**anothertown** (5): so this is how the greasy mf jonathan coulton got his comeup? the industrial revolution and its consequences....

**AHSWeeknd** (4): This was made for portal??

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I feel like this is better in the context of the game then as an actual song

RATE WINNER UTADA! And here I thought a grab bag would give a close rate winner. This was never really a contest for the other songs. For nearly the entire rate Utada had the lead. Early on it was only by about 5-6 points, but after 40 or so ballots their lead became unpassable. 

Fun fact, this song (or this version) wasn't originally supposed to be in the rate! It was going to be the opening version of the track instead! However, through the voting it seemed more people were eager to rate this one (though the other also had its fans) so they were switched. Wonder how the other would've done... Who knows, maybe there's an alternate timeline where we had Still Alive as the winner?

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): one of the best songs here

**akanewasright** (11): i may be an Utada stan, but this just a fucking brilliant song. I think these are my favorite lyrics Utada has done in English, for one. But also it’s a great example of how they're able to write in Japanese and English perfectly. The chorus of this version of the song is very different from the Japanese version, and it works perfectly for both versions. This will probably suffer from mild balladphobia, but it deserves and Hikki deserves

**anothertown** (11): Utada wrote and coproduced this when they were 18/19??????

**BoneStreetSand** (11): The song of my childhood. Got this game when I was four years old, so I feel like I've been in a long-term relationship with this song my whole life. Started crying when I remembered how much I love it. Their voice is so lovely here.

**CaptainDaisyG** (11): This was obvious to me and should be to you, too.

**jayjaysortagay** (11): this is from my boyfriend's favourite video game and I gave him a custom music box that plays this song 🥺🥺

**luckyphase** (11): including this isn't fair to the rest of the songs

**Marshynarsh** (11): As my first try into playing a jrpg this was quite the opening scene!

**RetrohTanner** (11): This song is about a teenager with huge feet from the Final Fantasy/ Disney crossover game and his relationship with an equally big footed girl who's soul accidentally got bonded to him, and it's maybe one of the most romantic things ever written

**shhhneak** (11): HOLD ME WHATEVER LIES BEYOND THIS MORNING IS A LITTLE LATER ON. If the ballad is an eleven then the Birth By Sleep remix is a twelve.

**skargardin** (11): How do I put this into words even... I just love this song so much. Probably my favorite song ever used in a video game. Simply gorgeous and an absolute classic.

**slimboyfriend** (11): Maybe it's nostalgia, but maybe Utada just knows how to make really good pop songs

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): literally the most iconic song here and it's not even close

**1998tweety** (10): remix version from the game intro > this version > full remix version. this is still an absolute 10 though

**Awkward\_King** (10): :akanebop:

**celladonn** (10): Obviously a mega bop

**Chevsapher** (10): I'm not a fan of the original mix, but I'm giving this track a 10 because the PLANITb remix is one of my favorite songs ever. It's such a perfect blend of interesting songwriting with showstopping production, and it epitomizes the trance-infused turn-of-the-millenium EDM aesthetic.

**cremeebrulee** (10): that little pause in the beginning before the song starts for real? chefs kiss

**cyborglilith** (10): After all these years, I still love this song.

**EnCaine** (10): when you walk away you don't hear me say

**fadedblue09** (10): Undeniable classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): iconic

**kirby31200** (10): Thinking about a Naruto Flash animation I saw on Newgrounds a decade ago with Naruto singing this to Sasuke

**Parkouricus** (10): ridiculously beautiful, way too nostalgic, that extended outro is just there to give you extra time to cry

**Qwilphish** (10): this is THAT song. and even beyond the hype and fame, it truly lives up to all of its expectations PLEEEEEEASE OH BABY

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Utada I'm 23 years of old and i still don't understand, please explain

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**runaway3212** (10): what a banger

**steelstepladder** (10): IS THE WAY THAT YOUR MAKING ME FEEEEEEEL

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i was planning on giving this my 11 going into the rate because it has the most nostalgia for me but the 11 i settled on is just a flawless song

**UltimateDomon** (10): Endless nostalgia, still such a bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I don’t know what any of this has to do with anime disney but it’s still a classic!

**wavingwolves** (10): it's simple and clean how this is a 10

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): if i dont give this a good score /u/akanewasright will stop being my friend

**teenwitches** (9.5): the remix would have been my 11 for sure

**BebeLuigi** (9): Kingdom Hearts is my life really

**CrimsonROSET** (9): me thinking about the kingdom hearts timeline

**ignitethephoenix** (9): love this

**lolcevan** (9): omg i love sawayama!

**ReallyCreative** (9): Simple and Clean just like Utada's vocals here

**seanderlust** (9): HOLD ME!!! WHATEVER LIES BEYOND THIS MORNING!!! IS A LITTLE LATER ON!!!!!!! REGARDLESS OF WARNINGS, THE FUTURE DOESNT SCARE ME AT ALL!!!!!! NOTHING'S LIKE BEFORE BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**LesApfels** (8.5): We should've rated the superior version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=120HFjKPuJ4

**2dina3dworld** (8): a cultural reset

**pig-serpent** (8): I WOUlD describe this song as simple and clean! I like it when song titles are accurate.

**stryxen** (7.8): i’ve never listened to this fully and first time through i thought that pause after the intro was the whole song

**bbfan132** (7): i wanted to like this way more but it kind of felt disjointed at times :/ still pretty good though!

**bigbigbee** (7): I would have loved this song if I'd heard it like 10 years ago but I was a stone cold Kingdom Hearts hater back then and actively avoided anything to do with it. Now I think the song is just fine. I don't really get the hype.

**cheatviathan** (7): It’s good. Nothing noteworthy about it to me lyrically, and the production is very much of its time, but the hook is a monster, and Utada Hikaru’s vocal performance makes up for a lot. I say this having never played a Kingdom Hearts game.

**nyoom (happy nyoom year #6484)** (7): if this wasn't on your middle school playlist don't talk to me

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): People hype this up so much but I’ve honestly never cared for it that much, the lyrical ideas are nice but they’re repetitive and the melody is hard to follow. The production could go harder too but I think that might just be a product of the times.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): simple and [Explicit]

**Alumineous** (6): I feel like this song needs a different singer.

**alexpiercey** (5.5): this does nothing for me

**welcome2thejam** (5): The "Don't you walk away..." chorus is too iconic to ignore, but can't say I love the rest of it

**ManofOranges** (4): I'm just very bored by this one!

**waluigiest** (4): it doesn’t sound like it, but doesn’t it almost sound like an evanescence ballad?

akanewasright: I’m so fucking happy oh my god. 

Now that she’s won a rate, y’all have no choice but to stream Utada’s next project(s) coming soon (she said she had one in English and one in Japanese aaaaaaa)

Thank you so much to Tilt for hosting such a fucking fantastic rate. Every song in the rate, every banner made, every shitpost in plug knocked it out of the park. ~~and of course thank you so much for making the original version of S&F the one in the rate, allowing Utada to win~~

bigbigbee: What an incredible rate - it brought me so much joy! Music is such a big part of my life, but so is gaming (I say, un-coolly), and I think that video game music is special in the stories the songs tell, and the obviously different "sound profile" from what we typically rate on popheads (makes sense. It's not called gameheads). I love niche rates like this and I'm now patiently awaiting video game vocals....

**ALSO**

For all of the recipients of my OC shitposts please know they were out of love sdkdsk. I truly loved getting your ballots as they gave unusual scores to tracks that weren't doing too well (hmmm maybe not Hypnotica's though ❤) I can take em down if wanted! (or if i get copyright struck)

TiltControls: After a long delay the rate stats are finally here! Usually I do them alongside the reveal, but it's pretty difficult if you throw hosting in there too!

Before looking at the songlist I should warn you that the new songs' artist fields are... kind of a mess. I've been planning on integrating a separate 'source' field for media related pieces (would also apply to the previous Disney rate and any future Anime/Cartoon/Movie/Video Game/etc. rates) but I wasn't able to complete it for the rate. So in a month or two those artist fields will clear up and only show the actual people but for now just bear with it! The artist field is missing some known contributors for the song, but at the risk of making things more messy I left them out and only kept the important ones (aka any big names or people credited on streaming platforms)

Anyways, with that spiel out of the way let's see the stats!

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) like always!

# Songs

I'm so glad that Utada pulled off the win with **Simple and Clean**. It was never really close through most of the rate, but still glad to see it come through.

* Simple and Clean's score places it in the top 500 at #417 (note: grabbags tend to have lower scoring and more controversial winners so it's nothing too worrisome). 

* Also this was asked earlier, but **Simple and Clean** has the largest glow up of any winner yet! Last time we rated it was in Charity Rate 1, where it was a day 1 elimination with a sub 7 score. This time around it gained 1.884 points and about 40 places! The previous record holder was **We Belong Together** which scored 1.610 points more in its winning rate compared to its first (A 8.080 in Billboard Year End #1s vs a 9.690 in id 2000's Pop Excellence)

* Also bonus songs are not counted on the boards, but even if they were The Star Wars Kinect Soundtrack's I'm Han Solo still wasn't controversial enough to land on the list (though it is in the top 100 most controversial songs we've done)

# Artists 

Not much update here. I won't be counting the series "artists" in the artist field for ones that have 5+ songs (basically this just applies to Sonic anyways).

* Florence + The Machine, D'Angelo, K/DA, and CHVRCHES all were existing on the songlist before so they're really the only ones to focus on. Average-wise, K/DA went up quite a bit, CHVRCHES went up a tiny bit, D'Angelo went down very slightly, and Florence went down slightly more. None of them had major shifts though. 

* However, D'Angelo does lose his crown for lowest artist controversy (he's still on the list at #4)

* Also of minor note, but Utada currently has 4 songs rated, so by Winner's Rate 3 (or if they end up with a song in a rate earlier), they'll be eligible to be tracked.

# Rates

Not much on the rates side of things. Uhhh... it had the coolest participants ever? Is that something I'm allowed to track? 

# Updates

So as mentioned above I want to try to figure out a way to represent series. I'm also going to try to get a few other fixes out around the same time frame so the rate tool doesn't need to be constantly updated over a few months and can instead just be done once. However this all probably won't be until a few months from now anyways.

# SEE YOU ALL AT BUPR THIS FRIDAY!

Parkouricus: Kind of shocked by the results, but after giving it a bit of thought ultimately just pleasantly surprised! Simple and Clean as a winner was unexpected but BEAUTIFUL, as with a lot of the results - I was REALLY thinking Baba Yetu, and after that at least It's Bugsnax! somewhere in the top 10 - although there were less beautiful moments, like the injustice done to Pollyanna. 😭

Still, this rate has been absurdly fun, had TONS of playlist adds (even a lot of the Day 1 picks have grown on me a ton, like Suteki Da Ne), and gave me something to look forward to over the entire last month which is massive!! Absolutely incredible job as host, u/TiltControls. This has been an amazing rate and made me want to participate in tons more, so.. huge thanks to everyone who was involved! 92 fantastic gamers, indeed. :D
