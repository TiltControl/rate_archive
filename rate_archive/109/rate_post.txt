https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/k5la0w/contemporary_rb_queens_rate_solange_kali_uchis/

Hello everyone! I'm u/brenda_official, and although right now I'm Just A Stranger to you, I'd like to welcome you to the Contemporary R&B Queens Rate! This rate contains 3 exemplary albums from three of the most acclaimed and innovative women in R&B today: Solange, Kali Uchis and Kelela. Each of their albums has a different take on the genre; When I Get Home being more funky, Isolation being more soul-y, and Take Me Apart being more...[Roboticy](https://youtu.be/NpNtJKLTY94)? I really hope you enjoy listening to these albums whether they're favourites of yours, or if it's your first time listening. And if you don't participate, not only will you Feel Like a Fool, but you're also Dead To Me.

# [Solange - When I Get Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_I_Get_Home_(album))

Solange's hugely anticipated follow-up to the modern classic A Seat at the Table, When I Get Home brings together a dream team of the most talented black artists working today (Earl Sweatshirt, Sampha, Playboi Carti, Gucci Mane, Tyler the Creator, Pharrell, just to name a few) to create a beautiful fusion of R&B, jazz, funk and ambient music. The project is also a visual album - a short film, co-directed by Solange herself, accompanies the songs with imagery inspired by Houston, Solange's hometown. I would highly recommend watching this film, especially if it's your first time listening to the album, it's beautiful and it really helps to understand the vibe that Solange is going for.

# [Kali Uchis - Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(Kali_Uchis_album))

Isolation, tracks from which are most commonly found in playlists titled 'vibes' on Spotify, is the debut album from rising superstar Kali Uchis. The name comes from Kali's fear before releasing the project that her music didn't 'correlate with what's trending at the moment', but despite this it's probably the most well-known album out of the three we're rating here.

Tracklist:

1. Body Language
2. Miami
3. [Just A Stranger](https://youtu.be/IUcByj96dUA)

14. Feel Like A Fool
15. Killer

# [Kelela - Take Me Apart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Me_Apart)

After two previous incredible projects (2013's Cut 4 Me Mixtape and 2015's Hallucinogen EP), Kelela smashed into the (almost) mainstream with her debut album Take Me Apart, a stunning display of her innovative, futuristic blend of electronic and R&B music. The album recieved countless accolades from music critics, including a placement at #4 in [Pitchfork's Best of 2017 List](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-50-best-albums-of-2017/?page=5). Maybe that basement can stay after all.

Tracklist:

1. [Frontline](https://youtu.be/l227G1KSWks)
2. Waitin
3. Take Me Apart
4. Enough
5. Jupiter

# Rules:

\- You must give a score to EVERY song in the rate (except for the bonus songs)

\- You must give each song a score between 1 and 10. Decimal points are allowed, but only to ONE decimal place (e.g. 7.2 is ok, 7.25 is not)

\- You can give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11

\- You are encouraged to leave comments about the songs, but they are not mandatory. You can put comments on however many songs you like, there is no limit!

\- Feel free to message me, u/brenda_official if you wish to change your scores or comments :)

\- If there are any ballots that are clearly trying to sabotage one of the artists, they will be excluded from the rate. Sorry

\- There is only one way to format a comment on your submission form:

THE CORRECT WAY

>Better: 0 This song could be better!

THE INCORRECT WAYS

>Turn To Dust: 10: Achoo!

(Please do not add a colon after the number it messes up the score counter!!)

>Things I Imagined: I imagine that I will give this a 7!

(Your score must always be after the title - it's a robot that counts it, not me!)

>Enough: (4) I've had enough.

(Idk why you would do this)

\- You can also leave a comment about the album as a whole, after where it says the album name, like this

>Album: Isolation: You can say that again!
