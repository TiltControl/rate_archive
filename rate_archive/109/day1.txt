**waluigiest** (10): 10 for how this functions as an In My Dreams (Reprise)

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): really like this

**wavingwolves** (8.5): will be done a little dirty bc it's a interlude but it's so good

**seanderlust** (8.3): "that's done, it's over, it's cancelled" - kali about her dreams

**bbfan132** (8): so so relaxing

**ReallyCreative** (8): pleasant, but maybe would be better developed as a full on song?

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**mysario** (6): oh sure, we can rate THIS interlude but not Solange's??? I see you!!!

**skargardin** (6): its ok

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I was listening and I was like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I remember what I just listened to?‚Äù and then I checked and it was an interlude so that checks out

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): Kali's vocals save this for me but imo it's one of the weakest on the album

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Knowing this is probably gunna be a day 1 cut breaks my heart when it's easily one of the album highlights. So, so, gorgeous and the sequence of Beltway, Exit Scott & Sound Of Rain is absolutely immaculate.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): More of an atmosphere than a song, but there's a hypnotizing feel to it that makes it memorable.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): beautiful

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The production is really pretty and memorable.

**wavingwolves** (9): this is so magical

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): This song is a REAL grower. Even if it's pretty simple, I love how ethereal and dreamy this sounds, and the more I listened to it, the higher it's score rose

**bbfan132** (8): i‚Äôm in a dream right now

**skargardin** (8): the instrumentals transport me to another plane

**thunderbird\_14** (8): mood

**twat\_brained** (8): i feel this; it's hard for me to believe I'm worthy of love half the time

**bulforster** (7.5): Very nice late night car ride vibes.

**akanewasright** (6.5): Lovely, but short

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): this is pretty

**waluigiest** (6): it‚Äôs pretty

**1998tweety** (5.5): nonevent [2] but it sounds nicer

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): not a song but at least it‚Äôs a pretty not a song

**Average:** 7.112 **// Total Points:** 426.7 **// Controversy:** 1.779

**bespectacIed** (10): No joke, this is an 11 contender for this rate and my most listened Solange song. There's something so mystical and about its simple repeated hook. Love the hazy synths and that iconic time signature switch

**BiPolarBear17** (10): https://twitter.com/LunarLiqueur/status/1102231274272555008

**hunnybee12** (10): I saw things, i imagined‚Ä¶ so true

**waluigiest** (10): this is the most beautiful theater major warmup I‚Äôve ever heard

**slimboyfriend** (9): I love that this song can sound finished and workshopped at the same time

**wavingwolves** (9): i love the switch up on her delivery in this one, just a great opening

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Perhaps it‚Äôs just because it‚Äôs first so it has my full attention but I think that this is one of the strongest songs on the album! It‚Äôs obviously very memorable (she says that one line so many times you‚Äôd better remember it by the time the song is done lol) and pleasant to listen to. In a theatre class we once did an exercise where we had to repeat the same line over and over again with different intentions and this song kind of reminds me of that, it‚Äôs like a vocal exercise or something. She gets a lot of mileage out of a single line, she presents this line in every single possible way as if it‚Äôs some kind of mantra and if she just figures out the right inflection she can conjure up the things she imagined. It‚Äôs hypnotic in a way.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this intro is so pretty

**1998tweety** (8): pretty tbh

**bbfan132** (8): maybe not the most interesting song but it‚Äôs a pleasant intro and i love the production

**bulforster** (8): The song where the mantra-like repetition works best for me.

**cremeebrulee** (8): kinda coming for charli‚Äôs crown with all this repetiton

**fluviusfluit** (8): She saw the things! She imagined them!

**frogaranaman** (8): imagine!

**Kaylaboe** (7): me when my sleep paralysis demon visits me

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's a very impressive intro mechanically, the key changes are really intricate. Unfortunately, I still don't really like it. I give a couple bonus points for the sheer skill needed to navigate it.

**skargardin** (7): a moodsetter for sure

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I was gonna dismiss this as repetitive and dull, but the outro saved it.

**twat\_brained** (6.4): nobody complain about Charli having repetitive lyrics again

**akanewasright** (6): This isn‚Äôt that much of a ‚Äúsong‚Äù song, but I still like it. Its production is gorgeous

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): frankie at foster's home for imaginary friends be like

**seanderlust** (5.5): when you do mushrooms once and can't shut up about it for like two years

**pat-rickstar** (5): I fully expect this to go out first, the instrumental is nice but not much else to say about it

**ImADudeDuh** (3): those things? Denim chicken.

**bespectacIed** (10): Top 3 song on when i get home. Solange's vocals here are topnotch

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): it's such a delicately produced but gorgeous song, and the perfect intro into Binz

**bbfan132** (9): so dreamy, i love it

**wavingwolves** (8.5): the nod to jodorowsky is very much appreciated

**akanewasright** (7.5): A nice moment

**twat\_brained** (7): I listened to the whole song and still have no idea who Jerrod is I'm not used to thinking about these songs fml

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): A little bit repetitive, and the sudden ending REALLY bothers me

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): stunning vocals

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Didn‚Äôt realize this ended and the next song began

**bulforster** (5.5): I want to like this because it's one of the more fleshed out songs here but the vocal is weirdly dreary.

**bbfan132** (9): such a relaxing closer

**hunnybee12** (9): she just lets her voice shine and it's soo nice

**wavingwolves** (9): my favourite lyrics in this album, just magical

**1998tweety** (8): pretty

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I actually like this one a lot more than some of the tracks that came before it (the slightly disjointed structure works better here, the vocals are lovely, it‚Äôs pleasant sonically) but I wish she‚Äôd brought something stronger for the closer.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): good closer

**ReallyCreative** (8): peaceful closer, but not my favorite track

**seanderlust** (7.2): i'm not sure where to put this as a comment but the interlude that comes before this is my favorite on the album. anyways, love that this comes full circle with "taking on the light"

**twat\_brained** (7.1): me when I first discover a mod wheel on pro tools lol

**bespectacIed** (7): Nice callback to Things I Imagined. I would've wanted a more impactful closer, but the spiritual vibe works well

**BiPolarBear17** (7): Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson's impact

**pat-rickstar** (6.2): Not really a great album closer imo

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): don't really have an opinion on this one

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): something something Katy Perry

**ImADudeDuh** (3): that witness? https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2020-12/120420_ballot_crimes_web.jpg

**bespectacIed** (9): Solange really got carti tyler and sampha in two consecutive tracks wow. I love the piano on this one so much, it is so comforting

**bbfan132** (10): love love love the atmosphere, it‚Äôs super trippy

**bespectacIed** (10): Neo-soul production on classic RnB harmonies and runs ... yup, I am down, down with ya, down with ya

**skargardin** (10): such a bop

**BiPolarBear17** (9.5): The Clique's yelling timber

**seanderlust** (8): the interplay of the different vocal tracks is ear candy

**twat\_brained** (8): disturbed who

**waluigiest** (8): my favorite part is the choppy ‚Äúdown down down down‚Äù

**wavingwolves** (8): this weirdly reminds me of giallo soundtracks but in a way i appreciate

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Intriguing instrumental makes up for an otherwise lacking lyrics

**mysario** (7): accidentally almost gave this my 11 because I thought it was the interlude (this happened several more times in this album)

**bulforster** (6.5): Feels a bit clunky but I'm not too put off because it seems intentional.

**akanewasright** (6): I like it, but it‚Äôs like... not really a full song so much as a really gorgeous sonic idea.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This sounds fine but the fact that she‚Äôs just repeating the same lines over and over doesn‚Äôt really work because she just did that on the last song. The message is nice I guess.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): i get it's an intro but there's only so much repeating i can take. the end of this song, however, is amazing

**1998tweety** (4): dont like the production on this

**fluviusfluit** (4): I wish it had approximately 20 down with yas less than it does

**bespectacIed** (10): THIS IS THE CLOSER OF THE ALBUM PERIOD. I love Altadena but this is an All Night /Formation situation all over again lmao. Bluff is the perfect closer to Kelela's emotional journey in Take Me Apart. I love that after the purposefully pessimistic songs Onanon and Turn to Dust, Bluff is open-ended and slightly hopeful. Though she didn't say it explicitly,  Bluff makes us believe that kelela is finally breaking away from her pattern of doomed relationships and is trying to make it last with this new lover.

**bulforster** (10): This 72 second interlude is better than a lot of people's whole discographies.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is short but I love the sound of it!

**wavingwolves** (9): wonderful

**bbfan132** (8): my least favorite song/interlude on the album and it‚Äôs still an 8‚Ä¶

**pat-rickstar** (8): Now why is this so short hmm

**plastichaxan** (8): too good but too short

**1998tweety** (7): cute interlude [2]

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs brief and simple but I like it

**hunnybee12** (6): strange choice for a penultimate song. it's just kinda there

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): it's just kinda... there

**twat\_brained** (3): this was pointless lets be honest

**fadedblue09** (0): Hopefully no one gets mad at me for this, but I found this sooo pointless and forgettable. The generic trap beats make it stand out from the album for the wrong reasons.

**bespectacIed** (10): What a beautifully-sung track about loneliness and trying to picking yourself up. I love songs that portray depression and disassociation like your head being out in space. If ariana's get well soon did it with lyrics, Jupiter did it with the trance-like, space-y production. Kelela and Romy xx made a 2-minute masterpiece with this one, that I know will be done dirty in this rate just cuz it's short

**seanderlust** (9.7): i had never heard of a jupiter synth but I really like it!

**bbfan132** (9): stunning interlude

**twat\_brained** (8.6): ooh that rain effect is sexy. Reminds me of Tahliah, and I LOVE miss Tahliah

**wavingwolves** (8): love the water sound

**bulforster** (7.5): The only song on the album I don't love, when I found out the lyrics were written separately from the rest of the song it became quite noticeable.

**1998tweety** (7): a cute lil interlude

**ReallyCreative** (7): A pleasant but otherwise unremarkable interlude

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): The soundscape of this track makes me feel like I'm in some sort of dark cave with glowing water

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I kinda missed this.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I don‚Äôt like this one that much, the production feels kind of aimless and I‚Äôm not sure that I get the point. Fortunately it‚Äôs just an interlude though.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): 5.5 my least favourite so far. not bad, just not interesting

**ImADudeDuh** (5): kinda just useless tbh

**bespectacIed** (10): Kelela and her lover are fucking FUCKING. Best booty call song of all time. The line "i could touch myself babe but it's not the same" is such a mood

**bbfan132** (9.5): so so good for an interlude

**bulforster** (9): Those vocalisations at the end are godly.

**wavingwolves** (8): ended both the jonas brothers and abba with this one

**1998tweety** (7.5): sex jam

**twat\_brained** (7.5): look I know she writes lyrics for us to hear but they just fall right to the side for me I don't know if I'm missing something or not

**ReallyCreative** (7): the first song on the album that just kinda feels "there"

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): This isn't bad at all but it's my least favourite on the album, too short and forgettable

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I kinda don‚Äôt get this one? I mean I get what she‚Äôs going for I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as musically/lyrically interesting as the rest of the album is.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Rihanna > ABBA > Jonas Brothers > Kelela

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): doesn't do much for me

**1998tweety** (7.5): decent closer

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): these lyrics hit so hard and the outro is gorgeous

**bulforster** (6.5): These lyrics are heart-wrenching but musically this is a bit weak, especially for the album closer.

**hunnybee12** (6): an underwhelming closer

**skargardin** (6): This doesn't really grab me, it's certainly not bad but kinda there tbh

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I think the album could've ended with Feel Like a Fool, and these lyrics are a little too strange for me

**BlueMetalWave** (5): Least favorite track of the album, could be easily cut.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2.5): the other half of this album sounds like amy winehouse except tired

**seanderlust** (0): i get that this one is an older one of hers, it is just...kind of a boring closer to an otherwise fantastic album

**Awkward\_King** (11): listen this is probably a weird choice for an 11 but it's just... it's stunning, honestly one of my favourite songs ever. i want to get the lyric "i'm the sweetest peach to fall but some don't like peaches at all" tattooed someday i hold it very dear to my heart

**BiPolarBear17** (10): If this dies day 1 just because it's an interlude there will be HELL to pay, easily one of the top 3 tracks off this album and I would KILL to have an even longer version. Both sections on their own are incredible but together it's just other-worldly. Chef's SMOOCH.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): that switch :oprahgif:

**bbfan132** (9): even the interludes are great, she did that

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I too am too fat.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): What‚Äôs the point of making this an interlude but then placing two tracks together so the actual track is the same length as a full song? Whatever, both of these slap but the second half is better, wish it was its own song.

**waluigiest** (9): she is really playing her voice like an INSTRUMENT here

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I don't care for the first part, but absolutely adore the second part.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): this reminds me of frank's sweet life for some reason and i love it

**bespectacIed** (8): that switch

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Wtf was going on in the first minute. The rest is okay tho.

**1998tweety** (6): alright

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): once again, Kali's vocals saving the song

**bbfan132** (10): gucci

**bespectacIed** (10): Almost hypnotic in its simplicity. "Coochie like to slang, coochie like to bang" are words to live by

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): a SONG, this feels at home with the sparse, repetitive style that Solange chose for this project but it‚Äôs still rooted in the sounds/ideas that made *A Seat At The Table* so successful. I wish she‚Äôd been able to keep this balance more consistently because this is nice.

**plastichaxan** (10): the way she serves during that gucci part and honestly this whole track is great

**bigbigbee** (9): This song is really fun and playful. The laugh in her voice and the groovy bass line are nice. Tyler sounds good too; I think you can hear his touch in the production ‚Äì there were times this reminded me of IGOR.

**skargardin** (9): i can already tell that this is gonna be underrated

**waluigiest** (9): I DIDN‚ÄôT WANT TO SOCK HER üß¶üëäüèΩüí• SHE HAD GUCCI ON HER CLEATS üëüüíéüèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I hear twigs again she's good also Gucci's verse is decent

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): she wrote this song for me yas

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Was about the call this boring until the outro happened.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): oh tyler in this yas

**slimboyfriend** (7): Another song that feels like an interlude. But she's having fun!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): Has a really weak start, but manages to pull it together by the end

**cremeebrulee** (6): i like her delivery here its cute but songs about designer brands are not my things lmao

**nootnoot781** (6): why is there youtube music in the interlude after this?

**hunnybee12** (5): feels so much longer than 2:55

**1998tweety** (3): nope
