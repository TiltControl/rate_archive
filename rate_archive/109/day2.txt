**Ghost-Quartet** (11): wish I could find the words to describe how this song makes me feel, this 11 will have to suffice instead

**bbfan132** (10): this feels… icy? idk, it feels cold but it’s so alluring

**bespectacIed** (10): This and Onanon are twin songs in a way that they both describe the disillusionment Kelela has with her relationships, which always seem to end in the same tragic way. Love the lyrics on this one

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.8): YASSSS

**bulforster** (9.5): I need to be in a specific mood (quite depressed!) to get properly into this one but when it hits, it really hits.

**fadedblue09** (9): Less boppy than the previous songs, but that actually makes this more of a standout. The dramatic strings and her vocals make this one of the album's more intimate moments.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**wavingwolves** (8): "everything is problematic, i'm trying my best" celebs on cancel culture

**twat\_brained** (7.4): I know Im hovering around the 7/8 range for this album but its nothing really outside of that for me I have to admit

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): if this wasn't after Onanon i might like it more but it just falls flat

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): one of the best songs on this album and it’s just an intro yup

**bbfan132** (9.5): this production is heavenly

**BiPolarBear17** (9.5): I've always said it's impossible to go wrong with Bossa Nova and Body Language easily cements that statement

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Godney Kali looks so hot in this video

**402man** (9): The opening notes always give me chills

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): -1 point because it repeats the word "closer" over and over and no rate can be safe from this mess.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): uh, yes please

**ReallyCreative** (9): Tropical themed Mario Party minigame music is NEVER a wrong choice

**wavingwolves** (9): as a brazilian i appreciate the heavy bossa nova influence, specially because it's done right

**seanderlust** (8.3): ooh I love this. bossa nova vibes

**Awkward\_King** (8): it's such a heavenly intro i cannot in good conscience score this any lower. JUST COME CLOSER

**bulforster** (8): Appeals to the flautist in me.

**pat-rickstar** (8): Cute little intro

**skargardin** (8): simply gorgeous intro

**slimboyfriend** (8): I feel like Kali's inviting me to a dance

**waluigiest** (8): this flute brings me so much joy

**bespectacIed** (7): a vibrant intro that I wish was a full song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): lovely intro that introduces the sound and theme of the album nicely

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**ImADudeDuh** (5): was it me or were these vocals bad?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): why does it sound like she's singing offkey 💀

**plastichaxan** (10): she has better reggaeton songs but this is still a 10 and a great tease of the bangers she'd make

**seanderlust** (10): bop!

**pat-rickstar** (9.2): This kinda sounds like La Luz off her new album but anyway I love her songs in Spanish even if I have no idea what she's saying

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Will this get robbed because it's not sung in English? Obviously.

**fluviusfluit** (9): No one better disrespect this one because it's all in Spanish

**wavingwolves** (9): the way the part when reykon laughs shows up as "jajaja" on the lyrics is so funny to me and absolutely no reason (bc of course it would)

**bbfan132** (8.5): a total bop

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**fadedblue09** (8): Wish the Latin influences were more pronounced but otherwise a pretty energetic number.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I got really into this halfway through around the time that Reykon comes in (his section is good) but everything before that is kinda a waiting game

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.8): cute but this is where the album begins to fall off

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): it just doesn't stand out compared to the other tracks on this record, there's nothing wrong with it, it just didn't wow me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): such a good beat, always makes me want to dance

**frogaranaman** (6): the sound is good but her vocals are so QUIET then Reykon comes in fucking SHOUTING

**skargardin** (6): this is nice but doesn't leave much of an impression on me

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): i love that she included a spanish song but i've never been massively keen on the production here, i much prefer the direction she went with for sin miedo. i also always forget reykon is on this song somehow

**bespectacIed** (2): I feel dirty rating the only spanish song in the rate a low score but this is so boringggggg. An okay trop pop reggaeton track with so-so lyrics, if this were made by a guy this will not be praised here (but will probably be a global smash)

**redmeatisunhealthy** (0): this felt so out of place in the album

**bbfan132** (10): listening to this at 2:45 am and it feels like i’m drifting off into a dream

**akanewasright** (10): I’m always here for 6/8.

**bespectacIed** (10): Old school motown RnB. Stunning. Amazing. Talented. All those adjectives lady gaga used

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): I love how much the instrumental makes me feel like I'm in a classy airport lounge, and that ending REALLY swells and sounds so beautiful

**skargardin** (9): her vocals are so gorgeous here ugh

**waluigiest** (9): the melody is wonderful

**seanderlust** (8.3): whispering kali, when you're coming down the aisle with snacks be sure to hit him with your cart

**bbfan132** (8): the doo-wop sound is v pleasant

**ImADudeDuh** (8): does anyone else remember that show on discovery kids called Flight 29 Down that was basically just Lost for teens

**wavingwolves** (8): just lovely

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.6): This starts off really promising but the chorus is kinda a letdown

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): She has a way of making her songs sound timeless

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**bulforster** (7): Nice lyrics but not a passionate enough vocal to sell them over such an easygoing instrumental.

**hunnybee12** (7): I loved this song at release but now it’s a too cheesy for me

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): This is a bit of a drag, not gonna lie.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's a nice song with beautiful vocals but it doesn't live up to the expectations the previous two songs set

**Awkward\_King** (5): this was my fave on the album for ages and i still love it like i don't think any song on the album is bad at all i'm just less excited by it than most other songs here

**waluigiest** (11): simply stunning. The vocal runs at the top are beautiful, and the lyrics are incredible. “Dollars never show up on CP Time” plays in my head constantly especially when I’m late lmao

**bespectacIed** (10): such a perfect catchy short song. Good vibes all over. Panda Bear's production>>>

**cremeebrulee** (10): i too want all this

**plastichaxan** (10): the transition from Jerrod to this...Immaculate

**ReallyCreative** (10): delightfully playful R+B duet, thank you ma'am

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): might seem a weird choice but it's my favourite on the album

**bulforster** (9.5): Those harmonies are heavenly.

**twat\_brained** (9): ooh this was cute

**seanderlust** (8.8): the linens line always gets a laugh from me

**bbfan132** (8.5): not the most interesting song but still enjoyed it quite a bit

**pat-rickstar** (8.2): This is too short, I'm just getting into it and then it ends

**bigbigbee** (8): I love short songs normally, but this one feels a little bit short for me. Still really cute and fun though!

**akanewasright** (7.5): Love the transition from the last song

**skargardin** (7): this is great, i only wish it was longer

**wavingwolves** (7): do wish this a bit longer but it's still sweet

**RandomHypnotica** (4.2): This track belongs in the Binz

**1998tweety** (4): nonevent

**fadedblue09** (4): Ehhh this is probably the weakest on the album. Even the interludes were more interesting. The intro was cute tho.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): sounds like someone left the microphone on while Solange was playing a demo in a different room

**RandomHypnotica** (11): This reminds me of The Postal Service in the best way possible

**slimboyfriend** (11): U ever feel like your life is so stressful that you can't wait to fall asleep and live in your dreams for the night? That's what this song is like for me.

**bbfan132** (10): apparently damon albarn co-wrote/produced this??? holy shit

**frogaranaman** (10): I feel like I’m playing a Kirby game, a bit, kind of. the vibe is there

**hunnybee12** (10): her songwriting is a perfect balance between being relatable and being personal

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is like 2 steps away from being a blondie song

**plastichaxan** (10): serotonin

**seanderlust** (10): this is a great song to listen to/rate/dance to while you're actively ignoring the news on the day of the GA Senate race. also, love that gorillaz appears here!

**twat\_brained** (10): more peppy music like this pls I need it

**waluigiest** (10): This song is smooth like butter. It carries the lyrics so well: the song feels like a dream where you can ignore your huge, traumatic problems

**wavingwolves** (10): need me some more kali x damon albarn i fear

**bespectacIed** (9): As a Gorillaz fan this gives me so much buzz

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I like this crunchy budget Disney sound lol, it reminds me of something that Genevieve Artadi would drop

**pat-rickstar** (9): This one has grown on me quite a lot

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): truly the epitome of an indie coming of age song and i'm obsessed with it. though i am the problem, i made a short film that included it and making the film made me super anxious so now i just associate it with that to an extent lololol

**ReallyCreative** (8): a really interesting sonic shift, however, I'm not loving how the vocals work here, overall, it sounds like a generic indie soft rock band from 2011 but it is their most recognizable track that appeared in a smartphone ad and was a staple of dorm room hangouts throughout the 2010s

**skargardin** (8): a vibe

**1998tweety** (7): the ending of this is nice

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): love the chorus

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): a lot of these songs sound like lily allen songs if she recorded them while tired

**fadedblue09** (4): Painfully generic.

**BiPolarBear17** (3): And here we arrive at the only song in the rate I can't seem to get behind no matter how many times I've tried. Feels too much like a Gorillaz song, not enough like a Kali song, and it completely takes me out of the immersion this album puts me under every time I get to it. It sticks out like a sore thumb to me and unfortunately not in a good way.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this sound rarely works to begin with and definitely does not with her, sorry!

---

---

**SideBTrack8** (11): I almost didn't do this rate but then I heard this song and had to do it just to give it my 11. Looking at Kelela's Top Ten Pop Ten this is probably gonna get done dirty (again) but it's so damn good.

**bbfan132** (10): love how psychedelic/heavy the production is

**bespectacIed** (10): Kelela's post-nut clarity lol. The sobriety of this song works as an outro to the super sexual title track. I love that this is the foil to Frontline ... the latter was the "angry" initial breakup, and Enough is the sad breakup song about the shortcomings of their relationship. We love emotional maturity on FKA twigs-esque production!

**ReallyCreative** (10): I keep expecting this album to take the foot off the gas at some point but she's too busy serving Ethereal New Age R+B fusion to notice she's going to pick up an automatic reckless driving charge from going this hard. We have to stan.

**seanderlust** (10): the way someone on Genius commented "this shit fucks me up. mom did that" and I thought they were talking about their traumatic relationship with their mother and weren't just stanning. :skull: anyways, the production on this is absolutely unclockable. it reminds of the PS4 default home screen music, and yes I mean that as a compliment.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this just got better as it went on, it’s hard for a song this long to keep my attention and she got that

**bulforster** (9): I love how disembodied each line feels, more like elements of the mix than a melodic thoughline.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): So dreamy and gorgeous – that final chorus is such a great release.

**1998tweety** (8): this is really pretty

**akanewasright** (8): I love the production on this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): We’ve just come off a run of three very strong tracks and this is also strong, but not *as* strong. The production is a bit overwhelming (though Kelela’s voice is a lighthouse in the fog of noise) and I wish it cut to some of the points a bit faster. Still, when she sings “it’s not enough” and those synths drone behind her it’s such a cinematic moment

**wavingwolves** (8): now this surely is produced by arca

**twat\_brained** (7.7): good but it's starting to feel like filler now

**slimboyfriend** (7): I feel like I'm witnessing every multiverse at once

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this is SO galatic and future-ristic, love this experimental queen

**BlueMetalWave** (5): Could've been a shorter track.

**bbfan132** (10): i’m in a sky full of diamonds right now

**BiPolarBear17** (10): WHEW. If this wasn't up against my most-listened to album of all time this would be SUCH an easy 11 contender, it's my fave Solange track after Cranes In The Sky. The first half is incredible on it's own already but the second half takes it to a whole other dimension.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Pharrell is just such a great producer, this really stands out as the highlight of the album for me, so good

**ReallyCreative** (10): the most memorable song from the album for me

**skargardin** (10): the interpolation, i mean we have to stan

**bespectacIed** (9): so fun and catchy

**waluigiest** (9): it’s hypnotic!!! What a beautiful beat

**wavingwolves** (9): probably the catchiest song in this, love it

**bulforster** (8): Pharrell did his thing here, I just wish I understood what Solange was singing about.

**seanderlust** (8): ahhhh the bey reference! family love.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): v enjoyable, i love how the beat feels bouncy

**twat\_brained** (8): I miss it can it be spring please? And can I have this playing while I strut down the streets?

**slimboyfriend** (7): Zero out of ten, sounds nothing like rain

**1998tweety** (6): this did not remind me of the rain

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): eh

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): the literal sound of rain would have been preferable, my patience with this album is done at this point

**bbfan132** (10): one of the most beautiful songs i’ve heard in a while

**bespectacIed** (10): The most subdued but the most heartwrenching and best lyrics in the album. Kelela and her lover are finally exhausted with this relationship tug of war. They've tried anger, passion, reconciliation, denial, but in the end they know being apart is what's best for them. This shit hurted...

**BiPolarBear17** (10): To my embarrassment, if I rated this album over a year ago or back when the record first dropped this probably would've been my lowest ranking cut. I've always loved it, but it wasn't until half a year ago when I found myself in the EXACT same position she was singing about. All of a sudden Better was hitting me like a gargantuan truck and the lyrics were resonating with me like never before. Crazy to me how over 50 odd listens later, a song from my favourite album of all-time could manage to click with me even MORE so. Kelela's power knows no limit.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I was loving this even before the beat switch happened, and after that it became transcendental.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): simple, but effective. Alright, i just made it to the bridge WOW!!!

**waluigiest** (10): this song is devastating and the incredibly simple, almost acállela instrumentation really adds to that heartbreak. It also works so well at building tension into a powerful bridge and it’s just a super satisfying song

**seanderlust** (9.5): I feel like this is "cool" by gwen stefani's sadder cousin and that is absolutely a compliment.

**1998tweety** (9): im ascending

**bulforster** (9): I always start this song thinking I don't like it that much, but the bridge is outstanding and completely wins me over.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Electronica and r&b are two genres that I think tend to make the definition of a “ballad” pretty blurry because they tend to have lots of songs that are slow and searing without really being what we’d think of as a ballad, but this is a damn good ballad. The lyrics are emotionally honest (there’s such cutting simplicity to the chorus) and Kelela sounds like she’s pouring her soul out, and the beat switch with the industrial clanging is a nice twist that both keeps the song interesting while underscoring the emotional journey of the song.

**wavingwolves** (9): i would give this a 10 if it was the remix with linn da quebrada

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I love the turn but I just don't think this song holds up to the other songs on this record.

**BlueMetalWave** (8): Beautiful song

**plastichaxan** (8): this was fine and the last 2 minutes made it great

**twat\_brained** (8): great but I don't see much replay value

**slimboyfriend** (7): Instrumentally it's a little more sparse, but lyrically it's devastating

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.8): the harmonizing in this is amazing. then the beat kicks in and you're like DAMN

**fadedblue09** (5): Very acapella-ish for my tastes. For most of the song she sounds like she's just narrating rather than singing.

**ReallyCreative** (11): TRUTH: this album is amazing DARE: I dare Kelela to stop serving so hard because it's making the other girls nervous!

**bbfan132** (10): this production slaps

**bespectacIed** (10): The honeymoon phase of the album. This is pure SEX. Early 2000s RnB perfection with modern electronic production about licking each others' bodies, what else do you want

**BiPolarBear17** (10): The Gays WON. So fucking good, the last 2 minutes always make me astral project

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Perfection.

**bulforster** (9.5): Those clipped guitar hits are pure ear candy.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**cremeebrulee** (8): oh this is sexy

**wavingwolves** (8): is this the sexiest song i've heard? probably

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): oh this one is sexy, I like how flirty it is but it starts to get repetitive after a while

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the production lowkey ruins the vibe at some points

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): fun song but i think it falls a bit flat coming after LMK (high standard to live up to tho). the second half is considerably better however.

**twat\_brained** (6.6): wait I wasn't listening I'm no thoughts head empty what were the lyrics

**hunnybee12** (11): feels like a hug from a friend :(

**bbfan132** (10): excellent closing track to one of my favorite albums of the past decade

**bespectacIed** (10): Kelela's Formation --- a closer song that relates absolutely nothing to the narrative of the album but is still undeniably amazing lol. Or maybe it does relate to the narrative lol idk, i've long established that Bluff is the perfect ending of Take Me Apart's story. I've always interpreted this song as Kelela's self-affirmation. Kelela's telling herself to be secure with her own skin and recognize the things she's achieved in her life, and I realize how this could apply to all of us. Love this song so much!!!

**BiPolarBear17** (10): The first word I will always use to describe this is 'healing'; my heart always feels at peace every single time this comes on without fail. An incredible finale to an immaculate album.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): A fantastic closer, the instrumental is gorgeous, Kelela's vocals are perfect, it's just a beautiful ending

**ReallyCreative** (10): absolutely breathtaking closer

**skargardin** (10): such a GORGEOUS outro holy shit

**wavingwolves** (10): this is such a great closer i can't give any other score other than this

**bulforster** (9): A nice warm epilogue to the album after how cold the last few tracks are.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Cute closer, but I started to disconnect towards the end.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): good but does drag on a bit

**waluigiest** (9): we love a self love anthem that doesn’t sound and feel like a cliche, this is great

**1998tweety** (8): great closer

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is beautiful so not to be that bitch but like… it could have been a little shorter

**seanderlust** (7.3): "and now I know that I don't know nothing at all" socrates who

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): her pretty vocals make this song

**twat\_brained** (6.4): well that was an underwhelming end

**bbfan132** (10): reminds me of amy winehouse in the best way possible

**bespectacIed** (10): The best songs in this "genre-bending" album are the ones more traditional RnB, truly. This is so hype. The horns, the drums, the piano. So perfectly old-school.

**bulforster** (10): sad clown anthem

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): When I hear "My pussy is one hell of an addicition" I can't give a song a lower score. AND it's a serve and a half on its own as well.

**ReallyCreative** (10): - I didn't see much hype for this song leading into this rate and

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i feel like a more upbeat song is needed at this point in the album and this does not disappoint - it is so much fun and yes i do feel like a fool

**seanderlust** (9.3): this has such an amy winehouse vibe! i love it

**1998tweety** (9): bop, production here is great

**BlueMetalWave** (9): Already love it, but could switch places with After The Storm.

**wavingwolves** (9): the amy winehouse vibes are strong and they're welcome too

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): I had to double check if Mark Ronson produced this track or not

**akanewasright** (8): This reminds me of the Back to Black album for some reason. I love it

**Awkward\_King** (8): but pussy is one hell of an addiction

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Amy Winehouse a bit

**skargardin** (8): it really isn't fun to feel like a fool, spill queen

**twat\_brained** (8): fuck whoever made kali feel foolish she doesn't deserve that

**waluigiest** (8): not a bad Amy Winehouse impersonation

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Sounds a little busy, but the tropical vibes help it stand out.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I don’t know, while I like this I can’t help but feel like I’ve heard this song a few times on this album.

bespectacIed: I was late omfg so here are thots:

- I thought Day 3 will be a kali uchis party but kelela has the same number of songs left! Yay
- Yeah I need the solange met gala elevator incident re-enacted but popheads is jay z and I'm beyoncé awkwardly smiling thru the pain
- Still rooting for Kelela but I don't trust y'all's tastes to not rob her. Either Tyrant or After The Storm is gonna win I think. They are my 10 and 1 respectively so this is exciting
