**BiPolarBear17** (10): Dracula wishes he packed this much bite

**fadedblue09** (10): The album's catchiest song and immediate standout, the instrumental is pretty simple but very effective.

**hunnybee12** (10): ☭

**skargardin** (10): ok anti capitalist queen

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): what a banger honestly, the way she sings "your teeth in my neck" makes me swoooooon

**waluigiest** (10): Every part of this song is immaculate

**wavingwolves** (10): "rich man keeps getting richer, taking from the poor" - karl marx

**bbfan132** (9): i could listen to this on repeat for an hour tbh

**ReallyCreative** (9): Vampires everywhere have been put on NOTICE.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Anti-capitalist queen

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Really enjoy the lyrics of this one but it’s a bit flat musically, there’s a few nice hooks in there but nothing exceptionally strong and the sonics aren’t enough to carry it. The xylophone that comes in at the end kicks it up a notch though! Kinda feels like something from a musical

**slimboyfriend** (8): A marxist critique of money-hungry capitalists not quite on the level of Rina Sawayama's XS

**1998tweety** (7): bops a fair bit

**seanderlust** (6.5): "rich man keeps getting richer taking from the poor" listen, kali could do the communist manifesto, but karl marx couldn't do miami (feat. BIA) ijs

**bespectacIed** (5): Late 00s british blue-eyed soul vibes

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE bop

**bbfan132** (10): i randomly discovered this in 2017 and loved it immediately - still love it today!!

**bespectacIed** (10): My 11 in Isolation. Flawless song. The chorus is god-sent. Jorja brings little to the table, kali ate her up. But this is so fucking good def my fave song on the album

**fluviusfluit** (10): She disappeared like El Chapo!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): banger

**plastichaxan** (10): this bops in both english and spanish yup yup

**twat\_brained** (10): this reminded me how hot Jorja is I need to stop sleeping on her too

**plvtvcbvrds** (9): this used to be xmiramira's music for her let's plays which is how i discovered this album in the first place. what an interesting song.

**ReallyCreative** (9): It's a sister to Dead to Me, which is great but I think it would be better as a follow up rather than lead in

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): adore the production and beat in this

**waluigiest** (9): I had a ticket to a joint concert with Kali Uchis and Jorja Smith and I accidentally slept through it :(

**seanderlust** (8.6): the "all we do is french" line bumped this up a solid point

**bulforster** (8.5): Some of the verse lines and rhymes feel really forced but the rest (especially Jorja's feature) is great.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I hear reggae/Caribbean influences, I upvote.

**slimboyfriend** (8): "Word on the street you got hoes/I disappear like El Chapo" is my favorite line on the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.8): This song sounded better once I realized that it was a duet, if that makes sense, because it made the song more interesting. There’s a cool idea for a song here but the melody feels undeveloped, which is important.

**wavingwolves** (6): this is pleasant but mostly does nothing for me in comparison with every other song in this album

**seanderlust** (11): this is absolutely my favorite song of the rate. the verse from BIA is effortless cool.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): this song has it ALL! amazing production, heavenly vocals and the third verse... i can't. the way her voice deepens in the chorus is just perfection.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Ain't too boojee for corona. :soobcry:

**pat-rickstar** (10): So atmospheric, and the feature is excellent too

**plastichaxan** (10): the spanglish and the story in this song and just everything aaaaaaaaaaaa

**bespectacIed** (9): See this is what you create when you're an actual latina with actual real-life references, lana

**bulforster** (9): I feel like this song would run me over and I'd be grateful.

**fadedblue09** (9): I love songs with autobiographical lyrics and tbh, the rest of the album could've used more of them.

**fluviusfluit** (9): Corona the beer references really hit different after 2020

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I like the weird sort of spaghetti-western/Nancy Sinatra vibes of this one, maybe Kali can snatch up some of the lost Lana fans

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): ok this kinda slaps

**wavingwolves** (9): "ain't too bougie for corona" aren't we all at this point

**akanewasright** (8.5): I love that rap feature

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): will smith outsold

**bbfan132** (8): don’t know how to describe this but it works

**slimboyfriend** (8): I feel like I'm wearing big sunglasses when I listen to this

**twat\_brained** (8): will smith who

**waluigiest** (8): “aint too bougie for corona” woke socially distant queen ahead of her time

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**Awkward\_King** (7): why would i be jeffree i could be kanye

**frogaranaman** (11): infectious

**bespectacIed** (10): This has such an uplifting vibe. That beat is sooo fucking catchy. It's so relaxing listening to Solange sing about everyday black joy

**BlueMetalWave** (10): I wish I had two elevens just for this track.

**fadedblue09** (10): Her vocals really shine here, definitely an album standout

**plvtvcbvrds** (10): thought this song was produced by timbaland. gives me aaliyah vibes.

**ReallyCreative** (10): This is just about as close to a perfect R+B song as you're gonna get I think

**skargardin** (10): banger

**wavingwolves** (10): groovy

**bulforster** (9.5): At last a song with some real progression in the vocal, and a really good one at that!

**waluigiest** (9): first of all the interlude into this song is MAGICAL. And her melodies and vocals are beautiful through the rest of the song. I couldn’t tell you what this song is about but it’s stunning

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is probably my favorite beat so far?

**bbfan132** (8.5): this production is perfect

**twat\_brained** (8.5): like Milli? I can do that she slaps

**seanderlust** (8.2): hold up

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this slaps, love how the beat slightly hardens for the chorus while still staying subtle

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes catchy

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): from progressive?

**BiPolarBear17** (7): Me when I try to stop Florence Welch from leaving

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This starts off really promising but then it just kinda doesn’t go anywhere, I get what Solange is going for with her sound but sometimes it just ends up feeling flat. Like the payoff here isn’t very satisfying

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): when my friend florence is leaving and i tell her not to go

**1998tweety** (10): this bops a lot oh wow

**bbfan132** (10): this title fits the song perfectly

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my favorite kelela songs ever!!! On its own it's already powerful love song but in the context of the album it marked kelela moving beyond the physical phase and wanting to truly commit to her new lover. The distortion effects on her voice adds to that manic feeling kelela has in this song. Such a well-done song

**bulforster** (10): That deep synth line in the chorus makes me... feel things.

**fluviusfluit** (10): That beat in the chorus is sick

**pat-rickstar** (10): Awesome production

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): obsessed with this chorus! the "falling's" in the background, the slightly robotic voice, perfection

**wavingwolves** (10): found the perfect song

**BlueMetalWave** (9): A high point of the album.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): this is proto hyperpop

**ReallyCreative** (9): Kelela said KMart rights!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the four second segment of this that i put in the rate trailer is still stuck in my head months later

**waluigiest** (9): okay the beat? wack. Love it

**BiPolarBear17** (8.5): The way Take Me Apart's weakest cut still manages to surpass most album's strongest cuts

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): There’s some really lovely moments in this one but also some kind of obnoxious moments, which is definitely a risk with this kind of sound. It’s a good song but I wish it had a tighter focus and centered on the good ideas more while cutting out some of the bullshit.

**twat\_brained** (7.1): okay I was semi-actively listening to this one where does she mention a blue light here

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Too many annoying vocal effects.

**bigbigbee** (11): This song makes me feel like I’m in space, weeeeeeee!

**plastichaxan** (11): every time i listen to this i'm convinced i'm listening to one of the best songs ever made

**1998tweety** (10): another masterpiece, how does she keep doing it

**bbfan132** (10): i hear a 2-step song, i give it a 10

**bespectacIed** (10): My introduction to the convoluted genius of Arca...I was glad it was with an accessible pop song lol. The final arc of this album is a sense of deja vu for kelela... she's stuck on yet another passion-filled relationship that had reduced into a cycle of toxicity that seems to go onanon anon anon...

**BiPolarBear17** (10): Mayhaps one of the best bridge & outro combos to exist. Lowkey wouldn't be surprised if this snatched the win and we would NOT be complaining if it did, this explosive whopper of a song feels like a final boss and it would be WHOLLY deserving of a rate victory.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I still dream of Onanon.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a strong contender for my 11. something about this song just makes it reverberate within me, and the way she sings "spinning around" gives me goosebumps EVERY TIME

**wavingwolves** (10): this is ultimately such a sad song and that outro is heavenly

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.6): amazing

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Qanon could NEVER serve like this. She might have millions of Americans enticed by a dangerous seditious death cult but she could never pull something like this off. She's just not that kind of girl.

**fluviusfluit** (9): Kelsey Lu on the cello!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ain’t that the conspiracy website on facebook?

**skargardin** (9): I feel like this might be underrated, hopefully I'll be proven wrong

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): We love some rapid fire lyrics! This song sounds like a desert vista, if that makes sense

**twat\_brained** (8.2): oh yes love me some garage every now and then

**BlueMetalWave** (8): Good follow up to Blue Light

**bulforster** (8): Her vocals, faultless as ever, never match the slightly manic energy of the production like I wish they did.

**seanderlust** (7): the outro to this sounds so cool

**bespectacIed** (11): I'm sure the top kelela song will be the obvious favorites like lmk or frontline, and I love them both, but this is the greatest song Kelela has ever done. Kelela painted a vivid picture of rekindling with an ex with this song, and its title "Take Me Apart" perfectly describes the mutual destruction and rediscovery that comes with it. The inhibitions, the sexual tension, the attempt to understand one another once more (through fucking, of course)... kelela conveys it all in this song. The emotional potency of this song is off the roof!!! My fave lyric of the album is from this song's bridge: "don't say you're in love baby until you learn to take me apart". It sounds so damn poetic and sensual, it makes me cry. I am looking at this too deeply, this song is def just about a really good hookup with an ex lmao. But this is the song that made me stan kelela, and I am still as mindblown on my thousandth listen as my first time.

**bbfan132** (10): she delivered on the title track

**bulforster** (10): Mind-rending.

**fadedblue09** (10): A vocal highlight of the album. Reminds me of some of Twigs' stuff.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): TAKE ME APAAAAAAART

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is how you experiment with R+B a little bit, really electric track that just surprises you at every turn

**skargardin** (10): the first few tracks are pretty relentless and we love them for that!

**seanderlust** (9.5): ooooh this is gorgeous. i'm obsessed with the muffled drums behind the chorus and the "don't say you're in love" harmonies

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love how chaotic and cavernous the production is on this one, it’s like you can hear how tumultuous the emotions this relationship is giving her are. The vulnerability in the lyrics is really nice too, “take me apart” is such a violent and almost unpleasant way to describe sex but that’s what makes it feels so intimate at the same time. This is fanfic-worthy.

**wavingwolves** (9): "seven in the morning / when they wake you gotta be ghost" whew! this hits

**twat\_brained** (8): as far as title tracks go this is kinda eh but at this point I just adore Kelela's voice I should've never slept on her

**waluigiest** (8): not keen on the first bits but the way this song evolves and molds over time is gorgeous

**1998tweety** (7.5): I would like this more if the chorus didnt sound underwater

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): My atoms are splitting

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): the way she sings "take me apart" makes me want to burst into tears idk it's just so full of emotion

**fadedblue09** (11): I feel so basic giving my 11 to this mainly because it's Cranes in the Sky 2.0 but damn, that instrumental is just so irresistible. On top of that, Solange's lyrics and delivery is just top-notch here.

**bbfan132** (10): beat is perfect, playboi carti’s verse is perfect, visuals in the video are perfect, it’s perfect

**bespectacIed** (10): Just a stunning ode to blackness. A celebration of black sounds, beats, culture. This is what Solange does.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm a sucker for Carti's adlibs.

**seanderlust** (10): CARTI LYRICS CANNOT BE TRANSCRIBED

**skargardin** (10): an 11 contender, whew

**waluigiest** (10): FUBU is my favorite Solange track and this feels like a great Part 2, where both the themes and flows are used and developed.

**wavingwolves** (10): magical

**bulforster** (9.5): This is definitely the highlight of the album and I'd love to give it a 10 but I'm still not fully sold on Playboi Carti's feature (even though it's grown on me).

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): No one can tell me popheads rates aren't educational, I never would've recognised Playboi Carti on this if I hadn't done the pollen rate

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): Love all the influences, it's very busy but in a good way. Not a fan of Playboy Carti on this song though, it just doesn't work for me unfortuatenly

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Chillest banger I've ever heard

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): great song and i LOVE the conviction in her voice when she's singing

**twat\_brained** (8): alright come through hip hop wuneen

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I looked up the Genius page for this song so I could get a full grasp of the lyrics and backstory of this song and I respect what they were going for here, but unfortunately the context doesn’t really make me enjoy this on a musical level. It’s not awful but even after a few listens it’s also not something I really think I’ll ever be interested in listening to again.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): Lyrically I like it, but the instrumental reals really lacking in a rate with so many other heavenly, pretty songs

brenda_official: # When I Get Home

---

**Overall Average**: 7.592 **// Average Controversy:** 1.505

---

**bespectacIed** (9.308): The knowles sisters and their habit to pair a 10/10 alt-RnB album with a visual film, name a more iconic duo. It's kinda hard to rate the songs individually in the album because they function as continuous vignettes of Houston life, but WIGH is definitely a well-executed experimental RnB album

**ReallyCreative** (8.838): This is how you make vibey, sophisticated, but accessible R+B. A soothing and soulful delight from start to finish.

**buddhacharm** (8.808): One of my fave albums of the decade

**thunderbird\_14** (8.577): I don’t know if it’s the amount of times I have listened to this album has made me fallen in love with it or not, but I’m forever grateful that this was one of my first R&B album that I’m completely in love with.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.538): This is a great album that I'll hardly listen to again.

**waluigiest** (8.462): this is a great album, but I can’t help but feel that it’s missing the magic A Seat at the Table has. However, I need to commend this album for its ability to build beautiful soundscapes out of simple ideas or melodies or single lyrics. the songs are so minimal but beautifully constructed and overall it works really, really well. I just miss some of the lyrical and thematic density of her last project.

**vlc\_grad** (8.423): This is my first time revisiting this album since it came out. I remember enjoying it upon first listen but it felt a tad too experimental for my preference. I was never drawn to re-listen to it in it's entirety, maybe due to the lyrical repetition. I really enjoy the album but I still don't think it has the replay value as other albums for me.

**frogaranaman** (8.154): this sounds absolutely gorgeous on vinyl

**fadedblue09** (8.000): Apologies if the genre purist in me is jumping out, but this album appealed to me the most out of the three. When I listen to R&B, I prefer soulful vocal delivery with smooth instrumentals that reek of various influences, and this album definitely showcased that. I feel like some tracks could've used more time to fully develop, but otherwise I found it to be a satisfying listen.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.731): 7.730769231 It would be a surprise to no one that this album would be majorly robbed, because it doesn't work as individual songs as much as an atmosphere or a backdrop to vibe to, and you really have to be in a very specific mood to enjoy this. Absolutely love the laid-back vibes and intricate instrumentals tho, it will definitely grow with repeated listens

**BlueMetalWave** (7.731): I never listened to Solange before but I had an amazing time with both the album and the film.

**plastichaxan** (7.677): A very hit or miss album for me, I love her but I either thought the songs weren't too great or that I was listening to some of the best songs ever. It was a mixed bag but ultimately I liked more songs.

**seanderlust** (7.562): i'm going to be honest, of the three this is less of a standout. it's nice, but it all kind of fades together. it's hazy which is maybe what she was going for, but i personally like ASATT a bit better. still has some pretty great highlights

**slimboyfriend** (7.538): Sometimes it's hard to tell which song is an interlude and which one isn't. That's a testament to how well these songs flow together. That's also why rating individual songs feels wrong. This was one of my favorite albums from 2019, and if I were to rate it as an album, my score would be higher than this score.

**pat-rickstar** (7.454): This is not a bad album at all, it's all very easy on the ears. Still my lowest album average of the three. I have a feeling some of the songs might grow on me in the future though

**akanewasright** (7.423): This is not an album that lends itself to rating. At all. I like it a lot, but it’s worth a lot more than the sum of its parts. So rating its parts doesn’t make it look very good. It has a lot of really cool moments, but it’s one 40 minute unit in my mind. I want Solange to sing me to sleep though.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.354): a seat at the table outsold by miles i fear

**vayyiqra** (7.154): This is the second album by Solange I've heard now (after A Seat at the Table) and I found it enjoyable. I like its experimental feel and mix of genres and influences. I think Solange is an underrated artist who I will be going back to soon.

**bulforster** (7.000): I can't fully get into this album, it's got highlights for sure and the sparse, experimental jazz elements are cool but there's not much meat on the (pretty interesting!) bones of a lot of these songs. It's a bit of a shame we're not somehow rating the interludes either because they bring a lot of character to the album that the songs don't on their own.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.423): Yeah I don’t know what happened with this one, *A Seat At The Table* was so good and then this is the followup? I’ve heard it described as “an album of interludes” and I can’t disagree with that, it just feels incomplete. It’s not bad but the fact that there are people who defend it as being *great* is, in my eyes, an example of an artist’s cloud coloring perception of their actual work. If this were by some artist that no one had heard of people would say “wow there’s some neat ideas on here, can’t wait until their next project to see if they can refine them” but instead we have to act like this is the end product and the evolution when it’s nothing like that, it’s nothing of the sort.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.223): I REALLY hated this on the first listen. I didn't give a single track above a 6 initially. But when I revisited it, I noticed I liked a few tracks more than I first did. And then I relistened to them again and liked them even more. It's a real grower, but I still think overall it's the lowest quality of the 3 albums here, with a lot of tracks feeling really underbaked

**DaHumanTorch** (5.731): In my top 10,000 albums ever

**BlueMetalWave** (11): Perfect track that made me a fan

**TragicKingdom1** (11): goes for a very specific aesthetic and nails it!

**1998tweety** (10): bopt

**bbfan132** (10): a collaboration made in heaven

**bulforster** (10): This is so optimistic it could easily turn corny but Kali's lyrics all ring true add Tyler and Bootsy Collins add some complementary wry levity.

**cremeebrulee** (10): a close 11 contender! i love this song, it’s so earnest and uplifting and tyler fits so well into this

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Tyler ate and left no crumbs.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is a close 11 contender

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I could see this winning.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Bootsy an icon!

**seanderlust** (10): the instrumentals. bootsy's feature. tyler's verse. this is the concept of cool in a 3.5 minute song

**twat\_brained** (10): sounds like one of those slowed + reverb songs that gets big on TikTok. Hey, why not do that to this song, there's your next trend right there

**wavingwolves** (10): definitely a bit cheesy but sometimes we need a feel good song and this works for me wonderfully

**fluviusfluit** (9): Sarah Tonin? I've heard of her only after this song

**fadedblue09** (8.5): The instrumental is so pretty, and it has a cute lounge-pop vibe to it. Definitely the highlight of the otherwise forgettable 2nd half.

**ReallyCreative** (8): There are great moments, but I kind of expected more from such a powerhouse collaboration

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Tyler is the most memorable part of this song tbh

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I want George Clinton to talk in every song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): beautiful song but just missing a little something

**waluigiest** (6): I feel like this SHOULD be good but instead the lyrics are so corny

**bespectacIed** (1): I AM NOT BEING A CONTRARIAN I SWEAR but oh my god this song is so overrated. This 1 is probably a rage score. This song's literally "chill hiphop beats to study to" meets facebook self-help quotes. The lyrics make me cringe so much.

**pat-rickstar** (11): I do feel basic giving this my 11 because it's one of the poppiest songs in the rate, but it's too good not to! The production is so lush

**skargardin** (11): this song really hits the spot in every way, singing along with the chorus never gets old.

**wavingwolves** (11): i went through a specific rough situation that made me feel like this song was written about that and because of the many times where i found solace in it i have to give it the highest score i can

**1998tweety** (10): tiktok smash hit

**bbfan132** (10): love the synths here

**bulforster** (10): I'm too much of a wimp for confrontation so this version of conflict management is very appealing to me. The song's also a major bop.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I used to think this was going to be my definite 11, but then I heard Waitin.

**fluviusfluit** (10): Insert Regina George why are you so obsessed with me meme

**frogaranaman** (10): this production is slick

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): banger

**plastichaxan** (10): every version of this is incredible :noitstrue: also the lyrics hit too close

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way this song builds up and explodes, QUITE the bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): very strong contender for my 11, everything about this is perfect

**waluigiest** (9): I hate how much I love the drops

**akanewasright** (7.5): This production though

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This, like, flirts with dance pop and I wish it had just gone fully in that direction because this would be a killer disco/house song but it’s just a middling… whatever this is.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): The funk influences were nice, but the track got irritating real quick.

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Doesn't get better than this.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): the talent wow

**bbfan132** (10): there’s a reason why i’ve scrobbled this 88 times… i could listen to this on repeat for the rest of my life

**bespectacIed** (10): My second favorite kelela song after the title track! Immediately after the break up song is a reconciliation song lmao. I particularly love how the song was summarized by the line "And you don't know you'd done it but I'm in my head and I can't forget even later on." --- kelela and her lover knows that what they had was destructive, but they don't give a fuck because they only choose to remember the good parts. If that's not a perfect snapshot of modern romance, idk what is! P.S. that viral video of caviar being harvested off of some fish pussy with "stop ... lemme catch my breath" edited on to it ... it ruined my life :(

**fadedblue09** (10): Probably my favorite track here. I love the seamless weaving of dance and R&B elements, and it's really catchy.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this was the only Kelela song I've ever heard going into this rate, from when we rated it in Charity II. This is pretty fitting, seeing as how the aftermath of popheads robbing it directly led to the foundation of numerous non-profit organizations dedicated towards getting this sub some fucking taste

**skargardin** (10): im a sucker for when songs completely stops when a "stop..." moment is included like on this song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): people who think this song is boring are simply wrong

**twat\_brained** (10): wait I get it now this fkn slaps

**wavingwolves** (10): love the woosh woosh sound

**1998tweety** (9.5): this bops a lot

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): banger

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): Sometimes I think this song is perfect

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): ok does this melody remind anyone else of spinning around by Kylie??

**waluigiest** (9): her voice is out of this world and the flow here is unmatched

**seanderlust** (8.7): "Saw you there and it fucked me up" is a great way to start a song. it's so simple, but you know exactly what she's talking about instantly. that said, this one drags a little bit towards the end.

**BlueMetalWave** (8.5): Immediate stand out.

**bulforster** (8.5): I've cooled a bit on this one, she's as flawless as ever but it's not resonating emotionally with me as it once did.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): She maintains that sprawling electro pop sound but refines it into a more conventional party-friendly synthpop song and it really works. I was like “this is begging for a remix” and it turns out there’s a remix album and the KAYTRANDA did a remix of this which is an incredible idea and I do like the resulting remix but I do still kinda want a more straightforward club remix.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): stop...lemme catch my breath

**mysario** (0): it's been a year since the last time I rated this and know what's happened in the past year? a lot! I've had a huge character arc and I've come to appreciate more moments in my life that I had once taken for granted. So every time I listen to this song, it takes away from those moments as I'm waiting for the end of this song to come

**mysario** (11): I'm basic

**twat\_brained** (11): if this doesn't win I can't imagine what would tbh

**bbfan132** (10): kali and steve are a perfect combo

**bespectacIed** (10): A bop, plain and simple. Kali chose amazing collaborators in this album, and they made magic like this.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the production on this!!! holy shit

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): SHE WANTS MY HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS

**nootnoot781** (10): this song is just so fucking cool

**plastichaxan** (10): how i'm tryna b

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is a super fun one that I'm gonna need to add to some playlists

**seanderlust** (10): "she don't want love she wants my $100 bills! haha i feel that" - me, a gay man with $5.38 in my checking account

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this songs is so much fun and yes i do want your $100

**waluigiest** (10): I think about this chorus ALL THE TIME thank you Steve Lacy. But for real the second verse is so good and it grounds this song in social politics and I love it

**bulforster** (9.5): Kali said fuck SWERFs.

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): I wish this was longer

**frogaranaman** (9): oh that chorus is dumb infectious. SHE WANT MY HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLSSSSS

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): “she don’t want love she wants hundred dollar bills” https://thebizofbaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/PNLD.jpg but seriously I like the lyrics of this one, they’re kinda dressed up as your typical “baddie chick” style boasts but low-key she’s digging into the desperation and fear that drives the character she’s describing to be obsessed with money, because she has to ensure her own survival above all else

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): A perfect stripper anthem for the beach

**akanewasright** (8): Bop

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**wavingwolves** (7): overplayed this song for myself because i loved to sing along the verses while i pretended it had anything to do with me but it's still a bop

brenda_official: # Isolation

---

**Overall Average**: 8.161 **// Average Controversy:** 1.507

---

**plastichaxan** (9.267): I really love this album, I discovered her around her Por Vida era, so when this started I was excited and the growth between both eras (and this and Sin Miedo) have made it all worth it, and as a Colombian, it's really special seeing someone like Kali making this quality work since the beginning. It hurt not to have my 11 in this album but at least it has my highest average

**buddhacharm** (9.167): One of my fave albums of the decade...again

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.000): My score should speak for itself, I have no words.

**BlueMetalWave** (8.900): One of my favorite albums of all time.

**DaHumanTorch** (8.700): In my top 50 albums ever

**ReallyCreative** (8.687): There's a lot of cool experimentation going on in this album, she plays with her sound a lot, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse, but I always appreciate the effort.

**twat\_brained** (8.573): insert quarantine joke here I had comments for all these songs but I lost them well

**waluigiest** (8.467): I feel like people dunk on Kali Uchis and this album but I’ve always loved it!!

**vlc\_grad** (8.367): I wasn't familiar with this album before the rate. I'm happy to be introduced to it and can see myself keeping this album in rotation.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.353): I love how on this album, Kali acts like a chameleon, seamless blending in with all these styistically diverse tracks, and yet it all still manages to tie together into a really solid album. Definitely my favourite here

**pat-rickstar** (8.300): I don't have much to say about this album except it's really good. I've been listening to this and her newest album a lot recently

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.293): I listened to this around the time that it came out and I was a little bit bored by it but I think my musical palate has evolved since then and I really liked it this time around! The old school big band style mixed with more modern r&b and the other Latin influences (I’m not gonna pretend like I can name them) is a bold sound that’s fun to listen to, even if it washes the album as a whole out in my memory. There are a lot of other up and coming Latina artists like Angelica Garcia and Kaina that I think deserve some more attention but I’m not mad at Kali being at the forefront.

**seanderlust** (8.253): this is one of my favorite albums i've rated in this subreddit so far. I had heard it before but only as a part of an annual end-of-year best-of albums listen through, so I didn't spend much time on it. this is fantastic though

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.227): one of my fave albums of 2018

**Awkward\_King** (8.167): my favourite album of all time it's just fucking transportive. not a bad track and such incredible lyrics and smooth production and her voice is so pretty and the accompanying videos and aesthetic are beautiful i just... it makes me so happy

**vayyiqra** (7.667): This album got a lot of hype the year it was released, but I'd say it was deserved. It's not something I go back to often but but is very enjoyable from start to finish. I wish I had time to write a longer review of it, but for now I'll say my takeaway is that it's quite different from the other two in sound, being somewhat less electronic and having some Latin influences which is neat.

**slimboyfriend** (7.600): An incredible pop album that reminds me of CRJ's Emotion because there isn't a single bad song here. Kali Uchis shows her versatility and myriad influences on Isolation and proves that she deserves more credit as a pop star.

**frogaranaman** (7.133): I like her more Latin / reggaeton sound in her more recent album more, but this is still good

**bespectacIed** (6.867): I am not ashamed to admit the discourse around Kali has soured my enjoyment of this record :/ Nevertheless it's a solid debut from her. Flawless production, great collabs, so many stunning songs among some duds. Not as good as the other two albums in the rate. Unpopular opinion: I think this album is NOT as genre-mixing as everyone proclaims it is, if anything it needs more latin genres!!!!! At its core, Isolation is a traditional rnb-pop album with a sprinkling of reggaeton / bossa nova here and there. Whew I think I'm being too negative lol this is a legit enjoyable pop record

**fadedblue09** (6.267): Not an entirely terrible listen, but this album appealed to me the least out of the three. I thought it was gonna follow the autobiographical route of 'Miami', but that fizzled out quickly. There's some subtle sonic diversity in some tracks, but they are offset by some generic songs. Wished those sonic influences were more pronounced so that it would've made this album less dull.

**bbfan132** (11): holy fuck this is actually perfect

**BiPolarBear17** (11): SO many songs in the rate deserving of 11s and Solange might've nabbed up mine had A Seat At The Table been included (considering Cranes In The Sky is my favourite song of all-time). Fortunately for Kelela it wasn't, which left Take Me Apart to call dibs on my 11 here. More than half the tracks on this record deserve an 11, but if I'm cruelly only allowed to pick one then it had to be Front11ne. I'd start off describing Frontline as a journey but that feels like an understatement in itself already; Frontline's a whole ass movie packed into one monumental song. From the sounds of joints crackling to high heels click-clacking, everything is done to maximum effect, and Kelela's explosive vocal delivery is the icing on an already impeccable cake. What's seriously not to love here?

**bulforster** (11): The tension in that two tone synth pulse alone - exquisite.

**nootnoot781** (11): the music video is great idc. i know you’re all going to slander it in the plug right after this WINS but i’m right. the sims 2 graphics work so well, y’all are just tasteless. anyway the song itself is breathtaking and so magical.

**bespectacIed** (10): I love how this album started with an angry breakup song right off the bat. Every little gripe that Kelela had built up from her toxic relationship has boiled down to this epic smackdown. She sounds so defiant, self-assured, calculated, she's "winter but burning inside"... and we have no choice but to root for her. No surprise that this is one of kelela's more popular songs, it's a smash.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This really clicked with me on the second listen.

**fluviusfluit** (10): Crying and talking about it as we speak

**frogaranaman** (10): the music video alone makes this perfect

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Partially I’m giving this a good score because she had the audacity to drop that incredible IMVU music video (which I unironically love) but also there’s just something special about this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/D9a93eN.gif

**plastichaxan** (10): strongest opener in this rate yup yup

**ReallyCreative** (10): It's no Frontline by Gavin Turek but on the flip side, Frontline by Gavin Turek is no Frontline by Kelela

**skargardin** (10): incredible

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): best opening song of the three albums, when the beat hits you are literally transported into the music

**waluigiest** (10): okay the DROP. This song is an epic.

**wavingwolves** (10): 👠 tap tap tap tap tap tap 🔑 beep beep 🔓 swish ❌ thump 🚗 vroom vroom

**fadedblue09** (9.5): A behemoth of an opening track.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I LOVE the completely random modded sims MV for this

**twat\_brained** (9.2): if you can make it through this 5 minute song it's so worth it

**seanderlust** (9): i think of these three albums this is my favorite opener.

**1998tweety** (8.5): oh wow this is quite good, great opener

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I know sometimes this music can feel pretentious for some people, so please watch the music video for this song if you feel that way.

**BlueMetalWave** (6.5): okay intro, not as solid as the other ones.

**1998tweety** (11): masterpiece

**akanewasright** (11): Idk if this is a good 11 or if it was a single or anything, but it fucking slaps holy shit.

**cremeebrulee** (11): kind of a basic 11 but even though this whole album is incredible i visit this track the most! i love that it’s a great “heading to the party” sort of song and that makes me miss going out a lot lol

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): literally one of my favorite songs in recent memory like GOD i want this song to step on me

**bbfan132** (10): what a fucking bop!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): THEE signature kelela song. The song that casuals know most from her: a bouncy, flirty, early 2000s RnB bop. The most \#relatable song in this avant-garde album. This marked a new arc on the album... Kelela has moved on completely from her painful breakups and is ready to hoe out again. In an era of casual, fast love, Kelela knows the importance of communication and laying down the ground rules. We stan!

**BlueMetalWave** (10): The best track of the album.

**buddhacharm** (10): This would've been my 11 had Isolation not been so greedy!

**fluviusfluit** (10): PES rights!

**pat-rickstar** (10): This SLAPS, I've given a few other 10s but this is probably my second choice for an 11

**skargardin** (10): what a banger, an obvious album highlight

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): honestly deserved to have some chart success

**twat\_brained** (10): great as this is I'm reminded of Tinashe's "Watch Me Work" but this is clearly supposed to be better I think

**bulforster** (9.5): Docking half a point just because I don't want it to win but it still slaps.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): My expectations for this were high and they weren't fully met. Whoops.

**ReallyCreative** (9): It's great but I think the opening few tracks outshine it

**slimboyfriend** (9): Me and the gorls are partying on MArs to this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): bop!

**wavingwolves** (8): this sounds evil and sooo good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.8): I like the lyrics of this one but the production is a bit rubbery… like there’s four different production hooks here and they’re all good individually but together they just kinda make noise soup. Still pretty good though.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Ehhh I'm not sure why this is so hyped. It has some boppy elements, but the chorus is super generic and lazy.

brenda_official: # Take Me Apart

---

**Overall Average**: 8.319 **// Average Controversy:** 1.348

---

**bespectacIed** (10.071): One of my favorite albums of all time. The album that cemented to me the fact that RnB is the most innovative and creative genre: more than pop, rock, or hip-hop. Take Me Apart achieved retro-futurism flawlessly, it sounds sooo early 2000s and 3000s. And kelela didn't do it with abrasive industrial production that usually gets associated with "futuristic music", she and her brilliant team of producers did it with glitchy, sound effects, and space-y, ambient synths... as if kelela herself has written this album in a sleazy nightclub aboard a starship where humanity now lives, hurtling through space. Idk it that makes sense lol, but this album has such a very ethereal, cosmic vibe to me. But more than the stunning avant-garde production, I love how the album tackled sexuality, heartbreak, and modern love so well. The album has linear narrative arcs: a woman who just went through a breakup, rekindled with her ex, realized once again that they weren't meant to be, and started up a new romance with new relationship woes. This album is a masterpiece in every aspect. If you don't stan kelela you're tasteless.

**BiPolarBear17** (9.714): Words will never ever be able to do this record justice, and I can't emphasise how grateful I am to have this magnum opus in my life. My most-listened to album of all-time and I don't think anything else comes close.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.643): In my top 5 albums ever

**bulforster** (9.250): An immaculate album: impeccably structured, breathtaking vocals, cutting edge production, smash after smash after smash from track 1 to track 14.

**buddhacharm** (9.036): Also one of my fave albums of the decade...YES AGAIN

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.929): Exquisite. I will have to check out her earlier releases.

**plastichaxan** (8.857): Hit after hit, a cultural reset, the moment, etc. etc. No but seriously, every single song, even the ones I didn't like as much before hit different this time around, not a boring moment in this album yup.

**vlc\_grad** (8.821): This album is just a masterpiece to me. I think it may be in my top 10 of albums of all time. The vocals and the production are just impeccable.

**pat-rickstar** (8.786): Despite Kali getting my 11, this album has my highest album average, so I would still be super happy with LMK or Frontline winning. So glad I did this rate and discovered this album, need to listen to the rest of her discography next!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.500): great album

**seanderlust** (8.436): chill lofi beats to get laid to. no but for real, I really liked this. whether the subject matter is a late night booty call or emotional vulnerability at the end of a relationship, it all feels so intimate and special. I actually hadn't heard Kelela before - I'm really impressed!

**akanewasright** (8.321): I think this was my favorite of the bunch?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.307): This was the only album I hadn’t listened to before the rate and I wish that I hadn’t put this off so much so I could have had more time with this one because it blew me away from the first listen. I kinda scored it on a curve so I might have actually given Kali a higher overall score but this was definitely my favorite!

**bigbigbee** (7.929): My favorite album in the rate and it’s not that close.

**twat\_brained** (7.693): heard nothing but great things about this album so I'm delighted to hear it for myself

**vayyiqra** (7.643): This is a bold album which suits Kelela's personality, and I feel like I haven't engaged with it enough, only having heard it twice. I really like this kind of alternative R&B with darker sounds, and it's a very strong debut. I'm looking forward to hearing what she does next.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.636): I really enjoyed how vivid the instrumentals are on here, and there's a lot of powerful lyrical moments too, but some of the tracks do feel a little too long/vacant for me to fully appreciate them

**slimboyfriend** (7.250): This album trips me to outer space and brings me to a club on Mars.

**BlueMetalWave** (7.214): I listened to a few tracks on random playlists but this was my first time listening to everything. My least favorite of the bunch and the only one I probably won't revisit with the exception of a few songs.

**fadedblue09** (6.857): Tbh, I wished I liked this more, but I still expect this album to do well since it has a lot of club-friendly tracks that fits this sub's taste (which unfortunately, doesn't necessarily translate to MY tastes). The first 3 songs are the highlights for me, but everything else that follows feel either generic or stiff with a few exceptions.

bespectacIed: It bears repeating, one of my favorite rates ever! Solid albums through and through and with such a satisfying conclusion. Stan Kelela!!!!!

P.S. I need everyone to rethink their opinion over Take Me Apart (song) cuz it's really one of the greatest songs of all time

=====

TiltControls: Couldn't make the reveal this time around, but so happy my 11 won!
And great job to u/brenda_official for hosting a fantastic rate!

Also updates for [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/)

**Artists**

All three artists have enough songs to be ranked now!

Kelela in particular had a great outing and squeezes into the overall top 10 artist averages at #10! Kali Uchis (24/223) follows with a very strong showing and Solange (86/223) places a bit further down (but I have a feeling she'll be moving up soon).

Kelela also takes on the 3rd lowest artist controversy, while Solange is just outside the top 10 lowest at #11

**Songs**

On the average score top 100, LMK takes #38 and Frontline lands at #86!

**Rates**

As mentioned by others before, this rate now holds the 8th highest average and 4th lowest controversy of all rates! Everyone seemed to agree how strong these albums were.

**Other**

On another note [songeniality wins](https://pastebin.com/nbKcqjCz) are tracked now! I'll update this later at some point to list which rates they "won" songeniality (a.k.a. when they got robbed)
