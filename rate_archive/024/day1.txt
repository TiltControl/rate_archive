The Anniversary Rate Reveal, Day 1: Ready For It?
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/71t7ok/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_1_ready_for_it/

Hello my friends! Today marks the first reveal day for the anniversary rate. About a year ago we gathered here to witness 1989 get eviscerated, but will history repeat itself? Only one way to find out!

Some notes:

* The countdown will begin at 4pm EST.
* 128 people participated in this rate!
* I'll be revealing all of the songs from #55 to #31.
* The average score was **7.0627**.
* The average controversy score was **2.1006**. 
* Follow along live in [our plug.dj room](https://plug.dj/popheads/) if you can!
* Remember that this is all for fun! It's okay to be messy, but be nice to each other.

Also, I'm planning on having the reveals for Saturday and Sunday at 2pm EST, but users have been saying that this time is inconvenient for them. Let me know if you have a preference for a different time that's still reasonable.

TheKneesOfOurBees: I met @doctorwhowhenhowwhy recently, my name is madison (@dinahbgc) and this is my M&G story. I met him October 20th of this year and it was horrific. He was rude, not classy and he lost a long time pophead that day. I walked into the $350 M&G and say hello he replies with "bad taste" and I shook it off because I thought maybe I had heard him wrong. As I approached him and asked to do my pose he stared at me blank faced. I continued talking "you saved my life" I say. "You're the reason I'm alive today". He looks me dead in the eye and says "you'll die soon enough, Carly Rae Jepsen fan" and then whispered "Deaf". I started crying I had never felt pain like this and he started laughing and said "are you crying? Stop it. Stop it now" and he flicked my anus. The photographer took the picture and I headed out of the M&G section and that's when Doc started speaking Wendy Williams to me. I still can't believe this happened. I cried writing this. I wish this weren't true but DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy is in fact; a horrible person.

**BreezySeason** (5): Queen of oh god this feature is awful JUST FRIENDS aaaaaa

---
Bieber and Carly have a weird history that's entirely because the two share the same manager, Scooter Braun. Carly was an opening act for Justin's tour in 2012, and the only reason "I Really Like You" went top 40 is because her management released a cute video with clips of Justin and Ariana that had the song playing in the background, which got more attention than anything else Carly did in the *Emotion* era. It's so funny to me how much Scooter and co. tried to make Carly popular by sticking her with Bieber, seeing as it was a doomed effort. I'm honestly shocked (but mostly relieved) this wasn't released as a single, seeing that it would at least garuantee a bunch of sales from rabid Beliebers. In the end, I don't really see Carly and Justin like...interact with each other outside of these forced companionships, so I'm unsure if they're actually friends.

Also, this song is quite bad.

---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (0): This is a choice. I am not being a Bieber hater here, I just think this duet is boring and fell flat.

**Piccprincess** (0): stop

**Qwilphish** (0): I can't stand anything about this song, the fake authenticity by using an acoustic guitar, 2012 Bieber, "you don't know you're beautiful" trope, boring vocal performances. A perfect train wreck of a song except at least a train wreck is an interesting spectacle to watch unlike listening to this song.

---

You know I used to be in 1D:

**superr\_rad** (3): invented one direction. target commercial background music realness. anyways bieber adds literally nothing to this, and this is the worst song on the album by far.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): One Direction whom's't?

**twat\_brained** (8.5): And people say One Direction have no influence. THEIR BIGGEST RIVAL SUNG A SONG WITH THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER AS THEIR BIGGEST HIT ALONGSIDE THE BEST ARTIST OF THE MID-2010S

**supersecrettest** (7): One Direction WHO? Jk I don’t like this as much as the rest of the album, but it’s cute.

**reddituser206** (7): "what makes so beautiful is you don't know how beautiful you are" queen of ripping off 1D

**blue\_heart\_** (5): I hate myself for not outright hating this song. Anyway, One Direction did it better.

**mokitsu** (3): blatant rip-off of one direction's iconic smash debut hit


---

**10footnotes** (5): I need you guys to understand how angry I was when I first heard this song. I was listening to the rate playlist on shuffle and couldn't see featured artists in the song title, and I was really happy that there was finally some musical variety on this album in this cheesy but cute song. Then JB comes in, the mood does a 180, and I'm pissed. I'm not a fan of him in general, but even trying to listen as objectively as possible, I don't like his contribution to the song. IMO, Carly does a much better job of delivering the lyrics than he does, and I would have loved to hear a solo version of this song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): absolutely fucking not

**Magic\_warlock0-** (10): WHAT. How did I not know they collaborated? It's a light and sweet song that complements both of their voices. Bieber is on point, and CRJ's voice is quite soothing! I can't find fault with this bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This song feels like a lot of kind of generic love and “you’re perfect” statements stitched together into a song, and it’s just kind of okay. As much as I think Justin Bieber is an unpleasant person, him promoting “Call Me Maybe” is a big part of what made Carly famous and he isn’t bad on this track, so I’m not gonna dock it points.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Even with pre testicle drop Bieber this is actually a very sweet ballad, I was surprised by it. Very calming song

**johnazoidberg-** (4): If I didn't know this was Carly and Justin, I would have assumed this was 2 Disney channel rejects doing a promotional song for a made-for-cable movie adaptation of Nicholas Sparks fan fiction.

**raicicle** (5.5): Despite the obvious bubblegum nature of the whole album, I think this is the only place where it obviously falls into ‘twee’. It’s a pretty cute tune, but it’s almost cloyingly sweet.

**patronsaintofaspies** (1): By the time the results of this rate will be revealed I'll know id Despacito broke Mariah's record or not. If it did; fuck you, Bieber. If it tied it; fuck you still, Bieber. If it didn't; how dare you fucking try, Bieber? Yeah, anyway, bad song.

**Kaylaboe** (5.5): i can’t believe carly introduced the world to this ‘justin bieber’. truly a supporter of indie artists!

letsallpoo: 

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): an iconic duet from iconic musicians

**OwenKam50** (10): This is very cute

**Elitefourbrad** (9): Okay I actually really love this duet. One of the reasons Carly got so popular is from Justin and Selena’s promotion of this album, and this actually is a nice duet. The harmonies in this song are beautiful, and Carly and Justin work side by side amazingly well. Carly has that little extra something in her voice that lets this song

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8): see hate for this on here, but I think it's a pretty solid collab

**MissyBee37** (8): Took me by surprise; lyrics are really sweet, guitar is pretty, love her vocal. I really can't stand Justin Bieber but I picked my rating based on Carly alone because I thought she deserved that lol.

**luigi\_is\_better** (7.5): i really enjoy this song because JB and CRJ flow very well together. it's very lowkey but still very sweet.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): Goddammit, the one time Justin doesn’t make a song a hit is when he performs with Carly smh

**awryj** (7): cute



**VodkaInsipido** (7): eh it’s good, but just that

**CharmingArsenal** (6.5): would be better without the biebs.

**lady\_sable** (6.5): I probably would've given this a higher score but I really don't like Justin Bieber. Also the song's kinda boring.

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): meh a let down because it's been nothing but bops so far.

**floofeh** (6): cute low tempo song and Justin's works well with Carly. Wish the song had more character though.


**ignitethephoenix** (6): Both of them sound great, but it's just too cheesy and sweet for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I want to like this, but I feel like this song goes no where

**chili\_jones** (5): :/

**nooodisaster** (5): Madame LaQueer voice EWW

**RandomDKguy** (5): Well, this proves not everything Justin Bieber touches turns into hits

**dropthehammer11** (4): Okay this one sucks. I expected a bop and got...this

**henry413** (4): I still don't know why Carly included this mediocre song in the album lol, like, if you want a hit then release it.

**mdawgig** (4): No thank you.

**OberionSynth** (4): serving that colbie caillat realness

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): it's a cute song but love is fake

**musicotic** (3.5): Bieber had wayyyy too much of the song. Doesn't fit the style of the album and it's also bad

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (3): lmao he's like 12 wtf

**cyborglilith** (3): they should let Justin carry Carly to the top 10 again with a verse on one of her new songs

**Johnnytoby** (3): oop at least we know which song is going out first

**lexarqade** (3): So nice of Carly to do charity work by featuring this no-name artist on her track.

**refrayn** (3): this should have never been published

**TeamAwesome4** (3): I'm thankful this song exists because it's likely the reason she's had any real success, but at the same time, blehhhhh...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): Sugar Rating: An Entire Bag of Domino Sugar

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): literally coffee shop music

**skyblade79** (2): ballads like this are hard to do right and this is not a success.


**therokinrolla** (2): oh

**enecks** (1): This is baaaddd. Whisper vocals? Bieber? Beautiful? Guitar? EW

**gannade** (1): what kind of ed sheeran white bread song

**MrSwearword** (1): oh great with Bieber on board, suck + suck still equals suck

**skiddos** (1): I’m completely convinced that this is the worst song Carly has ever made.

**VeganSquash** (1): the worst duet I have ever heard

**wailordfan** (1): Ew. I almost gave this the 0 it truly deserves, but I needed to make sure Call Me Maybe isn't going past day 1.

A tuneless dumpster fire of a song, "Girl At Home" tells a narrative of Taylor rejecting a man because he's already dating someone. A good message, I guess, but the song itself just isn't pleasant to listen to. At times it also feels like she's blaming that girl at home for the fact that they can't date (the fact that the hook and title are about said girl makes it weirder), which to me just shows how badly this song is written.

---

**bluehxrizon** (0): possibly the worst song ever made

**superr\_rad** (0): i hate this song, it is the bad blood of Red, thank god its a bonus track but still i cant believe taylor released this. the lyrics are shit, "if i was a stupid girl" is on the same misogynistic level as Better than Revenge to me, and she sounds horrible on this. drwhowhatwhyhow was this released?????

---

**10footnotes** (4): I hope the first day of the rate has been going well so far :eyes: (also, “I am no one’s exception / This I have previously learned” is the laziest lyric on Red and it’s really disappointing to me).

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): LISTEN UP YOU LOVEABLE FUCKERS I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU SAY THIS SONG IS PERFECT

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I am suprised that a lot of Swifties don't like this song. Sure, it's not the best song on Red and maybe the stupid girl lyric might cringe some listeners but this is still pretty catchy and it's pretty much a fuck you song to the fuccbois.

**johnazoidberg-** (7): Taylor, is this a song about a guy you like who feels the same way, but he has a grilfriend? Well damn, Tay, I have a Weird Al action figure but that doesn't matter either. Get down with OPP and get that shit, girl. You don't have any loyalty to her, he does, and if he wants to break it that's between him and her. I used to back off from women who had boyfriends and all it got me was regret. WRECK. THAT. HOME. It was already falling apart.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.5): this would be a fine deluxe addition if I was a stupid girl

**mokitsu** (4): feminist queen

**lexarqade** (2): People keep saying this song is awful. I agree.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): “My closer is gonna be a complete regression. Why? Because fuck you, that’s why!”

letsallpoo: 

**CharmingArsenal** (10): I'm giving this song a 10 as I'm so happy I don't have to sit through this album again. Sorry Taylor stans, I tried, I really tried to be positive, but this album was just boring. 1989 is better.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Queen of forcing people to stay faithful

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): DRAG. HIM. SIS.

**OwenKam50** (10): displays her insecurity well

**TeamAwesome4** (10): Solidarity, motherfucker

**luigi\_is\_better** (9)'s comment kinda got fucked up somehow: call a  lose my  you're about to lose your . ((it seems like this song is divisive but i love it.))

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): This song gets shat on a lot. The lyrics are not her best, sure, but I still really like this song.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): I can appreciate the lightheartedness of this tune; it makes me think of if Carly picked up her guitar again.

**eklxtreme** (8): vocals pretty good here

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Taylor, the queen of telling guys no!

**Piccprincess** (8): I've been in this position before, on both sides :( It's not fun

**TheKOg77** (8): I don't get the hate, it's decent

**zamomattel** (7.5): After a long slog of poor songs, here stands a minor bop. Well done Swift.

**agentofscranton** (7): it sucks that this is the song that the deluxe version ends on - not counting the demo/acoustic versions - because this is such a clear step down in quality compared to the rest of the album

**Leixander** (7): KAYLOR!! Did Taylor write this song for her girlfriend? Discuss!!!!!!

**mdawgig** (7): Forgettable and filler-y.

**MrSwearword** (7): at least she tried something interesting again…about seven tracks too late

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6.5): I dig it, but I'm getting a little bit of Wildest Dreams in this. Is it just me, am I crazy?

**fifthchevron** (6): Was great until the "I might've done it if I hadn't been cheated on before" like gurl...you don't have to have been cheated on before you realise it's wrong

**OberionSynth** (6): queen of calling people out for cheating

**supersecrettest** (6): ok so I like this chorus better than other ones but I still don’t like it that much.

**wailordfan** (6): Ew. It isn't as bad as I typically complain it is, but its melody is painful and clumpy, and too high for her to sing. It just oozes TS1, and not the good half of TS1.

**dropthehammer11** (5.5): End the album on a sleepy note. Of course

**enecks** (5): This is like an above-average Taylor ripoff.

**raicicle** (5): This song sounds like a meme. It’s kinda like Carly’s “I Know You Have a Girlfriend”, but not actually fun.

**refrayn** (5): this song goes on for SO LONG WTF

**chili\_jones** (4): cmon tay you're better than this song.

**lady\_sable** (4): Doesn't belong on this album at all; it's a lot less mature and overall kind of a mess tbh.

**MissyBee37** (4): On an album I gave almost all 10s, this song is a low moment and one of my least favorite Taylor songs, period. I don't like the lyrics or tone. Or the monotonous chorus.

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Not as bad as everybody told me it was, but the message is pretty annoying and the melody seems like a nursery rhyme at times. It isn't as unbearable as bad blood. Will this end up last?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): cheesy

**dirdbub** (3): can I turn this album off yet

**islimp** (3): Filler all the way lol

**jess\_22** (3): SO REPETITIVE smh

**piplup123** (3): worst song she’s ever put out

**Qwilphish** (3): ...and it's over

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): lmao

**cyborglilith** (2): No.

**henry413** (2): Just cut it from the album Taylor.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2): no

**strawberryswing1** (1): If I want to look at you Imma fucking look, Taylor

Extremely dull and cliché. It doesn't help that it comes so late in the album where we've heard this kind of sappy lovey-dovey song so many times already. Not does it help that it's arguably the worst. Thankfully the album picks up again after this, but it's a definitive bump in the road that should have been left off the album in all honesty.

---
**OwenKam50** (11): Boi this is beaut, the emotion + the acoustics

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (0): This is a fitting name, cause it's dull as shit.

**PuggleMaster** (0): really boring

**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): this song legit made me drowsy

---

**SpanKKy1** (4): the name of my autobiography

**rickikardashian** (6): That’s how I describe myself

**bluehxrizon** (10) remembers what life was like last year: this used to be my go-to sad song in seventh grade so i have a soft spot for it :emofish:

**lady\_sable** (8): I know that a lot of people hate this song and I am here to say that they are objectively wrong and this song is beautiful.

**twat\_brained** (3): I was listening to this on a road trip but I didn't feeling like falling asleep so I saved it for another day. UPDATE: I didn't fall asleep but I didn't really find myself paying attention to this one either. I can see this going out on day 1.

**johnazoidberg-** (2): I'd like to thank Taylor for making the title of this song my feelings about it. Taylor shouldn't bore me. 1989 didn't bore me. This just isn't special. I get it, she was 22 and heartbroken, but she sounds like every heartbroken 22 year old I've ever met and I'm actively trying not to meet more.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): Ugh, this is probably the only song on Red I didn't really like at all. It's.....so boring and not a lot of replayable value into this. Lyrical wise, it's pretty bland. I feel like Taylor is just trying to make this entire song that has this deeper meaning when it's basically Taylor writing every deep word she can think of. This song is like the worst stereotype of a typical Taylor break-up song and I know Taylor can write better than this. Ugh I want this song to end already.

**MissyBee37** (7): This song is fine but boring compared to way better sad, slow love songs by Taylor. Why would I listen to "Sad Beautiful Tragic" when there's "Last Kiss"? Doesn't hold a candle, in my book. I almost always skip it.

**VodkaInsipido** (6): [such a shame](https://media.giphy.com/media/BwRzjeqPnC6Dm/giphy.gif)

letsallpoo: 
**awryj** (10): I hate the title but the song itself is so soothing

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): OKAY THIS ONE I CAN’T FINISH LISTENING TO IT WITHOUG CRYING “WHILE YOU WERE ON A TRAIN”

**musicotic** (9): Beautiful

**skargardin** (9): A mellow track about the ups and downs of falling in love. I can dig it.

**Piccprincess** (8.5): This album is a beautiful magic love affair. The other albums are a sad beautiful tragic love affair.

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): Another experimental sound. A waltz. Drags on a little bit but still pretty.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): A sad beautiful, yet also a tragic ballad from Taylor, she can do better.


**OberionSynth** (8): taylor describing my life with her song titles

**therokinrolla** (7.5): besides stay stay stay, this is the only song on this album i just dont see as “great”. Idk why. Its a nice ballad, but for the most part its the third adjective


**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): nice little ballad. Gets a little bland and boring towards the end since it's Taylor singing but it's a decent song.

**10footnotes** (6.5): “You’ve got your demons, and darling, they all look like me” is a great line.

**BreezySeason** (6): Get rid of the middle word and you describe Taylor's comeback

**CharmingArsenal** (6): Sounds like something that would play during the aftermath of a break-up on a teen drama show. I can picture the sad girl with immaculate hair and no-run eyeliner sad on her bed that her 3 episode romance has come to an end.

**eklxtreme** (6): she didn't quite capture the sweet folky vibe that well and I wish the lyrics were more interesting

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): This isn't a song I would skip, but, IDK, it's kind of...boring. The subdued production doesn't really work well with Taylor's vocals, IMO.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): “I need a slower song, because the last two were above 50 BPM.”

**wailordfan** (6): Indeed, it is sad and tragic, but there is definitely some beauty in it, but not enough to carry it.

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): Tragic

**MrSwearword** (5): the chorus is poorly written but at least the verses are as vivid as they are earnest. The sound however is just as droll as the other songs.

**supersecrettest** (5): I liked this better than some of the other slower songs on this album, but I still didn’t love it.

**dropthehammer11** (4.5): Please stop putting me to sleep Taylor, I have two more albums to rate

**jess\_22** (4): there's nothing particularly memorable about this

**luigi\_is\_better** (4): drags way too much

**mdawgig** (4): Boring. Needs more "there" there. Filler.

**Qwilphish** (4): Funny how Taylor named the song after my opinion of it, not sure why she added "beautiful" to it though.


**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): This song isn't that bad but it really drags in length

**zamomattel** (4): FEELS SO LONG AND TAKES TOO LONG TO GET ANYWHERE ANYWAY :((((

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): titles that describe the song

**cyborglilith** (3): her singing is sad, the production is beautiful, and the title is tragic

**enecks** (3): Two of these adjectives describe the song

**skyblade79** (3): snooze

**mokitsu** (2): Snoozer Boring Tragic

**refrayn** (2): i had to listen to this several times because i kept forgetting it was playing

**VeganSquash** (2): yawn

**bwc222** (1.5): two of these adjectives describe the album as a whole (hint: it's not the middle one)

**Magic\_warlock0-** (1): My sentiments exactly about this song, minus the beautiful. This is sleep-inducing.

I only remember this song because its opening instrumental was used as a jingle for a Spotify ad that would always play after every fucking song back in like 2012 or something. It's a cutesy song I guess but honestly that part where she sings about how she'll throw her phone at her boyfriend and he has to wear a football helmet is kinda creepy and not cute at all.

---

**blue\_heart\_** (11): Now, I'm going to have to explain this choice of 11, because I've been dragged for it repeatedly. In my comments for All Too Well and I Almost Do (which I predict won't be out yet) I refer to a time in my life when I wasn't so happy. And then came this song. Happy, careless, fun. This song, almost on its own, affected me deeply. And it affected my music. I began listening to more happy songs like this. I think that was a big part in becoming the happier guy I am now, and for that I give it my 11. And also because that's so fun.

**dropthehammer11** (0): Oh my god this is terrible. This sounds like the background to a Tasty Facebook video. This sounds like the music Sharon puts on in the car for little Winthrop on her way to mother-son yoga

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I thought the beginning of this song was a Spotify commercial. Also I hate the voice she uses it this song it's super annoying. To be honest this whole song is pretty annoying.

**lexarqade** (0): The instrumental reminds me of Apple iPhone commercials. Aside this is really just awful.

**mokitsu** (0): terrible, i'm not joking, one of the worst songs i've listened to

**Raykel** (0): This is what inspired that annoying ass bell over ukulele song that every beauty vlogger uses on youtube.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): holy shit I hate this with everything in me I cannot tell you how bad this is

**TragicKingdom1** (0): The instrumental for this sounds like it should accompany a YouTube makeup tutorial.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yee Haw

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): ["I threw my ~~phone~~ shoe across the room at you"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duLds-TZMGw)

**johnazoidberg-** (9): This sounds like an Apple commercial. Like, I was worried that Spotify canceled my premium. But no, this is Taylor trying her hand at being the manic pixie dream girl with a ukelele and somehow pulls it off. This sounds like having a crush so I'd like to thank Taylor for reminding me that I never had the courage to ask out Mallory or Emily and now Emily is married to some Russian guy. I appreciate it

**wailordfan** (9): People really didn't like this song based off of what I've seen, but I really love this song because you can honestly hear her happiness as she sings. People tell you during phone interviews that you can hear when someone is smiling while talking, and this song totally proves that. You can hear Taylor grinning from ear to ear during every part of this song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is nice, but it really just sounds like the sort of song that would play in a video montage of you and your classmates during graduation. And the football helmet line is kind of...cringey, IMO. One of Taylor's last attempts at pandering to country fans, I guess?

**Nfranklin50** (10): Easily the most fun song ever made

---

"What does this song remind you of?":

**rickikardashian** (5): Taylor was watching any DIY slime video, heard [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZWLwz9_7o0) and got inspired

**Leixander** (10): Sounds like a Spotify commercial like others will probably say. In a good way.

**nikitasd** (3): Instrumental gives me Spotify ad vibes, kinda cute but incredibly cheesy at the same time

**therokinrolla** (6): it kinda reminds me of Jessie from LAP except not iconique so stay stay stay away

**gannade** (5.5): This plagiarized Ingrid Michaelson's sound and then made it bad.

**cyborglilith** (8): i hear that intro in every happy facebook video ever

**dirdbub** (6.5): WHY AM I SUDDENLY TRANSPORTED INTO A CHRISTIAN MOM’S VLOG ABOUT HOW TO GET AWAY WITH YOUR ALCOHOLISM AT YOUR CHILD’S MICRO SOCCER GAME

**triptoyourheart** (4): Sounds like the background music you hear in those 1 minute or less cooking videos on YouTube.

**skiddos** (3): Serving Buzzfeed video background music.

**bluehxrizon** (2): this is like the soundtrack to a honda pilot ad

**islimp** (3.5): It sounds like YT vlog background music....I mean it's fine but meh

**awryj** (8.5): It sounds like a commercial

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): “This is gonna be a Target commercial song.”

**Johnnytoby** (2): target commercial vibes

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): This song sounds like it should be in a Target commercial but it's kind of weirdly sweet and actually listenable even if it's a bit bland. I'll take it

**callmetidle** (5): This is Target music

**enecks** (6): This seems like a meh Disney song.

**fifthchevron** (1): It's like a Meghan Trainor song "you laugh at me when I'm mad but you carry heavy things so you can stay!" WHAT.

**OberionSynth** (3): don't really like this song but it makes me think of lilo and stitch for some reason so it's got that going for it

**animefangrant62** (7): Instrumentation sounds like an advert for grammar software, which is hard not to notice.

**reddituser206** (3): anyone else have the sudden urge to check their credit score for free?

letsallpoo: **BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): IT’S SCIENTIFICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HATE THIS SONG @ ME IDFC “DAYDREAMING ABOUT REAL LOVE”

**Piccprincess** (10): I can't believe how happy Taylor sounds here!


**Elitefourbrad** (9): A happy go-lucky song about wanting him to stay. Taylor is great now!

**musicotic** (9): Cute!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Honestly? This is adorable.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (8.5): cheers up any time I listen to it. As Taylor says, it's so fun

**Damoojo** (8): It's just so damn catchy and it makes me smile lol.

**lady\_sable** (8): This song is unfairly hated and I know yall flops will do it dirty.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (8): Light-hearted and cute! Folksy feeling, nice storytelling here! It's a nice to hear a song about playing out an argument in a nice way because the two love each other!

**poppinmmolly** (8): It's slightly CRINGE but cute nonetheless.

**PuggleMaster** (8): a cute song nothing more

**skargardin** (8): Yes it's pure country and I'm a sucker for it.

**superr\_rad** (8): fml i love this. it reminds me of my mom and her boyfriend of 11 or 15 years. but i can see objectively this song isnt that great. but it makes me happy

**supersecrettest** (8): This song makes me nostalgic for a relationship I never had, and I can enjoy that for a while, but eventually it makes me sad. :/

**TeamAwesome4** (8): Cute :)

**zamomattel** (8): Kind of immature sounding, but very sweet all the same

**chili\_jones** (7.5): this song is! a! cute! bop!

**floofeh** (7.5): I love an "imperfect" recording, like Kesha laughing in "Woman" and this is another lovely example. Simple, but I like how it makes Taylor more accessible.

**twat\_brained** (7.5): For me, most of the charm of this song comes in knowing that it could suit Carly quite well. That being said, I'm still somewhat averse to country, as was evidenced by the Disney/Nick rate.

**10footnotes** (7): Popheads hates fun, so this is probably gonna go out too early.

**OwenKam50** (7): Corny af, but a fun song

**CharmingArsenal** (6.5): I like the change of pace, but the lyrics are not something I feel the need to sing along to or relate to. My gay ass never had a chance with a football player.

**eklxtreme** (6.5): cute catchy indie pop vibe but the lyrics are kinda dumb

**luigi\_is\_better** (6.5): unpopular opinion time but this song is a better version of 22 for me: a silly funny song that just wants you to dance. still not great tho

**MrSwearword** (6): how fucked up was this relationship she was in? It is much too manic for my sensibilities.

**VodkaInsipido** (6): cute but just that

**mdawgig** (5): Twee to the point of absurdity. This is like a 12-year-old's idea of a relationship.

**refrayn** (5): cute but corny

**angusaditus** (3): This is giving me kids song tease

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2.5): i hate the sound of ukulele lol

**jess\_22** (2): T R A S H

**BionicFunhouse** (1): Her twang is particularly annoying here

**Qwilphish** (1): Was one of the candidates for my 0. Taylor sounds so dumb and the chorus is so boring and uninspired. Are there really people who actually prefer this Taylor over 1989 Taylor?

**strawberryswing1** (1): Taylor with her A+ lyrics. Oh god that fake country voice why Taylor stop it.

**VeganSquash** (1): the ukulele is annoying as fuck, and this sounds like a theme song to a sitcom. Definitely the worst of the album

**BreezySeason** (9): Queen of it being in her pulse, her chest

Y'all did this song wrong. Yes the metaphor is heavy-handed and is honestly kind of stupid but it's such a fun, well-produced disco explosion of a pop song that I can't help but love it. It's one of the highlights off of *Kiss* for me, and I can't believe it's so low.

---

**10footnotes** (4.5): You know how people say a joke dies when you explain it? That, but with metaphors.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): A cute bop but isn't wearing a guitar string as a wedding ring a bit....dangerous cause it might cut your blood circulation in the finger? Idk science.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): The most bizarrely conceived song on the album. I’m not entirely sure what the central image of the guitar string as a wedding ring is supposed to convey to me, I get that she’s saying she’d be satisfied with anything because she loves this person but why a guitar string? What’s up with the fish and bird metaphor? Like, they’re different? But then what does that have to do with the guitar? I do like how it prominently features guitar, that’s a fun touch. As with many of the songs on this album, the last minute of just repeating the chorus over and over again could have been cut.

**mokitsu** (6): is carly so poor now that she can't buy a wedding ring :-(

**supersecrettest** (10): I really like the chorus of this a lot, but at the beginning it’s so quiet and then all of the sudden it get’s really loud and that throws me off but I like it.

**cyborglilith** (10): I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THIS BOP (too bad her singing on this track is kind of trashy)

**Cryomatic** (4): in which Carly is determined to overexplain this metaphor as much as she possibly can

**lady\_sable** (9): Okay this is really cute

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): We love a bop.

**mdawgig** (8): Twee and cute but kinda forgettable.

**rickikardashian** (8): The song is unintentionally hilarious and so cheesy, but I love it so much god

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): lol the lyrics are so dumb but this goes hard

**CharmingArsenal** (7.5): Lyrics seem a bit... teenager.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): super cheesy but it's a cute bop ngl

**zamomattel** (7.5): Such a stupid concept but a bop nevertheless

**Qwilphish** (7): I don't know the logistics of forming a guitar string into a wedding ring, but it sounds like more effort than its worth.

**RandomDKguy** (7): G-String Wedding Ring

**superr\_rad** (7): ok but who would waste guitar string for that

**Kaylaboe** (6.5): cute i guess

**skargardin** (6.5): Please don’t wear it like that, dear Carly.

**johnazoidberg-** (6): Good news everyone! I just checked Amazon and you can get a pack of guitar strings for less than $5 so Carly can throw these lyrics into the trash where they belong!

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): very filler-y, but still enjoyable.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6): It’s okay, not too special but it’s a sweet little relationship song. BTW, does it sound like Carly is talking about her HO BODY? Is it just me?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Sugar Rating: The DVD Copy of Season 1 of Full House Dipped in Chocolate Fondue

**dropthehammer11** (5.5): Carly what the fuck are you talking about in this chorus? Like srsly what's going on

**jess\_22** (4): so much cringe

**Leixander** (4): Forgettable but cute.

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): No, no, this is average at most, possibly below. The chorus is super annoying and Carly's vocals here are bad. The 'do you know what I mean? You make my heart sing' line is cute, though.

**Raykel** (4): Her voice sounds off with the rest of the track and I'm not knowledgeable enough in music to tell you why but I just hear it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): nah

**therokinrolla** (4): this song doesnt flow. Its just not good^TM

**twat\_brained** (4): If anyone has this as a wedding song then please reevaluate your life.

**wailordfan** (4): The song is kinda obnoxious and cliche. Not like a good trendy cliche, but more like a throw up in your mouth kinda cliche.

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): wyd

**Elitefourbrad** (3): Why is she comparing a guitar string to a wedding ring?

**ignitethephoenix** (3): These lyrics...no words. Girl, if he gives you a wedding ring guitar string you should leave him because he's a cheap dumb fuck. I don't care if you think it represents a heartstring. It's not cute.

**skiddos** (3): I’m sorry Carly, but this is really tacky.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2.5): how did she not realize how fucking dumb this sounds while in the studio

Who the fuck wrote this tracklist? Why is this absolute *whore* anthem positioned between two sappy ballads? I guess it goes kind hard, but it's too trashy for me to enjoy, and its placing just feels awkard. It's like if you tried to play "Gimmie More" at your aunt's funeral. It's as awkward as when that nightclub played "Til It Happens To You".

---

**dropthehammer11** (11): SLUT BOP OF THE DECADE. ABSOLUTE BANGER. This is prob gonna go out day 1 but whatever I'm sticking to my heart

**Leixander** (0): NO! Don't do this again Ariana. This song is a cringe-fest from start to end.

**SpanKKy1** (0): get your hands off me sister

**twat\_brained** (0): I wasn't sure what to give my 0 heading into this rate, but I think I've found it. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Iggy Azalea is not the worst rap feature on *My Everything*. Forgive me, Amethyst, for I have unfairly judged you. Collab with Meghan Trainwreck though, and I'll never listen to another song of yours again.

---

**mokitsu** (10): hoe anthem, it took me a while to realize she doesn't say "n--- need love, baby give it to me"

**triptoyourheart** (9): I can never not hear "Picture me eating bacon, n***as get in line" in the first verse, but anyway this is such a filthy bop.

**nooodisaster** (7): "Not a good enough reason to use the word 'n*****'." But a bop

---

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): stop

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3.5): no

**dirdbub** (3): yah wat tha fuck

**superr\_rad** (4): delete this ari

**mudkip1** (1): /u/letsallpoo

**gannade** (1): only underaged twinks would think this even remotely qualify as a hoe anthem

**lulbady** (9): i love i good ho anthem

---

**awryj** (10): I'm getting Pussycat Dolls flashbacks and I'm okay with it EDIT: After my second listen, I must admit that it's a 10/10 bop, good job ari

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (3): this sounds like a pussycat dolls reject lol

**skyblade79** (8): it’s like the pussycat dolls with actual talent. Ferg does great in this!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song is probably gonna be out on Day 1 so I am giving this a 10. It's funny to see Ariana trying to be cute and sexy at the same time. I give A+ for effort.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I really like this song but it’s such a tonal whiplash between the songs directly before and after it. It’s sandwiched between two of the most emotional ballads on the album, and yet it’s a trashy hoe bop. Oh, but what a hoe bop it is. I love how candid the lyrics are, there’s some really great imagery in here. It’s one of those songs that I think really sounds like a dirty, fun time. It bounces up and down, she’s breathless and repeating words, she reaches orgasmic highs… basically it sounds like she’s having sex and I love songs that mimic the pattern of a lay. A$AP Ferg sounded great, he’s bouncing off the walls and his ridiculous lyrics perfectly suit the song. “You got the cake, can I put the candle on it?” is such a Line^(TM).

letsallpoo: 

**OberionSynth** (10): jesus christ lrn2enunciate but its ok i still twerk to this song

**strawberryswing1** (10): This is such a fun little hoe bop and I’mma need you guys to stop dragging it! And I think ASAP’s feature is good.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9.5): That second verse had me clutching my pearls. That doesn't get talked about enough.

**bluehxrizon** (9): this songs placement between two piano ballads is so strange but it lowkey works

**enecks** (9): I love shamelessness in pop. This beat is wild.

**Johnnytoby** (9): girl needs to enunciate

**lady\_sable** (9): this is such a banger omfg


**MrSwearword** (9): A$AP Ferg is trash, but this is a nice bop and a half.

**skargardin** (9): A$AP felt a little bit too weird at first, but by the end I was bopping hard to this.

**skiddos** (9): I love that instrumental part from 1:57 to 2:07.

**CharmingArsenal** (8.5): I can look past the lyrics since this song is just fun and dancey.

**johnazoidberg-** (8.5): Queen on consensual touching

**musicotic** (8.5): Great song bad feature

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): The transition between the last song and this one is not good, but I'm too busy dropping ass to this ho anthem, I wonder/hope if Ariana and Ferg fucked in the making of this song :fancyglasses:

**BreezySeason** (8): ITS YA BIRTH-DAY I actually like Ferg on this even though he really feels out of place

**fifthchevron** (8): This score is solely for the iconic second verse.

**jess\_22** (8): lol I genuinely love this song, but Ariana, honey, please enunciate

**supersecrettest** (8): Feels trashy, but I’m a slut for slut jams.

**VodkaInsipido** (8): I’m HERE for Fergenstein making it into the mainstream. *It’s your birthday* might be one of the best hooks on the whole album. Buy Still Striving on iTunes.

**blue\_heart\_** (7.5): This is the better sexy song on this album. The rap verse sounds awkward but I gave Gary Lightbody a 9.5 so I have to be a bit forgiving.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): you can't not love the fact that this collab exists. it's not that memorable but it's definitely fun.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Great production that was ruined by bad and basic lyrics.

**PuggleMaster** (7.5): ferg ruins this for me

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Not really liking the rap part, but Ariana is great here!

**Qwilphish** (6.5): This song is a bop, but it's unfortunately a messy bop that goes all over the place without ever settling in one place. Ferg doesn't help with this at all, but his part is so funny hahahaha "It's yah birthday"

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6): The chorus kills the momentum this song would have had. Repeating an uninspired lyric over and over is not a way to get me to like the song. Ferg is actually good here, and the beat is bopping, I just can’t overlook those issues.

**OwenKam50** (6): as if kpop was in english

**rickikardashian** (6): Why does this song sound like a Fifth Harmony song?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I love A$AP Ferg, but his presence here is weird at best. It’s a collab I really didn’t need and I don’t think the product works well imo.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): who decided to put this between two ballads

**zamomattel** (5.5): Ariana Grande, tonight you put your Hands On Me, but I just wanted you to take them off. I'm sorry my dear but you are up for elimination.

**cyborglilith** (5): lmao that rap part verse is unintelligible trash, and the rest does NOT make up for it

**10footnotes** (4.5): The “it’s your birthday” parts are really annoying. In general, this song just has too much going on.

**mdawgig** (4): E-N-U-N-C-I-A-T-E please. Total filler, but the production is good.

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Wow, this sounds like a mediocre RnB copy of a song from Blackout! Her singing is so bad here to the point where I actually thought she was singing a slur at one point. Ariana, you've officially disappointed me.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): I continue struggling to get into ASAP Ferg, and Ariana's contribution doesn't do much either. Low point in the album.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Ari? Doing a hoe anthem? Sorry, it just doesn't work.

**Piccprincess** (3): I'd like this song to get it's hands off of me and Calvin's hands on me

**TeamAwesome4** (3): What the fuck A$AP Ferg.  What the fuck.

**therokinrolla** (3): so i was kinda hard to adjust to this after the lovely song that is Just a Little Bit of Your Heart. And yea it, just, doesn’t fit. A bad feature and repetitive lyrics and im just kinda :deadbanana:

**VeganSquash** (3): I would like this song if Ariana did it solo. Some of her features are just trash

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): lmao this Paradiso Girls b-side was a choice

deleted: We all know about it, and we all see it. It's obvious. Nobody ever wants to admit it, but it's there.

People on this subreddit hate Taylor Swoft.

The first question to ask: why? Why do you all hate her? The obvious answer: you didn't watch her in her prime.
Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 14 or 15 years old. That means you only got into being brokenhearted in the last couple years. So you never watched T Swizzle in her prime.

And because you didn't watch her in her prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into chart success and analyzing rate scores. But here's the thing: Real talent isn't played on Excel spreadsheets. The moment somebody brings up "Is this her Artpop?" or "Snek" I know they know nothing about Becky.

Tailor's game cannot be encapsulated by one stat. She's the second greatest white girl ever, and one of the 5 best white girls to ever sip a latte in a starbucks.

So when I hear somebody say that Carly Ray Jepson is better than Taylor Swift, I laugh, because I know that anybody who watched Tayler in her prime wouldn't think that. Unlike you guys, I have watched music videos for a significant amount of time, so I know that Taylur is better.

You might be jealous of Taelor's 9 grammies, or jealous of her status as the greatest victim in history, or whatever. Unless you're a Country music fan who listened in the late 2000's, or a Pop music fan who listened in the 2010s, you don't know what real, cold-blooded, killer instinct, will-to-win music looks like. And there's nothing wrong with that.

This sub would make you think that Saylor isn't even a top 100 player ever.

So don't go spouting bullshit about players you didn't watch. Talk about your "greats" like Carlee roy Jetson The Best in the World™, but leave the Tarloy talk to the adults. Fair?

It's like you're giving up before it all goes wrong

I've been told but I still really like the feeling

I've been away, your dick was way too long

I, I, I wanna come wherever you are

I, I, I wanna mmm wherever you are

I, I, I wanna succ whatever you are

You say dick's

A fragile thing

Made of sponge

But I think

Your dick is a muscle

Your dick is a muscle

You gotta work it out

Make it stronger

Plow for me

Just a little longer

Your dick is a muscle

Your dick is a muscle

If I could turn my ass around

Missionary where you are right now

Ride your dick into the sky

Hope that it'll light up your testeyes

**Magic\_warlock0-** (8): Queen of biology lessons! I like that this is a slow song and really highlights the emotion packed into the song. Loving the piano and the lowkey presence of CRJ’s voice.

**mdawgig** (8): A total 90s throwback jam. Queen of anatomy class.

**VeganSquash** (7): queen of anatomy

**rickikardashian** (6.5): I HATE THE WORD MUSCLE. WHY THE FUCK IS IT PRONOUNCED AS “MUSSEL”, IT SHOULD BE SAID LIKE “MUST COLE” BUT YOU DECIDE TO IGNORE THERE’S A FUCKING “C” AND GO AHEAD AND SAY IT IN THE UGLIEST WAY POSSIBLE.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I actually really like this song. It’s definitely the coolest title on the album, when I first saw it I was just like “what?” but I get what she’s saying here. Your heart is a muscle, and so you need to “work it out, make it stronger,” which is a very good metaphor to describe dealing with struggles in a relationship. It’s not always going to be good, but it’s the hard times that are going to make you stronger. It’s a very interesting central image, not one that I would have expected from Carly. Not entirely sure why she keeps mentioning the plane but I still think it’s a very cool song.

**Piccprincess** (6.5): You know what else is a muscle? :janet:

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (7): your dick is a muscle

**lexarqade** (5): Carly needs to take high school biology again because I'm pretty sure the heart is not a muscle.

**OwenKam50** (6): Your heart is an organ*

**Elitefourbrad** (9): My heart was broken by this incredible bop!

**lulbady** (9): Really nice closer song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Not 100% sold on the lyricism but it sounds really good.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): The piano part of the song literally reminds me of A Thousand Miles.

**eklxtreme** (8): gives me some sweet 2000s vibes

**enecks** (8): Pleasant forgettable pop

**supersecrettest** (8): Ok I had always avoid this song but somehow I just listened to it and it’s not as bad as I imagined.

**jess\_22** (7.5): this exceeded my expectations, that piano is perfection

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): I feel like some of these songs start to get a bit samey? like they're still good but they kind of melt into one another

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (7): great hook but I find the lyrics truly forgettable.

**lady\_sable** (7): Pretty, but kinda forgettable honestly

**luigi\_is\_better** (7): invented biology

**skiddos** (7): This gives me early JoJo vibes.

**superr\_rad** (7): that piano in the beginning was kinda sus to me but this turned out to be a soft bop that i wanted to keep listening to

**ComeOnAndSlang** (6.5): music is good but I just do NOT like the cheesy lyrics

**musicotic** (6.5): The vocals are flat out bad in the verses

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Sugar Rating: Cotton Candy Wrapped Around A Pound of Jellybeans

**therokinrolla** (6): mmhmm

**twat\_brained** (6): Eh, it's kinda cute but it's quite forgettable.

**10footnotes** (5.5): <insert too-real joke about lack of romance and exercise here>

**floofeh** (5): this song felt like padding the album. The piano melody in the background was cute though.

**skargardin** (5): Another bland ballad, even the line “Your Heart is a Muscle” is almost unbearable.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): Schoolhouse Rock is shaking

**zamomattel** (5): I didn't trash Kelly Clarkson in the other rate to hear similar shit from queen Carly

**blue\_heart\_** (4.5): This piano reminds me of something but I don't know what... Anyway Carly, I think we know. At least Warm Blood doesn't apply to every animal with blood.

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): The line "your heart is a muscle" is so clumsy that it drags down the rest of the song.

**MrSwearword** (4): this song is the equivalent of muscular atrophy. Like if a motivational poster was condensed into a song. NEXT

**strawberryswing1** (4): I knew this song was going to be bad by the title

**cyborglilith** (3): Notes are too high to be on Red, so it had to be filler for Kiss. /s

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2.5): mmm too dramatic for me

**patronsaintofaspies** (2): Yes, Carly, I took 4th grade science. I know my heart is a muscle. By the way, stop making ballads, unless All That counts as a ballad. Thanks.

**refrayn** (2): i am not sure what this song is saying either

**wailordfan** (2): The title is just kinda the cringiest thing I've heard, and should've been a Halsey song tbh.

**fifthchevron** (1): U think Carly?

**skyblade79** (1): this is the worst name ever literally I want to die. These are some of the worst lyrics ever

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/T4AutcVN)

**BreezySeason** (7): Queen of having all kinds of choices

---
It's cute, and it serves as a precursor to "Favorite Colour." I remember writing about that song a year ago, namely about how Carly has a tendency to incorporate somewhat grotesque imagery into her music. That's at play here too, since objectively speaking the idea of melting into someone is a bit gross. The song isn't really interesting aside from that.

---

**enecks** (3): QUEEN OF GLOBAL WARMING WHEN WILL YOUR FAVES

---

im sorry but who

**CharmingArsenal** (7): I'm SO GLAD this was not a Modern English cover, I hadn't heard this before the rate so I was afraid it might be. That said, it was just okay. I feel like the bonus tracks are really going to hurt the average for Kiss.

**NapsAndNetflix** (5): Modern English outpeaked

**MrSwearword** (4.5): Modern English did it better, so fuck off

**Magic\_warlock0-** (3): Modern English called, Carly, and they did it muuuuuuch better. Can we stop this song?

---

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): the wicked witch of the west could never

**Piccprincess** (7.5): He makes me melt in my pants

**OberionSynth** (7): queen of being ice cream

**twat\_brained** (7): I put down a comment for this but I lost it and I forget how it goes so just have this.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Melting with Carly actually sounds like fun, but I’d rather melt some cheese for some nachos to have with this.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (3): while I don’t understand poo’s obsession with random japanese tracks, I want to thank God (Carly) that this wasn’t in the parent album <jk love you, poo 😘> [*editor's note: fuck you*]

letsallpoo: 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): omg this is so good what is it doing in this trash album

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Wow. This is amazing.

**VeganSquash** (9.5): see, this is a good song. Nice and chill.

**eklxtreme** (9): it has a great instrumental and a cool build up

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I was expecting another boring song, but I get this song that reminds me of cascada? shook.

**henry413** (8.5): The chorus is heavenly.

**luigi\_is\_better** (8): this is actually so good? i wish it was avaliable on spotify.

**Qwilphish** (8): This is so pre-2012 Disney pop, but I'm still here for it.

**supersecrettest** (8): It’s really cute, but it lacks the touch most of the other tracks on the album have. Or maybe I’m nostalgic for the rest of the album but just not this one because it’s a bonus track.

**treesoutsidemywindow** (8): Not really a comment, more of a question, but is Melt With You not on Spotify? It's actually one of the songs on Kiss I like the best. The same goes for Almost Said It

**zamomattel** (8): THIS IS TOP HALF WHY IS IT A BONUS TRACK

**awryj** (7.5): It would work better as a ballad I think

**mdawgig** (7.5): Very catchy and well-written, but the production is a bit of a letdown.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Sugar Rating: Candy Store But Built With Toblerone Instead of I-Beams

**therokinrolla** (6.5): this song title is gross. It reminds me of this clip from family guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtlQdyhHYUA

**dropthehammer11** (6): not bad at all, nice tune. The prechorus is amazing but it needs a legit drop

**skargardin** (6): It was an ordeal to find the original version. Let’s just say that it wasn’t worth the search.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): Why am I so annoyed. Like it's just annoying for some reason.

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): When are they making Sky High 2?

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Make this slightly less boring and give it to somebody with a radically different vocal technique. It gets an eight, maybe a nine. But Mariah's song 'Melt Away' is better.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): I'm not going to remember what this sounds like by the time the rate reveal comes around.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (4): kind of forgettable tbh

**Leixander** (4): Forgettable.

**mokitsu** (4): very forgettable.....

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): good production but kinda anticlimactic

**10footnotes** (3): A deluxe track that screams "deluxe track." Someone sure made a conscious choice to use these lyrics.

**jess\_22** (3): this builds up to nothing, the chorus is so boring

**cyborglilith** (1): the lyrics and chorus are laughably bad, but i need to save my 0 for something else

**BreezySeason** (7): Queen of not being able to stop the (e)motion

---
This just sounds really...bad. Carly is an off-beat chipmunk in the verses, and the whole build up and drop just sounds so dated. It feels so unrealized.

---

**therokinrolla** (7.5): SHE SAID EMOTION IN THIS SONG CARLY THE FUTURE PREDICTING WITCH!!!

**superr\_rad** (8): interesting flow...i thought my computer was messing up lol. CANT STOP EMOTION....a foreshadowing

**triptoyourheart** (10): Queen of predicting her next album!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): My favorite part of this song is that syncopated intro and the stacatto prechorus, I was kind of tepid on this one at first but after a few listens it sunk in. I just wish there was more to it, that drop feels like it’s compensating from the underdeveloped lyrics.

**Piccprincess** (9): My lust for Calvin

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Sugar Rating: A Railgun With Licorice as Ammunition

**henry413** (6): Her voice basically cracks during the whole song lol.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): Did Carly have a sore throat while recording her vocals in the song?

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): i know this album was rushed but this song literally sounds like they had like 2 hours until the submission deadline and needed one last song

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I swear if this song (and some of the other songs) had different production, they would be so much better. Carly deserves better than songs like this with generic dubstep production. But this is 2012's fault for the stupid dubstep trend.

**awryj** (9): the synth melody during the drop is literally the whole drop of Closer

**dropthehammer11** (5): This sounds like a song you hear in Minecraft Let's Plays

letsallpoo: 

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): hoo boy the BEAT this is one of the few EDM-ish songs on this record and I love it

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): holy shit this album is so good.

**fifthchevron** (9): Should've been a single

**lady\_sable** (9): This sounds so 80s and I love it

**Qwilphish** (9): That intro and synthy chorus are everything.

**supersecrettest** (9): Not the best song, but still a really good one. The verses are great, chorus is probably the weak part.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (8.5): I really like this, it’s probably the most club beat song on the album, and I’m a sucker for the rhythm and the lyrics

**mdawgig** (8.5): Few things have ever felt more right. I can't stop the motion, Queen Carly!

**zamomattel** (8.5): THAT is a beat though, lesbihonest

**musicotic** (8): Certified bop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): this sounds like it could have been a hit?

**eklxtreme** (7): the synth drop is nice but dated. the song kinda feels messy and dated overall actually.

**skargardin** (7): It’s alright but the drop makes it feel so dated.

**strawberryswing1** (7): production is too much at times

**dirdbub** (6.5): ok cool

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): there's just something missing to this song

**enecks** (6): CVOALS anagram that that is my issue with this song

**twat\_brained** (6): Idk what she's talking about, EDM is the wrong genre for her and it's not right that this was on the album instead of just rewriting "Store" 2 records early.

**Raykel** (5.5): Omg it sounds like they sped up her vocals during the verses lol like a vhs tape.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (5): i legit forget this song exists because it's so annoying but still good

**BionicFunhouse** (5): I like the song, but hate the production.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): just a meh song tbh...

**OberionSynth** (5): idk this just feels like a typical CRJ song but I'm not feeling it

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): A potentially fantastic song is ruined by obnoxious production that just screams 'YEAR OF OUR LORD 2012' in all the worst ways. Sigh.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): LMFAO ghost production must be stopped

**10footnotes** (4.5): The melody (besides the verses) and production are fairly generic.

**Leixander** (4): Forgettable and irritating.

**MrSwearword** (4): I’ve heard less hollow, dated beatwork off a Cheryl Cole album.

**jess\_22** (3.5): this sounds incredibly dated

**mokitsu** (3): filler

**cyborglilith** (2): Britney took inspiration from this filler disguised as EDM track when she released Clumsy

**Kaylaboe** (1): no carly no

**VeganSquash** (1): forgettable

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/RPC9cwAk)

**BreezySeason** (7): Queen of almost saying it

---
It's basically "Beautiful" minus the Bieber, so it gets one more point than it. Next.

---

**mokitsu** (6): cute but forgettable

**jess\_22** (5): forgettable

**Leixander** (5): Forgettable.

**mdawgig** (5): I hate to say it, but Queen released a forgettable song…

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The thing that clenches this song for me is how it just kind of ends, it’s a neat device that leaves the listener wanting for a resolution in the same way that she sings about wanting resolution in the song. My score for it actually shot up a bit after I watched an adorable live performance of it on YouTube, I usually have some qualms with Carly as a singer but this is a song that really plays to her strength, which is her girlish charm.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Carly slows it down with an amazing ballad. This song just made me extremely happy and should’ve been a major hit for Carly!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Sugar Rating: Fun Dip But With A Stick of Pop Rocks For The Fun Dip Stick

**warmishblood** (5): This belonged on Tug of War

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): I know that this isn't going to place that high, but I do enjoy the acoustic feel of this track. It's very subdued and I feel like Carly doesn't try to force her vocals here. Underrated gem, TBH.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (9): Woah that instrument is working! Taylor who? JK, but this is a very sentimental song. I love how close she is to telling her love how she truly feels. Slow songs suite CRJ very well.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (9): fuck I'm a sucker for classic acoustic Carly. It's also the only song on the album she has sole writing credit for.

**MissyBee37** (8.5): This song maybe has the best lyrics on this album; I like how it captures a unique theme -- that almost love. Heartbreaking lyrics, very pretty song.

**MrSwearword** (4): so she made two blander versions of The One That Got Away? BOO. NEXT

**10footnotes** (3): This song is so short: I don't get why it was released. In its current state it feels like an afterthought.

**skiddos** (3): Did this get cut from Tug of War?

**gannade** (9): the prototype to all that and that body language reference. shook!

**enecks** (4): I met a famous person once. I didn't say anything to them.

letsallpoo: 
**Piccprincess** (9): Almost said what? That I wanted to sit on Calvin's face? Oops....maybe I did say it.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Invented Guitar-driven ballads.

**PuggleMaster** (8): a cute ballad

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): aw this is so cute

**henry413** (7.5): Too short!

**RandomDKguy** (7.5): Carly should make more accoustic songs like this

**skargardin** (7.5): For sure the best slow-tempo song on the album even though that’s not saying much.

**blue\_heart\_** (7): This is actually decently good and it isn't like the rest of the album.

**Qwilphish** (7): The superior guitar song on Kiss, but it's still just OK. At least it doesn't overstay its welcome.

**superr\_rad** (7): this is one of the tug of war era bops im sure.

**supersecrettest** (7): It’s a cute song, but I understand why it’s not on the album. It’s a bit too acoustic for the rest of the album.

**therokinrolla** (7): its kinda cute, still very bonus tracky

**zamomattel** (7): If Taylor was good lmao

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Yawn Also what is with the abrupt ending?

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**eklxtreme** (6): kinda boring

**lady\_sable** (6): Her voice is pretty but this song is boring

**OberionSynth** (6): this is a sweet song but it's also kinda boring tbh

**strawberryswing1** (6): An unexpected country ballad, Lady Gaga is shaking

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): This sounds like a Passenger song

**twat\_brained** (4.5): I'm quite glad this is so short because it means that I won't have to endure it for very long when it comes up on the rate.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): nooooooooooooooooooooo

**dropthehammer11** (4): B o r i n g

I like the cello but uh that's it. Her voice sounds oddly loud, like they didn't process it properly. Why did I include these bonus tracks again?

---


**awryj** (0): I'm bored

**refrayn** (0): highkey embarrassing. taylor delete this

---

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): Jake Gyllenhaal is shook but also he makes incredible movies and is an amazing actor so he's not bothered

**Piccprincess** (10): Screw Jake. Like seriously. He took her virginity and then proceeded to not show up to her 21st birthday party. Dick.

**skargardin** (10): Worst birthday party ever. So brutally honest.

**wailordfan** (10): An underrated Jake Gyllenhal bop, and a really cool pop sound that she could've passed off onto 1989.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): “Fucking Jake, I knew I ordered too much cake, and now there’s not enough people to eat it!”

---

**McBawse** (10): I cried at this one too.

**MissyBee37** (10): Why is this not on the main album??? One of my absolute favorite Taylor songs. The specific, in-the-moment (pun intended) lyrics and the raw pain are so good here.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is a pretty sweet bonus track. I enjoy the production and I find elements of the musical composition to be pretty unique. I could see this replacing one of the weaker songs on the standard edition of the album, but I'm not sure what I would switch it out for.

**rickikardashian** (4): So I have a huge problem with this song, and is how cheesy and dumb sunds. I understand what feeling she’s trying to express, I see it as her trying to talk about how the feeling of being “betrayed” feels, and when you see the moment where the love totally fades, but instead of doing it in a longer story, she talks about the “moment she knew” as just one occasion, when obviously there has to be more of it, so it just feels like she is ending an entire relationship because of a bad situation. It’s kind of like writing a devastating breakup song, but talking only about the one time they didn’t flush the toilet. The thing that saves this song is how beautiful is the production and the instrumental, because if it wasn’t for it this would be my 0

**enecks** (4): not a fan of the vocals. There's a reason Taylor Swift is to vocal tier lists what Kirby is to the Smash Bros Melee tier list.

**johnazoidberg-** (3): Now she's just singing her diary. This sounds like it belongs in an off-Broadway musical that never makes it to the big street. I'm assuming they call Broadway that.

**strawberryswing1** (3): As this album closes I’m having trouble distinguishing the songs from each other. Also she needs to shorten a couple of these.

**OberionSynth** (8): I'm like lowkey upset that taylor's deluxe albums are not on apple music because this song is life [*editor's note: they are on apple music*]

**Nfranklin50** (10): I never liked this song but then I lived it and suddenly it became very good

**lady\_sable** (9.5): I love the cello in the beginning so much tbh

**poppinmmolly** (9.5): The story to this is so fucking sad. I know how she feels to. To like someone so much and having them let you down. It sucks.

**therokinrolla** (9.5): a fucking fantastic track. And its a bonus track???? This sounds like it should no doubt be on the main album

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9): HAPPY BIRTHDAY, :eyes:

**chili\_jones** (9): idk if the chorus lands but the verses and bridge break my heart tbh :(

**Magic\_warlock0-** (8.5): Does a very good job encapsulating the exact moment of heartbreak, it's super relatable and touching. I dig the tune, it makes this song even more impactful

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is cute. Kinda glad it didn't make it to the standard edition.

**eklxtreme** (8): the strings are a nice touch and it has some sweet speak now vibes

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Production was the clear highlight of this song for me, I really loved the introduction of a cello on a song, it gave it a fresh sound!

**mokitsu** (8): ok my wig is levitating a bit!

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7.5): chorus could be a lil better

**mdawgig** (7.5): Probably the best bonus track, but that's a pretty low bar.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Usually I love personal lyrics, but these were SO specific I had a hard time relating.

**angusaditus** (7): Great storytelling, just not that catchy

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Calm down sis. Why are you so dramatic?

**superr\_rad** (7): honestly, she took me there. this song is so vivid and detailed, its pretty obvious it actually happened, and its pretty heartbreaking.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): A very tolerable ballad, I like the production

**TragicKingdom1** (7): Kind of an awkward melody but I like how it has actual power behind it.

**twat\_brained** (7): Eh, my filler radar's not that great but I can certainly detect this. I don't hate it, though. I don't love it either.

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**dropthehammer11** (6): Okay this is tolerable, I like the buildup and drop. Not bad, hisswoman

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): It's not terrible, but... I'm not going to remember what this sounds like by the time the rate reveal comes around.

**zamomattel** (5): I mean this isn't bad but it does sound like everything else released by Taylor Swift

**10footnotes** (4.5): I just wish the melody was less generic. It’s hard to get excited about a song when the one standout part of it is depressing lyrics :(

**cyborglilith** (4): this is very boring

**Johnnytoby** (4): Honestly most songs on this album sound exaclty the same like they have no character

**MrSwearword** (4): “and it was like slow motion/standing there in my party dress” ONLY LANA CAN SING ABOUT HER PARTY DRESS YOU FUCKING THIEF.

**Qwilphish** (3): Actually manages to be more boring than normal.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): very dramatic

**supersecrettest** (3): ok these songs are all starting to sound the same. It’s Taylor, but this time with strings!

**VeganSquash** (2): I appreciate the story in the lyrics, but the story is much too cringe.

This song sounds like something Ariana would make for Sesame Street to teach kids about road safety or something. It's cute but it's pretty basic and unmemorable.

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is a decent 90s throwback, but singing about a Cadillac isn't as glorious as singing about how bittersweet it feels for your baby to pull you closer in the backseat of your Rover and bite that tattoo on your shoulder we ain't ever getting older [instrumental drop] we ain't ever getting older no we ain't ever getting older no we ain't ever getting older (sorry)

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): sigh relatable. What I appreciate about this song is that it’s very passive, for a song about an ex it’s surprisingly chill. It’s warm and wistful, but not overly so. More than anything else she just sounds tired in this song. She’s indulging herself in thoughts of her ex, but there’s clearly some distance from the actual breakup and thus the sting of the pain has worn off and now it’s just about idle nostalgia. It’s telling that the song is called the “Cadillac Song,” the central image is that of Ariana just kind of going for a drive in her car. She’s not necessarily going anywhere, she’s just meandering, taking a moment to get lost down memory lane. It’s more of a song about her remembering this person rather than her actually wanting them. Idk, maybe I’m reading into this one too much but I found it to be a nice song with some surprising layers.

**twat\_brained** (10): GET YOU WHERE YOU WANNA GO IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN GOTTA RIDE THAT SMOOTHER THAN A LIMOUSINEᵈᵒ ᵗʰᵉ ᵛⁱᵈᵉᵒᵍʳᵃᵖʰʸ ʳᵃᵗᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ᵍⁱᵛᵉ ᵀᵉˡᵉᵖʰᵒⁿᵉ ʸᵒᵘʳ ¹¹ˢ

**MrSwearword** (4): if this song were a Cadillac, it’d be a Catera dressed as Seville.

**angusaditus** (8): Deserves to be on the album tbh, it's so much more true to Ariana than something like "Hands on me"

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (7): queen of country music

[/r/popheads/comments/71t7ok/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_1_ready_for_it/dndfc6q/]

letsallpoo: 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg this is a bop, why isn't this on spotify?! :pingu:

**mokitsu** (10): this was the very first ariana song i liked, very summer-y and nostalgic, the pre-chorus is godly, she did that

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): There's a throwback element here that I can't put my finger on but I adore it.

**PuggleMaster** (10): I thought this was going to be corny but it SNATCHED me bald

**eklxtreme** (9): very sweet sounding and fitting with the album's vibe

**mudkip1** (9): /u/letsallpoo

**superr\_rad** (9): this is my first time hearing this and i really dig it, its so chill and perfect to drive to

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): A sweet song that really suited Ariana's vocal abilities.

**gannade** (8): so pretty

**supersecrettest** (8): I like the softness of this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Is this song produced by Pharrell?

**triptoyourheart** (8): Better than some songs on the standard version.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Should have been on the full normal album.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (7): i want more of this, a full album of this would be amazing

**cyborglilith** (7): we're driving cadillacs in our dreams

**OberionSynth** (7): i had to watch an ad for spectrum tv before i listened to this so i'm a little bitter about that

**Piccprincess** (7): Vroom Vroom in the back of Calvin's car

**Qwilphish** (7): It's alright I guess lmao feels like a bonus track

**zamomattel** (7): These Yours Truly teas

**awryj** (6.5): Probably the most boring song on the record and it's still nice.

**dropthehammer11** (6): I like those hi hats. S A U C Y

**enecks** (6): She can't even sell having looked at a Cadillac in this TBH.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): not hard to see why it was left off the Deluxe Version tbh, it's ok but super forgettable

**jess\_22** (5): ultimate lazy day song

**strawberryswing1** (5): forgettable

**wailordfan** (5): Carrie Underwood did it better tbh.

**floofeh** (4.5): I like it less than the 5s I gave so there you go. I see why they left it out.

**10footnotes** (4): I’m getting tired of writing that I’m not interested in yet another Ariana deep cut, but it’s true.

**Johnnytoby** (4): ?

**Raykel** (4): This sounds like a Yours Truly reject.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i wish it had a poppier production

**SimplyHaunted** (4): I got distracted while listening to this song which annoyed me because then I had to go back and this to this snooze fest again so I could rate it properly. I think I'd rather listen to the intro again.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (3.5): It’s soothing, but ultimately kinda falls flat.

**dirdbub** (3): literally I want to die too much this is not the mood I should rate these songs in but my god this is draining me of all my energy just to listen to it af;lsjdoaweiljs;

**Elitefourbrad** (3): I hate Cadillacs.

**mdawgig** (3): "Memories last forever," except this song, which is completely forgettable.

**skyblade79** (3): super generic and boring, sorry…

**therokinrolla** (3): this song cadil-lacks anything interesting

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (2): i want this eliminated early

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.5): this song is the equivalent of someone driving just under the speed limit in the left lane i need it to CHANGE

Oh wait, this is kind of a bop. It's not a standout or anything but I love the song's coquettish bounciess. You can tell it was made to be a bonus track, especially with the very limited production, but I don't mind.

---

**jess\_22** (9): Mariah's influence

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Leave the Mariah songs to actual Mariah. This is definitely the worst vocal performance that Ariana delivered on the album, and probably the worst song. Messy as hell but at least the hook is nice.

---

**johnazoidberg-** (8): Don't get me wrong, this is a fucking jam, but if you think Next are shook - they are standing firmly in place. Ari didn't even try to make this song about boners. This is the best non-Spotify song in the rate. Still not about boners though :/

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): The best bonus track on My Everything, IMO. Better than that creepy Next song about a boner. Seriously how did that song get onto the top of the year-end charts in the fucking 90s? Yeah, anyway. Ahem. This song is much better.

**twat\_brained** (8): Alex Clare has been found deceased in his home.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Alex Clare who? (literally tho that dude must be living off royalties cause like I haven't heard of him in a minute)

**skyblade79** (6): close by tove lo outpeaked

---

**Magic\_warlock0-** (4): WHY CAN’T I UNDERSTAND HER!? It’s annoying to hear such a goddamn talented singer eat mashed potatoes before all her songs

**lexarqade** (2): Man I know there are jokes about Ariana's enunciation but I legitimately couldn't tell a single word she said in this song

**dirdbub** (4): poweij;fsdlvzkcxnm/z,s.dkrtpiwea;lksdjlks/fj

**zamomattel** (7): literally can't understand what she's saying at all in this whole song but I bop anyways

**gannade** (1.5): what is she saying?????

**triptoyourheart** (9.5): Ari must love her Japanese fans if she's giving out songs like this to them only. What a great discovery I made with this track.

**mokitsu** (9): the quality is kinda bad, like it sounds a bit too much like a demo? anyways, it's a bop

**refrayn** (9): this bangs hard

**bwc222** (8.5): japan always gets the best bonus tracks

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This pretty much feels like a Yours Truly reject, in a good way!

**eklxtreme** (8): upbeat and fun classic vibes

**Leixander** (8): A surprising bop. Simple and cliché, still a bop though.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): this is a tad forgettable, but like she still did that™. So better than your faves.

**nooodisaster** (8): Wtf how have I never heard of this song it's such a bop.

**OberionSynth** (8): japan gets all the good shit, i swear

**TeamAwesome4** (8): So happy she didn't close with a low key crooning song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This sounds like something off of the GTA soundtrack I like it.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): i'm feelin it tbh

**dropthehammer11** (7): Okay this is dope

**Elitefourbrad** (7): yasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Her voice sounds weird here, like the tone she's singing in is really off from how she normally sings.

**Piccprincess** (7): I'd love to get too close to Calvin

**rickikardashian** (7): The bonus tracks all have a bit of a cont. R&B sound, and it’s an interesting sound for Ariana considering she’s known as the poppy girl.

**superr\_rad** (7): this is kinda a throwback bop

**therokinrolla** (6.5): it kinda bops, but it should stay an exclusive tracks

**10footnotes** (6): At least it’s upbeat and has some different stuff going on in its production.

**enecks** (6): UH

**mudkip1** (6): /u/letsallpoo

**Qwilphish** (6): Too cutesy and cheesy for me but hey whatever Japan wants I guess

**MrSwearword** (5): this reject Yours Truly cut is cute, but this track should’ve gotten a Madonna style German only release

**skiddos** (5): Sounds like a Yours Truly reject.

**floofeh** (4.5): same as the previous one. This one sounds like it should be been released in early 00s.

**cyborglilith** (4): It's a good end to the album, but it's kind of annoying

**mdawgig** (4): It's still filler, but better than most of this album's filler at least?

**Raykel** (4): I can see why this and Cadillac Song were left off the standard and digital deluxe. It sounds like they needed Target deluxe tracks last minute and rushed this and called it a day.

The production is annoying and Ariana just sounds disinterested in the whole thing. I would say it sounds like a *Yours Truly* reject, but *Yours Truly* is too good to be compared to this.

---

**angusaditus** (10): Such an anthem and probably one of her most personal songs, and I truly love the message. Not everyone is gonna understand you, but fuck them, the only person you have to answer to is yourself. As long as you yourself know that you have the best of intentions, it doesn't matter what others think.

**twat\_brained** (9): Every single stan should listen to this song. It doesn't even apply just to Ari; the media portrays our faves in a certain light, and for most of us, our perception of them is based on what we see in the media. Before we decide that Ariana "hates America" just because she licked donuts, we should remember this song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I admire what this song represents, Ariana actually wrote it and it’s clearly a personal song for her. That said, it’s messy. It doesn’t really have a solid melody or chorus or bridge or anything, it’s ambitious but it doesn’t quite get anywhere.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Huh? I'm confused. What is this supposed to be? Which part is the hook? Where's the bridge? This could have been a heartbreaking ballad ala Looking In but it's just so scattered to the point where I don't care much about it.

---

**henry413** (6): I am a little sad that this song isn't actually about Mariah lol.

**Leixander** (10): Ariana's delivery is awesome here.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): You better drag it, sis.

**OberionSynth** (10): i have no idea what any of the lyrics are but this song gets me so hyped

**Qwilphish** (10): Feels like a throwback in the best possible way, ariana serves some excellent vocals on this track.

**Raykel** (10): An underrated bop that perfectly throwbacks to early 2000s pop music.

**skiddos** (10): I really hope this doesn’t get underrated on this rate. It’s a great song. That chorus blew me away when I first heard it. This is one of my top 5 favorite Ariana songs.

**strawberryswing1** (9.5): The lyrics to this song feel a little childish but and I know that critically this isn’t a great song or whatever but I love this song.

**musicotic** (9): Bop

**awryj** (8.5): It's slightly repetitive

**zamomattel** (8.5): LOVE this but it doesn't sound like a finished song for some reason

**cyborglilith** (8): The pulsing electonic blasts were a wrong choice, but the chorus is just too good.

**MissyBee37** (8): I own the deluxe album and this is the second song I completely forgot. But it's good! Strong lyrics.

**skyblade79** (8): I can’t understand her at all but it sounds nice!

**eklxtreme** (7.5): the production is crazy good and it's the only good part of the song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): someone show this song to Katy Perry the next time she's trying to make an empowerment anthem

**therokinrolla** (7.5): is this a fuck you song? This is a fuck you song! cool!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Such a weird song, especially because of the beat, but the beat is great, and I’m a fan.

**10footnotes** (6.5): I like this deluxe track more than I liked several of the standard songs. Ariana’s voice really shines here.

**Elitefourbrad** (6): Another fillerish track...

**jess\_22** (6): Ariana's vocals save this, the production is incredibly grating

**skargardin** (6): I understand what she was going for but this track is rather messy.

**dropthehammer11** (5.5): Interesting song here. Empowering

**enecks** (5): DEMO

**lexarqade** (5): This seemed to go on a little bit too long for my liking.

**VeganSquash** (5): meh

**dirdbub** (4.5): this is giving me “Crew Love” vibes but worse

**Magic\_warlock0-** (4): I can’t muster up a like for this song. It hits some good points, but that “Don’t judge me, you only see a part of me” stuff can be great, if sung well. It’s kinda whiny here.

**MrSwearword** (3): this goes nowhere and she can’t sell it.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (2): i genuinely forgot this song existed and I've played this album at least 10 times

**mdawgig** (2): More enunciation problems. More filler. More mind Teflon.

This is basically "Treacherous" but not as interesting. Still very pretty though!

---

**jess\_22** (11): This is an absolute TUNE, i miss this Taylor :(

---

**McBawse** (10): I'm crying again.

**cyborglilith** (9): i cry every time

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): THE EVER EVER I CAN’T OMG MY HEART “WROTE THIS INSTEAD OF CALLING”

**therokinrolla** (9): “i almost do” cum every time this song comes on

---

**Piccprincess** (10): Nothing like posting this song on my Facebook page at 4 am, almost 10 months after a break up. And yes, I tagged my ex. And I may or may not have been drunk.

**blue\_heart\_** (10): Another song (for reference, the other song is All Too Well, which will go out after this; I elaborate there) which I kind of lost a bit of spirit for after not being a depressed egg. Rest assured, that while Taylor almost did, I did, and I was hurt more for it. Sometimes you just have to let things rest.

**MissyBee37** (10): This song gets me every time; the lyrics remind of a friend with whom I almost do, and the lyric "I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye" breaks me. I've had to sing that to myself over & over again.

---

**SpanKKy1** (4): but a nibba gotta do what he gotta scooby dooby doo




[/r/popheads/comments/71t7ok/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_1_ready_for_it/dndgdqv/]

=====

letsallpoo: 


**lady\_sable** (9.5): This is such classic Taylor. She's a master at making you feel her sadness and conflicting emotions.

**musicotic** (9.5): Had not realized this song was a thing, and a good thing!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Does this sound like If I Die Young to anyone else?

**poppinmmolly** (9): I love this song but it's trying to be All Too Well and IT'S NOT. But still makes me feel all the feels.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I feel like the song is trying to reach higher and it didn't for some reason. Oh well, it's still a bop.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Awww, this is really sweet! I really like it reminds me a lot of "Last First Kiss" by One Direction, especially when she sings "I almost dooooooo"; it sounds like "your last first kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiss".

**Elitefourbrad** (8): It’s hard to stay back because you almost do. It’s hard to stay away from temptations, Paul from BB19 is shook!

**enecks** (8): If she didn't have the promising trifecta of Blank Space, Wildest Dreams, and Style in 1989, I would almost be wanting Taylor to go back to this country style just so we can get better album cuts.

**OberionSynth** (8): this song pretty much describes what my best friend is going through so I'm like personally offended

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Not sure if this was intentional, but I think the song title is interesting because it could refer to wedding vow. Like, 'I do'. I almost do. Maybe I'm just grasping at straws. It's a bit of a disappointment after three nearly perfect songs but it's still pretty good.

**10footnotes** (7.5): I bet… This song will find a comfortable rank to leave at late Day 1 or early Day 2, and I’ll be fine with that. It’s a pretty song, but nowhere near the best track of its kind on this album.

**eklxtreme** (7): it's slow but it has some sweet mellow vibes

**ignitethephoenix** (7): She sounds great but it's kind of a snooze.

**mdawgig** (7): The bridge is good, but the song as a whole is pretty boring.

**MrSwearword** (7): well, she does come across like the one ex who’s all “OMG I DON’T H8 U, I’M 2 AFRAID OF U BREAKING MY HEART AGAIN, UR SO STUPID”. She can commit. Salut.

**zamomattel** (7): This is actually quite sad, but I probably wouldn't listen to it again

**CharmingArsenal** (6): Haven't I listened to this twice on this album already??

**johnazoidberg-** (6): Queen of having a gambling problem. I bet this song almost didn't make the album

**refrayn** (6): her voice is really pretty here but the song itself is pretty mediocre

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): “Okay, okay, way too much pop there, I gotta tone it down. What do you mean this tracklist isn’t cohesive? What the fuck does oil and vinegar have to do with music! This is gonna be fine, trust me.”

**Magic\_warlock0-** (5.5): Not good, but not bad. I get the feeling of cutting off an old lover, but Tay makes it sound so...ugh?

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**BionicFunhouse** (4): I feel like I heard this song already...

**dropthehammer11** (4): Can this album stop being boring

**PuggleMaster** (4): can she learn to hold a note?

**supersecrettest** (4): This song feels reductive. She's done this for 3 albums already, and I'm not entirely sure what this makes different than on Fearless

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): I'm not going to remember what this sounds like by the time the rate reveal comes around.

**VeganSquash** (4): too country for my tastes

**awryj** (3): I'm listening to it right now and I already forgot it

**mokitsu** (3): country trash

**superr\_rad** (3): zzzzzz honestly, after listening to this album the first time, this is not a track youll remember.

**fifthchevron** (2): This is just a lesser All You Had To Do Was Stay??

**BreezySeason** (7): Queen of blue jeans (suck it up Lana)

---
I realized like a day before I posted the rate thread that this song wasn't the single she made in collaboration with American Idol (named "Take a Picture") but instead was a random track from Carly's *Curiosity EP*. "Take a Picture" is a great song, and its unique parts were voted on by people who somehow still cared about American Idol in 2012. "Picture" is a song. I probably should have left it out of this rate tbh.

---

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): screaming a song from the Curiosity EP was included in here [*editor's note: IT WAS RELEASED ON THE JAPANESE TOUR EDITION OF KISS OKAY I WANTED TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE SONGS. SUE ME*]

**Qwilphish** (8.5): Another Curiosity bop, shows that the dip in quality of Kiss from the rest of her discography is really just because of time crunch. Really mellow but very enjoyable throughout.

**awryj** (8.5): Feels a bit like an EMOTION Side B track

**refrayn** (6): as i listened to this i just kept thinking about asian karaoke with the badly taken photos for backgrounds and shitty transitions

**OberionSynth** (6): this song makes me feel like i'm driving through new york city dating boy after boy and i kinda dig it tbh

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (10): This album has a problem with being generic lyrically, but here it actually is a pleasant bonus. She's envisioning a future and it's easier to just focus on the big details, because then you don't have to think about how it won't work.

**johnazoidberg-** (8): Queen of pictures, Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow are shook. Remember, friends don't let friends sing Picture by Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow at karaoke.

**NapsAndNetflix** (5): Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow outpeaked

**rickikardashian** (5.5): Queen of photography

**henry413** (8): Queen of Coca Cola commercial? Oh wait it's another song.

**supersecrettest** (7): Take a Picture is better. This one feels too busy for a slow song.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): i mean it's a cute song but boring also love isn't real

letsallpoo: **skyblade79** (10): I’m doing this score literally only because a random number generator chose 10 sorry

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Fantastic.

**cyborglilith** (8): the only good exclusive (?) song

**eklxtreme** (8): cute vibes and catchy

**lulbady** (8): Loving the folky vibes on this

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Dig if you will, a picture, of you and I engaged in a kiss

**twat\_brained** (8): Well if there's ANYONE here who knows how great a picture with Carly Rae Jepsen is, it's u/omgclassic.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): saved me from bonus track hell

**Magic\_warlock0-** (7): It’s pretty sweet, but it bit too slow to fully capture the feeling.

**mdawgig** (7): A lesser cut, but still fine.

**MissyBee37** (7): This song is really pretty, and better than some of the main album tracks.

**mokitsu** (7): very cute chill bop, should've been on the standard version!

**Piccprincess** (7): You know what I do with a picture of Calvin

**RandomDKguy** (7): Such a chill and sweet song!

**superr\_rad** (7): this is like a movie soundtrack bop and its fine but kinda boring

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Sugar Rating: Store-Bought Cupcakes

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): decent song; not sure why it didn't make the iTunes version.

**therokinrolla** (7): well… its over i guess

**luigi\_is\_better** (6.5): too much "filler from a disney movie" for me

**CharmingArsenal** (6): Always thought this was one of her weakest tracks.

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**enecks** (6): Picture this: an artist with some good songs, but a lack of direction. Was flopping ultimately the thing that got Carly Rae's focus up, resulting in Emotion being a modern pop masterwork?

**skargardin** (6): Ends on a filler track. Who’d thought?

**zamomattel** (5.5): Now this one i can see why it's a bonus track

**Elitefourbrad** (5): A pretty laid back filler bonus track

**Leixander** (5): Forgettable.

**dropthehammer11** (4): If you told me this was Taylor I wouldnt budge

Oop here's a good Taylor bonus track. Tragic puncuation aside, I do enjoy this ballad-esque bop from Taylor quite a bit, arguably more than the ones on the acual album. I like the way her voice adjusts when singing the title, partly sinister but wholly emotional. It's not her most memorable song, but a nice surprise coming from someone not known for their excellent bonus tracks pre-*1989*.

---

**johnazoidberg-** (3): Remember, popular recording artists artists, you're allowed to leave songs off of your releases.

**twat\_brained** (7): I can almost hear Swifties singing this to the "old Taylor" we've recently had to say goodbye to.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Not that...bad for...a song title with...pretentious...ellipses. ...I am...supposed to...be writing....my art history essay....but I find Taylor...more interesting.

**Nfranklin50** (10): Such an Under rated song. That first verse just draws you in to the hopelessness and longing of this relationship "You said it in a simple way, 4 AM, the second day, How strange that I don't know you at all" gets me every time

**supersecrettest** (3): Ok I Really am giving up on this type of song. They all feel really formulaic. Like slow, guitar, with a slow drum beat until they build up and she has a “revelation” and then she realizes something and she sticks with it for the slow and easy outro. But I don’t really like that again.


---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is a very Speak Now type of song. I love this!

**lady\_sable** (9): Taylor's serving Fearless teas here and I love it

**zamomattel** (3): This is worse than any song on 1989 by miles, even Welcome to New York

---

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): i cry everytime

**McBawse** (10): I cried here too.

letsallpoo: 

**agentofscranton** (10): an underrated song honestly

**Piccprincess** (10): Is he in New York or London? Which is it?

**poppinmmolly** (10): I adore this song.

**superr\_rad** (10): i love this??? its kinda generic and very safe but this is one of those songs i liked instantly.

**therokinrolla** (10): damn i never heard this song before the rate and its just… such a punch in the gut like damn i want him to come back

**cyborglilith** (9): i just found out what song always plays at department stores! it's still good tho

**jess\_22** (9): this should have made the regular album cut

**eklxtreme** (8): great melody and harmonies, I like when Taylor goes for this vibe

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Go get him sis! Don't wait around for that boy.

**CharmingArsenal** (7): I'm running out of things to say at this point, the second half of this album turned into one big blur for me.

**Elitefourbrad** (7): I didn’t really like the acoustic guitar as much in this song, but Taylor’s heartbreaking vocals come through here.

**mdawgig** (7): Catchier than your average filler, but still filler. The production feels unfinished, like a demo.

**OberionSynth** (7): again, why are these not on apple music T.T

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): not bad

**10footnotes** (6): This is my favorite of the deluxe tracks, mostly because it has (IMO) the best melody.

**enecks** (6): Can I just listen to something else?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): “What do you mean this album is pop? No it’s not! More country it is!”

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**dropthehammer11** (5): snooze

**Qwilphish** (5): Like most songs in this album it's ok

**awryj** (4): Is it just me or does she only use the same 4 chords throughout the record?

**Magic\_warlock0-** (4): GENERIC. I feel like I've heard this song on this album at least three times.

**mokitsu** (3): filler

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): when will this album end

**MrSwearword** (2): IF THIS BITCH SINGS ABOUT ANOTHER LONG GOODBYE I’M KICKING HER IN THE THROAT

**VeganSquash** (1): why does she miss him so much? She'll inevitably break up with him 10 days later

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/FF7ZMunw)

**BreezySeason** (10): Queen of hearing she's kinda nice

---
Serving Kylie Minogue B-side tbh but it bops. This is one of those elusive Japanese bonus tracks that aren't available anywhere for some reason. This is the only one really worth seeking out imo, because the chorus is just a sugar rush of greatness.

---

**SpanKKy1** (9): queen of homewreckers, marina is shook

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Queen of forcing people to stay faithful

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): queen of not letting men cheat on their girlfriends?

**dropthehammer11** (5): Queen of adultery. Also this is mediocre

**OberionSynth** (5): queen of respecting the girl code

**dirdbub** (7): queen of writing songs about discreet gays

---

**Qwilphish** (10): Unashamed and brash this song is so fun and great. This is probably the most emotion Carly shows on this album, and I'm living for the desperation. Why did Japan get some of the best tracks

**MissyBee37** (7.5): This song is so fun!! The kind of song that's too good to be a bonus song. Love the claps in the background; the chorus is super catchy. Even "t-t-teeth" is a cute bit.

**OwenKam50** (10): epitome of bubblegum pop

**cyborglilith** (4): omg is Carly secretly a hoe inside (like me)?

**henry413** (9.5): Somehow I really like this track, I guess it's probably bc it allows me to fantasize that I am popular enough to attract attention from hot straight guys :(

**raicicle** (8.5): There’s something about Carly’s delivery on this song that recalls what she was doing on “Store”. The little whirring alarm-like rising synth just after she sings the titular line is pretty cute. Works well in a slightly humorous way.

---

**10footnotes** (4): (Don't look at me you've got a girl at home) Man I love This Kiss/Hurt So Good/other songs I've forgotten that sound exactly like this.

**blue\_heart\_** (4): girl at home but Carly isn't as upstanding and right

**superr\_rad** (4): lmao how funny bc Girl at Home is literally the exact same subject manner but carluy does it so much better. its still not that great of a song tbh

**reddituser206** (6.5): Taylor's "Girl At Home" is better

**ComeOnAndSlang** (6): literally a worse version of girl at home

**TeamAwesome4** (6): Not as good as Taylor's female solidarity song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): Girl at Home is shaking

letsallpoo: 
**supersecrettest** (10): Finally re downloaded this song after hearing it on pandora 5 years ago, and I really like it. Shame it’s a Japan exclusive.

**mdawgig** (9.5): Is this a cover? No? Because it's so timeless that I can't believe nobody had made this pop perfection before.

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): one of my all-time fav deluxe track. i can listen to this song for hours without getting tired of it.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): fun classic vibe, similar to 2016 Tegan and sara

**johnazoidberg-** (8.5): This song sounds like it should have been in the Disney stars rate - and it would have made the top 10. Remember kids, no means no.

**lady\_sable** (8.5): Drag him Carly!

**Piccprincess** (8.5): I know you do, Calvin, but you can call me (maybe)

**mokitsu** (8): let him know carly!

**musicotic** (8): Cute

**rickikardashian** (8): This is a bop, why can’t it be on spotify

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Sugar Rating: The Ending of Whichever Shrek Had the Gingerbread Singing Number Except It’s Sprinkled With Powdered Sugar Too

**zamomattel** (8): Almost boppy and Carly showing her moral compass

**CharmingArsenal** (7.5): Girl, stop giving guys who are unavailable the time of day. Things might go better for you.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): Yeah...this isn't on the album for a reason

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I actually like this song. It's catchy and it's an excellent callout. Essentially a better version of Girl at Home?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): cute instrumental and fun song but the lyrics are so dumb like i mean carly can do fun and silly but this goes too far

**twat\_brained** (7): This is the exact premise of "This Kiss", just in E major. Why would I wanna hear the exact same story twice?!

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6.5): Not bad, it’s a nice change up from the normal “Let’s fall in love sweetly” theme that Kiss feels like it has. Good beat, I like how she sees right through that guy’s BS

**Elitefourbrad** (6): THAT ANNOYING TELEPHONE SOUND IN THE SONG NNN

**gannade** (6): this beat sounds like something a disney girl would make a bop to and i support it 100%

**refrayn** (6): “TUH-TUH-TEETH” lorde is shook

**skargardin** (6): These deluxe edition tracks aren’t doing it for me at all.

**skiddos** (6): This is cute. Drag him, Carly!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): This song sounds like it came from an early 2000’s movie produced by Nickelodeon, which might sound pejorative, which is good, because that’s my intention.

**Leixander** (5): Forgettable and irritating.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (4.5): can't stand the lyrics, handclaps and backing synth

**MrSwearword** (4.5): oh great, the shitpost version of “I’m So Into You” by SWV

**skyblade79** (4): this seems like it would be a really good cupcakke remix

**therokinrolla** (4): i know you are  better than this carly

**wailordfan** (4): How can a girl who made EMOTION be ok with releasing such a meh worthy back half of an album.

**enecks** (3): What could've been a song is instead a morse code message that loosely translates to "I wasn't meant to be a good album artist at this stage in my career"

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): don’t please stop

**lexarqade** (2): Avril who?

**VeganSquash** (2): the beeping cellphone sounds are so dated

Okay, hold up. This is a fucking snatcher that proves that Ariana needs basically nothing - there's just some basic drum beats and someone twiddling two piano keys in the background - and still create a good fucking song. I'm a sucker for Big Sean verses, cheesy as they are, and I think the two of them have a great dynamic. The title describes this rate accurately.

---
**mokitsu** (11): the modern beyoncé and jay-z, they died so that we could have this song

**mdawgig** (0): I forgot I was listening to a song. Capital-every-letter BORING.

---

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): OMG, they were the cutest couple. They have great Chemistry here.

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): RIP Big Sean + Ari, I was rooting for y’all. A good song but I don’t re-listen to it very often.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): Having Big Sean on this track was a mistake but, it still works!

**skyblade79** (9): I love Big Sean and that downtempo chorus is so good. I adore this!

**luigi\_is\_better** (8.5): big sean sounds so comfortable here, damn. really like the vibe of this song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): My :some emoji:ean sounds just as plain as he usually does, but it kinda works anyway. Ariana does her thing too.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Great, atmospheric production on here, and a solid R&B duet jam between her and Sean, makes me wish they hadn't broken up so we could get a TWENTY88 style album with her and Sean (although him and Jhene and her and Mac are GOALS)

**jess\_22** (8): I guess Big Sean really is her best mistake now

**VodkaInsipido** (8): Ariana’s part is okay, but Sean offers a good verse.

**lulbady** (7.5): I really like Ariana's part but Big Sean takes me out of the whole thing

**bwc222** (7): big sean kinda ruined this song

**OwenKam50** (7): Big sean sounds bored

**Qwilphish** (7): Big Sean takes a point off this pretty good R&B track.

**callmetidle** (6): Big Sean was a mistake

**dropthehammer11** (5): Not bad, but boring. Why is Sean rapping about Ziploc bags

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Isn't Big Sean a meme? Or was that Sean Paul? Which rapper named Sean is the meme? I can't remember.

---

why was i pinged

**twat\_brained** (7): Never understood the hype for this nor will I understand it. It's pretty good music to chill to or to make out with someone to, though. u/letsallpoo you know what to put on when we meet up

**mudkip1** (7): /u/letsallpoo


[/r/popheads/comments/71t7ok/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_1_ready_for_it/dndhk4f/]

=====

letsallpoo: 
**PuggleMaster** (10): this was my favorite song for a while. One of my favorite songs from ari

**SimplyHaunted** (10): This is the Ariana Grande song I didn't know I needed.

**musicotic** (9): The piano is perfect on a trakc like this, except it doesn't always fit perfectly with the vocals. Strings are <span class="emoji-outer emoji-sizer"><span class="emoji-inner" style="background: url(chrome-extension://immhpnclomdloikkpcefncmfgjbkojmh/emoji-data/sheet_apple_64.png);background-position:45.833333333333336% 95.83333333333334%;background-size:4900%" data-codepoints="1f60d"></span></span>

**skargardin** (9): Sensual, sexy collab that works better than it should.

**awryj** (8.5): You can just feel that she enjoys singing it.


**MrSwearword** (8.5): there’s a lot of good but considering the SUPERBOPS to Ariana’s name, this doesn’t measure up.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): this would've made a better opener for the album than intro

**zamomattel** (8.5): Ariana Grande, tonight you showed us that collaborations with Big Sean are no mistake. You're safe.

**Johnnytoby** (8): the only beef i have is when rappers mention the girls mom like its gross pls stop

**lady\_sable** (8): I love the piano riff; it's so chill.

**refrayn** (8): this lit

**superr\_rad** (8): i love pre-breakup breakup bops

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): This is kinda boring.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I love the piano and vibraphone used in this song. It makes it super soothing especially with Ariana voice. Big Sean's verse is decent too. However the second time listening to this, made it stand out less and I don't think it's something I'll come back to.

**OberionSynth** (7): this song was good until big sean happened

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Sean rides over this darker beat for Ari, and it’s a nice song, but both too long and over too soon.

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): ugh

**blue\_heart\_** (6): I love pianos, so it's a good start, but Ari's mumbling turns me off again. Prechorus is pretty good, chorus I hate. It's nothing special. Big Sean is the most aggressively mediocre feature on this rate.

**enecks** (6): This song is kinda weird? The piano doesn't feel like it blends with Ariana much at all, they feel isolated.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Look… don’t date people that you work with, that’s all I’m gonna say.

**johnazoidberg-** (6): Big Sean's verse is the best part of this song. The rest of it just sounds like Ari got tired of pretending to be Mariah and pretended to be Ciara

**lexarqade** (6): I think the rap verse kinda sucks the life out of it a bit.

**MissyBee37** (6): The feature hurts this song for me. I really don't care for Big Sean's verse.

**therokinrolla** (6): big sean sounds asleep

**10footnotes** (5.5): It’s fine, but not that interesting to me. The best part are the harmonies in the “break up, make up” part.

**Piccprincess** (5.5): Saying I'd fuck Zedd too was a mistake, I'm sorry Calvin

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): again, forgettable

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**eklxtreme** (5): weave left untouched, they shouldn't have made this entire song including big Sean's verse so soft. it's very forgettable.

**henry413** (5): It's really boring.

**Leixander** (5): Making a bland track with a soon-to-be ex was not her best mistake.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): got a 4 instead of a 1 cause Big Sean is hot

**ImADudeDuh** (4): ok until big sean's slow af voice

**TeamAwesome4** (4): "~~Best~~ Mistake"

**VeganSquash** (4): Ariana's verses are amazing, Big Sean on the other hand is awful. If Ariana had no features on this, it would be a 10 for sure

**cyborglilith** (3): wow that rap is so unnecessary and the beat is just so INVASIVE

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): Big Seans part is good but don’t care for ari’s part

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): idk about "best" but it certainly was a mistake

**Magic\_warlock0-** (1): By far the worst song off this album. A shame, but Big Sean can do better than this, and so could Ari. Just seems a bit lazy and it’s not moving anything in me

I can see why it was left off of the album - it wouldn't really fit - but hot damn is this song good. Lyrically it's about Ariana's amazement of how she's the only one in this amazing boy's life, and there's this gnawing anxiety over the situation that you can hear interfering with how much she wants to love him. Also apparently those vocals in the beginning are a sample from some song from 1986.

---
**triptoyourheart** (11): Why is this a bonus track?!?!? THOSE RUNS. Life giving. Sad that only stans know about this song.

**dirdbub** (0): this is probably because I want tod ie right now but that was such a chore to get through

---

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5.5): i wanna be petty and give this a 1 nnnnghn

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): it’s what she deserves

**NapsAndNetflix** (1): Only 1

**SpanKKy1** (1): this song only deserves a 1

---

**enecks** (10): Only One is one of the most underrated songs in Kanye's discography. It's so tragically beautiful. It's incredibly autotune laden, but in a way only Kanye can nail. It's so beautiful. The chorus is one of the most beautiful moments in Kanye's discography; up there with the end of New Slaves, the end of Runaway, the ending of Love Lockdown, and the entirety of Ultralight Beam.

---

**awryj** (10): Holy shit she really slays, sorry Carly. This song is just so engaging, there are tons of these little melodies and harmonies you can hear. I love it. Seriously considering an 11.

**cyborglilith** (10): Another gem from this album that would have been my second candidate for the 11. Everything about the song is great, including the male voice in the beginning. It just creates a setting where you're sitting in the cafe on a rainy day waiting on your bf (who doesn't exist because you're ugly) and there's a random spy battle going on outside but you're too distracted by the jazz music to care.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Oh wow, what a great bonus track? I’m gonna be pissed if “Just A Little Bit Of Your Heart” outranks this one because this song blows it out of the water. Unlike that song this paints a nuanced picture of a girl who stalwartly loves her man because of how incredible he is. We’re never given any actual indication that he’s actually cheating on her, she just assumes that this must be naturally the case because she thinks that he’s so far above her. She acknowledges that she’s worth of his love, but she still can’t quite come to grips with the fact that it’s real. There’s a story and a character, and the song just sort of trails off because she doesn’t really get resolution. Is her man actually cheating on her or is she just paranoid? She doesn’t know and so we never find out, but the threat of it still looms in the air. A surprisingly nuanced bonus track.

---

**bluehxrizon** (9.5): im screaming because i just realized the instrumental sounds like wii sports resort

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (8): okay this also sounds like a Lifetime soundtrack song but in a good way

letsallpoo: 

**islimp** (10): The way Ari sings "beEEeEeEee yooOooOur onLY ONE" destroys me

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): God, this should've been on Yours Truly

**angusaditus** (9): such a quintessential Ariana song

**musicotic** (9): Catchy and cute

**VeganSquash** (9): very chill...great song

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): tbh the vocal effects keep this from being a 10 bc she dont need all that! let ha voice truly shine!

**mokitsu** (8.5): cute but forgettable

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I expected this to be a filler deluxe edition track, but this is actually really good!

**skargardin** (8.5): This should’ve been on the standard edition.


**eklxtreme** (8): it's sweet and catchy

**MissyBee37** (8): So I own this album, deluxe even, and I don't remember this song at all. But it's really pretty!

**skyblade79** (8): the melody during the chorus is so good!

**superr\_rad** (8): i love the voice thing whatever its called in the chorus, and if it were a bit longer this could easily have fit perfect on the standard album. i love the iwanchu's at the beginning

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): I love the throwback glitzy sound of this, it's like almost a showtune but has a very modern sheen. Unique sound, I kinda wish Ari would revisit it honestly

**Magic\_warlock0-** (7.5): I love the R&B elements in this album, and this track represents a lot of what I love to hear. Ariana’s lack of enunciation strikes again, still hard to understand. Sad!

**twat\_brained** (7.5): :////////// It's filler but it's not necessarily bad

**blue\_heart\_** (7): Decent. I liked the sexy vibe of DW more. Otherwise, The One from Carly did it better.

**jess\_22** (7): this is so smooth

**lexarqade** (7): I love the instrumental on this but it's a bit flat otherwise.

**mudkip1** (7): /u/letsallpoo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is such a small gripe but the number 1 in the title is disgusting.

**Piccprincess** (6.5): I'm not the only one who'd screw Calvin

**10footnotes** (6): These Ariana songs are all starting to blend into each other.

**OberionSynth** (6): I'm literally still listening to this song as I write this and I can't really remember how it goes, so

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): not very memorable

**dropthehammer11** (5.5): Eh it's okay

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): meh

**Qwilphish** (5): Filler, really have no opinion on this track.

**zamomattel** (5): Literally can't remember this form first listen, it is just beige

**Elitefourbrad** (4): A filler track...

**MrSwearword** (4): fluffy pop is not her friend; especially if it’s still shlocked for an “urban” market.

**strawberryswing1** (4): Love you Ari but this is not good

**therokinrolla** (4): the instrumentals to this are literally elevator music

**mdawgig** (2): More mind Teflon. Filler.

"The Lucky One" is a bit of an anomaly in Taylor's discography, namely because it's one of the few songs she has that doesn't even touch on topics of romance at all. Instead, she sings about what the downsides of being famous.

> Your life is constantly also analyzed. There’s a lot of trade-offs. There’s the microscope that’s always on you. The camera flashes, the fear that something you say will be taken the wrong way and you’ll let your fans down. There’s the fear that you’ll be walking down the street and your skirt will blow up and you’ll be in the news for three months.

It's melancholy and gorgeous, and while not fantastic in any way it's still a unique and memorable track from the album. Also I remember reading some theories about how she might've been singing about Shania Twain or Joni Mitchell, which is...a thing to consider, I guess.

---
**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (10): This is the album I'm most excited for from Taylor - a Joni Mitchell influenced folksy album. We probably won't get it till she's in her 40s, but I look forward to it.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): :( “WOULDN’T YOU LIKE TO KNOW”, "Isn’t it strange how it all happens? All my life, I dreamed about the bright lights and big city. You know they tell you it’s going to be glamorous. And they tell you that you have everything. They tell you you’re lucky. And no one tells you how lonely it’s gonna be. And they don’t tell you, when you’re twirling in front of the mirror as a child, what the papers are gonna say about you some day. Cause they don’t tell you that they’re building you up just to knock you down. But they haven’t yet."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Whenever people say that Taylor can't write songs about other topics that is not related to love, I show them this song. This song is basically a ballad about a huge popstar's fame waning down as she gets older to the point she goes into retirement. This song is rumored to be about Joni Mitchell, Shania Twain and Carly Simon, which made sense especially on Shania's case. But for me, I think this song is low-key also about Taylor's fear of going down the same path that her idols went through, espcially anything Taylor does is always watched by the media. This is basically Taylor's take on Britney's iconic hit "Lucky", which unfortunately prophesied Britney's breakdown. While I don't see Taylor having the same level of breakdown as Britney, it nonetheless deals with a similiar topic.

**superr\_rad** (9): im a sucker for those swing-ish doo-wop inspired drums, and i think this song is taylor realizing what a massive star she is and very few people will understand how that really is. still snek tho

**10footnotes** (8.5): Several years ago I was reading Catcher in the Rye in an English class. I had to compile a soundtrack for it as a project, and I put this song and Starlight on my soundtrack. Considering that I had very little musical knowledge or accessibility, I feel like these were pretty solid choices.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I remember this being one of the deep cuts from Red that I listened to before I listened to the album as a whole. It holds up well. I know the whole 'Taylor only writes about LOVE1!1!1' complaint is sexist and overblown, but it really is nice to see her writing memorable lyrics about other topics.

**Piccprincess** (10): I wish the lover in my foyer was Calvin Harris

---

**rickikardashian** (9): _This is a story about a girl named Lucky ..._

**fifthchevron** (10): "She's so lucky, she's a star but she cry cry cries in her lonely heart thinking..". I have to say the lyric "Your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you" is...surprising considering some of the theories going around. It's interesting how she became an even bigger star after this album considering this is how she felt about fame.

**jess\_22** (9): Britney's 'Lucky' Pt. 2

**lady\_sable** (9): Really underrated. It kind of reminds of Britney's "Lucky", actually.

**nooodisaster** (5): Why listen to this when "Lucky" already exists?

**OberionSynth** (6): she's so lucky, she's a star....

**reddituser206** (7.5): not quite as good as when Britney did it

**lexarqade** (2): Britney who?

**RandomDKguy** (8.5): Joni Mitchell who?.

---

**OwenKam50** (9): I once downloaded a pitched version on youtube and thought it was the original

**Nfranklin50** (10): It's crazy when you think about how this song was inspired by a star who lived this life and Taylor wrote it mirroring herself and now she is fully living it

**therokinrolla** (10): FUCK those first two seconds that let you know the song is oncoming are chilling, like, i literally get chills from this amazing story of a famous girl that has fame get to her. FUCK.

**wailordfan** (10): I love this song simply because of the change in theme for Taylor. This is completely different then anything Taylor has written about in the past, and it makes for a really refreshing song lyrically.

**poppinmmolly** (9.5): I love the story that this tells!

**Elitefourbrad** (8): I liked this track, Taylor is one lucky girl.

**enecks** (8): This is a better infusion of pop into country.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I wish this picked up in the tempo. This could be a bop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): “I just did this whole album and I need to emphasize how bad my past relationships were, so I’ll through this one in.”

**eklxtreme** (7.5): the instrumentation is good and carries the song

**Magic\_warlock0-** (7.5): Not bad at all. I love how a normal person's relationship with Taylor is given a good story here, the subject is interesting and the smooth tone of Swift's voice lends itself to a good song

**mokitsu** (7): i'm bopping!

**supersecrettest** (7): This song is good, but I can’t put my finger on why I like it better than the other slower songs on the album. Whatever I like what I like

**Leixander** (6): Obligatory Lana made it better.

**mdawgig** (6): Filler, but good-ish filler.

**zamomattel** (6): Much better songs on the album, but pleasant enough

**CharmingArsenal** (5.5): So many of these tracks sound the same. This one is no exception.

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**dropthehammer11** (5): This one isnt the worst, the old school feel is nice. Too bad Taylor sucks and does nothing with it

**MissyBee37** (5): My least favorite on the main album. I don't know, just not my cup of tea. Too repetitive, in a bad way, and kind of boring.

**refrayn** (5): the chorus is so bad

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): meh

**twat\_brained** (5): So… this person became "lucky" because they made a living for themselves and became successful? It's hard to follow along with this one.

**BionicFunhouse** (4): Oh, this song again.

**johnazoidberg-** (4): This album has more filler than my mattress (it's memory foam, ladies hit me up). At least this filler is faster than 2 beats per minute.

**Qwilphish** (2): I've heard this song 5 times in a row now

**skyblade79** (2): how boring and generic

**MrSwearword** (1): …is whoever skips this literal first draft of State of Grace.

She's talked about being a big fan of Joni Mitchell, so that's the theory I always believed. I think it's an interesting concept for a song; but the song itself still doesn't do much for me.

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/kX1mnY0z)

**BreezySeason** (10): Queen of not caring bout her lipstick

---
The way Carly chants in the chorus really bothers me; her voice sounds really robotic and doesn't fit in with the rest of the song. But overall I adore it; it carries the same bubblegum brightness that defines *Kiss* and Carly's overall artistic style.

---
**awryj** (11): The drums, the synth solo, the melody! Kavinsky who?

---

**OberionSynth** (8): HALSEY WHO

**VeganSquash** (3): Halsey did it better

**blue\_heart\_** (4): give Drive by Halsey your 10s!

**skyblade79** (2): drive by halsey outpeaked

**lady\_sable** (9.5): Halsey did it better but this is still really good.

**therokinrolla** (6): halsey did it better

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I can’t help but feel like I’ve heard this exact song on this album before. The “lovelovelovelove” part sounds bad. Also the lyrics are confusing and pointless. Shouldn’t she be saying “leave it all behind US” rather than “YOU” because saying “you” implies that he’s driving away without her? What do driving and lipstick have to do with one another? At least it has the sense to be short.

**MrSwearword** (4): “This is like K-POP, one sentence does not make sense with another sentence.” - Willam

**superr\_rad** (7): is this about road head?? this is about road head

**Elitefourbrad** (4): I have a feeling that Carly would be an awful driver because she’s too busy shuffling songs on her iPod via the aux cord.

**johnazoidberg-** (7): Carly doesn't care about her lipstick. Taylor brings up red lipstick every chance she gets. I figured out the next big pop feud.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): We're finally back to a good song. It's nothing more than decent, though. Nothing stands out about it. Insert obvious Vroom Vroom joke here.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Pop perfection at its finest. I think this song aged really well into 2017 and I really hope it still does.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh my god I love love love this song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Invented cars

**supersecrettest** (10): This feels like the predecessor to Let’s get lost.

**mdawgig** (9.5): Bouncy fun with stellar production.

**enecks** (9): I want a movie like Drive but the Driver listens to seriously uncool pop music like this.

**henry413** (9): Miley who?

**Leixander** (9): A surprising light of hope near the end of album.

**skiddos** (9): This is way too catchy.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): a bop to vogue to. it actually benefits from the super basic sign structure

**luigi\_is\_better** (8.5): she was driving before deciding to run (away with them) ugh what a queen

**twat\_brained** (8.5): This feels like if "I Really Like You" was a Kiss track, which is great because both sound really well put-together!

**CharmingArsenal** (8): I like all the bonus tracks for Kiss, but I don't have any much to say about any of them. Such is the nature of bonus tracks I guess.

**musicotic** (8): Drive to the store ;)

**Piccprincess** (7.5): Drive me to Calvin's house

**rickikardashian** (7.5): Queen of driving

**cyborglilith** (7): all we do is drive; all we do is talk about the feelings that we hide

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): me but i can't drive and i don't have a boyfriend

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): ugh this reminded me of the road test I just failed :(

**zamomattel** (6.5): Miley did it better

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**dropthehammer11** (6): Is this song about sex? I love me some coitus

**skargardin** (6): The hook is..something. “I just wanna drive you to love, love, love” sounds..weird for some reason.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Sugar Rating: Jawbreaker The Size of a Small Planetoid

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): Let's Get Lost did this better tbh

**refrayn** (5): not sure if this is boring or if it’s just overshadowed by the rest of the bops in this album

**10footnotes** (4): This song is so... nothing that I actually dislike it, unlike some of the other fluff songs that I'm impartial about.

**jess\_22** (4): this just would not end

**mokitsu** (4): filler

**Magic\_warlock0-** (3): Weak song, and pretty forgettable. Had to listen about three times to actually pay attention to this dull beat

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/1ShvLayS)

**BreezySeason** (10): Queen of being your sweetie

---
This is a theatrical bop and a half. Like I could see this being used in a movie trailer or something (buy "Cut to the Feeling" on iTunes) because it's so feel-good and grand. Fun fact: She performed this on "Shake it Up," so it means Carly got to be blessed by being in the presence of Bella Thorne.

---

**rickikardashian** (8): The word sweetie is ruined for me because it sounds so fucking condescending

**zamomattel** (7.5): sweaty

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): sweaty (:

**blue\_heart\_** (3): sweatie :)

**mokitsu** (5): SWEETIE...!

**Johnnytoby** (5): youre doing great

---

**10footnotes** (6.5): My parents used to call me this, so this song makes me a little uncomfortable, but musically I really (really, really, really, really, really) like it, especially the change to the chorus at the very end.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): One of the bonus tracks added to Kiss, it’s about when you least expect it, your true love will appear out of nowhere. It’s a sugary, bubblegum pop song, but it’s Carly at her best. The harmonies are amazing here as well as the synths, showing that Carly knows her 80’s well ahead of Emotion. This is easily one of the best songs I’ve heard by Carly for sure!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Cute. Literally can’t think of anything else to say about it, it’s cute. It’s a Carly song and it’s cute. Yay. She sings about having a glass of wine, which is probably the edgiest line on this album. Carly was 27 when she wrote this, I’m all for maintaining a childlike heart but she’s really selling this “young girl next-door” persona hard and I’ll be real, it got weird over the course of the album.

**Qwilphish** (4): What a bad song to end this mixed bag of an album. Songs like this are the issue with this album - was probably created in .2 seconds to push out this album unfortunately. Very one tone and when you think something is going to change, nope it goes right back to the chorus.

**TeamAwesome4** (9): Carly being Nostradamus predicting the 8th world wonder, that is, of course, the Emotion album.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is really good teen pop y'all.

**superr\_rad** (10): this is pure bubblegum sugar ball realness and its absolutely perfect tbh

**supersecrettest** (10): The strings here are great and I really like this one a ton.

**lady\_sable** (9): Adorable and upbeat

**mdawgig** (9): The good side of twee. And that production!

**musicotic** (9): I love the production

**Piccprincess** (9): What Calvin will call me after sex, hopefully

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2FUDyjWB2U

**henry413** (8.5): Back when Jack Antonoff actually wrote good pop songs.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): This feels like an upturn from the past couple of tracks, but still nowhere near the first half of the album.

**eklxtreme** (8): cute sweet bop

**enecks** (8): This production seems like it foreshadows Emotion.

**islimp** (8): Cute, light-hearted, and catchy!!! The past 4 tracks were def an underwhelming bunch of fillers so this is a step up

**johnazoidberg-** (8): This song sounds like what would happen if that one Dream Street song was actually good

**Leixander** (8): Sounds like an Emotion Side C track, which is cool.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Sugar Rating: The Golden Gate Bridge Constructed Entirely of Hershey Bars

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): This is cute.

**awryj** (7): Tbh it's a worse version of Call Me Maybe

**therokinrolla** (6.5): not very sweet

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (6): Fun fact - Sara Quin of Tegan & Sara co-wrote this!

**jess\_22** (6): lyrics are cheesy as hell, but a bop nonetheless

**refrayn** (6): honestly this is cute until “i could be your sweetie”

**skargardin** (6): The very definition of a filler track.

**skyblade79** (6): not as bad as the name is

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**dropthehammer11** (5): This album is falling apart oh no

**Magic\_warlock0-** (5): Eh. Her other love songs are better than this basic and uninteresting one, though

**VeganSquash** (5): cute song

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4.5): this could have been worse

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): not something I'd go back to. The innocent/cute thing is a little overdone here.

**lexarqade** (4): The only thing I can think of is when people use "sweetie (:" in condescending online arguments

**luigi\_is\_better** (4): antonoff co-wrote this? mess.

**MrSwearword** (4): “There’s an Eighth World Wonder” what the fuck is this, steal a Kimberly Locke song title hour?

**OberionSynth** (4): again, this just feels kinda generic

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): Carly, sweetie, please stop this album. It's not working for you.

**whatyourheartdesires** (3): Sweetie is such an ugly word, I think only grandmas and Carly use it

**cyborglilith** (1): I was happy thinking that this was the last Kiss track because the rest aren't on Spotify :(

This is way too boring for me. *My Everything* is already full of ballads - why was this one necessary? It sounds like a Disney song. I'm pretty sure they included this just so they could talk about how Harry Styles was a contributer to the album.

---

**cyborglilith** (0): I don't even want to comment on how trashy this song is tbh

---

**twat\_brained** (10): HARRRRRRYYYYYYYYYY-*smacks self* sorry, I re-entered my teenage 1D phase again. Anyway, this is a beautiful song that displays Ariana's vocal prowess to absolute perfection!

**mokitsu** (9.5): just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart just a little bit oyo heart that's all i'm asking for

**Qwilphish** (9.5): It's a bit slow but once the strings kick in it's so beautiful. Also, I'm sure people are gonna drag the chorus for sounding like the ROOOAAR from Roar lmao, but it's honestly the best part of this song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2.5): Boring. It’s not that I dislike ballads, and it’s kind of pretty but it feels very plodding and it goes nowhere. Ariana is her usual luminous self, but she shoulders the sole burden of making this track listenable and the song itself helps her like a concrete block around her ankles. It’s repetitive, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but there’s no meat to this song. It’s the most shallow song on the album, there’s no nuance or character or even specificity to it. She’s just being willowy and accepting that this guy is gonna treat her badly, she’s supplicating herself for love in the least interesting way possible, and we never get any reasons for why. Is this how men think that women think? Is Ariana Grande starring in some weird modern adaptation of Madame Butterfly that I didn’t know about? It’s the most basic piano ballad imaginable, cloying, manipulative, and empty. Later on the album “Only 1” does the exact same concept much better.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I think Harry Styles cowrote this song (if he didn't, don't shade me) and now that we have solo material from him...it really shows. A boring piano ballad that somehow...manages to be...not that boring? Sounds like a staple for easy listening radio.

---

**fifthchevron** (9): PSA: This song was written by Harry Styles.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song proved to me that Harry Styles has a gift. And he deserves way more credit.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Listen to the Harry Styles' album y'all.

**raicicle** (6): I think there’s definitely such thing as being too sentimental, and I think this crosses the line. Ariana has achieved similarly heartfelt sentiments without being so suffocating. I blame it on Harry.

**strawberryswing1** (8): I expected a little better from you Harry. Solid ballad overall, but I skip it most of the time.

---

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Wonderful, heartfelt ballad, but very strangely placed in between two songs that are literally about sex. Odd decision.

**angusaditus** (7.5): we love a sidechick anthem

**zamomattel** (7.5): Ariana Grande, tonight you gave us a Little Bit of Your Heart, but we were left with heart palpitations. You're safe.

**Piccprincess** (10): I just want a little bit of Calvin's ~~dick~~ heart

**musicotic** (9): Really pretty song, fantastic vocals

**OberionSynth** (9): ariana sings from the viewpoint of all of her thirsty ass fans

**VeganSquash** (9): again, its repetitive, but I love Ariana's ballads so...

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): A really nice, powerful ballad, the production on this album is knocking me back consistently

**therokinrolla** (8.5): oh my lorde this is an unexpectedly pretty ballad. This really suits ha!!!

**eklxtreme** (8): it's a very sweet piano ballad that manages to capture your attention.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): An amazing ballad from Ariana. The vocals and the piano! YASSSS GIRL!

**enecks** (8): Another good pop song

**Magic\_warlock0-** (8): Romantic and sweet. When Ari sings low and deep, I can really vibe with her tunes. A solid song, I really dig the desire and heartful emotion here!

**lady\_sable** (7.5): Pretty

**awryj** (7): A little bit generic, but it's alright

**ignitethephoenix** (7): She sounds great as usual, but it's just a little bit boring

**skargardin** (7): Look, she sings like an angel but in every other sense this ballad is so average.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A nice piano ballad, probably at the right time in the album, and it’s not something I go back to, but I really appreciate a sample of her vocal prowess.

**10footnotes** (6): A pretty song, but not one I would actively seek out and listen to outside of this rate.

**blue\_heart\_** (6): This is, impressively, one of the choruses I've seen through the years that says the least. What's the point of it?

**mdawgig** (6): A ballad arrangement that actually works on an album full of ballads that do not.

**refrayn** (6): im a fool for u ariana but not this much a fool

**skyblade79** (6): so cute!

**TragicKingdom1** (6): Definitely the weaker ballad on this album, I get major middle school talent show vibes from this. Ari's vocals keep it from being bad.

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**MrSwearword** (5): it feels a bit rushed in the delivery of the verses. The chorus is lovely but it’s boring.

**dropthehammer11** (4): Ari pls make bangers not ballads

**henry413** (4): Another boring song.

**Johnnytoby** (4): ew sorry ari

**Leixander** (4): Too repetitive and easily the worst ballad(?) here.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): uff ugh

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this sounds like it belongs in a disney movie, but those shitty sequels like Bambi 2 or Cinderella 3.

**jess\_22** (3): had potential but is WAY too repetitive

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (2): she can do good slow songs but this isn't one of them.

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): i'm a very vocal supporter of good ballads. this isn't one

What a weird collaboration. Gary Lightbody is from the band Snow Patrol, which you probably know from their song "Chasing Cars," which I only know because a local radio station back home will play it every thirty minutes. This song really wasn't single material, and it's fairly standard as far as piano-insipred ballads go. I do like how heavenly their layered voices sounds leading into the chorus, though.

---

**johnazoidberg-** (0): Nothing like a mainstream artist taking me on a journey to Indie Hell. It's like she wrote this song to be played in coffee shops that advertise how they're a local, small business but are lowkey owned by Starbucks. It sounds like a pumpkin chai latte with almond milk that's been sitting at your desk for 3 days. Make it stop. Please.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (0): By far the worst song I had the unfortunate chance to hear. It's not emotional, it's not interesting, it's just bland and terrible.

---

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): the first time I listened to Red I remember this being my least favourite track but honestly it's so beautiful it's so good it'll get dragged but it's so good Snow Patrol could never

**twat\_brained** (5): This makes me want to fall asleep, which is not what I want as I'm trying to get this in by midnight, but what else should I expect from a collab with the lead singer of the band who made "Chasing Cars"? And why's he trying so hard to sound like Chris Martin? The only Martin I want *NEAR* this rate is **MAX**! LET'S LEAVE IT THAT WAY!!!!!

**Nfranklin50** (10): Easily one of the most under rated collabs in Taylor's discography. Gary sounds so cold and taylor sounds so broken yet hopeful they just get this perfect from every aspect

**wailordfan** (10): Taylor's voice works so well with the lower register of Gary Lightbody. It is an amazing, slow song until you hit the (basic, but well fit) guitar rift and the emotional bridge, you can't help but love it.

**blue\_heart\_** (9.5): This song, structurally, kind of reminds me of Somebody That I Used to Know. First the guy gives his part of the story, and then the girl shares hers, putting the other in a worse light. In my opinion, Taylor does it better, but it might just be because I also see myself in this, in both of them. It takes a lot to go from talking to someone a lot to not at all in a moment and god knows I've tried to get back to him.

**superr\_rad** (1): zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

**patronsaintofaspies** (3): The melody of this one is good, and I love the guitar solo in this one, but Gary Lightbody's voice is so fucking lifeless. His vocals in Chasing Cars is one of the reasons why I hate that song and they're even worse here. Even Taylor can't save it. His voice drops the score of this song a *lot*.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Again, Taylor shows that she can do pop-rock. Taylor, please make songs like this on TS6!! And holy fuck, the outro of this song is amazing.

**jess\_22** (10): why is this so underrated? the instrumentals are a masterpiece.

**lady\_sable** (10): Another song that really has to grow on you; I used to find it forgettable, but honestly it's one of Taylor's prettiest songs. Their voices work so well together.

**raicicle** (5.5): I mean, Chasing Cars was a great song, but lesser, longer, and more painstakingly patience-testing versions of that song aren’t really what this album wanted. I also don’t think they make the greatest duet partners, with Taylor’s very bright tone of voice basically entirely masking Gary Lightbody’s harmonies the whole time (which don’t sound the most comfortable). The balance only ever gets corrected at the very end, when Gary’s actually singing over Taylor and at a volume above a slight whisper.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): “I got this really ballady song and I want it to be a duet but I want someone who makes music even more fit for network dramas about hospitals than I am. Snow Patrol? Holy shit, yes!”

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): I get some weird nostalgia out of this song because I used to listening to Chasing Cars in like 2006, it's really not bad either. It's a sweet duet, the instrumentation is pretty good, and the vocals compliment each other. It might be the most enjoyment I've ever gotten out of a Taylor song

letsallpoo: 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): I’M NOT CRYING “LA ON YOUR BREAK”

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): UNDERRATED EMOTIONAL MOMENT

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Y'all know I love some some White Excellence™ and tbh? They delivered.

**Piccprincess** (9.5): I can't count how many people I had to tell that this guy is from Snow Patrol and no he's not just a rando.

**CharmingArsenal** (9): This is the best thing I've heard on this album so far, but sadly Taylor seems like a guest on her own track.

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): i love this song, it's very melancholic and it reminds me of my HS graduation even though i hated school and the people in it

**poppinmmolly** (9): I like that this an experimental sound.

**PuggleMaster** (9): a cute collab

**therokinrolla** (9): this song blows me away every time. Idk who tf gary is, but he has a voice that matches taylor’s very well

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): wow this is legitimately good.

**10footnotes** (8): The bridge is the best part – it’s a change from the rest of the song, and it sounds so good.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Both Taylor’s and Gary’s voices go so well together, the perfect duet!

**OwenKam50** (8): Who dat

**TouchItAG** (8): Male Shakira ruins it. Otherwise a 10/10.

**zamomattel** (8): Really pretty song, but having someone else makes me realise how annoying Swift's voice is

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Basically just a Snow Patrol song but I like the guitar solo.

**eklxtreme** (7): decent duet, Gary's voice was nice. Kinda slow but sweet

**enecks** (7): This will be the last time I hear this pleasant but forgettable song.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This is a really nice duet and I love the instrumentals. Just I feel like something is missing from it to make it even better.

**Johnnytoby** (7): cant relate but its not bad

**Qwilphish** (7): The feature makes this song not as boring as other songs that are follow the same country map.

**mdawgig** (6.5): Too long and too slow. The buildup is good, but it takes too long; it's no Treacherous.

**mokitsu** (6.5): a very cute song that didn't deserve to be a single

**cyborglilith** (6): soooooo boring

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**Leixander** (6): Too moody to be between the happiest tracks of this album.

**OberionSynth** (6): Nothing really special and I'm not really feeling the duet thing

**angusaditus** (5): This sounds too much like a snow patrol song

**skyblade79** (5): why does this guy sound like he has hot oatmeal in his mouth

**TeamAwesome4** (4): Wait, is it the last time you're asking me?  You didn't make that clear.

**VeganSquash** (3.5): unremarkable

**supersecrettest** (3): This song dragged on for me. didn't love it.

**MrSwearword** (1): so bland, uninteresting and Taylor’s vocals are drowned out like she’s in Carpool Karaoke.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): this guys voice is annoying and this drags on forever oh my god when will it end

**strawberryswing1** (1): Wtf is this. Snow Patrol you deserve better.

Members of the sub rate the individual songs from 1 to 10, then send their scores to whoever is "hosting" the rate. You have about a month to listen to the albums, assign scores, then send them in. A couple weeks after the deadline the host reveals the rankings from lowest total score to highest. The reveals are long and messy, so they are divided up into three days.

InfernalSolstice: A rate here is traditionally a rating of songs from 3 albums that are in some way related (there are other formats too, we have a Grammy song of the year ome coming up, a Billboard Year-End Number 1 one a few months ago, and a Nickolodeon/Disney Channel star one recently). 

First, the rate is selected in a (I believe) tri-annually (3 times a year, not once every 3 years) rate suggestion thread (might be 4 times a year not totally sure). There people suggest their ideas, and they're chosen based on both the amount of interest the idea generates with the users, as well as moderator input. Usually 2 are selected per month.

At the beginning of the month, a rate thread is posted. There, the host(s) of the rate (usually, but not always, the people who suggest it) introduce the rate idea, as well as an overview of what we will be rating.

Then, each user who wants to participate listens to the listed songs/watches the designated music videos/whatever. You give each one a rating on a scale from 1-10. You can give one song an 11 (your favorite) and one a 0 (your least favorite) (you don't need to give a 0 or 11, but many do). The rest of it is free range over the number of each number you use (though minimum averages for artists are often set to prevent sabotage, usually pretty damn low though). When you are done designating scores, you send the scores in via a prepared link to the hosts, and you can add comments fleshing out your scores if you wish.

The scores are all accepted by the end of the month that the rate is for (extensions are usually given out too to boost participation). The averages are calculated, which creates the list of overall sub faborite to overall sub least favorite.

This thread is day 1 of the reveal. The results are revealed usually over the course of 3 days in our plug.dj room, where a host plays songs/videos for everyone. They are revealed in order from the lowest ranking song to the highest. 

But the most important step is to throw a massive fit when every song that you consider above mediocre is eliminated, no matter how long it survives.
