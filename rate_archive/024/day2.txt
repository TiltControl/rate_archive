# #30: [Ariana Grande - Intro](https://imgur.com/IGGJLv6)

**Average:** 6.770 **// Total Points:** 866.5 **// Controversy:** 2.189 **// [Listen here](https://youtu.be/gQHU6ZAvJB4)**

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x1) blue\_heart\_ (2 x4) BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU, johnazoidberg-, SendMeYourSATScores, treesoutsidemywindow 

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/LFwfJQYf)

---
I'm a bit confused about why this is so high. I mean, it's certainly pretty and atmospheric but like...it's just a minute of Ariana harmonizing with herself.

---
**Raykel** (11): It's short and sweet and that's what makes it so amazing. The harmonies are like candy and the piano closing the song sounds like you're floating to heaven.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I adore everything about this track. This is one of the tracks that first grabbed me and drew me to Ariana, it was the first “intro” type track I had ever heard for a pop album (don’t judge) and I was fascinated. I was disappointed when I found out that the album wasn’t a concept album because I love those, but honestly as time has gone on the intro has still remained my favorite piece on the whole dang thing. I just find the message of the song so beautiful. “I’ll give you all I have, and nothing less I promise…” It’s silly but one time I tried to make a playlist that summed up my personality, like a playlist that defined all the elements of me as a person, and I picked this as the opening track because it really taught me something. In life you just kind of have to… give your all to the people you love, because if you want them with you then you need to give them “your everything” and I felt that I really do try hard and this track captured that. Plus it sounds gorgeous, Ariana has never sounded better with those looping layered melodies over that drippy, minimalistic track… ~~yeah it’s my 11 and I stand by that.~~ Edit: I resubmitted my scores and changed this because after careful consideration and disillusionment with how rate works I felt the need to throw my 11 behind another track, but honestly if this gets out day 1 I’m gonna be sad.

**MissyBee37** (8): I love how this Intro sets the mood for the album. It may only be a minute, but it's a pretty use of a minute to show-off the softer side of Ariana's lovely voice, so I'm all for this intro.

**wailordfan** (5): I've seen people saying THIS IS A BOP or IT IS ONE OF THE BEST TRACKS. Honey. Its an intro of Ariana ad libbing a bit. We will get close to the same kind of adlibs throughout the album. This ain't special.

**Qwilphish** (10): I really really really wish this song was longer. It's so beautiful, her harmonies are dreamy, the strings are heavenly and everything just brings a really warm feeling that makes everything feel good. "I'll give you all I have and nothing less I promise / Love me and don't look back, I want you with me" is such beautiful imagery. This would be my 11 if there was even one more verse.

---

**mudkip1** (8): /u/letsallpoo

**dirdbub** (10): I crave death and I probably fucked up all my scores on this album but I don't care

**RandomDKguy** (3): The fact this is a intro followed by Problem is hilarious

**cloudbustingmp3** (3.5): a cute vocal showcase but this right before Problem is so disjointed (which is this album's biggest... Problem)

**skiddos** (10): OLT should’ve followed this instead of Problem. What an amazing way to start the album.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (2): it kind of reminds me of Kaleidoscope Heart by Sara Bareilles but more boring

**twat\_brained** (7.5): It's cute but no album opener Ariana puts out will ever be as iconic as Moonlight; it even stole Demi Lovato's thunder! What does this steal? Probably one of Kiss' songs from a day 2 spot.

**strawberryswing1** (10): Show us that beautiful voice girl! 13 million Spotify steams for a simple a capella, when will your fave

**Piccprincess** (6): The beginning to the love story about me and Calvin

**zamomattel** (7.5): Ariana Grande, tonight your Intro left us gagging for more. You're safe.

letsallpoo: 


**Damoojo** (10): Her voice sounds so heavenly in this.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is literally the best intro ever. Ariana's vocals are so fucking lovely here.

**gannade** (10): This intro is so pretty

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Why is this not longer? She sounds so angelic here.

**PuggleMaster** (10): a perfect intro

**superr\_rad** (10): what? i like it.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): this was a real surprise going into this album blind. love it

**enecks** (9): Ariana is underrated as an album artist. This introduction is so pleasant?

**henry413** (9): Should be a full-length song. Honeymoon Avenue and Moonlight are better though.

**Johnnytoby** (9): i cant believe this will prob chart higher than problemmm

**OberionSynth** (9): if this was a full song it would tie moonlight for being my favorite ariana song ever

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Such a beautiful intro. Like the fucking end of a movie, and I want to cry. Just so goddamn beautiful.

**angusaditus** (8.5): I could not imagine a more heavenly intro

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): What a sweet intro, Ari's vocal harmonies are straight heavenly on this

**eklxtreme** (8): sweet vibes, very harmonic, but I expected more

**Magic\_warlock0-** (8): This started off the album very well, I really love the instruments and the almost heavenly sounds!

**mokitsu** (8): cute intro, it's no "christmas & chill" intro tho

**musicotic** (8): I like the harmony

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is a pretty good intro, and Ariana's vocals are heavenly here, but, IDK, I feel like it's missing something. More unique and layered instrumentals? Eh.

**refrayn** (8): vocal queen

**agentofscranton** (7): it's not even 90 seconds long and i'm crying

**cyborglilith** (7): this would have been better as an interlude

**jess\_22** (7): why are Ariana's intros always so good?

**lady\_sable** (7): why we rating the intro tho? In all seriousness it shows off her voice nicely.

**mdawgig** (7): This is kinda sweet but unnecessary.

**reddituser206** (7): Ariana earns those Mariah comparisons as long as she doesn't have to sing real words

**rickikardashian** (7): It’s a cute intro and is well done, there’s just not much to it lol

**skargardin** (7): A cute intro. I’ve always liked it.

**VeganSquash** (7): better than Problem, lets be honest here

**triptoyourheart** (6.5): Beautiful a Capella, I just wish it was longer.

**Elitefourbrad** (6): I’m a fan of intros, and I’m glad Ariana is using one for this amazing album!

**skyblade79** (6): awe it’s pretty

**supersecrettest** (6): Fine

**dropthehammer11** (5.5): Intros are rare in pop albums. I applaud the effort here. Not bad

**floofeh** (5.5): a reluctant six, if only because I'd skip it in a playlist. It is a nice intro if you're listening to the entire album.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): It's an intro

**ImADudeDuh** (5): stop making album intros @everyone

**MrSwearword** (5): it’s an afterthought at best, needless addon if worse.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): ok

**therokinrolla** (4): its not that it is “bad” its just really unecessary, especially leading into a song very different from this “intro”

**10footnotes** (3): I mean… It’s an intro. It doesn’t have a lot going on at the moment.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): this is still boring as fuck, moonlight did it better as an intro track

**lexarqade** (3): Well I guess this exists?

**johnazoidberg-** (2): I'm an individual song guy more than I am an album guy. Intro tracks are the bane of my existence

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): my god that was boring

**blue\_heart\_** (1): no comment

**Average:** 6.906 **// Total Points:** 884.0 **// Controversy:** 1.550 **// [Listen here](https://youtu.be/aZbnAx-pt0Y)**

---
**Highest scores:** (10 x4) angusaditus, islimp, mdawgig, SpanKKy1 (9.5 x4) BearlyEvenAPun, jamesfog, JoshuaReddit, MirandaCrocsgrove (9 x7) bluehxrizon, cyborglilith, ForretressArtillery, Kaylaboe, Nerdy\_boy\_chris, reddituser206, supersecrettest (8.5 x2) Damoojo, InfernalSolstice 

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x2) BlasiFeelsSwift, SendMeYourSATScores (3 x1) callmetidle 

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/E6XSyprE)

**BreezySeason** (7): Queen of almost saying she loves you

---
This bops so hard I don't even mind how nursery-rhyme-y it all sounds. I like the little guitar flourishes in the chorus as well as the little sighs. You can really tell which songs they bothered putting effort into when those little details crop up.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I feel like Miranda Cosgrove would have killed this song, it actually reminds me a lot of “Kissin U.” Actually, would I like this whole album better if it were a Miranda Cosgrove album? Probably.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The chorus is weirdly nursery-rhyme-ish? Like, I find it to be super basic and annoying when I analyse it. Everything else about this track is good enough for me to ignore it, though.

**twat\_brained** (7): This is evident filler, more than slightly reminiscent of "The One That Got Away". The bridge reminds me of First Time, though, so it's got that going for itself.

**MrSwearword** (4): this is a blander The One That Got Away

---

**enecks** (6): I wanted her career to be more than a memory to the GP. Oh well. RAWM is too good for the masses.

**mokitsu** (6): in memory of carly rae's career 2012-2012

**10footnotes** (6): This sounds like a sitcom theme song.

**Elitefourbrad** (5): This sound didn’t leave me with a good memory.

letsallpoo: 


**islimp** (10): BRUHHHHHHH MY HEART ACHES WHENEVER THIS SONG COMES UP

**mdawgig** (10): That descending "aaaahhh" on the chorus gives me frission. Perfect, perfect, perfect.

**cyborglilith** (9): YES

**Kaylaboe** (9): probably is the one song that would fit in perfectly in emotion

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Carly can make some outstanding pop y'all.

**supersecrettest** (9): Yeah this song sounds like a lot of the rest of the songs, but I really like this sound she had, so I’m rating everything highly.

**awryj** (8): She did Taylor Swift better than Taylor Swift

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (8): I love love love this question.

**eklxtreme** (8): sweet song with a big chorus

**musicotic** (8): Best song besides Good Time so far, but it still reeks of sameness

**refrayn** (8): i really like the prod, but the chorus is a bit lackluster

**superr\_rad** (8): im feeling the producition of this album!!! this song is a little generic, but im still in it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Sugar Rating: Chocolate Cookie That Ends Up Having Some Raisins In It

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): so catchy omg I gotta go listen to EMOTION

**VeganSquash** (8): first non-single that I've remotely liked lol

**ExtraEater** (7.5): less

**lady\_sable** (7.5): Kinda forgettable tbh, but it's fun and upbeat

**zamomattel** (7.5): This is cute, it made it to my Best of Carly playlist

**Piccprincess** (6.5): Sadly, I (and this song) will be not even be a memory to Calvin

**Qwilphish** (6.5): Cute and chill. Reminds me of a nighttime ride. Not much else to say about it, kind of a whatever song.

**skargardin** (6.5): This is basic at best.

**jess\_22** (6): cute

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): that bridge tho

**OberionSynth** (6): pretty good but not really anything special

**therokinrolla** (6): queen of guitar strums. Disappointing tho, the song doesn’t have the **BANG** that a bubblegum pop song needs

**chili\_jones** (5): why does this sound like an old 1d song

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**Leixander** (5): Forgettable.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (5): Clearly the song is a lie, I've already forgotten it. Just not that interesting

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): I want to forget about this

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): not playful enough and has too many cliches

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/B2560v54)

**BreezySeason** (7): Queen of her heart skipping a beat

---
A fucking bop about getting your ass ripped apart or something. Ms. Jepsen bequeathed y'all a disco ho anthem and you did her like this. Only a subreddit full of prudes would deny this masterpiece its rightful top 10 placing.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (3): Hurt so Good, more like Hurt so Bad. Again another dated sounding song which is just annoying and headache inducing with a the cluttered over done production and choppy vocals.

**supersecrettest** (10): I think I’m leaving too many 10s (this is my first rate) but I really like these songs. Oh wait the Justin bieber one is coming up I’ll give that a low score.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): See, the issue with Kiss is that there’s a genuinely good album in there, but it was clearly rushed. This song has a lot of potential but it needs polishing and clarity to become good. The intro is fantastic, and the chorus is good too, and the lyrics are okay, but the problem is that the song doesn’t quite go anywhere. It languishes around the exact same level of energy and volume the entire time, the energetic beat becomes a drawback at a certain point because it just kind of takes over the song, which becomes a wall of sound. I have my qualms with Carly as a vocalist (mainly her limited range) and they’re especially apparent here. It’s not bad but it’s pretty generic and of all the songs on the album this one blends in the most.

---

**skyblade79** (4): the astrid s Hurts So Good is way better (use it for the intermission post plz!)

**twat\_brained** (9.5): Astrid S WHO?!?!?! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE BANGER!

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6): John Mellencamp did it better, honey, but it’s not a bad little song about the impact of a good love

---

**dirdbub** (7): queen of writing songs about gay sex

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): when he doesn't prep your hole enough but you're too greedy for love to care

**SpanKKy1** (5): an ode to anal

**Piccprincess** (6): This song title describes sex with Calvin, I bet

**refrayn** (10): B O P BOP BOP BOP BO P !!!!!!!!!!!!!

**CharmingArsenal** (9.5): I miss the days of just fun bubblegum pop. Thank you Carly for bring that to us in this day and age.

**mdawgig** (9.5): It's kind of amazing when even an album's mid-tier tracks are total fucking bops.

**eklxtreme** (9): very danceable bop with a nice chorus

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I love the way these songs sound omg

**OberionSynth** (9): a certified B O P™

**skargardin** (9): Wtf even more of disco heaven. I’m so shook after reading all of the negative comments about this album.

**lady\_sable** (8.5): I love the "eh"s towards the end

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Really nice track, I'm unfortunately going to label it as the point where the album stops being consistent. Don't @ me.

**musicotic** (8): Catchy and well constructed

**superr\_rad** (8): so this is the 8th track and i still havent heard filler tracks???? im so fuckin shook and angry at myself for sleeping on this

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Sugar Rating: Deep-Fried Chocolate Icing

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (7): it's a bit overproduced which is a common problem on this album but still good

**floofeh** (7): definitely one of her younger sounding songs, but it's an earworm that won't leave.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): catchy, but lacks substance (I'm not exactly sure what I mean by that tbh but it just felt right)

**zamomattel** (7): Kind of just blends in here

**MissyBee37** (6.5): This is a little cheesy but also really fun and I can't deny how it makes me want to dance.

**therokinrolla** (6.5): no henny, it just hurts

**10footnotes** (6): This Kiss Pt. 2, I guess.

**dropthehammer11** (6): This sounds very weeaboo-y. Not bad tho

**MrSwearword** (6): every day is a day I wish I could never hear this again.

**Qwilphish** (6): Not actually bad, but it is such a filler that was written in 5 minutes

**blue\_heart\_** (5.5): This whole album sounds so 2012. And the same. The electronic drops or whatever they're called are in every song

**cyborglilith** (4): But everything changed when the chorus attacked.

**Elitefourbrad** (4): This didn’t hurt me in a good way. The production and this song are completely mismatched. Easily one of the worst songs on the album.

**jess\_22** (4): the bridge is SO good, but that's about it.

**Leixander** (4): Forgettable and/or bland.

**mokitsu** (3): filler

**VeganSquash** (2.5): meh

---
Yeah yeah there's Ginger Satan and all that, but this song is decent. It's pretty standard as far as guitar ballad-y stuff goes, but they both sound comfortable and in their element. The music video is cute, I guess, even though I usually get bored by the halfway point and tab out.

---
**refrayn** (11): fight me?? but for real, i love this song, their combined vocals and songwriting is gorgeous

**RandomPotatos** (0): Two bland artists combine to make one bland song

**VodkaInsipido** (0): SATAN. It’s super bland. And Ed adds literally NOTHING to the song.

---

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): I was going to give this an 11 because this is honestly the perfect song. It has my two favourite artists of all time, singing a nice emotional ballad, with honestly one of the best and cutest videos of all time. HOWEVER, All Too Well is also an 11 and since GInGer sATaN is in this song it'll get dragged for the meme so since I'm between the two songs I might as well give it to the one that won't be unrightfully bashed because people don't like an unrelated song the feature made 5 years later that caused their PoP GirLS To NoT GEt NUmbEr ONe!!

**agentofscranton** (10): i know this'll be done dirty because it features the sub's very own public enemy number one, but this is such a great duet and the video is so fucking adorable

**dropthehammer11** (3): Katy Perry could be eating mayonnaise straight from the jar and it wouldn't be as white as this song. Okay now to listen to the song...yup it's trash

**TragicKingdom1** (3): Can someone explain how this album is a popheads favorite but Ed's stuff isn't? This song is proof they're basically the same sound. I'm not a fan of either but at least be consistent.

**10footnotes** (8): People are probably gonna crap on this because of Ed Sheeran, but it’s not even a bad song. It’s cute, and I think his feature adds some variety to the album without being obtrusive.

**blue\_heart\_** (8): Despite having Ed Sheeran, this is a very sweet love song. It reminds me of my childhood when I had this song downloaded on my small playlist and it would come up all the time. This nostalgia makes me add some points, because it's beautiful to feel those memories come back.

**wailordfan** (8): I don't love the song. I think the context around it is adorable, including the music video. Especially the fact that they wrote this together while sitting on a trampoline. ADORABLE.

**superr\_rad** (8): the red devil and the white devil collab, and it is perfect. this is everything a ts and shrnnern song should be, and both of the artists are on their A-game for this acoustic bop.

**johnazoidberg-** (7): Taylor wants to know me better. Well TayTay, I'm the type of guy who's veeb playing Splatoon 2 for the last 3 songs because your album is boring. That being said, this duet ain't bad. If she'd been selective with this track list, this song probably would have still made it in. It's TayTay and her best friend - Ed Sheeran before we were all tired of him - doing what they do best. TayTay, give me more of this and less of the coffee shop hell.

**Nfranklin50** (10): This is the ultimate love at first sight song. This is the song for everyone that saw a random face and fell in love and man is it amazing. It's actually my most played song ever so what does that say about me

**therokinrolla** (10): i was truly shocked when i first came into this song. I expected ginger satan to ruin eveyrthing, but i barely notice him there, behind the beautiful writing, instrumentals, and taylor’s voice. Besides that, its a near perfect ballad.

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Eh, this isn't bad, but it's boring. It has Ed in it, so the sub will hate it. Best to put it out of its misery. I know I'm adding to the anti-Ed jerk and all, but I actually think that the similarities between Taylor and Ed don't make them a perfect match because Ed really just isn't as good at painting pictures with his songwriting and singing as Taylor is. A lot of his lyrics seem too direct and too simple and too dull for me. I much prefer Taylor as a singer-songwriter.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): “This Ed Sheeran guy is amazing. I’m so glad he’s a true indie musician, sucks when people make tropical pop songs when they get some radio play. I know it won’t happen to this artist.”

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): TAYLOR MADE THAT BITCH FAMOUS “HYANNIS PORT”

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): To my future gay boyfriend, wherever you are, I don't care if you stan Taylor or not, we are making out with this song playing. :gaycat:

**ImADudeDuh** (10): inb4 popheads trashes this day 1 because "RED SATAN IS HERE?!?!!?!"

**jess\_22** (10): i guess the only thing that's changed now is Taylor

**MrSwearword** (10): considering dreck of this album, an Ed Sheeran collab feels like a breath of fresh air.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This. Is. Everything.

**Piccprincess** (10): SWEERAN 4 LYFE

**poppinmmolly** (10): SO ADORABLE. And I love Ed Sheeran BITE ME BITCHES.

**rickikardashian** (10): i stan almost anything ed sheeran did pre-divide ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

**skargardin** (10): A classic Tay track. Their voices work wonders on this track.


**TouchItAG** (10): The one time Ed Sheeran is tolerable.

**twat\_brained** (10): Honestly… pre-1989 Taylor Swift alongside Ed in his prime made for a fantastic combination! I love this!

**cyborglilith** (9): wow this doesn't sound like ed sheeran at all

**lady\_sable** (9): Ed Sheeran is very hit or miss for me tbh, but I like him here. This song is really nostalgic for me tbh; 2012 was a simpler time.

**Leixander** (9): This is really cute and awesome! Their sounds go along really well.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): honestly listening to this again it's not even a good song i only like the nostalgia

**VeganSquash** (9): chorus isn't as spectacular as I would like

**eklxtreme** (8.5): sweet melody and instrumentation. Gives me early Ed vibes which are amazing

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Their voices go really good together I'm surprised they haven't done more songs together.

**dirdbub** (8): they sound so good together!! they should do more stuff together

**OberionSynth** (8): my friend did this for an open mic night about 6 years ago so I kinda cringe everytime I hear this but I still love it

**Qwilphish** (8): This song works surprisingly, Ed and Taylor's voices were built for each other. A true duet that is really sweet.

**skyblade79** (8): probably second best song on the album.Sheeran works really well and kind of outshines.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Ed saved it.

**mdawgig** (7.5): Like musical unflavored ice cream: sweet, but aggressively boring. Better than The Last Time, though?

**zamomattel** (7.5): FUCK GINGER SATAN HES TRASH - but actually not because this is actually pretty cute ughhhh

**OwenKam50** (7): downsheerans

**supersecrettest** (7): This is the kind of stuff Ed should make, not Shape of You.

**CharmingArsenal** (6.5): Another Melancholic Country Pop Song (feat. Ed Sheeran)

**mokitsu** (6.5): very cute video

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): nothing special, but at least it wasn't as meh as most things Ed is on

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): [insert devil and snake together joke here]

**skiddos** (6): This is cute. I love the music video.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (5): DEAD average. Ed Sheeran does nothing for this song, it's just okay.

**Johnnytoby** (4): ironic and boring

**awryj** (3): Forgettable

**gannade** (2.5): Give me another charlie x meghan collab than this please

**BionicFunhouse** (2): It's that one song, but worse this time.

**Elitefourbrad** (1): Ginger Satan ruins this track.

**enecks** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8zARgvozTk

**lexarqade** (1): I literally fell asleep listening to this song. Why does Ed Sheeran continue to make music?

Childish Gambino's verse is pretty garbage (I don't get why he randomly spells out the letters to "gay") but I like the bouncy mellowness of this ballad. Apparently this samples something but I have no knowledge of music that existed before Lady Gaga - Just Dance so I'm gonna let some of the user comments explain that.

---
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): should've been a single. something something diana ross

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The hip hop beat here is amazing, and she’s great over it. I actually also really like the Childish Gambino verse here, and the Mo Money Mo Problems sample is fucking crazy unexpected and extremely glorious.

**MrSwearword** (8): the “I’m Coming Out” sample is kind of misplaced on an Ariana album but this is pretty good.

**skyblade79** (4): can’t dig the sample…

**TeamAwesome4** (4): Awkward rap verse, awkward sample.

**Nfranklin50** (4): Gambino kills this song but the sample is so akwardly thrown in

**Magic\_warlock0-** (9): I love the sample from Kelly Price! It flows so well with this song, and Donglover’s verses are solid.

**reddituser206** (4): why am i listening to this and not Mo Money Mo Problems or I'm Coming Out

**supersecrettest** (5): I hate the way they used the sample.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I was dancing this entire song, Ari slays, I LOVE the production and that Mo Money Mo Problems sample is amazing, and Gambino does this thing, why did these two never work together again is what I wanna know

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Another Ariana song that would be a 10 if not for a few elements that hold it back. Namely Childish Gambino, maybe it’s just that I don’t really like him in general but I think he’s pretty bad here. The lyrics of his verse are all over the place, this is a song with a story and he’s playing a very specific part in it and over half of his lyrics seem to miss that point. Honestly, shoulda brought back Iggy, she could have made this track an 11. His callbacks to Ariana during the last verse are great though. That “I’m Coming Out” sample is brilliant.

**jess\_22** (9): +2 for the Mo Money Mo Problems sample

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): Diana Ross is the best part of this song, but even that sample can't save this

**Qwilphish** (9.5): Fun and bouncy. Love the sampled "I'm comin'" and Gambino adds another .5

**skiddos** (7): I don’t like that Diana Ross sample. It ruins the dark sound of the song. The song still bangs though.

**zamomattel** (9): Ariana Grande, your sample of Diana Ross tonight was... supreme. You're safe.

---

**Piccprincess** (7): Calvin is breaking my heart

**CharmingArsenal** (10): Cliche sample? Check. Still a bop? Check. Featuring sexy Donald Glover? Check.

**mokitsu** (10): me before i out my ex

**Johnnytoby** (8): a slut drop (up until the chorus)

**mudkip1** (8): /u/letsallpoo

**nooodisaster** (5): Hearing Donald Glover talk-rap "Yes I'm a G from the A and they ask Y" made me go straight. Gambino's verse = 0 of the rate.

**VodkaInsipido** (8): *Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask Y* might be one of the best rap lines of the whole album.

=====

letsallpoo: 

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is an unappreciated bop.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (9): this is the gay anthem

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Queen of letting his boyfriend cheat on her with another boy. Truly an LGBT icon. Also, I want Donald Glover to fucc me tbh.

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): gambino is so good in this song, his verse is nice but doesn't eclipse ariana at all. it's just a feature, and a great one. quavo, take lessons please.

**skargardin** (9): A bop but what’s up with this disaster of a line: “The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch”

**twat\_brained** (9): The sample as well as Ari singing "my baby loves me", this really just feels like the child of "I'm Coming Out" and "Baby I". That being said, it's really quite good!

**eklxtreme** (8.5): super fun and catchy. it's like a mix of pop, hip-hop, and funk.

**musicotic** (8.5): Good except for Childish Gambino

**rickikardashian** (8.5): This sound like Baby I, but about a gay cheating boyfriend

**awryj** (8): As for now, this 8 is the lowest note I've given for this album and I'm already halfway through. I'm starting to think I like Ariana.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Oh hey it’s that guy from Redbone!

**enecks** (8): Uh G-rated Gambino from this era of his career is weird.

**henry413** (8): Fun fact: She actually thought the lyrics had happened to her and was cool about it.

**Leixander** (8): Gambino's verse is really awesome.

**OberionSynth** (8): i cry at night because i've never had the opportunity of ariana breaking my heart

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Gambino's verse is slightly underwhelming but I'm not about to trash-talk the most talented man on the planet. Good song overall.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I wanted to like this song more, but it's just too repetitive and Childesh Gambino verse is underwhelming and he's underused. Production is great though.

**blue\_heart\_** (7): As someone who compulsively snaps his fingers; don't do this in music. Please.

**johnazoidberg-** (7): This song feels like it's all building up to the rap verse, but DonGlover really phoned this one in. This song is the musical equivalent of blue balls

**OwenKam50** (7): Forgettable chorus, childish lyrics (hah get it)

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Is this an iconic gay anthem or a super problematic song? I can't tell. I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to bop to it or facepalm to it. IDK, Ariana is pretty pro-LGBT and I'd imagine this song to be an empowerment anthem instead of 'wow my boyfriend is gay and he's cheating on me what a dick lol'

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): Fonky but could use more

**10footnotes** (6): This is about the halfway point of the album, and IMO signals a drop in quality (with an exception or two) from this point on.

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**superr\_rad** (6): some of these lyrics got me like...girl bisexuality exists. i feel like this would be much better without the "my baby loves me" tbh. gambino is gold tho

**therokinrolla** (5): these hoes aint loyal

**mdawgig** (4): At least it's better than Best Mistake?

**cyborglilith** (2): this is actually really bad

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (1): ugh

**gannade** (1): terrible

**VeganSquash** (1): trash

I like the trepidation in her voice as she approaches the chorus, then the way she goes all in when she hits the second chorus. It's a great representation of what she's singing about, with her desire to fall in love outweighing the potential danger of it all. In the context of Taylor's songs, this is certainly one of them.

---
**animefangrant62** (11): “All we are is skin and bone trained to get along" cough PR relationships cough

**Nfranklin50** (11): This is my favorite song of all time. The way she just bends the words and the beat to make you feel the experience of that moment when you throw all caution to the wind and just let yourself fall in love even knowing how bad it's gonna hurt and then evolves in further into this beautiful crescendo of passion and love is just beautiful and so relateable

**treesoutsidemywindow** (11): My favorite Taylor song, gets overlooked a lot imo

---

**10footnotes** (10): Treacherous was the third contender for my 11. Red is an album full of Moments, and the instant when the second chorus explodes into “Two headlights shine through the sleepless night / And I will get you, get you alone” is my favorite Moment on this entire album and merits a 10 all on its own. Something about how the background vocals come in, the instrumental picks up, and Taylor’s voice becomes more powerful gets me every time I listen to this song. Of course, this song deserves a 10 for more than just one reason. The other thing I want to focus on is the way Taylor delivers the lyrics. There’s a believability behind every line: the way she trails off the ends of lines in the verses as if she’s talking, the way some words in the chorus are stretched out, the “I, I, I”’s, the quiet “like it” ending… Every single part of this song contributes to the hopeful feeling I get whenever I listen to it.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): “WON’T STOP TILL IT’S OVER” this song is so simple yet so good, there is something about it that it’s both charming and frightening and at the same time it makes you want to feel like she did. Taylor has a way with words and this song is the perfect example. Also, “Nothing safe is worth the drive” is a life lesson we all have to learn.

**superr\_rad** (10): def top 5 taylor songs for me, the buildup to that second hook is massive and is so good it carries the whole song. the lyrics are kinda awkward at some points but this is definitely some of her best work

**therokinrolla** (10): **Two headlights shine through the sleepless night And I will get you, and get you alone** is one of the best things ever

**Magic\_warlock0-** (9.5): This is absolutely a solid song, rhythm is soothing and the lyrics bring up feelings of dangerous love and taking risks! Can't believe I'm just hearing this

**lady\_sable** (10): My favorite thing about this song is the bridge, and the slow but steady build-up to it. It has some of Taylor's best songwriting, and she uses it perfectly as the climax of the song, the reason why I keep re-listening.

---
**strawberryswing1** (2): Did a fifth grader write this?

**skyblade79** (3): the slope of bad music is treacherous and she just keeps slipping down it for this album. x

**Piccprincess** (10): I'd put my lips close to Tay's, but I can't promise that they won't touch

**henry413** (7.5): For whatever reason Taylor using "treacherous" just reminds me of Mariah using "incessantly" in Heartbreaker lol.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): queen of lesbian undertones

[/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dneo594/]

=====

letsallpoo: 


**agentofscranton** (10): Taylor’s runner-up in terms of lyricism to All Too Well

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (10): I actually find the intro boring but the bridge is just so wonderful I wanted to give it a 12.

**blue\_heart\_** (10): Taylor has a way with words that provokes jealousy in me, an aspiring poet. There's a good reason this song is so beloved.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (10): although its lyrically weaker than all too well, it's better as a song overall. Absolutely LOVE the bridge

**mdawgig** (10): You can get me alone any time with songs like this, Tay. That buildup is amazing, and it hits like a truck in the final chorus.

**MissyBee37** (10): I love the guitar in this song, the lyrics, the way she sings "touch" in the first verse, but most of all, the bridge. An underappreciated Taylor track.

**piplup123** (10): top 5 taylor for sure

**skargardin** (10): A beautiful, somber track.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This love is treacherous, such a beautiful message. The guitar on this song is beautiful, along with Taylor’s almost mysterious vocals.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I love these lowkey songs from her, that go for a certain mood as opposed to bombast. I want a whole album of stuff like this.

**islimp** (8.5): One of the nicer songs on the album tbh.

**enecks** (8): As an example of pre-1989 Taylor Swift writing, this is pretty solid. Details, yet comfortable subject territory.

**musicotic** (8): Catchy

**OberionSynth** (8): this song makes me wanna try skiing for some reason

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is good, but it's a little too soft for my tastes. I wouldn't skip it or anything. I do think this is one of Taylor's first references to sex? Not sure.

**TeamAwesome4** (8): I, I, I, like it.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): I like how stripped down it is at some parts

**floofeh** (7.5): a bit plain at first but does lead up to a strong chorus.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): way too downtempo

**angusaditus** (7): Great lyrics, but overall slightly uninteresting to me

**zamomattel** (7): Very typical Taylor, not great but not bad either

**MrSwearword** (6): for a song claiming that love is so “treacherous”, this certainly sounds like it’s more milquetoast.

**jess\_22** (5.5): meh, this doesn't really really go anywhere

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**PuggleMaster** (5): I just listened to it and I forgot everything about the song

**Qwilphish** (5): One of Red's many forgettable country tunes. There is literally nothing here for me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): “Okay, gotta put a song in hear that has no synths just to show everyone that I’m not totally going pop yet!”

**twat\_brained** (5): No wonder this album didn't win AOTY at the Grammys with filler like this.

**VeganSquash** (5): I do like the lyrics, it didn't pick up until the bridge...a bit boring

**dropthehammer11** (4.5): Okay this is starting to drag a lot

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): I'm not going to remember what this sounds like by the time the rate reveal comes around.

**Johnnytoby** (4): forgettable

**mokitsu** (4): boring and forgettable

**johnazoidberg-** (3): This is the third boring, forgettable song in a row. It's like she tried to transition from playing country to playing coffee shops. I almost fell asleep

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3): I was very bored by this

**cyborglilith** (2): BORING

**refrayn** (1): this is so clunky and forgettable sorry

This honest to God sounds like a Rachel Platten song, and not in the good way. *Red* is full of anthemic songs, but "Starlight" is the most generic one, being just about going out at night and partying with your friends and some shit like that. As bad as you might think songs like "22" and WANEGBT are, at least they convey cathartic partying through a different medium than "lol let's just go have fun guys!!!!"

---

**10footnotes** (7.5): This and Stay Stay Stay are the happiest, most upbeat songs on Red (though I slightly prefer Starlight because of its production – that piano though). Some people might hate how sugary sweet these songs are, but I like how they bring variety to the album and contrast tracks like All Too Well and Sad Beautiful Tragic.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): ok so I have a weird relationship with this song because it was one of my favourites on Red for the longest time but for some reason my work plays it every morning on our "radio" thing so when you hear the song 5 days a week at 7 am you get tired of it really quickly so I kind of cringe when I hear it, it's like when you use a song for your alarm and then you cringe when you hear it after a while. However, objectively speaking the song is incredible and I won't let a personal bias affect my score so I'll give it the 10 it deserves

**therokinrolla** (10): goddamn just, the hook here is something else. When it cascades in like a fucking planet into your ears, it takes over, and its a joyous moment from an album of relative sadness. Its a peak. Pure starlight

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): “I need a song here that’s really pop but it still has some guitar because I really want to make pop songs but want to get those iTunes Country section sales.”

**superr\_rad** (1): i tried to like this, and at some points i enjoy, but this song sounds soooo cheap. i feel like it was produced in 20 minutes and the hook is really grating. come back, be here should swap with this, it deserves nothing more than a bonus track

**johnazoidberg-** (8): This sounds like she was listening to that 3OH!3 song with the vegetarian line on repeat and said "Ok what if I made that, but with music?" This album has been full of filler, but this song is a Grade A Premium Angus jam!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Cute, really nice! I love the title of this one and it's pretty adorable all in all. I can actually imagine Pure Heroine-era Lorde writing a slightly different version of this song considering the imagery she uses.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is a cute bop. Not every love song that Taylor writes is directly about her relationships as this song is about Ethel and Bobby Kennedy. She takes her inspiration somewhere else people!

**VeganSquash** (10): I LOVED the chorus

**lady\_sable** (9.5): Honestly adorable tbh. It makes me feel happy when I listen to it.

**poppinmmolly** (9.5): This is about Bobby and Ethel Kennedy and it's adorable!

**eklxtreme** (9): I got speak now vibes from this, and I liked how catchy it was

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): THE song to dance to.

**McBawse** (9): Amazing and underrated.

**mdawgig** (9): What a marvelous tune, indeed! A little out of place on the album production-wise, but a real earworm.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): We love a country bop!

**OberionSynth** (9): I lowkey fall in love with any song that says somebody is dressed "to the nines" idk why

**twat\_brained** (9): Dream impossible things? Like coming up with a rate-winning song? Don't we all at some point in our lives?

**wailordfan** (9): This is my sister's favorite song on the album, and we love a misheard lyric here, in the bridge: "Have ten kids and teach 'em, how to drink" instead of "teach 'em how to dream".

**zamomattel** (9): Actually the best chorus on this album, and if y'all sleep on this I'm coming for you

**reddituser206** (8.5): if Kiss and Red had a baby

**skargardin** (8.5): I want in on this night tbh.

**BionicFunhouse** (8): Wait this one is actually good, sans the ten kids part. Who the fuck wants ten kids?

**CharmingArsenal** (8): It's cute.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): This reminds me of Starfire from Teen Titans a little bit, but I love this song’s guitars.

**enecks** (8): ok ok ok


**Magic\_warlock0-** (8): An awesome little song! Dancing under the night sky, and dreaming about the future, TSwift puts her good vocals to use here!

**rickikardashian** (8): Marvelous is such a pretentious word

**supersecrettest** (8): This is a nostalgic song. I think Taylor does a good job of characterizing that sort of nostalgia for a relationship.

**TeamAwesome4** (8): This chorus uses the verses from 3OH!3's "Don't Trust Me". Seriously, you can't unhear it.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7.5): song is special to me, heard it and thought hey taylor swift actually has decent music besides love story and YBWM

**Cryomatic** (7.5): one of the best love songs about robert f. kennedy this decade

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the the 'old school' theme of the song, it's cute and such a thing Taylor would do but it's just kind to bleh otherwise.

**Johnnytoby** (7): neon lights is shook

**awryj** (6): Oh my, what a somewhat mediocre but overall nice tune

**henry413** (6): I always feel this song was shoved into the album at last second, the production sounds incomplete.

**jess\_22** (6): this is the opposite of a marvelous tune

**skyblade79** (6): pretty cute

**dropthehammer11** (5.5): FINALLY SOME ENERGY

**Leixander** (5): This screams filler sadly. Forgettable.

**Qwilphish** (5): Taylor's use of tune unironically hurts me "tooooon"

**TragicKingdom1** (5): There's a spacey synth in the background of this that confuses me.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (4): I forget about this song.

**dirdbub** (4): why am I being forced to listen to “Jon And Kate Plus 8”-core songs

**mokitsu** (4): cuntry queen realness

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): ok everyone hear me out the melodies in this sound are similar to donttrustme my 3oh!3

**Kaylaboe** (3): kinda cheesy 🧀

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3): ugh how isn't this album over yet

**MrSwearword** (1): THE BEAT IS A LITERAL RETREAD OF THE TITLE TRACK I HATE THIS ALBUM SO GODDAMN MUCH.

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/cjgqQVui)

**BreezySeason** (11): Queen of New York, LA, Paris and London

---
I fucking hated this song when I first listened to *Kiss*, but it's grown on me a ton over the years. It's simple and featherlight, and while it doesn't leave much of an impact on the listener, there's a definite cutsey charm to it that serves as a great introduction to the album. In case you're confused the titular bows are referring to Cupid's bow and arrow. While it's plural, I have no idea.

---

**supersecrettest** (11): This song’s chorus is so good, and I love the synths in the background. Honestly her best songs on Kiss.

**Damoojo** (0): Hate it.

----

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (10): Ugh! Why couldn't this entire album be so good - like Taylor, she just made such an interesting opening track it's bound to be hard to live up to. But everything from the sample to the hook is perfect for her. It feels like a girl who just arrived to New York and she's excited and the limitless possibilities.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): When I first listened to this album, I was immediately hooked by how much of a bop and nostaglic the song is. The 'Cupid' sample definitely added the kick the song needs.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): High-key my favorite song on the album. She doesn’t quite have the voice to pull something like this off (it’s especially noticeable when she sings that “Cupid, draw back your bow!” part, which I *love*) but her charm is infectious and I love this silly fluff of a song. [There are some alternate lyrics from an earlier version of the song up on Genius that I like a bit better](https://genius.com/Carly-rae-jepsen-tiny-little-bows-demo-lyrics) but they’re clearly for a much different kind of song than this ended up being.

**whatyourheartdesires** (4): I always read it as tiny little [brows](http://i0.wp.com/blog.amaliebeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/90s-brows.jpg)

**Elitefourbrad** (8): That violin made this whole song for me. I want a tiny little bowtie now! An amazing album opener that’s so incredibly catchy and it’ll be in your head all day and all night. Carly has been hit with the love bug, as she’s talking about Cupid hitting you with his bow. I really love the instrumental to this song with all the great melodies, and the chorus is repetitive, but it gets the point across and I love it.

**dirdbub** (8.5): I feel like I’m being unwillingly thrown into an anime opening about little Sasuke-ass Christian school girls who find out their gym teacher is a ghoul from fucken hell sent by Satan himself so they have to fight their gym teacher but keep getting set back by fucken talking pets owned by the other teachers with a sub plot about the unwanted romantic interest of another Christian school boy who keeps on trying to get a date with one of the girls and she keeps denying because she has to deal with hte fucking ghoul gym teacher from hell and all the stupid setbacks that come with it and the trope with him is that every time he finds her again it’s seconds after the duel so he knows nothing about the fucking bullshit enigma mystery the girls have to deal with and thinks that she is just a lesbian and won’t admit it due to literally every single girl being wiped out from each battle they endure and by the end of the series he realizes that he’s gay so when the girl finally decides to give in and go on a date with him he denies and says “oh no I realized that I’m gay :)” and then she just walks away in mortal shock that she dealt with all THIS SHIT in just under a week

---

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (10): how do you think it goes with those tiny little bnes? screaming really fast... screaming really slow

**ExtraEater** (7): commas ruined this sogn for me tbh





[/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dneovwe/]

=====

letsallpoo: 

**mdawgig** (10): An underappreciated classic bop.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Ok Miss Carly! A bop!

**wailordfan** (10): A bop, and a perfect intro to an album that really doesn't deserve this song.

**CharmingArsenal** (9): Funny how so many of Carly's songs are created as slow, sad acoustic tracks and get produced into bops. Check out the demo.

**eklxtreme** (9): this is incredibly catchy and infectious, and I especially love what's going on with the subtle strings

**henry413** (9): Queen of name-dropping cities. Fergie who?

**lady\_sable** (9): Really cute and catchy

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): what a great opening for the album! showing how sugar-y and fun and repetitive-at-time Kiss is gonna be.

**refrayn** (9): BOP

**rickikardashian** (9): Is it dumb? Yes. Will it be out early? probably. Do I still love it? Yes

**TeamAwesome4** (9): Adorable

**therokinrolla** (9): a little fillery, but, it bops and the production is really cute

**twat\_brained** (9): A fantastic rate opening song! I'm immediately drawn in😄

**bluehxrizon** (8.5): this used to completely snatch my 12 year old weave but its not as amazing as i remember

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): A cute opener! I'm not sure if it's what Carly was aiming for, but I love the double connotation of the title-bows as in Cupid's arrows, and bows as in violin strings. Really romantic.

**skargardin** (8.5): Way too underrated.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (8): huge cheesy opener can't stand the bridge tho

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It's good song but Carly's voice sounds like it's too processed in the chorus and some of the verses.

**johnazoidberg-** (8): That bass line is funkier than my finger after it was in a splint for 4 days straight.

**musicotic** (8): It's catchy, but just sounds dated? The way she says bows irks me too, I was expecting bows as in bowing to someone, and instead I got the little bow you tie up on your hair

**raicicle** (8): tiny little bans outstreamed

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): The beginning of this song felt like white people gentrifying k-pop but by the end I was bopping

**VodkaInsipido** (8): omg this is actually good and cute

**agentofscranton** (7.5): this song sounds tailor made for a Barbie commercial

**dropthehammer11** (7): Okay my head is bopping along, nothing crazy special but it's nice

**floofeh** (7): I love the cute bass in this one.

**Leixander** (7): A good opening to an album that has too many fillers.

**reddituser206** (7): I'd rather listen to Marina's "Blue", but this will do in a pinch

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): perfect pop production but it needs to be a little more unique it sounds awesome but it just feels like it's missing something that carly songs have

**10footnotes** (6.5): It's a cute opener that reflects the style of the album, but then again pretty much every other song on Kiss could have fit this description.

**awryj** (6.5): A bit too busy, but adorable.

**triptoyourheart** (6.5): Kinda cute, weird middle eight, who is that singing it?

**zamomattel** (6.5): So EMOTION starts with Run Away With Me & Kiss starts with this forgettable non-bop kadhbdsfbvjh

**chili\_jones** (6): ...missing something

**enecks** (6): This production is OK, but it swamps Carly Rae. This isn't going to be polished is it?

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6): The beat and background is the best part of this song. Pretty upbeat, but the shit lyrics are ruining my ability to full appreciate it

**OberionSynth** (6): kinda catchy but it feels kind of immature for my tastes

**Piccprincess** (6): I hope the rope Calvin uses to tie me up is in tiny little bows

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Sugar Rating: Giant Rainbow Lollipop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): eh, not the most promising of starts.

**gannade** (5): Taylor and Ari had such good intros and then Carly has... this. At least she redeemed herself with Emotion's iconic opener

**VeganSquash** (5): too mushy-gushy

**MrSwearword** (4.5): shit lyrics, bad singing, bad beatwork…standard Carly fare, teebs

**blue\_heart\_** (4): repent https://youtu.be/1sSBzqz8MSw

**jess\_22** (4): well this is a real earworm

**Qwilphish** (4): Verses are better than the chorus, but still not saying much. The chorus is repeated way too much and is so unmoving that it becomes tedious to listen to.

**skyblade79** (4): this is so lame lmfao

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): not good

**MissyBee37** (2): What is this song even about?? I don't have a clue. I want to like this 'cause it feels dance-y but it kind of just annoys me. Sorry Carly stans!

**cyborglilith** (1): That chorus is really underwhelming, and yes, I am a whiny little hoe.

**mokitsu** (1): this demo mess of a song

Ariana posted on her Facebook months before the album release this:

>I think I want to name the album after 1 of the songs I finished this weekend. It makes me cry! it's very special & honest.

Thankfully she did. What a cute title and even cuter title track. It's not necessarily lovey-dovey - it functions perfectly well as just an ode to whoever's in your life that you think is special. Ariana has dedicated the song to her late grandfather. Go watch that video if you feel like crying.

---
**islimp** (11): A B S O L U T E F A V E

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Absolutely beautiful. I always lie down in my bed and sing along to this, it’s a lovely song with a lovely message. “I’ve cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them” is a god tier opening line. Also, this is the only song on the standard album that Ariana has the lead writing credit on and it’s gorgeous? You go girl! Also I looked it up and the girl who played Little Inez in the Hairspray movie was a co-writer, which is random. One of Ariana’s finest vocal performances, she basically shoved her heart into the microphone and had them layer on tasteful production. It’s… difficult to sum up my feelings on this track beyond “wow this is just so so beautiful” so I’m gonna leave it at that.

**strawberryswing1** (10): The live performance of this at One Love Manchester made me love this song 100x more. Go watch it on Youtube, I can’t watch it without tearing up.

**superr\_rad** (10): i love this song, esp after the one love manchester performance. ari is one of the only pop girls that can carry more than one piano ballad on their albums because her voice is so pleasant to listen to

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): okay but the One Love Manchester version exceeds an 11

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I remember the One Love Manchester concert and school children was singing this with Ari and I fucking cried.

**twat\_brained** (9): *sniff* STOP REMINDING ME I'LL DIE ALONE, ARIANA! THANKS FOR THE WONDERFUL PREQUEL TO MOONLIGHT, THOUGH.


---

**Piccprincess** (10): Taylor Swift is my everything

**Qwilphish** (10): Ariana harmonizing with Ariana has 4.3H on suicide watch. The best full ballad on the album.

**mudkip1** (9): /u/letsallpoo


[/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dnep7p4/]

=====

letsallpoo: 



**angusaditus** (10): the damn delivery :sad:

**Elitefourbrad** (10): This song means everything to me, I can relate to it so much. It’s helped me through a lot of hard times, I’m crying as I type this.

**Johnnytoby** (10): my everything

**MissyBee37** (10): I wish I could give a second 11. This song is just an absolutely gorgeous ballad. The kind that should be up there with the classics. Beautiful.

**mokitsu** (10): the better ballad of the album, has me on my feelings all the time!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Omg. This song is way too short. And it gets me emotional every single time.

**poppinmmolly** (10): a beautiful song. Drove me to tears when I watched the Manchester performance.

**rickikardashian** (10): I’M A SUCKER FOR BALLADS IM SORRY

**VeganSquash** (10): amazing, iconic, beautiful, heartwarming

**luigi\_is\_better** (9.5): the way that ariana delivers "i'm saying sorry for the sake of us "... so good.

**cyborglilith** (9): simple and elegant

**musicotic** (9): Beautiful song, worthy of being a title Track

**zamomattel** (9): Harry's impact

**CharmingArsenal** (8.5): It's a bit jarring to go from Hands on Me to My Everything. But I feel it's a cute way to close the album, purposely similar to the intro.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Gorgeous!

**blue\_heart\_** (8): This song is sweet but she doesn't enunciate everything.

**OberionSynth** (8): queen of naming her albums after songs that are actually good

**skargardin** (8): A sollid ballad, much better than the other ones on the album.

**awryj** (7.5): It's a pretty song

**eklxtreme** (7): nice vocal melody. I found myself liking this more after the one love manchester concert.

**enecks** (7): At this stage, Ariana Grande didn't quite have enough control to pull of a ballad like this. She was close though.

**MrSwearword** (7): my guess is that it’s performed better live because on the album, it’s boring but competent.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is a decent ballad but I can't remember much about it aside from the chorus. This is worrying for a title track.

**supersecrettest** (7): Really shows off her voice, but there might be too many levels of her voice at once.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A short but cute ballad, nice little title track.

**triptoyourheart** (7): Cute lil' album closer, I like how we hear the a Capella from the Intro here too.

**jess\_22** (6): LOVE the lyrics, queen of ballads

**10footnotes** (5): Like Just A Little Bit of Your Heart, this song is pretty (and a cute closer for the standard edition), but nothing special.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): kinda like background music :/

**Magic\_warlock0-** (5): A shame that the titular song is pretty meh. I like the piano, but it’s not a song that really catches attention or seems romantic.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): NO

**dropthehammer11** (4): ARIANA NO MORE BALLADS

**skyblade79** (4): kinda boring tbh

**dirdbub** (3): I am literally never in the mood for this song

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (2): this is an album for bangers not ballads!!!

**mdawgig** (2): "You are" soooooooooo booooooooring.

**therokinrolla** (2): this song is literally nothing. super-filler

It's basically three women screaming at each other for over three minutes but I'm not bothered in the slightest. Friendly reminder that Jessie J's lead single is out! Go listen to it! It's pretty decent!

---
**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): is bop

**VeganSquash** (11): I did a lip-sync to this song in high school, and while that was the most embarrassing thing I ever did, I do know all the lyrics by heart. This song is an iconic sex bop; the fact it didn't get #1 shows how sexism is still relevant. Fucking Blurred Lines, the trashiest shit-show song ever, got #1, and this didn't? Smh.

**fifthchevron** (0): I really hate this, it's so vacant and nasty. You can tell it was cooked up by industry bigwigs trying to figure out what Women Want To Hear. Nicki is the only one bringing any personality to this.

**piplup123** (0): jessie j is so annoying

---

**rickikardashian** (10): The Lady Marmalade of this decade

**henry413** (10): The modern Lady Marmalade? Probably not but its live always sounds awesome.

---
**Qwilphish** (9): This song is a mess but it at least works. The three of them allow for the song to stay at an 11 the entire song without it sounding stale. Jessie J and Nicki absolutely go OFF on this song but unfortunately I feel that Ariana is the weakest of the three here. "You need a bad girl to blow your mind" is an iconic lyric.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Umm...Yes? This is a kickass girl power anthem. Emphasis on power. Jessie J is clearly the worst part of this but Ariana and Nicki more than make up for this.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Jessie J's last successful attempt at relevancy (that terrible song from Pitch Perfect 2 does not exist), one Nicki's best collaborations in an already fantastic era, and one of Ariana's greatest performance. This was the song of the summer a few years ago.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Lmao poor Jessie J. She ended up being overshadowed by Ari and Nicki and she flopped hard. It seems like Nicki is following Jessie's path tho. :janet:

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Definitely an earworm of a song, but all I think about this song these days is that it's the female version of blurred lines. Both catchy songs that are kind of problematic. Everyone does sound great though.

**musicotic** (10): Basically pop perfection. Ariana invented Jessie J

**MrSwearword** (1): easily among the worst songs of the last 37 years. Jessie can’t sing, Nicki can’t rap and Ariana half-asses this. Shame on all three for this.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I’m weirdly lukewarm on this track, which is odd because I like all of the women involved in it. But it just sounds so sterile and generic to me. The Jessie J effect I suppose. Jessie’s vocals are, as always, flawless, and this was back when a Nicki feature was special rather than inevitable, so she sounds quite good too. In fact, Ariana is probably the most disposable part of this track, to the point where I didn’t even realize that it wasn’t just Jessie singing the first few times I heard it. Regardless of my personal feelings towards it there need to be more collaborations between female artists like this, even if it’s not my favorite I can’t deny that these three women combined are a force of nature on this track.

**mudkip1** (6): /u/letsallpoo

**PuggleMaster** (10): imagine if this was demi instead of Jessie J my wig would be in orbit

**skiddos** (1): This song is just a loud, shouty, incoherent mess. Yes, I know, rich coming from a Demi stan, but still.

letsallpoo: 

**dropthehammer11** (10): This shit is so charismatic and catchy and dope.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Bop bop, into the room.

**johnazoidberg-** (10): My pants were feeling loose until Jessie and Ari gave me those belts. This song is fucking incredible. This should be every song

**Johnnytoby** (10): ah when women were alive in the charts

**lady\_sable** (10): Nicki absolutely blows everyone else out of the water here

**lexarqade** (10): This song gets the blood flowing and the pussy popping every single time.

**lulbady** (10): Queen Nicki dominant prominent

**MissyBee37** (10): I can't listen to this without dancing. This song is fire.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): whew ari’s best song hands down no competition

**nooodisaster** (10): THIS SONG SAVED POP MUSIC

**OwenKam50** (10): Where I learn nicki’s rap verse in half a day

**skargardin** (10): We need more high profile collabs like this one.

**ExtraEater** (9): a crowded song, and i mean that in the best way possible

**floofeh** (9): don't think about this song too hard, just sing along to it and try not to trip up in the Nicki verse.

**mdawgig** (9): The standard-bearer for try-hard bops. Good, but feels focus grouped to death.

**skyblade79** (9): actually an iconic song, surprised people don’t like it

**therokinrolla** (9): WIG!!!!!!! Bang bang on me girls!!!!

**triptoyourheart** (9): Jessie and Nicki steal the show here so I have to take a point off because Ari is the least exciting part about this song.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): A hard banger. Jessie does… her part well, Ariana does a good verse and Nicki makes a great verse for once.

**10footnotes** (8.5): At first I was confused why this was only a deluxe track, but I realized that it’s technically a Jessie J song so it does make sense.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): such a fun song. essentially a posse cut for pop music which doesn't happen often.

**Piccprincess** (8.5): I'd Bang Bang both Taylor and Calvin at the same time

**reddituser206** (8.5): hottest of hot messes

**zamomattel** (8.5): I remeber when this came out, I though Ari was the smallest star of the 3, how things have changed

**CharmingArsenal** (8): It's a bop, not much else to say about it.

**OberionSynth** (8): queen of singing 15% of a song and stealing it for her album

**raicicle** (8): Jessie J truly oversings on this, as is standard with most things she does. Definitely not a bad song by any means, but a little bit messy.

**SimplyHaunted** (8): I don't understand why she has so many features on this album. She has a beautiful and powerful voice. But in this case Nicki blows Jessie and Ari out of the water.

**strawberryswing1** (8): Fun little song but it sounds a little dated and it got really old, really fast for me

**TeamAwesome4** (8): [The only way I can describe this.](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hot-mess)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Listen, I'm not saying I stand for the objectification of men (or women obviously), but if we're gonna be objectified, it might as well come from Ariana Grande. Also Nicki snapped!

**luigi\_is\_better** (7.5): [insert comment about lady marmalade here]

**mokitsu** (7.5): killed by overplay, rightfully left in 2015, doesn't deserve to be in this album

**cyborglilith** (7): this definitely shouldn't have been after My Everything, and Nicki's verse makes me slut drop instantly

**dirdbub** (7): this isn’t as good as people say it is

**Elitefourbrad** (7): Lady Marmalade is shook! The vocals are slayed by Ariana and Jessie, Nicki is just sort of there, she’s meh in this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Really annoying song when it was on the radio but I don’t hate it now. Nicki is great on here and everyone actually does a good job.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): I can't hear this song without thinking of that freshman ho meme :deadbanana:

**twat\_brained** (6.5): Eh, never really loved nor hated this. But if you never tried to flawlessly recite Nicki's verse were you really a teenager in 2014? I hope this is out on day 2 at least, though. Also, remember Nicki's wardrobe malfunction when they performed this live? I miss when the VMAs still SOMEWHAT credible, at least.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (6): Jessie J has an incredibly grating voice but Nicki and Ariana save it.

**enecks** (6): Jessie J is lame tbh.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6): Noisy and annoying. Points come from Jessie J not making a sucktastic song and Nicki rapping. Ari is a weak element of this song, Girl, you gonna teach ME how to graduate?

**TragicKingdom1** (6): Usually I deride songs for not having enough power but this a rare example of too much power. I feel like this song is falcon punching my ears.

**blue\_heart\_** (5.5): all the points I give I give because of Nicki. only like her verse. I call it Swish Stockholm Syndrome.

**superr\_rad** (5): vroom vroom

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4.5): this hasn’t aged well

**agentofscranton** (4): thanks to being overplayed, i got sick of this song fast

**awryj** (4): I just don't like it, and I don't really know why

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (2): this is trash

**jess\_22** (1): the only good part is Nicki's verse, the rest is a steaming pile of trash

An immediate standout from *Red*, "Holy Ground" is a fast-paced acoustic song that embodies the rush that comes with infaturation. The way the song slows down leading into the chorus is such a great moment, as you can hear Taylor gingerly approaching the titular holy ground before diving back into the rush again. Also I'm going to leave this quote from the Taylor wiki that's serving middle school drama realness:

> It is rumored to be about Joe Jonas, because, interpreting, the song talks about a relationship that hurt her a lot, but looking back, it was good; and it happened with Joe, because they got communication back.

---
**TouchItAG** (11): Holy FUCK this song is good.

---

**Nfranklin50** (10): This song bops hard. She just goes in from the minute it starts and it's one of the most fun songs to sing a long with and iit just puts a smile on your face especially when you're dancing off the past

**johnazoidberg-** (3): There's a saying that nothing will make you an atheist faster than reading the bible. We're 11 songs into this album and I'm starting to think that nothing will make be stop believing in TayTay faster than listening to this TayTay album

**superr\_rad** (10): aw fuck yeah, a fuckin bop all the way through. when the ooh aah's kick in, my pussy is popped in full force like so

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): “Okay, I want to make a song that’s almost like Heartbeats by The Knife but I still want it to be country enough to fit this album.”

**therokinrolla** (10): invented religion???? Besides that this is my favorite bop of the album, and those verses are just so well written

**10footnotes** (9.5): Thankfully, the tempo changes keep this song from being exhaustingly fast and make it interesting instead. The lyrics also paint a very vivid picture.

**blue\_heart\_** (9.5): Like the other song in the rate with a religious allusion in the title, this song is beautiful. However, this one is more energetic, more excited, while its subject matter is more sad. State of Grace beats it out- but only slightly.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I remember liking the lyrics of the one, and I remember it being pleasant to listen to, but, IDK, it seems more like a vague memory. Not as memorable as some of the other songs on this album, but I feel like giving it a score lower than 8 would be kind of unfair for some reason.

**supersecrettest** (9): I really like the steady pace and good drum beats of this song. The timing of the vocals in the verses also really makes the song stand out for me.

---

**Piccprincess** (10): I blocked the noise with the sound of "I need Tay"

**MrSwearword** (1): I got sick of this like four tracks ago or something. TRY A NEW BEAT OR AT LEAST MAKE SOMETHING INTERESTING.

**enecks** (9): To quote Shakespeare "nice"

**SpanKKy1** (9): anything Shawn touches

=====

letsallpoo: 

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): A SONG ABOUT LOOKING BACK AND THINKING “DAMN THAT WAS GOOD” ALSO “WHEN YOU CAME TO THE SHOW IN SD”

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this wasn't a single and that's why she's a homophobe

**lady\_sable** (10): Forever bitter that this wasn't a single.

**Leixander** (10): Taylor's GOAT. Perfect from start to end.

**mdawgig** (10): Darlin', it was GREAT. Never fails to get me dancing in my seat/on the train/in my office/wherever.

**MissyBee37** (10): The rhythm, speed and energy of this song are phenomenal. The hook is fabulous. The lyrics of the second verse are my favorite.


**poppinmmolly** (10): IT'S. A. TEN. FOLKS. Idk why this song is so fantastic, but it is.

**rickikardashian** (10): I don’t know how to drive, but this is my driving song

**musicotic** (9): I like it except for the bridge tbh

**refrayn** (9): state of grace did it better, but still great

**skiddos** (9): One of my all time favorite Taylor songs! The bridge is wonderful.

**Johnnytoby** (8.5): reminds me of malibu

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Hey I’d say yes to Taylor dancing with me, we can both Shake It Off!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): A really unexpected surprise. I love a good upbeat Taylor song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This is a nice little bop.

**OberionSynth** (8): I don't ever listen to songs like this but I love this one for whatever reason. prolly cause I'd go gay for tay tay.

**VodkaInsipido** (8): Finally a non-single song that isn't filler.

**mokitsu** (7): one of the best non-singles here, she did that

**VeganSquash** (7): chorus was a bit of a letdown but I did enjoy this

**twat\_brained** (6.5): I don't wanna dance either. This just feels like you recycled "Mean".

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**eklxtreme** (6): started out nice but it was the same thing for the whole song and got boring

**jess\_22** (6): the chorus bops, but that's about it

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): too religious for me but great bridge

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6): Nice beat, but there's nothing really special about it? Just an average love song with a decent vocal presence.

**awryj** (5): I kinda enjoy the instrumentation and that's the only thing I can say about this song.

**BionicFunhouse** (5): It isn't painfully boring like some of the other songs, but it really isn't a style I enjoy at all.

**cyborglilith** (5): forgettable

**zamomattel** (5): FILLER QUEEN ALERT

**dropthehammer11** (4): Why is this album 19 tracks, it's already too long

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2.5): filler

**Qwilphish** (2): Bring me back to the beginning of the album again

This song, almost on its own, affected me deeply. And it affected my music. I began listening to more happy songs like this. I think that was a big part in becoming the happier guy I am now, and for that I give it my 11. And also because *that's so fun*.

**BreezySeason** (7.5): Queen of giving up and going out tonight

---
This is a fucking amazing song and if it was put on *Emotion* I bet y'all homosexuals would be stanning it down and I am UPSET. Yes the title is stupid but the song is so moody and melancholic and it's just a slow burn to that chorus that's basically the prototype to "Your Type". There's like three parts to the chorus and it's all so good, with her rushing thoughts just fizzling into a simple request for her lover to make her louder on the phone. Also this song is the sexiest on the album with the very scandalous desire she has for her lover to turn her on. "WHY DON'T YOU TURN ME ON" is such a weird but good line.

---
**mdawgig** (11): So perfect that words cannot describe it. The bop to end all bops. "Turn me on" is an understatement. I am satisfied, Queen Carly.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I feel like this is one of the stronger tracks on the album, the production is tight and the song flows very well. However it would have benefitted from either some additional lyrics or being shortened a bit, the last minute or so feels really unnecessary.

**superr\_rad** (10): i cant believe the legend referenced another legend in the bridge of this!! this song is soooo good, carly is a pop goddess in the purest form

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): It's nice listening to this, but I really can't bring myself to label it as anything more than decent.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Sugar Rating: An Extra-Large Blue Raspberry Slushie And A Family Sized Pack of Sno-Caps But You’re At Home and Alone

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): Like 3/4 of the way through this song I realized I wasn't on the next song yet and it was still going, I was that bored

**blue\_heart\_** (6): This is where the album just starts sounding the same all the time.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Ugh this is really dating sounded. It has some good moments like the part in chorus before she says 'Turn me Up" but overall it's just not a good style for her.

**islimp** (9.5): The only thing that keeps me from giving this a 10 is the fact that it's called "Turn Me Up" but otherwise it's a fave

**Magic\_warlock0-** (7.5): Pretty damn good, it's a good dancing song. The beat is getting a little familiar though, it doesn't feel fresh.

"Now we're screaming just to see who's louder" - based on this song, I think you're winning, Ariana.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): The melody of this song is beautiful and Ariana’s performance is beautiful but the lyrics of this song are kind of… nothing? I get the point that the song is trying to sell but it’s so vague. Like, there’s no reason for half of the lyrics to be wordless vocalizations. It lacks substance. There’s so much about this track that’s amazing, I just kind of wish that it had all been applied to a song that was, you know, good. Also the more I listened to it, the more those snare drums annoyed me.

**superr\_rad** (1): why did this almost get my 0? i cant stand this song!!!! its so lazily written and the nanananas are v annoying. ari couldnt save this for me, and i cant understand why its a fan favorite

**Qwilphish** (10): This song is the perfect showcase of Ariana's voice and emotiveness. Love the lyrics and anthemic feel to this track. This album's Touch It in that it will probably be paid dust but w/e it was definitely a candidate for my 11.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This is yet another addition to Ariana's increasingly growing collection of iconic deep cuts, and I'd argue that it's one of the best of those deep cuts. Greedy who?

**SimplyHaunted** (8): After the first chorus, I did have to look up the lyrics because I wasn't sure if all the na-na-na's were actually na-na-na's or words I couldn't understand. But this still bangs.

---

**refrayn** (10): god bless daddy ryan tedder for this song!!! truly a masterpiece!!! should’ve gone #1!!!

**cyborglilith** (10): tbh this sounds so much like XO except it's not trash

**skiddos** (9): Kinda reminds me of Beyoncé’s XO (Ryan Tedder’s impact). Those “na na na”s are heavenly.

---

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): so whyeeyeeyeeyeeyeey do you tryeeyeeyeey

**triptoyourheart** (5): Beautiful vocals in the chorus but could do without the "why-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie do we try-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie" which grates a bit.

**mokitsu** (10): we love glamorised toxic relationships

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): We love a vocalist.

**mdawgig** (3): Super boilerplate. Filler. Why try indeed.

**mudkip1** (8): /u/letsallpoo

=====

letsallpoo: 


**agentofscranton** (10): one of Ari's career highlights

**angusaditus** (10): Single worthy bop!

**blue\_heart\_** (10): Wow, this is definitely a standout track. Chills.

**rickikardashian** (10): “Now we’re screaming just to see who’s louder” Ariana you’re the only one screaming in here

**TeamAwesome4** (10): This surprised the hell out of me. There are issues, but oh my god this chorus soars like no other, holy shit.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (9.5): What a beautiful song, the chorus is damn near perfection! Ariana’s pipes are super strong, the effect on her voice is a great touch, and the little moments like the heart skip makes for memorable song!

**twat\_brained** (9.5): How was THIS not a single??? This is fantastic and gives me "Thinking 'Bout You" teas!

**eklxtreme** (9): I love the huge vocals in the chorus and how the song is still so chill and relaxing

**Elitefourbrad** (9): Great vocals from Ariana! Mariah who?

**lady\_sable** (9): I love her voice so much

**musicotic** (9): Catchy but there's something missing

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): wow I have never heard this before; it's amazing!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This song is low-key underrated. I love her vocals here.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I'M LOVING THE PAIN

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): The production on this is really good, it really builds nicely

**10footnotes** (8): There’s a nice mix of vocal techniques like belting and falsetto in this song.

**enecks** (8): A good pop song.

**MissyBee37** (8): The "na na"s on this song are so good; my favorite part, for sure.

**supersecrettest** (8): Really great vocals

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Triumphant track here. It’s not an album standout but it’s really pleasant and a nice track to follow One Last Time.

**skargardin** (7): Fairly average in both lyricism and production. Doesn’t do that much for me.

**therokinrolla** (7): its a lovely song, but this song feels a little generic. But! A bop is a bop

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**MrSwearword** (6): it’s fine, but she’s done better.

**OberionSynth** (6): sometimes I ask why I try listening to this song but then other times I'm like so into it

**Piccprincess** (6): Why? Because I'm thirsty

**VodkaInsipido** (6): Sorry but I’m here for the features, not Ariana singing solo.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (5): this sounds like it would be in a lifetime original film about basketball

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): forgettable imo.

**jess\_22** (5): queen of na na na's

**strawberryswing1** (5): The only weak song on the album imo. The lyrics are not good, full of cliches.

**zamomattel** (4): Interesting that the song where she sounds like she hasn't tried is called Why Try.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): exactly

**VeganSquash** (3): I want to like this song, but the lyrics suck ass

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): zzz

A bop and a half, even if it's far from an album standout, and a good showing from Cashmere Cat. I do enjoy their collabs - please stream "Quit" on Tidal today. Or "Adore". Or "Love Incredible". Okay, maybe not that last one.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love the stepwise melody of this song and Cashmere Cat put out some great production. Plus I love the message of this song, It misses out on the 10 from me though because Ariana’s diction is pretty sloppy at a lot of points on here, which is a pity because the lyrics are actually really cool. I know a guy who says that the reason that Ariana is so interesting as a performer because she understands what she’s singing and conveys emotion so well with every word, but you just can’t understand what those words are.

**CharmingArsenal** (9.5): Did anyone really know Cashmere Cat before this song? Very few people including myself. He's still not that well known, but he should be! I was excited when I saw him on the tracklisting, and the song did not disappoint as it is one of my favorites on the album.

**MissyBee37** (10): This song is fabulous. Whatever that sound is right at the beginning (and recurring throughout) is magic. I actually love the verses even more than the chorus. Just a great song.

---

**wailordfan** (10): This is the best Ari/Cashmere Cat collab to date, and you can @ me on that.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I’m a huge Cashmere Cat fan and I love all of his and Ariana’s collabs, although in retrospect this is probably my least favorite of the ones he’s done with her.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): A laidback bop, I wish Ari and Cashmere Cat worked together more cause they make straight tunes

**therokinrolla** (8): better than their other collab. Cashmere cat serves production mmm

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): honestly this deserved single status over One Last Snooze. tbh it's the best thing Cashmere Cat's ever done, and Ari sounds so confident!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): It looks like Cashmere Cat and Ariana go well together. The production here is very solid and it's overall much better than 'lOOOvvEee yOOoUUr lOOveEe'

**Elitefourbrad** (8): The production from Cashmere Cat is amazing!

**blue\_heart\_** (5): this sounds more like a Cashmere Cat song than an Ari song. She's lucky I kinda live for CC.

**twat\_brained** (8): Was this song responsible for kickstarting Cashmere Cat's career? If so, thanks Ari! You did a good job. Not that it's worthy of the final day or anything, though.

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): Cashmere Cat does his thing here

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): got a 6 instead of a 3 because Cashmere

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I adore R&B Ariana.

**PuggleMaster** (10): my favorite song from these two

**mokitsu** (9.5): excellent filler but filler nonetheless

**zamomattel** (9.5): THIS PRODUCTION, MARRY ME

**musicotic** (9): Catchy

**skyblade79** (9): the production is so good and that “if you want to be my lover…” melody is an eargasm

**supersecrettest** (9): The production is great.

**eklxtreme** (8): it's pretty catchy and the production is good

**ignitethephoenix** (8): The production is really good, but the chorus is kind of meh. It's a little forgettable to me. But I love when Ariana does he fast talking/singing.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (8): I love the little handclaps and the sultry tone of Ari’s voice here. A very solid romantic song.

**mdawgig** (7.5): Boring rhythmically, lyrically, and vocally, but the interesting production saves it from being another Best Mistake-level mistake.

**10footnotes** (7): I wish I had something interesting to say about this song, but I don’t. It’s nice. It’s more interesting than the track before it (Best Mistake). It’s not a personal standout. Next song.

**enecks** (7): I don't like the be my baby stuff, but this is some gud production.

**MrSwearword** (7): a case of production overshadowing Ari’s vocals.

**OwenKam50** (7): Legit no difference between verse and chorus

**Qwilphish** (7): It's alright nothing overtly bad to say, but there is no one point that I can say I love.

**triptoyourheart** (7): Mariah's impact

**VeganSquash** (7): DAMN those high notes!

**skargardin** (6.5): It’s alright but utterly forgettable.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): pretty forgettable, despite an interesting instrumental from CC

**jess\_22** (6): song's cute but the lyrics are generic af

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5.5): lyrics kinda dumb. very simple.

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/KMncc4fs)

**BreezySeason** (10): Queen of key changes

---
If you haven't yet, I recommend listening to the original version of the song, which was part of its titular EP, because even though the lyrics and singing are the exact same, the production really turns the song into something completely different. The one on *Kiss* is a lot more fine-tuned, and the instrumental really separates the verses to give the chorus a bigger punch. The changes are certainly interesting, but I'm not sure if I necessarily agree with them. And that key change is still pretty whatever.

---
**AFlyingWhale\_** (11): such a great song I love the buildup in the pre and the verses and chorus flow together soo well

**TeamAwesome4** (11): I don't even have a reason for this, other than it's the best song here.

---

**RandomDKguy** (6): Cured the cat

**johnazoidberg-** (8): Curiosity killed this beat

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Sugar Rating: An Entire Box of Cocoa Puffs

---
**bluehxrizon** (9): the key change! when will Greedy

**nooodisaster** (8.5): THAT KEY CHANGE

**skiddos** (8): That key change!

**lady\_sable** (9): That key change actually killed me.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): something something key change

---


**Qwilphish** (10): I just learned that Carly released an EP before this album came out and that this was its second single. This song is so fun and I'm mad I have only heard of this song now, this should be the go-to song as proof of Kiss's quality.

**twat\_brained** (10): I wasn't looking forward to this at first because I remember not enjoying it when it was on the radio. To my surprise, the album version is not the same as the radio edit; it's better! There are elements that make it stick out more, giving me a greater appreciation for it. Way to go Carly! THIS is why you're my favorite Canadian musician.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): There’s just a disconnect between what she’s singing about and the sound of the song that kills it for me. This is a dark and pleading song, and that’s not really what it’s selling. The beat is too bright and energetic and Carly is hitting all of the notes but I don’t think she really has any sort of connection to the song, if she has one it’s not coming through in her performance. She kinda sounds like she’s phoning it in, she sounds bored for most of it. This song sounds like something I’d hear playing out of one of those stores selling CDs in a Vietnamese mall, a weirdly specific comparison but it’s the one I’m presenting.

**wailordfan** (10): This song honestly almost got its 11 from me, a die hard Taylor stan. The key change makes me honestly wet, and lyrically is actually pretty strong for a Carly song. There are tons of really small things that really make the song stand out too, like the little guitar pluck leading into the key change, and the almost bland sounding backing vocals that really sharpen the leads. It is an honestly amazing song.

letsallpoo: 


**cloudbustingmp3** (10): honestly this could be a Kylie song it's that good. also that key change! Greedy found dead in a ditch!

**lexarqade** (10): This didn't deserve to flop and is arguably better than CMM. The US did her so dirty. Looking on wikipedia this got top 10 in South Korea? Who knew

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Ok sis! Give us a bop!

**PuggleMaster** (10): my wig is in orbit after the key change. The best song on the album

**zamomattel** (10): CAN YOU IMAGINE A LIP SYNC TO THIS MY GODDDD

**henry413** (9.5): Her team wasted this potential hit, just release the video officially!

**mdawgig** (9.5): Queen of not being able to stand the way you're smilin'.

**CharmingArsenal** (9): I actually prefer the original version of this song, the album version ended up a bit too overproduced.

**skyblade79** (9): best song on the album. Kind of production carried, but it’s very cute!

**superr\_rad** (9): the i know i know reminds me of Swine by Gaga, but the KEY CHANGE has taken me there

**supersecrettest** (9): I think this song is starting to sound a bit dated. However, the chorus is still amazing and I think Carly sells it.

**therokinrolla** (9): this song would be a 10, but the “oh oh”s during the chorus are almost unbareable. Which is a shame bc everything else here is perfect

**lulbady** (8.5): i heard this once while shopping in 2012 and every now and then i still get the chorus stuck in my head

**blue\_heart\_** (8): the first half of this album is still decent. I didn't even hate tiny little bows that much.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I only heard of the remix version of this song and it's good. Definitely not a highlight for me in this album though.

**enecks** (8): So while this is nowhere near as polished as Emotion, Kiss has much more interesting production. This reminds me of Swine?

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song would be even better if it was sped up just a bit.

**Leixander** (8): Cute but it has a lazy chorus.

**luigi\_is\_better** (8): too much edm for me but still a bop

**Magic\_warlock0-** (8): Another surprisingly catch song. It's a bit stalkerish, but it's pretty interesting to hear about how caught up a person can get with their object of desire

**OberionSynth** (8): this song got intense real quick

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is a little overhyped, but the chorus is one of the best things Carly did pre-Emotion.

**Piccprincess** (8): I'm curious about Calvin's body

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): This album is very boppable. So groovy. This song follows suit

**jess\_22** (7.5): CERTIFIED BOP

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.5): I’m sorry but the EP version was way better. [Anyway, here’s a link to the EP version’s music video that was never officially released due to its sexual nature considering Carly’s demographic at the time.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXVY5LW17T4)

**musicotic** (7.5): Key change is extremely cringe-worthy

**rickikardashian** (7.5): I really thought it would say “so don’t stop, make it pop, dj blow my speakers out…”

**skargardin** (7.5): Up until the bridge it was really good but then it became really flat.

**Cryomatic** (7): the Curiousity EP version is miles ahead of this

**eklxtreme** (7): nice but kinda generic, not much of a stand out

**chili\_jones** (6.5): did not age well

**BionicFunhouse** (6): This sounds like an E•MO•TION C-Side

**dirdbub** (6): this is a non-song

**Elitefourbrad** (6): This has the same chord progression as Swine in the pre-chorus, so I’ll give it that. Otherwise just a filler track...

**Johnnytoby** (6): generic

**MissyBee37** (6): I was kind of bored but literally gave it an extra half a point just for the key change at 2:23, which instantly makes it more interesting and fun.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): Kind of unmemorable bubblegum

**10footnotes** (5): Just... eh. It's uninteresting.

**RandomPotatos** (5): too many ohs not enough space

**refrayn** (5): carly sounds bored as fuck and the bridge is so uncomfortable

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): I'm not going to remember what this sounds like by the time the rate reveal comes around.

**MrSwearword** (4.5): another song I remember showing off her even worse live singing. #BlessYouTubeCompilations

**cyborglilith** (4): no tune, and the song goes nowhere

**mokitsu** (4): the "i know i know" part reminds me of a Gaga song but i don't remember the name

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (3): it just committed suicide in mars

**VeganSquash** (3): it was...okay? Kind-of forgettable though

**BearlyEvenAPun** (2): EP version would be a 10. This is just a mess in comparison

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (2): I give this a 2 because the remixed version on this album is absolute garbage compared to the one on her EP. Please, please listen to that instead.

vagenda: holy SHIT there's two versions of Curiosity!! I knew I loved this song a few years ago but when I was listening to it for the rate I thought the production sounded super junky.

I always thought this song was trying to hard to be quirky and relatable and cheesy that it just ended up as this generic mess. It's remarkable basic for a Max Martin/Shellback song, and compared to how intricate so much of *Red* is, I never had a use of it. To Taylor's credit, it's become a bit of a birthday staple, but if anyone sings it to me when I turn 22 I'm gonna beat their ass.

---

**skiddos** (0): A good beat doesn't justify how absolutely annoying this song is. She's 22 but the lyrics sound like they were written by a 12 year old. This is what a white girl’s tumblr page sounds like. If Claire’s had a theme song, it would be this. This song sounds like a bonus track on a Bratz soundtrack. If my kindergarten teacher had a music career, this would’ve been her debut single. Max Martin must’ve proposed this for the iCarly soundtrack, but Nickelodeon thought the song was too childish for Miranda Cosgrove. I couldn’t tell the difference between this and its Kidz Bop cover. This song refuses to eat its vegetables. This song is like a grown woman who rings your doorbell on Halloween and asks you for candy.

---
**bluehxrizon** (10): i still start singing this every time someone mentions the number 22

**angusaditus** (8): This song came out when I was 22 (Taylor wasn't 22 when this came out btw), and safe to say that it was my anthem. I played it at every social setting and people actually started getting annoyed with me to the point that a girl pulled me to the side one time and asked me to please play less Taylor lolol

**Johnnytoby** (10): deserves top 22

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): can i give this a 22

**Kaylaboe** (4.5): i kinda wanted to give this 2.2 but oh well

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (2): I almost gave this a 0 because I turn 22 next year and I know I'm gonna hear people sing this to me a million times asdgjll;

**enecks** (1): WTF kind of line is "I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two"? I hated being 22. 22 is a bad year. This is a bad song.

**RandomDKguy** (10): Who hasn't celebrated their 22th birthday without hearing (or atleast just thinking of) this song atleast once?! [Well i did](https://i.imgur.com/M32avmX.png)

**skargardin** (10): Every 22-year old has jammed to this. Me included.

**SpanKKy1** (10): how many dicks I intend to succ this week

---

**dirdbub** (10): breakfast at midnight quickly leads to my favorite self care method: seeing god behind the 7/11 at 3:34AM after you down 6 and a half 5 Hour Energys

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): By the time the rate reveal is happening, I am 20 so I can't wait for two more years where I can sing and set this song as my ringtone. It's gonna be fun. And I am still bopping to this in 2017. IKYWT wishes it could be this good and **not** dated.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): assay? assay. Probably the best Tay song. It encapsulates perfectly the feeling of being young and having fun. Of course it follows the classic pop pattern of verse 1, chorus, verse 2, chorus, bridge, chorus, but it's dominated perfectly. The mix of guitard chords in the verses against the pop production of the chorus showcases what Red is about. And also, the chorus hits like a train. Perfect pop.

**animefangrant62** (9.5): “dress up like hipsters” is embarrassing but it’s Tay Tay so it’s perfectly in line with her image. An elaborate AI cyborg that mostly relates to humans. Mostly.

**eklxtreme** (6.5): lol the first verses are so poorly written. this song had potential I suppose but it sounds like it was produced in 1 hour. at least the chorus takes some nice vibes from MMMBop.

**superr\_rad** (6): this is where my praise for Red kinda ends. have i bopped this? yes. will i be singing this all day when i turn 22? of course. but after the 30th listen, this gets really old. and its very generic, even for taylor. but im still boppin so

**Piccprincess** (10): The night before my 22nd birthday, I was out at a bar. Right at midnight, the bartender (who knew me because I was there way too much but that's a story for another day) blasted this and poured me a free drink. I was so hungover the next day - which was my actual birthday. Worth it.

**lady\_sable** (8.5): I have a lot of nostalgia for this song tbh. I know that, objectively, it's one of the weaker songs on the album, but honestly I can't help but love it. It's so fun and catchy and upbeat.

**fifthchevron** (9): It's such generic bubblegum pop but that's what I love about it. Points for clarifying that life doesn't actually end when you stop being a teen, and you can still have reckless fun as an adult sometimes. "You look like bad news/I gotta have you" is as self aware as pre-Blank Space Taylor gets.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Man, I really can't believe this song was released five years ago. It was playing so much on Nickelodeon at the time and it kind of annoyed me. That being said, this is a really fun song, though the 'Who's Taylor Swift anyway?' part in the middle is pretty embarrassing. Makes me excited to be 22.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): “Okay, the world isn’t ready for Shake It Off, so I’m keeping that one in the vault for right now. I got this song called 22. It’s about being a young millennial in the world and it rhymes with you! I know right! Perfect. Alright, I just need to work on it more, I need to figure out where to shoehorn in hipsters.”

letsallpoo: 


**gannade** (10): The best song Taylor has done. Despite her nasally yoUUUUUUuUUUUUUuuUUUUuuuu at the end of each chorus, the song is a total bop.

**johnazoidberg-** (10): I don't know about you, but I'm feeling like despite the horrible lyrics to this song, it's a jam. This isn't exactly the height of artistry, but it's a fun song and sometimes that's just what we need music to be

**musicotic** (10): Iconic

**Nfranklin50** (10): Indieheads is shook

**OwenKam50** (10): Some fun amidst a sea of songs about relationships

**piplup123** (10): Todd in the shadows said this was Taylor’s equivalent of pulling a Miley and I can’t say I disagree.

**PuggleMaster** (10): her best song

**refrayn** (10): gets better every time i listen to it

**rickikardashian** (10): I was supposed to hate on Taylor for being shady to my _lil bby Harry Style_ on the VMA’s, but damn this song was just amazing

**awryj** (9.5): I DUNNO BOUT YOU, BUT I'M FEELIN TWENTY TWOOO and i'm actually 15 and this is just what my notion of adulthood looks like

**henry413** (9.5): The fact she managed to make "feels 22" not cringe-worthy amazes me.

**poppinmmolly** (9.5): you BET YOUR ASS that this was on repeat when I turned 22!! All Day!!

**therokinrolla** (9.5): anyone who hasnt yelled that hook at least once is probably not human

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (9): In 2012 the way she puts the stress on the second half of the word "hipster" is the most influential I ever thought Kesha would be tbh.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (9): “ASHLEY DIANNA CLAIRE SELENA” WHO IS TAYLOR SWIFT ANYWAYS EW

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): bitch me too! the fuck!


**MrSwearword** (9): if I block out the bad live singing footage, this is actually really great.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Is this really what 22 feels like?

**OberionSynth** (9): let's be real I've been counting down the days until my 22nd birthday so I can finally sing this song properly

**Qwilphish** (9): I am not 22, but it is absolutely mandatory for everyone to sing this song when they turn 22. Really fun

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): ironic

**zamomattel** (9): So catchy my lordt, the only reason people care about being 22

**cyborglilith** (8.5): good but it's out of place in the album

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Love the chorus of the song it's iconic and so catchy.

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): Fun little bop I listened to on my 22nd birthday. The “who’s Taylor Swift anyway” takes away from the song, it would’ve been cute if she only put that in the music video.

**10footnotes** (8): You’d better believe that I’ll be blasting this song repeatedly on my 22nd birthday.

**blue\_heart\_** (8): Taylor's fun songs, although this one isn't the best of them, will get too much hate this rate. Also a great video!

**Elitefourbrad** (8): An innocent song about being young and partying, how can you not love this?

**TeamAwesome4** (8): If you post this as your FB status on your 22nd birthday, you're basic. If you don't, I don't want to talk to you, ever.

**twat\_brained** (8): Fun? Yes. Boppable? Yes. Flawless? No. "YOUUU" is somewhat of an earsore, and how can someone "look like bad news"? I think there's a place for it in the upper half, but not the top 10.

**VeganSquash** (8): the chorus is a little bit of a letdown tbh! I wanted a little more oomph.

**mdawgig** (7): Kinda forgettable, but I can understand why it did so well.

**mokitsu** (7): mega bop!

**nooodisaster** (7): A song that instantly got a lot less cool by the time I actually turned 22.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): The lack of rhyme in the first two lines annoys me.

**CharmingArsenal** (5): My 22nd year was alot different than Taylor's it seems...

**lexarqade** (5): I wonder if this'll go out at this position in the rate. Hope my score helps. Jokes aside I do not like this song at all.

**luigi\_is\_better** (5): this song was nice the first 3 times that i listened back when the album was released but damn does it get worse. stay stay stay outsold

**supersecrettest** (5): There's something about this song that bothers me: Taylor Swift, really has none of the same problems as any "normal" 22 year old. But it's a cute song with a cute beat so let's all "bop" right...

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): like I feel about most of Taylor Swift's hits: catchy, but increasingly annoying.

**skyblade79** (4.5): After hearing this a thousand times, it really loses its charm. The lyrics aren’t great, and though the message is cute enough, I can’t dig it. Her little accent annoys me.

**jess\_22** (4): WAY too overproduced and Taylor's screechy vocals? just no.

**dropthehammer11** (3): This song is so bad. The lyrics are so immature and it's just so bland. Not a fan at all

**ImADudeDuh** (2): for a song called 22, this is chilidsh as fuck

**Magic\_warlock0-** (2): Fucking awful, I hate the way she pronounces everything in this terrible song. I dislike this damn song a lot

**BreezySeason** (7): Queen of dropping her phone in the pool

---
Most people pin the GP's perception of Carly as a kiddie singer on the success of "Call Me Maybe". But I disagree - I blame it on this fucking song. "Good Time" sounds like a Kidz Bop original song that showcases absolutely none of the charm and legitimate maturity Carly has demonstrated. This song is honestly the most immature sounding song on *Kiss*, which really says something. I can appreciate it for the fact that it prevented her from being a 1-hit wonder, but as a song it's absolutely useless to me.

**jess\_22** (0): easiest 0 I ever gave. Awful auto tune, the woah oh oh's are straight up annoying and it has that generic 2012 sound. garbage.

**skyblade79** (0): oh god, I hate this song so much. There’s not one redeemable quality about it and I wish it didn’t exist. Even worse, I can’t believe that people actually like it???

**VeganSquash** (0): I fucking hate this shitty dumpster trailer trash song. And its on that stupid ass credit card commercial all the time like u_u

---

**awryj** (10): This song is obviously pop perfection, but I ABSOLUTELY HATE ADAM YOUNG'S ACCENT and I wonder if anyone else has the same allergic reaction to it. Like when he sings "slept iyehn all my clothes like I didn't cyaer, hopped iyehn to a cab, take me any-wyaer", I can't help but cringe a little and I don't know why.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is still literally one of my favortie party songs ever. This is how you do pop perfection! Too bad this song won't do well in the rate. I hope I am wrong.

**Qwilphish** (6): I want to rate this higher but something about its 2012-ness, the return of Owl City, and pure happiness makes me have to rate it lower than my actual enjoyment of the song. Really generic but w/e it's a bop.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): Ugh, Carly is actually good in her vocals on this song, but Owl City cannot sing and he drags the whole thing down. It's a nice, summery bubbly song but when one half of a duet can't sing it just makes the song incomplete

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Probably one of the stronger tracks on the album but it just doesn’t do it for me. I dunno, maybe it’s because the Owl City guy is autotuned within an inch of his life but something about it just feels so sterile and mechanical. It’s about good clean fun, but maybe a little too good and too clean. It’s like, I feel like this is “Christian Camp” good time, a noncontroversial song that the hip pastor plays during the church social to prove that he’s down with the cool kids. Nothing is necessarily wrong with that, but it’s just not for me. I will say it has good energy though. DNCE would later take more or less the same hook and use it on their [“Toothbrush”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrUJyKsLQeU) and do it better.

**superr\_rad** (10): im rating this a 10 because i feel like the sub is going to mistreat it as the proper bop it is. its just a feel good song that makes you forget about all the herpes problems you have

**reddituser206** (7): the most generic 2012 pop song possible, so forgettable that it hit the top 10 and people still call Carly a one hit wonder. it could have been written by the Kidz Bop Kids. still a bop.

**MissyBee37** (6.5): Bonus points for Owl City. Love him! I like the feel-good, innocent vibe of this song. It's nice to think pop can still allow for a "good time" that isn't R-rated. Man, I sound old. But I stand by my point.

**twat\_brained** (10): This was a collaboration for the AGES! I'm happy it went top 10, but it DESERVED #1. My only wish is that y'all will vindicate this bop by giving it top 5. After the Disney/Nick rate however, I won't hold my breath.

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): ok so when this song was everywhere my friends used to mock me for liking it and there was a time that i was like "ugh this song sucks" but nowadays i dropped all these friends and my popping this song every(good)time no matter what people say bitch

---

**SpanKKy1** (10): owl city doing charity work here

**strawberryswing1** (10): I never realized this was on her album. I always assumed this was an Owl City single. Poor Carly Rae.

**enecks** (9): What is Owl City? What is with these vocals? At least he is shouting out Prince, Prince is a talented person. Good chorus. Catchy. Soulless. Vacuous. Pop.

**TeamAwesome4** (7): I refuse to believe Owl City listens to Prince.

**MrSwearword** (2): quite the contrary

**gannade** (5): Owl City is a 0 and Cary is a 10 so heres the average.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Sugar Rating: Straight Up Bucket of Sugar

**Leixander** (4): More like, Memes - Memes with Memes

**Piccprincess** (7): It's always a good time in bed with Calvin

letsallpoo: 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): the only good song

**dropthehammer11** (10): This deserves a 10 bc it's so damn feel good

**fifthchevron** (10): Issa bop.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A bop, plain and simple.

**musicotic** (10): I actually love this song

**OberionSynth** (10): queen of not even having to try

**OwenKam50** (10): Owl city was THE stan from age 11 to 14

**RandomDKguy** (10): an ANTHEM. FUCK Happy. FUCK Can't Stop The Feeling. Good Time is the best Happy Anthem of all time! *It's always a Good Time*

**refrayn** (10): CERTIFIED BOP

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i've overplayed this so much ahahh

**floofeh** (9): to me this is an almost perfect pop song. Tight production, nice beat and the voices of both singers mesh great together.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): The King and Queen of having good times in 2012.

**skargardin** (9): One of the few tracks where I can actually stand Owl City.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): you wouldn't believe your eyes if a thousand kisses

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): harmless but fun lil bop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): This is such a feel-good song that it almost made me forgot about my depression for a minute.

**zamomattel** (8.5): I could not believe my eyes when ten million Carly Raes lit up the room as I fell asleep

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (8): I totally would tbh

**Cryomatic** (8): why is this otherwise exactly the same as the radio version outside of the high-pitched "wE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TRY" to the end of the prechorus

**Elitefourbrad** (8): A great summer song for sure, about just having a Good Time!

**lady\_sable** (8): Really nostalgic tbh

**lexarqade** (8): this unapologetically goes off. Also ensured Carly wasn't a one hit wonder!

**mdawgig** (8): Great, but not a stand-out on an album of stand-outs. The Owl City feature is something I could take or leave.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): A cute little bop.

**RandomPotatos** (8): I've jammed to this and won't deny it

**supersecrettest** (8): The song that prevents Carly from being a one-hit wonder.

**wailordfan** (8): This song deserved to blow up the way it did, and oddly, neither party got any more popular. They both peaked here, and both went on to release some good music, but got 0 attention for it.

**10footnotes** (7.5): Carly does Ke$ha.

**cyborglilith** (7): getting Can't Stop the Feeling vibes but it's way better

**johnazoidberg-** (7): Can't wait until Carly collaborates with Raccoon City and serves us all the tea virus.

**Johnnytoby** (7): oh god

**Kaylaboe** (7): tbh i hated this back in 2012 but it’s not really that bad. still generic af tho

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Adam's vocals here are so Autotuned to the point where it's not funny. I'm begrudgingly giving this a decent score because it's weirdly boppable, but it really shouldn't be.

**therokinrolla** (6.5): i dont like owl city pls dont attack :emofish:

**CharmingArsenal** (6): The two weakest songs on this album are the features. This song would be better without Owl City. That Prince song is stuck in your head because Prince is a god. Stop namedropping.

**henry413** (6): Um... A cute little album track?

**mokitsu** (6): this is a cute song but their happiness seems very....forced?

**whatyourheartdesires** (6): the whole album is perfect for you children's birthday parties

**blue\_heart\_** (5): with songs like these I always have to weigh my opinion between them being fun and objectively bad. I'm middling my score because of that.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (4): Never really liked this song, Owl City sucks here. There's just not too much to this song

It took me years to appreciate the simple beauty of "Begin Again". Out of all of the singles from this era, this song in particular is much more subdued and nuanced; there's no explosive chorus or overt hooks. But it carries this irristable charm and an indelible chorus and a slow-churning melody that only seems fitting for an album like *Red*. Lyrically the song is about two relationships - one that's just finished, and one that's just beginning - and how that space between the two is at once terrifying and enchanting. She sings of watching "it" begin again, and she leaves the listener to figure out what that "it" really is: her love life, her confidence, her willingness to fall in the dangers of love again. One of the best songs in the rate, hands down.

---

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Easily the best song on this album, and possibly Taylor Swift's best song. After an entire album of trying and failing to convey any emotion other than melancholy, she finally succeeds at making a mature, optimistic ballad that I actually connect to.

**dirdbub** (10): I don’t know why, but this is always going to be one of my favorite Taylor songs. deserves a lot of respect, everything about it is just perfect and what country should be

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): An amazing closer to one of my favorite albums ever. It's low-key clever that she had this song as a closer since Taylor is literally asking the listener to being the album again. I forgot that this song was a single too.

**fifthchevron** (10): I wish this had gotten more attention, it's a very important subject (You can love again/no such thing as damaged goods/one man's twisted view of you isn't the sum of your worth) and I'm glad Taylor gives young women songs that remind them to not listen to the toxic shit men tell you.

**Nfranklin50** (10): This is the perfect example of Taylor's ability to create a mood and an emotion. I've never been in a relationship in my life but you bet when she starts talking about how her past boyfriend didn't like the stuff she did you bet i'm there singing along like I too am a damaged soul

**MrSwearword** (8): I’m forgiving this quality dissonance between verse and chorus this time [because at least “on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it Begin Again” is the least dopey chorus she’s written for this album.]

**blue\_heart\_** (10): This is a similar song, to me, as Stay Stay Stay. While Stay Stay Stay made me happier, for lack of a better description, Begin Again made me less sad. And maybe now there's a guy in my life, and maybe it begins again.

---

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): Purity Ring did it better

**johnazoidberg-** (5): Welcome to Taylor Swift's coffee shop, where every latte is pumpkin spice, every tea is chai, and half of this album never needed to be released

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): “Alright, I just need to make this album as long as possible so let me through this B-side on here.”

**mdawgig** (10): This song feels like a warm hug from your grandma after something goes bad.

=====

letsallpoo: 
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): THIS WAS AMAZING AND THE VIDEO IS OUT OF THIS WORLD “I WEAR HEELS NOW”

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): a perfect closer! honestly one of her best written songs + her delivery works so well

**cyborglilith** (10): what i was prepared for: giving red bad scores what I wasn't prepared for: this song

**Damoojo** (10): One of the best songs on the album for me.

**lady\_sable** (10): Queen of moving on

**OberionSynth** (10): my friends don't really get this song but I do

**OwenKam50** (10): Back to december vibes

**Piccprincess** (10): I love Wednesdays in cafes.

**refrayn** (10): beautiful

**wailordfan** (10): It is sad to think this is the last country sounding tune Taylor would bless us with before developing a full pop sound.

**angusaditus** (9): this song takes me through it every time :sad:

**eklxtreme** (9): this is the sweet country-esque vibe I wished she stuck to cus she does it well

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This track was so great that it reminded me of all the great songs from the beginning of the album and I relistened to them all.

**islimp** (9): Absolute favorite song on this album. I like to think that this is one of her nicest works.

**poppinmmolly** (9): It took a long time for this song to grow on me.

**therokinrolla** (9): ending with a somewhat happy song called begin again. Ye its cliche but it pulls it off well because there is nothing taylor does better than a sappy ballad

**10footnotes** (8.5): The album ending with the song about beginnings makes my sentimental heart happy.

**henry413** (8.5): The bridge is just heavenly, also for whatever reason I always believed it was 5 minutes long lol.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Very solid effort from Taylor here. It's a moderate pace, but just enough to keep me intrigued :)

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I think she wanted to make another Back To December, but it's. It that great.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I wouldn't classify this as one of Taylor's best ballads or anything, but it's nice to listen to. I think this is where the standard edition of the album ends?

**superr\_rad** (8): its cute and is that an accordion?

**supersecrettest** (8): I like her vocals on this one

**zamomattel** (8): originally gave this quite a low score, but after almost crying to it while walking around in public, it deserves a better fate

**rickikardashian** (7.5): This is me when I’m getting a crush on another guy after I said I was done with love

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): cute song, it's not purity ring though

**enecks** (7): I wish her career would begin again. I wish she hadn't fallen to the lows she did. Then again, why am I judging someone infinitely more successful than I am?

**jess\_22** (7): mesmerisingly beautiful

**PuggleMaster** (6.5): not nearly as good as it was hyped up to be

**CharmingArsenal** (6): zzzzzzz Just 3 more songs and it's over.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (5): It's dull, and not all that emotion invoking. Points for being an good two-stepping song, but that's all it gets from me.

**Qwilphish** (5): At this point I have resolved myself to the fact the rest of this album is the same song with differing tempos.

**BionicFunhouse** (4): Aaaaaand another boring song.

**dropthehammer11** (4): I'm all for corny love songs but something about Taylor is just so embarrassing. This is no exception

**mokitsu** (3): filler

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): boring

I'm just going to copy and paste what I wrote for [my Throwback Thursday post](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5m4t7x/throwback_taylor_swift_we_are_never_ever_getting/) on this song:

>Country music by women typically play into two stereotypes, those being the melodramatic, sultry songstress or the raging, scorned woman bent on burning down society. You can think of "Teardrops on my Guitar" and "Picture to Burn" from her debut, or for more pertinent Swift songs, "Back to December" and "Mean" from *Speak Now*, Taylor's album before this infamous song.

>Pop music is different, and Taylor's transition to pop was less of a transition than it was a complete rejection of the roles she could play in country music. WANEGBT is neither melodramatic or aggressively malicious; it occupies a strange middle space, where she manages to blatantly rip on her ex while maintaining a distinct playfulness and sarcasm that, while adding to the sting of her words, keep the song bubbly and fun. Pop music, above all else, is meant to be fun, and here Taylor explores the boundless freedom the genre permits her while still maintaining that essential quality.

>There's other stuff you can unpack about this song: how the little spoken quips echoing actual conversations signify authenticity without actually being intimate, how it's probably self-parody that eclipses "Blank Space" in both subtlety and release date, how it's unapologetically bratty, cattish, and downright catchy. But I think, above all else, WANEGBT will primarily be remembered as Taylor's transition, where she successfully departed from one genre and found herself comfortably sitting in another.

>So what is this song? Is it meant to be a humorous depiction of a woman at the end of a disastrous relationship? A humbling autobiography dripping in self-parody? Just a catchy song about nothing in particular that you can shout along to? Is it a jab at men? A jab at John Mayer? At hipsters? Am I just shitposting? Who knows! That's all part of the fun, of course. Wee-EEEE!

---
**piplup123** (11): this is her most fun song to sing along too. Shake It off who?


**BionicFunhouse** (0): Just as annoying as I remembered.

**gannade** (0): Wow ok I need to write an assay on why this is one of the worst songs ever made ever like ever ever. First, I think Taylor realized she doesn't have the strongest voice; so in an ill-advised attempt to stand out, she inexplicably starts singing through her nose in this song. That weeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE is the stuff of nightmares. Second, I hate that valley girl accent in the verses. I guess it's supposed to be a parody in a way, but why is Taylor making fun of the valley girl demographic that makes up most of her fanbase? Third, that bridge. Fourth, Selena does the whole "my singing voice isn't that great so I'll just talk through the whole song" thing a lot better. Fifth, weeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeee. Overall, this song is the kind of thing Regina George pre-bus crash would listen to, and I can't be on the same side as that.

---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Oh fuck yes, the song that slowly turned me into a Taylor stan. This song is like pop perfection tbh. It's also the best lead single among Tay's lead singles from her other albums.

**johnazoidberg-** (10): This song was so incredibly overplayed but now that it hasn't been played 3 times an hour on every radio station for a while, it's awesome again. This was the moment Taylor switched from country to pop for me. Yeah, there's still a little country twang in the guitar, but THIS IS A PURE POP SONG. And it's a damn good one

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this song is going to be unnecessarily trashed but it's cute and fun! also that time she dragged whichever one of those boy band ppl with it (they're all the same to me idk) was so funny lmao

**superr\_rad** (4): ok, this song actually turned me off from taylor back when it was released. i stanned her from self-titled to speak now and hated this so much i didnt listen to Red until like 2014. but, i eventually came around on it and definitely bopped it hard. i still dont think its very good. if this is any indicator, this has to rank in one of the worst taylor songs.

**rickikardashian** (10): We are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): this is the song I most associate with Taylor, so it's definitely a hard one to like. I'm gonna give it some points for the very catchy hook, but I'm also gonna take some points off for "like ever". Cringe.

**OberionSynth** (10): okay honestly i love and hate this song at the same time. I'll groan when I hear it start but I'm belting "WE ARE NEVER EVER EVER" like 30 seconds later so idk what I'm doing with my life

**fifthchevron** (7): I used to hate this but I've come around. It's the prequel to Blank Space, there's nothing here that isn't said with a sly wink. It's just blunt where Blank Space really nailed the metaphor/in joke. Will always be here for Taylor's hatred of hipsters/music snobs.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): The whole 'indie record that's much cooler than mine' lyric is kind of hilarious in hindsight considering the fact that Taylor's next album would finally warm indie critics up to certain pop artists, for some reason. This was overplayed, the music video is kind of weird with all the costumes, and it's probably not very good objectively, but it is catchy as hell.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Okay, no lie, this was my SHIT in 2012! But if anyone could make me enjoy a Taylor song, it's Max Martin. Can you believe this was the first of 4 #1 singles for Taylor? All of which were written by Max? I can imagine anyone else, ESPECIALLY a one hit wonder, giving her a #1 single.

**strawberryswing1** (8): This whole happy pop song - sad country song - another happy pop song is why she rightfully did not win nor deserve that AOTY Grammy. Another fun little bop though.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (10): This song is one of her best of the album, and in my Top 5 for all her songs. I love the messy relationship portrayed, her guitar and voice is perfect here, and it's all so well put together!

letsallpoo: 

**awryj** (10): This is the kind of a song that I would normally hate but I absolutely love it and I'm only slightly ashamed of it.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): THE SONG THAT STARTED THE TALKING IN THE FIRST SINGLES, A BOP. “WHEN I STOPPED CARIING WHAT YOU THOUGHT”

**dirdbub** (10): honestly? a mood and a defining moment in my life

**Johnnytoby** (10): a timeless bop

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): my favorite first single by taylor. such a funny song that sets up the whole album, the indie record line is amazing.

**MrSwearword** (10): sure it’s corny, but this is Taylor Swift.

**musicotic** (10): Queen of amazing breakup songs

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): A true bop. She did that™

**Nfranklin50** (10): Whimsical vindictive fun what more do you want tbh

**PuggleMaster** (10): it’s so bad that I love this song

**Qwilphish** (10): The beginning of a new era. I bless Taylor for making the decision to go in this direction. The better Shake It Off

**RandomDKguy** (10): ICONIC IN EVERY WAY! Even in French and as fucking dope Rock Version

**skargardin** (10): Perfect marriage between country and pop.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): “Got another sassy song this time, it’s about a breakup and how I’m never gonna be getting back together with my ex. What do you mean that’s I Knew You Were Trouble? Fine. I’ll add some guitars this time. And a reference to indie music.”

**therokinrolla** (10): THIS WAS MY JAM WHEN IT WAS ON THE RADIO!!!! MY MOM HATED THIS SONG BUT DEAR GOD I SCREECHED THIS RIGHT OUT OF MY GAY ASS THROAT!!!!!!

**lady\_sable** (9.5): This is such classic Taylor. She's a master at making you feel her sadness and conflicting emotions.

**mdawgig** (9.5): Queen of fake voicemail messages.

**Piccprincess** (9): He didn't call me up. I called him up and was like "I still love you."

**poppinmmolly** (9): A BOP BOP BOP SHUT UP BOP BOP BOP

**supersecrettest** (9): This is my favorite of the Martin Tracks. I don't think it sounds dated yet, and I like the guitars.

**VodkaInsipido** (9): Another example of pop perfection. Maybe not as good as 22, but it's great anyways.

**CharmingArsenal** (8): cringy and catchy af.

**floofeh** (8): so fun and light and really a song you need to hear after a break up.

**henry413** (8): Making one of the most annoying song titles into one of the catchiest pop hooks is probably one of her greatest achievement.

**refrayn** (8): the BRIDGE ASJDJASKJDSL

**VeganSquash** (8): Queen of breaking up and being independent

**10footnotes** (7.5): Like… ever. I really enjoy the sassy, flippant tone of this song.

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): Okay, this is a bop. Top 3 Taylor song right here

**angusaditus** (7): I didn't really care for it but it is probably the perfect song to transition from country to pop, gotta give it that.

**jess\_22** (7): I used to hate this song with a burning passion, but now it's surprisingly good? I'm confused.

**Leixander** (7): This is EXXHAUSSTING you know?

**mokitsu** (7): a good single that is a bit obnoxious

**TeamAwesome4** (7): Taylor, every indie record is "cooler" than yours. Nobody listens to you because it's cool.  We listen because you're good, despite not being cool.

**zamomattel** (7): Literally sums up why I hated T-Swift back in the day, but upon reflection it is catchy

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): Taylor Swift's attitude actually works for this song, in contrast to Shake It Off.

**cyborglilith** (6): overrated

**skyblade79** (3.5): so tacky and cheesy, not cute

**Elitefourbrad** (3): This is just a pointless manbashing song that I don’t really approve of. This is extremely childish of Taylor to exploit her 70 boyfriends like this.

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** (3): invented white feminism

**eklxtreme** (2): it's very generic and the lyrics and production are incredibly lazy

**enecks** (1): This is obnoxious. The chorus is obnoxious. This is obnoxious in a very specific and vile way. This could be used as a torture method. This probably has been.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (1): This got my 0 in the 2012 rate but I don't wanna do the same song twice because I'm not predictable, it's still really bad though

**BreezySeason** (9): Queen of getting drunken off your tears

---
Nothing I could write could be better than this quip: "It is a triumphant Max Martin song about a feeling that, as The Awl puts it, is rather like diving into a pail of garbage, except to this boy the garbage is you." The production is kinda garbage-it's not actually dubstep, but it's definitely imitating dubstep-but the sheer rush of the song makes you not care about that at all. Much of *Kiss* is held back by half-assed concepts and execution, but TIGOY manages to feel fully realized and polished. Also it led to a collaboration between Carly and Nicki Minaj, which to me is just beautiful.

---
**Leixander** (11): Perfect production, decent lyrics and great delivery from Carly. What more can you want?

**luigi\_is\_better** (11): this really wasn't a very difficult choice for a 11. OLT was #2, but TIGOY is just pop perfection for me. the production is amazing and the lyrics are even better. just fucking great and possibly my fav CRJ.

**lulbady** (11): Objectivly this is probably not the best song in this rate but it has gotten me over so many not-quite relationships that i had to give it my 11

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): Why does everybody praise this song again? The hook is only decent and the production is awful. Especially that drop. Fuck that drop. Making the Most of the Night is way better than whatever this is.

---

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): Did LMFAO produce this? This is the most 2012 production I've ever heard, it's like Gangnam Style and Party Rock Anthem had an awkward baby. Carly's vocals on the song are actually pretty nice, but the production has dated really badly

**skiddos** (10): I love this song more than most of the songs on EMOTION, and that says a lot because EMOTION is amazing. The dubstep actually bangs. This deserved so much more recognition.

**superr\_rad** (9): i love breakup jams. this is the most modern sounding song on the album for sure, this was when drops were just kicking off and this is better than anything the chainsmokers have released...

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the lyrics and Carly's vocals but it just reeks of the dubstep phase of 2012. If it didn't have the weird ups and drops, I would definitely give this a higher rating. I would love to see this song re-done with different music.

---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Remember that random ass Nicki Minaj collab remix?

**agentofscranton** (10): it might not be as good as 90% of EMOTION but it's one of Carly's best and the Nicki Minaj remix is so fucking good too

**nooodisaster** (8): Nicki Remix = 11

**Joebiekong** (10): I want shawns YOGUHRRRRRRRR (if only we were listening to the remix)

**rickikardashian** (10): Underrated bop. [Also I hope you know there’s a Nicki Minaj remix of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1grvS5gbd0)

**supersecrettest** (9): Ok but why did we get a Nicki Minaj remix on this?

=====

letsallpoo: **cloudbustingmp3** (10): QUEEN OF DROPS! QUEEN OF DESTROYING MY ASS!

**dirdbub** (10): god yes!!! I love crying in the middle of the dancefloor!!!

**enecks** (10): This is good enough to be in Emotion. What a good pop song.

**henry413** (10): Should be the third single, but oh well.

**lexarqade** (10): I wish the chorus was a bit less harsh but I'm popping my pussy regardless.

**mokitsu** (10): dated banger, who needs RAWMe when we have this

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): YES. Just yes.

**OwenKam50** (10): rrrr cock that revolver rrrr rrrr

**rickikardashian** (10): Underrated bop. [Also I hope you know there’s a Nicki Minaj remix of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1grvS5gbd0)

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): probably my biggest guilty pleasure of literally any song ever what a masterpiece

**skargardin** (10): An amazing track through and through. I had forgotten how good that drop is.

**SpanKKy1** (10): a banging thot anthem

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Sugar Rating: A Walking, Talking, Human-Sized Gummy Bear

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): wow this is a masterpiece I am beginning to understand why y'all worship her

**therokinrolla** (10): MY JAW DROPPED AT THE DROP and if that does’t deserve a 10 than nothing does ( other than Lust for Life on itunes Now!!!)

**mdawgig** (9.5): Pure ecstasy in a song. That production is just fire.

**CharmingArsenal** (9): The crowd went nuts for this when I saw her live. Wigs were flying in all directions.

**cyborglilith** (9): EDM carly shall make a glorious return soon

**Johnnytoby** (9): another timeless bop go karly

**OberionSynth** (9): HOLY SHIT THAT DROP HIT ME LIKE A SHOT FUCK ME UP CARLY

**Qwilphish** (9): So explosive, love the energy in this song.

**supersecrettest** (9): Ok but why did we get a Nicki Minaj remix on this?

**twat\_brained** (9): A lovely breakup bop. I didn't appreciate this enough back in the day. Also, Max Martin is EVERYTHING on this song.

**awryj** (8.5): Calvin Harris who? David Guetta who? Carly invented obnoxious 2012 beat drops

**musicotic** (8.5): Catchy af

**wailordfan** (8.5): This song could've easily fit in EMOTION, and honestly it should have to get rid of a couple of the lesser tracks on it.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): it was a 10 until the drop

**jess\_22** (8): well this goes tf off

**RandomPotatos** (8): this was like a pre-emotion jam

**zamomattel** (8): Very much a product of its time

**eklxtreme** (7.5): the production feels pretty dated but her vocals are nice in this

**lady\_sable** (7.5): Cute

**bluehxrizon** (7): im surprised seeing this was produced by Max Martin as it has some of the weakest and most dated production on the album

**johnazoidberg-** (7): I feel like they played this at The Anvil shortly after Homer Simpson left

**MissyBee37** (7): This song shows what a good singer she is. I don't love the chorus but the refrain is great!

**MrSwearword** (7): did she write the lyrics while “drunken” off of tears? Goddamn I hate this album. [I suppose she did try here]

**Piccprincess** (7): Me, when I woke up the morning after I posted "I Almost Do" on Facebook and tagged my ex.

**refrayn** (7): fun but sara bareilles (ft ryan tedder my daddy) did it better

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Yeah, I get it, Max Martin is a great producer and all but this is filler.

**10footnotes** (6): The prechorus is good, but the actual chorus is a bit of a letdown.

**chili\_jones** (6): it just sounds so dated i can't do it

**ComeOnAndSlang** (5): never understood the appeal for this song

**dropthehammer11** (5): Average club song

**Elitefourbrad** (5): Carly brings some Emotion to this song. I hate the production on the whole song though, does not match the tone of the song at all.

**RandomDKguy** (5): unexpected club banger

**strawberryswing1** (5): damn that drop transported me back to 2011 for a minute

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (4): should not have been a single should not have been a single

**Magic\_warlock0-** (4): Like the message of unrequited love, but the beat and chorus are distracting. Hard pass

**VeganSquash** (1): the one thing I hate are mushy-gushy self-empowerment anthems...

[/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dnf7bqe/]

=====

SimplyHaunted: Sure it does. 

Recent events, especially after something so tragic like that horrible terrorist attack, leave people feeling more sympathetic and popheaders more likely to give it higher scores. When Ari re-released it as a charity single, it set a new peak at 2 on the UK Singles Chart. Besides it being a great song, it was the last song from one of her albums that she performed at the One Love Manchester benefit concert. Sadly, it's become one of, if not, the most defining moment in her career.
[/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dnf9maz/]

=====

qtsarahj: I mean I guess, but I feel like we're supposed to rate the songs based on how much we enjoy them and not really because of stuff like that. Except I did give it a bit higher because I didn't want to be shamed hahaha. I don't think it's the best song in the rate so I don't think it should win, the Manchester thing is unrelated. 
[/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dnfbdxf/]

=====

SimplyHaunted: Yeah, peer pressure is real in this situation. I think the majority of pophead users don't want to seem like they are lowballing a song that's sort of become equated with honoring the dead and staying united in the face of such terrible adversity. I'm sure there will be a few who rate it based on what you're saying but I would be very surprised if OLT didn't make it to the top 3.

Would Party in the U.S.A. have become such a major hit if it wasn't for the killing of Bin Laden? Would Taylor have done better in the first rate if it had taken place before snekgate? We'll never know but context is always important

[/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dnete0k/]

=====

blue_heart_: Call Me Maybe would be hilarious but unlikely.

All Too Well is a ballad and we all know how that ends here 😒

One Last Time might be the most likely, Taylor's best chance imo is State of Grace or Red.

RandomPotatos: Potential #1's for each artist:

Taylor - Red

IKYWT is not liked well enough, State of Grace and All Too Well are too ballad-y


Carly - This Kiss

Call Me Maybe is obviously too polarizing


Ariana Grande - Love Me Harder

One Last Time was most likely sabotaged out of her singles, Problem is not a strong enough song, and Break Free is easy to criticize lyrically

[/r/popheads/comments/71zmfb/the_anniversary_rate_reveal_day_2_another_20_in/dneuci4/]

=====

InfernalSolstice: YES

I'm not a huge Taylor fan either. I like the Fearless singles, I enjoy Red (more with each listen, Begin Again is ome of my favorite songs ever though) and everything else is pretty much a pass (though the Reputation tracks so far are guilty pleasures), but Speak Now is country-pop perfection. Back to December is probably the most quintessential song from the album. At least listen to the singles (the ones you've heard plus Back to December, The Story of Us, Sparks Fly, and Ours). I also love Speak Now (song) but that's not necessarily one of the traditionally loved ones.

deleted: haha cool! maybe I won't because doing that will bring in obvious bias. but I do want a lot of participants. I'll think about it.

InfernalSolstice: I mean if you advertise equally in all subs there shouldn't be an issue

kappyko: my main issue is that the /r/coldplay sub is easily the most active and would def bias the votes one way or the other. i'd rather the rate be limited to popheads folks

deleted: Yea I think you're right I don't think I'll go through with it then

Seeing other rates get less than 20 participants makes me sad

deleted: yeah I decided against advertising my rate to any of the subs dedicated to the women involved since you'll just have stans trying to rig the results for their fave to win. I just wish this sub would be more open minded to artists outside of Carly/Ariana/Taylor/Beyonce/Gaga/Rihanna/Katy/Britney because these Madonna, Janet and Mariah paved the way for all of them and deserve appreciation and respect.
