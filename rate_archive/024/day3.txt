It's finale time! Who will somehow, through the sabotage and the stan fights, emerge triumphant? Let's find out.

* The countdown will begin at 2pm EST.
* I'll be revealing all of the songs from #10 to #1.
* The average score was **7.0627**.
* The average controversy score was **2.1006**. 
* Follow along live in [our plug.dj room](https://plug.dj/popheads/) if you can!
* Remember that this is all for fun! It's okay to be messy, but be nice to each other.
* I'll be revealing the winner of Miss Songeniality before revealing the winner and runner up. You can still vote [here](https://goo.gl/forms/R9xRAhpdIwwK3rt93).

ThereIsNoSantaClaus: This is a rate where we're ranking arbitrary numbers people give songs.

This is not the place to be joking about a bombing where 23 people lost their lives because your favorite song got out.

There is going to be absolutely zero tolerance for this for the rest of this rate.

deleted: Also can I just say how shitty it is for people to say shit like " Manchester doesn't make this song good." It's totally fine to dislike a song, but bringing up that tragedy in that way is disgustingly disrespectful.

Holy shit is the production dated—dubstep truly was the weirdest trend to make it to the mainstream—but the song is still great. It's energetic but dramatic in ways Taylor had never been before and hasn't really been since, and even if it sounds terrible nowadays I do think her use of dubstep was one of the better cases in mainstream songs. The music video is basically the gentrified version of "We Found Love" but the song does enough of the emotional lifting on its own. I understand the ire about the song, but I still love it.

---

**raicicle** (0): The tune itself is pretty catchy and hard to fault, but the production is honestly so dated. Worryingly, it was dated even when it came out. Also, she’s kinda off pitch-wise on both high notes in the drop, which unfortunately doesn’t help the comparison to all those goat memes. I appreciate a good experimentation in genre, but this feels like a very unconvincing surface lick of paint, rather than a full embrace of the spirit of experimentation, which is what the score’s mostly for.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (0): I don't remember liking this song when it came out, and like most 2011-2012 songs with a dubstep drop it hasn't dated well at all over like the first year it was out, much less the 5 years after. This isn't exclusive to Taylor, and kind of disappointing because while I hate 1989 it hasn't really dated badly because it had a sound that doesn't really date because it's vaguely both throwback and modern enough to not sound like part of a trend. It feels like Taylor has the knowhow to know sounds that are gonna date well, but this was a huge misstep. Even the other stuff on this album is very singer-songwriter guitar pop which doesn't really date badly cause it never goes away. Anyway, I hate this song. The goat version outsold.

---
**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): “WHEN YOU SAW ME DANCING” idk, I still like it, some will say the drop aged badly but imho it’s good. “I think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories. It just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen It's not really anything he said or anything he did. It was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again. But I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright. But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me, I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me”

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Okay so I have a story with this song and I’m gonna keep it brief because I’m sure this is one of those songs EVERYONE has a story with. I make a lot of references on here to boys and heartbreak and stuff and the long and short of it was that when I got to college I met a guy and a girl, we three became best friends, both the girl and I developed a crush on this same guy, he dated me, he left me and broke my heart into a million tiny pieces. Yeah, first boyfriend and all that. So basically he starts dating a girl like 2 months later and they’re still together and he and I aren’t really close friends anymore, nothing like we were before. It’s sad and all that but I’m in a much better place about it. However fresh after it happened, I was driving my friend home (the one who’d had a crush on the guy too, we live together now) and we were talking about it and I turned on the radio and this song started playing and even though we were almost at our house we took a detour and just drove around the neighborhood screaming with Taylor Swift. It’s a moment in my life that I really treasure, and I’ll always love this song because of it. I have my mixed feelings towards Taylor Swift, but sometimes she just gets it like nobody else does, and of all her songs this is probably the one that’s the most special to me because, well, it’s so relatable to me. Join the club I guess.

**johnazoidberg-** (9): FINALLY a song that doesn't sound like every other first pop album by a pretty white girl who can play guitar. Bonus points for not having the spoken word poetry intro on the album. I can actually forgive the wubstep on this because this song gave us emes, it gave us digital dancing, and it gave us Taylor Swift as something other than a blonde with a guitar

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I actually thought this was a really good song until somebody on this sub pointed out how bad the dubstep is in it. And, looking back, that person was right. The dubstep is really bad. But the drop isn't completely terrible, and despite the track being a bit messily made the concept of Taylor Swift doing a dubstep breakup song just works so well for some reason. There's a reason why 'lying on the cold hard ground' became a meme, no?

**rickikardashian** (9): When this was released, this was a 11, and it’s still an amazing song, but the really harsh electro dubstep sound is just now so outdated that it makes the song feel a bit tacky. The song is still saved by the amazing production and the lyrics ~~and how hard it goes~~. [This song is still the GOAT tho](https://youtu.be/-aLYvZ5sX28)

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Max Martin back at it again with the hits! And what do you know? He made Taylor Swift listenable and club-worthy! It's things like that why he's my favorite songwriter. I find the video incredibly pretentious though.

**10footnotes** (8): First of all, what intern messed up and put a period at the end of the song title on Spotify? More importantly, I don’t think this song is as bad as it’s sometimes made out to be. The drop is a little dated, but the rest of the song holds up, and it’s still a bop. However, I can understand why people don’t like it. (Also, I’m already anticipating the goat shitpost).

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I really bop to this back when the song was out and I still do but unfortunately, this song did not age well. The entire production basically screams 2012 EDM and it's the main reason why the song was quickly dated for me. Such a shame because on the lyrical side, Taylor still managed to make this song feel like it's hers even though it's a Max Martin produced song.


---

**Leixander** (10): Goat remix would get my 11 tbh.

**SpanKKy1** (10): tmb to screaming goat remixes

**floofeh** (8.5): Of course we all laughed at the goat meme, but the song was great at using the distorted dubstep beat to give a chaotic and distorted mood that perfectly fits the lyrics.

**lexarqade** (10): I remember this being a pleasant surprise when it was first released. Queen of screaming goat edits.

**enecks** (1): Taylor knew she couldn't be the GOAT like Kanye, so she made her vocals sound like a goat in this tragic mess of a song.

**mokitsu** (5): iconic goat memes

**VodkaInsipido** (8): still hate the goat screams

**strawberryswing1** (9): NEVER FORGET: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gxPgU2-ih4

=====

letsallpoo: 
**animefangrant62** (10): Iconic Moment = Taylor singing “she never loved me” instead of “you never loved me” at the iHeartRadio Music Festival 2014.

**BionicFunhouse** (10): The only song on this album I love.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented dubstep!

**cyborglilith** (10): OVERRATED BOP

**dirdbub** (10): yeah okay, true,

**Elitefourbrad** (10): The bop about Jake or Harry, whatever it’s a great song. Literally queen of dubstep, Garageband is shook.

**Johnnytoby** (10): i love dubstep

**MrSwearword** (10): one of her best songs.

**musicotic** (10): I'm lying on the cold hard ground 😩

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Best song on the album. This was my third-favorite hit of 2013. Like the fact that Taylor just did an dubstep drop in 2012 was a huge shock, but it payed off completely. And this is her second-best, after Style. Fight. Me.

**Nfranklin50** (10): Alot of the songs on this album I didn't appreciate until I experienced them.

**piplup123** (10): deserved #1 tbh

**PuggleMaster** (10): a song tbh

**Qwilphish** (10): A major bop that came out of left field for me in 2012 when Taylor Swift was never on my radar. That chorus is so good, really just a big 1989 tease.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this song is gay

**skyblade79** (10): The best song on the album by far. It’s an amazing pop song and it is one of the few songs that combines pop and dubstep in a way that doesn’t sound like total garbage. Everything about this song is actually really great.

**Piccprincess** (9.5): This song is about Harry right guys? Right? Right?

**Magic\_warlock0-** (9): Probably the first song I ever heard off Red, and this caught my attention. Beat is on point, solid lyrics and a little introspection into how Tay-Tay felt!

**mdawgig** (9): Sounds a bit dated. But it's so catchy that IDGAF.

**OwenKam50** (9): iconic

**skargardin** (9): If it weren’t for the screaming in the chorus this would’ve gotten a ten as well.

**supersecrettest** (9): As dated as it sounds, I still love this song.

**zamomattel** (9): The best song on the album even if the bridge is lowkey trash

**henry413** (8.5): The memes are amazing.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Whatever you think of it, it's undeniably a catchy song and a good transition song to pop Taylor.

**CharmingArsenal** (8): It's a bop. but unfortunately I can't get a certain goat out of my head.

**eklxtreme** (8): produced nicely and it has a catchy melody

**jess\_22** (8): this would be a 10 but the bass drop sounds super dated

**lady\_sable** (8): While this song hasn't aged as well as some others on the album, it's grown on me a lot since it first came out. It's honestly iconic tbh, queen of goat memes.

**OberionSynth** (8): skrillex who?

**superr\_rad** (8): everyone hates this song and i know its kind of a product of the times but i still love it and relate to it so much. the memes took hold of her and still didnt ruin the song for me,

**therokinrolla** (8): who knew that taylor could also rock EDM?

**VeganSquash** (7.5): a repetitive bop

**angusaditus** (7): I had this on repeat when it came out. I was shook at Taylor's pop girl antics and I was loving every second of it. Now I always skip the song and I don't think it really fits on the album, but it gave Taylor a good transition into being a pop girl, and for that it deserves a good score.

**awryj** (7): I'm torn on this one. The heavy dubstep/electro drop and the snappy poprock verses just don't fit together, but on the other hand it gives me that sweet 2013 goat meme nostalgia and it's really catchy so I dunno.

**dropthehammer11** (7): A bop. One of her best songs imo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): “Okay, team, I heard that song about terrifying monsters and happy pixels by that Skill Rex guy. I want a song like that, except more annoying. Can we do that? Sweet!”

**treesoutsidemywindow** (7): That period at the end really irritates me

**fifthchevron** (6): This isn't about Harry, the album dropped before they even dated. Anyway, this song slaps. "You never loved anyone or anything" really cuts to the core of dysfunctional relationships.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): What was the point of the dubstep

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (5): Good lyrics but the trendchasing sounded desperate then and worse now.

**skiddos** (5): The dubstep production doesn’t hold up well.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): is the hook memorable and catchy as fuck? yes. do I sing along when it comes on? sometimes. does that mean this is a good song? no.

**TeamAwesome4** (3): Name the person who can sing this better than Taylor.  If you named "literally anyone" you're correct.

[All scores](https://pastebin.com/ya1yxjvz)

**BreezySeason** (9): Queen of cheating (but its something she can't resist)

---
Back in like 2012 when "Call Me Maybe" was dying down on the radio, Ms. Jepsen decided to pump this out as the second single and my weave instantly went into orbit. A perfectly produced disco track that unironically rhymes with the word "detrimental"? Sign me the fuck up. It was the moment I realized that Carly was amazing, and when this inevitably flopped was the moment I realized that there was no God.

---

**mokitsu** (10): queen of cheating!

**rickikardashian** (10): Queen of cheating

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of lowkey making an anthem about cheating

**twat\_brained** (10): Queen of infidelity

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): One of the more nuanced songs on the album. One of my issues with Carly is that her songs tend to be very shallow, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing because she’s just a girl who wants to sing about love, but it’s nice to see her write something that’s really examining a feeling, something with a bit of conflict to it.

**Elitefourbrad** (9): This song is actually really relatable to me whenever I’m around a hot guy. But sometimes I want more than This Kiss and more of “getting down to business” with the Call Me Maybe guy.

**10footnotes** (6.5): Aggressive production as far as Carly songs go, but I like it. It makes this song stand out a bit from the others on the album. (Edit: After listening to the full album, which reuses this production multiple times, I'm no longer as impressed.)

**Magic\_warlock0-** (10): First time I'm hearing this, this is a very strong candidate for being her best song off the album. I really like the the struggle that CRJ's narrative is bringing up; liking someone but knowing who they truly are. Love this

---

**lexarqade** (10): Faith Hill is shook. I forgot how much this fucking smashed.

**johnazoidberg-** (9): Faith Hill who? Carly is at her best with music that could have worked in the 80's and this song is wearing fucking leg warmers.

letsallpoo: 
**Johnnytoby** (10): deserves a grammy

**lady\_sable** (10): omg I love this. The production reminds me of Emotion.

**Leixander** (10): Surprised this didn't become a hit back then. It is better than CMM.

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): un•de•ni•a•ble


**mdawgig** (10): A straight-up slice of 80s pop. Delectable.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this song is so fun my favorite thing about this album i just how it has the perfect amount of playfulness and this kiss is the best example

**superr\_rad** (10): this was a ten the second i heard those synthy noises, how is this noise even made? i love it, queen of kissing, queen of synthy noises

**awryj** (9.5): that's a boppo

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.5): Definitely the 'Run Away with Me' of Kiss due to how underrated the song is as a single. At least This Kiss charted in the Hot 100!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): I do like how this sounds like a song that would lead into Emotion.

**nooodisaster** (9): THIS is what I'm talking about! It's catchy, lyrically interesting, and impeccably crafted. Queen of making infidelity anthems.

**refrayn** (9): ANOTHER BOP

**skargardin** (9): A cute, catchy bop.

**supersecrettest** (9): Why did the world let this flop?

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): The production is nice and slick, I'm fuckin with it

**eklxtreme** (8.5): I love how the synths and guitar in the chorus sync up with the vocals

**henry413** (8.5): Break Free but with better lyrics and production. Still think it shouldn't be the third single though.

**zamomattel** (8.5): This is such an 80s bop

**CharmingArsenal** (8): Admittedly Kiss is full of songs without much substance, but damn if you can't bop to every one of them.

**ExtraEater** (8): i'd rather listen to underrated deep cut \*\***fashion beats**\*\* by the top 40 billboard-charting black eyed peas

**musicotic** (8): Cute, but repetitive

**OberionSynth** (8): this is giving me like E•MO•TION™ vibes i love it

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This sounds nice and all, but I can't help but feel like it's a Katy ripoff, honestly. Take out the electronic elements and it sounds like something off Teenage Dream. Still a good song.

**Qwilphish** (8): Cute bop. Sounds like it would fit in on the B-Sides. Sad that this was chosen as the sacrifice to the Call Me Maybe gods but it definitely sounds like its spiritual successor so maybe it was destiny.

**therokinrolla** (8): cute!

**dirdbub** (7.5): if you look up “this kiss” on Twitter it’s dead split between Teen Wolf stans and Kpop Twitter accounts

**MissyBee37** (7.5): This is super fun; I wish the lyrics weren't about cheating because it makes this forbidden love she's singing about sound so fun!

**RandomDKguy** (7.5): Kindda the album in general; OK

**enecks** (7): It's Carly Rae.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Sugar Rating: Triple Chocolate Cake

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): sounds very old-school, I like it.

**Piccprincess** (6.5): Calvin's kiss is something I can't resist

**reddituser206** (6): that beat is a steamroller. the song is flattened, Carly is flattened, my brain is flattened.

**skiddos** (6): She shouldn’t have released this as a single. It totally killed her momentum.

**skyblade79** (5): it’s okay I guess, super basic and generic

**MrSwearword** (4.5): I remember this song…showing off Carly’s ineptitude for live singing being somehow worse than her actual singing.

**BionicFunhouse** (4): I hate those high pitched synths. Who thought those were a good idea?

**VeganSquash** (4): background noise was grating

**cyborglilith** (3): I found out that this song actually charted! Too bad it doesn't go anywhere.

**blue\_heart\_** (1): I wanna miss this song

It's a great song, but let me say something. The similes are kind of stupid. Some of them work, but a lot of them are just weird. To quote Slant magazine:

>...the title track underwhelms with its train of similes and metaphors that range from pedestrian (“Missing him is dark gray all alone”) to overworked (“Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song”) to indefensible (“Loving him was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street”).

But moving on from that, this title track is a great introduction to the album, with its treatment as searing passion as an aesthetic quality, one that she paints onto the rest of the songs that follow. It's not a really innovative idea, but with the album I think she manages to make it interesting. And I love the glitchy stutter in the chorus.

---
**lady\_sable** (11): And now we've gotten to my absolute favorite song by Taylor. She takes the fairly overused concept of describing emotions as colors and makes it feel fresh, conveying how she felt in this relationship in abstract ways that allow you to really connect with the song. Then you've got the escalation of the song as it progresses (something of a trend in this album) until you get to that bridge that HAS to be screamed along to (bc im definitely not already scream-singing along to this song haha nope). Also the crossword puzzle line is a masterpiece fight me.

**skargardin** (11): The title track captures the spirit of “Red” in such a perfect way. I love every part of this song and among Taylor’s songs this will always be a favorite.


---

**johnazoidberg-** (5): Was this written for Target commercials? The problem with this song is that it could have been done by anybody. If I didn't know this was Taylor, I would've thought it was Cheyenne Kimball or any one of the other 12 teen singers MTV tried to make famous with a reality show. If you're still reading this comment, congratulations, you just thought about Cheyenne Kimball for the first time in 10 years

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This is another Taylor song I've been sleeping on! I can't relate to that famous quotation of hers about her songs being 'red', since she's never seen her experiences or relationships as being 'blue'. I get what she means (psychology and all that), but me and my partner both have blue as our favourite colour and we often regard it as our signature shade. That being said, this song makes me want to consider adopting red as my signature colour instead. The lyrics of this song are uniquely descriptive and surprisingly intimate, and while I understand why people may have been divided about its musical composition in 2012, five years later it sounds like an amazing song. It manages to combine pop, rock and country seamlessly in a way so beautifully that hasn't been seen since Shania Twain released Come On Over. (Did you give When your 11s in the Canadian rate, hunties?) Anyway, in my humble opinion, this is one of the best pop singles of the decade so far, and I doubt that'll change.

**10footnotes** (9): Like State of Grace, Red kicks off with a recognizable instrumental and immediately throws you into the song. From the verses to the choruses to the bridge, the volume and the instrumental are constantly changing: enough to be noticeable to the listener and keep them interested, but not enough to be distracting. I’ve sometimes seen people take issue with the lyrics to this song, and I agree that similes/metaphors can sometimes be annoying if they’re not done right, but I think Taylor executes them very well here.

**Nfranklin50** (10): The quintessential breakup song. every line is packed with imagery and similes and it's so bitter and remorseful and it all builds up to the last chorus where you don't even realize you've been screaming but once the song is over it's completely cathartic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): "Okay, I need a fast car for this song. www.google.com fast rich car. Hmm... Bugatti is too fast. Lexus is too poor. I could go with a classic car? But I need to let people know I'm rich but also humble... What sports car is fast but also has shitty reliability so I can slightly appeal to the masses… ah! Maserati!”

**zamomattel** (7.5): "And the Grammy Award for Album of the Year goes to..... R-andom Access Memories"

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): queen of communism

**Qwilphish** (9): It's country, but I like it? Queen of synesthesia, Lorde is shook

**fifthchevron** (7): This is a bop, queen of synesthesia. Is that a banjo?

**dirdbub** (8.5): everything is blue his pills his hands his jeans and now I’m covered in the colors pulled apart at the seams and it’s blueeeeeee and it’s blueeeeeee everything is grey his hair his smoke his dreams and now he’s so devoid of color he don’t know what it means and he’s blueeeeeee and he’s blueeeeeee

**OberionSynth** (10): halsey is shook

**Piccprincess** (10): I'm blue da ba dee da ba daa, Da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa

**RandomDKguy** (10): QUEEN OF THE COLOR RED!

**rickikardashian** (10): Halsey did it better

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): IMO halsey did the whole colors thing better but this song is still amazing :")

**gannade** (5): This plagiarized Halsey's "Colors" and then made it bad.

**henry413** (8): Queen of colors. Halsey who?

**VeganSquash** (8): I feel like this is a spiritual successor to Colors, but Colors is better tbh

letsallpoo: 

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): “SAG” omg I didn’t like this song when I first heard the album but as the time went on I started to love it and know it’s so good, like for real, also screaming the chorus at the top of your lungs feels really good.

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): my favorite song of the album and top 3 tay. amazing lyrics, catchy and just very fun. i just want to scream-sing this song every time i play it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): fuck off if u don’t like the auto-tuned “Re-e-e-e, Re-e-e-e-d” it’s catchy af

**MissyBee37** (10): My favorite example of Taylor Swift poetry. Just gorgeous lyrics. I love the rhythm of the verses and the smooth chorus.

**musicotic** (10): Fantastic country bop

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Yes, she truly did invent colors.

**piplup123** (10): I’m a sucker for this hook

**therokinrolla** (10): Yessss Taylor redefining the English language!!!  MEtaphors and similes that all makes sense and are thrown together in a well put together bop.

**Elitefourbrad** (9.5): She’s talking about how hard is it to love and miss a boy in this song, and it talking about Red, which usually means anger. The title track is amazing though, I literally have lived for this song for so long! I love Taylor’s mix of country/pop fusion on this album, a real bop!

**Johnnytoby** (9.5): really poetic

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I forgot how much Taylor can write some clever ass lyrics like "Loving him is like driving a new Maserati / Down a dead-end street." I low-key think the demo is better than the final song though. Don't @ me.

**nooodisaster** (9): Listened to this song for 3 hours straight once while writing a 3000 word essay, so yeah.

**TeamAwesome4** (9): The verses are awkward, but the chorus is more than enough to make up for it.

**twat\_brained** (9): Seeing as how this is Taylor's last country crossover hit, it makes me feel rather sentimental… I yearn for a time when she was "controversial" but not pettily feuding with others. Nostalgia hurts.

**cyborglilith** (8.5): bop but it feels like it's missing something

**mdawgig** (8.5): As much hate as the hook gets, it's still a great song.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (8): The verses got kind of old but the hook is solid.

**blue\_heart\_** (8): Taylor has the most gorgeous metaphors in this rate and even in this poppy song she manages to put a deep message across. Unfortunately, its rerelease in 2016 only made it to #8 on bubbling under.

**eklxtreme** (8): nice old Taylor vibes, sweet chorus vibes

**jess\_22** (8): invented the colour red

**PuggleMaster** (8): Mind Maze is better!!! The vocal effects sound very dated

**reddituser206** (8): fan theory: this is a response song to the classic country track "Blue (Da Ba Dee)"

**refrayn** (8): i initially rated this a 5 then later it came on and i absentmindedly sang along to it without skipping a word and realised i was a fool

**skiddos** (8): An amazing Taylor song that is full of bliss. Also, watching the video makes me want to see her live someday.

**superr\_rad** (8): some of the lyrics are really awkward, like "trying to solve a crossword and realize theres no right answer", but the chorus of this is so addictive. i also love when artists use colors as symbols for stuff. halsey is shook

**awryj** (7.5): I really like the lyrical imagery. The instrumentation is like equal parts country, pop and rock, which is cool too, pretty much ideal for the title track.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Good song except for the auto tuned RED-ED-ED-ED part.

**enecks** (7): I had a completely colorblind friend who despised this song.

**MrSwearword** (7): credit to her trying to put meaning to lyrics but the 2nd verse reads as mixed metaphors and trying too hard to write anything poignant.

**dropthehammer11** (6): This is a listenable country pop tune. Not bad

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6): The titular song kinda falls flat. Definitely hearing a good beat, but it's just kinda fluff. Hearing that Re-e-e-ed echo is irritating

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): not a song I want to come across ever again.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): what an odd song this song doesn't know what it wants to be

**skyblade79** (3): Never was a fan of country rock and these lyrics are really lame, especially that “re-eee-eee--d”

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3): country music is why Trump won

**mokitsu** (2): annoying and repetitive

“I think [Quavo]’s misunderstood,” she says. “Just because I choose to be a socially conscious artist, and I’m pretty good at it, that doesn’t mean every artist is going to be equipped to be politically correct. I don’t think he’s inherently homophobic, I think he’s in a tough place of trying to explain what he means. I agree his apology was bullshit but I can’t police everybody.” When I suggest that one place she surely can police everybody is within the walls of her own album, she pauses. “Yes, I can,” she adds, “and there’s a lot of people I wouldn’t put on my record. Iggy Azalea: absolutely not. She had a complete disregard for black culture. Fucking moron. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.”

---
**VodkaInsipido** (11): Objectively the best song in here. Like, there is no discussion. It’s perfect from the smallest detail to the most obvious characteristic. Like, the production. Not like Break Free and its EDM, it relies on horns and an overall dance-pop production with some drums, but it isn’t completely electronic. It gives a throwback to the 90’s pop rap crossovers. Iggy offers the best verse of her career, ^^^^which ^^^^isn’t ^^^^much but it still is a good verse. Ariana also gives a great singing, not as crazy as say Greedy or Into You later in her career, but it’s great for what it is. And then the hook. The Big Sean whispers are BLISS, and you have Ariana doing a great R&B singing. It’s perfect. Don’t @ me or u/ me. You don’t have any song as good as this one in the whole rate. One of the best pop songs of the decade.

---

**dropthehammer11** (10): dings in the whip fam

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Invented Saxaphones. Invented whispering (Sorry Selena) Invented problematic rappers.

**lady\_sable** (10): That sax cleaned my water supply, resurrected my crops, and lifted the plague from my house.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): Iggy's verse is Not Good but Big Sean ASMR turns me on

**TeamAwesome4** (10): Iggy shows very rare competence. Ari kills it.

**MrSwearword** (10): Iguana should not be on the track, but this is a great song.

---

**MissyBee37** (10): This is such a solid pop song; that it peaked at No. 2 instead of No. 1 is a shame! Love the horns, the sass, the strong Ari vocal, Iggy's verse. The pre-chorus is gold. It's all so good. I love the concept, too, of describing being better off without someone as "one less problem."

**strawberryswing1** (10): Shout out to Ari using horns better than your fave CJR. Look Iggy is problematic but this song is a fucking BOP. Song of my 2014 summer along with Fancy and I’m not sorry about it. Also this is one of the few Ari music videos that doesn’t majorly suck.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (1): Hate everything about this song other than Ariana's parts. Iggy's parts have negative value added to the song. Would give it a zero, but like I said, it's not totally bad because of Ariana's parts.

**johnazoidberg-** (8.5): This song is an absolute jam. Ari's singing on impossible difficulty with tighter belts than that time you went on a first date and NEEDED to look like a skinny legend. You've even got some uncredited whispers from Big Sean, it's great And then Iggy Azalea comes in and ruins everything. This song hit number 2 and would have gotten higher without the Notorious F.A.K.E. making everybody want to snatch the aux cord. Bart Simpson has 2 rap songs and they're both better than anything Iggy's ever paid somebody to write.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): ahhh yesssss throwback to the summer between high school and college when I was still alive inside and the crippling depression hadn't settled in just yet :)

**luigi\_is\_better** (3): this is a good single but an awful song. i know that some people will just say that any criticism towards problem is because it was overplayed, but not really, it's just annoying. ariana is screaming, iggy is being iggy. and least big sean whispering is hot as fuck.

**wailordfan** (6.5): I don't get the love for the song tbh. The song did what Focus ended up getting dragged for by incorporating an annoying male voice during the chorus after a great build up, and to add to it, you LITERALLY hear Iggy's career peak in the middle of her verse.

**triptoyourheart** (8.5): Still that bop three years later but I used to use an Iggy-less version of this song back then so Iggy popping up is so uninviting since I couldn't stomach her back when she was everywhere so she dissolves 1.5 points off.

**CharmingArsenal** (8): I can't STAND Iggy. Docking a point just because of her. The song could easily stand on it's own without her, she adds nothing substantial.

**Elitefourbrad** (8): Ariana’s biggest hit to date, thanks to Iggy Azalea. The chorus falls flat in this song with Big Sean just whispering it and Ariana is nowhere to be found. A wasted opportunity for a better chorus.

**enecks** (8): This could be an 11 with editing. The thing is, the verses are incredibly joyous and catchy pop. Ariana gives a joyous performance. The whispery "One less problem" is weird, yet contrasts against the great bop. Iggy Azalea is thoroughly eh, but she blends with the song. The mixing kind of makes it feel a bit disjointed at parts.

**awryj** (8.5): It's one of these songs that will be present in every "2010s COMPILATION" in 15 years and everyone in the comments will be like "oh I remember that Twiggy Australia girl oh wait she was white? I wonder what she's doing now" and she'll be either doing some charity work or dead after cocaine overdose

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Okay, remember when I was being like "Please don't give Problem good scores cause it's dated"? Well, I have seen the light. I really don't know why I was super edgy about it. I still stand-by the song being dated due to the sax thing and I still prefer Break Free over Problem but this is definitely one of Ari's classics that launched her as a household name. [Still screaming that Wailord dragged Iggy when I was tweeting about the song.](https://twitter.com/wailordfan/status/900205958181392385)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I love Ariana, but this track is something of a disappointment for me. The whole “anti-climactic chorus” thing is actually kind of a turnoff for me, I’m not entirely sure why it’s a thing. I get why it’s used in this song, it’s meant as a casual kiss off, she’s saying this guy isn’t even worth that much time or effort. I just don’t think it’s particularly interesting. I adore Ariana’s big voice but she’s kind of shrill on this track and the dynamic shifts that the song makes are not very good. Having loud and obnoxious verses combined with a whispered chorus just didn’t work for her. Usually Iggy is carried by her features (she has a knack for finding good hooks and getting the right people to sing them, I actually do love a lot of her solo tracks but none of her songs without features really did that well) but surprisingly enough she’s the highlight of the track for me. Her verse is fantastic, one of my favorite verses I’ve heard in a pop song. I’ve heard some people complain that she quotes Jay-Z at the end, but I like that part of it, it was a subtle way to call this guy a bitch on the radio. I would have liked Ariana to get a Number One hit but I’m kind of glad this got blocked because this isn’t her best.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I think that this is pretty much the song that convinced the general public that Ariana has major talent when it comes to vocals. I remember hearing this song for the first time back in 2014, and by the time I got to the bridge I was thinking 'Wow, she has a really high range without sounding like she's trying too hard! This is really good. Hell, even Iggy's rapping isn't that bad. Even the dude randomly whispering the chorus that doesn't sound that bad. The only thing bad about this song is that some dude heard the saxophones in it and decided to include it on all of Fifth Harmony's songs. I kid. Maybe. It really deserved tobe her biggest hit!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): I remember hearing this song for the first time and being blown away by how much energy and momentum it had. I've never been so immediately struck by that pure pop magic. It's slightly dampered for me since then but I still think it's a great song.

**cyborglilith** (10): Ariana's vocal range is not comparable to the other two singers delete this Ariana-favoring rate plz thx

**dirdbub** (10): I don’t even mind the Iggy verse on this song, wild


**ignitethephoenix** (10): I forgot how much of a bop this is! Ariana's verses, Big Sean's whispers, Yes even Iggy's part is great (probably her best verse in any of her songs)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Even with Iggy this is a huge bop

**mokitsu** (10): imagine having your song blocked by the no-name flop charli xcx, poor ariana

**musicotic** (10): I got one less problem without you. Iconic line

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): whew ari’s third best song of all time

**OberionSynth** (10): I have no idea what ariana is saying half the time but I relate completely

**PuggleMaster** (10): Iggy’s best verse on a feature. This should’ve went number 1

**Qwilphish** (10): A smash hit for a reason. This song deserved to be her number one. The sax and bass are amazing, Iggy is surprisingly not terrible, and the whispers have Selena S H O O K. Perfection.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): hell yeah this is one of her best songs and iggy's verse is actually good

**skyblade79** (10): That sax… Iggy’s verse… Ariana’s voice… honestly, a perfect song. If the next song wasn’t here, easy 11.

**SpanKKy1** (10): Iggy's hot moment of success making every song she is in infinitely better

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): is it bad that i know iggy's entire verse by heart

**therokinrolla** (10): AAA okay so there was this one performance of this song that i would watch ALL THE TIME because of her amazing vocals on the chorus. I watched it multiple times a day and i really enjoy this song(and iggy’s feature)

**bluehxrizon** (9.5): it will forever haunt me that this missed #1, it was SO close

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): the sax on this is second only to RAWM also I personally don't usually like rap features but Iggy kills this one

**eklxtreme** (9): NOT dated. ari always has the best buildups to her choruses. the iggy verse is actually kinda hot

**lexarqade** (9): I hate that I love this but it snaps. Outsold Focus btw

**OwenKam50** (9): Bop, always has been ziggy iggs

**skiddos** (9): Hate that chorus but the rest of the song redeems it. Iggy's verse is her best tbh.


**zamomattel** (9): Ariana Grande, while tonight your verse from Iggy Azalea was certainly Fancy, your lack of a chorus was a Problem. You're safe.

**floofeh** (8.5): Ari sounds so cute and catchy here. Took a while to warm up to Iggy's part but it works.


**Magic\_warlock0-** (8): Very enjoyable, Iggy's rap actually boosted what would be a relatively tame song to a definite bop! Ariana actually enunciates well here!

**mdawgig** (8): A song so expensive-sounding that it couldn't be worse than fine; it's still very mind Teflon-y IMO. Girl really needs to enunciate better.

**reddituser206** (8): this song would have one less problem without Iggy. i wonder who else made that joke

**refrayn** (8): irrelevant but this song is so much faster than i remember

**skargardin** (8): Big Sean’s whispering was a choice to say the least. That’s what stopping me from giving this a higher score cause both Ari and Iggy slayed this song.

**supersecrettest** (8): This song is great, but I don’t understand the whispering on this or Focus, so ???

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I love the horns here and I actually don’t hate Iggy. What a great chorus too.

**twat\_brained** (8): I'm gonna put aside my anti-Igloo bias and say "I got 99 problems but you won't be one" is actually a pretty good lyric. It's a solid track that for some reason went #2, while "Into You" didn't even go top 10. 🙃

**blue\_heart\_** (7.5): I got 99 problems and this song is definitely one. Kinda live for the whispering though. Originally a 5 but I bumped it up because it grew on me.

**Piccprincess** (7.5): My comments for this rate are a problem

**SimplyHaunted** (7.5): i wudda gav dis uh ate if she sed duh wers poprle.

**10footnotes** (7): It’s interesting how this song was doing the type of mellow pop chorus that’s so prevalent now way back in 2014.

**angusaditus** (7): I love it for giving Ariana her career, I requested it at every party and I was so happy that it became the smash that it did, but I'd never actually put it on today.

**jess\_22** (7): love the whispered hook and Iggy doesn't sound half bad here

**superr\_rad** (7): theres so many little things about this i cant stand. like iggy, the kinda shitty chorus, her disconnected performance in the music video, that tragic choreo, her poor enunciation...but i still bop?

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): i've never cared for Iggy's verse or the whispered chorus, but it's a fun song beyond that

**gannade** (5): This song is a 1 because Ari is enunciating like a baby but I gave it a 5 for Iggy.

**animefangrant62** (2): It’s stuck in my head and I also never want to listen to it again. I think that sums up this song, it’s a parasite.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (2): I’m sorry but iggy’s verse turns me off

**VeganSquash** (2): there is a reason why this song didn't get #1

Around when *Red* came out, there existed a set of reviewers who thought it effective to consider her music as poetry. They typically would cite this song as evidence, and I can see why - its lyrics are beautifully written and filled with motifs and themes that all come together as a depiction of heartbreak. The best parts are in the details: the scarf, the photo on the counter, "we danced around the kitchen in the refrigerator light." And they all end up crescendoing into this searingly emotional, bloodletting bridge as the instrumental turns from café-core to arena rock. This song is hands down my favorite Taylor song, and an amazing representation of her strengths as a songwriter and a storyteller.

---
**10footnotes** (11): A good story is one of the things that I value most in life, and that’s why this song got my 11. Yes, All Too Well is a song, but it’s just as much (if not more so) an honest-to-goodness story with an introduction, rising action, conflict, climax, and (more or less) resolution. I might be a lonely person, but this song takes me through all the stages of a relationship and the experiences and emotions that come with them. Every line Taylor sings feels real (I’ve always heard the smile in her voice when she sings “We’re dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light”), and this is quite possibly her lyrical peak – “autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place”, “I might be okay but I’m not fine at all”, “You’d tell me about your past thinking your future was me”, “And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to”, and, of course, The Bridge (it deserves the capitalization, dammit). The first three minutes of this song slowly but surely build up to that moment when she belts “You call me up again just to break me like a promise.” Then the focus of the lyrics changes, and Taylor concludes by explaining how the guy remembers the relationship just as well as she does. The story is told so well – the structure, the details, the emotions – that you can picture the memories just as clearly as the two of them. No other song in this rate immerses me so deeply in its story, and that’s the reason I gave All Too Well my 11 and wrote this essay explaining why.

**agentofscranton** (11): Taylor’s magnum opus for a good reason; I use this song as an example every time a friend of mine argues that ‘Taylor’s a shit songwriter’ or that ‘modern music has no heart/emotion/blah blah blah’

**angusaditus** (11): This is the song I always show people when I am trying to convince them that Taylor's more than just your run of the mill pop girl. The way she managed to make the storytelling so captivating and so catchy, despite not having your average song composition really is remarkable. Furthermore, her delivery is one of her best, she really brings the story to life and it still gives me chills, despite having heard it countless times.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (11): “MAPLE LATTE” OMG THIS SONG MAKES ME CRY EVERYTIME, PETITION TO SWEEP TAY’S APPARTMENT IN ORDER TO FIND THE FREAKING TEN MINUTE VERSION OF THIS, LIKE THIS SONG UNGHHHHHHHHHHHH, FRIENDLY REMINDER THAT SHE PERFORMED THIS @ GRAMMYS BC WE ASKED FOR IT. also: https://68.media.tumblr.com/89b6947177972977eac9fb0b6e8e6c35/tumblr_ovdg1g9WRN1u9a5dqo1_1280.jpg

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): other people are going to write up more thoughtful commentary about this so i'm just gonna say she fuckin did that! she not only ripped off my wig but actually just straight up smashed my damn head into the concrete and killed me! carly and ari will literally NEVER reach this level of songwriting, and i'm saying that as someone who prefers both of them to Taylor

**Elitefourbrad** (11): Tbh to when the Swifties rigged the Popheads Chart to get All Too Well to chart on it. This is the best song on Red for me, it’s just a heartbreaking song that I can definitely relate to All Too Well.

**floofeh** (11): Both the lyrics and melodies have a wonderful buildup leading to a cathartic and emotional finale.

**McBawse** (11): I cried so this gets the 11.

**MissyBee37** (11): There was no question where my 11 was going. One of my all-time favorite songs. The lyrics are perfection. The way she sings the bridge. The bridge, period, is just incredible. Every bit of it. This song is a masterpiece.

**musicotic** (11): Fantastic song that makes me cry

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): I've heard really good things about this song, and now I'm totally getting its appeal! Taylor's lyrics here blow every other twenty-first century singer-songwriter's out of the water, and the song just gives an incredibly melancholy feel that makes me want to tear up. This is really good.

**poppinmmolly** (11): Taylor didn't go through all that for me to NOT give this my 11. This gives me all the feels. I have to mentally prepare myself to hear this song.

**RandomDKguy** (11): This song is everything. no not My Everthing, but EVERYTHING!

**strawberryswing1** (0): This song is a fine ballad but man, it is *not* anything special. It has one clever line. There are so many sad, nostalgic songs that accomplish the same thing as this one.

---

**NapsAndNetflix** (11): I was going to write a paragraph about how this is the perfect song but /u/wailordfan is a better writer than me and will probably link his university dissertation on it so I'll leave it for him to discuss

**wailordfan** (11): You guys already are expecting an assay, but I've posted 2-3 of them here on the sub at different times. I've literally submitted them as college essays. I fuck heavy with this song, and you guys kinda know it already.

---

**blue\_heart\_** (10): Release the 10 minute version Taylor! But seriously, another beautiful ballad on Red. I wish I didn't relate to it so much but it's been such a help being able to rely on it when I did. The saddest thing about becoming happy was losing the appeal in songs like this, and I'm glad I haven't lost this one.

**gannade** (2): I was expecting more from all the hype the Swifties keep giving this but it's a huge disappointment. This song epitomizes everything wrong with Taylor as an artist: conceited lyrics combined with a weak vocal, even when the instrumental is quite pretty. After listening to so many Taylor songs, I have to wonder why Taylor is always so quick to blame the other person for the relationship ending. I really want to try to be objective and not have my opinion of the artist as a person influence my opinion of their music, but it's really difficult with Taylor. When her public persona and actions depict her as pretentious and dishonest, and she releases song after song blaming her exes, it's just a bit much. A little self-awareness/self-humiliation goes a long way, which is why "Blank Space" is such a big improvement for her. Alternatively, she could also keep following the routes of songs like "22" and "Our Song," which are simply carefree and fun. To me, "All Too Well," along with the rest of the ballads on Red, is about an angsty girl mad at the world for not being as perfect as she wants, while simultaneously blaming everyone around her for not making the world as perfect as she wants. It screams immaturity. All of this could be forgiven if the song was a bop, but it's overall a snoozefest as well.

**superr\_rad** (10): taylor does this thing where she puts words together that are like so fucking relatable its impossible not to feel something. this is one of very few songs that have made me cry the first time i heard it and i still cant really listen to it casually. the song itself is crafted so beautifully and gracefully its kind of incredible

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The "So casually cruel in the name of being honest" lyric stings so hard to me recently because I had to cancel my toxic ex-friends that were harming the dynamic I had with my other friends. They were so fucking mean, manipulative and straight up sexist and racist. Among those toxic ex-friends I cancelled, this guy whom I shall refer him to as "Neil" for annoymous reasons was the worst of them all. So, fuck you Neil, you're the worst person I ever met you fucking two-faced asshole. And fuck you for calling my greatest best friend (hi Bubblegumbetch (not her reddit username) if you're reading this I love you) a whore to people I know and making up lies that you hooked up with her. Go back and watch hentai you fucking perverted loser. SWISH SWISH BISH!

letsallpoo: 

**bluehxrizon** (10): i wish we could hear that 10 minute version she had written

**BreezySeason** (10): I did this for /u/PM_ME_UR_FAVE_MOVIES

**chili\_jones** (10): the bridge :(

**fifthchevron** (10): This song has been praised to the heavens so I can't think of much else to say except W O W. There's a real fixation here with loss of innocence too, whoever this is about really did her dirty and made her feel used/jaded.

**henry413** (10): Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise. So casually cruel in the name of being honest. >>>

**jess\_22** (10): where has this BOP been all my life

**lady\_sable** (10): Taylor has some of her best lyrics here - notably during the bridge, w/ the "break me like a promise" line. She conveys so much emotion with her voice and lyrics. Definitely one of her best songs.

**mdawgig** (10): Evocative, warm, and sweet. The song equivalent of a pumpkin spice latte on the porch during late autumn.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I'd be a fool to not give this a 10.

**Nfranklin50** (10): Where does one even start with this song. Such a deep and personal song that just always has that magic. This is one of those songs you purposefully don't listen to so it never loses its magic

**Piccprincess** (10): Please don't call me up again, Jake. Oh, and give me my scarf back.

**rickikardashian** (10): That bridge is easily one of the best parts of a song I’ve heard. Lyrically the song is so beautiful and tells a story without sounding cheesy ~~watch it get eliminated like in day 1~~

**skargardin** (10): This feels so throwback and classic Taylor. It works so well.


**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): deserves an 11 but i only have so many of these things you know

**therokinrolla** (10): A strong contender for best song on this album(even tho nothing can touch State of Grace), Taylor shows off her lyrical prowess and combines her on point delivery. This is stunning

**awryj** (9): It's just so sweet.

**cyborglilith** (9): this gives me nostalgia even though it's my first time listening to it


**Leixander** (9): A little bit long but still really great. Proves over and over again that Taylor writes good lyrics.

**nooodisaster** (9): CALL ME UP AGAIN JUST TO BREAK ME LIKE A PROMISE

**eklxtreme** (8.5): nice sentimental vibes and a nice dynamic to make a sweet song

**zamomattel** (8.5): Country singer-songwriter perfection

**enecks** (8): Another good Taylor song.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Really like the lyrics on this. The instrumentation is a bit generic though, but it still sounds great.

**Johnnytoby** (8): wow Taytay is apparently talented

**refrayn** (8): “i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to” gets me every time

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): I saw people praising this in the rate announcement comments and I can see why. It's nothing mindblowing but it's the best song in the album so far.

**lexarqade** (7): It's missing something from me. I think this just went on too long. Who's the male voice as the background vocals?

**OberionSynth** (7): I can literally relate to none of this song but somehow I relate to all of it

**skiddos** (7): I didn’t get it at first and thought it was just a boring 5 minute ballad, it’s actually pretty neat and a good example of Taylor’s brilliant songwriting. Taylor not giving this a music video was a missed opportunity.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): “Okay, that last song was wayyyyy too pop. I gotta make this one really country now. Let’s just make this a Lady Antebellum song, alright?”

**twat\_brained** (6.5): *I won't remember it, it's far too loooooooooong…*

**CharmingArsenal** (6): For all the instrumental build up, I feel the song never really goes anywhere. And what is it with country songs and getting distracted by pretty girls while driving?

**luigi\_is\_better** (6): ok so i know that everyone and their mom love this song and i can't say that it's bad but begin again is a better version of this song. good, but not taylor's best.

**Qwilphish** (6): It's so long and even if there is a story I could not follow through it.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): Better than most of the songs with this sound on the album but I don't get the hype behind this in particular.

**dropthehammer11** (5.5): Why was this song so acclaimed? It's okay but boring.

**dirdbub** (5): Filler.

**johnazoidberg-** (5): The first time I ever heard this song, it was a video of her performing live and convulsing while playing piano and somebody edited in Ryu from Street Fighter kicking her in the face and it was more entertaining than this ballad about Jake Spellcheckinhal. This country-flavored pop album is doing a great job of reminding me why I don't listen to country

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4.5): I know this is one of the songs on the album that's super well regarded, and I wish I saw it. The build through the song is kind of nice, and I do like her putting some passion into the vocals, but the song is just not interesting at all other then that, and it goes on forever. It reminds me of 7 Years :deadbanana:

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): would've made a good duet

**skyblade79** (4): Rather boring country piece… I know this is a swifties fave and I already weighed my score a little bit just so y’all don’t complain, so don’t come @ me

**Magic\_warlock0-** (3): Please rename this All Too Long, could have ended and saved me my precious time. Boring

**PuggleMaster** (3): the vocals towards the end are shakier than The Weeknd singing live

**SpanKKy1** (3): and I thought Lana was the queen of making me fall asleep

**mokitsu** (2): WTF this is the song everyone hypes up? super boring, far from her best. "break me like a promise" is a terrible line, her voice when she belts is terrible!

**MrSwearword** (1): this song’s saccharine nostalgia porn managed to piss me off all too well.

**BreezySeason** (10): Queen of all the boys trying to chase her (popheads wishes)

---
Do I honestly need to say anything? It's a perfect pop song, it's the most obnoxious earworm of all time, it's the reason for Carly's career, it's the reason the GP doesn't take her seriously, it's compelling in its directness, it's vapid and pointless, it's the best song of all time, it's the worst song of all time—everyone has their own Hot Take on this song and nothing I say here will change anyone's mind.

As I wrote in the original rate thread, I stumbled on this song when an article was posted on ATRL that talked about how this little song by a Canadian Idol alum was a perfect pop song. The video has like 200k views or something, but I watched anyway and was instantly hooked. I sent it to my friends so they could laugh at how the guy turned out to be gay and whatnot, and then all of a sudden the song was a hit. I remember checking Billboard every week to see how high it could climb, and it felt glorious to see it finally hit #1. It was such a magical event to me and while I don't think this song is the best from *Kiss*, it's inevitably one that's stuck with me, and I'm not pressed that it's turned out to be Carly's highest for this rate. I hope we're okay with her bowing out at #5. She's won enough of these, anyway.

---
**gannade** (11): This song is probably the best bubblegum pop song ever made. I guess it won't win because this sub has trouble seeing greatness when it's right in front of them, but this is what pop is all about. Carefree, fun, cheery. Carly came out of nowhere in 2012 and shook the world. I have such fond memories when this and Gangnam Style blew up and became pop phenomenons. Those were some great days.

**johnazoidberg-** (11): It starts with violins to indicate that is song is a high art classic. This is the song that made me like pop music after hating everything just because it was popular until I was 21. This song made me grow as a human being. Carly, thank you for teaching me who I am as a music fan. I'll text you definitely, I get a little too socially anxious over the phone

**twat\_brained** (11): Essay time! There have been 3 iconic times in my life as a pophead where "Call Me Maybe" was a defining song. The first was when I saw Carly perform it while opening for Justin Bieber on the Believe Tour. (his last good tour :meghan:) Second was when I performed this live myself alongside my high school show choir team at the national championships, where we managed to win our division.🏆🏆 I also vividly remember blasting IRLY in my ears on the bus immediately afterward on my way to dinner. Also, I shit you not, a friend of our director's was a contact of Carly's, and she sent a video of us rehearsing it to Carly, where I remember hearing that she loved it. Validation from the sub goddess herself! And the third moment in which CMM was an iconic song for me was when Carly performed it as part of a concert for Canada 150 in a collection of iconic Canadian songs from the past several decades, cementing her spot in the Canadian music legacy. She also performed RAWM that night too ;) PS: If this wins, I will purchase this song on SingStar and record myself singing it for you guys

**agentofscranton** (0): if this song wasn’t overplayed/memed to death, and Carly wasn’t just the Call Me Maybe girl to the GP, maybe they’d be more willing to give her music a chance :/

**Elitefourbrad** (0): Overplay ruined this song for me. It’s honestly not that great compared to the rest of the album. We can blame Justin Bieber for the popularity of this song. I will never forgive this song for making Lights #2. I will never call you Carly if you give me your number, because I’ll be busy banging the guy in the video.

**MrSwearword** (0): I’ve been waiting for a while to give this shit the 0 it deserves. It is atrocious.

**musicotic** (0): I used to love this song, before the overplay

**triptoyourheart** (0): I HATE THIS SONG. Seriously fuck this song, it's so annoying and repetitive, why couldn't Run Away With Me be the song that had its success?

**wailordfan** (0): RAWM memed its way to the top last year, CMM will meme its way to hell this year. [*editor's note: it still beat your 11!*]

---

**awryj** (10): I remember the first time I heard The Song. I was 13, standing outside my school waiting for my dad to pick me up. In the distance, I heard a faint sound of strings, a melody I had never heard before, mesmerizing and spellbinding. However when I heard the song more clearly, I just thought "God that's annoying" and went away. Yeah, I hated it. But 3 years later I found The Light. Praise be unto Carly.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): [Intro] Ooh, yeah, yeah [Verse 1] I'm your basic average girl And I'm here to save the world You can't stop me cause I'm Car-ly Rae-Jepsen There is nothing I can do (to save my career) So just know that I am on my way (to flop and save the day) [Pre-Chorus] It doesn't matter where or when there's trouble If you just call my name—Carly's Flop Single! [Chorus] Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me When you wanna page me, it's okay I just can't wait until I hear my cell phone ring Doesn't matter if it's day or night Everything is gonna be alright Whenever you need me, baby Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me (Carly here, so where's the promo? Oh, right)

**superr\_rad** (10): the bop, the myth, the legend. this is one of the best pop songs of all time if we're being honest and technical. i remember seeing aggressive hate towards this song bc people were so frustrated that they loved it. this song contributed to my journey of loving myself and loving pop music and not feeling ashamed of that. i think a lot of us can relate to that feeling, and tbh i think that could be why so many of us cling to Carly but im not a psychologist so im probably talking shit. i seriously judge anyone that cant at least appreciate this song for what it is, a massive bop and 3/4.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I remember the day that this song turned 5 years old I was super excited and I told all my friends and none of them cared and one of them told me that the song was stupid and that made me sad. Not gonna say much about this one because I feel like y’all will say plenty.

**MissyBee37** (9): When I first heard this song in 2011, I thought it was a joke; and then my friend and I put it on repeat for the rest of our 30 min. drive and by the time we were done singing along, I realized what a gem it was and how much I actually genuinely loved it. Catchy, catchy, catchy. And honestly? Way more clever than people give it credit for.

**Qwilphish** (10): The definition of ICONIC. It's almost impossible for me to listen to this song for its musical merit because of how huge it was and how often it was played during that time. Obviously it sounds like a product of 2012 but it honestly still bumps and will always be met with chanting at karaoke. Probably the most perfect pure pop chorus of all time, it will be remembered in the coming years.

**skiddos** (7): I remember when this song came out in September 2011. I went to the zoo the same day CMM dropped in Canada, and I couldn’t stop listening to it. I’m not Canadian, but my sister was a huge fan of Tug of War era Carly. Eventually Justin Bieber heard CMM, and Carly went from being an indie singer-songwriter to being a bubblegum pop star. I was ecstatic knowing that she blew up. I’ll always have fond memories of this song even though I am a little sick of it now.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): Back when I was a disgusting straight I used to watch Minecraft parodies of this song and pretend I wasn't shaking my ass to the original

=====

letsallpoo: **AFlyingWhale\_** (10): THE OG BOP OF 2011/12 even if Carly is a one hit wonder at least it was a good one 🙃

**CharmingArsenal** (10): I wanted to give this my 11 if only because without this song we might not have gotten Emotion. I'll give it a 10 though, everyone and their grandma knows this song and everyone and their grandma sang along to this song at some point.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this would've been my 0 had this rate taken place before i saw her live, but something about experiencing this song in person made it click! it's just... amazing pop perfection

**dirdbub** (10): queen of taking the phrase “I love the gays” literally

**dropthehammer11** (10): WILL NEVER FORGET THIS BANGER

**emotionsidea** (10): id give it eleven cuz it Is the best pop song of this decade but all too well exists so like ..

**enecks** (10): This song is associated with some repressed memories. "NO I DON'T LIKE THIS SONG, I'M STRAIGHT I'M NOT A GIRL EW" I was wrong about all 3.

**ExtraEater** (10): deserved everything that happened to it


**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is a modern classic. It's an undeniably fun and catchy song, and I think that it hasn't aged at all (unlike the rest of the album essentially). Too bad Carly is only known for this song by the GP.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Meme, but still a good song

**lady\_sable** (10): Honestly legendary, and arguably a perfect pop song. While it's eclipsed by Carly's later output, it's still a very good, cute, upbeat song.

**lulbady** (10): Song of the century

**McBawse** (10): A completely perfect pop song.

**mokitsu** (10): a world dominating smash hit

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This is iconic. I know it, you know it. If you don't like this song, you have no soul.

**OberionSynth** (10): there are two types of people in the world, people who love this song and liars


**reddituser206** (10): sorry popheads, this is the best thing she's ever made

**rickikardashian** (10): When i was younger i found out about this song because of the video of a bunch of teen stars lip syncing it and i literally listened to the song at least once every day for an entire year

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i mean if you don't give this a 10 you are lying to yourself

**skargardin** (10): Pop perfection. What’s there to say that hasn’t been already said?


**supersecrettest** (10): No matter how many times I hear this song, it never gets old to me.

**TeamAwesome4** (10): Still killer

**VeganSquash** (10): anyone who rates this lower then a 10 is fake news

**VodkaInsipido** (10): Still a classic bop. Good production all around, a great chorus and it had pop culture impact. If Problem didn't exist this would be my 11.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): queen of bops but it's impossible to sing well without the backing instrumental

**henry413** (9.5): Pop perfection.

**SimplyHaunted** (9.5): I'm doing this rate really last minute, so I was going to skip songs that I knew really well and already knew my scores for. But then I heard the first line and went "WELP. Guess I have to listen to this now."

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I mean this is just really good pop; straight up. An iconic bop.

**zamomattel** (9.5): This video literally invented gay men though

**bluehxrizon** (9): a classic

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9): victim of overplay, but loved the song on my very first listen, which is rare

**eklxtreme** (9): it's a perfectly crafted pop song and it's success was very justified

**Johnnytoby** (9): an icon

**Leixander** (9): The track that made us know Carly. We owe Emotion to this cute and bubbly song. Thanks CMM! Keep making Carly money.

**mdawgig** (9): A bop. Nothing new can be said about CMM.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): fuck off to anyone ^(don’t make me tag you) *sabotaging* this song. this is such a harmless bop


**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Sugar Rating: Six Servings of Nutella

**TragicKingdom1** (9): Lauded as one of the best pure bubblegum pop songs ever, and rightfully so. Although the production sounds dated, in my opinion it contributes to the sense of timelessness behind the simplicity of this song. Purely whimsical, I'm glad this is one of the most iconic songs of the decade.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): invented Alexander Graham Bell

**luigi\_is\_better** (8.5): i cant believe carly invented non-flamboyant gay representation

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This is THE throwback song of this decade. The mixing is kinda bad and the violins are memetic in a bad way, but the melody is just so catchy. It's no surprise that this got stuck in everybody's head for at least a couple of months.

**lexarqade** (8): A diamond certified song! Not all of your faves can do that.

**RandomDKguy** (8): #BEST CHORUS OF THE 21st CENTURY

**therokinrolla** (8): i like these versus more than the chorus oop. Legendary, and it has the potential to go out day 1 or day 3, and it is going to be *really* interesting to see where this ends up. Its a good song, tho

**10footnotes** (7.5): I cannot WAIT to see the controversy score for this song. People are gonna be angry no matter what rank it gets.

**blue\_heart\_** (7.5): as much as I hate to admit it... it does bop.

**floofeh** (7.5): it's just insanely catchy and feelgood.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): This song is definitely a pop classic but there is no way in hell this song should do well in the rate. Please popheads. You can give Carly your 11, just not to this song.

**islimp** (7): As catchy as this is, there are better songs on the album

**Magic\_warlock0-** (7): Cute song, very catch and plays to CRJ's strengths: her charm, her cheer, and her solid voice. Lyrics aren't the best, but it's not too bad.

**nooodisaster** (7): Yes this song is catchy, but it's ANNOYINGLY catchy. Huge difference, and it makes me sad that this is all many people know of Godly Slay Jesus' discography.

**PuggleMaster** (7): it’s not winning this rate :suffer:


**skyblade79** (7): super overplayed, but it’s a bop regardless. Now if only I could make the 14/17 year old call me maybe

**BionicFunhouse** (6): I've never actually liked this song that much ngl. It's okay, but not my favorite.

**Piccprincess** (6): I hope Calvin calls me....maybe

**fifthchevron** (5): I'm only rating it low because I know it will get lots of tens and she has done SO MUCH BETTER than this. The only things I still love about it are the violins and the line "Before you came into my life/I missed you so bad".

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (4): memes MEMES m e m e s M E M E S, I feel like I have to explain myself, I once had a friend, let’s call her B, B and I were best friends for like 3 years, everything was amazing, flowers bloomed, summer was long and alcohol was good, Call Me Maybe was our song, we spent that whole summer singing it 24/7, drunk or not, then life happened and it turned out that B was in fact a controlling manipulative fake bitch, that’s why I hate this song, it brings back good memories that were fake.

deleted: Call Me Maybe has so many terrible things going for it on top of the spite I hold for her. 

It is as lyrically deep as a thumbtack, and as useful as one too. Catchy doesn't always mean quality, and it is especially true in this case. The shallow lyrics don't even make sense half the time. It is uninspired, tacky, and has ultimately no impact in modern music. It's popular, and was one of the biggest tracks of the decade, but it is so undefining for Carly that it hurt her career more then it helped. It ruined her career, it ruined our eardrums, and ultimately ruined the rate for me. 

So that's why it got a 0.

letsallpoo: # Kiss

---

[Album averages](https://pastebin.com/8Gy9Bn75)

**Overall average**: 6.843

---

**cloudbustingmp3**: obviously nowhere near EMOTION's level of greatness, but this is a cute bubblegum effort. it's gonna get hatejerked tho i can already tell 

**Damoojo**: Tbh, the album wasn't that great to me. 

**Cryomatic**: The songwriting and production quality on this album are bumpy at a lot of points on this album, but there are still several outstanding tracks. If EMOTION was a superhero, this would be its backstory - a pure-of-heart average civilian with secret outstanding potential, but at the same time, so few notable traits. 

**MrSwearword**: saccharine dreck on a terrible album with bad singles 

**awryj**: This album sounds so 2012 it's insane. Carly is great as always of course, but EMOTION is still the superior album - it's just more organic, cohesive and experimental. Still, it's fulla bops. Carly's fun and you can't deny it. 8/10 

**dirdbub**: well I do not remember any of that, 

**skiddos**: A lot of the production on this album sounds dated, and I kinda understand why this flopped. I still love you Carly! 

**JunkyGS**: This album aged so much better than I thought it would and actually enjoyed it a lot more now than when I first listened to it. Carly really knows how to write a pop song that will get stuck in your head and the production is pretty nice. It however gets pretty filler in the bottom 1/3 of the album sadly. 

**treesoutsidemywindow**: Sorry if my scores for Kiss seem very negative, but I don't find Carly's voice pleasant to listen to at all and all the songs sound very same-y, please don't lynch me 

**therokinrolla**: this album will have a lot of negative and positive bias going into it. A lot of what kept my scores above average was the production of the album. The production pairs really well with carly’s voice and songwriting, so it makes a lot of “pretty good bops.” sadly, bc of that, it kinda lacks what makes emotion great. 

**Qwilphish**: The push to get this album out really shows in some of these tracks. It's about as good as what I expected going into it. Not the worst album I've ever heard, but it's far from what Carly has shown to be capable of. Average - 6.6 

**enecks**: This album is kinda not a good album. It's better as a scattered mix of hints towards what would come, mixed with bubblegum of various flavours and amounts of having been chewed up. 

**TragicKingdom1**: I hadn't heard this before the rate, and I was surprised it wasn't that much worse than Emotion. Like, all of the A+ pop writing is on here, it's just buried under kind of dated, less polished production. I also think it's more homogenous than Emotion, so I would've liked if some tracks were cut, but overall a pretty good listen. 

**cyborglilith**: that album cover is TRAGIC 

**patronsaintofaspies**: This album was surprisingly decent until Hurts So Good. Then everything fell apart. Because of Bieber. Screw you, Justin. I really hope this doesn't end up dominating, LMAO. 

**Leixander**: Has 3-4 good tracks but it sadly has too many filler. 

**CharmingArsenal**: I want to stan Carly so bad, but even I can admit that while Kiss has some major bops, it is a bit inconsistent especially when you factor in the bonus tracks. But it paved the way for Emotion, so that alone makes it better. 

**Elitefourbrad**: I was expecting a great album, based off of Emotion, but Carly let me down. Horrible production choices and stupid lyrics ruined this album. 

**mokitsu**: excellent singles with mediocre non-singles, very clearly a rush job of an album 

**VodkaInsipido**: Has some good bops, but it drags a lot towards the end. 

**supersecrettest**: Ok after going through red which I don’t really love I’m so happy to listen to kiss. I love Carly so much. I discovered her off Call Me Maybe, and she was one of the first artists I would listen to when I got Spotify. I loved kiss so much for an 11 year old, and I was rooting for her success with her follow up singles, not understanding why This Kiss and Tonight I’m Getting Over You flopped. She was the first artist who I stanned for out of the mainstream, and when she released emotion I’ve been in love with all of her music even more. I love that she has a cult following in the gay/popheads community (Is there even a difference) and I’m just so happy for her. I love this album. 

**superr\_rad**: this is my first time listening to Kiss in full, and i dont know why bc i been knew carly is a pop genius. this album is pure, unabashedly bubble gum pop and its right up my alley. im so surprised at how little filler there is 

**reddituser206**: For a bubblegum pop album, this goes HARD. too hard. it's kind of exhausting, and the first break you get is a Bieber duet. 

**ExtraEater**: tbh in terms of filler pop with huge singles i'd rather listen to the black eyed peas' smash hit album the beginning & the best of the e.n.d. featuring platinum masterpiece boom boom pow and underrated deep cuts XOXOXO, Someday, and Whenever 

**ComeOnAndSlang**: starts off so well, but quality quickly starts of deteriorating. 

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU**: Carly's weakest album is still one that most artists would be incredibly proud to release. It's clearly rushed, pulling 3 already-existing songs, but it does have some great deep cuts, too. It's the closest to Kpop the west will ever get. 

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris**: This was way better than I'd thought It'd be. And I'm glad Emotion isn't a fluke. 

**SimplyHaunted**: This is the most I've ever listened to CRJ. I know I've been sleeping on EMOTION, but at least this album makes me slightly more likely to listen to it? This album was a little too teeny pop and disco-esque for my taste, but her voice is beautiful. 

**Piccprincess**: I want Calvin Harris to kiss me 

**floofeh**: Queen of wholesome music. In a music landscape with moody low energy music it is so great to have Carly. Especially this album takes me back to my youth of less worries and pondering about dreamy boys. A welcome distraction. I do feel that apart from the breakout singles (Call me maybe, Good Time) it is somewhat mediocre. 

**MissyBee37**: This was fun for me because -- please don't throw things! -- I'm new to Carly, and mainly discovering her because of this subreddit. The only songs I knew off this record before this rate were the singles. But I liked the album a lot more than I expected to, even if it a lot of it feels like filler to me. Several tracks surprised me and it's a fun, poppy album to listen to overall. It definitely feels young; it's shocking to me that she is actually older than I am and was in her late 20s when she made this record. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing! It makes for a fun bubblegum vibe. I was surprised by how good some of the bonus tracks are, some of which I like a lot better than some on the standard album. Overall, this album succeeds in one of the most important ways: It makes me want to listen to more Carly Rae Jepsen. 

**TeamAwesome4**: Objectively worse than Emotion, but bubblegum pop is my shit, so I barely even notice.  It hits the same heights, but doesn't have the depth. 

**henry413**: I know that it obviously can be compared with Emotion, but this album always has a special place in my heart bc it's the album that makes me like pop music. Also, it's such a perfect summer album (that is released on Fall lol) and I really think it's underrated. 

**rickikardashian**: The album is good, and full of cute fun songs, the problem is that I believe it’s way too long, and way too similar with each other so it ends up sounding just like the same song over and over again. This would have worked way better if this was an EP or if like ⅓ of this album was dropped. (Edit: Okay, I still have this opinion in the album, but it did grow on me with more time. I did give a higher score to songs i rated low at first) 

**Ghost-Quartet**: More than any other album I gave this one a lot of scores with a .5 qualifier because I couldn’t make up my mind about them. A rushed album, but not necessarily a boring one, I went into it expecting to hate it but found myself liking it quite a bit. I doubt that I’ll revisit it in the future but it’s a cute little body of work with some nice songs on it. Actually I was surprised by how much my feelings towards this album reflected my feelings towards this album too. I absolutely adored a few of the tracks and thought the rest were decent, if a little one-note, but on the whole I felt that many of them were somewhat interchangeable. I’m just not a huge Carly fan (personally I feel like she’s majorly overhyped on here) but she was on Broadway, so she’s chill with me.

letsallpoo: **BlasiFeelsSwift**: thank god she got better at music cause this sucked balls and not in a good way 

**twat\_brained**: I'm still waiting for my first. Any takers? 

**nooodisaster**: I hadn't listened to this before the rate, so I was really interested in seeing how it'd turn out in the shadow of EMOTION. After digesting it, I think this is a really cute album, and hints at the genius about to come, but just has too much filler. Considering how little time she had to make this, it's still impressive tho. 

**callmetidle**: This feels like the soundtrack to a Disney original TV movie 

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: I remember hyping this album up in the months before the rate and how it's an amazing album even though I know will be a full-on Taylor stan in this rate. Re-listening to this album, I realized that the reason why I praised this album so highly was because of the first couple of songs in the album. The middle parts of the album really did not match up at all and while the album (standard edition wise) started to recover itself in the last three songs, it's overall not the amazing album I hyped it up to be. Still, it's amazing how Carly still managed to record a decent album in a very short period of time but I am really glad she took her time when she was recording EMOTION, which would end up being one of my favorite albums even though I don't stan Carly that much. 

**Magic\_warlock0-**: First time I actually listened to the whole album. I think it’s the most cohesive of the three albums, and on the whole, really enjoyable. I found it hard to really drag any one song in particular, and I’m happy to say I found a few new favorites. The problem I see here, is that no song has any particular lasting presence. It’s an enjoyable one, but not great one. Still, very impressed with the whole production! 

**raicicle**: You get a real sense of déjà-vu listening to this album. Most of the songs are pretty much iterations on the same synthpop-via-bubblegum formula to varying degrees of success. At times, it’s inoffensive and totally forgettable but the album also has some incredibly brilliant takes on that formula. It’s not exactly the best pop album on the planet, but you get the sense that many of the tricks that Carly employs here and her jovial take as a whole on writing pop songs become a template for what she masters on Emotion, one album later. 

**blue\_heart\_**: An album quickly put out to benefit from a big hit, and that's the tea. I'll give Carly the benefit of the doubt and blame her label. 

**luigi\_is\_better**: What a good album. I was following CRJ because I enjoyed CMM so much so when it was released I listened and I really enjoyed it, even though people around me thought that it was dumb. I feel like Kiss is very underrated, even here, just because E•MO•TION is so much better and it's very dance-pop. But from time to time I put this on repeat and I'm filled with joy. 

**10footnotes**: This is like an entire album of filler. It's crazy the artistic maturation Carly had between Kiss and Emotion. 

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: justice for poppy :meghan: 

**SpanKKy1**: an inconsistent mess

Sorry Swifties, this is Taylor's exit for this rate. And what an exit it is: While it's evidently not the favorite amonst die-hard fans ("All Too Well" deserved better), "State of Grace" is just as incredible and likely benefited from being a bit more accessible. Why this was never released as a proper single is beyond me-to me it's such a more interesting blend of pop and country than the rest of the album, with those drums and that guitar and everything just piling on one another in one euphoric rush. And when it all cuts away as Taylor sings the title track—that moment still gives me chills, tbh.

---
**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (11): I had been a longtime Taylor Fan, and when I heard she was working with Max Martin, I was incredibly nervous. Then WANEGBT together came out, and my fears proved right. Luckily, State of Grace came out and I realized the album would be an exploration of all the ways her sound could go - and man, I wish she did this more. The production is absolutely killer - I never imagined Taylor Swift doing stadium rock, but this sounds so full no matter what quality you're listening to. Most importantly, though, she paints such a clear picture. When I hear this, it feels like you're standing knee-high in grass on a cold November day with a strong wind - you know something is going to happen, and you know it's going to be big, you just don't know what.

**Damoojo** (11): I have no words to describe how much I love this song.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): I really don't want to be cheesy but listening to this song again for this rate after so long, many of the memories during senior year when this album was released came flashing at me so quick and I was crying because I really forgot how much this song (and the album in general) helped me go through this rollercoaster journey as I was on my last year of high school four years ago. It was my best year of my high school life because most of it was shit, but I also made some cringey ass mistakes that time. I guess this song still struck a chord with me to the point of nostaglia. On the song itself, State of Grace is one of the best songs from Taylor and this song proved that she can do pop-rock if she wanted to, which is probably what I am looking forward from TS6.

**henry413** (11): A perfect album opener.

**Kaylaboe** (11): this is peak taylor

**nooodisaster** (11): This is how you take lyrics that are intensely personal and make them sound like an anthem. It doesn't just sound like her relationship, it sounds like all my relationships, and most importantly what I want my future relationships to be. I can't listen to this without feeling pumped up and affirmed, not just for love, but for life. This is a worthwhile fight.

**Piccprincess** (11): Such a beautiful song. She's really aware of the imperfections in the relationships, while acknowledging that she will never be the same person after him.

**therokinrolla** (11): this song is so perfect that i cant stand it. This is easily in my top 5 songs ever. This song> anything from artpop. Thats how you know im serious. The minor genre blending here is pulled off flawlessly. What about these gorgeous lyrics?: “So you were never a saint, And i’ve love in shades of wrong. But we learned to live with the pain, Mosaic broken hearts.” That is absolutely perfectly put. Its really something gorgeous. Perfect. Excellent. The chorus comes in and sweeps you away, so simple yet so perfect. The aforementioned prechorus to the second chorus spices things up, adds more depth, and its just such a lovely ode to… love. This song is one tha makes me want to fall in love, because taylor summarizes it so perfectly in this song. It is unexpected, it has twists and turns, and it *will* break your heart. But its worth it, anyways.

---

**agentofscranton** (10): this is my Manila Luzon of the rate in terms of getting my 11, does everything right, is honestly perfect in almost every way, it’s just that Raja/All Too Well is also here, and they are JUST that little bit better

**10footnotes** (10): This is an amazing album opener. It’s upbeat from the very first second – the guitar riff kicking in for the first time is one of the best moments of the album. Even though State of Grace is almost five minutes, it doesn’t drag, partly because of its upbeat production and partly because of its captivating lyrics (ex. the lines surrounding “mosaic broken hearts”). This song perfectly sets the mood and expectations for the rest of Red, and if I had a second 11 to give, it would go to this track.

**CharmingArsenal** (7): Nothing too exciting going on here, it's a little long and her voice sounds incredibly strained. This album is her transition stage from country to pop and she seems to be experimenting with her vocal range and what she can do, but I don't think she pulled it off in this track.

**blue\_heart\_** (10): This song has a sort of beauty about it I find hard to describe. I don't think the emotion it invokes can be described any other way than in its title; a divine state of love, the only word for which I find apt is graceful.

**Qwilphish** (10): It's a bold statement putting the best song of the album as its opener. This song is the perfect transition between her old sound and the sound she is trying out with Red so it makes sense to put it first. Her stroytelling is in full force and her voice is infectious. One of my surprise 11 candidates.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I remember being on a Pokemon forum way back when, and I vaguely recall listening to this song on one of the off-topic threads. I'm listening to it about five years later, and I'm realising how much I slept on it. This song *does* put you in a state of grace. It's just so warm and optimistic and reassuring and it makes me want to cry.

letsallpoo: 



**angusaditus** (10): This is such a perfect song, I wish I had more than one 11.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (10): “I LOVE YOU DOESN’T COUNT AFTER A GOODBYE” oh my lord, this song, this is my favourite song ever, I’m not kidding, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE, A PROPER SINGLE. “SO YOU WERE NEVER A SAINT AND I’VE LOVED IN SHADES OF WRONG WE LEARN TO LIVE WITH THE PAIN MOSAIC BROKEN HEARTS” OMG I’M DEAD RIP ME THIS LINE KILLS ME EVERYTIME OMG TAYLOR OMG DEAD DED RIP RIP DEAD.

**bluehxrizon** (10): a perfect blend of taylor's pop sensibilities and country roots

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): amaaaaazing opener. everything about it sets the tone for the album just right, and the arena rock vibe ended U2

**cyborglilith** (10): good intro

**Elitefourbrad** (10): One of the best songs Taylor has ever done for sure! A great choice to open up the album, with Taylor’s custom flare.

**enecks** (10): This sounds great and polished - the peak of pre-1989 Taylor

**fifthchevron** (10): The acoustic is what made me sit up and take notice of Taylor. So I got used to that version. The beat here doesn't work for me, the acoustic seems so much more timeless and emotional. These are some of her best lyrics, though.

**gannade** (10): This opener is a 10 but its 2 min too long

**lady\_sable** (10): This is often called one of Taylor's best songs, and for good reason. It's an excellent album opener, with this huge, anthemic stadium rock feel. Not to mention some of her best songwriting.

**Leixander** (10): The track that made music snobs like Taylor. Rock-influences and Taylor's delivery is perfect here.

**mdawgig** (10): I want this to be the direction for TS6, tyvm. Perfect and sweet and charming.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): such an iconic and impressive can opener from Ms. Swift

**Nfranklin50** (10): The one state Trump can't fuck up

**OwenKam50** (10): Not a moment without good lyrics, not repetitive at all

**piplup123** (10): wow she did THAT

**poppinmmolly** (10): I love the sound to this. This must have sounded amazing live.


**RandomDKguy** (10): THIS IS THE STATE OF TAY!

**refrayn** (10): cathartic as fuck, no matter what ur situation. perfection. taylor’s peak.

**skargardin** (10): The guitar, the drums. Everything about this is just so gigantic.

**superr\_rad** (10): what an opener. the drums are so hypnotizing, and the lyrics flow so well. something about this song gets me so hype,like youre about to be taken on an emotional rollercoaster

**VeganSquash** (10): its such a great song to start an album, I cant explain the feeling

**dirdbub** (9): what a sweet opener

**luigi\_is\_better** (9): a great start, amazing song but it gets repetitive after a while. the acoustic version would get a 10 easily so it's all poo's fault

**musicotic** (9): Good song, but I think it's a bit overrated

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): There's something so positive about this song, it's kind of incredible.

**OberionSynth** (9): fuck me uuuuuuuuup queeeeeen

**Raykel** (9): This brings me a huge sense of nostalgia. I usually hate that feeling, but this song represents all the good parts.

**reddituser206** (9): the "oh oh oh"s are responsible for like 2-3 of these points

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): "Hey guys, I just discovered this album The Joshua Tree by this little band called You Too! I'm gonna write a song just like one of those, maybe I'll even get them to open for me on my Red tou- what do you mean they're bigger than me? What does that mean? Is that even possible?!"

**eklxtreme** (8.5): I like the instrumental and her vocals give a nice mellow vibe on this, good intro

**islimp** (8.5): Huhu I'd be lying if I said I didn't love this song

**mokitsu** (8): one of ha best songs

**TragicKingdom1** (8): I like that it aims higher to a more arena rock sound than the rest of this album, although that sound has been done better in recent years.

**ComeOnAndSlang** (7.5): would give a higher rating if it were acoustic version

**floofeh** (7.5): the echo/reverb I hear in this one gave it such a grandiose feel that made it a perfect opener for the album.

**jess\_22** (7.5): Taylor goes rock, she should do more songs like this

**Johnnytoby** (7.5): a cute disney bop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): the instrumental is very nice. Don't care for her singing. Song goes on for too long.

**twat\_brained** (7.5): Why was my sister so obsessed with this in 2013?

**PuggleMaster** (7): it could be a minute shorter

**VodkaInsipido** (7): it's... okay? Like I've waited for that special thing everyone was saying there was but there isn't nothing.

**zamomattel** (7): I've listened to this song quite a few times but it has never fully gripped me. That being said it is a cute opener, much better than Welcome to New York

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6.5): not a bad song but never really got the hype?

**Magic\_warlock0-** (6.5): it's a good start off to the album, but not very memorable. Her high notes grate on my nerves here, but I love the guitar here

**strawberryswing1** (6): This song needs to be shortened by at least a minute

**supersecrettest** (6): I like the drums :)

**awryj** (5.5): There is something generic about it, but it's definitely enjoyable

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5.5): This song is boring but listenable, which is a high endorsement for me and Taylor

**dropthehammer11** (5): Not an awful opening, just kinda boring.

**johnazoidberg-** (4): This song feels longer than a CVS receipt and sounds like a pop punk band wrote it to get their music into the trailer for a coming of age movie.

**skyblade79** (4): not sure why this is so overrated… can’t wait to be torn apart for this low score tho

**SpanKKy1** (4): more like state of garbage

**MrSwearword** (3): so a less terrible but still pretty bad precursor to “Welcome to New York”

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): i've never listened to this album but i'm guessing every song sounds just like this one

letsallpoo: # Red

---

[All averages](https://pastebin.com/ACNL0VF2)

**Overall average**: 7.097 

---

**Nfranklin50**: This is easily one of my favorite albums ever. Listening to this feels like a warm fall day. It feels like home. It's sad and angry and mad and it was just everything I needed to hear at one point in time. The sounds, the colors, the emotions, everything about this album to me is perfect 

**cloudbustingmp3**: THE best album in this rate, bottom line cut and dry! it's miles ahead in songwriting and cohesion, and it manages a beautiful blend of bops and emotions. 

**Damoojo**: Talented. Brilliant. Incredible. Amazing. Show stopping. Spectacular. Deserves all the love it gets! 

**MrSwearword**: saccharine dreck with good singles [mostly] 

**awryj**: It definitely has some highlights, mostly the slow, dreamy ballads and bubblegum bops, but the rest kind of blends and sounds exactly the same. Completely unadventurous. I do like the lyrics though (usually). Anyway, if this is Taylor's best album, then she's not really for me I guess. 6/10 

**dirdbub**: so this is an album I guess, 

**skiddos**: I wanted to like this album, and I remember loving it at some point, but a lot of the songs feel stale now. The length of the album is pretty overwhelming to the point that the ballads sound tediously boring. I do feel that the album was a good transition for Taylor between Speak Now and 1989; I just can’t say that I miss country ballad Taylor at all tbh. Good for her for all that success though. 

**JunkyGS**: I was very excited to revisit this album because I remember enjoying it and it is a sub favorite, but overall I was kind of disappointed with this album. A lot of the production sounds dated or very heavy rock instrumental focused that sort of clashes with / over powers Taylor’s vocals. Her writing is nice on this record but becomes repetitive thematically after 19 tracks. There are definitely some career highlights like All Too Well, 22 and Starlight but overall this album is pretty all over the place sonically and a lot of the songs lyrically are pretty bland / nothing special Taylor Swift songs. **Speak Now** is better lyrically, **1989** is better thematically, **Taylor Swift** is more consistent and **Fearless** is better sonically. This leaves **Red** ultimately being the Jack of All Trades in her discography with no better strengths then her other albums, which isn’t a bad thing but it makes it not memorable to me. 

**treesoutsidemywindow**: Taylor's most raw album (and my favorite by her); who knows if she ever bares her emotions like she did on Red again? 1989 was a lot more polished and "superficial". After the backlash she has received the last couple of years, she might not take the chance again. We will probably find out soon enough on TS6. 

**therokinrolla**: my third favorite album ever. The ability of this album to evoke the raw emotions that come from love in songs like state of grace, red, and holy ground is something amazing and touching. I know this album wont do well. I know this album with have the lowest average. I know this album with be the first out, and i know this album will be berated during the reveal. But thats okay. No album has made me cry more,happy and sad, made me sit there and just, think, more than this album has. No album has made me more nostalgic, or more free, or more happy. Thank you so much Taylor. <3 

**Qwilphish**: Starts off extremely song, but the back half is so boring. I can't knock her for making a cohesive album that allowed for a seamless transition into 1989. Still, overall my least favorite album, although this had better highs than Kiss just because I can't stand country slow songsss. Average - 5.5 

**enecks**: This album is interesting. Song for song, I'd consider it better than 1989. However, 1989 has way higher highs, and the lows aren't as low as this album's. The album cuts are way better than the singles, which feel like a mutant stuck between country and pop in a way that just sucks. 

**TragicKingdom1**: Red is not a bad album but it encapsulates exactly why I don't really like Taylor Swift's music that much. Musically, it's very acoustic and singer-songwritery, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but imo this kind of music has been very played out, especially in the pop scene. Sure, the lyrics are personal and poetic and I'm sure that's why this album connects to a lot of people, but for me I was left unimpressed because (aside from the token radio singles) the tone is too melancholic and melodramatic to grip me. In addition, a lot of the songs on here lack a sense of momentum and power that to me are two of the most important elements to a good pop song. If you like this, I wouldn't be offended, but this isn't my cup of tea. 

**cyborglilith**: I was so ready to give it bad scores but i ended up giving most over 5 :< 

**patronsaintofaspies**: I really loved this album up till The Last Time, and even then it still has a couple of bops throughout the second half. I'm not the biggest fan of Taylor, but this album really does prove how talented she is. I finally get the hype behind it. Also, I'd like to comment something about this album's era as a whole; while it did propel Taylor into pop stardom, I'm sad about the fact that people attacked Taylor with sexist and misogynistic comments while it lasted. I mean, Taylor is a huge snake and all, and songs like Better than Revenge plus her being friends with Lena Durham are as shady as hell. But I can't help but wonder if the backlash targeted towards her during this era made her more shrewd and calculating as a whole. Really, given the hate thrown at her I'm really not surprised she started being so messy. She's still super problematic, but still, I pity her. 

**agentofscranton**: even though the disjointed-ness of it at times makes me feel like I’m listening to two different albums merged into one, this will always be one of my favourite albums of all time – it’s not only Taylor’s best, but also one of the best albums released by any of the post-2000 pop girls 

**Leixander**: Taylor's best album. Contains some fillers but it is the perfect fusion of country-pop. 

**CharmingArsenal**: My first time listening to this album, going in with an open mind and I hope not to be too hard on it. 

**Elitefourbrad**: A refreshing sound and all around a great album. One of the best of the decade for sure, and Taylor’s best album. 

**OwenKam50**: Not a song where the lyrics aren’t meaningful, one of my all time fave albums, absolutely no fillers. My 11 obviously belongs here, extremely hard to decide which track to give it to. Wonder if I have a higher average or doc tho… Honestly, taylor is one of the only artists whos slow songs I enjoy, and that may be why I stan her as much as I do. Album conveys emotion better than any other album, maybe save for speak now. Cant “have some nuance” if every song is a 9 or 10, letsallpoo. :1989 flair: 

**mokitsu**: i tried putting rational thought into Taylor Swift once, and that resulted in my review of Red. that was one of the worst experiences of my life, without exaggeration -- not because of how much bad there was, but because the ration of bad to good was approaching infinite:1. so no, i'm not going to put rational thought into Swift or try to have a rational debate about her. there is really no argument i can make that will persuade you Swift is bad if you don't already think it. yeah, it was one of the worst experiences in my life. because everything else in my life had a good side. there's a lot of shitty things i've gone through, but i could say "well, at least i'm a better person now". you get something out of it. there's an upside. Taylor Swift's "Red" had no upside. there's no reason to it. 

**johnazoidberg-**: This album is just too many songs for how much filler is on it. She could have easily kept 6 songs off of this and made it a better album that didn't almost put me to sleep. TayTay baby what is you doing? 

**VodkaInsipido**: Not a bad album, it has great songs, but it feels really fillery. Still a snake tho 🐍🐍🐍 

**supersecrettest**: I'm not really a country fan, but I was able to get into some of the more pop tracks on this album. For the slower, country ones, I understand the fanbase and why people like them, but they just don't really click with me. 

**superr\_rad**: I'm not a swiftie 

**ComeOnAndSlang**: probably my most favorite album of all time. Not a bad song on the album, every song is worthy of binge listening. 

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris**: This album, as a whole is Taylor's best. 1989 has higher highs, but lower lows. This has a steady quality throughout. 

**SimplyHaunted**: I actually really dislike Red and hated 1989 when they were first released because they were such departures from the country pop Taylor I knew and loved. I couldn't stand State of Grace or Treacherous or WANEGBT. I was like "WHAT IN TARNATION IS MY TAYLOR SWIFT, COUNTRY PRINCESS, DOIN'." But then I got older and have fallen in love with this album. I bop to 22 almost daily since I've turned 22 because it never fails to brighten my mood. Seriously, this album is so good and I've really come to appreciate the beautiful mix of pop/country/rock that Red delivers.

letsallpoo: 

**floofeh**: I hopped on Taylor's bandwagon after Love Story and I always connected more with her poppier songs. This album was more unapologetic about being pop and I was definitely here for it. Taylor managed to release music that seemed to be about me which cemented her as one of my faves. 

**MissyBee37**: "Red" is one of my all-time favorite albums by any artist, ever. This album is Taylor Swift's stellar songwriting at its finest. I love the imagery, the poetry and the storytelling in her lyrics. Combined with gorgeous guitar throughout and beautiful melodies, this album is just so incredibly evocative. I love her blend of acoustic, country, rock and pop. The end result is an album with a good bit of variety that still maintains a clearly cohesive style. "Red" expressed some of the exact emotions I so desperately needed a song to say at the time in my life when it was released. While many of the themes are romantic, I was able to relate them to the end of the closest friendship I've ever known. Songs like "I Almost Do" and "All Too Well" helped me move on from losing a friend who felt more like an extension of myself. I can't say enough about how much I love this album and always will love it. I think it's Taylor's masterpiece. 

**wailordfan**: This album meant a lot to me. It feels like a perfect album, but I can't rate it as though it is because I shouldn't be that obviously stan-y. The album is a perfect blend of past and future Taylor, featuring some of her best lyrics and mixtures in sounds. So yeah. I love the album. A TON. 

**henry413**: It's inconsistent, the highs are really high but the lows are really low. I preferred 1989 and Speak Now over this album. 

**rickikardashian**: I have a very soft spot for Red, because in this era it was when I truly became both a fan and a hater of her, and since then I’ve had my love/hate relationship with her and her music. I think the best part of this album is the lyrics of most songs. She finds a way to express her feelings and scenarios in a very simple yet beautiful way, that can make people relate to. Also the tour gave us [this iconic look](http://68.media.tumblr.com/b0ef73785aa722e6092899e33d9a4257/tumblr_mq2iuoN1Gz1r4fk4fo1_1280.jpg) 

**Ghost-Quartet**: Before listening to this album, I considered myself just a casual fan of Taylor Swift. Because I’m a Spotify user (hi Katy!) I had never actually listened to one of her albums, but I loved a lot of her singles. She really had a knack for capturing emotions and all of the singles from 1989 snatched me bald, a phrase I try to avoid using. But after listening to Red I have to say that yeah, that was probably an accurate assessment of my attachment towards her, this album was pretty boring to me. I usually try to listen to albums all in one sitting but I just couldn’t with Red I had to stop it halfway through because I just wasn’t responding. I felt so detached from the album and honestly rather annoyed. I’m a theatre kid so I’m used to long, story style songs so I’m not quite sure why I didn’t connect with this but I just didn’t. I couldn’t even muster up enough of a reaction to give the songs bad scores, there were a lot of scores around the middle. I usually endeavor to write a comment for every song in a rate, but I intentionally left this album blank for several reasons. I honestly didn’t have feelings towards most of the songs so I didn’t have very worthwhile comments (except for IKYWT because that song is special) but more than that I try to be a positive person and I know a lot of people adore this album and they don’t need to hear me shitting on it. I do like Taylor, she’s a fantastic songwriter, but this album is just eh. (Why do I always feel the need to qualify anything bad I say about Taylor with a bunch of compliments?) It was okay I guess but it didn't manage to turn me from a fan to stan. Probably my least favorite of the three albums in the rate. 

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: this is my favourite album ever and it shows. I’m not ashamed at all, this is a masterpiece. “Es tan corto el amor, y es tan largo el olvido.” aka “Love is so short, forgetting is so long.” Ay Neruda, ay. “There's an old poem by Neruda that I've always been captivated by, and one of the lines in it has stuck with me ever since the first time I read it. It says "love is so short, forgetting is so long." It's a line I've related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened, and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope, extreme joy, intense passion, wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown. And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red. My experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming. And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of. Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic. But most of all, this record is about love that was red.” 

**twat\_brained**: Remember when Taylor had a *reputation* when this album came out? :meghan: :meghan: :meghan: sorry, /u/wailordfan 

**nooodisaster**: This album seems like the transition era from Taylor's early country days to her current pop reign. Because of that, it's a bit of a master of none for me. We don't quite get the lyrical mastery and dedication of Speak Now, nor the iconic earworms of 1989. What that leaves is an album that tries to do it all, but has too much filler imo to truly reach greatness. 

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Along with Ray of Light and Confessions on a Dancefloor, this album helped me go through my last year of high school and it made me a huge Taylor stan in my school. When I listen to Red, I think about all of the memories I made in senior year and for that, this album remains my favorite album from hers. She has the best of everything about her in this album and she embraces the popstar in her that would eventually transition herself into a popstar.  I will forever stan this era. 

**Magic\_warlock0-**: There are some seriously excellent songs on this album. Taylor captured my attention seriously as a pop gal! Overall, I don't think this is a strong album as Fearless was, or what 1989 would be, but it marked an important transition in my mind for the singer-songwriter! Red impressed me in many ways but had too many blah moments to fully love the whole album 

**raicicle**: I think this album definitely has Taylor’s best and most mature songs, but the album as a whole (while decent) is kinda confusing. Mostly the pacing more than anything. Like, the pacing basically doesn’t exist. 

**blue\_heart\_**: Red is undoubtedly the favourite Taylor album among her fans and I don't have to speak up for its success, selling more than a million copies in its first week. Most songs are Taylor's own work and it contains the most beautiful metaphors I've ever seen in music. Looking back on Taylor's career I think this will be seen as a masterpiece. 

**luigi\_is\_better**: I really thought that Red would get my highest average, but after relistening it was my middle-of-the-pack album. I really love the first part of the album, but after WANEGBT it kinda dragged and had very few highlights. Still good and possibly my fav album from Taylor. 

**10footnotes**: Red was the very first album I ever bought, so it’s special to me. I listened to it a lot for a few years, but it faded into the background as I gradually discovered more artists and wanted to play new music instead. However, I’ve recently been rediscovering the magic of this album (partly thanks to popheads!) and I’m glad of it. Red has a great mix of both upbeat songs and ballads and pop and country songs. It’s a Taylor Swift album, so of course it has outstanding lyrics and lots of tracks that tell great stories. Red is a high-quality, dynamic, special album, and I’m glad that it has an important place in my personal musical history. 

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: Everything is red His pills, his hands, his jeans And now i’m covered in the colors pull apart at the seams And it's red And it's red Reputation the new album out November 10, 2017 is grey His hair, his smoke, his dreams And now she's so devoid of talent She don’t know what it means And he's blue And he's blue 

**SpanKKy1**: why does every song sound the same

letsallpoo: 
**Piccprincess**: This album means a lot to me. In 2012 I was in my first long term relationship, and though it started great, it went downhill and fast. This was the first guy I fell in love with, the guy I lost my virginity to. After we had sex, it got messy. This guy would require me to text him at every hour of the day, even when I was in class, I couldn't hang out with dudes, couldn't go to parties, and would get mad when I had to do something mandatory that would take time away from spending time together. And you know what, I went with it. I isolated myself from my friends. I was young, in love, and thought that no one would ever want me that way ever again. Then, right when I was at my lowest, a miracle happened. Taylor released Red on my 20th birthday. I bought it immediately and started listening. I had been a Swiftie for years, but never knew what it was like to have songs completely gut me. Songs like The Last Time, Treacherous, and The Moment I Knew, and I Knew You Were Trouble opened my eyes to the literal shit I had gotten myself into. State Of Grace made me realize that what I had been experiencing was not "good and right." Unfortunately, I...was in a hole that was almost too deep for me to come out of. I was really depressed. Thanks to Taylor and Red, I was able to build myself back up and leave that son of a bitch. Everyday, I carry the memories of listening to the album while pathetically crying myself to bed every night, while walking to and from class and getting meals while spending so much time alone as possible. It healed me. It honestly did.

Half the album sounded the same to me. Boring ballads that didn't give me anything emotionally and were too long. I actually tried to be more generous so my average would be above 4.

bwc222: I rarely give albums such a low average but Red is pretty unbearable for me. Like I genuinely tried to listen to it (multiple times) and made it through, it's just not my type of music. Too country and too boring. I would never rig scores. My song/album/artist ratings are almost always less than the agregate average.

Y'all were tumbling over each other talking about how this was easily going to win and trying to sabotage it and shit, when in reality it never had a chance. Right now is the closest it ever got to hitting #1-before it was a full 30+ points behind, and there's still a comfortable distance between this song and #1. I hope this is at least a lesson in how you can't really predict this stuff in our rates, because apparently the 2016 rate wasn't enough proof.

But back to the song. When *My Everything* dropped, this song instantly became my favorite (clock my last.fm - it's my most-played Ariana song). It had the guise of an emotional ballad but combined that emotion with pounding drums and gorgeous synths, and the result was equal parts heavenly and bussy-shattering. I was so glad that this became a single, not only for the fact that Ariana needed to prove that she could stand on her own, and even though it kinda flopped in America it still remained her defining song from the ME era. The Manchester incident has only added to the legacy of this song, and I can only hope that it will continue to be Ariana's defining song. Buy it on iTunes.

---
**BionicFunhouse** (11): Really there is no contest. This is the only eleven in this rate.

**eklxtreme** (11): this song has always gotten me emotional in the past and it does so even more now. it has perfect melodies and production.

**enecks** (11): Context is one of the most important aspects of culture. Context places things in their time, yet it is also decidedly elastic. Culture without context is vapid, meaningless, ultimately bland imagination. Culture with context can give meaning, power, emphasis, joy, tragedy. One Last Time has completely changed with the context of the Manchester attacks. Once, it was just a bittersweet EDM pop song that stood as one of Ariana's better songs. Now it is a song about unity in divided and uneasy times - a symbol of companionship in the face of evil. I can't listen to this without crying any more.

**lexarqade** (11): I'll be absolutely shocked if this doesn't win, but it deserves it - not only because of everything Ari went through this year but because it's a genuinely good track. I'm glad she was able to move forward from it.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (11): Perfection on this album! Beautiful singing, the desire to be with that someone for just one more experience, this is one of Ariana's best, and my favorite in the whole rate

**skyblade79** (11): Favorite Ariana song ever, and now it’s even more meaningful. It’s just so incredibly soulful and powerful.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): i dont know what to type here without feeling sad and i dont want to type "literally ended terrorism" but she really did THAT. queen of uniting a nation during dark times around an emotional bop :(

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): Ariana Grande's best song and best video and I have no doubt about it. I don't even know if it makes me happy or sad but I do know that I never skip this song when it comes on. I'm barely giving out any 10s in this rate but I'm not even hesitating to give this an 11, it's just that good.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (0): this is repetitive as fuck and Manchester doesn’t give you a pass, sorry not sorry at all. And I’m not doing this to sabotage this album, the instrumental is repetitive as fuck, but I also have to give her props cause I didn’t notice it until my sis spent a whole week playing it 24/7

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): this song has always bored me for some reason. it feels like it's trying to build up to some big release, but it never really goes anywhere? i know she tries popping off in the last chorus, but it still feels too subdued to feel like a real payoff. it's just very... meh.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This was one of the songs that immediately grabbed me when I was first getting into Ariana. It's just a straight up beautiful solo for her, I adore everything about it. It's also one of those songs that strongly resonates with me, maybe it's just who I am as a person but there's something that I really appreciate about pathetic, pleading breakup songs, and this is almost a deconstruction of that archetype. She clearly knows that getting back together is a horrible idea and she's very open about it, but sheer love and desperation force her to put her pride aside and admit that though she's not worthy of a second chance, she'll take anything she can get. As someone who's, um, been that guy before, it's a brave sentiment to be open about. The song has taken on a somewhat different concept in the wake of the Manchester attack, and I think that’s a testament to how universal the message of this song is. We all experience love and loss, in all kinds of ways. And nobody likes it.

**qwertyfarts** (10): I know a lot of attention was given to this song in the comment section to rate it highly, but this for me is deserved of a 10, (an 11, but i'll wait for the final race to award it that score) I don't disagree that it deserves an 11 because of what happened and its new meaning but I'm judging it purely on the song itself and as it was originally put out and I still feel it deserved the score.

**wailordfan** (9): The song is a good Ari song, but it feels almost insensitive to point out something you don't like about the song at this point because of its association with the Manchester tragedy. It has the best backing production in the entire album, and I LOVE the emotion in the last chorus, but this song has some of the WORST enunciation I've ever heard. The verses are a bit of a mess because you can't really hear what she is saying half the time, and the lyrics are even sub-par, especially "Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you" or "I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar" is so jarring because of the off-putting lack of rhyme scheme there.

Thematically it is a fine song, and nothing bad about it, but the song is going to get so many 10s simply because it is almost taboo to not give it a good score because she used it as the anthem in response to Manchester, and honestly I don't think that should be how we rank the songs here, but I'm scared to not give it a 10, even if I think the enunciation ruins the verses. So. That's why I gave the song a 9. Not because I think it is a bad song or because I'm insensitive about what Ari has gone through, but it is similar to how we destroyed the Louis Tomlinson song about his mother. We were aware of how the song was used, it doesn't mean we don't see its flaws too.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This is great. Well, except for the annoying drumming sound I hear in the middle of the song (seriously, what's up with that sound?) but I don't notice it unless I'm hearing this song in high quality. It's the one of the only modern ballads this sub can stand, and for good reason; Ariana actually conveys genuine emotions on it, and uses her voice as a tool to make the song better instead of trying to make it the sole focus of her performance. One more thing I have to say-it's incredibly sad that this song sounds much, much more bittersweet than it did when it was first released. I used to hear this song in a lot of plug.djs back in sophomore year, and now...it carries different connotations. And those connotations are incredibly heartbreaking.

=====

letsallpoo: 

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): chorus is amazing and I love the sad undertones

**angusaditus** (10): Actual perfection. I've listened to it on repeat when the album came out, it was my running song, and I'm still not tired of it.

**dirdbub** (10): this took on a whole new meaning :(

**Elitefourbrad** (10): The song of Manchester and a BOP! This song has so much more meaning now and how can you not rate this high?

**ExtraEater** (10): :'(


**ignitethephoenix** (10): I first heard this song from the Manchester concert, and I couldn't believe I never heard this song during his era. It's such a good song, and definitely a bit underrated.

**jess\_22** (10): this just took on a whole new meaning after Manchester :(

**Johnnytoby** (10): :(

**lady\_sable** (10): god, after Manchester this song makes me so sad. It's easily one of her best singles, and deserved to chart higher than it did.

**mdawgig** (10): That last chorus is a major adrenaline rush. One of the biggest bops on this album is one of the few without a feature. Hmm… Coincidence????? No. It's not a coincidence.

**mokitsu** (10): at my DWT show (post-Manchester) this song had everyone in their feelings, it was truly an experience

**MrSwearword** (10): dance/pop Ariana is the best Ariana.

**musicotic** (10): Another bop

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): a future rate winner

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Yeah, I can't listen to this without tearing up, just a little. The Queen of England's anthem. All rise.

**OberionSynth** (10): I'd gladly wake up in Ariana's arms let's be real

**Piccprincess** (10): The words I say before Calvin leaves me

**piplup123** (10): pls let taylor beat this

**poppinmmolly** (10): If I was allowed another 11, this would be it.


**RandomDKguy** (10): ??

**rickikardashian** (10): I used to not like this song, but it grew on me after the whole Manchester thing

**skargardin** (10): A chilling masterpiece.

**strawberryswing1** (10): <3

**superr\_rad** (10): this song is so pretty. a song about encouraging someone to cheat turned into a really heartbreaking tribute to lost lives and i kinda get emotional sometimes when listening. regardless, this is a great song, the production is a bit outdated but to me its kinda timeless for the meaning of it.

**supersecrettest** (10): This is just such a clean + crisp song. 10.

**TeamAwesome4** (10): Ari's best.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I absolutely adore the instrumental here. It’s simple and 100% fitting for her voice. Really great stuff, and it’s got this chill and dreamy atmosphere to it. Her performance of this at Manchester is just really something else, and truly made me realize how much I love this song.

**triptoyourheart** (10): Not getting my 11 but I hope this wins (since my 11 has no chance). This song made me stan her, and now it has such special meaning with the Manchester incident. The final chorus always gives me goosebumps.

**twat\_brained** (10): After how anthemic this song had become following the events of Manchester and everything that came out of it, it's nothing short of **HEINOUS** that Ed won Artist of the Year at the VMAs instead of Ariana. MTV cancelled.

**zamomattel** (10): Ariana Grande, tonight you told us that there was just One Last Time, but we were left wondering if you had a few more left up your sleeve. You're safe.

**10footnotes** (9.5): Will you follow me… One last time? Necessary references aside, this song is obviously going to score highly because of Manchester and Ariana’s mature, heartwarming response to it. However, it’s also a really good song on its own merits.

**awryj** (9.5): I feel like I'm obliged to give it a good score because Max Landis directed the music video and he's one of the [biggest Jesus stans ever](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/883193810422988800/fk4rV4oa_400x400.jpg). It's also a great song.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): verses are mediocre but the chorus hits hard


**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Damn, who knew one huge incident could really change the entire meaning of this song?


**floofeh** (8): the melody is a bit melancholic and adds to the songs weight.

**therokinrolla** (8): its okay but kinda overrated. Honestly the 4 extra points are for that stunning performance from Manchester

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): This song is kinda overrated but its still good

**VeganSquash** (7.5): repetitive bop

**bwc222** (7): "i know i should have farted, atleast i'm being honest"

**nooodisaster** (7): I don't get the hype for this song. It's like an average ballad with average lyrics and fine singing. The music video is fun?

**OwenKam50** (7): her voice is so muffled

**blue\_heart\_** (6): This song was so overplayed here. Yall don't know what you're asking for when you're asking people to play more Ari.

**fifthchevron** (6): The song sounds great but them lyrics...almost sounds like coercion...if not that then cheating...no thanks...

**ImADudeDuh** (6): A sweet song but I don't feel anything with this one

**Qwilphish** (5): I feel terrible for scoring this low with the weight that the song holds now after the tragedy, but this song is pretty weak. The verses are pretty boring and the chorus barely is able to pick up that weight. I scored it a bit higher because of its new meaning, but oh well.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): honestly this was a bad choice as a single

# My Everything

---

[All averages](https://pastebin.com/qDKZYmx8)

**Overall average**: 7.270 

---

**cloudbustingmp3**: y'all are going to overrate this because of the OG rate + the tragedy, but honestly... it's not a solid piece of work. it's a handful of good songs + a lot of meh filler 

**Damoojo**: Don't really listen to Ariana that much but this album has some great bops in it. 

**MrSwearword**: it's good when it doesn't try so hard to pander to a strictly "R&B" audience. 

**awryj**: I did not expect it at all but this is probably the most consistently good album of the rate. Ariana's insanely talented and the vast majority of the songs are really fun. Sorry Carly, you're still the queen, but My Everything wins this round. 8.5/10 

**dirdbub**: ok yeah cool, 

**skiddos**: This might not be as good as Dangerous Woman, but hell is it a solid album. 

**treesoutsidemywindow**: I honestly don't understand why Ariana has features on so many of her tracks. I feel like those tend to steal her thunder a bit. I hope on her next album, she gets to shine a bit more by herself. 

**therokinrolla**: im not a HUGE fan of Dangerous Woman, but DW for the most part is actually quite consistent throughout. However, this album has a lot of peaks and a lot of real lows. However, the singles save one last time, and Just a Little Bit of Your Heart keep this album going. Those are really good tracks, i wish the rest of the album held up 

**Qwilphish**: A much better album than I remember, I love R&B Ariana so much and this album just gives that in spades. I had it as my least favorite of hers before this rate, but now I think it's tied with YT. There are few dead throwaway tracks, but also few standout tracks as well. Average - 7.8 

**enecks**: Now this is a good album. While some cuts kind of reveal areas Ariana improved on in Dangerous Woman, this is still a fantastic album, with some enjoyable EDM flavour, and a lot of features. As far as glossy pop albums go, you could do a lot worse than this. 

**cyborglilith**: Full of underrated bops! I also really like the cover and the general aesthetic of the album. 

**patronsaintofaspies**: Don't kill me, bit the My Everything era reminds me of the Like A Virgin era. That era propelled Madonna into superstardom, but the album that ushered it was, if fun to listen to, not really worth much as a whole. At the cost of having slightly less commercial success being but a slightly better album, I feel that My Everything suffered the same legacy as a whole. 

**agentofscranton**: it’s not as good as Dangerous Woman but aside from one or two songs it’s definitely a great album and features some of Ariana’s best songs 

**Leixander**: Worst album of Ariana yet, which is not a bad thing necessarily. Too many features kind of make this album bloated. 

**CharmingArsenal**: Queen of launching the careers of features. 

**Elitefourbrad**: Ariana’s second best album, but this is one of the best singles-wise albums this decade. 

**mokitsu**: ha magnum opus, bop after bop, dangerous donut wishes 

**VodkaInsipido**: Probably the best of the three. DW is still better and more cohesive, but this one has more highs. 

**superr\_rad**: I've only recently embraced being a massive ariana stan but i have probably listened to this album about 50 times and i will have a bias towards it and thats okay. this def isnt as strong as dw but its a good sophomore album and it serves the bops. i still have serious questions about who chooses ari's album art... 

**reddituser206**: Still needs voice coaching ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

**ComeOnAndSlang**: best vocalist here, but the worst album of the 3. Everything is just so forgettable and feels like filler except for a select few songs. 

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris**: I absolutely adore this album. Ariana became a household name from this and I was so proud. It was truly leaps and bounds over everything that was released in 2014. 

**SimplyHaunted**: I probably would have given most of these songs anywhere between .5-1.5 higher if I could understand what she is singing. This is the first whole Ariana Grande album I've listened to and while I don't think the most cohesive album, it still has a lot of bopable singles. 

**Piccprincess**: Calvin Harris is my everything 

**SendMeYourSATScores**: the first album leak i ever listened to even though it technically wasn't a leak it was just released in new zealand and i thought i was cool 

**floofeh**: Ariana delivers but truly shines on the big singles. Her lesser known songs definitely have meritcas well and none are truly bad. I do feel the extra songs are not quite up to par and I see why they were left out. 

**MissyBee37**: I didn't know anything about Ariana Grande before "Problem" was a big hit. That song was the reason I first listened to the album, but I immediately fell in love with her voice and so many other great songs this album has to offer. "My Everything" was one of my favorite albums of 2014. 

**wailordfan**: My issue with this album is its themes, when Ari really needs collabs to really push her sound forward. She is kinda bland in most of her solo songs on the album. For an album titled My Everything, she really needs the help of others to make herself sound diverse. It wouldn't be until DW that she can really pull off a solo sound. 

**rickikardashian**: [Me rating this entire album](https://image.prntscr.com/image/-WFMvuH0TByqNW8PW91PoQ.png). No but fr, I do love this album. It sounds fun and nice, but it also has some slower deeper songs. Each song is special in its own unique way, and I dare to say that is the best album in this rate ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

**Ghost-Quartet**: I stand by that this is Ariana’s worst album. I don’t even think that the songs on it are necessarily bad, I actually quite like many of the songs on it, but it’s just not good as an album. It feels too sterile and composed as opposed to her other two, this album lacks personality and identity. It feels more like a collection of singles rather than an album, it’s appropriate that it’s called “My Everything” because, well, it’s just kind of everything thrown in there in an attempt to see what sticks. The track order is completely random. There’s no sound that links the album, only an abstract theme of “relationships.” This is just… I dunno, there’s not a ton of heart put into this that I see. I got the sense that Ariana made specific choices with the songs and sounds of Yours Truly and Dangerous Woman, that those were specific moments of her life that she was trying to capture, but this album just felt like chasing a hit. Thus a lot of the songs are fun to listen to and have good replay value, but I don’t really connect with them. This album just feels cold and grey to me, almost mechanical. She said that she wanted to experiment with a lot of different sounds and vibes on this song, and I can respect that, but then I don’t really consider it an album but more a sample platter of potential ideas for her to develop in the future. I don’t hate it, but it is the Ariana album I listen to the least. 

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: i can't believe that the same person who made Dangerous Woman made this shitty record, iguess it shows how young she was when she made this 

**twat\_brained**: Dangerous Woman out-Metacritic'd 

**nooodisaster**: I've enjoyed all of Ariana's albums, but this was the one that made me closest to a stan. Re-listening to this, it was a lot more uneven than I remember, perhaps because the singles from this era were all ICONIC. This was the album where Ariana became a superstar. in my eyes 

**mudkip1**: /u/letsallpoo 

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: For an album full of bops, this feels a bit incohesive for some reason and that's one of the reasons why this album isn't really strong as much as it wants to be. Still, this is a good album nonetheless. I am just glad Dangerous Woman exists because that's the album where I truly stan Ariana. 

**Magic\_warlock0-**: Definitely a more polarizing album in my opinion, compared to Yours Truly or Dangerous Woman. The highest are great, but there are a startling number of lows present too. I appreciated this album for expanding the range that Ariana explored in music style and topics, but I have trouble saying this is a cohesive album. It’s just her weakest album on the whole, but still a good one. I think there was too many guest appearances for be comfortable with, but she improves in time! 

**luigi\_is\_better**: Sometimes I feel like Ari fans try so hard to hype Dangerous Woman up that they underrate My Everything saying that DW is way better. Both are good, but DW is more consistent. I only listened to all of this album this year, so I may be biased, but I really like it. 

**10footnotes**: This album has some gems (Love Me Harder, One Last Time, Break Free, Why Try), but it also has some overproduced R&B tracks and unremarkable slow songs. 

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: mine and iggy azalea, zedd, big sean, cashmere cat, childish gambino, the weeknd, a$ap ferg, jessie j, and nicki minaj's everything* /s

I hate how it's just Ariana screaming grammatically incorrect phrases over a really basic production but it's super #gay and shit so I guess I'm not surprised this is so high. Tbh I didn't know this song was so beloved, but gays will be gays I suppose. The "THIS IS. THE PART WHEN. I SAYIDAONWHAUYEUA" section still leaves me :snatched: though!

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (11): There was a period where, after hearing it on RuPaul’s Drag Race, I was obsessed with this song and I thought it was one of the best songs ever. I’ve cooled off on it now (I definitely burned myself out on it during that big breakup I always complain about) but I think it still stands as one of Ariana’s best, certainly one of the best on the album. The intro is iconic, it instantly grabs you and transports you into the world of the song. It’s a fierce showcase of Ariana as a performer, she has amazing presence on this track. She’s fierce and absolutely in control, you really believe that she’s breaking free! The lyrics are also really cool. “:ike a deadly fever on a highway to hell” is a sick line, I don’t know what it means but at the same time it means everything? “In my dreams it felt so right, and even though there’s the weird “really are” line, it’s a very tight song with a clear, empowering message. Also I love that the music video is a campy Barbarella sendup, complete with a questionably racist Fu-Manchu stand-in and gay aliens. This is the song that me fall in love with Ariana, and that was a great decision.

**MrSwearword** (11): best song in the rate and should’ve been #1 on the Hot 100

**OberionSynth** (11): queen of being what she really am

**PuggleMaster** (11): I was bald the day this was released. That was at the peak of my zedd and Ariana standom! I hope they collab in the future

**reddituser206** (11): feminine EDM done right, take notes Chainsmokers

**superr\_rad** (11): a modern gay anthem, be alright's predecessor, this better place top 5 or popheads is CONFIRMED homophobic. "fart on your body" is iconic, and this song makes me feel so powerful and gay and happy. i love the video, it proves ari is a lowkey camp queen, and she well deserves her title as a gay icon imo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): Easy 11 for me here. This has definite traces of Zedd’s debut, while also not feeling shoehorned - it’s a song that’s dated but doesn’t feel the part. The drop feels like a tool, an aid to the release, and when it happens, it’s cathartic. Ariana’s really great at these bombastic trials of excess, and Break Free may be the best one she’s done yet.

**zamomattel** (11): Ariana Grande, tonight you Broke Free, and showed us you could be fierce, Jaidynn Diore Fierce in fact. Condragulations, you are the winner of this week's challenge, you have won a sickening supply of Squatty Potties from SquattyPotty.com.

---

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): One of Zedd's most iconic collaborations. The 'now that I've become who I really are' line was supposed to make a thousand English teachers shake their canes, but around the time this song was released there were articles popping up online arguing that Ironic was actually ironic (did you do the Canadian rate last month, hunties?) so thankfully all we got were a few bad grammar jokes. It really represented my state of mind at the time.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): y'all remember that video of Ruby Rose with this song in the background? Well I remember it bc I was confused as shit bc she was like the hottest person I'd ever seen but then she was like "oh I'm a boy" and I had to be like "oh shit quick say no homo". Long story short Ruby Rose is incredibly good looking and this song is electropop perfection.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember this song coming out and I was like "Oh boy, Ariana is doing EDM? This song is going to so dated quick." Jokes on Doc circa 2014, this song still sounds fresh today and I hope it continues to age well. Zedd + Max Martin know how to make hard bops!

**gannade** (2): So certain people want to shit on Hailee's "Starving" because of the messy production @poo, but this song gets a pass? [*editor's note: I GAVE THIS A LOW SCORE TOO*] Lol no. The production is just as noisy and overworked. That autotuned "Woooooo" she does in the verses is great tho

**Qwilphish** (1): I will never get why this song is so loved here, sure the lyrics are pretty inspirational but it's so boring. Every time that I think that the song might get better, like after the buildup post-chorus, it either dies down into the next verse or into the SUPER messy outro that ALSO goes into nothing. This song will be ranked high because its a single and people love pre-2017 daddy zedd.

**enecks** (10): Zedd is probably one of the most divisive figures in popheads, yet I like his unashamed EDM bombast. He made some of the more memorable songs in Artpop, so why not get him with Ariana? As it turns out, this was a good combination. The EDM's lack of subtlety goes perfectly well with the lyrical cliches to make some punchy pop that plays to both their strengths.

**10footnotes** (9): So I actually bought this song when it was released. I thought it was clever how the lyrics were self-aware of their cliches (“the part when I break free” instead of just “I’m breaking free”), but as I’ve gotten older I’ve realized that they’re probably meant more to fill up space than to be clever.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): WHEW A CERTIFIED BANGER! fart on my body ari!

**lexarqade** (10): I'll never unhear "Fart on my body you came alive" in the bridge.

**rickikardashian** (10): _FART ON YOUR BODY I CAMEEEEEE ALIVE_

---

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Endlessly listenable, and forever linked to the epic Kandy vs Jaidynn lip-sync in my mind. Shoot.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): that lipsync should've been a double shantay

**TeamAwesome4** (9): This is, the pot whaan I say oddowannia, I'm stronguh then I been befaaa! This is, the pot whaan I bweak fwee, cuz I can resist it no maah!

**Kaylaboe** (9): queen of grammar. i love how she sneaks in a little ‘m’ at the end of ‘who i really are'

**awryj** (9): A Genius annotation: "If you listen carefully she changes midword from “are” to “am,” from plural to singular. She’s breaking free from the relationship, of seeing herself as part of a unit. +2" oh hun

**dirdbub** (10): ok dis hard

**dropthehammer11** (10): FUCKING. QUALITY.

**eklxtreme** (10): amazing production that complements her vocals wonderfully. undeniably a bop.

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Literal pure pop perfection!

**Johnnytoby** (10): fuck i remember when this came out like fuckkkkk this is when she became legendary

**lady\_sable** (10): This was the first Ariana song I ever heard, and also one of my favorites. It's highkey a banger.

**musicotic** (10): Queen of aliens

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I've always said that Zedd works great with singers with big voices, and this is no exception.

**RandomPotatos** (10): zedd's masterfully produced beat makes up for the grammatically incorrect lyrics

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): best ariana song. period.

**skyblade79** (10): the video is totally horrible, but without that, this song is SO good. When it came out, I couldn’t stop listening to it

**strawberryswing1** (10): Queen of re-inventing grammar

**supersecrettest** (10): This song is really great. I love it. :)

**triptoyourheart** (10): This was the song of 2014 for me (sorry Shake It Off), still goes off!

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Endlessly listenable, and forever linked to the epic Kandy vs Jaidynn lip-sync in my mind. Shoot.

**10footnotes** (9): So I actually bought this song when it was released. I thought it was clever how the lyrics were self-aware of their cliches (“the part when I break free” instead of just “I’m breaking free”), but as I’ve gotten older I’ve realized that they’re probably meant more to fill up space than to be clever.

**angusaditus** (9): A gay anthem for the ages.

**CharmingArsenal** (9): Zedd had a hit with Clarity feat. Foxes, but I feel like Break Free is what really gave him that push into the GP's eye. I find that to be true with two other tracks on this album as well.

**johnazoidberg-** (9): This song is incredible, but Zedd, bubbeleh, what was that EDM shit at the end?

**Kaylaboe** (9): queen of grammar. i love how she sneaks in a little ‘m’ at the end of ‘who i really are'

**mdawgig** (9): Ariana sounds great when she features on her own track. Maybe she should just become a rent-a-hook singer instead of releasing aggressively bland music with rent-a-rappers and rent-a-producers under her own name.

**skargardin** (9): Both Ari and Zedd brought their A game to this bop.

**therokinrolla** (9): its a good song, bront

**twat\_brained** (9): I would let every single Sean Cody actor bareback me if it meant writing a song with Max Martin that sounded this good. I guess a good EDM artist also helps. I don't want that stupid breakdown at the end though. Or a lyric as mindless as "I only want to die alive".

**VodkaInsipido** (9): Still a bop. It has aged kinda bad due to it being EDM, but it still goes hard. And *who I really are* might be the most tragic line any popstar sung in 2014.

**wailordfan** (9): I thought the lack of Zedd flair until the outro was kinda genius. However, lyrically the song is an (iconic) mess there.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (8.5): this got a 8.5 instead of a 1 cause Zedd

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): Other than her bad annunciation on the hook and some elements of the production suffering from EDM syndrome, this is a huge sounding bop, it's meant to shake your ass on a dancefloor and I'll do it gladly

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Some awkward lyrics hold this back a bit but Zedd's production really shines.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Throwback to "guess the tune" where this was the 2nd song and everyone guessed it within 2 seconds

**luigi\_is\_better** (8): used to hate this song, then think it's the best thing ever and now i like it very much but it's not even in my top 5 of the album. i love the mv tho.

**OwenKam50** (8): lyrics don’t make sense but daddy zedd slay

**skiddos** (8): Kinda dated, but forever a bop

**blue\_heart\_** (7.5): the intro reminds me of airhorns. slay zaddy :tongue:. on a serious note, this is one of the only singles I've heard on the radio here that I still like. I don't like overplay at all.

**henry413** (7): You know the lyrics are bad when you are glad that Ariana's enunciation prevented you from hearing them correctly.

**jess\_22** (7): "now that I've become who I really are" annoys me more than it should

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (6): this is not the album's gay anthem

**cyborglilith** (6): DEDUCTED FOUR POINTS FOR THE HORRIBLE ELECTRONIC INTRO

**Magic\_warlock0-** (5): It’s an okay song, but once again, Ariana’s enunciation leaves a bit to be desired, and I really don’t like the echo off the end of the chorus or the song.

**VeganSquash** (5): generic!

Just like the winner of the Ultimate 2016 rate, this song immediately went to the #1 spot in the voting and refused to budge. Its lead was huge at one point - I think it got to like 50 total points above "One Last Time" - and while that gap got smaller as voting went on, even now it's comfortably in the top spot. I don't think too many people thought it would win; some people definitely wanted it to, but not many thought it had what it took to go all the way.

But it did. And what a song it is - titallting but also dark and atmospheric, playing off of the inherent sexiness of its two singers to create a song that's at once restrained but full of erotic energy. ("Love" is quite obviously a euphemism for a different four-letter word.) It's also bound to be remembered in both of their discographies, being one of Ariana's biggest hits and a major force in launching The Weeknd's career. And now it's made its mark on our subreddit, by comfortably winning this rate. After the first rate, I think it's fitting that Ariana finally gets her place in the winners circle. Now @everyone go stream "Everyday" on Spotify.

---
**bluehxrizon** (11): sensual, anthemic, and powerful, this is essentially Into You's little sister

**CharmingArsenal** (11): I wanted to give my 11 to Carly so bad, but THIS SONG had to fucking exist. The Weeknd owes his superstardom to this song, I knew he'd be famous when I heard Trilogy, but once this song came out I knew he'd be huge.

**cyborglilith** (11): THIS SONG IS THE REASON I EVEN DECIDED TO DO THE RATE if it doesn't get top 5 I'm quitting this trashy sub (but not rly tho) because Abel's voice is way smoother than I thought and it's literally my third favorite song ever and I heard that they made it a single just to make Abel a star but it's actually the best song on the album.

**fifthchevron** (11): Doesn't get any better than this. Absolute pop perfection from start to finish.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): FLAWLESS SONG WITH 2 OF MY FAVOURITE ARTISTS. This song was one of the first songs I heard with the Weeknd so I will forever be grateful. But honestly, is a great duet between the 2 of them and I think it's one of her best songs too. Also it's a great transition song to the Dangerous Woman era.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Ari's best song ever, oh my god. This song basically invented sex.

**Johnnytoby** (11): i cant wait for all too well to win over this masterpiece :(

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (11): This is actually my favorite from the album. I adore this so much, It's so understated yet so powerful. And it's obviously sexy as hell. And The Weeknd actually doesn't disappoint here, he actually helps this song a lot. I love how this R&B singer who's usually so raw and explicit is taken aback by Ariana and the two play off each other perfectly. I absolutely love the hell out of this.

**Qwilphish** (11): This song is so good, easily the best single off the album. The chorus is soooo smooth. Abel easily bumps this track from good to great, their chemistry and voices blend so well together. Everything just works and if it isn't at least top 5 it'll be a tragedy for good taste.

**RandomPotatos** (11): Ariana SHINES in this song and even makes the Weeknd look sexually inferior. I wasn't sure she could top this until Into You came out.

**skiddos** (11): If this isn’t pop perfection, I don’t know what is.

**strawberryswing1** (11): Two amazing vocalists showing off their talents.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): If I had to make a sex playlist this would be one of the first songs I put on it, these two could have had a thrown together collab but this is honestly really well done, the chemistry is good, the production is good, the hook is ICONIC, and both of their vocals just kill me. One of the sexiest songs ever and the best in this rate, definitely

**TragicKingdom1** (11): One of the songs in my "dark pop" hall of fame (other examples being Chandelier and Cool For The Summer). Ari and Abel have excellent chemistry.

---

**10footnotes** (10): Some of the later songs on My Everything are too musically busy, but this one isn’t in any way. The production is top-notch, Ariana and The Weeknd’s deliveries are silky smooth (especially Ariana in the first verse), and the explosion into the chorus is a great moment. Side note: I remember a younger me being shook by how explicit The Weeknd’s verse was when this came out.

**awryj** (10): The pulsing synths and the descending melody of the chorus are just great. Also I know it was popular but I think I've heard it only once before, but it just amplifies the bop factor for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Hot. Anyone who says that the Weeknd outshines Ariana on this song is fooling themselves, she owns this track and she turns him into a prop. He’s not bad bad, but she’s just so amazing that it’s hard to think of anyone else when she’s doing her thing. I personally never took this song to be that dirty, I know it’s clearly meant to be an innuendo but I’ve always taken it to be more about putting more into a relationship. You know, do all that love stuff, but harder. But maybe that’s because I’m a prude, I dunno. Regardless, Ariana gets an amazing soundscape and partner to play with and she utilizes both to the fullest. One thing that I super appreciate about this is that part where they trade lines back and forth during the bridge, it’s the coolest part of the song because the Weeknd sounds genuinely frightened Ariana sounds like this ethereal demon who’s going to destroy the Weeknd if he isn’t good enough for her. Not of enough collabs have interaction between the people on the track. It’s also by far Ariana’s most tasteful video, I really like this sort of “dark and dirty, careful and calculated seductress” aesthetic and I’m glad this is what carried over to Dangerous Woman.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Abel is great on here, and the duet is just amazing. I like this song a lot, but maybe not as much as everyone else - I just expected a ton from a Weeknd feature, and this is a great song, but not my favorite on the album.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): In a decade where pure RnB has blended into either pop or hip hop to the point of being not very noticeable at all, this manages to be a true classic that ends up being so much more than another Weeknd song with gross double meanings. I thought this song was too overplayed back in the day but now I can replay it.

**triptoyourheart** (10): I wanna have sex to this song one day, it's so sensual. I wish there was an explicit version where she sings "Fuck me fuck me fuck me harder harder harder". Also this is one of the few instances where The Weeknd's voice doesn't annoy the shit out of me.

**twat\_brained** (10): Ari's sultry vocals, Abel's fantastic tenor, Max Martin's musical excellence, if I could give two 11s this would be my second! Pure pop brilliance! Also, fuck off, Bette Midler. You peaked with *Hocus Pocus*.

**raicicle** (9): It’s essentially a precursor to “Into You”, powered by those same huge icy Swedish synths that Max Martin and his posse engineered. I’d give it an even higher score, but I’m not too hot on the feature courtesy of The Weeknd, who provides a perfectly serviceable appearance but Ariana’s reliance on having high-profile guest stars errs at times as being unwilling to carry a song entirely with her own plentiful personality.

**superr\_rad** (9): this video is nothing short of a blessing. this could be the precursor to touch it cause it pretty much matches its level of horniness. also im still digging the theory that ari and abel used to hook up bc let me have my fantasies

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): This song gave both of these artists what they wanted. The Weeknd got his pop crossover at the right time (with either Often or Earned It also blowing up around this time, can't remember which one, maybe both?), and Ariana got to make music about "adult" stuff to escape from the innocent girl thing she had going on. The result is slightly underwhelming: I'd expect these two to produce an easy 10, but overall it's still a good, catchy song with some great vocals from both of them.

---

**Piccprincess** (9): Okay I'd let Abel fuck love me harder

**therokinrolla** (9): honk me honk me harder

**lexarqade** (8): I hate the phrase "Pressure between your hips." Like you got a hernia? Hemorrhoids? Y'all need to see doctors.

**zamomattel** (10): Ariana Grande, tonight you showed us that you sound fantastic any day of the week, not just The Weeknd. You're safe.

letsallpoo: 

**dirdbub** (10): so glad this song could spawn the banger of the decade, “The Hills”,

**dropthehammer11** (10): A B E L ily

**Elitefourbrad** (10): Their voices work so well together, it’s a beautiful melody of voices. One of the best duets of all time. Abel is such a great addition to this album!

**enecks** (10): This is pop perfection. Crisp production, catchy vibes, a general good atmosphere. The Weeknd is good in this.

**islimp** (10): I'm obligated to give this a 10 since it was

**jess\_22** (10): modern pop perfection

**lady\_sable** (10): did yall know that Kidz Bop did a cover of this

**luigi\_is\_better** (10): this is one of my fav singles of 2014. it was everywhere back then but to this day i can't skip it when it's in a playlist/my queue.

**mdawgig** (10): A complete bop and the only feature on the entire album that is an unqualified success.

**mokitsu** (10): her best single, truly a masterpiece

**MrSwearword** (10): despite the seemingly random as fuck guest spot for The Weeknd, this collab works very well. YATH

**musicotic** (10): This girl is chock full of certified bops; 5 on one album alone

**OberionSynth** (10): fuck me up ariana literally plz

**poppinmmolly** (10): loooooove this song. This song is what made me a fan of Ariana.

**reddituser206** (10): better than Into You, fite me popheads

**skargardin** (10): Her best collab so far.

**supersecrettest** (10): Great vibe. Really sexy

**TouchItAG** (10): I remember when I heard this the night the album released, I was shook. Almost got my 11.

**VeganSquash** (10): iconic. Should've had an explicit version called "Fuck Me Harder" though.

**VodkaInsipido** (10): It’s electronic but not completely electronic. The synths are blissful, and both The Weeknd and Ariana offer great vocal performances. Especially Ariana on the hook.

**wailordfan** (10): Their voices work so well together here its amazing

**ComeOnAndSlang** (9.5): love this, they need more songs together

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): They probably fucked low-key tbh.

**johnazoidberg-** (9): This is the song the past few have wanted to be. A great duet that truly feels like it builds into something bigger.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the innuendos are so out there and kinda awkward but I can't deny how great the melodies in this are.

**OwenKam50** (8): A rare moment when a feature improves the song

**skyblade79** (8): they both sound amazing, though the song is a bit cheesy!

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): i still cant fucking believe Kidz Bop covered this lmfao

**BlasiFeelsSwift** (6): nice

**Leixander** (6): Less cringy than the other CERTAIN song. Weeknd kind of saves this.

**BEARS\_WILL\_EAT\_YOU** (5): I like the Weeknd's part.

**blue\_heart\_** (3): I've figured out why I don't like this song; it's about sex, that much is obvious. It's just not sexy. It doesn't do sex as well as Rihanna does; it doesn't even begin to compare to songs like Partition. I can get more slutty to at least 1 Lorde song.

**Magic\_warlock0-** (3): Ariana at her most unintelligible, it took me forever to fully understand her lyrics hear. I never really liked the Weeknd’s part on here; sex god he ain’t.

animefangrant62: The only one of those with a poppy enough sound to get mass support is probably Mean, but it's heavy country twang will immediately be off putting to some.

InfernalSolstice: Well Yours Truly is almost all filler and Tug of War is folk so it's not like either of those would win either. I think the winner would be able to have a low enough average for a ballad to win.

=====

InfernalSolstice: Yeah it probably would be a little dull. Speak Now really is a fantastic album, my favorite Taylor Swift one, but there is pretty heavy country influence and a decent amount of ballads. Yours Truly does also have some good songs, though they may sound dated now (and again the highlight is a ballad, Tattooed Heart). Haven't touched Tug of War in years, but at the very least it would get us all to actually listen to an album by one of our faves.

animefangrant62: As someone who tried to be fair and balanced towards the albums I didn't care for and didn't overrate Taylor just so she'd win, I'm very proud of my ranking at 77 on that list and my average score being around 6.6.

qtsarahj: I'm actually surprised how close I am to the bottom lmao. I didn't rate a ton of things super well because tbh Carly and Ari's albums are preeeetty bad after hearing Dangerous Woman and Emotion first. In saying that, my average for both of them was over 6, and my average for Taylor's was 7. I gave Taylor my highest scores but also my lowest. I thought compared to everyone else's scores I'd be higher up because it seems like others consistently scored 0-4 more than me? I guess I just didn't give away as many 8-10s. Also I didn't use my 0 coz I don't think any of the songs really deserved it.

TeamAwesome4: Well, as far as I'm concerned, the placements for this rate were super disappointing up till the very end.  Y'all have no taste.  That being said:

HAPPY 1 YEAR OF RATING ALBUMS, POPHEADS!  Can't wait to see what trash scores everyone makes in the coming year!

And a special shoutout to /u/letsallpoo for hosting both the first and the latest rates with grace in the face of high drama.

blue_heart_: Hey guys,

Well, the results are in. I disagree with them, but I'm not going to say they're rigged or anything; that was always just a joke to me. It's clear that Ariana has some great songs in this rate and her fans valiantly represented them with their scores. I never expected to "win" this rate, hell, my 11 went to a song that was in the bottom 5. I will myself consider Red the better album for probably a long time, but you convinced me to maybe give My Everything another chance. Yes, including Intro.

Now to the point. I made a really dumb joke about Manchester. It's totally on me. Yeah, everyone was in a rage over All Too Well, but I was the one who said it, and I can't push responsibility on any circumstance.

This is potentially *the* stupidest thing I've ever said. I can't stress enough how much I regret it, how much I regret mocking an attack that cost lives and probably traumatized a lot more survivors. I'm here to make my apology.

The word apology derives from the Greek apologia, which means defense, so maybe it's kind of inaccurate to use here. I don't mean to defend what I did. I only mean to say sorry and hope you can forgive me.

To make up for it, I've purchased both Ariana's live cover of Somewhere Over the Rainbow from Manchester, plus today's ~~decisive winner~~  runner up (what happened there? the real upset of today) One Last Time, proceeds from both of which will go towards the victims of Manchester.

Receipts (literally):

Special thanks to;

/u/mudkip1, for getting it through my thick skull that I really really crossed a line.

/u/nerdy_boy_chris, for being a gracious winner, a trait that's almost more valuable than a gracious loser.

/u/letsallpoo for being a great host. 

I hope you all can forgive me.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I can't believe my nap was 6 hours that I missed the results.

I love the results. ATW having multiple 11s, only to come out at #6 is tragic. But I am glad I stan the superior song that is State of Grace, coming out gracefully at #4.

A Top 3 Ariana would have angered me if Problem is still in so I stan this trio. I wished Break Free won ugh.

Anyway, I am glad y'all liked the videos I made for this rate.
