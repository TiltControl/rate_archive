The One Year Anniversary Rate: Red vs. Kiss vs. My Everything
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6r1xag/the_one_year_anniversary_rate_red_vs_kiss_vs_my/

Roughly [one year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/4xmic6/rate_1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman/) to this day, I posted a thread here announcing a new forum-wide game that I would be hosting. I took the idea from ATRL (but I think they took it from Popjustice, so whatever), and its concept was simple: A group of users would listen to three albums, assign each song a score, and then I would find the averages and reveal them in that order. Conceptually, it didn't sound that exciting. And some users in the thread were perplexed by the appeal and the methodology. But nevertheless, I persisted, and when the actual reveal began, we quickly learned how entertaining and dramatic these rates could be.

I chose *1989*, *Emotion*, and *Dangerous Woman* for our first rate for a number of reasons. They were all released in a different year, and I believed them to be the defining pop album of their respective year. I also believed them all to be fantastic pop albums that the sub adored, and I thought it would be the best way to advertise the idea. I still stand by this decision, even if the grouping seems kind of strange; in many ways is this sub built upon the careers of these three individuals, and it was fitting to base our first rate off of them. 

And what better way to commemorate the anniversary of that rate than to do it all over again?

#Taylor Swift - Red (2012)

It's taken for granted now how much of a pop force Taylor Swift is, but things were different in 2012. That's not to mean that Taylor didn't have a boatload of accomplishments, including a Grammy AOTY award, an album that debuted with over a million sales, and multiple top 10 crossover hits. But Taylor felt like more of an interesting side show to the spectacle that was the pop zeitgeist, an anomaly of an artist who could turn out solid music and was undeniably successful but who never truly commanded the music scene. Part of this was due to *Speak Now*'s singles underperforming; another reason could just be the fleeting popularity of country-twanged music on the charts.

Then she released "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," and Taylor became the ringleader. Aside from its chart dominance straight out the gate (it's one of the few songs to debut at #1), the song was praised for its ability to marry Swift's country sound with a poppier sensibility. It was sassy and charming and full of hooks and ad libs - and it was so unlike typical country music fare because it refused to play into their female tropes of wistful lonliness or searing anger. Most strikingly, it was uniquely *cool* in a way Taylor had never been before. The rest of the songs followed smoothly: "I Knew You Were Trouble." takes on dubstep and matches its brashness with equal emotion, and "22" is an anthemic party song that's still referenced to this day. Much of the album is fantastic, especially the songs that shied away from turning full-on pop and remained distinctly country. "Begin Again" is a slow-burning reacceptance of love coming from a broken heart, and "All Too Well" may be Taylor's greatest ballad, a five-minute long saga from initial attraction to heartbreak that flows like poetry. In the end, *Red* is what made Taylor a star. Sure *1989* was huge, but *Red* set the foundation for Taylor as a pop artist.

#Carly Rae Jepsen - Kiss (2012)

I can't help feeling amused when I see people post about how they want Carly Rae Jepsen to go full-on disco for her next album, because she already did it. The aesthetic of *Kiss* is disco at its heart, but it's also undeniable bubblegum pop fare that oftentimes feels targeted to individuals 10-20 years younger than Carly. The album's origins, as with most things related to Carly, can be traced back to "Call Me Maybe," which became the unlikeliest of hits and suddenly launched Carly's career. *Kiss* was rush released in order to capitalize off of the success of its lead single, and the hastiness shows in a lot of the songs. But I consider *Kiss* to be wholly underrated, because even with the limited time Carly had, she still created a nuanced pop album that contains some amazing tracks. "Turn Me Up" has an innuendo for a title yet is a moody plea for connection to a faraway love. "This Kiss," the followup single to "Call Me Maybe" that was doomed to fail, is pure disco perfection. 

I became a massive Carly fan in 2012. It all started when I clicked on a random article linked to ATRL that called "Call Me Maybe" a perfect pop song, even when it just had 200k views. I was immediately hooked (if not just because the video had a hot gay shirtless dude) and sent it to my friends who similarly enjoyed the ending of the video. But I also loved the song, because it truly was a perfect pop song, and all that Carly has done since (*Kiss* and *Emotion* included) lends to the idea that Carly has always had a knack for pop music - lyrics, production, delivery, everything - despite her limiations as a marketable personality. Carly was always great, even in 2012 - it just took a while for people to realize that.

#Ariana Grande - My Everything (2014)

For the general public, *My Everything* was their introduction to the petite chanteuse with a powerful voice, Ariana Grande. *Yours Truly* was a great debut, but with her sophomore album, Ariana launched herself into the pop stratosphere. A string of smash hits kept Ariana's angelic voice on constant rotation on the radio: "Problem," "Break Free," "Love Me Harder," "Bang Bang," and even though "One Last Time" underperformed a bit, it has still become one of her defining songs in the wake of the Manchester incident. *My Everything* is easily the most successful album in this rate in terms of singles, but as an album it still has its gems. Much of it combines her past R&B style with hip hop and pop, and there's also collaborations galore - "Best Mistake" is a smooth, moody, piano-driven track featuring current ex Big Sean, and "Break Your Heart Right Back" is the sassy followup with silly quips from Childish Gambino.

The biggest criticism aimed towards Ariana during this era, aside from her enunciation and underwhelming music videos, was her dependency on collaborations. On one hand, this is a fair criticism, as all of her hit singles featured someone else in the title. But it was Ariana who ultimately became the breakout star, and her rising popularity was undampened by the collaborators she was carrying along with her. She's one of the biggest artists in the world now, and she has a long and fruitful career ahead of her.

Most of y'all probably know what to do now. But even if you do, please read through this through anyway, because some things have changed:

* Listen to EVERY song (yes, even the random Japanese bonus tracks) and assign it a score from 1 to 10, inclusive. You may use decimals **BUT only if it ends with a 0.5**. Please don't give 8.7s or 4.65s, but feel free to give 3.5s and 9.5s. You can change your scores at any time - just PM me again.
* You are allowed to give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is one song for the entire rate, NOT one per album. These are optional and are meant to signify your favorite and least favorite song.
* I will be enforcing a minimum average for this rate. That means that if your average for any given album is below a certain threshold, I won't accept your scores and you'll have to resend them. I also reserve the right to reject your scores if I think you're intentionally trying to sabotage the results and not just rating songs based on how well you like them. You're allowed to dislike an album, but you're not allowed to be obnoxious about it.
* Also don't give every song on an album a 10 or something like that. Have some nuance in your scores.
* Use [the preprepared link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=letsallpoo&subject=One%20Year%20Anniversary%20Rate&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Red%0A%0AState%20Of%20Grace%3A%0A%0ARed%3A%0A%0ATreacherous%3A%0A%0AI%20Knew%20You%20Were%20Trouble.%3A%0A%0AAll%20Too%20Well%3A%0A%0A22%3A%0A%0AI%20Almost%20Do%3A%0A%0AWe%20Are%20Never%20Ever%20Getting%20Back%20Together%3A%0A%0AStay%20Stay%20Stay%3A%0A%0AThe%20Last%20Time%20%28feat.%20Gary%20Lightbody%29%3A%0A%0AHoly%20Ground%3A%0A%0ASad%20Beautiful%20Tragic%3A%0A%0AThe%20Lucky%20One%3A%0A%0AEverything%20Has%20Changed%20%28feat.%20Ed%20Sheeran%29%3A%0A%0AStarlight%3A%0A%0ABegin%20Again%3A%0A%0AThe%20Moment%20I%20Knew%3A%0A%0ACome%20Back...%20Be%20Here%3A%0A%0AGirl%20At%20Home%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Kiss%0A%0ATiny%20Little%20Bows%3A%0A%0AThis%20Kiss%3A%0A%0ACall%20Me%20Maybe%3A%0A%0ACuriosity%3A%0A%0AGood%20Time%20%28with%20Owl%20City%29%3A%0A%0AMore%20Than%20a%20Memory%3A%0A%0ATurn%20Me%20Up%3A%0A%0AHurt%20So%20Good%3A%0A%0ABeautiful%20%28feat.%20Justin%20Bieber%29%3A%0A%0ATonight%20I%27m%20Getting%20Over%20You%3A%0A%0AGuitar%20String%20/%20Wedding%20Ring%3A%0A%0AYour%20Heart%20is%20a%20Muscle%3A%0A%0ADrive%3A%0A%0AWrong%20Feels%20So%20Right%3A%0A%0ASweetie%3A%0A%0AI%20Know%20You%20Have%20a%20Girlfriend%3A%0A%0AAlmost%20Said%20It%3A%0A%0AMelt%20With%20You%3A%0A%0APicture%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20My%20Everything%0A%0AIntro%3A%0A%0AProblem%20%28feat.%20Iggy%20Azalea%29%3A%0A%0AOne%20Last%20Time%3A%0A%0AWhy%20Try%3A%0A%0ABreak%20Free%20%28feat.%20Zedd%29%3A%0A%0ABest%20Mistake%20%28feat.%20Big%20Sean%29%3A%0A%0ABe%20My%20Baby%20%28feat.%20Cashmere%20Cat%29%3A%0A%0ABreak%20Your%20Heart%20Right%20Back%20%28feat.%20Childish%20Gambino%29%3A%0A%0ALove%20Me%20Harder%20%28with%20The%20Weeknd%29%3A%0A%0AJust%20a%20Little%20Bit%20of%20Your%20Heart%3A%0A%0AHands%20On%20Me%20%28feat.%20A%24AP%20Ferg%29%3A%0A%0AMy%20Everything%3A%0A%0ABang%20Bang%20%28with%20Jessie%20J%20%26%20Nicki%20Minaj%29%3A%0A%0AOnly%201%3A%0A%0AYou%20Don%27t%20Know%20Me%3A%0A%0ACadillac%20Song%3A%0A%0AToo%20Close%3A%0A%0AEND) to send in your scores. I'll be using the program (since I made it lol) and while I'll still accept your scores if it's not properly formatted, I'll be mildly annoyed for two and a half minutes if you choose not to.
* You may (and are encouraged to!) include comments with your scores. To include a comment, just write it directly after your score, like this:

> Problem (feat. Iggy Azalea): 0 Absolutely not. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.

* Please don't write tons of excessively long comments for multiple songs. I want to include everyone's comments but if they get too long it becomes hard to do so.
* You may (and are also encouraged to!) include comments for particular albums. Feel free to write assays for these. To include a comment, add a colon and write it directly on the album line, like this:

> Album: Kiss: Absolutely not. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.

* PM it all to me. Then just sit tight until the reveal begins some time in September!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask below. I'll be accepting scores until the end of the month - I'm not going to give a set time because even if I did I would probably extend it, but don't be a shitter and just try to get it in before September starts.
