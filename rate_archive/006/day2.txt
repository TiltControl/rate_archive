MrSwearword: It'll mostly be Demi and Selena getting FUCKT today. Not like the 15 today can comprise the rest of Bangerz. I can hope but it's most unlikely.

=====

MrSwearword: GETITRIGHT got a 4 from me so it might be out at some point. Drive did get the highest score on Bangerz with a 7 so it might hang in there. As for "Maybe You're Right"...have faith in "Drive".

=====

MrSwearword: If a Smiler or Lovatic had screenshots from those in their profiles, yes "iconic" could be a word to describe them. Other than that 0 and 1.

=====

MrSwearword: Who got it worse in Commas' thread? Katy'd or Kesha'd? I think it's Misterwives'd from the indiepop one.
[/r/popheads/comments/5hmb1t/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_2/db18ph6/]

=====

TeamAwesome4: Despite the fact that Katy got #4, her songs were killed off earlier without a doubt.  Also, Misterwives landed #2 and #3 under the obvious winner since the rate was announced, so I don't think that should really count.
[/r/popheads/comments/5hmb1t/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_2/db18v8l/]

=====

MrSwearword: So it's 1989'd, Katy'd, Shakira'd and Marina'd. Lexicon on fleek.
[/r/popheads/comments/5hmb1t/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_2/db190wp/]

NapsAndNetflix: tbh they weren't all 10's but I didn't want them to get THAT low of an average score. If it were a country rate some of them would have gotten like, an 8 instead.

deleted: Ngl I still follow all of them on snapchat bc they are kinda cute. 

I feel really bad for them bc they are all like 18 and think they are gonna live just by making porn and the harsh truth is that most of them will be fired in like a year and they will have to go into the daddy/son part of the industry. 

Then, they will be forgotten by the time they are 25 and they will have no real-life skills that will help them get a job.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another Miley ballad - sweet, enjoyable production with one of Miley's best vocal performances on this album, but there's not much more to say beyond that.

**Wailordfan** likes sad Miley: "It’s a fine ballad-y thing. Good slow jam. I think I like slower tempo more down to earth Miley. I mean, do you Miley, but this is what I like."

**witchyaf** also enjoys vulnerable Miley: "i like miley most when she's sad and introspective, both of which this song has in spades. the chorus gives me chills honestly"

**TeamAwesome4** continues the praise: "This song it great, with soaring backing vocals and a level of maturity the public doesn’t expect out of her, but the kind most of us know she’s quite capable of."

**mirandacrocsgrove** came around to liking a Mike-Will song: "I love how vulnerable she sounds here. Perhaps the only #mikewillmadeit production I didn’t trash."

**ExtraEater** draws a comparison: This is kinda similar to her old work a la "Meet Miley Cyrus"

**SkyBlade79** relates the song to the past: "This song doesn’t belong on this album at all. This sounds like old Miley; what’s the point of switching genres if you’re just going to do the same type of song?"

**Doc** thinks this track "this should have been the closer of this album". Agreed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This sounds like a song Demi could've recorded back in 2005 when she did "Moves Me". The song is actually about someone back in her school days. The trumpets are really nice in this song. 

**Jopalopa** finds the song to be enjoyable: "This song's a lot of fun. This is exactly the sort of energy that a kiss-off song to an ex should have - over-the-top happiness and borderline schadenfreude. Yep, he's got the blues - although it's hard to think anyone could have the blues from a song this catchy."

**calltehshots**: "highkey embarrassing that she wrote such a dramatic song about her high school crush when she was 13 but it’s also a bop so it’s okay" Honestly, it's probably more embarrassing that she actually released it ten years later.

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "Sounds like the writers didn't know if they wanted to appeal to underdog high-schoolers or kindergarteners learning to rhyme"

**joshually** gets a little graphic: "If Amy Winehouse came back from the grave to record a new song under the control of a voodoo witch priestess necromancer, it would be this song. Unfortunately, the corpse was rotting and missing most of its essential parts, including a working vocal cord and ears."

**havanabrown** is blown away: "At first I was like ur not Amy Winehouse stop trying gurl but then I'm like oh!! Yes he DOES have the blues!!!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last *Bangerz* bonus track of the rate is out now! I love how funky the production is and how perky the lyrics are. Sure, it's the inferior Pharrell song, but it still deserved to be on the standard version.

**Raykel** loves it: "This is the first time I'm listening to this and holy shit this bangs. That bass. That funky guitar that pefectly harmonizes it. That lyrical sassiness. That melody. That build up on the final chorus. Why is this only on the deluxe? Why was this not a single? Questions only suitable for the FBI."

**Therokinrolla** mentioned the song's pseudo-inspo feeling: "It’s a bop no doubt, but this sounds like a white suburban mom tried to make an inspirational anthem"

**havanabrown**: "Oh those MJ influences are strong in this. Also, “3 knocks at the door (KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK)” is great I replayed that like 5 times"

**witchyaf**: "this song fuckin bops in a car when you're trying to feel all cool and independent"

**JohnnyToby** asked: "Who hurt her?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was one of the songs Selena worked on with Hit-Boy in Mexico. It's probably obvious that she wanted this to sound like Latin pop. Unfortunately, the production is all over the place. A jam nonetheless. Also, the bridge is amazing.

**senatorknope** has lost interest: "I think they might have front-loaded this record"

**PM_ME_HOT_FOREARMS**: "Sounds like a JLo knockoff, and still it sounds better than an actual JLo song. Does that make sense?"
I do not deserve to witness this kind of slander right before my eyes.

**BearlyEvenAPun** is a little confused: "I thought we already destroyed Shakira in a rate?"

**calltehshots**: "This song is so corny and stupid but also makes me want to do messy things with your dad so…"

**havanabrown**: "Just another Selenaverage song"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "This is like if only Camila sang work from home"

**MrSwearword**: “You want to be pressed down? No problem; you rip off “Spanish Lesson” by Madonna, so fuck off into the sea.”

**BlasiFeelsSwift** gives a little lesson: "but why is there a spanish guitar there? W h y? It does not fit at all. The whole song has like a latino vibe but the spanish guitar is giving me flamenco/paco de lucía vibes and it confuses the hell out of me. Nice production."

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xLuN0beLp0)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Demi wrote this song with intention of having it be played in weddings--to be a song of embrace and acceptance of a person's significant other. I don't think anyone would play Demi Lovato at a wedding, but the song is still sweet. In retrospect, this song is kinda sad considering that she was waiting for Wilmer to propose to her for so long. 

**JohnnyToby**: "poor demi just wanted handy manny"

**joshually** does not approve: "The pitch of her voice in this song is torturous. She sounds like she's trying to be sultry and/or confident and/or vulnerable, but despite all of these attempts, she just sounds desperate and shrill, like me during last call on a Saturday night in The Castro."

**Jopalopa**: "Yeah, this isn't very good. I think it fails because it's a bit too simple, too on-the-nose to make for a good love song. The verses are just short lines, and then the chorus tries to cram in everything and it feels unbalanced. And the sound is... eh? Nothing really works."

**superr_rad**: "…..nah"

**unreliablecynic** is bored: "Why does she always have so many shitty pop ballads"

Lowest scores: (0 x1): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy; (1 x2): joshually, Jopalopa

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t93u0qg5q_M)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The harps in this song sound amazing. The lyrics are very similar to those of Britney's "Perfume". This is the song where Selena's squeaky vocals help convey the pain of the lyrics.

**Jopalopa** makes a comparison that I hadn't thought of at all: "Oh god, I'm gonna get lynched for this one. Well, for starters, my issue isn't with the concept of the cheating boyfriend inspiring bi-curiousity with the girl he's cheating with - it's a good concept, and Little Big Town did it pretty well. No, my issue is that it's never mentioned explicitly that he's cheating - Selena just thinks he is. And as a result, she sounds paranoid as hell, and it makes the bi-curious moments seem like the ravings of a crazy person, which might just the worst way to possibly frame that. Also, it sounds boring, but that's really secondary here."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** drags Selena across the mud: 'What the fuck. For a song that is called Perfect, this should be called Mess. First of all, the production, the vocals and the hook feel very out of sync for me that it's quite difficult for me to finish this song. The lyric "I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too" made me laugh, in a very bad way because this song is supposed to be emotional.' 

**qetaz**: "lyrics are annoying. Selena’s lack of vocal ability shows here."

**awhile2**: "all the best songs on this album sound like they were written for artists other than selena gomez. This song sounds seriously beautiful though"

**bluehxrizon** is probably screaming right now: "this is amazing. the production is so icy and pretty" 

**witchyaf**: "are you fucking kidding me??? selena gomez picks up a harp and changes the sad-girl longing bop game. shit's sooooooo good. i remember when i first heard this song somewhere along the way and it convinced me to buy the album."

**MrSwearword**: "The setup has been presented and my sweet tooth can’t handle low hanging fruit like that."

**NapsAndNetflix** simply says: "You perfect Selina"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Miley isn't the only one who sings about her dead petz! Demi dedicated this song to her tiny dog Buddy. I adore everything about this song: the stomping production, the reassuring lyricism, and the way she sings LIIIIIOOOONHEAAAAARRRTTT.

**Jopalopa**: "This is a really good ballad. Yes, its use of the "knight-in-shining-armour" trope as a metaphor is cheesy as hell, but Demi absolutely knows that, and she's having as much fun with it as possible. It doesn't quite rise to the upper level of Demi songs, but it's very underrated and maybe even could've made a good single..."

**Wailordfan** is a bit concerned: "For a lot of songs that sound epic and soulful, these are really just making me want to go to bed now. Her voice sounds so strained at points during these songs, it makes me wonder if she loses her voice during concerts often, because I couldn’t imagine stretching like that multiple times a night for months, back to back."

**BearlyEvenAPun** defends their 11: "Yes, it's a pretty run of the mill ballad, but you can really tell that she put in her all here"

**calltehshots**: "omg okay celine lovato"

**havanabrown**: "Fight song?" (How funny is it that multiple songs from *Confident* could be related to "Fight Song"? lol)

**unreliablecynic**: "Your light is inside of me ;)" Wow. Hot.

**superr_rad** just replied with an [image](http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/File:Mayor_Lionheart.png). Miss me with that furry shit.

Yeah, we all know her personal history. This is like a party version of "Skyscraper". It could've used a better drop for sure. 

**joshually** still wants Bully Demi to stop: "Autobiographical story of Demi's life as an out-of-control bully, waiting in a dark alley to jump her poor backup dancer under suspicion of hooking up with her former Jonas Bros. boo, and how that little nagging violent demon is always inside of you, tempting, tantalizing, taunting..."

**PM_ME_HOT_FOREARMS**: "She's trying too hard to be 2edgy4me here."

**JohnnyToby** is surprised: "OH SHIT nvm this is ok…I don’t remember there being more ok songs o:"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "[dam son]( https://i.imgur.com/9H7xfUY.jpg) I was not expecting that drop"

**timothy444** brings about some shade: "I was about to give this a one because she sounded like Miley Cyrus"

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQNqaERUYy4)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jk lmnop I lied. Demi gets another elimination for her very punchy Kelly Clarkson-esque ballad. Yet another song in which Demi shouts, but it fits well with the bold promises she's making in this song. Also, she said she [worked with Max Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y17GuBnr8ws) on the song, but he's nowhere to be seen in the song's credits. [Hmm](https://media.giphy.com/media/NORFfJzhC6iPe/giphy.gif). (By the way, to all five Demi stans here - I definitely recommend this series of videos explaining the *Confident* tracks.)  

**senatorknope** is not a fan of the boisterous chorus: "The verses are clever, and Demi sounds gorgeous. You can really hear nuance in her voice. Then I’m being blasted off into space, and not in a good way. The wall of sound on the choruses is way too much."

**Wailordfan** thinks quite the common thought: "She has such a nice voice, but these songs are so average."

**sjoors** thinks the same: "Demi has a great voice and she werks it here but it's just so exhausting to listen to."

**3rdattemptusername** is unimpressed by the lyricism, saying that the song is full of "bold claims that mean absolutely nothing."

**superr_rad** agrees: "so dramatic just like demi's twitter /sorry for the shade"

**Therokinrolla** quite likes it: "slay me hunnie yous a queen. I love the explosion the chorus has"

Demi got quite creative with the lyrics. **TeamAwesome4** says: "Nobody needs your heart nailed to a ceiling, Demi. That’s not even a thing that people say. The outro is awesome."

**NapsAndNetflix** puts his heart out: "I would do anything for you Demi"

Several more people enjoyed the punch this song packs.

**gannade**: "A hidden gem. What a bop. It’s a light on the ears but at the same time packs so much anthemic power."

**bluehxrizon**: "the high note in the final chorus omg I’m shook"

**witchyaf**: "this song has a really victorious sound to it but lyrically is sad, which i think is pretty cool and interesting. i'm actually really into this song. it's engaging and it shifts enough to keep up a good pace."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yet another one of my favorite Miley songs takes an exit. This song bangs. **This** is what you call a '[banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtW7eaSvd6A)'. The lyrics really brought home the pain of her (former) break-up with Liam. A good deal of *Bangerz* ballads had production that was too perky for the lyrics. Although the production for this song is heavily electronic, it perfectly fits the dark, messy, and broken atmosphere of the lyrics.

**Jopalopa** understands the song but does not think it compares well with the album's other ballads: "Look, I can appreciate this song's ambitions, and I'll admit it's definitely well-written. But like many of the slower songs on Bangerz, it's not interesting and it's not fun to listen to - and considering the ones that actually work, that's a shame."

**Wailordfan** thinks the song is quite unique: "I can’t believe I’ve been sleeping on this album for so long. A lot of these songs are really great. Especially this one. Her voice has been a continual highlight of this album. Its sound is so unique, and is so soothing to listen to. This song really showcases it with Wrecking Ball."

**chihuahuazero**: "“But I guess I got no valentine, Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die.” Look up the Genius annotation for that one and check its contributors." [Oh hey, who's that I see there?](http://prntscr.com/dhfi0x)

Our poet **joshually**: "There's an inherent sadness underlying all that the songs in Bangerz, camouflaged by a raucousness masking vulnerability, and sometimes there are cracks in that facade. This is one of them."

**witchyaf** is amazed: "i love this song honestly, i just wish that crazy percussion intro played into the song more often, it's so fuckin cool. the instrumental of this song is cool the whole way through though, i honestly don't even care that the metaphor is a bit hackneyed"

This was **MrSwearword**'s favorite song on the album: "This beat is infectious. Not as nauseating as the rest of this thing and Miley’s vocals actually don’t suck that much on here."

**havanabrown** thought the song went on for too long: "It went on for way too long like shut up already" **NapsAndNetflix** agrees: "Snoozefest. Queen of making songs too long"

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvSJmY493Ho)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's clear that Selena has made multiple efforts to incorporate her Latina roots into her songs. This is one of those songs. I'd say that this is the most unique song of this entire rate--the production is a peculiar throwback, and the vocal production gives off a sinister tone to the party anthem. The best part is when she says "YES" during the instrumental break. Also, I can't be crazy for thinking that this song sounds like Muse's "[Uprising](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8KQmps-Sog)" right? 

**Raykel**: If Selena ever makes it into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, it's because of this song's intro. This song also has some golden lines, "But you don't understand, I don't need a man... 👏👏👏👏👏"

**joshually**: Theme song of every white girl's bachelorette party located in a gay bar while doing the "sex-related scavenger hunt" with such whimsical items as "a hot guy's number!!" or "selfie with two strangers!!" or "get an old man to buy you a shot!!"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Not even a grill. I want to have my chicas by my side."

**Therokinrolla** defends their 11: "Jesus Christ... this song is so hot. It kinda reminds me of a Lana song"

**ExtraEater** defends their zero: "I hate the strangely dark atmosphere this song has. My 0 sadly has to go to a song from the album I have the highest average on."

**BlasiFeelsSwift** harshly schools Selena on grammar: “Okay, Selena, you want to use spanish in a song for whatever the fuck reason but pls sweetie use it right. So you put a “no jodas nosotras” in the chorus AND THAT’S SO WRONG OH MY GOD DO YOU EVEN KNOW SPANISH,YOU ARE BASICALLY SAYING “DON’T FUCK, US” IF YOU WANT IT TO SAY DON’T FUCK WITH US YOU SAY “NO JODAS CON NOSOTRAS” BUT THAT WOULD BE WEIR BC NO SPANISH PERSON TALKS LIKE THAT EVEN THOUGH IT’S GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT AND ALL THAT SO INSTEAD WE SAY “NO NOS JODAS” AND THAT “JODAS” HAS THE SAME MEANING AS SCREW AS IN YOU FUCKED UP AS IN WHAT YOU DID BY TRYING TO SING IN SPANISH. DID YOU FREAKING USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE OR SOMETHING?”

Some folks are just boppin'.

**havanabrown**: "This song makes me want to shuffle"

**sjoors**: "My anthem when i walk into the club but i'm also lowkey here to hook up and i need a man"

**unreliablecynic** simply says: "The Great Gatsby (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) [Outtakes Edition]"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The better Pharrell track gets its elimination! The song totally sounds like it could've come straight from Pharrell's last album, and that is not bad at all! The song is funky, fresh, and eccentric. The beat makes the song so much more inviting. This is certainly a song one could dance to with no panties on. Miley ran thin of songs pretty quickly on this rate, but I'm glad #GETITRIGHT survived this long! Also, hearing Pharrell doing back-up vocals for this song is pretty nice.

**Wailordfan** thinks another artist is well-suited for this: "I’d love to hear Rihanna cover this song. This sounds so perfect for her. Miley does it pretty well too."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "The song works for me overall save for that spoken interlude and the third verse where she dances in the mirror with no panties on."

**Doc** is boppin': "Dated hashtag title of the song aside, Pharrell Williams hits it again with another bop with his signature production style."

**awhile2**: "no decent song starts with a hashtag. Also this is the most uninspired pharrell beat i've ever heard" Please leave #Beautiful alone.

The song was middling for some.

**TeamAwesome4**: "This title is awful, hashtags do not deserve to be in titles. This song is better because of Pharrell than it is because of Miley. It’s alright overall"

**SkyBlade79**: "The production is a mess, and I hate how so much of this song is just… chanty?"

**senatorknope**: "It's got a decent beat and I can bop along, but nothing stands out musically. Overall it's somewhat #forgettable."

Pretty surprising to see a Target bonus track making it this far into the rate, but after all, this is a jam. The track is packed with fun - probably more lively than most of the songs on the album. 

**MrSwearword** considers himself to be a fan: "THE BEAT DOESN’T SUCK AND HER VOICE ISN’T AS AWFUL AS IT HAS BEEN. PRAISE GAGA."

**Therokinrolla** thinks the complete opposite: "I'd rather die than have this rotting carcus of a pop song ever plague my ears again"

**mirandacrocsgrove** just says: "Cancerous"

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "She's pretty boring here, but the instrumentals are straight fire"

**havanabrown**: "Bitch I'm loco!!! Yes!!"

**Raykel** is not okay now: "It's hard to pull off a violin so fast-paced like that, but yet she pulled off my scalp."

**BlasiFeelsSwift** compliments Selina: "okay this time you used spanish in the right way, great pronunciation too"

**SkyBlade79** compares Selena to his fave: "This one is really good. The chorus is really great and unique, and this actually really reminds me of a Tove Lo song. THIS SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE DANCING IN CIRCLES"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is what a Christian church’s parody of “Good for You” would sound like. I originally thought of this song as very boring until I heard [Selena’s tribute to Christina Grimmie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oulEG1XQ-UY). At that point, I realized the point of the song and have been in love with this track since then. Also, the drums in the chorus are particularly nice. If there’s any song on this rate that makes me feel warm and happy, it’s this one. 

**senatorknope** feels the same: "Gorgeous melody and production. An unexpected favorite."

**TeamAwesome4** feels the comparison is a little awkward: "So apparently this song is about God, which is fine, but that means you can’t say things like “I don’t want nothing else because you showed me the best”. God’s love is in no way similar to romance, and comparing them is pretty weird."

**havanabrown**: "Whispering Selena makes me more emotional than Adele ever could tbh"

**BlasiFeelsSwift** is wowed: "oh fuck this shit is good, why have i never heard this one before?"

**JohnnyToby** says this is his "fave jesus song"

**joshually** is just joshin': "This piano driven ballad showcases Ms. Gomez's strong emotive vocals to powerful effect. Celine who? Mariah what? Whitney when?!? Move over, there's a new chanteuse in town!"

**qetaz**: "I like Selena with this kind of stripped back production way more than her dance tracks"

Others weren't completely sold on it.

**Therokinrolla**: "I recognize this song is good in every single way... I just don't like the way it sounds"

**Doc**: "The song's theme about Selena's love to God is nice. I don't think this is the song I would listen often tho."

**SkyBlade79**: "Maybe if her voice was interesting or good at all this song would be good"

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Hel36qrFI)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The title track of Selena's album is out! This was one of the other songs Selena worked with Hit-Boy on in Mexico. The lyrics speak of Selena recovering from the struggles she faced the two years prior: most notably lupus and the mental effects of dealing with  lupus. I'd imagine this song is even more important to her now seeing that she had to deal with recovery once again after dropping this album. The song starts with Selena doing a spoken word verse with calming beach sounds in the background, then simple drums kick in and the sermon of Rebible begins.

**calltehshots** has been sent to heaven: "I’m astral projecting I’m flying into heaven listening to this hymn and the poetry in the beginning? maya angelou who?"

**Doc** is preparing his weave: A good opener for an album that is about to snatch my weave later on. I hope it's not just me but I noticed an obvious vocal correction on Selena when she sang "MY, MY, MY time to butterfly"

**MrSwearword**: "Well, when she spoke, her voice did possess some projection. Generous scoring.

**cloudbustingmp3**: "gr8 album intro, truly sets the tone for her musical rebirth"

**JohnnyToby**: "Such an amazing intro. Sorry Demi but u over."

**superr_rad** throws a little shade: "This is a solid opener. Bonus points for not rhyming "suicidal" like other artists probably would have"

**ExtraEater**: "No kidding after hearing those first few lyrics I thought I was still rating Bangerz"

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** likes the song despite the intro: "the intro is corny as fuck but the song is great so it balances out"

**Wailordfan** is wet: "The opening is kinda cheesy, but I’m used to it and have learned to appreciate it. The drum intro is so wet though. Also, her ‘butterfly’ makes me drip. This song is so underrated, and honestly, probably one of my favs from the entire album."

Please return to your Taylor flair when this is all done.

I will probably comment less during tomorrow's rate. But I promise, as soon as that number 1 is posted, Taylor is back.

Hogwartsreject1912: 1.) What song?

2.) I'll join in on a bet. The day Cool For the Summer goes out is the day I switch to a Bridget Mendler flair, and start supporting Disney over their much better rival, Nickelodeon. I'll leave the Queen and Nick for Bridgit and Disney. Thank God Cool For the Summer isn't getting out.

Jopalopa: Damn, I missed the drama.

Oh well, I suppose this is a good top 15. Lots of great songs, the bad songs are ones I expected to be here anyway, and the only elimination that really irks me is Mr. Hughes. (I mean, Me & My Girls and Lionheart are both better than Mr. Hughes, but I expected them out, and did not think they'd be higher.) Looking forward to day 3... hopefully I'll remember to show up.^knocks^on^wood
