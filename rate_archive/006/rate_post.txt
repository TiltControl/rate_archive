[RATE] Bangerz vs. Revival vs. Confident
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5aiqwt/rate_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident/

Hi guys, it's your neighborhood goat /u/skiddos here! As you all know, I love the Disney gals. Thus, I will be facilitating /r/popheads’ *Bangerz* vs. *Revival* vs. *Confident* rate. If you want to check out the rest of Miley, Demi, and Selena's discographies, (shameless plug) check out the Disney Channel thread I posted a while ago [[link](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/52dtgq/disney_channel_part_i_a_guide_through_disney/)]. I will be following /u/letsallpoo's format. 

Here are the rules:

1. Listen to the songs from each album. Tracks are listed below.
2. Give each song a score of 1-10. Decimals are fine (between 1 and 10). You get one 0 and one 11 throughout the entire rate. Feel free to add comments, just know that I *will* disclose them :-)
3. After you've finished rating the albums, PM me your scores by November 30th.
4. I will reveal the songs from lowest scoring to highest scoring.
5. The only people bickering will be the 5 other total Miley/Demi/Selena stans in this sub. Unless my master plan ends up working and a lot of people become stans upon rating, in which case I will be expecting a lot of fun (and drama)!

# Miley Cyrus - Bangerz

World famous provocateur Miley Cyrus released her Grammy-nominated fourth album *Bangerz* in 2013. She is the only artist of the three to have a Billboard Hot 100 #1 and a Grammy nomination. However, *Bangerz* also received the lowest Metacritic score of the three albums (61). In this album, Miley transitioned from electropop and dance-pop to pop with country, R&B, and hip-hop flavors. This album's promotion caused an incessant amount of controversy, primarily due to Miley's stage antics. Also worth noting is that this was Miley's first album outside of Hollywood Records. *Bangerz* had three singles: "We Can't Stop" (#2), "Wrecking Ball" (#1), and "Adore You" (#23).

# Selena Gomez - Revival

World famous whisperer Selena Gomez released her second #1 album *Revival* in 2015. In this album, Selena became self-aware and hopped on the whisper R&B train. She is the only artist of the three to have had three Hot 100 top ten hits from a single album. Those hits were: "Good for You" (feat. A$AP Rocky) (#5), "Same Old Love" (#5), and "Hands to Myself" (#7). The album tied with *Confident* critically with a metascore of 74. *Revival* sees Selena sprouting into maturity, a huge change from its predecessor *Stars Dance*. This was also Selena's first album not to be released under Hollywood Records.

# Demi Lovato - Confident

World famous instigator Demi Lovato released her fifth album *Confident* in 2015. In this album, Demi worked with pop juggernauts such as Max Martin, Steve Mac, and Ryan Tedder to curate a specific edgy, bombastic sound. Demi released three singles from this album: "Cool for the Summer" (#11), "Confident" (#21), and "Stone Cold" (#102). Yes, "Stone Cold" actually performed that poorly (#JusticeforStoneCold). *Confident* was Demi's first album to be released under her and Nick's record label Safehouse Records (a joint label between Hollywood Records and Island Records).
