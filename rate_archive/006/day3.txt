[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQy0Ti4JrA)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This song is absolutely beautiful. I've followed her story with her biological father for a very, very long time, and although it was sad to see it end so soon, Demi perfectly closed that chapter of her life with this heartfelt song. Demi's father Patrick Lovato left Demi's family shortly after her second birthday. He was schizophrenic, abusive, and manipulative. 

Demi had written two (or possibly more) songs about her complicated relationship with her father. In 2011, Demi released "[For the Love of a Daughter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmjkOprdoA8)" on her third album *Unbroken*. She wrote the song with the former lead singer of the band The Academy Is..., William Beckett. It was originally intended for her second album until she realized she did not want her young audience to think about this subject. "For the Love of a Daughter" discussed her father's alcoholism and manipulative tendencies. The sequel to this song was "[Shouldn't Come Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBIkfxhH2TU)" from Demi's 2013 self-titled album. At that point, she wasn't on talking terms with her father. She did not want to be around her father anymore. (Note: she never sang these songs live.)

This segues into this track, "Father". Shortly after the release of *DEMI*, Demi's father died of cancer. In this song, she discusses how even though her father caused so many struggles for her, she wishes for him to rest peacefully. The song is full of resent, confusion, and forgiveness. Demi stated in a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_X3Il6VhT8) that even though her father was cruel, he always wanted the best for her - he just never had the capability to raise a family. In her father's honor, Demi created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program: a program that helps pay treatment expenses for patients in CAST Centers. 

This is the song that made me realize that I am so, so proud of this prospective pop star. She's come so far despite the plethora of obstacles that she had to endure. This is the perfect closer to the album, and I don't think *Confident* would've been anywhere nearly as good without it. This, to me, is the song that solidified Demi's Grammy nomination. I only hope to see this girl continue to write songs as well as she does and work that voice.

Anybody who isn't much of a fan of Demi will likely not be swayed by this song, but anybody who adores Demi will be able to see this as Demi's most passionate song to date. The strings on this song are beautiful, the piano is simple yet effective, and the choir appropriately empowers the forgiving essence of the song. After the second chorus, Demi starts to choke up as the song starts to come to an end. Ending the song and the album with a harrowing wail and a potent, melodic chorus is distracting, but effective in conveying the exactly messy relationship Demi had with her father.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Wailordfan** explains his 11: "So, I started a paragraph on this. The more I listen though, the more I realize it fits well with the album. This is probably the best fitting song on the album. ALSO. DAMN THAT SILENCE INTO FULL ORCHESTRA AND HIGH NOTES. FUCK ME. THIS SONG IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITES FROM THE ALBUM, and one of the only songs that really got me shivery. Holy shit. I’m changed since this. I am legit going back and listening to it again and not going on yet. This is just so pretty. I think this is my favorite on the album for sure. Who would have guessed, but I think this is going to be my 11. I was going to argue that it doesn’t fit well in the album, and I think it should have been at the end, with Confident at the very end right after it. It really tells a story that way, and Father is really the perfect ballad for the occasion. It may be hard to relate to, but the emotion, it has me in my feels right now. I may regret my choice come around time for the reveal, but I will defend it. It isn’t a bop, but damn if this isn’t a damn good ballad."

**superr_rad** also justifies her 11: "this is so personal and real how can it not get at least a 10? i love when demi writes a majority of her songs"

**witchyaf** is hairless: "i've been waiting the whole album for a track to wow me, and we've finally arrived. demi's at her best when she's being theatrical, and this song is theatrical and yet intimate and deeply personal and she did THAT."

**Therokinrolla**: "I hate it when people say something "Hits close to Home" but it did and I almost cried the first time I heard it. It really got to me, man"

**joshually** helps to lighten up the mood a bit: 'The thing about Demi songs is you never know if songs about "Father" will be about the glory and goodness of Jesus god... or a scathing blast of her own patriarch set to music. This song literally leaves me confused, like Poot seeing light for the very first time, poor thing. And that wailing scream at the end... if you were sleeping, well you're in for a rude awakening.'

**JohnnyToby**: "ooh boy she should just do songs like these just with less screaming tbh"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Just like the opener, this closer hits hard and tbh makes me shit myself when the loud, massive final chorus come in."

**Jopalopa**: "I'll be honest, I'm normally not a huge fan of songs about grief. Not because I can't relate - I can - but because it feels weird and kind of wrong for an artist to try and convey their grief to an audience. Now, this is definitely one of the better ones, largely because Demi takes the time to acknowledges her father's faults... but in addition to that weird feeling, that blast of "OH"s near the end kind of ruins the mood."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demi tones down her voice in this song - she sings in a sultry, mesmerizing tone that makes this track very different from the rest of the album. She compares sex to a wildfire: raunchy, hot, and... wild? The line "play me like your first guitar - where every single note's too hard" is amazing. The lyricism and and voluptuous vocals are taken to the next level with "Body Say", but this dreamy production is peculiar (thank you, Stargate).

**joshually** is concerned: "Why does Demi insist on using the most dangerous/unhealthy metaphors to signify love and romance? Heart attack? Fire starter? Skyscraper?? And now there's Wildfire? Don't she know the danger and deadliness of wildfires? Smokey the Bear does not approve."

**havanabrown** is too: "I coulda sworn I heard whistle notes??? That can't be Poot right"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "YAS DEMI GIMMIE ~~LOVE~~ MORE OF THAT WHISTLE when will ur fave?"

**letsallpoo**: "It's so nice when Demi doesn't scream"

**gannade**: "Wtf why does this album’s filler tracks have so many bops"

**SkyBlade79** backs up his 11: "Amazing song. The dreamy instrumental, the vivid imagery, and Demi’s beautiful voice always bring tears to my eyes."

Others were not so sold on this album track.

**TeamAwesome4**: "This is the first song on this album that’s really a full on miss. The tone of the song in no way matches the title of it."

**josh315**: "take some notes from Tinashe, Demetria sis"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *Bangerz* lead single is out! It's hard to tell whether this or "Wrecking Ball" is more iconic, but I guess we now know which of the two is superior. The lyrics are extremely messy, which I don't think anyone expected at the time of the single's release. Still, the song is incredibly catchy, and Mike Will Made-It did a phenomenal job with the production. Miley's name was plastered everywhere in 2013, and this was the song that started it all. We all know about the VMA's performance, so I'll just link it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFLv9Ns1EuQ). Miley did an [acapella version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mjvfnUAfyo) with Jimmy Fallon and The Roots that is definitely one of the best renditions of the song.

**chihuahuazero** reminds us: "We can’t forget how “We Can’t Stop” started an era and gave us the Miley that we hate and murderously loathe. It’s slow yet full of swagger. Bonus for that “La Di Da Di” interpolation."

**Wailordfan**: "Ah yes, where slutty Miley started. Not gonna lie, the music video is one of the most aesthetically pleasing music videos ever. Unfortunately, that’s not what we are rating here. It is a total shame that her way to break the Disney perfect girl shell is through a terribly written stereotypical party song. The only thing I’d note is the fact that it has a super slow tempo for such a promiscuous song. Also, the la-da-dee-da-dee/we like to party is a fun ear worm."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Ah of course, the song that literally shocked everyone with Miley's new image. Controversy aside, I think this is a good song. I can see why this song was offered to Rihanna in the first place. This is something Rihanna would sing, albeit with different lyrics to fit Rihanna's style."

**witchyaf**: "i hated this song when it first came out but the more i listened to it the more i started to really vibe with it, it's a damn good song. also i love the molly/miley line like yas bitch get edgy"

**Therokinrolla**: "Can't you see it's we who own the night?" and "We run things, things don't run we". I can't get over those lyrics. But, unlike other songs on this album, it doesn't sound like an attempt at being "mature", but more like a joke, which I appreciate. Also, this song has Miley fully using her vocals, which are insanely good.

Some found the song to be pretty boring.

**Raykel**: "This is so boring that someone once theorized that it's an anti-party song. I believe it. Still doesn't make it a good song though."

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "For a song about not stopping it's kinda a bore"

**SkyBlade79**: "please stop."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "she can't stop but she should"

**MrSwearword**: "Something’s worse than this but this song fucking blows."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demi's good songwriting and excessive shouting return. Demi thought she would have that major ballad hit with this song until Adele swooped in a few weeks later and released "Hello". The lyrics discuss how even though Demi is still in pain from a broken relationship, she wishes happiness and success upon her ex. "If happy is her, I'm happy for you." In her [2015 Complex interview](http://www.complex.com/music/demi-lovato-interview-2015-cover-story), Demi said “I want the Grammy committee to hear [Stone Cold] so that one day they can see that—I know that I’m capable of getting there.” I guess it all ended up working for her somehow because Demetria Devonne Lovato is now a Grammy™-nominated artist.

**Jopalopa** explains that 11: "Y'know, for as much as I love Demi, I completely understand why she isn't more successful. This song was simply never going to appeal to the average top 40 radio listener - but goddamn, it cuts me deep. I think that's because, while lyrically this is a soft, tender ballad, it doesn't really sound like one. It sounds like it's about a catastrophe, and that really does make it that much more powerful to hear that she's happy in spite of it, especially right at the end. And that emotional power is exactly what makes a great ballad."

**senatorknope**: "I liked this more than the rest of the album. I know Demi loves to blow it out of the water with her impressive range, but I think her voice is the most beautiful when it's a bit more restrained. This song does the big parts without letting them get out of control."

**chihuahuazero**: "Demi’s take on the ballad devastates. Also, that phone line makes me feel guilty about my electronic consumption."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Remember when critics said for *Demi*, they felt that she was clamoring for hits? This is exactly how I feel about this song, it feels kinds of forced but I know that this is also stan-worthy for some."

**havanabrown**: "Didn't know Poot would make me wanna weep..."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "this song is ok but at this point in the album i started to get annoyed with Demi's constant over-singing" (lowkey agree with that)

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "please stop oversinging this live, i’m begging you, you are not Xtina and you never will be"

**41HeldInContempt**: "i heard this song got cut from 25 because it wasn’t interesting enough"

no but for real, i connect to this song on an emotional level(srt8 crushes), sad that people here dont have emotions and voted this masterpiece out

betch u on crack
[/r/popheads/comments/5hsdd2/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_3/db2ofps/]

=====

amumumyspiritanimal: Honestly I highly dislike the lyrics of Starring Role, especially if I try to apply them to myself. I don't know, it feels like Marina is mad about someone because they do not like her back, and she don't care anymore so bye, while Stone Cold is about Demi being sad that the person is happy with someone else, but she's still happy, and tries not to blame the person for the unrequited love.

This line especially disgusts me: "Sometimes I ignore you, so I feel in control" If we take the song as something about unrequited love(I know it's probably not about that), this line is the most douchey line I've ever heard and I listened to a whole Robin Thicke album once.

On the other hand, the main line in Stone Cold, "If happy is her, I'm happy for you" is so amazing and sad and real for me. I had this on-off crush on one of my friends since like 5th grade, which meant a lot to me, and I felt this way 100% when he got a gf. Obv I wanted him to like me, but if you really like someone you let them be happy with their lives.

/rant lol

deleted: Oh, Stone Cold definitely has a more positive message, but I'm not gonna lie - all those unrequited straight boy crushes made me really bitter eventually, so I actually really relate to Starring Role's somewhat bitter side of things. And I know it's a shit thing to do, but I'm definitely guilty of being rude and pushing someone away to try and mask the fact that I love them, just because I know it could never happen anyway.

Overall, I agree Stone Cold has a much more positive outlook, but I personally relate to Starring Role more and I think it's also important to have songs that describe feelings we get that we aren't exactly proud of.

That's not true, people do that a lot because they need walls to keep others out. It's not always a shitty thing to do. I can relate to it on a minor level, but it's not my thing tbh.

Average: 7.143 / Controversy score: 2.053 / [Instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXJ4XG5BWeQ)

Highest scores: (11 x1): BlasiFeelsSwift; (10 x4): letsallpoo, NapsAndNetflix, ExtraEater, DrunkHurricane

Lowest scores: (0 x1): Mudkip1; (2 x1): joshually; (4 x2): superr_rad, SkyBlade79

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSnkWzZ7ZAA)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's a lot of salt regarding the song's single release and boring ass music video, but the song was pretty much destined to flop due to Selena being busy with the Revival Tour. Nonetheless, the song is packed with fun--preachy and at times hackneyed, but fun. Selena wrote this song with frequent collaborators Rock Mafia and Dave Audé after receiving a bunch of [fat-shaming comments](http://www.etonline.com/news/173674_selena_gomez_talks_being_being_fat_shamed_to_ellen_degeneres/) regarding a photo of her in a bikini while vacationing in Mexico. Despite the lyrics being cheesy, they are true to Selena and her beliefs.

**BlasiFeelsSwift** is a bit upset: "#JUSTICEFORKILLEMWITHKINDNESS, THIS SONG IS AMAZING, A GREAT MESSAGE, A GREAT BEAT, HER VOICE IS FLAWLESS, GREAT CHORUS, I LOVE THAT BREATHY THING SHE DOES IN THE CHORUS, WHY WASN’T THIS HIGHER!!!! WHY WASN’T IT GIVEN A GOOD MUSIC VIDEO INSTEAD OF THIS??????"

**Jopalopa**: "Now this is how to do a cheesy song right. There's nothing really spectacular about it, but the song sticks to one metaphor throughout, the message is strong, and that whistle is really catchy."

**MrSwearword**: 'This might be her Walgreens version of “Born This Way” so I’ll be nice about the score.'

**cloudbustingmp3** draws the same parallel: "cute but definitely not single material. a little preachy, but i love born this way so it's not a huge deal to me"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Probably the single effect but this song bops"

@**letsallpoo**: "don't @ me"

**superr_rad**: "Ok but like look at how many people were kind to Trump and LOOK WHERE WE ARE NOW SMH HORRIBLE ADVICE - also i have no idea why this was released as a single it's one of the more boring songs on the album to me"

**bluehxrizon**: "enough whistling in pop songs tbh"

**41HeldInContempt**: "she’s using her voice for something that fucking matters!!!"

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTKI9OUGVGU)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last non-single of *Bangerz* is out! However, this definitely should've been a single. The dubstep beat *bangz* and the piano really makes the song sound **THAT** more theatrical. French Montana only adds to the fun. The text language is a bit odd but not unexpected from Miley. 

**Reifiui**: "IM S H O O K THIS FUCKING BANGS"

**SkyBlade79**: "This is, in my opinion, how the whole album should’ve been. It’s really a great track with such unique elements. The buildup to this amazing dubsteppy drop is great, and if you don’t like this song, well, I’ve got two letters for you."

**chihuahuazero**: "This is the best dubsteppy, swingy, text-speaky pop song. No, my score isn’t ironic. “FU” is a delight."

**Raykel**: The lyrics sound like she was making them up on the spot, it's terrible. But the production and her vocals make this a certified bop. This is one of the few times where having a rap (barely) feature actually enhances the quality of the song.

**joshually**: "This is the snapchat equivalent of pop songs. The worst part is it's actually a pretty clever and fun pop song? Or am I just that immature? Yes."

**letsallpoo**: "This is the kind of song that an album called Bangerz should be filled with"

**Wailordfan**: "GODDAMN. YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. I LOVE THAT I HAVEN’T HEARD ANYTHING FROM THIS ALBUM BEFORE. CAUSE THIS IS LIT AF. MMMMMFFF THAT BUILDUP."

**TeamAwesome4**: 'This song is pretty dope, but “SMH” and “pressing send on you” is kinda annoying'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The song discusses a struggling relationship in which Selena's significant other only expresses love when alcohol is involved. A simple, pulsating cadence accompanies Selena's pleas. Also worth noting is that this is the least controversial song of the entire rate.

*“Sober” is one of my favorite songs, but it’s not even about one specific person. “Sober” came from me and Chloe [Angelides], one of the writers, when we were sitting in a hall and talking about social awkwardness. I would hang out with people and they would drink and they’re so fun, then the next day it would be weird. I actually left that night and Chloe ended up writing “Sober.” There were moments like that, little gems. It wasn’t too difficult, it was just, “How am I going to say it elegantly and in a way that’s right for me?”* - Selena Gomez for TIME, 2015 [[source](http://time.com/4053719/selena-gomez-revival-interview/)]

**PM_ME_HOT_FOREARMS**: "Shame she didn't release this. I only participated in this rate just so I can give my 11 to Sober."

**bluehxrizon**: "WHY WASNT THIS A SINGLE #justiceforsober"

**witchyaf**: "the chorus smacks u in the face, and the energy is there. the bridge is fuckin cool. it's a bop."

**timothy444**: "Oh god, the vocal cuts in the introduction are pure heaven! Orgasm for my ears!"

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "For once she doesn't completely phone it in"

This song is #relatable too.

**calltehshots**: "I hate this song bc it’s too real but I also love this song bc it’s too real"

**sjoors**: "w o w this is me"

**JohnnyToby** goes against the grain: "Tbh I don’t understand the hype behind the song. It’s ok at best like her scream near the end should’ve just been cut."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I mean, it’s filler, but it’s good filler"

**Therokinrolla**: "Does every goddamn song have to have the squealy child's voice in the beginning? Otherwise, an almost excellent track."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This song is just beautiful. Arguably, it does not belong anywhere on *Bangerz*, but opening the album with this song gives the album the best impression possible. The piano is intriguing, and the violins in the song just help this sugary song feel more sweet. There are few pleasantly mature songs on the album that parallel the many trashy, fun songs. This is one of them.

After seeing Cedric Gervais get nominated for a Grammy for his "Summertime Sadness" remix, Miley's team contacted him to [turn this song into a banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MQ2nVohQ8U). Unfortunately, the song never followed the success of the previous two singles, only peaking at #21 on the Billboard Hot 100.

**mirandacrocsgrove** thinks this is "lead single worthy, tbqh. This song makes me feel things and makes me with this song performed better commercially."

**gannade**: "I ADORE THIS SONG"

**MrSwearword**: "She gets credit for not sounding like a twerk obsessed poser here. The video knocks it down to hell, though."

**unreliablecynic** is horny: "At the time I didn't really get the music video for this song, now I get it, would absolutely masturbate to this song" 

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I need to take a shower just from listening to this I feel filthy"

**letsallpoo**: "I feel like I'm standing with an army / Of men armed with weapons" Miley sis

Some spoke of its status as the album opener:

**JohnnyToby**: "Lyrics are a mess but still really sweet sounding. Great opener."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is such an interesting song to use as an opener to an album that basically sounds the opposite of this."

**TeamAwesome4**: 'This is not the kind of opening you expect from an album called “Bangerz”, but that is not a bad thing.'

**awhile2**: "hey you know whats not a great idea? Starting off an album with its most boring song"

It was featured in PayPal's [SuperBowl commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dF9t_xQGks), the [trailer for *Central Intelligence*](https://youtu.be/MxEw3elSJ8M?t=47s), the [trailer for *Bad Moms*](https://youtu.be/IHBLbGvwO6I?t=1m15s), and the whole [international trailer for *Spider-Man: Homecoming*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41dUp3kK-0w) (paging /u/ DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy), but it still couldn't reach the top 20... still, this is a confidence anthem (and a trailer anthem). Max Martin used the formula of loud verses and an anticlimactic chorus that worked so well for him in Ariana Grande's "[Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1g8G_njx8)" and not as well for him in Tori Kelly's "[Nobody Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPX3qz1ve7M)". I think that despite the song's relative commercial failure, this song will live on in commercials for years to come.  

**Jopalopa** shows support: "The song that made me a Demi stan. I mean, she'd made great songs before, but she was still Demi Lovato, semi-successful Disney starlet, so they had to be flukes, right? Nope. This is the rare song that balances being incredibly catchy and incredibly sexy simultaneously. It's really fun to sing along to, yes, but it's got an intriguing darkness to it, the sort of darkness you have no choice but to step into yourself - if only to see where the hell she's taking this next."

**superr_rad** is "wishing Chance featured on this Confident tbh"

**calltehshots**: "yes ended insecurity"

**Therokinrolla**: "Hell YES! Its loud and kinda obnoxious and that's okay because it's me!"

**havanabrown**: "I need a squad to strut down the pavement to this song. It's very empowering"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "there's nothing wrong with being confident but there's a lot wrong with this song"

**TeamAwesome4** disagrees and defends that 11: "Let me tell you what’s wrong with being confident. Absolutely nothing."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "- I literally didn’t like Demi at all, then this song hit the radio. I figured I would give her a chance, and listen to her album. I fell in love. She can bully me and call me fat, idgaf her music fucking slays and this song made me realize that."

**SkyBlade79** is torn: "The trumpets are really nice, the confidence is amazing, but it’s so cliche"

**joshually**: 'Comes off as a desperate wannabe Xtina in Back to Basics, but merely falls into "basic".'

We've all gotten tired of steel drums at this point in 2016, but this song is different; it ties together many different sounds: a hasty 80's synthpop-inspired beat that is accompanied by steel drums and a punchy percussion. She struggles to sing this song live because of how much higher than usual her voice goes in the chorus. This definitely should've been a single: it's catchy, entrancing, and empowering. 

**JohnnyToby**: "#whywasntthisasingleparty"

**Doc** defends his 11: "I am not sure how this song would be ranked and I hope I am not the only one who gave this song an 11. The production of this song is god-tier. The dance and synthpop elements of the song complement each other perfectly"

**cloudbustingmp3** comes into defense too: "things she did: THAT! literally everything about this song is so perfect and i'm still sad kill em with blandness was a single over this"

**ExtraEater**: "steel drums best instrument"

**Therokinrolla**: "FUCKING MOAN OH GOD. SO funky, so hot, dear God"

**havanabrown**: "The bridge is really boring she's just talking pretty much it kinda lets the rest of the song down. Those percussion things are cool idk what they're called tho they're like TING TING TING"

**senatorknope** isn't much of a fan of this: "I'm sure others will disagree, but I think M&TR is an especially weak point on Revival. I find it dated and somewhat irritating."

**superr_rad**: "This just doesn't sound like a song that suits her tbh"

**joshually**: "This is basically a lowkey hold it against me. I wonder who would win in a top 2 finale of The Voice season 23 between Selena and Britney."

One of Selena's biggest hits takes its exit now! "Same Old Love" is a torch song written by Charli XCX and Stargate. It is speculated to be [offered to Rihanna](https://twitter.com/rihanna/status/482231945204465665) before she started working on *ANTI*. The song discusses the desire to cut off ties in a toxic relationship. 

*For her new single “Same Old Love,” Selena cited her relationship with the first guy she ever loved: her dad. She believes her relationship with her father, who had her at 16, reflects how her relationship with guys have been. “I think that’s where it started, and all the actions that happened are almost similar to what I was going through,” she says. “I think that’s why I super excited to be part of it. Plus I’m such a huge fan of Charli XCX. She’s so talented and incredible, and cool, and so I was stoked. This kind of came together really well.”* [[source](http://www.at40.com/news-article/selena-gomez-teases-secret-revival-event-talks-album-artwork-and-same-old-love/37967)]

Selena mimics Charli's quirky vocal style throughout the song; Charli's background vocals can be heard quite clearly in the chorus. The piano, snapping, and synths all come together to make an enjoyable break-up song.

**witchyaf** defends his 11: "listen, i fucking love charli xcx, and this song is 100% her feat. selena gomez. it GOES OFF THO. this song was written with a loop pedal and a dream and it fuckin works it out. sickening, snatched, B O P, when will your fave, etc."

**Jopalopa**: "A perfectly competent pop song, but it bugs me that I can't really think of anything more to say about it. Then again, isn't that her entire persona? Selena Gomez: the pop star who's perfectly competent, or at least her hit singles are."

**chihuahuazero**: "I’ll forgive this track for making me think that Charli XCX sang the whole chorus and driving me to announce this on the behalf of Pop Genius."

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "Pretty nice, but she still seems bored (Like 90% of her other singles)"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song is a bop but Charli XCX's background vocals on the chorus is the best part of the song imo."

**awhile2**: "Charli XCX should just write every pop song from now on tbh"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "charli should've kept this to have another hit of her own but i'm not mad SelGo ended up with it"

**Therokinrolla**: "Selena Quiet-Mouth decided to actually use her vocal chords in this track and, while sounding a little squeal-y, actually ends up slaying my fuckin ass off"

**calltehshots**: "It’s cute but also extremely grating and annoying"

**JohnnyToby** delivers the shade saying that this is "Charli’s best song."

lmao /u/joshually you're savage when it comes to these rates! What's your take on Same Old Love?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The whisper queen loses another hit! "You're metaphorical gin-and-juice" is probably the most polarizing and enigmatic line of the entire rate. Fun fact: Co-writer Justin Tranter tried to incorporate this line into many songs before this. The song was inspired by Prince. Gomez first worked on the song with the iconic songwriting duo Justin Tranter & Julia Michaels and the iconic production duo Mattman & Robin (aka the co-creators of our [anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeccAtqd5K8)); then she sent the song to Max Martin. Max Martin worked on the vocal production and has stated that the song was one of his favorites of the year [[source](http://time.com/4053719/selena-gomez-revival-interview/)]. The whispering works well for Selena, and the music video (directed by Madonna collaborator Alek Keshishian) is upon her best. Also, this song got two pages of comments - a good deal of them being "I mean I could, but why would I want to?"

As wise YouTube commenter once said, “Hands To Myself sounds like she started trying to make an ASMR video and then just added an instrumental to it.﻿” [[source in the comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFvPw1WXEAw)]

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** supports his 11: 'just absolute pop perfection. she sounds amazing, she looks amazing in the video, the "i mean i could but why would i want to" line is just perfect'

**41HeldInContempt**: "what a fucking banger. by far the best song on the rate. miley and whatsherface could never."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "A SONG! didn't like it the first time i heard it back when the album came out, but i'm also 97% sure i was drunk"

**senatorknope**: "The more I hear this song, the more I like it. It's 3 songs in one and it works. Also, I love the way she says “you’re metaphorical gin and juice,” even though that's a bizarre thing to say and she didn't necessarily need to identify it as metaphorical, but anyway--top quality enunciation, Selena"

**Wailordfan**: "Queen of sexy right here. She at least knows she can’t sing so she just whispers a melody, and honestly, it slays harder than any CRJ, Gaga, or Britney/s. For real though, this song really dug Selena into the realm of pop star. Goddamn is this song genius. The beat is sick, and her voice actually works super well with the song. It’s just sooooo damn good. Another 11 contender."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "i love the mature subject throughout the song and the classy way it’s presented (looking at you Miss Steinfeld with your in-your-face ode to masturbation). Great music video with a surprising twist, oh god that breathy thing she does makes me weak in the knees. And don’t get me started on the way she sings that “ooh” at the beginning of the pre-chorus, would have given it a higher rating but that “you’re metaphorical gin and juice” is too cringy. But that wig has me S H O O K"

**witchyaf** contemplates where it is appropriate to bop to this song:  “can't-keep-my-hands-to-my-self. this one is also a nice bop-lite, but it's not really big or loud enough for a club, and it's lyrically not really a song to sit with alone, so it's kind of a hard sell, like where do u listen to it??? i like it tho”

**calltehshots**: "A bop that should’ve been a number 1 smash for 10 weeks"

**MrSwearword** is disgusted: "You jerked off Bieber at several points in your life. Keep those fucking hands away from humanity." 👅

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selena is the first one out! The sultry, futuristic *Revival* lead single made it past the other 3 Selena songs behind it. Originally, Selena did not choose this as the lead single until she decided that it would go against the "summer anthem" cliché. This was a shocking change for Selena, and it was the perfect precursor to *Revival*. Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels' clever songwriting are also witnessed in this song, my favorite line being the opening line: "I'm on my 14 karats...doing it up like Midas". No one knew what 'syncopate' meant, so I guess we all learned something new from this song. Despite not having done rap features before, Selena decided that a rap feature would fit the song well, so she contacted A$AP Rocky. There is also an [alternate solo version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TsVjvEkc4s) that was only used in the music video.

I deeply recommend giving the instrumental a listen. It's beautiful.

**JohnnyToby**: "I just hoe out every time this song plays. Tbh inspired me to become the person I am today. Thanks Selena."

**SpanKKy1**: "Would have been better with a Shawn Mendes feature, but a banger none the less"

**Wailordfan**: 'It is very obviously her “I ain’t no Disney bitch” song. Slightly irrelevant rap feature, and just moody enough to come off as overtly sexual, but without cursing to make sure her original fan base can play it at their school’s class party in 7th grade. Not a bad song though. Sultry enough to have sex to, so all in all, not bad.'

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "It took a while for this to grow on me but this song honestly shocked me. While it's catchy, it definitely has a different sound for me to that I was surprised that this was chosen as a lead single. This is probably one of Selena's most mature songs to date."

**SkyBlade79**: "Okay, the Rocky verse is really good, I like the seductive voice, and it’s just so different compared to most of her stuff."

**chihuahuazero**: "It’s smoldering, restrained, sexy... it’s a pop track that shouldn’t have worked, but does. Even Rocky’s interchangeable verse cannot stop this from being one of Selena’s best."

**havanabrown**: "If I had some sexy lingerie I would strut around in it listening to this"

**joshually** says what we're all thinking: "I want get lip collagen injections, false drag queen eyelashes, a luxurious chocolate brown lacefront weave, smokey eyeshadow, then put on a satiny silk blouse just so I can sexily unbutton it and slip it off my shoulders in front of a floor mirror while this song plays in the background."

**Therokinrolla**: "Worst song on the album. Bland and tasteless. If this song was a pickle it would be a cucumber."

**witchyaf** defends his zero: "holy shit it d r a g s o n f o r e v e r . i was at a drag show once and this song came on and i used the opportunity to step away for a new drink and a bathroom break. no performer could breathe life into this song"

I really like this song. It’s not as good as Ass Back Home, but it’s still pretty good. /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah calls it the “opposite of Ass Back Home, hook sucks, Travie McCoy's verses are ok” /u/whatsapilot drags it saying “ ’Good music can be so hard to find’ well this is a terrible place to start, and so is pretty much any single Adam Levine has been in during the past few years.” “Fuck Travie McCoy. Fuck “Yeah, yeah, that’s right”. Fuck the “Haha” after every one of his awful puns. Fuck his inability to move past a single metaphor, instead making it sound more and more dumb the ‘deeper’ he goes. Fuck his stupid little insincere faux-inspirational spoken-word bridges. Fuck the fact that the US ditched him after 2012 but I distinctly remember having to suffer through his fucking solo career for another 3 years as he pumped out more mediocre shite. Fuck this absolute hack.” - /u/camerinian.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demetria Devonne Lovato is the winner of the *Bangerz* vs. *Revival* vs. *Confident* rate! This flamboyant summer anthem didn't make the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 (Thanks, Justin Bieber), but at least Demi has a #1 hit here on popheads! Everything about this song is perfect: the radical electric guitar riffs, the suggestive but not remorseful lyricism, the adlibs, the synths, and the switching between smooth, sultry vocals and loud, exhilarating vocals. The song also has a wet and steamy music video to accompany it. Demi worked with Max Martin and his crew to craft an earworm, and it's a no-brainer that this is one of Demi's best songs if not her best.

**letsallpoo** one-ups me with his well-written explanation on why this song deserves to win the rate: '2015 will be remembered as the year Disney Radio finally put a song about lesbian experimentation on rotation. Think “I Kissed a Girl” but with twice the bombast and none of the heteronormativity; Lovato has a craving for the cherry, and as the song oscillates between coquettish rasps and barbaric yawps, a tinkling piano and a searing-hot electric guitar (which share the same riff), not one moment sounds the least bit sorry for wanting a bite. “Cool for the Summer” is bursting with moments of greatness–the pre-chorus that leaps from kissing to dying, a Snoop Dogg reference, a nonsensical f-bomb, how she sings “body type” like she’s drawing curves with her voice–but most importantly, it’s a hell of a lot of fun. Music, even the pop variety, has a tendency to get deathly serious and depressing at times. But for an intense three minutes, Lovato takes us down into her paradise, and it’s one like no other.'

**Jopalopa**: "A lot has been made of how similar this sounds to Jessie J's "Domino", and that's a fair point. In my opinion, the key difference between Demi and Jessie is that Jessie doesn't really emote. Demi, on the other hand, shows an amazing amount of passion, and suggests that whatever bi-curious fling she's singing about, it's important and epic and melodramatic and something worth being remembered forever in a pop song. And who knows? Maybe it really is."

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "Almost lost points for a tryhard 'summer song' title, but at least the actual song is good enough to support it (looking at you Maroon 5)"

**calltehshots**: "The minute I hear the piano I’m instantly shook. anyone who gave this below a 9 is deaf"

**Raykel**: "I give it my 11 to pay homage to its peak on the Billboard Hot 100. But seriously that guitar mesh slays me to death, but gives me enough life to revive."

**witchyaf**: "i love this song even though it's such, like, gay-baiting garbage. the synths in the verses are just so luxe. fun fact: the chorus is a cappella and was recorded by injecting demi with adrenaline and recording her vocalizations."

**sjoors**: "The gays have gaybait nick jonas, is this like lesbianbait?" Well, she learned from the best.

**cloudbustingmp3**: "a BOP! Demigod delivered a new bisexual anthem #pokerfaceisoverparty"

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "best song on this album by a long shot"

**havanabrown**: "THIS SONG MAKES ME A LESBIAN AND IM A BOY"

The Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit "Wrecking Ball" is also Miley's highest entry in this rate! This gigantic, meme-laden ballad is beautiful, potent, and impossible to get out of your brain once it's in there. The song was originally written for Beyoncé, which is a blessing on Miley's behalf. The keyboard, electric guitar, and violins created a pop ballad quintessential to 2013. In this song, Miley compares a broken relationship to a wrecking ball. "Wrecking Ball" was pretty much inevitable in 2013, and it solidified Miley's status as a major pop star.

**unreliablecynic**, our valued Smiler, says: "Fuck I forgot how killer this song is. Queen of vocals. Queen of emotion. Queen of pop"

**joshually**: "A truly beautiful song. No flaws."

**ExtraEater**: "There really isn't anything wrong with this song, and I have to give my 11 to something, even if it's to a song from the album I have the lowest average on."

**chihuahuazero**: "More people would appreciate this song if they weren’t so prudish about the music video. It’s a solid pop ballad that will sound fresh years from now."

**superr_rad**: "This is such a good damn song! The video seriously overshadowed the amazingness of it."

**SkyBlade79**: "Video aside, this song is a masterpiece. The lyrics are beautiful, the production is great, and Miley’s emotion in this song is great. Best song off of Bangerz."

**senatorknope**: "I almost gave this an 8 without re-listening, because this shit was inescapable and kind of became a joke. But it's actually so good. The beat works and the emotion comes through in every word."

**Wailordfan**: "Yup. It is the ballad of the century. I C O N I C. Music video that will be parodied for years to come. And it deserves all of those. This song is a fucking masterpiece. All of the live performances were good, and her voice is the perfect fit for this song.

I'd give Wrecking Ball a slight edge because it's more iconic, but I'm more likely to listen to Cool for the Summer at any given time - that chorus just EXPLODES and it's one of those rare, satisfying moments when Demi's oversinging completely works. Between the Grammy nomination and this #1 on an /r/popheads rate (because they're totally on the same level of prestige), everything's coming up Demi!

amumumyspiritanimal: It does, because other rates are constantly compared, and for example, our beloved dragger gave The Fame Monster a rather high score.

Nerdy_boy_chris: When were y'all saying that when that happened before? Y'all gave the country songs bad scores just for being country and y'all comments were the same way. But because it's not a genre y'all care about, it didn't matter. And also, if it was a problem, do y'all think his scores would have even been counted?

OberionSynth: I rated most of the country songs low because I personally didn't like them, not because they were country. I listen to a lot of country music, actually. I'm assuming most people did the same, but I can only speak for myself.

amumumyspiritanimal: disliking something does not equals giving out shit scores just because you can, and because you want drama. i dont think anyone should be disqualified, but trying to go for the drama factor is a tad bit pathetic. also, rate threads should be for objective rating, and not for just dragging anyone who is not your favorite musician. even though i liked katy the most, i still gave bad romance a 10 because i enjoyed that song, but it cant be possible that you wont enjoy 12 out of 12 heavily liked songs...

=====

ThereIsNoSantaClaus: > i dont think anyone should be disqualified

I agree nobody should be disqualified, but if someone gives, i don't know, 16 out of 19 songs on an album a 1 or 0 its clearly showing that they didn't have any intention of rating fairly and the scores shouldn't count

amumumyspiritanimal: true, thats what happened during the TFM vs. TD vs. A+C rate, so I think that should be applied on the upcoming rates. If I'd do a rate thread, I'd definitely do that.

Mudkip1: *ding ding ding*

basically my exact thoughts. it's not fair to everyone else who sat through and rated all three albums fairly (even though you preferred some over others) to have a select few people give 1's to each song they weren't a fan of.

i disliked Revival but i still managed to give it a 6.7 average and no songs below a 4 (aside from my 0)

[/r/popheads/comments/5hsdd2/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_3/db2t41j/]

=====

amumumyspiritanimal: Neither. I love some songs from all of them(Daddy Lessons, All Night, Perfect Floplusion, Diamond Heart, Slumber Party, Needed Me, Kiss It Better, etc.), but I'm not a huge fan of either. If I had to choose, I'd choose Lemonade.
[/r/popheads/comments/5hsdd2/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_3/db2t7ej/]

=====

deleted: Yeah, that's pretty much my opinion as well tbh. I mean, I like all of the artists, but I stan for Brit and Gaga much harder than the others.

However, Anti and Lemonade are factually better albums overall. Glory is kinda messy and while I like Joanne, it's not Gaga's best and people will probably massacre it lol.

But they still have some good songs like you said (Man on the Moon, John Wayne also for two). Lemonade probably is the strongest album overall tho, I agree. So wow, we're actually on the same side for once <3.
