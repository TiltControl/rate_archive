amumumyspiritanimal: Dressin Up going out before #20, and TOTGA getting slain before #10 count as a massacre imo. Also, she had almost as a low score on the overall album as Tay-tay right after the #TaylorExposedParty.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: The only tracks from Revival I would be okay being revealed today are the bonus tracks (except Me and My Girls).

Most of them were not good tbh. The standard edition of Revival tho. IT'S GOAT.

[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00p0o/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: On a very unrelated note, DID YOU GUYS SEE THE SPIDER-MAN HOMECOMING TRALIER???????? I WAS SHOOK OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!

In case you didn't see it, here's the links. ([Trailer shown on Kimmel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrzXIaTt99U)) / ([International trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rQ1aodFVvY))
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db008q7/]

=====

Look_A_Fangirl: Honestly, look amazing. And that boat scene. Also the abs. Also editors, we need more Zendaya. 
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db009yb/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: That boat scene high-key gives me life. Such a great homage to the train scene in Spider-Man 2.
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00isu/]

=====

unreliablecynic: I loved it, but what the hell is with the lack of Zendaya, and why did she look homeless as hell
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00a1e/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I think they didn't show a lot of Zendaya to avoid any early speculations of Zendaya being Mary Jane Watson since it's a huge rumor.

With that being said, Zendaya is a bigger star than anyone in the young cast involved. They could have given her more scenes in the trailer?
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00gzw/]

=====

unreliablecynic: I thought it was confirmed that she's MJ
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00mje/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Nope, it was never confirmed. It was never denied either.

It's all up to debate right now.
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00ovj/]

=====

deleted: Looking homeless = looking like a real high school student

I liked that. Peter probably overlooks her for most of the movie and she probably doesn't become his love interest till the second movie

amumumyspiritanimal: It's so amazing Marvel really upped their game(even if it's possible). This Spiderman>Toby Maguire one>>>>>>the non-existent Andrew Garfield one

P.S.: JUST REALIZED ITS CONFIDENT RATE THREAD, ITS NOT COMPLETELY UNRELATED OMG THE COINCIDENCES
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00ky8/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Oh yeah, I am already calling Tom Holland's Spider-Man as my favorite live-action Spidey ever. Andrew Garfield was amazing but Sony fucked up the previous reboot franchise so badly. I am glad Marvel is involved in the creative process now. 
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00rnv/]

amumumyspiritanimal: also tom holland is fiiine in the Kimmel show trailer(especially when he takes his costume off)
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db00wmm/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I will admit Tom Holland is pretty attractive but Chris Pratt has stolen my heart more than the men on the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db0133x/]

=====

amumumyspiritanimal: Honestly every Marvel hunk looks stunning(e.g. Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Jeremy Renner, Chris Evans, Ryan Reynolds, Chris Evans), just like every Marvel gurl(ScarJo made me straight for a second in WS). I need an unattractive superhero i can relate to asap.
[/r/popheads/comments/5hgb0o/rate_results_bangerz_vs_revival_vs_confident_day_1/db01c5j/]

=====

BearlyEvenAPun: Probably the first rate where I had no idea what I'd give my 11 to right off the bat since I had only heard their singles before. All three of them had great songs and not so great songs on their album so I have no real horse in this race. Still hoping for some good drama today though.

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdtNR0Gu_FI)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is Ludacris how bad this song is. Miley's vocal stems do not blend with the instrumental very well. Luda actually serves a quite fun albeit short verse, but the song stands out as being the most unexceptional of the entire rate. Miley made a good choice relegating this as a bonus track. It's no surprise that this is the first song of the rate to be eliminated.

**joshually** admits a dirty secret: "This song was unnecessary, but I do have a weird guilty pleasure crush on LUDAAAAA." When I was 13, I too had my first love. 

**JohnnyToby** was "mad she ended [Bangerz] like this tbh". 

**NapsAndNetflix** throws some slight shade: "I feel like this song grows on you the more you listen to it. But, that would involve listening to it again…" 

**Jopalopa** makes a perfectly valid claim against this kind of generic party music: "This is pure noise. I'm sorry, but I can't enjoy this kind of party music at all because there's nothing to distinguish it from... itself? This is exactly the sort of thing Lorde rails against, and she's not exactly wrong for it."

Average: 4.976 / Controversy score: 2.158 / [Instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW1s0_3CMbw)

Highest scores: (9.2 x1): senatorknope; (9 x2): Therokinrolla, LewHen; (8 x3): awhile2, calltehshots, superr_rad

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJBHdKBOdcw)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The way Miley's vocals start off the song is actually pretty sweet. Not to mention that Future's part(s?) actually mesh well with the song. In fact, the song as a whole is saccharine. A huge fault of this album is the wacky Mike Will production detracting from the tone of the lyrics. This song is a huge case of that scenario. The Ben E. King sample does not belong anywhere on this song either. 

**senatorknope** describes the duet well: "A lot of collaboration tracks slap on a second artist, but the overlapping vocals work well throughout." Future being in the song is fairly divisive--with some loving it and others not wanting it at all. 

Most notably, **41HeldInContempt** says: "boring, also future sounds like he’s crying." 

**MrSwearword** makes an interesting comparison: "the theoretical trap version of Tammy Wynette’s “Stand by Your Man” gets credit for trying to be fusion. Make no mistake, this sucks too." 

**Joebiekong** comes through with the shade: "I didn't barf while listening to this..."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This collaboration had so much potential that was completely wasted. Britney deserves better, but she also brings a lot of fun to this song. This was the most controversial song of the rate.

Some thought of the song as a guilty pleasure.  **calltehshots** serves the tea: "fun messy trash featuring britney spears it’s my weakness." 

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** agrees: "Basically, any song from this album (irregardless if it's good or not) that makes my butt twerk is an automatic 10. And Britney's verse adds a nice touch to this hot flaming garbage bop." 

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** also speaks truth: "this song is trash but it's also really good"

On the flip side, most people thought of it as utter trash. garbage. rubbish. dookie. **havanabrown** sighs, "What a piece of shite Britney why" 

**superr_rad** displays the kind of ambivalence we all had at some point listening to the album: "This is just not a good song at all. It's messy, not catchy, and Britney doesn't even sound like Britney. If this is the album title song, I'm extremely worried about the rest of this album." 

**joshually** sympathizes: "Britney's the poor hapless babysitter forcibly dragged along this wild ride with this irresponsible child. All poor Britney wanted was to save some money for a couple of vacuum repair classes at the local community college." 

**mirandacrocsgrove** supposes a "Kei$ha or something" moment: "This song is so forgettable I wouldn’t be surprised if Britney says she forgot about collaborating with Miley for this song. #mikewillmadeit"

**SkyBlade79**: “inb4 everyone gives it a 4 to be funny” 

**ExtraEater**: “during the rate can you keep a count of the amount of people who gave this a 4 thnx”  …number of 4's: 9

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BI_anbu4pw)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was actually the lowest ranking song for quite some time. Some of the lyrics are pretty stupid for a song that is actually trying to be somewhat sophisticated. Miley making a danceable country song is still interesting, but hopefully it isn't an indicator of what her music would sound like if she decided to go country. Fun fact: alt-J samples the "I'm a female rebel" line in their song ["Hunger of the Pine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCCXq9QB-dQ). 

**Raykel** and **BearlyEvenAPun** both said "Hoedown Throwdown did it better." 

**joshually** is astonished by Miley's mathematical skills: "Professor Cyrus, PhD, in advanced theoretical mathematics, presents to you the quandary of the century bamboozling even the most intellectual think tanks. What exactly is 4x4??! Where's Einstein when you need him??" Miley, pls help me with differential equations thanks. 

**MrSwearword** makes a bold (and scary) accusation: "Todd in the Shadows was right; she ended up creating Florida Georgia Line." 

**chihuahuazero** reminds us to #SaveNelly: "I’ll give this another half a point for making Nelly a little more relevant in 2013." 

**Wailordfan** brings about some positivity and a hint of controversy: "This is a total bop if the chorus wasn’t so repetitive. Taylor does it better. The synths are really cool though and the accordion is just weird enough to make it sound cool. Also, I really like Nelly’s addition to the song. I don’t think a country based song is going to necessarily fit in the album, but it is a fun song." 

**senatorknope** gets oddly specific: “Driving so fast I could piss on myself” is intense imagery. Also, I’ve been transported to a hoedown that a Flamenco guitarist and a Klezmer band also showed up to. Is this song about a Jeep?

**timothy444** does not like 4x4: "4x4 may equal 16 but 0x0 equals my rating for this travesty."

**Therokinrolla** gives **NapsAndNetflix** a shout-out: “Why is one of my favorite songs on this album country-influenced? Has Miley fucked up pop that much? NapsAndNetflix would be proud.” However, Naps disagrees: “I had this higher but wow is this long”

A good bunch of comments discussed how boring this song sounds. The song is still kinda cute but definitely middling.

**witchyaf** is quite pleased: "this song is actually so pretty and honest, and it's an interesting take on a relationship caught in suspension, which is always a subject ripe for songwriting." 

**awhile2** defends this sweet ballad: "this is better than like every song on the actual album, why is this a deluxe track?" 

**SkyBlade79** calls this “bad California style music”. 

**joshually** compares this to "Carly Simon with a sinus infection" while senatorknope compares it to Fleetwood Mac, rather a Glee cover of them.

**MrSwearword** comes through with a contrarian take: "So Miley can say she’s getting her man a beer but Meghan can’t say they both got a 9 to 5…fuck this desperate trash."

This elimination actually upsets me. It's a bop - it deserves to at least be 10 spots higher! When I listen to this I feel like I am at a Halloween party, drunk and scared... surrounded by apparitions... shaking my ass during an exorcism teas. Also, Sean's verse is hands down the best rap feature of this entire rate. Mike-Will's production is 🔥 on this song too.

❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉 ❤️💸🎉

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** says: "GOD this song is fucking lit, MONEY AIN'T NOTHING BUT MONEY, WHEN YOU GET TO THE MONEY, IT AIN'T NOTHING BUT MONEY." AGREED. 

**TeamAwesome4** was not expecting this: "Well, this one surprised me a bit. Miley goes full on rap here, and it’s adequate. Big Sean isn’t my favorite, but the verse is pretty decent." 

**BlasiFeelsSwift** ponders: "is no an emotion because I feel it" Meghan Trainor once proved that No is indeed an emotion. 

**superr_rad** finds it odd that "the switch of the songs' subject matter through the album. This one kinda has both the party/fun elements and the heartbreak/sadness elements. Like Miley's life I guess?" 

**joshually** drags Miley's rich ass: "A cautionary tale about living a life of gratuitous excess. Why is it only the richest people can say "money ain't nothing"? Must be nice."

Miley finally gets a break! The first Revival song to exit is the very tropical "Survivors". The song's lyrics discusses the embrace of "surviving" relationship obstacles, comparing a relationship to some kind of *Lost* scenario. This is the one song on the album that I always skip. The lyrics are terribly cheesy, and at this point in 2016 I'm certain /r/ popheads is tired of tropical house.

**NapsAndNetflix** just calls this "mall music". 

**3rdattemptusername** wonders: "lmao, if she’s a survivor, why she sound so dead inside with this?" Isn't that how she sounds on half of this album? ^/s 

**qetaz** is a bit irritated: "It sounds like filler. For some reason I also find it quite annoying- maybe because it’s so repetitive?" 

**Jopalopa** describes the circumstances fairly well: "So, this is an attempt to mix Selena's cooing style with a Caribbean rhythm, and... while the two might work independently, they really don't sound good together. The incredibly generic lyrics don't help, either." 

**MrSwearword** actually enjoys this one: "Now THIS is actually interesting. The beat makes me think that with a better artist this could’ve been a Top 15 hit. At least Gomez has a career as a demo singer to plan for."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** was “loving the club friendly nature of this song.”

Ah, yes - the song in which Selena tries to sing. The lyrics are actually pretty sweet. I can see myself staring outside from the passenger's seat of a car on a cold, rainy day drinking a cup of scalding jasmine tea while listening to this. She sounds like she's struggling to sing the first half of the chorus, but her voice actually sounds soothing on the latter half - especially when she sings "it's about half past 10:00, and I have to catch my ride."

**PM_ME_HOT_FOREARMS** is impressed: "This is actually a great ballad. Sad and sweet at the same time." 

**senatorknope** is feeling things: "On first listen I totally passed this one off with a really low score because the piano and vocals feel so distant from one another, but when I revisited I was suddenly on the floor crying." 

**sjoors** says "girl don't take away your production." 

**calltehshots** is not impressed at all: "So boring how dare she release something this sappy and lame" 

**TeamAwesome4** responds with an image: "[She poured her heart into writing this.](https://i.imgur.com/zl5RoXc.jpg)" 

**josh315** is scarred by this song: "I already hated this song but it came up on shuffle once when I was on a bus and I tried to skip it but turned the volume up really loud by accident and everyone could hear I was listening to this monstrosity." 

**41HeldInContempt** redirects the shade: "cute but that’s about it, a little bland. at least she doesn’t scream like that irrelevant disney pseudo-star… what’s her name? dani?" 

**MrSwearword** notes down the peaceful instrumental: 'Bum lower registers against a lovely piano accompaniment. If I can love “Feel So Close” for flat vocals against a great EDM beat, I’ll be nice to this one too.'

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This song is the best kind of trashy. It sounds like it could be one of those trashy yet catchy Meghan Trainor songs. Some of these lyrics are hilarious, most notably "It's bananas like a fucking 'rangatang bitch."  will.i.am produced this track, which isn't surprising once you hear the song. 

**SkyBlade79** loves a particular line: "This is like Can’t Stop but so much better. This is the type of song that you just want to sing along to. BANG BANG, IMMA SHOOT EM DOWN BABY"

**calltehshots** is shook: "an uppercase BOP my ass is quaking"

**havanabrown** gets sleazy: "The beat so phat gonna make me cum"

**awhile2** disses will.i.am: "this beat drop is dumb and not in the good way"

**Doc** slaps an automatic 10: ‘Another song that made me twerk hard, so automatic 10. The "DAMN BITCH. YOU THINK I AM STRANGE BITCH?" lyric is almost an 11/10. Like it's such a garbage lyric but in a good way lol.’

A few people mention the "thang" - 

**joshually**: 'Has anyone figured out what exactly the "thang" Miley wanted to do was? Also, anyone else catch the sly "Freek'n You" interpolation?'

**Therokinrolla**: "If this is her thang then it fuckin' sucks"

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEm3lY3trRU)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Surprised to see this being Demi's first elimination! Demi does this kind of soft, Jhené Aiko-esque singing on the verses. The mood is somewhat ruined by the shrill chorus. Nevertheless, the instrumental during the chorus conveys the message of the song very well. Also, Sirah makes an appearance on the song that no one asked for. Allegedly, this song is about a [former friend who made fun of her addiction struggles](http://www.sugarscape.com/celebs/news/a1004074/demi-lovato-and-miley-cyrus-bff-cheyne-thomas-feud-on-twitter-stop-trying-to-get-famous-off-me/). (Read it, Demi serves some good juice here.) I would want to fight him too, Demi.

**letsallpoo** asked: "Is this Sabi"... who dat

**joshually** wants bully Demi to stop: 'I thought she'd resolved all her anger management issues in "Old Ways" but it sounds like bully Demi has surfaced once again. Break the cycle, gurl! We sort of believe in you!'

**superr_rad** agrees: "eh im not scared of you demi"

**JohnnyToby** makes an astute observation: "so why does have a video but Me and the Rhythm doesn't?"

**Jopalopa** explains why this song got eliminated: "Well, it's a better tainted-friendship song than "Bad Blood", that's for damn sure. And yeah, this song has a lot of faults of its own - it takes a while to really get going, the boxing metaphors go a bit too far, and Sirah's rap verse isn't very interesting and is kind of pointless. But I can't deny that the chorus is incredibly catchy, and for that I'll forgive a lot."

**JoshuaReddit** just throws some shade: "I didn’t think it was even possible to have an even worse rap feature than what Iggy just did but Sirah (who?) proved me wrong."

This would probably be ten spots higher without Iffy Amelia. This succeeds at being the thottiest song on the rate, it's unfortunate how similar it sounds to "Black Widow". I feel like a hoe until Iggy mentions *Family Matters*, the Bible, and *Blue's Clues* in her verse. Still, the song should've been released as a single because the music video would've been awesome. Dammit, Igloo. 

**BarelyEvenAPun** says what we're thinking: Pretty unremarkable. Iggy Azalea isn't terrible here but I don't think anyone has ever thought 'Oh boy! I'm glad Iggy Azalea is on this song!'

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah** did not like this at all: “Iggy's verse is straight trash and I had to give a song a zero so..” **calltehshots** agrees and gives a throwback: “do you remember when Iggy was gonna get married and Demi was gonna be her bridesmaid? I’m so embarrassed for her. Anyway, a song that’s a 5 is an instant 0 when Iggy comes on”

There were two different comparisons to Katy Perry's "Dark Horse".

**SkyBlade79**: "AT LEAST on par with Dark Horse. In fact, the rap feature is better, and Demi’s voice is just so much more powerful"

**josh315**: "eh, I was over the make a song that sounds like Dark Horse craze when this came out, so I’m even more over it now"

A good deal of the rest of the comments complained about Iggy, with Iggy being like 5 aliases... "Iguana Anthrax" by **MrSwearword**.

Her voice kinda sounds annoying in the chorus? This is coming from me out of all people. I guess there's a good reason why this is a Target bonus track.

**joshually** is a little grossed out: "Like, she's just writhing naked on his bed spritzing his grocery store Drakkar Noir all over her body. That just seems so unsanitary to me. I'm not sure what her endgame is, but god made us all unique and special?"

Miley is excellent at conveying pain in her songs. It's interesting how different the production and the context of the lyrics are. 

This song sums up the sound of *Bangerz* pretty well. **joshually** explains this sentiment well: "I throw a lot of shade about Bangerz but all in all it's a solidly tight album. There's a theme that echoes throughout, a sound that ties it all together, and this song is sort of the embodiment of all of that. On the surface, it's a tune filled with contradictions: A retro/futuristic song, speaking of heartache disguised as a defiant pop jam, with several different musical structures packed into one song, but it works."

**chihuahuazero** explains their 11: “Someone Else” is underrated. It’s a four-minute closer that features Miley in one of her most earnest moments, despite Mike’s insistent producer tag. (By the time he got to The Pinkprint and “Formation”, he learned.) Is it poetic? Not really. But as a musical piece, I’m irrationally entranced with what some of y’all might find a sappy mush. Appreciate the ambition and dance.

**senatorknope**: "There are parts that I love, and it shows off Miley's range, but it's wildly inconsistent. If nothing else I'm absolutely certain that at any given time you could find this song playing at a multilevel club in Eastern Europe."

**41HeldInContempt** comes through with that Demi shade again: "doing your best demi impression on that bridge i see"

**SkyBlade79** enjoyed Mike-Will's production: "I love the EDM elements of this song, and the lyrics are still amazing. Reminds me of something from 2008-2010. The bridge is a complete work of art. Just… SLAYYY"

This song is a bop, even though the lyrics are dumb Radio Disney material and the drums are stolen from Sleigh Bells.

**Wailordfan**: "This is peppy. Wow. Going from Father to this is kinda sad. The intro is kinda thotty."

**PM_ME_HOT_FOREARMS**: "I like this song but its placement as an upbeat song after Father (which is a super sad song) is kinda weird."

**joshually** reminds us of a sad instance: "This is some wack faux-Rihanna messiness right here, like that poor fan who wore the same dress as Ri and got LOLed at in front of everyone on twitter."

**JoshuaReddit** wants this to be over: "Fuck Demi’s producers for blatantly ripping off Sleigh Bells"

**letsallpoo** just asks "What is this bop". **calltehshots** thinks the same: "omg what a fucking bop i’m getting chills"

**Doc** wants to preserve his headphones: "So, this is the song that Sleigh Bells is suing Demi for. Well, I can at least listen to this song without having the fear that my headphones could break. (I like Sleigh Bells but please these headphones I bought are not cheap)"

**JohnnyToby** makes an observation: "she said they can beat the sun but she also says that they are stars…." *jaden smith voice* How can the sun be a star if the universe doesn't exist?

deleted: # 31. Selena Gomez - Rise

Average: 6.165 / Controversy score: 2.119 / [Instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3L3XVOIv2M)

Highest scores: (10 x1): joshually; (9 x2): havanabrown, SpanKKy1

Lowest scores: (0 x1): JunkyGS; (2 x2): MrSwearword, SkyBlade79

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgBXEH8Ispk&feature=youtu.be)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The instrumental intro is awfully long for a song so short. I've noticed Selena mimics Tim James' (from Rock Mafia) singing style on the songs she worked with him on. Also, is it just me or does Selena sound like she has a lot of phlegm in her throat during the spoken word bridge? Regardless, the choir that sings "Rise" ends the standard version of *Revival* pretty sweetly. There's also an [international version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7vWy_9v40E) that I just found about as I was writing this. It's not better.

**joshually** discusses daily trials and tribulations: "An inspirational song to help me through tough times - like the night before your tax returns are due or when someone gives me 10,000 spoons when all I need is a knife or when Starbucks puts one too little shot in my pumpkin spice latte (I can always tell, store #465)."

**TeamAwesome4**: "This chorus is a mess, and the rest of it is not good enough to justify it. And nobody needs more of this kind of song. At least this is over quickly."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "oh fuck I like it. Like I really really really really like it. Lyrics are perfect, I love the choir, this seems like a song that will be played in a movie while the main character is about to do the impossible (i mean that in a good way). Prediction: 2 years from now choirs will go to x-factor and sing this, Simon Cowell will love it and the choir will stay throughout the competition until they are eliminated in the semifinals. They will then fade into obscurity."

**calltehshots**: "You fell, sis"

**unreliablecynic**: "Why does this sound like a musical number from a failed Disney princess movie?"
