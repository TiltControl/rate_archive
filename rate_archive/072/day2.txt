notdallin: Before we start, I've noticed a severe lack of discussion and confusion surrounding the song of the summer. Maybe it's due to it being a "stale topic" ever since I've been a part of this sub (2 years and counting). So I'm looking forward to some discussion about this and some answers maybe from our knowledgeable hosts! First of all, does anyone know how the song of the summer is calculated? Especially these older ones that only became number one for like one week back in 19whatever. And a second question, when did the song of the summer become a thing? I noticed a lot of people in their comments yesterday saying that the SOTS of a certain year didn't feel very summery, was it a race back then? It definitely is now, when was the competition started? And when did artists consciously start preparing and trying to win the title of song of the summer? If anyone has any answers to these questions, I'd appreciate the response!

=====

skargardin: Oh wow, some points were made. We can definitely discuss this during the reveal

EDIT: On the top off my head, I remember that pre-1991 weeks at #1 were the greatest value in determining a song's ranking on the SOTS chart at total weeks at the Hot 100 were valued the least. The debut of Nielsen Music made tracking of radio and total sales the SOTS chart more reflective of those values. :)

---

**skargardin** (7): Cute little tune but otherwise I don’t really have much of substance to say about it, oop. It did manage to ever so slightly break into day 2 so that's cute!

**Leixander** (5): i thought we left 50s behind??

---

## Good, good Leroy Brown

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Leroy prob has a small dick tho

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I'm Leroy Brown

**sbb618** (10): Any time I hear this song, I can't help but sing along to the chorus, it's just so catchy.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Love story songs like this. Surprised it made the song of the summer in any decade, though

**Chevsapher** (9.2): The 70s had so many great story songs, including this one. Unfortunately, I have a feeling this rate won't do it justice.

**MrSwearword** (9): an absolute classic but in this field, struggles to get full marks because it can't measure up against the contenders.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): The power this man’s mustache holds…….

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I’m going on Wikipedia binges of all these songs right now, and, honestly, I’m surprised the guy who sang this is white. Apparently he died the year this got released, too. Sad day. I actually do really like this, as you can see just by looking at my score; this song is a fun folk tale, both lyrically and musically, and, rather distinctively, it is perhaps the only boogie-woogie song we’re ever going to rate.

**CarlieScion** (8): yaaaaaas!

**rosesmp3** (8): this slaps a bit

**vapourlomo** (8): RIP Jim Hopper (and Jim Croce)

**junobeekeeper** (7.8): This song is good, good, very good.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This bops a bit

**radiofan15** (7.5): R.I.P. Legend, he should have cancelled the tour and went back to live his life with his wife as he wanted instead of just constantly touring to pay a music career he didn't wanted to have... he truly deserved better!

**twat\_brained** (7.3): Is this what we call a "saloon tune"? I can't imagine another context in which this song would fit. The lyrics play out like a mid-20th century scripted barfight in which Leroy just starts a bunch of shit. Kinda like Cook from Skins I guess. I mean I actually quite appreciate it for the novelty, if nothing else.

**nick1372** (7): a bop and a half

**ryjomom** (7): funky

**vayyiqra** (7): Okay I hate this kind of music but this is a classic

**vhqv1997** (7): This song is a nice folk song to groove to, but even at 3 minutes it still feels long, so maybe the last choruses should have been cut down a bit

**waluigiest** (7): ya know it makes some points

## Bad, bad, Leroy Brown

**notdallin** (6.9): RIP but not really my cuppa tea

**\_turbovicki\_** (6): my dad stans this song

**AvatarKanol** (6): Okay but nothing special.

**agentofscranton** (5): jim out here trying to get leroy cancelled but leroy just out here being the bad, bad bitch we know he is - werk sis

**J\_Toe** (5): i know this song from the time the parrot sung it in Home Alone 3

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): pure camp

**jaztinax** (4): this song sounds like a pre-made track that’s on my keyboard. it might be, actually.

**peppersmith67** (3): this song has always annoyed the hell out of me and I have no means to explain why.

**SteelStepladder** (3): Am I the only one who doesn't understand how he's so bad

Other than OTR obviously ruling the charts but personally, I haven't listened to it that much so idk. I just want a bonafide Despacito smash to rule the summer again smh. 

I've been jamming to Kylie pretty much all summer though and Get Outta My Way has become my summer anthem sksks

notdallin: I'm a pretty big proponent of the song of the summer title only being given to the song Billboard crowns. That nomenclature is way too easy use flippantly for songs that people just like that happen to be released in the summer. I'm not sure what the solution to that is. But probably my top 5 songs I've been bopping to this summer are (even though they're somewhat controversial around these parts):

- Shawn & Camila's "Señorita"
- Ed Sheeran's "Beautiful People"
- Mark Ronson's "Find U Again"
- Charli XCX & Christine's "Gone"
- Lucy Dacus' "Forever Half Mast"

TragicKingdom1: If Hot Girl Summer were released a month earlier I feel like it would've been the definitive cultural SOTS (OTR would obviously beat it commercially of course)

**skargardin** (7): Billy better come thru with this banger but something about it also makes it leave me wanting more, sue me.

---

#king billy 

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Billy Joel is kinda a king tbh

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Billy Joel is an American Icon and I'm glad he got in here

**vhqv1997** (10): Billy Joel's catalogue is so amazing. I'm personally biased toward his 70s hits, but this song is definitely a classic that deserves to go day 3

**notdallin** (9.3): whenever a new r/popheads thread gets posted about breaking down nit-picky subgenres

**vapourlomo** (9): One of my most fiery hot takes: Billy Joel > Elton John. And this song bangs in a very dad-rock way.

**Chevsapher** (8.8): I'm not a Billy Joel fan, but he made some exceptional music. The verses on this track are exceptional.

**junobeekeeper** (8.7): Makes me wanna buy a Ford Mustang.

**SRTviper** (8.4): A 60’s throwback feels kind of silly after listening to how rapidly music changed in the 70’s , but this is still a pretty fun song.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): damn I ought to check out more of Billy's music he's certainly legendary for a reason

**radiofan15** (8.2): This isn't We Didn't Start The Fire!

**magikarpals** (8): he'd already peaked with the stranger but its a jam

**slimboyfriend** (8): Billy Joel is the ultimate basic 80s man, but he can definitely write a bop.

**1998tweety** (7.5): Bop

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): stream Bob Seger

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.2): Not Billy's best but still a solid bop

**jaztinax** (7): i love everything billy joel but this is one of the songs i don’t have any particular connection with

**waluigiest** (7): not billy joel’s best it’s kind of bland

**yourhostandpatron** (7): I don’t know how to respond to this song. I don’t know how to respond to Billy Joel, in general. I’m sure he has some underrated gems in his discography that I should try to listen to, and from what I’ve read about him he legitimately seems like a nice and intelligent man who has a real passion for music, but everything I’ve ever heard from him sounds like the musical equivalent of a Reader’s Digest editorial. This makes no difference in my opinion of him. I get that it’s supposed to be a generational observation of rock and roll being replaced by new wave and other genres, and good on him for not being an actual fucking Boomer and realizing that so early on, but as fascinating as this might be from the viewpoint of a cultural zenith, I’m still not sure what he’s trying to stay. Is he lamenting the loss of rock? Is he satirizing people who hold on too much of it? I’ve no bloody clue. Maybe he’s doing both, but a melody as corny as this isn’t helping me decide matters.  Sorry, Billy.

#not my rock and roll 

**minibjork** (6.5): great song to start off the 80s with

**CarlieScion** (6): it's still a 6 to me

**nick1372** (6): this one's tough because anything Billy Joel slaps but rock songs about how cool rock is all need to die

**J\_Toe** (5): is this that 'dad rock' i keep hearing about on this subreddit?

**MrSwearword** (5): eh, it's mercifully short but this is patronizing attempts satire at taking the piss out of modern society at that time

**vayyiqra** (5): Well at least now I know the name of this song, but it's a lot more obnoxious than I remember from when I was a kid

**peppersmith67** (4): All Billy Joel songs sound like tacky nursery rhyme karaoke for drunk dads.

**SteelStepladder** (2): His worst song. It's not even close

**LuckyKidA** (0): the worst song of the 80s

**Leixander** (10): Vooolaaaare! The way the lyrics flow and the smoothness of Domenico's vocals amaze me. A bit slow for popheads' taste though, which is probably why it will place in the lower end :(

**skargardin** (7): This is an enjoyable listen, italian is such a beautiful singing language. You can really feel all the emotions pouring out of him when he starts to belt. Classy and soulful, I’m glad that yall did it justice, this feels like a good placement for it. 

---

#I’m Italian

**letsallpoo** (10): go off sis

**MrSwearword** (10): even if it's 3rd place from Eurovision moreso than a summer song. Still, it's a cute wonderful Italian song

**napsandnetflix** (10): as a Domenico Modugno it is finally my time to SHINE.

**radiofan15** (9.2): We love an iconic Eurovision hit song and THE FIRST GRAMMY FOR RECORD OF THE YEAR... Celine is shook, the Rock Hallelujah guys have been found wigless, but ABBA remains unbothered.

**ExtraEater** (9): Italy's entry for Eurovision that year

**minibjork** (9): cute! didn't know such a lush italian song made it to song of the summer status in the u.s.

**notdallin** (9): don’t mind me as i bop to this in my swim cap and bathing suit that covers 88% of my body

**vhqv1997** (9): Italiophobic people trying to make this song go out day 1 because they don't understand the lyrics even though Google is right there

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Funny story: I was actually in the middle of doing this rate when I decided that I needed new headphones to rate the songs here and the ones from the other rate perfectly, and when I stepped into my local mall, the first thing I heard was this song. Volare (I’m not going to call it by its original title) is one of the great success stories of Eurovision, as well as one of the greatest testaments to how pretty 50s pop can be when you get past the really bland drags that fill it up. Also, it is worth noting that ‘volare’ as a word has the same etymology as ‘Voldemort’. You’re welcome.

**Chevsapher** (8.9): People forget that the fifties had some good music that wasn't rock and roll. This has a lovely arrangement and a clever hook; also, I'm a sucker for Italian lyrics.

**CarlieScion** (8): Unironically really beautiful

**J\_Toe** (8): I can imagine this being sampled well into a modern latin pop song, like the samples in Cardi B's I Like It or in Hold Up by Beyonce

**SteelStepladder** (8): I'm going to be generous because I've had this song stuck in my head since I've first heard it

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Was prepared to dismiss it for being in italian, but it's kind of fun.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.4): I had never heard this before, but I feel like I have. One of those timeless songs.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): No clue what he’s saying but it’s cute.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): sounds like someone took an instrumental that would play in Tom and Jerry and some guy in some fake language started singing

**LuckyKidA** (7): oh shit this was in the Lizzie McGuire Movie!

**magikarpals** (7): my mom had this as her ringtone

**ryjomom** (7): Finally some real music. You pophead stans wouldn’t know real music if it hit you with real Italian rah rah ah ah ro ma ro ma ma ga ga oo la la want your nel blu dipinto di blu. Have some damn culture in your life besides your daily Activia /s

**slimboyfriend** (7): I hate the chorus, but the rest of the song is so……….blutiful

**twat\_brained** (7): if nothing else I appreciate the novelty of an Italian song the predominantly Western anglophone music in this rate

**vapourlomo** (7): I wouldn't listen to this by choice, but it's kind of jaunty and nice. Best case scenario for Olive Garden music

**waluigiest** (7): this song is quiet but real nice and the chorus…. hot

**williamdowley123** (7): listening to this while playing papas pizzeria was an experience

#non va bene

**1998tweety** (6.5): I do not know what the lyrics to this are but it as a nice enough beat.

**bespectacIed** (6): can't believe the Volare song won the first ever grammy song AND record of the year

**jaztinax** (6): this song is so cute! i can imagine being somewhere on a beach in southern europe by sunset and hearing this song in the background

**sbb618** (6): It's nice enough, but super, super boring.

**vayyiqra** (6): It's catchy but why was this a hit?

**DrunkHurricane** (5): the late 50s and early 60s were a weird time for the charts - this hit #1, as did a song by a Belgian nun, an Alvin and the Chipmunks song, and fucking Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.

**peppersmith67** (5): in mezzo alla strada

**SRTviper** (5): A big problem with some of these older tracks is just quality of recording. I’m sure there is a good song here but I just can’t get past how tiny the harp and piano sound.

**Skargardin** (5.5) See, I have a love, hate relationship with this song which makes it hard to put a score on it. It’s obviously a goddamned classic but then again, it never really was that great to begin with. Memes and legacy can only carry you so far.

#HEEEEY MACARENA

**CarlieScion** (11): this is a GREAT summer bop. CLASSIC.

**AvatarKanol** (10): Preceeding similar hits like The Ketchup Song and Despacito. This iconic song left a big mark on music. This is a 10.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Latin excellence

**J\_Toe** (10): Woo! My birth year! Absolutely love the zany fashion in the video too!

**MrSwearword** (10): the original "WHY WAS THIS SONG A THING" before realizing, if nothing else is available, at least this shit services for something

**radiofan15** (10): ďąℓ€ ą ţµ ȼµ€яρ๏ ąℓ€ǥяɨą ʍąȼąя€ɲą ǭµ€ ţµ ȼµ€яρ๏ €$ ρą'ďąяℓ€ ąℓ€ǥяɨą ¥ ȼ๏$ą βµ€ɲą... €h ʍąяąя€ɲą....

**rslashpoopheads** (10): kind of legendary might give this my 11

**Chevsapher** (9.6): Say what you will, but this song is pure ear candy.

**sbb618** (9.5): The English parts are what knock it down from a 10. It's not really the Macarena unless the whole thing is unintelligible Spanish.

**ryjomom** (9): DNC SUMMER JAM

**junobeekeeper** (8.7): Finally a song that even white dads can dance to.

**1998tweety** (8): An iconic bop but I kind of got annoyed with it since I've heard it way too much

**jaztinax** (8): my 6-year old self wants to break out into dance so bad rn

**waluigiest** (8): honestly important

**williamdowley123** (8): a classic. when i was young i thought the words were 1 maca 2 maca 3 macarena 4 maca 5 maca 6 macarena

**notdallin** (7.9): the fact that this song permeated mainstream culture in possibly no way that any other song of the summer has is a feat in and of itself and makes me want to warrant it a perfect 10. How can you not reward a song where everyone on earth can do the dance and simultaneously know that Macarena can absolutely never be a real name considered for a baby born after 1995? Well... maybe if it sounds like this. A meme before memes were a thing, it almost isn’t music, but one giant symphonic joke.

**SRTviper** (7.5): This is what MIA would have sounded like if she was around in the mid 90’s.

**bespectacIed** (7): thinking about how strongly the GP in '96 probably loved this mess as much as i love old town road now, kind of a nightmare

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): At least I can dance to a song for once

**vayyiqra** (7): While a bop, this song has been ruined a bit by finding out the lyrics are really about a guy getting cucked by his girlfriend. What kind of concept for a goofy dance-pop song is that? However, finding out it samples "Situation" by Yazoo (a bop if there ever were one) means I can't hate it too much.

**vhqv1997** (7): Nobody has ever sung the lyrics of Macarena correctly. Nobody. Not even Los del Rio. Nobody.

#no bueno

**ignitethephoenix** (6): The Macarena chorus part is iconic, the rest of the song is shit.

**peppersmith67** (6): this song is too stupid to hate

**SteelStepladder** (6): weirdly more of a song than I remember

**vapourlomo** (6): Fun for the first minute. Painful after that.

**nick1372** (5): I've just seen too many white people dancing to this

**slimboyfriend** (5): I can’t tell if I love this song or hate it. So here’s a 5.

**magikarpals** (4): dale a tu cuerpo alegria, Macarena! y a mi da la version original

**LeninaCrowne94** (3.4): Just let it die already

**twat\_brained** (0): So I WAS planning to give "Light My Fire" my 0 but since this is somehow in the rate, I'll show a bit more respect to the dead. I hate this song and I hate that it's in the rate

**yourhostandpatron** (0): Look, I really enjoy Spanish as a language, but I just can’t get the love for this one. It’s not even like other dance crazes that we’ve rated where I’d prefer to hear this while I’m on the floor myself instead of while I’m home all along with just my headphones. I’d never dance to this because it’s as annoying as fuck. There’s no variation here. It’s just a hook that sounds like the sonic equivalent of slipping on a banana peel over and over again, and I never want to hear it one more time in my entire life. Adios.

**Skargardin** (7): Ah yes, Usher, simpler then when he was on the radio. Confessions Part II however, feels kinda irrelevant in hindsight. I don’t think that anyone will remember this over the other Usher classics and tbh, I actually had never heard of it before hosting this reveal oop. It’s good but there’s not much to write home about. 

**Leixander** (4): Usher's falsetto is his redeeming quality, but it doesn't save this song for me.

---
# i must confess….

**MrSwearword** (10): Usher knew how to sing about Jermaine Dupri's struggle.

**bespectacIed** (9): the tinnitus-like bit in the background that sounds like a nokia button pressed 298382 times ruins this RnB masterpiece. 2004 usher was an ERA

**ImADudeDuh** (9): serving not me at church

**Chevsapher** (8.8): The lyrical content is refreshing, and I could spend days listening to Usher song over himself.

**radiofan15** (8.8): Glee DID outsold but Usher did fine too.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): can you believe Usher invented R&B in the 90s and didn't step off our necks until the 2010s? he may be over now but damn if he didn't have a hell of a run

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bop

**sbb618** (8): Drags on a bit longer than I remembered, but still smooth as hell.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Feels weird that a song that is explicitly the second part of something got big enough to be on this list. But ok.

**waluigiest** (8): some of the harmonies are fuckin nuts

**peppersmith67** (7.8): there never would have been a part 2 if you used a rubber Usher cmon dude you're supposed to be better than this. and no Usher you don't deserve another chance get your life together man.

**minibjork** (7): glee has tainted my mind i can only think about that fucking confessions/it's my life mashup they did i hate my life

**slimboyfriend** (7): This song is so specific that I can’t believe it became a hit. I know it’s by USHER, but is this considered a novelty song?

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): It's alright

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Look, I have no way why I actually enjoy this instead of outright despising it, so if y’all are giving this low scores, don’t come knocking on my door; I don’t necessarily disagree with you. This is cheesy stuff, especially with Usher breaking into those eye-rolling monologues about begging his partner to stay halfway into the song, and if it didn’t work for Jason Derulo, then this shouldn’t have worked for him. But in a strange kind of way that makes me slightly ashamed, I’ve ended up taking a liking to this; sure, the implications are awful, but maybe I’ve taken a liking to words that would normally be devastating or the scandal of the town being sung over such a relaxed beat. That contradiction, in a way, makes me a fan of this song; I don’t really adore it, but at least Usher sings better than Derulo.

# ~~i still BELIEEVE~~ that this is mediocrity

**SteelStepladder** (6): This song is bold but if you take a few steps back it's also really dumb

**junobeekeeper** (5.5): Not feeling it tbh. There's nothing wrong with it, but what is right with it?

**CarlieScion** (5): these are my confessions: i dont really like ushers music

**vayyiqra** (5): Well that was a waste of three and a half minutes

**nick1372** (4): Who cares about your confessions usher. Why was this the song of the summer. I don't even think this is a bad song but why did the whole country care about this?

**notdallin** (3): is this song supposed to make me sympathize with cheaters? All it does is fade out without actually resolving over one of the most annoying beats I’ve ever heard (ft. a single high pitched guitar note repeated every 16th note of the song)

**rslashpoopheads** (1): oh my god this is so boring

skargardin: On the topic of SOTS's that don't feel summer-y, both Confessions and this next upcoming song are in that lane.

notdallin: I think summeriness is important; needing to be upbeat, danceable, carefree, usually more jovial seem to be requirements nowadays. But it didn't always seem to be this way. I wonder when/why it changed?

skargardin: The jovial, upbeat, nostalgic requirement for me i think is mostly due to nostalgia and what we used to listen to on the radio back in the days. I just find it hard to imagine that anyone could have a "bad guy"-esque song as their summer anthem, but then again im not really in the target audience oop

**skargardin** (10): An actual example of a song being long not just for the sake of being long? Bitch I LIVE for the change in tempo and the instrumental variations, come thru keyboard solo. Some of you did point out that we should’ve rated the single version but honestly, this is incredible and makes up for it’s long length with variations in instrumentals. I live.

**Leixander** (7): The guitar solo part is amazing but the portion before it could be deleted by like a minute. Also, the instrumentals in the beginning here sometimes sound like the Wii Shop tune.

---

#some points 

**vhqv1997** (11): If yall tasteless flops give this song a bad score but keep raving about Venice Bitch by Lana we're gonna have to talk

#lit

**junobeekeeper** (10): Yes! I like psychedelic stuff so this is cool. Every single criticism of The Doors is valid of course, but I do really really love this song.

**radiofan15** (10): Val Kilmer left me wigless!

**sbb618** (10): Really? This seven-minute Jim Morrison drug trip of a track was the song of the summer? Man, the sixties were wild.

**SRTviper** (10): The Keyboard/Organ on this song is god tier. This might actually be the best song of the 60's.

**SteelStepladder** (10): Looooooooooooove it

**vayyiqra** (10): I've always loved this song. Yeah I know, The Doors are pretentious, this is still an amazing song

**minibjork** (9.5): gave this a 10 & then remembered how drawn out the keyboard solo was whoop

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): between Wild Thing and this song, ‘66-’67 was really THE time to be a horny man huh

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): It is illegal to hate Jim Morrison

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): I’m curious to see where this will rank, because on one hand, this is a fantastic song, but on the other hand, this is a seven minute epic that belongs to a genre Popheads basically loathes. As somebody who had a dumb classic rock phase back when I was twelve, I actually never listened to the Doors at all, and I’ve expected Jim Morrison’s voice to be more...mystical than his baritone on Light My Fire. I am also surprised that this is a straightforward love song with no hidden references in it! Maybe this song is as basic as the Doors get, at least thematically. It probably is! But, hey, it’s still awesome.

**Chevsapher** (9.4): This track is ridiculously long, the stereo mixing is overdone, and the fire/fire rhyme in the chorus is laughable. With that said, the instrumental arrangements are indescribly incredible, and despite its terrible rhymes, the hook is a legitimate earworm.

**LeninaCrowne94** (9.1): This was my JAM when I was 14 and in my classic rock phase. Perfectly captures the summer of love and why 67 was one of the greatest years for music.

**waluigiest** (9): is this excellent or just long?

**peppersmith67** (8.4): back when seven minute jam sessions could be the song of the summer what a time to be alive.

**notdallin** (8.1): DAE this song sounds like the monster mash????

**vapourlomo** (8): Jim Morrison is super overrated but that keyboard riff bangs

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): good but i think i'd like a radio edit better

**ignitethephoenix** (7): The beginning sounds like Pokémon music (tbh the whole song minus the singing sounds like Pokémon music). I really like that production it’s definitely very innovative. Would have been better if it was shorter. Summer songs should not be 7 minutes long.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok maybe less keyboard next time

**J\_Toe** (7): I like how easy it is to misread the Doors' logo as Sloop.

#length =/= artsy 

**1998tweety** (6): GIDLE outskinned, sorry not sorry. This is meh and the length doesn't help it.

**MrSwearword** (6): I for sure don't think "summer" with this one. I think "oh, what every fucking 60s documentary must consider using for their soundtrack/key point". Even then, I don't really find myself wanting to listen to this song.

**nick1372** (6): china set the night on fire??

**rslashpoopheads** (6): this is kinda dope but also too long for my attention span

**AvatarKanol** (5): Usually when I listen to songs I prefer longer ones. This is not the case. This is a song that and overstays it's welcome. It has all the elements of an amazing song, but it's too long. Almost skipped it halfway through.

**jaztinax** (5): the second half of the ‘60s is not impressing me so far. wasn’t “respect” by aretha franklin charting this year? the disrespect. also, why were the producers/musicians loving high frequencies so much? I have a headache.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): there is no excuse for this long of an annoying instrumental i don't care if it's artsy

**hefellapart** (2.5): this hurts my head.

**CarlieScion** (2): this is so long. for no damn reason.

**hikkaru** (2): 7 mins... i don't got all day ma (yes i'm a basic bitch that can't stand any song longer than four minutes drag me)

**ryjomom** (2): keyboard was obnoxious

**twat\_brained** (2): wow Todd in the Shadows was right, sometimes singing "fire" over the chorus is all a song really needs. And yet the Doors only get more attention because Jim is a 27 clubber. Sigh. EDIT: this song is 7 minutes long? that keyboard solo just feels like a jam sesh, why the hell would you record that? MUCH LESS FOR THAT AMOUNT OF TIME? I just checked and apparently this is the longest song in the rate. Meanwhile a number of the songs here don't even make it to 3 minutes. I guess another issue is that the mixing is non-optimal for earphone listening, since the keyboards and guitar are really loud in my right ear yet all I hear is the drums in my left ear. I'm in a petty mood today, so just because of the song's length and lack of lyrics, I'm giving it a 3. Fuck the Doors and fuck Jim Morrison's terrible attempt at singing.

**williamdowley123** (2): sorry but this just hurt my ears for a solid 7 minutes so no

**skargardin** (9): A jam that i was afraid would do terribly but it actually got into the top 30! At one point it was even close to getting into the top 20 which would’ve been a wig snatch but alas. The kazoos that come on just before the second verse send me. It’s honestly such a feel-good groovy banger.

**Leixander** (8.5): Not really hard to see why this was the song of the summer, the tune here is undeniably catchy. The horn section in the middle is gorgeous.

# tossin 10s

**CarlieScion** (10): BOP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this kinda fucking slaps? i could do without whatever child's instrument they play, but this is a bop???

**MrSwearword** (10): now we've amped up the fact that this is summer

**radiofan15** (10): Love the energy on this one! also OBLIGATORY ANIMAL HOUSE COMMENT.

**waluigiest** (10): this energy… we could never make something like this in 2019

**Chevsapher** (8.7): This is really fun, and the hook is genius. I only wish the mix was cleaner.

**SRTviper** (8.7): This is an absolute jam. Those horns really speak to my insomnia.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): kinda a bop

**vhqv1997** (8): Take out the part about missing his lover and this song is written about me at night with insomnia

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Now that I think about it, this might be the only straight up rock and roll state. Satisfaction is arguably already classic rock on its own, Light My Fire definitely is, and Wild Thing has a...countrier vibe to it, I suppose? I go back and forth between being annoyed by this and really enjoying the energy here, but it probably is better than I remember it to be.

**junobeekeeper** (7.8): King of Insomnia!

**1998tweety** (7): This bops a lil but it also got kind of messy at a point

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This song is relatable as fuck.

**J\_Toe** (7): this is cute, but not that cute. I can imagine it being played for a tv sing and dance show a la the music in Hairspray

**sbb618** (7): At least this one is fun, even if there's not much to it.

**slimboyfriend** (7): Needs more chunky sax

**SteelStepladder** (7): I want to do the mashed potato to this

**vapourlomo** (7): It's a weaker version of The Twist, but that still means it's solid enough

# turnin it down 

**notdallin** (6.8): those high-pitched horns sound UNREAL

**peppersmith67** (6.2): Hard to judge this when every song from 1961 sounded exactly like this.

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): Hey, it would've been fun and hip back then.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Is this a song about his wife getting fucked by the milkman? Wild.

**twat\_brained** (6): yeah, I can see how a song like this would be all the rage in the summer of 1961

**vayyiqra** (5): boring

**skargardin** (6.7): I’ve never had much of a interest in Tears for Fears or this song in particular. Flashbacks to middle school when my straight friends tried to indoctrinate me into getting into their music. The synths are arguably pretty cool but it doesn’t really wow me. 

---

## old but gold

**vapourlomo** (11): One of the '80s most underrated hits. It builds and builds until it reaches this massive, U2-esque arena rock perfection. Killer keyboard and guitar solos. It's unbeatable.

**ExtraEater** (10): Fuck yeah icons

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended whatever cleaning product Shout is, i don't really know what it is tbh

**junobeekeeper** (10): While Tears For Fears aren't my favorite 80s duo, this song is just fantastic

**letsallpoo** (10): gay icons

**magikarpals** (10): sh'mon

**vayyiqra** (10): This is an amazing song and the album it's from is incredibly underrated. If you like new wave, listen to it.

**Chevsapher** (9.6): I always forget how epic this track actually is. The way the production slowly builds on itself is incredibly satisfying.

**1998tweety** (9): This bops a lil, sound like I lot of the older music my dad listens to.

**J\_Toe** (9): oh hey, tears for fears are one of those 80s bands with indie red today, like Talk Talk and Talking Heads.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): This is officially the first Tears For Fears song I have ever heard. Believe it or not, I’ve managed to avoid Everybody Wants To Rule The World. I can’t even remember what the Lorde cover sounds like! That tangent is, by the way, related to my judgement of Shout as a cultural moment; despite standing for pretty much every pop related trend that arose in the early to mid 80, the way Shout summons up our feelings of paranoia makes it lyrically seem like a song from a more anxious time, such as ours. I love it as a stream of frustration and energy, and I’m interested to know the alt pop it must’ve inspired today thematically.

**notdallin** (8.5): currently living for those final fantasy overworld airship synths

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I love having a MOOD

**CarlieScion** (8): shout (make me wanna) by janis joplin outsold

**SteelStepladder** (8): Cheesy but I like it quite a bit

**radiofan15** (7.5): I guess this is fine and everything but I don't understand how is was THAT popular.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): kinda overrated but it still sounds cool

**JunkyGS** (7): I now know and realize why it is called "Scream & Shout". Britney Fans shook

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): It's a bop but it's too long

**rslashpoopheads** (7): moody adventure vibes I dig

**waluigiest** (7): this sounds like a piece of music from another planet but it could lean into that energy a bit more

## these people prefer silence 

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Would be better if they didn’t drag it out as much

**sbb618** (6.5): This sounds like it was written on a default track you get when you buy a keyboard

**AvatarKanol** (5): Mediocre song, suprisingly made by the same people that made one of the best songs of all time, Everybody Wants To Rule The World.

**nick1372** (4): not enough shouting

**bespectacIed** (3): overrated noise, SOPHIE does pots and pans better

**MrSwearword** (3): ugh, this group more famous for being considered "underrated" or being heaped with praise that songs like this show are undeserved as fuck. It's not complete trash but I have no interest in this song

**Leixander** (8): Without this Charli wouldn't have the money to fund her future endeavors, so thank you Iggy!

**skargardin** (7): Overhated bop. Iggy has a good flow and Charli sounds AMAZING on the hook. This also seems to be one of those cases where you either love Charli’s hook or HATE it, no middle-ground. 

---

## I FANCY YOU  

**1998tweety** (10): A mega bop even though TWICE outsold. Some of y'all are tripping cause even though Charli is great on this and her chorus is so iconic, it's honestly Iggy's lines "First things first I'm the realest" that are the most remembered and quoted.

**bespectacIed** (10): Twice's departure from their sweet bubblegum pop sound into a more mature electropop one without losing their essence is nothing short of impressive. The hook "fancyyy 🤟 youuuu uwu" is this year's most addicting. (jk iggy and charli ATE this)

**CarlieScion** (10): I-G-G-Y!

**ExtraEater** (10): Great song but Timber was the real song of the summer

**ryjomom** (10): Peppa Pig wishes she had a hit this big

**twat\_brained** (10): When those opening notes start, all bets are off. This should NOT hold up 5 years after the fact, but it just does. I think Charli's vocals really help make the song what it is, despite this being arguably the best Iggy has ever sounded on a track. Also, who in 2014 would've believed that Charli would be a bigger gay icon than Iggy?

**Chevsapher** (9.2): Charli's hook contrasts well with Iggy's in-your-face rapping. Overall, this track has a magnetic appeal that's hard to explain.

**radiofan15** (9.2): Two bright and promising females joining forced in what is bound to be the first of multiple hits and a long and iconic careers without any label interference and without controversies... what's not to like about it?

**AvatarKanol** (9): Iggy and Charli create a great combo in this song. Sassy and full of bad bitch energy, this is a song that deserves it's place among the songs of the summer. Very good.

**sbb618** (9): First things first, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaryllis

**SRTviper** (9): This is the best song from this decade in this rate. It has a ton of personality and some seriously powerful performances.

**vapourlomo** (9): Charli XCX's single-handedly gives this song like 7 points

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): charli's chorus is TRASH you heard it here first

**peppersmith67** (8.2): I'm glad that as a society we only allowed Iggy Azalea to have this one hit and then immediately ghosted her. Love u Charli!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song goes off extra hard when you are drunk not gonna lie

**slimboyfriend** (8): I know I’m supposed to hate this song because of Iggy and racial politics and her freestyle(s), but this song is so good. Charli MAKES it with that hook and bridge, and I was so excited that she was finally getting recognized and avoiding the Iggy hate since I started stanning her in high school. But also….. Iggy. It’s 2014. Why u gotta say “retarded”

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Iggy deserves better than where her career went after this

**notdallin** (7.4): Iggy officially the only one slinging around the word “retarded” in 2014.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): One of Charli's 4 good songs, the others being Boom Clap, Boys, and Vroom Vroom maybe.

**J\_Toe** (7): This song was everywhere here in Australia (even though it's winter during America's summer). Also, Charli <3

## stream FANCY by TWICE instead

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): This is essentially the Informer of our times; on one hand, it’s corny, gentrified shit delivered to you by a fake accent, but on the other hand, it, rather unfortunately, kind of slaps. I’d rather hang out with Snow than Iggy, though; Informer is a better song, and he actually seems like a guy who respects the cultures that he as a privileged person borrows from. Seriously, though, this is my biggest guilty pleasure in this rate. I’m ashamed for liking it. Why, on why couldn’t Fancy’s beat have gone to a better person?

**vayyiqra** (6): tbh Charli's part is the only good part; I don't think this is an unpopular opinion. I saw her sing it live in 2014 where she did every part herself though, and for some reason it was rock and sped up a lot. It was an improvement.

**SteelStepladder** (5): If it weren't for Charli this song would get a three

**williamdowley123** (5): those heys in the background are SO grating

**LeninaCrowne94** (4.5): Could've been a bad bitch anthem but fell just short

**magikarpals** (4): the beginning is okay

**waluigiest** (4): cool we all get an iggy azalea thinkpiece. fuck her whack ass for musical blackface and literal slurs in this song. admittedly this is one of the most iconic opening lines in modern music history, and at least charli has had a glow up since then

**junobeekeeper** (3.4): This and Boom Clap put me off Charli XCX for quite some time so… yeah

**nick1372** (3): Everything wrong with this song has already been said. "First things first." "My flow is r-----d" "I-G-G-Y" Even Charli sounds awful on this, the production doesn't suit her at all

**MrSwearword** (1): It's still heinous, unlistenable garbage years later

**skargardin** (7): Yet another severe flashback to my rock period in middle school while listening to The Eagles. I’m actually surprised at how relatively high it is but was it too straight to be rated higher? discuss

**Leixander** (6): I must confess I was never interested in Eagles' music, I already forgot what this song was about while writing this comment.

---

#mighty eagles 

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the instrumental is honestly amazing

**agentofscranton** (9): one of my favourite popheads moments is when that one person thought that the eagles were an obscure indie band lmao

**bespectacIed** (9): This isn't the Red Velvet song?

**ExtraEater** (9): One of those really good nights

**ryjomom** (9): reminds me of a summer night on a desert highway as the sun is setting

**Chevsapher** (8.7): I made myself listen to this track twice so I could wrap my head around it, and I liked it much more the second time. The guitar textures are exceptional.

**AvatarKanol** (8): Great vibe. Love the guitar.

**jaztinax** (8): the sultry bass line in the intro gets me every time. i’m getting seduced by this song. and it might be me being exposed to such high frequencies, but did i hear a whistle note??

**MrSwearword** (8): mainly because the production is great and nothing else

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Stream One of Those Nights Power Up by Red Velvet

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the eagles hold up pretty well but they can't compare to the blue jean committee in terms of 70s soft rock bands

**vayyiqra** (8): The Eagles are literal dad rock, as in they are what my father listens to, but I'm not mad about this song even a lot of their songs are bad.

**waluigiest** (8): pleasant, fun, well written

**twat\_brained** (7.6): why is this not as memorable an Eagles song as Hotel California? y'all have weird taste when determining your classics

**1998tweety** (7.5): Red Velvet outsold, this does bop though

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Oh she’s a lil funky

**notdallin** (7.4): SMWS - “Eagles are so interesting, they’re like Payless shoes, y’know? There’s so much that I should like but there’s just something not there.”

**peppersmith67** (7.4): Doesn't really stand out today but i'm such a slut for a good male falsetto ill let it slide

**minibjork** (7.2): the dad rock has come

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): Eagles have that quintessential "American" classic rock sound which I've grown tired of, but this is still one of my favorites. It's no "Hotel California" though.

**sbb618** (7): This song just goes on and on and way overstays its welcome

**SteelStepladder** (7): The song is carried by the bass but boy oh boy it slaps

**vhqv1997** (7): This song got a kickass guitar riff, but the lyrics are... problematic, to say the least. I can't be the only person that was creeped out by the way the singer's advances were portrayed

# pop-rock? idkher

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Can anybody remind me whether the Eagles count as classic rock or not again? Because this is one of the most watered down classic rock songs I’ve ever heard, and I don’t even like classic rock outside of David Bowie. I’m aware that I’m selling my soul to r/music when I say this, but Hotel California, the only Eagles song I’ve ever heard (gee, that’s an unusual one, eh, fellows?) is much better both conceptually and musically than this boring pop rock hit. It’s not bad, but it falls into the dreaded threshold of being inoffensive. And arguably, it begins a trend for this rate’s lineup!

**junobeekeeper** (6.3): I'm not really an Eagles fan. I asked my mom who loves the Eagles about this song and she just said "it's not even that iconic anymore".

**radiofan15** (6.2): Ugh I hate the Eagles but I also kinda liked this song... HELP!

**vapourlomo** (6): This song is fine. But in general, I act like a cliche Gen Xer and agree with The Dude when it comes to the Eagles.

**SRTviper** (4.2): The 70’s were evidently a battle between adult contemporary and cheesy dad rock. I’m not sure who to root for.

**skargardin** (9): This song makes me feel like a movie star in an old Hollywood movie. Such a mood. It’s close to perfection even though this doesn’t speak summer at all we’re able to forgive it cause Karen did what? THAT with her vocals. 

**Leixander** (7.5): Very cute but too mellow to be a summer hit I guess?

---

## i’m not crying, you’re crying

**junobeekeeper** (11): RIP Karen. This is soft pop perfection and it brings a smile to my face every time I hear it.

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the greatest love songs of all time.

**J\_Toe** (10): omg I love this song so much I learned to play it on piano! Not well. And in fact, I ended up having to give up the piano owing to my scoliosis. But still, this song slaps.

**MrSwearword** (10): OK IT'S NOT SUMMERY AT ALL, BUT THIS SONG IS LEGENDARY AND KAREN CARPENTER DESERVED BETTER HAVING BEEN A FLAWLESS VOCALIST

**notdallin** (10): an absolutely perfect love song from start to finish. A simple longing--not a crush, not a hook-up, not even a marriage--just wanting to be close. It’s beautiful

**rosesmp3** (10): i'm crying

**sailormunelune** (10): Timeless

**vhqv1997** (10): I actually like the single version more than this because it's trimmed down to the perfect length to replay, but this song is still a freaking classic that deserves top 5. The simple imagery but silky vocal delivery combined make this song absolutely enchanting, befitting the message in the most perfect way I've ever head.

**Chevsapher** (9.9): Mankind did not deserve the Carpenters.

**peppersmith67** (9.5): real talk we need to go back and give The Carpenters the proper credit they deserve everything they touched was a hit.

**radiofan15** (9.3): UGH this is so soothing and atmospheric and cute and romantic.

**CarlieScion** (9): i cant listen to this without imagining a dramatic movie scene. is the dramatic movie scene from simpsons - the movie? maybe.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): iconic chorus, but goes on too long

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): I love how soft it is

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): classic american idol staple

**AvatarKanol** (8): A song that is very cute. The production sounds very magical and I can feel all the emotion that the lyrics want to convey. The trumphets were surprising but they fit into the mood of the song.

**vayyiqra** (8): Remember when this was on The Simpsons? Weird association but I like it

**waluigiest** (8): soft :–)

**1998tweety** (7.5): Sabrina Carpenter outsold but this is cute too

**vapourlomo** (7.5): This is cheesy af but damn if it doesn't still work

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): The Carpenters aren’t a duo that I’d listen to over anything else, and their cover of Ticket To Ride is still horrendous, but I don’t mind a lot of their work, even if overlaps with all sorts of kitschy shit. Karen Carpenter has a genuinely good voice, and it’s hard not to feel sorry for her considering her eventual fate; Close To You is a lovely little romantic venture that I enjoy, although it might be nothing special. In more interesting news, there’s a Carpenters song about meeting aliens that freaked the hell out of me as a kid, and to this day I can’t believe it still exists. I’m not joking about this. Look this up. It has sound effects and everything.

**agentofscranton** (7): i always think i hate this song until i actually listen to it and i get butterflies (by kacey musgraves)

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): It's cute and all, but this will never not be Homer and Marge's wedding song

**nick1372** (7): trumpets?????

**ryjomom** (7): beautiful, charming and simplistic

**slimboyfriend** (7): The gentle voice of Karen Carpenter makes up for the cheesy lyrics

**SteelStepladder** (7): This song is cute.

## isleep

**SRTviper** (6.8): This makes me think of that one song from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

**jaztinax** (6.5): just realized the intro sounds like “home” from the wiz sped up. anyway. am i the only one who thinks all the instruments sound very… amateur-ish? maybe they’re just simplistic. i feel like I shouldn’t have said that. harmonies on point though.

**magikarpals** (6): cute but i kept thinking that 'what the world needs now is love' was going to start playing

**DrunkHurricane** (5): 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀

**rslashpoopheads** (5): who

**twat\_brained** (4): ……why does the song stop for like 20 seconds only to start uh with the dopey ass vocalization? makes no sense. And I can literally picture seeing a couple slow dance to this at a wedding thinking it's cute when really easy listening bollocks like this just makes me want to sleep

#confirmed stalkers

**agentofscranton** (10): this is like the third time we've rated this song and it still will not win - serving Shangela/Cirie Fields teas

**ignitethephoenix** (10): My all time favourite song about stalking.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this is it folks

**SteelStepladder** (10): One of the most perfect songs to ever exist

**vapourlomo** (10): Definitely the GOAT stalker anthem

**radiofan15** (9.7): Of the two versions of this song included on this rate, this is somehow the inferior one!

**Chevsapher** (9.2): I would rate this song higher if it wasn't so overplayed. In my opinion, the Police were perhaps the best rock act of their time. Their arrangements and production are incredibly nuanced.

**junobeekeeper** (8.9): Great song about stalking!! I should be creeped out but like… Sting isn't creepy weird he's pretentious weird.

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.7): Yeah it's a "stalker anthem" but it's a damn good one.

**minibjork** (8.5): it's been said over and over again how creepy this is but i still love the bridge

**sbb618** (8.5): Yeah, it's good, but it's never really clicked for me.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): A song that gets better every time I hear it; I am no longer as turned off by the raspiness of Sting’s vocals as I used to be, nor am I as immediately repulsed by use of a stalker’s voice, although the lyrics still unnerve me just as much. I do admit that I can’t find anything superb about this, which is why I don’t really love it, exactly, but there’s no denying that it’s a solid backburner of a classic.

**1998tweety** (8): Does Titanium sample this? Sounds a lil similar

**CarlieScion** (8): creepy.

**J\_Toe** (8): real creepy lyrics. Really good musically, though (and the plucked guitar strings part sounds like it influenced Fallin' All In You by Shawn Mendes).

**nick1372** (8): a classic

**notdallin** (8): i was about to come in here guns a-blazin to defend how this song is not creepy and stuff but Y’ALL. I JUST FOUND OUT THAT IT’S ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A CREEPY SONG ABOUT CONTROL AND SURVEILLANCE OF ANOTHER PERSON OMG I-

**ryjomom** (8): stalker song but catchy af

**slimboyfriend** (8): Surprisingly not the creepiest song on this rate.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Hella creepy, but stil a decent song

**vayyiqra** (8): It's still a great song even though knowing its lyrics are a lot more creepy than everyone thinks they are kind of ruined it.

**waluigiest** (8): honestly the little chorus modulation is so important.

**DrunkHurricane** (7): even if you completely ignore the lyrics I don't get how people think this sounds romantic

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): overrated

#someone call the police

**jaztinax** (5): only sting could get away with writing a song about a creepy stalker and it gets passed off as one of the most iconic love songs.

**MrSwearword** (5): stalker anthem spam aside, this song lowkey sucks because production this fabulous is wasted on Sting.

**twat\_brained** (5): right I've heard this song 3 times in rates and now and each time I've decried the Stalker With a Crush motif within the song's lyrics. Sting apparently has said as much in the face of those who think it's a love song. I'm legit considering not doing a rate like this again just because EBYT is in it.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): one of the most overrated songs of all time, don't @ me

**SRTviper** (4): The 80's were off to such a good start.

**peppersmith67** (3.5): i'll take the fake sad Diddy version over this toxic cis nonsense any day of the week.

**bespectacIed** (2): I only acknowledge the Biggie tribute song

#not to be dramatic but i hollered

**TragicKingdom1** (2): problematic and also sounds like shit

**Leixander** (10): Pop-rock songs from this era were so good, a revival of this era would be wonderful.

**skargardin** (8): Oh look, here it is, once again, the problematic Katy bop. I’ll let the comments speak for themselves, opinions were definitely had, *once again*

---

## the essays 

**SRTviper** (11): The best pop song of the 2000s. That’s just true.

**1998tweety** (10): Copying my comment from the last rate this was in cause I put a lot of effort into that lmao: Something tells me I'm gonna have to harshly defend this song. So first the subject matter; I know Rita Ora's Girls caused a lot of controversy on the sub and I completely get why. Personally I love the song and think its fine but I understand that some LGBT people don't like the message that being bi is just something you do for fun while drunk. On that note though, for some people it is easier to experiment when under the influence, so I don't think its fair to invalidate those people's experiences. I think an issue arises when “get drunk and makeout” songs are the only ones we have. If there were more LGBT songs then this wouldn't be an issue, Katy and Rita's songs would be in the minority so no one would really complain about then since they're not the only songs being made by LGBT artists. Now that thats over with I'll talk about Katy's song. The lyrics aren't as fancy as the previous song, but there are still some cool metaphors, cherry chapstick for example. For me the highlights of this song is the vibe and Katy's vocals. I love the production on this song, theres a stellar rock version as well. Katy's vocals work best with a rock edge imo. Her belts sound a bit better with production thats a bit rougher around the edges compared to the super polished pop she now makes. Don't get me wrong I love TD, but OOTB will always have a special place in my heart.

**agentofscranton** (10): problematic? kinda. a bop? hell yeah. hotel? trivago.

**hikkaru** (10): ugh problematic bop

**radiofan15** (10): Invented bi-curiosity and lesbians... Rota Ora is shook!

**rosesmp3** (10): a problematic bop

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Katy really sounds like a rockstar in this banger of a track. I know this song has become somewhat controversial, but 2008 was a different time.

**AvatarKanol** (9): One of the songs that launched Katy Perry into the stratosphere. Despite the somewhat controversial theme the song still holds up and shows us that Katy Perry was once a force to be recokned with.

**bespectacIed** (9): Kinda funny how problematic this was in 2008 because people don't like gay shit, but in 2019 it's problematic because of the stereotypes to lesbian/bisexuals

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I don’t care if this is problematic, it bopped then, still bops now and will always bop.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): coming for highest controversey score

**williamdowley123** (9): i know im supposed to say this is problematic but its fun and catchy and i wouldnt be mad at a straight boy singing i kissed a boy so

**notdallin** (8.6): “Queerbaiting!!” they’ll chant. Though not an OK way of selling your song at any time period, this song was perhaps a really important stepping stone that helped bridge the discussion of gender politics that pervades the 2010s. Plus it’s a banger with fun, problematic, carefree contemporaries that would make me super pumped for a 2008-centric dance party. Imagine it, “Low,” “Shake It,” “Disturbia,” “When I Grow Up,” “Forever,” “Lollipop”... the list goes on.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): It's a good song

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah, I could be all woke and bash the lyrics for being ~problematic~, or I could just enjoy this song. Yes, it's a little cringe, but it bops. The production is gloriously 2008, and I live for it.

**vhqv1997** (8): This song advanced the gay agenda by 10 years and Ur So Gay pushed it back by also 10 years

**waluigiest** (8): gays were invented

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): Yeah it's "problematic" but it still slaps

**peppersmith67** (7): It's hilarious how much this song legitimately SHOCKED people back in the day.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): stream SISTAR

**slimboyfriend** (7): Song of the summer should be hot, and nothing’s hotter than trivializing bisexuality. Take any lyric from this song to see everything wrong with discussions around bisexuality in 2008. How far we’ve come! The song itself is actually fine.

**vapourlomo** (7): This song is way too problematic to give more than an 7. ...that said, it still kind of bangs?

## this again? 

**magikarpals** (6.7): throwback to the homophobic backlash to this one

**junobeekeeper** (6.4): Oof I'm a lesbian and I should be like "this song is fetishitic and gross" and talk about how I don't like it, but I actually do. I just can't justify scoring it any higher. It's really catchy though!

**CarlieScion** (6): As A LesbianTM this kinda makes me uncomfortable but i respect the bop-value in it

**yourhostandpatron** (6): Can I be honest with y’all? To be honest, I don’t really pass judgement on Katy’s character for this song anymore, since she’s admitted that she’s had more serious experiences with girls than drunken kisses recently and that she’d have written this song differently today, but I think y’all who think this doesn’t come off across as accidentally fetishizing at the very least really need to listen to queer women. We’re objectified all the damn time in the exact same ways the lyrics portray homoerotic female escapism in, and in hindsight they’re much more painful than I remembered them being; as a nonbinary person who’s familiar with and adjacent to the lesbian community, I just get kinda grossed out when I listen to this, whether it was intentional or not. Musically, this is a bit of a bop, but it’s honestly eclipsed by a lot of other songs on One of the Boys; yes, it was Katy’s debut, but I’d feel better if we’d just bury it and focus on her better, less problematic songs instead.

**\_turbovicki\_** (5): Lyrics: 0. Instrumental: 10. I'd love it if Katy returns to this pop-rock sound because her voice suits it!

**nick1372** (5): ah yes. katy perry's glory days of taking advantage of the gays

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Everything that I could say about this song has been said before. So I'll just say, even musically, I don't think this song is good.

**SteelStepladder** (4): I always found this song icky

**twat\_brained** (4): not even the song can make up for Dr Luke's credit. In fact, it feels like he's writing out his own sick fetish and having Katy sing it. ugh

**MrSwearword** (1): irredeemable trash

**Leixander** (8): The guitar riff here sounds so familiar yet I feel like I never heard this song before.

**skargardin** (7): Well, here it is, the song that has been covered uncountable times, barely missing out on the top twenty but that’s the way the cookie crumbles. Adequate placement if you ask me.

---

## the dad rock stans jumped out 

**sbb618** (11): Yes, it's not the best summer song on this list. But it is absolutely the best song, period. It only takes five notes, and then that iconic guitar riff just screams out at you, with that incredible power behind it, and you're gone. There hadn't been a song before 1965 like this, and there hasn't really been one quite like it since. Before this, bands were more inclined to roll. After this song, they rocked.

**1998tweety** (10): Bop, Britney did it better though

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic on all levels

**CarlieScion** (10): i stan harry styles. i love this.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok r/music made a few points

**LeninaCrowne94** (10): Most iconic riff in history. In the running for the perfect rock song.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The Otis Redding original is also pretty good, but the Stones do this so well. The horns are so great and it's a simple but fun bop

**vapourlomo** (10): It's insane how effortlessly cool this song still sounds

**vhqv1997** (10): My inner dad rock stan is waking up and jamming to this groovy bop right here

**Chevsapher** (9.4): This track finally clicked for me! I suppose I just never heard it outside the grocery store. The lyrics are surpringly deep in certain spots, and the structure is solid.

**radiofan15** (9.3): Keith Richard wrote this bop almost literally on his sleep... ugh, his drug filled ancient mind did that!

**J\_Toe** (9): The first song I recognise! Though to be fair, I did recognise the names for Stevie Wonder and the Supremes.

**rosesmp3** (9): nice of this obscure band to cover britney's song!

**rslashpoopheads** (9): there's the hook!

**SRTviper** (9): Hey, it’s that song people cover.

**SteelStepladder** (9): Probably the first song that's officially transferred out of the oldies section of the rate

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Boomers. Boomers. The lot of you are fucking boomers. But, no, seriously, I wanted to give this a low score because of how many regrets I have over that classic rock phase that I had back when I was, like, 13 years old, but that rift just gets me every time. I mean, at least half of it is lifted from ‘Nowhere to Run’ by Martha and the Vandellas, but as much as I hate to admit it, Keith Richards is still a legend.

**junobeekeeper** (8.5): This guitar riff is just so recognizable and iconic. It's a classic.

**minibjork** (8.5): can you imagine being some disillusioned youth in the sixties hearing this for the first time?? no wonder kids went insane

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the britney version was rated a 6.121, just for comparison

**twat\_brained** (8.4): i mean i like the Britney version if nobody else does but yeah nothing can top the original, this is the Stones' best for a reason. Is it this or Jumpin Jack Flash? Either way it smashes

**notdallin** (8.2): stuff my wife says as i’m doing this (SMWS) - “remember when britney spears did this song?? YAAA! tbh this guy’s version is better.”

**jaztinax** (8): this song is one of my all-time favorites, and i'm not sure why. it's so repetitive and not really in a great way? if i was born in this era, i would've been all over the rolling stones though. now they're just creepy and old and i can't understand how they're not dead. and the cover confuses me because i keep thinking it's the beatles.

**vayyiqra** (8): See, this is really a deep song about the artificial desires created by consumer capitalism, or also being horny, which are manifestations of the same libidinal desire according to the postmodern theories of Foucault and Deleuze. In this essay, I will

**AvatarKanol** (7): A classic. But honestly not that good, it's just ok.

**MrSwearword** (7): cute, but this bores me a bit

**nick1372** (7): this is like 90% chorus, as all classics should be

**slimboyfriend** (7): Lemme preface by saying I LOVE dinosaur rock, and yeah this song is a classic, but I’ve heard this song many many many times and it doesn’t 100% hold up for me. I don’t know of any guitar riff that can stand up to hundreds and hundreds of listens.

## The Britney comments

**peppersmith67** (6.8): At least its not the stereo version I guess?

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Boring and repetitive. I know it’s a classic but it’s just kind of basic.

**letsallpoo** (6): i love this britney cover

**magikarpals** (6): tooooo loooong. note: i kept coming back to this and it dropped way down from a ten

**waluigiest** (6): uninspiring but fine

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.5): a nice britney cover

**CreepyMannequin** (1): Britney did it better

**Leixander** (10): And the music industry was never the same.

**skargardin** (3): Memes can only carry you so far, part two. Sir-Mix-A-Lot narrowly misses out on the top 20. I go back and forth between thinking that this is the greatest song ever recorded and it being an absolute atrocity. The day I rated this I was feeling extra vile.

---

## They cannot lie 

**1998tweety** (10): Anaconda a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Feminism.

**J\_Toe** (10): as in the Anaconda sample? (Yes, I know, every r/pophead and their mother are going to make the same joke. Sue me).

**jaztinax** (10): this almost became my 11. SHAKE THAT HEALTHY BUTT.

**letsallpoo** (10): a feminist anthem

**MrSwearword** (10): One of the best rap songs in the herstory of recorded music. Nicki Minaj will burn in hell for trying to tarnish this glorious song.

**radiofan15** (10): Sir Mix-a-Lot walked so Nicki could run!

**sbb618** (10): Finally, an interesting song! The lyrics are cheesy as all hell and I love it.

**SteelStepladder** (10): The world is genuinely a better place for having this song in it

**vapourlomo** (10): Endlessly quotable. The GOAT Pacific Northwest hip-hop anthem.

**yourhostandpatron** (10): I don’t want to repeat the comment I made for the One Hit Wonder rate all over again, so I’m going to sign off on the fact that this slaps hard. Like, no, seriously, this is an amazing song. You can both write endless discourses on whether Sir Mix A Lot is being problematic here by sexualizing women or whether he’s just telling black women to be confident with their bodies, but you also can pop off to this like there’s no tomorrow. When will Taylor or Ariana do this? Isn’t this what all pop music should try to do?

**Chevsapher** (9.5): This track has not aged well lyrically, but everything about it is so memorable. What a ride. Bonus points for the scratch-tastic production.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): where were you went Sir Mix A Lot invented Nicki Minaj? I wasn’t even born yet.

**nick1372** (9): Not as disrespectful to women as I thought it would be. It's the ultimate butt song, and honestly no butt song should ever have been made (by a man) after this.

**waluigiest** (9): I will not be taking comments on this score

**williamdowley123** (9): sir mixalot started the third wave of feminism

**twat\_brained** (8.6): would be a 10 without the incessant record scratches. Thankfully Anaconda downplays that sort of thing which is why I prefer it. In fact, I'm surprised dadrap like this got big to begin with, because this had to have been controversial. That said, I appreciate how the song is sexual without being vulgar unlike the 2010s rap scene

**hefellapart** (8.5): a classic :kisskiss:

**peppersmith67** (8.5): This song is so braindead it's actually a major achievement in pop history. I love it? I think?

**AvatarKanol** (8): OH MY GOD BECKY! LOOK AT HER BUTT!

**CarlieScion** (8): i love anaconda

**SRTviper** (8): The jump from Everything I Do to this is a shocker. It may be dumb and a little offensive, but the amount of 90’s cheese on display here is impressive.

**vayyiqra** (8): Few pieces of art capture the cultural Zeitgeist of this soon-to-end decade as well as this song from nearly three decades prior. Veneration of thicc bihs has been a constant through human history - this impulse has an evolutionary basis and hearkens back to the paintings of Rubens and even the fertility goddess of Willendorf from the Paleolithic Age. However, aesthetic preferences in Western culture changed to prefer tall, slim women as newfound stability in food security led to the signalling value of body fat storage being lost. (Biologically speaking, an accumulation of fat around the thighs and buttocks, known as the gynoid fat distribution, is a sign of many desirable genetic traits such as high circulating estrogen and is a predictor of intelligence and health.) Fortunately because this toxic valorization of thinness was harmful to young girls, this trend began to reverse If only we knew then what we know now about body positivity. Truly, even white boys do have to shout.

**ryjomom** (6.9): salut to my thicc sisters

## Well just as I thought… trash 

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.8): Yeah it's stupid, but I don't think a man who calls himself "Sir Mix a Lot" was trying to win a Nobel Prize.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): how many times do I gotta rate this

**notdallin** (6): what score do you give a song that walks the thinnest part of the line between iconic and complete trash??

**junobeekeeper** (4): Stand by my score from the OHW rate, but I will say: I have never seen more excited white women than the ones in the video where Sir Mix A Lot performs this with the Seattle (?) Orchestra.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): I know it's a meme but that doesn't make it good.

**LuckyKidA** (3): Not this again

**minibjork** (2): don't remember this sounding so trashy wow

**jlim201** (0): The lyrics make me uncomfortable, dislike the genre, and I am very much against listening to it more to form more of why I can't stand it.

---

#same

**1998tweety** (10): Wow what a slay, I remember the Glee version in particular, bopped hard.

**agentofscranton** (10): Finn Hudson outsold - rip sweet prince

**CarlieScion** (10): JESSIE IS A FRIEND!!!!!! ICONIC

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Sure it might be a little creepy but it’s iconic song. Shoutout to Finn’s cover on glee too.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Mary Lambert's cover is also iconic, check it out if you want to.

**radiofan15** (10): Cory Monteith outsold his ass but this is great too!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): now this is a summer bop

**twat\_brained** (10): one of the first and most legendary songs to masquerade envy and jealousy behind a shiny, glimmery synth beat. God fucking speed, Richard.

**vhqv1997** (10): Cut to me 6 years ago, thinking myself straight, rocking out to this. Cut back to me now, a big gay, still rocking out to this, because I have taste, then and now

**sbb618** (9.5): This song is a perfect example of how to build into a chorus. A+ all around.

**Chevsapher** (9.1): I like this song, but it plays everywhere. Gas stations. Walmart. The mall. The radio. Downtown. Actually, I'm beginning to feel like this song is stalking me.

**jaztinax** (9): okay i will admit i only know this song because of glee and cory monteith does a HELL OF A JOB singing this song so this 9 is for you cory. also this song has one of the best bridges I’ve ever heard.

**SteelStepladder** (9): Is it possible to be more iconic?

**vapourlomo** (9): Definitely played this at church youth group once, forgetting that it's surprisingly sexual for a parent-friendly pop song. Still a classic tho

**notdallin** (8.4): bob saget’s official theme song in full house ^i can’t be the only one who shipped danny tanner and becky, can i?

**vayyiqra** (8): Galaxy brain: I wish that Stacy's mom had Jessie's girl

**SRTviper** (7.6): I can’t help but sing along to this song. But I also feel bad for Jessie and his girlfriend. Dude made a bunch of money off being a bit of a creep to his friends.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Full disclosure: I’m incredibly used to Jesse being the masculine version of Jessie instead of the latter being a gender neutral name, so I thought this was a song about lesbians for awhile. Then I realized it wasn’t. Then I cried. Somebody please record a lesbian version for me. Either way, though, this is entertaining, but it’s just...okay? It has the roaring 80s hook that makes it so appealing, but it also makes use of that hook for nothing but the purpose of being a hit at karaoke night, which is probably why it hasn’t retained its impact in the sphere of public memory. Also, apparently the guy who sings this is a Republican. Somebody please make a lesbian version.

**junobeekeeper** (7.3): Fun fact: Pat Benatar's husband plays the guitar solo on this (I think)

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.3): What it lacks as a song in general it gains by being a perfect SUMMER song.

**J\_Toe** (7): only just learned who Rick Springfield is (knew the song though), and that he has no relation to Bruce

## 2white4me

**waluigiest** (5): fuck jessie st. james i hate glee

**nick1372** (4): I'd like this song a lot more if it didn't play three times per hour on the radio station my mom likes

**bespectacIed** (3): The WHITEST song in all of history

**Leixander** (6): Never really understood how this dominated everything when it was released and I guess I never will.

**skargardin** (3): I have a seeping hatred for this song and the Black Eyed Peas in general, I couldn’t explain to you WHERE it’s coming from but I just remember LOATHING this song when I was younger. I feel like such a shit for rating songs that most of yall like this low but I just am not a fan of this at ALL, I just get annoyed by it, simple as that. 

---

## Hooked on a feeling 

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): what a perfect party song. It's not really about anything other than having a good time, and really what more could you want from a song of the summer. Also this song was everywhere when it came out. I don't think I've seen a summer song with as much dominace as this one.

**ExtraEater** (11): The greatest song of all time

**1998tweety** (10): So so iconic. Used to be the song with the record for most weeks at #1 in Canada....the amount of taste we lost.

**bespectacIed** (10): Bitches will lament that streaming ruined the music industry but wouldn't put some respect on the highest selling digital single of all time (aside from being a total banger)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking iconic legends

**MrSwearword** (10): overplay be damned, this slays

**nick1372** (10): every time I hear this song I'm brought back to middle school gym period

**rslashpoopheads** (10): m a z e l t o v

**sbb618** (10): Man I miss the Black Eyed Peas

**SteelStepladder** (10): I find it hard to believe that there isn't a single person on this planet that doesn't like this song at least a little

**vapourlomo** (10): The ultimate junior high school dance anthem

**vhqv1997** (10): I gotta feeling that this song is gonna get robbed

**waluigiest** (10): nothing this good has been composed since.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): my favourite day of the week is the second saturday

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This was my favorite song for the longest time when I was younger! Anyone who hates on this song hates fun (or just didn’t like how overplayed it was understandably).

**notdallin** (9.2): what makes this song so classic in an industry oversaturated with party anthems? Especially in 2009, when we reached peak vocoder levels where casual listeners and r/music curmudgeons spat “autotune” as a scorching insult of inauthenticity. In what alternate timeline of 2009 was the Black Eyed Peas’ dip into electronic dance pop successful for an *entire* season? I guess one with taste tbh

**AvatarKanol** (9): The Black Eyed Peas have long fallen into irrelevancy. What they left behind is an iconic and nostalgic party anthem. Listening to this song made me think about how popular music changed in the span of a decade but also reminded me how great of a song it really is.

**ryjomom** (9): aged like fine wine, dont @ me

**slimboyfriend** (9): I love this song both unironically and also because I think it’s hilarious (“drank!” “Mazel tov! [l’chaim!]” “burn the roof! [oooOHHHHhh!!]”)

**williamdowley123** (9): people who hate this song hate fun

**radiofan15** (8.8): TENGO UN SENTIMIENTO QUE ESTA NOCHE SERA GRANDIOSA!

**Chevsapher** (8.7): Remember party songs? I really miss those pulsing synths. The lyrics here are overtly generic, but the chorus is an earworm.

**junobeekeeper** (8.6): My father LOVES this song and it has not left his consciousness since it came out. And it's literally a banger so maybe he was right about that.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Feels kind of derivative at this point, but it's still kinda a banger

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (8): It hasn't aged too well but the nostalgia helps

**vayyiqra** (8): The Black Eyed Peas were always gloriously stupid, and it didn't always end well (remember the original title of "Let's Get It Started"? Mess.) However, this is one time when they got it right.

**twat\_brained** (7.2): this definitely isn't going into obscurity anytime soon but I feel like it's worn down with age. Especially the La Chaim and Mazel Tov lyrics, which I think was just a cheap way to get this played at bar mitzvahs. Good thumping tune but the Peas have done better

**CarlieScion** (7): ooooh ooooh

## mediocrity

**LeninaCrowne94** (5.3): Mediocre but hey, nostalgia!

**peppersmith67** (5): Should only exist at weddings and even then if they played this it'd be a pretty mid wedding.

**yourhostandpatron** (3): I’ve learned that there is a large contingent of people who actually do enjoy this song instead of just ironically liking it, and I’m embarrassed, because I don’t know what to tell them all; much as I try to, I simply cannot help but get extremely annoyed at I Gotta Feeling. Maybe this is because it’s been played pretty much non-stop over at my side of Manila, or maybe it’s because I saw apple de ap’s face on an orphanage that I volunteered in once for some reason. I just simply cannot cling to the promise of good hooks here and get past all that’s trash; this is incredibly dumb, and not in a way that’s outwardly pleasant.

**SRTviper** (1.5): This song has the surface level appeal of a fun pop song but the more times I’ve heard it the more boring and devoid of energy it feels.

**skargardin** (9): An actual anthem that I’m so happy made it into the top 20! Can Usher and Nelly make a collective comeback on the radio like yesteday cuz i miss them like crazy. 

---

## temperature rising

**letsallpoo** (11): a gay anthem

**1998tweety** (10): What an iconic bop.

**AvatarKanol** (10): CLASSIC HOT IN HERE

**ExtraEater** (10): Insert the tweet about Fire Burning, Evacuate the Dancefloor, and Girl on Fire herre

**magikarpals** (10): who was singing this on the playground? everyone

**MrSwearword** (10): THIS SONG IS FUCKING FIRE. Neptunes production that bangs hard to this day? YES GOD.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): my personal anthem

**TragicKingdom1** (10): nelly is my favorite rapper of the 00s and the neptunes can do no wrong

**vapourlomo** (10): When is the band-aid-as-fashion-statement coming back?

**waluigiest** (10): this should play during the sexiest boss battle in zelda

**Chevsapher** (9.2): The lyrics are ridiculous, but melodically and rhythmically, this track is genius.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Nelly really did that!

**J\_Toe** (9): okay, from now on these are all songs I remember in my life time

**slimboyfriend** (9): This song is legendary. However, Nelly as a person is disgusting.

**sbb618** (8.5): The lyrics to this are...weirder than I remembered.

**notdallin** (8.3): thanks to this little number, [this will always be a thing](https://imgur.com/PGxxHGE)

**CarlieScion** (8): checkin your reflection and callin your best friend like girl I think my butt gettin big!!!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its ok but it feels off idk why

**nick1372** (8): someone get taylor to teach this man how to spell

**SRTviper** (8): Help I enjoy really dumb trash more than I’m supposed to.

**jaztinax** (7.5): could’ve been an 8 but the tacky female vocals knock it down half a point

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): To be honest, I think it’ll be hard to write another long paragraph about this one. I could if I had more of a background in hip hop, but the problem here isn’t that Nelly’s made a song difficult to understand; in contrast, Hot in Herre is your typical, ever so slightly gross early 00s party rap song that shot to the top of the charts, acting both as a guilty reminder and as a nagging remembrance that not everything about your childhood was as perfect as it seemed to be. The song itself is alright, though. It’s just not special.

**twat\_brained** (7.1): the beat is groovy as hell but the LYRICS Y'ALL "i think my butt gettin' big!". maybe all a hit song needs is a tight ass hook built around a tight ass sample with some good filler words. It seemed to work for Nelly

**SteelStepladder** (7): a bop and a half

**vhqv1997** (7): Does this song have any verses, I feel like all of it have the same lines over and over

## Stone cold

**ryjomom** (6.9): eh bb u mak mii hornee

**radiofan15** (6.8): Better than expected but still very disposable and annoying... Pharrel sweetie I know you can do better than this!

**vayyiqra** (6): I have a problem with this song which is that I love the instrumental and think the lyrics are complete shit, so it's hard to rate it.

**peppersmith67** (5): I really hope I'm not the only one who gets mildly uncomfortable listening to this song

**junobeekeeper** (4.2): This song is 'verry' ok

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (3): No

**skargardin** (10): I was so nervous that yall would do this ungodly bop dirty. This rate might be full of straight anthems but this one that absolutely deserved to do well and I’m glad it did cuz it’s a SLAPPER. 

**Leixander** (6): This is a classic that stood the test of time for sure, but I never got around to liking it much.

---

## the straights 

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): heterosexuals made points

**letsallpoo** (10): BOP

**sbb618** (10): This song, on the other hand, just makes you feel cool. And you can't fake that.

**vapourlomo** (10): If a song is featured in a Rocky movie, it's automatically a 10. I didn't write the rule, I just enforce it.

**vayyiqra** (10): I grew up watching the Rocky series and this is a banger. An extremely cheesy banger, but a banger nonetheless.

**vhqv1997** (10): Katy Perry thought she could recreate this when she made Roar.

**Chevsapher** (9.7): This song has become a parody of itself, but under all that baggage is one of the best songs of the eighties.

**AvatarKanol** (9.5): This is the second ultimate workout song. Behind Work Bitch by ms. Godney Spears

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This is the og workout song

**bespectacIed** (9): Legendaric but as a Filipino who had to watch Manny Pacquiao walk into a boxing match to this song for the 983292nd time, imagine how tired I am

**CarlieScion** (9): would be a 10 but i have ptsd about gym classes and this song

**rslashpoopheads** (9): a meme, to be sure, but a good one

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Still goes hard on the gym playlist

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): This is a great song

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.6): This song somehow makes me nostalgic despite being released 18 years before I was born. The power

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): For all of how famous this song is, I can’t gauge whether people love it or despise it, so I’m curious to see where this ends up in our rate. As for myself, I think it’s catchy; considering its flow, I am not at all shocked that this was intended for the soundtrack of a boxing movie. Also, for y’all witchheads over here, I tried using this song to charge a motivational sigil once, and it failed! Songs remind you too much about the intent of a sigil! Do not use playlists to charge your sigils! Use them for divination instead!

**MrSwearword** (8): it has replay value but is weak against the serious contenders in the field.

**SteelStepladder** (8): Amazing but I'd never listen to it on my own

**notdallin** (7.7): not sure if it’s a good thing or not that this song is completely inseparable from training montages

**agentofscranton** (7.5): Sandra Diaz-Twine outsold, outwitted, outplayed, and outlasted

**SRTviper** (7.1): Eye of the Tiger is probably the prime example of an artist coming up with a killer riff and having no Idea how to make it into a compelling song. But it is a cheesy fighting movie anthem, so it gets a pass.

## and you’re gonna hear me.. ROAR 

**junobeekeeper** (6.9): Fuck the Rocky movies, they are boring.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): honestly could be much more of a bop

**twat\_brained** (6.2): this song is such a cliché sports tune it's lost some of its charm on me. at least it inspired this classic

**nick1372** (6): I've just heard this too many times

**peppersmith67** (6): if this was an instrumental it might be a perfect rating this dude's voice is a drag.

**ryjomom** (6): Katy Perry - Roar

**waluigiest** (2): I hate this song but it’s strictly personal. My high school marching band played it at parades every year and it sucks and I will never be able to like it

**radiofan15** (1): We love a song that in any other circumstance it would be my ZERO... being overplayed and meme-ed to death is surprisingly the lesser of its problems.

**Leixander** (10): They became a legend for a reason!

**skargardin** (9): oof, as the day two closer we have an absolute CLASSIC. The instrumentals lowkey carry this song do NOT come for me, they are just insanely good in their simplicity but of course the queens slayed this song as well. 

---

## yas queens 

**1998tweety** (10): This song is that bitch, best one so far.

**ExtraEater** (10): queens

**junobeekeeper** (10): This song ripped off my beehive hairdo and handed it to me.

**MrSwearword** (10): LEGENDTINTA girl group signature song

**ryjomom** (10): Brings me back to when I played a minecraft server all summer during middle school. I was a true gaymer

**slimboyfriend** (10): Diana Ross and company really snapped with this one

**Chevsapher** (9.2): The original iconic girl group! Those melodies are addictive.

**peppersmith67** (9): hard not to sway back n forth to this jam

**waluigiest** (9): The Supremes have a beautiful classic sound that just hits me

**radiofan15** (8.7): Deena Jones did what she had to do here... and the other members of The Dreamettes kinda snapped too.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): y'all remember when Diana Ross was presented a VMA lifetime achievement award next to Lil Kim when Kim's whole ass boob was out? i miss the 90s

**notdallin** (8.5): TIL this song is different from Baby Love

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): this is the old-timey sound that I love

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Strangely, this is the only hit from a girl group in this rate, which is a travesty, because that means that Bananarama’s ‘Cruel Summer’ was never actually the Song of the Summer. How can we even be sure that reality exists? Despite such atrocities existing in the world, though, Where Did Our Love Go, is a nice, gentle spark; it appeals to the modern pop listener the most out of all the old songs in this rate, thanks to Diana Ross being an absolute queen, and the harmonies here just remind me that I have to listen to the Supremes’ acclaimed album of the same name.

## that was a classic 

**AvatarKanol** (8): Very good. The production is amazing. Really elevates the song.

**bespectacIed** (8): What a classy way to sing "my coochie hurts so good"

**CarlieScion** (8): stan the supremes

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Diana Ross an icon

**SteelStepladder** (8): a bop before its time

**vapourlomo** (8): Not peak Supremes but still a classic

**sbb618** (7.5): I'm so used to hearing the Soft Cell cover of this after the extended version of "Tainted Love" (which everyone should listen to, by the way, it's super good). It's weird to hear it slowed down like this.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): Classic Supremes, but not their most memorable

**nick1372** (7): why are all these 60s songs so short?

**vayyiqra** (7): Classic, but I like the Soft Cell version more (the "Tainted Love" guys from the 80s)

**jaztinax** (6): doesn't every supremes song sound like this? still a cute motown classic though.

**Overall Average**: 6.288 **// Average Controversy:** 2.150

**Skargardin**: There were some gems in here like nel blu.. and where did our love go! Pleasantly surprised.

**Leixander**: For some reason, I was surprised to see most of the songs here being shorter than 3 minutes! Also didn't expect to love them so much. Maybe the oldies are goldies after all.

---
**yourhostandpatron** (8.125): Strangely, these are the decades in this rate that I think have the most consistently good lineups (the 80s are solid, too). I’m not sure how Popheads are going to react to rating classic pop and rock and roll, but almost all of the songs in this batch capture the feeling of plastic yet fascinating nostalgia that always happens when you tune in at the right time to those radio stations that play really old music for all the grandparents watching; do you actually know what it was like to live back in these days? No, and things were probably shittier than the music implies, but, to hell with it. This is good stuff.

**radiofan15** (7.200): Despite some weird stuff that had no right topping the charts (Wild Things is an abomination, and Fingerprints only gets some extra decimal points for having a 12-year old Stevie Wonder in it) this was a generally solid era of pop music, although I'm surprised by the lack of Beatles for some reason.
