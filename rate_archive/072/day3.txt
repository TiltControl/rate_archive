**skargardin** (11): This is without a doubt one of my favorite Madonna songs ever, it’s a perfect pop song and you damn well know that I’m giving it my eleven.

---

## queen of controversy

**Chevsapher** (11): A story song with strings and a delicious hook? Say what you want about Madame X,

**1998tweety** (10): I listen to this song whenever I have a fight with my dad.

**JunkyGS** (10): One of my all time favorite Madonna singles. It is so under rated and idk why!

**MrSwearword** (10): THE 24TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER. A classic jam.

**radiofan15** (10): The song that turned Madonna from a pop star to a top artist from the decade... not my favorite Madonna song but I gotta appreciate the importance and how much of a strong message it has.

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Okay, I know that shock value is dead in this postmodern age, but, holy shit, can you just imagine the controversy that would’ve exploded if it was still alive and if Madonna released this in the midst of all these debates about reproductive healthcare today? Maybe this is why we should be glad that traditional media doesn’t have as much power as it did in 1986. But yes, Papa Don’t Preach is one of the first moments in Madonna’s career where she causes deafening uproars thanks to shocking song content, and it’s absolutely glorious to behold more than thirty years old. This is a song that makes people mad, of course, but it’s a bold sign of a growing artistic image; for the first time, we get a glimpse of the real Madonna. And you may hate her now, but you’d have loved her back then.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): she really made a bop about teen pregnancy.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): not one of her best but its good

**J\_Toe** (9): Yeah Madonna! Even if I don't actually feel all that attached to this Madonna song, specifically.

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.8): iconic

**junobeekeeper** (8.7): It's catchy.

**slimboyfriend** (8): Madonna serving controversy in the summer of ‘86

**SteelStepladder** (8): I feel like I'm the only one who thinks this is a mid tier Madonna song

**twat\_brained** (8): A Madonna song, this most certainly is. I'd better check out True Blue to see if it's any better

**vayyiqra** (8): A pro-choice legend, Madonna singlehandedly decided Roe v. Wade. Alabama needs her.

**waluigiest** (8): I’m choosing to believe that “keeping my baby” means staying with her whack bf and not a pro-life anthem

**peppersmith67** (7.8): I feel like every true smash hit from my favorite artists on here are gone and instead the one hit song i don't love by them happened to be a summer hit

**agentofscranton** (7.5): my favourite joke is opening a Madonna-themed Indian restaurant and call it poppadom preach

**sbb618** (7.5): I think this song is a bit too over-produced? The central music and lyrics are really good, but it kinda gets drowned out. The Glee cover was great, because it went against this: It was just voice and acoustic guitar.

**CarlieScion** (7): stan glee

**vapourlomo** (7): It's good, but Madonna's definitely had better tunes

## lana del rey fans

**notdallin** (5.9): [me getting ready to watch the collective meltdown when a popheads main pop girl is realized to be singing about an apparently pro-life song](https://imgur.com/MgWR1FI)

**nick1372** (5): Am I the only one who finds Madonna's music kinda boring considering she's this huge charicature of a person? I just don't know what I'm missing

**rslashpoopheads** (5): repetitive crop

**LuckyKidA** (4): of all Madonna songs this is the one that made it?

**Leixander** (10): Mariah's introduction to the world, and what an introduction it was.

**skargardin** (10): Vocals have me shook, she’s got some damn pipes and this song is just so incredibly beautiful.

---

## and it was all that you'd given to me

**1998tweety** (10): therokinrolla said this was bad but his brain must have rotted cause I love this.

**bespectacIed** (10): https://twitter.com/iamk_nny/status/1141767352985563136?s=19

**junobeekeeper** (10): I think I'm in love with Mariah Carey now

**radiofan15** (10): Skinny Legend, Mother of Lambs, Person with the most number one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 (which is difficult to get, not everyone has that to their credit) did THAT... her bottle cap challenge video is SHOOK.

**SteelStepladder** (10): Nineties Mariah is the best Mariah don't @ me

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (10): I love a fellow skinny legend

**twat\_brained** (10): great song, great vocals, the perfect introduction to the legend that is Mariah Carey. actually hang on a minute this could win. this means that when we rate "More Than You Know" from Axwell /\ Ingrosso and it wins, Alice Chater will have covered 3 rate winners. An icon in the making ugh her mind

**waluigiest** (10): this is beautiful I can’t believe it launched her career omg….. legendary

**peppersmith67** (9.5): I've only recently re-discovered my love for Mariah Carey from childhood and I don't know how I survived those dark ages without her music tbh.

**nick1372** (9): ok I get why this sub stans mariah now... girl can sing

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Mariah has the rare prestige of having a debut single that’s an actual classic instead of just a warmer up; Tupac used to put this on in the background whenever he was feeling sad, and he made the right decision. As a song, Vision of Love is, after all, pretty much the perfect way to introduce the merits of Mariah’s voice to the general public. Sure, she belts in here. The song never fails to show you that her voice is that amazing. But this is also a song that requires a hefty amount of emotion and heart, and Mimi certainly delivers those traits; if anything, it’s a brilliant sign of things to come.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): It’s good but I feel like it’s a bit anti climatic

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): aggressively whistle tones

**Chevsapher** (8): The chorus is nothing to write home about, but the vocals are jaw-dropping. My favorite part, oddly, is the brief intro.

**ryjomom** (8): not to read this song but it sounds like more of a winter song

**sbb618** (7.5): Not really a fan of slow-dance R&B songs generally, but I like this one.

**J\_Toe** (7): woo! Mariah! Even though her only pre-Honey songs I normally listen to are Fantasy and Emotion

**SRTviper** (7): She is such a talented vocalist that even without any compelling instrumentation, production, or writing I can still enjoy this song.

## lambs are coming for you

**notdallin** (7.2): do all 90s Mariah songs sound like they could be Christmas songs???

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the bridge served vocals but the rest of the song was kinda boring, don't @ me

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Honest opinion, Mariah needed some time to grow into her songs

**vayyiqra** (6): The intro was cool but the rest was meh

**CarlieScion** (5): i will not give this any lower for fear of mariah stans doxxing me

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): don't hate me but forgettable

## prayed through the nights, so faithfully, knowing that one day, you would find taste eventually

**MrSwearword** (1): overrated, maudlin garbage

**skargardin** (10): You better SANG. This is an absolute fantastic ballad that’s just pure emotion and I’m glad that yall did it justice. A classic!

## we keep dancing in this world alone

**1998tweety** (10): omg I did NOT know the Alyssa Reid song was a cover of this, both bops!

**jaztinax** (10): wow people must’ve been really depressed this summer but wow what an iconic, amazing song. those extra few bars before the second chorus really throws you off and it’s so cool.

**junobeekeeper** (10): ohmygod aaaahhhh this is just an incredible rock ballad. Absolutely essential, even if it isn't "summery".

**nick1372** (10): this was the first time I've ever heard this song, but it hits so HARD

**rosesmp3** (10): i've decided to ascend

**static\_int\_husp** (10): women led 80s hair rock ballads are niche. And Heart is the epitome of that niche. So good.

**vapourlomo** (10): A perfect karaoke song. HOW CAN I GET YOU ALOOOOONE

**williamdowley123** (10): contrapoints made this iconic

**radiofan15** (9.7): Celine outsold, but this is still one of the best power ballads of the 80s... and that's saying something!

**bespectacIed** (9): Céline kinda ate this song but the original is still a classic

**CarlieScion** (9): why is this not alone by halsey.mp3?

**SteelStepladder** (9): Don't talk to me if you don't sing this from the top of your lungs when it comes on

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The mix is so absurdly large, but somehow, it works.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): I'm really surprised there aren't more hair metal ballads like this one

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): stream Alone by SISTAR

**ImADudeDuh** (8): lesbian icons

**slimboyfriend** (8): These sisters SNAPPED the summer of 1987.

**vayyiqra** (8): :kimbryell:

**waluigiest** (8): this walked so lizzo’s “I don’t even wanna hoe no more” in Cuz I Love You could run

**yourhostandpatron** (8): This seems to be the big, dark horse of the 80s in this rate, and it’s something I gladly appreciate, but for some reason, despite me acknowledging that this is a good song, I just can’t love it. Maybe it’s Heart’s voices, which are just too overlain with the typically wonderful synths of this decade and not classically gothic enough for me to appreciate, or maybe the production makes this turn in too much of a piano ballad. Either way, this is nice, but ‘HOW DO I GET YOU ALONE’ is not quite as chilling in Alone as it should be.

**peppersmith67** (7.9): I had drum lessons as a kid and this was the first song I learned to play the whole way through. I hated it then but now it gives me a nice fuzzy warm feeling drum lessons were fun.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.5): Heart is clearly past their peak, but still classic eighties pop.

**J\_Toe** (7): I have a feeling this song is currently playing in a burger add or insurance add or something in Australia. Not sure though.

## let them talk

**notdallin** (5): it’s like if ABBA’s “SOS” and toto’s “Africa” had a baby. With big hair.

**LuckyKidA** (3.5): these songs are like a collection of the most cringey and dated songs you could think of

**MrSwearword** (1): a sappy power ballad and time to remember, Heart's best song is "Barracuda" enough said

**skargardin** (10): While Hot Stuff is Donna Summer’s most well-known song, Bad Girls should not be forgotten and underestimated. I absolutely love it. The song is a charismatic, pure fun-filled joyride. TOOT TOOT BEEP BEEP

---

## live fast, die young, bad girls do it well

**ImADudeDuh** (11): the best homophobic gay icon besides SZA.

**peppersmith67** (11): I genuinely had no idea that the "song of the summer" was actually named after Donna Summer and not the titular season. Hell the season might just be named after Donna she's royalty.

**AvatarKanol** (10): HEY MISTER! GET READY FOR A BOP! THE BUILDUP OF THIS SONG. I cannot stress this enough. This is one amazing song. Even after it ended I had to go back and relisten to it because it is simply out of this world. Donna Summer is a legend. The whistles combined with the beat of the song and her legendary voice create an irresistable combo which culminates in an absolute explosion of euphoria. The song concludes leaving us with the ultimate message. In the end we are all naughty and dirty bad girls.

**bespectacIed** (10): sorry meg i love you but donna summer IS hot girl summer

**junobeekeeper** (10): Beep beep! It's good disco! The sound effects are iconic. You know we stan!

**MrSwearword** (10): Don't let the season four lipsync of Drag Race fool you, this song motherfucking slays. Donna Summer was a QUEEN.

**radiofan15** (10): OH YES A BOP... Miss Donna /, dearly missed, is everything Carly should have been this era!

**slimboyfriend** (10): Donna Summer singlehandedly destigmatized sex work with this BOP. She likens prostitutes to traffic, showing how society polices what street walkers can and can’t do with their bodies.

**waluigiest** (10): Donna Summer’s music is unparalleled she really is the queen

**yourhostandpatron** (10): I’m pretty sure this is the biggest grower on me within the context of this rate. I I’ve gone from not really understanding why Donna Summer was saying ‘beep beep’ in the middle of a song about prostitutes to really enjoying how this song shows that disco truly is funk’s closest cousin. There’s an element of showmanship in the way she basically lectures her audience with her sass and how she says ‘now your mother won’t like it/when she finds out’ and ‘hey mister, you’ve got a dime’. These are subtle theatrics; I hearrily enjoy them. In addition to that, this is argubaly an interesting look into gender politics and sex work as experienced during the hedonistic era of the late 70s. Why not just let Donna teach you how turning tricks actually works> Hopefully she wasn’t actually a homophobe, because this is fantastic. Perhaps her best song next to Hot Stuff and the ever-holy I Feel Love.

**SRTviper** (9): The whistle sound from this song always reminds me of the marching band game from WiiFit.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): Great song

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): i love disco

**jaztinax** (8): real disco right here y’all

**twat\_brained** (8): @billboard - BREAKING: Elvis Presley dead at 44. @madonnasummer - aww that's so sad😢anyways stream Donna Summer for clear skin😚😚(in all seriousness how did Donna and Diana never collab?)

**1998tweety** (7.5): Oh wow what a bop, we stan a homophobic queen

**J\_Toe** (7): we really need to start that Donna Summer rate

## so let's ride

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): The production on this song is so good! The "toot toot, beep beep" lines are full of energy (and iconic).

**Chevsapher** (9.8): TOOT TOOT! Soulful vocals, thoughtful lyrics, and fun production. Overall, a highlight of the disco era.

**williamdowley123** (9): donna summer's beep beep outsold charli's beep beep

**nick1372** (8): toot toot beep beep bitches

**vapourlomo** (8): Every song should have background singers going "TOOT TOOT" and "BEEP BEEP"

**notdallin** (7.5): over/under on how many of these comments are just gonna be “TOOT TOOT, BEEP BEEP”

## so let's ride but in posh british accent

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): i love Traffic by peppa pig

## hot stuff deserved

**CarlieScion** (7): donna summers have so many better songs!!!

**TragicKingdom1** (7): hot stuff >>

**vayyiqra** (7): It's classic but it's not that good. The lyrics get honestly dumb at parts.

**ryjomom** (6): Bad Girls Summer 1K979

**SteelStepladder** (6): MIA did it better

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): I like it I guess but it doesn't need to be 5 minutes long

**Leixander** (11): Best duet of all time? Probably. The undeniable chemistry and the beautiful production/structure of this song is something to admire.

**skargardin** (10): Queens really did THAT and tbh I’m really bummed that this didn’t make it into the top ten. It’s an absolute jam that totally would’ve deserved it. 

---

## it's not hard to see, this song is robbed

**jaztinax** (11): i’m not digging the whole “two girls fighting over a guy” theme and the random, descending “the boy is mine” intro before the song starts, but other than that, this song is perfect. their smooth vocals, the harp arpeggio, the talking intro, the beat, the ad-libs in the choruses… R&B perfection.

**1998tweety** (10): What an iconic tune. We love to woc coming together to make a massive bop.

**bespectacIed** (10): Kinda iffy to listen this in 2019, two beautiful amazing women fighting over a musty man who cheated on them both, but my god this must have been such a serve at that time. This is one of the most CUNTY duets of all time.

**CarlieScion** (10): the boy is MINE

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the tension............ yall need to either fight or fuck

**junobeekeeper** (10): AAHHHH this is legendary!! Absolutely nothing bad about it and I just really adore this.

**MrSwearword** (10): I always love knowing this was inspired by a Jerry Springer episode on cheating but if you let Adina Howard tell the story, this is about her and Brandy fighting over someone from Boyz II Men named Wanya Morris

**radiofan15** (10): The Beyoncé and Rihanna of their times collaborating... we neeed a remake Ms. Knowles-Carter and Ms. Avon Fenty!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): one of glee's good covers

**SRTviper** (10): The vocals are gorgeous, and the production is surprisingly progressive for a pop song in 1998. I love it.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): sexual tension off the charts, whew

**twat\_brained** (10): a hit that sticks like GRITS. oddly enough these two women would happen to have #1 hits both preceding and succeeding "…Baby One More Time" with "Have You Ever" and "Angel of Mine", respectively. But if Genie can't win this deserves to. Extra points to that harp and the playful intro

**vayyiqra** (10): Excuse me Brandy, not to sound like too much of an MRA, but that boy doesn't belong to anyone but himself and can make his own decisions. However, this song is such a damn bop I can overlook your questionable lyrics. I'm just shitposting though. The back-and-forth between the two singers is great. I like how at the end of the music video they even make up and become friends.

**Chevsapher** (9): One of the best duets in pop music. The punchy bass is my favorite part of the production.

**peppersmith67** (9): Darkchild absolutely snapped on the production here what a banger

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): Love the duet. This song is great

**waluigiest** (9): the strings omg

**agentofscranton** (8.5): points for being the song at number one in the US on the day I was born

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I’m not really a fan of the tropes that are at play here with the whole ‘two girls arguing over a man’ thing (and, yes, I know this is technically a remake of Michael Jackson’s The Girl Is Mine, although this is honestly a much better take on it) and I don’t think a song like this would be released in 2019 without causing just a little bit of controversy, but, goddamn, this is a bop. I hate to say this, but Brandy and Monica served here; the two of them really did snap, and they make this song extremely enjoyable.

**slimboyfriend** (8): Objectify! That! Man!

**notdallin** (7.4): it’s embarrassing how long it took me to realize how similar this song sounds to Jlo’s “Love Don’t Cost a Thing.” I can’t unhear it. WHO CAN RELATE? ^whoo!

**SteelStepladder** (7): They should just date each other

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): Yup that's for sure 90s pop

**Leixander** (10): Still sounds fresh after all those years, an enchanting duet.

**skargardin** (7): Well, well well, this is one hell of a surprise. Elton John and Kiki Dee made it into the top ten! Maybe popheads do have taste after all, that being said, it’s a good duet but something about it makes it hard for me to rank it high than average and idk what it is.

---

## 10 10 10s across the board

**1998tweety** (10): An absolute classic, the Chicken Little version slays

**agentofscranton** (10): this guy I had a thing for and I did this song for karaoke together at a Christmas party once, and afterwards he pulled me aside and i straight up thought we were gonna like just make out there and then, but really he wanted to ask for my tips on how to get this other guy to sleep with him, so I ended up spending like 20 minutes just standing there while he vented about how horny he was and how much he wanted to sleep with this other guy hahaha kill me

**AvatarKanol** (10): Iconic, specatacular, legendary.

**ExtraEater** (10): Strangely flawless chemistry

**ImADudeDuh** (10): 10 yes we stan heterofying yourself so you can get a huge hit song, worked for Lil Nas X!

**jaztinax** (10): iconic bop and i’m still looking for a duet partner for this song for karaoke night. best ‘70s summer song.

**junobeekeeper** (10): Elton, my king! Anyway, I have one more thing to say: Chicken Little End Credits!!!

**magikarpals** (10): after singing both parts of this duet i have to go back and listen to 'alone again (naturally)' again

**minibjork** (10): i have bias because i had a chicken little childhood but this has to be one of the best 70s duo songs ever right???

**napsandnetflix** (10): karaoke anthem

**peppersmith67** (10): physically impossible to be in a bad mood listening to this that's just science

**radiofan15** (10): YES MA'AM THIS IS A BOP.

**rosesmp3** (10): a classic literally a classic

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this is cute

**static\_int\_husp** (10): One of Elton's signature songs, and a very good one at that

**SteelStepladder** (10): I couldn't give this anything less if I tried

**vapourlomo** (10): Elton John's hot streak in the early-mid '70s is absolutely insane.

## kiki, do you love me?

**Chevsapher** (9.3): This song is timeless.

**bespectacIed** (9): Bop

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): Love the duet

**waluigiest** (9): this is fun and timeless and dramatic

**williamdowley123** (9): GNOMEO AND JULIET BOP

**ryjomom** (8): Chicken Little stans where you at?

**slimboyfriend** (8): Ugh with a name like Kiki Dee she really deserved a more memorable solo career

**notdallin** (7.9): SMWS - “I liked Ella Enchanted. A lot.”

**sbb618** (7.5): The rest of the song doesn't live up to the beginning.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.3): I like it. That's about all I can say.

**twat\_brained** (7.2): right so when are we rating an Elton album? Also whatever happened to Kiki? Is she loved? is she riding? Says she'll never have to- wait I'm not up to 2018 yet

**J\_Toe** (7): omg the pig and duck sung this song in Chicken Little!

## chicken little did it better

**MrSwearword** (7): peppy, but I'm not wowed by it

**SRTviper** (7): Not my favorite Elton song but this is still better than most of the 70’s line-up.

**vayyiqra** (7): It kind of bops but it's repetitive and I don't like the vocals

**yourhostandpatron** (6): Look, from our #rates channel in the Discord I get the impression that this is well-liked, but this is one of the only songs in this rate that I’ve heard before, and I just...don’t get it. Elton isn’t at his best here at all, and him doing a corny duet with Kiki Dee that uses the word ‘clown’ as he’s trapped in the closet is an incredibly frightening experience. To be honest, I can see why y’all enjoy it, but I’ll pass on it.

## is probably going to buy lover in vinyl anyway

**CarlieScion** (3): i cant stand this duet. it reminds me of those cheesy lovey-dovey glee duets.

# 70s

---

**Overall Average**: 6.929 **// Average Controversy:** 1.985

---

(Leix): First half is very disappointing, but the last four years songs make up for it.

---
**radiofan15** (8.310): For the decade that gave us Disco I was expecting something more boppy and danceable, but at least this was more consistently enjoyable than the previous decade [Score: B+]

**yourhostandpatron** (7.800): The 70s have actually gone from being my least favourite decade of pop music to one of the ones I love the most at times, and this lineup actually doesn’t do that much of an injustice towards it, especially compared to a ton of 70s #1s; sure, there’s a couple of boring shit over here, the kind that made me think the decade was way less diverse than I later discovered it was, but even if this isn’t a perfect collection of songs, it still has some of the soul and disco from the era that I absolutely love. A flawed set, but still decent!

**skargardin** (10): Oh look, a perfect summery pop song. This was one of my favorite songs on the radio when I was a teen. Yall had conflicted feelings about Snoop’s part but honestly, I don’t mind it at all. An absolute summer bop.

**Leixander** (7): Not the best Katy song in this rate but still bops.

---

## greetings loved ones... let's take a journey

**rslashpoopheads** (11): not my favorite song here but it's undoubtedly the best SUMMER song on this list also stream Shake It by SISTAR

**1998tweety** (10): Queen, Snoop Dog is a legend too. Both of them work so well together on this.

**AvatarKanol** (10): With one hit after another Katy continued her reign of the early 2010's. With an iconic video for California Gurls Katy scored another iconic pop track that won't be soon forgotten.

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah if people didn't just vote for their fave song and actually did the rate correctly by choosing the definitive summer anthem, this will win. ( I still didn't give it an 11 tho because I'm a clown and a 🐝). Legendary behavior from katy and snoop.

**hikkaru** (10): one of the weaker teenage dream singles tbh but still a BANGER

**ImADudeDuh** (10): YAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This song made me a HOMOSEXUAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**MrSwearword** (10): even if realistically, it's Katy Perry and that's never a good sign, this does get full marks because it's the last good definition of a summer song

**radiofan15** (10): Invented beaches, the state of California, Snoop Dogg and uncordinated sharks.

**ryjomom** (10): pop perfection + fun ass rap = Amazing Song

**twat\_brained** (10): I LOVE this song and it absolutely defined my summer 2010. That said I'm sad it's tarnished knowing one of the writers is a strongly alleged predator

**vayyiqra** (10): This is peak early-career Katy, a incredibly catchy, enjoyably stupid song with goofy lyrics. Everything about it is aggressively 2010s. It even has the Millennial Whoop (wow I hate that term) and a pointless rap by Snoop Dogg. It also has an amazing campy video where Katy shoots whipped cream out of her bra. Therefore, everything about this song is a 10. QED

**waluigiest** (10): I say a lot of songs turned me gay but learning this one on saxophone in 8th grade is high on the list

**Chevsapher** (9.8): One of the best pop songs of the decade.

**sbb618** (9.5): Gurls*

**jaztinax** (9): wow the first song in a really long time that actually sounds and feels like summer. not a 10 bc snoop’s verse is meh

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): A cute song for the summer

**vapourlomo** (9): Teenage Dream and TGIF were better, but this still goes

**vhqv1997** (9): Arguably her most iconic video to date, but that aside the song is such a bop too. 10-year-old me would secretly bop to this song in shame and he wouldn't forgive me if I don't give this song at least a 9.

**williamdowley123** (9): snoop dogg's bored / confused tone makes this song 1000x better

**peppersmith67** (8.5): Not my favorite on the list, but easily the first song that comes to my mind when I think "song of the summer"

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I might be too terrified of earthquakes to ever move to California, and I have no idea whether Katy actually comes from there or not, but this is clearly in the upper tier of hit singles from Teenage Dream; is Snoop Dogg’s feature good? I honestly have no idea, but I honestly welcome that guy’s voice in any pop song that’s already solid; whatnot with Katy’s fun enunciation here and the sheer bubblegum vibes you get just from listening to her voice. This is a fun hit, and it’s one of the few good 10s songs from this list.

**CarlieScion** (8): a straight up bop but katys voice sounds so forced and strained in places

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I like this song but never as much as some of her other hit singles. It’s just slightly grating to me.

**slimboyfriend** (8): This song sounds like sunshine. Also Snoop Dogg MAKES it.

**junobeekeeper** (7.3): I remember my mom didn't let me watch this music video bc of the whole whip cream thing but that's not massively relevant to this song. Anyway, this was cute.

**notdallin** (7.1): that this song wanted to be the 2010 summer jam is preeeeetty transparent. Those writers just throwin whatever summer iconography they can at the wall and seeing what sticks. “Bikinis? Zucchinis? Martinis? No weenies, just the king and queenie” ok snoop

**SteelStepladder** (7): It's not Teenage dream but it's still good

## the jellybean bear in the video

**SRTviper** (5): So much worse than I Kissed A Girl.

**J\_Toe** (1): I've always felt like Dr Luke's music production is really, idk, cheap sounding? Plastic? Empty? And I've felt this before I knew a) he was behind all the music I hated in my teens and b) how much of a shitty person he was. I feel the same way about Kim Petras' Heart to Break.

**Skargardin** (10): Prince was in the top five for quite some time but unfortunately plummeted later on it the rate and never quite recovered, aka the second time that this song has been done DIRTY.

**Leixander** (10): Should win every rate it is in to be honest, a timeless song.

---

## this is what it sounds like when 10s cry

**LeninaCrowne94** (11): This is why we should deify Prince. The "ooh-oh-oh"s near the end and the synths... Beethoven who?

**slimboyfriend** (11): He gives you SEX he gives you DRAMA he gives you FALSETTO. Nobody else in this rate could make a song this perfect. I'm erotically sweating just listening to it.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Prince can do no wrong. The synth scales at the end are just some of the most satisfying musical sounds ever recorded. I have given this my 11 before and will continue to do so.

**bespectacIed** (10): Should be on anyone's top 10 greatest songs of all time

**Chevsapher** (10): This song is abrasive and experimental in the best way possible. Lyrics, melodies, vocals: check, check, and check.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Prince’s best song imo. It’s just perfection.

**J\_Toe** (10): I really want to see a vine with a flock of doves flying, only for them to make the noise of "doop, drop-doop. Drop drop doop drop".

**junobeekeeper** (10): One of my biggest musical regrets is not appreciating Prince until after his death. As vocalist, songwriter, guitarist, and a producer, Prince truly was a singular talent. This song is just one of many that show that.

**MrSwearword** (10): Prince's best song gets full marks. DEAL

**nick1372** (10): everything about this song is amazing

**radiofan15** (10): Ugh thanks to Prince's state for giving us the chance to listen to this BOP and many other Prince BOPS wherever and however we like... Jay-Z should learn something from him.

**sbb618** (10): Do I really need to explain myself here?

**SteelStepladder** (10): very close to getting my eleven

**TragicKingdom1** (10): wouldn't be mad if this won again

**twat\_brained** (10): Okay, we've let this win a rate and place 2nd in another. I forget the winners rate bc I was too wrapped up in Britney's progress but PLEASE LET ANOTHER SONG WIN THIS TIME

**vapourlomo** (10): This is going to be an obvious/boring pick if it wins, but also it'll kind of deserve it? It's insane how well this production has aged.

**vhqv1997** (10): This single song paves the way for all experimental music and artists from this point forward, pay some respect

## how can you just leave me standing???

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): The only song in this rate to have formerly won another one is fucking fantastic, and I will absolutely not have anybody argue with me about this point. Though he might not be what you think of when your mind travels back to new wave thanks to his wacky experiments with practically every relevant genre in mainstream music, Prince essentially perfected it in 1984 with the masterpiece that is Purple Rain, and When Doves Cry shows all the hallmarks of why that record is considered so good. A bit of passion, a lot of shredding guitars and synths, a flock of hooks willing to seduce you like there’s no tomorrow, and an absolute fuckton of sexuality from Prince - nothing but a sure classic can arise from these elements. This isn’t my favourite Prince song, but it is undoubtedly quintessential.

**1998tweety** (9): A classic

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Prince? more like KING!

**jaztinax** (9): I just love the line “maybe i’m just like my mother, she’s never satisfied” i can’t get over it.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): I love this song

**waluigiest** (9): omg

**vayyiqra** (8): An amazing song, but wtf was with that intro? I don't remember it being like that. The outro also really drags. If any song on this playlist needed a radio edit, it was this one, so I have to take off a point. Side note: the line "maybe I'm just like my father" became really dark after finding out that Prince's father abused and neglected him.

**AvatarKanol** (7): Sorry Prince but this is just ok.

**peppersmith67** (7): Imma go out on a limb and say this song might be about sex

**rslashpoopheads** (7): nice

**SRTviper** (7): The vocals on this song aren’t great but I love the production on this song.

## flopped in a world that's so cold

**CarlieScion** (4): i am so sorry. i do not vibe with this.

**notdallin** (2.7): i’m sorry i just DON’T GET PRINCE. All i want to do right now is listen to “quicksand” by la roux

# 80s

---

**Overall Average**: 7.382 **// Average Controversy:** 2.082

---

**yourhostandpatron** (8.100): Okay, so the 80s are pretty much the best decade this rate has to offer by far. Not all of the songs here are without a doubt great, but this is a pretty iconic string of hits; Eye of the Tiger? Every Breath You Take? Papa Don’t Peach? Shout? Even Prince is there, too. The 80s aren’t a perfect lineup, but they’re the closest this rate comes to having an optimistic summer in regards to the future of music. They miss the mark at times, but they’re not dreary, and you’ll enjoy more songs here than bear through them.

**radiofan15** (7.330): Another decade with low lows and high highs, but somewhat more pronounced than the previous decades. [B-]

**skargardin** (10): Timbaland really did and make some of my favorite music of all time, huh? This bops hard as hell. I’m a huge fan of Timbaland’s mid-late 00’s work. Promiscuous actually was dangerously close to not getting into the top ten at all, but the later ballots did it thankfully justice!

**Leixander** (8): Fergie found writing Fergalicious. I prefer Say It Right.

---

## they tried

**agentofscranton** (11): would a person with taste even consider giving this song a score less than 10? no? didn't think so

**AvatarKanol** (11): Excellent song. The beat on this song is insane. Nelly and Timbaland created a track that screams sexy. Completely deserving of a 10.

**hikkaru** (11): nelly furtado in the music video was my sexual awakening tbh. also the fact that his somehow lost to Snore It Right in the nelly/fergie/shakira rate will forever haunt me, hopefully promiscuous can get her revenge here

**ignitethephoenix** (11): One of my favourite songs of all time. The production has aged super well and it still bops so much! Nelly Furtado and Timbaland were really so powerful at this time.

**MrSwearword** (11): THE BEST SONG IN THIS RATE and Nelly Furtado's best song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): i want her on my team and so should everybody else

**vayyiqra** (11): [Am I throwing you off? NOPE. Didn't think so.] Okay, so I saw some Popheads claiming this song is gay culture. I would like to point out how incredibly offensive and problematic this is, trying to appropriate this essential part of straight Canadian culture. The vast majority of pop songs may be by straight people singing about being in love with other straight people, but this song is literally a duet about two straight people flirting because they want to fuck. It's as straight as a goddamn ruler. Also, Nelly Furtado's slightly awkward dancing in the video was the catalyst for realizing I was heterosexual and having the courage to come out to myself, and it's doubly insulting given that I'm a Canadian, a historically marginalized group. Check your Popheads privilege, sweaty. [Real non-shitpost comment: This is an amazing bop and the synth in the chorus is pure eargasm. It's just so much fun.]

## but, i ain't promiscuous

**1998tweety** (10): Timbaland a king, Icarus Falls deserved better.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): invented duets. Sorry everyone else

**peppersmith67** (10): Say it Right woulda got my 11 but this still SLAPS

**radiofan15** (10): Ugh Nelly and Timbaland were everything back then... they need to make a comeback!

**SteelStepladder** (10): Nelly Furtado needs more love

**twat\_brained** (10): this reminds me when the hell are we having a Timbaland vs Pharrell vs Darkchild vs Jermaine Dupri rate? this wouldn't win but it'd definitely rate super well

**notdallin** (9.7): power duo Furtado and Timbaland perhaps second only to 00’s legends Timberlake and Timberland. ...maybe not *even* then. The call-and-response female/male lyrics are perfectly showcased over one of the most summery beats possible. I am immediately transported to my mid-teens, donning my white iPod nano, walking to Dairy Queen a few blocks down getting a slushies to drink under the 2006 sun.

**junobeekeeper** (9.2): oooh it's a GRINDING tune. The beat is literally sick.

**Chevsapher** (9): That chorus.

**slimboyfriend** (9): I’m having a Nelly Furtado singles renaissance right now, very disappointed that 10 year old me didn't bask in the glory of her golden era

**vapourlomo** (9): "Am I throwing you off?" NOPE

**waluigiest** (9): invented sex

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I listened to Aaliyah’s discography back to back a couple of months ago, and that adventure not only helped me understand the lady’s legacy, but made me realize why Timbaland is basically one of the best pop producers we ever seen. He’s always provided much needed crossovers into RnB with those quality beats and that deep, bassy timbre of his, and Promiscuous is no exception;  though I’ve never heard a Nelly Furtado song that I remembered other than Say It Right here, the way her performance syncs extraordinarily well with her producer’s makes me want to give her another try. This may not make it into a list of 00s classics as often as Crazy In Love or Umbrella, but make no mistake; it’s just as good.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda hot

**rslashpoopheads** (8): my favorite 3 hit wonder

## didn't think so

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): overhyped tbh

**nick1372** (7): insert ariana "it's equality" gif here

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): Never got the hype of this song

**CarlieScion** (4): this annoys me to no end. i cannot stand this kind of talk-sing rapping.

**skargardin** (10): Here’s the true gag of the rate. What was once in my mind a surefire winner utterly FLOPS outside of the top five?! C’mon! This is one of the best pop songs of all time imo! A perfect summer anthem and it was well, not entirely paid dust, but it’s shocking that it didn’t even make the top five..

**Leixander** (8): Pop classic for sure, but Xtina has way better songs.

---

## stream "well well well" by duffy

**twat\_brained** (11): I can't believe you idiots let this flop in All-Stars 2, I'm giving this my 11 because despite having the knowledge that it's gonna get destroyed by you lot, the first time we rated it Xtina was just 3 hundredths shy of a 9.4 rating. And it was still only #3. There's no way this won't go top 10, but I just hope y'all display taste this time around

## wished for a good christina aguilera album...

**1998tweety** (10): XtinAllah served. Her vocal heavy singles are way way better but this still bops hard.

**bespectacIed** (10): best debut song of a blonde pop star who hailed from the Mickey Mouse Club

**hikkaru** (10): my first 10 of the rate... im baby and music was invented only when britney and xtina debuted wbk

**J\_Toe** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgdDsa0jnD4

**MrSwearword** (10): a fabulous debut song

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this is pop music

**SRTviper** (10): Picking an 11 is getting harder with each decade.

**Chevsapher** (9.6): The mix has a lot happening, but somehow, it works. The tight melodies are the real star.

**radiofan15** (9.2): If Xtincta had debuted with ANOTHER of her album singles instead of this songs she could have avoided the Britney comparisons more easily... but still it doesn't take away of how much of a BOP is this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Whew

**vapourlomo** (9): (this is Christina's only truly great song)

**williamdowley123** (9): im a genie in a bottle YOU GOTTA RUB ME THE RIGHT WAY you must be a lesbian

**yourhostandpatron** (9): For your information, I was incensed that this not win the 1999 rate that we hosted back on April Fool’s day.  I’m convinced that this only happened because that troll Britney Spears stan account rigged this to tank at #10. Well, jokes on them; they got banned, and as much as I love Britney and Baby One More Time, Genie in a Bottle is simply the superior song! Is it kind of cross that Christina sang it when she was only my age? Yes, it absolutely is, but the sheer elegance of her performance here (where she actually controls her vocals) makes Genie in a Bottle a fantastic, if slightly morally problematic hit. As Christina indicates: if we want to love this song, perhaps there’s a price to pay.

**peppersmith67** (8.9): When she was six my older sister dressed up on halloween as THE genie in the bottle what an icon.

**notdallin** (8.6): I was such a naïve 9-year-old hearing this song in 1999. After reading those lyrics, I’m definitely all grown up now.

**AvatarKanol** (8): This is good but not that good.

**LeninaCrowne94** (8): Xtina needs a comeback

**slimboyfriend** (8): Now, I’m not sure about this, but I think that if you want to be with her, you’ve gotta, and hear me out on this, rub her the right way

**SteelStepladder** (8): great pop song but nothing too special

**vayyiqra** (8): I went down a weird Internet rabbithole last night [at the time of writing this] of reading articles about the making of this song and the controversy around it. Would you believe that in the late 90s, the offensiveness of a song about a teenage girl not wanting to fuck was such a hotly debated topic? And yet, I can tell you that it was; I was there. Having said that, as an adult now who fucks on a semi-regular basis, the line "rub me the right way" makes me lol.

**vhqv1997** (8): Christina can never do subtle can she?

**waluigiest** (8): “i just wanna go back” - charli xcx

## but it never came.

**CarlieScion** (7): this has been rated. so many times. but its still a song.

**junobeekeeper** (6.3): I want to respect this song but uhhh it has been ruined by someone I know so Sorry Xtina.

**ryjomom** (6): Aladdin teas

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (6): There are way better songs from 1999

**Skargardin** (9): An arguably iconic song even though I have other TLC songs I prefer over this one. 

**Leixander** (8.5): I prefer No Scrubs as "the TLC song" but this is iconic too.

---

## why do we keep when the water runs

**SteelStepladder** (11): TLC deserve it

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10, we stan queens who don't hate gays

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the biggest, high-budget, most iconic music videos of all time, tackling issues like HIV and drugs in an era where they're taboo, on top of being an amazing, inspirational RnB-pop song which apparently isn't about a guy named Jason Waterfalls ughhh this song is just legendary (i've used this word for so many songs in this rate)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Lowkey a very depressing song, yet the chorus became pretty iconic? confusing, but we still stan

**junobeekeeper** (10): One time in newspaper class I was listening to this song and I literally started bawling because I had never paid much attention to the lyrics. It's so beautiful and wow.

**MrSwearword** (10): an absolute fucking classic that has one of the most legendtinta rap sections ever.

**radiofan15** (10): We Miss Lisa ''Left Eye'' Lopes... it should have happened to Lil Kim instead! #BringBackScreamQueens #ButWeNeedTheAudienceToStreamTheOtherGuysSoWeCanGetASequel

**rslashpoopheads** (10): legendary kind of boring

**ryjomom** (10): We’re The Millers periodt

**sbb618** (10): This song is surprisingly dark!

**SRTviper** (10): The pop song of the 90’s. It’s so funky how could you not love it.

**twat\_brained** (10): It's no Say My Name but if there's a defining 90s girl group song… it's Wannabe. This is probably #6 or something

**vhqv1997** (10): https://media.giphy.com/media/d7036IDwqchMs/giphy.gif

**Chevsapher** (9.5): I never realized this song discussed HIV... apparently I need to pay more attention to lyrics!

**peppersmith67** (9.5): not to diminish how good TLC are, but if you take a quick listen and ONLY listen to the instrumental this might be flawlessly produced it's immaculate.

**jaztinax** (9): only reason this doesn’t have a 10 is because i’ve listened to it so much that it’s really boring to me now

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I've never noticed the line about HIV in this song before doing this rate.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): When I was fifteen, and when I was even more of a fool than I am now, I kind of viewed this song as heartwarming in hindsight, because I thought safe sex and drug crisises weren’t as much of a problem as they were back in the 90s anymore. Needless to say, I was horribly wrong; Waterfalls is a bop and a half, despite being somewhat stuck in the temporalistic music scene it was invented for in terms of its production, but it’s sadly still relevant, and I wish it wasn’t. Creep, however, is still better.

## a geography lesson + stream primal heart

**vayyiqra** (8): While it is neither the highest nor the widest waterfall in the world, Victoria Falls is classified as the largest, based on its combined width of 1,708 metres (5,604 ft)[5] and height of 108 metres (354 ft),[6] resulting in the world's largest sheet of falling water. Victoria Falls is roughly twice the height of North America's Niagara Falls and well over twice the width of its Horseshoe Falls. In height and width Victoria Falls is rivalled only by Argentina and Brazil's Iguazu Falls. (Also, did you know Kimbra is a TLC stan and included several references to them in her video for "90s Music"? I doubt anybody cares but me, but just a neat little fact.)

## why do we love if we're so mistaken?

**waluigiest** (8): I hate that I think of that Jason sudeikis movie

**notdallin** (7.7): anytime i feel like aiming high and overachieving, TLC is there to remind me to slack off and live beneath my potential. and i feel better.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I was enjoying it until the weird rap part near the end. Not a fan of that singer’s voice.

**CarlieScion** (7): dont! go! chasing! waterfalls!

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): Why couldn't the whole decade have been like this?

# 90s

---

**Overall Average**: 6.942 **// Average Controversy:** 2.172

---

**radiofan15** (8.020): Despite some REALLY low points (looking at you UB40 and All-4-One) this was a fantastic and variated decade for hit music [Score: B+]

**yourhostandpatron** (6.600): Oh, God, please, don’t let me give commentary for the 90s. I have incredibly mixed thoughts on them as a decade. There were so many revolutionary developments during it that are best left not ignored to the musical mind, and I just love how a quality 90s hit or deep cut actually sounds thanks to that perfect mix of sounding clear and profound and still appearing to belong to a distant past retrosphere, but sometimes...sometimes the 90s are just full of the most boring, most dragging shit that I’ve ever listened to. Sadly, the songs of the summer during the decade more or less fit into the latter category. There are still some real gems here, but this lineup is absolutely not a good show of this period’s best qualities. The classics here can be great, but some of them...are not.

**twat\_brained** (5.890): while my sisters were singing along to "The Boy is Mine" I must've been screaming my head off and acting way too needy for my mother's attention. Good Godney, I could never raise children.

**Leixander** (10): WHEN YOU LEFT I LOST A PART OF ME, IT'S STILL SO HARD TO BELIEVE, COME BACK BABY PLEASE 'CAUSE WE BELONG TOGETHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEURUGHUGHRUH *coughing intensifies*

**skargardin** (10): Mariah unfortunately just misses out on the top three which is such a shame as this song is an absolute classic and would’ve been well deserving of a pedestal place.

---

## who am i going to lean on when times get rough

**\_turbovicki\_** (11): Queen of comebacks

**J\_Toe** (11): This song doesn't really scream 'Summer' to me, but it sure does scream '11'.

**minibjork** (11): this is the ultimate solo karaoke/crying song and it never truly gets old. god bless mariah

**radiofan15** (11): We love an iconic comeback single that was at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 consecutive weeks blocking ANOTHER Mariah song from the top spot while also finishing the decade as the most successful song of the 2000s... I mean that's difficult to get, not everyone has that to their credit!

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (11): Love it Love it Love it. Kids Bop version is a 12 though

**yourhostandpatron** (11): Imagine being so iconic that your most famous song of all time happens fifteen damn years into your career; nobody else can relate, unless they happen to be Madonna! Her summer hit was years ago, though; for many, We Belong Together is still a fresh hit etched in the memory of their minds, and while the song isn’t Mariah’s most complex, it certainly is one of her most enduring. With the perfect set of melancholy lyrics best suited for a comeback and some top-tier vocals that manage to make a song so scarily powerful, We Belong Together definitely deserved to dominate 2005; Mariah’s record may have not undeservedly been broken recently, but her legacy still lives on.

## who's going to talk to me till the sun comes up

**1998tweety** (10): One of her best songs. Periodt.

**bespectacIed** (10): top 5 song on mimi's discography, biggest song of the decade in the US, 15 years into her career and after a period where everyone thought she's over. Legend tingz

**CarlieScion** (10): smooth!!!! and sexy!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I think this may be my favourite song from her. An amazing comeback song!

**jaztinax** (10): one of my all time favorite mariah songs

**notdallin** (10): the most elegant song about pining for your ex ever written, showcasing imo peak Mariah with all of her strengths and punctuated with one well-placed whistle note.

**peppersmith67** (10): There really is a generation growing up unaware of Mariah Carey and that terrifies me. This is foundational.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): pretty alright also stream Touch My Body by SISTAR

**TragicKingdom1** (10): kidz bop who??

**vhqv1997** (10): This is the first song of Mariah that I heard, and from that moment onwards I knew that I could never not be in love with her voice. But back then I wasn't very fluent in English so that was my only impression of hers: a fucking vocalist. But now that I've listened to it again and fully understood the lyrics, I realize that she is an amazing lyricist as well, spitting out verses that flow together so well with such a natural element to them. Despite her vast discography, for me, this song fully cemented her as a legend in my eyes.

**waluigiest** (10): eternal

**twat\_brained** (9.4): oh wait i just realized Mariah has TWO songs of the summer! this is a feat that I realize is difficult to get, not everybody has that to their credit. To her credit, though, this is one of her greatest musical achievements, and I'll so glad it brought her back into grace

**Chevsapher** (9.3): Only Mariah could make such a wordy song into a diva anthem.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): one of her best songs! Still not as good as Despacito tho!

**SteelStepladder** (9): The other Mariah song is getting a ten

**junobeekeeper** (8.6): I love she… literally QUEEN.

## wait a minute this is too deep...

**LuckyKidA** (6.5): it's pretty good but it's not as good as the Zoey 101 theme

**SRTviper** (6): Vision of Love was better sorry Mariah.

**vayyiqra** (6): I like the instrumental but I really don't like Mariah's voice in this

## ... gotta change the station so

**MrSwearword** (0): sanction me or Crimea river but this shit sucks. Ballads are tricky to rock around but drippy, terrible, overplayed ballads are sure to piss me off so much.

**skargardin** (9): Cute little tune but she’s got SO much better songs, but in hindsight it’s really not hard to see why this became the smash it did. In the context of this rate though I am SHOCKED at how high it is. But it’s Carly after all so should we be that surprised?

**Leixander** (7): Sad to see it above many other better songs, but this is popheads so what can I really say?

---

## before you came into my life i missed you so bad

**hefellapart** (11): it's carly, what can i say :miley:. it was between this, genie in a bottle or we belong together.

**jlim201** (11): It's CRJ, and even if it's not that close to her best, it's still her and an obvious choice

**JunkyGS** (11): Queen of popheads and this was such a unifying song for the entire world <3

**rosesmp3** (11): this will forever be THE song of summer for me. it's so light, sweet, breezy, and catchy. i was blown away the first time i heard it and i still enjoy it so much seven years later.

## would give their number to carly

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10

**agentofscranton** (10): i gave this a 0 in the anniversary rate because i was sick of it back then - but then something re-clicked with me again whilst out with my friends - and I just want to apologise for taking part in robbing this song of the score it deserved, i was young and foolish

**AvatarKanol** (10): One of the biggest hits of the decade was Carly's iconic song Call Me Maybe. It launched her into the stratosphere from which she soon fell. A song that will be played in all the 2010's playlist ever. Most of the general public may remember Carly as the Call Me Maybe girl but honestly I don't see how can one can ever top such an iconic and unforgettable track.

**ExtraEater** (10): Great song but Starships was the real song of the summer

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Invented pop music!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Queen of summer!

**notdallin** (10): how can a song dripping with some much 2012 kairos feel so timeless? Is it the symphonic synths made to sound like a mid-sized orchestra of strings behind Carly? Is it the passe idea of girl handing boy her number telling him to call her, knowing full well that by 2012 millennials didn’t answer unknown numbers? Or is it the crippling anxiety that every vulnerable twenty-something has when they put themselves out there in hopes to find another human to share their life with? Suddenly with this in mind, “Call Me, Maybe?” is no longer a nonchalant whateverism but a toe in unknown waters; a premature apology when the consent hasn’t even been considered, the strike-out wounds are still fresh, and the thought of making the first move with a beautiful stranger is terrifying af

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this is probably gonna win the rate

**ryjomom** (10): Yes Mrs. Gay Canada’s Most Catchiest Song Of The Universe Continental

**sbb618** (10): Remember the summer of 2012? With that video of the Harvard baseball team doing the thing to this? Those were simpler times.

**vapourlomo** (10): This is definitely going to win. And I'm fine with that.

**williamdowley123** (10): i heard this girl came out with an album called erection

**Chevsapher** (9.9): This is the epitome of ridiculously catchy bubblegum pop. Those dramatic faux strings will be imprinted on my memory until I die.

**hikkaru** (9): karly ray jensen... has she released anything since this?

**peppersmith67** (9): still my favorite CRJ song sorry everybody

**sailormunelune** (9): anyway, stream dedicated

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Even Carly Rae Jepsen stans love to hate on this song, but don't act like you can't sing every word to it. I remember this came out while I was in high school and the song came on while the the cross country team I was on was warming up for a race. Even though we were all dudes (most presumably straight) we were all able to sing along to it, and did so. This was a phenomenon, and even when Carly performs for crowds that know most of her music, this is still the song that gets everyone the most excited.

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): I think we all love her

**vhqv1997** (9): Damn this song is catchy, the singer sounds great, I don't know who she is but I wonder if she has more songs as fun as this

**waluigiest** (9): gays finally got rights in 2012

**radiofan15** (8.5): with bops like these I can safely say she has a bright and successful career in her future, full of hits and deserved recognition.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): What a gift to enjoy this 2012 song of the summer as a carefree 16-year-old who didn’t know he’d turn into a rabid jepstan 3 and a half years later

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.1): A solid pop song but I never got the hype for Carly (sorry popheads)

**CarlieScion** (8): HEY! I JUST MET YOU!

**vayyiqra** (8): It's hard to look right ... at this song because I've heard it so many damn times. Think how omnipresent this song was in 2012, then double that for what it was like in Canada the summer this came out. It's still undoubtedly a bop though, and incredibly catchy, even if some of the lyrics don't make a ton of sense. I don't feel bad not giving it a higher score because I know Popheads will overrate it because Carly, but it is still a great pop song. Side note: the music video is a great litmus test for whether you're gay or straight, depending on if you're more interested in Carly or the muscle twink she's trying and failing to seduce only to ironically find out he's gay.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I feel like this should be more divisive, in a way. I mean, people usually include this in their collection of songs to add to their ‘2012 was better! I miss normal pop music!’ playlists, and we all generally agree that this is a bop, but this just doesn’t sound as good as any of Carly’s music starting Emotion, and I think we all know that. But for all of how cheap those violins sound, there’s some bubblegum fun to be had with Call Me Maybe; yes, songs as sugary as these are good for nostalgia, and, no, you don’t have to be ashamed for liking them. The slightly lesser Heaven Is A Place on Earth.

**junobeekeeper** (7.5): I love and cherish Carly Rae Jepsen as I have a heart, but this song pales in comparison to the rest of her fantastic discography.

## time for some tea

**SRTviper** (7.5): This is a good song. One of the best on Kiss, but compared to most of Emotion, Dedication, or some of the other pop songs in this rate, Call Me Maybe just doesn’t hold up that well.

**SteelStepladder** (7): I love Carly but I honestly don't think it's phenomenal outside the chorus

**bespectacIed** (2): this is a 10 but there are more deserving songs to win the rate, so I'm giving it a 10 in the binary system

## doesn't care much about carl ray jefferson

**MrSwearword** (1): you're lucky something here sucks worse than this, but this song is utter garbage

**radiofan15** (9.711): What can I say...? I'm a basic hoe [Score: A+]

**yourhostandpatron** (5.833): Oh, God, we have a really mixed bag here, don’t we? This is an incredibly mixed bag. It might be the worst decade in the rate. Now, don’t get me wrong, there are some good songs here (California Girls and Call Me Maybe, I’m talking to you) and Old Town Road technically deserves to be part of this lineup, so I give it my blessing, but I feel as if none of the songs here that I can actually listen to are especially good, and the bad songs here are really and truly awful. They might be the bottom of the barrel, but that might just be a result of overplay. Either way, I’m not a boomer, but this sucks; let’s hope for a better 2020s before we all drown and die from the effects of climate change and global warming.

Leixander: We did think of it, and discussed when we got a strange ballot but decided not to in the end. If this was a rate with three/four albums in it (like most other rates) however, we would definitely put an average limit (for example, 4.00), but this is a "bag of songs" rate so it didn't make much sense for us to do so.

**Leixander** (8.5): A nice summer rain song... But is it really better than most classics? Doubt (X)

---

## well tamar...

**1998tweety** (11): Can Rihanna finally win a rate? This song is so good, everything about it bops so hard.

## buy fenty beauty kits to unlock the next rihanna album NOW

**AvatarKanol** (10): Iconic and showstopping. Umbrella demonstrates the power that Rihanna has. One wonders how this track would have fared if it had gone to Britney like it was supposed to. But we don't live in that kind of world and this is a song that cannot be separated from Rihanna. An undisputed 10.

**bespectacIed** (10): Rihanna ma'am where's the album

**hikkaru** (10): iconique. has a good shot at winning I think and tbh it's what she deserves after the 2009 rate loss

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Honestly it’s one of the greatest pop songs of all time.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of the most iconic songs of the century. best thing for umbrellas and music since singing in the rain

**junobeekeeper** (10): The happiest song about the rain, I guess.

**radiofan15** (10): But we need certain r/popheads members to not sabotage this song too just because a black man they don't like was involved here.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I karaoke this on a daily basis

**SteelStepladder** (10): Flawless, iconic, a true triumph in human achievement

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): invented shielding oneself from precipitation

**vapourlomo** (10): Peak Rihanna. Peak dad-era Jay-Z. Peak rain.

**vhqv1997** (10): Rihanna has always been that eh-eh bitch and I love her so much

**waluigiest** (10): huge flawless she delivered

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Rihanna has released plenty of disposable singles; this is not one of them. The song structure is bulletproof, and the massive synthesizers complement Rihanna's vocals well.

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): And from this song forth, the syllable “Eh” was never the same

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): One of the most unusual things about Umbrella is that it begins with a guest rap instead of letting Jay-Z surprise his audience in the middle of the song, which perhaps indicates just how much of a star Hova was back in 2007, that’s no deterrent to the song, though, despite the fact that I might have to step back into the position of a stereotypical Pophead once and say that Rihanna’s part in this song is better. While this is pretty much the tamest hit the girl has ever had, Umbrella doesn’t disappoint; Rihanna’s accent enters a perfect dance with the heat it follows to bring you her first true classic, cooking up a storm of ‘eh, eh, eh’s that have turned into a generation’s religion. It might as well be pouring talent.

**CarlieScion** (9): a-ha a-ha a-ha a-ha

**nick1372** (9): Jay Z is unnecessary but there's a reason this is Rihanna's signature song

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): Loved this song as a kid. still do

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.9): One of the best pop songs of the 00s

**twat\_brained** (8.6): A great early hit for Rihanna and also Jay implements a well-fitted feature. It's rather evident this is a GarageBand style song, though, and for me Don't Stop the Music will always be the best song on GGGB. That is, of course, aside from Disturbia if you count Reloaded.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the fact that this was made with default garageband instruments always sends me

**notdallin** (8.4): Rihanna just has a *presence*. I’d much prefer one of her more summery-sounding songs to be remembered in the canon of songs of the summer like SOS, Work, If It’s Lovin’ That You Want, Rude Boy, or even Pon De Replay, but Rihanna can take any song and instantly make it iconic just through her cool nonchalance. We didn’t know it then, of course, but “Umbrella” cemented her main pop girl status forever. And so in the late 2010’s Rihanna drought that we’re currently suffering through, RihRih only has to wink and remind us “Told you, I’d be here forever” and our crops are thriving.

**peppersmith67** (8): Growing up as a trash ass cis dude has only made me realize all the excellent pop music I forced myself to hate when I was younger I'm sorry Rihanna I shoulda been stronger for u.

**ryjomom** (8): wish it was a solo song

**SRTviper** (8): I may have hated this song in middle school, but I think I’m mature enough to say that this song is objectively a good time.

## garageband??? more like garbageband!!

**vayyiqra** (7): First of all, what the hell is this intro. I have to deduct a point for it because it sucks. Secondly, this song is a bop and always has been. I swear the instrumental track sounds different here from what I remember though, like it's been mixed differently. It sounds like the level music from a Sonic the Hedgehog game for the Sega Genesis. Finally, it only bothers me slightly that she adds an extra syllable and says UM-BUH-REL-LA.

## rihanna should play storm in the next inevitable x-men movie [2]

**agentofscranton** (6): queen of causing rampant flooding in the UK for the entirety of it's reign at number one in the British charts

## te amo says hello

**MrSwearword** (5): better Rihanna songs exist, deal accordingly

**Leixander** (10): This put Beyoncé on legend status in the start of her career, which is not easy to do and not everyone has that to their credit.

**skargardin** (7): Look, do NOT come for me for giving this score but I honestly think that this sounds kinda dated? I mean it’s good of course, but I wouldn’t put it in such high regards as some of yall did. Oh well, it IS our rate winner so congratulations are in order to the one, the only, queen bee!

---

## literally no negative comments

**bespectacIed** (11): being part of the hive literally gave me worms for brains because despite of the caliber of songs in this rate, i couldn't NOT give this ground-breaking, career-starting, star-making, generation-defining, wig-snatching, pussy-popping, badly-produced (according to the resident know-it-alls of this sub) SUMMER ANTHEM. That "You ready?" made many a gay man the hoe they are today, and became a premonition that for anything Bey delivers in the future, no one will ever be truly ready. This is the ultimate song of the summer, and will continue to be in the next 10 or so summers until either global warming or fascism or both eventually jumps us all dead.

**DrunkHurricane** (11): iconic

**notdallin** (11): despite the constant r/popheads greek chorus criticizing the supposed poor mastering of the production, this song will always sound timeless. Too ecstatic to care that this song came out nearly two decades ago, as soon as those circular horns blare in, everyone immediately gets on their feet as if an emergency siren is going off. By 2019, the story of Beyonce and Jay-Z singing about how crazy in love they are with each other has had a long and interesting history but I don’t think anything, not Countdown, Drunk In Love, Love on Top, Deja Vu, or Partition, can ever top this one this one. Every move they’ve made for their relationship for at least the last 10 years has felt calculated, but this song stands as a beacon of their honeymoon phase, an invitation to dance, sweat, let loose, and *go crazy*.

**waluigiest** (11): go to timestamp 0:06:08 in the Netflix special Homecoming and tell me this does not deserve an 11

**1998tweety** (10): I lowkey prefer the 50S ballad version but this is good too.

**agentofscranton** (10): the obvious winner

**AvatarKanol** (10): Completely deserving of it's place in the pantheon of iconic 2000's songs. Crazy in Love creates a song that won't be soon forgotten.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Still a classic after all this time (even if it talks about paging)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Queen B!

**J\_Toe** (10): love it, even if it's disputably off beat

**nick1372** (10): Hey I just met you / and this is crazy / but here's my number / so page me maybe?

**peppersmith67** (10): I'll legitimately be amazed if this doesn't easily win it hasn't aged a day.

**radiofan15** (10): Yoncé really did her thing here... we should really stream LEMONADE and the Lion King soundtrack to celebrate her!

**ryjomom** (10): can’t relate i'm lonely and sain

**sailormunelune** (10): Most incredibly, it's ya girl, Bey

**sbb618** (10): One of the most exuberant songs ever. You can just feel the energy, the joy shimmering from every note of this song.

**Chevsapher** (9.6): The subpar mixing and rough vocals can't hold back this absolute steamroller of a song.

**minibjork** (9.5): why isn't this in the great american songbook

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): A summer song if I ever heard one.

**jaztinax** (9): the brass section sample, the fast-paced chorus… iconic

**SteelStepladder** (9): Those horns <3

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (9): Song has aged really well

**twat\_brained** (9): the mixing may be off (not sure how but y'all say it is) but this still goes the fuck OFF. And especially when Beyoncé does this live with a big band arrangement to match her big ass stage presence… if there's ever a song that sounds better live than recorded it's this legendary artefact of recording art. And I just remember watching the video on MuchMusic with my sisters as a 5 year old being so mesmerized by the visuals. Fun tune

**vhqv1997** (9): The production on this is the biggest negative, but it's also the only negative. The song is a bright spot in Beyonce's discography and it's definitely one of her biggest classics and one that convinced the public of her undeniable stardom.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): We’ve actually rated Destiny’s Child as a group multiple times on this sub, but here we touch on a very early point in Beyonce’s career for the first time; fortunately, her debut solo single is a real classic to the ears of both hip hop and pop. Though its production and lyrics may be slightly dated, Beyonce manages to light up the dance floor with both elegance and fun along with her future husband in this memorable hit; the dance Crazy In Love’s melody takes us up upon is a brilliant throwback, and Jay-Z’s guest verse just ascends the song to new heights. Not Beyonce’s best, but one of her greatest.

**junobeekeeper** (8.7): I enjoy the idea of this song more than the actual song, which is still a really phenomenal song.

**MrSwearword** (8): there's at least 40 better Beyonce songs than this alone but regardless, it is indeed a jam.

**vapourlomo** (8): 10s Beyonce > 00s Beyonce (this song is still great, obviously)

**vayyiqra** (8): As a straight white man on Reddit I am legally required to say "DAE Beyonce overrated", which I will stand by, but this is without a doubt my favourite song by her. It's repetitive but it's a bop, and I always love a good horn line.

## okay maybe one not that positive comment

**rslashpoopheads** (7): deeply overrated

## how? how? how? how?

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.6): how had I managed to avoid this for 16 years

Leixander: # 00s

---

**Overall Average**: 7.760 **// Average Controversy:** 1.974

---

(Leix): Has a few duds but the best decade in this rate.

---
**radiofan15** (8.350): Despite a shaky start, this decade went back on track In it's second half with bop after bop after bop! [Score: B+]

**yourhostandpatron** (7.700): The 00s are still my least favourite decade in pop music because of all the loudness wars that took place, but I must admit that sometimes it had real gems; within the context of the rate, the decade’s hits of the summer certainly make me want to give it a chance. Of course, we have some flops in here, like that godawful Black-Eyed Peas song, but classics like Crazy In Love, Promiscuous, and Umbrella make me believe that the 00s were a good-ass time for blending in hip hop and pop music, thanks to the efforts Mariah Carey made back in 1995 (and her song here is amazing, too). Doubtless the sea of much more terrible hits will make me go back on giving the 00s another chance, but for now, I will enjoy them a bit more than I used to; this is good-ass stuff.
