Billboard Songs of the Summer (1958-2018) Rate Reveal - Day 1: Wasn't ultimate male rate done months ago?
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/cr98nr/billboard_songs_of_the_summer_19582018_rate/

Hello everyone! Welcome to the day 1 of Billboard Songs of the Summer rate. I will reveal the scores and the comments here on the subreddit while my dear co-host u/skargardin is taking charge of the [plug.dj](https://plug.dj/popheads/) reveal. Join along, as the real rate experience^TM is in plug.dj. We will switch roles tomorrow, and the other day as well. **We are starting at 11AM PT / 2 PM ET / 6PM GMT (1 hour from now)**

---

The results are... interesting?.. Let's move on to some usual trivia:

> Number of participants: 57

> Average score: 6.955

> Average controversy score: 2.157

Before any confusion occurs for people who didn't do rates before, controversy score is the standard deviation. If a song has a higher controversy than the average above, that means it is more controversial than usual(for example, a song getting multiple 11s and 0s would cause the controversy score to spike up). That's the case for some songs today, as usual for the first day of a rate.

**skargardin** (2): Bet you thought that this would NOT be the first song out huh? But honestly, who’s surprised? This is a serious injustice to Elvis. No redeemable qualities whatsoever were found.

**Leixander** (0): Who listened to this, who bought this, I need names.

---

## even the positive leaning comments are shady

**1998tweety** (9): This is so shady but literally every cover I've heard of this has been better; the Lilo and Stitch one in particular being the best.

**Chevsapher** (7.6): An odd cover, to say the least.

**peppersmith67** (7.5): this is like a mashup of five different genres and I think I like three of them? what a weird song.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): ok

**ignitethephoenix** (6): really don’t like this cover much

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): interesting cover

**agentofscranton** (5): if I didn't know the original version this'd probably get a higher score but it just so aggressively pales in comparison to Elvis' version it's not even funny

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): lauryn hill bodied this version

**junobeekeeper** (5): Originally I gave this song a one and some harsh commentary because I was annoyed or whatever. But then I heard it again at a grocery store and I was like "huh this actually isn't as bad as I thought it was." Not great, but not bad tbh.

**MrSwearword** (5): neither too awful nor exceptional in any way

**jaztinax** (4): i hate all covers of this song because this song is so boring but this one grew on me as I listened to it

## drag them ladies

**SRTviper** (5): (I Can’t Help) But Skipping This Song

**static\_int\_husp** (5): holy shit this remix of an S-tier elvis song is badddd

**CarlieScion** (4): the original is so much better.

**nick1372** (4): out of ALL the covers of this song, why this one? This guy's annoying voice and the ridiculous production make this one of the worst versions of this I've ever heard.

**slimboyfriend** (4): This song has been covered so many times and this version is the most lukewarm I think I’ve heard.

**hefellapart** (3.5): i like the original better

**bespectacIed** (3): what is dis hunny

**magikarpals** (3): i like this song but only when i'm singing it

**napsandnetflix** (3): omg elvis i am honestly so sorry

**vayyiqra** (3): One of the worst-conceived mashups in modern history, after pineapple on pizza..

**yourhostandpatron** (3): Jesus Christ, I’m gonna have to agree with Public Enemy on their overall view of Elvis (man was a pedo who appropriated from black folks even if he wasn’t really racist as a person) but I can still acknowledge that (I Can’t Help) Falling In Love With You is a goddamn classic thanks to that angelic crooner of a voice, and, holy shit, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a song done more dirty than whatever the fuck UB-40 is doing to it in this cover. This is why cover versions deserved to die, guys. A couple of pale-ass men are making this song into the most whitewashed reggae shit possible in front of your very ears, and you can do nothing to stop it. There’s not one particularly atrocious moment here, which is why this is spared from the dreaded 1 or 2, but mother of God, it can go.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i hate UB40 and this guy's stupid voice and twenty one pilots majorly outpeaked

**waluigiest** (2): this song’s been covered endlessly and this was the one they picked for a summer???

**BearlyEvenAPun** (1): There are at least 573 better covers of this song out there to listen to

**twat\_brained** (1): why in fuck's name were ub40 ever allowed more than 1 hit

**vhqv1997** (1): Excuse me but Elvis Presley owns this song, he owns it. This version sucks ass. It turns an intimate, emotional, and romantic song to a trashy pointless dance track that belongs in a shredder. I just can't, how the hell did people in 1993 like this song that much?

**CreepyMannequin** (0): There were songs that I was already familiar with that I was considering giving my 0, but the moment I heard this song I knew it was going to be my 0. The lead singer’s voice is just the right combination of annoying features to piss me off. Also, obligatory “A-Teens did it better”

**notdallin** (0): WHO OKAYED THIS COVER???? I WANT NAMES

**radiofan15** (0): Elvis sweetie i'm so sorry, i'm so sorry an ugly bitch would even do that to you... the pseudo-ska arrangement shows everything that's wrong with AC radio even up to this day, the vocals are atrociously laughable and the horns, even if they're a nice addition, felt violently unwelcomed here.

**SteelStepladder** (0): This is a war crime

**vapourlomo** (0): UB40 might be the least redeemable band to ever be massively popular. Their music is so stiff, boring and badly aged.

**Leixander** (5): Would be a classic if not for the ultra bad and problematic lyrics.

**skargardin** (0): The message of this song alone is enough to warrant a zero, but then you have Robin Thicke’s god awful vocals that makes it even more grating to listen to.

---

## stream lily allen's no shame, now on every streaming platform (seriously, it is a good album)

**1998tweety** (10): A massive bop, stay bitter.

**ExtraEater** (10): Great song but Get Lucky was the real song of the summer

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the song is catchy and danceable

**JunkyGS** (10): Problematic Bops are still Bops

**letsallpoo** (10): i wont apologize

**radiofan15** (10): Problematic bop that changed the industry music forever, killed a career and a marriage and introduced us to Gibby's girlfriend Emily Ratawhatever... not every song can have this much impact.

**Chevsapher** (8.6): I'm only rating this song so highly because it's a good track if you ignore the lyrics. And oof, those lyrics.

**DrunkHurricane** (8): I might get attacked for this but saying this song is about rape is a huge stretch

**vapourlomo** (8): I think we all know the real song of the summer 2013 was Get Lucky, right? But this is still super-catchy (if you ignore the icky lyrics)

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): The message of this song is bad...but it’s undeniably catchy and I understand why it was a summer hit. Also my brain has the image of Miley Cyrus twerking on Robin Thicke burned in my brain so I associate this song with that too.

**jaztinax** (7.5): ugh i was so stuck on what to give this because i LOVE the track and the melody but the lyrics and the execution is 500 thumbs down

**magikarpals** (7): literally every time this comes on the radio 1. i don't recognize it 2. i get super into it 3. i realize what song it is around "tried to domesticate ya" 4. wow ive failed myself again

**rslashpoopheads** (7): this is gonna get canceled hard so I'll give it some pity points

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): This song wasn't that bad

**peppersmith67** (6.9): At least the bassline isn't rape-y?

**notdallin** (6.7): SMWS - “Fat Albert there up in the beginning”

## the way you drag me, must wanna get messy

**vayyiqra** (6): I don't even know how to rate this. Yes, I know the lyrics are creepy and rapey; that isn't a huge factor in my rating, but it does keep me from liking it too much. It's catchy, yeah, but there's no substance to it. Also, Pharrell is overhated, but Robin Thicke is a douche, so there's that. The only thing good about it is that the video has Emily Ratajkowski in it, who I really like for some reason and whose name is a lot of fun to say.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): they deserved to be sued for writing the line "from dakota to decatur"

**twat\_brained** (5): wait why didn't people immediately catch on to the stolen Marvin Gaye sample? also JESUS, this song cannot exist in the #metoo era. I think the song would've aged better with less grody lyrics even, just a messy career move.

**yourhostandpatron** (5): Okay, to be honest, I don’t understand why everybody is so up in fits about the fact that Robin Thicke was sued for copying from Got To Give It Up. I don’t listen to Marvin Gaye often, but people, the two songs sound exactly the same. That’s not the only controversy about this song that’s difficult to navigate, though! Here’s my stance on this: yes, I doubt that Pharrel of all people intentionally wrote a song invalidating women’s content, but the way this song’s performers and writers try to reframe this as a feminist anthem it pitiful; it’s a mediocrly written typical party anthem at best, and the supposedly ‘satirical’ music video does not help matters. This can stay back in 2013 with all the other fossils it keeps company with. It’s mildly catchy, but it’s an average relic in the grand scheme of music.

**SteelStepladder** (4): Not as bad as its reputation makes it out to be but still not good

**CarlieScion** (3): this is still creepy.

**SRTviper** (3): I am very uncomfortable

**williamdowley123** (3): is this the most thinkpieced song ever? i hate this song but i kinda like it as well??????? like i can see why it was a big hit

**LeninaCrowne94** (2.3): It's not actually that bad musically, but because of the rapey lyrics I can't be too nice to it.

**slimboyfriend** (2): Every time I remember this song, I always think “Yeah, it might be a ripoff and the lyrics may be trash, but it’s actually kinda good.” And then I actually listen to it and can’t even focus on the music because the lyrics are SO insidious and repulsive.

**bespectacIed** (1): for the solid production i guess. But smack cam to everyone who had a hand on this rape song

**junobeekeeper** (1): God this song sucked. Like even ignoring the lyrics, the "woo" is so annoying and it's just very very very bad. Also remember Paula bc that was a mess lmao.

**MrSwearword** (1): a song that would've just aged poorly any other timeline but this song here created thinkpiece culture and for that, I must trash it to the depths of hell.

**static\_int\_husp** (1): I remember this song being really controversial even when it was released. In hindsight I feel like it's even worse. Lyrics are super super problematic (in the #MeToo era, I wonder if it would even get much radio play), but the instrumental feels super dated now, too. It's like 4 sounds arranged in the most generic way possible.

**vhqv1997** (1): Can anybody believe this song was nominated for TWO fucking Grammys?

## the army of 0s

**agentofscranton** (0): lmao fuck this song

**AvatarKanol** (0): Now we come to this... song. I find this track borderline unlistenable. Listening to Robin Thicke singing about domestocating women makes me very uncomfortable. Usually this is a complete skip for me but I listened to it for the sake of completion. Let's hope this song stays in the past.

**hefellapart** (0): its basically a copycat song with 0 effort.

**hikkaru** (0): the lyrics are disgusting and the production/melody isn't interesting enough to get any points from that so a 0 it is

**J\_Toe** (0): NO!

**minibjork** (0): the uproar this song received....probably my first proper introduction to feminist thought at the ripe age of thirteen.

**nick1372** (0): I'm not even gonna try to find a cheeky response like everyone else in this rate inevitably will. Fuck Robin Thicke and fuck everyone involved in this song. It's just disgusting.

**rosesmp3** (0): this song is so sleazy i feel like i've gotta go bleach my earbuds now that i've listened to it

**ryjomom** (0): how did a song about rape and drugging become so accepted and popular

**waluigiest** (0): literally what the fuck this isn’t even separating art from the artist. the art is about rape just look at the title what were we collectively thinking

**Leixander** (10): Nostalgia trip for times I wasn't even close enough to being born for twenty more years at the very least. Reminds me of the cheesy love movies of the old Hollywood. Kinda sad to see this going out before some very horrible songs but not surprised.

**skargardin** (4): This is just so insanely boring that I’m having a hard time finding any substantial to say for a writeup. You all were NOT having it with this white-bread song.

---

## roses are red, violets are blue....

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I’m pretty sure this is the best song that this rate’s introduced me too. I mean...sure, in the grand scheme of classic radio, it’s not very special (also, I find the lyrics song kind of weirdly sentimental because I can never tell if the guy is singing to a lover or a daughter, or god forbid both) but holy heck, can the Polish Prince sing well. One last nice slice of innocence in the 60s before things get even more heated.

**Chevsapher** (8.1): A well-crafted pop song, but it's exceedingly generic.

**napsandnetflix** (8): ugh driving down to the beach with friends, windows down, wind in my hair, blasting bobby vinton ballads is what summer is all about

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is cute

**MrSwearword** (7): bummer sounding but I guess the intent was to have a spring social formal danceria or whatever shit from this time was called.

**notdallin** (7): is this the 1962 version of HAGS?

## sugar is not that sweet anymore and i hate my life

**sbb618** (5): Is this what summer songs were like before the sixties? Oof.

**twat\_brained** (5): wait this isn't Michael Bublé? I guess all swing artists sound the same to me. Robert can't seriously think the epitome of high school love is writing in someone's yearbook, can he? I sure hope not at least.

**waluigiest** (5): yep smells like 1960’s

**SRTviper** (4.5): Coming from Tossin' And Turnin this is a bit of a snooze cruise.

**ignitethephoenix** (4): kind of cringey to me

**minibjork** (4): now i know how important motown & the british invasion was because stuff like this is b o r i n g !!

**slimboyfriend** (4): The most average teen pop song

**vayyiqra** (4): boring

**peppersmith67** (3.5): Out of all the possible Bobby Vinton bangers Billboard could have picked they selected this snorefest smh

**CarlieScion** (3): i feel like this is the ed sheeran of the 50s

**ImADudeDuh** (3): bitch copied a basic ass poem and acted like her really did something huh

**jaztinax** (3): i'm adding this to my sleep playlist. very soothing, but also very long-winding and boring. so, perfect addition!

**nick1372** (3): this sounds like what every annoying heterosexual high school romance movie is like

**SteelStepladder** (3): Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, this song is poo

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): this is too straight for me

**vapourlomo** (3): zzzz

**radiofan15** (2.5): Such a saccharine bunch of diabetes!

**AvatarKanol** (2): The writing of this track is horrendous. I hate it so much. The way he struggles to connect the lines to make a nice sound is desperate. Horrible!

**magikarpals** (2): it's not even three minutes but it feels like 56 years

**ryjomom** (2): these boring songs these popular white artists got away with when motown was poppin

**agentofscranton** (1): nothing says summer like the colour beige in song form

**rslashpoopheads** (1): thanks I hate it

**DrunkHurricane** (0): boring, stupid, cheesy, dated song by the cheesiest and most boring artist of the 60s

**junobeekeeper** (0): What was with the songs about high schoolers in this era? It cannot have been like this. I really really hate this. The way he sings "sweet" has some weird vocal fry and it's just not good. There's so much here I don't like. Give it up, Bobby, she's not gonna fuck you.

**Leixander** (2): I guess vision of love and baby got back was so strong that people only cried because of their awesomeness for two years, the mediocre summer songs of 93 and 94 can't be explained otherwise

---

## pinky swear that you're gonna keep it

**ExtraEater** (10): This is actually insanely underrated and does not deserve Day 1

**ryjomom** (9): a beautiful love song that sends me into a dissociative state

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The strings, saxophone, harmonies, and hook all help this song stand out among all the cheesy R&B ballads of its day. Who would have guessed it was a cover of a country song?

**notdallin** (8): >hears eerily similar chord progressions to a song by a white boy band from a few years later >silently crushes N*SYNC CD

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): For some reason, I trust these guys more than the average singer when they say swear they will give me everything.

**1998tweety** (7): I don't like their vocals but its ok

**static\_int\_husp** (7): as the boy band song of the rate... it's fine

**peppersmith67** (6): discount store Boyz II Men can still get it I guess

## twinkle twinkle little rock star did it better

**vayyiqra** (6): Other than nostalgia, this has nothing for me. Pure cheese, and not the good kind. Like, Velveeta that's been melted in a microwave, not Swiss fondue.

**vhqv1997** (5): I swear. That most of the covers in this rate are really not good compared to their original versions

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): I remember hearing this song on those commercials for call-to-order compilation CDs from my childhood, NEVER knew it had an actual title

**junobeekeeper** (4.4): It's just too slow for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Boyz II Slightly Older Boyz

**SteelStepladder** (4): zzz zzz zzz

**twat\_brained** (4): I can swear too. fuck this song and its use in so many stupid romcoms

**yourhostandpatron** (4): Apparently this is just an RnB version of an earlier country song; that would remind you of I Will Always Love You, but the difference here is that I Will Always Love You is actually a song I enjoy hearing. Maybe I Swear’s original take is much more tender and genuine than what I’m listening to here (this has nothing to do with the genre shift, I just don’t think a manufactured group assemble is doing the song any wonders) but as it stands, the utter boredom I get from this remake of it is not encouraging me to hear anything to do with I Swear ever again. It’s not frighteningly inoffensive, but it sure is dull.

**waluigiest** (3): generally unpleasant and/or uninteresting

**CarlieScion** (2): this is worse than one directions worst ballads

**J\_Toe** (2): ok i'll admit, I hate these slow 90s ballads

**rslashpoopheads** (2): why listen to this when you could stream SISTAR

**MrSwearword** (1): oh gross, wedding shit

**radiofan15** (1): ZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz

**Leixander** (4): The downgrade from last year... 1991 deserved a better song of summer!

**skargardin** (4): NO, I’ve never been a fan of Bryan Adams’ music, being forced to listen and SING him during primary and middle-school music classes.

---

## i have been saving all my summers for you

**AvatarKanol** (10): Such a beautiful song.

**radiofan15** (10): God there's so many tens in this rate... this ballad is EVERYTHING... the raspy vocals, the epic but easy to the ears arrangment... ugh Bryan snapped here!

**vhqv1997** (10): Another song straight people always use for their wedding dance. Although I am surprised that it is THIS long, everytime I heard it it's always the first half that gets played.

**Chevsapher** (7.6): This is a serviceable song, but it's so incredibly boring. Nothing about it captures my interest.

**agentofscranton** (7.5): Stewie Griffin outsold

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I thought this song was done, and then it continued with 2.5 minutes left?!!? Please don’t do that when your song is already a good length.

**peppersmith67** (7.5): Gotta give the edge to Bryan Adams over Richard Marx and Steve Winwood in the showdown of the mediocre white boy anthems. good on you Bryan

**rosesmp3** (7): for my entire life my mom has had a huge crush on bryan adams, i never knew that he experienced any degree of success so seeing this song here was a surprise lol

**rslashpoopheads** (7): pretty aight but what's with the mixing

**sbb618** (7): There was a part about four minutes into this song where it fades out, and I was thinking "Finally, we're done". And then it comes back and keeps going for TWO AND A HALF MINUTES

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I vary rarely say this but, you know what, this song is too long

**notdallin** (6.6): must. resist. urge. to. slo-mo. air guitar!!!!

**1998tweety** (6.5): This is kind of ok but his voice sounds so irritating and raspy at points.

## rains of castamere is a better wedding song

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Hey, isn’t this the guy we cancelled earlier on this year? Okay, no, that was Ryan Adams. Sorry, I just did that to piss Ryan Adams off in case he’s reading this. Bryan Adams is fine, in my books. Well, maybe his music isn’t, because nothing he’s made really impresses me, but it doesn’t offend me, either; sentimentality gets to me sometimes, and (Everything I Do) I Do It For You probably makes for a killer song at a wedding. The problem here is that I’m not at a wedding. This does not need to be seven minutes long. I do not see the need to waste my time hearing it alone.

**ryjomom** (6): sounds like a song that would be played as the finale of some 80s band that has been doing a reunion tour for the past 30 years

**vapourlomo** (6): I think this song is fine and I apologize for not hating it

**CarlieScion** (5): sappy ballads? not my thing

**minibjork** (4): in which bryan adams doesn't get the memo that 80s ballads should stay in the 80s

**nick1372** (4): Did I really have to listen to six and a half minutes of this? I thought it ends at the four minute mark and then it starts all over again?? I don't want to hear bryan adams's annoying raspy voice try to serenade me any more MAKE IT STOP

**slimboyfriend** (4): Schlocky

**vayyiqra** (4): Now, now, the Canadian government has apologized for Bryan Adams on several occasions.

**waluigiest** (4): aw man really I thought we moved on from content like this

**ImADudeDuh** (3): its bad, but its not the worst song ever

**LeninaCrowne94** (2.5): Possibly unpopular opinion but the 90s was the worst decade for music. Songs like this are part of why.

**junobeekeeper** (2.3): I don't like soft rock.

**SRTviper** (2.1): (All I Hear) Is The Phlegm In His Throat

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): i'm so fucking bored

**twat\_brained** (1.3): I wonder if I hate this song as much as I used to. I don't remember this lazy ass guitar solo but it adds nothing to the song. Also why the hell does it need to be 6 and a half minutes long? Dear Godney, Bryan Adams is a stain on Canadian music heritage. Let's big up more artists like Allie, Carly and Shawn instead

**MrSwearword** (1): nope. Sappy ballad and bad vocals is a NOPE

**SteelStepladder** (1): I wish I had two zeroes to give because this song is dogshit

**TragicKingdom1** (0): already been in a zero in one rate, will continue to be a zero in every subsequent rate it somehow gets into

**skargardin** (6): This song makes me feel intrigued and confused at the same time, lowkey chaotic but also well, really not. It’s annyoing as hell but I don’t really mind it tbh. Most of you did have a case against this song though.

**Leixander** (3): This is very underwhelming compared to the other songs in this decade, the recorder/flute portion sounds so amateurly played. What the hell happened in 1966 to have this song on top??

---

## we brought our drums and this is how we dance

**magikarpals** (10): pure fun

**J\_Toe** (9): I love the Futurama intro/theme

**vapourlomo** (9): This is a mess in the best possible way

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The dynamic range in this track is fascinating.

**notdallin** (8.8): ◄ ▲ ► ◄ ▲ ► *The Troggs* you are the hero of time...

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): The Troggs walked so Kacey Musgraves could run

**MrSwearword** (8): a case of I don't think "summer" with this song, I think "classic song that actually deserves some of the praise it gets"

**peppersmith67** (8): This song has the strangest big dick energy of all time.

**vhqv1997** (8): Kacey Musgraves outsold

**sbb618** (7.5): Way, way more boring than the X cover. This one just feels too laid-back in comparison, especially for a song called "Wild Thing".

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): wow i’m suddenly horny

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Hmm, I like this! Admittedly, there’s not much replay value here thanks to how stripped down everything is, but the combination of country and rock here makes for a sincere love song coming from the days of LSD and anti-war protests (and, don’t get me wrong, I’m all for the latter, but sometimes you just need a calm ode to somebody you like in a decade of chaos). A weird hit for the summer, but it’s decent.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.4): Good enough, but doesn't really stand out in this amazing era for music.

**1998tweety** (7): This is weird, so I give it points for that, but its not the kind of weird I like.

**SteelStepladder** (7): Wild thing I think you're halfway decent

**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's fine I guess

**waluigiest** (6): classic but not something I would seek out

## fellow alessians

**CarlieScion** (5): alessia cara outsold

**twat\_brained** (2.7): Alessia did it WAYYYYYY better

## as wild as clairo

**minibjork** (6): the spoken parts make me want to die

**vayyiqra** (6): It's a classic but it's also really boring.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Ton Loc outpeaked MAJORLY

**nick1372** (5): kind of a snooze

**SRTviper** (5): This song is not wild enough.

**junobeekeeper** (4.7): He sounds like he's on the verge of sneezing, like he has a cold. For all of these songs, I'm trying to imagine how a person hearing this song for the first time would feel but I don't know what to say. Is that a recorder btw?

**jaztinax** (4): i just realized i've only heard this song being sung or yelled over in tv and movies. and i think i liked it better that way.

**bespectacIed** (3): boring af but if a 2000s band released this and packaged it as a "lo-fi indie" i would absolutely eat

**AvatarKanol** (2): I really didn't like this, it's pretty boring. Let's not talk about the tragic flute. The singer has a voice I really don't want to hear ever again.

**radiofan15** (1): I'm gonna have to say FUCK YOU to this song... FUCK YOU A THOUSAND WAYS YOU FUCKER!

**Leixander** (10): For some reason this sounds very innocent and cute.

**skargardin** (5): I don’t mind this song at all but it’s just so weird that THIS became the song of the summer, even more so regarding that some of you didn’t even know about it?! Like I would get it I you didn’t know a song from 30 years ago but this was FOUR YEARS AGO and some of you still had never heard of it, honestly kinda shocked at it. It is pretty forgettable and milquetoast as far as trop-pop goes.

---

## OMI gave us world peace

**letsallpoo** (10): this is a good song and not a bad song

**magikarpals** (10): this was a legit song of the summer for me and it still gives me those same good vibes

**radiofan15** (10): I know everyone hates (unfairly) this tropical and smooth bop... but at least we're not ranking Rude, which would have been something inherently tragic.

**sbb618** (10): This song is so wholesome and I love it

**waluigiest** (10): THIS SONG IS WHACK BUT I LOVE IT I’M GONNA PLAY IT REALLY LOUD IN MY CAR IN A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Sweet, fun, and melodically tight. Trop-pop became trite quickly, but I still enjoy this track.

**bespectacIed** (9): OMI really gave us this chill trop pop classic before the genre boomed, then dipped

**williamdowley123** (9): the song isnt even that good but this brought back so memories aaa

**twat\_brained** (8.1): say what you will about the song aging poorly, it's pleasing to my ear to rediscover this chill summer trop pop bop

**1998tweety** (8): Felix Jaehn is a hot bicon so this 8 is for him

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Felix Jaehn is bisexual, so this song is legally a gay anthem.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I hate this song

**DrunkHurricane** (7.5): it's okay but extremely forgettable

**minibjork** (7.4): i must of dropped off the face of the earth during the summer of 2015 because i don't remember this song being so huge wtf

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I feel like the radio sped this up a bit, which makes it a better song than the actual version.

**vhqv1997** (7): This song was alright but honestly how was this ever a song of the summer when I have literally never heard it before in my life??? I mean, I think it's a perfectly adequate song, the horns section is incredible (I'm a sucker for horns) but the song is so shallow and empty otherwise.

**notdallin** (6.9): do people talk like this??? -> “do you need me? Do you think i’m pretty? Do i make you feel like cheating” i’m like, “no not really”

**MrSwearword** (6): normally anything this tacky would get read to hell but at least there's something charming about this. I still won't listen to this shit outside the rate but it's not the worst.

**nick1372** (6): A really boring song that says nothing. But Felix Jaehn's production is impeccable, if nothing completely original

**vayyiqra** (6): Wtf, I've never heard this song in my life. I like the beat but the vocals aren't very good. It's okay, I guess?

**junobeekeeper** (5.8): This song reminds me of a time when Vine still existed. That's all.

**yourhostandpatron** (5.5): Oh, come on, now, are you telling me that See You Again wasn’t the song of the summer in fucking 2015?! It would have been hilarious to see I’ll Be Missing You and it in the same rate; what a wasted opportunity! I’m finding it hard to say that much about this; it’s funny how summery it is for a song that was released the year before trop pop dominated radio, and it’s a bit relevant as one of the last happy songs we’ve heard before the mess that year became, but OMI just isn’t a very interesting singer and Cheerleader isn’t just a song that gets you into spirits. To be fair, I have some nostalgic memories about hearing this all the time in a classmate’s restaurant while I looked up astrology and ate sour cream fries, but that was when I was 13; that was a terrible year.

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): Standard 10s bop, but hey it makes me smile

## couldn't find the cheerleader

**SteelStepladder** (5): Ooooo I think that this song is very mediocre

**AvatarKanol** (3): Here we have another song that was inescapable during it's peak. I for one am very thankful it has been forgotten. This is one of the most obnoxious songs that I have ever heard and I hope to never hear it again.

**J\_Toe** (3): I guess any song can make this list...

**slimboyfriend** (3): I look back and I don’t even know how this song became popular. Like……. Who even listened to it

**static\_int\_husp** (3): I'm not really sure how this got so big. Also not sure what the hell happened to Omi, who seemed to exist only for this one song, then dropped off the face of the Earth

**vapourlomo** (2): I'm sorry but how was The Hills not song of the summer in 2015?

**agentofscranton** (1): this song was never good and i wish to be excluded from the narrative that it was actually a great song that got overplayed - it's bad and it should feel bad

**CarlieScion** (1): this is such a big ball of nothing

**ryjomom** (1): I thought I’d try to listen to this with an open mind but the only thing open my mouth after hearing this monstrosity

**SRTviper** (1): What did they do to this man’s voice!? This is borderline intolerable. A serious 0 contender for sure.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): It just never really gets off the ground. I feel like I'm listening to someone else fall asleep.

**jaztinax** (0): i wasn’t going to give any songs a zero but i truly hate this song. it just reminds me of why i tuned out of mainstream pop in this period. i don’t like the singer, the chorus irks me, and the way the producer/dj has remixed the vocals makes it sound even more annoying than the original is

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (0): If I ever hear this again I might die

notdallin: Not gonna lie, 2015 was a pretty bad year for popular pop music so when the summer song race was between this and Wiz Khalifa's "See You Again" you know we were scraping the bottom of the barrel.

**Leixander** (7): Short and to the point, the somewhat somber sounding late 50s/early 60s instrumentation here is the thing that makes it shine for me.

**skargardin** (7): I can groove to these instrumentals, they’re pretty smooth, the short length helps it not overstay its welcome.

---

## me_irl

**radiofan15** (8.8): Paul Anka did what he had to do here... he deserves more recognition.

**nick1372** (8): a whole ass gay mood

**Chevsapher** (7.7): It's... definitely a pop song.

**notdallin** (7.1): i guess desperate summers call for desperate measures

**MrSwearword** (7): cute, but inconsequential at large

**TragicKingdom1** (7): honestly not nearly as dreadful as i anticipated

**yourhostandpatron** (7): I’m not really a fan of Paul Anka’s voice (it’s a bit too...whiny for my ears) but considering how many old songs there are about feeling lonely that probably use the exact same rhyming scheme as this one (I’m Mr. Lonely...I have nobody…) this is quite enjoyable! I’m also happy that Paul, who happens to be Syrian American, could get a hit as big as this song in 1959. Nobody probably knew he was Middle Eastern, but I’ll take it!

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SOMEBODY SOMEBODY

**SRTviper** (6.3): 😢

**1998tweety** (6): This is ok, not a bad song but kind of hard to believe that it was the biggest of the summer that year.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): a 3 am mood

**peppersmith67** (6): these lyrics are a mood but I imagine only listening to this in a Golden Corral and that knocks it back a few points.

**SteelStepladder** (6): perfectly fine

**waluigiest** (6): it grooves but it also is kind of discomforting for some reason

**sbb618** (5.5): I am incredibly disappointed that this was not the Black Keys song.

**junobeekeeper** (5.2): I too want someone to love and someone to kiss :/

## my loneliness ain't killing me no more

**LeninaCrowne94** (5.2): Standard 50s music

**rslashpoopheads** (4): I'm sorry but 50s music was so, so boring

**twat\_brained** (4): You're about to get lonelier because I wouldn't dare enter a room with a vinyl collection that contains one of your records. Sorry to my grandma who loves Paul, for whatever reason

**vayyiqra** (4): no thanks

**williamdowley123** (4): sis same but you don't have to whine about it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): ugh im so tired of the sad boi aesthetic pop music has become so monotone !

**vapourlomo** (3): This sounds like a filler song from a D-list musical

**Leixander** (7.5): Very catchy even though I hated the memes of it.

**skargardin** (5): Our first 10s song takes the hit, and no-one batted an eye. This is in all regards a mediocre Drake song and I’m happy that most of you agreed on that point.

---


## these top 3 comments will get flewed out

**bespectacIed** (10): cue the City Girls "peer-yeet" compilation

**radiofan15** (9.7): Overplayed? Sure... but also a really good song saved by its Lil Wayne sample and, of course, City Girls... unfortunately I gotta substract some points because Nice For What deserved.

**1998tweety** (9): City Girls are queens, we stan.

## well...

**TragicKingdom1** (11): it was very close between this, The Boy Is Mine and Hot In Herre for my 11, but ultimately i went with this because i think it's the most complex song of all of them and feels the most summery to me. like, the other two are bops, but this just captures the humid melancholy of late summer so well on top of being a gigantic bop. i'm also just really enthralled by its structure, there's multiple choruses and only one real verse. i'm rambling because i'm trying to justify the fact that i'm the only 11 on a song that will most likely go out day 1

## nice for what deserved

**notdallin** (8.7): one of the most fascinating things about this song is the release. Maybe in another universe, “In My Feelings” remains a deepcut on the album and “Nice for What” or “I Like It” makes a run into summer 2018. But springboarded by Shiggy’s dance challenge less than a week after the song was released in the body of *Scorpion*, this song rose to number one really no thanks to Drake. Just the way that I like the random sprouting of my song of the summer--organically, by the people, in the form of a meme

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Nice For What deserved to be the summer hit instead of this

**sbb618** (8): I never really got why this song blew up over Nice For What. Maybe it's the Atlanta clip at the end.

**slimboyfriend** (7): A meme song if there ever was one. And for the record Nice For What>>>In My Feelings

**vapourlomo** (7): A weaker version of Nice For What, but damn is that chorus sticky

**hikkaru** (6): nice for what deserved this title instead

**junobeekeeper** (5.2): I always want to like Drake, but Scorpion was quite weak. Nice For What was catchy but we aren't rating that so… this song is ok.

**nick1372** (5): Nice For What was ROBBED

**CarlieScion** (5): im angry that this was the SOTS over nice for what. which would have been an easy 11

**peppersmith67** (5): I have no clue why we let this song be the song of the summer when Nice for What was on the same album.

## pure souls who heard it for the first time

**magikarpals** (7): i never heard this before actually. could be chill to listen to while driving

**waluigiest** (7): i was abroad when this was going viral and I’d never heard the song so I thought the In My Feelings challenge was about Lana Del Rey

**minibjork** (6): i have never heard this entire song before wooo

**J\_Toe** (5): first time I heard. First time I don't care for it. Make Me Feel or All For You should be here in this spot.

## we live in a post-meme society

**vayyiqra** (8): Okay, so this song is a meme. Drake himself is a living meme, in fact. This song has a bizarre structure, and the vocal sample is likewise bizarre. I really like the instrumental, and even Drake's lyrics, although I have no clue what "trap money penny" means. (I'm pretty white.) The only thing wrong with it is that it really falls off with that awful, chaotic breakdown two thirds of the way through it. There are much worse songs this list could've ended with, though.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): not a bad song, but i predict this getting bottom 5 just because it was the newest one and ppl don't like Drake.

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): To be honest, I enjoyed more of Drake’s singles from Scorpion than I would have ever expected to, but I’m not really sure how to feel about this one… it’s funny for the memes, yes, but as infectious as that hook is, I think this wallows too much in being average in everything else for it to truly be a masterpiece. It’s not even the best viral hip hop hit of this decade; one summer later, Lil Nas X rode by to say hello. All in all, this isn’t much more than a median for a summer song, but it’s still a fun one.

**AvatarKanol** (6): Inconsistent and boring. This is a song which relies on it's meme value to drive it to success. The best part of the song is shown off to the listener in the first 30 seconds, everything else after that is not worth listening to. I would like to repeat again that this is a meme song. Unlike One Dance this is NOT A MOOD and it won't be remembered that well.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone

**ryjomom** (6): It’s a song that I wouldn’t change the radio station on but I would not actively stream it.

**twat\_brained** (6): +2 points for Dua Lipa appearing in the video during the compilation bit. Other than that I have heard enough Drake in the past 4 years to last me 30 lifetimes. ENOUGH

**SteelStepladder** (4): I think we all collectively need a Drake break

**vhqv1997** (4): Not only was this song bad, but the meme that arose out of it is also bad, so really, what is there to write about?

**SRTviper** (3.5): If Drake was a drink, he would be an empty water bottle.

**LeninaCrowne94** (3): I had somehow managed to avoid this until now. Now I feel old for not "getting" this.

**MrSwearword** (1): Let me be Kiki real quick. NO DRAKE, GO FUCK YOURSELF

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I barely listened to the radio last summer, so I heard this maybe 3 times. But that was more than enough for me. The trap beat is boring, The chorus is so annoying to me, and the verses are kinds boring. The second half with the female voice mixed in also sounds super chaotic and not at all well put together.

notdallin: @the people wondering about the trap money penny thing: he's actually saying "TrapMoneyBenny" who is one of the producers of the song. Yeah I was disappointed too because in my head, the thought of Drake referring to this girl as trap's equivalent of James Bond's on again off again love interest that can never work despite the sexual tension was a really cool untold story especially if she's the Kiki he's genuinely coming to asking her if she loves him. But it's just a producer shout out. I am sad

## not MY song of the summer!

**twat\_brained** (6): who let this be song of the summer over It's Gonna Be Me? FOR SHAME.

**vapourlomo** (6): I'd rather listen to the Grammy-winning "Smooth" by Carlos Santana featuring Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty

**vhqv1997** (6): How were people in 2000 obsessed with such a forgettable song that it became the hit of the summer?

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): sucks that my birth year was so mediocre

**radiofan15** (4.5): This is not SMOOTH!!!!

## nostalgia

**1998tweety** (9.5): This bops pretty hard, we love rock.

**Chevsapher** (8.4): The singing is odd, but the songwriting is serviceable and the arrangement has some incredible moments.

**LuckyKidA** (8): early 00s nostalgia is a hell of a drug

**SteelStepladder** (8): I like this song a lot but it feels weird that this is the song of the summer

**vayyiqra** (8): Wtf I love this song. See, my mom was a Matchbox Twenty stan in the early 2000s. Yes, that was a thing, and she even had the minivan to go with it. So I have a lot of nostalgia for this song.

**peppersmith67** (7.7): It's kinda crazy how much Matchbox Twenty and Rob Thomas dominated the radio in the early 2000's and yet we only really remember them for the meme song with Santana.

**sbb618** (7): I wonder how many people today know Rob Thomas better for "Smooth" than for Matchbox Twenty

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Imagine being cursed to sound like Rob Thomas for twenty long years. You break up with your girlfriend because she cheated on you, you find out that she’s actually a witch, and then she makes your voice sound like Rob Thomas’s voice until you are forty. Now, I don’t want to bully Rob Thomas. I have no problem with his voice if it is inflicted upon himself. But consider how traumatic it would be to bear the full brunt of this curse, and to go around every day sounding like the guy from Smooth. Every time you raised your hand in class, you would sound like the lead singer of Matchbox 20. Every time you took out loans at the bank, you would sound like the guy who sang Her Diamonds. And when you propose to the love of your life, you’d have to fear that they’d leave you again for sounding like Rob Thomas as he sings a song as mediocre as Bent. Personally, I would rather cut off my throat.

**junobeekeeper** (6.9): The dissonance between Rob Thomas's appearance during this era and his singing voice is interesting.

**magikarpals** (6): who knew they'd put out a song other than unwell? although the concept is exactly the same so that's debatable

## unbowed, unbent, unbroken

**CarlieScion** (5): eh

**notdallin** (5): you know it’s a matchbox 20 song by the way they can somehow stretch the short E vowel into two syllables (CAN YOU HAY-ELP ME I’M BAY-ENT?)

**ImADudeDuh** (4): i thought this song was so good, but the nostalgian wore off i guess...........

**MrSwearword** (3): this isn't even a good Matchbox Twenty song let alone summery

**ryjomom** (3): if your gone is such a better song off that album

**waluigiest** (3): this is mediocre

**bespectacIed** (2): the 90s/early 2000s male rock sound gives me allergies and this song is the biggest face of it

**rslashpoopheads** (2): oh dearie me this is so boring

**SRTviper** (1): I miss the 90’s already.

## The Long, Cruel Summer

**radiofan15** (10): Almost an 11 for sure!

**bespectacIed** (9): This song is cute but my god, young Al Green is gorgeous as fuck

**slimboyfriend** (9): We gettin SAD this summer

**Chevsapher** (8.1): A great song with great vocals, but it quickly becomes monotonous.

**1998tweety** (8): This is really long but I didn't really mind it tbh

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Al Green? Ain’t that the guy who warned us about global warming? We should’ve listened to that fella! Okay, okay, enough of my corny jokes. This is good, even if it’s a bit strange that this is a Bee Gees cover, of all things; Green applies some ethnic soul to the song that makes this a great version, and even if it isn’t my favourite song in this rate, I would certainly not mind listening to this all over again.

**MrSwearword** (7): cute, but what kind of lowkey summer did music keep enjoying to have music to fuck to be a summer song...

**agentofscranton** (6.5): man the US was going through it the summer of '72 huh

**peppersmith67** (6.5): pretty ok ballad weird to hear the bee gees pre disco

**SteelStepladder** (6): pretty good but it really doesn't need to be six minutes

**sbb618** (6): Sounds like Red Hot Chili Peppers at the beginning

**waluigiest** (6): it’s like sweet but what kind of summer was this hello???

## i'm only gonna break break your- break break your heart

**AvatarKanol** (6): It's ok. La la la la la llalalallalalallaalaaaaa.

**jaztinax** (6): the verse is pretty forgettable but the chorus hits right in the soul for some reason.

**notdallin** (6): kind of snoozy

**twat\_brained** (6): wait did Rihanna sample this in LOTB? Genius says it's reminiscent, but not a direct sample. Which is good because Al is oversinging and it's really invalidating the sentiment he's meant to evoke. Also HOLY HELL, over 6 minutes long? Who had the time for this damn

**vayyiqra** (6): Okay but too long and goes nowhere

**ImADudeDuh** (5): my mom hates al green so i do too.

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): Kinda forgettable tbh and too long

**rslashpoopheads** (5): kings of appropriation

**SRTviper** (5): It's hard to believe that a song that moves as slow as this one was once the song of the summer. I's not for me but I still respect it.

**vhqv1997** (5): I gave this a 5 because the original version by The Bee Gees is so much better, no disrespect to Al Green but he doesn't capture the message of the song as well as the band

**junobeekeeper** (4): Something about their high voices ruins this for me.

**vapourlomo** (4): Let's Stay Together would've gotten a 10, but this is forgettable

**DrunkHurricane** (2): I probably wouldn't hate this so much if it didn't drag on and on

**hikkaru** (1): i'm sleeping

**ryjomom** (1): so many slow boring song from 70s summers

**skargardin** (7): The key changes are seriously cool but the vocals...a tragedy. I actually think this song is pretty cool but it’s understandable as to why most of you hated it.

**Leixander** (6): Optimistic of them to think humanity will live through 2525!

---

## take a ride to my old neighborhood

**magikarpals** (11): i'm sorry to be like this but this is just the wildest song to be song of the summer ever i can't believe this was just on the radio let alone so popular. but also it should be on the radio right now it is so relevant and representative of summer 2019. and when you think about it as background music to the peak of vietnam war protests and ofc the cold war it's so interesting as well. "he's taken everything this earth can give and he ain't put back nothing" god. support renewable energy

**ExtraEater** (10): Judgment day is actually in 2025

**AvatarKanol** (9.5): When this track started I really thought I would strongly dislike it. But in the span of a minute they god me bopping to the passing of time. It may be old but it still holds up in 2019. I can't believe I traveled through 10.000 years.

**nick1372** (9): OTR is clearly not the first meme song of the summer

**Chevsapher** (8.3): This song is all about the lyrics. The lyrics kept me interested. Thus, I like it.

**junobeekeeper** (7.8): This is real dramatic. Like… who took a song about the future and was like "let's be nihilistic" and then this was a hit.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (7.5): lmao I thought this song was a futurama original

**sbb618** (7.5): Fine, but I couldn't stop thinking of the Futurama parody.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I’ve read about this song before due to its unusual focus for a pop song, although this is the first time I’ve heard it. And, um, wow. What a hit. Todd in the Shadows should definitely cover this one if he hasn’t already. In The Year 2525 isn’t...great, either musically or lyrically, but it is an interesting listen, and it is a wonderful look into the fears of the future America experienced in a world where science fiction was debuting on television and fulfilling the prophecies it made in the past at the same time. Do you know this was at #1 during the Apollo Moon Landing? That’s a chilling fact.

**1998tweety** (7): Inch resting

**jaztinax** (7): damn why are the men this era so freaking dramatic? this song is a lowkey bop though. it has a melancholic vibe to it, it’s dramatic AND it’s upbeat? what more could you ask for?

**static\_int\_husp** (7): The only version of this song I recognize is the futurama version

**vayyiqra** (7): I have no idea what this is but I sort of like it

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.9): It's a bit campy, but it has a classic Doctor Who vibe which I can't help but love.

**radiofan15** (6.5): They got some things wrong in their future predicting abilities but I can't blame them... they're baby boomers after all.

**\_turbovicki\_** (6): that one Futurama episode

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Only 506 years away!

**rosesmp3** (6): i like how in this song the prospect of picking children out from the bottom of a test tube is less scary and worrying than people not having teeth or eyes

**vhqv1997** (6): Black Mirror in song form

## where are my damn flying cars and cities, jetsons?

**peppersmith67** (5): this is like a generic sci-fi version of madlibs.

**ryjomom** (5): unrealistic.

**SteelStepladder** (5): sounds like a cheap movie soundtrack but It's memorable I guess

**waluigiest** (5): this song walked so 7 Years could somehow be worse

**notdallin** (4.8): i just aged 7981 years and my wig is still securely on my head

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): Um??? Also, they didn’t earn that key change

**twat\_brained** (4): bold of you to assume everyone will even be alive by the end of the 2100s considering how much the planet is fucked up by humanity and we'll have to have mastered intergalactic travel

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I love spaghetti westerns

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): year 3000 outsold

**vapourlomo** (3): Assuming we're still going to be around that long lol

**agentofscranton** (1): nothing says summer like existentialist Christian rock

**ImADudeDuh** (1): "In the year 6565, Ain't gonna need no husband, won't need no wife" Zager & Evans said asexual rights! too bad this song is fucking trash

**MrSwearword** (1): I can't, this song is horrid

**williamdowley123** (1): ok grandpa

**Leixander** (6): ...okay?

**skargardin** (4): I’m sorry (both for this terrible, totally intended pun, and score), I did not like this at all.  It’s in one ear out the other, it makes me feel zero emotion whatsoever.

---

## rupologized

**Chevsapher** (8.8): Brenda's vocals are distinctively magnetic, and the lyrics are relatable without being trite.

**radiofan15** (8.5): Cute and refined, they don't make teen pop stars like these anymore...

**MrSwearword** (8): beautifully sung but summery? Not really although my Lana stanning should be kind to a bummer sounding song being considered summery.

**peppersmith67** (8): I'm such a sucker for classic American pop vocalists singing abut how depressed they are.

**rosesmp3** (8): wow spoken word queen

**waluigiest** (8): wtf kinda sad girl summer was this

**yourhostandpatron** (8): This is Brenda Lee? Interesting! Her voice sounds clearer and less raspy compared to Rockin Around The Christmas Tree. I’m looking at her Wikipedia now and she seems like a sweet little lady. And by sweet little lady, I mean *little*. She’s only about 4”11. I’m a full inch taller than that. I never expected to be listening to anybody shorter than me! Regardless of height, though, I’m Sorry is good. Brenda knows how to put emotions into her singing. I hope y’all will have enough taste not to be bored by this. Don’t break Brenda’s heart.

**junobeekeeper** (7.8): This song has appeared in so many commercials, movies, everything that I should be sick of it. And in many ways, I am a little bit sick of it. But despite everything, it's a very strong song with regards to performance and production.

**1998tweety** (7.5): A bop, we stan a queen of Xmas

**notdallin** (7.5): move over @taylorswift13, queen brenda is the still reigning royal of talk-singing in the bridge of her songs!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): The spoken word bridge……. Taylor Swift could NEVER

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I can't imagine this hasn't been overused in the context of 21st century as a song used in films set in the 60s of a woman slumped over on a couch with this playing in the background as she tries to get over her heartbreak. For what it's worth I definitely understand it

**LeninaCrowne94** (5.6): Simple but I like it. Wouldn't be considered a "summer smash" today though

**SRTviper** (5.5): This song Doo-Wops

## i don't want a lot for christmas

**rslashpoopheads** (5): this was not a summer for beach parties

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): bridgette from total drama did this song better

**vapourlomo** (5): I'm pretty sure this was in countless ads with cute kids spilling juice

**vhqv1997** (5): I'm sorry, so sorry, but this song is very boring

**CarlieScion** (4): why is the christmas song lady singing a non-christmas song??

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this is boring but we still stan her for Rockin Around the Christmas Tree

**TragicKingdom1** (4): rockin around the xmas tree >>

**vayyiqra** (4): my mind glossed over it

**jaztinax** (3): oh jesus the violins are playing in a really uncomfortable frequency. someone please remaster this.

**SteelStepladder** (3): I just... I don't care

**williamdowley123** (3): damn old people had that summertime sadness®

**ryjomom** (1.9): should have stuck to christmas songs sweetie

**skargardin** (5): I love that it becomes more bombastic in the middle parts but it just sizzles out in the sand afterwards and never recovers.

**Leixander** (4): Pretty bland and boring. The lyrics sound like afterthoughts that are written on top of this classic 50s/60s melody. You can see why people got bored of songs like this and moved on to rock & roll.

---

## sober ii (melodrama)

**magikarpals** (10): this song is actually so cute and so summery, like sitting at an iron wrought table on a cafe patio

**radiofan15** (10): I don't know what it has to do with Tijuana but it bops.

**notdallin** (9.6): guess who has two thumbs and is in love with yoouuuu??

**Chevsapher** (9.3): I love how theatrical this song is. The lush instrumental backing, retro trumpets, and backing vocals are my favorite elements.

**SRTviper** (9): So, melodramatic.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): The brass in this is super cool

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Be still my smooth jazz heart. Idk why I’m crying but it’s happening

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Another old ballad that makes way more of an emotional impact on me than some of the boring shit that’s to come next. Herb and his band makes for some dreamy, bittersweet getaways to a world of love and tears in this one, as the former croons while the latter carries him on with an excellent show of instruments. The sincerity and heartfelt desperation you feel here is genuine, and it’s something special; Herb sighing out ‘maybe I’ll just die’ is a special moment in particular. Very good, and not to be overlooked.

**MrSwearword** (8): it's too sweet for me to really read the shit out of it. I can appreciate that much from it.

**twat\_brained** (8): the appeal for this song makes sense to me, it's actually rather charming and suits an easy listening playlist. The whole death thing kind of prevents this from being a 10 though

**waluigiest** (8): okay but imagine falling in love the summer where they were playing this

**peppersmith67** (7.7): this songs a real grower shout out to my man herb

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.5): Found it bland at first but it grew on me

**1998tweety** (7): This is kind of nice

**sbb618** (7): Does this song sound vaguely like Lou Reed to anyone else?

**vhqv1997** (7): This is way too long, but I do have to give it to them, this sounds like a classic, and probably an inspiration for the soundtrack of La La Land

**junobeekeeper** (6.2): You get one shot at life and you're named Herb. Anyway the song is ok.

## it wasn't love

**vayyiqra** (6): Lush but not my thing

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I'm sorry but 60s music was so boring

**jaztinax** (4.5): “say you’re in love with this guy. if not i’ll just… dieeEEeE” whoa stay away from this guy y’all

**DrunkHurricane** (4): 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀

**AvatarKanol** (3): "If not I'll just die." Honestly I will take anything if it means that this song is going to end. Not romantic. Not cute. I'm good.

**CarlieScion** (3): very boring.

**williamdowley123** (3): boring

**SteelStepladder** (2): I've never heard this song before and after this rate I'm never going to hear it ever again

**ImADudeDuh** (1): http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/fJkTsWCMViRYA/giphy.gif

**Leixander** (4): This is NOT a summer song at all. Bye girl.

---

## seize the means of ballad production

**bespectacIed** (10): I still prefer The Communist Manifesto though

**vhqv1997** (10): THE song straight people use for their wedding dance

**Chevsapher** (8.7): I hate myself for enjoying this.

**1998tweety** (8.5): The chorus of this sounds similar to that of Change by Lana or is it just me? Both bops

**rslashpoopheads** (8): love a good unpower ballad

**notdallin** (7.8): [if Taylor REALLY wanted to make an album that sounded like 1989…](https://imgur.com/6scQ7Bn)

**nick1372** (7): it's pretty enough. idk how it got so popular tho

**ryjomom** (7): there sure are a lot of ballads during the summer

**ignitethephoenix** (6): snooze fest

**vayyiqra** (6): Richard Marx's flawed economic theories led to the deaths of at least 65 million innocent people worldwide. How can you stan something like this knowing that?

**yourhostandpatron** (6): Much like the Grammy Song of the Year that became a huge success story a year before this song was released, Somewhere Out There, Right Here Waiting  is a huge moment that foreshadows to the kind of sentimentality in music that would rule the airwaves of the decade to come...and while it might be nice and nostalgic to some of you, it sure doesn’t hold up as well to other folks. I don’t really have anything against Richard Marx, but even if there are some redeeming factors in Right Here Waiting, he fails to make the song interesting; a less bland take could be required to save this hit.

**LeninaCrowne94** (5.4): pretty corny but I can't help but like it

**CreepyMannequin** (5): This is my first time hearing this song outside of those mid-2000s commercials for love song compilation CDs.

## capitalism

**ImADudeDuh** (5): cute, but still prob gonna be one of the first 5 gone

**minibjork** (5): bad song to end the 80s with

**vapourlomo** (5): Really 1989?? Love Shack is sitting right there, and yet this is what y'all choose as the song of the summer? Smh

**CarlieScion** (4): this is. bad. so boring and slow..

**peppersmith67** (4): On the next episode of Beverly Hills 90210...

**slimboyfriend** (4): This song is so cheesy. I’m suddenly lactose intolerant

**twat\_brained** (4): wait this just came on shuffle but i realized it played before; that's how much of a milquetoast hair wannabe Michael Bolton song this trite is

**junobeekeeper** (3.1): Karl Marx >Richard Marx

**SteelStepladder** (3): and here we have our first of several extremely boring ballads to get through

**waluigiest** (3): AGAIN what the hell kind of sad summer were they having this is not what the 80s were for

**radiofan15** (2.4): Monica outsold for once.

**MrSwearword** (1): this is fucking awful

**SRTviper** (0): Soft Rock

**skargardin** (9): It’s kinda interesting how an almost purely instrumental and LIVE jazz recording was able to rule the summer in 1963 but it’s honestly not that surprising since it’s an absolute slapper. Hearing this song I want to be in the audience and groove to it as well. It deserved more in this rate tbh.

**Leixander** (4): This is indeed nice but I don't see the Song of The Summer potential here. Gets a bit too chaotic near the end, almost feeling like an impromptu performance from a talented street band.

---

**MrSwearword** (10): the track knocks, enough said

**\_turbovicki\_** (9): Any Stevie Wonder song gets at least a 7 by default

**bespectacIed** (9): I love Stevie but Beyoncé's version which she sang to him outsold

**Chevsapher** (9): How was this a song of the summer? It's so unconventional, but it's also brilliant.

**jaztinax** (9): oh my god, young stevie wonder (stevie wonder at any stage of life though) is EVERYTHING. so much life, soul and joy in this song. i love the fact that it's a live recording, and how it sounds like he's just goofing around and having fun while giving the audience life at the same time. l e g e n d.

**SteelStepladder** (9): This song slaps so fucking hard

**notdallin** (8.3): a live recording with a full horn band and mary-had-a-little-lamb harmonica solo would be like if “Before I Let Go” became song of the summer this year

**SRTviper** (8): I was not aware that young Stevie Wonder sounded like Janelle Monáe.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I sometimes forget Stevie Wonder was a child prodigy

**peppersmith67** (7.8): young Stevie Wonder adlibbing for 3 minutes still better than most careers tbh

**sbb618** (7.5): ...is that the Cupid Shuffle?

**1998tweety** (7): This is kind of fun especially near the end, GFriend outsold though

**J\_Toe** (7): I can imagine the harmonica(?) being sampled in a Moby or Fat Boy Slim song in the 90s.

**twat\_brained** (7): wait, Stevie was a prepubescent teen idol? damn, that's really impressive!

**waluigiest** (7): this is wild… this played on the radio?

**junobeekeeper** (6.7): He was, like, a baby! I feel so inadequate now. Thanks Stevie.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Is this even a song or is it just musical improv

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): It’s BARELY a song

**rslashpoopheads** (6): song is boring but the performance was lit

**vapourlomo** (6): Very impressive harmonica work, but Stevie's done so much better.

**yourhostandpatron** (6): Oof, I want to like this so bad, since Stevie Wonder getting a hit this young (and being young, black and disabled that) is a bit of an amazement, but even if he’s definitely showing how musically talented in this track, a live recording from the 60s is...not bound to sound as fun as it’s supposed to almost sixty years on, in my experience. Like, sure, I could see myself dancing to this at a birthday party in 1964, but in 2019? I’m just baffled by that harmonical version of Mary Had A Little Lamb. Sorry, Stevie, but this does show an impressive amount of energy, so I’ll give credit where credit’s due.

**AvatarKanol** (5): What is this even?

**williamdowley123** (5): wtf did i just listen to

**nick1372** (4): out of all the Stevie Wonder songs...

**LeninaCrowne94** (3.3): Cool moments, but there's too much going on

**vayyiqra** (3): awful

**ImADudeDuh** (2): what the fuck is happening

**radiofan15** (1.9): "what key? what key?"

**ryjomom** (1): I’m not really a jazz fan

**Leixander** (8.5): Definition of guilty-pleasure, combined with Sexy and I Know It, it completes the voltran of awkward party bops.

**skargardin** (1): If I could give this song a zero a well, I damn well would. LMFAO have NEVER and will never appeal to me, even less so after the horrendous follow-up single that we do NOT talk about. Thank god that they were left in 2012 where they belong. This song is not IT, who even is this Lauren Bennett girl?

---

## GET UP GET DOWN PUT YOUR HANDS UP TO THE SUN

**1998tweety** (10): Ok but this was actually an iconic song despite what anyone says now. Kind of wild that a member from G.R.L. had such a huge hit.

**ExtraEater** (10): The greatest song of all time

**hikkaru** (10): ICONIC bop and one of the trailblaizers in my personal favourite genre, vapid EDM-pop!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song still bops, especially now that it isn’t everywhere anymore. LMFAO really made a few massive hits then dipped at their peak. It’s kind of iconic.

**magikarpals** (10): stop! hating is bad! (everything about this song is good)

**radiofan15** (10): In this house we stan (and miss) LMFAO and we would have give their deserved 11 if Mariah wasn't in this rate too.

**sbb618** (10): Still as incredibly catchy as the day it was released. It was very, very hard to not give this my 11.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Now that enough time has passed from the era when LMFAO was big, I think we can all admit that this was a genuinely good dance hit.

**twat\_brained** (10): ………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………se tonight! A lot of y'all will complain about how horribly this aged but hearing this gave me a power rush of both dopamine and nostalgia, and it's getting a 10 from me as a result.

**vayyiqra** (10): I don't care what critics say, LMFAO were a great, talented band who made bops. It seems to have gone over everyone's heads that they were hipsters and everything they did was ironic and intentionally goofy. However, this song is just plain fun, and the video is classic.

**vhqv1997** (9): The world was simpler and more liveable back when this song was ruling the chart.

**Chevsapher** (8.8): What do the verses mean? Who's GoonRock? Why do I still like this song so much?

**vapourlomo** (8): The textbook definition of "so bad it's good"

**waluigiest** (8): party rockers in the hou se tonight....

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I remember once, I was in a middle school assembly and my class arrived first, so we just waited the whole time for all the other classes to arrive. Too keep us entertained, they had music playing, but it was only this song on a loop, so for a good week, i thought this song was like 11 minutes long.

**ryjomom** (7): dated but a middle school classic

**SRTviper** (7): This song may be dumb and vapid, but it is at least a fun summer song unlike some others.

**SteelStepladder** (7): This song is so of it's time it's kind of wonderful

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): I loved, then hated, now I like this song

## didn't shake that

**notdallin** (6.9): i remember coming back from a 2 year long trip i took from 2011-2013 where i was largely isolated from contemporary music and pop culture and this song came on in the club. I was dancing, y’know, about as well as a white guy can to LMFAO and then the “SHAKE THAT” pause came on. And everybody froze where they were. Except me. I was officially deceased by the time Redfoo said “Everyday I’m shufflin” 💀

**AvatarKanol** (6): Everything that The Black Eyed Peas did with I Gotta Feeling is replicated with this song. But this time way worse. LMFAO has been completely forgotten and it would be great if this song was too.

**LeninaCrowne94** (4.3): Nostalgia gives it a boost but the production dates it more accurately than radiocarbon dating could.

**junobeekeeper** (4.1): Isn't one of the guys in LMFAO the cousin of Rockwell?

## party poopers

**minibjork** (3): i rather not relive middle school memories thanks

**bespectacIed** (2): aged like milk

**slimboyfriend** (2): The devil will rise again

**J\_Toe** (1): I really do not understand what r/popheads is going on about when they talk about how well thing song aged, or how LMFOA is good, or how 2008-2012 was a good era for pop music...

**MrSwearword** (1): even if it gave Lauren Bennett her only taste of success, eww god no, get rid of this shit

**yourhostandpatron** (1): So, funny story. I had a P.E class I absolutely hated once where we had to learn how to dance with each other, and, holy fuck, I cannot tell you how much I hate dancing. It was torture, people. What made it worse was that my P.E teacher made us dance to Sorry For Party Rockin’. Because of this, an inner part of me refuses to have anything to do with LMFAO. And let me tell you, I cannot like this. I cannot like this even if I’m in the mood for a stupid, obnoxious song. Bad production and bad memories haunt me to my grave.

**CarlieScion** (0): i have no idea how this became a SONG OF THE SUMMER. the instrumental makes my ears bleed. the lyrics are nothing. i hate everything about it. yes, ik, its supposed to be a fun bop that means nothing. i dont care. it sounds bad and makes me want to go deaf.

**peppersmith67** (0): No. Just No. Stop it. Get some help.

**rslashpoopheads** (0): a well-deserved plunge into irrelevance

**williamdowley123** (0): what if i gotta feeling was bad

## they see me rollin...

**ImADudeDuh** (9): wait a minute.... Steve Winwood is white?????

**ryjomom** (9): i physical got up and danced to this song

**Chevsapher** (8.8): This definitely is not the style I song I normally enjoy, but the production is fun and the chorus is very tight. The brass is my favorite part.

**1998tweety** (8): This bops wow

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): repetitive bop

**nick1372** (7): a surprising amount of fun

**vayyiqra** (7): Steve Winwood is the keyboard player from the band Traffic. This is a random fact I know.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): PC Music isn’t that new or fresh outside of its production when you harken back to the days of rock and roll and all that inspired it; Roll With It, for example, sounds like a song Charli XCX could have wrote on coke if she didn’t like having fun with gay people and if she was actually a total fucking boomer. This is just a hook stretched out into a four and a half minute song as performed by a serviceable, but otherwise completely forgettable vocalist that nobody remembers; it isn’t too bad, and I would probably jive to it if it was the 80s and I owned a nice car and I was driving down the highway as it blasted out from the vehicle speakers, but, sadly, I wasn’t even alive by the time people  became nostalgic for them.

**twat\_brained** (6.5): this is a good song to roll on through jamming out to, but it's just a bit long I find

**CarlieScion** (6): this is mustang sally but not as good

## they hatin'

**peppersmith67** (5.5): Peter Gabriel is McDonalds and Steve Winwood is the food you have at home.

**MrSwearword** (5): too mediocre for outright derision

**waluigiest** (5): were people really jamming to this in the late 80s?

**radiofan15** (4.8): Ugh what a snoozefest.... i can't roll with it the same as Offset can vibe with queers.

**notdallin** (4.6): we’re gettin’ a li’l too close for comfort to music that sounds like my childhood

**junobeekeeper** (4.4): My uncle goes ham for "Stevie" Winwood. Too bad I don't!

**vapourlomo** (4): Man I forgot how rough the late '80s are

**minibjork** (3): this song really has the nerve to be over 5 minutes long

**SteelStepladder** (3): I'm just confused to why this was so big

**Leixander** (8.5): Finally some disco! The chorus is very Bee Gees, that shouldn't come across as a surprise since he is related with them.

**skargardin** (7): Actually a bop that was done surprisingly dirty?

---

**Chevsapher** (8.5): I always assumed this track was by the Bee Gees track. Surprise surprise. It's nothing special lyrically, but Barry's melodies are as strong as ever.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): elevator bop

**vayyiqra** (8): I will never get tired of this sound

**waluigiest** (8): this song feels like a dream :)

**radiofan15** (7.7): Cute little disco bop but kinda subdued for my taste.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is cute

**peppersmith67** (7.5): never heard of gibb before this and i'm diggin the groove.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): The lesser known brother of the Bee Gees actually had a tragic fate, but at least he had some success while it lasted. Apparently, Andy Gibb is the only person to have two summer hits back to back! Imagine Gibb dominating your summer during the Carter era. I’m not sure if that’s terrifying or amazing. About the song itself: to be honest, I would never call it a classic, but there’s some nice rhythm to this. I’m not sure if it’s supposed to be folk pop or disco, but, hey, it works decently enough!

**twat\_brained** (7.1): i'm sure this is a good song but Shadow Dancing already came on so I've forgotten it

**SteelStepladder** (7): I have a soft spot in my heart for this song but it's aged like milk

**notdallin** (6.7): https://imgur.com/a/zFA1i3o

**jaztinax** (6): i was going to say “bee gees was literally right there with all those white disco bops” but then I found out that andy is the younger brother of all the bee gees members and i was like whoa creds bro. that’s like, if frankie jonas got the song of the summer over jonas brothers.

**slimboyfriend** (6): The BeeGees, but not as good

**LeninaCrowne94** (5.5): classic 70s production

**vapourlomo** (5): This is just watered-down Bee Gees

**CarlieScion** (4): this dude had back to back songs of the summers. is he the drake of the 70s?

**minibjork** (3.5): "those lips of white" shout out to anemia

**MrSwearword** (3): this is nowhere near summery and it's subpar as hell.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i hate the gibbs

**SRTviper** (2): The Disco style of layering a bunch of the same high-pitched voice is really not ok.

**junobeekeeper** (1): I actually like disco but this is… not good. I think it's the voice really.

**skargardin** (6): Eh, Drake’s done vastly better things.

**Leixander** (3): Always found this very boring. The sample is nice but not used to its full potential. Cold take but, Hotline Bling >>>

---

## offered to dance with Drake themselves

**AvatarKanol** (10): This is a song that can be described in only one word. MOOD. Drake who undoubtedly dominated the decade did the same again with this song. Even if you are listening to this song for the first time you can't help but find it nostalgic for a time long gone. I love it for that. Everytime this song plays you can never resist it's power to make you move and dance. All of these factors make it a complete 10 for me.

**CarlieScion** (10): baby!!!! i like you sooooooooo.

**radiofan15** (10): King Drake wants one dance with her Queen Millie Bobby Brown and he should be able to get it after releasing such a bop about it!

**1998tweety** (9): This is kind of a huge bop and hes Canadian and hot so I need to give Drake a high score.

**bespectacIed** (9): the song that brought me to Spotify, after being so frustrated that I cannot access the biggest song at that time anywhere else

**minibjork** (9): the dancehall-influenced/"tropical house" pop trend gave us this song & i deeply appreciate it

**peppersmith67** (8.6): When he wasn't doing his dumb fake patois accent the dancehall direction Drake went in was reallllly fun.

**Chevsapher** (8.1): This track has grown on me, but it was so overplayed a few years ago that I have difficulty evaluating it objectively.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It’s okay but I’m just mostly annoyed that one of Drake’s laziest songs ended up being his most popular.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Lowkey, this aged pretty great? wild

**J\_Toe** (8): can you believe I didn't know who drake was until Hotline Bling? Also, this is one of the few Drake songs I would be happy to listen to.

**vapourlomo** (8): All of y'all are going to underrate this because you're sick of Drake but this is a good moody banger

**waluigiest** (7): baby i like ur smell

## rejected to dance

**twat\_brained** (7.4): it's fine but I wish Closer was the song of the summer that year instead of this

**notdallin** (6.6): i guess this song, with its monotype-corsiva-cover-art-on-a-word-doc, had to awkwardly sputter so *Scorpion’s* better bounce tracks could fly. [But Drake be like](https://imgur.com/BAnWjqm)

**vayyiqra** (6): I've never heard this song or the one before it on the list and I feel like I might be a bit out of touch with the youths. Either that, or I am a huge hipster. It's probably a bit of both.

**hikkaru** (5): so boring

**magikarpals** (5): i can't deal w that high pitched bit over the chorus at all

**nick1372** (5): The most Drake song ever, and I know that because I've heard it a million times and I have absolutely zero feelings about it

**vhqv1997** (5): This song is straight-up annoying, like a worse version of Take Care

**junobeekeeper** (4.5): Cheap Thrills by Sia outsold in my heart :-(

**SRTviper** (4.5): I was going to make a joke that vanilla was probably Drakes favorite flavor of ice cream my vanilla is actually pretty good. Drakes favorite flavor is probably milk.

**DrunkHurricane** (4): I still don't understand why people like this song

**yourhostandpatron** (4): This was at #1 for sixteen weeks in the United Kingdom, which means that it was almost as popular as Old Town Road was in America this year. It’s also strangely fitting; I, too, would have wanted to take a four month nap after checking out the results of Brexit. I’m not the type of person to cry whenever something that isn’t the most pure and traditional piece of pop dominates radio, but this is a very dull and boring song that doesn’t accomplish the purpose of dancehall. It marks a turning point for Drake in the sense that this is where he became monotonous and sluggish. Did the pedophilia start around this era, too?

**rslashpoopheads** (3): where's the hook?

**SteelStepladder** (3): Music is in a way better place now

**MrSwearword** (1): I'll sit this out, thanks

**skargardin** (9): I’m most likely in the minority on this, but I don’t mind this remix at all. One thing I love about Despacito is just how it actually defined the summer and DESERVES it title. A popcultural behemoth, whew.

**Leixander** (4): I like the original song, Justin has no place here.

---

## people who didn't mention justin bieber's remix

**1998tweety** (10): Kings, such a shame that OTR broke Despacito's record. A tragedy

**ExtraEater** (10): The song of every summer

**jaztinax** (10): I NEVER GOT TIRED OF DESPACITO I KNOW I’M WEIRD SUE ME

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Severely overplayed but I understand why it was a hit and I like it in small doses.

**notdallin** (8.5): [Never.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj_emVFPgJ8) [Forget.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e4NWnCsrl8) [The Phenomenon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQxs7x8zx_I)

**SRTviper** (7): It’s hard not to resent a song after hearing it so many times involuntarily, but this song is still pretty fun.

**SteelStepladder** (7): What can I say, I still kind of like it

**junobeekeeper** (6.4): I like this song more than I did initially. It's certainly summery.

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): Memes aside, it is catchy.

**J\_Toe** (6): Alaska Thunderfuck's version (Valentina) is better

**CarlieScion** (5): i literally have no feelings about this

**ryjomom** (5): so sad F

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (5): Ha Ha Ha OSD still has it's title (for now)

**vapourlomo** (5): Hopefully, by this point, Lil Nas X has already broken this song's chart record

**peppersmith67** (1): more like Despaci-no am I right hahahahahahahaohfeuohfwebflqwhbefqweffbffbdnfhf

## i envy you

**rslashpoopheads** (7): people will think I'm clowning but this is the first time I've actually listened to this p.s. stream ai se eu te pego

## original is better [99]

**\_turbovicki\_** (10): Bieber adds nothing to the song, so I usually listen to the original. But, he doesn't actively make it worse

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I would normally never give the remix version a 10 cause Justin Bieber is TRASH and WHITEWASHES this song, but I know people are gonna give it a low score already, so I'll save it.

**radiofan15** (10): Say what you want about the Biebz but he did a fine job here, even if Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee outsold him big time.

**DrunkHurricane** (9): the original would be a 10

**Chevsapher** (8.8): I hated this song in 2017, but after not hearing it for a while, I actually like it. I could do without the Bieber feature, though.

**vhqv1997** (8): The remix is worse than the original, but I've got to give it to Justin for helping this song and latinpop in general become more popular

**twat\_brained** (7.8): this is so sad. Luis Fonsi's record label decided to tack on Justin Bieber's whiny voice onto an otherwise pleasant Latin jam with incredibly suave and sultry lyrics from Luis. Even then, the song is somewhat undone with Daddy Yankee's verse, which just sounds shouty and unnecessary.

**hikkaru** (7.5): original is better

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Okay, even I made the mistake about being salty over Despacito briefly tying the record for most weeks at #1 because of being a blind Mariah stan (I am still a blind Mariah stan, the main difference being that I know how to feel my way around now) but even if I would highly enjoy the possibility of Justin Bieber dropping off the face of the Earth, and even if his presence takes away from the enjoyment of the song; this is a deserving song of the summer thanks to be as catchy as shit. It’s a rare moment of being upbeat and happy post-2016, and we can enjoy it more now that it’s not as inescapable.

**bespectacIed** (6): If this were the original, I'd give it a 10

**AvatarKanol** (5): One of the biggest hits of the decade is a song that can't be easily forgotten. But this remix, like the other terrible songs on this list is better off being left forgotten. Everything that was amazing about the original song disappeares in this shameless attempt to add Justin Bieber to a #1 hit. In the end it is not surprising that he doesn't fit into the song at all. His voice is completely out of place. Usually this would be a 10 but I give this remix a 5.

**magikarpals** (5): the original is so much better!!

**nick1372** (5): Two years later and I'm still sick of this. Would be fine if Bieber wasn't so bad at singing in Spanish

**static\_int\_husp** (4.5): Honestly, Despacito is a decent (not really good, but decent) song. But Justin Bieber's singing is so bad in it. His voice in the first voice sounds sooo sooo strained.

**waluigiest** (4): justin bieber should have never touched this what the fuxk

**MrSwearword** (1): trash...but enough about Bieber and on to the song itself. BASURA.

**JunkyGS** (0): Fuck Justin Bieber. It is honestly as simple as that.

**slimboyfriend** (0): I’m giving this song over any other a 0 and let me tell you why. I worked at Target in college and this song was on Target’s in-store playlist, so I would hear it EVERY SINGLE DAY in addition to hearing it on the internet and at parties and bars because all the rich white people I went to school with were so proud of themselves for knowing a song in Spanish that wasn’t Gasolina. And also this song isn’t even good.

**vayyiqra** (0): [ha ha obligatory "this is so sad" joke] but really, I absolutely hate Latin pop so this is getting savaged by me. Worthless genre. I avoided this song as much as I could at its peak.

**skargardin** (9): The gloomy, emotional tunes continue and to be honest, I’m getting pretty overwhelmed listening to them.

**Leixander** (3): Nothing really stands out for me here sadly.

---

## always cried into her pillow, under pin-ups on the wall

**ExtraEater** (10): This song fills up my senses

**junobeekeeper** (10): I do love beautiful guitar and John Denver's voice so this is exactly what I like.

**rosesmp3** (10): this song is so beautiful it almost makes me forget i'm going to die alone!

**Chevsapher** (9.6): My mom overplayed John Denver's hits when I was growing up, soI never appreciated it until I was an adult. The vivid lyrical imagery and lush arrangement combine to form an exceptional song.

**peppersmith67** (9): expected to get some yeehaw oldie but nope this is a really simple beautifully made tender love ballad. Just a warm blanket of a song really.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I've heard this song before but did not know it was by American Treasure John Denver.

**vhqv1997** (9): John Denver's music is always so uplifting yet so heartbreaking at the same time. The first time I heard Leaving on a Jet Plane, I was quite emotional, but this song may just take the cake

**magikarpals** (8): this is a really nice church song and if i heard it at a funeral i would cry

**twat\_brained** (8): this is very sweet, it's nice to see songs like these nab song of the summer honors every once in awhile

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.8): reminds me why I love seventies music

**1998tweety** (7.5): This was cute

**agentofscranton** (7): this shit's beautiful man

**rslashpoopheads** (7): John Denver is a sweetheart

**sbb618** (7): Nice enough, I guess

**vayyiqra** (7): Kind of wimpy but I like it

**radiofan15** (6.5): The fact that I kinda liked and yet I have nothing to say about it speaks volumes about how relatively good yet forgettable it is.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I’m glad this woman’s doing so much for him because this song didn’t do much for me

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Wait, you’re telling me that John Denver has hits other than Take Me Home, Country Roads? Woah, you’ve gotta be kidding me. I don’t mind this very much, but I feel a bit...underwhelmed by it. I feel as if the melody behind this song should make it into a folk ballad with lush instrumentation and some sort of Celtic influence surrounding it, not some sort of underdone pop ballad that John Denver of all people is belting out. I still find Annie’s Song to be fairly pleasant, but it could have much more of a stronger backbone.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): cute but Annie the musical outpeaked

## zzz

**AvatarKanol** (5): Boring.

**MrSwearword** (5): eh, it's just very soft rock and just...not something I want to listen to again.

**ryjomom** (5): Country Roads Take Me Home to a different song

**SteelStepladder** (4): Another one of those songs that I just don't care about but it's pleasant enough I guess

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): what the fuck is a sleepy blue ocean? bitch i'll kill you

**waluigiest** (4): romantic but yawn

**SRTviper** (3.9): Oh no. I hope we aren’t entering an era of adult contemporary topping the charts.

**vapourlomo** (3): Wait is Annie the "mountain mama"

## couldn't really find a tag for this so, stream Missing U by Robyn

**agentofscranton** (10): The Police out here trying to get another shot at the crown by being a different song - kings of strategy

**bespectacIed** (10): Yep this is THE best interpolation/sample/whatever you call it of all time. RIP biggie, rest assured you have inspired so many big and amazing artists in hip-hop and rap, like halsey

**MrSwearword** (10): OH LOOK, using Sting production and proving Sting was the problem...AND using it for a moving tribute to Notorious B.I.G.

**radiofan15** (10): Of the two versions of this song included on this rate, this is definitely the better one, sorry Sting... but also PAUL WALKER > BIGGIE SMALLS.

**1998tweety** (9): Is it just me or does the guitar in the background also have the same beat as Titanium? Why are there 2 songs in this rate that sound like Titanium?

**Chevsapher** (8.6): Not as good as the song it samples, but the lyrics are thoughtful and Faith's vocals are enjoyable.

**peppersmith67** (8.1): Last time I checked Sting didn't develop the Ciroc brand for 50% of all profits and Diddy didn't write about stalking his ex wife so imma give Diddy the dub here.

**magikarpals** (8): improving on a past song of the summer, what we like to see

**minibjork** (8): the every breath you take but less-creepy concept is god-like

**slimboyfriend** (8): Between the original Police song and this one, the chorus is THE melody of the summer

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Amazing that The Police got this fucking song to be SotS twice. Though this version feels a lot better, lyrically.

**waluigiest** (8): iconic sample

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I think that it’s just so...awkward that I’ll Be Missing You is a tribute to one of the biggest rappers of all time. There’s nothing unpleasant about it, and I don’t find it a bad song to listen to on its own, but I think we’ve all mulled to ourselves that Biggie could have gotten a farewell address that was more...poigant than what I’ll Be Missing You ended up becoming. I don’t want to call it corny, because the people who made this are the people who actually knew the deceased (or maybe they weren’t, apparently Diddy’s verse is ghostwritten) but putting into context is really the only thing that seperates this from being too much of a mess. At the very least, it’s better than the drudge that was See You Again.

**junobeekeeper** (7.3): This song is bizarre to me. Somebody was like "let's make Every Breath You Take" about death and like. It kinda works???

**AvatarKanol** (7): A new version of the already existing hit. But with lesser quality

**LuckyKidA** (7): this sounds familiar

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (7): I've liked it more as time's gone on

**vayyiqra** (7): It's sappy but kind of touching, in a weird way, considering it was built around a really odd sample of a pop song about a stalker.

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.5): Could've relied less on the sample but it's ok

**notdallin** (6.1): i can’t take this song seriously i’m so sorry biggie

**jaztinax** (6): ugh not this song again. rating this higher because they made it not creepy.

**napsandnetflix** (6): this just makes me want to listen to the police

**nick1372** (6): I'd rather be listening to Every Breath You Take

**\_turbovicki\_** (5): I remember everyone dunking on this song at the time, but it's not as bad as I remember

**CarlieScion** (5): every breath you take part 2

**J\_Toe** (5): does this sample Police? That song I listened to a few minutes ago?

**rslashpoopheads** (5): iconic but also so boring

**SteelStepladder** (5): heartfelt but awkward

**vapourlomo** (5): Biggie deserved better than this awkward Police sampling.

**twat\_brained** (3): I was really feeling this song until I couldn't unhear the "SHHH" noise during the hook and then it just ruined the momentum for me. bad sample turned into bad mixing. LEAVE STING IN THE 80S FFS

**ryjomom** (2): I love the original sample

**ignitethephoenix** (0): They really sampled every breathe you take on here huh. Not even sampled just literally took the chorus and created new lyrics. And this was supposed to be a tribute song to Biggie too? Honestly one of the worse tribute songs I’ve heard.

**sbb618** (0): I don't have some magical insight into how Diddy and/or Faith Evans felt after Biggie died, but I'm pretty sure this song isn't it. This song takes an instantly recognizable megahit and basically changes nothing, only adding on Diddy doing a couple mumbled verses (that he didn't even write!) about the untimely death of his friend and colleague, the Notorious B.I.G., and that's not meant as a compliment. It comes off as a tacky, insincere, dashed-off cash grab. Are you looking for a rap ballad about the death of a friend? Go listen to Run the Jewels' "Thursday in the Danger Room". Don't listen to this shit.

**vhqv1997** (0): People in the 90s really had terrible taste if this stupid meaningless version of the original song was really played enough to turn into song of the summer.

**skargardin** (8): Well damn, old songs of the summer really basked in the gloom.

**Leixander** (7): why were you so moody 70s??

---

## Long, Cruel Summer - Pt. II

**magikarpals** (10): for those melancholic summer days. i listened to it twice

**radiofan15** (9.7): Nina Simone's version snapped, as usual, but we still stan a song that changed the laws of sampling forever!

**Chevsapher** (9.6): Wait, how have I not heard this? The songwriting and the moody atmosphere are incredible.

**bespectacIed** (9): I came here for a summer bops rate, not a fucking reality check???

**notdallin** (8.7): for those lonely, hot, sticky summer nights where you just need a cold drink and to watch a ghibli movie

**peppersmith67** (8.5): I want to jump off a building because my wife left me and my parents are dead. Happy Summer of 1972! - Gilbert O'Sullivan

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Can I confess something? Alone Again (Naturally) is an actual masterpiece of a song and I should probably love it instead of greatly admiring it, but the way it’s performed feels slightly too...kitschy to me? I know that label is going to feel horrifying to people and I should stress that all my thoughts are perfectly invalid, but I always have the feeling that I’d like this more if it had better instruments and more updated production. There’s still a lot in here for me to appreciate, though. Alone Again (Naturally) has just the perfect lyrics to make itself ooze with sadness without losing credibility, something that’s a very powerful state for a work of art to hold. It’s amazing, and I wish I could connect with it better.

**AvatarKanol** (8): A classic. Only this time it's better.

**minibjork** (8): okay i love this song but in what universe allowed this to be the song of the summer. how sad were people in 1972

**vayyiqra** (8): It's kind of a meme but it's deep okay :pensive:

**vhqv1997** (8): "To think that only yesterday, I was cheerful, bright and gay" me before every trip back to my homophobic hometown

**twat\_brained** (7.6): i like the sound but who wants to hear a song like this during summertime? Makes no sense to me

**1998tweety** (7.5): We stan a gay icon

**jaztinax** (7.5): i love the melody. I’m used to listening to diana krall & michael buble’s version of it which is slower and more stripped down, so it showcases the melancholy in the melody more than the original does. highly recommended if you like this song.

**sbb618** (7.5): I had this higher originally, before thinking to myself how little I actually wanted to hear it.

**\_turbovicki\_** (7): First time ever hearing this song - This is cheesy as all hell, and will be eliminated the first day. But, it's kinda sweet. idk. I think I like it

**J\_Toe** (7): the violins and guitar is beautiful.

## all the glamour, and the trauma, and the fuckin' melodrama, WOAH - Pt. II

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why is this so emo

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is melodramatic af, but has so many relatable moments, "To think that only yesterday/I was cheerful, bright and gay," "I promised myself to treat myself/And visit a nearby tower/And climbing to the top/Will throw myself off" & "I cried and cried all day" whew

**junobeekeeper** (5): Literally unremarkable. I get it though! I'm alone too.

**MrSwearword** (5): OK the soft rock summer binges are getting on my nerves now, but aside from that the song is boring

**rslashpoopheads** (5): "what floor" "34 please" hits every button

**slimboyfriend** (5): This song is unremarkable but I love the parenthetical use in the title

**waluigiest** (5): lacks character and energy

**LuckyKidA** (4): thought this was gonna be Alone Again Or and got excited

**SteelStepladder** (4): I'll never forgive you for screwing over Biz Markie

**agentofscranton** (3): stealing this song title for my autobiography

**ryjomom** (3): this what the hippies were listening to?

## this is how you remind me

**radiofan15** (3.6): This is not NICKELBACK!!!!!

**CarlieScion** (3): nickelback outsold

## may not be a summer song but it bops

**ImADudeDuh** (10): sex icon t b h

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bop

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I kinda wish it wasn't just the chorus for the entire back half of the song but this is classic Usher and will be remembered as one of the all-time R&B hits.

**Chevsapher** (8.2): It's not my favorite Usher song, but the ad-libs and the bridge are excellent.

**MrSwearword** (8): I don't think summer with this song. I think "classic R&B with some pop flavorings"

**waluigiest** (8): god this style of RnB is so nostalgic for me,,,, I cry

**yourhostandpatron** (8): This is precisely the type of RnB that all my classmates who had toxic masculinity issues tended to listen to, but thankfully for my classmates, some of the stuff they happened to stumble upon was, by miracles of miracles, actually good. I’m not saying that U Remind Me is a masterpiece to anybody other than shady men, but Usher does good work over that backing percussion; it’s a little sleezy, but he gets the job done pretty well.

**SteelStepladder** (7): This song is so breezy. I like it!

## kind of forgot about it

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I’m more of a middle period Usher kind of boy

**jaztinax** (6): I love early 2000’s usher but for some reason this song never sticks

**sbb618** (6): This sounds like a single that a boy band from a TV show would release

**The\_Skinniest\_Legend** (6): It's alright

**vayyiqra** (6): While the instrumental melody is catchy, this song is really repetitive and boring. I never liked it.

**notdallin** (5.6): *listen*. u can just say you’re not interested

**junobeekeeper** (5.4): not unremarkable. I do love Usher as a vocalist. I was also scared this was the Nickelback song.

**rslashpoopheads** (2): oh my lord this is so boring

**ryjomom** (1): ushers voice and lyrics just clash

**skargardin** (8): Yall really did Andy Gibb dirty, huh? Not that this is a terribly bad placement but I would’ve expected it to make the higher half of the rate at the very least.

---

## Probably dances well in a disco

**vayyiqra** (10): This slaps, what a classic. I have a lot of nostalgia for the Bee Gees. They remind me of being a kid, before my father left us and we were still a whole family. :pensive:

**vhqv1997** (10): I need some disco in my life and thank you for introducing this song to me

**CarlieScion** (9): sweet sensation!!! living in your love!!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (9): back to back songs of the summer when will your faves

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Folks, I think we have a masterpiece here. I’m not exaggerating. I mean, sure, this is disco performed by a white, straight man who is not a member of the Bee Gees (he is related to them, though), which means that Shadow Dancing is, essentially, a very gentrified song, but Informer by Snow was gentrified, too, and it was a bop; this isn’t as catchy as Informer, although it does come close thanks to that sleek beat, but it’s a perfectly crafted hit that you can just imagine the choreography to, which makes it perfect for disco.

**Chevsapher** (8.9): I like this song more every time I hear it. The killer hook and suave bass guitar make this the superior Andy Gibb song in the rate.

**peppersmith67** (8.3): I don't think this Gibb guy can sing much but BOY can he boogie.

**twat\_brained** (8.2): I remember remarking in the Year-End #1s rate how Stayin' Alive should be in its place. I realize now that this holds up rather well in its own right

**AvatarKanol** (8): Looks like mr. Andy Gibb snapped on this one.

**waluigiest** (8): honestly a funky dream he really nailed this

**1998tweety** (7.5): Bop

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Andy Gibb really had back to back summer hits. We stan.

**MrSwearword** (7): production is nice but dear god there's little reason for me to give a shit about this song

**notdallin** (6.8): https://imgur.com/jDXqe70

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): groovy

**slimboyfriend** (6): The song is fine, it just needs more lead falsetto

**SteelStepladder** (6): Perfectly acceptable

## sits and drinks instead

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Amazing that this dude got two back to back SotS entries, but they're both incredibly boring disco songs

**radiofan15** (6.2): Kinda funny to listen to but it lacks some energy to truly push it ''there''... also it goes on for like an eternity!

**jaztinax** (5.5): this doesn’t sound that different from the previous. and my bee gees comment aside, isn’t disco originally black? where is the funk, the soul, the real disco at?

**nick1372** (5): who let boring white boy #64 get two songs of the summer in a row

**SRTviper** (5): Better than I Just Want To Be Your Everything because of how funky it is. Still not great though.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): what is this bargain bin staying alive

**junobeekeeper** (1): Like I could say something about how disco hatred is often racially motivated/from a place of homophobia but then I hear stuff like this and I understand why some people wanted it to end. Listen to Chic or Sylvester or fucking ABBA…

**ImADudeDuh** (0): i hate the gibbs
