Before we get down to it, [let's take a moment to appreciate the song that in a perfect world would've ruled the charts this summer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaCrQL_8eMY)

Welcome to the ~~rate where we'll reawaken your dormant Despacito nightmares~~ Billboard's Songs of the Summer rate! I'm so excited to host this rate alongside my lovely co-host u/Leixander, in what is sure to be a scorching hot mess. Think about it, in what other rate would you get the chance to rate Macarena, Despacito and Baby Got Back against each other? And that's just to name a few of the 61 iconic songs included in this rate.

Ever since 1958, Billboard has annually hosted the official song of the summer chart, which follows and ranks the song's performances on the Hot 100 from Memorial Day until Labor Day, and we will be rating every single song that has been crowned with this coveted title. The song of the summer is no doubt an iconic event in music, with speculation starting months in advance of who is going to ~~plague our ears~~ come out on top of the heatstroke season. Whether you're feeling summertime sadness or cool for the summer, we guarantee you that there's something for every taste in this rate.

**THE RULES**

- **Listen to each and every song and assign it a score from 1-10. YOUR SCORES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED WITH ANY BLANK SCORES**

- You may assign decimal scores up to **one decimal**, 8.2 is fine, 8.34 is not.

- You may give **ONE** song an 11 score and **ONE** song a 0 score. These scores should be reserved for your least and most favorite songs, but they're optional to hand out. You are however required to leave a comment on these scores to explain why it made you feel summertime magic or why it's a summer bummer.

- Leaving comments on tracks are encouraged but not required, we want to hear all of your funniest and/or serious takes on these iconic and classic songs! To do so, leave a space after your score and write your comment:

> Despacito Remix: 5 Should've been Slide smh

**This is the only valid format for leaving comments!**

These are wrong:

> Papa Don't Preach: Madame X is a preacher 6.9

> Cheerleader: 10: King of trop-pop snapped, Kygo who?

> We Belong Together 1 Kidz Bop outsold

**And most importantly,**

- **Use [the pre-formatted message that we've linked to several times in this post](https://bit.ly/30a3tzI) to send in your scores, any other formatting will mess up the program we use to run the ballots through. I cannot stress enough how important this is!**

That's pretty much it! Remember to stay hydrated and stream Juice this summer, we're so excited to see your ballots! And feel free to message either me, u/skargardin or u/Leixander with any queries regarding your scores or other questions that you may have!

Once again, the links you will be needing:
