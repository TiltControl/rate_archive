MrSwearword: I'm just gonna make a prediction right quick. Naturally might come from behind and win the main rate giving Selena Gomez her first rate win unless See You Again gives Miley win #2.

Bonus rate, it's between Best of Both Worlds and Potential Breakup Song with maybe the latter winning due to the stans for that one are still salty after that messy Disney rate from a little while back.

**followingfreeways** (6): this song irrationally irritates me
 
---
 
#Infinity War is the biggest crossover of all ti-
 
**deannoying** (11): (JEMI!!!) Okay, I was REALLY conflicted between giving either On the Line or Don't Forget my 11, but I decided to go with OTL because Jemi's vocals just mesh together so well. I also think the concept of the song is interesting, given how it's about a breakup over the phone. OTL is an underrated Demi and Jonas Brothers collab, imo... Dissertation over.
 
**laneloveslipstick** (11): !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
**1998tweety** (10): This should win since 2 of the participating artists are in it.
 
**pillsxpotions** (10): period
 
**selegend** (10): just beautiful ahhh
 
**jlim201** (9.5): It feels super cheesy and like it would fit in a Disney movie more than any other song in this rate.
 
**extrasmallbillie** (9): the greatest crossover even of a generation.
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (9): this was really good omg
 
**waluigiest** (9): queen of mixed meter and strong breakup songs
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): A rate crossover?!! The avengers are shook.
 
**ggodisawomann** (8): this feature is lmao
 
#Camp Rock sweetie...
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): Oh, wow, it’s evidently time for Camp Rock again. Can you hear the High School Musical influence on this one, people? Because I sure can. This ambitious crossover event (suck it, Marvel) is a painfully obvious opportunity taken by Disney to bring two different fanbases together, and it’s delightfully cheesy, but, thankfully, it’s not exactly...tragical (I forgot that was a word), although the jury’s still up about how magical it is. Maybe this wouldn’t be a good argument for how rewarding Demi’s music can be, but it sure is a nostalgic throwback that’s sure to capture your attention and retain it all throughout.
 
**akanewasright** (6.9): A little awkward, honestly.
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (6.3): what a wild song
 
**radiofan15** (6.2): What a way to kill the mood that many consecutive rock bangers struggled to make.
 
**nightjesus** (6): I mean, This is Me exists.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): lowkey disappointing
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5): is tragical even a word?
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): tbh not my fave duet by them

**NotWith10000Men** (8): the backstory to this one is really inspiring
 
**rosecoloreds** (7.5): literally thought nick was dying of diabetes....
 
#FUCK BALLADS
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): I like how the Jonas Brothers tried to close their album with a title track, so in hindsight it’s a real shame that A Little Bit Longer isn’t as memorable of a ballad as it really should be. It’s still good for what it is, and I still enjoy it as a fitting end to its parent record, but this isn’t even as good of a crooner as Sorry was a few minutes earlier, and the only thing it really ends up doing is showing you that even if A Little Bit Longer is fun, it’s not exactly a shining example of the art of album making in Hollywood Studios. And to be honest, I think I’d have enjoyed an ending that wasn’t as slow as this much better.
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): inoffensive
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (3): if someone told me that Joe started DNCE because he was sick of being forced to sing power ballads and wanted to make fun music instead, I would believe that
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (1): ballads die. this isn’t even a good ballad.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok WOW a mfing BOP
 
**selegend** (10): one of their best!
 
**radiofan15** (9.6): A bop and a half… this is as catchy as herpes!
 
**nightjesus** (9): Bloody iconic jam. Listened the shit outta this in 2009.
 
**sleepypeach-** (8.5): the little breakdown at the end of this song saved my life.
 
**1998tweety** (8): Bop, the bridge is kind of odd but I like it
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): I really like the guitar in this one
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): Tonight is faster and maybe even harder-hitting Lovebug was, making it a welcome to return to what A Little Bit Longer is about, and the song being another hymn to a breakup is a great clash against its predecessor. But even if Tonight is catchy and enjoyable, it’s not exactly remarkable; it blends in with much of A Little Bit Longer, again, and it’s by no means the most exciting song on the entire album. It’s fun, but it’s not much more than average.
 
#Tonight we sleep
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): the vocals get a bit too whiny in this for me to rate it higher tbh
 
**waluigiest** (6): too whiny and uninspired but honestly not bad

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): This is Hannah's best song and i'll fight everyone who disagrees
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): Oh, wow. Not counting Best of Both Worlds, this is easily one of the best Hannah Montanna tracks I’ve ever heard. In fact, I’m not going to lie: this might pretty much be one of my favourite Miley tracks I’ve ever heard. This just has a kind of magic to it that you wouldn’t expect Miley of all people to fulfill during her child star days, and in a way this could be said to be a sign of what’s to come for her future bops like Party In The U.S.A.
 
**deannoying** (8): Not my favorite Hannah Montana song, but still a bop

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): so close to a 10 but something about the chorus….
 
**1998tweety** (9): This has a nice edge on it, hopefully more of the album sounds like this. Sounds like the start of her ASMR whisper queen career as well.
 
**nightjesus** (9): I used to dedicate this song to the people I didn’t like. It’s an underrated bop.
 
**mirandacrocsgrove** (8): a great song, but definitely not the strongest choice for a debut single
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): damn i forgot about this banger i have sinned
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Hey, I remember Falling Down from our old rate! This is one of the songs off Kiss and Tell that I’d call consistently great, in my opinion. Sure, it’s not an amazing single, but there’s way more personality to Selena’s performance here than I usually hope for in practically all of her music. The way she says ‘It won’t be long, my darling’ and just sasses the song’s target out is pretty majestic, even if her vocals leave a lot to be desired. Falling Down is actually fun, and that’s what makes it pass the test of what a good Disney song should try to be in order to stand the test of time.
 
#Theres a reason no one remembers it...
 
**radiofan15** (7.5): Is this a Gwen Stefani-reject‽ I swear she sounds like her!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): omg i don't even like the singles that much yikes
 
**selegend** (7): i’ve warmed up to it, still prob my least fav selena single though
 
**sleepypeach-** (7): peak disney vibes, but it still bops
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (6.8): eh a bit too sappy in the chorus for me
 
**akanewasright** (6): Why does the opening sound like U + Ur Hand?
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (6): “you gave me roses but they’re all just made of plastic” iconic
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (5): oh wow. jarring is the name of the game. selena youre gonna make me have a heart attack.
 
**jlim201** (5): Not a fan of the lyrics.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Fun Fact, this was the only non album single that ever broke through to the Top Ten. And listening to it I can see why, Out of all the deep cuts out of this rate i'd argue that this is the best one. Sad it didn't end up keeping its number ten spot but it absolutely deserves it's place with the high ranking singles
 
---
 
#Demi should've been in the Augties Rate
 
**yourhostandpatron** (11): If I’d have to submit exactly one song that describes why Demi has the best album in this rate so far, Trainwreck is going to be my go-to argument. I’m astounded that Demi wrote this at such a young age; it’s not amazing poetry along the likes of, say, Taylor Swift or Lorde, but you can see clear artistic vision and maturity here that’s surprising to find from a Hollywood Records debut. I can easily digest this song as the rock anthem as it was intended to be, but I can also see it as a wonderful piano ballad; the sincerity of it all makes it so easy for me to love Trainwreck, and it makes me really impressed at Demi’s skill.
 
**gannade** (10): this is so gooood
 
**hikkaru** (10): this song is so :comfy:
 
**Johnnytoby** (10): OMG I haven't heard this in years I was taken thereeeee I was such an emo girl wow
 
**nightjesus** (10): I freaking love this song omg. The guitars and her vocals are amazing. The lyrics are still super relatable as a gal in her mid 20’s. UGH JUST ICONIC. It needs more love. Justice for Trainwreck.
 
**waluigiest** (10): woah she really made this album when she was 16 wtf?? This is mature and beautifully composed
 
**radiofan15** (9.1): Why does this feel like a Beatles song? she's really doing great so far.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): Pop2 is a trainwreck
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): the piano adds a nice layer
 
**1998tweety** (8): Apparently this is the only song on the album written solely by Demi...ugh her mind. BANKS kind of outsold though oop.
 
**akanewasright** (8): SOLE writing credit for Demi here. That’s incredibly impressive, and this song is a bop and a half, too.
 
**selegend** (8): drag him!
 
#This song is a trainwreck
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (7.6): christ everything on this is awful and i love it. reminds me of ‘darling we’re a trainwreck’ ‘but sweetheart, trainwrecks always make the front page’.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): whew
 
**nightjesus** (10): BITCH YES CAMP ROCK. This movie changed my life. I was never the same after watching this duet.
 
**radiofan15** (8.6): I still laugh every time I remember when Demi stans (who always try to disassociate her from this song) voted this as her second best song below the topical Sober… at least this is better than The Greatest Showman song of the same name and anything on Camp Rock 2: Electric Boogaloo.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): This sounds surprisingly similar to the Greatest Showman’s This Is Me to the point where I nearly called the latter song out for ripping it off, but apparently the two have no connection. Uh-huh. Sure, I definitely believe that. For the record, this is the much better song of the two, though. Camp Rock is nowhere near as iconic as High School Musical was, but this is the closest it ever gets to achieving the status of a classic. Thank you, Demi!
 
**waluigiest** (8): I feel like this inspired an entire genre of teen film / song. Granted I’ve never seen camp rock and I’m sure it’s also derivative. But still.
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7.9): the greatest showman has nothing on this
 
**hikkaru** (7.5): love that this was her highest peaking song until SNS
 
**selegend** (6): it’s ok tbh dont kill me
 
**akanewasright** (5): This is too corny for me. I believe that Demi’s character wrote the song, at least?
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (5): i was a high school musical gay not a camp rock gay
 
**poppinmmolly** (4): I have never liked this song or Camp Rock

**followingfreeways** (10): this song literally invented pop music
 
**Roxieloxie** (8): You know at first I didn't include this song cause i didn't think people would vibe with the remix, and seeing that this song got two zeros, maybe i was right?
 
---
 
#Maybe we do like rock music
 
**1998tweety** (10): Wow what a massive bop, one of the few times where the remix is so much better than the original.
 
**gannade** (10): what kind of remix this is the exact same but with a slightly dancier beat but ok it slaps
 
**ggodisawomann** (10): the highs on this album are very high. I still remember watching a YouTube lyric video of this with a peach background and poorly made MS paint rectangles
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (10): an eleven contender. see you again is miley’s best song of all time, period. it has the perfect amount of futuristic production, interest, and the kind of cheesiness that made her beloved (‘my best friend leslie’). also, girl, you’re having a panic attack.
 
**Johnnytoby** (10): Yeah I'm a total gay and this bops
 
**NotWith10000Men** (10): I love any and all versions of this song
 
**radiofan15** (10): The Climb who? Wrecking Ball what? do I know any Malibu? NOPE... See You Again outsold them all.
 
**selegend** (10): one of the best songs of all time, just not quite as good as the original
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): honestly just what a fucking banger
 
**sleepypeach-** (9.5): milers and manders period.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): The first verses are my favourite part but the rest of the song isn’t as good even though it bops.
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (8.2): ooo a bop
 
#Im crying what the fuck is this why arent we rating the orginal
 
**akanewasright** (8): The original is 10 (possibly an 11) but this version is okay too. The extra production isn’t awful, just really unnecessary. It doesn’t distract from the song that much, so I’m giving it a relatively positive score.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): still a bop but the original >>>>
 
**didney-worl** (8): love the original
 
**waluigiest** (8): a classic, tho the original is better I think
 
**nightjesus** (7.5): Lower score due to remix but it still goes HARD.
 
**deannoying** (7): I prefer the original
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): the original was perfect tho...........
 
**letsallpoo** (7): why couldnt they just put the original
 
**liamtaylor13** (7): I like the original one more than this remix.
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (6): not wild about the remix but if the original See You Again had been in the rate it would’ve been a 10
 
**pillsxpotions** (4): this just doesn't do anything for the original
 
**yourhostandpatron** (0): Now, I won’t say that combining rock with electronic elements is a bad idea, but, dear God, was it a mistake to combine the twangs of See You Again (which is one of Miley’s best singles) and distort it into such a mess to the point where Miley and her best friend Leslie end up getting swallowed in this tragedy of a remix. Whoever Rock Mafia is, I’d encourage Miley to keep a lookout on him! I can easily see this version of See You Again losing this rate, but, hey, maybe we hate Selena that much.

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): Not the best single in this rate but not the worst
 
---
 
#Dont you wish?
 
**letsallpoo** (11): this was my favorite miley song when i was in elementary school. it's the kind of high-quality garbage that i absolutely adore
 
**akanewasright** (10): This song is perfect.
 
**ggodisawomann** (10): a bop since the beginning
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): the people that sing "FlY oN tHe WaLl" are fucking icons
 
**jlim201** (10): I think it might get annoying if the song was any longer but I love the change in the song when it goes "fly on the wall"
 
**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): i love the vocal effects
 
**radiofan15** (10): Right to the point! THOSE SYNTHS AND ALL THAT SHOUTING AT THE CHORUS GAVE ME LIFE AND WAS EVERYTHING.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): A LITTLE COMMUNICATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
**1998tweety** (9.5): A massive bop, feels totally different from the rest of the album so it stands out in a good way. The guitars on this are so good.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): I was blown away when I heard this song for our old Disney rate, and I’m still blown away by it. It’s by far the most creative example of what anybody has to offer in this rate; first, let’s talk about how Miley uses her higher register here. When was the last time we saw that happen, huh? But moving on to the biggest strengths of Fly On The Wall in general, I think it all boils down to how fascinating this song is in concept; we have Miley doing out-of-field choruses that sound like sinister cheerleader dances, some wacky production that succeeds in what Kiss and Tell was trying to go for but failed to do, and a sneaky reference towards being hounded by paparazzi that makes you more impressed with Miley’s work here than you originally intended to. I hate bugs, but I definitely love this song!
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (9): is it the best song? no. objectively, no. but the statement she makes on it is pretty incredible considering who she was at the time. if i remember correctly, it’s about her relationship with the paparazzi, and i’m gonna say it, it’s the prototype of gaga’s paparazzi. plus i love her vocal quality on the chorus, that affected accent is everything.
 
**Johnnytoby** (9): ugh yes some personality
 
**pillsxpotions** (9): The breakdown alone...DONT YA..please
 
**rosecoloreds** (9): the plot twist in the music video... ugh
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): A big bop! The bridge is so good!
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): THROWBACK. Awesome bridge, it seems to be a trend on this album
 
**nightjesus** (8): DONT CHA WISH THAT YOU COULD BE A fLy oN tHe WhALl
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7.6): I think it was good, but it didn't stick with me that much
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (7): her whole career has had this underlying theme of secrets, public vs. private selves, what counts as “real,” and I wish she’d lean into it like on this song again
 
#No
 
**waluigiest** (7): aggressive aight!!
 
**selegend** (4): NOT a good song, idk how it got so far on the disney rate lol
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): i love miley but i didn't like this song in 2008 and i hate it now
 
**Damoojo** (0): don’t like it.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Ending this album with Selena’s debut single seems really weird, but maybe even her executives knew that making Kiss and Tell’s finale another terrible ballad would have made things even worse. Tell Me Something I Don’t Know isn’t really all that up to shape, since Selena just basically squeaks her way throughout the whole song, but what ultimately redeems it is that she actually sounds alive here, a standard which is not shared between most of her other songs in this rate. Also, the (possible) Hurricane Katrina reference is morbidly hilarious and I cannot believe Disney allowed it.
---
 
#Did you know this is a bop
 
**gannade** (10): this is a megabop
 
**ggodisawomann** (10): sass bop
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (10): okay, love this? why is it the LAST TRACK
 
**iloveneonlights** (10): The MV made absolutely no sense and I love it
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): WIG!
 
**Johnnytoby** (10): I hate myself for rating it this high but damn its a classic
 
**selegend** (10): iconic, every time someone says this phrase this is the first thing that comes to mind to any gay
 
**waluigiest** (10): honestly this is a nostalgia score I LOVED this song as a kid. The second half of the chorus still slaps so hard……. Howmanyinchesinamile whatittakestomakeyousmile
 
**1998tweety** (9.5): A massive bop, love the chorus
 
**akanewasright** (8.5): I like the original mix more, but this song noticeably doesn’t suck, so it’s automatically a top pick from this album.
 
**jlim201** (8): Really love this song other than the short part with the other artist
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (8): this song turned fifth grade me into such a rebel
 
#Selena why would you end your album like this
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): “Selena hit the track like Katrina making waves” ashdjdjdjf why don’t I remember this when I heard this song years ago and why was it approved
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): a good closer to improve the prior songs which are A-Grade filler tbh. The random male voice ruins it for me though.
 
**deannoying** (7): I like this version more than the one on the Another Cinderella Story soundtrack
 
 
**radiofan15** (6.9): I was kinda feeling this one but those "rap" add-ons kinda cut the flow… also this is such an awful album closer ugh Selenah your mind did that!
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6): aaaand the message song
 
**nightjesus** (5): I was waiting for this song after Naturally and they fucking ruined it. Ffs. Anyway I know why only 2 singles were released from this album. It’s the only two singles she can probably sing live and that’s the T bitch.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (0): this was already annoying but the rap verse is just uniquely terrible

**nightjesus** (10): Fun fact back in 2009 I signed up for a talent show performance at a school camp and I wasn't prepared and I freaked out, so I sang this. From my iPod with one earphone in. No backup music. Still love the song tho. I still get like a flinch of cringe though every time I listen to it though.
 
**pillsxpotions** (10): this is actually one of their best songs
 
**radiofan15** (10): Immaculate bop that would have won on the main rate…
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): Is it bad if I think that this is better than most...no, scratch that, all of the songs on A Little Bit Longer? It comes the nearest to achieving Disney’s dream of making the Jonas Brothers an ideal boy band full of bops, and it just brings so many nostalgic memories that flash back to you having fun as a child that I find myself very sorry that this wasn’t tacked to A Little Bit Longer and into the main rate. It could have won! SMH.
 
**Roxieloxie** (8): This song is peak 2000's

Alright so Let's talk about Lovebug, For a while, This was actually tied for first. While it was tied for first it actually had an above 10 average and was doing great, IF you would've asked me and freeways during the start i would've told you that there was so way this wasnt gonna be a top three contender, however like lorde in any rate, the 11's got split between this and the other jobros singles so sadly, it's been chopped
 
---
 
#I'm Crying Cuz I love you
 
**extrasmallbillie** (11): the fact that this song still gets me as much as it got 10 year old me that never got his heart broken... The Power of the Jonas Brothers.
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (11): i don’t even care, this has always been my fave jonas brothers song and probably always would have been if not for sucker. nick’s voice can be ridiculous, but he’s perfectly suited on this, and the music video is the perfect compliment. (also: do they say diabetes! in the background im gonna pEE [just like nick before he got diagnosed ljvegnfdshlzcknd])
 
**poppinmmolly** (11): this is still my favorite Jonas Brothers song. It's so lovely.
 
**radiofan15** (11): Leaving aside the somewhat annoying spoken segments (although I still laugh at "Joe's not a girl" and "I dropped my pencil"), Lovebug is arguably the greatest thing to ever come out from this Disney Channel in the 00s, and that's including High School Musical!. The melody is warm and welcoming, kinda retro (fitting perfectly with the music video) and atmospheric, the kind of perfect throwback song that can work on any era WHILE belonging to said era... the chorus is quite subdued at first but it's such an earworm and calm you just can't help but to feel happy about it... this leads to the second verses and the amazing Jonas harmonies that decorates such simple but romantic lyrics. At this point the track is very welcoming, but the energy is all but hiding in plain sight waiting to be released (and of course this is still a JB song so there must be some guitars there) right when the bridge is supposed to be... ITS SO CATHARTIC AND POWERFUL IT MAKE ME FEEL ALIVE EVERY SINGLE TIME I LISTEN TO IT. This song truly deserved better, as it's not just the best song to ever come out from a Disney star (sorry Hill, Ashley, Vanessa, Selena, Miley, Demi, Bridgit and Bella) but also one of the finest pieces of pop music overall from the decade, THEY FUCKING TRULY DID THAT, THOSE BASTARDS.
 
**1998tweety** (10): In order to give this the 10 it deserves I will choose to ignore the weird spoken skit bits.
 
**deannoying** (10): Niley feels!!!
 
**Roxieloxie** (10): the part at 2:30 where the beat drops is worth an 11 in it's self
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): a cute as fuck song that is almost ruined by all the STUPID TALKING!!!!!!!
 
**followingfreeways** (10): the chorus is EVERYTHING
 
**Johnnytoby** (10): The melody is so pretty 💙
 
**nightjesus** (10): I DROPPED MY PENCIL
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Great song the only thing that bugs me is the talking in the middle of the song
 
**waluigiest** (9): beautiful naive love
 
**ggodisawomann** (8.5): cute emo bop
 
**minibjork** (8.5): i didn't understand love until i heard this song thank u jo bros
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (8.3): not as good as i heard it was supposed to be, but still fine enough :)
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (8): everything about the first 2/3 of this is adorable. would’ve been a 10 if it stayed acoustic and cute
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): still slaps
 
**selegend** (8): the talent jumped out
 
**sleepypeach-** (8): this song is so overrated. i am a terrible jonas fan.
 
#What the fuck are fucking feelings Yo
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): An acoustic guitar song with white men singing on it? Scandalous! And you people are telling me to give it an 11? Shame on you  all! But, no, even if I don’t understand why some people see this as the best Jonas Brothers song in the rate, I can at least admit that it’s one of a kind. There’s a bit of a break from the pop rock landscape of A Little Bit Longer here that’s ultimately relieving, and despite me going back and forth on whether the studio chatter is annoying, perhaps this genuinely succeeds in making people swoon. I’m fine with it for what it is, although it’s not really winning any brownie points from me.
 
**didney-worl** (6): kewt
 
**hikkaru** (5): boring and annoying
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5): "beautiful but you don't even try, modesty is so hard to find" BARF. And the talking in the background btwn verses is annoying

#Queen of rock music
 
**ggodisawomann** (10): also one of Demi’s best
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Demi as a rock artist is so much better than the weird rnb pop stuff she does now
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): is this song just massively underrated or did everyone shun it because of the ugly red gloves she wears in the music video
 
**radiofan15** (9.5): There's such an energy and vibe in this track… phew I really needed it.
 
**sleepypeach-** (9): pop rock queen of disney channel, when she came out with this oof.
 
**waluigiest** (9): shockingly well constructed and convincing. The Jonas Brothers influence is quite apparent
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): i want Demi to "get back"to this style of music
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): When people say they miss Demi being a pop rock star, next to immediately thinking about Here We Go Again, which is one of her best songs ever, I suspect that Get Back is fresh in the minds of all who state this. It clearly snuggles in perfectly to that long-gone sub-genre, going off hard and making no apologies; sometimes, it approaches the point of becoming a little too much for me, but if anybody could have pulled this off, it was Demi. And she succeeds! An extraordinarily captivating and worthwhile single.
 
**nightjesus** (8): Demi’s vocals are fucking iconic and she’s just a treat y’all.
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): This song is from 2008 and it sounds exactly like that, not a bad thing since it bops pretty hard.
 
#Get Back to the booth
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): not as strong as I remember but still a banger
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (6): Hannah Montana but she has a wider vocal range
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (5): the hollywood records songwriting formula has never been more apparent oh my god
 
**selegend** (4): very basic

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I know Potential Breakout Song has the best chance to win out of everything else, but I hope this triumphs or at least ends up at second place! Even if I never watched Hannah Montana all that frequently, this is pretty much the definition of a nostalgic theme song television show to me. Heck, it might be the only non-animated theme I actually am nostalgic for. The Best of Both Worlds features some of the most enjoyable, polished yet excitable Disney hooks you haven’t heard in awhile, and for all of the role Miley’s playing, her performance here is genuinely fantastic. An automatic thumbs-up for me!
 
**sleepypeach-** (8.5): hannah montana really had the best soundtrack

#IM HOT
 
**followingfreeways** (11): this is one of if not the most iconic song from this generation of Disney, it’s truly an 11 and NEVER gets old and will jam to this for my whole life
 
**ggodisawomann** (11): HIGH HEELS RED DRESS
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (11): one of the best pop songs of all time. I still lose my shit every time I hear this. the kind of song current me wants to write
 
**1998tweety** (10): Wow this is literally perfection. Bops so so hard.
 
**gannade** (10): they really peaked here huh
 
**Roxieloxie** (10): What is there to even say for this song. We all remember tuning into the disney channel games to watch the music vid come out. Selena, rEd DrEsS, the big rob rap all amazing pop culture moments that shaped us.
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (10): we fucking STAN the ‘red dress’ strangled cry. also, pour one out for everyone named gowest who didn’t understand the ‘slipping into the lava’ line for ten years. i don’t know what i thought it was, like, ‘slipping insta lover’ or something???? instagram didn’t even exist yet. what the FUCK.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): “high heels, red dress (red dress)” is one of the most legendary lines sung in the 21st century
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Gay rights!
 
**nightjesus** (10): DROP AND ROLL AND TOUCH THA FLOOR IT KEEPS ON BURNIN UP MORE AND MORE
 
**pillsxpotions** (10): big rob is a legend
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): this just gets me fired up whenever I listen to it
 
**radiofan15** (9.5): DAE remembers that MTV reality show Rob & Big which aired its final season around the release of this song? surprisingly this song doesn't have anything to do with that fantastic show (the credited rapper of Burning Up, Big Rob, is the Jonas' bodyguard, and it shows) which featured skateboarder and Ridiculousness host Rob Dyrdek and his bodyguard appropriately named Big Black (may he rest in peace) and their powerful friendship and multiple attempts to break world records… damn that show was amazing and I really missed both the show and Big too… anyway, what I'm trying to say is that rap feature is awful and deserves to die.
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (9.5): honestly i'd give it a 10 but the last 40 seconds kind of ruins it a lil for me
 
**akanewasright** (9): Pure bop!
 
**waluigiest** (9): RËD DRĘŚŠ
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): It’s easy to see why this is a Jonas Brother song that’s very fondly remembered by those who can still recall the band’s brightest days; while much of A Little Bit Longer isn’t as enjoyable to me in hindsight, this track is a genuinely well-crafted pop hit easy on the ears yet brimming with identity, pretty much accomplishing just what exactly the Jonas Brothers were intended to do as a band when they were with Disney. One thing I will say, though: that rap is distracting. Very distracting. That’s why this is only getting an 8.5.
 
**CarlieScion** (8): i really wish the chorus was as good as the verses
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): rEd DrEsS
 
**didney-worl** (7.9): some silly lyrics aside, this song slaps
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): I can still visualize this music video
 
#You're Cold
 
**selegend** (7): ehhh it’s not in my top 10 of their songs but still bop

**nightjesus** (9): I used to be that bitch who would sing the ending riff in class. Fairly sure I sounded like a fuckin goat cause I hadn’t learn how to pitch properly.
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (9): best song on the album, this is a classic, simple as that. the kind of song 2008 me wanted to write
 
**sleepypeach-** (9): disney generation classic #niley
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): 7 rings wishes
 
**waluigiest** (9): I have great, funny memories of this song in my childhood. It gets a lot of nostalgia points and it’s still fun, but wow the production is horrible there is no sonic depth at all
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I have somewhat mixed feelings about 7 Things; sometimes I’m very close to joining the hype train for it, but other times I think it’s a rambling mess. It certainly is an event, though; Miley listing off everything she likes and hates about whoever this song is directed to is pretty much the most prominent rant on youthful love the general public has ever been invested in since Carly Simon did the dirty deed. I can point out things in the song I don’t like, like how incomprehensible Miley is at times or how strained she seems pacing through the chorus, but it’s still a hell of an event; for that reason, I end up on its side more often than not.
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (8.4): the lead into the chorus is an absolute banger and changed music permanently, goodbye! the switch up with the ‘seven things i like about you’ at the end is also absolutely iconic. hearing this did kill me instantly, though.
 
**Johnnytoby** (8): I wanna make a witty ariana grande comment
 
**minibjork** (7.5): the mv for this should have made miley an EGOT winner
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): love when the chorus kicks in

**jlim201** (6): I don't think Miley's voice works particularly well in this style of song, specifically the chorus.

Roxieloxie: 
# A Little Bit Longer

---

**Overall Average**: 7.124 **// Average Controversy:** 1.843

---

**radiofan15** (8.367): Although quite rough on some spots, the Jonas Brother's breakthrough album is good, unpretentious and entertaining late-00s pop rock with enough musical surprises and highlights to keep someone engaged... it is also quite repetitive, but that's part of its charm. [Score: B+]

**yourhostandpatron** (7.542): A Little Bit Longer completely enchanted me the first time I heard it. I’m not really familiar with the Jonas Brothers because they didn’t continue their career like Miley, Selena and Demi did until they came back together this year, and because I actually completely, totally and sincerely despise men, but this sophomore album was full of bops, and I found myself wanting to go back to it in order to find out whether this was actually the best pop rock boy band album of all time or if Made In The A.M took the crown. And right now? ...uh, I think I’m going to have to go with Made In The A.M. I still enjoy a fair bit of this record, don’t get me wrong, but in contrast to Demi’s album in this rate and maybe even Miley’s, the magic of the Jonas Brothers wore me off pretty quickly in a disappointing way that I wasn’t expecting to experience. I’m sorry for the pun, but I wish that magic lasted a little bit longer...and I’m not quite sure why it did. Maybe if I look at my comments for individual songs I’ll find out why. On the other hand, maybe I’m just a misandrist. Whatever.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.542): This surprised me! The boys showed a pretty great deal of talent early on, and they're not nearly as manufactured as they could be. It's not perfect but there are some memorable tunes in here. [Grade: B+]

**selegend** (7.167): 7.17 jonas bros >>>> the beatles

**waluigiest** (6.417): how do they always sound so profoundly whiny

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.342): i was not a jonas stan, but they have some indisputable bops. i do find it qwhite interesting that they’ve come back and gotten a number one..... @ 1d wyd

Roxieloxie: # Breakout

---

**Overall Average**: 7.060 **// Average Controversy:** 1.946

---

**radiofan15** (8.442): Miley's proper debut (regardless of your opinion of Meet Miley Cyrus, you had to admit those songs were too close to Hannah Montana to count as a proper Miley release) is a strong and mostly concise effort from someone who was arguably way too young for working this hard, with strong vocal performances, catchy tunes, some intriguing musical surprises and some poignant songwriting that isn't gonna set the world on fire but it doesn't really try to. [Score: A-]

**selegend** (7.750): 7.75 her best album HONESTLY, so many great b-sides

**yourhostandpatron** (6.875): Breakout is either the second best or the second worst album in this rate. I haven’t decided which is which yet. On one hand, Miley, who produces music I generally dislike more often than not, genuinely surprised me a lot here, even when she tread more generic territory that child stars can expect to suffer the limits of. Songs like Breakout and 7 Things are bops, and songs like Fly On The Wall and Bottom of the Ocean show a more creative side that carry the potential to be honed. On the other hand, a lot of Breakout, like the ballads towards the end, is generally boring, and some missteps like Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and that terrible remix tacked onto the end of the record are occasionally enough to ruin the experience Breakout brings for me. I suppose that my final conclusion here is that Breakout has good songs, even if it’s not necessarily a good album. There’s nothing revolutionary that I expect from it, and it’s not as enjoyable as Don’t Forget, but if you’re a Miley hater, there’s enough material here that may make you change your mind and soften a bit towards the last remnants of Hannah Montana. On Breakout, Miley hasn’t quite escaped the child star machine yet - but she is getting out of there, and that’s fun to behold.

**waluigiest** (6.833): maybe I’m just losing my hearing but the production does nothing for me across the project and really limits her. It’s kind of hard to even trace this as the same artist who released Bangerz lol

**didney-worl** (5.983): not as good as her Hannah Montana material tbh

**gowestyoungkanye** (5.825): i remember being obsessed with 7 things and fly on the wall, but i don’t think i ever listened to the entirety of the album. listening to it in full has been such a trip, because it really feels like both the real precursor to the bangerz era and, somehow, simultaneously, the most cookie cutter hollywood records nonsense. hannah montana 2: meet miley cyrus is superior.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.458): Super inconsistent, not a great showcase of Miley's voice, ultimately just not a great showcase of pop rock. [Grade: C]

This one hurts, almost as much as the next one but this song had so much going for it, This was the second song lovebug was tied with for quite sometime. It didn't make it back to top three until the very last weekend when the 11's came swooping in for it but sadly it wasnt enough to push it back to number one

#Fuck Ryan and Emma this is the true oscar winner
 
**akanewasright** (11): Honestly, this is such a bop.
 
**Damoojo** (11): It’s a great song.
 
**gannade** (11): yassssss
 
**ImADudeDuh** (11): there's too many iconic moments in this omg I can't list them all.
 
**Johnnytoby** (11): God I adore Selena and Naturally deserves top ten you twinks but man this is just perfection from the lyrics, attitude, and production Demi really is a star
 
**waluigiest** (11): la la land walked so marina could run
 
**Roxieloxie** (10): Out the gate with a banger. An oscar worthy bop
 
**1998tweety** (10): An absolute 10, this is such a tune. Love the rock production and the guitar solos work well.
 
**followingfreeways** (10): fuck this is so good fakdjlkd I was so torn between this and burnin up for my 11. This song gave my 9 year old self CONFIDENCE
 
**ggodisawomann** (10): one of Demi’s best
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (10): i fucking love this song. i bought the video on itunes, even. it’s a harrowing experience to listen to ten years or so on, knowing what happened to demi and what she’s been through, there’s an earnestness to lines like the converse line that made me smile hearing it again and then broke my heart.
 
**nightjesus** (10): This song is a fucking bop and the video clip is iconic with the best cast from the BEST Disney Channel original show ‘Sonny With a Chance’. You can not change my mind.
 
**radiofan15** (10): Demi didn't have to snap this hard but she did it anyway and now here we are… GOSH the guitar work and her vocal performance are fucking celestial!
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): absolutely iconic
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): very strong album leadoff
 
**sleepypeach-** (9.5): almost a 10 for me but eating at ronalds...idk
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): It’s title may be silly, but La La Land is actually a pretty significant song, all things considered. Aside from being Demi’s first non-Camp Rock breakthrough, it also shows that Disney’s model for stars was becoming a bit...self-aware, in the vein of what we’d already seen with Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus. It’s also a bit painful to listen to ten years on, considering what’s happened to Demi since then, but for what it’s worth, I’m not disappointed by her; all child stars are scarred by fame in time, and La La Land still shows the resilience and individuality that Demi carries on today, even past her personal struggles. She shows that she’s a different sort of Disney girl here, and she succeeds in making a bop. I can’t imagine how many little girls loved hearing this back then!
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): easily the best opener of the 4 and we love a converse wearing queen
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (8): brings back memories of doing elaborate dance performances to this in my room in fifth grade
 
#People who wont let demi wear her converse
 
**CarlieScion** (8): a bit too on the nose
 
**didney-worl** (7.9): great vocals, impressive runs
 
**poppinmmolly** (7.5): hot take??? this is not as good as everyone says it is.
 
**selegend** (7): you know, if demi wins, that technically means the jonas brothers still won. anyways, this song is iconic, and that video is even more iconic - i wouldn’t say this is one of her absolute best though
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): music is alright, lyrics are eh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): aly and aj have been robbed like 596954 times by this stupid sub please let them win something
 
**waluigiest** (10): it’s not fair for this to be in this rate it’s like if an NFL team played in the NCAA championship (idk if that makes sense I’m gay)
 
**yourhostandpatron** (10): Hey, guys, I wonder what’s going to win the rate? I bet it’s definitely not gonna be this song! No way in hell will it get first place! But, seriously, whether Ally and AJ are going to slay Popheads or not, as a sad member of our current generation, I would like to assure all the old people out there that I understand why this song is an iconic masterpiece. Sure, it has flaws, but the general flow of action? That teen girl sassiness we all know and love shining through the girls’ lyrics? Both of those make for a killer hit. This may be a predictable win, but it certainly will be a deserving one.
 
**nightjesus** (7): Like I live the song now but Backin the day, Chemicals React was my god damn JAM.
 
#People who want us to have to rate this song again
 
**akanewasright** (3): I like Aly & AJ’s new stuff, but this does nothing for me.
 
**CarlieScion** (1): im not even sorry this isnt good if u remove the nostalgia glasses. stream Take Me tho
 
**radiofan15** (1): NOPE nope NOPE noppity FUCKING NOPE… this has to be one of the most overrated songs of all time from a band that just got marginally better in the last few years by appealing to the basic gays who believes anything that resembles an 80s song is an immediate BOP. Spoilers: it's not.

I was dead set on giving La La Land my 11 until I actually listened through the rate for the first time and Don't forget just really really took me there. As the Third song that was tied for 1st. This song didn't move for a good two weeks. Sadly at one point Naturally overtook it just slightly, Right before the rate ended u/CarlieScion actually managed to sink Selena and push this back to number one, but in the end, Taste ended up loosing
 
---
 
#Billie jean Eyelash could never
 
**Roxieloxie** (11): in a rate stacked full of bangers I never predicted me giving my 11 to this song. La La Land had it until the last second i remembered demi wrote this when she was 16 and the line "Our love it's like a song, you cant forget it" is so fucking raw and pains me to my soul that theres no way I cant give it my 11
 
**minibjork** (11): looking back on crying to this song at 10 years old is an experience let me tell ya
 
**rosecoloreds** (11): i don't think demi gets enough credit on this sub, at least for her early albums
 
**sleepypeach-** (11): everything about this song is amazing. the build up, the raining aesthetic of the video, demi's quiet then powerful vocals. bye.
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (11): ICONIC what an emotional ride - 14 year old me dug this shit when i was going through the devastating heartbeak of crushes not liking me back
 
**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this song is so amazing; honestly I prefer Catch Me and the 2 songs are super similar, but this still slays.
 
**akanewasright** (10): Absolutely masterful buildup, writing, and vocal performance.
 
**deannoying** (10): Still one of my faves, though!
 
**followingfreeways** (10): as a child I used to get emo to this song. As adult, I get emo to this song
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (10): this will never NOT make me horribly emotional and fall to my knees.... stone cold is the same way. maybe young me liked ballads. (**Editors Note: The fact that Ms. GoWest "fuck ballads" herself gave this
a ten is enough reason in itself it should've won)
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): she's making it impossible not to stan
 
**Johnnytoby** (10): This is the polar opposite of Lovebug lyrically but not sonically I think I found my musical fetish
 
**nightjesus** (10): Fucking sing if queen. Had 14 year old me crying to my Cole Sprouse poster.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (10): the moment I knew this bitch could sing
 
**pillsxpotions** (10): this song is v emo and perfect
 
**selegend** (10): yeah this is one of the best songs in existence. robbed on the disney rate >:[
 
**waluigiest** (10): this song is a slow burn and I was ready to give up but it’s so great
 
**ggodisawomann** (9): ugh this album
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Everybody might kill me a little for this, but I don’t really see this song as one of my favourites off this album. It’s pretty good, sure, and I can totally see why it appeals to people so much, and maybe even why tons of folks are planning to give this their 11s, but there are even better ballads Demi has in store for us here (Like, uh, Two Worlds Collide? Until You’re Mine? They all say hello) and while Don’t Forget hits some really impressive moments, as a whole, the song doesn’t stick with me all that well. I actually quite like it and don’t hate it by any means, but I’m just not particularly attached to Don’t Forget as a song.
 
**radiofan15** (7.5): It takes a while to properly settle in but when it does… phew, this one works way better as a midtempo middle point of the album than On The Line.
 
#People who forgot
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): this was never my favorite idk
 
**jlim201** (3): this song does not play to Demi's strengths at all

Roxieloxie: # Dont Forget

---

**Overall Average**: 7.578 **// Average Controversy:** 1.749

---

**waluigiest** (8.273): the start of this album is banger after banger. Second half is not bad but much less interesting. I don’t know the exact relationship between Demi and the Jonas Brothers but maybe it’s kind of like that rat training the ninja turtles (Demi) who then becomes even stronger than the rat

**radiofan15** (8.155): I can't believe this turned out to be one of those albums that start stronger than usual and then slow downs at the middle of it before recovering some energy at the end (even if it's a little bit too late), I was ready to bring my guitar in and smashing it on the floor! [Score: B+]

**akanewasright** (8.082): Demi had the best album of this whole rate and it’s not even close. The vocals are there (sorry Jonas Brothers and Selena), the tunes are there (sorry Selena and Miley), and the star power is there.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.045): Oh, boy, am I glad that I picked this album to be my introduction to the musical and cultural landspace of nostalgia this rate is designed to produce. I’ve always liked Demi’s music the most out of all the ex-acts, though at times I tend to prefer Selena’s highs, but Don’t Forget is such a surprising and fantastically fun ride back to the pop rock sounds of the late 00s and early 10s that I can’t help but be impressed at how bold Demi was (and still is!) for somebody so young. There’s a ferocity here that’s absolutely not just the product of a manufactured corporation, and almost all of the songs in this record are enjoyable on your own. You know what? I’m actually interested in exploring Demi’s discography thanks to Don’t Forget! Next to Speak Now, it might just be the pinnacle of this type of sound.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.955): The best album in the rate by a decent margin. Demi is the most naturally musically talented of any of the Disney ex-acts, and she has always fit best in this pop rock style. You can tell she was heavily influenced by the emo quartet of this time period and that's a good thing. [Grade: A-]

**selegend** (7.545): 7.55 what an amazing album, to think she co-wrote all of these songs… a lot of girls can’t do that!

**didney-worl** (7.464): surprisingly consistent album carried by Demi's vocals (though the lyrics are definitely aimed more towards kids)

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.536): title track makes me emo beyond belief lads.

**1998tweety** (11): I remember bopping to this so many times when I was younger, and it still holds up. Literal pop perfection
 
**ignitethephoenix** (11): Out of all the songs in the rate, I feel like this one has aged the best. The production is fun and it’s super catchy and Selena sounds good here.
 
**rosesmp3** (11): i watched so many of those commercials on disney channel featuring this song ten years ago i feel like it's burned into the surface of my brain now and i'm not even mad about it
 
**selegend** (11): i am irrationally scared that people will sabotage this because 1) it’s an obvious winner and 2) it’s a selena gomez song but naturally is truly an amazing electropop song and i want selena to have her first rate win
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (11): you know it this is just such a good song
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): one of the best songs of all time
 
**TragicKingdom1** (11): sorry demi this is the best song in the rate
 
**akanewasright** (10): This song almost justifies the rest of the album. Selena can sell the shit out of a dance song, and this was one of the first times she got to do that.
 
**ggodisawomann** (10): when ur wit me baybee
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck her STUPID big necklace in the music video
 
**Johnnytoby** (10): that intro always makes me finish u twinks better nOt let this be ranked 11
 
**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): anyone who gives this less than a 10 is a top, yes we're top shaming for now
 
**NotWith10000Men** (10): this music video was beautiful and the song is a banger. Her voice sounds really good in this one
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): this was one of my favorite songs back in the day
 
**radiofan15** (10): Finally some fucking good music!. Naturally is one of the best things Whispers has ever done and I can't believe this gigantic bop with such an enormous chorus and captivating atmosphere wasn't a bigger hit. The world can be an unfair place sometimes.
 
**rosecoloreds** (10): an absolute banger on such a mediocre album....
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): another "so close to being my 11 but just missed out"
 
**deannoying** (9.5): Best song on the album!
 
**hikkaru** (9.5): I like pretty much everything about this song except "BAY BAY BAY BEE". i think it will win
 
**sleepypeach-** (9): okay i think is an unpopular opinion, but this song is a cute lil dancing hit.
 
**waluigiest** (9): when he knows who he is :) and it’s exciting :)
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Ah, the only song from Selena that people are going to recognize in this rate. It’s also the only song from her that people are going to actually like. Haha! Honestly, as a lone song, Naturally is still miles more mature and creative than practically anything else Kiss and Tell has to offer, which is what makes it more or less great. But as a whole, the song is...way worse than I remember. Why is the production so corny? What are those sound effects? Why does some guy mumble the chorus near the end? Was I really planning on giving this my 11? I really was boo boo the fool, huh? Goddamnit, Selena. Goddamnit!
 
**nightjesus** (8): An ICONIC bop. Although the big golden necklace in the video video clip kinda freaked me out idk why.
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (7.6): classic but overrated. also, this song is a rip off of ‘see you again’ and no, i will not shut up about it!!!!
 
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (6): two of my friends choreographed a dance routine to this entire song
 
**CarlieScion** (4): this is actually trash im not even sorry
 
**Roxieloxie** (2): You know, I made a joke maybe a week into the rate that selena was gonna end up winning for natrually Due to the fact that this is the only "good" song on her album that the stans were all gonna rally around it and not be split like they were for the others, and i've never been so upset to be right in my life
