---

**followingfreeways** (8): a bop

---

**didney-worl** (11): yeah I know but this song slaps and the synths are great

**mirandacrocsgrove** (10): the songwriter on this song's minds UGH

**Johnnytoby** (9): huh that was good

**radiofan15** (8.2): The chorus is a big bunch of disappointing blandness but the tracking back is giving me life… I'll take anything decent I get with open arms

**1998tweety** (8): Bops a bit, chorus feels a bit like a mouthful though

**hikkaru** (8): i can see how the production of this could be annoying af but i think it's neat

**waluigiest** (8): with a few tweaks (thicker orchestration, better transitions, more mature voice) this would be unstoppable. It falls a little short but the potential is there

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): this one is so cute

**akanewasright** (7.3): One of the few songs from the album that I liked when I was younger. I’m kind of baffled by parts of it now, but it’s still easily one of the more listenable tracks here.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok maybe she snapped a bit

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): bridgit mendler is shaking

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): I Don’t Miss You At All kind of has that confident, euphoric, girl power-filled energy that made I Won’t Apologize a worthy song in the end earlier on in Kiss and Tell, but unlike the former song, this track is much later placed in what’s already a mediocre tracklist, subjecting itself to extra fatigue from people patient enough to listen to it. Plus, just like more than half of the songs on this goddamn album, it’s too similar to the music it’s sandwiched in between to make that much of a statement. I don’t think this was meant to be filler, exactly, but it does come damn close, and that’s already a downer.

**gowestyoungkanye** (4): it’s interesting, i guess

**selegend** (4): ehhh i don’t see it for this song, the chorus is kinda bad… the opening synths are amazing though

**ggodisawomann** (3): second half of this album so weak

**nightjesus** (1): Holy moly this album went down hill so quick. Ugh. Also Selena, you’re 16 in this album. You are not going out 7 days and partying. Also that guitar ooooooof. Who mixed this album?

**followingfreeways** (8): what was homegirl going through:( u ok miley?

**Roxieloxie** (7): Nice vocals but ballads, as always are not my thing

---

**gannade** (10): omg this power ballad... tears in my eyes

**NotWith10000Men** (9): the buildup ugh her mind

**selegend** (9): omg i remember i have the wonder world tour on dvd cos it came with the cant be tamed cd…

**1998tweety** (8.5): This reminds me a bit of a Speak Now TSwift song.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): definitely the most mature sounding song on the album

**nightjesus** (8): I’m super duper impressed by this album so far like holy shit Miley get it sis. Them LUNGS.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): ok now this a good ballad pls take notes bottom of the ocean

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7.4): Nice and simple, I liked it

**radiofan15** (7.2): Her YEE needed to HAW and womanspread her legs somewhere so I'm not complaining.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Another Miley ballad that I won’t expect Popheads to like too much. This time, we have some orchestration accompanying Miley, giving us a song that might be enjoyable to people who’re already sold out on her, but not quite as effective on people who aren’t. I don’t see this as too bland, actually, because Miley’s performance here is pretty solid, but I can’t find anything else to say about it. I’m not expecting us to be big fans of those walls.

**letsallpoo** (6): love is 4 walls

**waluigiest** (6): not balanced but I live for the hints of folksiness

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): hated it from the guitar but then she kinda sounds like taylor swift so. (can i make a bet someone’s going to reference f(x)??)

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): singing over guitars suits her voice so well

**ggodisawomann** (3): no

**yourhostandpatron** (8): For some reason, I feel that a driveway isn’t the most...effective metaphor to base a song around? I get that it’s used because Miley is leaving somebody behind, but the staunch modernity of cars as symbolism doesn’t seem as adept for a love song as Miley thinks it will. But, ah, whatever. The imagery here isn’t tragic, or anything. I don’t want to seem like a pretentious twat. I don’t have much to say about the Driveway, because it’s a pretty standard pop rock song with a bit of country in it, but even if it’s no Speak Now, it’s still kinda catchy, if I do say so myself. Miley’s Southern chops definitely help with the vocals.
 
 
---

#Take me home, country roads
 
**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): One of my favourites from Miley. I honestly can't say what this song does better than her others, but this one really clicks with me.
 
**gannade** (9.5): it has a nice small country rock vibe
 
**deannoying** (9): I LOVE this one! Her vocals are so good at only 15-years-old.
 
**radiofan15** (9): I swear I recognize the first notes from the chorus' melody from another song (it was another power ballad, this one in Spanish) but I can't place it and it's driving me nuts… anyway, this is a quite good and relatable deep cut and we have to stan.
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (8.4): Oooh that chorus actually really slapped
 
**You know what this is , growth**
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): This is pretty decent, you can really hear how much better Miley's voice has become
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): legitimately a good song. Love the guitar in the bridge
 
**nightjesus** (7): Look I’m gonna admit that I haven’t listen to this whole album. But damn I missed out. This is a damn jam. Reminds me of the Iconic Hannah Montana song ‘If we Were a Movie’.
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): honestly i never realised how much miley's voice had improved till re-listening to this
 
#Please turn off the car radio
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (7.3): ironically the title makes me think of a line from a tv show i was watching earlier today, ‘wait for someone whose car you’re happy to see in the driveway’. i like this more than i thought i would. i’m having to throw away my usual taste for this rate, if i’m being honest, because i don’t enjoy green day, lol.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): she just sounds bad on this song
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (6): it sounds like all the other country/pop/rock from the year it was made, but the chorus is good and she belts that shit out
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6): kinda overperformed
 
**waluigiest** (6): poorly produced cliche breakup song BUT the titular lyrics are tasty in a corny way

#Kinda good, sorry not sorry
 
**nightjesus** (10): Ugh right in the nostalgia feels when I used to listen to this when it rained on the bus.
 
**extrasmallbillie** (9.5): Halsey is shaking
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (9.2): i kinda love. what the fuck. you’re as surprised as i am.
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): Would've preferred if the vocals were a bit softer on this but besides that it's good.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Just like Demi’s Trainwreck (well, except for the fact that it’s not as amazing) Sorry is a ballad attached to A Little Bit Longer that you’d expect to be kind of boring, but, really, I found the song to be surprisingly touching in the process. This definitely has the best melodic composition on the entire album; I wouldn’t choose the Jonas Brothers out of all acts to do a slow song like this, but Sorry does its job well and I have no qualms with it that deter me from actually enjoying it. Out of the two ballads on this record, it’s certainly the better one.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
 
**sleepypeach-** (8): nick literally awakened my soul at the start of that second verse. hello.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): A nice ballad but I wish it stood out a little more
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): the emotion, the angst
 
**radiofan15** (7.1): Nice ballad with some interesting production choices to break away from some of the repetitiveness of the album… it would have been better if Nick Jonas hadn't performed the second verse while trying to emulate a just-awake and drunk modern-day Bob Dylan.
 
#Nick please just shut up
 
**Johnnytoby** (7): :/ the lazy chorus once again ruins a great idea
 
**hikkaru** (5.5): whichever jonas that is that is straining so hard can he like not?
 
**akanewasright** (5): What the hell is happening in that second verse? This song was nice until Nick started trying to commit vocal suicide.
 
**selegend** (5): a lil boring
 
**NotWith10000Men** (4): I just really hate the main singer's voice in the verses, I think it's nick?
 
**ggodisawomann** (3): eh

**gowestyoungkanye** (7.8): i kinda had to stan and i’m mucho confused about it! trust!
 
**nightjesus** (7): Look I always thought this was a OneRepublic song so I always skipped it on my shuffle. But this is a nice lil boy band love song.
 
**didney-worl** (6.8): the melodrama is astounding
 
**radiofan15** (6.6): Wait, an electronic ballad in my 2008 Jonas Brothers album?… oh wait, there it is, the generic pop rock elements! please never leave us like that again, you scared me…
 
**ggodisawomann** (6.5): yes
 
**Ballads???? In my good Disney Rat???**
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): I had a very, very hard time trying to remember how this song went, which means that I faced the same problem with it as I did with Shelf. I managed to remember how it went for thirty minutes and I found it likeable, but, alas, I am not in that time span of thirty minutes any longer. I suppose that, objectively, this could be a great track, but I’m not sure if I’m willing to give a song I don’t even recall after four straight spins more than what I’ve ultimately settled on! Yet another disappointing stop for the Jonas Brothers.
 
**selegend** (6): nick’s voice is straining so hard… good lyrics though, it’s pretty
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5): the beginning was interesting but then it just sounded like every other song on the album by the chorus. Is this joe singing in the beginning? I like him a lot better than nick
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (4): I forgot how country/alt rock everything sounded in 2008
 
**waluigiest** (4): somehow says nothing?

**gannade** (10): i have no idea why on gods green earth does the filler in this album bop so much but it does
 
**pillsxpotions** (10): the lyrics and her tone are so beautiful here
 
**radiofan15** (10): Quite the mood whiplash; this is a gorgeous and subdued electro ballad with trip-hop and R&B elements that really foreshadowed some of the most normal cuts from Dead Petz… again, this one TRULY deserved better.
 
**Johnnytoby** (9): Ok I didn't expect another good song on this album 💦
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9): I forgot about this song and I really really love it
 
**waluigiest** (9): this is mature and chill and generally well constructed
 
**1998tweety** (8): I can't decide if I find this boring or interesting, I think I'm leaning towards the later cause this is pretty weird for a ballad honestly.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song is really soothing but their are parts that are kinda weird
 
**selegend** (8): such BEAUTIFUL production for a song about her dead fish that she flushed down the toilet. also if any of you read her book Miles to Go, she explains a bunch of songs from this album
 
#People who cant swim
 
**nightjesus** (7): This song was totally produced by someone high on weed and they are my hero.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): Much like Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, my feelings on this have gone from complete and utter hatred to mixed regards; you could argue that Miley does a soft, slow style of music here with imagery you’d find more often in more rural songs that she has a hard time executing well, which was my original gripe with Bottom of the Ocean, but now, despite her not really taking the song’s concept to its maximum potential, I find it a little lovely and quite a bit charming. This does tend to get tedious as a song, but I like Miley’s effort in it.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): you'll also find Dead Petz's chart position there
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (4.3): I don't know honestly I couldn't get behind it
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (3.5): fuck i forgot this existed and i forgot how bad disney's attempts at ballads are. extra .5 bc the last minute improves
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (2.6): roxie if you’re reading this, i know you know how much i hate ballads and trying to pull off, like, an enya new age vibe (only enya can pull it off, idc!) makes them worse. (**Editors note**: We know how much she hates ballads)

**Roxieloxie** (10): basically what were gonna do is give this our 10s

#Basically what we're gonna do is bop
 
**deannoying** (10): A bop. Vanessa deserved
 
**letsallpoo** (10): FUCKING ICONIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
**radiofan15** (10): I don't know what to think of this song… Vanessa sounds weird, the backing track is part-disco, part-R&B, part-jazz and part-pop, and the lyrics are atrocious BUT I fucking love it for whatever the fuck is trying to do.
 
**waluigiest** (10): THIS IS EXCELLENT I loved it at age 12 and I love it at age 22. It’s supremely fun with a few quirks that make it a banger for the ages. I SAID basically what we’re gonna do is dance!!!
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Big bop!
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (9): YEAH THATS RIGHT ITS SNEAKER NIGHT
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): Vanessa’s solo career really wasn’t as long as it ought to be, but thankfully, even if she didn’t quite reach the heights of superstardom after High School Musical, we still have Sneakernight to talk about. I’m not gonna lie, this isn’t as good as the best song in the main rate (it sounds less polished and more rushed than a Disney hit ought to be) and it’s a sign that outside of Hillary Duff, the child actor slash singer model we’ve come to know and love hadn’t fully worked out yet, but, by golly, is this a bop. BASICALLY WHAT WE’RE GONNA DO IS DANCE! BASICALLY WHAT WE’RE GONNA DO IS DANCE! It’s not perfect, but Sneakernight is definitely a sign of good things to come.
 
**akanewasright** (8.5): This song is a horrifying mess. The hook is one of the dumbest I’ve heard (it sounds like a shitty song I “wrote” when I was 7). Vanessa sounds like JLo doing that Motown tribute. The key change is stupid as fuck. I could not stop laughing when I listened to it. This song is amazing.

#Middle School Crush Teas
 
**jaztinax** (10): The best Niley breakup song along with Sorry
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): I FORGOT HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS SONG OH MY GOD the chills running through my body.
 
**nightjesus** (9): This song reminds me of the fake relationship I had in my head with Cole Sprouse back in 2009. Yeah that’s right Riverdale fans. I was thirsting over him back in the Suite Life days.
 
**sleepypeach-** (8.5): once again, a niley classic.
 
**1998tweety** (8): It's cute, a decent closer
 
**waluigiest** (8): instrumental is bland but this track works
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): good just a little long feeling
 
#Miley Sweetie, its the end of the album , not the world
 
**radiofan15** (7.1): Cute little country pop ballad that might not be the most original but at least it's passable enough to make for a decent album closer.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): Miley ends her album on a bit of a dramatic note that can spark up some thrills in you but is, ultimately, just a little too indistinguishable from much of Breakout. Goodbye can do all to pull a teenager’s heartstrings, and Miley’s performance in it is worth more praise than you would originally have hoped to guess for, but, unfortunately, Goodbye lacks that true pizzaz that makes all the best breakup anthems heartbreakingly magical. There might be hope for reconciliation here, but that hope is fragile when it comes to quality.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): cute song but sounds very overdramatic teenager
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (3): this album is just. so weird. like. sonically cohesive who.
 
**ggodisawomann** (2): stop

jaztinax: this is honestly the sad, depressing version of 7 things where the song is based on her singing about missing a relationship but the last chorus FLIPS and turns into her finding out that the other person is also missing all those things! y'all better recognize the emotional pull factor on this

**deannoying** (9): Meaghan Martin's intro is iconic
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): This is definitely the best song on A Little Bit Longer. This should not be a point of contention. ...except for one thing, that is. Pardon me, but I can’t help finding this a little...misogynist? Like, sure, I get there are people there out to get you and take advantage of you no matter the genders of the people involved, but I mean, when you open the song with a bunch of screaming girls yelling vapid stuff about how hot the Jonas Brothers are and you spend the rest of the song complaining about women, er, yes, it’s cringey at best. Let’s just say that I can’t imagine them performing this ever again. But on the positive side of things, Video Girl has a hell lot of more oomph to it than I hoped for; it’s the peak of pop rock on A Little Bit Longer, and it’s one of the least forgettable songs on the album simply because of how full of life this teenage diss track is. It’s problematic...but it also bangs. Hello, conflict my old friend! I won’t give Video Girl my 11, but I’ll be anxious to see how it does.
 
**radiofan15** (8.7): Wait, how did they got away with such a suggestive song while under control of the Mouse? not that I'm complaining but…
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): I stan this shade, it slaps too
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (8.4): honestly it was really fun
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (8.2): this is really interesting, in the same vein of la la land. i mean, the intro is wack, but i’ve always loved really irreverent, parody-esque songs. also, please note that i’m not commenting on misogyny in jobros songs because that would be pointless, but i’m thinking it. and the irony of them putting their now-wives in the sucker video. lol.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): That voice over at the beginning lol. Also kind of wish they said kiss my ass instead of kiss the past smh this is what purity rings do to people

**waluigiest** (9): somehow even gayer without the visuals??? Stunning
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): I don’t know what a random High School Musical track is doing here, but just to be clear, I am absolutely living for this. Funnily enough, I do think this is one of the best songs from that movie series from a professional perspective. It’s slick, groovy, and as RnB as Disney is ever going to get in between the Cheetah Girls and Zendaya, and the gay subtext between Chad and Ryan? There are tears in my eyes, folks. I’m not joking.

**NotWith10000Men** (11): might be a dark horse candidate for the 11s but I scored it 2 seconds into the song. forgot how much I loved it
 
**liamtaylor13** (10): this was my second contender for 11 but 7 things won.
 
**1998tweety** (9): Another slay, the back half of this album has been consistently good
 
**yourhostandpatron** (9): I was hoping that at least one of the albums in this rate would have amazing deep cuts like so many pop artists in a more mature place tend to have, and I’ve become thoroughly satisfied, because Until You’re Mine definitely fits that criteria to a tea. These are the exact kind of hooks I love in occasional doses - desperate, pleading and packed with a bundle of emotions, and, hoo, boy, do Demi and her vocal cords succeed in making the song a perfect example of what I’m talking about! A hidden classic, and an underrated gem. Quite possibly one of my favourites in this rate.
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): another damn banger
 
**waluigiest** (8): with a more intense orchestration this could be a hype metal song
 
**radiofan15** (7.8): I was so excited for the chorus and so underwhelmed for the verses… basically me with almost every pop song.
 
**akanewasright** (6.5): This song is kind of messy? Probably the worst track on the album (also the only track that Demi didn’t write in any capacity).
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): If a guy was singing this it would be a lot creepier lol
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (6): idc. is this a half-ballad? idk! idc!! i ENJOY this!!!!
 
**nightjesus** (6): I feel like I need to be on a pirate ship singing this in the moonlight.
 
**selegend** (6): we love an artist
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (3): doing this rate has reminded me that 1) most Disney Channel album cuts in the late 2000s sounded exactly the same and 2) it’s not a sound I like

But in other news, I actually remember how this song goes (praise the Lord!) and I do remember quite enjoying it. There’s some of that tasty hormonal rage that was present in One Man Show here, and even if I do feel a bit guilty for liking that, it does make for some great moments! One of the better songs on the album.

#Ikea fans

**minibjork** (8.2): this could be the brother song to demi's don't forget
 
**radiofan15** (8.2): TBH if it wasn't for that bridge and the "la la las" this would be quite lower, those little touches makes this quite average track stand out a little bit more.
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): i love the vocals in this
 
**1998tweety** (7): Vocally this song jumps all over the place, it'll go from speaking to screaming within 2 lines and it does not work at all.
 
**nightjesus** (7): It kinda sounds like a heart felt nice guy anthem. Still cute though.
 
**waluigiest** (7): whiny and dramatic but not in a bad way
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): One of the reasons why A Little Bit Longer largely grew off me during my third listen of it is because I found it increasingly hard to remember how every song on the record actually went, and Shelf is the first example of this (and it’s only the third track!). Some things I remember about it are the central analogy and a vague guitar rift super similar to the Jonas Brothers’ other songs in this rate, but it’s ultimately hard to distinguish. Enjoyable, but just another example of how A Little Bit Longer isn’t executed to its full potential.
 
**didney-worl** (6.9): nice melody, really cringe lyrics

 **NotWith10000Men** (6): not bad. They sound whiny but it works with this song

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): The Middle has better potential than Party thanks to having a more effective use of a pop rock hook, but it isn’t all that great. It’s just some more of Demi’s belting set against another stereotypically rebellious song that doesn’t do much if you’re not a fan of Don’t Forget already, though, to be fair, it has too much energy stacked up for me to toss it into the filler pile without any care. Still, there are no great songs named the Middle.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): i'm sorry but does this remind anybody else heavily of 'in the dark of the night' from anastasia
 
**radiofan15** (8.5): Not a big fan of her use of vocal trickery here but I like the energy of the song and her overall delivery, it remind me of her brief pre-fame stint as the lead vocalist of the pro-anarchist communist punk rock band Castro's Cock Suckers.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): iconic vocal performance
 
**waluigiest** (8): wish I could do this
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (6): it's no busted or the prison song

**Roxieloxie** (3): it says alot about how much i like this song for the fact i thought it was on the pixie hollow soundtrack
 
---
 
**Damoojo** (10): A cute bop!
 
**deannoying** (10): Such a sweet friendship song <3
 
**selegend** (9): the strings in this always took me into art gay heaven
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): This is nice, the vocals in particular slay
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): amazing vocals
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): In my humble opinion, these are pretty much the best examples of Demi’s vocals on Don’t Forget, along with the title track. Sure, there aren’t any incredibly powerful moments with a lot of belting involved like in Until You’re Mine, which I like even more than Two Worlds Collide, but Demi pulls this off with a kind of youthful and innocent spin that just manages to be very effective, especially if you take into account how clear and pretty her voice sounds when she sings it. Some people might think this is boring, but I really enjoy it.
 
**nightjesus** (8): This song is just beautiful. I feel like I’m floating through a forest lit up with tealights when I listen to this song.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): when worlds collide from the Spongebob UGH! episode outpeaked
 
**minibjork** (7.5): the s t r i n g s in the back
 
**radiofan15** (7): More filler I guess…
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): really should have been a duet
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (4): okay this half of the album..... trash
 
**sleepypeach-** (4): it just doesn't belong on the album to me.

**followingfreeways** (7.5): this chorus actually really slaps
 
**Roxieloxie** (7): This is a song that I can just see 8 year old me obsessed with
 
---
 
**selegend** (10): this is honest to god one of miley’s best songs. i’d put it in my top 5 miley songs along with PITUSA, see you again, drive, and nothing breaks like a heart
 
**nightjesus** (9): Holy moly do I regret not listening to this album in full! This song is a lil jam.
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): honestly this slaps and she sounds great in that lower register when she sings YOU'LL COME AROUND
 
**radiofan15** (8.1): Another solid and unpretentious deep cut that I can enjoy without regrets
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7.8): I want to rate this lower but ugh I liked it
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): I like the drums on this
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Musically, Miley’s album in this rate is actually quite similar to Demi’s, but the problem here is that a saddening number of songs on Breakout fail to achieve the individuality a lot of the deep cuts off Don’t Forget do; maybe I’m just not accustomed to country as I am to rock, but Full Circle is the first example of this I can think of. It’s fun to listen to and easy to remember, but there’s nothing distinctive to it and I’d rather just let it be. That being said, circles?! Magic circles?! Is Miley a Satanic witch?!
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): the bridge brings it up half a point
 
**waluigiest** (7): this song predicted the Malibu saga
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (5.1): okay that opening production was interesting, but the whole thing together is just a mess and that drumline is in literally every single song from this era. this is so generic it hurts.
 
**ggodisawomann** (3): eh
 
**Johnnytoby** (3): I'm getting a sense this album was made for the midwest

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (9): I love the drums
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): This bops quite a bit, the bridge is a highlight
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): honestly forgot how much this slaps forgive me lord
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Demi takes us on another really fun romp with Gonna Get Caught, which is, sure, still your typical pop rock fare, but the reason why we all miss pop rock was it because it tended to be a bundle of fun filled with magical girl power, and this is a bundle of fun filled with magical girl power, gosh darn it. While there are even higher standards Demi sets for herself with Don’t Forget, Gonna Get Caught is still a great example of her absolutely chewing somebody out, a feat that she does with fierceness the other acts here don’t quite manage. That may be what she’s famous for today, but, hey, I ain’t complaining.
 
**nightjesus** (7.5): This song is the song that would be playing in the background during a coming of age summer road trip in California.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): it's fine
 
**radiofan15** (6.7): Is this filler?
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): Me when the parents get home!
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): why did i think this was going to be about demi getting caught fucking somebody
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (4): Demi can fucking sing
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (3.2): what the FUCK is this.

**Roxieloxie** (8): An opening track that sounds like it play in the opening of a DCOM, I'd say that's a pretty good opener for this rate
 
**followingfreeways** (7): i see how this could be relatable for a 13 yr old
 
---
 
**nightjesus** (10): What a god damn bop. A flawless song. Fun fact I used to daydream that I was singing this song at a camp karaoke and people were going off. 2008 was a simple year.
 
**radiofan15** (10): This is the exact type of generic and safe pop rock that I love.
 
**selegend** (10): katy perry fucking won with this
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Of course Miley has the generic teenage rebel anthem in this rate! Why am I not shocked? To be fair, compared to everything from Can’t Be Tamed onward, this is pretty mild, but what surprises me about this song is that Miley sings it like she’s actually invested in how she’s growing up; there’s nothing I can actually call mature here, obviously, but if you’d give Breakout to another Disney star, with Demi as a sole exception, I’d write it off as manufactured resistance. Miley is, for some reason, capable of getting through that bias. I’m not a big fan of her music in this rate, but perhaps this was a sign of good things yet to come.
 
**iloveneonlights** (8): Katy's version is superior
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): This is a good opening track but I feel like it could've bopped harder.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok I know this is for kids but this song is like legitimately only able to be enjoyed by kids?
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (6.8): I loved the beat, but I had to knock it down a few points for the lyrics, also the more I listened to the other songs the lower this became LEL
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Definitely a fun summer bop when you are 12
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): def not my fave off this album but it has a nice melody and I'm a sucker for pop rock
 
**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): cute little bop to open
 
**akanewasright** (5): I do not believe a lyric of this song coming out of Miley’s mouth. The pop rock feel is cool, but there’s something a little... off about it.
 
**oliveoilgarlic** (5): I woke up to this song every day at 6am for a few months in middle school and getting up at 8am sounded like heaven
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (4.5): ‘getting up at eight am’s crazy’ lmaoooo i feel seen!! real talk, though, any high school themed song is a special kind of hell and i can’t take them seriously. like. i feel the same way about taylor on ‘fifteen’. stop making me think about trauma!
 
**sleepypeach-** (4): i totally forgot this song had so many school references.
 
**waluigiest** (3): production reminiscent of The Sims OST x relatability of Rebecca Black’s Friday

**nightjesus** (10): Song aside I was thirsting for Cole Sprouse in this photoshoot for 'Friends for Change'. 14 year old me was shook. Any who I always laugh at Kevin's like one line. But iconic. The video clip is nostalga overload. Nick and Miley, Demi and Joe? Selena and Keven fake singing the background vocals in the chores? Ugh. The simpler times.
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): we love a T Swift penned bop!
 
**selegend** (10): poor selena getting paired with kevin
 
**waluigiest** (8): this is really the Smash Ultimate of this rate wow
 
**radiofan15** (7.9): This is actually quite solid for a charity single made for a child audience… although Selena was done dirty by the producers in this song.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): It’s Disney’s We Are The World, but this time the song doesn’t even have a specific goal in mind! This is pretty much as generic as you can get, huh? Legitimately, the only reason why this exists is because of star power. Did this even raise any money at all? Well, did it? Send it On is lucky that everybody on  it is actually charismatic, because otherwise, it would be pretty damn intolerable.
 
**akanewasright** (6): Ugh, preachy charity singles are only slightly more tolerable with Disney stars.

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): Fun fact, I actually had this song on my ipod nano
 
---
 
**radiofan15** (10): Among all of the rap collectives that formed in the last decade, 2 Guys n the Parque is definitely my favorite thanks to their conscious lyricism and strong metaphors, even when they have received some underserved criticism for it (I still remember the outcry around their pro-life anthem Date at the Water Park and how they were banned from some radio stations thanks to their anti-institutional racism ballad Mac n Cheese in Heaven), and this song is not an exception… the decision of using Candace as a guest vocalist in this song about the treatment of the Russian government of its LGBT citizens is brilliant given Candace's status as a gay icon, and of course how on point those lyrics are… a special shout-out to the Trump diss and the unexpected Planned Parenthood line.

**selegend** (9): honestly selena has held true to this message
 
**1998tweety** (8): This slaps, a message we stan
 
**waluigiest** (8): who knew they had a sad club banger?? kind of. Best friend line is a classic
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): Fortunately, Kiss and Tell has the decency to have good songs once in awhile, and I Won’t Apologize comes mercifully early for being one of them. This follows Disney’s formula for self-love anthems down to a tee, even including the euphoric choruses that really make those songs actually work, and for everything Selena fails to execute on Kiss and Tell, past some obvious issues the entire record shares, she doesn’t do anything wrong here. It may be a minature Who Says, but honestly, it’s the better song.
 
**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7.4): The way she says apologize is so interesting lol
 
**akanewasright** (7): On the one hand, I think this song is much more in Selena’s wheelhouse. On the other hand, I very much believe she helped write these lyrics... oof.
 
**nightjesus** (7): This song is really cute but her voice is one hundred percent auto tuned. Still a bop.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): the chorus sounds like something that could be on one of her other two albums with the scene
 
**radiofan15** (6.9): WOW Selerna sweetie... this is bland, you couldn't even keep a streak of strong openers like the other albums on this rate.
 
**gowestyoungkanye** (6.2): this was? jarring???? is this an album of 6s????????
