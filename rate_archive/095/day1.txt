I mean...are we surprised? No. Was this robbed? No. Bhad Bhabie's debut single, while I like it a bit more than most of you all did, just isn't very good. Ms. Bregoli's debut single is soulless and uninspired. The beat / bass slaps, but unfortunately her bars and delivery don't match and it got a well-deserved bottom placement in this rate.  

Favorite Line(s) - All ya'll look like you still fly Spirit

---

#If you don't like this, you can cash me outside how bout dat

**radiofan15** (10): A CULTURAL RESET

**bandnitos** (9): this goes off i can't lie

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.8): if this was sung by any other rapper i would be obsessed - great beat, catchy chorus - but the fact she sounds 12 kind of kills it for me. i still like it tho, i still like it

**1998tweety** (8): Slaps

**materialqirl** (8): my personal fave of hers

**Nickl00** (8): I‚Äôve also loved this song just based on her delivery on the hook

**yoshifan823** (8): I still have a very distinct memory of the first time I heard this song it took a few listens to really process it but now I love it. It‚Äôs the distilled essence of a mean 16 year old girl and it slaps

**HerculesMeow** (7): I wish this masterpiece was longer

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): At this point I‚Äôm starting to believe that the ‚Äúcash me outside‚Äù Dr. Phil appearance was a genius masterstroke of Warholian branding. Like, BB was designed in a lab by Atlantic Records and they (not her mother) booked her on the show as the perfect way to go viral and introduce her to the world.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i shouldn't like this but that bass really satisfies me

**waluigiest** (7): hate to admit it this ones kinda funny

**untutorable** (6.5): i hope bhad bhabie says hi bich to me someday

#Bye Bich

**worlds-okayest666** (6): im starting to notice a pattern with bhad bhabie‚Äôs music.

**PointlessBibliophage** (5.5): when she said "please stop" i maybe, just maybe, low key felt that

**AnimationJava** (5): more bass i guess

**ignitethephoenix** (5): the beat go hard but we really have to rate this teen ?

**twat\_brained** (5): why did we drive Ayesha Erotica away just so we could pretend this clout chaser has talent

**wavingwolves** (5): why this spelling of bitch sends me so much... it's so funny that i'm giving it a 5 just for making me laugh because the song itself is... hummmmm... well, it exists

**rotating3Dtext** (4.8): points for the beat??¬ø?

**rickikardashian** (4): this is another half made song. [this is funny tho](https://i.imgur.com/PxQnUfR.png)

**effervescentemu** (3.5): Bye bich

**laurent1683** (3): This one is like her second single and it shows. This bass does not work, I hate to say it, but she's no X.

**steelstepladder** (3): Bhad Bhabie is not escaping day one is she?

**CritneySpearz** (2): make it stop...

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): bye bitch üòî

**skargardin** (2): gorl....

**stryxen** (2): I don‚Äôt like this song but giving it a 0 is too easy

**Awkward\_King** (1): y.

**bespectacIed** (1): her enunciation is so bad

**kappyko** (1): Danielle Bregoli is BHAD BHABIE... well she better stop being!

**starlitsuns** (1): all I have gotten from listening to Bhad Barbie for this rate is that she flaunts wealth and sounds like she hasn‚Äôt changed much from her appearance on Dr. Phil

**akanewasright** (0): This song is soulless, and not in a fun ‚ÄúI sold my soul to satan lol‚Äù way. I hate her Iggy Azealia impression, and it‚Äôs even worse because at least Iggy isn‚Äôt trying to look like she‚Äôs black or anything.

**bbfan132** (0): so‚Ä¶ what now?

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this literally sounds like an awful rap song that would be a meme in 2011 and then annoying freshman would ‚Äúironically‚Äù stan

**lapascalia** (0): bye bitch

Well, here she is again. I think this was a tad robbed. I've always liked this song, though it still is a tad lifeless / uninspired just as Hi Bich was, though it is certainly an improvement over the former. Also, Lil Yachty just doesn't do it for me here. Even ignoring the fact he's a m*n (so you know Popheads already will hate it), his verse just wasn't good so no surprises here that this song got a low Day 1 placement (though I'm still slightly fuming).

Favorite Line(s) - Take a picture, get your issue, bitch'll die on my word

---

#Diamond drippin' off of the clock

**radiofan15** (10): The levels of talent emanating from this song... Nicki and Ari have been found dead...

**selegend** (9): bop

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): the milkman ended her career. but i hate that I like this. the doorbell beat is really unique and the chorus is really catchy. theres not any substance but i do like it for what it is.

**laurent1683** (8): Absolute banger, she's so charismatic and the beat is surprisingly detailed. Lil Yachty kinds always sucks when rapping though

**rosecoloreds** (8): BUT only because my best friend randomly requested it at an almost empty club and the dj wouldn't play it

**materialqirl** (7.5): ngl the music vid slapped

**awhile2** (7): the gucci influence on this hook is insane. Like she could be a culture vulture but it sure seems like she or her marketing team or whoever did research to try and make her come across as authentic as possible given her background

**bandnitos** (7): its aight

**Nickl00** (7): this rate may make me listen to more bhad bhabie tbh

**rickikardashian** (7): this is an unfinished song tbh but i have good memories with it, and the line ‚Äúfuck it, hit your bitch in my socks‚Äù is hilarious

**wardrum5** (7): Lil yachty is awful honestly

**pjones3416** (6): surprisingly good

**untutorable** (6): lil yachty's verse is not it

**worlds-okayest666** (6): again...bops at first but goes nowhere

#No üñ§ but i fwu for trying

**stryxen** (5.5): decent but I can‚Äôt remember this song after listening to it

**lapascalia** (5): yachty sounds like he‚Äôs falling asleep in this one lmao

**PointlessBibliophage** (5): there's a joke to be made here about how "flop" is right there in the title

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): i can't get over the fact she sounds 5 in this and the chorus is so basic, i could do better

**rotating3Dtext** (4.5): fuck I don‚Äôt understand this either I‚ÄôM OLD

**1998tweety** (4): Meh, I don't care for the beat at all.

**akanewasright** (4): ...I hate that I can kinda vibe to this. The beat is pretty solid, even though I fucking HATE that looped melody or whatever.

**twat\_brained** (4): notice how the other white rapper in this rate is *not* rapping in a blaccent and acting "hood"? take notes.

**bbfan132** (3.5): this isn‚Äôt horrible, it‚Äôs just bland and repetitive

**skargardin** (3): no thanks

**starlitsuns** (3): Danielle is seriously talking like a SWERF when she said that bitches who are fucking for cash are trash. I can‚Äôt support that behavior.

**Sundraliz** (3): what is this song about

**waluigiest** (3): this is so lazy

**bespectacIed** (2): okay beat wasted on bhad babie

**CritneySpearz** (2): make it stop..

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this is so annoying

**nootnoot781** (2): oh my god if you‚Äôre going to appropriate black culture at least do it well.

**plastichaxan** (2): this is obnoxious huh

**steelstepladder** (2): I just don't have the energy to care.

**kappyko** (1): sorry i watched the video for it and its legit racist

**Awkward\_King** (0): why

**wavingwolves** (0): she wanted her own gucci gang and she made it! doesn't mean it's any good though

We have arrived at the first TikTok hit to be eliminated and I am not the least bit surprised it is this one. I personally think it *kinda* goes off but I can see why lots of you were put off by the screaming. Rico definitely did the whole angry shtick much better than Miss Klit did with this song I wish the iconic "I smell cap" part was done a bit more throughout the song. Also, obligatory comment on that disturbing single cover and music video

Favorite Line(s) - *Inhales* ah, I smell cap

---

#I smell cap 

**bandnitos** (10): an 11 contender

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): omg what is this song sksksksk i love it

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): inhale i smell cap KDJKSDJKJDKAJLDKSD

**hunnybee12** (9): uh O_O

**materialqirl** (9): WHY YO LYIN ON YO DICK LYIN ON YO DICK

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this goes off hard

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): It‚Äôs disappointing that her more recent tracks lack this energy.

**wavingwolves** (8): big musty coochie energy

**starlitsuns** (7.5): I thought that this was on TikTok at some point and then I heard the screaming chorus/bridge, so this gets points for iconicness.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.2): first of all, ma‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt even know you like that

**bulforster** (7): Her delivery is great but the lyrics not so much, I can't really figure out what "lying on your dick" means.

**kappyko** (7): i mean yeah we needed a full tac song somewhere i guess. this is fine

**lapascalia** (7): i kind of feel attacked by this song but it also kind of slaps

**skargardin** (7): go off

**steelstepladder** (7): It's good but I feel like this is Rico Nasty but worse

**stryxen** (6.5): I feel like I should apologise to her

**untutorable** (6.5): this is my first time listening to miss klit and i love how terrifying this is

**mayolizard** (6): hmm ahhh i smell cap

**Nickl00** (6): another song I recognized from tik tok, it‚Äôs ok

#Fuck you, your momma, and your kids

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): i don't hate it but not a fan of the "scream" rapping, it's too abrasive for me but i guess thats the point

**akanewasright** (5): I truly think that the one bar that went viral is the one really good bar from the song. Thank god it‚Äôs repeated so much. My good friend made a political TikTok to this song (that i think she deleted) that made me like it more, but the video made me kinda hate it.

**bbfan132** (5): i don‚Äôt know how to feel about this

**waluigiest** (5): uh mess

**yoshifan823** (5): makes me uncomfortable which I guess is the point?

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): did this blow up i recognise the chorus?

**awhile2** (4): everything about this song confuses me

**ImADudeDuh** (4): why does this give me Natalie Portman‚Äôs rap vibes

**rickikardashian** (4): tiktok already used the only 15 seconds that are worth listening to

**selegend** (4): well it‚Äôs interesting

**Sundraliz** (4): Unrelated to the music but I can tell by the shooting/editing that this video is the same person that did Where's My Juul. Shoutout to Full Tac.

**AnimationJava** (2.5): cupcakke clone

**1998tweety** (2): This sounds like a Cupcakke song but without what makes a Cupcakke song good.

**bespectacIed** (2): the punk aspect of it is kinda cool i guess

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): this sounds exactly like the 12 year olds who've yelled at me on xbox üòî

**twat\_brained** (2): this cover art scares me and so does this song. that's not a good thing because it feels like she's trying to bring shock value despite the lack of talent. Luckily for BK, her blushes will be spared since she is neither Belcalis nor Danielle.

**laurent1683** (1): She sounds and looks like Coi Leray, but sucks. Also, why is Coi not here, Huddy and Good Day and great songs

**radiofan15** (1): Bitch don't even have a Wikipedia page and her style is more annoying than a 15-year-old Rihanna singing Mariah Carey... why are we rating her?!?

**ignitethephoenix** (0): can I dock extra points for this song cover lol. But I didn‚Äôt really like this at all

The first Cardi song of the rate is out. It's not a bad song per se, but coming off of Finesse, this was a very bland and very safe collab between the two and ya'll tore it apart for it. 

Favorite Line(s) - Your pussy basura, my pussy horchata

---

#Horchata 

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): underrated! the beat is surprisingly layered and complex and i love the slow jam vibe

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): your pussy basura my pussy horchata i'm

**lapascalia** (9): it‚Äôs groovy

**stryxen** (9): Bruno Mars will never stop annoying me, but I still like everything about this and cardi eats it up

**wavingwolves** (9): cardi is the best part of everything she does but bruno shines quite a bit here

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): finesse remix outsold but this is cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.2): It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs good but it‚Äôs so expected I‚Äôm not really excited by it.

**Awkward\_King** (8): hi bruno mars please fuck me

**laurent1683** (8): This bridge is something else. r/popheads, start loving Bruno Mars, please

**twat\_brained** (7.3): this was on the radio for like what, 3 months? I forget. just like I forgot that people cared about Cardi lol she is incredibly lucky Bruno is here to help her save face

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): your pussy basura

**1998tweety** (7): Meh rehash of Finesse Remix

**alwayswords** (7): bruno munching

**bbfan132** (7): i should like this more than i do but parts of this are kind of messy/disjointed

**hunnybee12** (7): this just made me miss bruno :( we need you short king

**worlds-okayest666** (7): i feel like i should like this more than i actually do

**yoshifan823** (7): it‚Äôs good but not as good as the Finesse remix

**AnimationJava** (6.5): meh,,, i prefer finnesse tbh

**starlitsuns** (6.5): This song really doesn‚Äôt have the magic that the Finesse remix has, but it‚Äôs still fun to listen to.

**bespectacIed** (6): Unlike Finesse, in which Cardi carried, Bruno carried this. This is so fucking dry though!

**bulforster** (6): This is fine, but very safe for these two.

**waluigiest** (6): this woozy

#Basura 

**mayolizard** (5.5): tried to be finesse but. No. basura line is dope tho

**akanewasright** (4): ...it‚Äôs okay.

**bandnitos** (4): you'll never be finesse remix

**kappyko** (4): its fine idk why everyone thought this was So bad when it came out

**Nickl00** (4): god finesse is so much better

**nootnoot781** (4): this a friendly reminder that the finesse remix should‚Äôve gone number one

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): finesse was 100 times better, i will not willingly listen to this song

**untutorable** (4): i know this is a rate about women but i love you bruno mars!!! anyway i sleep

**PointlessBibliophage** (3): tbh i haven't liked anything new involving bruno mars in the last couple of years

**steelstepladder** (3): Surprisingly forgettable. This was in the 40 biggest songs of 2019? Really?

**wardrum5** (3): annoying! Very glad they both vanished for like two years after this came out

**CritneySpearz** (2): makes me uncomfortable, i h8 heteros

**CreepyMannequin** (1): Cardi‚Äôs parts are fine but Bruno‚Ä¶.should not be allowed to make music after this

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): a poor mans finesse üòî

**ImADudeDuh** (1): ‚Äúyour pussy basura, my pussy horchata‚Äù is iconic but the rest of the song is so obviously trying to be finesse 2: the re-up

**materialqirl** (1): gorl-

#Drop a lil check everybody lit

**1998tweety** (10): Okay this unironically goes hard af.

**radiofan15** (9.5): Her flow!!!! Nicki wishes...

**hikkaru** (9): why does this slap LKDFJGLKFJDG

**InfernalSolstice** (8.5): why does this go so hard i'm so ashamed

**twat\_brained** (8.2): wait why does this slap Danielle learned how to carry a flow and keep up with Tory. Color me impressed.

**awhile2** (8): gets way too much hate. I mean she probably has ghostwriters cause her bars are that good but she can flow really well too

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): I may be hypocritical as I wrote this long-ass screed on the sub about how Bhad Bhabie being signed to a record label is basically everything that‚Äôs wrong with the music industry - but even I have to admit that this kind of slaps.

**laurent1683** (8): I'm impressed. Also, Tory Lanez is my kind of man

**sawayamas** (8): I find all her music to be a joke but this is actually a bop ngl

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this does go hard ngl probably her best track

**PointlessBibliophage** (7.5): this kinda slaps i guess

**starlitsuns** (7): Songs like this are the reason I don‚Äôt talk about money in public. Thank you Bhad Barbie for the casual reminder to continue.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): tbh i hate Tory Lanez's voice which ruins the song for me but Bhad Babie doesn't sound 12 which is a big plus and the chorus slaps

**TiltControls** (7): I'm really not a fan of her other tracks so I was surprised this was halfway decent

**yoshifan823** (7): the fully evolved version of Kreyshawn can spit

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): she kinda goes in but also quite generic

**akanewasright** (2): Tory Lanez brings some life into this song. He‚Äôs the only reason this isn‚Äôt a 1 or 0.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.667): I‚Äôve been saying since she first was signed that I don‚Äôt like how Bhad Bhabie gets to have a rap career just because it‚Äôs easier for people to stan someone they‚Äôre already vaguely familiar rather than, like, actual musical talent.

While cupcakKe's specialty is over-the-top explicit songs such as this one, Vagina is one of the weaker ones in her catalogue. The slurping is fun but after awhile it gets pretty annoying. While the song itself isn't up to her usual standard, I will forever be grateful for all of the iconic remixes this song has spawned.

Favorite Line(s) - Juggle them balls in my mouth, deep throat circus // Its Niagara Falls in this pussy all day

#cupcakKe's CashApp

**bbfan132** (10): these bars are perfection - once again it‚Äôs sad that the video was probably taken down :/

**bespectacIed** (10): I fucking love her

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the slurping sounds i-

**radiofan15** (10): The Wizard of Waverly Place mash-up outsold... but this is still iconic

**twat\_brained** (10): the most surprisingly versatile rap performance in existence. that in and of itself is 10-worthy

**materialqirl** (9.5): remind ya im kinda wet runnin down my v

**CritneySpearz** (9): the amount of iconic remixes this song has provided... STREAM CHAINED TO MY VAGINA (c*mmin in my ass like A WASTED ZOMBIE) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1DcfZlebQA

**worlds-okayest666** (9): this is really good but i cant give it a 10 bc the production is so plain...although maybe all the mashups have just ruined it for me

**akanewasright** (8): This song is so weird to hear with the real instrumental. I honestly don‚Äôt really like the beat, but the rap itself is SO iconic.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Giving this a good score solely because of that CupcakKe remixes channel that creates magic with this song‚Ä¶ [‚ÄúStupid Cum‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkQJ_1obyE0) is an 11.

**untutorable** (8): i love how explicit she is i really do

**1998tweety** (7.5): Again, the chorus slaps but the rest of the song drags. The remixes of this song are iconic though.

**stryxen** (7.5): I‚Äôm dissociating <3 this is a fever dream

**bandnitos** (7): i don't like the beat but i can't give it a bad score

**wavingwolves** (7): not to be tmi but "niagara falls in this pussy all day" is a very relatable lyrics i'm feelin seen

**rickikardashian** (6.8): most mashups using this song are better than the original tbh

**AnimationJava** (6.5): running down my vagina

#Remixes outslurped

**GHdayum** (6): although i prefer all the remixes of this song by Cupcakke Remixes!

**hikkaru** (6): the way every single cupcakke remix with this song outbops the original

**kappyko** (6): damn i know why so many people made mashups with this song now because the original beat is FUCKING ASS

**Nickl00** (6): pretty repetitive and the production really lets the song down

**steelstepladder** (6): Kind of a diet version of Deepthroat but it's still good

**waluigiest** (6): much more tired than her other songs. Still great delivery but the wordplay and energy is lacking

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.8): "slurp that dick till it come" has been stuck in my head all damn month

**rotating3Dtext** (4.8): I- the sounds are too much sorry

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4): the chorus is catchy but im bored.

**skargardin** (4): this bores me to no end

**starlitsuns** (4): who let cupcakKe have some of the most explicit imagery out there? because I can‚Äôt handle this

**laurent1683** (2): This one doesn't cause any feeling for me

**TiltControls** (1): I'm sorry I just cannot get over the slurping

Another song that blew up on TikTok. The chorus is extremely catchy, but the verses don't do it for me. Kamaiyah just sounds so...bored, and it resulted in a fairly dull track. Also YG wasn't needed (Blackpink tease)

**akanewasright** (7): This was fun.

**alwayswords** (7): [insert joke about blackpink and yg ent]

**Nickl00** (7): I really didn‚Äôt know this was by her but it‚Äôs pretty good

**radiofan15** (5.6): She sounds tired...

**lapascalia** (5): kinda meh

**waluigiest** (5): this song is crowded with mediocre ideas

**bulforster** (4): I'm not getting a lot of personality from this.

**laurent1683** (4): She sounds buried. Also, no proper capitalization in the song name and YG's name don't help the song very low sound quality

**CritneySpearz** (3): hmm no.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Okay every time I see YG I think about YG Entertainment, like, the Kpop company, and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúdamn he gets around.‚Äù Anyways this song is dull.

**steelstepladder** (2): Wow this song sounds right out of 2013 but it's the production these lyrics deserve

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): children on tik tok really be crip walking to a blood song üíÄ not this.

**stryxen** (0): I HATE the constant AY in the background and I don‚Äôt like the rest of the song :/

I know everyone hates this song, but it is my fav Cardi song drag me idc idc. There's just something about it that I LOVE. Also, of course there's the iconic DING DONGGGG line. In addition to the song being an absolute banger, one of her best videos to date accompanies it. Definitely fuming a lil bit over this robbery.

Favorite Line(s) - DING DONG must be that whip that I ordered

---

#DING DONG...must be that bop that I ordered

**starlitsuns** (10): whoever made Cardi write this song has some explaining to do

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): the DING DONG sends me every single time

**kappyko** (9): oh shit where did this come from

**InfernalSolstice** (8.5): overhated

**1998tweety** (8): A gift for the fans

**skargardin** (8): I've got to say that she did pop off here

**akanewasright** (7.5): Not gonna lie, the ‚Äúpress press press press press‚Äù hook has stuck with me from my first listen, and I did not give two shits about this song at first. Like, that‚Äôs a great hook that deserved better.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): she snapped here for sure but I don‚Äôt find it has much replay-ability

**bespectacIed** (7): it's a fun song. But nicki outsold the entire song with one line from good form "see a bitch got more press than a keypad"

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this doesn‚Äôt feel like it lasted 4 months on the chart

**Nickl00** (7): the press press press part is kinda epic which was unexpected but it works well with her delivery

**stryxen** (7): nicki stans HATE this song, so I rated it just a bit higher <3

**alwayswords** (6): sounds unfinished

**bandnitos** (6): the intro before the bass and hi hats come in sounds like a y2k girl song

**hunnybee12** (6): the scene in the video with dozens of naked dead girls (with no nipples?) genuinely ruined my day. why

**pjones3416** (6): that ding dong lyric...no ma‚Äôam

**selegend** (6): she kinda fell off huh

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): i liked this song enough to add it to my playlist but the effect wore off v fast

**untutorable** (6): DING DOOOOOONG this one is fun ngl i think she's trying to be serious but it's really goofy and that's why i like it

#DING DONG...must be that shit that I ordered

**bbfan132** (5.5): i don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúpress press press press press‚Äù part but the beat‚Äôs nice

**bulforster** (5): The vaguely orchestral beat is different but the elements of the song don't really work together.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I love how she attacks this song and the music video is really cool but as a song it‚Äôs flat and uninteresting. This is one of those songs that wouldn‚Äôt exist if not for the charisma of the performer.

**HerculesMeow** (5): Worst Cardi song

**worlds-okayest666** (5): this grew on me a bit but her voice is so grating on this jesus christ

**AnimationJava** (4): not a great comeback moment and it's clear to me why it's been radio silence from her about a lead single since

**laurent1683** (4): She has nothing in her life that would make her worthy of an epic anthem full of fake rage like that. But I really like the drums when it goes : POP UP GUESS WHO BITCH

**mayolizard** (4): this is her most annoying song i think

**sawayamas** (4): this song always kills me because I just hear Doja's voice of her singing to this in my head but was never really a fan of this one.. it's messy

**steelstepladder** (4): I remember when this was released... I also remember two days later when I stopped listening

**Awkward\_King** (3): ding dong

**CritneySpearz** (3): I do like Cardi as a person, but honestly this song is just boring af and cringe??!>

**nootnoot781** (3): however i must thank the song solely for that video of doja cat mocking it. ding dong

**twat\_brained** (3): "Cardi don't need no press". Between that and her support of Bernie Sanders I can't say I agree with her on any other matters. And I can't say I'm interested in seeing news about her anymore either lol

**lapascalia** (2): i just really don‚Äôt like it

**wavingwolves** (2): a mess luv

I initially hated this song and only liked the chorus (the part that was all over TikTok) but after listening to this a few more times it REALLY grew on me. I'm dead at how at least for the Spotify version, the very beginning line of the hook gets cut off, as some of you pointed out.

**CritneySpearz** (7): UMM THIS SONG ASKDSAKDAK

**rickikardashian** (6.5): honest the chorus is fun for the duration of whatever tiktok uses it, but it gets tired p quick, the rest of the song is fun

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.3): This sounds like a nursery rhyme, like, did she sample ‚ÄúKnick-Knack Paddywhack?‚Äù

**bulforster** (6): The nursery rhyme chorus is cute but she sounds out of her depth when she's rapping.

**stryxen** (6): tiktok has made me hate this chorus but I still like the song

#Got scammed by fake Grindr sugar daddies

**ignitethephoenix** (5): the song is meh but she made several points

**yoshifan823** (2): did no one learn a lesson from ‚ÄúDo Your Chain Hang Low?‚Äù Two points for that Sega Genesis-ass beat though

I hate the production on this song so much, but the lyrics just elevate it so much. It's Cardi at her most raw and honest, totally going in on Offset and his habits of cheating (though she still is putting the pussy on Offset). I do think it would have *sounded* better if she had someone else sing the hook, but then it would have taken away from the honesty and vulnerability of the track, so I'm glad she chose to sing it despite not being too much of a vocalist. 

Favorite Line(s) - Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it // Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit

#Wii Shop who?

**CritneySpearz** (9): i love wii music

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I feel like this will be out relatively early (I‚Äôm guess maybe Day 2?) but it‚Äôs low-key my favorite Cardi song in the rate. I think it was really bold of her to, at this point in her career, put out something so vulnerable, not to mention harsh and unpolished sounding. She said that she could have gotten someone to sing the hook but chose not to and I respect the decision because it transforms this song from a generic ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fuck with me‚Äù song into something with a lot of layers. Despite the lyrical content you can hear the trepidation and almost sadness in her voice; for all of her bluster you can hear that she‚Äôs scared of losing him. Celebrities often parlay relationship drama into publicity and success but I really don‚Äôt think that was the case here, something about this feel genuine.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): easily one of her most meaningful songs. sis was hurt, this sound seems so cathartic.

**1998tweety** (8.5): It's cute, I dragged it on release but in hindsight it does a good job showing another side of Cardi.

**akanewasright** (8): The SNL performance of this was one of the most iconic pop culture moments of 2018. I actually really love the song too. It‚Äôs pretty vulnerable by Cardi‚Äôs standards, and the beat is memorable in a way a lot of modern hip-hop beats aren‚Äôt.

**rickikardashian** (8): shit this beat is nice, i don‚Äôt know how i hadn't heard this before

**stryxen** (8): I love any song with lyrics that demolish someone without insulting them

**waluigiest** (8): this little chord progression slaps

**AnimationJava** (7.5): her singing takes away from it but i still like the lyrics a lot and it's catchy -- also the pregnancy reveal moment on SNL simply iconic

**bbfan132** (7.5): grew off me ngl

**kappyko** (7): i really wanted to like this more

**lapascalia** (7): not bad

**steelstepladder** (7): Some cool lyrics and Cardi delivers her lines well but I really wish she had a stronger beat.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i've always felt like something is missing from this song but goddamn i've never been able to figure out what

**yoshifan823** (7): ‚ÄúI can't believe that after she sang this song, Offset still went and cheated on her.‚Äù I agree, random Youtube commenter

**agentofscranton** (6): this beat do be sounding like the wii shop channel tho

**bandnitos** (6): it could do more

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I don‚Äôt really like Cardi‚Äôs singing voice here but I appreciate she tried something different

**laurent1683** (6): Her rapping voice in this song is very weak. The "fuck him, suck his dick" line also breaks the mood

**SideBTrack8** (6): RIP Wii shop channel

**starlitsuns** (6): Polyamory is only okay when both sides consent to it

**twat\_brained** (6): well, clearly this warning wasn't enough since Offset cheated lmao you can't convince anyone with a minimal drum beat behind a panflute instrumental

**worlds-okayest666** (6): there‚Äôs a production effect or sumn used on this that makes it sound like there‚Äôs someone talking loudly in another room it freaks me out and i hate it. also its just kinda boring

#Offset stans

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): is cardi just shouting words in spanish

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): i got the [fresh] thread for this and then struggled to remember any part of it despite it becoming a decently sized hit

**alwayswords** (5): forgettable

**hunnybee12** (5): why didn‚Äôt she get a feature to sing the chorus‚Ä¶ like literally anybody‚Ä¶.

**mayolizard** (5): underwhelming

**Nickl00** (5): her singing is ok but I still find the song annoying

**skargardin** (5): eh

**untutorable** (4.5): a bit boring for cardi tbh, i'm so used to her more intense verses but it's fine

**Awkward\_King** (4): i like the production ?

**bulforster** (4): I appreciate her wanting to explore a different topic lyrically but Cardi is... not a singer.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): He really cheated on her and she made this song and thought ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough fighting with him for today <3‚Äù

**nootnoot781** (4): the fact that nice for what was released a week after this still sends me. drake said miss lauryn hill will not be disrespected in this house YUP

**wardrum5** (4): not a fan

**bespectacIed** (3): Bars so cringey, cardi's ghostwriter did her dirty I think. The Ex-factor sample was so weak, we all know Nice for What did it better, but I kinda still bopped lol. This serving as warning to Offset's cheating works as effectively as a wicker facemask against coronavirus

**sawayamas** (0): her worst song ever.. idk what she was trying to do with it

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): a little boring (i blame big sean and hes like 2/3 of the song). kash doll's verse though - they go so hard. I wish the song was only her.

**Nickl00** (5): I‚Äôve heard songs where I liked kash doll, this is not one of them

This song is certainly....something. I'm torn between hating it and thinking it goes off, and I think I'm leaning toward the banger side of it so I gave it a 6. The fact that half the lyrics are incoherent sentences sends me. The highlight was definitely the outro with her randomly screaming...a mood.

This song isn't bad but within this rate it really falls into the background. Summer was nice on the chorus, but the song is still overall pretty boring. As Kash Doll said in the song, I got all my edges. My wig remains unmoved. I'm a little shook this went farther than Ready Set

**selegend** (10): that chorus is godly

**akanewasright** (9): I remember in the late 00‚Äôs and early 10‚Äôs, there were a bunch of emotional rap ballads that had a male singer on the hook, and this feels like a gender swapped version of that.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): the power duo i never knew i needed. it makes me wish cardi did more songs that were a bit softer. they both ate.

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is a cute song!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Kehlani definitely makes this song better

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): cardi and kehlani work really well off each other

**1998tweety** (8): A cute lil bop

**lapascalia** (8): kehlani sounds great

**laurent1683** (8): This should have been the third single instead of Be Careful

**twat\_brained** (8): I may need to give Kehlani a second chance, she's making Cardi tolerable here

**wavingwolves** (8): cool

**worlds-okayest666** (8): a bop but kehlani kinda carries this tbh

**rickikardashian** (7.8): this is a kehlani song featuring cardi

**starlitsuns** (7.5): note to self do not let Cardi B become needy

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): cardi and kehlani don't have great chemistry but their individual parts are good

**bespectacIed** (7): An RnB song in a rap rate, I dig a lil bit. Kehlani voice so good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I believe it was Albert Einstein who once said that it was an immutable law of nature that if Kehlani is on the track she‚Äôs the best part. Unfortunately she isn‚Äôt really given a ton to work with here, she sells what she can but this chorus isn‚Äôt that interesting and Cardi is just like, there.

**mayolizard** (7): the chorus saves this from being boring

**bandnitos** (6): im bored

#Yawn

**AnimationJava** (5.5): i overall feel meh about this song

**bulforster** (5.5): Kehlani carries this, her voice is so much more expressive than Cardi's.

**PointlessBibliophage** (5.5): CAST IT INTO THE FIRE

**Nickl00** (5): I‚Äôve always been meh on Kehlani and I think she makes the song worse

**skargardin** (5): eh

**steelstepladder** (5): One of the more forgettable Cardi tracks here. Fine as background I guess.

**stryxen** (5): I know this is good but it‚Äôs just not for me

**untutorable** (5): the hook of this one gets stuck in my head quite a bit but i really don't ever remember any of cardi's part and it's pretty boring oop

**yoshifan823** (5): everyone go listen to It Was Good Until It Wasn‚Äôt

**materialqirl** (4.5): alright but brung down by cardi

**ImADudeDuh** (4): https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Zq-EafLnDh8/maxresdefault.jpg

**kappyko** (4): ew the autotuned cardi isnt good

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i like kehlani generally and some of cardi's music but for some reason this song doesn't work for me at all

This is such an earworm, I love it. I was a little surprised that a lot of you didn't. Their delivery on this is so full of sass and confidence and I love the talking chorus over the beat. It just works so well for me.

**untutorable** (6.5): this one is an anthem. it honestly makes me feel a little threatened and i don't even have a man for them to take

It's sending me that this song made it this far. It honestly goes off despite being a meme song, and I'm glad it almost survived Day 1. For awhile it was in the top 20 but then the bad scores started rolling in and it dropped down significantly over the course of the month. The lyrics in this are so funny and clever, and I hope Doja makes more fun songs like this in the future.

Favorite Line(s) - Old MacDonald had a farm., I give him a titty tryna keep him calm // Got the methane, I'm a farter // I ain't in the city 'cause they ain't got lawns

---

#Old MacDonald had a bop

**Awkward\_King** (10): im not just giving this a ten for the meme its just such a great song..

**bandnitos** (10): i lip-synced to this for a school event

**bbfan132** (10): i‚Äôm a vegetarian and i still love these lyrics lmaoo

**lapascalia** (10): genius

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): queen of calcium

**rickikardashian** (10): This was SO close to get my 11 just for the laughs and giggles. I genuinely love this, I probably remember it very fondly because of good memories more than the actual quality of the song, but this just brings me so much joy. I thought it was so hilarious when i first saw it on twitter, and then just see it blow up and have people make all types of memes with it was a blast. I made sure every single one of my friends saw it, and all of them were absolutely confused by it. This placed her on the internet‚Äôs collective consciousness and introduced her as a very talented rapper with tons of charisma that doesn‚Äôt take herself too seriously. As messy as she is, I appreciate Doja for what she is and I can assure you that without this she wouldn‚Äôt be where is currently.

**sandyfishnets** (10): bitch i'm a cow, iconic

**steelstepladder** (10): Fuck it, why not

**twat\_brained** (10): This is a 10 for Doja finding a way to put her name on the map by playing the viral game to a T. All power to Miss Thing here.

**waluigiest** (10): CULTURAL RESET

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this has a special place in my life as the only karaoke song i've done so far

**hunnybee12** (9): this zoom meeting + cam girl aesthetic is a lot for may 2020. she‚Äôs too ahead of her time

**rotating3Dtext** (9): yes

**selegend** (9): classics listening session

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): this is such a stupid and fun song. its pretty well written, she used every single pun related to cows she couldve. the vibes are so calming. she also started the cow print trend, her mind.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this song is kind of dumb but Doja somehow makes it work

**skargardin** (8): fun bop

**starlitsuns** (8): what the heck was Doja on when she recorded this song? Asking for a friend

**worlds-okayest666** (8): this didnt need to be 4 minutes long

**effervescentemu** (7.4): More soothing than it has any right to be.

**akanewasright** (7): This song overstays it‚Äôs welcome, but it‚Äôs fucking iconic. I love it mostly unironically.

**alwayswords** (7): points just for being iconic

**AnimationJava** (7): cute

**CritneySpearz** (7): wait I almost gave this song a 1 but then ‚ÄúOld MacDonald had a farm I give him a titty, tryna keep him calm‚Äù came and I choked

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): [#tbt!](https://www.pride.com/sites/www.pride.com/files/2018/08/30/doja-cat-faggot-tweet-homophobic.jpg)

**Nickl00** (7): it‚Äôs funny but you can tell it was made quickly. The sampling is still great though

**yoshifan823** (6.9): meme number for meme song

**laurent1683** (6): Doja with no budget

**untutorable** (6): what a way to blow up as an artist

**wavingwolves** (6): the fact that this song has a genius verified video sends me so much

#Vegans

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.4): ok i know it's a meme song but it fucking drags and gets boring

**InfernalSolstice** (5): this is just weird

**Sundraliz** (5): I have to be honest and admit I thought this was so dumb in 2018 and I kind of still think that.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): its sending me that this is the longest song in the rate by like 30 seconds

**stryxen** (4.1): tempting to give this an 11 but I also really hate this and it. doesn‚Äôt. end.

**bespectacIed** (4): A bona fide breakthrough hit, doja served camp. But this is kinda tragic.

**bulforster** (4): I remember this being funny, why is it just boring now?

**1998tweety** (3): Meme songs are sin

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is nearly 5 minutes long. What was the reason.

**awhile2** (2): somehow ive managed to avoid listening to this song and its entirety up unitl now. It really should only be the first 30 seconds and then end after that

**kappyko** (1): this is the longest song in the rate......

**radiofan15** (0): One of the worst things that have ever graced the Earth... and that includes COVID-19, the Black Plague, the Minions, the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs and Adam Levine's falsetto... and also, Kelis sweetie I'm so sorry....

**wardrum5** (0): a failure on every level, i do not understand how this had any type of popularity. The worst thing a meme song can be is boring. This song lacks the catchiness of like Baby Shark and absurdity of PenPineappleApplePen. On a musical level, it doesn't have interesting production like What Does the Fox Say, creative lyrics like a Lonely Island song, or any semblance of talent behind the joke, like literally any song by Cupcakke. There is literally nothing to get out of this song.

A song featuring Charli going out on Day 1????? On MY Popheads??? I expected this one to do a lot better just for that fact alone, but also because this is a banger. Charli main rap girl confirmed.

Favorite Line(s) - They know racin' is my fetish, so I vrooma vrooma vrooma, purple Lambo with the roof off

---

#Cute sexy and my ride's sporty 

**bandnitos** (10): charli is a rap girl

**Nickl00** (10): Charli really has the Midas touch

**plastichaxan** (10): there can 100 bad bitches in the room and all of them go off in this

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): YES WE STAN

**skargardin** (10): bop!!!

**twat\_brained** (10): There can be 100 bad bitches in a club, and 99 don't want to remix your song, but all it takes is just one multitalented future of pop.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): charli rapping >>>

**radiofan15** (9.5): Charli did her thing... and we're glad she did

**lapascalia** (9): how have I never heard this? it‚Äôs a bop

**SideBTrack8** (9): Charli really stole the show wow

**starlitsuns** (7.5): Ariana stole the "I want it, I got it" bit from Tommy and those are facts

**steelstepladder** (7): One Big City, full of bad bitches

**stryxen** (7): I like the beat and I‚Äôm an annoying charli stan sorry

**1998tweety** (6.5): Charli is sin, the gag when she's the best part of the song though.

**bbfan132** (6.5): i should like this more than i do but it‚Äôs pretty bland imo - i liked charli‚Äôs verse though

**awhile2** (6): honestly her stuff when she was still signed to AWFUL was a lot better imo

**hunnybee12** (6): even charli could not save this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): nice and smooth but i can never remember the chorus or tune so

**waluigiest** (6): ariana was taking notes when she wrote 7 rings....

#Vroom vroom to going out Day 1

**yoshifan823** (5): I saw Charli and thought I was in for a treat and was disappointed

**InfernalSolstice** (4): even charli couldn't save this monotone repetitive snoozefest

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): Charli killed it, as expected. Tommy's whisper style is a little bit boring and her lyricism isn't the best. It's very cliche and she doesnt convince me that shes about what shes saying. I'm just bored by her part and shes 2/3rds of the song.

**bespectacIed** (2): bad

**pjones3416** (2): watch this win bc of charli...

**ImADudeDuh** (1): yikes
