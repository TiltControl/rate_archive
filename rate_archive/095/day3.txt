This is one of my favorite cupcakKe songs and I'm so happy it made it to Day 1, albeit barely. Yes, the transgender line is a tad problematic but her intentions were good, Otherwise, it's an absolute anthem for the LGBTQ+ community and is also one of her biggest bangers

Favorite Line(s) - Tuck your dick, mijo // His dick might be Tinder but he post it on Grindr // Gay guy brave takin' anal

---

#GAY RIGHTS

**pjones3416** (11): SHE SAID GAY RIGHTS

**waluigiest** (11): okay... I can’t believe I didn’t know this song. Her lyricism and flow are really top of the pack, and I am living my best gay life for this

**InfernalSolstice** (10): invented equality

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): maybe the gays won

**radiofan15** (10): She's really coming for every other girl's throat for sure

**skargardin** (10): gay anthem!!

**wavingwolves** (10): taylor, take notes, honey. you need it

**worlds-okayest666** (10): she said GAY RIGHTS!!!

**bulforster** (9.5): Cupcakke is so much more than her admittedly amazing sex songs. Songs like this, LGBT, Biggie Smalls and A.U.T.I.S.M. prove how positive and empathetic she is.

**untutorable** (9.5): a true ally

**1998tweety** (9): Ok she spilled so hard here I have to stan.

**bbfan132** (9): i don’t love the production but i love the message… she needs to not use a certain word to describe trans people though….

**bespectacIed** (9): LGBT outsold but this song's still a queer anthem smash. "Gay guy brave takin' anal When it cum that's a volcano" who's doing it like cupcakke, really??

**CritneySpearz** (9): YEAH IN CONCLUSION THE GAYS AINT LOSIN

**HerculesMeow** (9): although I prefer Lgbt as my pride anthem :/

**hunnybee12** (9): yntcd wishes

**laurent1683** (9): YESSSSSSSSS, every line is a success

**rotating3Dtext** (9): HAPPY PRIDE

**starlitsuns** (9): ended homophobia and transphobia

**stryxen** (9): so brave of her to invent gay sex here

**akanewasright** (8.5): The lyrics are a little heavy handed, but this is one of the most enjoyable beats I’ve heard so far, and CupcakKe can honestly sound great rapping about anything.

**materialqirl** (8.5): love is love periodt

**bandnitos** (8): gay icon

**ignitethephoenix** (8): she said lgbt rights!!!! When will your fav

**lapascalia** (8): an anthem

**nootnoot781** (8): this is true allyship

**rickikardashian** (8): transgenders are people indeed

**steelstepladder** (8): This is all I have since pride has been kinda cancelled this year but I'm bopping

**twat\_brained** (7.7): I appreciate the trans support but if she'd cut that part out the song wouldn't feel as stretched out

**AnimationJava** (7.5): lgbt ally in the beginning part

**CreepyMannequin** (7): she said gay rights!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is cute and gets a lot of attention for being a Pride anthem but a) she did this better with “LGBT” and b) there are better songs on this album.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): i love the message but this royalty free squeaky beat is not it. lyrically stunning, sonically not it. also it's a different topic than what cuppcakee normally raps about which i respect.

**kappyko** (7): using transgender as a noun is .... but i know she's learning and it's a sincere sentiment. the real problem is that the hook is ?.

**Sundraliz** (7): lol!!!

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): groovy beat, good lyrics, cupcakke knows her main audience

**yoshifan823** (7): insert rainbow flag emoji

#You Need To Calm Down - Taylor Swift (ft. pandering)

**hikkaru** (6.5): the message i like, the production less so

**Awkward\_King** (6): cupcakke is the only ally

**ImADudeDuh** (6): "lesbians, you are strong! you should fuck whoever you want and not be oggled at! Gays, you are strong! you are winning everyday! trans people exist!"

**Nickl00** (6): I like the message but the production is like funny how bad it is

**selegend** (6): its no LGBT

Saweetie's first breakthrough hit is certainly catchy, and really highlights her flow and lyrical talent. Anytime I hear the beginning few lines, they get stuck in my head for DAYSS.

Favorite Line(s) - Is that Gucci on my feet? Shit, bitch it might be // My dream is like a child and I'm taking all the custody

---

#Can't stop won't stop

**InfernalSolstice** (11): the bae mix might be better but everything about this song is so smooth i love it so much

**Awkward\_King** (10): omg

**ImADudeDuh** (10): queen sampling another queen

**selegend** (10): really one of the best songs ever

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i thought the lyric was “the clit real small but we making big moves” at first...also wtf why is this song so short

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop, remix slaps too.

**materialqirl** (9.5): ten white toes in them tory flip flops ayeee ayeeeeee

**stryxen** (9.1): shes got me grooving on the spot

**bespectacIed** (9): Something subdued, something for the winter time, something for the girls to you know, just vibe to. It's impossible to NOT play Khia - My Neck, My Back immediately after this

**cremeebrulee** (9): so smooth but so short :(

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): I miss this Saweetie. The wordplay and lyricism here is so good. She seemlessly rides this beat. She gives Megan vibes her, being a confident hot girl who knows her worth. She ate.

**Nickl00** (9): whenever someone mentions icy I immediately start rapping the verse first

**rickikardashian** (9): if it was a minute longer this would be a 10

**skargardin** (9): banger!

**twat\_brained** (9): If nobody else will say it then I will: does anybody find it ironic that we're rating a song which uses an iconic hip hop instrumental when we've been taking a Cupcakke vocal and just copying and pasting it to various songs over the years? I shouldn't be getting to deep into it but alas, I do :/

**waluigiest** (9): this retro sound is so clean and SO good

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): "put it in my savings and invest in the right companies" we love a financially astute queen

**AnimationJava** (8): i like this flex

**awhile2** (8): i thought saweetie had so much potential when this song came out but she never lived up to it imo (even if my tape is a banger)

**bbfan132** (8): a bit too short but i LOVE the khia sample

**hunnybee12** (8): she’s so pretty tf

**steelstepladder** (8): It's great to see some of the girls actually be able to spit outside of a pop context

**bulforster** (7.5): Tight beat and flow but unbothered to the point of becoming a bit boring.

#Remix outsold

**akanewasright** (7): This song sounds very cheap. I hope it gets remade, because the opening bit alone is actually stellar.

**bandnitos** (7): i like it

**HerculesMeow** (7): I think this song has a lot of potential to be better, it doesn't really go anywhere for me

**lapascalia** (7): not bad

**TragicKingdom1** (7): remix >>>

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): After Kehlani annihilated her on the remix I can’t take the solo version seriously

**mayolizard** (6): i didn't really like her first ep as much as her second one

**Sundraliz** (6): omg the My Neck My Back sample is really good.

**radiofan15** (2.5): This is not a song, it's a glorified ringtone that is not even catchy enough so you wouldn't confuse it with background noise

This deserved higher than Juicy and I will die on this hill. If the whole Tinychat thing didn't happen I think this would have done better, but oh well. Another of Doja's many TikTok hits, it also was full of controversy due to the obvious scandal but also due to her making merch from a TikTok trend and not credited the creator. However, this is a total bop and is one of my favorites on Hot Pink. WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIIIIIIIVE!!!

Favorite Line(s) - Make it pop in your face like a Samsung // OHHHHH WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE, living in the future blinging on my hotline

#WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIIIIIIIIIIVE

**bandnitos** (10): OH WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIIIIIIIVE

**hunnybee12** (10): …. did everyone try the chicken? i thought the chicken was lovely.

**materialqirl** (10): OOOOO WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVEEEEE

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): doja shitting on camera for white supremacists

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): doja predicted social distancing queen.

**mayolizard** (9.5): oooooh what a time to be alive

**twat\_brained** (9.4): this is what NSYNC failed to accomplish with "Digital Get Down". Also +1 for the bisexual lighting in Doja's bedroom in the music video, with an extra .5 for the messages in the sidebar chat which SEND ME TO NO END

**1998tweety** (9): Bop

**alwayswords** (9): reminds me of her scandal

**bbfan132** (9): this beat <3

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this isn’t my personal fav from her, but it’s her most interesting and unique song. I love the production especially

**kappyko** (9): her best

**letsallpoo** (9): alt right incel ANTHEM

**rickikardashian** (9): Oh, you’re going to make a comment talking about how Doja is talking about cyber sexing white supremacists on TinyChat? That’s funny, original and clever, did you come up with that?

**steelstepladder** (9): Cyber Sex... Doja Cat... Cyber Sex... Doja Cat...Cyber Sex... Doja Cat... hmmm

**stryxen** (9): guessing half of these comments are going to be about tiktok and the other half are going to be about the chat room stuff

**Sundraliz** (9): Predicted our summer 2020 anthem :( it's a bop though :)

**worlds-okayest666** (9): grew off me a little bc of all the tiktok meme mashups ngl...

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): this aged like FINE WINE

**AnimationJava** (8.2): i love her vocals on this and the production, it sounds so nice

**lapascalia** (8): the song hits different after all that’s happened to say the least… it’s still good though

**plastichaxan** (8): i used to relate to this until the whole mess, still catchy though

**selegend** (8): run brooklyn queen her check Doja

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.8): great vibe, great video

**akanewasright** (7): I generally think that Doja shouldn’t be judged for the cancelation attempt anymore because I fully believe what she said on her Instagram live, but... yeah this song used to have a 9. It slaps really hard and Luke isn’t on it, but suddenly I really don’t want to listen to it anymore...

**sawayamas** (7): WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE

**waluigiest** (7): I was smitten by this song when the album came out but now I’m much less into it.... it just doesn’t commit

**yoshifan823** (7): the complaining from nerds about how doja wouldn’t show her tits after she got to #1 is especially dumb/hilarious considering literally all of her music videos exist. Do you want some lame picture or an entire video of her as a cam girl that fucks a giant silver robot-man?

#Tinychat stans

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): uhm. how appropiate.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): cute concept but kinda drags

**Nickl00** (6): I don’t like her vocals and the production is a little underwhelming

**wavingwolves** (3): this does nothing to me, i'm not a fan of her delivery at all and i'm massively tired of hearing this everytime i scroll tiktok

**wardrum5** (2): honestly i just really do not want to listen to this song, regardless of whether or not doja actually does get freaky on camera for nazis

**gannade** (1): sounds like PC music

**ImADudeDuh** (1): she really said she saw this guy on dateline so he’s an assaulter at best and a pedo at worst and people just let her huh?

#Luke isn't on this one but love the energy

**bespectacIed** (10): An irresistible, cloying pop rap song. Sounds like what cotton candy tastes like. I can never watch the MV now because of the tinychat controversy nnnnnn but it was a serve. A really excellent pop song imo, the verses are si good. Bktidalwave deserves 90% of the song royalties. What a time to be aliiiiive living in the future blinging on my hot 🖕 Fuck dr luke

Cardi's breakout hit and one of the biggest rap songs of the decade still goes off in 2020 and, imo, is one of her strongest songs. The endless Instagram captions, the inescapable airplay, the viral tweets...this song made Cardi B THE MOMENT and she hasn't slowed down since.

Favorite Line(s) - I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me. Got a big and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap // And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich

---

#Money moves

**awhile2** (10): one of those songs you just knew was gonna be a hit when you first heard it. I dont think any artist since cardi has had a more exciting comeup

**bbfan132** (10): a classic, no other way to describe it

**InfernalSolstice** (10): an actual cultural reset

**Nickl00** (10): a classic

**skargardin** (10): will forever be her magnum opus

**Sundraliz** (10): All I have to say is iconic. Just kidding, I have a lot to say. But I will limit it to just mentioning how much I fucking love the flow from 2:33 to 2:48.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): idc how basic this makes me i fucking love this song and it was an 11 contender

**wavingwolves** (10): if life was like cats (the musical) this would the song that would present cardi's character and i respect that

**cremeebrulee** (9): a cultural reset

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this definitely deserves to be the song she broke out on

**sawayamas** (9): a CLASSIC... this was truly THE moment when it came out

**starlitsuns** (9): this is the sex positive song the world needed to hear

**steelstepladder** (9): Still slaps after all these years

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song took a LONG time to grow on me, but I can appreciate it for the absolute slapper it is now.

**bulforster** (8.5): So this is what it’s come down to, huh? With the crowning of “Bodak Yellow copypasta” as 2017’s single greatest piece of copypasta, r/indieheads has finally completed their transition from pretentious social media to absolute, unsalvageable garbage. Maybe I’m just old and out of touch. Maybe the children are wrong. But I have no idea how a copypasta with such a generic style and such a generic structure and such generic, mindless wording like this is even considered a decent piece of copypasta, much less some groundbreaking work of art. It’s obvious at this point that r/indieheads has changed, and for the worse. This wouldn’t have happened even five years ago. Back then you could have critiqued r/indieheads for their writing or their attitude or their politics, but their copypasta? Their copypasta contained some genuinely forward thinking, boundary pushing memes. When they made a copypasta it felt as if they were really trying to reward the best memes of the year. Don’t believe me? Their top three memes of 2012 were Frank Ocean, Grimes, and Tame Impala, three memes that were unique, innovative, and overall well-crafted pieces of meme music. Let’s go back even further, to 2007. r/indieheads top three memes from that year were Radiohead, LCD Soundsystem, and Arcade Fire. There’s no way, absolutely no way at all, that you can tell me that “Bodak Yellow copypasta” deserves to be ranked among any of those copypastas. And you know what? I actually like some of this copypasta. In the paragraphs alone I really like “So this is what it’s come down to, huh?” and “So yeah, I’m getting older” and “What might have connected with me ten years ago may not connect with me now”. But the copypastas that I do like are simply overwhelmed by the amount of trash elsewhere. And it’s not even as if these “trash” memes have some redeeming qualities here and there. It’s not as if they’re memes that, while well-executed, just fail to connect with me. The reality is that, try as I might, I simply cannot fathom what makes a copypasta like "Bodak Yellow copypasta" an enjoyable, forward thinking piece of copypasta. I can’t even fathom what makes those memes “decent”. To me they just read like absolute, unmitigated, garbage. So yeah, I’m getting older. What might have connected with me ten years ago may not connect with me now. But r/indieheads has also changed. And in their attempt to gain a larger audience they’ve shed the bulk of the avant-garde memes that might’ve scared off some of their potential audience (could you even imagine something as weird as the 12 minute long psychedelic memery that is r/ListeningHeads cracking the top ten memes in 2017?) in favor of memes that largely panders to the lowest common denominator. Congratulations, r/indieheads. I hope all that extra karma revenue is worth it.

**1998tweety** (8): I never really got the hype for this, I always thought it was just already, but it's miles ahead of the stuff in this rate.

**AnimationJava** (8): nothing will be more iconic than her breakthrough

**bandnitos** (8): it sounds like she says my pussy feels like a leg

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): it was a kultural reset. I truly belive this song ignited the acceptace of other female rappers into the mainstream.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): a cultural reset but also i feel like it didn’t last long? Cardi now feels like a personality more than an artist.

**waluigiest** (8): this was a moment

**yoshifan823** (8): this is how you get people’s attention.

**plastichaxan** (7.5): upcoming #1 placeholder we love to see it

**worlds-okayest666** (7.5): this does not slap as hard as i remember it slapping

**bespectacIed** (7): The start of it all, the start of Nicki's nightmare. I'm still not a fan of this song but I acknowledge the impact. "I don't dance now, I make money moves" still and will always be Cardi's most memorable bar. The truth in that line, she really made IT.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): This would’ve been higher if it weren’t so overplayed.

**laurent1683** (7): It feels so barebones which is why I like it. Tons of quotables

**stryxen** (7): I can’t decide if this has a satisfying end to the build up or if it just fizzles out

#Fixed your teeth but not this song ❤️

**rosecoloreds** (6): overplayed at this point

**kappyko** (5): its fine good for parties when was the last time u went to a party

**untutorable** (4): not a song that i care for, props to her for fixing her teeth tho that's one of my favorite flexes bc it legitimately works on me

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I remember in the olden days when this song was blowing up there was so much discourse over whether Cardi was fulfilling the “new main pop girl prophecy” or she was a flash-in-the-pan one-hit wonder and history has leaned far more towards the former but like… just listening to this song can you blame us for having our doubts? This is so annoying, I can’t believe people made this a #1 song. I can’t believe Pitchfork said this was the best song of 2017 as if “Act My Age” from *Witness* wasn’t RIGHT THERE.

**materialqirl** (0): trash

**twat\_brained** (0): I'm not doing this anymore. I'm also not taking questions about giving a song which basically name-checks a rapist despite giving my 11 to a song produced by a rapist. Yes, I'm a part of the problem, let's move on.

Tbh this was a tad robbed. This is one of the best songs in the rate lyrically and that opening line...there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. I expected a top 10 placement for this. and surprisingly, it spent most of the cycle in the 20's until a few last minute scores.

Favorite Line(s) - I THOUGHT I CAME BUT I PEED ON THE DICK // Sloppy toppy for papi leave sloppy Joe shook // Nut in my pussy hair, that's deep conditioner // Tell your grandma sew my pussy, since you split open my clit (this one had me screaming)

#Watersports stans

**bulforster** (11): Cupcakke is a rap prodigy. Everything about this is incredible: the lyrics are witty and insane in the best way, the flow is commanding and virtuosic and the production is actually able to live up to her talent.

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): I would like to offer my deepest gratitudes to this rate for making me actually appreciate CupcakKe and not just think of her as that rapper who makes nice collabs with Charli sometimes, because UGH THIS IS SO GOOD.

**radiofan15** (11): They don't make them as emotive and powerful as this one...

**steelstepladder** (11): I can't give my eleven to anyone else. It just wouldn't be honest with my feelings.

**untutorable** (11): this is so fucking GOOD and no i'm not giving it this ironically it's good ok

**worlds-okayest666** (11): only cupcakke could make a sexual metaphor out of duck duck goose and make it slap so hard. the production on this is so fucking good

**akanewasright** (10): This is the first time I’ve heard this song, and this is the best I’ve ever heard Cupcakke, like holy shit. The final verse is so good it’s not even funny.

**bandnitos** (10): this unironically slaps

**bbfan132** (10): i wish the video wasn’t taken down bc it made the song 200x better

**bespectacIed** (10): Cupcakke's best song ever.  No rap song has ever made me laugh more than DDG, not even any Nicki song (which I consider the pinnacle of rap humor). Every line in this song is instagram caption worthy, twitter bio worthy, tattoo on forehead worthy, gravestone epitaph worthy. Master class in songwriting. The way cupcakke delivers every line matter of factly  fucking sends me to a nother dimension I am shaking tryna type this comment from laugjing

**CritneySpearz** (10): this pussy is a vending machine VENDING MACHINEEE

**skargardin** (10): this is the perfect marriage between her bar spitting abilities and her .. sexual lyrics

**wavingwolves** (10): cupcakke needs to be included on the songwriters hall of fame for this one

**kappyko** (9): her best song lol

**laurent1683** (9): I once made a new guy friend at summer camp while bonding to our shared love for this song. Probably one of the weirdest moments of my life

**stryxen** (9): dock dock dock gootss

**yoshifan823** (9): listening to Deepthroat right before this is like night and day, instead of just being shocking it’s absolutely hilarious and witty and still incredibly dirty.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): would be excellent without the moany pre-chorus. whoever mashed this up with Bon Appetit was onto something

**1998tweety** (8): Slaps

**materialqirl** (8): head of the dick duck duck goose

**Nickl00** (8): I laugh every time I hear it but it still goes hard

**rotating3Dtext** (8): how do you top that opening line

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): the chorus is so much fun i love it!

**TragicKingdom1** (8): probably her best super sexual song

**Awkward\_King** (7): I THOUGHT I CAME BUT I PEED ON THE DICK

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): just as sexually explicit as deepthroat, but i feel like this song much more sucessful. the song feels though about, the beat is catchy, and has a ~storyline~ every single line hits right

**lapascalia** (7): i mean it’s catchy

#Ring around the Rosie >>>>

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): why does the beginning remind me of Slave 4 U

**mayolizard** (5.5): did she just say she peed on the dick?

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): A hard pill to swallow is that just because a song is outrageously sexual that doesn’t mean that it’s good or even worth listening to.

**starlitsuns** (3): the production saves this song for me

**awhile2** (0): on the one hand im just not a fan of cupcakkes over sexual lyrics but her production is often consistently horrible too. This is the worst offender on this rate

DaHumanTorch: # cupcakKe

---

**Overall Average**: 7.097 **// Average Controversy:** 2.236

---

**bespectacIed** (9.600): THE FUNNIEST RAPPER EVER. Her lyricism has been the most humorous pieces of art that I have ever experienced in life, no joke. The only rapper who can match Onika in terms of comedic delivery. So sad that she fell of a bit in terms of female rap popularity but it was so fun to stan Elizabeth a few years ago because she really served a lot. Great lyricism, vivid and unapologetically sexual imagery, great personality. I hope she bounces back!

**HerculesMeow** (8.600): My queen! I have a CD of the iconic album Audacious which was paid dust in this rate

**twat\_brained** (8.060): a Popheads icon, I wish the best for her.

**bulforster** (7.600): Like most people I first got into the iconic remixes of Deepthroat and Vagina but didn't really take Cupcakke seriously until I saw the critical attention Ephorize was getting and decided to give it a try. I loved it and it led me to check out Lipgloss with Charli and become a fan of hers so I probably wouldn't even be on popheads if it weren't for Cupcakke.

**Sundraliz** (7.200): People who pronounce CupkakKe's name as "cupcake" are cowards.

**yoshifan823** (7.200): I’m very glad that her mental breakdown didn’t seem to take, she’s incredibly fun and unique, like if 2 Live Crew had the talent to back up their bravado

**letsallpoo** (6.600): some of her lyrics still make me snort but her schtick got old really quick

**laurent1683** (6.600): I love her, would love to hug her, but even now, she still has some mid songs on her albums

**selegend** (6.200): i appreciate her for what she did but have no incentive to listen to her on my own time

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.680): I like her more than my scores indicate, she just got screwed by the song selection process. Like we could have at least subbed out “CPR” or “33rd” for one of these, plus she has so many fantastic songs that get relegated to album track status. She was such an exciting presence on the scene in 2017/2018 and then she went through that really dark period that killed her momentum… glad she’s doing better these days but I’m going to have to tread carefully with my love for her because I still think something is up.

Thick ass anthem...anaconda wishes she had what juicy has. Anyways, this song is such a bop and the second verse goes off and is one of Doja's best moments. It's a shame the Tyga version had to take out that part of all things.

Favorite Line(s) - Okay, he on his knees, attend the Mass // My fish like Takamaki like a side of me with saké, so I put it in my mouth and suck it out like edamame

---

#Tyga hate club

**yoshifan823** (11): the version with Tyga is literally a crime against humanity he belongs in the The Hague. I love Say So but this song should have been her breakthrough it’s a perfect pop-rap track.

**bespectacIed** (10): YASSSSS the original version, tyga remix is trash and replaced doja's greatest bar EVER. The way she delivered the lines "She keep it juicy just for papi/ Call me Buffy with the body / I just slipped into my savage and come over like a walkie / My fish like Takamaki, like a side of me with saké / So I put it in my mouth and suck it out like edamame" is what finally what made me take doja seriously as a rapper ... what a great moment!!! Love this song, one of my favorites in this rate, so fucking funny, very quotable.

**lapascalia** (10): no need for that tyga verse

**Sundraliz** (10): The COLORS version of this is hands down the best one. Or any version without the Tyga verse really. This was my most played song in 2019 and I could probably listen to it on repeat for the rest of my life because it just makes me happy :))

**1998tweety** (9.5): Original outsold the remix, Doja EATS

**bandnitos** (9): cold take the original is better than the remix

**twat\_brained** (9): thankfully there's a version without the Tyga verse but I'm still docking a point because there's no way to make a TikTok product placement which doesn't look clunky.

**waluigiest** (9): ty for not including the remix!!!

**Awkward\_King** (7): thank god this is the version without tyga

#Remix stans

**laurent1683** (9): At the same time it bounces and it's dreamy and ethereal. I prefer the Tyga version, but of course popheads hates him so it wasn't included

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I don’t usually say this but the Tyga remix is a 10. Hate that I’m giving a Dr. Luke (sorry, TYSON TRAXX) song a good score but the only way I’m gonna get through this rate is by being honest.

#Everyone else

**alwayswords** (10): i cant listen to this song without thinking of this video https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/697005068356026368/711734019154378782/twerk.mp4

**HerculesMeow** (10): when she suck it out like edamame >>>

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this song is so glittery. she flows over this beat so flawlessly. she bent and snapped.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was the song that sold me on Doja and I think it’s still a cute and fun bop

**effervescentemu** (9): The moment that beat comes in I am pussy popping on every tabletop in my house.

**materialqirl** (9): i keep it juicy juice

**plastichaxan** (9): where my fat ass big bitches in popheads?

**bbfan132** (8.5): i could probably listen to this for hours

**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda a bop, her best song

**letsallpoo** (8): if a dr puke song had to smash it shouldve been this

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): i loved this when it was first released but it didn't age that well for me. amazing video tho

**stryxen** (7): the fact that this song exists is just funny idk

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): dr luke snapped on the production but doja is annoying

**Nickl00** (6): I like it the more I hear it but I still don’t love it

**nootnoot781** (6): obligatory “why not stream juice instead” comment

**bulforster** (5): While the genius interview about this song is hilarious it does sound like not a lot of thought was put into the lyrics.

**starlitsuns** (5): my ass is flat and I’m jealous

**steelstepladder** (5): Weird to see this song be Doja's real breakthrough into the public considering it's kinda eh

**selegend** (3): ehh tia tamera outthicked

**akanewasright** (1): was this seriously her first charting single? This is really meh on the first listen, and since it’s Luke track, I’m not going to listen to it more than once.

**awhile2** (8): i c o n i c hook (also hook shouldve been included in this rate)

**Sundraliz** (8): Sometimes it feels good to be angry huh.

**bulforster** (7): Her rage-rapping isn't as expressive as it gets to be on future releases but I appreciate this as her first collab with Kenny forging this rap style.

**lapascalia** (7): damn tell em rico

#Bitch hush

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I thought I liked Rico Nasty but the more I listen to her music the more I’m like “wait maybe I don’t”

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): this felt very filler to me and I wasn’t expecting it to based off the title

**radiofan15** (4.6): I feel... smacked... like a bitch...

**sweetnsoursauce1** (4): this just isn't it for me

DaHumanTorch: # Rico Nasty

---

**Overall Average**: 7.278 **// Average Controversy:** 1.998

---

**bespectacIed** (9.200): SHE IS THE STANDARD. Rico is probably the coolest girl in rap right now, everything she does exudes badassness

**yoshifan823** (8.600): I be in a coupe coupe coupe coupe coupe blowin’ money out the roof roof roof roof roof

**selegend** (7.800): she deserves more

**bulforster** (7.700): I love how Rico complements the aggression in her raps with the futuristic cartoonishness in her visuals which express her fun, tongue-in-cheek, almost childish (in a good way!) energy. I also like that she doesn't really sell sex, which I'm not against at all it's just nice that she provides variety.

**Sundraliz** (7.000): I was huge on Rico for a while but unfortunately I think Anger Management is going to end up staying my favorite of her works. I hope she revisits that aggresive style again. I wish this rate had Cold or Cheat Code in it! Or Rage!! Where is Rage?!

**laurent1683** (5.800): Her best songs are the best but she's definetly not consistent

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.960): I’m sorry but Rico not being on the *Birds of Prey* soundtrack but being on the *Scoob* soundtrack is one of the funniest music moments of the year. Anyways I can’t say I’m a Rico expert or anything but there’s been a very noticeable difference between her new autotuned pop stuff and her older rap stuff and while I don’t hate it, I hope she doesn’t lose sight of what made her special to begin with.

**CreepyMannequin** (3.800): noah fence but her voice is really annoying

I'm probably one of the biggest Bree Runway stans on Earth so prepare for a little but of an essay, but I will try and restrain myself. This song is incredible and is one of the strongest female rap songs in recent memory.  Her flow and energy is so catchy and infectious and the switchups in production throughout the song are top notch. The music video accompanying it is incredible considering her lower budget. I mean, cmon...Missy Elliot herself shouted this song out, as well as Doja Cat. Also, lyrically, the amount of quotable lines in this....she really snapped.

Favorite Line(s) - Pick your face up, girl, you need a facelift // 'Bout to bodybag these bitches, put them in the trunk // Snatchin' everybody wigs, now they look like thumbs

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Perfection.

A song with a male feature making it this far? *gasp* Honestly this song is kinda forgettable for me and I'm a bit surprised it almost hit the top 10. However, as every Megan song, it is still a banger.

Favorite Line(s) - He say he hungry, this pussy the kitchen .. I'm a finesser and I'm a fly dresser

---

#Money thick thick 

**frankiefrankiefrank** (11): Megan is the best rapper in the rate, and this is her best song besides the Savage remix which isn't in the rate

**bandnitos** (10): this was included in an english project last year

**bbfan132** (10): “he know he giving his money to megan/he know it’s very expensive to date me” alone made me give this a 10

**bespectacIed** (10): A cultural reset. Should've went number 1. Probably the song that made me stan. Dababy matched Meg's energy without soundling like a cuck. HE SAY HE HUNGRY? THIS 🐱 THE KITCHEN.

**bulforster** (10): I'd probably complain about this beat being a bit sparse if Meg wasn't so good that her rapping barely needs any support.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is one of my favourite songs from Megan and I think Dababy’s feature on here is one of the best things he’s done

**lapascalia** (10): it’s a banger

**mayolizard** (10): everything about this song is amazing.

**rickikardashian** (10): dababy’s verse makes me so fucking >!redacted!<. [anyway, i always think of this tweet when i listen to this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/844/710/20f.png)

**sawayamas** (10): my summer 2019 song tbh.. it's a whole bop and is giving me non quarantined summer nostalgia :(

**wavingwolves** (10): this song called me poor a hundred times and i let it. also everytime i listen to dababy i think about that dude that said dababy sounds like a washing machine with too many clothes in it

**yoshifan823** (10): it’s crazy that these two were this good on this track, they could have just slacked and it still would have been popular because of the years they were having but they went all out and it’s awesome

**1998tweety** (9): Big bop

**akanewasright** (9): I’m not in love with DaBaby’s verse, but this is a great track.

**Nickl00** (9): one of her biggest hits for a reason

**skargardin** (9): this song is so steamy, they both ate this tf up

**waluigiest** (9): when she says “ah” I contemplate my sexuality

**AnimationJava** (8.5): i love dababy's verse on this so much

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I get such a whiplash after hearing Megan rap about nothing but sex only to hear the genders flipped when Baby comes in. I'll have to keep playing this in order to get used to the difference

**TragicKingdom1** (8): dababy & megan have excellent chemistry but could be better, a bit plodding

**radiofan15** (7.6): DaBaby is useless and pointless, but he's serviceable in small doses so I don't really mind...

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): hearing men sing about straight sex is so foreign to me

**starlitsuns** (7): gets me feeling a certain way when DaBaby talks about being putting his partner in a chokehold, don’t approve but it’s funny

**steelstepladder** (7): Good but I can't help and feel like a Meghan/DaBaby collab should be better

#Really put the 'shit' in 'Cash Shit'

**stryxen** (6.9): o.o wasn’t expecting to like DaBaby’s part at all and I’m not sure why I did

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): the beat is boring, and dababy gives nothing. however, meg carries this song flawlessly. dom queen.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): hot take? But this song is kinda boring

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): the first verse held so much promise but the chrous falls flat for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.6): ugh she said simp, this is a bad song

I literally cannot listen to this song without absolutely screaming the chorus. This is by far Saweetie's best song for me and I'm craving another banger from her in the realm of this. It's one of the shorter songs in the rate but doesn't overstay its welcome. It's a song that is made for the repeat button.

Favorite Line(s) - Eight-inch big, ooh, that's good pipe. Bad bitch, Imma ride the dick all night // Said I want your man, no the fuck I don't sis

#Something fun, something for the summertime, something for the girls to get ready and party to

**gannade** (11): ooooooooof this song is my type!

**skargardin** (11): I wasn't planning on giving this my 11 at first, but something clicked and clicked HARD with this one, whew, she really did snap on this!!

**bandnitos** (10): a short song done right

**bespectacIed** (10): SHE WANTED TO SO SOMETHING FUN, SOMETHING FOR THE SUMMERTIME, SOMETHING FOR THE GIRLS TO YOU KNOW, GET READY AND PARTY TOO. A song that was everywhere. A fun, impossible to hate song. That's my type!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): my first runner up for an 11

**mayolizard** (10): this EP was amazing

**Nickl00** (10): like act up but better

**radiofan15** (10): I don't like to be yelled-at, but this is still a BOP

**rickikardashian** (10): [be blessed with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEsDZUF2_pI)

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): v close to being my 11, love everything about this song

**waluigiest** (10): it’s bite sized but it works so, so well

**wavingwolves** (10): i don't care what anyone says this slaps hard

**bulforster** (9): The simplicity of the rapping here actually really works with how brash the song is.

**materialqirl** (8.7): good but ngl i overplayed it when it got big sooo

**effervescentemu** (8.6): Every faceless Tinder dude's featured Spotify song.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Production on this slaps, I'm glad she keeps it short cause I don't think she could carry a 4 minute long song.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): glad this was a hit, we need more of a 00s revival in hip hop

**untutorable** (8.5): has no business being this catchy tbh

**lapascalia** (8): a hoe anthem

**steelstepladder** (8): I was so happy this really broke through last year

**stryxen** (8): I thought cardi came in but it’s just her??? anyway beat and lyrics are great and her flows are rlly fun

**twat\_brained** (8): just like with Doja, I'm removing points for the pointless TikTok product placement in the video. Song itself slaps though

**yoshifan823** (7): that 2003 beat

#THAT'S (NOT) MY TYPE, THAT'S (NOT) MY TYPE

**bbfan132** (5.5): i didn’t really like the chorus but it wasn’t bad

**laurent1683** (2): "insert an overuse of the word toxic"

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (0): A city girls rip off. This song is just really corny and clearly only made to get popular on Tik Tok. It feels like a sellout. A full 180 from the effortlessly cool Saweetie in Icy Grl.

This song started in the Top 3 and slowly but surely made its way down to #9, almost missing the top 10...a little shocking considering how much the sub loves this song. I definitely think these scores were affected a bit by Luke and the scandal, but it still received a worthy top 10 placement. For me, it's pop-rap perfection and was one of my favorite singles of 2019.

Favorite Line(s) - Realer than anybody you had, and pretty. All of the body-ody the ass and titties // Let me check my chest, my breath right quick

---

#Lemme check my chest, my breath right quick

**materialqirl** (11): DIDNT EVEN NOTICE NO PUNCHES LEFT TO ROLL WITH YOU GOT TO KEEP IT FOCUSED U WANNA SAY SO

**Sundraliz** (11): I'm OBSESSED with this song to an worrying degree. I don't even know what to say about it... just that I love it!!! Thank you.

**twat\_brained** (11): Look, Dr. Luke already has rate wins on Popheads following his production of Hot N Cold and C'Mon; let's not pretend we don't actively platform and enable him. Don't wanna fuck with Popheads? Say so. If there's any positives, all power to Doja and her team for giving a voice to the girl who started the dance craze on TikTok, especially when the Renegade girl had her dance gentrified and discredited.

**1998tweety** (10): The Lukeprint never misses, production on this song is immaculate but Doja's rap verse steals the show.

**CritneySpearz** (10): if we’re rating just on the song alone, it’s a fucking bop. 10/10. Obviously disgusting that dr. puke is involved, so..

**ignitethephoenix** (10): regardless of all the mess regarding this song and Doja, it’s still excellent and so smooth and catchy. Definitely deserves to be a hit

**InfernalSolstice** (10): lowkey like the nicki version better (the one without the beat switch ofc)

**lapascalia** (10): it wasn’t my favourite at first, but it hasn’t gotten old for me yet

**mayolizard** (10): this tha remix

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): iconic, the nicki remix could never

**rotating3Dtext** (10): sorry it’s just a perfect pop song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): i know this will have a controversial score but its a fantastic song

**yoshifan823** (10): that beatttttttttt

**alwayswords** (9): the tiktok dance made me like this song more

**bandnitos** (9): WHERES NICKI AT

**bbfan132** (9): this was kind of overplayed but it’s still great

**bespectacIed** (9): What can I say that hasn't already been said. We hate Tyson Trax but this is an excellent pop song. Iconic everything. Nicki ruined with her half-assed verses but them going number 1 and savage remix number 2 made history so I am gonna forgive.

**Nickl00** (9): the best song on the album when it dropped and it still is

**plastichaxan** (9): the song that made me notice not all of the tiktok viral songs annoy me

**steelstepladder** (9): Cotton Candy bliss and perfect production courtesy of Hatsune Miku

**untutorable** (9): but will she win the rate?

**stryxen** (8.9): song peaked at that edited version going ÁSs n tidÉÉÉsss

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): had to grow on me and highly derivative of other songs but a big bop

**laurent1683** (8): I just with this song had some change in the beat (the Nicki beat switch is NOT an option)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I try to avoid listening to songs by he-who-shall-not-be-named because I’m worried that I’ll like them (say what you will, the man has a good ear) so I’d never heard this and now that I’m listening to it I’m relieved that it’s just kind of all right. Maybe if I hammered this in for a few weeks I’d think it was a mega bop or something but tbh it’s just kind of a disco inspired song, we’ve heard those before.

**hunnybee12** (7.5): i’m happy she got a hit (wish it was w/o dr. l***) but it’s really not her best song. it’s only catchy because of the groove and it’s hard to understand what she’s even saying through some of it

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): the vintage vibes of this song are so summery and fun. i hope this song is a massive hit like it deserves to be. I think i overplayed this song for myself, so its not one of my favorites and its kinda repetative but its still a great song.

**waluigiest** (7): glamorous but I ’m tired of it honestly

#Didn't even notice

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): DOJA KILLED JFK IT WAS DOJA! DOJA CAT!!

**wavingwolves** (6): while this is a very infectious song it does get old fast and it already did for me

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this song has never been more than a 6 and never less than 4… except when nicki made it a 2

**gannade** (3): catchy but working with Dr Puke? gonna lose some points for that one

**kappyko** (3): dr luke has the most fucking boring idea of disco ever this song was basic then and basic now.

**letsallpoo** (2): this song is so boring until she starts rapping like 2/3 of the way in. then it immediately becomes boring again

**akanewasright** (1): I’m not gonna lie, I loved this song at first. But I’ve completely soured on it since I first heard it. Luke getting a #1 was part of it. So were the Nicki stans rigging the charts. But around Sunday of that week... I just never wanted to hear it again. To everyone who voted for this... I’m sorry, but I can’t. Consider that it’s not my 0 an act of mercy. Fuck Luke, fuck everyone that doesn’t believe Kesha, and fuck every single A&R person that now feels comfortable with sending vulnerable young women into the clutches of a possessive rapist who fat shamed Kesha into an eating disorder because of Luke’s success with Doja.

**selegend** (0): there’s enough that’s been said about this one but it’s not even good, it’s so boring

This is an interesting one as it samples another song present in the rate...and very heavily outscored it. This was the summer hit that never was due to the idiotic August release. The chorus is so smooth and fun, coupled with Megan and Nicki's fire verses, make for an incredible song that will be on repeat every Hot Girl Summer.

**mayolizard** (11): ugh the power that this song has is so amazing. I really love this so much.

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, you know racism and misogyny are real cause Hot Girl Bummer performed better than this song.

**akanewasright** (10): This is just pure fun. Maybe I’ll regret giving it this score and root for it to go out at some point. I do hate Nicki now, after all. But I’ve listened to this song too many times for me to not call it a 10. I listened to this song in December for fuck’s sake. For me to listen to a seasonal song out of season... it has to be basically perfect.

**AnimationJava** (10): :chefskiss:

**bbfan132** (10): eat that dick up even when i’m going vegan…. iconic bar

**bespectacIed** (10): This is how you cement your brand, piss on it like it's your territory, and make dollars out of it. The events leading up to this collab literally shook stan twitter ... [the surprise facetime between them](https://youtu.be/ya3AilYXOWw) (and yes that was the live that produced the iconic "big boobs, wha, uhm chile anyways") ... the iconic ig live with them celebrating the collab, feat. doja popping on the comments. It was such a fun moment in standom, seeing Nicki finally give her blessing to a younger rap girl, and seeing Meg being so giddy to collab with her idol. Hot Girl Summer is a fun track, it has everything for a pop rap hit: a non-annoying hook, meme-worthiness, enjoyable verses from both meg and onika, an ACT UP SAMPLE. Both the girls (and ty) seemed to have had so much fun. And so did I!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): BOP!!!!

**InfernalSolstice** (10): deserved number 1

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Ty Dolla $ign’s hook makes this song, and even Nicki put some effort in.

**materialqirl** (10): i mean...periodt

**rickikardashian** (10): oh to be on a hot summer night, windows rolled down on the way to the beach party, ready to get turnt and hoe it out, instead of being locked in your small ass apartment for 5 months

**selegend** (10): this deserves an 11 too

**steelstepladder** (10): It's just such a perfect pool party song holy shit.

**twat\_brained** (10): this is the quintessential hip-hop summer song.

**wavingwolves** (10): nicki's verse and the city girls ad-libs here are holier than the bible

**worlds-okayest666** (10): again, deserved to be a smash hit

**bulforster** (9.5): Bumping a half point off for the weirdness of having a man sing the hook but it was nice to see the Nicki feature come about organically on that IG live and this is bringing back nice memories of last summer.

**radiofan15** (9.2): Shoutout to Megan and Ty Dolla and both of them only

**alwayswords** (9): hot girl summer coming out in like september :sob:

**bandnitos** (9): summer anthem

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I like this but it’s one of Megan’s weakest songs here imo

**lapascalia** (9): feels like a lifetime ago

**Nickl00** (9): that hook is so good and Nicki actually tries

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this would've smashed so much harder if it released earlier in the summer UGH!

**waluigiest** (9): this is so CLEAN. With a better rollout it really could have been Nicki’s first #1

**stryxen** (8.9): THE Queen Of Rap (NOT nicki)

**Awkward\_King** (8): EAT THAT DICK UP EVEN WHEN IM GOING VEGAN

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): will never forgive this song for coming out in the last two weeks of summer. out peaked hot girl bummer.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): i'm in the southern hemisphere so this doesn't even relate to me but if this was released at the beginning of summer it would have smashed. it sounds rushed though, they could have done LOADS more with the chorus and video.

**untutorable** (8): ty was not needed

**rosecoloreds** (7.5): would be better without ty

**wardrum5** (7.5): suffers from overly high expectations but is still good. I just dont get why they chose Ty$ instead of literally any woman

**Sundraliz** (7): It was nice to see and hear Nicki

**yoshifan823** (7): Nicki hates Cardi so much that she’s decided to hop on tracks from all of her competition in the hopes that one of them will topple Cardi

#Hot Girl Bummer

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): There’s only so many times I can hear Megan say “hot girl” before it just starts to sound like a fake term. Everyone on this song sounds fine but god I found this whole “hot girl summer” thing insufferable

**skargardin** (5): This should've been one of her signature hits but it's just incredibly mediocre

**gannade** (3): Hot Girl Bummer HEAVILY outpeaked

**frankiefrankiefrank** (0): It's not the worst but I expected so much more.

I kinda wish only one of the artists were featured and we got a second verse from Cardi. It just really loses steam by the time the second Latin artist arrives. That first verse though...one of my favorites in the entire rate. Invented cardio.

Favorite Line(s) - 'Bout my coins like Mario. Yeah they call me Cardi B, I run this shit like cardio // Beat em up like piñatas

---

#Bitch I'm signin'

**AnimationJava** (11): Cardi crafted a latin banger that connects with her afro-latina roots and created the biggest hit of her career. The build-up, the rifts, the insanely catchy lyrics, the spanish lyrics and the guest verses... :chefskiss: it's perfection and maybe one of the most emblematic songs of the penetration of latin music into the US market that happened all throughout the late 2010s.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Latino rights!

**TiltControls** (11): this song is hard-hitting perfection

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop

**akanewasright** (10): This is one of the best hits of 2018. Every element of this song is iconic as FUCK. It’s just a burst of positive energy. This was my first exposure to Bad Bunny, and it was a damn good one.

**bespectacIed** (10): A pop song. A serve in all levels. Belcalis' most deserved number 1. I still get randomly whiplashed by "yeah they call me cardi b i run this shit like CARDI-o" that line's so delicious. Benito and Balvin provided fun verses, love the references. I just think this song is a great pop song. Stream Sistar - I Like That, it was robbed on the k-pop rate

**bulforster** (10): This is a towering achievement for her and not one I'm sure she'll ever be able to match.

**hikkaru** (10): smash

**ignitethephoenix** (10): definitely her best, a good fusion of hip hop and Latin music

**laurent1683** (10): My melodic musician ass is relieved for these beautiful pianos and samples. Has everything you need, multiple beat changes per verse, everyone's performance is amazing, Cardi is at her peak

**rickikardashian** (10): This is like the 3rd time we’ve rated this in a 4 month span, and each time this has been a good option for my 11 but i always give it to another song. Still, this is an amazing song and easily one of the best hits from last decade. I think Todd In The Shadows explained it very well, seeing 3 POC celebrating their success is such a joyous way is just infectious, and it also helps that they have charisma and personality for days. This is everything but boring, I love it and fucking god eventually I’ll have to give it my 11 in a rate, this is just ridiculous.

**sawayamas** (10): loved this summer smash from first listen

**selegend** (10): cultural reset

**wavingwolves** (10): i didn't ask to be born latina no mas tuve suerte... like unironically. also bad bunny can get it sorry he's so hot

**worlds-okayest666** (10): I GOT THE SERVE BITCH LET’S GO!!!

**yoshifan823** (10): Pure joy you can put right in your ears.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): is this my favorite things but make it rap

**stryxen** (9.5): they said t h e y l i k e i t l i k e t h a t

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9.5): this song would be perfect is the third verse didn't drag on - it makes the song lose momentum. cardi's energy really shines through here.

**kappyko** (9): this is so fucking good sorry bad bunny's support makes up for Cardi being... ughHHHHH

**steelstepladder** (9): I like it

**TragicKingdom1** (9): a victory lap of a single which is kinda weird considering it was only like 6 months after her debut single but we're here for it

**waluigiest** (9): song of the summer 2018 I can’t be wrong

**wardrum5** (9): I don't like either feature but the first verse and the beat are amazing

**plastichaxan** (8.5): going to parties this song plays every single time and it kept getting better and better for me!

**bbfan132** (8): fun track

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): In my heart it’s a 10 for introducing me to El Conejo Malo.

**lapascalia** (8): pretty good

**Nickl00** (8): I think the features go on a bit long but still one of the best songs of the summer

**starlitsuns** (8): I’ve never heard the two verses from J Balvin and Bad Bunny before listening to this on Spotify and this is outright racism on the radio

**twat\_brained** (8): Oh right, I was commenting on "Sway" being sampled wondering why someone structured a song around such an oldie, yet we all ate this up in 2018. It still goes off, but the only barrier to a 10 is Bad Bunny's verse.

#I (don't) like it like that

**alwayswords** (7): shouldve only been cardi [2]

**bandnitos** (7): eh

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): this song sounds like my cancelled vacation :(((((((

**untutorable** (5.5): a fun song but really overplayed

**materialqirl** (2.5): this song is alright but it got way overplayed

DaHumanTorch: # Cardi B

---

**Overall Average**: 6.813 **// Average Controversy:** 2.057

---

**rickikardashian** (8.725): im glad we did include cardi but like, homegirl isn't up and coming anymore, she’s came and is up already

**akanewasright** (7.625): Cardi B is controversial for good reason, but I honestly really like her as a pop girl.

**waluigiest** (7.500): I’m sorry but she is quite established at this point. Also justice for I Do

**yoshifan823** (7.000): just exudes star power and personality, it comes so naturally to her, I can’t think of a female rapper who has that, even Nicki and Megan and Missy all felt like they had to work at that but Cardi just belongs in the spotlight

**HerculesMeow** (6.875): Why is this the TikTok rate + Cardi B

**bespectacIed** (6.750): The way I wanna tiptoe on rating her bc of her controversies but she really is a capable pop rapper, I cannot deny. She presents her music really palatable to the locals, and sometimes she really has an enjoyable flow, so her success is not surprising. Yeah she doesn't write her own bars who cares, so doesn't Drake.

**kappyko** (6.250): not mad at it but she already upcame, leftcame, rightcame and downcame by the time this rate has revealed.

**selegend** (6.250): who cares if she doesn’t write, she knows how to deliver

**bulforster** (6.125): Yeah she was a bit overrated by critics but she still deserves at least a bit of credit for breaking open the floodgates for this new wave of female rap.

**laurent1683** (6.000): Great in invasion of privacy era but she's has not doing amazing sweetie recently

This is my favorite Megan song in the rate, though I'm not surprised Savage and Big Ole Freak placed higher than it. Another song with a famous TikTok dance, this is just a banger. The sword sample is so well-utilized, though some of you did find it annoying. A worthy placement for this.

Favorite Line(s) - I like a dick with a little bit of curve // I'm a banana, they gotta split // I'll break a ho in half like a Kit-Kat

---

#I go shoppin'

**sweetnsoursauce1** (11): as a white australian my opinion is not really that relevant for rap but this SLAPS, the beat goes hard, it is CATCHY AS FUCK, so many funny lines and i never get bored. it also makes me feel like a bad bitch. tbh this deserves the success of savage and i'm bitter

**bespectacIed** (10): Real hot girl shit, ah 😛 Her flow is literally insane.

**CritneySpearz** (10): I was playing this at work and a fairly important higher-up of my company walked in waiting for me to finish something and I couldn’t whip out my phone to change the song so he stood there and I was so fucking uncomfortable sksksksks anyways DICK

**InfernalSolstice** (10): every single lyric is fucking perfection

**mayolizard** (10): ok classic

**plastichaxan** (10): megan is on another level

**radiofan15** (10): Peter Pan has left the chart

**skargardin** (10): i live for raunchy megan and this gives me everything and then some

**steelstepladder** (10): Best song of Meghan's newest effort

**waluigiest** (10): her flow is legendary already

**wavingwolves** (10): a banger and a half but everytime i see a 13 old girl do the tiktok dance and lipsync this i get a little uncomfortable especially at the "he's a sweetie kiss him when he eat it" with the eating motion god...

**bbfan132** (9.5): holy fuck this goes hard, i love practically about this

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): not much substance, but there doesnt need to be. her charisma and confidence carries this song. a bad bitch anthem

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the sound of effect of a sword gives me life and this was standout for me the first time I heard it

**1998tweety** (9): Big bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): how vulgar, I love it

**HerculesMeow** (9): I think this is the best song on her new project (bar the Beyonce remix of Savage)

**laurent1683** (9): This makes me wanna buy some medieval swords

**stryxen** (9): ever since tiktok found this song they’ve remixed every song with the slicing sword sound over and over again

**twat\_brained** (8.4): first time I heard this was at this urban-style clothing retailer, and it caught me off-guard because who's allowing a song this profane to be played in a public setting in broad daylight?

**bandnitos** (8): why are there so many swords sounds

**lapascalia** (8): also fire

**Nickl00** (8): seeing my moms reaction to this song will always make me like it more

**rickikardashian** (8): ladies and gentlemen, the volume inside of this bus is ASTRONOMICAL

#A little bit of curve

**AnimationJava** (7): i like the sword sound sample

**yoshifan823** (7): did Cupcakke write this for Megan?

**awhile2** (6): “have a n*** but i think ill have another” is a bar and a half

Megan's first #1, courtesy of the Beyonce remix, is certainly a bop, Do I think it was a tad overrated in this rate> Yes...but it definitely deserves its Day 1 placement.

Favorite Line(s) - Let's play a game, Simon says I'm still that bitch // I'm that bitch, been that bitch, still that bitch. Will forever be that bitch

---

#Classic, bougie, ratchet

**bespectacIed** (11): The prettiest girl. The chosen one. The prom queen. I am thankful for what this song has achieved for Megan, even though it shouldn't have been her first number 1. Savage was a song tailor made to be a hit, to be danced by millions, to be ate up by the GP, to be a cultural event ... AND DAMN RIGHT IT WAS. A perfect song made even more perfect by a remix with the greatest artist to every grace the earth. Savage Remix 🐎🐝 >>>>>>>>>>>>>

**wavingwolves** (11): the remix is great but the og is the real deal sorry bey but i love megan's verses

**akanewasright** (10): Both versions of the song are absolutely stellar, but I think I like this one more? At the very least, “I’m the hood Mona Lisa” is one of the best opening lines to a rap verse I’ve heard in a long time.

**alwayswords** (10): the intro chefskiss

**hunnybee12** (10): so happy she hit no. 1 today!! savage is a cultural phenomenon and feels like a natural no. 1 hit. p.s. https://www.tiktok.com/@fatherco0n/video/6806378959408925958?lang=en

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I prefer the remix slightly but it’s a great song

**mayolizard** (10): aaah

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): no beyonce saying "okay" so no 11 but so close

**skargardin** (10): banger!!

**stryxen** (10): :P aehh :P uhh also there’s something in the background at some points that sounds like an incoming skype call

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop, remix outsold majorly outsold though.

**AnimationJava** (9): as much as i wish the remix was included, i understand why not, it still bops alone tho

**bandnitos** (9): i still can't believe that she got beyonce to hop on this

**bbfan132** (9): remix outsold but this is still great

**gannade** (9): beyonce remix goes off way harder but this is good too

**hikkaru** (9): bey remix is an 11

**InfernalSolstice** (9): remix outsold but still banger

**lapascalia** (9): will indeed forever be that bitch

**materialqirl** (9): wouldve gone #1 if they kept the beginning on the remix ngl

**plastichaxan** (9): the way both this and the remix offer something different and are bops yup

**radiofan15** (9): It needs some extra Queen B to fully connect tho...

**waluigiest** (9): Great song, remix would be a straight 10

**bulforster** (8): Unfortunately I heard the remix first so this version sounds a bit empty to me.

**cremeebrulee** (8): the remix is a 10 tho

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its really missing stuff without beyonce

**laurent1683** (8): anyone prefer the original to the remix??? i know that's a weird opinion, but it prefer it being short and not dragging. The beat is good but not 4 minutes worthy

**steelstepladder** (8): I'm assuming this isn't the Beyonce remix otherwise it would score even higher

**Sundraliz** (8): I heard the remix first and it totally outshines this.

**twat\_brained** (8): of all the songs to pop off on TikTok why this? i wish it'd been BOF

**wardrum5** (8): listening to the version without Beyonce feels so empty

**yoshifan823** (8): Beyonce really does make this song better

#Sassy, moody, nasty

**Awkward\_King** (7): okay now listening to the original i can't love it as much because of how good the remix is but the original is still a v good song on it's own

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): We love a #1 hit! (But actually we’re just mild on it)

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): im so glad this is gearing up to potentially be a big hit for her! she totally deserves it! she IS that bitch. the song feels a little slow, but simon says shes still that bitch :)

**Nickl00** (7): I’m not a huge fan but the remix is amazing

**sawayamas** (7): it's a bop but now that savage remix came out.. I started liking the original less bc the remix is just so amazing

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i kind of forced myself to listen to this song bc i figured it would be big at clubs/parties when quaratine is over so it grew on me a little but then the remix came out and thats a 10

**selegend** (5): it’s kinda boring

THIS SONG...I love it so much. My favorite Megan song pre-Suga and I'm so happy it was the highest placement for her. This was actually in second place for the longest time until it slipped out of the top 3 down to #4.

Favorite Line(s) - I need that neck like a muh'fuckin pendant // Bitch it's Tina Snow, they love me 'cause I'm cold

---

#Tina Snow supremacists

**sawayamas** (11): MY GIRL DID WHAT SHE HAD TO DO HERE.. one of my favorite songs EVER

**awhile2** (10): megans at her best when she combines smooth R&B with bangers

**Awkward\_King** (10): serve absolute goddamn serve best megan song

**bbfan132** (10): i had never heard this but it’s amazing, i love the almost dreamy instrumental

**bespectacIed** (10): THIS IS HOW YOU ENTER THE FUCKING GAME. I remember the joy of twitter when this made Megan finally enter the Hot 100, a moment I won't forget. Body positivity anthem, godly sample, great flow and bars. Hope this new girl blows up and goes to number 1 soon 🙏🙏🙏

**CritneySpearz** (10): ho anthem

**HerculesMeow** (10): Tina Snow needed more representation in this! Freak Nasty and Hot Girl are soooo good

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this song made me fall in love with megan. this song is so confidently sexy. she doesnt try to hard to be something shes not, she KNOWS shes that bitch. the 90s-early 2000's influences on this song add so much more to the vibe.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A cheek clapper

**mayolizard** (10): ok megan has a million 10’s so. Choosing an 11 hard

**skargardin** (10): tina snow lowkey my favorite megan thee stallion alias

**steelstepladder** (10): Arguably deserves to win the rate.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): for some reason i put off listening to this song till this rate but OMG i see why everyone loves it. also is that Megan's singing voice because i want to hear more

**TragicKingdom1** (10): immaculately produced, super catchy, and megan has the most personality of anyone in the rate. peridot!

**twat\_brained** (10): this is the sequel to Adina Howard's "Freak Like Me" we needed. Everyone say "thank you, Megan"

**wavingwolves** (10): this chorus is so smooth and it makes me feel things... whew

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big Ole Freak? More like Big Ole Bop

**bulforster** (9.5): My introduction to Megan, no choice but to stan.

**bandnitos** (9): i love her

**rickikardashian** (9): [me as soon as this song starts](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/223/727/632.jpg)

**waluigiest** (9): she’s such a skilled rapper it’s truly insane

**yoshifan823** (9): this song just sounds like fun sex

**stryxen** (8.1): Meg’s quality is so consistent that this is one of her more average songs and it’s still god tier

**ImADudeDuh** (8): a bop

**lapascalia** (8): yep she is

**materialqirl** (8): points for the SWV sample perry@

**starlitsuns** (8): Megan is the captain and that’s all I have to say here.

#Big Ole No

**radiofan15** (7.6): She sounds technically capable... but the production feels so generic it doesn't do her any favors...

**AnimationJava** (7.5): an iconic breakout from megan

**Nickl00** (7): it helped her get attention but she vastly improved later on

DaHumanTorch: # Megan Thee Stallion

---

**Overall Average**: 8.182 **// Average Controversy:** 1.610

---

**bespectacIed** (10.000): My favorite rapper in this rate, the one whose mixtapes I still religiously listen to. Tina Snow was a brilliant entrance to the world, Fever was so high quality it should have been a debut album, Suga is a show of force. Rooting for this girl for years then seeing her finally go NUMBER ONE like it's destined for her, is one of life's greatest payoffs. No new rapper has me more captivated with her presence, personality, and body of work more than Meg. A bonus that she has my fave's approval. Megan's got a point, she's an icon, she's a legend, AND SHE IS THE MOMENT, now come on now ....

**cremeebrulee** (9.000): my queen!! choosing only one of her songs to give an 11 to was sooo difficult because her catalog is so flawless. i cant wait to see her get even more success in the future

**twat\_brained** (8.713): the hype is real. Megan is the future of hip-hop.

**akanewasright** (8.375): Megan is a goddamn star. She’s distinctive as hell, she’s talented as fuck, and she has the perfect attitude for the job. I can’t wait to see where she goes next.

**HerculesMeow** (8.000): the princess of H town! My personal queen

**yoshifan823** (7.875): all of these women work hard but Megan feels like every single inch she’s gained she’s done so because she worked for it, so it’s great to see how far she’s gone. She absolutely deserves all of it.

**selegend** (7.625): she deserves her success

**laurent1683** (7.625): I really really like her but I wish she could show the same gritty style on some weirder, more melodic beats (I don't really like her poppier cuts)

**Sundraliz** (7.500): After marathoning this whole rate I can really see how Megan is on a different level than most of these girls.

**Awkward\_King** (0): dojo white supremacist nicki minjaj pedophile

**didney-worl** (0): This is going to be a bloodbath.

**gannade** (0): the amount of pedophilia

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (0): dOjAh sounds good ofc I’m just sad they got rid of her first verse. Nicki snaps as always, but the beat change is choppy. Also “put this cookie on quarantine” is one of the corniest lyrics of all time. I like it, but i wish they would’ve done more to change the vibe on the chorus like more Nicki backing vocals.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): the fact there is more than one remix automatically makes this a 0 for this rate

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (11): this is a REMIX. the whole vibe change is amazing, this song is so pretty. Beyoncé adds vocals. It feels like a duet. She’s not just tacked on. Megan is still very dominant but it’s Beyoncé’s style.

This was my 11...until Damn Daniel came out. This is Doja's best song and I can't see her every topping this. Every line is iconic and hilarious, the chorus is so incredibly catchy. Rico also snaps and adds a whole different energy to the song which I think really completes it.

Favorite Line(s) - Beat the pussy up call PETA // Make a bitch sick diarrhea // Hair grow long like Chia // Spank you very much

---

#Thank you very much

**bandnitos** (11): this song has so many good memories attached to it

**bbfan132** (11): easily my favorite song in the rate - doja slays here but rico’s verse is perfection… excellent

**HerculesMeow** (11): this shit slaps. SPANK YOU VERY MUCH

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (11): my favorite doja song! it sounds like the most colorful, fun 90's video game. it doesnt take itself too seriously and has so many jokes/ great wordplay. the flow is so smooth, and switches speeds and styles with ease. also ricos verse is the perfect addition to add a bit of intensity, as she has similarly good wordplay. overall, they ate, like grits madea 😚

**lapascalia** (11): this collab is perfect and it’s a banger

**letsallpoo** (11): mozart been real quiet since this dropped

**plastichaxan** (11): these two joining forces was a cultural reset yup

**TheBoySmiles** (11): HAIR GROW LONG LIKE NIA. This is everything I've ever wanted in a song.

**1998tweety** (10): Bop, Doja and Rico both eat this up! I wish this got to be her breakout hit, oh well.

**alwayswords** (10): rico munched

**awhile2** (10): they both kill it. Honestly cant choose who had the better verse here. Love how they both reference sia

**Awkward\_King** (10): THEY SAY RICO YOU SO NASTY I SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH HE JUST WANNA EAT ME LIKE SOME CANDY BUT IM NOT HIS BUTTERCUP

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the funniest songs in this rate. I looooooove this collab so much, it was such a great mix of Doja's delicateness (lana is fuming right now) and Rico's punkness. The bars are funny as heck and the video is so fun. Rico's verse was my fave part of the song, such a serve (make a bitch sick, DIARRHEA). An awesome moment in pop rap.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this song was so good it convinced me to give Doja another chance after f*ggotgate. Also Rico peaked with this one, don’t @me.

**hunnybee12** (10): the beat, the video, the charisma… her best song so far

**ignitethephoenix** (10): both of them ate

**mayolizard** (10): boobers

**Nickl00** (10): god I love Rico and this is such a great collab

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): never heard any doja outside say so and now i'm shook

**sawayamas** (10): WHEW my favorite doja song ever.. both her and rico were amazing on this track and I literally had it on repeat for weeks when it came out because I loved it that much

**selegend** (10): now this should’ve been #1

**untutorable** (10): one of my fave collabs from 2019 it's just so good

**waluigiest** (10): doja’s best song by far, thank you Rico!!!!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): deserved to be a global smash

**yoshifan823** (10): my two favorites on this list together singing about Sister Sister and their titties, what could be better?

**materialqirl** (9.5): my twins big like tia tamera

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): can’t relate cries

**CritneySpearz** (9): this song first introduced me to rico, I am forever grateful

**skargardin** (9): banger

**steelstepladder** (9): Rico just eats this track alive

**Sundraliz** (9): The best feature Doja has had to date (:

**AnimationJava** (8.5): MY TWINS BIG LIKE TIA TAMERA

**bulforster** (8.5): The chorus is a tad lifeless but the beat is sinister as fuck and Rico in particular sounds amazing over it.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): this beat is just so infectious

**akanewasright** (8): This is awesome, holy shit! I assume that Liar is out by now. My friend that made a TikTok to that song STANS Rico, and this is honestly the first time I’m hearing her outside of the Ringtone remix, and OH MY GOD. Rico is incredible.

**kappyko** (8): rhyme scheme is annoying but its still that good

**nootnoot781** (8): the way rico carries this track >>>

**agentofscranton** (7): the twitches movies do be slappin tho

#Spank you very much

**stryxen** (7): ohhh my goddd this gets on my nerves but I also love it

**wavingwolves** (7): make a bitch sick DIARRHEA!! rico makes this song, she's so good

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): kinda gives me a headache

**twat\_brained** (4): I mean… there's definitely *some* resemblance between Doja and the Mowry twins, but this is NOT it. Rico's verse kinda saves this, but I thought her momentum would falter following "MOOO!" up with this. Thankfully I was proven wrong, but that doesn't excuse this song's wack production and underwhelming hook

This song came out the day before the rate came out and was the most last minute addition in Popheads rate history...and it was worth it. You could call recency bias but most people here were discovering this for the first time anyways, and also we are now 2 months after release. Everything about this song is perfection. The verses, the feature, the refrain, the production, the outro....OH GOD THE OUTRO...This will definitely be my favorite song to come out this year and I'm so happy it made Top 2. #DamnDanielForAllStars4

Favorite Line(s) - What's up, it's Felicia, hi. Boys try to holler and I tell 'em bye // I just let em fall like Humpty Dumpty

---

#TK and I's alt accounts

**akanewasright** (11): Yeah, if Bree doesn’t blow up, there is no justice in the world. This is one of the best throwback songs I’ve ever fucking heard. Both girls kill it, and that beat is undeniably. Best song in the rate.

**Awkward\_King** (11): we had juice. juice came. juice was iconic. it happened. but right now. what's happening? damn daniel is happening. damn daniel IS the moment, the anthem of popheadscirclejerk, as it deserves to be. i don't know a better song. 11. FUCK WITH ALL THE CREDIT CARD SCAMMERS AND THE FRAUDSTERS

**CritneySpearz** (11): holy fuck this song is so good? I may have to stan..

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): We literally waited until this was released to do this rate, its power… Anyways this is a good use of both women on the track, they sound great and the slight differences in their temperaments/flows are neatly highlighted by the song in cool, subtle ways. I do wish they fleshed out the story in the lyrics a bit but I get the gist of it. The production is really fun, I love the ‘80s sounding synths (especially on the bridge, they always make me want to listen to “Aquaman” by Walk the Moon for some reason) but my only complaint is that weird scream sound effect that plays in the background? I listen to this when running and it always catches me off-guard and makes me think someone’s running to attack me.

**kappyko** (11): popheads hear a gated drum and actively recoil liek how unoriginal omg like Okay bitch what do you want its a banger get over urself

**rickikardashian** (11): Look, will I love this song as much as I do as I do now in a future? No clue, but this for sure was the best discovery I made on this rate, and I’ obsessed with it. It’s so fun and interesting and I can’t get bored of it. That switch up at the end blew my mind the first time I listened to this, and each time I play this I’m just looking forward to it

**selegend** (11): not even recency bias, it’s just THAT good

**starlitsuns** (11): streaming this on r/popheadscirclejerk is the last rule along with streaming Juice, and I have to say I agree with this rule

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this song is officially the fastest turnaround from release to being included in a rate at just 2 days. and i'm glad we did because it's so creative with a ton of personality and a really unique blend of 80s synths, new jack swing and new orleans bounce

**1998tweety** (10): Good LORDE this song shits on most of the stuff in this rate. Verses are good, chorus is catchy. Really want her to blow up.

**agentofscranton** (10): : wayament this is literally the first time i’m hearing this song and oh my god it’s literally one of the best songs of the year? whY is this not everywhere?!?

**bespectacIed** (10): IF THIS DOESN'T GET TO TOP 10 I WILL SHOW MY BOOBS. One of the best songs in the rate. This is insane, the production is so pristine holy shit. This is basically a pop song. Two of my fave upcoming rap girls joining forces in this high octane collab damn it SHOULD HAVE BEEN MY 11

**mayolizard** (10): ok this is amazing period

**Nickl00** (10): ik Ik recency bias but it’s so much fun and Tate kills it again

**sawayamas** (10): they both did what they had to do here.. the song feels like 20 different songs but it works perfectly and it's a banger!

**stryxen** (10): the way this actually gives me chills

**Sundraliz** (10): Dude I love this, fun and captivating the whole way through. After listening to this for the rate I started playing it every morning while making breakfast.

**twat\_brained** (10): okay these synths pop off. And that buildup? flawless. Not to mention, Tate is just out here delivering two immaculate verses on two different girlies' songs, why doesn't she have any songs here as a lead artist? Moreover, why haven't I heard about this absolute banger until this rate?

**untutorable** (10): it's like the boy is mine except instead of fighting over him they just collectively drop the boy in question. also this beat is amazing

**wavingwolves** (10): the fucking outro... BIG yes!!!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this didnt hit on first listen but when it hit it HIT. HARD.

**bulforster** (9.5): The 80s pop inspired beat is everything and the outro is the best sung part of any Bree song.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): bree runway and yung baby tate invented rap music i could not believe

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9.5): everything about this song works

**bbfan132** (9): i love the synths in the background but this song in general is awesome

**hunnybee12** (9): the outro! :0

**ignitethephoenix** (9): really dig the 90’s vibes on this.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): gay anthem

**materialqirl** (9): omg this is a bop TOO

**nootnoot781** (9): well make that 2 pleasant surprises. might have to check out her discog after this omg

**steelstepladder** (9): The old school production sends me

**lapascalia** (8): i hope this girl gets big, she’s great

**waluigiest** (8): okay this is fun and clever! A cute lil bop

**AnimationJava** (7): better watch your back!

**plastichaxan** (7): what's the opposite of a grower? i wanted to like this so much more

**yoshifan823** (7): does this sample Jump? The last minute is great.

#Say that shit better watch your back...

**awhile2** (6): ok its a good song but are we really gonna let them get away with naming a song damn daniel in 2020

**laurent1683** (6): This one's okay. Sounds low-quality and uninspired. I like the Bounce elements

#You especially

**radiofan15** (3.2): It deserved higher but because y'all overhyped it I'm gonna give it a lower score because y'all put my expectations way too high...

DaHumanTorch: # Bree Runway

---

**Overall Average**: 8.525 **// Average Controversy:** 1.679

---

**Awkward\_King** (10.500): she IS the moment. the best working artist right now i said it.

**agentofscranton** (10.500): deserves to be a megastar but 2020 will not allow us to have good things

**bespectacIed** (10.000): She's the future. The way her style is always very early 2000s but with a bit more polish of today's technology. She's the Rina Sawayama of rap methinks

**bulforster** (8.500): I love her stauch commitment to both pop and rap. As well as Damn Daniel everyone should stream Be Runway, specifically 2ON and Big Racks which would both be 11 contenders for me if they were in the rate.

This song just inched out to be the winner with the last few submissions of the rate (most of the time it was Tia Tamera winning). Is this a bit of a predictable win? Yes. But this song goes off and is one of Doja's strongest songs to date so it definitely deserves the top spot. Also the fact that this was for a movie soundtrack and was this good...a smash if there ever was one.

Favorite Line(s) - First thing a girl did was bop // I been the stallion you been the seahorse

---

#Stallion

**1998tweety** (11): Love this song so much. The chorus SLAPS, the verses SLAP, this deserves to be her next mega hit.

**alwayswords** (11): the second pre-chorus goes so hard phew

**fluviusfluit** (11): Harley Quinn in the club

**hikkaru** (11): Boss B11tch! there really is no other option

**ignitethephoenix** (11): this is honestly her best song and it deserves better success wise

**laurent1683** (11): First time I heard it, i danced in my room for 20 minutes with this 2 minute song on repeat. I wasn't not blown away by it at the 10th listen

**awhile2** (10): runner up for my 11. Literally the perfect amalgamation of nicki and azaela’s sounds but its still distinctly doja

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is real rap music. men don'tk now shit

**bandnitos** (10): i love how this got to #100 on the hot 100 and then dipped

**bulforster** (10): The charisma is off the charts.

**cremeebrulee** (10): every line in this is a serve

**InfernalSolstice** (10): was my 11 until the last second

**mayolizard** (10): im a bitch.

**nootnoot781** (10): i can’t believe her two best songs are called b-word bitch, and aren’t produced by that pig.

**plastichaxan** (10): this would be the perfect 11 if it was longer. a bop and a half

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): "first thing a girl did was bop" periodt

**sawayamas** (10): BOPPPPPP

**stryxen** (10): I go absolutely bonkers listening to this

**Sundraliz** (10): She killed this like I cannot stress how much this slaps.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this is one of those songs i knew 10 seconds in i would be obsessed and it's still true 4 months later

**twat\_brained** (10): Great as "Experiment On Me" is, this is the definitive standout of the Birds of Prey soundtrack and is shortlisted as a Top 25 song of 2020 for me.

**untutorable** (10): just a whole banger

**waluigiest** (10): STUNNING. Energetic, clever, silly, bossy. This song was a moment. Even more clout for a music video that just kinda looks like she wrote herself into Birds of Prey.

**AnimationJava** (9): methinks nicki should've given a remix to this song, she fits the vibe so well and it goes off

**bbfan132** (9): short but packs a brutal punch

**bespectacIed** (9): The way we've rated a 212 knockoff before we've rated any Azealia song makes me fume. Even r/indieheads has rated 212!!!! But anyways this song is good because of that awesome house beat. The lyrics are Doja-style hilarious. I've lost a lot of weight (allegedly) exercising to this song.

**lapascalia** (9): the only flaw of this song is that it’s not long enough

**materialqirl** (9): i aint tryna

**Nickl00** (9): the fact that this is a soundtrack song is honestly incredible

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.8): My only exposure to this song was during those videos that had clips of all the songs on the Popheads Charts and I for sure thought it was a Rico Nasty song… oops. Anyways I like the house-like production on this track. Low-key I could see this winning because people love it so much.

**akanewasright** (8): This goes really fucking hard.

**kappyko** (8): feel like this is gonna be her highest rated song cuz a) no dr luke b) still relatively poppy

**steelstepladder** (8): Best Nicki Minaj song in years

#Seahorse

**selegend** (7): proof that she can make a good pop song without Tyson Trax but it’s also too short

**starlitsuns** (7): Doja really made a hit off of Birds of Prey, too bad I can’t relate to it

**wavingwolves** (7): SAID I TOOK AND I RAN FOR IT I WON THEN I STAND ON IT MONEY ON THE FLOOR WHEN WE DANCE ON IT SHINE BRIGHT LET THEM PUT A TAN ON IT!!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the song is meh but “i took it and i ran for it” is iconic

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5.5): a bit boring but for a movie soundtrack song it goes hard af. I feel like model strutting every time I listen to it

**gannade** (5): a lil noisy

DaHumanTorch: # Doja Cat

---

**Overall Average**: 7.821 **// Average Controversy:** 1.961

---

**Sundraliz** (9.111): All of my friends hate me because I will not shut up about Doja Cat. It's honestly embarrasing. She really does bite Nicki's Pink Friday era and of course I was all over that at the time so like... makes sense. And the more I listen to Hot Pink the more I fall in love with it. Anyway I am so invested in her I love her singing and rapping one-two punch.

**cremeebrulee** (8.944): i know she's been in some hot water lately but i can't deny that she puts out some incredible work. i'm giving her high scores but i'm not happy about it lol

**twat\_brained** (8.611): this rate is rife with women I value as artists but less so as human beings. While Doja is not without her questionable past, I commend her for taking the criticism and accountability to heart, apologizing and promising to do better. Unlike some OTHERS I see here. And honestly? Amala's got more potential here than anyone else in this rate. She's the one to watch moving forward.

**agentofscranton** (8.556): whew the internal conflict i had giving these scores

**waluigiest** (8.222): please let the record show I did my scores before doja cat rlly went extra off the rails when I rated them she was just regular homophobic

**bespectacIed** (8.222): Hello, thanks for posting to /r/popheads. Unfortunately, your post was removed for the following reason(s). This post appears to bring about arguments instead of discussion. Please ensure any further posts are given due consideration before submitting. For any further queries, please message the mods.

**yoshifan823** (8.100): it’s still incredibly hard to believe that Doja is a number one artist. it’s very rare that my weird dumb internet niche artist interests get any mainstream attention let along all of the mainstream attention. I hope she never stops being weird. (And also drops that rapist as soon as legally possible)

**laurent1683** (8.000): Even if she isn't the best, she has BUDGET and uses it well

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.644): I hate that she has some of the best songs in the rate… ugh, I know the allegations against her were more or less disproven but that I didn’t like her before and I don’t like her now.

**letsallpoo** (6.444): 15 thousand times

**kappyko** (6.222): So I'm making a callout post on my Twitter dot com:

**selegend** (5.444): she knows what she did
