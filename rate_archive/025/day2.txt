Thank you to /u/napsandnetflix for doing day one! He was great (but not as great as me). And thank you to Poo and his program for being amazing!

Like yesterday, today will be mostly filler 👀 but there may be some surprises as well 👀 

Some stats I forgot to post yesterday but aren't that important:

Average average: 7.3153

Controversy average: 1.9566

**Lowest Scores:** (1 x2) cyborglilith, fifthchevron

The first verse was a total bop but the chorus is a drag. Put your heart into it, Avril! It's a sweet closer to the album though, and the lyrics are nice optimistic resolution to totally angsty teenager album. Also, I'm truly sorry for the shitpost I'll probably skip it after 30 seconds.

---
#I just want to see you Nekkid Nekkid Nekkid

**MrSwearword**: "she actually manages to sell this song. Unexpected joy to close this album."

**peppersmith67**: "fitting that this album would end with Avril falling victim to the demon that is horniness."

**tevinterimperium**: "this is the 3rd best song on the album after complicated and i'm with you"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "decent song"

**TeamAwesome4**: "Passable closer."

**musicotic**: "A favorite from my youth. 11-worthy"

**eklxtreme**: "it's pretty alright"

#We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off

**skiddos**: "I'm gonna go listen to The Best Damn Thing to wake myself up" screaming i miss you /u/skiddos

**fifthchevron**: "She sounds bored."

**zamomattel**: "Cute closer, but she could have done better"

**mokitsu**: "forgettable!"

**cyborglilith**: "terrible ending to the album"

**calltehshots**: "Kind of a dull way to end a pretty good album. It's like she threw all the filler tracks at the end."

#I am Basic but Shawn is Hot

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "If the comment spankky puts is "I wish I could see Shawn naked" can i get gold?" no

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "if spankky is doing this rate this is where he'd put a "what I want shawn to be" comment"

#Jailbaited

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Avril was 17 when this was recorded so everyone who listened to this is now a registered sex offender."

**rickikardashian**: "having to google “Avril Lavigne naked” is a bit awkward once you have to do it"

**Jailhousepoop**: "“Yeah, I'm naked Oh oh, yeah yeah” Me too Avril, me too."

**10footnotes**: "Promo: Listen to Naked by Kirstin because 1) everything from her EP is golden and 2) it fits well with this song (which is also nice!)." how about we listen to more kelly avril and pink instead

This song is the reason why Bieber is crazy these days. She made the original My World, we all just live in it. 

This sounds like a TV theme song for a show like Degrassi? It's like *really* white, creepily optimistic, and strangely cheery, especially in the context of *Let Go*. It's kind of catchy and fun to sing along too, but also just really weird. KT Tunstall does this sound better, but I feel like I'm the only one that's gonna think the songs are similar lol.

---

#It Really Does Sound Like a Theme Song

**TeamAwesome4**: "Song's got an "opening of a high school drama" vibe"

**MrSwearword**: "down to the Tomboy shit, this is if the TV show Caitlin’s Way was a song."

**zamomattel**: "This vaguely remind me of a Westlife song, but I'm actually into it"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Canadian artists like this phrase for some reason jesus" I'm just gonna assume this comment is about Drake and his acting stint in Degrassi

#It's Avril's world

**rickikardashian**: "“indieheads might not sound deep”' idk what this means i'm just gonna assume it's a compliment because indieheads has trash taste 

**cyborglilith**: "bop"

**awryj**: "The only introvert anthem, Alessia Cara who?"

**wearingsox**: "This was my FAV when I was a kid. I felt so scandalous when she said “fried chicken ass” LOL, now it’s a minor bop."

**musicotic**: "Tfw the lowest score on the album is a 9.4. Some bad lyrics here (hours showers)"

**calltehshots**: "A #relatablegirl bop"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is my jam."

**eklxtreme**: "it's very carefree and sunshiney"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I looked up the lyrics for this one and honestly they kind of read like a Shakespeare sonnet when they’re just written out." this probably isnt a compliment but respect shakespeare please

#WW3 is about to start and it's Avril's fault

**jess_22**: "filler"

**therokinrolla**: "biebs did it better. twice." he really didn't

**Jailhousepoop**: "Worst song on the album. Sounds like an opening for a cheap sitcom."

**mokitsu**: "boring filler!"

#TRUTH ONLY

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "sounds like a good Taylor Swift song"

**10footnotes**: "I love Torn."

Definitely one of the stinkers on *Let Go*. Avril's vocal performance here always rubbed me the wrong way.

---

#The Irony?

**zamomattel**: "I mean this is a bit ordinary but it is ok with me"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "A title that lies. This song just sounds so fully like any other song on the album."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "it's ok but loses a few points for trying to say some deep shit like "I'd rather be anything but ordinary" and then going and making ordinary ass music."

**jess_22**: "my ears hurt after listening to Avril's vocals on the chorus" omg i wasnt the only one

**therokinrolla**: "this is anything but good"

**awryj**: "Funny that this song is absolutely ordinary"

**cyborglilith**: "BORING"

#Buy Most Girls by Hailee on iTunes (again)

**agentofscranton**: "my name’s Avril and I’m not like other girls, I’m kind of a weirdo rawr means I love you in dinosaur xD"

**ImADudeDuh**: "insert any of those "Most girls vs me" comics here"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Did she just invent scene culture?"

**MrSwearword**: "this song is a literal walking Spencer’s Gifts customer; DRECKITUDE."

**skiddos**: "we're ONE and the SAME"

#Why wasn't Michelle Branch part of this rate?

**calltehshots**: "One of my favorite Avril songs ever. (I also constantly think about how much better an already great song would be if someone like Michelle Branch was singing this but I'll move on lol)"

**fifthchevron**: "Kind of Michelle Branch-ish..."

#talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before

**peppersmith67**: "I have the biggest smile on my face right now"

**mokitsu**: "random queen"

**TeamAwesome4**: ""turbulent, succulent, opulent" Queen of vocabulary."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "yas mom slay me with those belting"

**MissyBee37**: "I remember this song scaring me a little bit, in the best way possible. It asks great questions that most people aren't so ready to ask out loud; I love that bravery and honesty about her."

**wearingsox**: "The lyrics are a little silly but I LOVE the chorus."

**musicotic**: "The chorus is E V E R Y T H I N G. Great use of left vs right audio"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "beautiful, accident, turbulent, succulent, opulent, permanent

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is a cute bop."

Easily the worst track on Breakaway. The production and Kelly's vocals just don't match. It starts off with a quiet buildup, and you're just waiting for the epic chorus, and then you get ... that. It's pretty much the three minute song equivalent of waiting for Lady Gaga to save pop music again and getting Perfect Illusion.

#You Found Me... giving this a good score!

**poppinmmolly**: "this used to by fave on this album"

**TeamAwesome4**: "The chorus of this song gives me pure, unadulterated hope."

**awryj**: "It's enjoyable, but kind of generic"

**jess_22**: "why have i never heard this before? a true underrated gem"

**rickikardashian**: "The early 00’s loved to use that intro sound" it really did and i loved every minute of it

**musicotic**: "S L E P T O N"

**calltehshots**: "I looooove this song. One of my favorite non-singles from the album. This sounds like something that would play in the inspirational montage scene in a Disney Channel movie and that's an instant 10."

**eklxtreme**: "nice melody and chorus"

#You Found Me... giving this a bad score

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I hate to say it but this is the point at which the album starts losing steam. Every single track up until this point was a masterpiece and while this one isn’t quite bad, it’s just not as strong as the others that come before it, heralding a drop in quality of the album. It’s just a little too repetitive and maybe a minute too long." so true

**NapsAndNetflix**: "The Fray did it better" also true

**zamomattel**: "she just has soo many songs that sound like one another"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Wow this song could be just named filler. Yeesh."

**peppersmith67**: "the only dud on the whole album"

**mokitsu**: "fillerrrrrrr"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "i won't remember what this sounds like by the time the rate reveal comes around"

**MrSwearword**: "and I’m returning this ABC Family movie of a song. BYE."

#The THIRD and FOURTH Hilary Duff reference by 4 different people, the true winner of this rate

**tevinterimperium**: "this sounds like a hillary duff song" it's kind of an insult in this case tho lmao still influential tho

**letsallpoo**: "LET THE RAIN COME DOWN / AND WAKE MY DREAMS" come clean was way better than this poo why did you compare them

Pink gives it her all but the production really fails her here. It's just so generic and monotonous and can't keep up with Pink. Boilerplate "angery angsty poprock" drum melody.

#Already Happy


**triptoyourheart**: "Powerful song."

**jess_22**: "love the intro, lyrics are WAY darker than i remember"

**therokinrolla**: "this song makes me happy"

**cyborglilith**: "yaaaasssss quen"

**eklxtreme**: "I like the jam in the second half"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "These lyrics! Her Voice! This production?"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "wow I am pleasantly surprised. I feel like I'm really connecting with my inner soccer mom listening to this album."

#Long, Long Way to Happy

**fifthchevron**: "I listened through and didn't hear any of it."

**MrSwearword**: "at least she’s committed to the idea of being so heartbroken and shit, but this is P!nk. She’s known for being a tough bitch and I like that better than this."

**zamomattel**: "P!nk out-angsties angsty queen Avril Lavigne in one song, wow"

**mokitsu**: "filler"

**TeamAwesome4**: "I feel like this would work better as sad than angry because little of it is directed at a person."

**musicotic**: "Piano pop rock?" the best kind!

**calltehshots**: "Forgettable angry girl rock lol. Only held up by Pink's vocals."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Eh, the lyrics are good and P!nk’s performance is good, but for some reason this track just feels like a lot more yelling than usual. I dunno, maybe it’s my aversion to harder rock kicking in but I didn’t quite like this song."

It's hardly original, but I love the dark, tepid beginning before Kelly absolutely explodes in the chorus. It's a formula she recycles many times throughout Breakaway, but this was one of the more successful attempts IMO. Listening to this satisfies my inner angsty teenager so well.

**calltehshots**: "I'm getting middle school Hot Topic flashbacks and I'm living. This sounds like an Evanescence song in the best way."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "One thing that I appreciate about this song is that even though Kelly makes some unflattering comparisons to this guy, she ultimately takes the mantle of the blame onto herself. She is the one who is addicted in this situation. I’m trying really hard not to talk about my personal life here and how this song may or may not be relatable."

**mokitsu**: "omg, this power ballad, very good"

**peppersmith67**: "the intro sounded like if norah jones did trip hop and now i need a norah jones trip hop album in my life."

**agentofscranton**: "those strings work so well with this song, it really gives it that orchestral, dramatic feel that heightens the impact of the message that Kelly’s trying to put through to whoever she’s singing to"

**awryj**: "When I listen to this song, it makes me feel like a 36 year old mother of two who's currently planning to file for divorce and is slightly addicted to sangria" if only you were actually that interesting in real life!

**musicotic**: "Different yet still amazing"

#Sober (Buy Kelly's Sober and Pink's Sober on iTunes)

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "It's like I'm no longer interested in this song. And I know that won't change."

**TeamAwesome4**: "One of the only songs on the album I really don't like. The emotion is all there, but the lyrics are generic as hell and the drug reference is tired."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Simple Plan did it better" who

**cyborglilith**: "OH MY GOD. NO. NONONONONONO."

**eklxtreme**: "it's not that catchy or notable, it's kinda monotonous"

#Asking a Stupid Question

**rickikardashian**: "How are her voice and Pink’s so similar?" because they are both extremely talented vocalists

A really strong vocal performance by Avril. There's a lot of interesting melodic choices that work well with the song and Avril sells it 100%. Her attitude is palpable. Definitely deserved better than some of the songs that placed above it.

**triptoyourheart**: "This song right from the beginning hits you like a tsunami.mp3 I've always preferred Avril's hard rock sound from her first two albums and this song perfectly captures that."

**jess_22**: "A N G S T"

**cyborglilith**: "relatable."

**MissyBee37**: "I love the guitar riffs in this song. Not her best lyrics on the verses, but a worthy song theme."

**wearingsox**: "OMG this was my angst anthem when I felt rejected for dumb things as a child. Now it’s kinda funny to me such it’s so blatantly angsty."

**Jailhousepoop**: "“YOU DON’T KNOW ME, DON’T IGNORE ME!” Me too Avril, me too."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "It’s odd, after finishing this song I immediately relistened to it because I was like “that’s not right” because theoretically I should LOVE this song, it’s right up my alley, but for some reason I just didn’t quite connect with it. Odd, I dunno, it just feels kinda sterile."

#Blow me ... one last kiss 

**tevinterimperium**: "The innuendos in the chorus crack me up"

**poppinmmolly**: "okay so I used to think the lyrics were "I wanna see you go down on me" instead of "on one knee" and I was like woah raunchy Avril. That is not the lyrics. This is a bop."

**rickikardashian**: "“I wanna blow you” ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) “Away” ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)"

**jess_22**: ""I'd say i wanna blow you... away" I see what you did there Avril"

**mokitsu**: ""i wanna blow you" "i wanna see you go down on me" Avril you dickpig!"

#Positivity

**musicotic**: "When am I going to find a song that I won't rate a 10?"

**calltehshots**: "Omg I haven't listened to this song since middle school and this has me SHOOK. I feel like I'm having a realization moment in a teen movie to this bop right now. What a sweet song lol."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of making a song about wanting to marry someone sound like you wanna suck dick at the same time"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Oh wow this is a cute song!"

**eklxtreme**: "mellow, fun stuff"

**peppersmith67**: "I want to skip through a field of flowers right now this album is single handedly resurrecting my poptimism."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "i'm moving my leg at the beat so that's something"

**TeamAwesome4**: "Pure love from Avril. Something seems unnatural about that sentence."

**agentofscranton**: "aww it's a cute lil' song"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "The album really dips in the middle but this songs manages to make it worthwhile. It is fun and funky, and Avril sounds so much more like the Avril that we know today. I mean Melissa?"

#Wrong

**zamomattel**: "Why does this sound like a filler Taylor Swift song" taylor's fillers wish they were this good

#Clever

**therokinrolla**: "welcome back jeopardy folks! It is rokins turn! Whats ur category? “I’d like to choose the category ‘things ill never say’. Okay the answer is ‘things ill never say’. “What is a good song?”"

**MrSwearword**: "example; “this song is interesting and well crafted.” That’s something I’ll never say about this song."

#5th Hilary Duff reference and i love you skiddos

**skiddos**: "This was so boring I decided to stop this album to listen to Breathe In Breathe Out by Hilary Duff"

**zamomattel**: "Pleasant enough but a true filler queen"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "kinda average, but cute. aka what most people think of any random white guy who can sing and play guitar/piano."

**therokinrolla**: "not bad but very obviously filler"

**cyborglilith**: "very forgettable and fillery"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "i won't remember what this sounds like by the time the rate reveal comes around"

**TeamAwesome4**: "It's fine, but it lacks the punch of previous tracks."

**MrSwearword**: "what the hell was with the TV Guide reference? Is she actively trying to make this album sound twice as dated?"

#2Real4Me

**tevinterimperium**: "A few years ago I had packed all my shit into my car and was driving 4 hours away from home to start college in a place where I didn't know anyone. This song came on shuffle and it really got to me, so much so that I had to pull over so I could cry for a few minutes. lmao"

**peppersmith67**: "i'm getting the weirdest deja vu right now"

**MissyBee37**: "The lyrics are super relatable, but the music is not my fave."

#I'm A Mobile Too

**rickikardashian**: "the chorus & bridge >>> the rest of the song"

**wearingsox**: "The way she pronounces/uses mobile always bugged me."

**musicotic**: "Every single song so far has been a huge bop"

**calltehshots**: "This songs sounds like something that would play on The WB. Like Gilmore Girls if it was a little less musically pretentious lol. A good call back to the 90s type girl pop-rock songs that dominated." omg the entirety of shots comments this rate has just been 100% true

#WTF?!

**agentofscranton**: "until I looked up the lyrics to the song I thought she was saying she was immobile and I didn’t understand where mobile came from as a title"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I’m gonna be real, I don’t get it. OH WAIT I’M LITERALLY JUST NOW AS I TYPE THIS REALIZING IT’S LIKE, A MOBILE LIKE YOU HANG ABOVE A BABY’S CRADLE! Well that made me like it less." omfg thats what thats called?

That chorus! I was definitely expecting for her to go full poprock chorus on us but I'm glad she subverted that trope. Her higher register is just amazing. This rate has the best vocalists (maybe not Avril :eyes:) and I'm totally not biased! Also this rate is totally not rigged!

---

#I'm Not Dead but ______ is

**MrSwearword**: "true, but the songwriting clearly was."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "She might not be dead but I am"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Yeah, neither am I P!nk, you don’t gotta say it like it’s an accomplishment."

#I'm Not Dead because this song gave me life, cleared my acne, lost 10 pounds, made me grow hair, and whatever else the gays say

**fifthchevron**: "Can she use her higher register more often?"

**10footnotes**: "I think this title track does a great job of representing the album as a whole." is this a compliment or not? i'm just gonna assume it is because this album outpeaked your favs! 

**calltehshots**: "There's a lot of filler on this album. This is one of those songs."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "it's alright. Definitely doesn't hold up with the previous 4 songs though."

**agentofscranton**: "the way she says floating irks me to my very core but I’m not gonna let that ruin an otherwise fantastic song"

**jess_22**: "pop rock perfection, that guitar solo slays me every time"

**therokinrolla**: "i cant explain why i love this song so much. Its so raw and exceptionally written. A 10"

**cyborglilith**: "oh my god the vocals slayed me"

**rickikardashian**: "the song is great but what is it even about"

**wearingsox**: "Production is more intriguing, the bridge/guitar solo bump this up."

**musicotic**: "BOP"

**eklxtreme**: "nice buildup to the chorus"

#I wish I was dead after listening to this!

**zamomattel**: "The biggest filler so far, but still better than most of the other two's albums" Literally 10 songs from Kelly's album and like 5 songs from Avril's say hi

**skiddos**: "What a boring title track"

**mokitsu**: "filler-y, expected more from the title track!"

**TeamAwesome4**: "Clearly chosen as the name for the album more because the name fit better than the song being a standout."

**awryj**: "My cat scratched me when I was listening to this song, so my general experience was bad and I had to deduct some points" well it's YOUR fault for getting a cat. why did this cat scratch me? its like asking why did this fire burn me? yes, i hate cats

I love the sassy U+Ur Hand Pink, the defiant Behind These Hazel Eyes Kelly, and the rebellious Sk8r Boi Avril, but these three ladies really know how to turn the vulnerability up and create an emotional and vocally perfect ballad. This is no exception. I actually think the chorus of this song betrays the song a bit, but as usual, Pink can make it all work. 

I do just have to make a note how the lyrics irk me though. Just tell a friend! That's what they're there for. And if they aren't the type to listen and help you, then they aren't a friend. Sometimes life gives you shit and sometimes you make your life shit. Keeping things bottled up is the latter.

#Another wellwritten Mini Assay :deadcantaloupe:

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I went into this rate mostly blind, I knew the hits from these albums (they’re embedded in our culture at this point) so I wasn’t quite sure which song would get my 11. The way this rate went was that I listened to I’m Not Dead at the start of the month and then kind of put off doing the rest of it and forgot about this album, and so when I was reviewing these scores to write my comments I was like “wait, I gave this song my 11” and so I relistened to it and I instantly remembered why. I’m someone who’s struggled with being sad… a lot. It started in my childhood and it kind of just never stopped. (Who can relate?) And I’ve always held this sort of strange, irrational anger at the world because of it. I don’t want to inconvenience anyone so I’ll oftentimes keep my mouth shut about my problems and then when I end up stressed out, sad, and alone, I just get so mad at the people around me for no reason, as if they should somehow just know that I’m having issues even though I endeavor to hide those things for them. I tell people not to help me, not to worry about me, then get upset when they don’t. I’ll isolate myself in my room and feel terrible about being alone when I have a backlog of unopened messages from friends who care about me. It’s hard, it’s a struggle that I have to deal with every day, and I think that P!nk really captured that here. It starts off simple and subdued, but then there’s this amazing slowburn into a powerful ballad with these beautiful, almost choral backing vocals, but then by the end she’s faded back into the same tone as the beginning. Because that’s just what it’s like. You get alone, you flip out, you break down, then you just pull yourself back together and you just kind of carry on. And P!nk’s vocals are, as always, untouchable. I found this song to be incredibly powerful, a real gem on this album."

#Who put these onions here? 😢😢😢

**zamomattel**: "Gut-wrenching. There was no need to do this P!nk"

**skiddos**: "Cute song!" this is lowkey condescending skiddos lmfao i love you 

**musicotic**: "Pretty!" also a little condescending lmao

**Jailhousepoop**: "Finally something different than generic pop-rock songs. This is such a cute ballad." omg everytime someone calls this cute i chuckle. yall so mean 

**mokitsu**: "a beautiful ballad!"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "My ass is crying and shaking at the same time it is beautiful"

**peppersmith67**: "i don't hear many ballads like this from p!nk and i'm happy i'm hearing them on the deepcuts of this album definitely changing my perception of her (apparently this was a single. huh.)"

**agentofscranton**: "maybe it’s cause I’m feeling particularly shit today but I fucking bawled when I listened to this"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "Great ballad. I remember everyone in my country's talent shows came to sing this song (spoiler: most of them were trash)." when people try to cover pink ... its always walmart brand

**jess_22**: "P!nk's vocals sound SO good here"

**therokinrolla**: "a solid bop, if a little slow"

**eklxtreme**: "feels like a rock ballad + a Broadway song" actually true

#Nobody Knows because Nobody Cares about you, bye! 👋👋 

**fifthchevron**: "I forgot this was Pink?? Did someone cover this?"

**MrSwearword**: "surprisingly lukewarm songwriting considering P!nk is known for turmoil and especially about fame; this to me reads blasé considering she can take it way further than this."

**tevinterimperium**: "god this sucks"

**TeamAwesome4**: "It's... fine...?"

**awryj**: "The song is a jam, but I still can't make myself enjoy Pink's vocals here. She's a good vocalist but her voice is kinda grating."

**calltehshots**: "I literally just went "JFC how long is this song??" and looked and it was only around 3 minutes. Wrap it up P!nk!!"

**wearingsox**: "I'm so bored again I'm sorry P!nk"

#I laughed (I love puns)

**cyborglilith**: "wut do u call someone with no body and a nose??? nobody knows !!!! hahahahaahahahahaaahahahahhaHAHAHHAahahHHAh"

#A Stupid Question

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Why is a P!nk piano ballad the fourth track of this album?" because she wants to make a ballad and piano is an instrument

#Yes

How many songs with the word 'Gone' in the title is Kelly gonna make? The almost 5th-single of Breakaway is essentially the 'Since U Been Gone but bad' version. The opening verse is pretty interesting with its syncopated rhythm but the chorus is a turn off. Kelly sounds great as usual, but she has done this exact type of song but better many, many times in her career.

---

#Bye!


**mokitsu**: "filler"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "no"

**MrSwearword**: "she did the “I’m already gone” thing better years later."

**zamomattel**: "I feel like this could be slighty more interesting but it may be as exciting as she gets so maybe I'm expecting too much" keep in mind he wrote this comment after listening to breakaway, since u been gone, behind these hazel eyes, and because of you

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Robo-cop had a singing career? Icon. JK, but this song really sounds over produced while at the same time feels really empty as far as production goes. Sometimes more IS more."

**therokinrolla**: "this sounds like a paramore b side" paramore is alright but imagine thinking they rock out harder than kelly 

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Already Gone did it better"

#If the light is on then it isn't offffff

**poppinmmolly**: "A BOP"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "How many other songs reference acid rain? Am I the only one who gets weirdly excited whenever a line in a song references something weird? Anyways, did we ever find the person that this song was written about? Because I’m 90% sure that this record obliterated them. If they weren’t already gone they certainly were after Kelly dropped this."

**Leixander**: "The perfect pop-rock song."

**wearingsox**: "I wish the mixing was better so the drums didn't cut through her voice but this is nevertheless a bop. The bridge is the best part."

**musicotic**: "Fantastic opening line; the production is great"

**calltehshots**: "Standard 2000s pop rock girl bop. Not groundbreaking, but a fun listen."

gannade: We have one more song left for the day, and Day 3 will start tomorrow again at 2:30 PM EST.

If you think #14 is a weird song to stop at, it's because there were 39 total songs in the rate so there's 13 each day!!! NOT ARBITRARY AT ALL.

Also, there are some iconic songs that got out at #11-13 so Day 3 can truly, truly be a bloodbath of the remaining singles.

I'm pretty fucking shook this song made it this far. I enjoy it but it was definitely weird to just tag it on at the end of *Breakaway*, so I didn't expect it to do that well. I'm pleasantly surprised. And, although this really goes without saying, Kelly's voice in this is just flat out beautiful. 

---

#Give this to us before her country album please

**fifthchevron**: "All Kelly's albums should be live tbh"

#Beautiful

**MrSwearword**: "live singing, YAS GAWD. Inclusion on the album? Pointless, teebs"

**poppinmmolly**: "This has been my go to shower song for 10+"

**mokitsu**: "beautiful ballad!"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "decent outro"

**cyborglilith**: "me except the beautiful part"

**peppersmith67**: "awesome closer but it's a strange stylistic choice to have a live version of a ballad. Hearing girls scream in between kelly's tender lyrics is kinda off-putting."

**ImADudeDuh**: "She won american idol for a reason!"

**MissyBee37**: "It's a tough competition whether this song or "Because of You" is more devastating; the fact that it's live kicks it up a notch. Her vocal is still so great and she nails the emotion."

**wearingsox**: "One of the few live recordings tacked onto an album that is a GIFT. Her vocals and the rendition are flawless and heartfelt."

**calltehshots**: "Omg throwback to when I used to listen to this in middle school and cry in my room lmfao. I think this song benefits from being a live version because Kelly is a VOCALIST."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Wow, Kelly has such a beautiful voice :) But this is boring, I’d be into it if I were there but I’m not there I’m listening at home on my headphones. Get in the studio or gift."

**10footnotes**: "Usually I don’t like cop-out songs like this being added to albums, but Kelly’s voice is strong and the song is pretty, so I’m not mad about it."

**eklxtreme**: "interesting that she used the live version for the album, but I'm glad they did because it's stripped down and shows more emotion in her vocals, and who doesn't love a powerhouse piano ballad?"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "She has some nice vocals. Slay Kelly." SOME nice vocals??? smh doc probably thinks zendaya is a better vocalist or something

#Is Artpop Kelly's Witness?

**letsallpoo**: "so nice of kelly to dedicate a performance to the witness era" 

**therokinrolla**: "i cant believe kelly wrote a song about artpop"

#Disaster

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Kelly is a talented vocalist but this album is a mess." ok girl what exactly have you done in your life. kelly won american idol at 20 and here you are being tone deaf

**TeamAwesome4**: "Kelley's anthem to every unhealthy relationship while still convinced it can work out. It's as good as it is tragic."

**agentofscranton**: "she sounds fucking great but the song’s just kind of…blah, y’know?"

**awryj**: "Those vocal runs were unnecessary" you're unnecessary tbh

**jess_22**: "filler, a weak way to end the album"

**rickikardashian**: "I liked the original better ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

#Not In My Rate

**zamomattel**: "Kelly Clarkson... you have a beautiful voice, and that performance was no disaster... P!nk Condragulations you are the winner of this week's challenge" goodbye

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I would like to apologize to /u/gannade for being a mess earlier. Let me explain what happened.

I had a bit of an argument with my mom earlier and I was stress-eating to cope with it. And I feel even more shittier cause I ate too much and that really made me feel insecure about myself.

I saw Panda's joke after I left a nice comment on Kelly's song and I was really pissed over it which I shouldn't cause Panda's shady jokes aren't meant to be taken seriously anyway.

Sorry for being a mess earlier. Stress eating is not worth it y'all.

=====

letsallpoo: controversy is a measure of how divisive the scores were. mathematically speaking it's just the standard deviation. an "average" controversy score would be around 2, while a controversy score of 3 would be a lot and indicates that people tended to just give very high and very low scores
