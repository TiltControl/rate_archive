[RATE REVEAL] 2000s Female Pop Rock Rate: Day One
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/70bd3v/rate_reveal_2000s_female_pop_rock_rate_day_one/

Hey guys, it's naps here. I was asked by /u/gannade to reveal today's results for the pop-rock rate. He's an adult with a degree and a job and I dropped out of school to become an alcoholic, so he obviously knew I had time to do it. Plus, I can only assume he saw the Canada rate reveal and thought that is what he wanted his rate to be like. He did quite literally all the work, and just sent them to me so I'm stealing all his karma for the day, so go to his page and upvote him a bit or something.

---
Anyways, without further ado here are the songs in the rate:

The cappuccino line is iconic. The song does sound like it was recorded in someone's basement and Pink's grasp or rhythm here is questionable. And no the shitpost won't be Katy Perry! It'll be by a Grammy Winner instead.

---

#Cappuccino Girl

**fifthchevron**: "She sounds like Gaga here. "What kind of man makes cappuccino", oh god she's literally THAT person who hates things just because they're trendy and you don't even hear about the trend until she complains about how everyone's doing it lmao. The song style is interesting though."

**MrSwearword**: "“what type of man makes a cappuccino?” the kind who can skip this shit despite never having actually made a cappuccino, you hussy."

**zamomattel**: "cappuccino drinking men erasure aside, this is a sweet tune"

**peppersmith67**: "THE BEST KINDA MEN MAKE CAPPUCCINO I THOUGHT YOU WERE WOKE P!NK #genderroles?"

**jess_22**: ""What kind of man makes cappuccino?" P!nk's asking the serious questions"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "what kind of man makes cappuccino"

**eklxtreme**: ""what kind of man makes cappuccinos" lol waht. a little too repetitive."

#Buy Witness on iTunes to support the poor!!

**poppinmmolly**: "I dig this, but Katy did it better."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "if there are more than 8 katy perry comments please kill me" RIP bye girl!

**TeamAwesome4**: "I much prefer this to Katy Perry's, but still lots of room for improvement."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Katy Perry did it better"

**mokitsu**: "Buy Witness on iTunes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

**cyborglilith**: "I hate katy's but at least it's not boring like this"

**Leixander**: "I am shocked to say this but Katy did it better."

**musicotic**: "Katy could never"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "my comment for this was originally going to be "Katy did it better" since I love that song but I'm not so sure anymore :O"

**calltehshots**: "How many people are gonna make Katy references? Anyway, she is not shaking. A snoozer."

**ImADudeDuh**: "I would say Katy did it better, but I feel like there will never be a song named "The One That Got Away" better than Katy's, so the Katy did it better would be implied"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Katy outsold but this song is pretty good. Definitely one of the slower P!nk songs that actually didn't bore me to death!"

**rickikardashian**: "This sounds like a stand up story. also, SUMMER AFTER HIGHSCHOOL, WHEN WE FIRST MET"

#Country? In My Popheads?

**skiddos**: "A country song? In my pop rock rate?" Kelly's country album is coming so stay woke!

**therokinrolla**: "an okay thing"

**tevinterimperium**: "pink.... country is not your genre girl"

**wearingsox**: "Nice and soulful."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Somewhat noteworthy for being a random country song on a pop album way before that became a trend."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I hope you all appreciate the amount of effort I put in during this rate to just not make all of these comments me complaining about the boys I’ve been with because it has been a struggle with these albums in particular. I’m gonna predict that… either three people are gonna reference the Katy Perry song, or none. Also I like country P!nk, she was way ahead of the times." Oooo girl you were way off

#The Truest Comment

**10footnotes**: "This is the one track on the album that does absolutely nothing for me. I wish this song would go away."

I thought this was a poprock rate...? The lyrics basically rehash the entirety of *Let Go*, and the musical choices... well I appreciate the risk taking.

#2Urban4Me

**10footnotes**: "My least favorite song on Let Go. The rap-ish verses just don’t do it for me."

**MrSwearword**: "who told the white girl from Canada to partially rap-sing this and why did she listen to them?"

**zamomattel**: "Invented rap, Kendrick Lamar is out of business"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Nobody's Home >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>. Also Avril rapping<<<<<<Madonna rapping"

**skiddos**: "Is this a rap? Goodbye, Avril"

**rickikardashian**: "Nicki Minaj is found dead after listening to the rap qween" 

**wearingsox**: "The rapping does not work but the chorus is nice enough."

**calltehshots**: "A rapper - Taylor is shaking."

**Jailhousepoop**: "Is this… rap? My multi-talented queen can do everything."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Wow this track sounds ahead of its time, that pseudo-rapping thing is big right now. I have this weird relationship to songs that are like “I’m never gonna change for anyone” because I generally think of changing based off of the input of other people to be a good thing, but I understand what she was going for and just because I don’t agree with something it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s bad. (Take note of that people. Take note.)"

**eklxtreme**: "queen of mixing the weirdest genres. is it Rap? is it mom-pop?"

#Foolish Avril

**peppersmith67**: "Avril u trippin"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "F I _ L _ R"

**cyborglilith**: "filler"

**TeamAwesome4**: "Luckily this song is 80% chorus because the verses drag."

**therokinrolla**: "im a fool for listening to this album"

**musicotic**: "Amazing opening. Tbh verses are much better than the chorus"

#Honestly the entirety of popheads

**fifthchevron**: ""I might've fallen for that when I was fourteen" said the seventeen year old lmao"

#Just a Fool (Buy Xtina's Lotus on iTunes)

**MissyBee37**: "Love these lyrics! Especially the chorus. And this: "But it's amazing what a couple of years can mean.""

It started off as such a bop with that edgy beat but ended up staying in the same lane the entire time.

#Cuz I Can!

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Listening to this song just kind of makes me smile. It’s weird! She screams about ice cream and barks like a dog. I love it when pop stars get weird."

**TeamAwesome4**: "Would be much better without the "I'm a rich bitch" talk. P!nk was always one of the more grounded pop stars, and bragging about the size of her pool subtracts from that A LOT."

**musicotic**: "Insanely catchy"

The lyrics are certainly interesting... like really interesting. On one hand, it seems like Pink doing a typical "fuck the haters" anthem now that she made it into pop stardom. On the other hand, the song seems to be doing a parody of that exact type of anthem. It really blurs the line between the real and the fake, and I think it's quite clever. And it's a tune!

#I'm a Rich Girl nannananana

**MrSwearword**: "the delivery is what sells the fact that money can’t actually buy happiness but can buy the things needed to say “well fuck you, I’m rich now.”"

**mokitsu**: "love the production of this song and the lyrics are cool as well"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "tbh I was listening to this while also watching something called Xtreme Waterparks? I zoned out during this song because there was a cool water slide someone had to get stitches from and I got distracted and am not going to listen again but like I think I remember liking this song so 9 seems safe"

**TeamAwesome4**: "This is the perfect kind of vulnerability to come from P!nk. Lots of money isn't a bragging point in this song which is a very good thing."

**rickikardashian**: "I expected another #BadBitchAnthem but i got a #DeppresedBadBitchAnthem, so i kind of relate more" me too, me too.

**calltehshots**: "I was expecting this to be a silly song with this ridiculous title name and I was immediately bummed when it started. It grew on me though - it has a much better vibe then half the "I'm in middle school and mad!! Even though I'm very much an adult!!" songs on this album."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I actually quite like this song, it’s a good take on the whole “money can’t buy happiness” theme, but of all the songs on the album this is the most clearly filler. It’s just a little bit low key compared to the others."

**triptoyourheart**: "Nice lil throwback to her R&B sound from her first album."

You all did this song SO DIRTY. I mean the lyrics are kinda messy but the song is a BOP. Pink had a point, but as many pointed out, attacked it in the wrong manner. Still though, a BOP. Whatever happened to the girl president? She got voted out by popheads!!

---

#The Mini Assay :deadbanana: (really good points though)

**fifthchevron**: "OK y'all about to hear it, get ready...I hated this song then, I hate it now. You fucked up, Pink. If you look through her discography, she has a problem with internalised misogyny. Most Girls, anyone? Even Don't Let Me Get me, though that's a little more nuanced. I still get mad at the female president line in this song...it's just so off the mark. Even if there were no music video vixens that doesn't mean women would suddenly be properly represented in Western politics!! The video only slightly saves this trash by showing the little girls being socialised and the plastic surgery scenes. But it basically undoes it all by showing her getting insecure around women who are LITERALLY DOING NOTHING WRONG. She gets mad at a girl getting, what, TOO excited while bowling (policing other women's actions, wow such feminist), how excited is too much for you, Pink?? Then the other woman for...running on a treadmill?? Wow Pink, your life must be so miserable! You're an attractive, fit, white, filthy rich globally successful superstar - but that BITCH dared to have bigger boobs than you! She must be a STUPID GIRL. How nasty can you get? And as if the scenes of her washing the car aren't designed to be just as titillating as the videos she's criticising (by the way, what was Lady Marmalade? Or U Make Me Sick?). I hated Pink for a long time after this. I get the overallpoint about women feeling pressured to downplay/sexualise themselves to get male validation, but she missed the mark by targeting young women becoming part of a system they're born/socialised into, rather than the men who created it/continue perpetuating it. As much as I hate the music video, Lily Allen got to the point much better in Hard Out Here. Or TLC in Unpretty." 

#Buy Hailee's Most Girls on iTunes (not Pink's)

**tevinterimperium**: "pink has always had an issue with internalized misogyny huh?"

**skiddos**: "Invented internalized misogyny"

**therokinrolla**: "this song is sexist slut shaming and barely bops. booo" this person also hated hilary duff in the disney rate so yeah

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "This song should (and will) be out first day and I am fully okay with that."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "OH, I see, so Meghan is “problematic” but P!nk is an icon? Okay. Okay. I see you. I like this song, I do, but I can’t in good conscience give it that great of a score because honestly it’s pretty bad. I understand where P!nk was coming from with this song but the whole “I’m so tired of all these fake bimbos” thing isn’t really progressive like she thinks. Plus there’s something kind of off about the really fast portions of this song that just feel underpowered and the lyrics are kinda hit or miss. They lip synced to it on RuPaul’s Drag Race and there was an iconic double split, do the RPDR Queens Rate."

**Jailhousepoop**: "What a woke queen. Every girl should wear a short haircut with masculine features. Girls can't be girly or feminine if they want to be taken serious. Right.."

**wearingsox**: "#PornoPaparazziGirl"

**peppersmith67**: "whomever the 'hypeman' on the track was, they were more annoying than anything diddy has done in the background of a song."

#Problematic Fave

**poppinmmolly**: "problematic fave. This message is....something but the song is a bop."

**zamomattel**: "Yeah this song shows P!nk as a bit of a problematic fave but it is a bop soooo I'll let it partially slide"

**agentofscranton**: "this is probably one of the most problematic songs we’ve ever rated, but god damn if this song isn’t fucking great – the drag race lip-sync is also easily top 5 lip-syncs"

**triptoyourheart**: "Pink, it's perfectly fine for women to want to be girly and being proud of their sexuality. The song is undeniably catchy though."

**10footnotes**: "“Flipping my blonde hair back” As a blonde person, I’m actually offended by what this insinuates."


**rickikardashian**: "I have some issues with the message of the song, because it’s too “im butter than u cuz i dunt weer makeup” and it kind of implies that girls can’t have think of their physique without being stupid, and it’s a mentality that needs to be abolished from society. Do I still bop to it tho? Yes"

**cyborglilith**: "this might sound bad but it's a bop so I can disregard the lyrics"

**TeamAwesome4**: "I admire the ambition and rue the execution."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "aw I remember this. It's not very good but it is very catchy."

**ImADudeDuh**: "problematic, yes. bop? yes."

**calltehshots**: "Okay, a super eyerolly "I'm better than you bc I'm an outcast and don't wear makeup!!" judgemental song but also a grade A bop lmfao. A Misery Business tea."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "y'all will drag this for being problematic even harder than misery business but I still bop to it sorry lmao"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Man, this song did not age well in terms of sending a message. It probably resonated during the later half of 2000s but definitely not right now when feminism encourages many types of women, not just one that is "smart" and the other ones are considered "dumb". This is catchy tho so I am giving this a nice score but I hope P!nk disowns this song but she gives me r/lewronggenration teas if she doesn't tbh."

#Nah, just a bop

**MrSwearword**: "LEGENDARY. A nice satire on pop culture at the time. inb4 the klaxon of “slutshaming”. Get a sense of humor or understand “slutshaming” isn’t a thing. Also, RuPaul’s Drag Race LIPSYNC GOLD, HENNY."

MrSwearword: Semantics over "promiscuous" vs. "slut" or "whore" have *bum shit* to do with P!nk's MadTV like lampooning of pop culture moments from 2004-2006. And yes, on top of the sex tape, she also impersonated Jessica Simpson in the "Boots are Made For Walkin'" video; huge pop culture moments that the self-described asshole of the industry per her Behind the Music took the piss out of because that's her sense of humor.

THAT is the point I'm making, which you completely missed. The only thing I'm taking away from this is that Paris' sex tape was leaked; legit did not know that.

The video is NOT just addressing a few pop culture moments, she is addressing society and blaming (other) women entirely. She's got it all worked out because "I'm so glad I'll never fit in". Said the multi-million dollar recording artist.

Now you did all did this song even dirtier! I love the piano instrumental in the background, kinda reminds me of Rihanna's Unfaithful. And the lyrics are pretty nice too. #Relatable, cmon, we all need an anthem for this because literally no one likes their 12-15 year old selves.

---

#It Gets Better

**zamomattel**: "love P!nk's personality and we really see it here"

**mokitsu**: "a very unexpected track, a bit overproduced and dramatic but epic nonetheless"

**wearingsox**: "This works way better than it should."

**jess_22**: "underrated af. lyrics perfectly sum up my teenage years"

**therokinrolla**: "i love how she ends the standard edition by addressing her edgy childhood. Its kinda hilarious but i love it and its really sweet and pink really opens up"

**cyborglilith**: "this is almost 2 melodramatic 4 me, but I love drama"

#That Title
(Which is more iconic: Fucked My Way Up To The Top or Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self)?

**ImADudeDuh**: "This is such a sweet song. The only reason it's not a 10 is because of how awkward the title is said in the song"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Cringe title but good song so i aint mad"

**ExtraEater**: "A+ title"

**eklxtreme**: "lol I hate that she states the title of the song, but some lines are sweet. Though it could've been done a lot better."

**MissyBee37**: "I want to like what she's going for here but I just don't care for the lyrics. It especially bothers me that it obviously states "conversations with my thirteen-year-old self." It's just so on the nose. It'd be so much better if it embraced subtlety in the lyric and just explained it in the title, IMHO."

**calltehshots**: "I'm already rolling my eyes at the title. I get the sentiment but jesus, let's cut the drama but 50% here lol. The orchestra sounds like we're about to go to war in a movie. It's not a bad song but let's relax P!nk."

#That Instrumental

**peppersmith67**: "The only song of the rate that is entirely ruined by the production. The song speaks for itself it doesn't need these dumbass Beauty and the Beast orchaestal stabs to be emotional"

**TeamAwesome4**: "After an awkward intro, this gets quite haunting, but a lot of the advice is generic stuff, which is ok, just not optimal."

**agentofscranton**: "it’s probably just me but the instrumental really creeps me out"

**triptoyourheart**: "Beautiful and haunting way to close the album (I'm assuming Fingers is a bonus track). The production is probably my favourite off the entire album."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "huh. interesting. once again I'm not sure about the topic/premise of this song but there's some weird shit happening in the instrumental and I fuck with it."

**musicotic**: "The production is literally movie-quality omg. It makes the song"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "It’s a miracle that P!nk was able to make that weird intro work. Is she, like, literally time traveling or summoning the ghost of her 13 year old self? I can see why people would think that this is overwrought, but as a theatre guy I appreciate how cinematic this song is. It really does paint a picture of P!nk imparting something incredibly important to her childhood self. 13 was a super rough year for me, and I always struggle to think of what I would say to him if I had to talk to him. Maybe I’d just play him this, P!nk certainly does a good job of elucidating what it’s like to grow up rough than I do. An unconventional song but a very bold one. Actually I’d like to take a moment here to say that I really wish I’d had these albums when I was growing up, they really could have helped me."

#Grow Up Already!

**fifthchevron**: "Didn't Mizundastood cover this?"

**MrSwearword**: "if I want uncomfortable messages to younger selves, I’d watch a final episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race from Seasons 7-8."

**rickikardashian**: "Pink made sure to make this song as emo as possible so her teen fans would listen to her message"

**TragicKingdom1**: "I like the concept but it's not fleshed out enough for what it's trying to accomplish."

**Jailhousepoop**: "Wdym conversations with my 13 year old self? I don’t know her. 13 year old me?? Never happened? I skipped that year. Can’t remember, can’t relate."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This had potential to be grand and epic but I think it sort of felt a bit lukewarm in execution. Nonetheless, this is an interesting song to close the standard edition of the album sans the hidden bonus track 'I Have Seen The Rain', which I think should have been included in the rate."

#I laughed 

**tevinterimperium**: "she sounds like she was an annoying child"

It's really light on the ears and a truly a soothing song. I'm kind of surprised it's one of the lower ranking songs from Avril, but on a poprock rate, I guess it makes sense.

#Tomorrow... I'll be awake because this song put me to sleep

**MrSwearword**: "the sun better come out tomorrow after this boring dreck."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Cringey-ass first verse aside, this song just goes nowhere."

**skiddos**: "I got bored during the first 10 seconds, and I didn't get any more interested throughout the song"

**awryj**: "boring"

**mokitsu**: "filler-ish, come on avril"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "i love ballads but fuck me this one is boring"

**jess_22**: "lazy songwriting. there goes 4 minutes of my life that i won't get back"

**zamomattel**: "Annie did it better" they truly did

**calltehshots**: "Kinda cheesy for even this genre."

#Sweet like sleep medication

**fifthchevron**: "Such a strange format, there's no chorus or structure. Her vocals are very pretty."

**peppersmith67**: "Avril Lavigne delivered the "no I don't" line with more conviction than any politician has delivered any speech ever. This album has aged better than most music I listened to last year what on earth is happening to me?

**TeamAwesome4**: "Sounds sweet."

**wearingsox**: "I used to think this chorus was boring but I love it now."

**musicotic**: "A chill bop"

**eklxtreme**: "pretty sweet song, nice melody"

**Jailhousepoop**: "I fired my mental therapist after I listened to this song. Only Avril understands me. Tomorrow is a different day and everything will change."

#This is the second time Hilary has been mentioned, influential queen

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Okay I hate to keep making Hilary Duff comparisons but she literally says “not today” in this song, has my whole life been a lie?"

Hahaha love this comment. This song was an example of something that did not age well compared to what I thought of it at the time. I remember loving that song! So when I heard it for this, I was confused, thinking, "What? Was this song always this boring? Why did I love this???" I have a lot of nostalgia for it but dude, it's kind of about nothing...

#Run Away With Me

**musicotic**: "With me?"

**peppersmith67**: "Another solid pink ballad I wouldn't have heard on my local radio"

**therokinrolla**: "my 3rd contender for my 11 bc this was my favorite song as a kid. It was mostly that excellent chorus, and it was edgy. And i loved edge. But honestly that chorus is explosive in so many way and my emotions cant handle it"

**eklxtreme**: "it's a sweet, well written song and it resonates with me"


#Run Away to a Better Song

**MrSwearword**: "it literally does nothing but exist. Poor it."

**zamomattel**: "Not really my thing, it's decent enough but after 3 bops, it cannot stand up"

**jess_22**: "the chorus falls flat"

**Leixander**: "Laziest chorus ever?"

**calltehshots**: "This is pretty bad. Putting this boring shit after a bop like U + Ur Hand was a bold move. And a wrong one. This sounds like a Lillix B-side."

**Jailhousepoop**: "This sounds like an Avril Lavigne song. Don’t try to come for my girl Avril you P!nk!" is this a good thing or bad thing? ehh i can't decide

#Evanescence (Where are they now?)

**MrSwearword**: "a criticism I cannot be read for is that when out of the SUPERBOP world, this album presents Kelly Clarkson as a sedate Amy Lee/Evanescence wannabe."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "This is literally an Evanescence song."

**peppersmith67**: "what if prime Kelly Clarkson started a metal band and had beef with Evanescence?"

**Leixander**: "This sounds so much like Evanescence."

#Tone Deaf

**mokitsu**: "boring!"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "a good song hidden behind all this filler"

**cyborglilith**: "FILLER"

**rickikardashian**: "The song isn’t bad, it just sounds very dated"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "One of the issues that I have with doing this rate is I’m not at all familiar with this music scene so I’m not sure if this track is generic or so influential that the market has become saturated with songs like it, but either way I’m not fond of it. More than any of the songs on this album it’s just kind of a wall of sound, the sound mixing or the production or something just feels off."

Ah yes. The ballad on Breakaway not named Because of You. The first 10 times I listened through Breakaway, I always skipped this because wtf it totally killed the mood and it was so boring. However, I really appreciate Kelly's vocal in this now. She truly has some chops.

---

#She won American Idol for a reason

**calltehshots**: "Kelly really knows how to make a power ballad. This sounds straight out of the power ballad era 80s. If anyone else was behind this, it could possibly be trite and boring - but Kelly vocally takes you there (as she does with everything. A true legend)."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "“I want your heart to bleed is all I’m asking for” holy SHIT that’s a good line. It conveys very well the weird sort of duality of this song. On the surface there’s nothing wrong with this relationship, he’s faithful and good to her, but for some reason, it’s just not enough. She can tell he’s trying, but at the same time he’s not trying enough. He’ll hold her hand, but she has to take it first. It’s little things like that that paint exactly what she’s feeling here, she wants this to not just be an ordinary love but rather something special. Is that a reasonable request to be making? Well, that’s up in the air, and she seems to know that, but she feels the need to say something all the same. A song about a weird place that not a lot of people touch on, but yeah, I’ve been there. Boy have I been there."

**peppersmith67**: "Kelly can switch from tender ballad to kick ass anthem in a moment like no other."

**eklxtreme**: "it's soft when it needs to be and it has a nice dynamic overall"

**mokitsu**: "whitney houston who"

**awryj**: "The chorus has a very nice chord progression"

**MissyBee37**: "So beautiful. I love the pleading in her voice and the lyrics."

**wearingsox**: "Kelly's vocals are beautiful and nuanced."

**rickikardashian**: "Jagged Little Pill realness" 

#Where is the Pop Rock?

**MrSwearword**: "somewhere wishing this sappy ballad didn’t exist. Not for lack of trying, though."

**zamomattel**: "Legitimately forgot this was on, call me heartless if you want Kelly"

**agentofscranton**: "it’s a cute lil’ song but I somehow always forget how it goes when it finishes"

**musicotic**: "The 2nd is really annoying in the piano part tbh, but the song is still great"

#Where is the Good Music?

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Literally a song that would play when the girl in a rom com makes her first walk in the city after she just broke up with her soulmate. They make up somewhere after the bridge tho. It's also on a a bridge."

**skiddos**: "I want to like this more than I do"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: ""Like a petal falling to the ground" had me shook because I heard "like a pedophile" and thought she lost her damn mind. Song is ok." Kelly would never!

**TeamAwesome4**: "This... This is fine."

**jess_22**: "god this just would not end, the lyrics are so cliché"

**therokinrolla**: "this sounds like the soundtrack to one of those sarah mclauchlin animal commercials" lmfao too true too true

ROBBED. God, they really don't make song like these anymore in the pop world. I can't remember the last time an artist made a power ballad blaming themselves in the relationship. And Kelly sells it like no other. "What do you do when you're looking in the mirror and staring at you is the reason he's not here?" A lot of modern artists can learn some humility these days! Admittedly, this song does drag on too long and it's darker poprock sound is clearly overshadowed by the likes of Behind These Hazel Eyes.

JunkyGS: Just a quick comment about Stupid Girls and it being problematic.

People who didn't grow up during this time didn't realize how bad pop culture was at the time and media. Thankfully things have changed but I would argue this mindset was the seed that grew into more fully developed mainstream feminist beliefs. If P!nk released this song now I would say yes it is regressive, but people don't realize HOW FAR we have come socially in 10 years on these sorts of issues. Feminism wasn't even a conversation on the mainstream table, let alone an accepted fully developed belief system. It was progressive for it's time and we should be thankful we are in a place right now where we can look back on this and think "we have come a far way"

Just my 2 cents ❤️

A media fixation on particular women is not a reason for Pink to diss ALL women and provide only ONE archetype for the "right" way to be. A song telling you how to be better is also something you never see male artists do for men. I find the whole concept incredibly condescending, as if women barely know how to make their own decisions and we all need a good talkin' to from a pop star to set us straight.

MissyBee37: This is a really fair point. I am in the demographic for which this was a bigger deal (I was in high school when this song came out), so I remember P!nk being super edgy and considered someone breaking the boundaries of what was expected of female artists. 

I remember when she sang this chorus a few years earlier in "Don't Let Me Get Me" (2001):

>LA told me, "You'll be a pop star, 
All you have to change is everything you are." 
Tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears 
She's so pretty, that just ain't me 

And that was a BIG deal. So she really does deserve credit for being bold enough to say, "Hey, I'm not the it thing, but I'm still a woman and I'm still me." 

That said, unfortunately, I still don't care for "Stupid Girls" :/ But I respect P!nk and her impact.

MissyBee37: That's the unfortunate side of it, absolutely. It's a shame so many feminist-inspired efforts or intentions have to come at the expense of other women. It's worth applauding that P!nk wanted to stand up against the idea that women can only be pretty or noteworthy if they're traditionally feminine/girly, skinny, popular, have classic sex appeal, etc. But it's a shame the lyrics sometimes make her point by bringing down the stereotypical or idealized woman - or just other women and styles of women, period. Britney deserves just as much respect.

deleted: > P!nk being super edgy and considered someone breaking the boundaries of what was expected of female artists.

See I've always disliked this because it's like the commercial pop version of edgy? Pink is standard, generic pop with a mohawk. Like...she doesn't actually do anything drastically different, she just has a raspy voice. Everything else, she fits the pop star bill. So the whole "PINK IS NOT LIKE THOSE OTHER GIRLS" thing was always ridiculous to me because she would play the role while dissing it and (STILL) acts like she's some indie artist. 

> And that was a BIG deal.

Not that I recall. She was always a fan of Britney and they did the Pepsi commercial together. It's ridiculous how many of the female pop stars back then who acted like they hated Britney were actually huge fans of hers. Showbiz is a dark place. 
[/r/popheads/comments/70bd3v/rate_reveal_2000s_female_pop_rock_rate_day_one/dn30aic/]

=====

MissyBee37: Yeah, edge in music is something I don't feel like I have a full understanding of. Around that same time, I was super into Christina Aguilera and Avril Lavigne, but my friends hated both because *in their view* Christina was a slutty cliche popstar and Avril was a fake pretending to be edgy but actually just also a cliche popstar; meanwhile, they praised Good Charlotte as the most legitimate music on the planet and super edgy. At the time, I believed them... but listened to what I liked anyway because, well, I liked it; I just felt embarrassed and uncool about it. I revisited Good Charlotte recently and had to laugh because it sounds exactly as cliche and pop-y as they claimed it was totally rebelling against. So, is P!nk legitimately some kind of edgy? Now or then? I... don't know. But I think people think she is? 

I may have been reading the entirely wrong teen magazines haha because I remember the whole Britney vs. Christina vs. P!nk concept being hyped up, but I was also about a pre-teen when these women were rising to stardom. So maybe it wasn't as big of a deal as I remember, or as I bought into at least. I totally forgot about the Pepsi commercial!

mynameisnotbecky1: What people mean is she wasn't a sex symbol, and she embraced it. Many of the female empowering symbols still lured in the eyes of men, but P!nk rocketed to the top of the charts by defying norms, being agressive, and showing us she doesnt give a fuck. She doesnt grind her hips or writhe in her music vids, but she has a damn good voice and is quite eccentric in behaviour if you ask me. Music, debatable. Persona, no denying.

Still fucking agree that her dictatorship approach to women's rights is conservative, hypocritical, and problematic AF.

deleted: Yep, I remember being 16 and never DREAMING of mentioning feminism in any capacity during that time (early 00s). The second it was even mentioned, you'd get dudes asking if you were a lesbian man hater and nobody had any time for it. NO female celebrities were vocal about it the way they are now. Now, 16 year olds can wear t-shirts literally stating feminist quotes and hear it in nearly every pop song. I'm only 27 but it's *astounding* how quickly we shifted into the total opposite social atmosphere to what Pink illustrated in Stupid Girls.

mynameisnotbecky1: Madonna stood for femnimism, I'd make a strong exception for her.

deleted: Yeah I was speaking about the early 00s though. I'd say she wasn't exactly pushing a notable feminist image at that point, because she'd done it already.
