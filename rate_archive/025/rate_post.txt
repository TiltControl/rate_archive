[RATE] 2000s Female Pop Rock Rate: Breakaway vs. Let Go vs. I'm Not Dead
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6r1xin/rate_2000s_female_pop_rock_rate_breakaway_vs_let/

These three artists used to rule the pop world, but now are commonly referred to as "mom music" in our beloved subreddit. It makes sense, though. Your mom was always cooler than you.

#Kelly Clarkson - *Breakaway*

When Kelly Clarkson was crowned the inaugural winner of the phenomenon that became American Idol, she was known not only for those powerhouse pipes, but for her charming down-to-earth personality. It was a bit surprising when her uninspired R&B debut, *Thankful*, robbed her of her voice - both metaphorically and literally. Her status waned and questions arose as to her relevancy. Just when critics were about to write her off as a failed TV reality star, Kelly dropped *Breakaway*. Arguably one of the most influential albums of the 2000s decade, Breakaway ushered in an era of pop rock while jump-starting the career of the famous Max Martin and the infamous Dr. Luke. Its five singles are some of Kelly’s most notable signature songs: “Since U Been Gone,” “Behind These Hazel Eyes,” “Because of You,” “Breakaway,” and “Walk Away.” But more importantly, the album signified Kelly’s literal breakaway from generic reality TV stardom to her realization as a truly iconic pop star.

Also, we’ll still be rating “Beautiful Disaster (Live)” since that is on the standard edition of Breakaway even though it’s technically a song from Thankful. Why not give Kelly another real song @her record label?

#Avril Lavigne - *Let Go*

Before Alessia released her anthem for introverts (“Here”), before Lorde reached #1 with her protest to materialism (“Royals”), before all those countless emo/punk bands (#tbt to ffourth’s rate) ruled Tumblr, the millennial generation had all the angst it needed in Avril’s debut song, “Complicated.” Its parent album, *Let Go*, brought pop punk into the mainstream and cemented Avril as an idol for all those teenagers aching for rebellion. Sometimes we look at our preteen/teen years with embarassment, but *Let Go* was a shameless celebration for that awkwardly great period of our lives. In addition to "Complicated," Avril's debut also spawned some of Avril’s signature songs: “Sk8er Boi,” “I’m With You,” and “Losing Grip.” Avril’s sound and aesthetic hasn’t changed much over the years - the lead single of her last album was literally titled “Here’s to Never Growing Up” - but with a debut as successful as *Let Go*, maybe it’s best to stay true to your roots.

#Pink - *I'm Not Dead*

Pink’s *I’m Not Dead* is a bit of a black sheep in the rate. While Kelly’s *Breakaway* and Avril’s *Let Go* are almost universally agreed upon to be their respective artists’ signature albums, *I’m Not Dead* isn’t necessarily Pink’s. And while those albums established Kelly and Avril as pop queens, Pink had already proven herself with 2001’s *Missundaztood* (which, like Kelly’s *Breakaway*, represented Pink’s evolution from R&B to her truer pop rock inclinations). Also like Kelly’s *Breakaway*, *I’m Not Dead* came as a career revival after 2003’s *Try This* was unfairly maligned. Brash and unapologetic, Pink came back with a vengeance. She directly challenged the Bush administration in “Dear Mr. President” while sassily telling off potential suitors to go masturbate in  “U + Ur Hand,” all on the same album. Other notable singles include the slightly problematic feminist single “Stupid Girls” and the heartbreaking pop rock ballad “Who Knew.” Overall, *I’m Not Dead* sure had a lot on its mind, but it all felt undeniably, authentically Pink.

Rules!:

I'm using Poo's program so I pulled a Taylor and copied these directly from his rate!!

* Listen to EVERY song (yes, even the stupid filler tracks) and assign it a score from 1 to 10, inclusive. You may use decimals, **BUT** only if it ends with a 0.5. Please don't give 8.7s or 4.65s, but feel free to give 3.5s and 9.5s. You can change your scores at any time - just PM me again.
* You are allowed to give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is one song for the entire rate, NOT one per album. These are optional and are meant to signify your favorite and least favorite song.
* Use the preprepared link to send in your scores. I'll be using the program that POO made and while I'll still accept your scores if it's not properly formatted, I'll be mildly annoyed for two and a half minutes if you choose not to.
* You may (and are encouraged to!) include comments with your scores. To include a comment, just write it directly after your score, like this:

> Complicated: 0 Let's go to the mall and not buy anything #90skids!

* You may (and are also encouraged to!) include comments for particular albums. To include a comment, add a colon and write it directly on the album line, like this:

> I'm Not Dead: But your career is

* PM it all to me. Then just sit tight until the reveal begins some time in September!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask below. I'll be accepting scores until the end of the month - I'm not going to give a set time because even if I did I would probably extend it, but don't be a shitter and just try to get it in before September starts.
