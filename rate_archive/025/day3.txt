I'm not sure how this song got this far tbh. I thought it was super generic, and it deadass sounds like something from a Hannah Montana soundtrack (which would usually be a compliment, but I expect a bit more edge from Pink, you know?) 

---

#If you're all that lonely then you guys should just meet up

**zamomattel**: "Wow queen of relatable bops"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "I relate on a personal level."

**mokitsu**: "very relatable"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "can relate"

**poppinmmolly**: "this annoys me but at the same time I feel it"

**therokinrolla**: "so this whole album was my edgy album when i was a kid so when i was feeling REALLY edgy i would be edgy to this song specifically."

**10footnotes**: "me_irl"

**agentofscranton**: "I can’t believe P!nk would expose me like this"

#Please Don't Leave Me 

**MrSwearword**: "YAS KWEEN, FIGHT FOR YOUR ME TIME"

**TeamAwesome4**: "Fucking great, and generally a unique song about needing space, but not because someone did anything wrong. She nailed this shit."

**awryj**: "An unexpected upbeat bittersweet bop"

**jess_22**: "the very definition of mom pop" this is a compliment

**wearingsox**: "This was a surprise! Upbeat and catchy and honest."

**eklxtreme**: "the instrumentation is amazing and very alternative which I love. The vocals work really well with it too."

**Jailhousepoop**: "The umpteenth generic pop-rock song by P!nk but the verses are kinda infectious."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I really like the chorus of this song, I think it’s the best on the album. One thing that I think that’s really cool is way that the chorus is shaped, listen to the way “alone” and “I’m lonely” are on different notes and how she bounces between them. Unfortunately the verses don’t do it as much for me and they kept this song from a ten."

**rickikardashian**: "Does this sample “stop” by the spice girls?" idk but a comparison to the spice girls is always a compliment

#Leave me alone Pink!

**fifthchevron**: "ANOTHER AUSTRALIAN SINGLE. Do you know what it's like being the one Aussie with no patience for Pink??? What do her fandom call themselves? Stupid Girls?" this was rude and uncalled for

**peppersmith67**: "this song title made me laugh a lot harder than it should've."

**musicotic**: "The chorus is OK, but it feels like something is missing?"

**calltehshots**: "The lyrics on this album are clunky beyond repair. The melodies are there but god these lyrics?? Pink wyd"

#Both a throwback and flashforward to Poo's rate in a week

**cyborglilith**: "flashback to when leave me lonely was forsaken in that rate"

I honestly wasn't familiar with this until I listened to the entirety of *Let Go* for my own rate and this was such a surprise. What a jam. That pre-chorus and chorus are sooooooo good. It hits you like a truck just out of nowhere. Cathartic, to say the least. This song deserved to go a little further but the top 10 was just too stacked. 

---

#Too Angsty?! ... doesn't this sub stan Lorde?

**Leixander**: ":ANGERY:"

**rickikardashian**: "queen of teen angst"

**calltehshots**: "This is peak middle school angst right here."

**zamomattel**: "Somehow like the angstiest song on the album, quite annoying and dated but I actually like it????" same, same.

**eklxtreme**: "makes! me! feel! angsty!"

**Jailhousepoop**: "“WHY SHOULD I CARE!!!!!” Me too Avril, me too."

**fifthchevron**: "This still goes hard. Lets be real, if a dude sung this it'd be worshipped to no end. I used to angrily project this toward my mother LOL"

#You need to listen!... to how good this song is!

**tevinterimperium**: "And with the song, Avril invented the entire genre of rock."

**peppersmith67**: "these lyrics are hilariously emo and I will embrace it wholeheartedly."

**mokitsu**: "que hino" i dont speak spanish i took french but im gonna assume this is a good thing (although i really shouldnt because mokitsu has questionable taste most of the time)

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "not as bad as I was expecting"

**TeamAwesome4**: "The soft verse after the bridge fucking kills me."

**jess_22**: "how did she go from this to Hello Kitty?" you mean a bop to a bop? because she makes bops!

**musicotic**: "Bangs up down and around"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "iconic"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is a good opener."

**MissyBee37**: "Great album opener. I love how the pre-chorus builds in this song, and then the chorus itself is so pointed."

#Two Canadian Legends (along with God Carly and Jesus Shawn) 

**MrSwearword**: "eh, she’s done better than try to be a petulant Alanis wannabe."

**ImADudeDuh**: "I definitely hear a lot of Alanis in her voice here."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "This literally sounds taken right out of Jagged Little Pill. Loves it."

#Whyyyyyy should I care, Avril?

**skiddos**: "This is hardcore lol" 

**agentofscranton**: "meh it’s not bad but it’s not good either it’s just bland, a poor opener for the album"

**therokinrolla**: "the instrumentals sound like someone filled a blender full of vaguely punk rock sounds and pressed blend"

**cyborglilith**: "it doesn't really go anywhere"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This song is messy and the guitar sounds like someone taking a dump."

AN ABSOLUTE BANGER. ABSOLUTELY ROBBED. SHOULD'VE MADE TOP 10 BUT IT MISSED IT JUST LIKE IT DID ON THE HOT 100. This almost had the title for the most robbed song of the rate, but wait till you see #10...

I guess with 4 other iconic singles, Walk Away was always just kinda left in the dust, which is truly, truly, truly a shame. Those rapid fire verses, which Kelly delivers with just enough bite and attitude to come across as playfully cheeky instead of bitterly acerbic, pair well with that simple fun chorus. And the music video! What's not to love?

---

#Hey hey hey hey!!!

**fifthchevron**: "THIS STONE COLD BOP. Watch the video right now, it's an absolute delight. A genuinely good song and video combo even though the two are unrelated."

**MrSwearword**: "VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown regular appearances made this what it is. SLAY."

**zamomattel**: "This was the bad bitch anthem of my youth"

**peppersmith67**: "how many damn bops are on this album Kelly chill."

**mokitsu**: "a dance bop!"

**TeamAwesome4**: "The vibe of this song is enough to excuse some obvious faults."

**agentofscranton**: "everytime I listen to this I envision some fierce Cha-Cha-Cha/Tango routine and I liiiive for it"

**awryj**: "Queen of referencing The Clash"

**cyborglilith**: "B O P"

**musicotic**: "Left in relative obscurity by the beginning of the album, but this still BANGS"

**calltehshots**: "Okay, my WIG. One of Kelly's best BOPS, up there with Miss Independent. That spoken word part near the end??? I'm wigless."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "deserved top 10 like the other singles :emofish:"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "The bridge where she starts singing sprechstimme recitative about how she doesn’t need a scrub is what every spoken interlude bridge wishes it was."

**eklxtreme**: "builds up nicely to a very big catchy chorus"

#Well if you don't have a good song, then just walk away!

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Kelly is a big fan of this shitty "play the chords in staccato" style of production and it really hurts this song. the chorus is great tho."

**therokinrolla**: "why do all kelly clarkson songs sound like i am watching an ad for a new mtv dramady" the fact that you even know those exist smh

HOW?! THIS SONG DESERVED SO MUCH MORE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ONLY GOT #10. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE UP THERE WITH WHO KNEW AS PINK'S TOP 2 SONGS!!!

Everything about this song just WORKS. Those "uh huh uh huh huh"'s tantalize you from the very beginning. I mean she's basically just moaning but you can still feel the absolute sass and attitude that's about to attack you - and boy, does that chorus hit HARD. 

And these lyrics are just amazing; don't pretend you don't love them. It's every gay's anthem to be that sought after, that sassy, and that confident. Slay, Pink!

Oh, and she served some serious LOOKS in the video. That thumbnail alone.

#Buy Hailee's Love Myself on iTunes

**zamomattel**: "THAT CHORUS THIS SONG WOW, INVENTED MASTURBATION"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Queen of masturbation Hailee Steinfeld could never." I would defend hailee but she really could never

**mokitsu**: "a masturbation anthem!"

**agentofscranton**: "not only is it the most iconic song about masturbation (Dancin’ In Circles and Love Myself could never), it’s also the ultimate ‘fuck you’ song and a genuinely fantastic bop that is very easily one of P!nk’s best (let’s just ignore the fact that the chorus’ instrumental is a very blatant rip-off of 4ever by the Veronicas)" sometimes i question just how young this sub is for dancing in circles and love myself to be the only other two masturbation anthems that ever get mentioned

**awryj**: "Pink seems to enjoy singing about masturbation quite a lot. The chorus is boppy. Idk what else I can say about this song"

**therokinrolla**: "literally ended hailee and gaga"

**musicotic**: "M A S T U R B A T I O N A N T H E M (aka the N A T I O N A L A N T H E M). Britney and Christina are S H O O K"

#Quit spilling your drink on me!

**fifthchevron**: "OK fine you got me, I love this song AND the incredible video. This is a much more effective empowerment anthem than Stupid Girls. This is also my general experience every time I go out ("You know it's over/ Before it began" gurl yes) so ty for the relatable topic Pink. You can be good at sticking it to the patriarchy without punching women in the face while you're at it!"

**MrSwearword**: "the perfect “fuck off” anthem. Another song whose video takes me back to the VH1 Top 20 Video Countdown"

**poppinmmolly**: "BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM"

**triptoyourheart**: "This still goes hard, my lil 13 year old self got their life to this."

**jess_22**: "this will never not be iconic. this has a whole different meaning from when I was 9.."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "I wasn't sure I was even gonna give an 11 in this rate but this song is iconic and will be for the rest of our existence."

**TeamAwesome4**: "This song is a shot of rattlesnake venom in more ways than one. Nothing gets your heart beating a mile a minute quicker than this song."

**ImADudeDuh**: "No by Meghan is shook"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "If P!nk has to win the rate, this has to be the song that wins. This literally ended fucckbois, when will New Rules ever?"

**eklxtreme**: "it's really only good for that chorus but that chorus is so fucking good"

**cyborglilith**: "this album is bop after bop after BOP"

**Leixander**: "P!nk, dragging men since 1999 with Lily Allen." the gays are misandric so of course this song will do well

**rickikardashian**: "The “uh uh uh” hook goes OFF. Also the spoken part slayed my ass"

**wearingsox**: "This is the last P!nk single I liked."

**calltehshots**: "This song is iconic. Drag these men!!"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "okay honestly TRULY this deserves an 11 and I can't fucking decide between this and since u been gone but whatever just know that this is a god tier song; if y'all are salty about stupid girls being anti-feminist then look no further than this oop"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Mmm, it’s not “No” by Meghan Trainor, but it’s alright I guess." ok i love meghan but absolutely disgusting opinion

#Literally only two people didn't like this song and HOW?

**peppersmith67**: "decent chorus doesn't make up for... everything else"

**MissyBee37**: "I don't like to use 0s, but I hated this song when it was a hit and I hate it now. It's just so grating. So have my zero, u & ur hand."

#Absolutely Disgusting Sabotage - please Vilify him

**Jailhousepoop**: "OKAY THIS SONG IS A BOOOPPP!!!!! But I know this will get high points and my girl Avril has to win. I can’t believe that you have to pit Avril and P!nk against each other. I call for misogyny. This score is your fault /u/gannade ."

MissyBee37: So, I haven't been able to get this song out of my head since I got on here and read the results, and I feel as one of the few low scores and obviously the lowest like I need to say something.

I want to be clear first off that I would NEVER stoop to sabotaging something. I am nothing if not a rule-follower and someone who tries to do the right thing. So I would never want to be lumped in with the cheating choices of a certain other user.

I've only done a few rates and I've never given a zero, but the explanation says the 0 and 11 are meant for favorite & least favorite. I watched the reveal of the first rate I ever did closely to see what others wrote, how they rated, etc., and saw 0s for songs I really liked - which I didn't think was a huge deal, because to each their own. Obviously other people didn't like them; that's cool. The winner of the Disney/Nick rate had a 0! 

So I made my bold choice and went with the 0 because I have never liked this song. I hated it when it was a hit then, I hated it listening for this rate and I've rolled my eyes every time it came on the radio as a throwback in the intervening years. P!nk has some great hits, but I never understood why this was one of them.

I liked Ghost-Quartet's comment that it's not "No" by Meghan Trainor. I like that song's version of the same theme a lot better. Meghan takes a sassy approach that still feels fun and like she didn't let the moment ruin her night; she just went on dancing. Her song is super catchy. I don't think anything about P!nk's song is fun or catchy. It's kind of monotonous musically (the chorus is OK). It's super aggressive, and if that's your style, great. To each their own. But I don't care for the aggressive tone or the borderline scream in her voice. The grunt-y "uh-uh-uh"s. I don't like the lyric that says "keep your drink just give me the money." Like, why do you want money from this guy? If he's as big an ass as the song implies, then why do you want his money? You're better than this guy! And if he's just a dude you're not interested in, you don't have to take his money; just pass and go back to having fun. Instead this song seems to get pissed and stay pissed. It's obnoxious. It just isn't for me.

I just felt like I needed to explain because I know people are pissed it isn't higher. I respect that most users totally disagree, but I stand by my hatred of this song and I stand by my honesty in my opinion. I would never give a low score just to undermine.
[/r/popheads/comments/70owbq/rate_reveal_2000s_female_pop_rock_rate_day_three/dn5jlvm/]

=====

gannade: This was a good writeup and a different interpretation of the song that most people don't consider. I wouldn't worry about giving out 0s too much or what other people think about what song you give a 0. As long as it's your honest opinion, it doesn't matter - and if you write something as in depth as this, then nobody can fault you. This rate was one of the smaller ones, with albums that have aged so only the real fans come out for it. Which means the more extreme scores are a little more noticeable and sabotages are that much more obvious (especially when they openly admit it lol). In bigger rates like Poo's next week, 0s will be everywhere like crazy with little to no real justification. It's just the nature of rates on an Internet forum, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. Your opinion is your opinion, give 0s to what you want if you truly hate the song.

MissyBee37: Thanks for the response <3 And thanks again for doing this! It was super fun to read and revisit these albums. And thanks for the explanation. Like I said, I've only done a few, so it took me a minute to sort out how I thought the numbers should work, deciding how a filler track or a favorite translates to a number rating. It's a really fun system and it's neat to see what everybody else thinks of songs/albums!

**TeamAwesome4**: "I swear to god, this is Aesop's Fables, Greek tragedy levels of savage. At one point her friends "have a problem with his baggy clothes". Less than 30 fucking seconds later, "she sits at home, feeding the baby, she's all alone". Wait, hold the fuck up, WHAT HAPPENED? 5 years passed, did something important happen? No. This whole this stems from the popular girl not following her feelings. That's the only decision she's ever made that's of consequence. She's alone, presumably a single mother, and having diss tracks written about her by that boy and his new lover. And apparently, she deserves this. Damn."

**cyborglilith**: "Sad because I only have one 11 to give to Avril :(. The lyrics are actually kind of bad but they're still good in a way. also i cry every time for the single mother. idk" i also felt really bad for her like damn, we all give in to peer pressure at that age cmon avril, your entire album is about that!

#Avril is rocking up MTV!

**fifthchevron**: "I can't separate this song from being 13 years old at all, it's the soundtrack to my first year of high school when I totally thought I was an Adult.

ROBBED. That 20 second bridge alone deserves top 5!

Popheads' aversion to perfectly good ballads continues. Family problems have been a common theme for both Pink and Kelly, but Kelly especially has repeatedly explored this topic. Thankfully, Kelly gets a happy ending. Her last album included the title track "Piece by Piece," where Kelly realizes that her husband is everything her father wasn't. 

This song hits too close to home for way too many people. I'm not going to go into my own personal problems here, but kids can hear a lot, even behind closed doors. Kelly really captured that feeling here - of being a kid and watching the people you love destroy themselves while being too young to even know what's going on. Kelly's songwriting is so on point; I would argue that it is one of the best songs ever written. That bridge is just so powerful. That note! I was tired of crying over the same damn thing too!

The music video had such a sweet ending though, now that is something I hope most people can relate with. It has 200+ million views despite being released pre-Youtube era (and posted in 2009 way after it was released). 100% deserved!

#Can we work it out, can we be a family?

**fifthchevron**: "I've tried like 5 times to write what this song makes me feel. Basically...I went through the exact same thing. There are lines in this song that are so scarily reflective of my own life, things I've almost said word for word to my therapist. Be nice to your kids, remember they don't understand life the way you do."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I listened to this initially and I was just like “oh this is a nice breakup song” but then I looked up the video and I was torn apart. As a child of divorce myself I totally understand where she’s coming from here. Actually, most of the people that I know these days don’t have parents that are together and it’s something that kind of nobody is talking about? I’m glad she wrote this song for us, and it’s a very nuanced portrayal of the effects. It’s a totally believable song that lends appropriate credence to an issue that can easily come off as whiny. It’s not melodramatic, it’s dramatic because she makes you believe that that’s the gravity that the situation demands. If I had to pick the best track on the album, it would be this. Also if you haven’t listened to the duet version with Reba, do so, the addition of Reba as a “mother figure” adds an interesting spin on the message of the song."

**skiddos**: "Beautiful song that never fails to get me in my feelings! I wasn't ready to hear a song about a troubled relationship with parents when I was a kid (I can relate a lot though). Also, Vevo needs to change the thumbnail for the video because she looks like a floating head."

**MrSwearword**: "one of the few song/video combos to make me cry."

**TeamAwesome4**: "Yeah, we get it, your dad hurt you really bad, but I've gotta be in a real specific mood to listen to this. Still, shoutout to admitting "I am afraid". Takes guts."

**ImADudeDuh**: ":("

**therokinrolla**: "i love bops about dads. Demi take note.also men are rats" OK but Demi also releases amazing songs about her relationship with her father so she apparently already did take notes

**MissyBee37**: "Just heartbreaking. So much pain in these lyrics, her voice and the melody itself."

**calltehshots**: "A BALLAD. About to get 2real2deep but as someone with a pretty much non-relationship with my father, this song is a lot lol. The climax is too real. I love a melodramatic power ballad, we need more of them."

#Because of Kelly, I have been boptized

**poppinmmolly**: "Does anyone remember the version of this she did with Reba? Did I dream that?" i know that version and its just as iconic

**zamomattel**: "This is such a sing along tune, her most iconic tbh"

**peppersmith67**: "that string section wooooobaby"

**mokitsu**: "this reminds me of an evanescence (rip) song, anyways very emotional"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "every time I'm about to give a 10 or an 11 I almost end up not doing it because I gave Self Control a 9.5 and I'm basically saying "this is better than Self Control" and if someone told me Because of You is better than Self Control I'd laugh in their face and unfriend them irl but I've gotta let things go so I'll give this a 10 in the context of the songs it's going against but I'd like everyone to know that Self Control is a damn 10 and I was blind for thinking it's anything but perfection. Please put this in the comments I really need people to know the truth."

**agentofscranton**: "as a Filipino, every Filipino get-together usually involves a karaoke session where someone's mom belts this out"

**awryj**: "This is one of these songs you've heard on the radio a million times but you don't realize until the end of the song"

**jess_22**: "these vocals give me chills"

**musicotic**: "With contrast to the heavy rock production of the first three songs, Because Of You takes more of a piano ballad route. Hearbreaking, but bopmaking, this song is perfection"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "ended domestic violence"

**eklxtreme**: "her vocals really carry the song because they're so strong and emotional. the key change made me wet myself" ummmmm...yasss

#Absolutely Disgusting Opinion

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "I know everyone fawns over this ballad and I get that it is very personal to Ms. Clarkson but that doesn't change the fact that it is shit. sooo, sorry?"

**cyborglilith**: "i hate the lyrics again but the twist this time is that the song is actually bad"

#Absolutely Disgusting Sabotage - Please vilify him

**Jailhousepoop**: "Read my comment on Since U Been Gone." (WHICH HE ALSO SABOTAGED)

The little engine that could. The dark horse.

ok i'm writing an assay so...

First of all, lmao when /u/imadudeduh gave this his 11 early on in the rate, I was thinking that this song was gonna early out early in Day 2. I definitely wasn't expecting it to get this far, let alone beat out U+Ur Hand (WHICH SHOULDNT BE OUT RN) to be Pink's second-to-last song standing. 

Secondly, I gave this a 10 because not only is it a complete bop, but I was so shook that Pink was willing to release this after what happened to the Dixie Chicks. OK, so I know the context is totally different and Dixie Chicks criticized Bush right before the War of Iraq, when nationalistic fervor was high,and Pink released this in hindsight after the War has raged on for 3 years. Yet, still, it really legitimized Pink's "give-no-fucks" attitude that her music portrays, and I appreciated how direct she was instead of going into the "vaguely woke" route (looking at you, Katy).

Without going too much into the politics, the lyrics are honestly just a mess. My biggest issue is how Pink attacked Bush for his drug use ('you came a long way from whiskey and cocaine)'. It was so hypocritical coming from Pink, who penned the heartbreaking "Who Knew" about a friend who died from a drug overdose. And maybe he did come a long way from whiskey and cocaine, wouldn't that be a good thing? Why is she putting down everyone who recovered from drug abuse?

And what was that "were you a lonely boy" line? So she's going after Bush for his childhood now? I really wouldn't like to be held responsible for all the cringy things I did as a child; I didn't know better because, I don't know, I WAS A KID. It was just a really weird line to put in there. I also didn't like the last refrain. Just because people aren't homeless doesn't mean they don't work hard either, Pink. My mom worked hard specifically so I wouldn't have to build a home out of a cardboard box. I know I'm being a little nitpicky, but with a song as serious as this, I don't think Pink can afford to slip up and use personal attacks the way she did. There's a lot to criticize Bush for, and him being a "lonely boy" is not one of them.

She did get a lot right here. The "What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?" verse manages to give a catchy shoutout to feminism and gay rights in under 25 words (before both became as mainstream as they are now). The verse about the No Child Left Behind Act was especially poignant, and the chorus alluding to the tragedies of War of Iraq was indeed heart wrenching even if a little straightforward. 

---

#Dear Mr. President, you'll never take a walk with me...

**MrSwearword**: "for the entire 2nd verse alone because this was 2006 and she was among the few celebrity figures people cared about to condemn a sitting President [for us 1990 onward born hunties]"

**tevinterimperium**: "Fuck George W Bush. Great job setting america back, ruining millions of lives, and continuing the destablizing of the middle east for profit, you war criminal. See you in hell, bitch."

**zamomattel**: "I cried the first time I listened to this. Fuck Bushes"

**letsallpoo**: "a lot of the lyrics are too vague and cheesy but the powerful lines make up for it - "can you look me in the eye" is a great one"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "YAS BITCH PRESIDENT BUSH HAS BEEN FOUND SNATCHED BALD" he's probably already balding tbh

**awryj**: "That president guy must be pretty bad huh"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "ended the Bush administration"

**wearingsox**: "100% here for P!nk calling out the school to prison pipeline and shitty things Bush did."

#History Repeats Itself

**poppinmmolly**: "relevant"

**skiddos**: "Okay go off Miss Moore! Also funny that this song is applicable now but the circumstances are worse"

**TragicKingdom1**: "DAE current events"

**agentofscranton**: "@realDonaldTrump (it’s also kind of disgusting how relevant this still is)"

**triptoyourheart**: "Still relevant."

**Leixander**: "A certain president should listen to this song."

**TeamAwesome4**: "Not really a protest song as much as it's just disappointment that some of our leaders really just do not give a damn about everyone. Still relevant today, but make it angry instead of somber. Really, really angry."

**therokinrolla**: "a political song for the ages. Literally amazing. And chilling wow. A gay icon??? In 2006??? God i love this song"

**calltehshots**: "Crazy to see an 11 year song about a different political climate directing a specific person still be completely on point and relevant. It's like she just wrote this now lol."

**MissyBee37**: "Whoa. I just keep thinking about how this song could've been written today. I love the lyrics to this, and her bravery in writing about this topic."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Holy shit this is a fucking amazing. I know this is about Bush but holy shit does this song have some important things to say even right now. "What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away?/And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?" fucking had me watery eyed. I did not expect to give this song my 11, but it proved that it deserved it." it truly is an amazing line

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Wow, this song could be applied to Trump. Super timely listening to this song that is actually about Bush. And the way she ended the song, damn. Truth hurts."

**10footnotes**: "This song is actually amazing. It’s brutally honest and direct, and P!nk isn’t afraid to make a strong political statement to support what she believes in. I think the US could use a Dear Mr. President Part 2 right now."

**eklxtreme**: "kinda preachy but I like preachy and this felt very genuine. Fuck Donald trump"

#Pink for President (whatever happened to the girl president? she's right here!)

**fifthchevron**: "Is she kind of...pretending to be working class though? idk I think my main problem with Pink is her insistence that she's DIFFERENT and a SERIOUS ARTIST when she has always been 100% a pop star in every sense. A bit of self awareness would be nice. Still her hearts in the right place here."

**peppersmith67**: "holy shit this pulls no punches. Did they try to cancel pink after this like the barenaked ladies cuz dam"

**mokitsu**: "beautiful and very honest, unpredictable and exciting in the sense that you want to hear what she's gonna say next"

**rickikardashian**: "So, I love this song for more personal reasons. The situation in my country has been shit for quite some time and some parts of the song get close to what happens here."

**jess_22**: "P!nk for president"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Katy wishes she could" She really does

**cyborglilith**: "slay quen" yes quen

**musicotic**: "Great lyrics tbh"

**Jailhousepoop**: "Woke but cute!"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This is the sort of beautiful, meaningful, political pop that paved the way for queen Meghan to do her good work." ummm.... yass

Avril is an absolute star in this song. Something about the way she belts that chorus just makes me picture her belting this in the pouring rain (maybe it's because of those opening lyrics lol). She put a lot of heart into this. Combined with the lyrics, it feels like she's desperately trying to find a solace in a violent storm, and ultimately succeeding. Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I'm lonely! Definitely #relatable, or at least I wish it was.

#I'm With You

**MrSwearword**: "her 2nd best song but proof she could do ballads right."

**tevinterimperium**: "a gorgeous song."

**whatyourheartdesires**: "perfection"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Queen of being sampled by Rihanna which meant she reached top 10 twice with the same song basically."

**peppersmith67**: "Did not expect an Avril Lavigne ballad to age like fine wine but here we are. Everything about this song is perfect and now I have my next karaoke anthem."

**skiddos**: "I don't really know what to say about this song aside from the fact that it's amazing."

**fifthchevron**: "I still listen to this semi regularly. It was such a striking ballad back then and it really hasn't aged much. I love the violins throughout, and the lyrics really paint a picture of isolation followed by realisation of someone/something that's been in front of her all along. It could almost speak to a range of different scenarios, she could be speaking to the listener, to an ex, to a friend, to a stranger she made eye contact with. Definitely didn't think it'd find new life in a Rihanna party song but I'm glad it's the one Avril song that remains somewhat relevant today. It deserves all the praise."

**mokitsu**: "such emotional and powerful lyrics, there's a reason Rihanna chose to immortalize this song in her smash hit "Cheers (Drink to That)" and it's because this song is canadian excellence"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "I hope this album has more of this but I doubt it. Also oh snap it's the Cheers (Drink to That) sample."

**TeamAwesome4**: "One of my favorite songs ever written. Being so alone (and not just physically alone, but emotionally, as shown in "trying to figure out this life") and desperate that the lines "I don't know who you are, but I, I'm with you." are even spoken is heart wrenching, but the trust she puts behind that gesture shows that she hasn't given up yet, and there is hope for a life full of fewer of those damn cold nights."

**agentofscranton**: "this song is like that song they’d use in a DCOM when the main teen girl with problems has a particularly shit day at high school, maybe she saw Brad kiss Jennifer or something, and she’s running home in the rain crying, then she gets to the door, slams it shut, and then slides down the door, all wet and shit then her parents see her, and even though she's been fighting with them because she's 16 and basically an adult now mom god, they’re still all like aw sweetie and they all hug it out, y’know? That said I do fucking love this song, one of Avril’s GOATs"

**awryj**: "The YEH-YEH part is iconic"

**jess_22**: "this song is daaammnn good"

**therokinrolla**: "sh00k"

**rickikardashian**: "inb4 the “CHEERS TO THE FRICKIN WEEKEND…” comments" you're too late for that and tbh it always depresses me when i realize that the sub is so young that they discovered this song through a 2010 rihanna song. oh well, i'm glad they discovered it anyways

**MissyBee37**: "I really wavered between giving "Breakaway" and this my 11, but "I'm With You" is so strong. I love how her voice breaks as she draws out the "I'm with you-ou-ou" near the end. For everyone who called her a poser or doubted her musical abilities, this song is moving, beautiful and so real."

**musicotic**: "B O P"

**calltehshots**: "The "yeah-aya yeah-aya YEAH-AYA" part is iconic. Songs like this are a great precursor to the pop rock Disney sounds we get from people like Demi later in the decade. It's great."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "iconic and suddenly im crying"

**Jailhousepoop**: "This song saved the water world problem cuz of the amount of tears I’ve shed. Miss Lavigne knew all our angsty feelings as a teenager."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Something something Rihanna sample."

**eklxtreme**: "love the mellowness + the timeless pop rock vibes. invented rihanna"

#Leave them standing on the bridge alone

**zamomattel**: "I know you expect some moaniness from Avril but this is just irritating"

**cyborglilith**: "I can't bop to this"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "The other women in the rate outpace Avril on ballads, those “oh yeahs” are particularly rough, but on the whole I didn’t dislike this song."

If it makes you feel any better, I just now learned reading these comments that it was sampled in a "Rihanna" song. Weird choice! I don't know why I don't remember this song. (Rihanna's. I loved Avril's, obviously; 11 and all.)

Also, listening to the Rihanna song now, it has a lyric that's prominent on Kesha's new record in "Bastards": "Don't let the bastards get you down." Hm.

What a fitting title track, and it was written by fellow rate rival Avril! Kelly really did breakaway from the chokeholds of being shoehorned as just another basic reality tv star with this album and this song. Her lower register in the verses is gorgeous, and she transitions so flawlessly into the chorus. I wish we could all relate.

---

#Out of the darkness, and into the bops

**fifthchevron**: "Flashback to teenage me moodily staring out my window to this song. Kelly at least sounds appropriately vulnerable and young. Can't really relate to the "follow yr dreemz" mentality now." me too, man, me too.

**MrSwearword**: "good way to open the album and one of her legendary singles."

**tevinterimperium**: "kelly did that"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "It's a shame it's forgotten now"

**poppinmmolly**: "Why not give my 11 to the title track of one of the best albums of all time. Period. Paragrah. No one can tell me otherwise. This song makes me SOOOO nostalgic. It's a bop!"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "YASSSS BITCH A CLASSIC PRINCESS DIARIES 3 COULD NEVER"

**peppersmith67**: "I have fond memories of when a schoolmate performed this for the middle school talent show and everyone in the crowd waved their shoes in the air as if they were lighters. simpler times." omg truly

**skiddos**: "Queen of Princess Diaries"

**mokitsu**: "beautiful background music"

**TeamAwesome4**: ""Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye" is possibly the greatest alteration to a chorus that has ever been made."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I watched princess diaries 2 at my friends cabin this summer and honestly not opposed to there being a third movie"

**ExtraEater**: "i can't think of this without thinking of some commercials, but it's still pretty great"

**agentofscranton**: "I listened to this song so much during two different points transitionary moments in my life – 1) moving from my home in the Philippines to the UK and 2) just last year when I was preparing to leave home to go to university, and let me tell you, I cried like a fucking baby every. single. time, and it still does, a strong 11 contender"

**awryj**: "I'm a sentimental sack of shit but the chorus and the bridge are just so nice"

**jess_22**: "holy hell my childhood is flashing before my eyes"

**cyborglilith**: "good album starter"

**Leixander**: "In my opinion, this is her best song ever."

**MissyBee37**: "One of my favorite inspirational songs. Such a classic for anyone who's ever been a dreamer."

**wearingsox**: "This song is so relatable."

**musicotic**: "This song is incredibly special to me. Introduced to me by my mother, this song has always connected with me. One of the first songs to make me cry, everything about this song is perfect. The lyrics are spot on, and the opening line is probably my favorite lyric of all time. It sends me into a trance, where I focus only on the song; I'm alone with the music. The chorus is captivating, easy to sympathize with, and resonates with me particularly. "I spread my wings and learn how to fly, I do what it takes til I touch the sky'"

**calltehshots**: "This song is perfect. I'm inspired to be a better person!! Also, her Princess Diaries 2 premiere look in the music video is PEAK fashion."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "invented the princess diaries"

**Jailhousepoop**: "Generic Sunday background music but it's okay."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I can see the Avril-ness in this song but this feels out of character for her so I think Kelly is more suited for this song."

**10footnotes**: "This is a classic song (at least by my young standards) that I listened to all the time as I was growing up. Musically the contrast and transition between the quiet verses and loud choruses is so well done, and lyrically Kelly really sells the emotion behind the words. This is an explosive song, and it makes me feel hopeful and happy whenever I listen to it."

**Nfranklin50**: "Princess Diaries had great taste"

**eklxtreme**: "WHAT A SONG. this has a perfectly timeless melody."

#Please breakaway into a wall

**zamomattel**: "Nice enough, but generic even for soccer mom queen Kelly Clarkson"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "not a song that makes you want to listen to the rest of the album." 

#ANOTHER HILARY REFERENCE?!

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I’m gonna be real, I already knew this song but I didn’t actually know that it was Kelly until this rate. Oops. Anyways, this song reminds me a lot of a softer, more introspective version of “So Yesterday.” It’s a masterpiece of a song, the crafting of it is, quite frankly, amazing. That gorgeous string arrangement breathes life into the song and gives it a feeling of dashing and flying, the lyrics tell a real story, and Kelly’s performance is one for the ages."

Pink is first artist eliminated! It's a shame, this song was #1 for probably the first half of the rate. After putting in the first ~15 or so scores, this actually had an above 10 average. This song is tragic in the traditional sense of the word, dedicated to a friend of Pink's who died too soon. 

Those strings. Those vocals. The way she sings "I'd punch them out" with more despair and hopelessness than anger speaks miles. You can feel the emotion and it hits close to home, even though I have never actually lost a close friend like that before. Pink's delivery here in too authentic to ignore. The amount of emotion she manages to put in those two simple final words is beyond cathartic. The final chorus, especially, with its culmination of strings and Pink's wails, is filled with passion. Pink leaves it all out on the floor, and it is definitely the highlight of *I'm Not Dead*. Who knew it would get eliminated at just #4?

---

#Who knew this was song was so good? Oh wait, everybody!

**fifthchevron**: "Wow, such a 180 from Stupid Girls. An absolutely stunning song, and heartbreaking video. Probably her best vocal performance and some amazing songwriting."

**MrSwearword**: "one of P!nk’s best songs in existence."

**zamomattel**: "This song makes me nostalgic for memories I never formed"

**letsallpoo**: "Pink's masterpiece. That final chorus is so cathartic - I still get chills when I listen to it."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Have I cried to this song? yes. Am I crying right now? yes."

**peppersmith67**: "I really like when pink is earnest and not trying to achieve an aesthetic or an obvious persona. I wish I heard more pink singles like this one."

**skiddos**: "My scalp is bleeding" oh dear

**mokitsu**: "cute, doesn't really move me"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "another song I recognize, but this one is actually really good. Maybe the best in the album."

**TeamAwesome4**: "Yeah, this one works."

**agentofscranton**: "everytime I hear that guitar opening I know I’m letting myself into a 3 minute 28 second emotional ride and I’m gonna cherish every single second of pure pop-rock brilliance"

**triptoyourheart**: "I played this non-stop back in 2006, my family all loved this song, and it's probably still my favourite Pink song to this day."

**jess_22**: "P!nk's GOAT song. this never fails to make me cry"

**ImADudeDuh**: "An absolutely heart breaking song that perfectly balances the line of being sad and being angry. Honestly, probably P!nk's 2nd best song (So What barely edges it out)"

**therokinrolla**: "this is not only one of my moms favorite songs, but its a really really sweet and sad tune. One of the songs that gets to me most emotionally, and The final chorus goes AWF"

**cyborglilith**: "wow. I actually really like this."

**Leixander**: "That last chorus elevates this song into a classic."

**rickikardashian**: "honestly everytime i listen to it it gets better"

**TragicKingdom1**: "The lyrics definitely make this one what it is but I've also always admired its dramatic swell."

**calltehshots**: "This is literally .00001% off from being my 11. This song is perfect and imo P!nk's best song. This song has made me cry and I've never had anyone close to me die lol. The climax of this song is a punch in the gut."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "if the ending vocals don't give y'all chills you're doin something wrong"

**Jailhousepoop**: "The instrumental is the most generic from all the generic pop-rock songs that have ever existed but the lyrics and delivery are cute!"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Oh hey, this one of those “oh that song!” songs that I always used to hear on the radio and stuff but didn’t pay much attention to. Hits a little too close to home (actually SUPER close to home hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaha :’( ) but I like it now that I give it a closer listen."

**10footnotes**: "I didn’t know this was P!nk until I heard this song on the radio a couple weeks before I submitted scores and the announcer mentioned her name. I guess knowledge of this song is just innate."

**eklxtreme**: "perfect dynamic of gentle and energetic. the chorus is perfection."

#Turn on location, Punch them out

**awryj**: "generic" stop having controversial opinions!!!

**wearingsox**: "It sounds so bland and generic? I've never enjoyed this song." that's your loss!

**Overall average**: 7.062 **// Total points:** 346.0

**fifthchevron**: Honestly Let Go did the angsty rebel pop star act so much more convincingly than this. (let go did angstier better but pink had some BOPS here - imagine avril trying to do u+ur hand)

**peppersmith67**: I would've preferred misundastood but it'd be interesting to see if this era of pink has aged well for me (and it mostly did)

**mokitsu**: jesus realness, p!nk did that, buy what about us on itunes (finally, something we can agree on)

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: Pleasantly surprised. I recognized quite a few songs and honestly there wasn't one super low point (not counting Fingers cause wtf was that). The first half of the album, especially, is pretty fantastic.

**awryj**: You can tell it's a very personal album and I respect that, but I just don't like Pink's voice and there's nothing I can do about it. It had it moments though. 6/10

**triptoyourheart**: Some of the singles still sound great while the others haven't really stood the test of time, but the album cuts are very strong, Long Way To Happy and Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self in particular are amazing.

**cyborglilith**: I actually really like this album cover! I was so ready to destroy pink and give all the good scores to avril but i couldn't resist these bops lul

**Ghost-Quartet**: When I was first getting into pop, one of the first albums I bought was Funhouse and I LOVED it. I never quite bothered to check out the rest of P!nk’s stuff but now that I’ve heard this it removed any sort of lingering doubt in my mind that P!nk is a pure pop legend. A very solid album, nothing else from her that I’ve heard has been quite this bold, though it has all been good. She was unabashedly political (for better or for worse, “Dear Mr. President” is incredibly powerful but then “Stupid Girls” is a dud) and sonically daring. I’m really glad P!nk has continued growing as an artist, she’s worked her butt off to get to where she is today and I love her.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Wow, I certainly did not expect that this album would have a lot of ballads. The album felt very incohesive and I felt like the some of the singles chosen in this album did not truly represent what the album sounds like. And back to the ballads, they are more okay at best. The ones that I gave an 8 onwards are the ones I really liked.

WHERE WERE THE KELLY STANS AT?? LITERALLY LIKE 15 DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAID TO GIVE THIS YOUR 11 IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT POST. GUESS HOW MANY ACTUALLY DID THE RATE???

I thought this would 100% win the rate yet it comes in at just #3. This song defined an entire era of pop music. It propelled Kelly into the upper echelons of pop. It legitimized Max Martin as more than just a bubblegum pop producer. The opening reminds me of when my mom would calmly but sternly ask me about what happened to my neighbors hand that I accidentally broke when I was 9, before exploding into my face. Kelly starts off quietly enough, but you know not all is well and then that chorus comes. When people say "powerhouse vocals," they are referring to THIS chorus. Singing it at the top of your lungs is the very definition of liberation.

#I can breathe for the first time!

**fifthchevron**: "This gave her cred amongst music critics. I feel like it set them on fire more so than the public, even though it was obviously a big hit. The VMA performance was wild."

**MrSwearword**: "one of the most iconic songs to never go #1 on the Hot 100. ROBBED."

**whatyourheartdesires**: "I WANTED TO GIVE MY 11 to it so much why do i have to suffer during a rate"

**poppinmmolly**: "This is a damn good pop song."

**zamomattel**: "A CHORUS. I mean everyone knows this song, but there are better ones in the rate"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "literally changed pop music with one scream bridge."

**peppersmith67**: "I wish breakups were this badass"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "this the typa song to win Best Rock Performance at the Grammys because you can hear some drums in it"

**TeamAwesome4**: "There's a reason that Pitch Perfect used this in their audition collage, and that's because it's basic as hell but still slams like a motherfucker."

**ExtraEater**: "wow i can't wait to see kelly clarkson win a popheads rate AND an indieheads rate in the same month" i am so SAD at the results of both rates

**agentofscranton**: "this song fucking goes off in the club, for those 3 minutes and 8 seconds, no matter who you are or what you’ve gone through in your life, you’re gonna show those fuckers that you’re doing just dandy without them, it’s a magical moment when everyone shouts that chorus in drunken unison"

**awryj**: "Electro-mom-emo-pop-rock at its finest"

**jess_22**: "invented breakup anthems"

**ImADudeDuh**: "this song is so fucking iconic, and for a reason too! This is one of the first songs people think of when people think of breakup songs in general. And this would've been my 11 had it not been for another song that's sadly probably already out."

**rickikardashian**: "#PopExcellence #CertifiedBop"

**wearingsox**: "I had the premiere of the music video from TRL taped on a VHS and watched this video over and over again cause this song is so good! Today this song is less mind blowing."

**musicotic**: "Literally iconic. Huge bop, which also happens to be a breakup song"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Probably my favorite song ever. My most common complaint about pop music is not having enough power and this song has the perfect amount of it. I don't think there's a single element of this song that's lacking. As pretentious as this sounds, I can't imagine anyone who claims to like pop music not liking this song."

**calltehshots**: "Imagine not giving this song a 10 or 11? Imagine having NO taste? This is not just one of the best songs of the year, but one of the best songs of the decade. Did people have break ups before this song? I can't remember."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "literally invented an era of pop music. like, that's not even one of my usual throwaway stan twitterish comments, this bitch legit pioneered the angsty pop rock shit with this song. since u been gone is straight-up a legendary relic of pop music."


**Ghost-Quartet**: "Rock music isn’t really my thing, and I’m a little bit tepid on this track. I totally get what she’s doing, it’s just not quite for me. Also weirdly feels like the least mature song on the album. Those are quibbles though, it’s still a good track."

**Nfranklin50**: "my 11 year old self sang this way to passionately feeling heartbreak for the first time"

**eklxtreme**: "vocals in the chorus blew my wig to another dimension" me too, me too.

#Shut your mouth, I just can't take it

**mokitsu**: "omg at this alanis carbon copy of a song" alanis wish she made a song this good

**therokinrolla**: "what’re these annoying dial tones?" why do you always give bad scores to good songs? i remember what you did to hilary in the disney rate

**cyborglilith**: "I never really liked this song's extra vocals. (time to listen to christina aguilera's lotus)" lmfao this comment literally had me shaking. how can you like xtina's lotus (a very underrated and good album), but also not like SUBG (a great song)? i cant at this dichotomy

#Absolutely disgusting sabotage, please vilify him

**Jailhousepoop**: "Ugh I love this song so much but I know that this will get high points so I have to give this a three. Can't take any risks and let my girl Avril lose. Nothing personal Kelly, it's just time for me to do something back for Avril."

gannade: yea but my thought process was that some of the people who gave low scores to other singles could be sabotaging too, just not admitting it. so while it might appear that I should've obviously threw out jailhouse's scores, it isn't really fair since other people might've done the same exact thing as him and the only difference is that they didn't type a reason. idk, in hindsight i prob should've thrown it out but it is difficult to gauge.

You already know I'm gonna have to write an assay :deadbanana: for one of my favorite songs of all time...

I told this story a few times before but this was literally the first song I ever stanned. The first one I ever replayed more than 5 times in a row and the first song I ever bought on iTunes. I remember it all very,very vividly (because it all started with a Maplestory music video lmfaoooooooooooo).

If this couldn't win the rate, I'm glad it was at least the highest rated song from Breakaway. Since U Been Gone is an absolute bop, but this had always been more Kelly. It's nittier, grittier, darker, edgier, and always felt more honest. There is just so much I love about this song. The opening drum sequence. That chorus. That bridge. That note when she belts "anymoooooOOOORRREEEE" at the end of the bridge. The final chorus when she belts even HARDER. The final CRYYYYYYYYY. 

And those lyrics, god those lyrics. If "you won't get to see the tears I cry/behind these hazel eyes," isn't the most clever lyric you've ever heard, I don't know what is. It's just so triumphantly defiant, while at the same time being so insanely catchy. Each word just flows into the other so seamlessly like a perfect soundbite; it makes singing this song so easy and so fun. It's the type of song you put in the part of the movie where the protagonist almost loses, but he/she stands up and says "shit happens but I'm still standing." And the bridge is just plain fantastic. "For hating you I blame myself" is the realization that I realized way too late in my angsty teenage years. It's just too real Kelly.

Did I mention the video? Ahhh, the moment when Wedding Kelly falls into the swamp and the Swamp Kelly turns around in slo-mo to help get her up 😩 . The moment when she randomly opens her mouth wide open to lipsync to the song in the middle of her wedding 😂. And then the face of the woman when Kelly drops her bouquet on her lmao 😂. It's so full of iconic moments, but I love when she opened the doors and the sun is shining. Queen of symbolism!

Despite my best efforts, this song didn't win the rate, but you won't get to see the tears I cry, behind my (not) hazel eyes.

#Kelly Slayson (i tried)

**fifthchevron**: "This was released right in the middle of the emo phase, so this was everyone's MSN messenger quote lol. She even marries an emo in the video. The video is amazing btw. The song is a bit over the top but the video really sells the melodrama of it all. Kelly is the whole package."

**MrSwearword**: "Cassadee Pope tried, but she can’t measure up to Kelly in ANY regard." i saw that performance and do not ever, ever, ever, ever compare that performance to kelly ever again

**tevinterimperium**: "hazel eyes are a bullshit color but this is a bop"

**zamomattel**: "A little cookie cutter Kelly, but still fine"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Emo-Kelly Clarkson is my fave kelly Clarkson. Shut up."

**peppersmith67**: "Back when I watched TRL the video for this song spooked me and I'd end up watching it every day because it was #1 for like two whole months. the image of kelly screaming in a wedding dress in a damn mudpit is ingrained in my memory." a beautiful memory

**skiddos**: "This was one of the first songs I had on my iPod" same 

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "the hook either sounds like every other song to come out around this time or it's just one of the more memorable hooks of all time cause as soon as it came on I was like wtf I know this song" 

**TeamAwesome4**: "The anger behind this song is absolutely righteous."

**PuggleMaster**: "Kelly and me are Hazel Eyed wuneens"

**triptoyourheart**: "There was never going to be any other song getting my 11. Back in grade 7 I used to spend almost every lunch time listening to this song on take40.com. This song holds so much nostalgia for me and it's a beautiful and emotional song."

**jess_22**: "the buildup to the chorus is pop perfection"

**therokinrolla**: "an eternal bop"

**cyborglilith**: "the vocal slayage outweighs the terrible lyrics!"

**MissyBee37**: "This lyric is just perfect: "But you won't get to see the tears I cry, behind these hazel eyes.""

**wearingsox**: "The mixing on this one has always bugged me, the drums cut through her voice. I love the layered vocals of the pre-chorus."

**musicotic**: "The finale to probably the best three song strecht in music history. Each song is easily worthy of an 11. The verses are subdued by intriguing, and the pre choruses and choruses are inescapable"

Want go to the mall? Yeah!!! Oh, the nostalgia 😩

Actually, just have to have a quick rant real quick but I really miss the days when it was cool to go to the mall and just walk around and not buy anything lmao. I went to the mall last month to actually go shopping and it was half empty and full of old people. Us milliennials really did kill the mall industry a bit, probably the only industry that we killed that I'll honestly miss. The nostalgia of that place is UNREAL.

A truly iconic song won the 2000s pop-rock rate!! There were definitely a lot of #relatable bops in this rate, but this one is arguably the most universal. Middle school/high school and even early college sure was a crazy time, where we were all too preoccupied with what other people thought while simultaneously trying to find our own identity. Early 2000s Avril always had a knack for capturing this transitional period better than everybody else, and she sold it wholeheartedly, too.

What I love the most about "Complicated" is how it's delivered so sincerely from Avril's own viewpoint, how all her friends are the ones that are changing but she never considers that she might be changing too. That's why "life's like this", people change - it's life's biggest inevitability - but we only just start to realize this as we grow up. And we fall, and we crawl, and we break, and we lash out as we perceive the world to be crumbling around us, when really it's only just changing, but we'll never openly admit to being scared of it. Instead, we cope with pride, pretending that we have it all figured out and it's everyone else who's being fake. At least that's my own interpretation of the song and how I view my own teenage years. That's probably what makes this song so great, everyone can relate to it at their own level. Like I said, Avril captured the angst better than everybody else. A legendary icon!

And is there an instantly more recognizable melody than the first verse of this song?

#It's not that complicated, this song is a straight bop

**fifthchevron**: "I know it's an Iconic Classic and all but...actually no fuck it this is amazing. I was 12 and the teen pop Britney era was on the brink of imploding, you had Eminem scalping pop stars right left and centre then finally the industry caught on and made pop stars hate pop stars too lmao. They were literally dubbed the "anti Britneys". But the first instances of the new trend are always the best, case in point."

**MrSwearword**: "mall punk personified. Avril’s GOAT"

**tevinterimperium**: "Giving this song anything less than an 11 is literally evil."

**whatyourheartdesires**: "I used to wear a tie like her, I'm sorry" dont be

**zamomattel**: "Best video of all time, I mean look at the flip she does into the hoop to kill the b ball game. Anyway this song is a bop."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3lElikZD2Y"

**peppersmith67**: "all time greatest acting performance"

**mokitsu**: "immaterial legend"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "sounds like something Miley Cyrus would get dragged for nowadays. Not surprised it was a hit though."

**TeamAwesome4**: "FRUS-TRATED"

**agentofscranton**: "I remember thinking Avril was so iconic for wearing ties with tank tops in the music video like wow what a queen fight big fashion with your lewks"

**awryj**: "c'mon avril dont make me believe you really can do a triple flip dunk"

**jess_22**: "an undeniable classic"

**ImADudeDuh**: "I love the invention of teen angst"

**therokinrolla**: "obvi 10"

**cyborglilith**: "THE NOSTALGIA THO. I was listening to this song all the time without knowing the name of it until recently. Apparently it's actually older than I so I've listened to it my entire life... Also, I relate too much to the video, especially the free samples part."

**Leixander**: "This song will never get old. So sad that Avril peaked really early in her career though."

**MissyBee37**: "It's so hard to separate this song from how overplayed it felt at the time (even though I loved it!), but it really is so good. The intro's a bit cheesy, but it so perfectly narrates a real and timeless teenage problem."

**musicotic**: "Fantastic lyrics, impeccable production, perfect vocals"

**calltehshots**: "This song is early 2000s "punk" mall girl nostalgia at it's finest. Where you think rebellion is fucking up the mall lol but this song is genuinely great. It's trying to pull of this tough girl act but the melody is so sunny and sweet it's always a fun song to look back on."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "iconic"

**Jailhousepoop**: "Now this song gives me so much nostalgia and feels. I remember watching the music video on MTV and I always used to dream about having the early 00s American suburban childhood like Crashing the mall, skating and playing in a garage band) not really knowing what the song was about. After learning basic English, pretentious me was so emotional whenever I heard this song. This song just hits home. It hurts now that I’ve grown up and see the people around me change."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Teenage angst perfectly summed up in one song. Avril did that!"

**10footnotes**: "THE Avril song, Complicated is a classic bop that talks about the importance of being yourself. This song was part of the soundtrack to my preteen years, even though it was released way before them."

**Nfranklin50**: "I've had way too many friends switch up on me not to give this an 11. F U Sara" F U 2 Sara!

**eklxtreme**: "issa perfect melody. I particularly love the guitar in the pre-chorus. my wig disappeared at that double chorus at the end."

#Another Hilary reference? I'm swooning

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Oh, now I get why Hilary Duff get compared to this, this does sound a lot like “So Yesterday.” Except “So Yesterday” is a 10 and this is a 7. I guess I just kind of don’t get this song, no matter how many times I listen to it I can’t get my brain to absorb the lyrics or what the song is about. It’s got a nice melody I guess."

#Literally no negative comments, truly iconic

deleted: Um it seems unfair for songs to be taken off the leaderboard just because they didn't have as many participants as other rates... you can't tell me that Complicated is a better song than Creep because it's not.

SkyBlade79: for one, this is my own list, not "by the mods". For two, it's simple statistics. Rates with less people are less likely to follow normal distribution, so it's a lot easier for them to get high scorers. This trend stops at a cutoff point, and I chose that to be about 35 entries. Also, there is only one song from this decade on the list so idk what you're talking about "recent songs/artists" from.

**Overall average**: 7.239 **// Total points:** 354.7

**fifthchevron**: Why was this the strongest of the bunch???

**peppersmith67**: I don't think I've ever gotten more than a few tracks into this album my family spun sk8ter boi until the disc was dull. (perfectly understandable tho)

**mokitsu**: rest in peace avril

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: It was about the same quality I was expecting it to be. Not interested in ever listening to it again.

**TeamAwesome4**: The lead 4 songs of this album is the best string of 4 songs across all albums ever released. I don't think anybody can convince me otherwise.

**ExtraEater**: i hate the cover

**agentofscranton**: when I was seventeen I nearly burnt down my house because I didn’t know how to use a toaster properly, and when I wasn’t doing that I was having a panic attack cause I had a papercut, when Avril Lavigne was seventeen, she was creating an album that would define the adolescence of millions of across the world

**awryj**: It had a couple of surprisingly good teen rock tracks, but the rest was really so-so. 5.5/10

**therokinrolla**: this album was so boring im sorry

**cyborglilith**: the cover is pretty tragic, but i love avril's music theme (why everyone hating on the cover?!)

**MissyBee37**: The word I'd most use to describe this era of Avril is relatable. She really hits on what it feels like to be coming of age: trying to figure out who you are, who everyone else is and how the world works. I love the way this album captures uncertainty and anger and restlessness in nuanced ways. It's so rare for a pop album to be so lacking in love songs, but that's what makes it so unique and iconic. Avril's songs said all the things I was too shy to say to my friends when I was a teenager, which endeared her to me deeply.

**Ghost-Quartet**: Just, objectively, my least favorite album in the rate. I’ve never quite been an Avril Lavigne fan, though I absolutely loved her self-titled album, she was always just a tad too punk for me. I’m just too soft and gentle, emo culture scares me.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: This was such a good debut album from Avril. I have been told this album has a lot of filler but eh, I was bopping to most of the songs here.

**10footnotes**: I’d only ever listened to Complicated and Sk8r Boi before this rate, so I was really happy to discover how consistent and good this album is.

**Nfranklin50**: This album made me emo way before I even started to act like it

**fifthchevron**: I had heard almost all these songs without realising??

**peppersmith67**: My sister had this on heavy rotation in the car when I was little excited to re-listen for the first time in years.

**mokitsu**: lots of filler with very few highlights

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: It just sounds to me like Because of You is way better than anything else in this album. From a soccer mom's perspective though, it fucking bops.

**ExtraEater**: maybe it's because i'm the kind of pop fan who's just mainly indie-oriented but poptimistic, but i honestly think this is by and far the best album. not to mention, i'm more of a singles guy in pop than albums, and i don't think anything else in the rate stands up to this. but then again we got hits like Sk8er Boi and U + Ur Hand against it, so who knows, honestly. i personally love this album as a whole particularly because my sister loved it and would play it constantly. surprisingly enough, i could stand it, so here i am now

**awryj**: Every song from this album sounds like a song I'd expect to hear on the radio 10 years ago. 6.8/10

**cyborglilith**: This is actually pretty boring because the production is more natural. I DO NOT approve of albums that don't have electronic production (understandable because it's old tho)!! Also, the cover is pretty tragic.

**rickikardashian**: Idk what miss kelly was going through, but at least it gave her success and it gave us some bops, so it’s all wins

**MissyBee37**: I forgot how truly good this album is. Kelly's voice is beautiful, and her debut album is perfect for showing it off. I love the depth of the lyrics and the heart within this album.

**wearingsox**: I pirated this album as soon as it came out, I was so hyped for Kelly back then.

**Ghost-Quartet**: I was shook by this album. Seriously, I really underestimated Kelly. She’s always been someone that I knew about but never paid much attention to (other than “My Life Would Suck Without You” which is one of my favorite songs) and I had listened to and liked albums by P!nk and Avril before so Kelly was something of a dark horse for me in the rate, and wow she far exceeded my expectations. I’ve been listening to the new songs that she just released and I have to say that Kelly is frigging great, she gained a new fan.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Wow, I did not expect to like many bops from this album! I am suprised.

**Nfranklin50**: I feel like between this avril and Avrils album you get a dichotomy for every mid 2000's girl stereotype in high school. you're either a trashy punk rocker or the preppy girl who shouldn't be messed with

[/r/popheads/comments/70owbq/rate_reveal_2000s_female_pop_rock_rate_day_three/dn54wnv/]

=====

gannade: OK so since there is some controversy regarding the sabotage, let me just explain my thought process about it. Hopefully, future rate hosts can figure out a better way to deal with it. Obviously, we don't want sabotage in rates because it spoils the fun, that's black and white. But where do we draw the line? That's a little more problematic.

First of all, the following hypotheticals aren't about Jailhouse specifically, but just what I think are potential problems and why I'm conflicted on the entire issue of sabotage. So, what do you do when you receive a set of scores and there is a 0 to Since U Been Gone? Well, if it's accompanied by a comment saying "I'm sabotaging this so XXX can win," then obviously you need to do something. But what do you do? Kindly ask him/her to resubmit? It comes back and it's now a 3 and you have to question if that's still a true score. You can refuse to resubmit until the score is higher but what if the 3 is actually the true score? The original rater replies as such, and you're forced to accept the 3. OK, but what if the rater lied and he loves the song, but still wants to sabotage? You, on the other side of a computer screen, have no idea about what this person truly likes or dislikes, which lies the heart of the problem. You never know, for sure.

Here's another situation - you receive a set of scores and there's a 0 to Since U Been Gone but this time with no explanation. Again, maybe this rater just truly hates SUBG and that's fine. But do you force him to write an explanation explaining why, or you otherwise don't accept the scores? That opens up a whole other discussion because then you have to dictate exactly how long or detailed the explanation has to be, or else you get explanations like "I hate the chorus" and you might as well have asked for no explanation at all. Suddenly, a casual rate that was supposed to be fun becomes a tedious process with another set of arbitrary rules.

In this specific case for my rate, Jailhouse sent scores sabotaging a few songs and left a comment explicitly stating so. I made him change them to at least a 3, which he did, and I accepted them. I didn't ask him to raise it higher because then it opens up a can of worms. Other raters had given frontrunners like SUBG, Who Knew, U+Ur Hand, low scores near 3 as well. So, do I have to go back and ask each person who gave low scores to justify the ranking? Again, then you're policing the rate a little too much and it becomes a hassle. Do singles only require writeups? That's bias towards the singles! 

I think the issue in this particular rate, and with Jailhouse specifically, is that he admitted that he loved the songs and still wanted to sabotage them. In hindsight, I probably should've forced him to raise the scores higher, but again, I think that just opens up a can of worms. Had he not written anything at all next to that 0, I probably would've accepted it. So, the difference between me throwing out a set of scores and me allowing one is just 4 words: "I want to sabotage." And that's just sillly. Now, if people want to sabotage in other rates, they know to just not write anything at all.

Ultimately, this rate is supposed to be a fun thing to bring the community together (and jokingly tear each other us apart). At the end of the other day, we're all protected by the anonymity of the Internet so we can never truly know when sabotages occurs. After all, we each have different opinions and maybe we really do honestly hate the song that can potentially win the rate. I can only ask that every rate participant avoid sabotage because it spoils the fun for everybody, but I personally find it too hard to police too much. Just my 2 cents.

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: 2 cents? More like just your 10 dollars! :meghan:

But seriously, I think you just summarize why preventing sabotage in rates as a standard is a sticky situation and it's why I think us sub mods can't really do anything about it unfortunately. The best we could do as rate hosts is to prevent them in whatever approach we think is suitable for our rate.

At the end of the day, rates are just for fun and it shouldn't really matter in the grand scheme of things because [there are people dying in wars](https://media2.giphy.com/media/rmWoSeyMhuYuI/200_s.gif) and missiles being shot over Japan. We really can't have literal and serious meltdowns about how our faves are not doing well in our rates when there should be more important stuff going on.

Jailhousepoop: I did not expect this amount of bashing and I did not know that these rates were taken this seriously. Yes, I do admit that I gave songs that I liked a low score and I do admit that I did this rate with the intention to have Avril win. 

BUT! 


Where are the rules for the rate? Where does it (explicitly) state that you HAVE TO give songs a score based on how much you like it? What if you do a rate to have a certain song winning? These rules weren't clear enough. 


I'm sorry if I ruined the fun for y'all 🙏

callmetidle: I don't think we should make people give songs a good score, but I do think it's fair to call out suspicious behavior and ask them why. Like idk, if your giving something that has a lot of acclaim a bad score you should be able to defend it, kind of like how the jukebox requires a bit more for extreme scores. If your score is <2 then it shouldn't be very hard even, clearly you have some strong reaction to it. 

But beyond that, someone still saying that they love something and are still lowering it shouldn't be allowed.  I know we don't want to ban people from doing rates, but if they can't play nice then neither should you. Most of the time it isn't obvious and that's okay but those extraordinary examples shouldn't get away with it so blatantly.

deleted: let's just blame me and the fact that i truly hate since u been gone, behind these hazel eyes, and because of you. 
not trying to be contrarian but these songs have always seemed too dramatic for my tastes. 

the write up thing is a bit tricky because i know lots of users (myself included) who don't have the time or inclination to do them. that doesn't mean we intentionally try to sabotage rates. 
[/r/popheads/comments/70owbq/rate_reveal_2000s_female_pop_rock_rate_day_three/dn55of0/]

=====

InfernalSolstice: I agree with your thought process and understand your resolution. However, in this specific instance, let's look at Since You Been Gone. The user specifically stated "ugghhh I love this song but I have to sabotage it" or something alone those lines. This kinda removes the ambiguity of the idea that the 3 is the real score. And yeah sure there's the potential can of worms, but there's no need to go down that road. Sure it's "possible" that one of them were trying to sabotage, but this user made it abundantly clear that they were. I feel like, this was kinda the most obvious incident we could see? Broad daylight, we see someone say "I love this song but I want it to die so a different song can win". 

The second, bigger problem is then what do you do. Ask them to resubmit with higher? Hard to say. What I think is that a clear effort to sabotage should be met with a denial of scores entirely for the rate without a chance of resubmital. Now this is a harsh precaution, but I'm talking about scenarios where people are basically admitting to it. Because if they're truly that dedicated to their feeling, then all 99% of people are going to do is raise it to the bare minimum the host sets for them, which in and of itself is still a sabotage (as you can see by the 3 bringing SUBG below BTHE). It's hard to set a minimum, because a 3 for a song a personally clearly likes is obnoxious, but then where do you set it? Everyone has different rating systems, whether harsher or friendlier, or using different criteria, or whatever. Without any way to determine their true score, the only thing you can really do is deny.

However, that being said, since this is kinda the first time something like that has so blatantly happened here that I've seen at least, I think you took the most appropriate course of action.

gannade: Yeah, after reading /u/InfernalSolstice 's reply, I realized I probably should've just not accepted any of his scores in the end. At the time I thought it was silly because other people could be doing the same thing but not saying so, and I'd be punishing him for being honest. But if he's gonna make it that obvious... yeah I probably shouldn't have accepted them. Oh well, it's just an internet rate. I just hope this debacle can help future rate hosts resolve their own sabotage issues.

=====

deleted: Definitely don't mess with the process just because one person openly admitted sabotage voting. If you admit it, you open yourself up to those in charge stopping you. But anyone who doesn't say that could just as easily dislike the song. Let me tell you I dislike MANY popular singles, so I would hate to have to deliberately rate a track higher just because it was popular. 

I think maybe it should be more emphasised to go back over your rates once you're done and make sure you still feel as strongly about each score you've given. I find I change my scores a lot going back over them a second time. It's very easy to rate familiar songs higher, so I think if there's emphasis on putting bias away, the sabotage won't work much anyway. Perhaps some prompt questions like "Has this aged?" "Are the lyrics good or sloppy?" "Does the production hold up?" "Was this song just a trend at the time?" might help create more honest scores.

eklxtreme: These are really good points that we should discuss and keep in mind for future rates. How far can subjectivity go? Can this be avoided in rates where all the albums are "objectively good?" I appreciated when some notoriously negative users like /u/MrSwearword avoided certain rates, knowing that they would not have given many high scores. I think all we can do is publicly condemn it and call people out on it. Sorry it had to happen on an otherwise top-tier quality rate.
