Ultimate Ultimate Rate Reveal Day #3
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ma2tl8/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_3/

Greeting Weeknders, Chromatica residents. Swifties and Dula Peeps!

Welcome back to the 2020 Ultimate Ultimate rate, where misandry runs amok, Dua reigns supreme, Cardigan is still in the rate for some terrible reason and where Gaga may not be a main pop girl anymore. We are on our final day aka probably the most chaotic day of the rate so far... Grab your popcorn, hold on to your jockstraps, the end is here (AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH - As phoebe bridgers would say).

Join me and [u/akanewasright](https://www.reddit.com/u/akanewasright/), and u/hikkaru in [**the official popheads discord server**](https://discord.gg/tC2DG6xy) as we reveal **#20 - #1** of the main rate and **#4 - #1**  of the bonus rate.

Once again we apologize for the inconvenience of  having to use Discord for the reveal, as plug.dj is now long dead and  the replacement known as Kosmi could not handle our power yesterday. We  will begin the reveal at **3:30pm EST**, or about an hour after this post goes up!

Here's some stats:

* [**230**](https://pastebin.com/04QtQdR8)  of y'all gorgeous popheads participated. That makes this the second  most participated-in rate EVER, only behind last year's ultimate rate.
* The overall average score was **7.550**!
* The average controversy score was **1.795** (so anything with a higher controversy score than this should be considered divisive in some manner!)

Songs that are still in the running:

AFTER HOURS

* Heartless
* Blinding Lights
* In Your Eyes
* Save Your Tears
* After Hours

FUTURE NOSTALGIA

* Don’t Start Now
* Physical
* Levitating
* Hallucinate
* Love Again
* Break My Heart

CHROMATICA

* Rain On Me
* Chromatica II / 911
* Babylon

FOLKLORE

* cardigan
* the last great american dynasty
* exile
* my tears ricochet
* august
* betty

BONUS TRACKS (we love equality!)

* In Your Eyes with Doja Cat - Remix

* The Cure
* Levitating feat. DaBaby

TiltControls: [Congratulations swifties, today is the last time you'll ever see this image!](https://i.imgur.com/qNYdPuD.png) (Though the big question is whether she's losing the [other one](https://i.imgur.com/XpxfXZ4.png) today too)

Also, though I usually post stats at the end BWBB getting **58** zeroes is still wild to me. On its own it has more than:

* Every time we've rated Nicki (42 zeroes/42 songs)
* Every time we've rated Carly (41/73)
* Every time we've rated Lorde (39/42)
* Every time we've rated Kesha (33/65)
* Every time we've rated Abel (not including today's results) (31/60)
* All 5 times we've rated Closer (52 zeroes)
* 87 individual rates

In fact, the only men with more zeroes than it are Chris Brown and The Chainsmokers.

Congratulations Dua, and thank you for at least taking down one of the many records Taylor holds on the rate leaderboard. Can't wait to see what today holds!

AHSWeeknd: I know there was a whole bunch of people who gave B11nding Lights an 11 but I fear August is bouta win this whole thing.

Also, I’m glad to see my favourite songs from each album still in here. Maybe the sub has some taste

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I want both songs to win but I think BL might win this rate. It's the least decisive song. But you may never know with these rate reveals.
[/r/popheads/comments/ma2tl8/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_3/grq9bvo/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I might not tune in to the entire rate reveal because I didn't get enough sleep and I need to sleep as soon as I submit my scores for the Black Consciousness Rate. I am listening to Black Messiah as I was typing this.

I am going to manifest that either August or Blinding Lights is going to win the rate, with the latter being more likely. Poor Gaga. 😭 But I am optimistic Rain on Me will be in the Top 10 somehow.

celladonn: Honestly I've been pretty happy with the results so far! I probably won't tune in to the reveal as I need to sleep and also am scared of discord, but I look forward to waking up and being furious when August beats many much more deserving songs!

* Future Nostalgia: 8.54 (8.68 if Fever isn't included)
* After Hours: 8.53 (8.96 if the bonus tracks weren't included)

**hikkaru** (10): oh MAN this gets me pumped up, hearing "NEVER NEED A BITCH I'M WHAT A BITCH NEEDS" just gives me that buzz and everything about this track comes together, from the production to the vocal delivery to the lyrics that balance the fine line between messy bad and messy fun (I still can't get over the fact that he used the word "stummy"). When this initially released I think a lot of people were lukewarm on it because to be fair it's not too different from some Starboy tracks, but time has only done this one good after Blinding Lights attained the success that popheads so desperately wanted for it upon the double single drop. I'm happy it squeaked in to day 3!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): an absolute banger. Although I get why some people wouldn’t like this song as it’s when he’s at his most dickish and problematic self, but like the song Starboy, he’s definitely playing up his Weeknd persona in this song. Although I’m not a fan of some of the questionable lyrics, musically Metro Boomin and him are a great match and this was a solid song to generate hype around the album as a lead.

**akanewasright** (9): This song got a 0 within the first 24 hours of the rate going live, so seeing this claw its way into day 3 was a really welcome surprise for me. Also - this is a song that (in my opinion at least) is greatly improved by the context of the album. Honestly, this placement feels exactly right to me. There are better songs in this rate, but it’s a really solid song that really brought in one of the best pop eras in recent memory.

ignitethephoenix: # we love fuckboys

**Flegasaurus** (11): the definition of a banger, song of the year, so much pussy it happens to be falling out of the pocket

**2dina3dworld** (10): this song works better when you listen to the entire album

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The rap guys wish they could do this

**booksandplantsand** (10): god damn this goes so hard. absolutely love it

**ColsonBakerr** (10): Fuckk do i love this??!!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Me: Man, fuckbois are so fucking annoying. Also me: YAS ABEL DADDY KING OF THE FUCKBOIS. Okay but for real, this is a fucking bop. I really love it when Weeknd finds a good balance between hip-hop and pop. Of course, Blinding Lights is the superior single but Heartless makes so much sense as a lead single.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This is actually a knee-slapper, surprised I didn't like it back when it came out.

**frogaranaman** (10): supremely underrated on the sub and an absolute banger. also, the Stephen Colbert performance of this song is literally one of the best things ever

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): mother fucking banger!!

**hhiggy** (10): bop

**hunnybee12** (10): a banger!!!

**intheaftermath** (10): this song makes me feel like the villain and I like that in a piece of art. amazing!

**jimmy345960** (10): "Never need a bitch I'm what a bitch need" is the best way to start an era I've ever heard. This song never gets old. The song feels rich but cold and I think the vibe is immaculate.

**ManofOranges** (10): Didn't like it when I first heard it but this is actually a hit, I'm not ashamed to admit that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): banger

**rosecult** (10): whatever, I liked this song a lot!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this song is dumb but shit slaps

**seanderlust** (10): to be young, rich, and back on your bullshit. this is a banger.

**skargardin** (10): bitch it's the serve

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a bop - much needed at this point in the album. makes me miss clubbing so much damn

**twistedpython** (10): I listen to this when I'm at the gym, so I think I'd be predisposed to dislike it just from that association, but I actually love the production so much that it all balances out. Also, as a gay bottom I find the specific lyric about turning a vagina into a faucet to be disturbing in the kind of way that doesn't allow you to look away. That line is a massive car crash and I just have to keep staring at the bloody, gory carnage for some unknown reason

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9.9): The pUsSy fAlLinG oUt oF tHe pOcKeT line would ruin any other song, but here it just leaves a tiny tiny dent

**mayolizard** (9.7): huge bop idc

**bulforster** (9.5): would be a 10 if 'stummy' didn't derail the killer opening verse at the last second.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): i love when he goes fuckboy mode and i’ll never stop

**vintagebathingsuit** (9.5): a banger idgaf what y'all say

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): The best single from this album. Debate a wall.

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): The song that will forever live in BL's shadow.

**cremeebrulee** (9): OVERHATED!! i took one point off for him saying stummy

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): im probably the only person here who prefers this to BL but I love the glittery facade of Heartless so much, it completes the Escape to LA -> Heartless -> Faith stretch of the album flawlessly.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): honestly, this song has grown on me since it dropped, and it fits better in the context of the album than as a single

**joeeswift** (9): deserved to smash like blinding lights :/

**nooodisaster** (9): A FUCKING JAM

**nootnoot781** (9): not me screaming along to “never need a bitch i’m what a bitch needs” despite being very single and gay

**pat-rickstar** (9): Banger

**shesdoingyoga** (9): The energy of the album really starts to pick up here and makes the whole thing more memorable and enjoyable for me

**sirpancakeXI** (9): i still dont know why people in the US push this song to No.1 on billboard first than blinding light, it is not a bad song by any mean but it ia definitely not as good as BL.

**Stryxen** (9): never knee a bitch, I want a bitch knee 🦵

**TragicKingdom1** (9): its truly impressive how he made the word "stummy" seem cool

**vayyiqra** (9): Abel leans heavily into his unlikeable fuckboy persona here but it's a very catchy and enjoyable song in typical Abel style.

**waluigiest** (9): this checks ever box of a great The Weeknd song

**mms82** (8.5): by far the best song on The Weeknd’s worst album, glad it was the lead single and got a well-deserved number one

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Didn't like this when it was the initial single, but it grew on me. The beat kicking in during the first chorus is hard

**Alumineous** (8): Better than Blinding Lights.

**camerinian** (8): Metro Boomin remains king

**CrimsonROSET** (8): https://www.rhymezone.com/r/rhyme.cgi?typeofrhyme=perfect&loc=thesql&Word=heartless

**fishingfor8** (8): verses are much better than the chorus

**Iris3271** (8): I've grown to like this song less, still slaps tho

**J\_Toe** (8): not a fan of some of the language, but the beat is good.

**jackisboredtoday** (8): Metro Boomin really did turn this hoe into a mosh pit

**jayjaysortagay** (8): ehhhhhh, weird choice for a lead single but its still very good

**KennyEarthman** (8): this needs to be a trending edit audio

**mythicalbeaste** (8): iconic first line

**NotWith10000Men** (8): him being able to hit high notes just elevates everything he does. The other dudes could never

**pig-serpent** (8): The trap bass works very well with the general sound of the album and makes this song pop a lot more than the few tracks before it. The more psychadellic bridge gave me whiplash the first time I heard it but on repeat listens I'm sad it doesn't have the same effect.

**rickikardashian** (8): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/739218471535116341/820894652571189258/the-weeknd-new-song-heartless.jpg

**Roxieloxie** (8): i turn my feminist brain off for 25 seconds to yell 'NEVER NEED A BITCH IM WHAT A BITCH NEEDS' and then i turn it back on. Anyway this song Is arguably better in the context of the album, like at least the future meme ( you know the one) energy that this gives off is more intentional following along with the album

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): underrated imo, which is weird because it was the first single

**wasian-invasion** (8): i thought this flopped when it dropped out of the top 10 right after debuting at #1. Little did I know it was just an omen of things to come the next year…

**wavingwolves** (8): the last minute of this song is one of the best in his career

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): Makes me feel like a bad bitch

**plastichaxan** (7.8): this finally brings me back into the album

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): a little overhated

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): it's at LEAST a 7 for the opening verse alone

**jasannn** (7.5): Not a bad "lead" single in retrospect but it is vastly overshadowed by blinding lights

**moooo566** (7.5): I quite like this, I originally gave it an 8 but had to come back and drop it to make space on the scoring spectrum for other songs later on.

**MrMoodle** (7.5): The Weeknd going on about how heartless he is in the most squeaky voice ever kinda makes me giggle lol

**bbfan132** (7): didn’t care for it at all when it first came out but it’s grown on me - still one of my least favorites though

ignitethephoenix: # stummy feeling sickly? try pepto bismol

**runaway3212** (7): This SLAPS, but it also SUCKS

**outsideeyess** (6.9): not a fan of the lyrics but it was musically interesting

**givebackmysweatshirt** (6): the way we knew blinding lights was the superior song

**just\_thonking** (6): Keep going back and forth between enjoying this song and finding it annoying

**SmileAndTears** (6): Eh, it’s fine

**RandomHypnotica** (5.9): Crazy to think this was the lead single when it sounds so different than almost every other single

**1998tweety** (5): never have i been more vindicated than when i saw BL outdo this shitty ass song after it was chosen as the lead over BL.

**bluepupz** (5): Meh, I don't hate it and I don't love it. It's nice for picking up the pace after a run of slower, sadder songs, but it's just fine to me.

**Jackalope117** (5): this song is really good at its core but i just dont like the production

**ryjomom** (4.2): I'd had a dream I liked this song but then I woke up.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4): i don't like it that much because i feel like he's made similar songs before but the bridge saves it

**wailord\_fan** (4): This was justly the lead single that we all forgot about.

**fallenriot** (3): i fucking hate this song, i am so sorry

**MrSwearword** (1): as hard as the beat goes, it's the retread of the pussy and cocaine equals "Weeknd" he's attempting to subvert but without making the song good.

**zagreux** (0): I already mentioned my issue with this song in the album comments. I feel kinda icky listening to this, but maybe that's just me being heterophobic.

# pussy is not popheads friendly

**twistedpython** (10): I listen to this when I'm at the gym, so I think I'd be predisposed to dislike it just from that association, but I actually love the production so much that it all balances out.

**hikkaru** (10): The "lead single" for folklore, cardigan is actually one of my faves on the album despite a lot of people finding it a bit mediocre compared to a lot of other tracks (especially given its status as a single). But for me, I absolutely love the production work and the melodies are absolutely gorgeous. "You drew stars around my scars but now I'm bleeeeediiiiiing" is one of my fave lyrics on the album, especially paired with its delivery in the song's bridge, which is a highlight of the song for me. I know some people disagree with it being the album's single, so I'm glad it has enough fans to get it to squeak into day 3.

**akanewasright** (7): …yeah, I don’t love this song. I think it’s got really strong moments (especially the bridge), but there are a few less than perfect lines thrown into the mix that hurt the song a little for me (the title line is the problem mostly). Given the amount of hate I see for this song, I didn’t exactly expect it to make day 3, so the fact that it made it this far is impressive to me.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): A solid song however there’s something that just annoys me about the song and I can’t pin point why. It a song I just have an urge to skip or just sigh with annoyance when it comes on. I think it’s the piano riff and the verses that just don’t click for me. The chorus I think is really strong however as well as the lyrics as a whole.

ignitethephoenix: # sweater weather

**aladreeladon** (11): this is song feels like a warm blanket, or rather, a cardigan. it makes me cry. i love it.

**whyishestaring** (11): THIS IS HER BEST LEAD SINGLE EVER, (a huge glow-up from Me!) AND AS SOON AS I HEARD IT I KNEW FOLKLORE WAS GONNE BE ETHEREAL, WHY DID YOU GUYS SLEEP ON THIS

**1998tweety** (10): of course im gonna slap a 10 on the taylor song that sounds like lana

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don’t know why people don’t like this, it’s such an experience.

**CarlieScion** (10): this song had no reason to sound this sensual

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): teenage love triangle is my favourite

**ColsonBakerr** (10): that fucking bridge I just wanna cry it's soo good. is she finally releasing good singles?!!

**followingfreeways** (10): we all know she sucks at picking lead singles, but this is her first lead single since "Mine" that I think is an accurate representation of how good the album is. her lyricism in this one is just so beautiful, especially that ending "leaving like a father, running like water" is one of my favorite lines. i just feel like this paints a beautiful picture and i have yet to tire of it.

**J\_Toe** (10): I already thought this song was a 9/10, but I like it even more now that we have Willow

**ManofOranges** (10): Stream the bossa nova version for clear skin!!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STfpEvSspQM

**mayolizard** (10): omfg this is so good

**mythicalbeaste** (10): miles beyond willow

**rickikardashian** (10): [no thoughts, just normani dancing with this song in the background](https://youtu.be/QQUmgyFIQAs)

**skargardin** (10): this has so much hygge energy and i absolutely love it

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (10): this single stole my heart. It just, it stole it, it stole my heart.

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): its nice, I don't skip it when I try to do a listen through, and it really breathes life into this album.

**jimmy345960** (9.5): i feel like this is my in high school and makes me think of how wrong i was but also that i just needed a hug. also when the song glitches out at the end is one of my favorite parts of this song and it makes me thing im in a cabin in upstate new york looking out at the mountains. wow what a vibe

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9.2): The bridge is what makes this song shine. The rest is good too but THE BRIDGE.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): I do love the concept of the love triangle, and Taylor really played to her storytelling strengths here, but the stupid shit she did with the single promo with this really left a bad taste in my mouth and it kinda sours this track

**bbfan132** (9): the harmonies in the background… :poohascend:

**camerinian** (9): ugh the swell on this thing is the stuff of dreams

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The chorus is really pretty!

**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): Poor Betty. Got cheated on but still doesn't have the best song in the love triangle.

**just\_thonking** (9): I love Lana Del Rey

**lillipup03** (9): Somehow I’m still not tired of this song, even with how overplayed it got.

**mms82** (9): the video is amazing and the song is fantastic, but continues Taylor’s trend of not picking the perfect lead singles

**musical\_pyn** (9): I really liked this song, and then I couldn’t stand it, and then it became one of my favorites. I don’t think the lyrics are too much better than the other standouts on the album, but the way taylor sings this song elevates it for me

**shesdoingyoga** (9): It sounds pretty but somehow it suffers from being overly poetic

**thePotatofairyy** (9): cute but like actually really cute. Really well written and socially great. That chorus makes me feel so happy

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): She finally managed to choose the best song on the album for the first single. I love the way it flows, truly like running water.

**twistedpython** (9): A flop for sure but a very sonically pleasing flop

**wasian-invasion** (9): the production on this song feels so unique idk how to describe it

**wavingwolves** (9): this can't be a full 10 because i don't love the first and second verses but that bridge + mixed repeated chorus at the end is so magical that i also can't give this below a 9

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): So pretty!

**Stryxen** (8.9): the lyrics tell such a story without really revolving around a single event idk I just think that's neat

**team\_kockroach** (8.8): Develops the theme of a cardigan really, really well

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I am surprised that this is the polarizing track on the album and I have a feeling that this being the lead single didn't help things. This is probably one of the best lead singles she has ever released as it summarized what listeners should expect from Folklore. I also love the Lana influences in the songwriting here.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8.5): there's something addicting that forces me back to this song, and i don't mean the financial pressure swifties put me under to buy 30 copies of this song.

**intheaftermath** (8.5): the way she sings "Peter losing Wendy" >>>>>

**moooo566** (8.5): Taylor would pick her best lead single in a while to be the album that was a surprise drop, so it hardly matters.

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): it is pretty good but lack any memorable part.

**aliensexist** (8.2): Having bought two merch cardigans I'm legally obliged to give it above an eight

**cremeebrulee** (8): its grown off me a little but the first time i heard this, i couldn’t help but think THIS was the type of music i wanted taylor to release since forever. in the context of the album, it’s easily overshadowed but i still like it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): This music video was so pretty, we really paid it dust. The song itself is fine, but I would rather talk about the music video.

**jasannn** (8): The weakest of the love triangle songs but that bridge is amazing.

**LeninaCrowne94** (8): I like this song but I’m convinced that the metaphor of the cardigan was only chosen because it matches the aesthetic of the era

**nooodisaster** (8): "Tried to change the ending, Peter losing Wendy." Lyrically, a grand dunk (idk sports). But I'm sooo bored sonically until the bridge, where it goes to a full 11.

**runaway3212** (8): Her voice sounds amazing here and the lyrics are great, but the instrumentals are a bit messy I think

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i enjoy the song and love the haunting vie throughout it but it didn't have alot of replay for me

**Vromega** (8): I don't think it was the best lead single choice but the MV is absolutely lovely.

**waluigiest** (8): a fine song with like a fine extended metaphor

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.7): She might be the main character of this narrative, but at the end of the day miss Betty got the worst song of the bunch

**bluepupz** (7.5): I think this was a nice choice for her lead single. The cardigan metaphor is simple, but it gets the point across well. The bridge is great!

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Swifties will really send anything to #1 huh

**vintagebathingsuit** (7.5): bridge saves the song

**wryn\_** (7.5): the last section on this is so poignant, genuinely amazing songwriting from taylor. the whole song takes a while to get going though

**hielord** (7.3): do you ever feel like a plastic bag?

**ryjomom** (7.2): Is she 70 years old? Who’s wearing cardigans?

**booksandplantsand** (7): good but easily the blandest song of the betty/james/augustine trilogy

**cocosairdep** (7): It’s ok. I’ve always thought the metaphor was kinda weird tho.

**fallenriot** (7): the way it just keeps building and building until the end is just so amazing

**hunnybee12** (7): the metaphor in the title is clunky to me, which dampens the song for me overall

**KennyEarthman** (7): nice metaphors

**MrMoodle** (7): When I first heard this album I immediately took a disliking to this, but maybe my taste is declining because it's grown pretty substantially on me since then. It’s just a pretty song ok! Some of the lyrics make me cringe but I dunno, it’s kinda sweet. The video sucks though. It looks like a Target commercial or something.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): not the biggest fan of the trilogy but I like the melody

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): It’s basic, but I like it

**pig-serpent** (7): This song feels like it's constantly being pulled towards the end and while I'm not enthralled by the climax, I can see why a lot of people are.

**vayyiqra** (7): If a man talks shit they assume you know nothing amirite besties that's the line right

ignitethephoenix: # left out in the cold

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I'm torn because I'm so uninterested in the verses, the chorus, and the instrumentation, but the pre-chorus and the bridge are incredible.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): I don’t hate this as much as I used to but it’s still a bad Lana Del Rey reject

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Continues Taylor's streak of her lead singles being my least favorite on the album

**brenda\_official** (6): why does she say better like that

**fishingfor8** (6): funny my least two favorite songs are at the beginning of the album.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): this literally sounds like a Lana Del Ray song if she drank three red bulls before recording. i always find myself singing this bridge/last chorus tho lol so I guess I like it

**izeasklapaucius** (6): this has grown on me a lot but still, what a nonstarter of a first single

**ReallyCreative** (6): It's definitely a Lana song but not a particularly good one.

**Awkward\_King** (5): i am young and i know nothing this is representation

**Flegasaurus** (5): i just like... idk i don't have any feelings on this one

**MrSwearword** (5): the production is nice at the very least

**xxrandooxx** (5): I HATE the title of this song

**plastichaxan** (4.8): i don't know what it is but her singles are her hardest songs for me to get into

**Roxieloxie** (4.8): If i wanted to hear about a love triangle involving some 17 year old children i would just go listen to drivers license

**bulforster** (3.6): grating lyrics and a cluttered mess of a mix

**frogaranaman** (3): somehow Taylor Swift managed to continue the “lead single is the worst song off the album” trend with a surprise drop and for that I attest her commitment to the bit

**ImADudeDuh** (3): girl fuck taylor’s lead singles

**bespectacIed** (1): Following up the spectacular opening track with the blandest song in existence

**zagreux** (1): the production is so messy

ignitethephoenix: ---

**hikkaru** (9): This is pure storytelling, where Taylor recalls the past owner of one of her houses (oh to have multiple houses...) and the antics of her and her neighbours many years in the past, including dying a dog key lime green. This is another fan fave from folklore so it seems apt that it's placing in day 3, but unfortunately it falls short of making it past the first few cuts.

**akanewasright** (8): This was one of my favorites right out of the gate. I’m a sucker for storytelling in songs, and this song fucking nails that. The story it tells… isn’t really my favorite to be honest, but it tells the story with such charm and succinctness that I can’t help but love it. It seems like some swifties really don’t like this song very much, which… surprised me, even though the overall placement of the song does not.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I absolutely love the storytelling on this song, Taylor paints such a great picture of the women in the song. The overall vibe of the song thought I’m not feeling it

---

# taylor Song writer of the year

**jayjaysortagay** (11): I just love the story behind this, the songwriting, the lyrics, the message, everything. I'm sure it won't be anywhere close to winning but I had to go with my gut that this is really the best song in this rate.

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (11): OH MY GAWD THIS IS TOO GOOD FOR OUR EARS. HOW IS THIS NOT A SINGLE?! I'm using this to calm myself on exams.

**2dina3dworld** (10): this was my first folklore love, and it's still hella rad.

**Bajuko** (10): I liked the instrumental, and her “marvelous time” line keeps getting stuck in my head

**camerinian** (10): I think this is my favourite ever Taylor song. It has all of her trademark detail and narrative, but by focusing the story on someone else, it gives her the distance to really put into perspective how ridiculous the whole media circus around her often is. The story of Rebekah is great in how it highlights just how fragile the structures of familial importance and wealth are that they can somehow be totally undermined by one woman who just wants to enjoy her life, and then twisting it back to connect with Taylor herself is one of the best songwriting moments I've heard in years. That and it's got a warm groove that most of Folklore lacked, and yeah. Great tune

**celladonn** (10): My favourite song on folklore. Fantastic storytelling from Taylor and that bridge always gives me chills

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): i love how it turns into her story at the end

**CHRMbishop** (10): her best on here

**J\_Toe** (10): the best example of Taylor's storytelling approach to folklore, writing about people other than herself in a way that resonates with her own position in the public eye

**jackisboredtoday** (10): if this were any other rate this would definitely have my 11, but After Hours is against it so I’m sorry

**jimmy345960** (10): how do you create a song this good about a fucking house you bought?

**ktajlili** (10): UNDERRATED

**letsallpoo** (10): there goes the thiccest woman this town has ever seen

**ManofOranges** (10): When I first listened to folklore that night when it came out, this was the only song I could really say I liked after having listened to it. It was arguably my favorite song off of the album originally. While that opinion of mine has changed, I do still maintain that this is one of the best songs on the album. Is it because it's more upbeat than like 85% of the songs on this album? Probably. And what about it.

**Misentro** (10): Oh this one's a bop!

**mms82** (10): we stan Rebekah

**moooo566** (10): If I had a second 11 it would be here. Taylor can tell stories really well, and this is a fantastic story to tell.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): maybe the bourgeoisie made some points

**ReallyCreative** (10): One of Taylor's absolute best songs ever but Swifties too busy being allergic to taste!

**runaway3212** (10): I think this truly is taylor at her best, telling a story perfectly while linking herself in the end. Her voice sounds so great here as well

**seanderlust** (10): this is honestly an 11 contender. the rhythm switchup? the narrative storytelling with a throughline of sexism? a historical fiction account? all against aaron dessner's production? yes.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I never really listened to taylor more than casually before folklore, so this is the song that actually made me appreciate her storytelling

**static\_int\_husp** (10): man I love the way this is written. A good, fully fledged story that would be great by itself, but then she sneaks in the "and then it was bought by me" at the end, and it just feels so good connected together

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the song on this album that had the most replay value for me. still obsessed with the story telling and the third verse is perfection. taylor's more muted vocals work v well with this style of song.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): some of her best songwriting

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): this so nearly got my eleven

**waluigiest** (10): one of the lyrical highlights of the album. It’s so smart, and the shift at “and then it was bought by me” is stunning.

**whyishestaring** (10): I can't believe this is getting called "boring", like, Rebekah literally dyes a dog key lime green in this song, what more action do you want

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): This is suucchhh a good song. I feel like cycling through a forest through spring with this song on.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): gauche is such a good fucking word. I got chills the first time I heard "and then it was bought by me." idk why, it's just really cute

**ryjomom** (9.5): The Storytelling! Also, the Obamas when they left the White House.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The thing that I love about Taylor's songwriting is that you can visualize a music video in your head and this song is the strongest example of this. I also loved how she connected the story of Rebekah Harkness into her own life experience. Unfortunately, this might mean there might comments pointing out her white privilege. 💀

**fallenriot** (9): the image of that key lime green dog will never not send me. this song connects the past with her own life so well

**lillipup03** (9): How did this go from my least favorite song at release to one of my favorites?

**mayolizard** (9): it's so cute

**mythicalbeaste** (9): love the energy in this one

**nooodisaster** (9): "And then it was bought by me." I fucking love this little story, how it's so visual and detailed, how it reflects sexism and classism without being preachy, and how it ties into Taylor's life in the best song plot twist since Lorde danced with herself in "Liability".

**rickikardashian** (9): “bitch pack” is actually a reference to the bad blood video

**SmileAndTears** (9): This has this weird “summer afternoon on the beach” vibe and I love it

**Stryxen** (9): hello late day 2

**TiltControls** (9): a little gauche

ignitethephoenix: **vagenda** (8.8): Remember that brief time when people thought this was going to be about the Clintons lmao

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): Somehow, Taylor managed to make a song about the previous owner of her $17 million mansion relatable

**bbfan132** (8.5): reminds me of the postal service, fun song!

**ColsonBakerr** (8.5): the story behind the songs great but i'm not a fan of its structure. the outro really gets me tho and the tone change is chef's kiss

**KennyEarthman** (8.5): Taylor's strong suit is songwriting

**shhhneak** (8.4): eat the rich.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.1): Taylor's storytelling lyrics really shine here. However it's just a bit too specific for me.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): “I had a marvellous time ruining everything” is also what Lana Del Rey said to her PR when she posted the question for the culture

**CarlieScion** (8): fuck it up rebekah

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): "I had a marvelous time ruining everything." hits too close to home.

**fishingfor8** (8): this song makes me want to move into a lighthouse in a small coastal town and live there for the rest of my life

**LeninaCrowne94** (8): Remember when we thought this would be an anti-Trump anthem? Anyway, same vibes as Princess Margaret on The Crown

**pig-serpent** (8): This one isn't that atmospheric or anything it just has a good melody and could probably work in any genre Taylor has covered.

**vayyiqra** (8): "I had a marvellous tiiiiiiiime ruinin' everything" - Popheads when they submit rate scores (this is a joke).

**wasian-invasion** (8): eat the rich

**wryn\_** (8): #girlboss anthem!

**xxrandooxx** (8): relatable lyrics

**hielord** (7.6): I love Taylor songs that have big names and the word american/a on it, even if I can't understand what the lyrics are really about because I'm not american (or maybe because I'm just dumb lol)

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i like it but for some reason it irrationally annoys me and ITS TAYLORS FAULT

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.5): Bourgeoise things 💖

**bluepupz** (7): Well, I now know who Rebekah Harkness is. It's an interesting choice to sing about her story and how it somewhat parallels Taylor's life.

**cremeebrulee** (7): i sorta like this song but i really don’t give a fuck about these random characters taylor invents lmfao. that chorus is really catchy tho. also this comparison kills me to make, but the structure reminds me of DUCKWORTH by kendrick lmao

**deadline4mymemories** (7): this one doesn't have as much replay value as the other tracks. a bit of a problem for such a cohesive album. that being said it's cleverly written and feels very Red-era

**fedefreakss** (7): some of you hate on her for no reason at all

**Flegasaurus** (7): ok wait banger

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): rebecca gave up

**jasannn** (7): She's cute but doesn't compare to the rest of the songs here.

**musical\_pyn** (7): hmmm the lyrics are some of taylor’s best but the song itself is just... fine?

**skargardin** (7): some awkward lyricism aside this is really cute

**twistedpython** (7): Until the official movie comes out I refuse to listen to this song

**wavingwolves** (7): i'm taking 2 points of this song off for describing animal cruelty

# white women should just not

**1998tweety** (6.5): sorry but i do not care for this

**bulforster** (6.5): I don't love the way she yelps the end of her phrases toward the beginning.

**Iris3271** (6.5): Eat the rich

**jexan13** (6.5): Cute but it feels like a toy

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): um I forgot it already but it's fine

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Eh, consider me whelmed. She’s shown he can do much better since, but ‘she had a marvelous time ruining everything’ is a mood.

**frogaranaman** (6): just like America, it started off as an interesting concept then puttered off into.. something

**purplechilipepper** (6): this song is so weird because it makes it seem like people didn't like her for catty reasons but like dying a neighbour's dog green is fucked up. I would probably hate her too.

**booksandplantsand** (3): taylor this is NOT a feminist anthem stfu. whenever you talk about songs too much u ruin them

**MrSwearword** (3): besides "Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city", this song is just...bad

**Roxieloxie** (3): maybe the 1 was called the one because she was trying to tell us that, it was the one good song on the album

**bespectacIed** (0): The most negatively on-brand Taylor song of all time. Taylor seeing herself in this long-dead high-society white woman whose mansion she bought, who lived in extreme opulence and debauchery, who was oPpReSseD for having a carefree, girlboss attitude in the olden days --- that didn't strike to you as narcissistic and suspicious??? This reminiscing of old money mid-century americana life always feels disgusting tbh. Only one type of people could romanticize that time period and the personalities who "had a marvelous time ruining everything" in it. And the song itself is bland, so

**followingfreeways** (0): listen. i know im gonna get hate for this. i know that for some ungodly reason people are obsessed with this song. i CANT STAND THIS SONG. and yes its ironic that im a diehard taylor stan and both my 11 and my 0 are going to her but this song is just one of the worst songs she has ever made, i dont know why yall love it so much, i literally can not see what you see. explain to me why! let me drink what youre drinking!

**givebackmysweatshirt** (0): serving us sign of the times faux deepness. also why the fuck is her name spelled rebekah she really does seem like a shameless woman

**hikkaru** (10): The gayest song on a gay af album, Babylon is a clear highlight for me as well as many others. It's just so much fun and a perfect album closer in my opinion, summing up the album's house sound with a clear Vogue inspiration and ending on the most triumphant note possible after some pretty raw lyrics. Thank god this ended up making day 3 because for a hot minute it was stuck in day 2, which would have been really depressing for what I personally consider one of the best songs in the rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): THATS GOSSIP. What a great closer to the album. This definitely one of the highlights and I think it’s just the perfect amount of camp. The saxophone is so fun and it’s just a great song to sing along to. Also I just recently got obsessed with this again and listened to it like 8 times in one day for no reason at all. It’s just such a fan listen and the fact it barely made day 3 and below a bunch of songs I think are worse... the anti Chromatica bias is real

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song nearly did not make Day 3, but thank Christ in heaven that it did. All of the tracks in (roughly) the 17-22 zone were super in flux for ages, but while I wish that some of the songs switched days (oops), this one making it the farthest out of all the Chromatica deep cuts feels right. I would have been okay with this going a little farther to be honest, but I guess a few of y’all are a little too obsessed with what we didn’t get to appreciate the bop that we have.

ignitethephoenix: # that's gossip

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she always nails her closers.

**Awkward\_King** (10): remember when there was a rumoured video for this and it was a bunch of drag queens dressed as gaga eras fighting each other? we were robbed

**bespectacIed** (10): never heard of that fabled haus labs version and at this point idgaf because this is already a huge bop to me. It's high-femme, anthemic, inspirational. In short, it's GAGA.

**CarlieScion** (10): 5sos outsold

**cremeebrulee** (10): best song on this album and that’s gossip

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Fuck it, I really like this one. I love the story of Babylon, and even if this isn’t at all what I expect a song about it, I can’t put down ‘babble for your life, babylon (babble on)’ with the echoing chorus.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I mean, come on this is top 10 worthy bop. This is getting a 10 from me.

**fallenriot** (10): it was so painful not giving this my 11, it’s such a close second for me. and i’ll say it, this is a million times better than the haus labs version, and i’m glad that was scrapped. the character this song has is truly unmatched and this production works so well.

**hielord** (10): STRUT IT OUT, WALK A MILE, BE THE GAYEST HUMAN BEING YOU CAN

**ImADudeDuh** (10): my twinkification when listening to this song https://imgur.com/tzuJbKv

**intheaftermath** (10): maybe I like this one so much because it feels so different? Nevertheless, something about the verses is just so fun!!!

**J\_Toe** (10): look, we all wish we got the Haus Labs version, but I do like this version, too. The owl sounds are strangely perfect.

**KennyEarthman** (10): never got the hype for the Haus Labs version, the sax in this one makes it truly superior

**ManofOranges** (10): EXACTLY EXACTLY AND I TOLD HER I SAID MA'AM

**Misentro** (10): Perfect album closer. I can't get enough of the production here, it's absolutely brilliant from that opening elephant-like noise to the loon calls.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is such a banger idc

**MrSwearword** (10): if anything, this version needs to be two minutes longer before getting extended remixes, the POSE video sells the album arrangement even more and honestly fuck the Haus Labs version

**musical\_pyn** (10): The best song on the album and captures that dancing spirit I wanted from the rest of the album

**mysario** (10): this always felt like a song that shouldn't work at all but it's also my favourite from the album so what the heck do I know about music

**nooodisaster** (10): YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

**nootnoot781** (10): the POSE music video for this, yup that’s history.

**Parabox314** (10): move i'm gay

**pat-rickstar** (10): That's gossip

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the most gaga song on this album

**ReallyCreative** (10): Me selecting what civilization I want to play in Civilization

**rosecult** (10): this ended ancient history

**seanderlust** (10): damn we do be speaking in languages tho

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Queen of inventing word play

**sirpancakeXI** (10): a shame gaga refuse to release the haus lab version, but this version is also a bop

**skargardin** (10): i am so into vogueing right now

**SmileAndTears** (10): A career highlight and a close contender for my 11

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Biblical ballroom queen

**vayyiqra** (10): The lyrics make very little sense and it's clearly just a knockoff of Madonna's "Vogue" and it has random loon calls in it (which baffles me as a Canadian) and yet this song is AWESOME. Imagine ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia with ziggurats and torches and stuff but they also had bops like this and how much that would slap. Again, this concept makes very little sense, it's just really cool and fun, and we need that sometimes.

**waluigiest** (10): talented brilliant incredible amazing show stopping

**wavingwolves** (10): campy fun is welcome

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): If this had been the Haus Labs version it could've had a shot at being my 11, but it's a gay ass powerbop nonetheless

**zagreux** (10): GIRS, THIS IS HOW YOU END AN ALBUM! Strut it out, walk a mile, serve it ancient city style!

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9.9): Points cut for saying 'BABYLON!' for no reason. The rest of the song more than makes up for it though.

**outsideeyess** (9.6): that's gossip

**mayolizard** (9.5): gay rights

**ryjomom** (9.5): we deserved the haus labs remix. I will go to my graves mad

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): vogue for your life vogue on

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9.3): BA BA BABYLON

**aliensexist** (9): Love

**booksandplantsand** (9): campy and great!

**camerinian** (9): Ok fine I'll put on the fucking jockstrap

**celladonn** (9): Such a fun slice of high camp nonsense

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9): If you mention Vogue you're going to JAIL

**ktajlili** (9): one of the most fun, creative tracks on the album.

**rickikardashian** (9): walk a mile in these louboutins

**shhhneak** (9): more songs should have loon calls.

**vagenda** (8.7): This feels like the last track to a completely different album and I would like to hear that album

**jasannn** (8.5): The best closer of the rate.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I love the dramatic talk-singing! That IS gossip!!

**Stryxen** (8.5): so what is this song actually about, I mean I don't really care cos its a bop lol

**TiltControls** (8.5): the chorus is probably the best on the album

**ColsonBakerr** (8): i'm giving this an 8 only cause it's CRIMINALLY short and i mean where's that damn MV??!! i'll say it again, open up the damn clubs

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): It's alright, but I think I played that litlle monster's Babble On edit more than this.

**LeninaCrowne94** (8): This is a bop but the ‘ancient city’ metaphor makes no sense

**pig-serpent** (8): This song feels the right amout of restrained to make both Gaga and the saxophone really pop. It probably has the most interesting hook on the album, and it's a really good one too.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): would be lower without the choir

**Tedyonce** (8): gay

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): this is a gays-only affair, heteros get OUT

**bbfan132** (7.5): i love vogue

**bluepupz** (7.5): I know there were a ton of Madonna comparisons for this song, but truth be told I'm not very familiar with Madonna's discography so idk. I just think this is a fun way to end the original album.

**frogaranaman** (7): the fuck is Lady Gaga doing referencing the Bible? collab with Hillsong when

**xxrandooxx** (7): AK to Babylon, I'm a phenomenon! ~Denali Foxx

**thePotatofairyy** (6.5): Doesn't do much for me. Feels like something is missing from it.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): I desperately wish we got the Haus Labs mix, this version reminds me a lot of Vogue (another song I have very mid opinions on)

**2dina3dworld** (6): I listened to this whole song and I have no idea what's going on, but I think something inside of me has fundamentally changed.

**mythicalbeaste** (6): Ehh, too derivative for me

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): I like the animal calls in the background but the rest is a no

**Roxieloxie** (5): oh this album has a boys will be boys too, how nice

**runaway3212** (4.5): I see way too much hype for this, It's just gaga finding out babylon sounds like babble on for 3 minutes. That said it's still more tolerable than half of this album

**twistedpython** (4): Meh. The completely Vacant and nOnsensical lyrics Grate on my eardrUms and this Egregiously rips off a much more famous and better song

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): gossip gossip, would be in a “trying on outfit” montage in some cheesy movie

**akanewasright** (10): This has been my favorite on the album since release day. I love it so, so much. The build of the song is perfectly executed, as is the ever so slightly haunted feel of the song. It sounds like what it is, which is of course showing up to your funeral as a ghost to taunt the person who killed you and/or abused you. While this is… probably a metaphor for Scott Borchetta, her ex label head, the song is strong enough to transcend that in my eyes.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): Another one of my favorites from the album, this is a perfect blend of synthy, moody pop with a more stripped back ‘folksy’ sound (Jackoff does it again!) The ooo’s work so well with the song and make it so much more haunting and heartbreaking. And there’s a lot of great lyrics as well.

**hikkaru** (8.5): Here is the fabled track 5 of folklore, and honestly it's not one of my fave track 5s? But it's still quite good and clearly y'all agree since it's here in day 3. Once again Jack Antonoff's vocal production is a highlight for me personally. I do think I'd have some songs above it in this rate, but I can't be upset about its placement at all.

ignitethephoenix: # jack antonoff stans

**fedefreakss** (11): yes i'm using it for this song i'm a sad bitch what can i say

**intheaftermath** (11): The first time I heard this song, my day working at summer camp (where we'd played the first 4 tracks) had just drawn to a close, so I was lounging in bed. As I work offshore of Rhode Island, the signal was nothing short of terrible, and the oncoming rainstorm was no help either. I just laid in my seashell-adorned bedroom in anticipation, hoping something would come through. After quite a long time, my tears ricochet finally played, and I was immediately struck by the vocal production on it. The rest of the album did not load that Friday night, but I didn't really care. The stunning production, the lyrics ("you can aim for my heart, go for blood, but you would still miss me in your bones") and the whispy vocals that trailed off at the song's conclusion were beautiful enough to last a lifetime.

**jexan13** (11): The best track 5 of her entire career. It's incredible, with the melody, lyrics and production. It's IMHO, a perfect song.

**runaway3212** (11): this is really a more then perfect song, it has everything. Great lyrics, amazing vocals and these instrumentals??? AMAZING

**1998tweety** (10): took a minute to grow on me but its excellent now

**Awkward\_King** (10): i'm not a taylor stan so im not really familiar with most of her back catalogue and folklore is the only album i still visit front to back tbh, but my tears ricochet is easily my favourite song lyrically on the album. the imagery, the metaphors, the elegance, and her delivery is just as haunting tbh

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): love the lyrics here, also f scott borchetta very much

**ColsonBakerr** (10): so. fucking. good. i really think i'm gonna be a part of this fandom now

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember Taylor said that this was the first song she wrote after releasing Lover and it makes so much sense given the context that this is possibly about her working relationship with Scott Brochetta and that news was still fresh at that time. I would imagine if the pandemic didn't happen and Taylor released a different album, we would still hear this regardless. My Tears Ricochet is definitely the most painful "Track 5" song in Taylor's discography to date. Sorry All Too Well, but a break-up of a relationship is nothing compared to a betrayal of someone you know and trusted for years.

**fallenriot** (10): such a beautifully haunting song, i’ve cried to this one more times than i can count even though i can’t relate even remotely

**followingfreeways** (10): on first listen this was my favorite song and although that's changed it's still close behind. i think this is some of her best songwriting, maybe ever. "if i'm dead to you why are you at the wake" made me gasp out loud the first time i heard it and every time i listen it still cuts deep. the melody is gorgeous as well

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this song is just Taylor’s lyricism at its best. The words are incorporated into the melody and the twinkling production. It’s a cathartic

**KennyEarthman** (10): those harmonies in the back... amazing

**nooodisaster** (10): "I didn't have it in myself to go with grace / 'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave." My favorite song on folklore, and an 11 contender for me. It's just flawless. Imagery is clear as a film. Emotion cuts like stone. The added content of it being about Sc**ter adds so much personal depth. The vocals and production are literally haunting. Stream Love Story (Taylor's Version) y'all.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): "I didn't have in myself to go with grace." that's her to a T huh

**pat-rickstar** (10): So melodramatic but so good

**pheromenos** (10): i hope this one makes it into top 10 at LEAST

**purplechilipepper** (10): this is probably her best song ever damn

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the way she said the tear ricochet is just so good.

**SmileAndTears** (10): Aaaaaaaaaah those huge chunky synths. Shove them down my throat mr. Antonoff

**Stryxen** (10): SOME of these lyrics are a tiny bit cliche for such a personal song but honestly idc I love this song

**Tedyonce** (10): “and I can go anywhere I want just not home” UGH this hits the same melodramatic sweetspot that “exile” does

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (10): how can she make something so sad so addictive

**waluigiest** (10): yes yes YES. Yes Jack Antonoff owns my ass but when his little drums come in during the bridge my whole heart breaks. It’s a stunning piece of work

**bbfan132** (9.5): a grower, love the second half

**mayolizard** (9.5): so good wow

**rickikardashian** (9.5): https://i.imgur.com/KzQJ8ph.mp4

**whyishestaring** (9.5): btw the long pond version is A++

**Alumineous** (9): The instrumentation is exquistite. Ethereal. The background vocals are akin to a church choir, as if Heaven sent. Or a bird song in the morning. The bridge definitely was a surprise, and I loved the introduction of the percussion beat, which gave strength to Taylor's delicate vocals.

**celladonn** (9): The ghostly dramatics of this, god

**jasannn** (9): Hauntingly beautiful. Also, fuck Scooter Braun and Scott Borchetta.

**mythicalbeaste** (9): I love the vocal processing

**twistedpython** (9): Would be higher but this song makes me sad and I don't like being sad

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.9): Ah yes, folklore’s first song that I relate to my daddy issues

**jimmy345960** (8.8): damn this one came from pain huh

**aliensexist** (8.5): Have to say I vastly prefer the live version

**ryjomom** (8.5): Cute, but Cute next to Drop Dead Gorgeous...

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): objectively beautiful, but i cant always get into the mood

**CrimsonROSET** (8): seu recalque bate e volta

**MrMoodle** (8): When the drums come in it sounds like the music that plays in QWOP when you start to build up some momentum

**MrSwearword** (8): the "if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake" moment is a rare lyrical triumph that warrants praise.

**ReallyCreative** (8): the build up is great, and saves this song from being filler

**skargardin** (8): this doesn't REALLY pick up until the bridge but when it does.. whew

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): Perfect for looking out of the window at night and feeling sad yet hopeful.

**mms82** (7.5): I love the build but it never quite gets there

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): For some reason I have a hard time forming a solid opinion on this song. The writing seems less cohesive than other folklore songs, though it still sounds decent

**wavingwolves** (7.5): something something scooter braun

**zagreux** (7.5): "i can go anywhere i want, anywhere i want but not home" PEOPLE WHO HATE THEIR FAMILY RISE!

**AHSWeeknd** (7): depression

**bluepupz** (7): Once again, I'd like to point out the bridge as the highlight here - it's a great dramatic climax.

**cremeebrulee** (7): i like some lyrics here (“if i’m dead to you / why are you at the wake?”) but as a song it’s a bit boring to me

**Flegasaurus** (7): ok wait what wait hmmm

**pig-serpent** (7): I think this song has a nice chord progression and a good swell at the end, but the longer this album goes on the more I wish the drums sounded real.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I'm running out of ways to say these tracks are alright

**seanderlust** (7): i like the sounds of this and I love the use of vocoder. that said, some of the lyrics feel a bit cheesy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i enjoy the song but don't enjoy it enough to go out of my way to listen to it

ignitethephoenix: # save your tears outsold :notitstrue:

**Roxieloxie** (6.8): its picking up a little bit but this still feels like this entire album was written to be the soundtrack to the YA boom in the early 2010s. The story of this song is kinda cool but its still not what i need it to be

**Bombay\_Mapper** (6.7): In an album full of track fives, the actual track five is slightly disappointing.

**astrologicalangel** (6.5): I love those haunting vocals in the background

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This is one of those moments when Taylor gets a little too melodramatic for me. And the production tries to do too much

**booksandplantsand** (6): acknowledge that it's well-done but like. not for me

**CarlieScion** (6): kinda a subpar track 5

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Taylor is a queen of bridges, but I have to question her title whenever the other parts of the song don't hold up on their own.

**hunnybee12** (6): just eh

**letsallpoo** (6): this reminds me of king princess - watching my phone

**musical\_pyn** (6): I think the main hook of the song is just too clunky and doesn’t flow as well as things taylor has done in the past

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): just kinda boring, the intro is excellent, but it doesn't really sustain the attention

**team\_kockroach** (5.3): the vocal performance is a little weak

**xxrandooxx** (5.3): its cute production

**frogaranaman** (5): this is where I started to notice how.. polished the vocals sounded on the “indie” sound and also where it started to irritate me a ton

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): I can't with the way she sings in slow-motion. It's coma inducing! Honestly it might be my least fave track 5. I don't know if she's still doing it, but if she is then this is not it. All You Had To Do Was Stay deserves more.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I’ve always liked this song even if it’s obviously a ASIB cut because it was too good. It’s a bop.

**hikkaru** (9): Throwback to the Joanne era, where Gaga stans would lead you to believe it was an album full of ambient acoustic ballads and nothing else (which is NOT true). After that sound didn't work out so well for her, Gaga release The Cure, a cute slice of trop-pop to capitalize on the trend at the time, and I think it works quite well as a song that isn't trying to do anything revolutionary except be a cute bop. For that reason it's highly speculated that this was a cut song from A Star Is Born, but I'm not sure if we'll ever know the full truth on that.

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song is fine.

# vaccinated

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ally Maine sends her regards

**cocosairdep** (10): A classic at this point.

**fallenriot** (10): this song brings back so much nostalgia, it makes me so happy

**ImADudeDuh** (10): im happier, healthier, richer

**J\_Toe** (10): YAAAAAASS! What is this doing on the rate? I mean, it's still safe trop-house, but I haven't heard it in so long.

**ManofOranges** (10): I don't care if it's generic, it's also a hit.

**mms82** (10): this song is so old, idk why we’re rating it but it’s probably my favorite Gaga song. Just amazing vibes

**nooodisaster** (10): This actually was a mild streaming hit. It's more sanitized than most Gaga, but the soft pure vocals of the verses into the power drop of the chorus is excellent.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I can't think of this song without thinking of the Coachella set, and that AMAZING intro, and how I wish she made a full song that sounded like that intro because it's amazing and deserves the world, anyway sorry this didn't relate to the song but I needed to rant about that. Bop!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): one of her best songs, trop pop haters back OFF

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Wow, I haven't heard The Cure in such a long time. I am surprised this aged well in 2021. Okay, I am giving this a 9.

**mayolizard** (9): yass grenade

**moooo566** (9): terrible confession time i've heard this a bunch and i didn't realise it was gaga until just before i wrote this comment

**mythicalbeaste** (9): I love modern pop Gaga, we don't get it much from her.

**pat-rickstar** (9): This > the ASIB soundtrack songs

**ryjomom** (9): Oh we really going back to 2017 to review this bop.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): man in a pop music context this song is so old, but it's technically between Gaga's last two album cycles, I guess. It's also a huge bop

**Tedyonce** (9): basic but good

**twistedpython** (9): This song was mismanaged tragically by her team, and I'll never forgive them for what happened to it

**xxrandooxx** (9): pfizer/moderna theme song <3

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): thinking about the lyric video we're probably watching for this rn

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8): It's a cute song. Nothing very special though.

**frogaranaman** (8): honestly it’s just fun

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): I love this Ally cover!

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): k so I was obsessed with this song in 2017 and I literally remember none of the lyrics, but it gives me Forever 21 vibes

**ReallyCreative** (8): "I'm gonna heal you anyway" me to the bratty DPS players in my dungeons

**rosecult** (8): this could cure covid 19

**skargardin** (8): for being a pretty basic and generic pop gaga owns it

**SmileAndTears** (8): The story behind this song is so sad :(

**waluigiest** (8): tears on the dance floor

**wavingwolves** (8): omg yes that's my favourite band!!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): After years of telling everyone how basic this song is......... I like it now.

**TiltControls** (7.5): it seems like forever ago when this came out

**1998tweety** (7): mild bop

**KennyEarthman** (7): omg The Chainsmokers made Gaga a song?

**MrSwearword** (7): fine but aside from Gagachella and the AMAs, I admit maybe I'm in need of reworking my Top Gaga songs ever because this is in there...

**musical\_pyn** (7): very good chorus, meh everything else

**runaway3212** (7): This is heartfelt but it's also a bit weird lyrically

**wasian-invasion** (7): this is so mid-2010s

# anti vaxxers

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): um… sorry sweaty, but Covid is still here so what happened to this “cure” you speak of

**plastichaxan** (6.8): i’d like this a lot more if it didn’t have that annoying sound at the beginning and the drop

**bbfan132** (6.5): super generic/not that interesting but it still kind of works

**thePotatofairyy** (6.5): Not into this style for her

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.1): Anyway, stream “Just Like Heaven”

**booksandplantsand** (6): whoa blast from the past! still basic

**ktajlili** (6): Kind of basic for Gaga

**rslashpoopheads** (6): so trendy!

**vayyiqra** (6): I will never understand why she released this song and why is it both okay yet no matter how many times I hear it I will never remember how it goes.

**jexan13** (5.5): Damn, you were so starved of Gaga that you though this was good. You love roasting Ava Max as a generic LG, but not even her has something this generic

**astrologicalangel** (5): I hate the concept if healing someone with your love and it is unfortunately very common

**intheaftermath** (4): this is one of my least favorite Gaga songs... the weird whistly thing just makes it worse

**2dina3dworld** (3.5): she could do better

**oscarbrierley1** (3): so generic

**bespectacIed** (1): aged like a mayfly

**TheCatApologist** (1): My ears are still bleeding from this one

**hikkaru** (10): I love betty and betty is a 10 so I will give this a 10 because it is betty.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): This is a very good live version. I don’t really feel strongly about it compared to the original though, it’s on the same level for me. Still a great song

**akanewasright** (8): I was actively upset by how long this was winning the bonus rate, but this is a really solid performance of a good song.

# betty (taylor's version)

**booksandplantsand** (10): say "fuck" or go straight to hell!! jk she sounds great here

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I am so proud that Taylor really grew a lot as a vocalist and it can definitely be heard here.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Now this I like, who doesn't love a harmonica moment? https://youtu.be/HFpfiFbKjBQ

**ktajlili** (10): Flawless performance

**runaway3212** (10): This is an amazing live version

**Tedyonce** (10): it’s just better live to me? Idk

**kirby31200** (9.5): The CMAs should let her say fuck

**moooo566** (9.5): she sounds great but i'm docking a point for it being the censored version and then giving half a point because it sounds like she's laughing when she sings "straight to hell"

**2dina3dworld** (9): when will Taylor release another country album

**celladonn** (9): The way you can hear her smile when she sings the censored version of the line with fuck in it is so cute

**cocosairdep** (9): I get that it’s quite easy to sing, but I still really liked this performance. I would’ve liked just a little bit more of emotion on her voice for it to be perfect.

**deadline4mymemories** (9): this song was made for live performances

**KennyEarthman** (9): Taylor's lives are always good

**mythicalbeaste** (9): she seemed so comfortable

**seanderlust** (9): the far side of the gym -> the dark side of the gym -> the national -> YOU GUYS I think she's hinting that she's going to collab with aaron dessner

**slimboyfriend** (9): minus a point for not daring to say fuck

**ColsonBakerr** (8.5): I've said it before, I'll say it again- her vocals!! I wasn't expecting to like them so much

**aliensexist** (8): Loved the voice and performance (but can we talk about that styling?...)

**bbfan132** (8): nice version!!!

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8): It sounds almost exactly like the studio version. I like it just a bit more.

**fallenriot** (8): this was a great live performance, but points taken off because they wouldn’t let her say fuck

**jsonphile** (8): taking out “tell me to go fuck myself” is unfortunate

**mayolizard** (8): i have NO CLUE how to rate live versions </3

**mysario** (8): Taylor is one of the better live performers out there

**rslashpoopheads** (8): emo debut swiftie noises

**twistedpython** (8): I adore Taylor for singing a song that could easily be about lesbianism at a very important Nashville event and rubbing it in their (probably) homophobic faces but it's just an above-average performance for her

**waluigiest** (8): great live performance, minus points because Taylor should be allowed to say Fuck

**PointlessBibliophage** (7.5): LET TAYLOR SWIFT SWEAR

**hunnybee12** (7): my roommate and I watched this live and 6 months later we still talk about how horrid this outfit is. literally a bedazzled target uniform

**lolcevan** (7): lesser score cus i had the way she sings ‘garden’ as ‘gorden’

**ManofOranges** (7): Taylor censoring "go fuck myself" to "go straight to hell" for her 5-year-old fans omg Charli was right.

**nooodisaster** (7): We stan a COVID-compliant queen, and "straight to hell" is super cute.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this exists

**AHSWeeknd** (6): better than the original

**alwayswords** (6): straight to hell

**bespectacIed** (6): i like this perf but I deducted points for her not being progressive enough to say the profanity. She set back womanhood a few decades for that /s

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): this was a little boring but the harmonica man snapped

**skargardin** (6): this sure is taylor swift performing betty at the CMAs

# betty it would be better if this didn't exist

**SmileAndTears** (6): “straight to hell” lol… anyway, her vocals are… serviceable I guess but it lacks the magic the original had

**static\_int\_husp** (6): sorry girl you should have just said "fuck" on national television

**TiltControls** (6): sounds like all the energy was drained out of it

**wavingwolves** (6): cute and simple rendition of it

**frogaranaman** (5): it’s a cute performance I’ll give her that

**plastichaxan** (5): boring version of a great song........ hate to see it

**vayyiqra** (5): :pensivecowboy:

**wasian-invasion** (5): let taylor say FUCK!

**hikkaru** (10): The clear highlight of the back half of the album for me (and I think for many others), betty sees Taylor going back in time 15 years to her debut era's country sounds, storytelling, and most importantly teenage heartbreak melodrama, and she plays into the role perfectly. Possibly the best thing about this song is how she manages to make a song about some immature 17 year old kid that expects everything to work out for him despite his own shortcomings actually one of the best on the album! We hate James. "I'm only 17, I don't know anything" okay maybe you should learn not to cheat on ur girlfriend bitch

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): The highlight of the second half of this album, this is a lovely ~~definitely not gay~~ song that goes back to her country roots a bit. The harmonica is a refreshing addition and her storytelling in on point once again. The climax of the song is amazing as well, it’s very satisfying after a bunch of drawn out, flat tracks.

**akanewasright** (8): I had a hard time rating this song, because it’s in a sort of similar place with TLGAD for me. It was a favorite early on for its storytelling, but now it’s shrunk on me a little. Unlike with that song, this was entirely ruined by the “is she gay/a good ally/queerbaiting/whatever” discourse. Like honestly, Gaylors and stans completely wrecked this song for me for a while. It grew on me again, but I’m still wary of it. I think this was about as far as the song could have placed, but I’m glad it got this far.

ignitethephoenix: # we love betty

**mms82** (11): Country Taylor is one of the best iterations of Taylor, and before the Folkore/Evermore era I’d say she peaked with the more country songs on Red or all of Speak Now. Betty changed all of that. It’s her best songwriting to date, and her voice is out of this world. It’s beautiful, simple and fantastic. only an older and wiser Taylor could’ve written this song and performed it so well, just her best song

**MrMoodle** (11): GOOD KEY CHANGE. I was initially planning to give my 11 to Faith despite preferencing this slightly because the Weeknd’s a man and I think he’s gonna get slaughtered outside of Blinding Lights, Save Your Tears and In Your Eyes, but the bridge onwards of this song just puts the stupidest giddy smile on my face. I love this shit, it’s just so dorky and adorable and it makes me happy.

**Awkward\_King** (10): gaygaygaygaybiggaybiggaygaygaybigbiggaybiggaygayGAY

**bluepupz** (10): Taylor is saying fuck? Lol what?? This is my favorite song on the album because of the story-telling and the way that I got heated on his ex-girlfriend's behalf lol. Also, that key change at the end!

**booksandplantsand** (10): taylor just make it gay i am BEGGING you

**CarlieScion** (10): james sucks but this bops

**celladonn** (10): I love this song both for the return of country Taylor and for the way it fuelled the Gaylor Swift conspiracy

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): I've played this so many times since July it's ridiculous

**cocosairdep** (10): This song is so beautiful. The key change always gets me.

**fallenriot** (10): i’m really hoping taylor makes another full-on country album one day. i’ll be waiting!

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): the best song of the album no doubt. it was the best song when it was released, it was the best song when she chose to perform it live, and it's still the best song now.

**jasannn** (10): Not me cheering for a cheater.

**jsonphile** (10): okay confession time I’m an absolute slut for a good harmonica. Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, that’s what it’s about. And this song has a great harmonica. Also the key change another thing I’m a slut for

**just\_thonking** (10): Perfect combination of storytelling and catchiness, with a really satisfying buildup

**KennyEarthman** (10): I love the harmonica

**lillipup03** (10): I’m also 17, and I definitely don’t know anything, so... am I the bad guy here?

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (10): I know she based this off the kids of Deadpool, but part of me just has to wonder if there's a little Riverdale action within the choosing of the name and the love triangle.

**moooo566** (10): another contender for possible 11. I really love the tone of her voice, coupled with the teenage love story it feels like a throwback to the Fearless/Speak Now era Taylor I first fell in love with.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this gives me everything I want from a taylor swift song

**nootnoot781** (10): this song has a right being almost 5 minutes

**overscore\_** (10): give me more songs where Taylor sings about women

**Parabox314** (10): "she said james get in" SMACK CAM

**rickikardashian** (10): *ladies and gentleman, give it up once again for queerbaiting and “is taylor swift a good gay ally” discourse*

**seanderlust** (10): the harmonica is giving big kh2 twilight town energy and yes that is a HIGH compliment

**shhhneak** (10): I want to scream “STANDING IN YOUR CARDIGAN KISSING IN YOUR CARDIGAN” with the crowd in a packed stadium.

**slimboyfriend** (10): I have no problem with Taylor writing about high school again if it's this good.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I'm still a "Taylor is queer" truther idc

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): still obsessed with this song. the final chorus is euphoric and fills me with so much joy, even now after listening to it so many times.

**team\_kockroach** (10): top 5 in her discography

**twistedpython** (10): Gaylor lives strong here (even if James is supposedly a boy). Regardless, I love a good Country Taylor song

**waluigiest** (10): love this song. One of my favorite folklore discourse moments was queer teens getting genuinely, genuinely upset that Taylor was “taking” the song from them by confirming that it’s unambiguously about a straight relationship.

**wavingwolves** (10): something something lesbian love triangle

**whyishestaring** (10): That key change is iconic. I hate James as a character but this song slaps.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): Far and away the best song on the album. It just hooks you in immediately.

**bulforster** (9.5): Taylor should write about being a teenage boy more, she kinda nailed it.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): this is cute :)

**intheaftermath** (9.5): key! change!

**NFLfreak98** (9.5): ok hold on Taylor, on this song you say that you don’t know anything cause you’re only 17, but on cardigan you said you knew everything when you were younger. curious

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): James is trash but I can't help but love this song

**Vromega** (9.5): F bomb + fantastic key change, nearly the best of the album

**jimmy345960** (9.1): my name is james so sorry lesbians but james is a boy lol

**2dina3dworld** (9): this song is either a lesbian song, or a song about a boy who doesn't know that a no means no. Which is probably a wrong interpretation, but meh

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): :5

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): It's so nice to hear Taylor going back to her country roots and to have her say "fuck" on top of that. But for real, James is a fucking asshole. August girl and Betty deserved better and they should totally date each other instead.

**mythicalbeaste** (9): I love country Taylor!

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): ah, the good times before i looked up the song and learned she was singing from a boy's perspective

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): like I said, excellent trilogy.

**thePotatofairyy** (9): I like Taylor swift cussing.

**wryn\_** (9): the first time i listened to the key change was a pivotal moment in my life tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): my least favourite (keyword favourite, still love it) of the love triangle, only because of the very twangy, country-sounding instrumental

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): Something something Taylor lesbian/bi/pansexual

**Stryxen** (8.6): stop debating taylor’s sexuality and save that for your straight crush (they don’t like you back)

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.5): I love this song on its own, but it gets knocked down a bit by that whole ‘teenage love triangle’ that she and her fans won’t shut up. Just let it stand on its own!

**mayolizard** (8.5): bop

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): #teambetty

**Brendon-Urine** (8): someone posted this meme when folklore came out about the key change and it's all I think about when I hear it https://i.imgur.com/6LSkHLj.jpg

**ColsonBakerr** (8): i like it but i feel like it's too long idk why

**Flegasaurus** (8): HEY a harmonica IS THIS GAY

**followingfreeways** (8): it's a cute song and i enjoy it but if i'm being honest i've never understood the crazy hype for this song..it's good definitely good and i appreciate it's part in the love triangle but it's not 10 worthy

**mysario** (8): do you think Betty has a WAP

**nooodisaster** (8): He SHOWED UP at HER PARTY, I don't know what else you want me to say.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): this is a very Taylor Swift song

**runaway3212** (8): 'I won't make assumptions' literally the next line is an assumption

**skargardin** (8): if i'm being completely honest, on a full album listen i'm ready for it to be over by this point, but disregarding that the song is great

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.8): Country Taylor's ghost is haunting me.

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): I way prefer the live version

**hielord** (7.5): the rumor come out! does taylor is

**Iris3271** (7.5): Wlw anthem

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I'm a slut for a harmonica

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): very tired of high school metaphors from Taylor but it's cute

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): this is a pretty good song but swifties have made it insufferable to even think about

**vagenda** (7.2): If this is the last we ever have to hear Taylor sing about high school I will be so very happy

**CrimsonROSET** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl1m5EtDh1c

**ManofOranges** (7): The sheer amount of gaylor believers that were galvanized by this song is too much, I will not forgive Taylor for this crime.

**Misentro** (7): The harmonica kills me, but YEAH I SHOWED UP AT YOUR PARTY brings me back to life.

**pig-serpent** (7): I like the more Americana feel for this on and it has a good chorus

Third of all, this song is literally just love story.

**cremeebrulee** (0): sorry i just fucking hate this song 😭 i hate this stupid high school love triangle story that is randomly inserted into this album (at least with august/cardigan u can ignore it, but its too obvious here). i think the lyrics here are clunky and her delivery makes that more apparent (her dropping the f bomb here just feels … awkward lmao). i don’t even wanna begin with this discourse that taylor started by randomly inserting the name “james” here and saying she’s sing from a male pov LMAO. pls dont come for me swifties, i listen to folklore quite frequently but i actively skip this song so i have to give it my 0

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (0): this is like a telenovela in song form

**akanewasright** (10): This is my favorite song on this album. Always has been, always will be. Every element of the song just comes together perfectly. I adore Dua’s voice on the track, I lose my mind over the strings, I love the drums, I really like the lyrics, I just really love every individual element. And they all come together to form one of the only moments on the album that truly live up to Dua’s vision of “dance crying” that she talks about in interviews. Where a lot of songs just feel like… normal, good pop songs, this one actually packs a lot more of an emotional punch than anything else on the record. I wish this song could have done a little better, to be honest, but I’m glad that it made it to day 3.

**hikkaru** (10): The sample here really is fantastic, and I think this would be a great album closer instead of the token ballad that doesn't fit in the album at all. Really happy to see this make it to day 3, though it's not my fave non-single on the album it definitely is still a 10.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A highlight of the album, although this is not a major banger, it’s perfection with the strings and the overall build up through the song. The bridge is perfect climax for the song and it’s just a wonderful belting moment. Also bonus points for sounding a bit like Star Wars at points

---

# In love!

**pig-serpent** (11): Main Pop Girls and not realeasing the best song of their album as a single, name a more iconic duo.

**1998tweety** (10): oh WOW I was not expecting Dua to serve this hard with this song, def one of her bests ever

**bespectacIed** (10): Gawd damn. Flawless song

**camerinian** (10): God DAMN. I love everything about this song. I love the brilliant interpolation of the string sample and the string arrangement as a whole, I love the multi tracking coming in at just the right moments, I love how the groove is persistent yet ramps up and down at just the right points, and I LOVE Dua's delivery. The way she sings the title line with a clear wry smirk is the best part of this song, and anchoring the track around that line was the right decision. Love it. Love it. Love it.

**celladonn** (10): Fantano described the string melody on the chorus as sounding like what would play when you're being attacked by a group of zombie pirates and that description lives in my head rent free

**fallenriot** (10): the sample elevates this to being a god-tier song

**Flegasaurus** (10): now THIS is a top tier BANGER. the got damn uh the uhh the you got me in love again

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): If Bond were a yt twink this would be his theme song

**hhiggy** (10): i'm giving out tens like its nothing but i mean it's deserved

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): i absolutely love the instruments in this song. the guitar and the orchestra is perfection. she just glides across this song perfectly and so confidently

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): love the strings

**moooo566** (10): the White Town sample is my new favourite sample in pop (sorry Madonna, Hung Up is still second!). Your Woman is an incredible song, go stream it once the reveal is over.

**MrMoodle** (10): If this doesn’t make top 10 or at least 20 I’ll be fucking pissed this song is just so obviously perfect and everyone just ignores it I think I’m going crazy

**pat-rickstar** (10): Top 3 song on the album and I'm going to be so sad when it goes out day 1

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): I love long songs with lots of different elements

**rickikardashian** (10): one live performance to this with a full orchestra, that's all I'm asking for dua

**rosecult** (10): ok slay

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the instrumental on this song is just on point

**skargardin** (10): this is just immaculate

**Stryxen** (10): this is easily the best song outside of DSN

**twistedpython** (10): Strings are the easiest path to my heart and this song has a dump truck full of them to decimate me just the way I like

**wailord\_fan** (10): This made my top 50 songs of the year, best pop anthem/ballad hybrid attempt that I can remember of the past few years.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is actually the best song on this whole album

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): My only complaint is that it feels like it should have been a bit shorter, towards the end it drags on a bit too long

**TiltControls** (9.5): the production on this album really is immaculate

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): “I just love the lyric, “I sink my teeth in disbelief.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): yes ❤️

**booksandplantsand** (9): absolutely LOVE the use of this sample omg

**cocosairdep** (9): Love it. The intro reminds me of Star Wars

**jasannn** (9): I CAN'T BELIEVE, I CANT BELIEVE. I FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE I SINK MY TEETH INTO DISBELIEF 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE THAT I WANT.

**just\_thonking** (9): Probably the most underrated song on the album

**ManofOranges** (9): This one is a hit.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): the "never have I ever" part is like crack to me

**rslashpoopheads** (9): love the vintage vibes

**runaway3212** (9): A huge bop and lyrically very good too

**ryjomom** (9): This is how you do a “ballad” on a pop album

**seanderlust** (9): probably my hottest take in this rate: this is the most interesting instrumentation on the album

**waluigiest** (9): Chromatica IV

**wasian-invasion** (9): one of the strongest songs lyrically and those sTRINGS!

**hielord** (8.8): This song has such a dramatic vibe, I picture a gay version of Bonnie and Clyde every time I hear this song

**aliensexist** (8.7): Another Madonna outtake but she made it more her own

**bbfan132** (8.5): i love her lower register, i like how understated it is at points

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I feel like Love Again is one of the hugely underrated songs in this album. The way the orchestra instruments work so well here is just chef's kiss.

**mayolizard** (8.5): i’ve always thought this was a tad overrated

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): oh so *this* is why yall keep calling this album disco. Honestly the lyrics here are very simple however I cant deny that the track is really amazing. Im a big fan of it.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Love that violin

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): one of my favorites when the album first came out, hasn't aged poorly, I'm just kind of over it

**thePotatofairyy** (8.2): Grew on me the most in this album. "But God damn" is such an effective hook for me.

**bluepupz** (8): I love the refrain (the bit with "I can't believe I finally found someone" at the end), and I'm a huge sucker for strings in pop music.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8): You've got me playing this again and again and again and again

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I like to think of this one as the sequel to New Rules.

**fishingfor8** (8): violins

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): she really pulled the bait and switch with that intro huh

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): this sample is just chef's kiss

**intheaftermath** (8): not a big fan of the intro, but when this song really ramps up, it's great!

**Iris3271** (8): The strings were a nice touch

**MrSwearword** (8): the only song from this album that I haven't really returned to, but make no mistake I'd dance to it once clubs are back open...eventually.

**slimboyfriend** (8): The imperial march from star wars, but make it ~pop~

**Tedyonce** (8): that SAMPLE

**vayyiqra** (8): That sample is just too good.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): I refuse to believe that sample isn’t from Star Wars no matter how many times its attributed to something else

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): very cute

**nooodisaster** (7.5): The production is so good it nearly saves the auto-generated lyrics.

**SmileAndTears** (7.3): It’s good but the sample she uses is kind of annoying?

**cremeebrulee** (7): i know this is like a fan favorite but the only part of this song that i rly like is the sample 😭

**frogaranaman** (7): is this bitch in love with the New Rules guy again? sis a dick is never that good

**mythicalbeaste** (7): but the intro made me smile

**mms82** (6.5): club future nostalgia is just so much better than future nostalgia

ignitethephoenix: # single still i guess

**CHRMbishop** (6): dua's favorite? doubtful taste sorry peep

**ColsonBakerr** (6): idk why this song just doesn't do it for me. I liked it when I first listened to it but now it's just meh

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): The sample is gorgeous, wish the rest of the song lived up to it as well.

**KennyEarthman** (6): open up your heart to the ceiling

**bulforster** (5.4): The sample sounds weirdly mournful to me which makes the vibe of the song very odd.

**xxrandooxx** (4.2): MORE VIOLINS

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (4): the only thing i can do with this song is hate again.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): the bass on this kinda fucks more than i remember it doing but for some reason it just the rest of it isn't most pleasing to me, i think it's the random ass sample that throws me off

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): i fucking HATE the song this samples which completely ruins it for me. the verses are good though which makes it more annoying

**hikkaru** (10): Another smash 10 and a song that I'm happy made day 3. I think I'd say some of the other songs on the album are songs I prefer but this is still a 10! It's a shame North America is so slow to catch on to singles because this would have been nice to see become a hit here instead of just in Europe. I also want to note that it's funny Dua was making a big deal about the music video being ~animated~ because of the pandemic but then went on vacation a few times over the next few months.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): One of my favourites initially, this grew off me over time mostly cause the little voice crack she has in the chorus ... it annoys me more now. Still a bop though and in the top half of the album

**akanewasright** (6): I don’t like this song very much at all. If we were rating this album right after it came out, I would have been a hell of a lot meaner to it, because I really do not like the topline, and something about Dua’s voice, the key of the song, and the melody does not sit well in my ears. It’s become tolerable to me because I can appreciate how fucking talented SG Lewis is as a producer, but yeah. I’m not sad to see this go. If anything, I’m a little bitter that it’s out one spot ahead of my favorite Future Nostalgia song, but whatever.

# gimme those good drugs

**CHRMbishop** (11): the very best, the one, the perfect song, literal heaven , the end of music iiiiiiii hallucinate

**sirpancakeXI** (11): best song on fn it is not up for debate

**WillamThunderfuck** (11): This song gives me such a goddamn rush of ecstasy, my god... It's the perfect club song and I cannot wait until we can go out again to party to this song!!! This song is probably in my top 10 songs of all time just because of how happy and excited it makes me!

**xxrandooxx** (11): post pfizer injection club scene better have this song on repeat

**2dina3dworld** (10): okay, I know very little about Dua but this has to be a single, right?

**bespectacIed** (10): I vividly remember when the leak came through, everyone was evenly split between Hallucinate and Levitating as to what the best song on the album is. I'm glad that us Levitating hive is the clear winner, but Hallucinate is THAT girl too. Pop perfection.

**bluepupz** (10): I looped this way, way too much when the album first came out. This one's my favorite! There's just something about this that is super addictive to listen to.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): So unbelievably good

**ColsonBakerr** (10): this album was honestly the first time i really listened to Dua and what can I say, it's fucking brilliant

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the way this should’ve been a hit instead of levitating

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember there was a debate on Stan Twitter whether which potential single is better and I am definitely on #TeamHallucinate. Idk why but this song is bringing me back to 2016 when I first listened to Greedy. It's that roller-skater arena vibe that this song has that gives me the urge to start roller-skating.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): manifesting myself listening to this song live next year. dua come to seattle please

**ImADudeDuh** (10): throwback to that fugly animated music video for this song that r/popheads voted as the best animated music video in the popheads VMAs only because it was the only one people ever bothered to watch

**J\_Toe** (10): I wore this song out a little bit by overplaying it, but it's still better than Levitating (in my opinion, of course) I think a different animation style would have suited the music video, as this doesn't strike me as Max Fleischer at all. I also hate that "haaAAAA!" inhale at the beginning.

**jimmy345960** (10): another song by dua that knocks it out of the park. i think she just choose words that she liked and then created SICKING beats behind them and it worked honestly

**lolcevan** (10): perfect song too but less good than levitating imo

**Misentro** (10): Even though I think Levitating is the best song on the album, Hallucinate has been making me dance like nothing else. The energy is off the charts and the animated video is perfect.

**MrSwearword** (10): the best Kylie Minogue song not actually done by Kylie Minogue.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic

**runaway3212** (10): This slays me

**seanderlust** (10): body make you silly https://giphy.com/gifs/animated-dancing-inflatable-12dpLtkNiqc5zO

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Love how she uses a chord progression that you don’t usually get in pop music, I need to see this performed live as soon as possible

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This honestly might be the best song on the album, and it's been done dirty. Every performance of it we've seen though is S tier

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this has slapped since its release

**waluigiest** (10): I don’t care how basic it is, it’s the best club beat on the album and her squeak in the chorus is PERFECT

**wasian-invasion** (10): This is one song that really makes me miss the gay clubs :*(

**ryjomom** (9.9): Where's the LSD babes it's time to go clubbing

**camerinian** (9.5): This is catering directly to MY future nostalgia and I am thriving

**cocosairdep** (9.5): bop

**intheaftermath** (9.5): the video for this song was so underrated... hire more animators!!!!

**1998tweety** (9): shes cute, Dua gets a little too screechy at points but its good

**Awkward\_King** (9): if you dont like hallucinate you're a heterosexual american

**bbfan132** (9): i love how the song immediately starts with this burst of energy and then swells/blows up throughout

**booksandplantsand** (9): the pulsing, driving synth makes this song

**fallenriot** (9): this song was made for festivals, it’s a shame that never came to fruition

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): justice for this banger of a track!!

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9): this was the first time I listened to hallucinate and this was such a shock to the system. I love how airy and poignant this sounds

**nooodisaster** (9): God the first half of this album is just hit after hit.

**skargardin** (9): sg lewis snapped noitstrue noitstrue

**Stryxen** (9): DESERVED BETTER

**vayyiqra** (9): What a bop!

**Iris3271** (8.5): Miss Dua serving up some psychosis solidarity

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Yes it sounds just like a Lady Gaga song; yes that's a good thing

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (8.5): nice instrumentals!

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): in a world where Dua doesn't break out of the UK this gets a Years & Years remix

**relibee2** (8.4): I remember when this was at the bottom of my FN ranking lol.

**aliensexist** (8): Sounds a little like a Madonna Confessions outtake but that isn't necessarily bad

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): SMASH! One of the select few FN tracks that actually didn't benifit from the remix album that much.

**frogaranaman** (8): this is gay bait but it’s kind of fun gay bait

**mayolizard** (8): no clue what to think about this

**pig-serpent** (8): Psychedelic Disco? Sounds like a good time.

**slimboyfriend** (8): To me, it sounds like the clubbier sister song of Levitating

**twistedpython** (8): The "oh my my my, my my my my's" are very catchy but I always hear them and want to go listen to My My My by Troye Sivan, which I usually do

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): There's nothing particularly wrong with this track, but it feels particularly generic to me

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): miss dua serving vocals here

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the songs on this album so far have been mostly solid but outside of the title track they're missing that extra something

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): One of the better songs on the album but I couldn’t listen to it on repeat honestly, the way she sings “IiiIIIiiIIiIIII hallucinate” is just on the edge of being annoying.

**wryn\_** (7.5): i'm gonna need a full on dua lipa / sg lewis collab asap now

**mythicalbeaste** (7): I don't think I'd seek this one out

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): probably aged the worst of any track on the album, Dua's vocals are PAINFUL but the instrumental still slaps

**AHSWeeknd** (6): it’s only okay

**Flegasaurus** (6): this one is kinda fun ig

**Roxieloxie** (6): This is kinda the same thing with physical, I like it more than that one but at the same time when you have the peaks on the album that this has had, this is just sorta meh

**Tedyonce** (6): overrated but a banger nevertheless

**zagreux** (6): I love this song but the chorus feels extremely underwhelming.

**Brendon-Urine** (5): Bassline is really good but I just don't really like the vocals or song in general. Also the music video is... offputting.

**rickikardashian** (4.7): i can deal with her squeaks if the song is very good…. which this definitely isnt

**wavingwolves** (4): is this bad? no, but is it good? also no

**ManofOranges** (3): Honestly, while I think that Boys Will Be Boys is the worst song on the album, this is kind of a close second for me. Because at least while Boys Will Be Boys is bad, it's at least a kind of bad that makes it stick out like a sore thumb. I will never forget Boys Will Be Boys. This song, however, is just so boring. It doesn't absolutely nothing for me when I'm listening to it. My eyes start glazing over when this song comes on.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (2): sounds too much like H&M-core

**hikkaru** (10): Call me a basic bitch all you want but this BOPS, a fantastic collaboration between two of my favourite artists with stellar vocal acrobatics and incredibly fun house production. Ari doing charity work for Gaga and getting this to #1 as well as it becoming an actual hit with a bit of longevity was a moment most pleasing to me, and this is for sure one of my fave hits from last year. I think back to the night this song was released, and it was the very first time I had seen a friend since the initial COVID lockdown occurred - we were having a socially distanced fire and had some drinks but it started to pour rain so we called it a night and I walked home, listening to this on loop since it had just released, and it truly was a moment I'll never forget I think. As a whole this is definitely one of my favourite songs from the past couple years and it's really disappointing to see it fall before the top 10, it deserved better!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Well are you surprised at the placing of this song? Because I am! This should have been a top 10 lock but for some reason some people are just sick of this song, think it’s overplayed and an underwhelming collab ~~ or were purposely trying to tank this song because they thought it would win lmfao~~.  I think it’s great and super fun song and Gaga and Ariana’s vocals are so good. Now if Gaga can collab with The Weeknd, then finally my trifecta collaborations between my 3 favorite pop stars will be complete!

**akanewasright** (8): Uh… yeah, I didn’t expect this to go out before the top 10 either. I think people were a little scared of it beating their actual favorite songs in the rate and underrated it accordingly. This got a 0 or two super early on, but it was back up in the top 10 until the last few weeks. The song isn’t my favorite, but it going out this soon feels like a little bit of a robbery to me.

ignitethephoenix: # love singing in the rain

**nooodisaster** (11): I know this has 0% chance of winning, but this was my song of 2020. 2020 was the worst year in my life. It was one of the worst years for humanity. I don't wanna overshare, but I lost someone that year that I never thought I would at my age. I felt trapped, I felt heartbreak like never before. It felt like the world decided to pile everything on. But this song. This song embraces the pain in an explosion of ecstasy. It's two of my favorite artists telling the world to bring it on, at a time in my life I desperately needed to hear that. "I never asked for the rainfall" is right. But I'm still glad I went through it.

**pheromenos** (11): duh

**teenage\_meme** (11): ariana on the lower harmony is what makes this song for me. they sound so glorious!

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): I bet $100 that people will still be talking about this song in 20 years. Trust me, we'll still be jamming to this shit when we've paid off 5% of our student loan at 45!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): RAIN ON ME TSUNAMI

**astrologicalangel** (10): I was very tempted to give this my 11

**bespectacIed** (10): If it wasn't for the sheer star power of these two dwarf italian girls, this song would have been banished to elevators and Forever 22 fitting rooms forever. Something this generic and basic shouldn't go hard but somehow it does. HOW??? Did they put crack in this?? They must have.

**booksandplantsand** (10): I always forget how good this is but wow truly a Moment in culture

**bulforster** (10): Very kind of Gaga to remind us all how well Ari can do pure pop when she wants to.

**camerinian** (10): Call me basic. Please. It's my kink

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i don’t like seeing twinks happy but i guess i’ll give this a 10 since it does deserve

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): God, I was so pleasantly surprised that Gaga and Ari sounded great together here. I cannot give this song less than a 10. IT'S A CERITIFED BOP.

**Flegasaurus** (10): idk how i feel about this song but my 10 year old little sister loves it so i'm giving it a 10 for her

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): I'D RATHER BE DRUNK BUT AT LEAST I'M ALIVE https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c5/39/63/c53963217001d71b2805c504c85e1041.jpg

**hhiggy** (10): again i don't trust you if you don't like this

**J\_Toe** (10): I think this song deals with a similar sadness and pain as Just Dance and Do What U Want, but where the former capitulate, this song finds resilience and catharsis. Part of this is a result of adding the Ariana collab, finding power and support through women's friendships. The demo is cool too.

**jasannn** (10): My bi ass replayed the shit out of the first week it came out.

**jsonphile** (10): honestly one of my favorite songs of 2020. It just hit the right spot at the right time. A song that goes “I’d rather be dry but at least I’m alive”

**just\_thonking** (10): gay

**ktajlili** (10): Ariana Grande is so perfect in this track

**ManofOranges** (10): Loved this one when it came out, still love it now. They did THAT.

**mayolizard** (10): yass grenade

**Misentro** (10): The Song of Chromatica. An iconic pop girl collab. The vocals, the video, it was all done perfectly.

**MrSwearword** (10): sure it could be like thirty seconds longer but this song is great and with help from Ariana's fans, gave Gaga her fifth #1.

**nootnoot781** (10): i apologise in advance for not underscoring this :/

**outsideeyess** (10): Ariana's vocals runs always get me here

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Now this, THIS is what I wanted from dance-pop Gaga, I love the way Ari and Gaga play off of each other, "RAIN. ON. ME." hits SO good, and it sounds like Stardust released a track in 2020 (which they should)

**ReallyCreative** (10): white gays make some noise [thunderous applause]

**runaway3212** (10): This is a good song, Ariana's and Gaga's work surprisingly well and it really sounds like they're having a lot of fun

**ryjomom** (10): Italians harmonize to make the best food and songs. Collab of the century. If Dua dropped dead this would’ve been my 11.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): BOP

**skargardin** (10): RAIN. ON. ME!!!

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is a bop, people just rag on it because the clubs wern't open last year

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i get why some ppl don't like it but i love it and thats what matters. also the drop that goes into ariana's verse feels like it belongs in a naughties Disney coming of age flick a la the Lizzie McGuire movie

**TiltControls** (10): RAIN. ON. ME. gets this a 10 alone

**vayyiqra** (10): [insert meme about how only twinks like this song even though I'm 32 years old and not even gay] This is a great pop song though, and I loved the video, and I'm glad it won its Grammy.

**wasian-invasion** (10): I was initially a bit underwhelmed on first listen but damn that music video got me. Every time they play off eachother it's pure pop perfection

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): Blasting this in your room and dancing around one of the best experiences.

**xxrandooxx** (10): residents of the sahara desert have been real quiet since this song was released.

**zagreux** (10): yes, I am gay.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): This is such a feel-good bop, Gaga brings the pep and Ariana brings the comforting energy I needed in early pandemic times. I don’t care if I’m basic for loving this. RAIN. ON. ME.

**KennyEarthman** (9.5): I would give 10 to the Barbie Girl x Rain on Me mashup

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Yes, I'm a basic white gay, what about it?

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): Frankie Grande was too busy to collab so Gaga had to call up his sister instead

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): The “I hear the thunder coming down, won’t you rain on me-eh-yeah” bit really elevates this song

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): Cum. On. Me.

**NFLfreak98** (9.3): Considering this and Sour Candy are some of the best songs here I have decided that Gaga should collab more

**cremeebrulee** (9): pretty great collaboration between the two tbh! i adore the MV and the rain. on. me. part i just hope this isn’t gaga’s highest placest song

**followingfreeways** (9): i honestly just love this song and i think their voices go sooo well together!! the melody of the chorus is everything

**frogaranaman** (9): okay which [gay slur word] is going to give a dissertation over this song about how it’s a great marvel and feat and which [gay slur word] is going to respond to it by saying “this sucks lmao” because I want those two responses to be RIGHT under my comment in the reveal comment

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): italians helping italians, we love to see it

**jimmy345960** (9): gay icon status

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (9): I have nothing to add besides every time I listen to this while on my bike it ends up raining on me at some point in the ride, and yet I still play it. It's that darn good.

**moooo566** (9): This one took a lot of time to grow on me but it's one of my favourites now.

**mysario** (9): I thought I wouldn't like this song by now yet it still slaps

**mythicalbeaste** (9): if you listen to this song you're part of the lgbtq

**Parabox314** (9): vegas lemme hear ya'll make some noise!

**rslashpoopheads** (9): ariana eated this

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I would say the people I work with found out I was gay when I had to explain to them that the lyrics weren’t “I’d rather be drunk” but they definitely knew before that

**TragicKingdom1** (9): im gay

**bbfan132** (8.5): total bop, ariana sounds great here

**bluepupz** (8.5): One of my dream collabs. I thought they both did well, and I like how their voices sound together. The Weather Channel promo for this was an interesting choice!

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): this song deserved a better summer

**rickikardashian** (8.5): i forced myself to like this more

**vagenda** (8.3): This song singlehandedly revived the Chromatica era a week before the album drop and that’s called power

**CrimsonROSET** (8): something something ARMY scare please don’t doxx me

**musical\_pyn** (8): Ariana and Gaga have really great chemistry. The best part is easily the beginning of the bridge.

**seanderlust** (8): RAIN. ON. ME.

**TheCatApologist** (8): My most played song of 2020 but I can no longer remember why

**thePotatofairyy** (8): They sound great, the producing is great. I did not expect Gagas low vocals to be the earworms of a GagaxAriana song but they really are the highlight

**waluigiest** (8): Vegas lemme hear you scream!!!!

**aliensexist** (7.5): I wanted it to be more epic

**fallenriot** (7.5): ugh italianx queens

**Iris3271** (7.5): Ariana gave a pretty good performance

**mms82** (7.5): shame it came out when we couldn’t listen to this in the clubs

**wailord\_fan** (7.5): Grew a bit on me, but I find Gaga is kinda... over singing? Her vocal tone has changed a lot between Artpop/Joanne to Chromatica, and almost feels like a character, almost like she took 'Ally' from ASIB and tried to channel her delivery for the character into her own tracks as Lady Gaga.

**hielord** (7.3): omg queens of precipitation

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): I am absolutely blaming Ricki for my low score of this song because I cant listen to this without thinking of the fucking ******* ***** video and him attempting to sing his heart out to this

**whyishestaring** (7.3): would've been lower, but additional points bc of ariana

ignitethephoenix: # drowning

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): I think as a collab of two pop stars of their caliber this was somewhat underwhelming but it's still a fun and catchy song nonetheless.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7): It's okay. Not amazing, not horrible.

**fishingfor8** (7): the overplay actually made me more favorable to this jumping from a 6 (fine) to a 7 (good I guess)

**pig-serpent** (7): This song would be so good if it hit like the 90s songs that inspired it.

**twistedpython** (7): This song feels like the beginning of the Italian-American Combined Cinematic Universe

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): this song was made for a flash mob in an h&m in a decrepit small town mall

**jexan13** (6.5): Not even top 20 of either artist's discography

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): this just feels like a hate crime waiting to happen

**wavingwolves** (6): i gave it a bonus point for the RAIN. ON. ME. TSUNAMI. part because it gives me a rush

**brenda\_official** (5): embarrassing circuit gays ruined this for me sorry

**ColsonBakerr** (5): sorry gaga, sorry ari but God help me this was BAD

**plastichaxan** (3): me @ twinks: shut up about rain on me shut up about rain on me

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (3): God this is such a stupid song, why is no one acknowledging this? Is everybody afraid of the wrath of arianators?

**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): to have two of the biggest, most exciting popstars collab and it to turn into this...disappointing. it's just so underwhelming. also AJayII was right that this would be better as just ariana.

**joeeswift** (1): possibly the most generic pop song I’ve ever heard. I was so hyped for this collab with 2 of my favourite artists and it disappointed me beyond words

**Stryxen** (1): anywhere but here this would be a 7

**Hogwartsreject1912** (0): This is quite possibly my least favorite song of the year. If this was two artists who weren't huge names y'all would be dragging it to FILTH.

**akanewasright** (10): Choosing between this and Blinding Lights for my 11 was way more difficult than it should have been. While the former is generally a perfect song in my eyes, this finds its brilliance elsewhere. First of all - *that beat*. The giant shift a minute or two into the song feels like a perfect callback to his mixtape era (among many lyrical callbacks throughout the song). But also… this song is the perfect climax for the album. After a series of brash pop tracks and intense R&B, it ends with this sleazy sleazy beat and a frightened whisper. This song was so fucking close to the top 10 that it hurts. Even though #11 is a great placement for a song like this, it still sucks to see it go when it didn’t have to.

**hikkaru** (10): This is such an amazing track, oh my god. The drop is just IMMACULATE, I could listen to this over and over again and just go absolutely feral when the drums kick in each time. It's just so incredibly well crafted and I'm so grateful that y'all saw greatness in this as well and got it this high up despite it not being a full single and also being very long. For sure one of his best songs across all albums, and a definite 11 contender for me here in this rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A fan favorite track, this is another highlight on the album. A longer song, this track somehow doesn’t stretch the full 5 minutes to me. It’s very cinematic from the start to finishing, and I think has some of the best production. Although I think some users found the beginning a snooze fest, the second half of the song once the beat kicks in makes it on of the top tracks here but not the cream of the crop (and that kick in of the beat is amazing).

ignitethephoenix: # love those late night vibes

**Alumineous** (11): When I first heard this, it felt like a callback to pre-BBTM Abel. It felt like a return to form. And truly, this is Abel at his best. Gorgeous vocals sung entirely in falsetto and mixed voice. The bridge where he says, "I know it's all my fault" is like a spotlight pointing at him. Like, he actually MEANS IT. For a six minute song, I wanted it to be longer. Phenomenal song.

**booksandplantsand** (11): this is it. this is thee song of thee album of this rate. main pop boy

**bulforster** (11): It's extremely satisfying when an album's longest song is also it's best, even better when it has stiff competition from most of the previous six tracks.

**ColsonBakerr** (11): no doubt about it I can't even express in words what this song is... just perfection

**Iris3271** (11): Top 3 song by him and one of my most played of 2020

**oscarbrierley1** (11): one of the best songs from 2020, really creates a vibe

**Parabox314** (11): the crackles?? holy fuck this song is still so incredible.

**thedoctordances1940** (11): abel pls make an album full of songs like this and house of balloons

**AHSWeeknd** (10): my fave song of 2020

**Awkward\_King** (10): was this made a single i forget but honestly even being six minutes this could be a single

**bbfan132** (10): puts me into a trance whenever i listen to it

**bespectacIed** (10): The excellence of this song, far too much

**bluepupz** (10): The introduction of the beat at minute 2:12 is everything. My favorite track on the album, and I appreciate how long it is. I don't exactly know what it is about this song, but it's great!

**brenda\_official** (10): ‘i want to share babies, protection we won’t need’ lol

**celladonn** (10): Flawless multi-part dark banger. The swirling production is otherworldly

**cremeebrulee** (10): i wish i had a second 11 so bad (i remember streaming this on loop on release day because i wanted to keep hear that beat switch over and over) i hope this does well, preferably somewhere in the top 10 bc it deserves!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Song of the year. After Hours would have been my 11 if it had any chance at winning over Dua or Blinding Lights. The absolute best song in this rate, ignoring that "I wanna share babies" moment. The intro, the transition, the harrowing ticking synth throughout the rest of the song, the IMMACULATE beat with the perfect drop to start it off, the sorrowful outro... Perfection that deserves the best.

**fishingfor8** (10): I predict this will be used for the end credits in a future movie

**Flegasaurus** (10): i was going back and forth on whether i should give my 11 to this or heartless, this song blows my mind every time

**frogaranaman** (10): the fact that there are multiple 11s on this album is absolutely incredible. this song also completely defined five AM walk homes from the bars when I was studying in Madrid. I would always be the last one to walk home amongst my friends (only man and I look very Spanish, so I wasn’t worried about getting home compared to my friends who looked very Foreign) and I would always just pull up this song and fucking vibe as I walked the mile and some home back southeast towards Moncloa 

 god, I miss that city so bad

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): dua take note, the song the album is named after doesn't need to be bad

**ImADudeDuh** (10): hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo man this is good

**jimmy345960** (10): I am CAPTIVATED by this six minute long masterpiece. Time flies when this song is on.

**jledzz** (10): love the progression on this song

**KennyEarthman** (10): it's nice to see a long song in the streaming age

**mayolizard** (10): this is a real jaw dropper

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is better than blinding lights

**nooodisaster** (10): No idea how he does it, but his longest song on this album are the ones that go by the fastest. When this was done, I was ready for 5 minutes more.

**nootnoot781** (10): CMV the beat drop in this song is more satisyfing than the chromatica ii/911 switch

**pat-rickstar** (10): This is how you make a 6 minute long song and keep it interesting all the way through. Escape From LA wishes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This nails the feeling of spiralling into despair after a sleepless night at the club.

**seanderlust** (10): wait, am I crazy? is this not a sample of the XX?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): an incredible journey from start to finish

**twistedpython** (10): It's a basic take I know but the way that the instruments build throughout this song is like earcrack in my opinion. Absolute perfection

**wavingwolves** (10): i hate this is not the album's closer

**wryn\_** (10): such an amazing artistic statement in the way it blends his old style and the new, cinematic, depressing, a masterpiece, best song on the album etc etc

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): The chorus of this reminds me alot of the hills

**camerinian** (9.5): This is just such a great distillation of everything I wanted from this album. Moody, introspective, and fucking groovy as hell. I wanted an album to have late night sadboi drives to and I got it at least on this track

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): the fact that this song is six minutes long and I wish it was longer...

**MrMoodle** (9.5): This is like one of three 6+ minute songs that doesn’t make me want to shoot myself in the face out of boredom so that’s good

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Objectively the better of the two title tracks in the rate, it manages to feel like it isn’t 6 minutes long

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): one time I listened to this high and got so spooked out I had to stop

**fallenriot** (9): another 6 minute song, and i love to see it, but i feel like he took some notes from ariana on the diction here

**Misentro** (9): Mindblowing production.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): I like how different this sounds, yet it's still got cohesion with the rest of the album. Does it count as a grower if your score rises by two whole points over the duration of the song?

**ReallyCreative** (9): when the drums come in, a moment!

**WhyDidEverIBother** (9): The real ending of the album, everything else should have been left on the cutting floor.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is not something I would listen to on repeat very often, but this song is so good in the context of the album that I can't skip this one. I mean, that beat is just so gorgeous. This song might grow on me the more I listen to it.

**hielord** (8.5): The best song among the non-singles

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8.5): Along with Blinding Lights this is the kind of energy I wish this entire record had. Something about this song just grabs me and doesn't let me go.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): this kinda eated

**team\_kockroach** (8.3): Abel doesn’t deserve a beat this good

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.2): Production slaps, but the first part kind of drags.

**2dina3dworld** (8): a breather song, and a welcome one at that.

**jasannn** (8): that beat switch tho

**pig-serpent** (8): The slow burn song to put the rest of the slow burns to shame.

**slimboyfriend** (8): The rest of the album is forgettable but this song is GOOD.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Instrumental really does the work here of communicating the pain of the lyrics

**Stryxen** (8): this is what a 6 minute song should sound like

**vayyiqra** (8): Some vibes while Abel here hows some insight into how his toxic fuckboy persona is in reality not good for him or anyone.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): the drums entering is a serve

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): the weakest single dont @ me

ignitethephoenix: # I'm an early bird

**1998tweety** (7): this is kinda all over the place, bits I don't care for and bits I like a lot so imma slap a 7 on it

**SmileAndTears** (7): The beat only kicking in 2 minutes into the song was certainly a choice. The first part of the song is quite boring but the rest is good

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): the production, again, is so good

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): Not a fan of the overdrawn intro to this, but once it gets going, it's super solid

**mythicalbeaste** (6): no real opinions

**sirpancakeXI** (6): this is so bland and long for no reason

**J\_Toe** (5): not really what I personally like to listen to, sorry :/ it's well made though, and I like the rest of the album

**Tedyonce** (5): he sounds like he’s singing this with his mouth barely open lol

**MrSwearword** (4): cut the first two minutes of the song and we'd have a good song on our hands

**ryjomom** (4): I don’t have the attention span for 6 minutes of a song like this.

**xxrandooxx** (2.5): Girl i need some versatility

**akanewasright** (10): This is by far and away my favorite song on the album, and (I think) the closest Gaga got on this album to fulfilling her artistic goal of creating dance tracks out of pain. The video, although I find it the tiniest bit heavy handed, is one of my favorites that Gaga has ever done, and it does nothing but enhance the meaning that was already in the lyrics. A few people *really* do not like this song sonically, but I think it’s absolutely top tier. This is the closest thing to a perfect song on Chromatica, and I love it with all of my gay little heart.

**hikkaru** (10): And so Gaga takes the fall... just barely making it into the top 10 of the rate. If we hadn't done charity work for Gaga and combined the interludes with the songs that come after them, I don't think this would have made it here at all, actually. The transition from Chromatica II to 911 is for sure a highlight of the album and spawned many memes, and I personally love it as well. This is a track I initially had my eye on when the tracklisting was revealed because Madeon worked on it and I love his work, but 911 actually ended up being more of a grower for me? I do like it a lot but I think if it were up to me Gaga's top song would be Rain on Me, Babylon, or Sour Candy. Regardless, it is here where Gaga gets the chop - sorry little monsters!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): My favorite song on the album, I’m very happy this got a music video and got the attention it deserved (from the fans). I love the robotic tone of the song and the overall vibe of the song. It’s one of the most interesting things gaga has done and the transition from Chromatica II to this song is an album highlight.

ignitethephoenix: # something something the greatest transition of all time

**bluepupz** (11): I highly doubt my 11 is going to win but a girl can dream am I right? I love the iconic transition from the interlude just as much as everyone else does. I also think this is one of her songs where the robotic, kinda monotone effect on her voice works well. I'm glad it finally got an MV in the end.

**rosecult** (11): wig!

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): transition something something

**AHSWeeknd** (10): everything about this is absolute perfection.

**aliensexist** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique etc etc Simply perfection. I'm going to play it at my funeral so that the transition starts just as I am cremated

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck u niki <3

**bespectacIed** (10): Not that every Gaga song has to be serious to be good, but I love how 911 is a dive through Gaga's mental health laid out on some actually interesting and fun production. This is the type of material that befits Gaga's pop icon status

**booksandplantsand** (10): yes MAAM

**CHRMbishop** (10): LIKE A KICK TO THE FACE HOLY SHIT

**cocosairdep** (10): Best song on this album by a mile. Iconic transition.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): After watching WandaVision, I can't help but feel like 911 is such a perfect song for Wanda Maximoff because the lyrics really suit her so perfectly. Also, the music video is so similar to WandaVision in terms of the concept >!of using your favorite film/TV show to process grief and trauma.!<

**fallenriot** (10): super happy this is gonna be one of the many comments that mentions how amazing the transition is

**followingfreeways** (10): the music video for this REALLY added on to the experience of this song. it's so so good

**frogaranaman** (10): Madeon is the king of transitions and for that reason this transition is like mid tier in his discography

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): i like the song but im giving it this score just for the transition, that's how impactful it was

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Again, so hard not giving this my 11. The transition, the lyrics, the vocal effects... can you say ICONIC?

**intheaftermath** (10): All of this is so amazing. Undeniably my favorite video of the year; this song and music video combined was an experience, y'know?

**Iris3271** (10): The transition is impeccable and the song has been stuck in my head for days

**J\_Toe** (10): this is honestly Gaga's most personal album yet. More personal than Born This Way even. Great track and God-tier music video. Though it makes me think of Dylan Will Not Participate, because he always hated Gaga's robot speak singing voice.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): stunning

**jimmy345960** (10): wow iconic

**jledzz** (10): should have been the intro to the album

**Misentro** (10): 911 was sort of forgettable after the Chromatica II transition, but the video really elevated it to one of my favourites.

**moooo566** (10): Her voice sounds especially good here imo. Mostly this comment is here to say that the video is great, and you should watch The Fall (2006), also directed by Tarsem Singh, which is like this aesthetic but even brighter and more striking, and an entire film long.

**musical\_pyn** (10): 911 alone is an 8 but chromatica II gives it a boost to the 10

**mythicalbeaste** (10): for the transition alone

**pat-rickstar** (10): Chromatica 10 / 910

**pig-serpent** (10): Main pop girls and messing up the single rollout for the best song on their albums, name a more iconic duo. (Madeon should've produced this whole album)

**rickikardashian** (10): …..maybe my biggest enemy IS me

**seanderlust** (10): is this as good as the memes make it out to be? no. am I giving this a 10 because it was on a playlist that took me out of a full-tilt mental breakdown this past summer? yes.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I think the outro might be my favorite part

**sirpancakeXI** (10): The transition remains iconic. If we ignore the interlude, it is still one of the best song in this album

**skargardin** (10): bitch it's the serve

**thePotatofairyy** (10): The transition. Not a lyric guy but its damn cool seeing a pop song about a topic like this.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): excellent

**vayyiqra** (10): Really hits if you've ever taken medication for anything, which I have, lots.

**waluigiest** (10): everyone remembers where they were the first time they heard this transition

**wavingwolves** (10): like a jewel in the garbage

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): Without Chromatica II I would've given 911 something like an 8.5 or something, but the anticipation for the drop is enough to raise this to a 10!

**zagreux** (10): This song is THAT bitch. The transition alone deserves a 10.

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): I dont really care for the video but hearing it with this interlude is really amazing. Heres the thing, this is probably the most memorable song on this album. all the other ones blend into each other and sorta feel like the same thing. This one does as well in a way but at least its the best one of it

**camerinian** (9.5): Can't wait for Meme Rate II: Chromatic Boogaloo

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): I LOVE THE ORCHESTRA on the interludes. it really makes this feel like a piece. as for 911; I love the robotic ass voice. I feel like it is a bit more successful in the futuristic house sound without the lyrics being cringe

**KennyEarthman** (9.5): sure, the transition is perfect but 911 is too boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): good decision to rate them together as the interlude really elevates 911 imo

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this would kinda be lower with the transition but it’s really good either way, the first good song this album

**kwcty6888** (9.2): this score is being hard carried by Chromatica II

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.1): 1 (yes i tried to be cute <3)

**ImADudeDuh** (9.1): my biggest enemy is actually capitalism but I feel you

**mayolizard** (9.1): yass grenade

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.1): This grew off me a bit, I fear. I put it in my top songs of 2020 list at the end of the year, but now, I would replace it with Replay. Still very impactful.

**xxrandooxx** (9.1): This shit catchy as hell and don’t even get me started with the music video.

**cremeebrulee** (9): overrated

**Flegasaurus** (9): BANGER??? can't see me croiiii can't see me croiiiii this is the end

**NotWith10000Men** (9): that TRANSITION. I usually don't like repetition but it works in this chorus. and the "please patch the line" is gorg

**relibee2** (9): transition is overrated as fuck tbh.

**slimboyfriend** (9): Adding half a point for including Chromatica II

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): the effects on her voice during the verses are SO good

**Stryxen** (8.6): me calling the police on r/popheads after another ariana grande thinkpiece

**ColsonBakerr** (8.5): this song will get stuck in your head for DAYS

**jasannn** (8.5): The first verse is incredible but the rest of the song doesn't live up to its potential.

**just\_thonking** (8.5): the song itself is an 8 but the transition is a 10

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): It’s a good song but y’all need to shut up about the transition.

**ryjomom** (8.5): Hillary Clinton would have been inaugurated for her second term to the transition of Chromatica II into 911 after unveiling her police reformation policy to patch the line.

**twistedpython** (8.5): The immaculate transition and the video save this song, 911 on its own would be a 4.5 without them

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): queen of transitions! Abigail thorne could never

**hielord** (8.3): the transition? iconic, and the fact that I started liking this song when the MV was released because it fitted the song so well

**2dina3dworld** (8.2): I thought this was about something else... Oop

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8): This song is saved by the interlude. I think if it was just 911 I'd probably be giving it a 5. That build up into the track really does it for me.

**nooodisaster** (8): The transition? 11. I hope I'm not destroying Gaga's chances to win, but I never attached to this song the way most stans did. Like, it's still good and a bop, and really well produced. I just don't personally connect.

**ReallyCreative** (8): carried SO hard by the Chromatica II intro its not even funny. 911 is a bit better than more mediocre tracks on Chromatica but it still doesn't do anything without that intro

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): chromatica II is gorgeous and the song is a nice "i hate myself but make it a banger"

**veryanniev** (8): But the transition alone is absolutely a 10

**wailord\_fan** (8): Combining these two is going to lead to a higher score for this than Rain on Me.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.5): Aside from the memeability of the transition, solidly middle of the pack. But that TRANSITION IS UNBELIEVABLE.

**ChandelierFlickering** (7.5): one of those songs where I love parts but other parts bug me

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): First things first, the transition: it’s good, but GOD have people overhyped it. I feel the same way about the song, but then there are seven different things thrown in that don’t fit at all, including the anti-drop.

**TiltControls** (7.5): wait this isn't kylie

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): Chromatica II -> Can't Get You Out of My Head was the BEST transition meme to come out of this. As for 911… it's a song that the Music Video made me appreciate more, but I still think it's pretty boring. The whole track kind of feels like it doesn't really go anywhere, the chorus is REALLY lackluster, and it feels so close to being a highlight, but falls a little short (Side note: I HATE that the last little burst of Chromatica II still plays at the intro of 911, even as a track on its own, it's so loud, jarring and annoying to play in shuffle mode)

ignitethephoenix: # my biggest enemy is me

**bbfan132** (7): i didn’t like this at all for a while but it’s grown on me recently… not in love or anything but i like the robotic sound of it

**MrSwearword** (7): yes the transition from interlude to song is stellar. "911" itself is useless even with Gaga's ear for melody in "my biggest enemy is me". It scores this high because all three remixes outclass "911" in every way imaginable.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Chromatica II - good. The transition - great. 911 - boring and flat

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): if it wasn't for the transition this would be kind of boring

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): i feel like i only like the meme of the interlude fade in otherwise this song is a nonevent

**CarlieScion** (6): the transition is fun but neither the interlude or the song is that Great on its own

**lillipup03** (6): omg when’s the Halsey remix?

**ManofOranges** (6): Honestly 911 is one of the more mediocre songs on this album. It's very middle of the road to me.

**runaway3212** (6): I like the transition way too much, but I think 911 itself is a bit boring

**wryn\_** (6): is it just my cheap ass headphones or is that kick drum about 10 times louder than it should be

**givebackmysweatshirt** (5.5): i like the idea of this song more than the actual song. like people praise it on popheads and i'm like yeah i love that song. then, i listen to it and i'm like yeah ok enough of that. the transition is good though.

**alwayswords** (5): the transition from chromatica II to 911 saved this score

**LesApfels** (5): The transition is extremely overrated

**lolcevan** (5): i was briefly tempted to rate it higher for the transition alone but i think it’s a fair score for a below average song and an interlude

**mms82** (5): the transition is fantastic and TikTok made great use of it, can’t say I love either song outside of those 10 seconds though

**Bajuko** (4.5): I didn’t really like how her voice sounded here, and I couldn’t get over the fact that it sounds like “Papa 911”

**SmileAndTears** (3.5): I was originally gonna give this my 0 but the track does have some redeeming qualities. I hate 911 and I couldn’t care less about the transition. The chorus is the most monotonous shit I’ve ever heard and it kills any potential the song had for me (which is a shame cuz I do like the pre chorus).

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Is the clown r/popheads for thinking this is good or me for believing them?

**bulforster** (2): I get that the lyrics are about some real shit but the production is way too goofy for me to get past to empathise.

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): GOING FROM A STRING SECTION TO A BEAT DROP IS NOT REVOLUTIONARY!!! This transition shouldn't be carried by Kylie Minogue's international multi-platinum hit Can't Get You Out Of My Head, and yet it is! 911's "inner saboteur" message is cute and relatable, but it's not enough to justify the song being a one-note snooze-fest that peaks at 0:00.

**NFLfreak98** (0): This is what happens when the synths sound bad in a song that is only synths

**shhhneak** (0): Chromatica II into 911 memes aren't a personality trait.

**hikkaru** (10): I think I like the other singles from Future Nostalgia just a tad more but I'm still giving this a 10, so... This managing to actually be a hit alongside the album's drop was super satisfying after Physical made no noise in North America, and really proved that Dua is Main Pop Girl material on the charts. Now, if only she was also a Main Covid Prevention Girl too, and followed her own advice to stay at home...

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favorites from the album, I’m glad it was a hit! I love the guitar riff in the chorus from Need You Tonight by INXS (please check that out if you haven’t) and it’s irresistible catchy.

**akanewasright** (7.7): This song was *barely* in the top 10 for the longest time. This song aged interestingly for me, in that I still like it a lot, but it also feels a little outclassed by a lot of the rest of the record. I do think that it uses its sample/interpolation incredibly well, and that its nice to see it in the top 10 ~~although I do wish another Gaga song was in here (or higher up) for balance’s sake at least~~

ignitethephoenix: # stayed at home and adhered to covid protocols

**moooo566** (11): breaks my heart not to give my 11 to Taylor, but everything about this song is perfect. The muffled beat in the opening, and the bit where the instrumental drops and I get to drum along with my fingers on the desk like I'm not supposed to be working, are particular highlights, but honestly it's all great.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): would’ve gotten my eleven if it weren’t for After Hours or Chromatica

**bespectacIed** (10): Lyrics that aged like milk lmaooo. It's so funny hearing THAT line. Regardless, a stunning pop song. I still go feral when that double chorus switcheroo comes in. Well that was a wrap, this is THE final song, that was a really great album dua!

**Brendon-Urine** (10): By the time this came out I was fully sold on Dua Lipa. It shouldn't be legal to release a masterpiece like Physical and follow it up with another banger of this quality.

**J\_Toe** (10): I like the INXS sample. This video has a cute concept that reminds me of Janet Jackson's All For You era.

**jledzz** (10): my fav music video of the album for sure

**just\_thonking** (10): The album should've just ended here

**lillipup03** (10): Yeah Dua, you really should’ve stayed at home.

**ManofOranges** (10): Serving Another One Bites the Dust with the bass line, in some odd kind of way.

**MrSwearword** (10): I can't risk underscoring this one [even if I feel the prechorus isn't delivered as strong as it could be] so I'll just remind the RPDR gays how Symone fucking owned that song.

**nootnoot781** (10): something something i should’ve stayed at home

**plastichaxan** (10): if only she listened to her own advice people wouldn't call her superspreader

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It's insane just how many lyrics in this song can be turned into Dua memes

**rickikardashian** (10): is this just Charlie Puth’s How Long repackaged with female vocals and [lyrics that aged like milk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiAfQsoAb08)? Yes, but I love How Long, so I loved this too

**ryjomom** (10): Definitely, I thought it was fun… I like the beat

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I always breathe in along with her when the music stops during the first chorus I hope I’m not the only one who does this

**skargardin** (10): the smashes won't stop coming

**slimboyfriend** (10): Y'all need to give this song more attention! It's quirky enough to sample INXS but modern enough to come off as effortless cool disco. And it has one of the best music videos of 2020.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The INXS interpolation slaps

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): another song where the best description is "this slaps"

**team\_kockroach** (9.7): Great use of the baseline from "another one bites the dust"

**cocosairdep** (9.5): Self aware queen

**mms82** (9.5): shame this was the single that missed in the US, it’s a bop

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): The mashup on Youtube of this, Greedy by Ariana, and Say So by Doja is an 11 though

**thePotatofairyy** (9.5): That prechorus just makes me feel things. Its sounds ethereal. Chorus grew on me tremendously but that prechorus is the star for me.

**TiltControls** (9.5): Yeah you probably should have stayed at home Dua

**vagenda** (9.5): The way the second half of the chorus kicks in with that “Oh no” and string hit…that’s my religion

**1998tweety** (9): cute lil bop

**aliensexist** (9): Should have stayed at home huh? insert so what is the truth Oprah meme

**booksandplantsand** (9): and another masterful sample yayyyy

**cremeebrulee** (9): good choice for a single / amazing video but as a song itself it’s not quite physical/dsn/levitating tier for me

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I like to think of this one as the prequel to New Rules.

**jasannn** (9): Let's take Charlie Puth's "How Long" and make it better.

**KennyEarthman** (9): the way I searched up "dua lipa stay at home" when I first heard this song

**mythicalbeaste** (9): nice

**nooodisaster** (9): i should have stayed at home

**ReallyCreative** (9): maybe if she followed her own advice

**rslashpoopheads** (9): absolute god tier prechorus but the chorus is kind of a letdown

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): obligatory should have stayed at home joke

**twistedpython** (9): One of the best usages of a sample in a pop song this year

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.7): Pre-chorus sounds too much like Hallucinate but the rest is great

**camerinian** (8.5): ok the song is great but how the fuck was the INXS interpolation "accidental"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Something something about Dua should've stayed at home something something because of COVID yada yada. I just know people will leave comments like this.

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): Yes Dua, you should’ve stayed at home.

**xxrandooxx** (8.5): covid theme song also Symone and Olivia Lux reinvented this song

**seanderlust** (8.4): me trying to think of a shitpost to make here that isn't a "should have stayed at home" joke: https://funvizeo.com/media/memes/41e06ffb9d06ad0c/no-thoughts-brain-scram-eqg-meme-cac4a8e900af435a-86d1e0fb4ba0c207.jpg

**2dina3dworld** (8): that one song in my playlist that I put just for some good background music.

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): You say my name like i have never heard befo- DULA PEEP

**DaHumanTorch** (8): insert covid joke about how dua didn’t stay at home here

**hielord** (8): but did Symone and Olivia actually deliver?

**pig-serpent** (8): The chorus of this song is excellent, but unlike other songs on this album it really only has that one fantastic moment, as opposed to haveing at least 2 or 3.

**runaway3212** (8): Yes dua you should've stayed at home

**vayyiqra** (8): Like "Love Again" it's built around a melody from a classic song so it's hard to hate it.

**waluigiest** (8): it’s a tight pop song but I don’t have much else to say

**wasian-invasion** (8): V catchy but idk something's not clicking. stay at home pls dua

**wavingwolves** (8): i will admit the mv made me like the song a lot more than i initially did

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): I’ll be honest i forget this song was on the album half the time I think about it. Good though

**bbfan132** (7.5): i like how the bass line from need you tonight was used here but some other parts of the production feel a bit too glossy/distracting for me… still a good track

**ColsonBakerr** (7.5): i just... don't like it

**Flegasaurus** (7.5): dua lipa really should have stayed at home

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7.5): Come over here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrZZfaDp02o

**Stryxen** (7.5): very cute bop

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): a bit of a shrinker

# let me throw a party in a pandemic

**bluepupz** (7): I can't pick any specific element that makes me like the song but I find it enjoyable. I do find it kind of ironically funny whenever she sings about staying at home though LOL.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The name's Symone and I'm here for the throne!

**musical\_pyn** (7): eh aside from the chorus it's just fine

**fallenriot** (6.5): a mediocre and forgettable bop, but a bop nonetheless

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): she. should’ve. stayed. at. home.

**Iris3271** (6.5): I don't really care for the chorus, too long

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): filler

**SmileAndTears** (6.2): Dua uses a lot of samples on this album but here it feels like she isn’t making the best use of the INXS sample. It makes the song very catchy but it’s pretty much all it has going for it.

**fishingfor8** (6): she songs with the bassline in the chorus and it bothers the hell out of me

**frogaranaman** (6): “I should have stayed at home” well bitch clearly you aren’t doing that anyways!!!!!!!

**givebackmysweatshirt** (6): i remember wondering how this song had so much radio push and playlisting until dua was named in the payola scandal right in the middle when this song was blowing up lmao ope

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): kinda a snooze now

**sirpancakeXI** (6): it is not a single material if we are being honest. And miss dua please stay at home

**jimmy345960** (5): i have a confession, didn't like this song that much when it came and i hated it more when it got overplayed.

**Roxieloxie** (5): I havent gotten to folklore yet so i could be wrong but this is absolutely one of the songs thats aged the worst in this rate

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): One of the most forgettable pop songs of 2020.

**Tedyonce** (3): holy SHIT this is overrated, Charlie Puth c-side soundin ass

**akanewasright** (10): And so Taylor loses another track. I’m glad that this song placed as high as it did, even though I personally think it could have gone a little higher, but I’m glad that one of the most interesting, distinct songs on the record was well liked enough to go this far. I love Justin’s voice on the track, I love his chemistry with Taylor, and I’m glad that they teamed back up on evermore.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorites from the album, this song kills it on all fronts; lyrically, sonically and production wise. Justin Vernon and Taylor’s voices go really well together and they duet in such a satisfying way. I wish more songs on the album were like this because so much of this album falls flat for me even though they are paced similarly to this.

**hikkaru** (9): This, along with august, I think are the two main fan faves from folklore, so I'm not surprised to see them take the top two Taylor spots. I've removed a point here just because I am a little bit offput by Bon Iver's super deep vocals (scary) but the melodies and how he and Taylor work together on this song are truly fantastic, I totally see why this is a fan fave.

ignitethephoenix: # we love men for this one song

**followingfreeways** (11): i debated for so so so long about what to give me 11 to but ultimately it had to be this song. this is the best song on folklore and one of my favorite tracks she's ever released. the piano line, the lyricism, the harmonies, the melody...it's just a perfect song. Bon Iver is a treasure on this and i can't get over how their voices interact. it's just everything

**lillipup03** (11): The contrast between Justin and Taylor’s voices and lyrics in the bridge is just... it’s so beautiful. I don’t really have words to describe how much I love it.

**shhhneak** (11): The Cruel Summer Award for Most Deserving of a Music Video. The back and forth between Bon Iver and Taylor is so theatrical. I can perfectly visualize it on a theatre stage.

**TiltControls** (11): on of my favourite songs from last year and really one of my faves from each of them. Bon Iver especially needs to use his lower register more as that's what completely sold me on the song here. I'm not sure if Taylor will ever top this song honestly

**1998tweety** (10): excellence

**2dina3dworld** (10): I used to think that the "you're not my homeland anymore" lyric was "you're not my homie anymore", and in the context of being in metaphorical exile, "homeland" makes so much more sense.

**Alumineous** (10): I listened to Folklore for the first time for this rate. This is an excellently crafted song. Might I even say it's perfect. It's just relatable, poignant, and powerful. And beautifully written!

**camerinian** (10): who fucking knew Bon Iver could sing like that???? I've only ever heard him do some wimpy ass falsetto on his own stuff, but that baritone makes me fucking quiver oh my god. Taylor is Taylor, but they play off each other so well that it doesn't really matter. This is a devastating song and it's so impeccably done

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): gorgeous collab

**ColsonBakerr** (10): if justin vernon sings this to me live i'll die happily in that moment and the whole conversation and talking over each other bit is mindblowing

**cremeebrulee** (10): deserves to be taylor’s highest peaking song in this rate.. the back and forth is so good

**CrimsonROSET** (10): What we’re NOT going to do is pretend this isn’t the best song on the album.

**deadline4mymemories** (10): first Bon Iver song I've liked

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Exile felt like a spiritual sequel to "The Last Time" from Red and I love both songs for this concept. Justin Vernon and Taylor sounded really great together and their contrasting vocal styles really gave this song an emotional depth in their conflict.

**fallenriot** (10): his voice startled me when he was the one to come in first, but this is a beautiful duet. taylor do the same with your female collaborators challenge

**fishingfor8** (10): "I think I've seen this film before, and I didn't like ending" has been replaying in my mind all year.

**frogaranaman** (10): I was bored one day and used this audio 15 times in a row on Tiktok and gained like 250 followers from it. anyways this song is Good

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Oof, this song is actually pretty sad :( also "I think i've seen this film before" me with the third act of every hollywood movie

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): SO MANY TIMES so many times so many times SO MANY TIMES

**Iris3271** (10): I've been crying to this for 7 months now

**jsonphile** (10): Okay I’m a slut for piano ballads AND duets so of course I’ll love this song

**ManofOranges** (10): This one's a grower. I don't really give a shit about Bon Iver but there's something about

**mms82** (10): perfect song to be a duet. Haunting and majestic

**moooo566** (10): They both have such fantastic voices and the layered vocals are beautiful. I wish this could have had a video.

**MrMoodle** (10): Why doesn’t Justin sound like this more often. His low voice is actually really good and yet he almost always opts for that weird layered chipmunk shit. I don’t hate it but he really should do this more often, maybe I haven’t heard enough Bon Iver tracks. This really should’ve been the lead single. It could’ve had way more longevity than Cardigan, people eat this shit right up, people being me, I’m the one eating the shit.

**musical\_pyn** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxdgPQa9cPc&t=514s

**mysario** (10): I can't explain why its this song but after spending most of my life having to push my emotions in a tiny box, I have a hard time expressing serious emotions a lot of time but this really strikes a chord that makes me incredibly sad and makes me feel human again instead of a walking meme whose idea of fun is submitting "Dopesmoker" for everyone to listen to

**mythicalbeaste** (10): what a beautiful mending of voices

**NotWith10000Men** (10): ughhhh his VOICE. The PIANO. The HARMONIES

**plastichaxan** (10): this, to me, was a turning point in my journey for taylor's music and i'll always cherish it

**ReallyCreative** (10): me washing up on the shores of Wraeclast, shortly before the dead guy next to me turns into a zombie

**rosecult** (10): love this, they both sound so good

**seanderlust** (10): me holding all this love out here in the hall: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6d/9e/11/6d9e11d38fb89f609bddb51171697401.png

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Bon Iver's voice is just orgasmic. My reaction are exactly like Ajayll's. The way they harmonize each other are just so impressing

**skargardin** (10): god this is gorgeous

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song is so funny to me because we all know (or have been a part of) that replationship where the guy is completely oblivious and the girl is like "I'm giving you so many signs! pay attention!"

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this was the biggest grower on the album for me. i have alot of feelings about the bridge but i'll keep it brief and say i love it

**Tedyonce** (10): this song makes my melancholy feel vast and majestic (when it is in fact meaningless and pathetic), close runner-up for my 11

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i think i've streamed this song before.... and i really liked the ending

**twistedpython** (10): His voice stirs things in my loins and the interplay on the bridge is perfection

**vayyiqra** (10): Unironically, we need affirmative action for the white man Bon Iver in this rate because this song deserves it.

**bulforster** (9.5): okay so maybe she did something here

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): ajayii's reaction to daddy bon is a mood

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): The first couple minutes are honestly a little underwhelming, but I LOVE the contrasting lyrics at the end and the way the track builds

**jackisboredtoday** (9.2): this grew on me so much… the way their voices intertwine and build on each other at the end is SUBLIME

**nooodisaster** (9): "You never gave a warning sign / I gave so many signs." Was this everyone's favorite song on initial listen? Yes. Did it fall in everyone's ranking as time went on? Yes. Is it still a damn good song? Yes. [alt comment: Ajayll's horny listen of this lives in my head rent free]

**rslashpoopheads** (9): the end of this track is the best part of the album

**shesdoingyoga** (9): loses a point for seeming like it tries too hard to be a sad song, but otherwise it sounds gorgeous. Maybe I just don’t listen to enough men but I wish there were more singers who sang low like Justin does here, it brings me back to my a cappella days where I could never really get a solo because the songs we did were almost always out of my range

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): verses are okay but the chorus is GOLDEN OH MY GOD THIS ALBUM IS GROWING ON ME BEST SO FAR.

**vagenda** (8.9): Where were you at 00:11:45 on July 24th 2020, when thousands of Swifties around the world experienced a collective heart attack at Bon Iver’s voice coming in on this song

**bbfan132** (8.5): their voices sound so good together ugh - i prefer evermore but this is also good

**bluepupz** (8.5): I really like the call and response part in the bridge, and I like how they're directly addressing each other in the duet. The contrast between Bon Iver's and Taylor's voice is a bit jarring but works in the context of the song.

**mayolizard** (8.5): honestly this was a grower

**rickikardashian** (8.5): [taylor and justin vernon in exile](https://i.imgur.com/6Dk9Z1n.mp4)

**runaway3212** (8.5): Bon Iver's voice sounds weird at the start but during the bridge it all comes perfectly together

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I got so scared the first time I heard this song when Bon Iver came in with his homicidal growl.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): depression

**booksandplantsand** (8): okay ms. vernon!

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): wait is this where that meme is from

**Misentro** (8): It's beautiful, his deep voice adds such a nice contrast to Taylor, but "so stEP RIGHT AUT" really takes me out.

**purplechilipepper** (8): they both sound beautiful here

**SmileAndTears** (8): I like it but at the same time there’s just something that’s not working for me. I think it’s the production, it sounds kinda sterile

**Stryxen** (8): why are they trying to shout over each other so bad help

**thePotatofairyy** (8): They sound great together and has really nice melodies

**Vromega** (8): Usually I hate "collabs" (I HATE this word too) that involves my favorite main pop girls but this one is working pretty fine, and it's the only one for this entire album

**whyishestaring** (8): I honestly don't get why everyone likes this song so much, I mean it's definitely not BAD, but she has better songs

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8): Not Taylor getting outdone by the white man Bon Iver, omg

ignitethephoenix: # in exile seeing you out

**aliensexist** (7.5): Controversial but I'm not the biggest fan of Bon Iver on this or evermore - his voice is just too deep for me but the song as grown on me (used to be my least favourite...)

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): When this song first came out, I loved it. Couldn't get enough. But after like a week or two I just stopped enjoying it, got old SO quickly. I still think it's a good song, but I just cant stand listening to it anymore.

**cocosairdep** (7.5): It feels like it’s more Bon Iver’s song than Taylor’s.

**intheaftermath** (7.5): not my favorite, but miles ahead of evermore

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): tbh not one of the better slow burns on the album, but still sounds ok

**wryn\_** (7.5): evermore is the better collab but this is very well written

**hielord** (7.3): you know what they say about deep voices

**jimmy345960** (7.2): least favorite song on the record and honestly thats a compliment because this is a fucking bop. i just feel the "movie" shit is a little played out

**Awkward\_King** (7): i wouldn't give bon iver two looks if i passed him on the street but if i heard his voice in a confessional booth i'd cum

**MrSwearword** (7): Justin Vernon does not have the vocal expression needed, even if his flatness works for a song this intentionally dour. Everything else is OK.

**pig-serpent** (7): This is nice. I'll either never feel like listening to it again or it's going to get stuck in my head 3 months from now and I'll spend 5 hours trying to remember what the song is before deciding it's actually a 10.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): It's a good dramatic duet. Not in love with how it ends though. It's kinda goes on for too long, or alternatively, forgets to go to the next level during the last chorus. A well placed key changed could have made it.

**waluigiest** (7): their voices are beautiful and the writing is fine, I just think it lacks a certain spark.

**wavingwolves** (7): this song sounds like what going through a midlife crisis feels like

**CHRMbishop** (6): ehh

**vintagebathingsuit** (6): i really don't see what y'all see in this snoozefest

**WillamThunderfuck** (6): Unlike most people, this is probably one my least favourites of the album :/ Maybe it’s because it features a man, who knows.

**bespectacIed** (5): "that white man Bon Iver" will never not be funny. Not bad, just a bit meh. Iconic hook though

**CarlieScion** (5): i just cannot stand bon ivers voice lmao

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know, please don't say you're sorry, I've seen this film before and I can take care of myself.

**Flegasaurus** (5): ok i have to admit that i've never actually listened to bon iver before

**J\_Toe** (5): tbh, I find Justin Vernon's voice has an ASMR quality that is too clear and it makes me uncomfortable

**Bombay\_Mapper** (4): 6 This grew on me, but I don't really get the extreme hype around it. Kind of a skip.

**Roxieloxie** (4): why the fuck did you all vote fo this album to be in ultimate and not in the lineup with the apple girl and ham????? I could've been rating the cicada song and the sex position song right now, and yet here we are.

**xxrandooxx** (3.8): Girl buys 1 piano and uses it in every song huh… anyways i hate men voice

**KennyEarthman** (3.5): their voices blend well but I just don't like the song

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3.5): plz don't dox me Swifites

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): this song doesn’t do it for me. maybe I just don’t like bon iver but this song is boring to me.

**ryjomom** (3): Certain parts of this song makes me wish I was deaf.

**Bajuko** (1): This was kind of a boring song, and I am not a fan of Bon Iver’s voice at all, which really drags it down for me

**akanewasright** (10): I did not know this was the fan favorite for a long time, and then when I started seeing swifties praise this song to high heavens, I was kind of like “….that song? Out of all of the folklore tracks?” But honestly, it makes sense that this is the track that the swifties worshipped. I criticized a few other songs for being bridge heavy, but the verses in this song still have enough presence in the song to keep everything else afloat. They get to carry all of the nostalgia and beauty of the affair, while the chorus colors it melancholy, and the bridge cuts your heart into pieces. I’ve also considered the explosion of sound after the final “remember when I pulled up and said get in the car” one of my favorite moments on the album from the beginning. Overall, this song did what it could, but the “stale topic” train just got the best of her.

**hikkaru** (10): THE fan fave from folklore, and unfortunately the final cut for Taylor. I was very wary about including folklore with these synthy throwback albums, and it didn't end as poorly as I thought it could have but it's not too big of a surprise here that Dua and The Weeknd are mopping the competition. As for august itself, the vocal production is an absolute highlight for me, as is the bridge which has already become a classic among her plethora of other classic bridges across her albums. Unfortunately for Swifties, it just wasn't strong enough to give her a good showing against the two powerhouse albums, and so this is where Taylor gets cut for good. Maybe Evermore will have better luck if we get to rating that?

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my other favorite from the album, this song is easily the highlight of Folklore. It’s a perfect sad summery song. And it has an excellent build up as well.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (11): Petition to make Jack Antonoff the King of Pop(heads)

**CarlieScion** (11): it takes a really sexy brain to appreciate this song

**ChandelierFlickering** (11): love this perspective so much and the production is gorgeous

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): I know I keep saying that I have a personal connection to many of Taylor's songs, but this one just hits really close to home. On top of August being my birth month, I totally relate to the fucking pain here. I won't be specific, but let's just say that there are two guys with who I thought I had a chance with. Long story short, heterosexuality won as these guys were never mine to begin with. 💔 Personal story aside, this is the epitome of Taylor's songwriting and this is something that I wanted to hear from Taylor since Red. I thought of giving my 11 to someone else but I just know not giving August an 11 considering these factors feels wrong to me.

**fallenriot** (11): this is one of my favorite songs from last year. the opening line feels like a breath of fresh, warm, beach air. the bridge, the second bridge, the subdued repeat of the second bridge, and the loud repeat of the second bridge as all the instrumentals come back in are all so so good. this song makes me happy whenever i listen to it.

**Jackalope117** (11): I know this isn't going to win because Blinding Lights is a lock, but this is the best song of 2020 (except ivy)

**jimmy345960** (11): This song is so important to me and it hasn't even been out for a year. I feel like this defined a section of my life that isn't over yet. For that, I will be entirely grateful. This song is so wonderful because of the perspective of the "cheating" girl being flipped on its head. A stereotype that is usually demonized is now being shown in an almost magical light. The juxtaposition between the beauty and the elegancy of the vocals and the fact that she's meeting this dude behind a smelly ass mall. This reminds me that so many things in life have multiple different perspectives. When I was cheated on, I only saw things from my perspective. Now, I'm not gonna say thats wrong because they definitely did hurt me but its helpful in the forgiveness. I hope that I can take this lesson and apply it to other places in my life. So this MEGABOP gets an eleven.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Is this what Swifties hear in every Taylor song? This is without a doubt my favourite song of hers, the instrumental is so warm and lush, the lyricism and imagery here is incredible, and the emotion in that bridge is just… wow. I adore this in every way possible

**rickikardashian** (11): [Taylor gifting me this song at the lowest point of my life](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/739218471535116341/820905238683844638/PicsArt_03-15-03.23.57.jpg)

**slimboyfriend** (11): Too many people hate Taylor and her fans for this to win, but she's awakened my wistful inner indie girl in a way that no pop star has in awhile

**twistedpython** (11): Jack Antonoff deserves to be Deified for his work on this song. It may be predictable and boring and safe but Augustheads really are superior

**vagenda** (11): The only good song ever made

**1998tweety** (10): a contender for my 11, so so good

**AHSWeeknd** (10): one of my faves off this

**booksandplantsand** (10): did you want to make me cry, popheads? did you want to make me weep alone in my room? happy women's history month I guess

**Brendon-Urine** (10): definitely my favorite folklore song. the kinda track where you realize damn... Taylor Swift really is a master songwriter.

**ColsonBakerr** (10): It was physically painful to not give this my 11 but the Weeknd did THAT so... I'm also happy she's playing to her vocal strengths now cause this was amazing. One of my most played song of 2020.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The only song that struck a chord with me on my first listen.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): She a ho but damn she wrote a great song.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): yeah I’m an august stan, what about it ???

**intheaftermath** (10): hi fellow guitar players! This song is pretty easy to play and a ton of fun, so I'd absolutely suggest learning it! Capo 3, D, G, Em, A should get you through most of it to start, but you can try other Capo #s to get a more accurate sound :)

**jasannn** (10): I may be a bit biased since August is my birth month but I just love this song. I don't get how "Meet me behind the mall" is such a powerful lyric but it just is. My second choice for my 11.

**jexan13** (10): yes, Taylor, give me those crumbs of dream pop

**just\_thonking** (10): Catchy, lovely instrumentals, captures a feeling perfectly, incredible bridge -- literally what is there not to love

**ManofOranges** (10): I went through a particularly sad and vulnerable patch recently, and as I would go on my long walks around the city in an effort to just get myself out of the house and also to prevent myself from just eating the food in the pantry since I had nothing else to do, I wound up listening to this song on repeat as I thought about the straight crush that I had a few years ago (the crush that I tried to get over by listening to Your Type and Sleepover) that was obviously out of my reach (and my league) and wondering what it would be like if we just so happened to run into each other at the local farmer's market that happens every Saturday morning, and we would both see each other and he'd look confused and surprised and I would too (even though on the inside I'd be jumping for joy) and we'd walk up to each other and say hey, and I'd ask him how he's been and he'd say that he's been alright, and he'd ask me how I've been and I'd say alright, and then we'd talk about the weather or something, talk about our majors, I'd tell him that I'm currently in between majors and am not sure what to do and he'd give me some advice that I'd take simply because I find him attractive, and I'd ask him what his major is and it'd probably be something stupid like horticulture but I wouldn't care because I find him hot. And we'd continue to talk for hours, the market would close but we'd stick around, catching up and just having a good time on some nice August Saturday. Then we'd exchange numbers, and slowly we'd get closer and we'd both realize we were meant to be and we would just live in the moment, live for the hope of it all, and we'd just do spontaneous things and be happy together like meet behind the mall or some shit like that. But anyways, then I'd nearly get hit by a car while I was imagining this on my walk and I'd realize that none of this would ever actually be happen because this dude is straighter than a line, and so I'd snap out of it, continuing on my walk around the city, somewhat heartbroken because the relationship that I'd imagined would never actually come true. And then one particular night, out of desperation I looked up to see if he was on instagram, and I figured he wasn't because he's just not that kind of guy, but I found he actually DOES have an instagram, and he has 0 posts, but seeing that profile picture of him was all it took to get me hung up on him for like a week, and while I normally never check instagram, I started to check instagram every other minute because it felt like now that I'd discovered his profile, going on instagram could somehow manifest him DM'ing me, which would then start the relationship of my dreams or something. I had even though that maybe if I make a post or sumn, it'll somehow circulate around to his account through like Instagram recommending it to his account or something and then he'd see it and then follow me and the rest would be history. None of that happened either. His account still sits there, profile picture staring back at me, almost taunting me, but I know nothing will ever come of it. Anyways, this is a great song.

**mayolizard** (10): manifesting top 3 august

**mythicalbeaste** (10): perfect

**pat-rickstar** (10): This will probably be Taylor's highest ranked song here. I won’t be mad if it is

**ryjomom** (10): My most played song of August 2020. Now come on now...

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the part where she said we are bound to lose is just heaven

**skargardin** (10): i swear im not a swiftie but this is kinda like the best song ever i think

**SmileAndTears** (10): I love you Jack Antonoff

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): it's not surprising why this is a fan favourite

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (10): the betty-james-august triangle is the one of the most beautiful musical stories I've ever heard.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the amount of people who think the lyric is "cause you were mine to lose" concerns me

**wasian-invasion** (10): #teamaugustgirl

**wavingwolves** (10): ah to be a white girl in the summer screaming cause you weren't MINEEEEEEEEEEE TO LOSE out of a car window

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): Such a pretty song omg, it makes sense that August is the best song on this album, considering the best people are born in August as well!

**zagreux** (10): the vocal delivery here is so. fucking. good.

=====

ignitethephoenix: **aliensexist** (9.9): The joy I feel when the orchestra comes in at the very end is like in a musical when everything comes together for the final kiss and your heart is full

**LeninaCrowne94** (9.7): The whole ‘teenage love triangle!’ discourse that’s taken over discussion of this song annoys the shit out of me, but at least that’s better than people saying it’s about Tom Hiddleston. Anyway the outro slaps

**NFLfreak98** (9.6): I was born in august so legally this has to be my favorite song here (luckily its also extremely good)

**shhhneak** (9.6): Bridges stronger than USA infrastructure, etc.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): Sis deserved better…

**jsonphile** (9.5): if I had to pick a best moment on this album, it would probably be Taylor going “you weren’t mine to lose” on the bridge

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): probably the best song on this album

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Another song in the rate that loses out on being a 10 by feeling like it drags on just a bit too long

**TiltControls** (9.5): you know, this song is the perfect length to put over snow halation

**Awkward\_King** (9): this song is cruel summer if cruel summer didn't make me hyperventilate (dont ask)

**bbfan132** (9): not my favorite but i love jack’s dreamy production here

**camerinian** (9): at long last, the late 90s radio-friendly adult alternative revival.

**cremeebrulee** (9): i know this is THE folklore track (a la getaway car, cruel summer, etc.) but i don’t really consider it one of my favorites. BUT this song is still top half for me + that bridge is one of my favorite taylor bridges ever

**lillipup03** (9): This song literally sounds like burnt yellow grass and 90 degree heat... like, I can smell the hay fever. Ah, Ohio...

**ReallyCreative** (9): the one song Swifties gas up that actually meets expectations

**waluigiest** (9): rememberwhenipulledupandsaidgetinthecar

**pheromenos** (8.8): fitting score lol

**Stryxen** (8.7): nevermind that boy, this rate is yours to lose don't. fuck it up.

**bluepupz** (8.5): I really enjoy the ending instrumental part. I like that the song doesn't feel like it's dragging at any point in its 4.5 minutes.

**Iris3271** (8.5): Whyyyy am I crying?

**mms82** (8.5): grew on me tremendously over the past two months

**nooodisaster** (8.5): "Back when we were still changing for the better." I really like this, but not as much as Swifties/general popheads. Like, this is a 4 minute midtempo jam with 1.5 of that being an outro. Still, there's a handful of lyrics that stand as the best on the entire album. It perfectly captures the almost pathetic desire of a really intense fling, and unfortunately the audience can relate. This is chiller than you'd expect, but when it hits it hits real good.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is an 8 for the grammy’s performance

**Flegasaurus** (8): yeahh i think this one is pretty good i think

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8): August. 8th month. 8th track. Makes sense. Also yes, it gets an 8 from me. On purpose? Once again, no.

**MrMoodle** (8): I feel like I’m really close to loving this song but there are just so many clunky moments in the production. Like, the song opens really weirdly and abruptly, and then there’s the little part in the second repetition of the bridge where she says "remember when I pulled up and said 'get in the car'" and then it goes quiet but then the instrumental comes back in hard for "AND THEN CANCELLED MY PLANS..." like it just feels so awkward. They really tried to have a moment there but the instrumental was only quiet for such a short period of time that it just felt super forced. I get why this is a popheads favourite but it just feels like there were so many little mistakes like that in the mixing that take me out of the moment.

**musical\_pyn** (8): the week after this album came out I got into a month-long relationship that ended badly so I can’t really listen to this song anymore but I still think it’s good!

**seanderlust** (8): cancel plans just in case you call and say Let's Go To The Mall

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I think the thing that eleates this song to me is the throughline to betty (still don't care about cardigan though)

# Either like winter or incompatible with Leos

**celladonn** (7): No hate but I really don't understand why this is such a fan favourite

**NotWith10000Men** (7): another cute melody, but it's the weakest one of the trilogy

**runaway3212** (7): imo the weakest of the three love triangle songs

**Roxieloxie** (6.8): this reminds me of mid 2000s adult contemporary music and not even in a Natasha Beninfield way, i would hear this while shopping at ross and i would not really enjoy it

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): the album is getting boring now

**givebackmysweatshirt** (6): taylor whyyyy leos are already insufferable enough as they are they didn't need a song about their birth month too

**Tedyonce** (6): it’s a good song but it’s not THAT good, damn, it’s not sad enough for me lol

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): August here is winter, so the idea of summer activities in August doesn't really translate well for me.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5): to me this sounds like some 90s indie girlie but i'm not sure who?? help??

**MrSwearword** (5): at least it's as lukewarm as the intent it's going for

**xxrandooxx** (5): it's got a cute vibe.

**frogaranaman** (4): imagine I’m giving this song August’s numerical value (8) but divide it by two because I don’t like the mixing on this song

**pig-serpent** (4): A few of Taylor's songs have choruses that sound like they should be prechoruses, and this is another addition to that family, even if it would be a fantastic prechorus. The verses and the bridge suck, but the ending is rather pretty as well. Real mixed bag here.

**vintagebathingsuit** (4): everything is so drenched in reverb

**bespectacIed** (1): I'm trying to find taylor's essence in this song and I can't, it's just feels lifeless, textbook 90s adult contemporary. She's better than this

**akanewasright** (10): Yeah, I actually love this remix. I think Doja fucking kills it. I always sing her beginning notes in the car when I play the standard edition, and in general I think she matches the energy of the song really well, which was not what I expected.

**hikkaru** (10): Doja is so versatile and she brings that to In Your Eyes brilliantly, both singing and rapping and adding a nice spin to the song. When I listen to In Your Eyes I'll generally just listen to the original on the album or, on its own, the Kenny G Remix, but this is still a stellar addition to the song and I have no issue giving it a 10.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This isn’t as good as the original as much as I like Doja. Maybe because I listened to the original a shit ton of times before this came out but this doesn’t work for me fully. It’s too soft for her and I prefer her rapping over her singing. Still a bop though!

---

# bitch I'm a cow...moo

**1998tweety** (10): better than the original

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is honestly a contender for doja's best verse she changes up her flow so much

**booksandplantsand** (10): would die for doja

**cremeebrulee** (10): deserved to blow up

**DaHumanTorch** (10): made an already amazing song even better. so mad this didn’t smash

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Doja's grown on me so much over the last year, I love her contribution to this.

**intheaftermath** (10): this was really fun! Doja brought a lot to this!

**jackisboredtoday** (10): This remix grew on me so much, Doja sounds so great playing off him here and it really shows her versatility as a performer

**KennyEarthman** (10): In Your Eyes is a perfect song

**lolcevan** (10): i’ve never heard doja sing aside from in say so but i absolutely love her vocals here omg. wish she sung in the chorus tho. overall just a really solid remix.

**ManofOranges** (10): Ok now this is a hit.

**mayolizard** (10): SO GOOD!!!!!!!

**Misentro** (10): WAIT I HADN'T HEARD THIS IT'S FANTASTIC

**moooo566** (10): Doja Cat is a really solid addition here, I like it a lot.

**mythicalbeaste** (10): they work really well together

**rickikardashian** (10): i believe in Doja Cat supremacy

**runaway3212** (10): Somehow better than original

**TiltControls** (10): a perfect addition to the song. the original is good, but this is much better!

**twistedpython** (10): The extra saxophone gives me orgasmic feelings.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): the absolute set of up putting this after folklore as if, at this point,  i wont give anything that I can throw ass too a ten after that

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): not as good as the original but still, it doesn't go wrong

**thePotatofairyy** (9.5): the original is already perfect but this is a great alternative!

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): doja sounds lovely but the verse doesn’t really fit with the rest of the song lol

**astrologicalangel** (9): Doja doesn't really add anything, but she doesn't detract from the song either

**celladonn** (9): Not as good as the original but Doja sounds great

**cocosairdep** (9): I like Doja’s verse, but I prefer the solo version. This is still great tho.

**jasannn** (9): Doja Cat fuckin owned this. I wish there was more harmonizing tho.

**LeninaCrowne94** (9): This is the 80s nostalgia we need. Also Doja has a really nice singing voice

**pat-rickstar** (9): It's a good remix of a good song. They should collab again

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's fine, I like most of the changes, but it's a bit of a cash grab

**ryjomom** (9): Doja Cat deserves the world and this remix should’ve made it to radio. It made me like the original. Vocals from Miss Cat.

**sirpancakeXI** (9): it would be great if doja would add more vocal in between the song

**waluigiest** (9): Doja’s verse is so clean!!

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): Doja just adds something a little extra to this song

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.9): BOP

**hielord** (8.8): Doja is actually a really nice addition to this song

**oscarbrierley1** (8.6): i like Doja's verse on this

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): She should’ve rapped more imo

**BookyCats** (8): Blinding Lights with Rosalía - Remix: 9.2

**frogaranaman** (8): I’ve listened to the original way too much so the flow feels off but this is Good

**vayyiqra** (8): I love Doja Cat. I think she's a really interesting artist.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): This is kind of an underwhelming remix. It's not bad but I feel like it could've been better. Doja has a great singing voice but I think the remix would have been better if she did an entire rap verse instead.

**Alumineous** (7): Doja Kitty needs to sing more, her voice is so good.

**bbfan132** (7): kind of detracted from the original version imo - doja’s verse was fine but i don’t know if it fit in that well… also i didn’t really like the random vocal run at the beginning/end

**fallenriot** (7): it’s whatever honestly, pretty inoffensive in terms of usual remixes

**ImADudeDuh** (7): definitely a step down from the original

**seanderlust** (7): i love doja but I don't feel like this needed to be made tbh

**skargardin** (7): Doja should've stuck to singing here, I don't think the rap parts fit that well really

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Not the better remix of this song

**team\_kockroach** (6.8): It sounds pleasant, but what is Amala really adding to the track? Basically nothing

**LesApfels** (6.5): Under no circumstances would I listen to this over the original

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Well at least it's not the Kenny G remix

**mms82** (6.4): dojo improves this

**brenda\_official** (6): putting the saxophone at the beginning was a very poor choice

# barbz and cardi fans

**ktajlili** (6): Doja sounds pretty but I don't think her verse really adds anything

**rslashpoopheads** (6): sorry doja but this fails to elevate the song in any way. hate when remixes are just the featured artist thrown onto a verse and then forgotten.

**shhhneak** (6): Kenny G was robbed

**xxrandooxx** (6): need more of Doja’s singing voice in my life

**AHSWeeknd** (5): no ❤️

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): I don’t mind Doja’s edition, and l love the extra sax; but I wish she was integrated more into the song instead of tacked into the middle.

**jimmy345960** (5): does nothing to elevate the original

**wavingwolves** (4): doesn't add anything

**Bombay\_Mapper** (1): The starting made me think I accidently played a YouTube video and Spotify at the same time. Comperletely unnecessary. Also Doja Cat's voice is annoying.

**hikkaru** (10): For me personally, this is the ultimate version of Levitating and the version I've been streaming since it released. The original just sounds a bit empty to me now, since DaBaby really gives it his all in an incredibly fun verse as well as some other parts sprinkled through the song. It really adds a lot to the track and anyone that dislikes it needs to get over their misandry smh! But even with the people that much prefer the original it manages to WIN the bonus rate, which is well deserved. Congrats Dua!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Love this version. Dababy definitely enhances the song and has a great intro and verse. Also I’m glad that this is finally smashing, I remember I was crossing my fingers to see if it would make top 10 and it’s done that and beyond! Glad this is the bonus rate winner!

# left foot right foot levitating, popstars dua lipa and dababy

**1998tweety** (10): better than the original

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I mean it's just as good as the original, DaBaby doesn't improve it but I like his verse. Doesn't make it worse which happens oh so often with added verses.

**celladonn** (10): I mean, it's not the original but DaBaby genuinely sounds so good on this

**cocosairdep** (10): I like DaBaby’s verse, but the solo version is already perfect. This is still a 10 tho.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the remix is GOOD yall are just racist

**frogaranaman** (10): DaBaby fills in a lot of empty space from the original and thus it is better

**musical\_pyn** (10): the superior version

**mysario** (10): one of the greatests, no debating on it

**mythicalbeaste** (10): yeah this is a remix for the ages

**pat-rickstar** (10): I didn’t originally plan on giving this a higher score than the original, but here we are

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Just a superior version of the original, DaBaby really helps round out the track

**ReallyCreative** (10): we're deciding against misandry today

**rickikardashian** (10): if you gave the original levitating a 10, but took away more than 3 points off the remix, I'm going to assume you're either racist or have a personal vendetta against dababy

**rslashpoopheads** (10): https://i.imgflip.com/4y0mhv.jpg

**runaway3212** (10): Dababy really adds to this

**ryjomom** (10): It really is Pop Stars Dua Lipa with DaBaby.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): hate to admit it but the dababy verse make the song better

**skargardin** (10): it's levitating with a great dababy verse, what's not to like?

**TiltControls** (10): honestly I like the original more since I'm more used to it, but it's like the difference between an 11 and a 10

**NFLfreak98** (9.7): Sorry DaBaby, gotta drop this a little for ‘left foot right foot levitating’

**jsonphile** (9.5): this is honestly probably one of the best remixes we got last year

**mayolizard** (9.5): this is also great yass

**moooo566** (9.5): Oh, here it is! I don't really care for the DaBaby sections but they're not that bad.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): dababy is such a great energy, i can't imagine disliking him

**mms82** (9.4): the DaBaby verse is fantastic

**wardrum5** (9.3): hated it at first but it really grew on me and now the original feels empty without DaBaby's "cheese" line. wish he was doing more "let's gooo" adlibs at the end as it builds up though

**bbfan132** (9): a total bop and dababy is great here too - feels a bit unnecessary but still

**booksandplantsand** (9): dababy does NOT miss

**jasannn** (9): Pretty good for the locals

**KennyEarthman** (9): it's Levitating. it's always good

**Roxieloxie** (9): I still think that DaBaby was underutilized here but he's still nice

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I don't dislike the addition of DaBaby, but I son't really think it adds anything

**thePotatofairyy** (9): DaBaby really kills it here in a good way. Was not expecting to love this as much as I did

**wasian-invasion** (9): he's fine I guess, but why are we still doing second verse guest raps

**aladreeladon** (8.5): why did they cut the last chorus, unnecessary

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.5): I don't like DaBaby but I gotta admit, his lines are catchy and the feature doesn't seem out of place. Original's still better.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): left foot, right foot

**Awkward\_King** (8): overhated dababy's verse on this is honestly great

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): DaBaby's verse is alright, but I can't help but think of that fan remix with Megan Thee Stallion on it and I wish Dua collab with Megan instead because that would've been #1 so easily. Anyways...this is an alright remix.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the best version of this song

**ManofOranges** (8): It's fine, still prefer the original. Sorry bout it!

**nooodisaster** (8): This score is basically just DaBaby's addition. I like it, it's fun, has flow, funny at parts, adds energy, is kinda random but whateves.

**nootnoot781** (8): i feel like if i was less accustomed to the original i would prefer this version a lot more

**slimboyfriend** (8): It's still good!

**SmileAndTears** (8): This is better than the original, stop lying to yourself

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): kinda genius collab

**Tedyonce** (8): cheese on it

**waluigiest** (8): honestly not a bad feature! It’s not really a remix tho lmao

**wavingwolves** (8): the superior version of levitating

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.5): dababy sounds so fun in this remix

**twistedpython** (7.5): I hate rap remixes usually but I tolerate this one since the "left foot right foot" bit is funny and they didn't cut out the bridge

**2dina3dworld** (7): DaBaby did better on "My Oh My" but the song still works

**AHSWeeknd** (7): why does DaBaby talk about making a sandwich??


# not floating (feat. a man)

**ktajlili** (7): I guess I don't mind this remix even if DaBaby is really goofy

**seanderlust** (7): left foot, right foot let's stomp. take it back now yall.

**astrologicalangel** (6): I like DaBaby, but he did not need to be here

**CHRMbishop** (6): ketchup? really?

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (5): DaBaby's verse doesn't flow well with the instrumental AT ALL! it feels like this https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/857/231/876.png

# hmmmm there is something about these takes but I can't quite put my finger on it

**pheromenos** (9): points deducted because of dababy but it's still really good

**bespectacIed** (7): the original is flawless

**LeninaCrowne94** (7): Still a bop, but DaBaby’s verse is kinda pointless

**xxrandooxx** (6.7): gave the original version a 7.2… so lemme just subtract .5 for the section with the male part.

**fallenriot** (6): i don’t get the hype for this remix tbh, all of his verses sound the same

**zagreux** (5.2): the original slaps. This? Not so much.

**fedefreakss** (4): not really necessary

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): If I have to hear DaBaby ruin another pop song istg 😶

**vayyiqra** (3): Oh no this is bad !!!

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: As much as I am sad August didn't even make it to the Top 5, the results solidified my reasons why I voted Folklore to be added in this year's Ultimate Rate instead of the Soft-Rock Girls Rate with Phoebe and HAIM. Taylor is going to win that rate and it's going to be an unfair fight because of the amount of Swifties here. By including Taylor in this rate, she has a fair fight with her peers in the industry.

I am also glad that I voted to include After Hours in this rate here despite the worries that people here are gonna do After Hours dirty. Abel is the biggest main pop boy right now to the point I really believed he has a fair chance against the likes of Dua, Gaga and Taylor. Blinding Lights is going to win this rate. I am manifesting it.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Kinda funny how there are more Little Monsters and Swifties here in Popheads, yet the ~~Luvs~~ Dua Peeps and XO stans are the ones dominating this rate lmao.

**akanewasright** (10): Lowkey I kind of wish this had made into the top 5 over one of the Dua songs, but I’m happy this song went as far as it did. It’s hung out in the top 10, just outside of the top 5 for roughly the entire rate, and... yeah I think it deserved a little better than that. The song, like the few right before it, does the updated 80’s sound *perfectly*. Everything about it feels perfectly dramatic, yet genuine and emotional.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): finishing off the string of 10’s for me is this track. I absolutely love the pulsing guitar with synths mixed in and his vocals and melody. Everything just works so good together that it is the ideal moody bop. The theme of Saving your Tears for another person and not them being wasted on himself anymore is so good and I think perfectly encapsulates moving on when things are irresolvable in a relationship.

**hikkaru** (7): My ~hot take~ is that this Isn't Actually That Good. I mean I'm still giving it a 7 so obviously I like it to some degree but I don't think I'd put it in the same category as Heartless, Faith, Blinding Lights and In Your Eyes as part of the immaculate run of smash 10s. It's fine and I'm happy for any song of his to become a hit, but wow do I wish this song's success had occurred to In Your Eyes instead! Personally I find this just a tad too basic in production and melody compared to the greatness that is on a lot of other tracks on After Hours, so it's not something I really come back to quite as much as a lot of the other songs and if it were up to me I'd have it a fair bit lower in this rate. Unfortunately for me, y'all love this one and it outranks all of Taylor and Gaga, so there's that!

ignitethephoenix: # crying tears of joy

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop, iconic 3 song run

**bespectacIed** (10): The three-song run of modern classics BL- IYE - SYT has to be intentional

**CarlieScion** (10): this sounds like old school prom from like the 80s

**ColsonBakerr** (10): THIS. This is it. Was my favourite when the album came out and I was SO happy that this wasn't a single cause it was pretty well-known but not overplayed ya know... until it did but still... hurts me to not give it my 11

**cremeebrulee** (10): again POP perfection . this song has only continued to grow on me and it was already a 10 to begin with

**deadline4mymemories** (10): the next time someone says Max Martin fell off, send them this album

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): [I was so honored to write a piece about this song for the The Top 100 Tracks of 2020, according to r/popheads list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kyrcji/the_top_100_tracks_of_2020_according_to_rpopheads/gjj6ck7/) To summarize my write-up, I loved this song so much because even if this kind of sound is so unique to The Weeknd, it's still pretty much him to the core.

**fishingfor8** (10): glad this became a hit, I don't know why this didn't get pushed before in your eyes

**Flegasaurus** (10): this almost got my 11!!! i honestly don't have much to say it's just really really good

**frogaranaman** (10): insert handsome Squidward meme here

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): ended the scammies

**ImADudeDuh** (10): thank god this single is at least doing good now that blinding lights mania is slowing down

**intheaftermath** (10): I heard this song on the radio before hearing it on a streaming service, and it really shines without the muddle of the radio

**jasannn** (10): The three song run of Blinding Lights, In Your Eyes and Save Your Tears is incredible. Your main pop girl could never.

**lillipup03** (10): honestly better than Blinding Lights, but y’all aren’t ready for that conversation...

**mayolizard** (10): so fucking good holy shit. strong 11 contender

**MrMoodle** (10): This was my favourite song on the album on first listen. It’s one of those songs you feel like you’ve always known, it just flows so perfectly, it’s like while he was writing it he tuned into some natural musical frequency of the universe and it just wrote itself, but it still doesn’t sound derivative. Everything about this song is just so effortless.

**mythicalbeaste** (10): I wanna dance and cry

**NFLfreak98** (10): This is pretty much just circles but yeah its great

**NotWith10000Men** (10): maybe the anchor of the strongest three song run in this rate. PERFECT chorus

**pat-rickstar** (10): It took this being pushed as a single for it to click with me, and I'm so glad it did

**plastichaxan** (10): i identify with both parts of the song and i honestly don't know what to think of that

**rickikardashian** (10): Abel has shown time and time again that he's nothing but an awful romantic partner and a douchebag in many situations……. and i still would like to be able to spend a passionate summer that destroys me emotionally and leaves me unable to trust any man again in my life

**Roxieloxie** (10): This album really is backloaded huh. This string from faith on has not let me down

**runaway3212** (10): I love how simple yet effective this is

**seanderlust** (10): "i would cry but i don't think i can spare the moisture" - lucille bluth saving her tears

**shesdoingyoga** (10): There’s something about the production on this one that I love, I just can’t quite pick out what it is

**shhhneak** (10): this is pop perfection and deserved the success Blinding Lights got.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Another bop

**skargardin** (10): we love a hit

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song lives in my head rent free

**TiltControls** (10): we had Blinding Lights dominate 2020 (and still 2021) now we're ready for Save Your Tears to dominate 2021 (and 2022)!!

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): a vibe

**wailord\_fan** (10): Hot take: this deserved the major staying power that Blinding Lights got.

**wavingwolves** (10): save your tears. save water. save every drop. our world depends on it.

**Stryxen** (9.9): lowkey sounds like girls in bikinis by poppy but you didn't hear that from me

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): the weakest of the singles, which doesn't mean its bad, in fact it's a great song. It just suffers from the fact the other singles are all 11 contenders.

**pheromenos** (9.5): best song on the album

**thePotatofairyy** (9.5): Makes me happy in a bittersweet way. Sublime chorus. Yet another song where the production really just blows me away.

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): the clapping is the best and worst part of the song

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9): I've always felt In Your Eyes and Save Your Tears are like twins, and Save Your Tears is the cooler twin. By a mile.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): I love this so song so much but I can't hear it without picturing plastic surgery Abel dancin around

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Doja remix >

**J\_Toe** (9): I feel like you can tell this is a Max Martin track in the best way possible. It's the little details in the production

**jimmy345960** (9): Certified banger.

**just\_thonking** (9): I played this like five times a day every day in early quarantine

**lolcevan** (9): a bit too repetitive towards the end i think but i really love the direction this album has taken suddenly

**ryjomom** (9): catchier than the coronavirus

**static\_int\_husp** (9): fuck the Grammys

**waluigiest** (9): dry your tears and shake some ass

**wasian-invasion** (9): SAVE. YOUR. TEARS. foranotherday

**SmileAndTears** (8.7): I’ve got nothing to say about the song itself but this is on an R&B playlist on Apple Music and like… gurl...

**bbfan132** (8.5): circles but good

**KennyEarthman** (8.5): why can I see post malone singing this

**ktajlili** (8.5): the fucking creepy-ass music video is perfect

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Don't mention the music video don't mention the music video don't-

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Never got the hype but it’s a hit so yeah

**booksandplantsand** (8): just a groovy, solid track

**rslashpoopheads** (8): not really single quality but still good

**twistedpython** (8): Fine, but it feels like it comes from a different album for some reason

**bluepupz** (7.5): I like the backing

**Alumineous** (7): It reminds me of that song, Words by F.R. David.

**camerinian** (7): Groovy.

**pig-serpent** (7): I don't love the hook, but the song has a lot of momentum and helps it groove even in its simplicity. The verses are fun and makes the song refreshing to listen to.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6.5): This the bass sound all bassists wish they could achieve. It's just so beautiful. It's also really the only thing propping up this score.

**mms82** (6.5): good vibes

**fallenriot** (5.5): i was surprised when this one was pushed as a single, i feel like it’s a pretty weak track

**xxrandooxx** (5.2): Fine! I'll save them for later.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): This song just doesn’t do it for me. It’s my least favorite in the project, it just feels soulless in comparison to a lot of the other songs on AH.

**akanewasright** (10): Max Martin and crew have not lost their magic touch. This song has fucking perfect pop production (at least… in my eyes).  Between the saxophone and that perfect beat that could made a stature dance a little, this song is one of the best sounding tracks in the rate. Honestly I think my only complaint about this song is that I miss Doja and Kenny G some of the time. But even then, there’s just so much good going on here.

**hikkaru** (10): If there's one thing I'll always be a complete sucker for it's a saxophone in a pop song, and it's used brilliantly here. Personally I love the Kenny G remix even more just because of the extra sax. But this is still an absolute 10, a song very much deserving of making it to the top 5 of this rate, and a song that I would say is one of the most robbed singles on the Hot 100 period. The fact that Blinding Lights was just so strong that it cannibalized this song - which was released multiple months after BL, might I add - will never not be disappointing to me. At least we're able to do it justice here on popheads.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my favorite song that was not previously released, this song deserved to smash like Blinding Lights (too bad blinding lights existed and stopped that from happening!). The saxophone is delightful and one again this is a masterclass in making a catchy pop song from beginning to end.

ignitethephoenix: # I can see clearly now

**givebackmysweatshirt** (11): listen i am rooting for a blinding lights win as much as any non delusional swifty/monster/dulapeep, but it would be DISHONEST to act as if this is not the best song on the album.

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop [2]

**aliensexist** (10): Almost gave the eleven to this

**Awkward\_King** (10): i prefer the doja version just because of how much more dynamic it feels but god this is good

**bbfan132** (10): no words, just dancing

**bespectacIed** (10): Have a crush on the baddie on this video Zaina Miuccia. The video of the year for 2020. Shouldve hit number 1 post-superbowl :(

**celladonn** (10): A very strong 11 contender and dare I say the best song The Weeknd has ever made

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): heard this so many times on the radio before I realized it was his

**CHRMbishop** (10): when I LOOK AT YOU IN YOUR EYEEEEEEEEEEES

**cremeebrulee** (10): pop perfection

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): While Blinding Lights is pop excellence, I love this song even more. It's the way how the trumpets were used is just chef's kiss. And if we are talking about the After Hours music videos, this is my favorite one to date because the mix of horror with this kind of song is just excellent.

**frogaranaman** (10): this slaps so hard

**intheaftermath** (10): heck yeah that bassline!!!!

**jasannn** (10): I'm surprised this didn't become a bigger hit

**jexan13** (10): any song with that title is a 10, always. Ask Kylie, Lola Marsh and I know I'm missing someone else

**ManofOranges** (10): Ok bop.

**MrMoodle** (10): This song is ridiculous and makes no sense at all based on the vibe of the album up to this point and I love it so much

**MrSwearword** (10): damn, this is good

**plastichaxan** (10): there's something about the chorus that just makes me feel too many things unlike other choruses that don't make me feel as much

**ReallyCreative** (10): it was a great year for songs with this title

**rickikardashian** (10): having to follow up BL would literally make any track look less-than, but somehow this is able to complement it so well and stays in the same level of quality. also both remixes elevate this so much. I'm so thankful for this era

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Blinding Lights B-side

**sirpancakeXI** (10): IMO this song is even better than BL, the instrumental in the intro and the chorus are just immaculate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): abel proving again he can make A-Grade pop songs, love the diversity

**thePotatofairyy** (10): What a killer chorus! The production is just outstanding.

**WhyDidEverIBother** (10): the Doja Cat remix would have been my 11 if I could be bothered to listen to all the other songs in the bonus rate

**LeninaCrowne94** (9.7): God this is such a bop

**camerinian** (9.5): Imagine having this impeccably crafted pop tune just sitting waiting to go out to the world, and the world says "No thanks I choose to hear the speedball anthem that's already been out for months again"

**DaHumanTorch** (9): this was a 10 until the superior doja remix came out. now it just feels incomplete without her

**J\_Toe** (9): this sounds like it could have appeared on Starboy

**jimmy345960** (9): Just a certified banger, music video is very trippy but I love it.

**ktajlili** (9): LOVE the instrumentals.

**mayolizard** (9): doja remix >>

**moooo566** (9): okay yeah this one has a good hook too.

**mythicalbeaste** (9): I miss Doja's part!

**vayyiqra** (9): [Holds up boombox standing in front of girl's window] This is a movie reference to another song by the same name just look it up.

**ColsonBakerr** (8): It's okay but never really grew on me

**fallenriot** (8): a nice smooth bop

**heterosareupseteros** (8): but jesse ware outsold

**hielord** (8): It's a cute song, I'll use it whenever I have a crush on a cute boy

**hunnybee12** (8): a little corny but enjoyable

**pig-serpent** (8): This album has two kinds of songs: songs with bright synths, and songs with bright synths and a funky bassline. The 2nd category is much better.

**TiltControls** (8): Unlike Blinding Lights remix, I'm actually too used to the Doja version where this just seems empty now

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.6): A bit too 80's style for me, but overall solid

# my eyes are closed, i sleep

**outsideeyess** (7.5): a tad cheesy

**Stryxen** (7.5): the brass instrument that I can't identify but cba to look up but also don't want to embarrass myself by getting it wrong 😍😍

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.5): I prefer the remix :/

**fishingfor8** (7): weakest song on the album

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): Another glittery pop song. Not complaining though. Also sax 😍

**nooodisaster** (7): "In your eyes you lie, but I don't let it define you" is such a great line.

**mms82** (6): honestly the better of the basic 80s songs.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): very daft punk-esque production which is nice but this song drags

ignitethephoenix: # sexy sax

**KennyEarthman** (11): I am weak for sax solos.

**2dina3dworld** (10): the sax riff really makes the song

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): That sax. That's it. That's the tweet.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): good morning to saxophone players and them alone

**bulforster** (10): I wasn't fully sold on this at first but I can't deny a song that commits so hard to a sax solo this well.

**ellezol** (10): 🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷

**Flegasaurus** (10): YEAHH YEAH the sax omg

**jayjaysortagay** (10): sax solo slaps

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I audibly gasped and made a stank face when that sax came in

**Roxieloxie** (10): You had my attention left over from Blinding Lights and oh boy did you maintain the energy. The sax alone :weary: I would literally give this an 11 off of that but I will not be the reason that the weeknd looses, splitting 11s is for the dua stans that think love again has a chance in the top 3 and i am not them

**runaway3212** (10): The sax slays me every time

**seanderlust** (10): the sax! I have ascended

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I love the bassline and the sax solo

**TheCatApologist** (10): The sax on this though

**twistedpython** (10): The fact that this song was cannibalized by Blinding Lights is a crime against humanity and the general public deserves to be punished for letting it flop. I miss pop songs with sax solos and I regularly imagine a world in which this was a big hit and revitalized the saxophone trend

**waluigiest** (10): it was almost perfect and then the sax solo brought it up to a 10

**wasian-invasion** (10): best sax solo of the year

**wavingwolves** (10): 🎷🎷🎷🎷🎷

**skargardin** (10): im but a simp of the kenny g remix

**lolcevan** (10): this is the type on song i was hoping to hear on the album going in, but the sax was so unexpected. so fuckin good though omg

**bluepupz** (9.5): This is a bop. I especially like the sax at the end, and I appreciate the smooth and slick production overall.

**shhhneak** (9.2): s e x o p h o n e

**booksandplantsand** (9): saxy!

**just\_thonking** (9): Love the sax

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Sax usually means a pop song will get a good score from me

**vintagebathingsuit** (9): love the funky sax

**wryn\_** (9): all the remixes of this song did not understand the power of that sax solo

**team\_kockroach** (8.9): we stan Kenny G

**relibee2** (8.2): you are all required to talk about the sax at the the end.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): the sax is great

**musical\_pyn** (8): what a good saxophone, I hope he’s doing well

**ryjomom** (8): 🎷🎷🎷Saxy🎷🎷🎷

**SmileAndTears** (8): The sax solo is really nice, but apart from that it’s just kinda… there? Like, the production is really neat and all and it’s catchy but I 100% understand why it wasn’t a hit. It just doesn’t have the same magic Blinding Lights and Save Your Tears have

**Iris3271** (7.5): I don't really get the hype for this one but I do love the sax

**xxrandooxx** (5.8): Love the sexophone!

**hikkaru** (11): While I'm not too surprised this didn't end up winning and frankly didn't expect it to do so at the very beginning of this rate even, there's no way I couldn't give this my 11. I'm not sure if I can think of a song that has hooked me in quite like Physical did when it dropped - every single piece of the song is pure serotonin, energy, and life. The post-apocalyptic dance-until-we-die vibes of the song were quite fitting as the world entered the COVID era but even without its aptness in the current situation, Physical has become one of my absolute favourite songs of all time and is among my most played on last.fm. I'm not one to loop over and over again in such a short period of time very often, but I am not lying when I say I reached 100 scrobbles of it within 24 hours of it releasing, it's just that good. It's pure bombast and exists as a release like none other for me, so I'm very happy it managed to reach the top 5 and perform as well as it did.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I know this is a fan favourite off the album however I don’t think this is one of the best songs off the album. This song I just realized recently is like Cut to the Feeling for me, two bombastic and fun tracks that I think I brought down by the fact the singers are the kind of vocals who can not just belt out a chorus. Still a bop though but there’s something missing from it being a perfect song

**akanewasright** (7): Not gonna lie, this is probably my least favorite of the super successful singles off of FN. I’m not quite sure why it’s shrunk on me, but it really has. This song has been top 4 for nearly the whole rate, but it only got close to winning once, in the very last week. A few final day ballots brought it all the way down to #4, but it was a worthy contender for the win.

ignitethephoenix: # love to exercise

**1998tweety** (11): It was so hard deciding between this and august for my 11 but ultimately i picked Physical cause its more of a p*ssy popper.

**Brendon-Urine** (11): I could probably write an essay on everything that makes this song perfect, but at the same time it's hard to put into words. It's just... perfect. Powerful. Fun. Everything good in the world. It's just one of those songs that I was addicted to as soon as it came out, and I can still listen to it 20 times a day and not get tired of it. The chants of "Baby keep on dancing, LET'S GET PHYSICAL" in the last chorus are just so fucking good. 11/10, love it.

**just\_thonking** (11): This song sounds retro, futuristic, and timeless all at the same time. And the chorus is just so energetic and fun.

**musical\_pyn** (11): my most played song of 2020 for a reason, the song keeps building and building until the final bridge which pushes the song past where I thought it would go into the stratosphere

**NFLfreak98** (11): Dua slaying the bridge on this song makes it the 11

**SmileAndTears** (11): This is like one of the greatest pop songs ever and the fact that it wasn’t at least a moderate hit (in America) remains one of the biggest tragedies in pop music history. Dua sings this song like her life depends on it, like she’s dancing with her lover for the last time. There’s almost a sense of desperation in her voice, like the apocalypse is near. I may not love Future Nostalgia as much as a lot of people do but even I have to admit that she did the thing with this song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): this song was someone's gay awakening

**2dina3dworld** (10): Olivia Newton-John found dead in a ditch!

**Alumineous** (10): This was the first Dua Lipa song I've ever heard. It still blows me away sometimes.

**bbfan132** (10): full-throated synthwave anthem

**bespectacIed** (10): When literally every soul on earth was proclaiming dua as the pop savior because of this, i was so confused, suspicious even. But over time, and a hundred forced replays later, I think I finally got it. Pure pop bliss

**booksandplantsand** (10): a sparkling adrenaline rush!

**brenda\_official** (10): classic but i still wish it was a bit faster

**ColsonBakerr** (10): Again, a bop. Might be my favourite on the album

**cremeebrulee** (10): remember when this dropped and the entire subreddit was just in awe lmao what a day. this song is an absolutely serve and would be an 11 contender for me if the weeknd wasn’t here

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song fucking hits different when you go to the gym. RIP to my short-lived gym days that died because of COVID.

**fallenriot** (10): my favorite on the album, no question. this should’ve been the massive hit

**followingfreeways** (10): holy fuck this song is a full injection of dopamine and i will never get sick of it

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): It is so hard not to give this an 11 it really is.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this is the song that changed my perception of Dua from a basic pop feature to a pop girl. it’s so sticky and flawless. I love the production and the fast paced nature

**ImADudeDuh** (10): god im such a fucking twink

**intheaftermath** (10): i love this song, but there was something so gratifying about that live 2nd place reveal

**J\_Toe** (10): I think the Shakuhachi (Japanese flute) is somehow more 80s than the synth, even. Sounds like the soundtrack to an 80s martial arts video game or movie. Killer song with a killer music video (that's really similar in concept to Stupid Love, only Stupid Love looks cheap in comparison).

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the fresh thread for this is still maybe my proudest moment on this sub

**jasannn** (10): I have sudden urge to workout.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): the upbeat pop song of the decade was released in January 2020,just like Telephone was released in January 2010

**jimmy345960** (10): one of my most played songs last year. great to jam while working out.

**joeeswift** (10): one of the greatest pop songs I’ve ever heard, the production and hook is so perfect. chefs kiss

**jsonphile** (10): I never liked Olivia Newton John’s physical. It always just felt so weak and lifeless, especially for a song that goes “let’s get physical”. A song like that should make me want to move, and the 80’s song never did that. But Dua Lipa’s Physical is exactly what it should be. It’s a rush of adrenaline that makes me want to get up, run, jump, punch a homophobe, anything that involves moving.

**KennyEarthman** (10): the chorus is exquisite

**LesApfels** (10): Literally Perfect

**ManofOranges** (10): I do still really enjoy this one. Come through Olivia Newton John.

**mayolizard** (10): i’m giving it a 10 knowing i’m directly contributing to this probably being #1. ew

**mms82** (10): pop perfection, so close to getting my 11

**moooo566** (10): The work out video she put out for this almost tricked me into exercising.

**MrMoodle** (10): This is so good it makes me angry that her new songs are straying from this direction. I’m sad.

**MrSwearword** (10): the music video was underwhelming [don't let pretty colors fool you] but the song bangs hard and serves all the 1980s tacky aerobics realness we need in the world

**Parabox314** (10): this really is just pure ecstasy. my other 11 at heart.

**pat-rickstar** (10): The bridge. That's it. That's the tweet

**pig-serpent** (10): I will never forgid the general population for letting this song flop

**plastichaxan** (10): this was one of my favorite songs last year, the other pop girlies aren't doing it like this (not even dua herself cause no other song here is at this level lmao)

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): dancing to this song was literally my only physical exercise in lockdown

**ReallyCreative** (10): COVID was unimaginably homophobic for shutting everything down as this song landed

**rickikardashian** (10): this is gay pandering done right >!gay pandering done wrong is Rain On Me!<

**runaway3212** (10): This sounds way too good

**ryjomom** (10): Best Music Video of 2020 awarded by me. I bust every time I hear this song.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This, Blinding Lights and Midnight Sky by Miley were the holy trinity of retro-fresh bops revitalizing the 80s for 2020.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I really have no words this is just so good

**shhhneak** (10): STOP THE RIDE I’M GOING TO DIE

**skargardin** (10): putting physical and levitating on the album back to back.. whew

**Tedyonce** (10): perfect song

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (10): oh my god I love this.

**thePotatofairyy** (10): Easily one of the greatest songs I've heard in the past 5 years. An visual aesthetic sonically. Stupid catchy, every element complements each other, peaks and valleys of the song create an outstanding build. By the end you just feel the adrenaline. I haven't loved a song like this one in years

**twistedpython** (10): Pop perfection

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): banger

**wailord\_fan** (10): This just feels so gritty. Love it.

**wasian-invasion** (10): The underlying instrumental feels oddly ominous lol. Only complaint is the second verse but the bridge and music video make up for it

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): The intensity of this song... unmatched!

ignitethephoenix: **RandomHypnotica** (9.9): If you told me this was a cut Emotion track I'd believe you

**vagenda** (9.6): Icon, legend, the moment, etc.

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): This deserved to be a way bigger hit.

**aladreeladon** (9.5): Yes Dua, as you should

**cocosairdep** (9.5): This chorus is just perfect. The workout video > mv btw.

**fedefreakss** (9.5): my most listened to song is 2020, yep

**mysario** (9.5): in an alternate universe, this was overplayed anywhere. but we live in this universe, the one where this saw like a month of airplay and was promptly forgotten by everyone in favour of lesser singles

**nooodisaster** (9.5): The absolute serve, it'd be so funny if this Slumber Party'd. The energy here is just insane, like I actually consider exercising when I listen to this.

**seanderlust** (9.5): group fitness class instructors rushing to add this to their playlist before everyone else: https://media.tenor.com/images/0a6b62cd300320768c6034557a5171ac/tenor.gif

**whyishestaring** (9.5): That "LET'S GET PHYSICAL!" is constantly playing in my head.

**bluepupz** (9): I can't stop myself from dancing to this. Would be great for one of those cardio dance workout classes!

**ChandelierFlickering** (9): so much fun

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I don’t know, I think this has worn off on me? I never come back to this after listening to the rest of Future Nostalgia, but whenever it comes on I bop my bussy out mama yes gawd pop off sis tongue pop sksksksksksksksk so true bestie.

**Flegasaurus** (9): this song is such a banger!! also this reminded me that on CFN there's a remix with gwen stefani and i just wanna say i don't think gwen fits on physical at all

**frogaranaman** (9): that bridge where she’s basically just yelling so genuinely so fucking cathartic LMFAO

**static\_int\_husp** (9): overrated tbh

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): i didn't like it until it came on in the gym and it just clicked lmao

**wavingwolves** (9): that bridge was infused with some kind of illegal substance i know it

**xxrandooxx** (9): music video made my pussy throb

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.8): #JusticeForPhysical

**lillipup03** (8): Admittedly I don’t love this one as much as y’all seem to, but it’s definitely grown on me since release.

**mythicalbeaste** (8): this album is banger after banger after banger

**vayyiqra** (8): Yet another witty comment about Olivia Newton-John and how this outsold etc.

**waluigiest** (8): she really released two songs deeply inspired by Olivia Newton John’s Physical in the same year, huh

**camerinian** (7.5): On paper this is right up my alley, but this is one of the most obviously derivative songs on the album, and it's kinda nothing new, even though it does what it wants to do really well.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): this should have got the radio support don't start now got.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This was like my third most played song of 2020 and I don't even like it that much

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): it's a good song but it's not the second coming of christ ya'll make it out to be

**TiltControls** (7.5): I used to love the song more, but it's almost... too 80's if that makes sense. I still like it, don't get me wrong, but it's not as great as I thought it once was

# olivia newton john outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it gets old quick but it’s still a bop

**fishingfor8** (7): most overrated song on popheads. Half this album is better than this

**lolcevan** (7): i’m not too crazy for this song like most of popheads is lol weird choice for second single too

**rslashpoopheads** (7): solid bop

**Stryxen** (7): the bridge carries this

**Awkward\_King** (6): its about sex

**Roxieloxie** (4.5): Im not even trying to be edgy with this score, This song really just does nothing for me. It feels like an in universe song on a tv show but shoving this inbetween cool and levitating which are both such peaks for the album, this is just so meh to me

**Bajuko** (4): Wasn’t a fan of the loud chorus, this one didn’t really click with me

**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): my friends literally asked me to change the song the first time i played this on aux. olivia newton john remains unbothered and in great shape.

**bulforster** (0): I don't understand what I'm missing here, for a song winking at Olivia Newton John's it sure is having no fun at all with it.

**hikkaru** (10): It's obviously expected that this would make it to the top 5 with a really high average, and it obviously deserves that! From the moment the rumours of Dua's disco era began spreading around and when this absolute banger dropped in November of 2019, Popheads were fully on board the Future Nostalgia train and this was a hell of a way to kick it off. The production is so crisp and infectious from the delicious use of bass to the gorgeous piano chords and string sections. Upon first hearing this track I knew for sure this was going to be an era to watch out for and here we are now over a year later, where Dua has won a Grammy for the album and is one of the most beloved artists among pop fans.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This was perfect lead single for Dua. The throwback instrumental and structure of the song suits her so well and this was such a surprising and refreshing sound for her coming off her last album. This is what got everyone excited for FN and it definitely lived up to those expectations based off this song.

**akanewasright** (8): Oh yes, the song of legend. The tune that completely changed the Dua discourse with one live performance, the lyrics that soundtracked a thousand memes, the melody that kickstarted one of the most notable pop eras we’ve seen in recent years, out at #3. This song was winning in the first 20-30 ballots or so (aka the ballots I got on the first day submissions were open), but it fell and never really recovered. It got as high as #2 over the last few days, but it was never quite able to win again.

=====

ignitethephoenix: # don't start me now im having a good time, I'm having a ball

**nootnoot781** (11): i mean if i can listen to a song more than 2,100 times over and still enjoy it each listen, i think i should probably give it my 11. (hope blinding wins though!!)

**ryjomom** (11): This is legitimately my most played song of the last 2 years. The beat, the lyrics, the drop, the bass, the cowbell, the dancing, the performances, the era, the bridge, the club. I will forever be indebted to Miss Lupa for this serve. Studio 2054 for life.

**shesdoingyoga** (11): There were several other songs in this rate that could have gotten my 11, but I did a full 180 and decided to give it to this one since it signaled the start of one of my most anticipated albums/eras ever. Dua’s debut made me a huge fan and I had been waiting since 2017 to see what she would do with her next album, and she absolutely did not disappoint.

**waluigiest** (11): it’s flawless. Every part of its construction just works: it’s effortlessly jammable, the instrumental accents keep it fresh, dua’s voice is in a perfect range for her. I’m thankful that I got to experience this song at a few parties before everything was shut down, as the song was meant to be heard.

**1998tweety** (10): pop excellence, i streamed this song like crazy the day and week it dropped. earworm front to back

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): The song that kicked off her FN era. Her 2019 EMA performance still lives rent free in my head.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): How did she do this, it’s so good

**aladreeladon** (10): Apparently my most-listened song of the year

**bbfan132** (10): i wish this had the intro from the live in la remix but it’s still a perfect dance track

**bespectacIed** (10): Dictionary definition of pop perfection. "Did a whole 180 crazy" is so hilarious now because it happened TWICE in her career. First her artistry from meh to amazing, and then her image from likeable to covid superspreader

**bluepupz** (10): I didn't need to do a full 180 to appreciate this song lol. I was really impressed with Dua when this first came out!

**booksandplantsand** (10): absolutely ICONIC first single, still perfection

**celladonn** (10): So fun, so quotable, so addictive

**cocosairdep** (10): I’ll never get tired of this one.

**ColsonBakerr** (10): YESS DUA YOU TELL HIM!!!! Bop. SOTY

**cremeebrulee** (10): this as a lead single was so correct. it really is a perfect song.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this score is dedicated to the cowbell

**frogaranaman** (10): this song was fun to hear at the gay bear bars

**hhiggy** (10): i really don't trust you if you don't like this

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): This was a legitimate cultural reset. Even the straights were shook. Also gave birth to one of my favorite memes on r/popheadscirclejerk

**hunnybee12** (10): immediate smash

**J\_Toe** (10): somehow I thought this was only average on initial release? I think because of the music video, but it grew on me more and more. The LA live rollerblade version may have helped persuade me.

**jasannn** (10): Did a half 360

**KennyEarthman** (10): there's a reason this was trending

**Misentro** (10): The staying power this has!

**MrSwearword** (10): the moment Dua said "fuck your faves, I've arrived"

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is one of those songs I knew was going to be a hit the moment I heard it

**mythicalbeaste** (10): iconic at this point

**nooodisaster** (10): The start of one of the most exciting pop eras of the last few years. This song was, is, and will be EVERYTHING. The way she's literally shit talking stan twitter for making fun of her, and references her reinvention in the very reinvention itself??? Mozart couldn't.

**outsideeyess** (10): the disco references are everything, what a perfect song

**pat-rickstar** (10): It's going to be so hard to not give 10s to all the singles on this album

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): I’m so sorry

**pig-serpent** (10): This song took much longer to grow on me than the rest of the excellent songs on this album,

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The only version of this I care about: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheadscirclejerk/comments/j1sixn/happy_25k_members_yall/

**rickikardashian** (10): it’s wild to think how different life was when this released. i still remember sitting on my bedroom floor getting ready listening to this, angry as all shit that i wasnt the one that had this bassline

**rslashpoopheads** (10): honestly this song is just alright until you hit the bridge and then it's literally fcking orgasmic

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song may have grown off me for a while but i am starting to like it again

**skargardin** (10): bonafide bop

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Dua could have taken her own advice this last year...

**Stryxen** (10): genuinely a perfect song although that bass cover on youtube elevates it to another level and I listen to that quite a lot

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): nothing to say about this song that hasn't been said - absolutely deserved it success

**TiltControls** (10): 180

**vayyiqra** (10): A true SLAPPER. Also spawned a few decent memes, which I always appreciate.

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): Dua should take her own advice and don't come out as often as she does... the song's amazing tho

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): What a song to kick of your new era.

**hielord** (9.8): Dua making this song the first single of the album was the correctest decision she has ever made

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): the classic itself. It's fun, it's vibey and when you put it on at parties (that I totally go to) everyone goes crazy.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9.5): I would give this a ten but it was so overplayed. Solid, solid song though.

**ChandelierFlickering** (9.5): such a great start to the era

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): I want to go back to when this dropped and I was happy (Also Live in LA OUTSOLD!)

**mayolizard** (9.5): grew off a bit

**vagenda** (9.5): It’s crazy how this song is completely immune to overexposure. I haven’t stopped hearing it since October 2019 and I’m not even close to sick of it

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): Iconic. For some reason this didn’t bop as hard on this listen.

**wryn\_** (9.5): obviously great but the live in la remix >>>>>>

**mms82** (9.4): what a great choice for a lead single and a great song

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): sabotaging this a little purely because it being in the rate we sent to indieheads exposed how inferior it is to Physical/Levitating, deal accordingly

**astrologicalangel** (9): overplay aside, this is a really great song

**bulforster** (9): I miss clubs...

**fallenriot** (9): a bop, reminds me of a simpler time

**fishingfor8** (9): way overplayed but I won't dock points for it

**runaway3212** (9): What's 1+8+0

**SmileAndTears** (9): Homophobic queen

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): I can see teen girls vibing to this in their bad bitch playlist

**twistedpython** (9): I love an immortal hit even if overplay makes it hard to get through these days. I know in a year, when this song is ancient history, I'll come back to it and love it but for now...

**vintagebathingsuit** (9): a bit overplayed but still a bop

=====

ignitethephoenix: **guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.9): the bass in this is just insane

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a grower! the anti-chorus is still a little lacking the 2nd time around but the final chorus is really good

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): perfect music for browsing the fine wares on the rack at Zara

**mysario** (8.1): gave this songs score a full 180

**Alumineous** (8): I still wish this song went to number one. It DESERVED IT.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): She dropped one hell of a bombshell with this.

**Flegasaurus** (8): this is a bop but its way overplayed and i'm kinda sick of hearing it on the radio every 5 seconds

**ManofOranges** (8): Loved, loved, loved this song when it first came out. I was ALL over it. It quickly became one of my most scrobbled songs if I'm not mistaken. But by this point, my love for it has lessened somewhat. I still hear the good in it but I'm just not getting the same feelings that I got when I listened to this song for the first ~100 times, probably because I wore myself out with it. Still a good song though. Also, obligatory "did a full 180" or something.

**seanderlust** (8): a bop but the cowbell during the chorus is always so distracting

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): Okay it's a bop. Not really to my taste, but I imagine it works well in a club.

**wavingwolves** (8): every time i hear this song now i think of this https://youtu.be/ocaA2i4XQHQ

# stop at this moment

**jimmy345960** (7.5): overplayed and its a similar problem with blinding lights. great song, loved it in november 2019.

**wailord\_fan** (7.5): I just know the gays are going to overhype this song. The look of the performances of this song are much better than the song itself. Revenge bodies are one thing, Dua did a revenge performance, with the award show performance with the stacks of chairs, she told Stan twitter to eat their hearts out. There is a genuine drop in appreciation of this song with how overplayed it got, mostly due to how weak I find the verses, but the chorus' downbeat start is great, but again, a lack of a bridge, just not my thing? She has better pop moments in the rest of the album.

**xxrandooxx** (7.5): I did a youtube music reaction video to this dressed as a dead crackhead with fake blood coming out of my nose… good song Ru Paul shade rattle tease.

**intheaftermath** (7): I liked this more initially, but now that I've seen how much she has to offer on the other tracks, I'm not as big of a fan

**NotWith10000Men** (7): a banger but sooooo overplayed

**Roxieloxie** (7): So not to be a 'this was overplayed for me' person, but this was over played for me, specifically by my roommate in our dorm right before covid happened. I cant hear this song without being transported to that tiny room where it was always burning up in there. This isnt bad but its far from the best song on this album

**thePotatofairyy** (7): Said it before and ill say it again. The chorus bring it down for me by a lot. The verses are crazy catchy with a great prechorus but the actually chorus does absolutely nothing for me. Amazing song otherwise

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): did a full 360, crazy 😌 this song is nice, but looking back on it now a year later it feels a lot weaker than I remembered.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this song was meh for me since it came out that I’m honestly surprised the overplay didn’t make me hate it more

**rosecult** (6): i still believe don't shart now was the wrong first single choice and this album would've been even bigger with a diff lead single

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): it's difficult because i dont think its bad at all just... on an album that's so sonically similar it doesn't stand out to me, perfect lead single choice tho

**givebackmysweatshirt** (5): whelming, middling, average. it's like eating white bread with mayonnaise on it

**LesApfels** (5): This song wishes it had what Physical has

**akanewasright** (10): This 10 could be for the synth line alone and it would still completely worth every point. I listened to the Song Exploder podcast episode about this song, and reportedly it took the producer like 10 years to track down this one synth keyboard, and that one line was the first thing he recorded when he finally had it. This has been the sub’s favorite FN song since the album dropped essentially, and it being the highest placing FN song feels right to me.

**hikkaru** (10): This is an absolute SMASH and I totally see why it instantly became the #1 fan favourite from Future Nostalgia upon the album's release. It's pure bliss and infectious as all hell from beginning to end, and it certaintly makes me feel electric and want to dance my ass off. While I do prefer the DaBaby remix at this point, there's no way I couldn't give this a 10 and I'm more than happy with it being Dua's highest placing song and the runner up of the rate. Let's see how it does in AS5!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): My other 11 contender (if we banned men from ultimates this would be been my 11), this song is one of the highlights of the album for me. Dua does these type of songs masterfully, ones where she talk sings and just grooves on the beat. I love the little pulsing hums / beatsthroughout the song and it just works so well with the melody and quirks Beginning to end, there’s nothing I would change about this tune ~~except adding Dababy even though it’s a 10 either way~~

ignitethephoenix: # my wig is levitating

**bespectacIed** (11): Nothing to say except the unbridled euphoria of this song helped me not to kms during the first few months of the pandemic

**celladonn** (11): Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!! Intergalactic pop perfection and my fourth most played song last year, I'm dahncing my arse off as we speak

**ellezol** (11): spotify payola ensures i listen to this at least once a day and bitch i'm still not tired of it

**hielord** (11): I had to do it, I need to give my 11 to her. I never thought I would be stanning a song so hard as I did with Levitating. It just makes me feel like I'm floating in sky, is exactly what I needed in quarantine.

**jasannn** (11): I've been dancing to this song since the day the album dropped. clap clap.

**lolcevan** (11): what more is there to say lol perfect song

**outsideeyess** (11): ok sorry for the basic pick but like.... THIS SLAPS! it never won't!

**wasian-invasion** (11): Goddamn this song makes my body move, even with all the overplay

**wryn\_** (11): unironically one of the greatest pop songs of all time. just every aspect is astonishing

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (11): it just pop perfection. There’s truly nothing else to say.

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): mlyooveislikeaorcketwatchit blast off and im feelingsoedlcetricdancemy ass off yeah yeah yeah yeah

**bbfan132** (10): it’s a bop, it’s a bop

**bluepupz** (10): This is a really funky song, I love it. I know there's literally another song on the album called Cool but this sounds really cool and effortless.

**BookyCats** (10): (the beat is just fire)

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): my absolute fave from FN

**CHRMbishop** (10): overplayed but still a banger

**cocosairdep** (10): Amazing song. If it wasn’t for BL this would’ve been my 11.

**cremeebrulee** (10): when dua made this a single i was soooo excited because it was my favorite from the album release day. i love the carefree energy and the fun lyrics. if dua were to win, i hope it’s this track!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is the best song on the album. No, this is not a point up for debate.

**followingfreeways** (10): this is the 11 of this album. if folklore didn't exist this would have my 11. this is one of the best pop songs released in the past five years without a doubt. i don't know how she did it

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): This is only getting the 10 because of the British accent rapping.

**Iris3271** (10): This is the song that made me appreciate Dua

**jayjaysortagay** (10): the runner up for my 11

**lillipup03** (10): The DaBaby remix would’ve gotten my 11... I still fucking love this song but his verse took it to a whole new level.

**ManofOranges** (10): Over time, this song has actually come to be my favorite song on the album, honestly. I think most people share this opinion too, judging by the results of the Dua Top 10 Pop 10. And who can blame us for thinking it? This song is pure euphoria when you're listening. The name is apt because you really do feel weightless when you're listening to this song, like you're could just take off and never come down again. Dua got lightning in a bottle with this one.

**Misentro** (10): Highlight of the album; it's pop perfection. There's so many amazing moments, the double claps, "My sugarboo", "Woo!", the bridge, every second keeps you engaged. Barely missed my 11.

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm gushing about the original here, but it is so fucking good and Daft Punk adjacent which is always welcome, please god let Daft Punk X Dua Lipa happen.

**NFLfreak98** (10): Soo close to 11, but the bridge here is ever-so-slightly worse than on Physical

**nootnoot781** (10): the first time listening to this song was my serotonin boost of 2020

**pheromenos** (10): i wish i could have made it lev1tat1ng tho

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Remix > Original. This version always felt like it was just missing something, and DaBaby being added really helps it to feel full, listening to this version again just feels weird (but this is still 10 worthy)

**ReallyCreative** (10): really want to go out to a bar and make out with some strangers to this

**rosecult** (10): pop perfection even after being ruined by two bad remixes!!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): god the synths are so fucking addicting they just get better every listen

**ryjomom** (10): The instrument makes my pu$$y throb on beat. Also Gigi Goode & Symone ate this song up. Plus, she levitated at the AMAs.

**seeyanever** (10): Ladies I'm levitating

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I’m kind of rooting for this to win even though something else got my 11, this ended up being my most listened to song off of the album in 2020

**sirpancakeXI** (10): am i allowed to say that the dababy feature make me enjoy the original song even more

**skargardin** (10): instant serotonin noitstrue

**static\_int\_husp** (10): You Want Me! I Want You Baby!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): best song on the album, the replayability (probs not a word lol) of this song is insane

**TiltControls** (10): I want to sooo badly give this an 11. I haven't heard a bop this hard in a long time

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): the opening synths live in my head rent-free

**vayyiqra** (10): feelin so electric dance my ahse off

**waluigiest** (10): it’s just so fun!! It somehow is a party of a song and not just a song to be played at parties, if that makes sense

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): I love any kind of lyrics about space + the Dua flair on this song is just off the charts

**mayolizard** (9.7): it’s just really good

**camerinian** (9.5): Great tune, massive groove, iconic bridge. Not a 10 though because DaBaby is genuinely the missing piece and no I'm not kidding.

**KennyEarthman** (9.5): it's good but I overplayed it so...

**MrMoodle** (9.5): This is great but the DaBaby version is better don’t @ me

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): I didn’t realise I preferred the Dababy version until I listened to this again and I was expecting him to come in on the second verse? Feels a little empty without him now

**pig-serpent** (9.5): You know, this one grew off me, and is much better without DaBaby (Nothing agaisnt DaBaby, I just don' like rap and disco together.)

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9.2): It's such a mindless bop I love it

**AHSWeeknd** (9): seriously iconic

**jimmy345960** (9): marvelous song.

**jsonphile** (9): if this song comes on my body immediately starts moving even if I’m not actively listening to it

**mms82** (9): great song, but is definitely missing something without the blessed madonna/madonna/missy Elliot or DaBaby

**musical\_pyn** (9): I can’t give this a 10 when the dababy remix AKA the better song exists

**nooodisaster** (9): The low-tone "ooooh"s aren't talked about enough but really are the "ch-ch" of this album.

**Roxieloxie** (9): Ah yes the second song on future nostalgia that really stuck on me. This song, like cool, is just pure summer fun the fact that we were robbed from people able to blast this in the car with friends is honestly a disservice

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): a very valentine song, its cute, I like it.

**twistedpython** (9): Pop perfection again but minus a point because the word sugaboo gives me nightmares

ignitethephoenix: **alwayswords** (8.7): points off for the bridge

**Flegasaurus** (8.5): ok cool, but how is dua lipa levitating? is she keeping some revolutionary technology hidden away from the rest of the world? love the bridge

**LesApfels** (8.5): Dua just keeps levitating from one country to another

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I usually hate hand claps and yeah yeahs but they really hit here

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this song is honestly so amazingly good, and i have given 10s to songs that have done much less than this…. but, I heard the [Hot Knife mashup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b9j7ihyxzY) once, and it just made me realize how much better the song could have been if it had done something more interesting vocally. The production is doing all of the work (and it's doing an amazing job at it, because it's honestly one of the best instrumentals for a pop song in a long time)

**runaway3212** (8.5): would've been a 10 if it was the dababy remix

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): great hook but kinda drags in the middle. good thing it got a remix that corrected that!

**booksandplantsand** (8): bubbly and fun

**ColsonBakerr** (8): I know people love this and it IS good but never grew on me that much

**DaHumanTorch** (8): am i the only one who thinks both the blessed madonna / dababy remixes are better than this? this was like a 9.5 until those superior versions came out

**fishingfor8** (8): honestly the dababy version is better. I have so much energy going into the 2nd verse in that version. I don't wanna listen to 20 different remixes though so my thoughts for the Remix goes here.

**mythicalbeaste** (8): but I think I like the DaBaby version more

**Stryxen** (8): Levit8ing BUT if this is anywhere near top 2 I will just turn my computer off and walk away

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): kinda overrated. Its catchy, but it sounds like one of those songs that you release as a single just to get some radioplay.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): got a little stale, but honestly this song gave me hope in stage one of quarantine. devastated I haven’t heard this in a club yet

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Honestly never understood why everyone adores this song. Like, it’s good but I don’t hear what y’all hear

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): fun. but both remixes >>>

# nailed to the ground

**Awkward\_King** (7): it is a nice song..

**brenda\_official** (7): i really hope this doesn’t win

**givebackmysweatshirt** (7): dababy helps this song a lot ngl

**J\_Toe** (7): with every big pop release r/popheads nominates one track as the favourite, and speaks about it as if it were dogma. Usually even if I', not a fan I can at least see why, but Levitating has always sounded average to me, and Hallucinate sounds way better. The more this song has been pushed and remixed, the less I like it.

**wailord\_fan** (7): You know a remix is good when DaBaby's intro is what I am expecting now, and the song feels hollow without his parts.

**fallenriot** (6): this song loses points simply because i hate the word sugarboo

**frogaranaman** (6): Levitation (from Latin levitas "lightness")[1] is the process by which an object is held aloft, without mechanical support, in a stable position. Levitation is accomplished by providing an upward force that counteracts the pull of gravity (in relation to gravity on earth), plus a smaller stabilizing force that pushes the object toward a home position whenever it is a small distance away from that home position. The force can be a fundamental force such as magnetic or electrostatic, or it can be a reactive force such as optical, buoyant, aerodynamic, or hydrodynamic.[citation needed] Levitation excludes floating at the surface of a liquid because the liquid provides direct mechanical support. Levitation excludes hovering flight by insects, hummingbirds, helicopters, rockets, and balloons because the object provides its own counter-gravity force.[citation needed]

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I’m sorry, but what did y’all see in this that y’all called this the best song on the album? The Dababy remix is good but this song is just so bare bones

**mysario** (6): wow... have y'all heard "California Girls" without Snoop Dogg? "Bad Blood" without Kendrick Lamar? "Stereo Hearts" without Travie McCoy? this is that same cursed energy. I genuinely forgot how boring this song feels without DaBaby hyping it up that little extra push

**vintagebathingsuit** (6): bit too cheesy for me :/

**wavingwolves** (6): i miss dababy

**team\_kockroach** (2.5): Hot take, but I don't like the speak-singing verses or the thudding beat

**akanewasright** (11): As the person collecting scores, I can personally say that I don’t think any song was ever going to beat this. Don’t Start Now was beating the song like 24 hours after the rate was announced, and never again. Its lead kept growing and growing, to the point where the song getting a 0 barely affected its lead. The whole time, I was expecting a barrage of late ballots giving this song 2s and 3s, calling it overplayed or whatever, but like… they never really showed up en masse. It’s lead just kept growing and growing. I had thought (and hoped) that this would win, but I honestly expected there to be more competition. You could call this winner boring or expected, but I prefer to call it right. You can’t get mad at a predictable winner when a record breaking number of people called this song their very favorite.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Well here we are at last. Our rate winner! This pretty much never left the top spot the entire time, even with multiple 0’s at one point! And honestly it’s 100% deserving of a win. This is a triumph of a song, a perfect tribute to 80’s synth pop with a modern twist. I get why this has been in the top 10 on the charts for a year straight, it has massive appeal and definitely will be known as his signature song from this point on. It was a streaming hit, a tik tok hit and a radio hit which I think is a trifecta that is super rare to have these days. This truly is a perfect pop song I’m somehow not sick of yet (even if I think it’s somewhat overplayed at this point). And although the Grammys snubbed him, I’m glad popheads decided not to and recognized him in our fun little way.

**hikkaru** (10): So here it is, the winner of the 2020 Ultimate Rate! I don't think this comes as a surprise at all, however adored Dua's singles are, because this is just a song that it seems impossible to dislike (unless you're someone that listens to the radio a lot and gets affected by overplay). But the thing is that this is a rare song that 100% deserves every bit of overplay its received on the radio, every single one of those over 2 million Spotify streams, and every single week it's spent on the Hot 100 and specifically in the top 10 where it's broken a multitude of records and, as of writing this, is incredibly close to beating The Twist for earning the title of the #1 most popular song ever. I'm absolutely ecstatic to give it the crown because there's just no other song in this rate that would feel as apt with the win.

ignitethephoenix: # My favourite humans in the world thank you for your service

**2dina3dworld** (11): if this doesn't win, then there's something afoot

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): LET US PREVA11L AGA11NST M11SANDRY.

**AHSWeeknd** (11): I was gonna give my eleven to the AH title track but nah this deserves it

**aliensexist** (11): I just love it so much. And the video is amazing

**astrologicalangel** (11): I could listen to this a million times (and I probably have) without ever getting tired of it

**bbfan132** (11): of course this is getting my 11 lmao

**camerinian** (11): It's just self-evidently perfect. It's a pop song that is inspired by the classics, yet imbues the essence of its artist to such a T that it never feels like it's just a throwback or nostalgia pandering. It's high-octane, urgent, and longing, but never fully reaching its target, meaning you just want more and more of it time after time. Every line is evocative, every burst of loudness from the synths or the drums going into the chorus hits like a fucking meteor impact, and every melody line is icy, but the thrill of the rush means any side-emotion is second to the utter desperation. It is spellbinding from beginning to end and I think it would take another year in the top 10 before I even got remotely sick of it. This song is a juggernaut, and really should be the ultimate winner. There is not and may never be anything else like it

**cocosairdep** (11): This is a classic already. It deserves to win. You better not sabotage this you misandrists!

**cremeebrulee** (11): i mean, its a reset / a collapse / modern classic etc etc. watching this song absolutely dominate the past year was so great because it’s such a bop and so fun to root for. yeah if this wins its gonna be an obvious winner but sometimes the obvious winner IS the right one (also bets on where this is gonna be during reveal week on the bb100, i’m thinking #7)

**CrimsonROSET** (11): remember when he pushed heartless as a single first and literally everyone and their mother called him stupid for not pushing this and how it might flop then it became the most successful song of all time

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this is the only correct winner tbh

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): This is the most important cultural remnant of the pre-COVID world.

**fishingfor8** (11): the obvious choice song of 2020, best song by far from the year and already somehow a timeless classic.

**frogaranaman** (11): so good that I played this back twice when going through and rating the album. just like The Twist, this is absolutely deserved to be one of the biggest hits in American history

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): the scammys pretend they did not see this

**hunnybee12** (11): only worthy winner

**ImADudeDuh** (11): an underrated bop

**jackisboredtoday** (11): This song will outlive everyone in the sub currently, and it deserves to because its genuinely that good

**jsonphile** (11): Is giving Blinding Lights my 11 probably the most obvious, cliche choice on here? Yes. Am I going to do it anyway? Yes. This song is literally pop perfection (and okay part of that is I’m just a sucker for 80’s music)

**ManofOranges** (11): Honestly, there were LOTS of choices for 11s in this rate. August, Levitating, Rain on Me, and so many more. But this song just has to get mine. Every time I think I'm over this song, I give it another listen and realize that I'm SO not over this song. It sounds ageless, timeless, and flawless. It has that it factor that all these other girls WISH they had. The Weeknd has struck gold with this one.

**mysario** (11): to the people who gave this a low score: do you not like how much this song has been played everywhere or do you genuinely not like the song? like many people, I got sick of this song's presence being everywhere and having to non stop listen to it all the time. however, I eventually flipped back to normal. there's a reason this song will stand the test of time and be fondly remembered for years to come and why people are upset that this is being snubbed from the Grammys. the production, the melody, the faux nostalgia - it has it all for a perfect pop song! in the ultimate of ultimate of pop songs of 2020 (as decided by the heads of Popheads I guess), this is the best song to rise out of them all. so I ask again to the low scorers: do you not like how much more airplay this has gotten than "Cruel Summer" or do you genuinely believe this song is worse than interludes and a children's choir?

**NotWith10000Men** (11): this is the only song I can think of where EVERY TIME I hear it I go "oh man I love this song." I've had it on repeat for a year and some change and I don't see that changing anytime soon. That bridge?!?! The way he says "LIIiights" right after? Inject it into my veins

**pat-rickstar** (11): Sometimes the most obvious choice is the best one. One of the best hit songs ever

**ReallyCreative** (11): singlehandedly made "main pop girl" a gender-neutral accolade

**Roxieloxie** (11): I mean we already know this isnt gonna win because tk gave it his 11 However I hope this song does well in the end. Its so fun and infectious. End of 2019/early 2020 I ended up listening to top 40 radio because of a different story of me trying to win concert tickets, that i will not be telling here. But any time this song came on you couldnt help but being happy with it. Also can we talk about how the transition into this song is literally iconic

**rslashpoopheads** (11): SOTAT (Song Of The All Time)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Fun fact about Blinding Lights: it was produced by Oscar Holter of Necro Facility, a little-known electro-industrial band whose music I used to bop to in 2012. Definitely the closest anyone from that scene has come to mainstream success since Dave Ogilvie of Skinny Puppy mixed Call Me Maybe. This is a perfect pop song that comes from the heart while being tightly crafted, and incorporates details from different genres and eras while sounding timeless.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): a real underdog is this rate i bet

**seanderlust** (11): i think mic the snare said it best when he said that he first heard this and assumed the instrumental was a ripoff of another 80s song, until he went looking and realized that "abel and co had written a song so perfect in its hookiness and simplicity that the fact that it hasn't existed until now is a travesty"

**skargardin** (11): modern classic alert

**static\_int\_husp** (11): If I can hear this non-stop for a whole-ass year and still love it, it should probably be my 11

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): nothing but respect for MY song of 2020. the song is practically perfect (think we've discussed it enough), but placing it after Faith in the tracklist provides a completely different take on the song. genius.

**TheCatApologist** (11): Me after going out into the sun after weeks in lockdown

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i actually wasn't totally on board with this until months after it hit #1 but yes now i see that it is a flawless pop song. if this loses i will be very upset

**WhyDidEverIBother** (11): My most played song of last year, so essentially, I am a basic bitch and Max Martin owns my soul.

ignitethephoenix: # A bunch of other tasteful people

**1998tweety** (10): obligatory 10, pop excellence

**bespectacIed** (10): As much as I want Levitating to win, I can't sabotage the rate winner. Flawless song. Song of the century. LOONABOYZ WORLD DOMINATION if u know u know

**bluepupz** (10): Still a 10 despite the fact that I have heard this song every time I've turned on my car's radio for the past year lol. I loved this when it came out, but I never thought that it would have the chart dominance that it's had. Deserved!

**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): Somehow I haven't gotten sick of this song even though it's so overplayed. Truly timeless

**booksandplantsand** (10): this song cannot be overplayed or overpraised fuck the scammys

**CarlieScion** (10): this will win and we will all sit there and say thank you

**celladonn** (10): A cultural reset and a perfect song

**ColsonBakerr** (10): I mean come on man the Grammy's don't deserve this

**CritneySpearz** (10): still so good

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): If you want to see why I consider The Weeknd as the real main pop boy, Blinding Lights is the reason why. I have always liked Abel and Max Martin together because Martin brings out Abel's pop side in the best way possible that still very much The Weeknd. Given how this has been a top 10 hit for a year now and people aren't tired of it yet is impressive. This is definitely The Weeknd's signature hit and I will be happy if this song won the rate.

**fallenriot** (10): it doesn’t have the insane replay value for me that it seems to for most people, but still a banger

**Flegasaurus** (10): we are only 1 year into the 20s but this is already one of the most iconic hits of the decade, this is what we're gonna be showing our grandkids when we're all old and retired

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): where can i sign the petition to ban anyone who gave this song lower than a 9.5

**hhiggy** (10): what else is there to say

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Relatable because it's probs not too long before my phone screen's light makes me go blind a-yo!

**intheaftermath** (10): Everyday I think about the Superbowl performance with the added bass singers on the chorus. Easily one of (if not the) best radio hit of the year

**Iris3271** (10): Fuck the scammys

**J\_Toe** (10): brilliant song, but I can't help but feel the music video is a covert car ad

**jasannn** (10): Our main pop bpy.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): easy 10, even though my heart/11 belongs to another song, hope you win bro

**jexan13** (10): deserves the win

**jledzz** (10): ooooooooooooooo im blind

**just\_thonking** (10): I feel like the melody of Blinding Lights wasn't actually written, it was discovered. Like it has always existed latently in every single person's brain since the dawn of time and the Weeknd was just the one to unearth it

**KennyEarthman** (10): pop perfection. a masterpiece

**ktajlili** (10): A year ago I would have said 8/10 but in the context of the album it's flawless. This is when the character officially goes insane from his binger.

**lillipup03** (10): Fuck the Grammys.

**lolcevan** (10): the transition/opening to this song was so euphoric that it made me raise the score, although i kind of forgot how good it is just in general

**mayolizard** (10): fuck if i could just give several 11’s

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (10): An absolute crowning jewel of this record. Of his career. It upsets me greatly that the rest of the record doesn't hit this high again, for me.

**Misentro** (10): Invented vibes, and vibing. He sounds so good!

**moooo566** (10): This one is really good! It feels like

**MrSwearword** (10): the vocals are not that good but I can overlook that because the song knocks

**musical\_pyn** (10): It’s really weird to look back and think that we were worried heartless would be a bigger hit lol. Also, how does this sound even better in the context of the album??

**mythicalbeaste** (10): omg my foot started tapping before I realized what I was doing

**NFLfreak98** (10): One of like 3 absolutely perfect pop songs in this rate

**nootnoot781** (10): i know the phrase “modern classic” is overused but like… this is still going to be played 50 years from now. birthdays, weddings, NYEs. real king shit

**outsideeyess** (10): fucking incredible and one of his best songs

**Parabox314** (10): i don't know how but this never gets old. deserves to win but popheads is manphobic so we'll see.

**plastichaxan** (10): the status as one of the biggest hits ever is more than deserved, he really served here

**rickikardashian** (10): the second reason as to why i hate Taylor being in this rate is that it prevents me from giving this an 11

**rosecult** (10): king of longevity

**runaway3212** (10): This song has not gotten stale 1 and a half year after it's been released and I've been listening to it a lot too. It's just that high quality

**SmileAndTears** (10): I had a whole thinkpiece prepared explaining why Max Martin’s production made this a 9.7 instead of a 10 but I just gave up cuz it was way too long and unnecessary and stupid (plz let this win so we can put a term to misandry on r/popheads)

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (10): surprise, surprise.

**TiltControls** (10): i feel like this rate is just seeing what we can sandwich between blinding lights and boys will be boys

**vayyiqra** (10): synthpop good basic take yes I know

**waluigiest** (10): what else is there to say about this perfect song

**wasian-invasion** (10): the official music video https://twitter.com/thelindsayellis/status/1344047338004774912?lang=en

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): I mean... the ultimate song of 2020 can't get anything besides a perfect 10

**hielord** (9.5): In the context of the album, this song is a game changer. And as a single, it's a bop, a banger, and one of the most iconic songs of 2020

**ryjomom** (9.5): The Max Martin production is everything

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I really like this song and would be happy if it wins, my only problem with it is that there are parts in the chorus where his voice doesn’t really match the energy of the production, which is an issue I have with some of his other songs but it really sticks out in this one

**wryn\_** (9.5): if this beats levitating i will be mad

**vagenda** (9.3): Even the Weeknd-apathetic contrarian in me cannot deny that this is a smash

**deadline4mymemories** (9): overplayed but good

**pig-serpent** (9): By making a synthwave song that can be enjoyed during the day, Abel has done more for the genre than anyone else in almost 10 years.

**wailord\_fan** (9): was an 8 pre-Super Bowl, but the performance on the field at the end brought it up again. Not the best on the album though!

**wavingwolves** (9): there's a reason why this is one of the biggest songs ever now and the reason is: it's good

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): I wish I loved this like everyone else. I can recognize how good it is musically, but it just does not click. However, the chorus is actually perfect.

**xxrandooxx** (9): I mean let me ask the audience… however I will say I got REAL sick of this song so I have to try really hard not to give it a low score just because I heard it every day

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): A great song, really “cinematic”. A great pop song for me, from a technical and enjoyable perspective.

**pheromenos** (8.5): i overplayed it so...

**Stryxen** (8.5): Take On Me if Take On Me was good

**zagreux** (8.5): I'm not a huge fan of this song but I still think that it's quite good.

**nooodisaster** (8): Condragulations Raja. No but really, this is a worthy winner, and completely deserves it. A pantheon of 2020 pop, a career re-defining moment for The Weeknd, and a pretty damn good song too.

# overplayed

**jimmy345960** (7.5): This would've been a ten if this were march 2020 but unfortunately, this song is victim to being overplayed. If I turn on the radio one more time and blinding lights comes on i swear. It plays on alternative stations and I need a long time to recover from me growing tired of it. The score went down because a lot of the best songs never get old for me. The first ten seconds are iconic though. This was robbed by grammys!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): I don't dislike Blinding Lights, I just have no strong feelings towards it really. I can see why other people like it, but I just don't get excited about it

**thePotatofairyy** (7.5): Love the verses. Great replayability. Just not fully in love with the chorus

**fedefreakss** (7.4): i used to like it more but i've listened to it too much

**Alumineous** (7): Radio friendly song. It's an okay song.

**Jackalope117** (7): this song is hella overrated but still pretty decent and the best song on the album. It will win and I don't really mind that

**JunkyGS** (5): I am so sick and tired of this song sorry. It is beyond over played and has not gone away for like over a year. It is really impressive how successful the song is and all the records it has broken and I enjoyed it a bit upon release, but I AM DONE WITH IT. The beat is insufferable now and I get 0 enjoyment from the song anymore.

**mms82** (4): meh, it was the perfect song to last the pandemic and got lucky to be the biggest song of all time because it’s a basic 80s nostalgia trip, but it’s really nothing special. It’s not bad, but it’s not good either. Just boring and basic

**vintagebathingsuit** (4): boring as fuck. maybe i've heard it too many times.

**imasalesman** (3): Please don’t hate me for this but this song is just incredibly boring

**twistedpython** (3): I originally would've given this an 8.5 or so, because I liked the song and it was catchy with a nice melody, but then I heard it twice an hour on the radio for an entire year and I never want to hear it again

# blinded by bad taste

# After Hours

---

**Overall Average**: 7.465 **// Average Controversy:** 1.612

---

 I cannot sing this album’s praises enough. It does everything I could ask for an album to do and more. The progression and character arc of it are so well defined, and so many of the songs just *slap*. It stumbles just a little at the beginning and the end (and the bonus tracks being rated here don’t really help), but it’s strengths far outweigh its weaknesses., While I liked some of his stuff in the past, this really was the album that made me a really big fan of The Weeknd. His ability to blend elements from pop, R&B, and electronic music makes for some truly unique and amazing stuff that I've listened to so much over the past year. After Hours is well deserving of being his most acclaimed album since the mixtape days, and it's a damn shame the Grammys are so shit because this was 100% deserving of being his first Album of the Year win. At least he won the more important award, a rate on popheads.

---
**seanderlust** (8.935): apologies to my flair, but this is my favorite album in this rate by a longshot. I think it's interesting to have such a dark and gripping album about drug addiction set against the hedonistic maximalism of Las Vegas and 80s pop. abel reminds us that it's not really about las vegas or LA - after all, wherever you go, there you are.

**Roxieloxie** (8.847): (8.788) This album feels very Urbancore to me, Like i feel like Im doing it a disservice by listening to it in my bedroom and now while driving through the city in a car at 80mph seeing the bright lights blur around me. It was very theatrical in a way where I absolutely see why it blew up the way it did, and now i have a full context of just how much more this album was robbed by the academy. I will admit pre 2020 I wasnt the biggest fan of the weeknd just cause some of his more questionable lines in certain songs but I did sorta soften on him just based on his actions this summer. So overall im glad i got to finally listen to this an appreciate it

**skargardin** (8.824): In terms of visual, scope, storytelling etc., this was by far my favorite pop release of last year. The massive visuals and such has me really invested in the era as a whole. Can't wait for the inevitable re-issue.

**Flegasaurus** (8.782): mr. weeknd is a main pop boy and after hours was most definitely album of the year

**aliensexist** (8.606): Why is the deluxe art so damn ugly - literally the original cover is perfection

**jayjaysortagay** (8.588): People are going to underrate this album so hard and those people deserve to have their streaming accounts taken away from them.

**frogaranaman** (8.588): yeah I think it’s pretty good

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.500): I started stanning The Weeknd since the Starboy era. Looking back at that album, it had way too many fillers but it's filled with so much potential of him being a main pop boy and I just know that the next album is going to serve. And I was right. After Hours is the album that proved that The Weeknd is a pop music force and it was an album that was basically the best of both worlds - the stans that liked his pop material and the long-time stans who missed Abel going through dark topics in his music. The concept of the era is just as amazing as well and I am very happy he is still committed to the aesthetic in the long-term. It's such a shame that this album was criminally snubbed by the Grammys. To me, I felt like this album won a tie with Folklore in my heart.

**ColsonBakerr** (8.471): - I... I love the Weeknd???? This era was something else

**thedoctordances1940** (8.353): obligatory f*** the Grammys

**AHSWeeknd** (8.176): Fully his best work after HoB

**NFLfreak98** (8.147): This album’s interesting cause it kinda just gets better as it goes. The run of Blinding Lights -> In Your Eyes -> Save Your Tears is just great

**CrimsonROSET** (8.118): dae think his behavior might be a little problematic? IDK it might be a reach I think i just made a whole new, never-before thought reading on this album, in this essay

**waluigiest** (8.118): I appreciate this album as a piece of art but his music has never really “clicked” with me. Even with that the back half (pre bonus tracks) is so so good.

**celladonn** (8.118): A true album meant for listening to in its entirety. Because of that, there's a lot of tracks on here that don't really stand on their own outside the album context but it's a very strong project overall.

**ReallyCreative** (8.106): This album flirts with being almost a little too haunting/ethereal, but the cohesiveness of the sound is such a strong point. The stretch of songs from Faith to Save Your Tears was one of the best 4 song stretches of any album from last year. Sometimes the cohesion is too much and the sound gets a little tedious, but I enjoy almost every single song on the album at the end of the day, and I could listen to it in almost any context.

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.059): 8.058 This was my first time listening to the album and I thought it was pretty good, but it’s brought down by a few mediocre songs.

**runaway3212** (8.041): I love this album so much, his voice is way too good and the instrumentals make it perfect

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.000): This would have been a PERFECT album if not for the messy first half.

**cocosairdep** (7.941): I love this album. His best work since Trilogy.

**rickikardashian** (7.929): The weeknd's vibe has always been a little too grim for me, and even some points of this album feel little too dark for my liking, but this is such an amazing album and it's so shocking how much quality content he was able to get on a single album

**pat-rickstar** (7.794): This has the most filler IMO but also the highest highs of these 4 albums. No one else in the rate is matching the run of songs from Heartless to After Hours.

**WhyDidEverIBother** (7.765): This would be much better if the first two and final songs just didn't fucking exist.

**jasannn** (7.735): It's not an album I come back to often but that 80's synth pop trinity is perfection.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.729): How can an album be so depressing yet so danceable at the same time?

**SmileAndTears** (7.682): I really like the production on this album. It sounds SO crisp and the darker production mixed with the 80s synthpop sound gives this album a very unique sound and probably makes it the most sonically interesting out of all the albums in this rate. That said, I’ve never liked trap skitters/rattling hi-hats, it’s one of my least favourite sounds in music and unfortunately this album has a decent amount of them, but I still like the album overall despite them.

**Iris3271** (7.676): AOTY and it isn't even my favorite album by The Weeknd

**purplechilipepper** (7.647): 9

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.529): I thought The Weeknd was a good artist but not my cup of tea. That was before this banger of an album. He did everything right, from the single choices to the story of this era. I now firmly believe that he has that superstar quality and cannot wait to hear what's next

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7.529): Instrumentals give me a headache but overall nice album! seriously my head aches so bad yet i can't stop listening to it.

**plastichaxan** (7.512): This is one of those albums I wish I liked more, I can see where the acclaim and enjoyment come from, but I only really get it from half of the album, however, I know it’s not really bad, so my ratings may have been a bit inflated for the sake of not having such a low average, cause even with the one it has i feel like i underrated the album, but i don’t really know what could change

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.500): 8.5

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.412): The way After Hours sonically blends pop and r&b is nearly perfect, if only they weren't so localized in the tracklist. This would be a perfect album if the lines were smoother instead of the first half being r&b and the second pop. When I listen to the album I always start from Heartless and end with Escape From LA tbh because it makes more sense to me sonically this way. Still the best album in this rate by a long mile though (the stadard edition at least, the deluxe songs drag it down).

ignitethephoenix: **nooodisaster** (7.382): King of pop, idk how you could argue with that.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.382): As a long time Weeknd fan; this is one of my favorite projects of his. It has the most convincing/confident delivery as well as the best story progression by far

**vayyiqra** (7.353): I have to be blunt, I didn't care much for this album when it came out. I felt it was fine, but long and samey, as Starboy notoriously is (still like it though). Now I am listening to this at 2 in the morning being tired and feeling kind of like what the kids call "faded" and this seems like the right vibe to get into this album now. (It is "hitting different".) By the right vibe, I mean it's like when it's late at night and the party is winding down and you're tired and still kind of drunk but not enjoying it anymore and you just want to rest and listen to some chunes before falling asleep. That's it, that's the vibe. It's :pensive: emoji but with keyboards, and I can get into that heavily. (Note: I am not literally drunk just tired it's a Monday okay I've been working on this for a long time)

**ktajlili** (7.353): Solid album that is weakened from a few inconsistencies. Love the storyline, sound, and several of the tracks.

**bluepupz** (7.324): Man, what an era. This album is cohesive and enjoyable to listen straight through. I generally like almost all of the songs here. I think he probably could have cut a few songs without any detriment to the overall listening experience, but I thought that about Starboy and still enjoyed that album as well. The Weeknd is definitely a main pop boy!

**bespectacIed** (7.294): An excellent album full of classics downgraded to "a solid pop album" because of the goddamn 27294721 fillers: story of every Abel album ever. Fuck the grammys btw

**whyishestaring** (7.276): I tried to be as unbiased as possible when rating this, his music isn't really my cup of tea because his songs tend to be lyrically basic.

**wasian-invasion** (7.235): The weeknd is the only straight m*n I have in my spotify library and he really earned his place there in 2020

**sarcasticsobs** (7.235): huh this did not age well for me at all

**YeYa\_3** (7.235): 8

**rslashpoopheads** (7.206): it's no Starboy but it'll do

**outsideeyess** (7.053): my least favorite of the big three The Weeknd albums

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.047): amazing production throughout with some great songs but his earlier albums are better imo

**KennyEarthman** (6.941): Blinding Lights to Save Your Tears was this album's peak, other tracks blend too much

**RandomHypnotica** (6.924): I've never been a big fan of the weekend, most of his tracks just never really clicked for me, and, for the most part, I can't say otherwise after listening to this album. There ARE some really good moments on here, however.

**fallenriot** (6.912): i’m definitely not as enamored with this album as a lot of people here are, but it’s still a solid body of work

**hielord** (6.853): This album is a grower for me. I didn't like it on the first few listens but I think it was just because I'm too used to upbeat bubblegum pop (gay) so I had to take more time to get used to the sound and style of the album. I started to appreciate every song and I think it's one of the most amazing works of music in the last few years. Maybe not my favorite, but that's just my taste. Because this album has such an impact that will influence mainstream music from now on.

**team\_kockroach** (6.559): I feel conflicted between wanting a person of colour to actually win, but also genuinely disliking this album

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.506): Mostly ~vibes~ with a few real standouts

**Misentro** (6.412): I've tried a few times to get into this album, but it all kind of blends together. It feels repetitive, a bit basic, and slow. The production is incredible though!

**J\_Toe** (6.235): Blinding Lights to Save Your Tears is the best stretch of the album. Top tier synth-wave pop music.

**pig-serpent** (6.088): The peaks on this album are great and there are a ton of great ideas spread out across the album, but there is not enough variety to justify 17 tracks of this. If the best ideas of the weaker songs were combined I feel like they all could've been great. Production really good though.

**moooo566** (6.088): It's dark, it's stylish, it's sexy, it's atmospheric, I did not enjoy listening to it at all. I'm pretty shocked it was snubbed at the Grammys because it feels like textbook award bait. Blinding Lights is so good, and then there's like 10 more songs that are like that but worse, and it's just this boring luke-warm beat soup dragging me down.

**jledzz** (6.059): i associate the weeknd with the maybe bi guys at my lbrl arts school that i wanted to fuck so bad for literally no reason so this is not very fair sorry lol

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6.029): I really do wish I enjoyed this album. I love Starboy. I love BBTM. I love Kiss Land. I enjoy the Trilogy. I can't really explain why this record doesn't do it for me. Maybe I'm just burned out on the 80s trend, it's possible. But I've tried a handful of times to like this record and I just end up bored. Time after time. People have said "Oh, you need the right vibe" and I get that, but a vibe should just increase something already good. A good album, to me at least, is always good. Not just at 3am when you're driving, or after you hit the bong. It's always good. And this album is just alright to me.

**slimboyfriend** (5.971): Idk, this album just didn't do it for me. The concept was boring & basic and the songs were mediocre for the most part. I don't have much to say about any of them.

**JunkyGS** (5.441): Holy shit is this album totally not for me. I have tried to like it and give it a couple listens and can see why maybe people like it but omg.... I find his vocal performance for so many songs just phoned in, his rifts sound like he is falling asleep, the lyrics are either rehashed themes or topics he has discussed before with no new nuance to them or cringe (please i cant listen to him rhyming Tummy again...), and the production rehashes so many of the same sounds in the songs that it is very easy to lose track of distinct songs on this very bloated listen. I like The Weeknd and have been a fan of him since his first mixtape and seen him in shows, but idk this album is just not for me right now and can totally been impacted by outside factors. He is clearly talented, but yeah..... not for me. Sorry <3

**Bajuko** (5.441): Overall this was kind of disappointing, after hearing such positive reception for this on popheads it felt very forgettable.

**zagreux** (5.347): popheads' obsession with The Weeknd is....worrying to say the least. I absolutely detest his coked-up misogynistic fuckboy persona, not to mention the lesbophobic lyrics about corrective rape. The album has nothing special and BL is its only saving grace. Don't mistake this as me saying that Abel deserved to get snubbed -- he absolutely deserved to win ROTY + Pop Solo for BL but the rest of the album is just bad. I feel uncomfortable listening to him singing "got so much pussy it's fallin outta my pocket", though I understand that it might just be a personal gripe. I hope that we can discuss his problematic behavior here someday without his stans brigading and calling us 'pop music pussies'. Overall, I appreciate the effort he put into this, but I don't really vibe with it.

**ryjomom** (4.959): 4 Full of some amazing songs and other songs I never want to hear again in my life.

**xxrandooxx** (4.494): 4.8 it's the production that got to me.

# Future Nostalgia

---

**Overall Average**: 7.726 **// Average Controversy:** 1.797

---

 This is easily one of the strongest sophomore albums I’ve ever really heard. Dua completely changed the conversation around her by building a cohesive album and era, and she deserves all the credit in the world for that. However, a lot of the album has grown off me overtime, but there are still bops here, and there are a few songs on the record that I treasure. I can’t wait to see what Dua does next (aside from “get fucking vaccinated if you’re gonna travel that much”), This is my personal AOTY just because it appeals to me so much, I mean 9 straight BANGERS is exactly what I look for in an album because I generally listen to music for escapism purposes, to make me happy, to dance. Dua brought exactly that to Future Nostalgia, with the retro-tinged nu-disco and electropop sounds being so infectious and irresistable. It's incredibly easy for me to see why this era brought so much love to Dua, why it ended up winning a Grammy, and why it performed so well in this rate - and it's what it deserves.

---
**ryjomom** (9.542): 10 This is my most played album of all time (Currently around 4,000 scrobbles). Something about the production, theme, ideas all work together so well to deliver me pure serotonin.

**moooo566** (9.500): This is my second favourite album of 2020 (SAWAYAMA still blows me away). I've never done decimals before but I'm starting them here just so I can separate these. Almost every song is fun and catchy and danceable, which is what I wanted even before the pandemic, and the ones that aren't are Boys Will Be Boys, which is also good for other reasons.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8.983): 10 An incredible pop album.

**jayjaysortagay** (8.833): wall to wall bangers

**celladonn** (8.833): My favourite of these albums, it may not be particularly deep but when the bops are this good I just do not care. We all know it drops off in quality at the end but until then... Whew.

**NFLfreak98** (8.800): If there was ever an answer to the question ‘What album would be perfect if one song was removed?’, its this one. glares at Boys Will Be Boys

**whyishestaring** (8.792): Amazing, my only complaint is that I wish there was more amazing tracks. This is one of the few albums I've listened to where there are genuinely no skips in it. (I can live without Fever tho)

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.625): Among all of the albums in this rate, this is the album I listened to the least. I think this is because Dua is not someone I stan heavily, hence why my plays on Future Nostalgia are not a lot. But I really do love this album and it reminded me why I love pop music in the first place. Like I would legit buy a CD of this album if it had a better booklet because this is a pop classic record right here.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (8.625): An ethnonationalist with Balkan roots who releases incredible pop music... Is Dua the new Ceca? Discuss

**mudkip1** (8.583): this is literally how i feel about the album lmao

**Misentro** (8.500): This was my favourite album and era in a very stacked year. I expected a lot from Dua after her first album but she really blew me away. There's a couple duds, but everything else is SO good, not to mention Club Future Nostalgia and all the amazing performances.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.417): Stay at home Dua 😔

**RandomHypnotica** (8.358): If we were rating people and not the music, Dua would be losing a LOT of points for all her globetrotting covid spreading antics. But since we're rating the music, I can't deny just how great this album is. It's everything a pophead could want (almost) front to back BOPS, with amazing hooks, lush visuals, and MV's, it's an amazing step forward from Dua's S/T, and I can't wait to see what she does next (musically, not what island she decides to infect next)

**CHRMbishop** (8.333): Dangerous amounts of artistry and fun, handle with care

**jasannn** (8.333): This album there with Emotion and Red as one of my favorite albums ever. It was such a good era.

**Brendon-Urine** (8.292): More than anything I appreciate this album for being short (comparatively) but so consistent. Like you don't see many mainstream albums these days where every song is at least good, but more importantly they're all distinct and there's no filler (imo). Yeah, BWBB is just alright and I'm not personally huge on Hallucinate, but every other song is just so good.

**ColsonBakerr** (8.250): this album was something but Dua ffs WEAR A MASK & STAY AT HOME!!

**vayyiqra** (8.167): Is anyone else tired of Discourse about how the 2020 dance-pop revival wasn't even real disco? I love Dula Peep. I think she's a really interesting artist. [Serious comment: Not to randomly compare two different artists, but I'm glad this album came out in the same year as the third La Roux album because that album was Bad unfortunately and this album gave me the next best thing to it. Also I still think Dua's debut is my favourite overall but this is a solid and fun album that drops off a bit by the end but it's fine.]

**wasian-invasion** (8.167): I feel like no other pop girl has put this much effort into an era in a looong time and it really paid off for Dua here

**pat-rickstar** (8.125): Was initially my AOTY but I like it less and less as time goes on. Full of bops though, my average without GIB and BWBB was about 0.8 higher lol

**hielord** (8.092): I think I have a special connection with this album. It just clicked, it just feels correct. It's the first album that when I listened to it for the first time there just wasn't any skippable song (until we reached the last 2 lmao). It's an amazing work for Dua, and I still stan.

**bespectacIed** (8.083): Remember when this girl was THEE popstar of the people before she became Dua The Explorer??? I now have such resentment to this girl omg. I love FN and was fucking ready to embrace her as my white pop queen, damn it. Therapy won't cure the disappointment she's caused me

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.083): Another album that surprised me when it came out. I liked Dua Lipa before, but this album made me appreciate her more. Fun, funky and lively.

**pig-serpent** (7.958): Pop music isn't my main scene but this is the type of album that makes me stick around on Popheads.

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.917): 7.916 This album is really good, I don’t care if it makes me basic. I’d probably give it a higher score if it weren’t for Bys Will Be Bys bringing it down.

**nooodisaster** (7.917): queen of covid

**skargardin** (7.917): You're right Dua, you should've stayed at home.

**kirby31200** (7.875): This is the obvious rate winner right

ignitethephoenix: **cocosairdep** (7.833): Bop after bop after bop. My favorite album from the past year. What can I say, I’m just a basic bottom.

**plastichaxan** (7.717): I started listening to Dua since Be the One came out and seeing her evolution has been incredible, at first I didn’t really like this album but with every thing she has been doing related to it I appreciate it more and more

**WhyDidEverIBother** (7.583): There's honestly nothing to say about this album, so I won't anymore.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.542): Cohesive, full of bangers... Dula Peep delivered.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.542): This rate made me a Dua stan

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7.500): very disco, I enjoyed it! slightly better than after hours.

**waluigiest** (7.500): I’m just mad because this was one of the most cohesive impressive pop records of the last few years until BAM the last two tracks

**YeYa\_3** (7.500): 8

**ReallyCreative** (7.492): I loved this album on release, but over time, too many other releases from 2020 just outshone Future Nostalgia, ended up doing the same thing but better, more mature, more experimentally, and more interestingly. Now, it's still a solid album with some of the best songs of 2020, but I have had fewer and fewer reasons to return to it, even outside of Dua's antics.

**seanderlust** (7.467): the obvious comparison here is to chromatica and i'm tired so i'm going to make that. like chromatica, this album has some high high points (title track, Hallucinate, Levitating) and some low low points (BWBB, GIB, a couple of other tracks that IMO feel like filler). her singles were absolutely killer though.

**TiltControls** (7.458): I think as an album sometimes I forget how good FN is. But when going through song by song nearly every single one of the 9 tracks on the album are extremely catchy and well made. It's a fantastic album and it's definitely a good thing that they didn't try to add on any filler at the end!

**runaway3212** (7.417): Love this album so much, Dua Lipa changed the game. That said I think it has gotten worse since the first time I heard it, bu it's still really good

**ktajlili** (7.333): Flawless EP. Every track from FN to closer Break My Heart Fucking slaps.

**Stryxen** (7.308): few cha nastowjah babes x

**slimboyfriend** (7.250): The day this album came out, I would've said it's a modern classic. A year later, and I can see that it's a really good pop album that establishes a strong musical identity for Dua Lipa, but it's no Emotion or even a SAWAYAMA.

**bluepupz** (7.167): This album defined the beginning of quarantine for me, and I listened to it all the time. I'm pretty sure Future Nostalgia and Dua Lipa were in my top 5 albums and artists on Spotify for 2020. While I think I still need to take a bit of a breather on these songs because I overplayed them, I did enjoy listening to them again for this rate. There are a few duds, but she generally did really well with her sophomore output. This whole era was an experience!

**rslashpoopheads** (7.167): definitely the strongest and most cohesive album in this group but it has some real stinkers too

**J\_Toe** (7.083): tbh, I wore this album out early in the lockdown and got tired of it pretty quick. It will be interesting to see if the songs still hold up for me after a break.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.042): this is...very much a quarantine album lol

**aliensexist** (7.033): Dua you just had to ruin it by going out, didn't you?

**xxrandooxx** (7.000): 7 Stunning, not a huge fan of disco vibe songs but she popped off

**Flegasaurus** (6.917): i think future nostalgia is a pretty good album but i also think it's really overrated. it has a couple amazing songs but it's not life changing

**fallenriot** (6.750): i loved this album when it was released, but i definitely fell out with it a bit as time went on and better music came out. still, it’s impressive how listening now manages to make me nostalgic for a time when everything was pretty miserable

**zagreux** (6.708): You can say a lot of things about Dua Lipa, but you can't call her a liar. She scheduled a world tour for her sophomore album and went on with it(minus the concerts), pandemic be damned. That being said, she really did a ~full 180 with this era. I'm divided on the album but I really liked the singles.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.667): Technically well-made, but oh god this album is so soulless. I'm positive 10 years from now no one will remember Dua's sophomore album with anything more than nostalgic fondness if at all. Her vocals are just incapable emoting.

**team\_kockroach** (6.642): A little bloated. If it was a 7 song EP, or if some of the weaker songs were more fine-tuned, it would be an easy 10/10.

**Roxieloxie** (6.558): (6.558) Honesty I dont think this album is bad, Its fine. The high points are really high, and the low points are kinda forgetable, this is very much a you pick out your favorites from the tracklist and never really go back to the rest.

**SmileAndTears** (6.517): I made a comment a while ago on Future Nostalgia/Plastic Hearts that was kinda controversial so I’m not gonna repeat myself too much here. Overall, I think FN is a decent to good album. It has its moments but honestly I think it’s one of, if not the, weakest album here. Dua’s not really expressive as a singer most of the time. Apart from DSN and Physical, it feels like anyone could’ve been on these songs and done a similar job.

**KennyEarthman** (6.500): what a great 9-track album by miss Dula Peep!

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.367): The highs on this album are high, but I honestly went into it expecting to like it a lot more from the songs I’ve heard.

**Iris3271** (6.333): Underwhelming beginning and end but the middle made up for it

**purplechilipepper** (6.250): 7

**frogaranaman** (6.250): pretty overhyped to me, but the singles are a great string

**ElizabethDDoS** (6.000): I lowered all of Dua's scores by 2 because of her COVID antics. Sue me and stream /u/RandomHypnotica's masterpiece.

**bulforster** (5.758): Good on the public for correctly identifying the only three songs on this album that deserved to be hits. I unironically prefer Club Future Nostalgia.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5.542): Me @ Dua, drop the disco theme, drop the 80s theme and please pick up something jazzy and soulful for your next album, you'll knock that out of the park harder than any baseball Bryce Harper has ever hit. Thanks, girl.

# Chromatica

---

**Overall Average**: 7.334 **// Average Controversy:** 1.934

---

 …I don’t love this album. It reminds me of Badlands or Hopeless Fountain Kingdom in the way that it’s supposedly built around this world of Chromatica, but like… you literally would not know that if you didn’t follow along with the promo campaign. But I could overlook that if the songs were really strong. And some of them are, but a lot… really aren’t. The secondary concept of the album is spinning trauma into songs for the dance floor, and… I think she does a better job of achieving that goal at least. 911 and Replay actually do it really fucking well, honestly. But unfortunately, a lot of the album is bogged down by “meh” production or bad lyricism. Gaga can do so much better than this, but I do wish the album highlights were treated better., This is very clearly the most divisive album in the rate I think, and that has a lot to do with the production choices. Working with BloodPop as well as some other house producers, Gaga delivered an album of straight bops, but the safe house production falls flat for a lot of people that aren't big fans of the genre. Personally, I AM a big fan of the genre so this is right up my alley, but I for sure get the qualms other people have with it. Fortunately for them and unfortunately for Gaga, Chromatica is the first album out, with it just barely getting a single song into the top 10... ouch.

---
**zagreux** (9.771): I know this sub hates Chromatica but tbh this album is the reason I'm still alive. Lady Gaga has always inspired me with her brutal honesty regarding her trauma and Chromatica spoke to me on a higher level than most other dance-pop albums. I know it isn't as groundbreaking or stellar as her early 2010s output and Gaga couldn't promote the album due to the pandemic but we need to respect her output as an artist. At the end of the day, she's just an Italian girl from New York who tries to give her best to millions of little monsters despite her fibromyalgia. Not every album needs to be a genre-defining body of work. Chromatica helped me through some of the hardest times of my life, nothing but respect for my AoTY. Y'all might not love the album but u/joshually and I will be bopping to it till the end of time.

**ryjomom** (9.150): 9.1 Imagine the gay clubs had there been no covid. This will go down as one of the best gay classics.

**vayyiqra** (9.000): This album is the definition of a grower. The night it came out I watched the release party on Hana's Twitch channel (she is Bloodpop's girlfriend of many years and was therefore able to get ahold of it early) and she played it about 5-6 times while everyone talked about it, and it was a nice moment in the hellscape of last year. After not being hyped over "Stupid Love", a song I now think is great, I was hooked by the callbacks this album makes to early 90s house, which nothing else in this rate does and which is a sound I really like. I feel like to compare this album to Gaga's other work is to miss the point, because it's not quite like anything else she's done but has things in common with the rest of her work. It's not as out-there as Artpop (my favourite) nor has as many classics as The Fame, but it's a solid and fun album throughout. I think it's an achievement and was worth the wait. It's not perfect, but if you didn't like it, read up on the lyrics and what the songs are about and you might appreciate it better. And if you don't want to do that, just listening to it and taking it on its own terms might work. I think a lot of Gaga fans need to put aside the album they made in their heads and wish they got for the one they did get (and that a lot of talented musicians worked hard to make). I still don't really understand the scifi theme or know what exactly Chromatica is but it's an interesting place to visit.

**skargardin** (8.857): It's really sad how Chromatica, being incredibly visual in terms of its scope and setting obviously, has had so much untapped potential due to the fucking pandemic. I love the album still though but I love to think of what the era could've been in a pandemic-less world.

**nooodisaster** (8.643): Chromaticans have to band the fuck together to stop half this album from leaving day 1. (8.64 avg)

**moooo566** (8.464): This feels like a return to the early stages of her career, before Artpop and Joanna and ASIB, and it's very welcome. I love everything she's done but this is what she does best, the stuff I can't really get anywhere else. There's so many amazing tracks.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.429): I’ve seriously listened to this album more than any other album, love it. Imma try not to be too biased in its favour.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.357): I have very mixed feelings about this album. I actually love this album so much and I really love the themes that Gaga was trying to pull. But on the other hand, my love for this album was slightly drained by the fact that it barely had any promo and the White Gays on Twitter really overhyped this album to death. Like come on, I am glad Gaga went back to pop but this isn't the revolutionary pop album you guys think it is. Nonetheless, Chromatica is one of my favorite albums released last year but I really wish the era was executed better. It's easy to blame the pandemic, but you have artists like Weeknd and Dua who managed to continue their big eras despite the pandemic so what's the excuse? Let's hope that the Chromatica Ball can happen as planned so that we can finally see what Gaga was trying to execute from this album on a visual level.

**fallenriot** (8.357): compared to the rest of her discography it’s not her best work, but i still think it’s a good album for what it is - fun dancepop blended really well with pretty personal lyrics

**waluigiest** (8.357): I dunk on this album all the time but I still gave like half of the songs 10s lmao. The highs are not as high as her best work, but as a project it’s pretty solid.

**wasian-invasion** (8.071): Haven't revisited this album all that much, but it outperformed my expectations. I guess I'm just a sucker for dance music, even the okay songs

**Misentro** (8.071): I'll admit that I'm a biased Gaga stan, but I am just SO happy with this album. It's so good to hear her making dance pop again. It's not quite on the level of Born This Way, but it's still an incredible, fun album on its own.

**seanderlust** (7.929): look, chromatica is fun. far be it from me to critique the homosexual national anthem(s - all 16 or so of them). I definitely bopped and enjoyed it. that said, I can't help but feel that gaga is capable of more than this. after watching her for years and stanning permanently, after watching her bleed to death on stage at the VMAs or listening to the neon-in-a-dark-room orgy that are tracks like Heavy Metal Lover or Scheisse off BTW, or watching the throw-everything-at-the-wall overdrive of ARTPOP, I know she is capable of more than a standard house throwback album. I still liked it so i'm not really complaining, but I would challenge gaga to not be afraid to get weird with it. I would love to see her partner with a more cutting-edge producer on her next album.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (7.893): Get this a girl a therapist damn.

**celladonn** (7.857): My least favourite of these albums but it's still a lot of fun and has some fantastic high points

**pat-rickstar** (7.750): Not Gaga's best album, sure, but maybe her most consistent? There aren't as many highs as the other albums in the rate but it might be my favourite to listen to front to back.

**whyishestaring** (7.736): I love her, but this album feels kinda basic. It feels just a little bit better than Katy's Smile album. The interludes were nice though.

**xxrandooxx** (7.693): 7.7 She is always turning out good music

**jasannn** (7.643): It's a fun album fit for the clubs but it has a few too many drops.

**CHRMbishop** (7.571): the interludes are cool but they sound like disney music, still cool tho
[/r/popheads/comments/ma2tl8/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_3/grqw5e3/]

=====

ignitethephoenix: **guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.564): I didn't like this on my first listen, I thought it was ok. Listening to it over and over again during quarantine made me appreciate it more.

**slimboyfriend** (7.536): Yes, I am gay, but Chromatica is actually a great dance pop album. It's a pretty faithful recreation of 90's house pop and she's able to touch on her PTSD, anxiety, and chronic pain without bringing the mood all the way down. People had way too much hype, especially considering Gaga's only put out one truly great album in 12 years before Chromatica.

**SmileAndTears** (7.514): It’s not my favourite gaga album but god do I love her bridges on this one. The album does have a tendency to have super shitty choruses tho (911, Fun Tonight, Free Woman, 1000 Doves) but the songs that hit are amazing. Also, the transitions are nice but after a while, it starts feeling more like a gimmick than anything

**bluepupz** (7.500): Lady Gaga is the reason I am a pop fan today and was my favorite artist for years. So... yeah, please imagine my complete and utter excitement when Chromatica finally came out. If Future Nostalgia carried the first few months of quarantine 2020 for me, this album carried the next few months. I think this is a fun album with great songs and excellent transitions between the interludes and their subsequent songs. Pop Gaga is still my favorite!

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.500): Move Replay to Chromatica III, give Sour Candy to BLACKPINK, discard the rest of Chromatica II, and you've got the perfect Gaga album.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.464): Pretty average really. The good songs are absolute GODS though.

**WhyDidEverIBother** (7.357): Most of this album sounds like a neutered dance remix of itself, but I can't deny that it got people through hard times and that there's quite a bit of great material here.

**Roxieloxie** (7.286): (7.286) So this album isnt .... *bad*, I can understand why people like it , however every song literally sounds the same to me. Outside of FN this is the album i've listened to the most specifically for the purposes of rating this and i just cant get into it.

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7.193): it was okay.

**team\_kockroach** (7.186): I didn't appreciate this enough when it came out. It has better singles, and reaches higher peaks, than the other albums here

**Brendon-Urine** (7.143): Don't have many individual song comments, mostly because the album is consistently pretty good. Not much bad, but only a few songs are SUPER memorable.

**frogaranaman** (7.143): I’m pretty sure the comments on this album are gonna be like “Chromatica bad, worst album of the year” [average: 8.231]

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.100): 7.5

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.036): 7.035 This album starts off so well and then it just… tanks. At least the singles were good.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.964): the best album in this rate tbh but that’s not saying much

**ktajlili** (6.893): I like this, but do I love it? I wish I did.

**KennyEarthman** (6.893): the way this would've served as a visual album

**NotMajorTom** (6.836): I feel bad giving Lady Gaga such low marks, but here we go:

**TiltControls** (6.786): It's not bad or anything, a solid 7/10, but outside of some standouts it was a pretty forgettable experience

**rickikardashian** (6.557): this album does have some very outstanding tracks, so i can't say this era was a waste, but an artist as experienced and talented as Gaga shouldn't be making an album with so many bland songs. how did the woman that made bad romance also make free woman?

**YeYa\_3** (6.500): 7

**RandomHypnotica** (6.493): Half of the songs on this album feel like Gaga went "what's a creative metaphor I can use?" (Alice, Sour Candy, Plastic Doll, etc.), and wrote a song that spells out EXACTLY what that metaphor stands for, the other half just feel uninspired. Overall, I'm disappointed in the album, it feels like it could've been so much more with some more time taken to really refine the lyrics, and get some more interesting producers (looking at you Bloodpop)

**ReallyCreative** (6.357): I don't know what to say. I liked Joanne more than most people, I liked Artpop more than most people (on release too!), but Chromatica? It's just not good. Not for Gaga. That said, Rain on Me is a killer collaboration and Babylon is a masterpiece. Even though this album was underwhelming, I have a few reasons to come back to it.

**cocosairdep** (6.357): Some great songs, but all in all pretty mediocre imo. I like most of her albums better.

**NFLfreak98** (6.314): This one is all over the place. More Rain On Me’s and Free Woman’s, less 911’s and Plastic Doll’s please

**Iris3271** (6.286): There were a few gems but overall I was underwhelmed

**jledzz** (6.214): i like most of it but so many of these songs are clearly marketed towards bar queens

**Stryxen** (6.121): chromassica

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6.107): In my mind I feel like I'm nicer to this album than I should be and it's all because Gaga has already scored points with me through the years. If I have it my way this is probably the last time I have to think of this record, outside of Rain On Me. It was just whiplash from going to how great A Star is Born is to this. Recruit Cooper again? Sure, why not.

**rslashpoopheads** (5.893): I'm gonna be honest the more I listen to Gaga's recent music the more I believe that old ass rumor where she murdered some other woman and stole all her concepts for The Fame (Monster) eras and took her place and now without the Book of Ideas(tm) she's floundering with no idea what to do.

**jayjaysortagay** (5.857): Finally some songs I can give bad ratings to!!

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5.786): The album is fun but this album also made me understand why people drag BloodPop

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5.786): The truly frustrating part of Chromatica is hearing all the missed potential. It could have been brilliant if only a little more fresh and polished. She's kinda a one trick pony to me and she's obviously never going to top her first two records, but it's a fun listen and a decent entry into Lady Gaga's discography.

**pig-serpent** (5.500): Easily the most disapointing album of 2020 for me. Part of it is because I expected a lot more from Gaga, but most of it is because most of these songs have obviously not hit their full potential. With some tweaking I think every song on this album could be at least an 8/10.

**runaway3212** (5.471): Yeah I don't like this one, it sounds like an AI trying to recreate the magic of The Fame Monster, there are a few highlights bu they're very far and in between

**plastichaxan** (5.436): Maybe I was too harsh on this album, but I had such high expectations after such a long wait that it was frustrating getting....this. Bloodpop you're my arch enemy now.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.414): never listening to this album again lol

**bespectacIed** (4.714): Someone who's synonymous to pop music innovation has no business doing an album that sounds like royalty-free youtube beats :/ Gaga's too talented and intelligent for this generic af project.

# folklore

---

**Overall Average**: 7.689 **// Average Controversy:** 1.861

---

 Looking back at this album critically, I can see that it’s not perfect like I thought it was after my first few listens. A few songs in the back half drag the album down, and there are a few lyrics and vocal voices that could have used a little more refinement, but overall? Yeah, I love folklore. It’s already being dubbed the most important piece of art created and released during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I think that assertion will only grow with time. Anyway, Swifties, please shut the fuck up so that I can enjoy her music in PEACE, for fuck’s sake., Waking up on that random day in July to a new album announcement from Taylor will be a day I'll never forget because it was just so unexpected. I was feeling a tad burnt from the Lover era and was hanging up my Swiftie card because I didn't like that album that much, and I expected the era to go on for a bit longer, but to everyone's surprise she decided to drop a much more low-key album with influences from folk and indie pop, far different from the bubblegum pink of Lover. Ultimately it's not my absolute favourite Taylor album but there's a ton of greatness here and I'm happy we got something like this from her. My main worry going into this rate was that folklore would just completely flop against the competition for being way less boppy than the throwback-influenced synth/electro-pop albums it was paired with (I was actually on the team of not rating folklore at all tbh it just seemed like it would cause too many issues), although now that everything is said and done it ended up being okay. She does end up falling before the top 7, but I think that's less of a testament to folklore's differences to its competitors and more of a testament to the sheer quality of Dua and Abel's singles that make up the top 7.

**ChandelierFlickering** (9.676): took a little effort to not give every song a ten

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.000): This is the album that I have been waiting from Taylor ever since Red. Love me some 1989 Taylor. Love me some rep Taylor. Hell, love me some Lover Taylor even with ME! in the mix. But Folklore is basically why I am a Swiftie in the first place, which is her cinematic songwriting. Taylor grew up as a person and as an artist so much and this is a huge development for her as a songwriter. I think my favorite part out of this era is that it led to some of my friends checking out this album and they freaking loved it. I will always be proud of that moment since I am always known to them as the Swiftie friend in the class.

**overscore\_** (9.000): The entire last half of this album makes me go "Wow, that was a great album closer. Wait, there's another song?". And I like it for some reason.

**whyishestaring** (8.982): This is her best album so far, and it's EVERYTHING that I've been wanting from her. Also, I can proudly say with all honesty that it's not recency bias, because evermore came out a few months back and I only genuinely like half of the songs there (sorry), while I still listen to folklore (+ long pond) almost daily.

**jayjaysortagay** (8.882): the standard in this rate is so damn high. I love this album! Steam The Last Great American Dynasty!

**rickikardashian** (8.835): i hate this sub so fucking much for making me rate this against dance albums. i know balladphobia will strike hard against this album and I'm going to hate every minute of it.

**YeYa\_3** (8.824): 10

**ColsonBakerr** (8.765): - i've always been a lyric person when it comes to music an this album just hit it out the ballpark. am I a swiftie now????? The scammys snubbed the weeknd and Future Nostalgia is amazing but i hope they don't snub this cause it deserves AOTY and I wasn't even a taylor fan before this.

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (8.765): EXCELLENT album beats every other album of 2020 oh my god if you haven't listened to this go listen to it right now I'm obsessed Madame Swift has outdone herself.

**moooo566** (8.735): Taylor continues to fuck me up with every release. After every genre shift and curveball she's thrown over the last ten years, I still couldn't have predicted a surprise drop of a beautiful folky/singer-songwriter album. This really feels like Taylor grown up, past all the bullshit and just running on talent.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (8.735): Indie Taylor second best Taylor (sorry but Speak Now supremacy still holds up)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.659): I did NOT expect to like this as much as I did. I've liked some of Taylor's songs before, but generally speaking, I was very neutral on her. With this album, however, I genuinely love it, even the weakest moments on it are still enjoyable. Am I… am I a Swiftie now? 🤢

**TiltControls** (8.647): So glad Taylor took this direction for this album and evermore. Interested to see where she goes from here now!

**waluigiest** (8.647): My 2020 album of the year. I was on the edge of becoming a swiftie and this album pushed me into it. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be mature. The writing is emotional and tender and intelligent without ever being overly ornate (don’t let swifties convince you “gauche” is some esoteric SAT word) and it just fulfills. I could just close my eyes and listen to peace and be completely content.

**Stryxen** (8.565): this is so funny im so sorry i can't wait for the whiplash from all these retro dance songs to sad piano taylor in the reveal. also all my comments will be lowercase for this album

**skargardin** (8.529): Some of these tracks I've grown a little tired of and don't feel as strongly about as I used to, but as a whole this is really nice and showcases Taylor's strong songwriting first and foremost.

**aliensexist** (8.512): yes I am a Taylor Swift stan who woke up at 5AM to listen

**kirby31200** (8.441): I will be upset if this rate made me a Swiftie

**fallenriot** (8.324): after Lover i fully thought/had made peace with not getting another Taylor album until 2023, so when this was announced i almost shit my pants. i think my favorite album of last year is a tie between this and Gaslighter by The Chicks.

**runaway3212** (8.235): I'm going full swiftie here but I adore this album so much, it's so pretty

**celladonn** (8.206): Taylor's best album in years although it can still be a bit hit-or-miss. The mellow indie-folk sound and narrative storytelling are a great direction for her (but please Taylor, take a year or two off from releasing music).

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.147): 8.147 I hate that this is my highest average in this rate. This is just a really good album, and also I have some nice memories attached to this cause it reminds me of summer and when the sun went down at 9pm.

**jasannn** (8.147): It took me a good two months to finally appreciate this album but this is definitely her magnum opus. Great lyrics, cohesive and catchy melodies. evermore wishes she was her.

**LeninaCrowne94** (8.118): I realize that my average for this album is probably absurdly high, but hey, trauma!

**AHSWeeknd** (8.059): To be fair you have to have a really high IQ to understand folklore, her catchphrase “SPELLING IS FUN” is a cry for help that she ran out of ideas but then COVID folklore happened :)

**WhyDidEverIBother** (8.059): These songs wore out on me very quickly but the excitement that came with the surprise drop was something I really needed that summer and I will always be grateful for it.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.000): A person who's thankfully no longer a part of my life has ruined my first experience with this album and I couldn't properly listen to it evermore since. Somehow it still ended up getting a pretty high average from me.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8.000): If you've never listened to this record in an outdoor shower while having a shower beer while it is slightly raining and it is after midnight, well, you're missing out on a great experience.

**seanderlust** (7.982): there are some very great tracks on here! some of it can feel like filler, especially towards the end it tends to get a little samey.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.941): 8 This album is kind of boring listening all the way though...

**pat-rickstar** (7.765): I really like this album but I never want to see another ranking of it again. Peace is really dull but I like almost everything else.

**nooodisaster** (7.735): I feel like evermore's rollout kinda harmed both folklore and it in the long run for me. As now folklore already feels dated and old news so I don't to it, but evermore isn't as good imo so I don't listen to that either.

**slimboyfriend** (7.712): It's definitely not an indie album but it definitely is Taylor Swift's second magnum opus

**wasian-invasion** (7.671): taylor's kept us fed these past few years. The second half is definitely weaker but overall such a gorgeous album. Excited to see where she goes next

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.653): It's all track five? Always has been.

**ReallyCreative** (7.624): It's good, it can be baby's introduction to alt/folk at times, but it's good. I think it's a good gateway album to a lot of great indie stuff out there, but I also think evermore is the more daring and more interesting project.

ignitethephoenix: **engifear** (7.529): now can we rate the superior evermore?

**SmileAndTears** (7.359): Like Lover and evermore, folklore has 5 or 6 songs that should’ve been cut from the tracklist and they prevent it from being an amazing album. As it is, it’s a great album but the bad/mediocre songs really drag it down (though not as much as FN, except maybe the 1)

**NFLfreak98** (7.253): Not too bad, if bogged down by some deep cuts that sound exactly the same as each other. August and Betty alone are enough for me to enjoy this album to some extent

**cocosairdep** (7.147): It’s just ok. I don’t go back to it that often tbh, besides a couple of (great) songs.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.029): still enjoy the first half of this much more

**bluepupz** (7.000): Going into this rate, I was definitely the least familiar with this album. I listened to it when it first came out, but I didn't really come back to it until now. I was pleasantly surprised by a lot of the songs this time around, and this is the first time I've actually looked up the lyrics - as usual, Taylor does a lovely job of painting a picture with her words. I understand why y'all like the "Teenage Love Triangle" songs so much now, it was fun figuring out the story behind the characters.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.971): her most cohesive album but there's a distinct lack of standout tracks that past albums (yes, even Lover) had. the lyricism is leagues above the other albums in this rate and everything is enjoyable but it all just blends together to an extent.

**vayyiqra** (6.824): This album is nice, really. I feel like I didn't give it a fair chance when it came out, same as with After Hours, and I could get into it with time. It's long and (dreaded by much of Popheads) largely acoustic, but that's okay I feel like I didn't connect with it emotionally, but I respect it. I thought maybe it was a mistake to rate along with three other synthpop albums, but we needed to rate it, and it was the only place it fit, so that's fine. I don't have much else to say about it, and I like other Taylor albums more, but it's good. (One more note I guess: lol @ the irony of some fans not understanding that these are songs written about characters and not all from Taylor's own viewpoint when the album is literally called folklore.)

**Misentro** (6.735): The first half of this album is so beautiful and atmospheric, but it really slumps around Illicit Affairs.

**KennyEarthman** (6.706): this album is too depressing so I can't get into it as much as I would like

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6.665): better than i remember it being

**Iris3271** (6.618): A lot of good songs, there's a very good album in there surrounded by mediocrity

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.582): Mods may make Taylor a stale topic, but what would we do without our alt grassroots queen 😌 / s

**team\_kockroach** (6.406): stream Sleep Well Beast by the National

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.353): I appreciate Taylor trying to do something more "artsy" after Lover, but folklore didn't really land for me. I like the lyrics, but her vocal performace says that she couldn't care less to make an effort and the album is too long for something so samey sounding.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.235): this album has a few really good songs in the first half but then it just starts to fall off

**plastichaxan** (6.194): This is probably the first Taylor album I listen to where a decent amount of songs click with me it was nice to see her going in this direction

**Roxieloxie** (6.118): (6.118) I kinda hate the fact that this tracklist was set up from best to last because after hours was so high for me by the time I got to this, It's just sorta 'oh' I really dont want to be the negative person that just went in and tanked this album because I do not think that its terrible, This is not my vibe at all and I would probably never listen to this in full again however I can understand why the indie people who are really into this vibe would enjoy this. However, respectfully, its just not my thing.

**oscarbrierley1** (5.982): so sorry swifties (jk i'm not) but taylor is pretty boring to me

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5.965): I have a confession to make: I do not care for tswift. Now, this doesn't mean I dislike her, but I also don't like her. My feelings on the matter can be summed up as complete indifference. Listening to this was a snoozefest to me, very samey, but I did my best to rate everything fairly.

**pig-serpent** (5.941): Chamber pop is a genre I tend to avoid and this album is just another example of why. Individually most songs are fine, pleasent even, but as a whole I just don't care about this album and there's only a handful of songs I can see myself returning to.

**J\_Toe** (5.941): still think this shouldn't have been included in the rate. It doesn't make sense having 3 synth/dance heavy albums then ending with chamber pop/ soft rock. Anyway, this is the album from Taylor I've wanted for a long time.

**ryjomom** (5.900): 6 If Miss Taylor knew how to edit this could’ve been a solid album, instead this album drags on with nothing new to add.

**zagreux** (5.776): I've said this before: I don't think Taylor Swift is for me. Her music is extremely bland and generic, her songwriting is decent at best, and the only reason she's at the top is due to the fact that she is a cold-blooded manipulative businesswoman. She only pretends to be an activist when the truth is that she doesn't give one single fuck about social justice until the waters are safe enough(see: YNTCD) or till it affects her reputation. With that being said, I liked folklore more than her other albums(not that the bar was exactly high, anyway) and even though it isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread(as popheads would have me believe), it's still good. august, my tears ricochet, and this is me trying are some great songs. Tbh I feel that swifties overhyped the album a bit but I still respect Taylor for branching out and writing songs about topics she hadn't explored yet.

**Flegasaurus** (5.706): i'm a casual fan of t swizzle but i really don't know if i liked this album or not???? i don't want to sound like one of those popheads that can't stand anything that isn't maximalist dance pop but... this was just kind of boring, although it does have some very high highs like mirrorball also isn't there supposed to be a love triangle here about james and betty and whatever

**brenda\_official** (5.529): i swear im not sabotaging taylor this album is just so boring. evermore is better but only slightly

**astrologicalangel** (5.400): I'm honestly getting pretty sick of the all lowercase aesthetic for song/album titles

**purplechilipepper** (5.059): 6.5 I kinda want to give it an 8.0 for the meme tho

**frogaranaman** (5.000): Swifties stale topic

**xxrandooxx** (4.200): 4.2 I mean I have never been a fan of Taylor Swift so… sorry swifties

**bespectacIed** (4.000): Hollow, soulless, derivative of smaller indie artists' works, reductive of the folk genre, mind-numbingly boring, uninspiring, full of pretentious lyrics, white,

hikkaru: thank you SO MUCH !!! to everyone that participated and followed along with the reveal, as well as for putting up with the last minute switch to revealing on discord due to kosmi's unexpected flop. hopefully the Black Conscious Classics rate will have a better home to its reveal (which you should totally attend next weekend)! hosting is always a blast for me and this was no exception, cohosting what will likely be the biggest rate of the year that had four of my absolute favourite albums of 2020 with /u/ignitethephoenix and /u/akanewasright was so great!!

TiltControls: What a rate!!! Congrats to The Weeknd for pulling off a deserved (though predictable) win!!! Misandry can get out!!

As always, [Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) have been updated! Also if you have the rate tool that should be updated automatically as well.

**Songs**

Oh boy, where to begin

Blinding Lights. What a great winner! It now holds the record for most 11's for a song with 45, breaking the previous record held by Praying and Cruel Summer at 36. For high score, it just barely misses the top 20, but it's at a solid 28th place overall

And on the opposite end of the scale there's BWBB. [For BWBB see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ma2tl8/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_3/grq7jcw/?context=3) for a more detailed breakdown, but in essence it shattered the old zeroes record with 58 (it also used to be 36). A record that will probably not be broken any time soon.

Taylor lost a few records today, but the Swifties might be happy to know that august managed to get on the top 10 for most 11's at #9 (tied with Running Up That Hill from Winners 2)

And now more Dua news: though it was outshone by BWBB, Good in Bed still gets a consolation prize and also ends up in the top 10 for most zeroes at #8.

**Artists**

What a rate for the Weeknd! He know becomes the 6th person to win more than 3 rates thanks to his two previous wins for Love Me Harder and I Feel It Coming. He also jumps to #6 for most 11's for artists, ahead of Beyonce, Lorde, Britney, and Kesha.

On the otherside again... though she had a modest 10 zeroes before this rate, Dua's managed to ascend to the high spot of 6th for most 0's with 92. Also if Dua's only two songs rated were Boys Will Be Boys and Good in Bed she'd still be in the top 10 for most zeroes.

In non-Dua news, Taylor Swift holds her records for most songs rated, most elevens, and most zeroes (and probably forevermore). It's not even close. She has the 11's and 0's record held by more than 120 11's and 0's than 2nd place for both lists

Gaga moves up to the number 2 spot for most songs rated (though more than 25 songs behind Taylor) and The Weeknd moves up to the top 10 for most songs rated too (and is the only male there)

**Rates**

Congratulations to our three of our hosts Akane, Hikk, and Yetti for hosting the 2nd largest rate of all time!!! Only just narrowly falling under last years' Ultimate. That's must have been a lot of ~~0's for dua~~ ballots. Great work getting everything running despite Kosmi flopping!
