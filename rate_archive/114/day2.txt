Ultimate Ultimate Rate Reveal Day #2
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/m9d588/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_2/

Hi besties, welcome back to the 2020 Ultimate Ultimate rate, where we hate men (or, well, the one man that's here) but also ranked Boys Will Be Boys, Free Woman, and Mad Woman among the bottom third of all of these songs. Who will survive today's bloodbath and make it to Day 3? Join myself, u/akanewasright, and u/ignitethephoenix in [**the official popheads discord server**](https://discord.gg/tC2DG6xy) as we reveal **#40 - #21** of the main rate and **#10 - #5** of the bonus rate. Once again we apologize for the inconvenience of having to use Discord for the reveal, as plug.dj is now long dead and the replacement known as Kosmi could not handle our power yesterday. We will begin the reveal at **3:30 EST**, or about an hour after this post goes up!

Here's some stats:

* [**230**](https://pastebin.com/04QtQdR8) of y'all gorgeous popheads participated. That makes this the second most participated-in rate EVER, only behind last year's ultimate rate.

* The overall average score was **7.550**!

* The average controversy score was **1.795** (so anything with a higher controversy score than this should be considered divisive in some manner!)

**akanewasright** (7.5): Ah yes. The song that people were clamoring to go out for all of day 1, out literally immediately in day 2. This feels about right, to be honest. I do like the song, but it has never been my favorite off the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I actually really love this track, I feel like it really suites the mood of the title. I feel like I‚Äôm sailing on a lake while listening to the track. Sure she does seem to be using a thesaurus here but it doesn‚Äôt bother me and it‚Äôs a nice change of pace.

**hikkaru** (7): Like with The Weeknd, I can really easily see why this is a bonus track. Some of the lyrics are a bit clunky and sonically it's not really that interesting either. It's fine, I'll listen to it, but it's not a highlight of the album at all.

---

#Tweeted it

**mayolizard** (11): actually so good. I don't care. I love this song so much.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): love this one

**CarlieScion** (10): taylor really pulled out a dictionary for this, huh

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song makes me feel like a poet tbh.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): she‚Äôs giving me Matty Healy levels of pretentiousness (elegies eulogize me? really?) but fuck me if I said I didn‚Äôt eat up every last bit of it lol

**jexan13** (10): wig? drowned

**jimmy345960** (10): i like the tweet line sorry. I think it takes a story thats timeless and then dates it and makes it hers.

**rickikardashian** (10): when this dropped and all i saw were swifties freaking about words like ‚Äúcalamitous‚Äù or ‚Äúinsurmountable‚Äù was when i realized that we need to get a lot of yall into barbz university

**skargardin** (10): one of my favorites on the album

**waluigiest** (10): the extremely heavy handed ‚Äúive come too far to watch some name dropping sleaze / tell me what are my words worth‚Äù is so fucking funny

**whyishestaring** (9.9): It's not 10 because I do admit the lyrics can be a little clunky at times, but this is one of the most dreamy songs she's ever done, it was definitely worth the wait

**ktajlili** (9): TAKE ME TO THE LAKES WHERE ALL THE POETS WENT TO DIE

**mms82** (9): I get the bonus tracks, but this is the perfect ending track and wish we had it since the beginning

**overscore\_** (9): Still a great album closer

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): welp, this was an ending and a half. Taylor, do you need to see someone? Are you alright?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.5): i like this sonically so i will look beyond this but like the lyrics by themselves sound like an annoying ass art student lol

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): Taylor is lucky this sounds so good because I really want to drag that ‚Äúwords worth/Wordsworth‚Äù bit

**bespectacIed** (8): Could've replaced a song or eight on the main album

**cremeebrulee** (8): i don‚Äôt mind this song but i get why it‚Äôs a bonus track. it‚Äôs a little try hard but i like the chorus

**KennyEarthman** (8): nice closer

**musical\_pyn** (8): the MELODRAMA of this song is so good and what I want from taylor when she is explicitly writing about her own life

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I know I say this about most bonus tracks but this feels like such a bonus track

**thePotatofairyy** (8): ooooh that intro in particular is nice to the ears

**wryn\_** (8): so powerful it makes me astral project into the body of a tumblr user

**1998tweety** (7.5): deservingly was left on the dlx, its cute but fits here perfectly

**bbfan132** (7.5): i get why it was left off the album but it‚Äôs pretty good

**bluepupz** (7.5): The soaring choruses and strings are my favorite parts of the song.

**camerinian** (7.5): I think I'd dig this more if I was a fan of really old Taylor, cos this seems just like a levelled up version of that. It‚Äôs noice, but it doesn‚Äôt really hit me deeper than that

**ColsonBakerr** (7.5): it's kinda cringy but that whole feeling of escapism really resonates right now.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It‚Äôs cute
[/r/popheads/comments/m9d588/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_2/grmc440/]

=====

hikkaru: #Drown me in the lakes

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): oof big words make head hurt

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): ‚Äúwith no-one around to tweet it‚Äù - Taylor "phones are bad" Swift

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): :5

**fallenriot** (7): it‚Äôs cute, but the evermore bonus tracks are leagues better

**intheaftermath** (7): I can't listen to this without thinking of the weird Swiftie memes about Swifties needing to Google half of the words on this song. What was that? Why?

**nooodisaster** (7): This song is what Swiftie's think their diary entries sound like.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the bridge really elevates it. haven't listened to this one much

**rslashpoopheads** (7): it's time for a swim __^

**slimboyfriend** (7): Where is Merriam-Webster's co-writing credit?

**Vromega** (7): I would have given this a 8 or more but I didn't understand the point of making a "bonus track" so I'm removing for this absurdity

**zagreux** (7): taylor swiftspeare

**Stryxen** (6.9): i ain't reading all that but good for you, or sorry that happened

**jasannn** (6.5): I forgot that you existed.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): As with most bonus tracks (in this rate and otherwise), it's unnecessary

**twistedpython** (6.5): Boring but with a bit of English class thrown in

**aliensexist** (6): It's not the literary masterpiece some people think it is tbh. Maybe if everyone hadn't made it out to be the new Shakespeare I would appreciate it more...

**booksandplantsand** (6): someone took a british lit course

**CrimsonROSET** (6): you know, still water can cause bugs to breed in it. Taylor is not following any guidelines by making this song not even move an inch.

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): The instrumental and melody are top-tier, but good lord do I hate songs where the artist complains about being famous

**ryjomom** (6): i too would like to go to the lakes.

**vayyiqra** (6): "these hunters with cellphones" shoutout to my bestie /u/Gews and his pathological fear of 5G.

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): Very pretty but the lyrics are so prententious

**vagenda** (5.1): Taylor is usually a pretty smart lyricist so why is it that when she tries to sound ‚Äòsmart‚Äô she ends up with some of the most inane lyrics of her career. Make it make sense

**followingfreeways** (5): there are some parts of this song that are really lovely but overall the lyrics are embarrassing to me and it feels like she tried too hard. the melody of the chorus is really nice and i don't hate it but i don't really like it that much either. "name dropping sleaze tell me what are my wordsworth" come on.. i am embarrassed

**frogaranaman** (5): what‚Äôs y‚Äôalls favorite lake, mine is the one where poets go to die

**mythicalbeaste** (5): not a very worthwhile addition

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): better than hoax at least

**Tedyonce** (5): the word ‚Äòtweet‚Äô just doesn‚Äôt belong in 99% of songs, especially ones like this

**xxrandooxx** (4.6): not bad

**LesApfels** (4.5): The Evermore bonus tracks outsold

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): is it bad? honestly no but it makes NO sense on this album and I don't think Taylor takes advantage of the gorgeous instrumentals. It's just a puzzling song to include.

**wavingwolves** (4.5): there's a reason why this wasn't in the album

**runaway3212** (4): Mediocre

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (4): I can see why it is a bonus track.

**hunnybee12** (3): the twitter line makes me want to die

**sirpancakeXI** (3): i don't understand the purpose of this song it is boring.

**vintagebathingsuit** (3): this is the most pretentious shit i've ever heard, sorry taytay

**Bombay\_Mapper** (1.9): I tried loving this song. I really did, I promise. But it's too goddamn wordy, and the 'no one around to tweet it' lines just ruins it forever.

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): taylor has UNLOCKED NEW POWER: THESAURUS

**givebackmysweatshirt** (1): not popheads clogging the entire sub with individual posts about a bonus track for this

**MrMoodle** (0): I was gonna give my 0 to Boys Will Be Boys, but I feel like that song is at least slightly self-aware. One thing I‚Äôll give this song is that I actually do like the instrumental, it‚Äôs very pretty and I‚Äôm glad they went for something different here. But fuck these lyrics are the cringiest shit lmao. I‚Äôve tried to listen to the song for the instrumental a few times but then I‚Äôll hear some shit like the elegies eulogizing or the rose growing with no one to tweet it and my head just sinks into my body. If I was the kind of kid to write poetry or keep a journal or something, this is the kind of thing I‚Äôd write in 7th grade with a thesaurus in hand and then in the present day I‚Äôd internally die every time I thought back on it. This song legitimately gives me secondhand embarrassment, it takes itself so seriously and I just can‚Äôt stand it.

**MrSwearword** (0): "take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die" FUCK ALL THE WAY OFF at such pretentious garbage uttered.

**purplechilipepper** (0): I'm sorry swifties but this reads like bad poetry from a tumblr girl who just discovered Keats. I've read a hundred variations of the line about the rose coming out of frozen ground and they're always eye-roll inducing

**hikkaru** (10): I will never get the hate this gets from not only people that aren't the biggest on Gaga but even her own damn fanbase, it's such a fun bop and the drums, rolling mechanical sounding synth, and vocal sample are all intensely catchy and infectious imo. I know personally I was really excited for what was to come after hearing the leak, but unfortunately most others do not feel the same about this song seeing as it just barely squeaked into day 2 even though it was a single.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A divisive lead single for some reason, I don‚Äôt know what else people wanted from Gaga for the lead single. It‚Äôs a fun, care free bop! I guess people find the chorus lacking and the production a bit much but I think other than Rain On Me, this was probably the best song to lead with. Maybe if this wasn‚Äôt released in a pandemic and we could actually club and party to it people would feel differently

**akanewasright** (7.5): Despite an early 11 for the song, this was never doing all that well in the rate. I was always conscious of the fact that the song wasn‚Äôt making day 3, but it didn‚Äôt quite hit me until we had the final results that Lady Gaga‚Äôs literal lead single didn‚Äôt even make the top half of the rate. As for the song itself‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm always a little hesitant to say that I like it, because the chorus is barely there and overall it‚Äôs not really the same caliber as we‚Äôve come to expect from the artist behind some of the best, most influential pop music of the past decade, but‚Ä¶ what can I say? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fully up to her standard, but this is one of the biggest dance beats on the album.

---

#Kindness Punks

**zagreux** (11): It's sad to see that everyone treated Stupid Love as a 'generic dance-pop' track when it very clearly isn't one. Stupid Love is about seeking validation from others even when you know that you shouldn't. This is the greatest piece of music in the history of mankind and needs to be preserved. freak out, freak out, freak out.

**brenda\_official** (10): im always going to like songs with this type of synth where it goes dundundundundun like in dancing on my own

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Overhated methinks.

**frogaranaman** (10): this song fucking sucks, probably the worst song ever released

**J\_Toe** (10): I don't care what you say, I love the song. The video is a little too similar to Physical, which is unfortunate as it was released second. Also, I remember r/popheads clowning the beat for sounding like the intro to Trixie Mattel's youtube videos. Yes, it's from a sample pack. That's what sample packs are used for. You guys were being the r/popheads equivalent of this meme: https://www.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/a69cv3/to_shame_the_designers_of_the_aquaman_movie_poster/

**MrSwearword** (10): a banging piece of synthpop goodness that gets way too much hate [it was to bring Gaga back from all this fucking ASIB shit and it did]

**nooodisaster** (10): This aged like fine wine, grew like bamboo, appreciated like Gamestop stock in January. In February 2020, an electropop banger about wanting and celebrating love, plain and simple, seemed trite and basic. By April 2020, it damn near felt like an act of resistance.

**purplechilipepper** (10): yeah haters this is getting a ten, I lose my shit every time the production jumps back in on the final chorus

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is probably my favorite song on this album, weird iphone power rangers video and all

**ryjomom** (10): I‚Äôm a kindness punk ready for the kindness spunk.

**skargardin** (10): bop serotonin rush etc etc

**Tedyonce** (10): it‚Äôs cheesy and it slaps

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i do not trust people who prefer rain on me to this

**waluigiest** (10): I give this a 10 for the cultural hold it had on my life. I feel like every pre-pandemic moment of 2020 was consumed by this song. I was obsessed when it came out and I can‚Äôt quite place why I was so into it. Maybe it was just such a long time since we had a true Gaga club banger.

**cocosairdep** (9.5): The musical equivalent of sucking dick.

**outsideeyess** (9.4): this song fills me with so much adrenaline, LOVE that prechorus

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9): I don't know why everyone hates this song so much, it's classic.

**ColsonBakerr** (9): bop.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): No yeah, this is the best song on the album, no doubt about it. Say what you will about Gaga, she‚Äôs really good at picking singles.

**hunnybee12** (9): it only hits me when I‚Äôm driving on the highway

**jsonphile** (9): honestly a total bop I don‚Äôt know why so many were underwhelmed when it came out

**mms82** (9): great upbeat fun song

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This would bang at clubs but those don't exist anymore :pensive:

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): people hate on this song too much, it's a bop!

**vayyiqra** (9): I didn't like this when it came out but now I must accept it is a Stupid Bop.

**wailord\_fan** (9): honestly deserved better.

**wasian-invasion** (9): I stupidly love it. Deserved a music video shot with an actual camera

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): A lot of people dislike this one, but I think it's totally fun and cute?

**KennyEarthman** (8.5): good song but not worthy of being the lead single

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): I hated this song when I first heard it, but now I really like it. It‚Äôs classic Gaga and classic Gaga is always welcome.

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I liked this when it was released, then didn‚Äôt really like it when the album was released, then went back around to liking it

**Stryxen** (8.5): I stupid love this song idc freak out freak out freak out

**xxrandooxx** (8.2): I can‚Äôt not think of H*mosexuals and iPhones when I hear this song

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I too want Stupid Love (to do good in this rate but it won‚Äôt)

**astrologicalangel** (8): this is a little better every time I listen to it

**booksandplantsand** (8): so fun!

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): i remember listening to this thinking when i hear it in a club it would go off. well that never happened. still, it's a fun bop

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the way this song got the reverse Ariana treatment where people liked it at first but eventually more and more people started hating it üíÄüíÄüíÄ

**jledzz** (8): idk it made me happy

**ManofOranges** (8): Thought this song was gonna be my 0 prior to me starting this rate. Suprisingly, it's actually not going to get my 0--I've actually mellowed on it quite a lot over time--but my initial reaction to this song was a mixture of shock and disgust. It just sounded ugly. There's no other way to put it. Honestly, I still think it sounds ugly. But it's an ugly that I've become accomodated to.

**mayolizard** (8): ok h&m

**mythicalbeaste** (8): this one really grew on me

**shhhneak** (8): Gaga‚Äôs best lead single since Just Dance naur it‚Äôs trew.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): grown on me

**wavingwolves** (8): sounds like a born this way reject and this is a compliment

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): its camp its camp

**bluepupz** (7.5): This is super catchy. The MV did not deserve to be shot on an iPhone lol.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I love the "hooo"s

**seanderlust** (7.5): you know what never mind what I said on that one dua lipa song, this is my hottest take of the rate: stupid love is great and i'm tired of pretending it isn't. the pitched up jvst say yes sample, the climax with her little whoo!. are the lyrics basic? is "I want your stupid love" a dumb hook? sure, but it's fun. i'm having fun. my love is as stupid as the rest of me but at least i'm bopping.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): a fun bop

**bbfan132** (7): overhated by some, this is pretty fun!!! kind of repetitive but i like the driving beat

**engifear** (7): This one took a bit of time to grow on me. I initially hated it when it was first released, but I enjoy it a lot more in the context of the album

**fallenriot** (7): it was a bad lead single choice, but it works well within the album

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7): cool instrumentals.

**wryn\_** (7): if you hate this you're a coward

hikkaru: 
#I don't want your stupid love

**rickikardashian** (7.8): im so glad that once the album dropped there were some good songs, because then i could stop pretending like i loved this

**intheaftermath** (7.5): ngl I'd love to see a version of this with a reimaged chorus without the high pitched voice things

**sirpancakeXI** (7.5): it is not as bad as people claim to be, but i won't say it is a standout track

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): it's more perfect illusion than bad romance, but that bassline hits deep. Remember pre-pandemic when all the gay clubs started playing the leak because we were all so starved for new Gaga music?

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Eh. Not her best but not her worst

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): #NeverForget the way this leaked so widely that it got on the popheads charts like a month before she bothered to release anything

**thePotatofairyy** (7.2): Honestly I flip flop on this song a lot. Its fun with a great pre chorus but that drop is not it

**vagenda** (7.2): Stupid Love? More like Stupid Choice For A Lead Single! Hahaha. Anyway it‚Äôs fine

**1998tweety** (7): meh

**followingfreeways** (7): this bops but it's kind of obnoxious

**Hogwartsreject1912** (7): This'd be super fun in a concert imagine she's like "yeah YEAH" and then points the mic to the crowd and we all go "I WANT YOUR STUPID LOVE!"

**jasannn** (7): The Good In Bed of the album. Not bad as everyone says but too repetitive with meh lyrics.

**Parabox314** (7): when this leaked... what a moment.

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's plastic and absolutely mindless but its fun

**rslashpoopheads** (7): the gays told her to dig BTW out of its grave and she obliged

**whyishestaring** (7): she's fun but kinda basic

**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): It's an okay song but not really lead single material.

**Iris3271** (6.5): Sounds like a mid tier Gaga song that's for sure

**LeninaCrowne94** (6.5): I‚Äôd rather listen to Bad Romance

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (6.5): The build up right before the chorus is so good and then the chorus hits and...

**fishingfor8** (6): Pretty outdated, a common theme for this album

**Flegasaurus** (6): we are 2 songs in and i'm getting bored already

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): one of my least favorite from this album, very meh

**jimmy345960** (6): little bored of this song

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): A worse version of Bad Romance, but not totally unlistenble. I feel like her fans bullied her into making her old type of music again, so it's understandable this is the end product and I'll go easy on this. I hope at least Little Monsters are happy with Stupid Love.

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): this just feels like something that a kpop group would have released in 2018

**alwayswords** (5.5): retail store classic

**cremeebrulee** (5): i can‚Äôt believe this was the lead single for this era

**lolcevan** (5): i like this one more than i probably should

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): this isn‚Äôt like...terrible

**musical\_pyn** (5): I mean, I used to like this song

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): This is gaga's weakest lead single imo (yes, Perfect Illusion was better), it was hyped up as Gaga's big return to dance-pop, but instead of building off of all her experience and experimenting with other genres since then, it feels straight out of 2013 in the most boring ways possible.

**twistedpython** (4.5): The fact that Gaga's team seriously thought it would be a good lead single is comical to me. Also, the leaked version was so much better than the official release.

**oscarbrierley1** (4): really annoying

**pig-serpent** (4): Honestly most of this song is pretty good but I hate "I want your stupid love love OOOOOOHHHHHH" and those 5 seconds overshadow my feelings for the rest of the song.

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): this song just reminds of the queer eye intro song and I can‚Äôt really tell you why

**izeasklapaucius** (3): dumbass

**runaway3212** (3): I just hate how ugly the drop is, her vocal performance feels very oversingy here

**bespectacIed** (1): Plain awful. Still confused how this was released let alone became the era opener

**rosecult** (1): worst lead single ever

**throwaway9374929** (1): such a weak lead single

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (0): When Stupid Love was released, I was so happy to see Gaga doing pop music again. Like this was on my replay playlist until Chromatica came out. Now that the full album is out, this song felt like a sore thumb and it made me enjoy the song less because of how easily this track could be cut out from the album. Like I went from "Alice" to "Rain on Me" while listening to the full album once and they transitioned so smoothly that Stupid Love wasn't really needed in the album at all. I don't really hate the song but this is definitely the weakest song on the album. And well, I have to give a 0 in this rate so I guess Stupid Love is getting that score from me.

**plastichaxan** (0): no

**TheCatApologist** (0): just why is this song on the album, let alone the lead single

**ignitethephoenix** (9.9): This is such a strong opening to the album. I love the spacey production and the twinkles that come with it. Although I wish his voice wasn‚Äôt shrouded with effects at some parts, it does add a cool flair to the song. This is very close to a 10 for me however I feel like the last 30 seconds of the song are a bit lazy but this track I have come back to so much because of the beginning and build up to the chorus (which is basically the middle section of the song, the structure is super interesting here). Abel does a good job of expresses his heartbreak through the lyrics as well trying to come to terms with it.

**hikkaru** (8): This is a really solid opener and I appreciate it more for it doing that in the album than I really do as a song on its own. For that reason I'm okay with it leaving now, but that's not to say I dislike it! I love a lot of the production elements here, but as a whole I would say After Hours is surprisingly mid-back loaded for a pop album so it's not the best the album has to offer.

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song does exactly what it needs to in the context of the album, and the last minute or so is absolutely brilliantly done in every regard, but I don‚Äôt really come back to it when I‚Äôm not listening to the full record.

#We love opening tracks

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A GODDAMN OPENER

**booksandplantsand** (10): still as obsessed with the darkness of this track as the day it dropped

**runaway3212** (10): the best opener in this rate

**seanderlust** (10): it's dark, it's gripping, it's musically bananas. strap in kids - it's gonna be a ride.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): loving the instrumental

**skargardin** (10): what an opener

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): A brilliant way to start this dark-pop album.

**Flegasaurus** (9): yeahh this is good this is how you open an album

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): what a way to start an album!

**jayjaysortagay** (9): I love the spare, spacey production of this one

**mayolizard** (9): love the instrumental

**nahaalne** (9): The middle section of the song when the instrumental changes gave me chills

**relibee2** (9): the first half kinda drags on a bit, but the second half oh god

**wavingwolves** (9): this is quintessential the weeknd

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): THE SYNTHS‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm ascending

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like this quite a bit; it‚Äôs a nice intro, but it feels more like an intro than a full song in a way?

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.5): Starts off slow but the second part is immaculate

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): ok the lyrics were hard to understand but still good af

**intheaftermath** (8.5): I swear to god this sounds exactly like The Planetarium theme from Little Big Planet 2...

**thePotatofairyy** (8.5): Great opening, song continously grows in a beautiful way

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): ooh that‚Äôs some nice vocal layering

**celladonn** (8): Love those icy synths but I wouldn't really listen to this outside of the context of the album

**ColsonBakerr** (8): it's alright

**frogaranaman** (8): huge pandemic mood

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): This song is so glittery and then transitions into this heavy (borderline hyperpop???) beat. Introduces the album perfectly

**ManofOranges** (8): It was a nice song, but it doesn't really kick in until like half way through. What's up with that?

**musical\_pyn** (8): just a chef's kiss of an opener

**oscarbrierley1** (8): good opener

**ReallyCreative** (8): I have no idea what he's saying but girl, I'm living

**SmileAndTears** (8): Bop

**Tedyonce** (8): I like the synths

**Stryxen** (7.8): it's so close to being great but it just needs that little boost in intensity he teases us with

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): what a start to the album. It really sets the scene, and gives a taster of what to expect.

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): Solid first track that sets the mood for the upcoming album.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i forget how pretty abel's voice is also this production feels really reminiscent of a girlie but i cant remember who

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): strong opener, the last two minutes are the strongest point

**bluepupz** (7): This is a nice atmospheric intro. I like how floaty and dreamy his vocals are.

**aliensexist** (7): Not the biggest fan of the vocals but the backing track and production are amazing and make the perfect opener

**bulforster** (7.4): I'm into this until the drum machine comes in and cheapens it a bit.

**Iris3271** (7): The second half of the song makes it

**J\_Toe** (7): it's very atmospheric and enigmatic (yeah, I know every music review calls Abel enigmatic).

**just\_thonking** (7): Sets the scene nicely imho

#Lonely

**bespectacIed** (7): Bop but the vocal processing is too much

**cremeebrulee** (7): this production serves but as a song it‚Äôs kind of a forgettable to me.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I wrote a comment about being weirded out on him trying to write Take on Me again again but I prefer that part of the track so maybe he had a point.

**engifear** (7): good intro but a little less exciting compared to the rest of the album

**jimmy345960** (7): Its a nice little vibe to start the album but this albums beginning lets me down compared to the end. Sadly.

**ktajlili** (7): Mr. lonely but darker

**LesApfels** (7): I love the second half but the intro is just so boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this was pretty good at first

**MrSwearword** (7): fine for what it is, but sounds like it should be in the middle of the album

**nooodisaster** (7): Moody opener

**pig-serpent** (7): The sound design on this is neat and I like the 2nd half of the song. Unfortunatly the first half doesn't reall amount to much.

**Roxieloxie** (7): Me when i feel alone again

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I like it but I always forget what it sounds like once it‚Äôs over

**static\_int\_husp** (7): honestly a lot of this album feels like a cry for help

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7): successfully scared me of ever being alone again

**twistedpython** (7): Love the beat, hate whatever vocal effect they used

**waluigiest** (7): their voices are very different, but the atmosphere reminds me of Kid Cudi‚Äôs albums

**WillamThunderfuck** (7): I really dig the dark and heavy vibes of this song, but it doesn‚Äôt fully connect with me.

**xxrandooxx** (7): honestly dare i say this song is dream pop‚Ä¶ nevermind i wrote this before the trap beat.

**shhhneak** (6.8): rather forgettable song in the grand scheme of the album but holy moly what an intro to the production.

**fedefreakss** (6.7): we're all alone during this pandemic

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): some interesting stuff in the instrumental but the vocals are a bit too distorted for my taste

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): ooh when the bass comes in at 1:22, heck yeah, baby

**vintagebathingsuit** (6.5): this is so spacey and cool. i wish his vocals weren't so buried in the mix though

**1998tweety** (6): this started as a snooze then picked up a bit

**Alumineous** (6): Weak opening track. Gorgeous vocals, though.

**fallenriot** (6): i don‚Äôt love the super distorted vocals for the whole song, but it‚Äôs a decent opener

**ImADudeDuh** (6): a meh opening tbh

**jasannn** (6): Decent opener that sets the tone of the album but kinda forgetable. I also have no idea what he is saying.

**mythicalbeaste** (6): feels a bit long

**outsideeyess** (6): listened to this a few times and nothing really stands out to me

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): An underwhelming opener. I think I would appreciate it more somewhere else in the tracklist, but it's too sleepy to be the first out of the gate. His vocals are amazing as always though.

**vayyiqra** (6): Takes a while to get going but once it does it comes together

**hielord** (5.8): Not the best but it's okay

**Brendon-Urine** (5): It's alright... but this album really deserved a better intro.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): The production is great, but I can't figure out what's actually going on here.

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): I quite like this album but as an opener this is kinda bland

**NotWith10000Men** (5): don't like the effects on his voice. Sounds a bit muddled. The synthy guitar in the middle is nice

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): it's good as an opener but doesn't hold up on its own tbh

**mms82** (4.5): boring and annoying, but a cool enough beat I suppose

**ryjomom** (4): Vocoder realness. Vibey but not my style.

**KennyEarthman** (3.5): I can barely understand the words in this one + the beat switch isn't doing anything for me

**givebackmysweatshirt** (3): saving this as an answer to the inevitable 'what is the best album with the worst intro track?' thread

**lolcevan** (1): this is my first time listening to the album, so not off to a great start lol but i‚Äôm really looking forward to it

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): An overhated track because it sounds more like her debut album or an Angele track, I think this is super cute and fun. The two of them have great vocal chemistry and I love the pulsing xylophone thing is the background. Maybe if this wasn‚Äôt a bonus track (aren‚Äôt you glad we aren‚Äôt rating any moonlight edition songs because they would have flopped hard here) it would placed slightly better but this placing make sense (also it was even lower before but slowly climbed up over time).

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song has done nothing but grow on me since I first heard it. It‚Äôs not a guaranteed smash like most of Future Nostalgia is, but it‚Äôs a really cute bop that holds together really well. I‚Äôm happy it made it to day 2 at least lol

**hikkaru** (5): After Future Nostalgia became my AOTY for 2020 I was extremely hyped for the release of new music to be added to the album, but unfortunately this one is a tad disappointing for me and serves as a bit of a regression for Dua in my opinion. It kinda reminds me of her debut album with the tropical house sound that I'm not a huge fan of, so I'm perfectly fine with it leaving fairly early on in the rate.

#I've got a fever

**useless-sheep** (11): a serve idc

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The amount of times I‚Äôve bopped to this is too many

**booksandplantsand** (10): i have a lot of Thoughts and Feelings about this song and associated music video

**lillipup03** (10): I was gonna write this comment in French but realized that if there are any native French speakers, they‚Äôll point out how terrible I am at it...

**ManofOranges** (10): The gag of releasing this song literally in the middle of a pandemic... I don't give a shit though it's a hit.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): hearing this for the first time and it actually slaps

**moooo566** (10): This song owns. As a big fan of foreign language music, I love the language switching, and I'm very pleased to have been introduced to Ang√®le who is fantastic in her own right (stream her album Brol La Suite after you're done with Your Woman, which, again, you should stream).

**musical\_pyn** (10): I can‚Äôt believe dua created the pandemic to promote her second best song

**plastichaxan** (10): overhated bop

**sirpancakeXI** (10): It is time for popheads to get into angele's music. You dont need to know french in order to enjoy it.

**zagreux** (10): THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN A PART OF THE STANDARD TRACKLIST. FIGHT ME.

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): This is such a sexy and flirty song, love it

**wryn\_** (9.5): my friend lives like a minute away from where they shot this music video and he didn't even go to crash the set. he hadnt even heard of dua lipa. what is the point

**ryjomom** (9.1): Serving French realness for than fries

**jasannn** (9): A girls' night out bop.

**jexan13** (9): Dua Covidlipa

**mythicalbeaste** (9): they sound wonderful together. love the instrumental

**overscore\_** (9): The comment about the clapping sounding like cheeks ruined it but it's still great

**runaway3212** (9): We need more French - English songs

**mms82** (8.5): the songs seem disjointed, the Ang√®le song and Dua Lipa songs would both be amazing on their own, but together their voices aren‚Äôt a perfect match

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Doesn‚Äôt fit the vibes of the album at all, but still a bop

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): underrated! the production is subtle but catchy, and dua and angele have great chemistry.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): This definitely feels closer to an Angele track than a Dua one, and I'm not really sure how well they work on the track together, it feels more like two separate solo versions mashed together, but I still enjoy it

**2dina3dworld** (8): Angele went off here

**ColsonBakerr** (8): i actually really liked this

**cremeebrulee** (8): i can‚Äôt think of a covid related joke here but i‚Äôm sure at least 17 other people will come up with something

**CrimsonROSET** (8): hypothermia.

**frogaranaman** (8): I appreciate that you guys didn‚Äôt make us end on Boys Will Be Boys

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): insert pandemic joke

**shesdoingyoga** (8): It‚Äôs cute but doesn‚Äôt really fit the album, so I can see why it was left off at first and it shouldn‚Äôt have been tacked on until the deluxe edition came out

**vayyiqra** (8): Shouldn't this be in the bonus rate instead of here anyway it's good I like Ang√®le

**wavingwolves** (8): fun!!

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.9): J'adore cette chanson :) but I wish the song had more French in it cause those were the stand out parts for me. also Ang√®le carried lolü•¥

**rickikardashian** (7.8): if dua released this as a single after being infamous for travleing in the middle of a pandemic, i cant find any excuses as to why

**LesApfels** (7.5): Of course she has a fever she keeps ignoring covid regulations

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): Can we talk about how this video has better wlw queerbait energy than whatever the fuck yall think is going on in betty

**TiltControls** (7.5): dua's 2020

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): maybe if she wasn‚Äôt traveling in France she wouldn‚Äôt have a fever right now

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.3): a vibe but it's more of an angele track than a dua one

**team\_kockroach** (7.3): Wow, Ang√©le‚Äôs got a great voice

**shhhneak** (7.2): c‚Äômon lesbians let‚Äôs go lesbians.

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): This is one of the better songs she decided to include on the Deluxe/Moonlight Edition.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Ang√®le kinda eated this

**camerinian** (7): Dua and Angele have great chemistry, like to the point where I was surprised the video didn‚Äôt become a full bisexual fantasy like Prisoner. They‚Äôre cute together what can I say

hikkaru: 
#Stayed at home

**1998tweety** (7): snooze

**Bajuko** (7): As I was listening to this I was confused why I couldn‚Äôt understand what was being said before I realized it was in French lol

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): This is what happens when Dua didn't stay at home like she should in Break at Heart.../s

**Misentro** (7): Ang√®le carries this. It's a pretty song but I can't unhear "I tourette" which really kills the vibe.

**nooodisaster** (7): I thought my Spotify was glitching when the random ass clapping started.

**skargardin** (7): cute little europop moment, I think Angel√© is a way better fit for this song than Dua though

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this is fun! Angele's voice is angelic

**Tedyonce** (7): insert covid joke

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): why does the beginning of this sound like someone jerking off??? are we just gonna ignore that

**waluigiest** (7): I didn‚Äôt know this existed. It‚Äôs nice, but then it‚Äôs over

**wasian-invasion** (7): interesting production but doesn‚Äôt really fit with the actual album hon hon hon

**NotMajorTom** (6.9): So glad that there's a bit of French in this Rate. At least she didn't sell out like Chris.

**bbfan132** (6.5): i guess it‚Äôs pleasant enough but it bored me, felt like it lacked energy

**bluepupz** (6.5): I like this song's vibes, it's really smooth and chill. It feels a bit short, but I like the emphasis on the beat. As with some of the other songs at the end, I don't quite know how this fits into the album overall.

**jsonphile** (6.5): popheads try to not make covid reference challenge

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): it's not clicking for me rn but I can see it in my studying playlist

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): she really couldn't even get COVID by herself she had to drag over a feature while showing symptoms

**fallenriot** (6): cute, but i can see why it was left off the album

**fishingfor8** (6): I'm not very familiar with this song in all honesty but I don't love it. Ang√®le kills it though.

**J\_Toe** (6): sounds kind of generic in comparison

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Every new song Dua releases as a single after the first Future Nostagia album drop makes me question her a little more

**twistedpython** (6): Catchy but I don't speak French and that keeps me from fully appreciating this song

**xxrandooxx** (6): this song really is me talking to my thermometer after getting 1 hot flash and thinking I have covid nineteen.

**aliensexist** (5): I don't like Dua's parts but Angele is chef's kiss

**bespectacIed** (5): Let's clear the searches! DUA FEVER DUA DRY COUGH DUA COVID DUA SUPERSPREADER

**Bombay\_Mapper** (5): Average. It doesn't match the rest of the album

**Flegasaurus** (5): those claps sound weird they sound gross i don't like the claps

**slimboyfriend** (5): This song is so low effort compared to the actual songs on Future Nostalgia (minus, y'know...)

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (5): a disappointing end, I feel.

**mayolizard** (4): this song boring

**pig-serpent** (4): Very few of the qualities that make me love Future Nostalia as a whole are present on this song.

**Stryxen** (3.5): i'll let everyone else make the covid joke

**vintagebathingsuit** (2.5): dull as fuck

**brenda\_official** (2): very unenjoyable

**MrSwearword** (2): this feels so pointless to the era, but at least the French vocals are great

**NotWith10000Men** (0): the claps at the beginning sound so terrible I thought my speakers had finally kicked the bucket

**ignitethephoenix** (8.7): This song was a grower for me. I love the production and Gaga‚Äôs vocals here. Just a solid album cut all around even if sometimes I feel like she saying enema

**hikkaru** (8): Okay, at this point in the album I can really see how people feel when they say that the album's production and general sound are just a bit too generic and uninteresting, but you know what? I'm an absolute sucker for house-pop music and I love the direction Gaga went in for Chromatica so I'll continue to eat it up. This is a fine track but not one of the best on the album, but it's still an 8 for me because it bops.

**akanewasright** (2): There are few things more damning that you could say about a song than ‚Äúit was pointless‚Äù, and my god do I find this song pointless. I don‚Äôt think any aspect of this song is exceptionally memorable or good (aside from Gaga‚Äôs vocals obviously). It‚Äôs not even fun to tear into, since it feels like there‚Äôs nothing to write about. This song just makes me mad, because I know what Gaga is capable of. I know that she can produce better beats, that she writes better hooks, that she finds more interesting meaning in her music, but Jesus Christ this does not exemplify any of that.

---

#Enigma popstar is fun

**2dina3dworld** (10): I like it, even if it's pretty similar to the rest of the album

**bluepupz** (10): This picks up with the first chorus and just keeps on going. There's something so satisfying about trying to sing along with the chorus (and only sounding 2% as good as her lol).

**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): The vibe's so magical. I love this song.

**bulforster** (10): I think your vocals are powerful enough to break all the stigma on their own queen!!

**kwcty6888** (10): a pop masterpiece

**MrSwearword** (10): Gaga vocals going super saiyan, yes please.

**mythicalbeaste** (10): that growl she does in the last chorus OOMPH

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I like the hook a lot

**SmileAndTears** (10): THAT BRIDGE!!! THE VOKELLS!!!

**waluigiest** (10): this is an astounding Gaga vocal performance!!

**ColsonBakerr** (9.5): i'll be judging stan twitter but i also very much want ms. gaga to step on me

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): WE COULD BE LOOOOVERRSSSSS

**intheaftermath** (9): She sounds so good on the prechorus and I live for it

**seanderlust** (9): the we could be laavaaahs we could be anything you waaant part causes me to ascend every single time

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Her vocals carry this

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): it had this ethereal vibe to it

**vayyiqra** (9): Why is it so good every time this album has horns on it?

**wasian-invasion** (9): yes mommy pls be my enigma

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): I could totally see myself bopping to this on planet Chromatica. My fave part is the ‚Äúis it just a siiiihiiiggnnnn???‚Äù

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): Easily the best vocals on all of Chromatica so far, and one of the less hateable, more depth inclusive BloodPop cuts.

**mayolizard** (8.5): cute

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I can't hear "openminded" without thinking about joe rogan being so openminded his brain fell out

**wardrum5** (8.5): I always get this mixed up with Replay. I wish they weren't back-to-back in the album

**Alumineous** (8): I-I-I-I hallucinate when you call my name.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): This is such an underrated track. As someone who loves the titular ARTPOP track, Engima feels like a sequel because they share a similar vibe.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I actually forgot this was the name of Gaga's residency.

**fallenriot** (8): i love how the gravel in her voice shows a bit more on this one

**followingfreeways** (8): oh this BOPS

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): coming at us w ariana level pronunciation but it's still a bop

**nooodisaster** (8): The most Broadway/Tony Bennett/over-the-mother-fucking-top song on here. I'm a Broadway slut tho, so it grew on me.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a bit classic Gaga anthemic but it's pulled off well in comparison to songs like Fun Tonight or Free Woman

**ryjomom** (8): I‚Äôll be her Enema

**1998tweety** (7.5): a cute lil bop

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): One of the better deep cuts from the album.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.4): I would say it, but I figure every other response is. But I suppose I did just say it.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the bridge kills it but it‚Äôs alright overall

**bbfan132** (7): her voice sounds great here!

**KennyEarthman** (7): the vocals... looking forward to a live performance

#No, you can't be my enigma. 

**CarlieScion** (7): chromatica be like One Song

**cremeebrulee** (7): i thought she was singing ‚Äúi‚Äôll be your animal‚Äù the first time i heard this

**CrimsonROSET** (7): With all the times she tackles themes of technology, you‚Äôd think those elements would be in the production. It‚Äôd make it better, but this one DOES have my favorite horns moment, so yay.

**frogaranaman** (7): the fuck is an enigma? isn‚Äôt that the thing gay men put in their asses to clear out or that thing they gave Charli XCX

**J\_Toe** (7): the saxophone is random but welcome

**skargardin** (7): the beat honestly has me a bit underwhelmed but she did serve VOCALS

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I feel like this works better as promo for a Vegas show than outside that

**Stryxen** (7): I've heard this on Eurovision

**twistedpython** (7): The song is great but the title is just a bit too close to the name of a traumatizing Vegas residency that seems to have been erased from the cultural memory (and for good reason)

**rickikardashian** (6.8): this soured on me out of nowhere‚Ä¶ my original score was a 10‚Ä¶. what happened?

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I don't get the love for this one.

**booksandplantsand** (6): her voice sounds great but usually a skip for me

**jasannn** (6): The production is pretty good but the vocals are too campy for me.

**runaway3212** (5.5): I liked this at first but it feels very dated that said the last minute is pretty fun

**camerinian** (5): I'm sure this would be a great concert opener. Shame about gestures vaguely

**fishingfor8** (5): I'm having a hard time having any emotions about any of these songs. I guess I like this less than the rest of the 5s on this album so I guess it's a 4? But I doesn't feel like a 4 so who knows. I guess it's a 5

**jimmy345960** (5): love the word but dont like the song that much

**Roxieloxie** (5): this is the part of the album where its getting harder for me to tell the songs apart

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i feel like this song tries too hard to do too much and it falls flat

**whyishestaring** (5): This was so boring, I'm sorry

**wryn\_** (5): she gives it so much on the vocals and it sort of still ends up flat

**xxrandooxx** (5): Someone already made an enema joke so imma just give it a five and move on

**Flegasaurus** (4): i'm like starting to get mad... you telling me this is the same person who made the fame monster??? :(

**pietrohonkhonk** (4): Why is she shouting?

**pig-serpent** (4): The quiet verses of this song work very well, but the chorus isn't as big as it deserved to be, and the sound of the stacatto strings and Gaga's "I'll I'll be your enigma" annoy me greatly.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): behe

**thePotatofairyy** (4): I just really dislike how she sounds on the chorus. Stan her more than anyone but I dislike how she sounds in this.

**wavingwolves** (3): i really wish she had taken off the "did you hear what i say?" part

**bespectacIed** (2): come on, vogue

---

**hikkaru** (9): Blinding Lights is one of the best produced songs I've ever heard so I'm going to score it generously no matter who is singing, but I have to say that Rosal√≠a does not fit very well at ALL. This was released right around the announcement of Grammy noms so I think it was supposed to be some promo based around that which, well... yeah...

**ignitethephoenix** (9): obviously still a slapper, but Rosalia doesn‚Äôt completely work on it me. I feel like the production does not work with her style / voice at all. They sound great singing the chorus together though.

**akanewasright** (8.5): Okay here‚Äôs the thing: this remix is absolutely worse than the original, and really cheaply done, but I still love it. I love Rosal√≠a and her upper register so much, and I remember literally squealing while on a call with some friends when I heard this for the first time.

---

**intheaftermath** (10): the Spanish lyrics threw me off the first time I heard it, but I love how she covers the soprano harmony

**musical\_pyn** (10): honestly I think I might like it better than the original?? At least it sounds fresher

**plastichaxan** (10): people like to call this remix unnecessary but is it really i mean it has rosal√≠a

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Rosal√≠a eated. those harmonies!

**Tedyonce** (10): I know I‚Äôm tasteless but I think it slaps

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.7): Rosal√≠a absolutely slides on this omg

**aliensexist** (9.5): Why do I always play myself by sleeping on good artist. Smh @ myself

**mysario** (9.5): I respect the confusing "Livin La Vida Loca (Spanglish Version)" vibes this presents! Plus the moment they harmonize is actually v good

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): Aunque Rosal√≠a y Abel no tienen ninguna atracci√≥n, las armon√≠as de Rosal√≠a me dan la vida

**jsonphile** (9): well it‚Äôs still blinding lights which is an amazing song. But not sure Rosal√≠a is necessary on the track

**KennyEarthman** (9): wow Rosalia came in early

**seanderlust** (9): rosalia doesn't add much here to an already a-list song, but she sounds cool singing the prechorus so i'll still give it a good grade

**outsideeyess** (8.8): if it ain't broke...

**cocosairdep** (8.5): While I like Rosal√≠a voice, her verse and bridge seem so out of place. She sounds much better in the chorus.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): I'm glad we have a version with the harmonies in, but rosalia brought nothing to make this better than the original

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): It‚Äôs obviously worse than the original but y‚Äôall gotta stop acting like these kinds of remixes completely ruin the song

**Brendon-Urine** (8): the harmonies go off fr

**ReallyCreative** (8): not really an improvement, still great but I was hoping for more

**waluigiest** (8): this feels unfinished or clumsy? But I do like it

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): this doesn‚Äôt really add much but its still Blinding Lights so what am I gonna do? not like it? impossible plus the outro sounds nice this way so there‚Äôs also that

**Misentro** (7.5): Rosal√≠a sounds beautiful and I love their harmonies, but the energy doesn't match, it feels like two songs stapled together.

**celladonn** (7): ...yeah I really do not think Rosal√≠a sounds good at all here. Her voice is just not made for this sort of song

**ColsonBakerr** (7): sorry but the original was just so good i can't listen to this with an open mind

**cremeebrulee** (7): its ok

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): I like Rosalia but her vocals really don't match with this song tbh. Hope Weeknd and Rosalia does another collab that is an original song because their chemistry is really good.

**frogaranaman** (7): ROSAL√çA I love you but you sound out of place here

**ImADudeDuh** (7): wow she does not have the energy for this.

**jasannn** (7): The harmonizing on the chorus is on point but I think this would've worked better as cover instead.

**ManofOranges** (7): Sorry to Rosal√≠a but I do NOT think that her voice really suites the song all that well. When she started singing, it just hit me like truck but in a bad way.

**mayolizard** (7): it's interesting but it shouldve been save your tears

**runaway3212** (7): It's not bad but the original really outsold

**vayyiqra** (7): This is good but idk if we needed it.

**wasian-invasion** (7): this feels like the least necessary of the guest remixes

**hielord** (6.9): lmao all latinos hated this, it wasn't that bad imo

**bbfan132** (6): this remix was totally unnecessary lol

**DaHumanTorch** (6): it isn‚Äôt bad but literally.........why?????

**fallenriot** (6): what is joe biden‚Äôs plan to stop pointless remixes

**LesApfels** (6): Just translate all of Rosalia's solo lines into Spanish it's not that hard

**purplechilipepper** (6): I was hyped for this but she doesn't really fit? it's still enjoyable though

**sirpancakeXI** (6): as much as i love rosalia she didn't add anything new to the track

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Rosal√≠a's voice is way louder than the rest of the mix, you would think they would fix that on the remix for the biggest song in the world

**TiltControls** (6): i've listened to the original so much that it was just kind of... whiplash not to hear the Weeknd start the first verse

**relibee2** (5.7): did ROSAL√çA need to be on this? Like at all?

**hunnybee12** (5): no

**jayjaysortagay** (5): there's no reason for this to exist

**ktajlili** (5): I think this song works better as a solo performance because it's literally about him being by himself. As good as Rosalia sounds, I think her addition weakens the song.

**ryjomom** (5): Rosalia didn‚Äôt necessarily fit with the production or vibe of the song.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (5): this is so jarring at first but it sounds alright after a while

**twistedpython** (5): Makes the original better but not by much

**2dina3dworld** (4): these two don't work together, I'm sorry.

**Alumineous** (4): No.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (4): this just doesn't work, rosal√≠a's breathy voice is not a good fit

**nootnoot781** (4): rosal√≠a does not fit in here AT ALL üíÄ

**skargardin** (4): I like Rosal√≠a a lot but she is not a good fit for this song

**wavingwolves** (4): doesn't add anything and also gives me a rosal√≠a jumpscare everytime it starts

**AHSWeeknd** (3): no ‚ù§Ô∏è

**bespectacIed** (3): rosal√≠a's parts unlistenable

**booksandplantsand** (3): i remember why we forgot about this one

**fedefreakss** (3): their voices don't go well together sorry

**thedoctordances1940** (3): I thought absolutely anything would go well with this instrumental but evidently not

**wardrum5** (2.5): the way Rosalia comes in and just MURDERS all the momentum and energy of the song

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1.5): I don‚Äôt know why they had Rosal√≠a shout instead of doing a smoother softer flow. I genuinely think this song did not need to be remixed not even a little bit LOL I like Rosal√≠a but she sounds so awkward on here

**Bombay\_Mapper** (1.3): The only saving grace of this is that Rosalia sounds nice. U-N-N-E-C-E-S-S-A-R-Y

**lolcevan** (1): idk what the point of this was i suppose all the remix budget went to doja

**mythicalbeaste** (1): just why. It actually made the song worse

**akanewasright** (8.5): I simply love everything Julia Michaels touches. It‚Äôs a nice, calming song. It‚Äôs not as big and flashy as the other two Ally songs, but I think it‚Äôs nice

**hikkaru** (8): This is a nice song. I don't know, I don't have much else to say about it really. It's nice, and I think that's all it goes for as one of the basic pop songs Ally sings in the film.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why is the worse than The Cure... I guess they need to have Ally mediocrely sell out.

---

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Why lie, I would 10000000% trade Gaga for Ally

**KennyEarthman** (10): best song on ASIB OST

**rosecult** (10): this could also cure covid 19

**ryjomom** (10): The vocals have me craving more of Ally‚Äôs music. She kinda flopped after that Grammy debacle. This is her Teenage Dream, but she‚Äôs really in her Witness era now.

**skargardin** (10): kinda wild how Ally's "generic pop singles" are better than some actual newer pop girlies' ones

**twistedpython** (10): Better than The Cure and I'm not sorry

**AHSWeeknd** (9): bop of the century

**mythicalbeaste** (9): Adore the upper part of her voice

**runaway3212** (9): This is genuinely so fucking great

**aliensexist** (8): I so badly wanted to make a decision between this and the cure but this is just too good to rank lower üò©

**fallenriot** (8): the chorus is too understated but still pretty nice and chill

**nooodisaster** (8): Me when I'm 10 hp and the Mercy is fucking around with her pistol.

**SmileAndTears** (8): Now THAT is a bop

**wavingwolves** (8): ally does it better than gaga part 1

**mysario** (7.8): I still haven't this movie

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I've only ever heard Shallow and I did not expect the other ASIB songs to sound like this

**1998tweety** (7): mild bop [2]

**vayyiqra** (7): Gaga has the cure but still needs to be healed herself ... that's deep ... :pensive:

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this is just The Cure again

**xxrandooxx** (6.5): This also could be a strong contender for the pfizer/moderna theme song <3

**rickikardashian** (6.2): this is the cure again but more forgettable

**astrologicalangel** (6): repeat what I said for The Cure

**bbfan132** (6): i liked this when it came out but it‚Äôs kind of bland now imo - the chorus is still pretty good though

**hikkaru** (9): Yet another stellar bridge from Taylor here, providing a great climax for the song, and I also just absolutely love the subdued instrumental, the absolutely gorgeous melodies, the way Taylor's voice goes up at the end of each line, it's just all so beautiful and totally fitting for a song about, well, illicit affairs. I think it's a bit tragic that it's leaving so soon into day 2, since it's one of my faves on the album, but I guess some of y'all disagree with me on that.

**akanewasright** (6): This song is carried by its chorus and bridge. We tend to oversell those two parts of a song, but uh‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ this song doesn‚Äôt have the verses to support either of those things. The chorus isn‚Äôt even one of her best, to be honest, but it is solid and catchy. The verses, despite solid lyrics, don‚Äôt really work for me at all. The bridge is an album highlight, but there‚Äôs not much for it to bring together.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): the title of thing song is my favorite things about this. I kind of find it forgettable otherwise. There‚Äôs nothing that stands out really from it, it‚Äôs just a pleasant filler track on Folklore.

#Cheaters

**vintagebathingsuit** (11): easily my favourite taylor swift song ever. such stunning maturity and a gorgeous instrumental

**1998tweety** (10): whenever i listen to this song i insert gay vibes into it. love ha

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): the don't call me kid line kills me, and I love the tone of her voice in this

**hunnybee12** (10): I saw an edit of this over a compliation of fleabag and the priest and now I like it 100x more

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): this song me had me worried for the state of her life for a little LOL, but then I found out it was just a story. it gives you a very clear visualization of the progression of events, and it has a decent vocal performance.

**intheaftermath** (10): this was almost my 11 because of how tender it is. However, the Long Pond Version is just so much more intimate and stunning, that it felt like an injustice to give the album version the high score

**musical\_pyn** (10): best song on the album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I‚Äôve never even been in a relationship, let alone cheating, but Taylor really makes me feel like I know the experience of having an affair with this song

**vagenda** (9.3): On first listen, I ‚Äì a god-forsaken mess, an idiotic fool ‚Äì had this very low in my Folklore rankings, thank goodness I saw the light

**shhhneak** (9.1): AND üëè YOU üëè KNOW üëè DAMN üëè WELL

**aliensexist** (9): We stan 'godforsaken messes' and 'idiotic fools'

**booksandplantsand** (9): phenomenal, emotional delivery

**deadline4mymemories** (9): love the evocative lyrics

**just\_thonking** (9): Another grower. I think the storytelling here really stands out

**mythicalbeaste** (9): love her vocal in this one

**wavingwolves** (9): don't üö´ call üìû me üòî kid üß∏ don't üö´ call üìû me üò¢ baby üçº look üëÄ at üí¢ this üëá godforsaken üôè mess üóØÔ∏è that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è you ü§¨ made üò£ me ü§•

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8.5): i didn't originally love the song the first time but wowww this is so good

**mayolizard** (8.5): I‚Äôm so glad this builds up

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Probably the best thesis of folklore, as without the fiction hook, we never would have gotten this song. And I'm so glad we did. It would work as a poem the words are so cutting and mournful. But since it's a Jack production you know the production is also fire.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): you might not catch it on the first listen as it is very subtle, but this song is about cheating

**runaway3212** (8.5): This is really good, but it reminds me just a bit too much

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): a cute song

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): you'll be üò≥ when you get home

**bulforster** (8.3): I dislike that I can relate to this.

**jimmy345960** (8.3): the less good cheater song

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): :5

**AHSWeeknd** (8): it‚Äôs alright

**bbfan132** (8): didn‚Äôt care for it much at first but it‚Äôs grown on me, v pretty folk song

**ColsonBakerr** (8): I didn't know how I'd feel about a song about well, 'illicit affairs' but that fucking bridge and that outroo!

**fallenriot** (8): don‚Äôt cheat besties!

**followingfreeways** (8): okay this song is tough because i love the lyrics and i LOVE the bridge but i do not like the melody in the verses at all. like at alllll. i wish she would have done that differently

**mms82** (8): lyrics are a 10 but the actual song is a 6

**pat-rickstar** (8): Favourite part is "a dwindling mercurial hIGH"

**twistedpython** (8): I've never wanted to get married just so I could cheat on my spouse more than I do when I listen to this song

**waluigiest** (8): my favorite part about folklore and evermore is that a lot of it is taylor saying ‚Äúim bored so I will write as if my relationship is toxic and crumbling‚Äù

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): It‚Äôs good but there‚Äôs just something about the ambience/mood that doesn‚Äôt work for me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.8): the bridge is SO GOOD

**thePotatofairyy** (7.6): Not into that highnote but that ending is sonically satisfying

**ktajlili** (7.5): prefer this to TIMT but only slightly

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): one of the better bridges on the album

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Biden should've picked Taylor Swift over Buttigieg for head of transportation because her bridges are always so strong.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (7): Really good lyrics, but August is the superior other woman song.

**CarlieScion** (7): ivy is the superior cheating anthem

**CrimsonROSET** (7): If the guitar just kept building up and up and up this‚Äôd be an 11 contender, but it all just resets as the verses come on. The last verse is what I wanted the whole song to be.

**MrSwearword** (7): at least there's a very clear intent about highlighting an affair from more than one perspective.

#Kids, babies, godforsaken messes, idiotic fools

**shesdoingyoga** (7): This is my least favorite on the album, I find it extremely forgettable and if I had to cut a few songs to make this a more typical album length this would be the only one I would definitely cut

**Stryxen** (7): probably her technically best song here but it just never did it like that for me except for the masterful bridge

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7): pretty okay, kind of needed a dictionary to understand it lol.

**bluepupz** (6.5): Honestly, I don't fully understand which perspective in the illicit affair she's singing about.

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): a dwindling mercurial high

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): Taylor getting her fans to scream ‚Äúdon‚Äôt call me kid‚Ä¶‚Äù maybe she heard when Charli called he fanbase 5 year olds

**Awkward\_King** (6): the lorde powerpoint if taylor and jack were fucking during reputation

**Roxieloxie** (6): i see why everyone is getting stuck on this string

**seanderlust** (6): you showed me colors I can't see with anyone else - me when god finally lets me see those colors only shrimp can see

**skargardin** (6): this is cute but not top tier as the rest of the album i fear

**frogaranaman** (5): https://twitter.com/nav_shyboy/status/298928714710913026?s=20

**rslashpoopheads** (5): eh

**plastichaxan** (4.5): forgettable

**2dina3dworld** (4): the intro piqued my interest, the rest was a bit of a letdown

**camerinian** (4): you'd think a song about illicit affairs would be a bit dangerous and have a bit more of an edge to the message than "hey illicit affairs they exist and are illicit"

**cremeebrulee** (4): zzz

**wasian-invasion** (4): this is where the "going high for part of each line" thing gets a little tiring

**xxrandooxx** (3.8): why not solicit affairs huh?

**ryjomom** (3.5): just like an affair i wish this was kept secret

**bespectacIed** (3): This is a watered down 'for emma, forever ago' track, how did justin vernon not sue

**ReallyCreative** (3): cheesy, corny, maybe the title is accurate because she should serve jail time for this

**Flegasaurus** (2): probably controversial but i don't see how this is any better than like ed sheeran or something

**akanewasright** (10): Fucking ROBBED. One of my favorites in the rate, period. Everything about this song works for me. The melody is just that solid, the emotions expressed are that sincere, and the interpolation is used to perfection. And Abel‚Äôs voice on this track‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs always been a solid vocal presence, but he just sounds lovely here. I‚Äôm mad about this cut, but I guess balladphobia strikes again.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): While this will probably be victim to balladphobia, I think it‚Äôs an excellent ballad and his vocals here some of his best. The SNL version is so good and I appreciate the sample from ‚ÄúYour Song‚Äù in the chorus.

**hikkaru** (9): A ballad done right in my opinion, I love the flourishes of synth through it and the general throwback vibes of it. When I listen to this I generally choose to listen to the SNL Live version (which is on spotify you love to see it), since it has some extra added production elements that I love and Abel honestly sounds just as good live as he does here on the studio recording. I think this is an okay place for it I guess since there ARE a lot of really stellar tracks ahead of it, but at the same time I fear there is some balladphobia going on here.

---

#LIVING for this song!

**noctilucentvibes** (11): the it's not you it's me speech but make it something i really want to hear

**booksandplantsand** (10): BELT IT ABEL

**fishingfor8** (10): I'm a sucker for this

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): the weeknd ended up being my most played artist in 2020 with this as my most played weeknd song. right around then there were viral tik toks about what your top played artist says about you. apparently if your top played artist was the weeknd, you either love blinding lights or you want to break up with your s/o and run them over with your car. needless to say my bf does NOT like this song after he saw it was my top played lmao. anyway it's a 10.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I remember when this was revealed on SNL, iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): just because of that sole drum giving a lost gem of mid-80s pop.

**skargardin** (10): these synths are heavenly noitstrue

**Tedyonce** (10): MAKE THIS THE FIFTH SINGLE ABEL

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): i played this on repeat when after hours first came out, so beautiful

**WhyDidEverIBother** (10): I just love the selflessness of this sentiment, really made me excited for the album when I saw this on SNL.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9.2): Points cut for sounding too much like Harry Styles, but overall really good

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**cremeebrulee** (9): this song lowkey made me cry the first time i heard it lmao if balladphobia takes this out to early i will cry again

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this could be played in Euphoria

**followingfreeways** (9): this chorus just really makes me feel some type of way, i love the elton john sample, this is just a great song

**izeasklapaucius** (9): i just know you guys' balladphobia will be shown at the reveal

**jayjaysortagay** (9): Elton John sample and vocals!!!

**KennyEarthman** (9): slow prom dance vibe

**musical\_pyn** (9): those bass hits right before the chorus are one of the best moments on the album

**mythicalbeaste** (9): just beautiful

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): very wholesome, this album's growing on me.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): me except not "again" im just scared to live in general

**twistedpython** (9): The chorus on this song is beautiful and this song is criminally underrated

**waluigiest** (9): a sweet but sad ballad :-) :-(

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Excellent use of sampling here!

**aliensexist** (8.5): Again, the feels

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): OH i worked out what this song reminds me of it's everybody dies by kim petras :jail:

**bbfan132** (8.5): wish this had the intro that was featured in the snl performance but it‚Äôs still good!!

**bluepupz** (8.5): I love that he sampled "Your Song" at the end. He gets his emotions across pretty well, and I can hear the regret in his voice.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.5): his ballads are so good‚Ä¶ but knowing the balladphobia in here rip :((((((

**Iris3271** (8.5): The way he belts the chorus...ugh

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): "if I held you back, at least I held you close" damn. That bridge took me out too

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This feels like it should be a closer

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): i feel like i'm at a prom in the 80s when listening to this

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): those drums are so dramatic I love it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.3): the weeknd has the prettiest voice in this rate, i said what i said

**shhhneak** (8.2): honestly wish it included more ‚ÄòYour Song‚Äô samples. If you‚Äôre going to go for it really go for it.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): the Elton John sample is iconic

**Alumineous** (8): Abel only does ballads sparingly, like with Twenty Eight or Die For You, so y'all better LISTEN.

**ColsonBakerr** (8): i'm sad for people who haven't heard this song before... i'm also just sad

**fallenriot** (8): nice synth ballad, lyrics game on point

**Flegasaurus** (8): i thought this sounded like another song but the other song i was thinking of was also this song

**frogaranaman** (8): that transition is so SMOOTH, you almost think it‚Äôs a beat switch. god fucking DAMN

**rslashpoopheads** (8): one of the best tracks on this album even if it's just a cover of I Can't Help Falling in Love With You

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This sounds like it would be really good live

**wavingwolves** (8): I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND üíî

**outsideeyess** (7.7): another really solid chorus melody

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): balladphobia + misandry = a recipe for a robbery methinks

#Terrified

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): I forgot how this song goes as soon as it finished

**jasannn** (7.5): I always get this song confused with Hardest to Love.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): this one is a little fillery but he kinda snaps there towards the end

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): I can‚Äôt tell if this is trying to be a power ballad or not. Also, the ‚ÄòYour Song‚Äô sample is sooo random lmao, it gives me whiplash everytime I hear it

**runaway3212** (7.2): It's filler, but it's not bad

**hielord** (6.9): The transition from Hardest to Love to this song is lovely

**seanderlust** (6.8): it's fine. it's a pretty standard breakup ballad. the most interesting part is the interpolation of elton john

**ryjomom** (6.5): If a girl sang this I'd be living

**aladreeladon** (6): The lyrics are pretty good it's really just the melodies for me

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Well this was a struggle to get through. The outro was fun but the payoff was not big enough.

**just\_thonking** (6): I don't really think the Your Song sample added anything to the song tbh

**wryn\_** (6): the elton john bit is kind of corny but its still better than sine from above

**camerinian** (5): weird ballad placement but ok

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): this shit is cheesy as hell lol

**ktajlili** (5): Snore

**mayolizard** (5): boring idc

**nooodisaster** (5): The only song that, to me, misses it's mark. Doesn't quite pull off the sweet, bubblegum vibe. When the best part of the song is the interpolation, that's a problem.

**Stryxen** (5): me when folklore is my highest average album

**jimmy345960** (4): Bridge best part but i completely forget this when it shuts off. One of my least favorites for this fantastic album.

**pig-serpent** (3): Wow this is dull

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): My pos ex told me something similar after our break up

**akanewasright** (9): One of my favorites on the album, to be honest. It‚Äôs just that damn adorable. The verse melody just sounds like a nostalgic smile to me, and every line is just sweet as sweet can be.
 
**hikkaru** (7.5): This song deserves a low placement solely because it references her worst song, no it's true it's true. After some really stellar tracks this one is cute but no August or anything, really I thought it might place a tad lower than where it actually is here. But still, it IS cute so I can't be too upset.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): I love the little plucky strings of this song, it makes it stand out more. I feel like this song is kind of underrated on this album, although it‚Äôs definitely not one of the strongest songs here. It‚Äôs another cute track (I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve said this like a bazillion times already) that is smack in the middle of a 17 songs album.

**LeninaCrowne94** (11): Gorgeous instrumentation, lyrics are so personal to her but intensely relatable to anyone who‚Äôs had to overcome a lot of shit to get to a place of happiness.

**skargardin** (9): this is so cute
 
**TiltControls** (9): a fun bop
 
**mayolizard** (8.7): yass grenade
 
**jexan13** (8.5): The backing guitar steals the show
 
**2dina3dworld** (8): hell yeah, the red invisible string of fate
 
**booksandplantsand** (8): sappy but good
 
**CarlieScion** (8): bad was the blood was the song in the cab!!!! the rhythm of this song makes me so happy
 
**intheaftermath** (8): me-e-eeeee o-o-oooooooh i'm the only one of me
 
**J\_Toe** (8): if Your Name was a Taylor Swift song
 
**MrSwearword** (8): it's far jauntier than I expected
 
**pig-serpent** (8): Very basic song but I like the guitar riff.
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8): Willow did this sound better
 
**Stryxen** (8): eight was the score of the song which was called invisible string, i predict it left early day 2
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this song is so cute and soft. it sounds like summer
 
**twistedpython** (8): Cutesy and wonderful for her but I'm chronically single and this song kinda just rubs that in
 
**wavingwolves** (8): i wish i was so in love i started believing "fate" is something that exists and i'm important enough for it to take notice of me that it put someone on my way in a purposeful way
 
**bbfan132** (7.5): definitely pretty but didn‚Äôt fully capture my attention
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): Really cute filler. I imagine Taylor wrote this just to kinda flex on Joe for their anniversary or something. Like "here's some chocolates and roses and btw I wrote you a love song." Fav lyric: "Cold was the steel of my axe to grind, for the boys who broke my heart / Now I send their babies presents."
 
**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): ‚Äúgreen was the colour of the grass‚Äù - Taylor Alison Swift
 
**1998tweety** (7): shes cute
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (7): :5
 
**bluepupz** (7): This is so cute and reminds me of Paper Rings. I like the imagery that she uses throughout the song.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7): maybe the true invisible string were the friends we made along the way
 
**musical\_pyn** (7): similar to last great american dynasty, cool story and lyrics but just doesn‚Äôt do it for me
 
**Roxieloxie** (7): call me a love sick bitch but this is bopier so i can enjoy it
 
**runaway3212** (7): again lyrically great, but sonically a bit weaker than some others on this album
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): this is my most listened to track by 50% on folklore and it's genuinely not my fault. Spotify keeps bringing it up more often than the other folklore songs even though there's like 10 better songs on it
 
**hielord** (6.6): this song just feels... innocent?
 
**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): TIL grass is green, thank you taylor lyrical mastermind
 
**fallenriot** (6.5): bad was the blood. no further comment.
 
**Iris3271** (6.5): The references to her life and music are cute but the song dragged a little
 
**ryjomom** (6.5): flat toot, no boot or shoot
 
**ColsonBakerr** (6): sorry taylor. the premise is amazing, the story's cute but I really don't like the structure of this song
 
**hunnybee12** (6): ehhhh
 
**mythicalbeaste** (6): people love this one but I just don't see it
 
**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this song is not for the colourblind
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5.5): folkachu, I choose you! folky folky folk!~ __^
 
**wasian-invasion** (5.5): cute but doesn‚Äôt really work for me
 
**frogaranaman** (5): invisible string, just like a uhhhhhh.. I don‚Äôt know anymore, I‚Äôm giving up on trying to be funny with this album because it‚Äôs just so boring to me
 
**KennyEarthman** (5): the guitar sounds really similar to the cardigan one
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (4): Why do people like this song, it‚Äôs so one-note and boring
 
**plastichaxan** (4): forgettable
 
**bespectacIed** (3): What was the reason for singing like yoda?? That bad blood line is so cringe, rest of the song is beaut
 
**camerinian** (3): this is like the beta version of Willow.
 
**Flegasaurus** (3): i was gonna rate this higher but i got a bad wave of abdominal pain listening to it and it made me mad
 
**SmileAndTears** (3): I don‚Äôt like this at all. Couldn‚Äôt tell you why, I just don't
 
**xxrandooxx** (3): me walking through the jungle temples in Minecraft and not seeing the tripwires.
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): she really tried to subtlety bring back the me hee heeeeeeeeEEEEEEEE.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favorites off the album (although this isn‚Äôt a popular opinion) I love how grand and cinematic the prelude is before going into Alice. And Alice itself has an excellent vibe, with the key of the song it is in and the house production. I think this is a good introduction to the theme of dancing the pain away, as Gaga copes with feeling trapped and feeling like she keeps falling away from the light. Nothing like a fun Alice in Wonderland reference as well.
 
**hikkaru** (9): I really love the orchestral interludes on Chromatica and love that it starts right off the bat with one. Alice is also a really boppy opening track that is really relatable because my name also isn't Alice, it just really speaks to me it's as if she wrote it about me specifically.
 
**akanewasright** (7): I feel like the chorus is probably the thing that keeps me from rating this higher. It does feel a touch derivative all around, but the beat is solid, and I really like the verses (and the bridge). It‚Äôs just that the chorus feels a lot less substantial than it really could or should be.
 
---
 
**vayyiqra** (11): What a smash and a great way to open this album. It would take a long time to get into a whole analysis of it (just go on Genius) but this song feels in many ways like the early days of Gaga when she was dramatic and did Concepts and was weird (see: the heavily filtered vocals in the second verse) but it worked because she made such earworms. This song reminds me of why I loved her to begin with.
 
**ColsonBakerr** (10): fucking amazing
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this song reminds me of staying up for this release + being so excited hearing that opening orchestra ‚Ä¶ and then promptly being disappointed by the rest of the album LMAO i do think this is a great opener and even if the lyrics are kind of dumb, it still goes off
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): God, I loved the way how this album started and how it transitioned to Alice, the real opener of the album. I just know the song will serve harder with a futuristic Alice in Wonderland-esque music video.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This song tricked me into thinking the rest of Chromatica would be just as awesome.
 
**J\_Toe** (10): just listening to this makes me feel like I'm dancing with Petga at a blacklight rave
 
**KennyEarthman** (10): the transition is underrated and Alice is one of my most scrobbled songs
 
**MrSwearword** (10): aside from the lovely interlude [which was used for the SL video which...kthen...] Alice has great production even with the motif of Alice in Wonderland as escapism kind of working against it but not by much.
 
**oscarbrierley1** (10): the vibe i wish the whole album had
 
**shesdoingyoga** (10): The ending of Chromatica I reminds me of the soundtrack from the live action Grinch movie when he like realizes the meaning of Christmas or whatever
 
**skargardin** (10): Chromatica I is so monumental, the best of the three I think
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i'm still so mad this was released at the beginning of the pandemic bc alice makes me want to get high and dance for 24 hours
 
**zagreux** (10): Such a great opener tbh. I like the subtle reference to the fact that Gaga' name isn't Alice but she'll keep looking for wonderland. Also, the second verse is‚ú®
 
**team\_kockroach** (9.7): Chromatica I drags on a little too long, but goddamn. What a great album opener
 
**jasannn** (9.5): Great Opener but there's few songs on this album that live up to the hype and heights of this song.
 
**Roxieloxie** (9.4): oh yall were smart for putting these interludes together because now im forced to inflate my score to accommodate for how much i love these interludes
 
**1998tweety** (9): bop
 
**AHSWeeknd** (9): I can relate! My name isn‚Äôt Alice either!
 
**booksandplantsand** (9): idc how basic it is this is a serve
 
**brenda\_official** (9): the robot voice part is so yess
 
**Brendon-Urine** (9): this shit bussin
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): Alice isn't my favorite but damn, it's CONSTANTLY stuck in my head.
 
**moooo566** (9): Honestly I'm a bit of a sucker for anything that references Alice in Wonderland for some reason
 
**mysario** (9): Kingdom Hearts really stepping up their soundtrack quality
 
**pat-rickstar** (9): "Sick and tired of waking up" girl same
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (9): I‚Äôve never listened actually to the album in full but I‚Äôve heard a lot of the songs on their own and this one is pretty great, especially Chromatica I
 
**pig-serpent** (9): Amazing hook, solid synth choices, and no mediocre drop to complain about. Easily one of the best songs on the album.
 
**ryjomom** (9): Chromatica 1 is a perfect intro to the world of Chromatica. Also I'M IN A HOLE IM FALLING DOWN DOWN SO DOWN DOWN
 
**seanderlust** (9): i would love a version with more prominent strings. think like rasputin by boney m prominence. that sort of string accompaniment. I think you could combine that with the acid house influence here to make a BANGER. though it's still good
 
**sirpancakeXI** (9): the my name isn't alice line is just too catchy
 
**waluigiest** (9): a return to form
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.6): Great start to the album.
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): Alice. Single. When? Never, probably.
 
**astrologicalangel** (8.5): perfect intro to the album
 
**hielord** (8.5): yeah I love this song because my name isn't Alice either
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): Her name isn't Alice!! Like I don't know what else you want me to say.
 
**SmileAndTears** (8.5): love it
 
**ktajlili** (8): solid opener yas
 
**mayolizard** (8): hm
 
**musical\_pyn** (8): Great opener and I wish more songs here were as anthemic as this
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8): I'm a slut for violins and brass instruments. Solid opener
 
**outsideeyess** (8): I don't love Gaga's head voice but it grew on me
 
**ReallyCreative** (8): honestly still holds up
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): alejandro
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): Yeah the Alice in Wonderland trope is tired, but this song establishes Chromatica's main themes while being a solid homage to 90s house.
 
**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.8): the chromatica i strings bit is a bit too long but alice is a bop
 
**xxrandooxx** (7.8): This is classic, high Gaga drag
 
**vagenda** (7.7): Lady Gaga has done such amazing things to advance mainstream representation of people whose names aren‚Äôt Alice
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): Transition doesn‚Äôt really work well, and the song is repetitive. I wish Stupid Love was the opener.
 
**jimmy345960** (7.5): MY NAME ISNT ALICE
 
**wasian-invasion** (7.5): not the strongest lyrics but the strings and that beat tho
 
**wryn\_** (7.5): it is weird that she opened her super personal album with one of the dumbest lyrics but this is pretty classic

akanewasright: **2dina3dworld** (7): everything but the chorus boded well, but even that started to work after the second chorus.
 
**bespectacIed** (7): i like the vibe. Makes me think of dingy 90s techno nightclubs
 
**bluepupz** (7): I like the robotic effect on her voice in other songs, but I think it was a little overdone in the "sick and tired of waking up" part. Otherwise, I like the house elements here, and it's a nice opener.
 
**fallenriot** (7): a solid intro to both the album‚Äôs sound and lyrical themes
 
**fishingfor8** (7): this is the only album I dislike here so I may be a bit harsh given that I liked the other albums so much
 
**Flegasaurus** (7): did u find wonderland yet gaga
 
**frogaranaman** (7): you know what? it‚Äôs fun. it is fun and that‚Äôs all this album is trying to be!
 
**ManofOranges** (7): My name isn't Alice but it can't be if you like OWWW
 
**mythicalbeaste** (7): it's so impressive she had a hand in composing chromatica 1
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): probably the weekest intro of all the albums
 
**twistedpython** (7): Alice In Wonderland is totally overdone in pop music but this song is fun enough that I can just ignore the lyrical tropes
 
**thePotatofairyy** (6.7): It's just fine.
 
**bbfan132** (6.5): the first interlude/intro was pretty and alice is sort of fun! not the biggest fan of the production but it‚Äôs decent overall
 
**fedefreakss** (6.5): one of the three songs on this album i've listened to more than once and my favourite
 
**intheaftermath** (6.5): I know this is a big favorite but something about the melody of the opening lines doesn't work for me?
 
**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): I want to like the bridge so much since I feel like on paper I should love it, but it just doesn‚Äôt
 
**Stryxen** (6.5): what a lovely lady looking for wonderland, I wonder if her name is Alice... What was I thinking
 
**Alumineous** (6): My name is NOT SUSAN!
 
**CarlieScion** (6): is she parodying herself
 
**ChandelierFlickering** (6): love the intro but not the main song
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): I loved the orchestra in Chromatica 1, but I don‚Äôt really like her vocals/voice in Alice? It‚Äôs so catchy though.
 
**Iris3271** (6): Good production, too repetitive
 
**just\_thonking** (6): The chorus is less annoying than I remembered
 
**Tedyonce** (6): this song is a subtle nod to the fact that lady Gaga‚Äôs name isn‚Äôt ‚ÄòAlice‚Äô
 
**TheQueenOfVultures** (6): Alice Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta
 
**camerinian** (5): The one massive problem with Chromatica is how cliched a lot of the lyrical content is. Anyway here's an Alice in Wonderland metaphor
 
**nootnoot781** (5): chromatica i is so magical and then it just goes straight into mediocrity sigh
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (5): hmm-kay.
 
**wailord\_fan** (5): Chromatica's poor average, the interludes are my highs for this album. Alice's chorus is so insanely mundane, and it's going to be a recurring negative of this album. The pre-chorus is great, but WOW what a disappointing chorus.
 
**RandomHypnotica** (4): I do NOT like a lot about this track. The weird robot voice on the bridge, "My name isn't Alice", which just feels like a lyric the writers think is OH so smart and creative and clever, it's just obnoxious
 
**runaway3212** (4): I have two problems with this song, I just hate how the production sounds and lyrically I find it super lacking, I wish there were more references to the story and not just her referencing wonderland
 
**Awkward\_King** (3.5): gay song
 
**mms82** (3.5): just a boring way to open the album
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (3): the best part of this song were the memes pointing out that her name isn't alice
 
**wavingwolves** (0): i want to be clear and say i like the interlude but i irrationally dislike alice so much that i would give that song a -1 if i could

**hikkaru** (10): I love love LOVE this track and everything about it, and it pains me to see people underrate it so much. The build from start to finish is absolutely stellar in my opinion and frankly I could listen to that breakdown at the bridge on loop for hours on end. The production is the star here, with small elements being added as the song progresses until the breakdown is an immaculate release of energy after a long build up with its chopped up vocal samples, cowbell, and synths giving me that buzz. I am happy it at least made it halfway through day 2, but I would have placed it even higher if it was up to just me.
 
**akanewasright** (9): I love Julia Michaels as a songwriter, and one of my favorite things is hearing other people sing songs that were obviously penned by her. Selena Gomez is known for doing this super well (as she should be), Britney and Gaga have done great work singing her tunes, and so on. Dua pulls off Julia‚Äôs melodies *so* fucking well it should be illegal. Everything about her voice just emboldens and enhances everything already good about the song. Obviously she‚Äôs singing good material, and the instrumental bridge is an album highlight, but her performance on this song is absolutely top tier.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): A cute track, this lacks the oomph of some of the other songs on here but it is a pleasant listen still. The placement of this song makes sense pretty much smack in the middle of this rate. With so many strong tracks here, this definitely doesn‚Äôt stand out compared to most things here.
 
---

# Please come fuck me
 
**1998tweety** (10): underrated bop, its a bit weird but it works
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): the song begins with "somewhere in the middle, i think i lied a little" and it's the exact mid song in the album !!! i think that's rly cool
 
**bespectacIed** (10): The serotonin high from Levitating probably carried over this song, cuz I seriously believe this is the 2nd best song on the album. The production is so crisp. That distorted bridge is eargasm.
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): the only song on the album I'd call sexy tbh
 
**ColsonBakerr** (10): this girl is GOOD
 
**ellezol** (10): the build up in this one is so cathartic
 
**followingfreeways** (10): im obsessed with the tone of her voice in this song and i genuinely dont understand how people could not love this song
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): This song is so sexy but at the same time pretty please? ü•∫üëâüèΩüëàüèΩ
 
**hunnybee12** (10): probably my favorite on fn. it‚Äôs just effortlessly good
 
**MrSwearword** (10): my personal favorite song from the album, it's fucking amazing.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (10): I love this one!! Very underrated, that chink sound is mmmm
 
**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the way she builds on the chorus is too good
 
**Roxieloxie** (10): The best song about getting fucked on this album, and you all are just gonna have to accept that
 
**shesdoingyoga** (10): I‚Äôm already mad about how low this is going to end up placing. This was my favorite new song when the album dropped, the production details and her delivery are just so good and the way the song builds up the whole time is heavenly
 
**twistedpython** (10): The sound effects are very pleasing
 
**bulforster** (9.8): It seems like I have opposite taste to this album's stans since this is easily my favorite song from it and don't understand how people rank it in the lower half of the album.
 
**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): Super underrated track here, it's a bit more lowkey than the singles but it's SO DAMN GOOD
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): I love that this song is a bit slower from the rest of the album. I also love Dua‚Äôs vocals here, and the clunky sounds on the bridge
 
**ryjomom** (9.5): TrIcKlE dOwN mY sPiNe
 
**vagenda** (9.5): If you were a virgin before listening to this you aren‚Äôt anymore
 
**hielord** (9.2): This song is so dumb but it makes me feel like such a specific type of hoe
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (9): I love, love the production on this track.
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): the cowbell (?) / breakdown at the end elevate this song for me. probably my fave non-single
 
**lillipup03** (9): Honestly love how chill this is to the rest of the album.
 
**ReallyCreative** (9): still a solid track, expecting this to get robbed
 
**thePotatofairyy** (9): One of the biggest standouts first listen. Just sounds so crisp and fresh. A great midtempo where all stages of the song feel great
 
**vayyiqra** (9): Maybe the most underrated song on this album.
 
**waluigiest** (9): I don‚Äôt want to be dramatic but if this song came out earlier, her delivery of ‚Äúput my mind at ease‚Äù leading into the chorus would have turned me gay.
 
**wasian-invasion** (9): oh lord the BASS on this album
 
**Stryxen** (8.7): every song on this album is just Dua, a bass, and some quirky percussion and I eat up every single one
 
**aliensexist** (8.5): Cowbells!
 
**bbfan132** (8.5): i like the way this track flows
 
**jasannn** (8.5): It doesn't have as a good of a hook as the rest of the song on the album but wow, I forgot how good the production is on this song.
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): Lowkey a serve, I think she's getting dick down here and I'm happy for her.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (8): this song is just sexy
 
**MrMoodle** (8): If Dua is planning to mostly abandon the super high energy direction she went with on Future Nostalgia I hope her new stuff hovers around here. It's a good compromise. The production feels more modern, but it still has the attitude and the style and the details that make this album so good.
 
**pat-rickstar** (8): The way this builds is so satisfying
 
**sirpancakeXI** (8): i dont know if i am alone on this but the blessed madonna remix is so much better.
 
**skargardin** (8): she doesn't sell the sex of this song at all for me but the production is so insanely boppy thankfully
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): That's certainly an instrumental break
 
**TiltControls** (8): dua pretty please stop travelling
 
**wavingwolves** (8): smooth
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.9): Cool's cooler older sister. Still (kind of?) filler though.
 
**astrologicalangel** (7.8): I like this but the chorus seems a little off for some reason
 
**bluepupz** (7.5): The sounds and bells at the end of the song are great. I also like the beat.
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): It's too Julia Michaels whispercore for me to rate it any higher.
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): It‚Äôs certainly not a bad song, but compared to the other track it‚Äôs lacking a little

akanewasright: # Please stop

**Iris3271** (7): Cute, more mellow than the bops that preceded it
 
**pig-serpent** (7): If this was the worst song on the album I would have nothing to complain about. It's solid and features much of what is to like about the album, but it's not very distict.
 
**SmileAndTears** (6.8): Good but a bit too bare bone for me
 
**runaway3212** (6.5): This never hit like the other songs
 
**seanderlust** (6.4): the most forgettable so far on the record tbh
 
**J\_Toe** (6): certainly sounds like a Julia Michaels song
 
**ManofOranges** (6): When Dua sings "sweet relief," I thought she was singing "sweet release" with a lisp because it really did sound to me like she was saying "sweet releath."
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6): eh it's okay? I've really cooled on it
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): this is kind of boring ngl but the last 60 seconds is enjoyable
 
**TheCatApologist** (6): I can‚Äôt even remember this song and I‚Äôve heard this album a hundred times
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5.5): I'll give it an extra 0.5 for the cowbell
 
**2dina3dworld** (5): unremarkable
 
**AHSWeeknd** (5): a good interlude
 
**camerinian** (5): I literally always forget this song exists. Not that there isn't a place for more low key bops on the album but all this does is break up the massive momentum between Levitating and Hallucinate. Dua obviously does funk well, but not the sort of funk that is literally just bassline.
 
**Flegasaurus** (5): i dunno its just fine
 
**KennyEarthman** (5): it's not a skip but it's also very lacking
 
**mms82** (5): club future nostalgia versions are so much better
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (5): meh.
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): This is just too retro. If we're calling out Harry Styles for doing a rock pastiche then how is this getting a pass? Dua just took the most basic and boring beats of the 80s and made them into a song (this goes for the entire album tbh). The lyrics are a joke.
 
**fallenriot** (4.5): the prechorus is the only redeeming part of this song
 
**frogaranaman** (4): I think the biggest disservice throughout this album is how underproduced it sounds at points. while stripped back, bass-focused songs are usually a good focus point and can be the best songs on albums, this one doesn‚Äôt have enough interesting things ‚Äúup top‚Äù (up top? that‚Äôs a producer description, I mean with like vocals and synths and other elements of the song) going on to make it not be a mindless, background song
 
**xxrandooxx** (4): i like the beet
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (3): This song is supposed to be hot, but it sounds mostly hollow, sedated and cold.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (0): if anyone describes any song on After Hours as boring and then give this a score above a 6 i will be harshly judging you

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I still don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard the original but this song is decent. It‚Äôs a very generic song but it does bop enough and doesn‚Äôt annoy me. The Weeknd and Maluma work good off each other and this is a fine remix imo.
 
**hikkaru** (7): This is pretty nice, definitely the better Spanish song in the bonus rate in my opinion and clearly y'all agree with that as it outplaces Un Dia by a few spots.
 
**akanewasright** (6): This was pleasant enough.

**astrologicalangel** (10): I could listen to Abel sing in Spanish forever
 
**Brendon-Urine** (10): I kinda love the weeknd's awkward spanish attempt, it sounds nice
 
**frogaranaman** (10): this is the closest we‚Äôll get to rating Maluma or any reggaeton for a while so I am giving this a 10 to say reggaeton ultimate rate when? hell I‚Äôll come up with a grab bag list of big 2018-2020 reggaeton singles to submit. also The Weeknd‚Äôs Spanish sounds really good here
 
**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): EL FINDE Y PAPI JUANCHO PA PRENDER LA QUINCEA√ëERA (maluma rate when)
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): I want Maluma to engage in sexual activities with me.

**ColsonBakerr** (9): how have i not heard this before???!!!!
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): the better spanish song in this bonus rate
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9): Yo creo que Maluma se hubiera ahorrado unos d√≥lares si cantaba con Prince Royce instead, al final la canci√≥n hubiera sonado exactamente igual.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (9): yummy (not the Justin kind!)
 
**waluigiest** (9): wtf is his voice good for everything??
 
**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I really shouldn't be surprised at how well Abel's voice translates to Latin stuff, but I am impressed!
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Oh Abel speaking in Spanish is so sexy even though he is not fluent. And ofc he has to duet with freaking Maluma. Ugh they are both daddies. Okay, stop being hor knee Doc.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): The Weeknd sounds so angelic here omg, he always outdoes people on their own songs when he remixes lol (and he can even do it in Spanish!)
 
**musical\_pyn** (8): I am looking (at maluma) respectfully
 
**skargardin** (8): bop

**booksandplantsand** (7): ooh I like him singing in spanish!
 
**DaHumanTorch** (7): cute reggaeton moment but nothing amazing
 
**fallenriot** (7): i‚Äôve never heard the original tbh so this is fine, their voices go pretty well together
 
**nahaalne** (7): Abel looks hot with those glasses.
 
**SmileAndTears** (7): I like the vibe but that‚Äôs pretty much it lol

**bbfan132** (6.5): it‚Äôs decent
 
**cocosairdep** (6): Never liked this song that much tbh. Abel doesn‚Äôt add a lot to it either. Extra points for the pronunciation tho, it was on point.

**akanewasright** (8): I think this song is a touch overrated by some Gaga fans, but it is still a fucking bop
 
**hikkaru** (6): This is my least fave of the ASIB pop songs, and I guess that makes sense since if I recall correctly it is the least featured song of the bunch in the film. I guess y'all disagree a bit though seeing as it ends up placing above Heal Me by just a tad.

**1998tweety** (10): bop
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): I always blast this song, Ally Maine‚Äôs best
 
**bespectacIed** (10): In the ASIB cinematic universe, this was the follow up single to the lead single WDYDT and went number 1 for 10 weeks and proved to Ally's haters that she wasn't a one-hit fad
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is bringing me back to The Fame Gaga era and I high-key love this shit.
 
**J\_Toe** (10): queen of being a triple threat

**jasannn** (8.5): This is better than half of Chromatica
 
**jexan13** (8): actually good
 
**ktajlili** (8): certified BOP
 
**runaway3212** (8): I love triple thread being used like this
 
**twistedpython** (8): A bop but overrated, and Gaga has better songs about hair in her discography, so there's no reason to listen to this
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): k this is gaga style but also asib ? a little too muscial but i do like it
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): Gonna use this comment to tell anyone who hasn't watched A Star is Born (2018) to watch it!!! It's legit so good, critically & fan acclaimed, Bradley Cooper basically was the Taylor Swift of film that year (produced, directed, wrote, and starred in the movie).

**akanewasright** (7.7): This has never been my favorite song on the album, but I‚Äôve really softened on it lately. It‚Äôs not really my favorite melody on the album, but the second verse has started to move me more and more each time I hear it. I know this is some people‚Äôs favorite, and I‚Äôm glad that the song made it as far as it did for their sake. I think it deserves its placement of ‚Äúexactly situated in the top half‚Äù
 
**hikkaru** (7.5): This is the only track I don't LOVE from the first half of folklore, and it's still pretty decent. I think there's just not as much intrigue to it sonically or lyrically as the other songs around it, but it's still pretty good! I honestly thought it might do a bit worse in this rate but at the same time, it's placing right where I'd expect it among the other folklore tracks.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): Like The 1, this is another cute song that just missing something as a wow factor. Lyrically this song a miss for me and just comes off a bit more hipstery
 
---

# Numbers higher than seven
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (11): And here it is, my 11. This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I've heard in a while. The shifting of perspectives, the second verse, the whole thing about having love for someone from your childhood you barely remember, the way she pronounces words/lines so they can serve double meanings ("please, picture me, in the weeds, -- before I learned civility -- I used to scream, ferociously". The " before I learned civility" completes the last line AND starts the next. Brilliant!) My favorite song of the year tbh.
 
**Stryxen** (11): day off in kyoto got bored at the temple walked around at the seven eleven
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): not a sad listen for me actually! love how hazy and sweet
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is perfect i wish it got half the hype that b***y gets i love its take on childhood and the love you have for your friends at that age
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The way Taylor set up the scene in this song is just so beautiful. Only Taylor can make me sad that I can't see my imaginary friend anymore. Also, Taylor definitely watched Bridge to Terabithia before writing this song.
 
**jimmy345960** (10): when the us presidential election was happening and Pennsylvania didn't have its shit together for the first three days (she came around lol) i had the lyric "pennslyvania under me" stuck in my head for way too long. Songs super good, love the interesting perspective.
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (10): This hits different when you can relate to it
 
**rosecult** (10): so cute!
 
**runaway3212** (10): this is the title track of folklore and it's literally so amazing, we'll move to india forever is such a creative line I just love it
 
**waluigiest** (10): there is no heterosexual explanation for this song. It is simply two girls falling in love as youths and growing up and apart. The second verse (‚ÄúI think your house is haunted‚Äù) is songwriting perfection
 
**mayolizard** (9.7): pleaaaaseeeeeeeee
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this is beautiful
 
**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Don‚Äôt know if this is a popular opinion but this is her best vocal performance on the album and I wish the song had more of her vocals in it rather than ending on a longer instrumental section
 
**ChandelierFlickering** (9.2): lovely
 
**bbfan132** (9): so pretty ugh, love her voice here
 
**lillipup03** (9): It took some serious self control not to give this song a 7, but I just love it too much.
 
**moooo566** (9): this is such a pretty song, every time it starts i think of think "eh" and then by the end i'm just bobbing along gently and it flies by
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): this is so pure
 
**wavingwolves** (8.8): the second verse of this song is some of the best lyrics taylor has ever written
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.7): Her vocals here are beautiful, especially the chorus.
 
**CarlieScion** (8.5): how many ppl gave this a 7 for the lols
 
**jsonphile** (8.5): really resisting giving this a seven for the obvious joke
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): "though I can't recall your face, I still got love for you."
 
**rickikardashian** (8.5): ‚Äúi peaked it at seven‚Äù -my chromatica scores
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): cardigan but better
 
**SmileAndTears** (8.5): cute
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Ok honestly I don;t get a lot of the lyrics to this but it is very pretty
 
**vagenda** (8.4): Get in loser, we‚Äôre moving to India forever
 
**hielord** (8.2): the beginning of the song just hits different
 
**1998tweety** (8): cute lil bop
 
**astrologicalangel** (8): I was really tempted to rate this a 7
 
**bluepupz** (8): The second verse where she talks about her friend's dad :O The way she sings the choruses conveys this sense of childlike innocence - it's kind of bittersweet.
 
**fishingfor8** (8): I haven't left any comments the last two songs cause i forgot I was doing a rate. Can't wait till next fall so I can listen to the album in its correct season
 
**ManofOranges** (8): Seventh track being called "Seven"??? Genius!!!1!
 
**pig-serpent** (8): Taylor Lied.
 
**ReallyCreative** (8): nine
 
**skargardin** (8): so darn cute
 
**vayyiqra** (8): Best hook on the album maybe.

# Literally the number seven
 
**followingfreeways** (7.7): lol see what i did there? 7.7 for seven? ha. anyways, this song really depends on my mood. i'm not crazy about the chorus but i love the verses and the lyrics, and it makes me feel really sad and nostalgic for being a child.
 
**ColsonBakerr** (7.5): i wanna love this song cause it IS good but again, it's a bit slow and listening to it just after mirrorrball was underwhelming. "before I lerned civility, I used to scream, ferociously" might actually be my favourite lyric on the album tho
 
**intheaftermath** (7.5): this composition of this song is stunning, but I've never cared much for Taylor's vocals on it.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): seems fitting
 
**celladonn** (7): Love when a track's title is also the perfect score
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7): her mind
 
**fallenriot** (7): hehe see what i did there
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (7): she was dead on when she called this song seven
 
**Jackalope117** (7): I mean, I had to
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7): I swear I‚Äôm not trying to be clever with the song title, its just around the quality level I‚Äôd give a 7
 
**joeeswift** (7): lets all admire the irony of me giving seven a 7
 
**KennyEarthman** (7): I'm getting Bridge to Terabithia vibes
 
**letsallpoo** (7): https://twitter.com/hunteryharris/status/1309998743794724866
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7): I just want to take this opportunity that right now is when I realized seven is also track 7 on this record. I also didn't mean to give it a 7, but sometimes life just works out like that, ya know?
 
**Misentro** (7): Literally though
 
**RandomHypnotica** (7): This song reminded me of Bridge to Terebithia, fuck you Taylor
 
**Roxieloxie** (7): this is a song that would be an option in a uquiz question titled 'which of these songs make you want to go feral'
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): Imagine if this song didn't have to be seventh in the tracklist and we could have the dream pop triptych of mirrorball-august-this is me trying. PS: Big queer girl energy on this one.
 
**team\_kockroach** (7): thank u Taylor for giving me a score in advance
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): i'm so funny!
 
**thedoctordances1940** (7): yep
 
**TragicKingdom1** (7): the jokes write themselves
 
**twistedpython** (7): It's literally in the title. A great song, for sure, but one that I don't connect with as much as I do some of the others
 
**Vromega** (7): Seven was meant to be a 7, her mind

**hikkaru** (10): This is a bit of an underrated track in my opinion - I love the vibe it gives off of a flushed face and racing heart as you experience a childlike crush on someone, and GOD I wish that were me. The summery riff that plays through the track and slick hook are instant serotonin boosts for me, and I definitely had this on loop last summer as part of my bright and sunny vibes playlist. Tove Lo cowrite supremacy!
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favorites on first listen of the album, I love the MJ-esque background vocals and the overall beat of the song. It‚Äôs just super fun and catchy and I think it is one of the more underrated tracks here.
 
**akanewasright** (7): I don‚Äôt think Dua was the best singer for this melody. It feels like it‚Äôs just a little bit out of her range, and that causes for this slightly irritating squeak to start entering her voice. This happens in other songs and it can help make her sound distinctive‚Ä¶ when it‚Äôs not literally the entire song. Anyway, the beat is literal gold.
 
---

# Ready for the summer
 
**CritneySpearz** (11): her best song drop the mv hunny lets keep this era going for the next 5 years
 
**1998tweety** (10): one of the most slept on songs from the album. i get so many summer vibes from this song; I just wanna get in my bfs jeep and ride down to the pier while picking up some friends along the way and then we'll skip down the boardwalk while eating gelato and Im wearing these blue shorts and a tank top (i would never actually wear a tank top but it works in this fantasy) and im also wearing one of those jackets that you have pulled down so its all bunched up on your arms and off your shoulders, and then its nighttime and we do that thing i see in anime all the time where all the characters light those firework sparkly thingies on the beach and then we head home and its iconic.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): her voice in the bridge >>>
 
**bbfan132** (10): this is so euphoric UGH, love it
 
**bespectacIed** (10): The second best song of all time named "Cool"
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): ok why was this not pushed more this is a fucking jam
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): The vaccine availability in my country: i guess we're ready for the summer
 
**lillipup03** (10): I miss summer... that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the comment.
 
**rosecult** (10): this 10 is for Tove Lo <333
 
**Roxieloxie** (10): So i listened to this album when it came out last march and I remember it not really giving what everyone was saying that it did beside a few songs that I kept in rotation so I dont think I ever came back to listen to this song and holy fuck what a mistake that was. A couple of yall said this is a Carly Rae Jepson Bside which first of all, fuck you, i cant unhear this now with carlys voice in my head, and two i cant see this as not being WYIMR lite. That being said  even if it is proto WYIMR, that song is an 11 so therefor this is a 10
 
**ryjomom** (10): Deserved to be song of the summer! Cruel Summer teas
 
**shesdoingyoga** (10): If I had a nickel for every time Tove Lo had a writing credit on the third song of an album with eleven songs on the standard edition that was widely regarded by popheads as one of the best albums of its release year, I‚Äôd have two nickels. Which isn‚Äôt a lot, but it‚Äôs weird that it happened twice, right?
 
**shhhneak** (10): this is the best song on Future Nostalgia and if you recognize that you are seeing heaven.
 
**Tedyonce** (10): CRJ vibes
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): put some RESPECT on this song's name it has gone ignored FAR TOO LONG
 
**TiltControls** (10): gwen has the superior one, but it's still a solid 10
 
**runaway3212** (9.5): I am ready for the summer
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.2): don't do this song dirty
 
**vagenda** (9.2): You know Tove Lo co-wrote on this because it feels like the song is making out with you somehow
 
**aliensexist** (9): ughhh
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9): I really really love this song I really really do
 
**followingfreeways** (9): i sleep on this WAY too much this song is out of this world i'm obsessed with her voice in the chorus!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): verses are meh but ugh the pre chorus and chorus are great
 
**musical\_pyn** (9): this one‚Äôs really grown on me and is now one of my favorites, I really wish this has been the summer single instead of Break My Heart
 
**mythicalbeaste** (9): I like this a lot! Haven't really heard it before this
 
**nooodisaster** (9): Cool.
 
**skargardin** (9): I think this would've been a great single for the summer
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): I think this song made me really realize that Dua has a lot of weird little vocal features that make her sound unique.
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Realllyy great summer song!
 
**wryn\_** (9): this song deserves far more respect than it gets
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): Single material. Make it happen Dula Peep.
 
**jasannn** (8.5): She nailed the retro summer vibes here.
 
**rickikardashian** (8.5): that EMOTION looks familiar
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): not a fan of the squeaky voice thing in the chorus but otherwise this is a solid summer bop
 
**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): good god the bass
 
**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): If you told me this was a cut Emotion track I'd believe you
 
**seanderlust** (8.3): tove lo did backing vocals?!
 
**SmileAndTears** (8.3): The summer smash that never was
 
**Awkward\_King** (8): IDC IM JUST EXCITED THAT COOL BY GWEN WILL BE THE INTERMISSION FOR THIS
 
**fishingfor8** (8): if the chorus was more in line with the verses this would easily be my favorite FN song. Unfortunately whatever that melody is in the background of the verses dissappears during the chorus
 
**ktajlili** (8): I think I'm ready for the summer
 
**pig-serpent** (8): Those SYNTHS! They sound like pastoral blue skies in a field on a sunny day. This song doesn't have the oomph factor for me to love it but if I fall in love with it in a year or two it wouldn't surprise me.
 
**waluigiest** (8): at first I thought it was boring, but this song has come around and it‚Äôs an understated, lovely little bop.
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): not the song i would‚Äôve pegged as the Tove Lo cowrite from this album, but still fun
 
**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it feels like she could have done more here but not bad
 
**twistedpython** (7.5): Meh the song is fine but whenever I see the title I think of the godawful Jonas Brothers song and that clouds my opinion
 
**wasian-invasion** (7.5): Nice and chill but nothing really pops
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (7): It's cool. Filler, but FN's filler is another artist's career-defining hit so... fair enough ig
 
**CHRMbishop** (7): summer without a mask vibes
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7): the fun thing about having these be so delayed is I can make grammy jokes, so people will understand when I say that Dua Lipa should give herself more credit for keeping all her cool.
 
**fallenriot** (7): one of the more generic songs on the album, but i love the little cracks in her voice on this one
 
**hielord** (7): Cool is a nice song, but is not as good as the rest of the album imo
 
**pat-rickstar** (7): Solid pop song. Kind of forgettable compared to the rest of the album though
 
**thePotatofairyy** (7): The production is great but I'm personally not a fan of her vocal delivery.

akanewasright: # I'm too hot for this shit
 
**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6.6): my least favorite of this whole album, it's just fine
 
**alwayswords** (6.5): hollister music
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): i wouldn't skip it but won't go out of my way to listen to it either
 
**booksandplantsand** (6): fine, just a little boring imo
 
**J\_Toe** (6): I liked it at first, but I think it's only above average now. Cool summer vibes though.
 
**KennyEarthman** (6): it's... cool
 
**ManofOranges** (6): This one is fine, not a stunner though in my opinion.
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (6): never quite got this one
 
**wailord\_fan** (6): I am re-listening, and wow the album cuts are NOT great. Granted I don't think emotion is the S tier pop album popheads hypes it up to be, there are really great bright moments but this sounds like an Emotion Side C cut.
 
**bluepupz** (5.5): I know this is pretty loved but it's not my favorite. Maybe it's too chill for me? I don't hate the song but I'm just not very pulled in by it.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5.5): this is a meh stream juice by lizzo
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): it loses me in the chorus. I didn't like it when the album came out and I still don't
 
**xxrandooxx** (5.5): cool
 
**frogaranaman** (5): this song sounds absurdly empty and almost too muted for its sound
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5): I will go to my grave saying that this song would be 10 times better if it was CRJ or Tove Lo on vocals. To. My. Grave.
 
**sirpancakeXI** (5): the hook is just terrible, it completely ruins this song for me which is a shame coz the remaining part of the song is good
 
**Stryxen** (5): stream juice
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): This song sounds very close to her debut sound. It's nice while it's on, but i forget I ever heard it the moment it stops playing.
 
**wavingwolves** (5): this could be a song from lover. yes, it could!
 
**cremeebrulee** (4): sorry i love you tove lo but this song is not it. something about the instrumental is just irritating to my ears. i almost always skip it.
 
**Flegasaurus** (4): it's fun but also i don't really like it? it feels like nothing
 
**mms82** (4): love the Jayda G Remix and that‚Äôd be a 9 but this might be my least favorite song on the album without the remix
 
**2dina3dworld** (3.5): this sounds like what would play on the Edge during the morning drive slot
 
**Iris3271** (3.5): Too squeaky, the high pitched breaths throughout the chorus were annoying
 
**bulforster** (3): When I saw the Tove Lo credit I understood why this wasn't doing much for me since she's a sub fave I have almost no time for.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (2): Never liked this, the Jayda G remix slaps though.
 
**MrSwearword** (1): this just doesn't hit like it should [Tove Lo co-write not helping matters] and with the Jayda G remix outclassing this...yeah no.

**hikkaru** (8.5): I absolutely looooove the bridge of this song, it's such a great emotional climax as is the usual for Taylor. Also need to mention "I got wasted like all my potential", which has been beat into the ground a bit by swifties that love it but I guess I am swifties that love it because imo it's such a clever and relatable line because I too have wasted all my potential and often get wasted, it's almost as relatable a song as Alice!!
 
**akanewasright** (8): I feel like I have to highlight ‚ÄúI got wasted like all my potential‚Äù, even though most other people didi in their comments. Genuinely one of my favorite lines in the rate. I don‚Äôt think that the whole song is Taylor‚Äôs best work, but it has so many little moments like that that jump out at you.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): Although fan favorite, I have never really got this song. Sure it has that one really good line but the song is just way too one note for me. Maybe I‚Äôm just not emo enough for this, but I just don‚Äôt connect with is as much as I feel like the song is telling me I should.
 
---

# You're doing great sweetie
 
**mylps9** (11): the second verse is too fucking relatable holy shit
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): is this a waste of an 11? maybe, but th1s 1s me trying
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): DEPRESSION
 
**CrimsonROSET** (10): This song is gorgeous, honestly. So emotional, so transparent.
 
**deadline4mymemories** (10): painfully relatable
 
**followingfreeways** (10): it's hard to explain my love for this song. it feels like she wrote this specifically for me, and i know a lot of people feel this way about this song. it's almost unnervingly relatable. i appreciate how subdued and low energy the instrumentals and the melody is, it sounds like such an accurate representation of when you realize how alone you are and how hard you're trying but it's still not enough
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Apparently some people think this song is forgettable? Like, boy are you deaf?
 
**jimmy345960** (10): This almost got an eleven if track eight didnt exist. alas, it does. anyway, the lyrics are so poignant but so sharp. The whole second verse is too fucking real and brings up my imposter syndrome and my anxiety so bravo, jesus this is good.
 
**KennyEarthman** (10): ok miss Taylor didn't have to come for me like this
 
**mayolizard** (10): so fcking underrated
 
**MrSwearword** (10): "I got wasted like all my potential" is an oddly poignant realization from Taylor so full marks are in order.
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (10): This is ME! Trying
 
**RandomHypnotica** (10): Taylor really came up with some of her best lyrics here, that second verse is incredible
 
**rickikardashian** (10): literally any song with the line ‚Äúso i got wasted like all my potential‚Äù is a 10 for me
 
**shesdoingyoga** (10): This one hurts to listen to, take my 10 and leave me alone
 
**twistedpython** (10): If I could give another 11 it would be this song. This song is beyond beautiful
 
**Vromega** (10): my first instant fav of Folklore after the first listens. It didn't grow that well on me but I'm still giving it a 10 for the nostalgic vibes and because I'm feeling generous
 
**camerinian** (9.5): fuck, me too
 
**nooodisaster** (9.5): This literally sounds like a cover of a Bleachers song, ESPECIALLY the bridge; Taylor's tone and cadence is exactly Jack. And I'm kinda sad it isn't, because this would be one of his best. The lyrics are incredible, the production is stunning, it's endlessly replayable. The surprise hit of the album.
 
**ryjomom** (9.5): This song has a permanent stay in my chill study playlist. The lyrics are so unique and iconique.
 
**slimboyfriend** (9.1): I was obsessed with a different lyric from this song each week following folklore dropping
 
**bbfan132** (9): the reverb on taylor‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ yes
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9): bruh I.... this song is like sad sad. And I'm a sucker for sad songs. It also has this really surreal feel to it which I can't explain but it's fucking awesome
 
**fallenriot** (9): this is, in fact, me when i‚Äôm trying
 
**jackisboredtoday** (9): one of my favorite songs of Taylor‚Äôs entire career lyrically, there are so many different moments here that I love
 
**purplechilipepper** (9): I'm gonna be real this hit close to home a bit
 
**Stryxen** (9): who went up to her and told her "all your cages are mental" but anyway she was right it is hard to be at a party.
 
**wavingwolves** (9): this is one of the most the national songs in this record and i absolutely love it for that
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.9): Beautiful song, great production.
 
**intheaftermath** (8.5): I regret not loving this one at first. It took some time to get it to stick.
 
**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Mood for the past year tbh
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): the second verse of this song is full of lines that are quotable just on their own
 
**whyishestaring** (8.3): I like the verses of this song, I just wish the chorus had more lyrics to it.
 
**CarlieScion** (8): i like this much more now that i understand the motivations behind this song, but it still has such fuzzy production
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (8): Only problem with this song is that it gives a caption to Gen Zers humblebragging about their ‚ÄòGiFtEd KiD bUrNoUt‚Äô
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8): I love self reflective taylor
 
**waluigiest** (8): a really fantastic reflection on where she is and how painful the journey was.
 
**wasian-invasion** (8): some really good lyrics, but it kinda feels like a slog to listen to
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.7): this is me trying not to sabotage folklore's scores during women's history month I guess‚Ä¶
 
**jsonphile** (7.5): me when I explain to my boss why I‚Äôve been stuck on the same few lines of code for hours
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): cute
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (7.5): the lyriiccccs
 
**1998tweety** (7): the bridge for this is amazing but the chorus is meh
 
**bespectacIed** (7): cute, ambient-ish.
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (7): this was originally one of the standout tracks. i still like it, but not as much as i did.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (7): very emotional
 
**runaway3212** (7): Lyricicallly very impressive but I don't love the sound
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): self harm is listening to this song while having a breakdown
 
**vayyiqra** (7): :sad:

**hikkaru** (10): I feel like this track always ends up being a bit overlooked, and so I guess it's fitting that it is placing right around the middle of the overall rate. Personally though, I absolutely adore it and the masterclass in sass that Dua serves in the talk-sing vocals as well as all the small production details that elevate it to the highest of heights. Jeff really did do the damn thing and it shows! I wish it could have maybe made day 3 but at least it didn't flop too bad.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): I know a lot of people don‚Äôt love this song however I think his style works perfectly for Dua, and it‚Äôs definitely one of my favorites from the album. I love it when she does talky and playful singing (love it when I can hear her accent), I feel like it more genuine and herself than songs where she is singing full out. This song is so fun and catchy and I just love some of the lines and attitude she gives here.
 
**akanewasright** (7.5): Sonically, this is an easy 10. Unfortunately, Dua‚Äôs lyrics‚Ä¶ are a choice. They‚Äôre kind of easy to ignore at first, because how much character she can put into her voice (her choice to show off her British accent on this record was a really good one), but some of these lines are just‚Ä¶ pure cringe.

# Female alphas
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): I love this song it's so wonderfully weird. Best song on the album.
 
**Brendon-Urine** (10): the instrumentation on this song is just next level... the breakdown? like come on, this is one the best intro tracks to a pop album period. the lyrics are perfect too.
 
**intheaftermath** (10): My house temporarily lost power while I was playing this to rate it. I can only assume my house couldn't compete with how iconic this opening track is.
 
**moooo566** (10): As far as opening statements for an album go, you can't do much better than this.
 
**MrSwearword** (10): a fantastic opener and should've been more than a promo or buzz single
 
**plastichaxan** (10): underrated
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): Fantastic opening track, and probably the most interesting sound on the album
 
**ryjomom** (10): Really brings the future and nostalgia to the future nostalgia party. Also FEMALE ALPACA
 
**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is one of the most unique tracks Dua‚Äôs ever done, and lays out the mission statement for her bold new sound. Its quirky attitude and references to art and culture reminds me of something Artpop-era Lady Gaga or Moloko-era R√≥is√≠n Murphy would have created.
 
**skargardin** (10): this is how you open an album
 
**static\_int\_husp** (10): that opening F U T U R E... chills
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): best opener in the rate. this song deserves the praise Physical gets
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (10): so underrated! such a great opener
 
**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH0eJY95rMY
 
**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this gets 0.5 knocked off because ever since someone suggested it be squidward saying "ffuuuTTUREEE" to start the song (and album) off it has been imperfect to me
 
**jasannn** (9.5): One of the best choruses in the album. It's just so funky. So underrated from this album.
 
**mayolizard** (9.5): a grower
 
**pheromenos** (9.5): i'm a stingy bitch i know
 
**bbfan132** (9): love the wit in this song, immediately enjoyed it when i heard it - doesn‚Äôt go all the way for me now but it‚Äôs still great
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): fantastic opener, i wasn‚Äôt super keen on it when it first came out but it grew on me immensely. this is the energy i wanna embody in my daily life
 
**Misentro** (9): The piano in the bridge is so hot!
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9): great thesis statement for the sound of the album. Love how her accent comes thru too
 
**pig-serpent** (9): Dua, haven't you heard? Sigmas are the new Alphas
 
**rosecult** (9): ended men's rights
 
**Stryxen** (9): massively underrated bop and great intro track
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): VERY DISCO, an excellent start to this album, I feel.
 
**vayyiqra** (9): wow I love La Roux [Serious comment: This is a real bop and great intro to the album and its whole vibe.]
 
**wasian-invasion** (9): Love the production on this. dua confirmed architecture stan
 
**rickikardashian** (8.8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfzT7_XNvEw
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): shes a cute opener but works better in the contest of the album
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): What an opener. I knew Dua had personality and this song proved that she has charisma!
 
**just\_thonking** (8.5): Great start to the album
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): so i finally bought headphones worth more than $12 and WOW IM HEARING SO MUCH MORE WTF IS ALL THIS
 
**runaway3212** (8.5): BANGER
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I enjoy this, but the weird dissonant clown honk sound and other little production details keep it from being one of the better songs on the album
 
**seanderlust** (8.4): bops HARD. also love the lautner reference
 
**AHSWeeknd** (8): I want the recipe! I WANT THE RECIPE!!
 
**Alumineous** (8): The production is really good. Great opening track.
 
**bespectacIed** (8): she knows she is the new main pop girl. Not sure about the lines about being an "innovator" tho, while making an 80s inspired album.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (8): Maybe I should be used to a female alpha at this point.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Deserved proper single treatment, honestly.
 
**fallenriot** (8): one of the few dua songs where her personality really shines through
 
**hielord** (8): imma boss ass bitch bitch bitch
 
**J\_Toe** (8): I think the feminist themes work better on this track. I like how off-kilter the electro-funk beat is, and the lyric video worked better than many artist's actual music videos. For me, this is when her two-coloured hair finally made sense.
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (8): It‚Äôs cute
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): we love sassy Dua
 
**thePotatofairyy** (8): Grew on me a lot. The production is retro tacky and fun with great replayability
 
**waluigiest** (8): I like it as an opener but honestly the references and some of the flow are um awkward
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (8): At first I saw this as just an intro for the album, but I've grown to really like this song and I think it's very cheeky!
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I love the quirky laugh and the odd architecture simile
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (7.1): This is a grower, but I can‚Äôt get over some of the cringy lyrics and that robot voice in the background
 
**booksandplantsand** (7): cute promo song, really shows us what this album is gonna be
 
**Flegasaurus** (7): ok cute but!!! wouldn't "future nostalgia" be an oxymoron considering the definition of nostalgia is, according to the merriam-webster dictionary, "a wistful or excessively sentimental yearning for return to or of some past period or irrecoverable condition?" which would mean that one can not be nostalgic for the future as the future is not a past period, nor an irrecoverable condition as the future has not occurred yet
 
**frogaranaman** (7): there‚Äôs so many things to make fun of on this song: the random architecture reference at the beginning, the ‚Äúfemale alpha‚Äù line (Dua incel confirmed?), the ‚Äúchanging the game‚Äù line but releasing a standard (yet catchy!) pop track. these comments better have a field day
 
**jimmy345960** (7): Good song, good opener
 
**ManofOranges** (7): It's a good enough album opener. It's accomplishes in setting the mood of the album and basically telling us the mission statement of the album, I'll admit that.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (7): very sample-y
 
**TiltControls** (7): Worst song of the 'good' part of the album (which is still a great feat on its own)
 
**wryn\_** (7): this song made me had to look up who john lautner was, i don't appreciate when pop songs make me feel dumb. but it still slaps
 
**fedefreakss** (6.6): she's fun i don't know why many people hate on her

akanewasright: # Yaaas girlboss gatekeep gaslight
 
**2dina3dworld** (6.5): its a nice starter, but doesn't work on its own.
 
**bluepupz** (6.5): I'm not a huge fan of the talk-rapping (talk-singing? just plain talking?) that she does in the verses, but the chorus/actual singing has me sold.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this is very campy and risky but i can't imagine listening to it more than once at a time
 
**SmileAndTears** (6.3): It‚Äôs good but not really my style
 
**Roxieloxie** (6.2): I remember my first opinion on this song and I dont think I can sy it on popheads without someone say I am participating in reverse racism so I will just give it a 6.2 and hope someone knows exactly what im referring to
 
**ColsonBakerr** (6): I'm sorry but this song just doesn't do it for me like the chorus was good but just no...
 
**fishingfor8** (6): it doesn't fit anything else on the album
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (6): eh
 
**musical\_pyn** (6): an okay opener, some of the lyrics are a little clunky though
 
**noctilucentvibes** (6): the lyrics are so bad but the beat is so good
 
**sirpancakeXI** (6): i mean it is not a bad opener for an album but i dont like the man voice saying future nostalgia
 
**twistedpython** (6): The song would be a million times better without the annoying robot voice but it's also iconic and the song would be empty without it.
 
**wailord\_fan** (6): It was a 6 when it was released, grew to an 8, and dropped again to 6.
 
**xxrandooxx** (5.7): good gay bar pre game song but not a song for the clubs
 
**KennyEarthman** (5.5): the talk-rapping isn't doing anything for me
 
**Iris3271** (5): I don't know if she's trying to rap or what but whatever it is I could live without it
 
**purplechilipepper** (5): I'm sorry the female alpha line makes me cringe but the song does bop
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): navel-gazing in retro and annoying to boot. "I know you ain't used to female alpha" is such a cringy lyric.
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): good intro track for the album, doesn't hold up on it's own
 
**aliensexist** (4): Talk rap needs to end
 
**wavingwolves** (4): i love the female alpha thing more than the song itself
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): kind of iconic of her to name her album after such a bad song
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): the buildup to the chorus is easily the best part, but it feels a little unfinished? maybe the production needs a little more depth, or I find the lyrics weak.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (2): I have never liked this song.

**akanewasright** (10): This getting cut in day 2 kind of hurts, but I understand why it happened. The song is small, compared to everything around it. It‚Äôs just a perfectly intimate, plaintive moment on the record, which is not something I‚Äôd expect from a Max Martin produced track. But yeah, I love this. I love the drum and bass influences, I love the emotional openness, and I wish that it held on until day 3.
 
**hikkaru** (10): The dnb elements are are to DIE for, and I love that they come from Max Martin of all people! I would love for more pop tracks to incorporate production like this. My favourite part of this song is definitely the bridge/post-chorus whatever it is near the end of the song, the "I can't, can't believe you..." part - idk, something about it just really tickles that emotional feeling for me not even just through lyrics but through melody and delivery as well, and I absolutely adore when songs are able to do that for me. Definitely one of my fave non-singles from the album and it's nice that it did at least decently in this rate.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love how warped, frantic and interesting the production is here, it‚Äôs nothing like anything else he has done. This in combination with the desperate and self aware lyrics, I think this is one of his most unique songs for sure. I also really appreciate the initial reference of ‚ÄúThis house I bought is not a home‚Äù, which is called back to in After Hours (and initially called into on his mixtapes).
 
---
 
**2dina3dworld** (10): I liked it
 
**aliensexist** (10): The feels man
 
**bespectacIed** (10): One of the best on the album. The production reminds me a lil bit of "such great heights", i love it
 
**Brendon-Urine** (10): my favorite after hours song <3 just listening to the drums is an experience, they way they suddenly cut out and come back in is therapeutic
 
**fishingfor8** (10): I absolutely LOVE the stutter beat on this it is fantastic. An 11 contender for sure
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): the way i would scream this in my car while being in a committed, happy relationship. duality of man.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): This was my initial favorite the first time I listened, it‚Äôs so glittery and pretty. The 80‚Äôs influences wear on his sleeve here
 
**jackisboredtoday** (10): this hook brims with that Max Martin precision and I love it so very much‚Ä¶ probably my most listened song in the album release week
 
**musical\_pyn** (10): the instrumental to this track is incredible, and this may be the song the weeknd sounds the best on
 
**RandomHypnotica** (10): Wow, I LOVE the garage vibes of this track! Why was this not a single?
 
**runaway3212** (10): I think this might be my favourite track on this entire album, it's just so great
 
**SideBTrack8** (10): Choosing between this and Blinding Lights for my 11 was painful, but I really think The Weeknd deserves the win and it's not happening with this track unfortunately. This has always sounded like a Hannah Diamond song to me.
 
**sirpancakeXI** (10): the chorus is so good wtf
 
**Tedyonce** (10): this sounds 80s but not 80s at the same time, it confuses me brain
 
**TiltControls** (10): I love the restraint on the track
 
**twistedpython** (10): I adore this melody and the production and the lyrics and everything about this song
 
**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this feels like garage is this garage?

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9.5): EVEN BETTER INSTRUMENTALS, I APPRECIATE
 
**thePotatofairyy** (9.5): The production makes me feel nostalgic. Simply just a joyous listen
 
**SmileAndTears** (9.3): I really like this one, it‚Äôs very dreamy. The synths used in this kinda remind me of the ones Jack Antonoff used on CRJ‚Äôs Comeback
 
**1998tweety** (9): hold awn this is excellent
 
**bbfan132** (9): king of drum and bass
 
**camerinian** (9): Drum and bass has so much potential to be used in pop. This is exactly what I am so excited to hear going forward
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9): I know a lot of people are like eehh but I LOVE this song I just really really do
 
**CrimsonROSET** (9): insert here comment about how this song isn‚Äôt hard to love, queue laugh track, freeze frame.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): What I love about this is that it highlighted Abel's vulnerability as he acknowledges that he is pretty difficult to love.
 
**Iris3271** (9): My initial favorite from the album
 
**ManofOranges** (9): Ok now hold on a minute this kind of bops.
 
**nooodisaster** (9): The first song in the album that for me felt like a pop smash. Great lyrics, great production, timeless all around.
 
**ReallyCreative** (9): this one grew on me with multiple listens
 
**skargardin** (9): banger
 
**xxrandooxx** (8.9): honey i was shocked i was in tears
 
**Flegasaurus** (8.5): BANGER ok i love the drum and bass vibes of this one
 
**followingfreeways** (8.5): "the house i bought is not a home" :(
 
**mayolizard** (8.5): yass grenade
 
**pheromenos** (8.5): this song reminds me of 'flowers of algernon' lol, i think i listened to the whole album while reading it but for some reason this song is the only one that stuck
 
**rickikardashian** (8.5): i feel like going on a jog to this would motivate me a lot
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): The first song that actually grabs my attention listening to this in order
 
**Bajuko** (8): I liked the drum and bass vibes from this, I wish he had more songs like this one
 
**bluepupz** (8): The bridge is my favorite, but I just generally think he sounds great here.
 
**frogaranaman** (8): I would love love LOVE for more dnb-inspired songs in mainstream albums, goddamn this is a good execution of it
 
**jayjaysortagay** (8): I'm starting to worry the album will be a bit samey but I'm still liking it a lot so far
 
**KennyEarthman** (8): I love the slight drum & bass vibe
 
**pig-serpent** (8): Putting an amen break in a song is the easiest way to get me to like it. Also it has a great hook and it shows a lot of restraint compared to many of the other songs on the album.
 
**sarcasticsobs** (8): forgot there was a drum n‚Äô bass beat on this record, what a choice
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): maybe i'm not as hard to love as i think
 
**ryjomom** (7.9): Genuinely surprised. This is actually pretty cool

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): THERE you are abel, I missed you in the first two
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This is honestly one of the only songs I'll say this for in this rate, but it could genuinely be better if it was faster
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (7.5): this has such a pretty melody but the beat was...a choice
 
**wavingwolves** (7.5): makes me feel like a fuckboy but i love it
 
**outsideeyess** (7.4): I really love the chorus melody but I don't like that drum pattern
 
**Alumineous** (7): Abel's entire discography, summarized.
 
**just\_thonking** (7): Definitely grew on me as it progressed
 
**mythicalbeaste** (7): love the outro
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): a nice hook but kinda bland otherwise
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): His vocals save it, lyrically it's so filler Bella Hadid injected it straight to her cheeks.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (6): probably my lowest score on this album but like, it ain‚Äôt too good
 
**booksandplantsand** (6): good but not great
 
**cremeebrulee** (6): i know ph actually likes this song but i‚Äôm not a huge fan. idk why it feels a lil juvenile to me
 
**jimmy345960** (5.5): It starts out great and then I get really bored.
 
**aladreeladon** (5): That chorus melody is... not it for me I'm so sorry
 
**intheaftermath** (5): this one just hasn't clicked with me
 
**Misentro** (5): I feel like this one is way too sappy to come as early in the album as it does.
 
**Stryxen** (5): it sure is
 
**MrMoodle** (4.5): The drums feel super obnoxious on this one, there are all these beautiful melodies and the instrumental is great and then the drums come in and ruin everything. It feels so awkward and clunky. I can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt seen anyone talk about this, it‚Äôs something that drives me crazy on the first half of the album and this song is by far the worst offender, I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind.
 
**CarlieScion** (4): the erratic beat in this made me uncomfortable
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (3.8): Nice lyrics ig but the production is super dated

akanewasright: # Got a little angry
 
**Alumineous** (7): The American Diabetes Association hates Blackpink.
 
**camerinian** (7): I find I only listen to this in moments of weakness, and by that I mean only when I'm shitfaced and feeling filthy. I'm sure it's good sober as well but
 
**cremeebrulee** (7): i wish this were just a blackpink song
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (7): This should have been a full-length BLACKPINK song with Gaga's spoken pre-choruses as the feature.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7): sweet üç¨ then I get a little angry üò° yeah üòå
 
**moooo566** (7): Feels like Blackpink and Gaga are both a bit wasted here. Both of them have made some really exciting music but they smushed them together in something really safe and simple. It's not bad but it's more Ice Cream (a 6) than Kiss And Make Up (a 10).
 
**Roxieloxie** (7): I got excited when i saw blackpink was on this but its not as hype as i thought it would be
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): this could probably be better as a solo Gaga song or a solo Blackpink song
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (6.9): I just realized that I haven‚Äôt had sour Skittles in like 6 years
 
**team\_kockroach** (6.8): one of the best BLACKPINK songs in a while
 
**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Eh
 
**wryn\_** (6.5): why is it so short :(
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (6.2): Blackpink's verses are the best part of this song.
 
**CarlieScion** (6): i was so excited for blackpink in like 2016. its no longer 2016
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (6): the only good part is BLACKPINK'S verses.
 
**shhhneak** (5.9): Criminally short but I guess you can only do so much with these lyrics.
 
**twistedpython** (5.5): Sounds like a Blackpink song, and it should've been just a Blackpink song
 
**ReallyCreative** (5.2): I liked this song more when I didn't know it would sound like everything else on the album
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (5): Points deduction for song duration. Needed to be longer.
 
**followingfreeways** (5): this just isnt it..this analogy is not it for me
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is literally just Sweet But Psycho but for even gayer people
 
**jexan13** (5): Worst song of the album AND worst song of Blackpink's entire discography
 
**KennyEarthman** (4): BLACKPINK's and Gaga's voices just don't blend well imo
 
**RandomHypnotica** (3): Blackpink and Gaga is a combo that could've had a lot of potential, but instead both sides feel like wasted potential here, the track is SO SHORT, it has literally no hype behind it, and the last little BLACKPINK outro feels so bizarre because there's the instrumental begins to swell, and then it just drops a few seconds later, it leaves me so empty and feeling robbed (Side note: the lyric video for this song is perhaps the worst lyric video of all time)
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (2.5): lol thinking back to when we pretended this was a good song because we were so desperate for new gaga.
 
**Flegasaurus** (2): this is like... genuinely bad
 
**runaway3212** (2): This is somehow both incredibly boring and extremely grating to hear. I can't believe people were hating on Ice Cream when this is so so so much worse
 
**wavingwolves** (2): why does this sound so... unfinished

**hikkaru** (10): I have to say, this is definitely the best Blackpink release from 2020... which is a bit depressing to think about considering they released their first album. While THE ALBUM was disappointing for me, Sour Candy is not at all, being an infectious slice of house utilizing a sample that's been in many different songs for good reason - it slaps! Honestly Gaga is probably the worst part of this track (but she's not bad) and I'd love to hear Blackpink on some slicker tracks like this in their own material instead of the usually not so great production they usually have (@teddy). I wish this made day 3 but oh well.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite songs here. I love the production so much and BP works super well with Gaga. I wish the song was longer though, all the BP girls deserved more time to shine and this song is so catchy and addictive.
 
**akanewasright** (8): A lot of people really don‚Äôt like this song, and I‚Äôm kind of not sure as to why. Like, it‚Äôs way too short, Gaga doesn‚Äôt sing enough, and the beat sounds like the one from Swish Swish‚Ä¶ but the song still slaps, and the girls all ooze charisma on the track.

# So Sweet

**Bajuko** (11): The sample on this is super catchy just like Swish Swish by Katy Perry, and I love the Blackpink parts
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (11): BANGER
 
**1998tweety** (10): shouldve been longer but ill gladly take a bp song thats actually good
 
**2dina3dworld** (10): "if you wanna fix me, then let's break up here and now" - the last person to break up with me
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): SOUR CANDY MV WHEN BESTIE üòç
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): makes me want to learn korean
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I am so sorry Gaga but my kweens (peep my flair) Jennie, Ros√©, Lisa and Jisoo OWNED this song and I am giving this song a 10 because of them.
 
**hunnybee12** (10): s-s-s sour candy
 
**J\_Toe** (10): I like it, but the sample has been used so often I wish it would have sampled a track like Big Time Sensuality or Crying by Bjork to make it standout more. Especially as What They say is a 2010 track, but Bjork's tracks are house/techno tracks from the 90s, the era Gaga is trying to invoke.
 
**JunkyGS** (10): The best BLACKPINK song released last year and it isn't even on their album.....
 
**mayolizard** (10): yass grenade seriously an 11 contender
 
**MrSwearword** (10): the feature made me nervous considering I don't use Blackpink much if at all. However this song is great. Sure it needs another minute and for Lisa to perform in Korean and Jisoo to perform in English but hey, great is great period.
 
**skargardin** (10): pretty funny how this stomps all over THE ALBUM
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i wish this song had another 30 seconds just bc i love it so much but it works well despite the short length. can't wait to club to this song part 2
 
**vayyiqra** (10): I saw this tweet that said something like "does 's-sour candy' ever just get stuck in your head for no reason" and yes it absolutely does so much. Its only flaw is being a little short.
 
**wasian-invasion** (10): TAKE A BITE TAKE A BITE not even a blink but I love how much time they each get on this
 
**bluepupz** (9.5): This has grown immensely on me. The chorus is so catchy! I feel like I would have loved an extra 30 seconds (which is why this isn't a 10), but the song still slaps. The contrast between all of Blackpink's voices and Gaga's voice is great.
 
**Iris3271** (9.5): I know nothing about Blackpink but they were really good in this
 
**celladonn** (9): Blackpink did THAT!!! And Gaga was there too
 
**fishingfor8** (9): I really like this song its a lot of fun.
 
**jasannn** (9): I highkey wish this was just a BlackPink song instead.
 
**Misentro** (9): Would be a 10 if it was just a little longer.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (9): shoulda been a proper single
 
**ryjomom** (9): We should create a class action lawsuit for gross negligence by not providing a music video for Sour Candy.
 
**seanderlust** (9): i'm a simple man. i hear a "what they say" sample, I bop. (I will be copy-pasting this comment for any future swish swish or truffle butter rates)
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): so housy
 
**bulforster** (8.8): A refreshing start to the strongest run on the album.
 
**xxrandooxx** (8.8): Gaga sure knows how to pick her collabs
 
**hielord** (8.6): the best single of the album imo, underappreciated
 
**nooodisaster** (8.5): The vibes of this song are just soooo good. It's slick af, addictive, the short length works as replay value, and it makes me want to kill virtual aliens. Sour Patch Kids deserved a song this good.
 
**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Will I get attacked by blinks if I say this is one of their best songs
 
**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): ros√© if you read this im free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. Please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I‚Äôm free. (this should have a higher score but its TOO. DAMN. SHORT)
 
**vagenda** (8.5): Gaga shows up really late in this thing and has the most forgettable parts and honestly that‚Äôs iconic in its own way
 
**zagreux** (8.5): my only gripe with this is that it needed more gaga. Still slaps though.
 
**ellezol** (8.1): i really wish lisa had a rap though :(
 
**bespectacIed** (8): Same as RoM. It's generic and dated but I felt bullied into liking it because of the star power of everyone involved. Take a bite take a bite, s-stockholm syndrome
 
**CHRMbishop** (8): OREO ANTHEM
 
**ColsonBakerr** (8): bopppp
 
**CrimsonROSET** (8): This is scored so high mainly because BLACKPINK. Gaga alone adds nothing to it.
 
**fallenriot** (8): i still don‚Äôt know how they managed to make this work so well but they certainly did
 
**frogaranaman** (8): I love how Lady Gaga is like ‚ÄúI may be traumatized, resulting in a hard exterior shell, and that may be hard to deal with at first, but on the inside I am soft and vulnerable. and once you break through, you will see my inner raw beauty as scary and jarring it may be‚Äù throughout the entire song then BLACKPINK just fucken comes in like ‚Äús-sour candy‚Äù
 
**jimmy345960** (8): icons
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8): the lyrics are almost nonsense but issa bop
 
**pig-serpent** (8): BLACKPINK's verse on this song is perfect and Gaga's parts are fine. Really it just needs more BLACKPINK
 
**rslashpoopheads** (8): the club banger this album desperately needed. rose eated
 
**Stryxen** (8): the lyric video where you can't even read the lyrics sends me
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): I wish it were longer
 
**Vromega** (8): too short unfortunately
 
**waluigiest** (8): s-sour candy
 
**whyishestaring** (8): I'm a simple girl, I hear asian girls I click like
 
**aliensexist** (7.6): Too short
 
**outsideeyess** (7.6): I'm kinda sick of this sample at this point
 
**bbfan132** (7.5): really enjoyed blackpink here, the production was good too - gaga‚Äôs parts weren‚Äôt my favorite but still pretty good overall
 
**rosecult** (7.5): stan jisoo
 
**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): It‚Äôs been months and I still don‚Äôt know how I feel about this one but I don‚Äôt think I dislike it
 
**rickikardashian** (7.4): this is just swish swish

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A noted fan favourite of the album, I totally get why people love this one. It‚Äôs pretty euphoric while being quite heavy and dark lyrically. Continuing with the theme of dancing through the pain, I think this song is definitely one of the highlights of the album.
 
**akanewasright** (8.5): This song‚Äôs scores actually fascinated me. When the first 11 for it came in, I rolled my eyes and moved on, thinking that it would be the only one. But‚Ä¶ I began to notice more and more as the weeks flew by. At one point, this had more 11s than half of the top 10. All of this for a song that I simply never cared about in any capacity. Eventually, I returned to the song, looking to see what the hell all this fuss was about, and‚Ä¶ I get it now. This is one of the best realizations of what Chromatica aspired to do: to illustrate Gaga‚Äôs pain through dance music. I‚Äôd argue that only 911 achieves this as well as this song does, and while I like that one more (as do most of you, it seems), this song does a pretty admirable job for what it set out to do. So‚Ä¶ yeah, this was a robbery. Highway robbery at that. This probably deserved Day 3.
 
**hikkaru** (8.5): This stands out among the Chromatica deep cuts as the biggest fan fave, and while hosting this rate I really came to understand why. I think it has some of the best production of the non-singles and some great lyrics too. It garnered quite a lot of 11s despite being a day 2 cut, which might come as a shock to some people... is this our Songeniality?

# Replaying the song
 
**izeasklapaucius** (11): i have the gun
 
**J\_Toe** (11): the Diana Ross sample is so perfect! And I like the computerised twinkle at the beginning of the song!
 
**jongin\_is\_shy** (11): Hard to listen to, her vocals are incredible here.
 
**Misentro** (11): A modern Gaga classic. Up there with Bad Romance, Paparazzi, Marry the Night. I will never get over the way she growls the ending of the bridge, her delivery through the whole song is so exaggerated and emotional and pure Gaga. The Donna Summer sample is genius and brings the song to life.
 
**MrSwearword** (11): my favorite song from this album and the one I return to the most. It served 1983 italo-disco realness from the first listen and I just love it.
 
**plastichaxan** (11): one of her best songs overall
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): THE DIANA ROSS SAMPLE IS LEGENDARY.
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): diana ross is fucking JAMMING in her grave rn
 
**bluepupz** (10): I love the production. The contrast between the energetic dance track and the dark lyrics is great here.
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): Tons of replay value. Geddit? Geddit? Of course you do.
 
**bulforster** (10): This is what 911 and Fun Tonight wish they were. 'The scars on my mind' is such a gnarly lyric and the way she works herself up to the last 'you had the gun'? Chills.
 
**camerinian** (10): I just love how massive this song is, but more importantly I love the grandness of the content and how Gaga delivers it. It's a song of turmoil invading your life and the panic that overtakes you as you try and fight it, and that's backed up by Gaga's biggest vocal performance and the crazy energy of the beat. This is the best song on the album and basically the thesis statement of what Chromatica should have been
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): top 3 on this album easily this shit do be on replay
 
**DaHumanTorch** (10): my second choice for an 11, this better make day 1!!!
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is absolutely one of the strongest tracks on the album. The song best illustrated the trauma Gaga faced for years, which is one of the central themes of this album.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Mother forgive me for I have sinned. I used to skip Replay for too fucking long, and now I'm in love with it.
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): I saw this video of how Donna Summer was sampled in this song and that is the sole reason this is getting a 10.
 
**intheaftermath** (10): I love this song because it feels like there are different things to listen for every time. Focusing on the bass in the chorus, the lower harmony on the chorus, the high harmony on the verses, the higher synths... every time I come back to it it feels so fresh, which I can't say for much of the album
 
**jimmy345960** (10): WHAT A FUCKING SONG, jeez i can listen to this all day. and learning the sample is crazy
 
**JunkyGS** (10): Top 3 Song of 2020 for me. An absolute banger that I find so emotionally charged and lyrically deep + haunting.... UGH. So under rated by Little Monsters imo.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (10): the best use of a sample maybe ever
 
**sirpancakeXI** (10): i really hated this song on my initial listen but it suddenly grown on me after all this time
 
**skargardin** (10): YOUR MONSTERS TOOOOOORTURE MEEEEEE
 
**Stryxen** (10): makes me do the lady gaga dance
 
**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): you little monsters torture me
 
**waluigiest** (10): she really named the most replayable, infectious song on the album Replay.
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (10): So good!!! The chorus just makes me want to shake my head around Alyssa vs Tatianna style
 
**zagreux** (10): Would've been my 11 if not for Stupid Love.
 
**seanderlust** (9.5): every single day I dig my silly little grave and I sit inside it wondering some silly little things
 
**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): This one sounds messy in the best way possible and the growl near the end is one of the only things that makes me feel emotion
 
**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): Like much of Chromatica, this song feels SO close to greatness, but I really hate the instrumental in the chorus, just before the drop. It feels like it needs more low-end to contrast Gaga's powerful vocals, it just feels really mismatched, weak, and weird. Once the chorus hits, I love it, and it's still a bop, it's just missing the slightest bit of oomph to make it iconic. This would be a 10, or even 11 with some slight changes
 
**1998tweety** (9): MASSIVE serve
 
**2dina3dworld** (9): Gaga neomu yeppeo ~
 
**deadline4mymemories** (9): feels like a modern Girls Aloud album track
 
**Flegasaurus** (9): WAIT BANGER YEAHHH OK THIS IS GOOD
 
**hielord** (9): the lyrics are so dark it just had to be a bop
 
**KennyEarthman** (9): Replay sits with Scheibe, Heavy Metal Lover, and Sexxx Dreams at the lunch tables
 
**mayolizard** (9): the message of this song is pretty sad
 
**musical\_pyn** (9): I remember this being my favorite when I first listened to the album
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9): we both reached for the gun walked so replay could run
 
**rickikardashian** (9): gays be popping their entire asshole to a song about trauma and ptsd and honestly i cannot blame them
 
**thePotatofairyy** (9): The production, the growth within the song, the growls, and the vocals. A fantastic classic Gaga song
 
**twistedpython** (9): Catchy as hell and the lyrics hit close to home but the verses are a bit nasal in an unflattering way especially for a woman already known for not having the smallest of nasal cavities
 
**vayyiqra** (9): The looping sample in the chorus is such an earworm.
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (8.7): actually really good!
 
**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Little monsters torture us all don't they
 
**xxrandooxx** (8.5): dare I say this is a song for the clubs
 
**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): even Iyaz was actually sweating for a second there when this dropped
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (8.3): Turns out, there really is a little monster inside me
 
**ryjomom** (8.3): this probably the song on the album with the least replay value, her mind!
 
**vagenda** (8.1): Something about the chorus of this song reminds me of the Hora and it gets points for that
 
**Bajuko** (8): I liked the Diana Ross sample throughout
 
**CarlieScion** (8): chromatica be like One Song but slightly Better
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): all i hear is katya
 
**wardrum5** (8): I always get this mixed up with Enigma. I wish they weren't back-to-back in the album

akanewasright: # Scarred My Mind, will be billing them for my therapy

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): it's not one of Gaga's best but it at least does something different than the rest of the album
 
**Roxieloxie** (7.5): alot of you said this was 11 material, and while i dont agree, this is good
 
**SmileAndTears** (7.5): a cute bop
 
**booksandplantsand** (7): actually like the thudding beat here
 
**fallenriot** (7): not my favorite, but still a really fun song!
 
**frogaranaman** (7): shawty‚Äôs like a melody in my head that I can‚Äôt get out, got me singing like na na na na everyday like my iPod stuck on replay replay ay ay ay
 
**nooodisaster** (7): If she actually said "You Little Monsters torture me" I would've given it an 11.
 
**pat-rickstar** (7): Great verses but I find the drop kinda meh
 
**runaway3212** (7): A fairly decent song with great lyrics and the same mediocre sound as the entire album
 
**wasian-invasion** (7): idk nothing wrong with it but the music and lyrics feel a bit samey by this point
 
**bbfan132** (6.5): just another song here, nothing special tbh
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Re-play, more like Re-petitive
 
**brenda\_official** (6): dont get why all the gaga stans love this one
 
**CrimsonROSET** (6): I really like the way the pre-chorus of this one sounds (is it flamenco-ey? idk), but then the chorus has these dissected pok√©mon cries for some reason? And then the second verse never built on it, so it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ boring.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's fine
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): Iyaz ended ha
 
**pig-serpent** (5): You know, I can dig the groove of this song even if it's incoperating all the worst elements of electro-swing.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (4.5): honestly getting a little bored by this point
 
**Iris3271** (3.5): Did not like the chorus at all
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (3): in her description it said she refused to not allow this song on the album. that was a bad call.
 
**wavingwolves** (3): i like the lyrics but i hate the sound of it i'm so sorry
 
**bespectacIed** (2): shrill and annoying
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): This song feels like a villain origin story

**akanewasright** (10): People were... divided about this song. It is a very silly tune delivered with the utmost sincerity by Miss Ally Maine, which turned off some people, but I love that shit. This is an iconic moment in pop music adjacent cinema to be honest, and it‚Äôs a bop above all that
 
**hikkaru** (9): I actually really love this song, although I didn't feel right giving this a 10. Still, a 9 is a great score! The memory of watching A Star Is Born in theatre for the first time and this song being portrayed as Ally's big sellout moment, where she's singing about her man's ass over some production that is trying its hardest to be as generic as possible, and it's supposed to be just generally a shit song, and I was there like "damn this is a bop though..." will always live in my mind rent free because it's just so stereotypical of me as a basic bitch pop fan.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): WHY DID YOU COME AROUND WITH AN ASS LIKE THAT .. WHY DID YOU DO THAT DO THAT DO THAT DO THAT DO THAT TO ME???? Gaga going full out with vocals on here kills me üíÄ
 
---
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): I really like this song, I swear it's not only for the meme.
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is so funny
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember the debate on why this song is poorly written especially coming from Diane Warren. Who the fuck cares? This is a bop. LIKE WHY DID THEY DO THAT DO THAT TO US?
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): This Grammy winning song!
 
**J\_Toe** (10): this song gives us all life
 
**Misentro** (10): Iconic.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (10): LOVE THIS SONG
 
**nooodisaster** (10): Beethoven couldn't.
 
**plastichaxan** (10): iconic song
 
**PointlessBibliophage** (10): she really did an ashley o before ashley o
 
**runaway3212** (10): pop perfection
 
**skargardin** (10): unironically bops hard as fuck
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): This is the apex of stupid pop songs. There is nowhere for music to evolve beyond this.
 
**thePotatofairyy** (10): Unironically has all the elements that I love in a pop song. Fun verse, catchy old school vibe with a fun repetitive chorus. The ahh ahh ahh ahhhhhs are what really sell it for me though. That moment right before the second chorus truly is what makes this song absolutely amazing.
 
**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): She earned that BNA Grammy
 
**waluigiest** (10): she popped the hell off with this song. It‚Äôs supposed to be bad but she clearly failed that assignment
 
**hielord** (8.5): the most unexpected song I find myself twerking to
 
**mayolizard** (8.5): this is a bop idc
 
**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it's a little grating but it's iconic how good it is for being fake
 
**1998tweety** (8): this grew on me a lot
 
**bespectacIed** (8): Jackson was such a hetero for hating on this, let ally sell out and make mindless bops!
 
**jayjaysortagay** (8): better than Chromatica oop
 
**musical\_pyn** (8): like the inverse The Cure, the verses are so good and the rest of the song is kind of a let down
 
**mysario** (8): I take it we're binning the idea of having ASIB in any rates then
 
**ryjomom** (8): Camp as tits

**jexan13** (4.5): no
 
**kirby31200** (4.5): Do I rate it highly because it works thematically or do I rate it low because it sucks
 
**rickikardashian** (4.5): she put something in this chorus‚Ä¶.. something rancid
 
**SmileAndTears** (4.5): No ma‚Äôam, no ma‚Äôam, no ma‚Äôam
 
**jsonphile** (4): okay I know the point is that it‚Äôs an intentionally vapid song in the context of the movie but it actually does sound bad
 
**rslashpoopheads** (4): Why Did You Do That (Making Me Listen To This Song)?
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): omg the xylophone is so good at the beginning but everything else was just not good imo
 
**MrSwearword** (3): useless, but a drag queen named Meatball did this song in a Halloween number and made it passable in that moment.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (3): this is what Reputation sounded like to me
 
**Brendon-Urine** (2): I have never listened to the ASIB soundtrack... and after this I don't think I will
 
**Parabox314** (2): maybe asib had a point.
 
**2dina3dworld** (1): WHAT IS THIS. Make it stop
 
**ImADudeDuh** (1): JNVKJNUIANEVKHADVNJKAVRNJKAFVN
 
**lolcevan** (1): this was the last thing i expected from the ‚Äòa star is born‚Äô soundtrack
 
**ManofOranges** (1): Few songs are actually able to get a gutteral reaction out of me when I listen to them. This was one of those songs. I first head it threw a tweet on twitter and I actually thought it was a joke or something because I thought there was no way this was actually the song everybody was referring to because it was so.... bad. And then I watched the movie and, lo and behold, there it was in all its lack of glory as Ally "sells out" or whatever, idk it's been a while. But in that moment I totally understood what Bradley Cooper was going through because this song genuinely is awful to me. It sounds detestable in every way. I do not understand how anyone could find this song worthy of anything other than a 1, like for real.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This could be on the main album and I would have been happy even if it doesn‚Äôt sonically fit with FN. We love a dance bop!
 
**hikkaru** (9): After the immense clowning that The Blessed Madonna received for her remix of Levitating, it's nice to see that this track is actually well liked. Maybe it's because the original Love is Religion isn't actually released or maybe it's just because this remix is simply better, this is the Blessed Madonna redemption arc her biggest haters didn't expect.
 
**akanewasright** (7.5): I‚Äôm excited to hear the real version of this. This version sounds a little weird to me, but there‚Äôs clearly a really good, euphoric song in there.

**mms82** (10): would be an 11 in the og rate, and the original version is also one of Dua‚Äôs best songs. Just pop perfection
 
**moooo566** (10): Love is Religion could have been a main album track imo.
 
**MrSwearword** (10): stellar work
 
**pat-rickstar** (10): This was the Blessed Madonna's peace offering to the gays upset that she "ruined" Levitating
 
**rslashpoopheads** (10): The Blessed Madonna ate this up
 
**ryjomom** (10): Deserved it‚Äôs place on Future Nostalgia (The Moonlight Edition). The Blessed Madonna deserves a Nobel Peace Prize, Medal of Honor, and to be listed as a domestic terrorist threat for what she has contributed to music. She kinda served on the remix album and live performance for Studio 2054.

**hikkaru** (9): This is a super solid album opener and what's really stood out to me about it since folklore dropped is that it's kinda ridiculously catchy?? Which I think is super apt for this era of Taylor, coming off of her most unabashedly Pop era into a ~~critic-bait~~ indie-folk inspired era, she makes sure that the listener immediately knows her fantastic melody-writing chops. I get the chorus of this song stuck in my head all the time and it's really great, but I think this is a fine position for it in this rate overall.
 
**akanewasright** (8.5): This is probably the strongest opening song in the rate in my opinion? Like, it announces its presence immediately and powerfully (‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing good I‚Äôm on some new shit‚Äù coming from Taylor gets people‚Äôs attention immediately), and does a decent job of setting up the rest of the album. This is one of the boppier songs on the album (maybe the only one that could be called a bop? Discuss, show your work), but it works really well.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): This is a cute intro but there‚Äôs something about it that falls short from being good for me. It‚Äôs just kind of one note and a bit flat. I like the groove of the song and her melody, it feels like someone is skipping through my ears but there‚Äôs just no wow factor for me from the song.

# The 10 (thanks for the joke MoonlightByWindow)

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): insert windows xp shutdown sound at 0:17
 
**Bajuko** (10): I really like the piano here
 
**bespectacIed** (10): my fave song on folklore. Reminds me of new years day which is a top 3 taylor song for me. Love this kind of authenticity and sentimentality from her, why was it so rare on the album
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): Great production, great lyrics that tell a story... perfect start to the album. Unbelievably good.
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): sends me into an emotional spiral
 
**ColsonBakerr** (10): for sure. the lyrics are simple but you can really FEEL them and her vocals on this album were actually great
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is folklore at its best
 
**followingfreeways** (10): I fucking love this song. this is such a good opener for any album but especially for this surprise drop album with a completely different genre than before. "im doing good im on some new shit" is such an iconic opening line, and the choruses make me feel nostalgic about a relationship i never had
 
**just\_thonking** (10): Honestly was not expecting to give this a ten but it has grown on me so much over time
 
**mms82** (10): possibly her best album opener? It‚Äôs just the greatest way to start Folklore
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (10): more like the 10
 
**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song felt REALLY repetitive to me the first time I heard it, but ironically, after listening to it a few more times, the track all came together and I adore it now
 
**rickikardashian** (10): https://i.imgur.com/E6eMdt6.png
 
**Roxieloxie** (10): This is the part where i reluctantly admit that theres probably at least one taylor song per era i will quietly stream on a private session spotify or on an audio on tumblr. For 1989 it was Blank Space for other albums it was ..... actually i think the one ones I like are on 1989 so nvm. That being said, maybe because this is the closest song to being pop on this album I kinda like it, maybe its because its cause its reminds me of something i will not be telling in the comments of this post. Who knows. My main point is **Taylor was absolutely wrong for putting the best song on this album first, what the fuck am i supposed to look forward too now**
 
**shesdoingyoga** (10): I‚Äôm fully expecting at least one person to give this a 1
 
**TiltControls** (10): Perfect start to the album
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): the melody is so catchy
 
**twistedpython** (10): It's already basically in the title
 
**waluigiest** (10): a truly stunning intro to a new chapter in her life. I adore this style of reflective, ‚Äúwhat if we‚Äôd made it work‚Äù song, and it perfects the trope.
 
**wasian-invasion** (10): the vibes on this song??? immaculate
 
**wavingwolves** (10): the title is missing a 0 cause this is the 10
 
**ChandelierFlickering** (9.7): perfect opening line
 
**jexan13** (9.5): Used to not like it but it's a total grower
 
**mayolizard** (9.5): such a good album intro
 
**shhhneak** (9.4): The way she plagiarized O Canada in the first two seconds of this song.
 
**CarlieScion** (9): more like the 10 am i right
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Taylor definitely watched La La Land and wrote The 1 afterwards.
 
**intheaftermath** (9): the first time I heard this song, my coworker was playing it for the first time for a group of 10 year old campers. Taylor swearing in the first line nearly started a profane kid rampage.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (9): iconic first line
 
**nooodisaster** (9): "In my defense, I have none." One of the most 'quintessential Taylor' songs on the album, but she does them so well. It's catchy, chill, tragic, or fun, depending on my mood.
 
**ryjomom** (9): The lyrics are surprisingly catchy for a slower song. A real sister to The One by Carly Rae Jepsen.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this should've been the single ngl. also the shock of taylor saying shit in the first sentence of the album (lmao)
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): totally felt this song even though I've never been half that sad. Excellent imagery
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (9): those opening piano chords sound like an autumn sunrise
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): cute
 
**2dina3dworld** (8.5): probably the most iconic opening in this rate
 
**jimmy345960** (8.5): Im doing good im on some new shit
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I love a chorus change
 
**ReallyCreative** (8.5): a solid album opener
 
**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This is the mature version of I Forgot That You Existed from Lover for me
 
**bbfan132** (8): such a relaxing/pleasant opener
 
**CrimsonROSET** (8): remember how everyone went ballistic with taylor saying ‚Äòshit‚Äô
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): i love the stripped back instrumental on this. it‚Äôs nice.
 
**ManofOranges** (8): Omg the first song on the album being called "The 1" mastermind Taylor Swift has done it again.
 
**moooo566** (8): She really said "shit" in the first line of her album. I'm so proud of her.
 
**musical\_pyn** (8): taylor should have absolutely released this as the lead single and I don‚Äôt want to hear otherwise
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (8): It‚Äôs cute
 
**sirpancakeXI** (8): pretty chill song
 
**skargardin** (8): really cute opener
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): decent little opener. Do hope we get the good parts of the roaring twenties after we get out of the bad parts we're in right now (pandemic, depression)
 
**vayyiqra** (8): :pensive:
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (7.8): Docking some points for that godawful opening line that the Swifties ate up because of their odd obsession with Taylor swearing
 
**thePotatofairyy** (7.8): cute
 
**Stryxen** (7.5): great opening track but there's not really much else to it - probably the most plain track here but the slow afternoon vibes kinda compliment the regretful and pensive lyrics
 
**seanderlust** (7.3): it's fine, but I think it's overhyped. there's better on folklore, and i'm not entirely sure why this was chosen as a single and not, for example, mirrorball, seven or the last great american dynasty (spoiler alert: those got really good scores from me)
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): it‚Äôs a really nice opener
 
**jasannn** (7): I don't hate but I never got the hype over this song.
 
**relibee2** (7): it‚Äôs definitely lost it‚Äôs sheen over the months. I easily would‚Äôve rated it at least an 8 in July.
 
**runaway3212** (7): a good opener, but I never saw it as as good as other songs here. It falls a bit flat
 
**KennyEarthman** (6.5): good opener
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): fine
 
**fallenriot** (6): might be an unpopular opinion but i don‚Äôt love this song, and i think it‚Äôs a kinda weak opener

akanewasright: # The 1 (but like for real, in the score)
 
**bluepupz** (5.5): I appreciate how comforting she sounds as she's reminiscing over lost love, but it's not my favorite sonically. I wish the piano chords wouldn't stay the same the whole time.
 
**camerinian** (5): I like that it sets the tone for the album musically, but it's lyrically nowhere near as adventurous or detailed as the rest of album is, so in that sense it's uh less than ideal
 
**Flegasaurus** (5): i almost gave this a 1 for the funny then i realized everyone else was gonna do that and it wouldn't be funny
 
**frogaranaman** (5): it‚Äôs a really bland opener and I have nothing special to say about this song because it is indeed nothing special
 
**Misentro** (5): I'm not fan of the plodding rhythm, it really grates me.
 
**bulforster** (4.7): These lyrics are way too pleased with themselves.
 
**xxrandooxx** (4.5): Huh‚Ä¶ Yup it's a song.
 
**MrSwearword** (4): "I'm on some new shit" alone warrants this score
 
**purplechilipepper** (4): I really don't get the hype around this song, she at one point tries to sing kinda bluesy and it comes off milquetoast
 
**pig-serpent** (3): This song is a pretty boring piano and drum loop and Taylor's vocals don't have any real generation or release of tension, so the whole thing feels pointless.
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (1): the way her mind predicted my score for this song. her power.
 
**SmileAndTears** (1): What an aptly titled song! Ok but really... I‚Äôm sorry but I hate the lyrics in this one, the way she sings them and I fucking hate the line ‚ÄúIn my defense I have none‚Äù. It‚Äôs so ‚Äòoh look I‚Äôm so clever‚Äô. No it‚Äôs not, it just sounds stupid. Also doesn‚Äôt help that it sounds boring as hell

**hikkaru** (10): This was my initial fave from folklore, and I definitely attest that to the vocal production, the delivery, and the AMAZING bridge. It all comes together to convey the feeling of wanting to please everyone and the anxiety that comes with that, which is a really relatable topic for me and the exploration of all sides of the "mirrorball" metaphor, from the lyrics right down to the sonics that remind me of a high school slow dance, really prove that this is one of the best on the album in my opinion. I would have loved to see it squeak in to day 3, but really I can't be upset because there's so many amazing songs across these four albums that also deserve.
 
**akanewasright** (9): This song took a while to grow on me, because I wasn‚Äôt in love with the production or melody. But eventually‚Ä¶ the lyrics kind of hit me. And specifically the bridge hit me. The image of an entire circus packing up and leaving when you‚Äôre still in the center, trying desperately to hold the attention of the people you care about‚Ä¶ it hits a little close to home. Obviously it does for a lot of others as well. I know how much this is going to hurt for swifties, more than any other cut up to this point, I imagine.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): Initially my favorite song from the album, this has shrunk a bit over time sadly. I love the vibe of this and how glittery it sounds, but her voice having this weird ‚Äúhollow‚Äù effect has made it a shrinker. I still enjoy it more than most the album though and it‚Äôs a definitely a highlight.

# Oh hey, it's a clown. Wait, this is a mirror
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): ‚Äúburn the disco down‚Äù omg 1989 disco re-recording is coming confirmed
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): when i found out this was jack off produced i waS SO SU- no this sounds like every other jack antonoff song but i adore it
 
**bbfan132** (10): i want a dream pop album from taylor
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): The production is so ethereal. The lyrics are also heartwarming. I love this song.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): a bitch might get a tattoo of a mirrorball bc of this song
 
**cocosairdep** (10): One of the few songs I go back to, and one of the few that stands on its own.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song is almost close to being my 11 because of how much I heavily identified with the lyrics. As an extrovert, I always feel like I have to show different sides of myself and make sure they are true to me but also interesting to everyone else. At the same time, I feel this struggle that I have to be always wholesome to avoid upsetting other people with my sudden mood change. Man, if only therapy wasn't so expensive, I wouldn't be writing this long-ass comment.
 
**hunnybee12** (10): this clairo-esque bedroom pop masterpiece
 
**jimmy345960** (10): this is such a magical song. I remember listening to this for the first time and knew that i loved every second of this. just the sadness of the main character dancing to no ones enjoyment but doing it anyway made it so fucking real
 
**mayolizard** (10): seriously strong 11 contender
 
**MrSwearword** (10): this is a very good song; the diamond surrounded by the coal known as this album.
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (10): Best song on the album, hands down
 
**rickikardashian** (10): this song hits a little too close to home because ive legitly changed my personality for every single person ive met‚Ä¶. at the same time every time i hear it i think about [this gif](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/297911684205641728/438357238005104640/7X6BBul.gif)
 
**runaway3212** (10): I love how even though she's a huge superstar she can still be vulnerable from time to time on songs like this
 
**seanderlust** (10): mentally I am slowdancing with my crush at a homecoming dance in the eighties. i'm resting my head on his chest because he grew taller before me. the harsh fabric of his shirt chafes my cheek but that's not really important. nobody notices us, or at least I don't notice if they notice; when I close my eyes it's just the two of us, spinning in low light, just feeling the waves of breath from each other. anyways this song is pretty kewl.
 
**shhhneak** (10): I‚Äôm a sucker for coming of age films and this transports me into an indie movie‚Äôs prom set in a small town community centre.
 
**skargardin** (10): she just got everything right here from the setting, the story, the sound etc. etc. i love it
 
**Stryxen** (10): I'm literally a cancer why would she release this
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the production on this is fantastic it genuinely sounds like a discoball
 
**Tedyonce** (10): this makes me emotional because I‚Äôm lonely
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): THE BRIDGE
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (10): i feel called out by this song
 
**wasian-invasion** (10): this feels so cinematic but also some super intimate
 
**intheaftermath** (9.5): shoutout to everyone who relates to this! Still wish it had more percussion though
 
**whyishestaring** (9.5): This song is so magical to listen to on headphones.
 
**vagenda** (9.2): Taylor make a dream-pop album challenge
 
**aliensexist** (9): Can I relate a little too much? Yes
 
**booksandplantsand** (9): this song was a grower for sure! very soft
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): i actually rly love this one i took a point off for the clown line bc i think it takes u out of the song for a bit ü§°
 
**Flegasaurus** (9): wait wait wait THIS IS GOOD it's kinda dreamy yeah??? banger
 
**jasannn** (9): This song and half the songs here would be a point or more lower if it weren't for these incredible bridges.
 
**TiltControls** (9): considering this used to be one of my least favourites on the album it's grown on me considerably since the first time listening
 
**Roxieloxie** (8.6): this is the part where I mention that two of my friends sat me down and ~~held me hostage~~ listened to this album with me for the first time to ensure that I got through it all. this is slow and my balladphobia is coming out however I do kinda like the chorus of this and the lyrics do sting just a tad
 
**ColsonBakerr** (8.5): this songs a bit slow but the lyrics really hit home and i just wanna go give taylor a hug
 
**followingfreeways** (8.5): i dont love the sound of this song, but the lyrics hurt so much. "i've never been a natural, all i do is try" has made me cry more than once. it's actually insane how she can make the most realistic lyrics while being one of the most famous singers on earth
 
**plastichaxan** (8.5): my main issue with taylor is that i feel like almost every song is missing something to be great, and then the ones i think are great still make me feel like they need something for perfection, this is one of those
 
**ReallyCreative** (8.5): as a nerdy looking white guy with big glasses, every time this sub thirsts for Jack I gain a little self-confidence I'm not gonna lie
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Not as strong as the first 5 songs, so I didn‚Äôt really appreciate it until I listened to it on its own
 
**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I feel personally attacked
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I want more pop like this tbh
 
**wavingwolves** (8.5): this is the closest taylor will get to shoegaze the same way closure is the closest she'll get to garage and for that i love it
 
**ChandelierFlickering** (8): pretty pretty
 
**J\_Toe** (8): I think this is one of Taylor's best songs that addresses her relationship to the public. It's not as in your face or ironic as Blank Space or Look What You Made Me Do, and that's for the best.
 
**twistedpython** (8): I still don't know this song is about but it's very pretty
 
**Vromega** (8): the beginning is a 10, I love this song "atmosphere" but it gets unfortunately slowly boring and repetitive
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.9): this song feels like a warm blanket. yes it‚Äôs more TaylorXJack but I like it ü•∫
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): shes grew on me but still just ok
 
**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): standout production, Jack killed it
 
**jexan13** (7.5): is this disco
 
**thePotatofairyy** (7.5): She sounds beautiful on this song

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs a good song and I understand the appeal but it‚Äôs not for me
 
**bluepupz** (6.5): Her voice is rather dreamy here, but the sound is a bit mushy? blurry? Not sure how to describe it, but something like the audio version of a blur filter on a camera.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): love the chorus, verses don't do anything for me
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I always see people hyping this up and I really don't understand why
 
**fallenriot** (6): immediately my least favorite on the album, and it‚Äôs largely stayed that way. it feels pretty out of place imo, although it has grown on me a bit
 
**team\_kockroach** (5.6): terrible metaphor
 
**KennyEarthman** (5): fillerball
 
**xxrandooxx** (4.5): giving me indie movie from the 90‚Äôs vibe
 
**2dina3dworld** (4): this just sounds like a filler track on an indie album
 
**frogaranaman** (4): if a Party City mirrorball was a song
 
**nooodisaster** (4): Umm........... no. My hottest take in this rate, I either snooze through this song or it becomes catchy in an annoying, make-it-stop way. The bridge sounds great but that's only by comparison to the awful rest of the song. (also "mirrorball" sounds like a Rugrat trying to say "miracle")
 
**pig-serpent** (4): Music for people who hang stock photos of beaches in their living room without cropping out the watermarks

**hikkaru** (10): This is a favourite of mine on After Hours and it's so sad to see it just barely miss day 3, although day 3 is pretty much songs I also absolutely adore so I guess I can't be too upset. The drums on this are just so crisp and satisfying and I love his delivery of lines like "If I OD, I want you to OD right beside me". Potentially the biggest highlight of the song though is the gorgeous transition from this track to Blinding Lights, which just really enhances the album listening experience and gives some extra intrigue to a track that has had a ton of play as just a single. Most of the time when I listen to Blinding Lights I'll also listen to Faith before it, and I may as well start at Heartless because that song is also a 10... and then when Blinding Lights is done there's really no reason not to listen to In Your Eyes as well... so yeah, with the transition especially Faith is a core part of the most beloved section of the album in my opinion, and it's nice to see it do at least decently in this rate.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): Another one of the highlights from this album, this song is just perfection. I love how grand it is and how it transition from his feeling of being high, to his feeling of coming down not only in the lyrics but also through the production. I love how haunting the ending as as well with the sirens. I feel like this song into blinding lights is the climax of this album and what a great climax is it is.
 
**akanewasright** (9.5): Ugh. The last cut of Day 2 hurts a little, because it was so close to making day 3. It was tied at #20 the day ballots were due, if I remember correctly, and it stayed there for ages and ages, and then I got a few ballots that pushed it down to 21st. I‚Äôm glad that it made it as far as it did though, because this song is fucking brilliant. I said in a previous rate that it feels like a few interludes combined, just because of how many different musical ideas are in it, but they flow so brilliantly well together, and more importantly, they‚Äôre all some of the best, most memorable 15 second cuts of the album. I was expecting this song to do worse initially, but to see it do so well initially and then falter at the last second just sucked.

# Go to church every sunday
 
**hhiggy** (11): fa11h
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (11): one of the strongest on the album, and is definitely the ‚Äúclimax‚Äù of the project. my shock at the "i want you to OD right beside me" lyric on first listen is a top Weeknd moment for me
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): a discography highlight
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): this run of songs bro
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): The Weeknd is really good at playing toxic characters in his music, and this song is the best example of that.
 
**Brendon-Urine** (10): oh man oh MAN that outro is heavenly. chills inducing. also "But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me" reminds me of that demi lovato/cool for the summer vine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ_kLnPXJCM&ab_channel=FeyzWafflez (not to make this comment entirely memey - the lyrics on this song are actually amazing/haunting)
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): holy shit this SONG. the first time i heard /that/ lyric my jaw dropped. it‚Äôs fucked up, but somehow abel makes it sound incredible. also the way this goes into blinding lights is just wow. i just hope this does well cause this is a legit 11 contender for me
 
**fallenriot** (10): without a doubt my favorite song on the album
 
**fishingfor8** (10): I first heard this song while driving at night and the police sirens at the end freaked me out
 
**followingfreeways** (10): it just shows how absolutely stacked this album and this rate is because this is an 11 for me but there's too many other 11 worthy songs....i fucking LOVE this song. truly just a stand out track from this album.
 
**frogaranaman** (10): the delivery of ‚Äúbut if I OD‚Äù is one of the hardest fucking things I‚Äôve heard in years
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): the lyrics are a little edgy w the OD right beside me but sometimes we are feeling a little edgy
 
**jackisboredtoday** (10): that outro and how it blends‚Ä¶ fucking heavenly
 
**jimmy345960** (10): Singing about not being sober anymore? The breath when he says "OD"? The police car? The lead-up to the next song? I didn't listen to this for like three months because I couldn't get through the beginning of this album and MAN was that a mistake. Home run after Home run. Great song.
 
**mayolizard** (10): jaw drop idc
 
**MrMoodle** (10): This song is wild. I‚Äôm obsessed with how this sets up and transitions into Blinding Lights, one of the most popular and mainstream songs in history, while being just like the most toxic shit ever. ‚ÄúIf I OD I want you to OD right beside me‚Äù like fucking hell lmao, it completely recontextualises Blinding Lights and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it for hours after I first heard it.
 
**nootnoot781** (10): the last minute of this song‚Ä¶ suddenly i‚Äôm no longer an athiest
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (10): Oh wow, he did THAT.
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): the perfect blend of theatrics and atmosphere
 
**Roxieloxie** (10): Well I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body. I know not everbody has got a body like you, and i gotta think I twice before i kill my hideaway and i know all the games you play, cause i play them too.But I Need some time off from that emotion, time to pick my heart up off the floor. Oh and that and love comes down with out devotion well it takes a strong man baby but i've shown you the door, cause i gotta have faith, i gotta have faith, cause i gotta have faith-a-faith-faith
 
**runaway3212** (10): I love how this really layers and then comes back to 'I lost my faith, I'm losing my religion every day' which sounds so incredible
 
**seanderlust** (10): i usually listen to these albums through headphones connected to my phone. an email came in while he was singing the part about ending up in the back of a flashing car and i audibly said "shut up!" to outlook. if you're wondering how much i was feeling this one
 
**shesdoingyoga** (10): This was probably the biggest standout from the album for me when it was released, I love the dark atmosphere it creates as well as the outro
 
**skargardin** (10): the outro is absolutely monumental
 
**Stryxen** (10): being in the middle of the 4 biggest hits from this album is such an injustice to this masterpiece!! Deserves more!! The outro!!! Hello???
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i know this song won't get the respect it deserves from this sub but it's such a fantastic song - the theme, the vocals, the production, the story-telling phew. love a sef-destructive king
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): one of his best songs
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (10): crack
 
**waluigiest** (10): It‚Äôs a massive bop, it‚Äôs got highs and lows, it‚Äôs got deep poignant writing. Excellent song.
 
**2dina3dworld** (9.5): a nice interlude, helps connect the two main singles together.
 
**intheaftermath** (9.5): I don't know why but the vocal performance on this one stands out to me. It's fantastic and I love it
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this chorus is great
 
**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Love the production on this
 
**wryn\_** (9.5): this is still jawdropping 12 months later. the synths about 2 minutes in...astonishing
 
**booksandplantsand** (9): fucking hell he did not hold back writing this huh. amazing thematic link to the poppier side of the album
 
**celladonn** (9): The production on this has me ascending
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9): goosebumps
 
**CrimsonROSET** (9): Again, I‚Äôm conflicted with this one. This album gives you queues of how the protagonist is feeling about these and they usually correlate to the lyrics, but the sound makes it seem like a good time? It‚Äôd make more sense if this came AFTER Blinding Lights, with the high dying down into reality. Still a banger.
 
**ktajlili** (9): The lead in to "Blinding Lights" chiefs kiss
 
**pheromenos** (9): that outro is so good
[/r/popheads/comments/m9d588/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_2/grmzbjm/]

=====

akanewasright: **shhhneak** (8.7): that bridge and outro into Blinding Lights‚Ä¶ Gaga wishes.
 
**bulforster** (8.5): Suffers a bit being in the middle of a run of much better hooks but the outro redeems it a bit.
 
**Alumineous** (8): He's hasn't just lost his faith religiously but he's taking a figurative leap of faith by taking a ton of drugs, which leads into the events of Blinding Lights music video.
 
**bbfan132** (8): wish it clicked with me as much as it does for other people but i still think it‚Äôs good - i really like the ending
 
**bluepupz** (8): This was a 7.5, but then I was reminded of the outro.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): "But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me" JEEZ ABEL THAT'S SO DARK AND HIGH-KEY SELFISH LMAO. But yeah, the production of this is great and the way he sang the song with some back-up vocals to give an impression that he is singing with a choir is just awesome.
 
**fedefreakss** (8): best song on the album fight me
 
**jasannn** (8): BUT IF I OD, I WANT YOU TO OD RIGHT BESIDE ME.
 
**just\_thonking** (8): George Michael outsold
 
**ManofOranges** (8): George Michael outsold, but this is a good second.
 
**mysario** (8): George Michael did it better
 
**sirpancakeXI** (8): The outro is very good
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): AND IF I OD
 
**Tedyonce** (8): verses slap, chorus is a non-event but hey! still a good song
 
**thePotatofairyy** (8): A song that, as it goes, hooks me in harder. The ending is truly beautiful. Such am interesting and great progression
 
**wasian-invasion** (8): the weeknd's voice really works on this
 
**wavingwolves** (8): the way this song is actually gay

# Maybe only go for Christmas and Easter
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): love the gregorian choir effect. halo teas
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): love the outro
 
**outsideeyess** (7): love the production choices but I'm not really into the melody here
 
**overscore\_** (7): gets a bump for how well it sets up Blinding Lights
 
**pig-serpent** (7): I don't love any one section of this song, but they all sound different enough that they combine really well and makes the song exciting to listen to.
 
**rickikardashian** (6.8): that OD line literally makes me so uncomfortable
 
**KennyEarthman** (6.5): whenever I hear OD I think about the Garfield dog
 
**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I think this song does a good job of setting up Blinding Lights, but that's all it's good for.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Mix overpowers the vocals. Do Like the transition to Blinding Lights though
 
**1998tweety** (6): kind of a snooze
 
**mythicalbeaste** (6): nice outro
 
**nooodisaster** (6): Kinda an interlude to Blinding Lights, but the outro/bridge section is a highlight.
 
**Iris3271** (5.5): One of my least favorite songs on the album, Drake deserved that diss tho
 
**ryjomom** (5): I had high hopes this song would build to a climax, but it only delivered at the very end.
 
**twistedpython** (5): The melody has never appealed to me but the song is technically fine after that. Also the lyrics are toxic and disturbing in a bad way
 
**xxrandooxx** (4.5): kinda a vibe idk
