2020 Ultimate Ultimate Rate (The Weeknd/Dua/Gaga/Taylor)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/laytk2/2020_ultimate_ultimate_rate_the/

Hello to all of the capitalists, cocaine connoisseurs, ethnonationalists, and Oreo fans joining us today. Today we begin one of the biggest, [most](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kn5y82/february_to_april_2021_rate_selection_process/) [controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kojp0e/february_to_april_2021_rate_selection_process/), and most sonically diverse rates r/popheads has ever taken on. Notably, popheads voted to include a man amongst a sea of white pop girls, and also folklore is here.

Last year, as many have noted, was perhaps not the world’s best. However, what stayed good from January 1st until December 31st was the pop music (except for [Justin Bieber’s Changes](https://imgur.com/a/E92vI9e), but we can ignore that for now). Floods of beloved comebacks, surprise releases, and out-of-nowhere rises to acclaim pervaded the year, and made everything that much more bearable for us. Many of these albums were intended for the dance floor, but every one of them has provided a great sense of escapism during a year where most people needed exactly that. Dua Lipa, Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, and The Weeknd all released year defining, career reinvigorating albums that captivated the general public and pop fans alike. So my cohosts (the brilliant u/ignitethephoenix and u/hikkaru) and I want to invite you to celebrate them all in one place, and stage a friendly, not at all bloody competition to see which artist and what song comes out on top.

# **The Weeknd - After Hours**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6YlDIxqEjvY63ffH6AwCjd) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/after-hours-deluxe/1505683705) | [Other](http://theweeknd.co/AH-dlx)

Released at the cusp of everything shutting down in North America in March (remember when things actually shut down to prevent COVID from spreading...fun times), After Hours is the fourth studio album and seventh project released by Abel Tesfaye, also known by his stage name The Weeknd. After Hours is a synth pop, new wave and r&b inspired record featuring the Weeknd’s signature writing style of themes such as turbulent relationships, loneliness, indulgence and self loathing. It blends what OG Weeknd fans love about him; the moody, somewhat toxic and dark lyrics with songs and elements that brought him newer fans; grand pop music with catchy melodies and soaring vocals. After Hours, although it contains grand radio friendly singles such as the #1 smash hit “Blinding Lights”, “In Your Eyes” and ~~future number one hit~~ “Save Your Tears”, this album very much follows a narrative from beginning to end. The Weeknd grapples with a lost relationship and how he in fact was probably the reason why it didn’t work out, as painful as it is to come to terms with. He copes and tries to distract himself, and yet he still can’t let his love go and wishes it could still work out. But eventually comes to realize that she is gone for good and he is alone again.

After Hours received many positive reviews when it came out, with many critics praising how it was his most fully realized project and consistent project yet. It also was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 444,000 units sold, 10 songs charting within the top 40 of billboard at it debut and being the 4th best selling album of 2020 in the USA. And yet the album, as well as Blinding Lights, were controversially snubbed from the Grammys awards in 2021, which led to a lot of outrage from the internet and as well as the music community. Nonetheless, the Weeknd continued to push forward and embraced the success of this era through his multiple psychedelic and classic movie inspired music videos and also booking the largest music gig of the year with the Super Bowl LV HalfTime Show. - u/ignitethephoenix

# **Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5lKlFlReHOLShQKyRv6AL9) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/future-nostalgia/1538003494) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/135236240)

In 2019, Dua Lipa was a joke among pop music fans. Many liked a few of her songs, but because of her [live performances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH7ZaBNeKcM) and because of her perceived lack of a visual or sonic identity, she became a punching bag for stans of all kinds. She had immense pressure on her from fans and the music industry to overcome the sophomore slump, so she did the only thing she could do.

She did a full 180.

From the moment she dropped the first single, it became clear that this was not going to be another collection of disparate tracks like her debut: this was a true era. That only intensified as more singles were released and she began to perform them live. Even though the era had a bit of a damper on it towards the end due to the growing COVID-19 pandemic, ~~Dua’s maskless antics~~, and the album leaking, Future Nostalgia still became one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and intensely stanned pop albums of the year. The album was exactly as streamlined, cohesive, and full of bops as everything had indicated. It yielded great success for Lipa as well: it debuted in the top 5 in both the US and UK, eventually hitting #1 in England, and yielded multiple top 10 singles around the world. It also established Dua Lipa as an undeniable pop force to be reckoned with, even outside of Europe.

# **Lady Gaga - Chromatica**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/05c49JgPmL4Uz2ZeqRx5SP) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/chromatica/1500951604) | [Other](http://smarturl.it/Chromatica)

While Lady Gaga began her career with gay-approved electronic dancefloor bangers, she eventually decided to change it up and show off how versatile she really is. She teamed up with legend Tony Bennett for a jazz album in 2014, put on her pink cowboy hat in 2016, and delved into acting in 2018, but eventually she had no choice but to go back to her roots and return to the dancefloor after much begging and hoping from her fanbase. Enter the world of Chromatica, which was introduced with the leak release of Stupid Love, a triumphant electropop track produced by Bloodpop, who would go on to aid in the production of the entire album alongside acclaimed producers such as Madeon, Skrillex, Axwell, and Tchami, among others. As a whole, Chromatica dabbles into strong house influences, which compliment the lyrical theme of "dancing away the pain". Such theme is expressed clearly in the Ariana Grande collaboration Rain on Me, which earned Gaga yet another #1 hit - Ariana is joined by icon Elton John and trailblazing K-Pop group BLACKPINK in the album's vocal collaborations. Chromatica debuted on the Billboard 200 at #1, but unfortunately the album's promotional cycle was heavily impacted by world events and initially saw a delay in release date due to COVID-19. However, Gaga thankfully came through despite all that was against the album's success and Chromatica Oreos are now available at your local supermarket! - u/hikkaru

# **Taylor Swift - folklore**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1pzvBxYgT6OVwJLtHkrdQK) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/folklore-deluxe-version/1528112358) | [Other](https://taylor.lnk.to/folkloredlx)

Taylor Swift shocked the world when, with no lead up whatsoever, she announced that she would be releasing her eighth studio album in 16 hours, a mere eleven months after her album Lover had released. The only album in this rate written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, folklore marked the first time where Swift lyrically downplayed her personal life in favor of fictional stories and imagined scenarios (in addition to a few distinctly personal songs). Instead of worrying about the pop trends, she went for a drastically different, indie-folk inspired sound, collaborating primarily with Aaron Dessner of The National, in addition to Jack Antonoff, Bon Iver, and William Bowry (aka her boyfriend Joe Alwyn, in his debut as a songwriter). This album marked the first time that Swift completely bucked all expectations, and as a result, it was heralded as her best album yet, one of the best albums of the year by many publications, and an album that was genuinely reflective of the time period it was made. The album and its lead single, “Cardigan”, peaked at #1 on their respective Billboard charts, and folklore eventually became one of the best selling albums of the year.

# **Bonus rate**

All of these artists are extraordinarily prolific, and as a result, we’ve created an optional bonus rate to highlight a few loose songs from each of them. Ranging from loose singles, remixes, collaborations, certain “sellout tracks” that were actually bops, and whatever the fuck Macavity is, each of these songs provides more of a look into these artist’s recent output.

Reminders and Notes: **You do not have to do this rate!!!** This is completely optional, but it is way more fun if you do participate. But since this is not part of the main rate, **you cannot give your 11 or your 0 to any of these songs**. Save those for the main rate. Your favorite artist is going to need that extra point. Additionally, we have decided to include the Love Story Disco Line Remix, aka “that tiktok version of Love Story”. **This remix is not on streaming services,** but we have provided a YouTube link to the song.

# **Rules**

Many people are already familiar with these rules, but since there may be some brand new raters, people who haven’t done rates in a while, and/or people who need a refresher, here they are, lightly plagiarized for your enjoyment:

* **You have to listen to and rate every song.** We will not accept any ballots with missing scores
* You have to give each song a score between 1 and 10. You are allowed to give up to one decimal place for each song (for example: a **7.5** will be accepted, as will a **5.7**, but not a **6.67** or **3.1415926535897932384**). If you use decimals, please use a period/dot ( . ) and not a comma ( , ).
* You may give **one** song in the rate an 11, and one song a 0. This should be reserved for your favorite and least favorite in the rate, to give it an extra boost in scoring. You do not have to, but again, it makes things more fun. NOTE: **You only get one 11 and one 0 in the entire rate**, NOT one 11 and one 0 per album. You cannot give any other scores above a 10 or below a 0.
* **Your scores should not be considered confidential**. We will share them with your username attached to them, and if your score sucks, we very well might publicly shame you for it (all in good fun). This is just to say: keeping your scores secret will not save you from my wrath.

If that link fails you for any reason, feel free to just privately message me (aka u/akanewasright) using the ballot format in [THIS](https://pastebin.com/mRxFVSjc) pastebin link
* If you want to change your scores for nearly any reason whatsoever, feel free to privately message me (once again, my username is u/akanewasright) and I will do so.
* If you want to spice things up, you can add a comment next to your score. If you wish to do so, please use the following format:

>Scared To Live: 10 I personally hate being alive, so I can relate

* Anything variation from that format will not be accepted. Here are a few examples of what not to do:

>Pretty Please: 0: Pretty please turn this song off  
>  
>betty: OMG my lesbian queen deserves an 11  
>  
>Replay: (4) Iyaz outsold

* Comments are not required at all, but they are highly encouraged and will make the eventual reveal much more fun.
* If you want to give an overall comment to the album, you can, using this format:

>Album: Chromatica: Why yes, I am a home of sexual, why do you ask?

* ***Do not attempt to sabotage the rate scores.*** The hosts WILL NOT accept your scores if we have any suspicion that you are trying to mess with an artist’s or song’s scores. What we will do is privately make fun of you for trying to pull that shit. So please don't.

(The bolded words are reflective of common mistakes among first time raters. I'm not trying to be passive aggressive. That'll come after I get your scores)

Thank you so much for reading (for those of you who read any of that shit, I mean), and happy rating!
