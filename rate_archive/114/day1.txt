Ultimate Ultimate Rate Reveal Day #1
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/m8nt34/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_1/

Hello to everyone, and thank you for joining us on this ~~hellish~~ fine day! It is the first day of the Ultimate Ultimate Rate reveal, and we (aka myself and my cohosts u/ignitethephoenix and u/hikkaru) are all so happy to have ~~most of~~ you here. Conveniently for us hosts, the total number of songs in the rate divides equally into three, so **#60-41** will be revealed today, along with **#16-11** of the bonus rate.

Please join us in [this kosmi room](https://app.kosmi.io/room/xafkrh) for the reveal starting at 3:30!

Some cute statistics:

* [230 people](https://pastebin.com/04QtQdR8) participated in this rate! That makes this the second most participated rate, next to last year's ultimate rate
* We had an average score of 7.550
* Our average controversy score was 1.795 (so anything with a higher controversy score than this should be considered divisive in some manner)

TiltControls: > Our average controversy score was 1.795 

That... isn't as divisive as I thought it would be for an Ultimate rate (average controversy for all rates is about 1.9). Wonder if we're going to see a lot of agreement on the placements in the rate (it is still a rate, so I'm guessing that part's unlikely).
[/r/popheads/comments/m8nt34/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_1/griczh2/]

=====

ReallyCreative: I think for the vast, vast majority of songs in this rate, people could generally agree whether it was good or bad. I see Future Nostalgia and most of folklore having low controversy scores. Judging by that value, After Hours looks like it'll have pretty low controversy as well, with Chromatica being much more controversial than the other 3.
[/r/popheads/comments/m8nt34/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_1/grids78/]

=====

TiltControls: True. I think we might hit a weird point where the scores are roughly agreed upon, but the exact ordering will be what makes it messy

**akanewasright** (0): I actively hate this song, to the point where I kind of find it hard to articulate why. Like, there are obvious reasons to hate it - the kind of pathetic chorus, the entirety of the second verse and bridge, the fucking children's choir - but that all feels like nitpicking to me. I think what irritates me the most is the smugness of the song. This song says exactly nothing shocking or controversial or valuable whatsoever (outside of the first verse, which is okay) and pretends that it's groundbreaking in some way. That gets on my nerves so much. Anyway, this breaks the record for "most 0s" formerly held by Me, Earth, and Birthday Cake. They all had 36. This song broke the record and broke it HARD
 
**hikkaru** (0): Well, surprising absolutely nobody, this is first out with an absolutely pitiful average (and is the only song in the rate to not achieve a total score of over 1000 points). The lyrics and message aren't a problem for me and in fact she did spill a bit but god I just can not stand when artists feel the need to end their album with the token ballad even if their album is just all-out dance pop. That's one thing Chromatica did right! I would have definitely preferred if this was just cut entirely and Love Again or something else was the closer. With this elimination, Dua is also now the holder of the Most 0s For One Song record so congratulations to her!
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): Is this song good? Not really but this and good in bed are a terrible way to close a great album. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as bad as people make it out to be. Clearly everyone disagrees as it has the MOST AMOUNT OF 0‚Äôs of all time! Congrats to Dua on this new record breaking moment!

# Happy Women's History Month
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): I‚Äôm a straight guy and I love this song, what does that say? WHAT DOES THAT SAY AMERICA?? inb4 ‚ÄútHaT yOu hAvE bAd tAsTe‚Äù
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Feminism????? In MY album thats supposed to be dance or sex bops only??????????? ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ omg wait‚Ä¶.. Its a BALLAD TOO??????????????ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
 
**jexan13** (10): It was originally a 9, but it makes other gays angry so it's now a 10
 
**MrSwearword** (10): for fuck sake, it's her version of Madonna's "What It Feels Like For a Girl" and that's a good thing.
 
**mysario** (10): one of the best songs in the rate, haters look ridiculous
 
**sirpancakeXI** (10): BOYS WILL BE BOYS SLANDER ARE NOT TOLERATED.
 
**jimmy345960** (9.3): so hear me out. i like songs that do social justice wrong. is it clunky? yes! but i think the message and the intent behind this song are more important then its less desirable parts. i put this and you need to calm down in a similar category with a smiley face and "you tried". but to get angry for me is too far. Theres nothing outright offensive about this song and I will say that I like it. I also thing the blessed madonna remix of this fucking SLAPS
 
**moooo566** (8.5): It doesn't quite fit with the rest of the album, but I'll still defend it as really good. It's far from the only #MeToo protest song, but I think it's the best. It's cutting, beltably anthemic, and it remains real pop earworm at the same time.
 
**pheromenos** (8.5): did i just give this the same score as Blinding Lights??? damn right i did
 
**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): It frustrates me how people misinterpret this song as saying ‚Äúwomen are superior to men‚Äù, especially the chorus, when it means that girls are forced to grow up faster and always have their guard up because of of the low standards society has for men‚Äôs behaviour. Maybe the confusion is a result of bad writing, but to me, it got across immediately.
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (8.5): excellent message, doesn't deserve that much hate.
 
**wardrum5** (8.5): If this song was included in a documentary about how sad she was to miss out on a Grammy nomination, this sub would love it
 
**CHRMbishop** (8): its catchy, whimsical, fun
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I can see why this song would go out on Day 1 for obvious reasons. But I think Dua had good intentions addressing sexism in this song and I personally think she successfully subverted the cringy phrase into something more empowering by turning to "Girls will be women".
 
**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): i know everyone is going to clown on this one but I actually like it! it just didn't really fit in with the overall vibes of this album
 
**nooodisaster** (8): I remember when you were a misogynist if you hated this song. I genuinely like the production here, and the sentiment, even if the lyrics are a little extra at parts.
 
**team\_kockroach** (8): People tend not to like this one, but it‚Äôs honestly fine. Katy Perry could‚Äôve made this 1000x worse, and for that alone I‚Äôll bump it up a few points
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): idk care what you guys say this is one of my faves off the album. It's catchy and the only song on Future Nostalgia where I actually like her vocal performace and feel she's trying to emote a feeling.
 
**mayolizard** (7.7): overhated i think
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.5): Honestly, I've listened to this album a loooooooooooot so by now I find myself being like this https://media1.tenor.com/images/c3e1f09d188bcf7df7bd72ca48fb3c2a/tenor.gif?itemid=9319745 (also the remix IS a bop and a half‚Ä¶.)
 
**ryjomom** (7.5): Now why‚Äôd she have to do that??? If this song was my child I would put it up for adoption.
 
**thePotatofairyy** (7.5): It's cute and I like how it sounds
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): The lyrics are pretty cringy, but I actually do dig the melody and stuff
 
**xxrandooxx** (7.2): such a different vibe from the rest of the album i kinda live for it also fuck men
 
**lillipup03** (7): I genuinely like this song on its own... it just makes absolutely no sense on this album.
 
**outsideeyess** (7): musically fine but the lyric about mansplaining doesn't make any sense because she isn't a man? and then I know she isn't right-wing but there's something so jarring about hearing "if you're offended by this song" in the bridge, because she sounds like an incel
 
**vayyiqra** (7): Little afraid of being cancelled for not liking this enough (not seriously) but I can't quite get over how odd it is to hear Dua doing a socially conscious feminist ballad at the end of Future Nostalgia. It's not that it's a bad song, it's just out of place and would've been better as a single for charity or something. She made points though.
 
**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): The worst thing about this is how forced/awkward the lyrics are. The songwriting is pretty good in my opinion. Still lackluster as a closing track though.
 
**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): i don't hate this as much as everyone else, the verses could do with a re write but i think its ok
 
**shesdoingyoga** (6.5): But girls won‚Äôt wear masks
 
**1998tweety** (6): this has also grown on me but its still underwhelming as an album ender, especially with 2 duds back to back
 
**astrologicalangel** (6): honestly based on what I've heard about this I was expecting it to be WAY worse
 
**bbfan132** (6): such a boring outro compared to the rest of the album but it‚Äôs not bad or anything
 
**celladonn** (6): I don't hate the way this sounds (even if it is wildly out of place on the album) but god these lyrics are cringe
 
**ColsonBakerr** (6): i'm sorry but no, this has some good lyric but as a whole it's just not it. it's like YNTCD just less loud
 
**jackisboredtoday** (6): this is definitely overhated and doesn‚Äôt deserve the inevitable first-out status its getting, but just because the hate is overblown doesn‚Äôt mean its actually good either
 
**pig-serpent** (6): A children's chior singing a preachy song about sexism is probably the worst way to end a fun disco album but somehow the song is better than it sounds.

akanewasright: # ...I guess
 
**hielord** (5.5): lmao so out of place, but nice try Dua
 
**camerinian** (5): ok I don't hate this as much as everyone seems to, the message is still important and everything, but jesus christ nothing like ending out a party album with literally zero political content with a grooveless orchestral angry feminist anthem. Again, good message, probably the wrong vehicle for it though
 
**deadline4mymemories** (5): well-intentioned but feels unfinished
 
**Flegasaurus** (5): boys go to jupiter to get more stupider
 
**followingfreeways** (5): this isnt the worst song ever made but this is absolutely the worst song on this album. it sticks out like a sore thumb among an album of all 8s to 10s. i just dont know why she felt the need to include this
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (5): The remix on Club Future Nostalgia bumps this up from a 2 to a 5
 
**jsonphile** (5): okay it‚Äôs not that bad
 
**mythicalbeaste** (5): the verses are solid but the chorus kinda ruins it
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5): it's okay on its own outside of the mansplain and offended by this song bits, but damn what a buzzkill
 
**pat-rickstar** (5): Kind of overhated. Not great but not as terrible as some people make it out to be
 
**wryn\_** (5): gays only hate this cause it calls all men out and not just straight boys... but i mean it's also just kinda bland lol
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (4.8): This would be funny as a bonus track but as the closer to the actual album I can tell why people hate it so much
 
**shhhneak** (4.3): I always forget this song exists. Why‚Äôs the production so grandiose for no reason??
 
**aladreeladon** (4): Predictable, but yeah
 
**aliensexist** (4): Missed the mark tbh
 
**CrimsonROSET** (4): I did consider giving this a 10 to ramp up the controversy score.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (4): i don‚Äôt even dislike this song that much but it‚Äôs just so out of place on the album and is a horrid closer. if this was on her debut or if it was just a standalone song it probably would be more of a 6 or a 7 but being within the album....it‚Äôs a no from me
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (4): It's not that horrible honestly.
 
**just\_thonking** (4): Boys will be skipping this song every time
 
**purplechilipepper** (4): listen I like girl power songs but like this just makes me cringe
 
**static\_int\_husp** (4): I actually kind of liked this until the Zach Witness remix (which is good) made me realize the original is not. Anyways stream the remix.
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4): the mansplained lyric is top tier cringe
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): again, the verses are plenty fine but the chorus is ???? dua we KNOW you can write a good chorus. the build u to the ending is also enjoyable
 
**Iris3271** (3.5): Excellent message, if only it sounded good
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (3): This song still hasn't grown one bit on me since it's been released.
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (3): This song really isn‚Äôt as bad as people say it is, but it has some sub-par lyrics, generic production, and it does not fit on the album AT ALL. Overall, it‚Äôs just not up to the same standard set by the rest of the album.
 
**slimboyfriend** (3): She's like, mansplaining sexism as a woman... how is that possible?
 
**wasian-invasion** (3): no bass? no subtlety? honey what are you duaing
 
**bluepupz** (2): This song does not belong on the album in my opinion. I understand and respect the sentiment, but I just don't think it fits in with the rest of the songs, and I was disappointed when this was the original closer for the album when it came out.
 
**intheaftermath** (2): I forgot how much I hated this. The only redeeming quality is the presence of strings because we need more of them in music.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (2): stinker #1
 
**SmileAndTears** (2): Regardless of whether the lyrics are good, this is just not for me. It‚Äôs a feminist anthem and I‚Äôm a man: I don‚Äôt feel empowered by this, it doesn‚Äôt do anything for me. Also it‚Äôs kinda boring and this song in particular is (sonically) the type of empowering anthem I don‚Äôt like
 
**TiltControls** (2): it's not terrible, it's just... eh. I feel like if the rest of the album weren't so strong it wouldn't be so noticeablely mediocre
 
**zagreux** (2): I appreciate the message, but this is...a disappointment to say the least. The lyrics are too corny.
 
**2dina3dworld** (1): is it me or does this song feel performative?
 
**bespectacIed** (1): fuck men! And this song for being atrocious
 
**bulforster** (1): I have to laugh.
 
**cremeebrulee** (1): this genre of ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù music only works if it‚Äôs like super fun (like little mix) or bad bitch-y (flawless, bad girls etc.) this is ‚Ä¶.. neither somehow
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (1): how is this a song that came out in 2020
 
**JunkyGS** (1): The most surface level insufferable take on feminism, holy shit.
 
**ktajlili** (1): one point for good intentions.
 
**MrMoodle** (1): Cut this song and Good In Bed, give Love Again a longer outro and make it the final track, and bam, that‚Äôs 90% of the Future Nostalgia‚Äôs criticisms eliminated. I honestly don‚Äôt know how they fumbled the end of this album so hard, it‚Äôs baffling.
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (1): why, dua?
 
**wavingwolves** (1): this song has no redeeming qualities but there's still a worse song in this rate
 
# We did it Joe
 
**alwayswords** (0): misogyny won
 
**Awkward\_King** (0): i listened to this whole album on facetime with my friend for the first ever time because she's a big dua stan and im a gay who starts loving pop girls when they bring good visuals for an era, and she cried to this song on first listen and i laughed at her and screen recorded it
 
**Bajuko** (0): What does girls will be women even mean? This felt like Dua Lipa‚Äôs fight song
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (0): I couldn't get through this song more than halfway though it was so fricking bad.
 
**booksandplantsand** (0): dua what the fuck
 
**CarlieScion** (0): this song turned me into a tradwife MRA
 
**engifear** (0): This one is rightfully hated tho. It has a decent message, but it's such a weird break from the album. If this was on a different album I think I wouldn't hate it as much, but it's just so out of place on Future Nostalgia. Also I generally hate children's choirs in songs.
 
**fallenriot** (0): the song really does have a good message, it‚Äôs a shame the execution was so tragically bad. i feel kinda bad cause i think i would judge it much less harshly if it was a standalone single instead of the closer of the album, but as it is, it really drags down the whole body of work

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): this is awful
 
**musical\_pyn** (0): please play the misandry video before you reveal this song
 
**nootnoot781** (0): boys will be boys, but girls will make the most uninspiring political and feminist anthems. see also: commander in chief, the man, ain‚Äôt your mama, NO, chained to the rhythm‚Ä¶
 
**Parabox314** (0): not this.
 
**RandomHypnotica** (0): Oh boy, what a trainwreck.. the lyrics are hamfisted and clunky, sonically and lyrically it feels out of place on the album, and it's just a REALLY weak closer, and a weak track in general in consideration of the whole album. The instrumental is kind of nice, but it's not enough to save it. And I love the ol' "YoU cAn'T cRiTiQuE tHiS sOnG oR YoU'rE bEiNg SeXiSt!" as a convenient excuse to ignore people calling it out for being the awful track it is
 
**ReallyCreative** (0): the lowest is what?
 
**rickikardashian** (0): i was ready to write an entire thesis explaining why i dread this song with my entire life, but then i remembered that i can justify this 0 by saying ‚Äúthis has a kids choir‚Äù and that‚Äôd be enough
 
**Roxieloxie** (0): I will not be giving akane the satisfaction of breaking the 0 record (nvm the akaneyola worked)
 
**runaway3212** (0): It's truly impressive how this song makes Better Than Revenge looks like a feminist anthem
 
**seanderlust** (0): this is so true Alexa play chained to the rhythm
 
**skargardin** (0): the poetry
 
**Stryxen** (0): girlboss moment
 
**Tedyonce** (0): it is possible to write a good song about feminism. this is not an example of one. I LOOOOVE ballads, and Dua, I love you....but oh my god.
 
**TheQueenOfVultures** (0): I'll take lukewarm takes on feminism for 400
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (0): still don't understand why this made the album
 
**twistedpython** (0): No words
 
**vagenda** (0): There‚Äôs fumbling the bag and then there‚Äôs Baby‚Äôs First Social Commentary hijacking the pop album of the year with less than 3 minutes on the clock and driving it off a cliff. Disastrous
 
**waluigiest** (0): I fucking hate this song. I hate everything about it. But most of all, it is INFURIATING that she throws the line ‚Äúif you‚Äôre offended by this song, you‚Äôre clearly doing something wrong‚Äù in the middle of the most bland, uninspired feminist-in-aesthetic-only anthem full of platitudes. This anthem is 15 years behind the discourse but it‚Äôs so arrogant. I can‚Äôt even engage with this.

**akanewasright** (10): I watched this movie in the theater. This scene was the only time in the movie where I felt anything besides dead inside. It‚Äôs also generally iconic. Believe it or not, this song and #15 were actually neck and neck for last place for a while. I would have laughed so fucking hard if this beat out anything in this rate, but alas, the people were not amused

**hikkaru** (10): Anything related to CATS (2019) is a 10 and I will hear no slander. Did its release cause COVID? Maybe so. But this film was a joyous experience and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh. What's funny here too is that Taylor doesn't even embarass herself nearly as much as so many of the other people in the movie - she's no Rebel Wilson, that's for sure. But her performance of Macavity doesn't tickle the fancy of many people clearly, as it completely flopped in this bonus rate. Sad!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Yep this is a musical theatre song, I guess she did a good job but this is just weird üíÄ

# Monsters of depravity

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I wanted to be the only ten it got... so here I am!

**brenda\_official** (10): THE NAPOLEON OF CRRRRIME

**fallenriot** (10): i hated both this song and the movie, but as more and more time has passed i‚Äôve realize i‚Äôve never since felt quite as alive as i did sitting horrified in that theater

**jayjaysortagay** (10): this gets a 10 just because I still can't believe it exists. Taylor Swift dressed as a humanoid cat with an English accent shaking her titties caused COVID I think.

**LesApfels** (10): Absolutely iconic

**mysario** (10): RELEASE THE BUTTHOLE CUT

**rickikardashian** (10): i forced u/roxieloxie to watch this, and it was such a nice experience to see her go through that i can‚Äôt give this anything lower than a 10

**runaway3212** (10): THE BEST SONG EVER RECORDED

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): a cat, is not a doG

**waluigiest** (10): I love CATS. The movie was bad because it tried to create a cohesive narrative where there wasn‚Äôt supposed to be one, and they couldn‚Äôt settle on a reasonable aesthetic. Taylor Swift is one of the few actors who got the assignment, along with Jason Derulo and Ian McKellen. This performance is fun, it‚Äôs camp, it is nonsense, and I love it. Long live Bombalurina!!!

**Bombay\_Mapper** (9.1): This may just be 'Delusional Swiftie Me' showing itself, but it's actually quite fun! The movie itself can burn though.

**Aquamarinerock** (9): unironically its so fun

**twistedpython** (9): Cats might have been a trainwreck but this song is an unironic banger and Taylor did better on a Broadway track than I ever thought she would. Also her screaming "WIDE AWAKE" is the funniest thing to me

**relibee2** (8.5): BRITISH TAYLOR.

**aladreeladon** (8): expose me if you want, this song lowkey slaps

**bbfan132** (8): i was expecting the worst but this was good?? i liked the rock edge

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I was gonna give this a 10 but girl this is 5 minutes long.

**nooodisaster** (8): I swear to God this movie is why COVID happened

**wavingwolves** (8): both fun and funny and the bad bri ish accent makes it better

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): I am far from being an expert in Cats and I want to keep it that way because the premise of humanoid cats is just ridiculous. However, I really enjoy her theatrical performance here and it's definitely such an out of comfort zone moment for her.

**overscore\_** (7.5): I saw Cats in theaters. Twice. I was only high once. No regrets.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Cats was an experience, 10/10 would recommend

**thePotatofairyy** (7.5): the song isn't as good without the performance. She unironically really killed it in the movie.

**aliensexist** (7): As someone who actually saw CATS in the cinema I‚Äôm obliged to like this. How was Taylor Swift singing in an English cat accent about Idris Elba one of the least weird things about that film. The accent wasn‚Äôt too bad tho

**booksandplantsand** (7): god I hate that she wasted these vocals on fucking cats

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): was this movie good? no. Did I enjoy it? yes, absolutely

**intheaftermath** (7): skimbleshanks would've gotten my 11... but as a Cats stan, Taylor's vocals are so strange on this? Where did she get that accent? Why are we using this? Neither the 1981 nor the 1983 cast recordings play up the accent like she did or sing wiht that breathy tone?

**jimmy345960** (7): cats is a fucking trip

**pat-rickstar** (7): I hate that I kinda like this

**ColsonBakerr** (6): omg. including this after folklore was just cruel i'm cry-laughing rn. She sounds good in places but that accent?? and everything else i mean i-

**hielord** (6): is this a nod to the butthole cut? TAYLOR?

**rslashpoopheads** (6): big shiddy big tiddy

**1998tweety** (5): meh

**cremeebrulee** (5): what sort of dirt do you think they had on taylor for her to do this movie

**deadline4mymemories** (5): one of the better songs in Cats, which is the lowest of bars

**LeninaCrowne94** (5): At least she had fun making it.

**cocosairdep** (4): Is she trying to do a British accent?

**hunnybee12** (4): god this movie is cursed

**mythicalbeaste** (4): why did y'all make us rate this one dead emoji

**ReallyCreative** (4): well

**Roxieloxie** (4): Remember when I said my two friends helped me listen to folklore so i'd get through it, when they played this, thats when it became a hostage situation

**thedoctordances1940** (4): I have never been into musicals soooo

**vayyiqra** (4): "Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity. He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare: At whatever time the deed took place‚ÄîMacavity wasn't there!" Memorable quote but this sucks.

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): Some people just don't have voices for musical theater and that's okay!

**ellezol** (3): lmao i was THIS close to not experiencing any of cats

**KennyEarthman** (3): it was ok... but it just went on & on & on & on

**2dina3dworld** (2): maybe it's the fact it's from the Cats movie, but this just gives me the heebeejeebees

**imasalesman** (2): oof

**hikkaru** (9): This is quite overhated in my opinion, though I do get how people would find it really obnoxious. I think the descending chromatic scale in the chorus is really fun and fits well with the immensely tongue-in-cheek lyrics and production elements that make up the rest of the song, and I just love "DAMN WE KNOW HOW TO FUUUU-UUUUUCK". It's a 9 for me because it's just every so slightly not as good as most of the rest of the album for me, but I still really like it and think it for sure deserves better than second boot.

**akanewasright** (7): I‚Äôve never hated this song like many other people do, but like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not gonna defend it. I think it's fun, but not all that good. I don't skip it when it comes on at the end of the album (unlike certain other songs), but I rarely if ever listen to it on its own. It‚Äôs very ‚Äúmake up‚Äù from Thank U, Next, but I think more people like that song (which‚Ä¶ says a lot about how much people hated this one)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): The second weakest track on the album, it‚Äôs no surprise that this is second last in the rate. More divisive than BWBB, some people absolutely love the fun Lily Allen sound of the track while others loathe it and think it‚Äôs annoying and dumb. I‚Äôm personally indifferent about it. It‚Äôs fine but not something I come back often. The good pipe in the moonlight line is iconic

---

# Damn we know how to fuuuuuuuu...

**Awkward\_King** (11): i will never understand the hate... it is a fun, trashy 2000s/lily allen inspired song abt just fucking. the chorus isn't meant to be genius is vaguely droning and dumb as fuck THATS WHY ITS FUN. dua's cadence on this song reminds me so much of eliza doolittle the british singer i remember being obsessed with her debut album when i was like 9

**intheaftermath** (10): I'm sorry, but I was THIS close to giving this my 11. I love the almost-smug vibe her vocals give off, and it really cheers me up for some reason.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is a good song and I don't give a fuck!! Good in Bed haters stay mad!!

**MrSwearword** (10): it evokes Lily Allen realness and iCannot believe how much hate this song gets, it's amazing

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): controversy score go bubble pop sound

**static\_int\_husp** (10): this is gonna be majorly robbed but I really really wanna see Take A Daytrip produce more pop. This slaps.

**Stryxen** (10): come take it out on ME HEE HEE! anyway this song is so fun controversy record incoming please!

**whyishestaring** (10): It feels great being tasteless, actually.

**ellezol** (9.7): this song is a bop i don't know what's wrong with y'all

**Bajuko** (9): I think the lyrics are hilarious on this, and I like the piano on the track

**hhiggy** (9): please stop the slander.

**moooo566** (9): This didn't immediately click with me quite as much as the rest of the album but actually it's amazing. Dua's horny on main and I'm here for it.

**Tedyonce** (9): lily allen vibes

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9): This song is good, bury me on this hill

**wavingwolves** (9): people who hate this hate fun!

**mms82** (8.9): just fun and upbeat

**vagenda** (8.9): History WILL vindicate Good in Bed stans

**ColsonBakerr** (8.5): i want to be annoyed by this song but who am i kidding

**followingfreeways** (8.5): this is such a FUN song i think it's way overhated!! i legitimately love it so much

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I'm not sure anyone who thinks this is as bad, or even worse than BWBB has functional ears

**ryjomom** (8.5): cheeky and catchy like chlamydia

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This should have been saved for the deluxe edition (and replaced with If It Ain‚Äôt Me and That Kind Of Woman), I know the comments will beat this point to death but it really doesn‚Äôt sound like the rest of the album and not in a good way. Besides that, I actually really like it

**twistedpython** (8.5): I hate that people hate this song

**thePotatofairyy** (8.2): I don't care about lyrics so sonically I just love how this song is. That said, the chorus has really really lazy writing .

**xxrandooxx** (8.2): lyrics make me uncomfy but damn this shit catchy like a ball

**1998tweety** (8): def has grown on me a lot, i dont skip it anymore

**Brendon-Urine** (8): I'll never understand people lumping this in with Boys Will Be Boys - neither are a terrible song, but this is a great song.

**CHRMbishop** (8): overhated, sure the sad bad mad rhyme is doubtful but this is a banger

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is so overhated and for what. that chorus is fun idc stop lumping this in with BWBB

**deadline4mymemories** (8): I love Lily Allen

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Lmao I can't believe y'all hated this song so much lmao. I legit liked this song even though it's obviously a filler track of this album. The only complaint I have is that the bridge is way too short smh.

**engifear** (8): Good is bed overhated. Sure, it's a Lily Allen rip off, but baby that's what makes us good in bed this song good.

**Flegasaurus** (8): i think this song is really good good good good good actually

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): It's not /that/ bad. Methinks y'all need some good piping...

**jayjaysortagay** (8): overhated

**NotWith10000Men** (8): I unironically like this one and have from the start. "good pipe in the moonlight"? Popheads come on

**wailord\_fan** (8): Hot take: this is so sassy and Dua absolute kills this song and its delivery.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8): I‚Äôm sorry I like this.

**LeninaCrowne94** (7.8): Turns out I actually like this song, but the lyrics still kinda suck

**NecroDolphinn** (7.2): This is a good song and I stand by that

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it‚Äôs a fun song

**Alumineous** (7): It's honestly not bad.

**bbfan132** (7): ‚Äúplea-ea-ea-ea-ease‚Äù is like nails on a chalkboard for me ngl, but the verses are good - i love the lily allen-esque nature of the song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I‚Äôm gonna go against the current on this one- I think this song is fine! Come on popheads, this is not even near as bad as hyperpop.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Since we live in a post-Met Gala 2019 world I'm allowed to call this song camp and enjoy it without any sense of guilt.

**hielord** (7): This song is not that bad as some of you wanted it to be.

**jasannn** (7): This song isn't that bad bad bad bad.

**jsonphile** (7): it would be a six but ‚Äúdamn we know how to fuuuuck‚Äù is a fantastic line

**lillipup03** (7): I don‚Äôt get why so many people hate this... I mean, it‚Äôs one of the weaker songs on the album, but it‚Äôs still pretty good.

**mythicalbeaste** (7): Not terrible! Doesn't deserve the hate. "Good pipe" tho?? üòÑ

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): pls i never wanna hear about anwar's dick game again

**TragicKingdom1** (7): it's cute

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): she is not as bad as y'all make out

**WillamThunderfuck** (7): Just not the biggest fan of this, but it‚Äôs still fine. The repetition annoys me a bit.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6.9): hehe get it

**noctilucentvibes** (6.5): i had to deduct a point because of the awful popping sound

**Bombay\_Mapper** (6.4): Kind of groovy, really. Definitely very average in the context of the album, but otherwise pretty nice. Unnecessary swearing is unnecessary

akanewasright: # It's really bad (bad bad bad bad)

**booksandplantsand** (6): it's fine but like. still disappointing

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): It‚Äôs not a great song, but it does fit on the album, which is more than I can say about the song after it.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): It's not "good", but at least it's memorable, which is more I can say for most songs on Future Nostalgia.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I don't like this song because 1) it's a thematic departure from the rest of the album 2) The instrumental isn't as gripping as anything else on this album 3) She didn't have to put a post-chorus in here, but she did just to rhyme BAD, SAD, and MAD...

**fallenriot** (5): overhated? yes. good? no.

**frogaranaman** (5): if this song is a reflection of how good in bed y‚Äôall are, you guys need to either be watching new porn or getting different dick because it is not as good as y‚Äôall are saying

**pig-serpent** (5): Meh chorus, cringe lyrics, and neutering of what I like about this album leaves for a meh expereience.

**Roxieloxie** (5): the way this song is literally just my roommate ( same one from dsn) and her fwb/boy toy who she she would tell me about in detail about how good he would fuck her but they were terrible at communicating with each other, this song was truly made for them.

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (5): . . . oh my god this wasn't great.

**wasian-invasion** (5): why was this on the album while love is religion didn‚Äôt even make it onto the deluxe

**wryn\_** (5): honestly it's all good except for that stupid boing noise and the way she says 'fuck' in the final pre chorus

**shhhneak** (4.9): It‚Äôs cute but such a sharp decline from the previous tracks. More so Positions than Future Nostalgia.

**\_SoulGlitch** (4): Slightly better than BWBB but still bad

**bluepupz** (4): I originally gave this a 5 for a "meh", but then I was reminded of the chorus.

**mayolizard** (4): ugh such a slog

**MrMoodle** (4): bad bad bad bad bad

**musical\_pyn** (4): at least it‚Äôs fun?

**ReallyCreative** (4): people defend this one and they really shouldn't

**rickikardashian** (4): how come after break my heart there's just 7 minutes of silence huh

**sirpancakeXI** (4): my rating would have been much lower if it wasn't for the zach witness remix

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): lily allen does not sound like this. you are saying lily allen sounds like bad music. in conclusion, lily allen sweetie

**TheCatApologist** (4): Just what?

**vayyiqra** (4): The chorus is aggressively irksome but the song gets some points for the memorable phrase "good pipe in the moonlight".

**bulforster** (3): She says right in the song she knows it's really bad.

**KennyEarthman** (3): it's bad but at least it doesn't take itself seriously

**nootnoot781** (3): something something i know it‚Äôs really bad, bad, bad, bad

**pat-rickstar** (3): I can excuse travelling in a pandemic, but I draw the line at putting this on the album instead of If It Ain't Me (with Normani)

**seanderlust** (3): "good pipe in the moonlight" https://i.pinimg.com/originals/59/1a/aa/591aaabd9465ec6f2eb779caeb576e5d.png

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): this song deserves a 0 because the chorus is so gratingly bad but i'll find the positives which are the verses

**team\_kockroach** (3): eww that chorus

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2.5): I‚Äôm sorry this song is making me physically cringe. Especially cause it‚Äôs probably about Anw*r üòî

**bespectacIed** (2): The primal anger I have whenever i get reminded of the existence of the last two tracks... Literally drawing dick doodles on a van gogh painting. Dua you are not Lily Allen!

**skargardin** (2): I know it's really bad bad bad bad

**waluigiest** (2): I liked this on first listen because I thought it was just a fine Amy winehouse impersonation. Now I realize it‚Äôs all terrible - the performance, the writing, the production. It gets higher than 1 only because of what comes right after it

**aliensexist** (1): I honestly fucking hate this song but a zero seems to harsh

**givebackmysweatshirt** (1): at least she was self aware to stick the filler at the end of the album

**runaway3212** (1): Dua I don't want to hear about your boring heterosexual love life

**2dina3dworld** (0): the sex can't be good enough to justify this shit

**camerinian** (0): Hey who put this Anne-Marie song here

**fedefreakss** (0): worst song on the whole rate i hate it i want to forget about it

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this is so fucking bad jesus christ. This is the worst hook in a song by a ‚Äúmain pop girl‚Äù since Bad Blood by Taylor Swift, and I swear to god, the only reason people like this is more than Boys Will Be Boys is because its upbeat and you can technically bop to it.

**Iris3271** (0): What the fuck.

**jackisboredtoday** (0): this just sounds so bad I can‚Äôt believe this was released instead of like‚Ä¶ any other song she could‚Äôve picked

**jimmy345960** (0): sorry, the chorus is grating, where some of the others songs are forgettable at best, this one is annoying in the worst way

**nooodisaster** (0): This is where I'm putting all my Dua-COVID frustrations. But even without that, this is BY FAR the worst song in this rate, so y'all can't even say I'm sabotaging.

**oscarbrierley1** (0): doesn't fit the album at all, kinda catchy ig

**rslashpoopheads** (0): stinker #2

**SmileAndTears** (0): Chorus sounds like ass. I thought I‚Äôd come around this song but everytime I hear that damn chorus I just want to skip it

**teenage\_meme** (0): probably the worst chorus i've ever heard

**TiltControls** (0): Dua's right - It is really bad, bad, bad, bad

**veryanniev** (0): I‚Äôm only giving it a zero because I absolutely despise the annoying chorus, the rest of the song is okay

**hikkaru** (8): I actually really like the production on this track but at the same time I can't help but agree with the people that say that this ruins the absolutely stellar run of tracks from Heartless through to the title track. It also kinda irrationally bothers me when artists make "interludes" that are whole ass songs !!! but like yeah I definitely get why this is leaving so early and as The Weeknd's first track.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): when I heard that Tame Impala would be on this album I was so excited as I just got into him right before this came out. However I found this a bit disappointing as it‚Äôs basically an interlude that‚Äôs actually a shortened track. Kevin Parker does do a good job here but lyrically it falls a bit flat and I feel like it‚Äôs not as psychedelic as I hoped. Anyway stream Skeletons as the superior Tame Impala Weeknd collab!

**akanewasright** (6): I understand this song‚Äôs purpose on the album, as a moment to send The Weeknd back to his depressive outlook after the relative warmth of the last song and set up the title track of the album. But sonically‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt do much for me at all. I don‚Äôt skip it, and it‚Äôs perfectly nice, but it‚Äôs never a track I come back to on its own.

---

# Easily manipulated

**fishingfor8** (10): I know nobody likes this Interlude but I absolutely love it.

**cremeebrulee** (9): dont mind me just here to raise the average (its a good interlude imo but it could‚Äôve been cut from the rate)

**mythicalbeaste** (9): these lyrics called me out

**seanderlust** (9): good girls go to heaven and bad - oh wrong rate

**wavingwolves** (9): one of the strongest instrumentals this album has

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): I know the rates are too heavy on my mind because my first thought after seeing that this was an interlude was 'damn this was the song that broke their link last month'

**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.7): Slightly repetitive (expected for an interlude though), but if this was a proper song with the same production, it would probably be a 10.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is quite a long-ass interlude but I am glad we are rating this as a separate song. It's quite hypnotizing as Weeknd keeps singing "You don't love me" and it's very effective tbh.

**Flegasaurus** (8.5): don't sleep on this one just cause it says (interlude)

**camerinian** (8): I kinda love how this really tender, cute set of messages is totally undercut by how vindictive the chorus is. Classic Weeknd

**frogaranaman** (8): the production on this song is honestly fucking god send, but I do wish it was more replayable overall

**lolcevan** (8): idk why this is an interlude when it‚Äôs as long as a regular ass song lmao

**ReallyCreative** (8): a ballad interlude? we love an undeserved first out

**twistedpython** (8): One of the better interludes I've heard this year, but I rarely choose to listen to this song

**bbfan132** (7.5): basically a song

**jasannn** (7.5): This is such a good interlude. It gives you a break after the upbeat run of the past three songs and segways perfectly into After Hours.

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): It should be illegal to call something an interlude if it is longer than 2 minutes

**1998tweety** (7): cute filler

**ColsonBakerr** (7): as interludes go this was pretty good

**static\_int\_husp** (7): yup, that's an interlude-type beat

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): attacked

**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7): the one-minute instrumental at the start is annoying.

**TiltControls** (7): honest question - is it really an interlude if it's like 3 minutes long?

**vayyiqra** (7): Chill lo-fi beats for the Weeknd to lecture you about your sex life and/or relax to.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this sounds immaculate but I want a real Kevin Parker/Abel collab instead of an interlude

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): the feeling of being in limbo

**bluepupz** (6.5): This may be an interlude, but I like it. It's very relaxed and gives chill vibes.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): The lyrical content is kinda‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ questionable, but the song itself sounds nice

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): abel out here have interlude tracks longer than most artist's proper songs atm (ariana i'm LOOKING at u)

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I expected better from a Kevin Parker x The Weeknd collab

**CrimsonROSET** (6): do you think he labelled this as an interlude so people would skip it

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Not Abel putting a mediocre full-length song in the middle of a streak of megabops and calling it an interlude...

**jimmy345960** (6): Interlude pretty good.

**KennyEarthman** (6): nice but forgettable

**musical\_pyn** (6): I get why this is an interlude, but I wish it wasn‚Äôt

**nooodisaster** (6): im the captain now

**pat-rickstar** (6): The run of songs from Heartless to After Hours is almost flawless except for this

**skargardin** (6): this is pretty awkwardly placed between two highlights but oh well

**Stryxen** (6): I forgot I was listening to this but it's also very chill

# Abel spilled, we don't love him

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): Toxic man at his peak lmao ü§†

**izeasklapaucius** (5): while i'm no balladphobic, i AM interludephobic :)

**plastichaxan** (5): i never really know what to rate interludes

**runaway3212** (5): This has the misfortune of coming after a great 4 song run, it's just clearly not the same quality

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): This a completely pointless interlude. I guess it's here to help bridge the gap sonically, but maybe Abel should have just came up with a better paced album instead?

**LesApfels** (4.5): How is this an interlude it's 3 minutes long

**mayolizard** (4.5): boring

**xxrandooxx** (4.5): idk if i can repeat all of that king

**fedefreakss** (4.4): okay maybe this is my least favourite i totally forgot it existed lmao

**fallenriot** (4): is it really an interlude if it drags on for an eternity?

**NotWith10000Men** (4): I just can't do slow jams. And coming after the one two three punch, it never had a chance

**pheromenos** (4): what kind of interlude is 3-minute long

**pietrohonkhonk** (4): Male Manipulator Music /s

**pig-serpent** (4): The echo on this track helps it stand out a little but it's still boring.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): it's an interlude all right

**Tedyonce** (4): I keep forgetting how this sounds tbh

**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): i mean it's an interlude but i did like the visuals he served on spotify

**ryjomom** (2): I‚Äôd expect a harder instrumental from an interlude.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (2): probably the most forgettable song on After Hours

**vintagebathingsuit** (1.5): creepy AND boring

**booksandplantsand** (1): lyrically subpar and unnecessary

**Jackalope117** (1): The only interludes I like are Halsey's? Actually those are some of the weakest songs on Manic too. Interludes just suck when rating individually

**joeeswift** (1): genuinely couldn‚Äôt find any redeeming qualities surrounding this...it just goes on for too long imo

**wasian-invasion** (0): idk if it really deserves a 0 by itself, but i HATE how this kills the mood between Save Your Tears and After Hours

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): This is okay, it‚Äôs definitely a filler track here and I get why it was put on deluxe/ it doesn‚Äôt really fit with the rest of the album and definitely is cutting room floor material.
 
**hikkaru** (6): I will write the same thing for all of these After Hours deluxe tracks: it is VERY easy to see why they are deluxe tracks. Some albums hide hidden gems there, but not this one. They're not horrible or even bad in my opinion, but I don't really have any reason to listen to the deluxe album at all because they're just kinda there.
 
**akanewasright** (3): This song has never stuck with me past its runtime. Well, at least not for good reasons lmao

# Gonna miss you when you're gone
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I love Louis Tomlinson, I think he's a very interesting artist.
 
**Iris3271** (8.5): Would've been higher if the term baby boo didn't make me throw up in my mouth
 
**Stryxen** (8.2): pleasantly surprised i liked a bonus track this much
 
**mythicalbeaste** (8): wow I like this one, the outro once again!!!
 
**relibee2** (8): I‚Äôd love it a lot more if it was longer.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.8): someone tell me why the second verse makes me want to cry
 
**jasannn** (7.5): Sounds like something off My Dear Melancholy.
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): I remember when he played this on insta I thought it was a demo & was so hyped about it, but it was the final version so it was actually kinda mid
 
**camerinian** (7): I reckon they could have done a lot more with this than what they did, just tacking it on as a bonus. There‚Äôs a good ass foundation here
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (7): best of the bonus tracks but that's not saying a whole lot
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): this one is slow jammy too but I like it? who am I?
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7): Eh, could‚Äôve been cut.
 
**bbfan132** (6.5): this didn‚Äôt feel like anything
 
**intheaftermath** (6): it's alright, but I'm not a big fan of the lyricism here
 
# Not gonna miss this bullshit
 
**1998tweety** (6): snooze
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (6): It's filler.
 
**skargardin** (6): this doesn't leave much of an impression
 
**moooo566** (5): I mostly rated this album in one go, but I had to go back because I didn't even notice this happened until I went to rate Final Lullaby and found a gap in my sheet. At least it's inoffensive.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (5): no ‚ù§Ô∏è
 
**pig-serpent** (5): Fine melody is holding the song up from being a snooze.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5): forgettable
 
**runaway3212** (5): a bit corny
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (5): bit basic
 
**wasian-invasion** (5): If I listened to this as much as the other songs on the album, I might have more of an opinion on this
 
**wavingwolves** (5): very okay but only that
 
**2dina3dworld** (4.5): boring
 
**KennyEarthman** (4.5): this track... exists
 
**lolcevan** (4): boring lol, lot of these songs are very same-y just in general
 
**ReallyCreative** (4): this is kinda corny in comparison to the rest of the album, it doesn't add anything either
 
**booksandplantsand** (3): cannot forgive the use of the word "boo" in 2020
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): It‚Äôs just nothing special. Not bad by any means, but I feel like with a better instrumental (or maybe as more of a ballad?) this could‚Äôve been a lot more poignant

akanewasright: # "This was obviously a bonus track"
 
**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): Again, very clearly a bonus track, although this would probably have worked better as an interlude than Repeat After Me
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): doesn't feel as crisp as the non-bonus tracks
 
**fallenriot** (6): yeah, this is a bonus track
 
**fishingfor8** (6): glad this is a deluxe edition track but it's not bad
 
**twistedpython** (6): Cute but it blurs into the rest of the album for me and deserves to be on the deluxe
 
**waluigiest** (6): it‚Äôs a bonus track for a reason
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (6): I get why this is a bonus track
 
**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): I can see why this wasn't included in the standard edition, it's VERY forgettable
 
**frogaranaman** (5): probably my least favorite bonus track, kind of has nothing going on
 
**kwcty6888** (5): the deluxe tracks are all so forgettable
 
**ryjomom** (2): I see why this was a bonus track.
 
# People who actually listened to the lyrics
 
**cremeebrulee** (7): i dont love this one but the ‚Äúi missed you baby boo‚Äù line is cute (it reminds me of the the sugar boo line in levitating lol)
 
**SmileAndTears** (7): It‚Äôs good but I see why it was left off the regular version
 
 
**followingfreeways** (6.5): this sounds nice and all but "baby boo" is the worst thing ive heard him say ever
 
**bluepupz** (5.5): This is pretty inoffensive, and I'm not sure that the deluxe version really benefits from its addition? I'm not a fan of the "baby boo" being used throughout the song.
 
**LesApfels** (5.5): "Baby boo" makes me physically cringe
 
**mayolizard** (4): boring also who tf says baby boo
 
**MrMoodle** (4): I missed you baby boo yes it‚Äôs true lmao what are the fucking lyrics on this chorus they sound like a fourth grader wrote them
 
**nooodisaster** (4): "I missed you, baby boo" uhhh huh

**hikkaru** (7.5): Here we have Gaga's first loss in the rate, and I have to agree that it's probably the weakest on the album. I say that giving it a 7.5 because I still enjoy it, but I'm okay with it leaving this early. At least it's sandwiched between two of the best songs on the album to make up for it being a tad weaker.
 
**akanewasright** (5.5): I feel the need to say that this is not my lowest score on Chromatica. I don‚Äôt think its very pleasant to listen to, but at least there was an attempt here. You can tell she put *some* effort into it at least, and there's a decent amount of *camp* here, as some people pointed out. My issue is that I don‚Äôt think it sounds very good
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): easily my least favorite from the album, this is one song I skip pretty much everytime it comes on. Overall it‚Äôs just annoying to me, lyrically and sonically. This could have been cut for me and nothing would be missed.
 
---
 
# State of art and Microchipped
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): this is like what i think the fame would be if the album aged better, kinda vapid surface level bright pink pop it's fun i fuck with it
 
**MrSwearword** (10): sure Skrillex's name is on this, but that doesn't deter from the fact this song is 1980s soundtrack pop perfection. Gaga's ear for melody with the I-E-I-E parts add to the song's charm.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (10): one of my favorites on the album, can't get enough
 
**ryjomom** (9.5): Sofia the Robot realness.
 
**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): This might be the most underrated song on the album
 
**aliensexist** (9): People just don't understand this song man
 
**nooodisaster** (9): I fucking love the intro to this song. And the outro. And the chorus. Actually-
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): good work with the metaphoric lyrics!
 
**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): I can't really explain why I like THIS cheesy metaphor more than any of the other ones on Chromatica, it just works for me
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.5): A bit dated (seeing a trend here) but the symbolism in the lyrics is solid and overall it's very enjoyable.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I can't listen to this song without thinking of that comment from a Popheads user that said "So this is basically what Gaga sounds like if she is singing a Katy Perry song" üíÄ
 
**SmileAndTears** (8.2): The bridge is so fucking good!!!!
 
**ColsonBakerr** (8): the MEEEEEEEE gets me
 
**J\_Toe** (8): Some say this song sounds generic and that the doll/bot/mannequin/toy theme has been used by Britney, Katy, Charli XCX, and many more. But you have to remember that Gaga's ex pre-Chromatica was a Gaga stan since before they dated, and even got a tattoo of Gaga's face during their relationship. So that idea of being a play-thing had particular resonance for this point in her career.
 
**skargardin** (8): i love this bridge even though she's doing a bit much deadbanana
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): oh wait this is actually better than I remember
 
**vayyiqra** (8): One of the more forgettable tracks but it does bop.
 
**rickikardashian** (7.8): this sounds like an ava max song where she tries to sound like gaga
 
**seanderlust** (7.8): god can you imagine if the "i'm microchipped" line took off as an anti-vax trend on right wing tiktok? thank god all of the log cabin gays think theyre too cool for gaga.
 
**followingfreeways** (7.5): im not in love with the lyrics but i really like the production on this
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Yeah, I know, we all expected a song called Plastic Doll to be better
 
**wasian-invasion** (7.5): nothing too special with the production, but the prechorus gets stuck in my head at the randomest times
 
**wavingwolves** (7.5): enjoyable
 
**whyishestaring** (7.5): This started out good, but that chorus is so cheesy
 
**outsideeyess** (7.3): I appreciate her *Fame Monster* vibes, but I really don't appreciate the line "but I'm no toy for a *real* boy". I love the outro and wish that was in the song more
 
**1998tweety** (7): shes cute a bit
 
**cremeebrulee** (7): i dont completely hate this one its a lil cringe and she‚Äôs oversinging at times but this song makes me feel a little sad ‚Ä¶. maybe thats why i like it
 
**jimmy345960** (7): good song
 
**ManofOranges** (7): Barbie doll type beat.
 
**mayolizard** (7): ok then
 
**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): Ava Max - Not Your Barbie Girl
 
**waluigiest** (7): This was one of my initial favorites but I definitely don‚Äôt return to it
 
**bluepupz** (6.5): My favorite part is either the bridge or the stuttery outro. I think this rating is lowered by the fact that I often listen to the Chromatica II section by itself, and I feel like this is the weakest song in that bunch.
 
**Stryxen** (6.5): I feel like i shouldn't like this one but it's pretty fun
 
**AHSWeeknd** (6): it‚Äôs grown on me overtime, in reality would give it a nine but don‚Äôt wanna be boxed. However, it‚Äôs a lyrical down point in Chromatica
 
**booksandplantsand** (6): campy but not great
 
**CarlieScion** (6): the chorus melody is good and i like her growls. but literally everything else is so trite dskfnfds
 
**fallenriot** (6): probably the most forgettable song on the album, but still decent
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): honestly what boys will be boys should‚Äôve been.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): eh. filler

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): another song with great verses and a meh chorus
 
**team\_kockroach** (5.8): not sure why but it seems a little soulless
 
**bbfan132** (5.5): don‚Äôt like the spoken word part and the chorus is kind of disappointing‚Ä¶ production is fine though
 
**CrimsonROSET** (5): this is the most boring way to make a song like this, Barbie Girl did a better job.
 
**frogaranaman** (5): it‚Äôs not as bad as everyone makes it out to be but yea it absolutely goes nowhere. also dolls are creepy I fucking hate their vibe, what the fuck are they doing staring at me in the dark? fuck you
 
**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5): meh
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (5): Filler
 
**oscarbrierley1** (5): i forget this song exists
 
**ReallyCreative** (5): this song had potential but it needed to lean in on being more experimental
 
**twistedpython** (5): "I-E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I" is annoying and the rest of the song never quite recovers
 
**vagenda** (4.6): Gaga on autopilot. Shallow, obvious, first-draft material. I know she can do better than this
 
**wryn\_** (4.5): sounds like a bad version of lucifer by shinee lmao
 
**bulforster** (4.4): This is a pretty tired concept at this point, Charli's Femmebot did it way better fairly recently too.
 
**2dina3dworld** (4): Barbie Girl did it better
 
**Roxieloxie** (4): i get what she was going for but that doesnt mean that I like it in anyway
 
**rslashpoopheads** (4): Aqua - Barbie Girl outsold
 
**runaway3212** (3.5): I feel sad for her, but also this song is annoying
 
**Brendon-Urine** (3): this is the only song where Gaga just sounds straight up grating to me
 
**Flegasaurus** (3): i don't know if this is actually bad or if i'm just sick of hearing basically the same song over and over
 
**pig-serpent** (3): It sucks that even with Skrillex on here the production isn't that much better than the average song on this album. Even so, this song just isn't well written.
 
**mms82** (2.5): just kind of annoying
 
**bespectacIed** (2): Great message horrible execution
 
**camerinian** (2): I always get this and Free Woman mixed up in my head, but this is so much worse because the writing is just that fucking lazy.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Why Did You Do That has better lyricism than this. There's absolutely nothing redeemable or memorable about Plastic Doll.
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (1): gaga really tried coming for my 0 with this one
 
**lolcevan** (1): i had no recollection of this song, that says enough
 
**Misentro** (0): I hate this song. Hate hate hate. The fact that some people like it makes me hate it more. I love you Gaga but this one can sit in the corner with Bad Kids and Jewels N Drugs.
 
**sirpancakeXI** (0): the intro is a no, also what the hell is that part where she goes i.e.i.e.i.e.i.e

**akanewasright** (9): I didn‚Äôt realize that this song was as disliked as it was when I gave this score lol. I found it to be easily the strongest of the bonus tracks on my first listen, and while Nothing Compares has grown on me since then, I still think this is a really lovely song.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): I really enjoy how different this is from everything else (and the lullaby quality of it) but I get why this is just a deluxe track. Lyrically it is a snooze and just kind of too stripped back for me. However it does make a good closer for the deluxe album thematically as The Weeknd decides to put the relationship to rest at last.
 
**hikkaru** (6): I will write the same thing for all of these After Hours deluxe tracks: it is VERY easy to see why they are deluxe tracks. Some albums hide hidden gems there, but not this one. They're not horrible or even bad in my opinion, but I don't really have any reason to listen to the deluxe album at all because they're just kinda there.

# Sweet dreams
 
**runaway3212** (10): This song is all I want in a song and more
 
**Flegasaurus** (9.3): i love the production on this one SO much...
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (9): It sounds almost 8-bit, which for a ballad is really interesting. Love it.
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): nice end to the album, I like how he changed the instrumental's theme a bit.
 
**TiltControls** (9): someone put this over jigglypuff singing in pokemon
 
**SmileAndTears** (8.8): I really like this one. Should‚Äôve been on the regular version
 
**2dina3dworld** (8.5): the first half is so much stronger than the second half.
 
**ReallyCreative** (8.5): arguably the deserved standard edition closer, kinda loops back to the style of the opening tracks with a lovely conclusion
 
**Awkward\_King** (8): i take back my shade at these bonus tracks this is cute as fuck
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This is a really fitting outro, I prefer it to Until I Bleed Out.
 
**intheaftermath** (8): now this feels like a credits song
 
**MrMoodle** (8): I‚Äôm a sucker for lullaby-sounding songs like and stuff like that, tbh you could probably play any song slowed down on a music box and I‚Äôll start internally weeping for my lost childhood I‚Äôm a little bitch
 
**musical\_pyn** (8): ooh yeah this is a really good closer
 
**mythicalbeaste** (8): very pretty
 
**nooodisaster** (8): A good second ending.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8): so soothing. I think this could have been on the standard edition honestly
 
**pat-rickstar** (8): A better closer than Until I Bleed Out if you ask me
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8): while the other two bonus tracks feel like bonus tracks, this feels like a song that should have been on a different album
 
**skargardin** (8): can't wait for the comments of how this "lullaby" put them to sleep, I think its a great closer
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8): Congrats to Abel for having one bonus track that's prety good
 
**twistedpython** (8): The most forgotten song on the whole album and it doesn't deserve that
 
**wavingwolves** (8): i love the instrumental and production on this so much for some reason
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): This was interesting, until it wasn‚Äôt. Out with a whisper, i guess.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): an artist who has an excellent closing track even for the deluxe album, we love to see it
 
**bbfan132** (7): pretty but not totally drawn to it
 
**frogaranaman** (7): calling out u/ThatParanoidPenguin [for listening to this song 212 times in a row after going through a breakup](https://i.imgur.com/YDSz3rS.png)
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7): sounds nice but i always forget this was released‚Ä¶ so i guess the lullaby does kinda put me to sleep
 
**WhyDidEverIBother** (7): these songs are fine enough but I see why they aren't on the real album.
 
**1998tweety** (6.5): bops a little
 
**AHSWeeknd** (6): not the best
 
**bluepupz** (6): It's a nice lullaby-esque song that works with similar elements found in the rest of the album.
 
**booksandplantsand** (6): now THIS would have been a better closing track for me
 
**cremeebrulee** (6): again, don‚Äôt really love this one but i like the chill vibe
 
**followingfreeways** (6): it's very clear why the deluxe songs were not originally on the album. they are so much weaker
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): I really like the literalness of this song, from the background instrumental to the simplistic lyrics. This is also probably the most mature least toxic Weeknd song of all time.
 
**KennyEarthman** (6): I want The Weeknd to sing me to sleep
 
**moooo566** (6): This sounds like the intro to a much more interesting song.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): yes I do really need to sleep thanks for reminding me Abel
 
**wasian-invasion** (6): yeah i think I prefer the standard version
 
# Yawn
 
**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): The title is accurate, it DOES make me sleepy
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (5.4): I would like this a lot more if it were a 1 minute interlude
 
**fallenriot** (5): i‚Äôm kind of a sucker for lullaby-like tracks, but i feel like his voice doesn‚Äôt really work for that type of song
 
**hunnybee12** (5): was this necessary
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): honestly all these bonus tracks are kinda useless
 
**jasannn** (5): He sounds like a robot.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5): sure I'll go to sleep
 
**ryjomom** (5): Thank god this album is over. Goodnight
 
**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (5): Was lullaby because it makes the listener sleepy???
 
**camerinian** (4): I mean, I guess it's the point that it puts me to sleep?
 
**pig-serpent** (4): It's different but it's also still dragging the album out.
 
**Stryxen** (4): it ends right as it gets interesting lol
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): this puts me to sleep [2]
 
**xxrandooxx** (4): goodnight king
 
**mayolizard** (3.5): super boring
 
**fishingfor8** (3): umm anyways
 
**lolcevan** (3): i don‚Äôt care for this one either. decent album though with some really great stand-out tracks
 
**Brendon-Urine** (2): It's a good thing these last 3 tracks are bonus tracks cuz uh... they're clearly not album quality
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (2): boring

FluffyNobody: I have to say I'm surprised that the lakes still hasn't gone out, I thought it would be bottom 5 in this rate (although to be fair, I listened to Chromatica exactly once and I haven't gotten to After Hours, so maybe my judgement is quite off-base here)

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song unfortunately split a lot of people. There were those who were bored or put off by its sound, and those who felt connected to it. Considering how many frontline workers are out here, going through hardships like those expressed in the song, it‚Äôs no wonder why a decent number of people felt personally connected to it. I‚Äôd never considered it one of my favorites, but it‚Äôs one of few songs in this rate that can actually bring me to tears in the right circumstances, and that counts for a lot in my eyes
 
**hikkaru** (6): This is pretty and, um, that's about all I have to say about it. It's fine but like the other tracks around this part of folklore's tracklisting I don't have much desire to return to them ever I fear. A worthy day 1 cut I think.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (0): definitely my least favorite song on the album. I hate her vocals here, this style doesn‚Äôt work for her at all. And it‚Äôs just boring and drawn out for no good reason at all. I couldn‚Äôt even finish it re listening to it again, it just is painful and not for me.

# Newly enlightened
 
**ColsonBakerr** (10): my dad's a doctor and my grandma lost her life to COVID and I just... this song during this time was an experience in itself I don't listen to it cause I can't without bawling
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I have a feeling that this song is going out at Day 1 and it really sucks that this is underrated, both within the general Popheads users and Swifties. I loved how she beautifully painted the parallels between her grandfather's time in service and the current COVID-19 situation that our medical frontliners are facing. To further contextualize, I am a Filipino, and my country's corrupt government is poorly handling the pandemic and it makes my blood boil to see how the government continues to neglect our own frontliners, from giving them very low payment despite overtime to giving them vaccines with efficiency rates that is not enough to protect them from COVID. The bridge of the song just fucking hurts when I think of how my government neglected our countrymen frontliners. Sigh.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Unsettling and grim, not something I would have ever imagined a Taylor song to be.
 
**fallenriot** (10): this is the centerpiece of the album in my opinion, it feels so reverent and somber.
 
**intheaftermath** (10): I'm not a very emotional person when it comes to pop music, but this brought me to tears the first time I heard it
 
**pat-rickstar** (10): This song is beautiful. I will be so mad if it's Taylor's first out
 
**runaway3212** (10): I don't care that people hate this, it's pretty and the lyrics here are great
 
**Tedyonce** (10): this makes me cry a lil
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (10): excellent tribute to soldiers, I genuinely cried.
 
**TheCatApologist** (10): this song killed me
 
**TiltControls** (10): immensely underrated track
 
**TipsyTom55** (10): My soul left my body momentarily methinks
 
**joeeswift** (9.5): this song grew on me so much after watching the BBC news segment about covid with this playing in the background. so poignant.
 
**pheromenos** (9.5): the lukewarm reception of this masterpiece is abominable
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): this song's gonna be robbed, I just know it. I love it, think it sounds very ethereal, and an unexpected subject for Taylor to write about
 
**wryn\_** (9.5): ok so this is the best song on folklore. if the comparison between covid nurses and young soldiers on the frontline doesn't make you cry then maybe you're just evil or something
 
**jackisboredtoday** (9.1): nicki voice i just had an epiphany i need to go to tiffany‚Äôs
 
**Awkward\_King** (9): this is tonally not the time but i thought the word epiphany was made up for the simpsons movie until i was like 13
 
**bbfan132** (9): feels like i‚Äôm floating in air
 
**celladonn** (9): Something very haunting about this track, depending on my mood it can make cry a little
 
**ChandelierFlickering** (9): very beautiful
 
**jexan13** (9): It was a 6 for me until the Disney+ special. Hell, what a devastating song, I couldn't stop crying.
 
**jsonphile** (9): I‚Äôm guessing this is gonna be one of the first folklore songs out but I really dig this song it makes me feel things
 
**mayolizard** (9): i know none of the words in this song but it feels so powerful and sad :(
 
**nooodisaster** (9): You have to be in the right mood for this to hit, but I promise you when it does, IT DOES.
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (9): This song is so underrated, I don‚Äôt get why people hate on this song and then listen to invisible string
 
**ReallyCreative** (9): it's gorgeous and I really like the meaning behind it
 
**skargardin** (9): when this is one of the first folklore tracks to go because most will find it to be a snooze :reverseoprah:
 
**SmileAndTears** (9): It‚Äôs so ethereal? But like in a sad way
 
**Stryxen** (9): a piff üòî a knee ü¶µüòç
 
**aliensexist** (8.9): V sad but I love the 'experimental-ness' (not the right word but I can't think of the right one)
 
**CarlieScion** (8): this makes me sob
 
**followingfreeways** (8): this does not deserve what people say! I think this is such a beautiful song, the melody isn't my favorite but i really appreciate how she tried to capture a universal feeling of helplessness in tragedy
 
**jimmy345960** (8): another really good perspective
 
**mythicalbeaste** (8): soothing
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8): Another one that I usually skip just because it‚Äôs painful
 
**wasian-invasion** (8): they loop this 24/7 at the pearly gates
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): def a grower
 
**2dina3dworld** (7.5): can someone please explain what this song is about?
 
**team\_kockroach** (7.4): she uses her high register more effectively on the evermore album, but it still sounds good here
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): love her storytelling capabilities
 
**fishingfor8** (7): this album is very enjoyable, i dont have a lot of comments for it and in a good way. Just chilling and listening to it is probably the best way to listen to it.
 
**Flegasaurus** (7): !!!! ok i like this
 
**overscore\_** (7): A great album closer
 
**twistedpython** (7): Very delicate, and I'm rarely in the mood for this song, but when I am it's the best song ever made
 
**vayyiqra** (7): I love church music and this reminds me a bit of it somehow.
 
**wavingwolves** (7): the documentary taylor did made me much more appreciative of this song but i can't fault others for thinking it's sonically boring
 
**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): I kind of wish she'd try this vaguely dream-pop sound more, there are parts of this song I like a lot.
 
**camerinian** (6.5): I think I like the concept of a Taylor Swift ambient song, maybe just not this particular Taylor Swift ambient song
 
**ktajlili** (6.5): maybe the weakest, but it ain't bad. maybe a tad cliche but I think it's pretty.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): wew
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (6.1): In a PURELY objective world, this would be in the top 3 of the album. However it's just too sad for me to get through.
 
**rickikardashian** (6.1): i relate to this because i also be thinking way too much when i only have 20 minutes to sleep

akanewasright: # I just had the brilliant idea to skip the song
 
**CrimsonROSET** (6): My epiphany is that I should have just listened to this song sped up like I did with some others. This spaced-out singing is my least favorite trend in music.
 
**nootnoot781** (6): this song has no right being almost 5 minutes
 
**RandomHypnotica** (6): the first time I heard this, I thought the lyrics were ‚Äúwith you I serve, with your iPhone 10‚Äù
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): It's pretty, but the verses are underwritten
 
**waluigiest** (6): the only skip of the album
 
**slimboyfriend** (5.5): When folklore first came out, I was obsessed with this song because I thought it was a metaphor for death. Now that I realize that it's not, it ain't that good.
 
**bluepupz** (5): This feels a little out of place, and I find its placement in the tracklist a bit odd. It's nice and atmospheric, though.
 
**frogaranaman** (5): man what the fuck happened during this song I have absolutely no clue
 
**jasannn** (5): Sorry, it's too boring for me.
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (5): why does this remind me of the hymns i had to sing at my catholic school lmfao
 
**MrSwearword** (5): the organ is lovely, the song itself is boring
 
**musical\_pyn** (5): the backstory to this is kinda cool, but I find the comparison of frontline soldiers and frontline workers a little too heavy handed...maybe ill appreciate this more after the pandemic is over but for now it‚Äôs a no
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.8): you listen to this once and then never again
 
**booksandplantsand** (4): i swear I don't hate healthcare workers its just a little much
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (4): starts strong and then just goes nowhere
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (4): i like the instrumental on this song, but the vocal performance reminds me of the little kid Christmas caroling extras in a low budget Christmas movie. it‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs kinda boring
 
**KennyEarthman** (4): it's ok but I'm bored again
 
**xxrandooxx** (4): I like the instrumentals.
 
**DaHumanTorch** (3): this is easily bottom 1 on the album it‚Äôs SO boring like....what was she thinking with this one. i mean it‚Äôs pretty i guess but that‚Äôs all i can say about it
 
**ManofOranges** (3): I just had an epiphany that I don't like this song.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (3): total dud for me. I do NOT fuck with covid songs, I just cannot do it. brad paisley's no I in beer is the one exception
 
**sirpancakeXI** (3): this song is so boring i got distracted during the middle part of the song
 
**bespectacIed** (2): already forgot what it sounded when the song ended
 
**ryjomom** (2): reminded me of a boring funeral
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): this is a bore. i have never liked this style of music
 
**cremeebrulee** (1): its boring + i listen to music to not think about the pandemic so i skip this
 
**Roxieloxie** (1): nothing else can peak what I wrote for the mini rate in h.c.r. so i will copy that here 'she really dose kinda sound like shes in her indie cosplay era because all of these songs have sounded like those European white women i only ever come across in a grab bag rate that half of plug will literally commit a crime when she goes out at number 42'
 
**feetinurmouth** (0): boring despite a lot going on in the track
 
**hunnybee12** (0): grueling to listen to it all the way through
 
**WhyDidEverIBother** (0): I have never been able to work out what this song is about and nothing in it makes me want to.

**hikkaru** (8): Chromatica is an album that is all bops no ballads, but this is the one track that nearly sounds like it's BEGGING to be a ballad, especially with the inclusion of the piano demo on the Target deluxe. Some people have said they'd prefer this track a fair bit more if it was actually a ballad, but being the brainless basic bitch I am give me some boppy production and I'll like the song no matter what, which is definitely the case here!
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This is one of the rare songs that is brought down by the chorus. The beginning chorus is amazing and I enjoy the verses as well, but end of the chorus into the drop is disappointing and forgettable.
 
**akanewasright** (7): I was a little charitable to this song since I came back to it and had it stuck in my head occasionally for like a month after the album dropped. But truly, I don‚Äôt think that many people are surprised at this leaving so soon. 
 
---
 
# I'd rate it 1000 doves out of 10
 
**camerinian** (10): Songs with this sort of heavenly explosion just cut directly to my core. I can't look at it critically, the sound of this is just awe-inspiring
 
**fallenriot** (10): i didn‚Äôt love this one on my first listen, but it quickly became one of my favorites on the album
 
**rosecult** (10): not me crying to this in the car after my grandpa passed away :(
 
**ryjomom** (10): like the amount of doves this song deserves
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i feel like popheads won't like this song for being "generic" but omg imagine this song live
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): My favorite vocal performance of hers from this album.
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9): carve "i'll do anything for you to really see me" into my skin also open up the damn clubs
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (9): ROBBERY ALERT!
 
**lillipup03** (9): I don‚Äôt get why y‚Äôall hate this song... it might be my favorite on the album
 
**mythicalbeaste** (9): I like it a lot, feels very 2011
 
**nooodisaster** (9): "I need you to listen to me." Damn, that's how you start a song.
 
**skargardin** (9): such a great pop ballad
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): Prince could get by with 2 doves but I gues if Gaga uses 1000 to get this, I'm fine with it
 
**twistedpython** (9): I have no idea what I love so much about this song, but there is something irresistible to me in here somewhere
 
**Flegasaurus** (8.5): theoretically i should hate this but i kind of really really really like the chorus and i'm not sure why
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I personally like this one but I can see it going out super early
 
**seanderlust** (8.3): lift me up just a small nudge: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0gYzdkCIAAaszW.jpg
 
**brenda\_official** (8): ‚Äòwhen your tears are falling i‚Äôll catch them as they fall‚Äô is unacceptable lyricism
 
**mayolizard** (8): the lyrics :(
 
**MrSwearword** (8): the piano version from the Target CD version is better but the album version is cute.
 
**xxrandooxx** (8): Cruella de Vil starring in the new movie 1001 doves feat. Lady Gaga
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute
 
**thePotatofairyy** (7.5): I rally love the sound of this song. She sounds beautiful and the production is nice but I find myself not reaching out for this song much.
 
**bulforster** (7.2): I like most of what's going on here I just wish the lyrics made more sense.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): this makes me so depressed. Gaga get therapy and tell the monsters to suck it
 
**frogaranaman** (7): holy fuck, that‚Äôs got to be at least like seven doves
 
**intheaftermath** (7): better than Plastic Doll, but I still forget about it all of the time
 
**musical\_pyn** (7): is this where I can say joanne is my second favorite gaga album
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): it takes a bit to get going but it's a bop. Not quite up to the heights of sour candy to sine tho
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): Sour Candy, but make it SoulCycle(tm)
 
**wasian-invasion** (7): she sounds great but wouldn‚Äôt really listen to this on its own
 
**Roxieloxie** (6.7): this is just Cant get out of my head
 
# I'd rate it 1 dove out of 1000
 
**bbfan132** (6.5): another song on this album
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6.5): Eh. I think the song's emotional factor was downplayed by the song's upbeat production. Yeah, not a fan of this. But hey, Gaga's vocals served here.
 
**slimboyfriend** (6.5): It's almost good and the imagery of her trying to fly with broken arms is really funny
 
**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Eh
 
**vagenda** (6.3): Without a doubt one of the last songs on this album
 
**bluepupz** (6): I won't be adding this to my playlists, but it's a pleasant song. This falls into "meh+" territory.
 
**booksandplantsand** (6): falls into the category of bloodpop filler again
 
**CarlieScion** (6): why did i think she sang 'beep boop' when she said blih-bleading
 
**CrimsonROSET** (6): if this was a ballad it‚Äôd be an 11
 
**fishingfor8** (6): oh hey it's the exact same drop again. I'm a big edm fan but normally there's different voices on top of the same drop. But it's just Gaga on the same drop over and over again.
 
**followingfreeways** (6): i dont like or dislike this song. its there. i wouldnt skip it, but i wouldnt seek it out. its okay
 
**hielord** (6): meh
 
**jasannn** (6): I didn't need another basic instrumental drop this far into the album.
 
**Stryxen** (5.8): forget table but I want to like it
 
**Iris3271** (5.5): Good enough song, a little boring
 
**jexan13** (5.5): The doves were flying over gaga and had diarrhea
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (5): Filler.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (5): this kinda sounds better than most of Chromatica but it also sounds exactly like the rest of Chromatica
 
**ReallyCreative** (5): suburban development sprawl levels of basic house
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (5): filler.
 
**2dina3dworld** (4.5): meh
 
**cremeebrulee** (4): i‚Äôm not usually balladphobic but
 
**MrMoodle** (4): Man am I really not a fan of this album
 
**nootnoot781** (4): that drop‚Ä¶no
 
**plastichaxan** (4): cute lyrics but zzzzz
 
**KennyEarthman** (3): beat drop choruses need to go away
 
**pig-serpent** (3): Man these 1000 gecs copycats are really getting out of hand.
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): all of these mediocre songs sound the same at this point
 
**waluigiest** (3): sorry it really is a flop
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): i was wondering why i haven't listened to this song in awhile and then i listened to it. ah yes, another skip.
 
**bespectacIed** (1): boring
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (1): this is awful and ruins the otherwise flawless last stretch of songs in the album
 
**runaway3212** (1): what's 1+0+0+0
 
**wavingwolves** (1): i don't even know what to say

**akanewasright** (10): This was my immediate favorite from the album, and I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm alone in that opinion. I will always live for a concept being played out well, and this just works so perfectly. In the back half of the song, Abel just sounds possessed. He doesn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôs having fun or anything, just like he‚Äôs watching himself from outside his body. I always saw this as best possible lead-in to Heartless, where he begins to indulge back in what he missed when he was with the woman he sings for, but only after we see how miserable that stuff can be in this song. But even by itself, this song is a slinky, sleazy, and kind of horrifying slice of R&B.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love the moodiness and just how dark this song is. This song is represents the low point for The Weeknd (personally) but overall it is executed very well. However this is still in the bottom half of the album for me just because it‚Äôs a tad long for me and just doesn‚Äôt grab me as much as other tracks.
 
**hikkaru** (6): I'm not the biggest fan of this track to be completely honest, it's just a bit of a slog and I'm an impatient bitch that can't sit through something this long. But it's okay, because after this is the immaculate run of BANGERS, so I'll still listen to this. Overall I'm not at all shocked that it's leaving so early.
 
---
 
# Just had sex in the studio üòé
 
**bbfan132** (10): the title makes you think that it‚Äôll be this epic song but instead it‚Äôs a soft, lush dream of a song
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): come for me but I think the repeated interlude about fucking bella hadid in the record booth is sinister and nasty in the best way
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is SO GOOD UGH!! the production is so smooth and that switchup halfway through‚Ä¶ deserves better than what it‚Äôs gonna get
 
**CrimsonROSET** (10): i don't know abel, (s)he‚Äôs br(ok)en just doesn‚Äôt have the same ring to it
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): it‚Äôs over 5 minutes and it‚Äôs sexy as hell ofc I like it
 
**jayjaysortagay** (10): This is perfectly-produced and the lyrics do their job perfectly.
 
**Parabox314** (10): that bridge... i'm ascending.
 
**runaway3212** (10): The mood in this song is unmatched
 
**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): I love this song so much. It‚Äôs just a perfect song from Abel.
 
**nooodisaster** (9.5): The first masterpiece of the album, imo. It's just so grand and encompassing, and feels like a statement piece. "She a cold-hearted bitch with no shame / But her throat too fire" is what I strive for every partner of mine to say about me.
 
**Alumineous** (9): He's not kidding, he's leaving California. Abel is an excellent storyteller. You feel like you're living through his experience.
 
**fallenriot** (9): bring back 6+ minute songs
 
**fishingfor8** (9): underrated slow burner on the album. Not the most notable song on the album but it's supposed to be that way.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (9): hidden gem
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): This song is a work of art. The only place on the album where the lyrics really shine.
 
**aliensexist** (8.5): 'she pulled up to the studio' lives rent free in my mind
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (8.5): we love a six minute song in the streaming era
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I don‚Äôt remember liking this one when I first heard the album but it‚Äôs definitely grown on me
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (8.5): would be higher if not for the cringey ass outro
 
**frogaranaman** (8): can we make LA a stale topic but irl? I don‚Äôt wanna hear from those people again they suck
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (8): If it wasn't the title of one of my favorite BoJack Horseman episodes this'd be a 6
 
**ktajlili** (8): ending is TENSE
 
**relibee2** (8): it feels like background music to me and it honestly works in its favor.
 
**wavingwolves** (8): the casual misogyny gives this some flavour
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): This doesn't have much replay value for me but this song makes so much sense in the context of the album. And not to be hor knee but I would too like to be that girl having sex with Abel in the studio. Okay that's enough hor knee ness from me.
 
**Flegasaurus** (7.5): we had sex in the studioOo
 
**Iris3271** (7.5): Bella Hadid is quaking
 
**jasannn** (7.5): A great song to simp to.
 
**KennyEarthman** (7.5): we had sex in the studio is iconic
 
**mayolizard** (7.5): kind of drags
 
**seanderlust** (7.3): "hey, Escape From LA! That's the name of the ship from BoJack Horseman! The one that BoJack gets when uh...he's at a low point...it's from the second to last episode of th...hm. This album isn't gonna be happy, is it?"
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): she pulled up to the studio... üòè
 
**hhiggy** (7): always been my least favorite but not bad
 
**intheaftermath** (7): just another L.A. devotee song :/
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7): good but the outro goes on a little long for me
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): love the songwriting and topic of this song
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7): the struggle is real.
 
**vayyiqra** (7): This one verse is very weird in that he can't seem to decide if he wants to be sexist or not but otherwise I like this song.
 
**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): I love the haunting chord progression here
 
**Stryxen** (6.7): me playing the escapists
 
**2dina3dworld** (6.5): the title and the fact it's before Heartless made me think this would be an exciting banger, but meh
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): Could have done without the last two minutes.
 
**bluepupz** (6.5): Damn, this is one toxic relationship lol. I like that he takes us through a journey, and the bridge is the highlight.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Would the Weeknd be one of those people who, when leaving California, published an essay in a paper saying "oh I just hated paying $17 for a salad"
 
**TheCatApologist** (6.5): The outro killed this song
 
**wryn\_** (6.5): one of the shortest 6 minutes of my life
 
**oscarbrierley1** (6.4): too long, kinda boring
[/r/popheads/comments/m8nt34/ultimate_ultimate_rate_reveal_day_1/griv22e/]

=====

akanewasright: # Same work done on their taste, and they criticize
 
**1998tweety** (6): shes cute a bit but i had to take a point off for the keanu reeves mention
 
**camerinian** (6): As far as atmospheric trap goes, it's pretty good, I'm just not that into atmospheric trap
 
**celladonn** (6): I always find this song to be a bit of a slog unfortunately
 
**CHRMbishop** (6): wait a minute, what is he saying?...oh...
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I can't not think of the BoJack Horseman episode when I see this song's title.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): kinda boring
 
**MrSwearword** (6): ambition is definitely there, but it drags on
 
**musical\_pyn** (6): The bridge saves this song from just being snowchild but worse
 
**twistedpython** (6): If this song wasn't nearly as long as it is I would like it a lot more but it just feels unnecessarily long and bloated
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (6): This is just not my type of song, there‚Äôs too little happening for me, and it goes on quite a bit too long.
 
**outsideeyess** (5.6): really slow and I understand why others like it but it's not for me
 
**aladreeladon** (5.5): it's good, but it's... long
 
**hielord** (5.5): Listen, I love long songs, but this feels like a 2 minutes song dragged for 6 minutes.
 
**wasian-invasion** (5.5): Any direction you go from LA is worse though (except Santa Barbara maybe)
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (5): Filler. Good lyrics though.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (5): too long
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5): eh too slow for me
 
**ReallyCreative** (5): this one doesn't do as much for me
 
**pig-serpent** (4.5): There are some interesting rhythmic changes and sound effects thrown into this song but it's not quite enough for me to really like this song.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (4): too atmospheric for me
 
**plastichaxan** (4): zzzzz
 
**bulforster** (3.5): The most disposable song on the album has no business being the second longest.
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3.5): this song drags on too long for me
 
**Bajuko** (3): Unfortunately this drags on too long for me
 
**jimmy345960** (3): Welp, i completely forget this song exists especially when the STACKED second half of after hours really hits.
 
**pat-rickstar** (2): I don't mind long songs as long as they justify their length, this really doesn't
 
**xxrandooxx** (2): take away the singing and it sounds like a song on one of those study song videos with some anime girl on the thumbnail that you would find on youtube.
 
**zagreux** (2): I'm a bit uncomfortable with the subject matter here.
 
**mms82** (1): didn‚Äôt even realize the song changed from snowchild, 10 minutes of boring in the album together
 
**ryjomom** (0): More like Escape from this Song. 6 minutes of nothing salvageable.

**hikkaru** (7.5): I do like this track but I think I have to agree with the lot of people that suggest the album ended after the title track instead, which is an absolute smash. I'll listen to this when I listen through the album and enjoy it well enough, it has some good production just like every other track on the album, but it's not the best ending After Hours could have had and so I'm not surprised nor disappointed to see it get the chop on day 1.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This is a decent closer to the album however after hours being a closer would have been way better. I do really enjoy the atmospheric sound of the song however it‚Äôs underwhelming when the rest of the album is as good as it is.
 
**akanewasright** (6.5): This song isn‚Äôt my favorite, but like‚Ä¶ after the title track, I need a moment to fucking breathe a little. I don‚Äôt usually skip it or anything, I just don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôd play it outside of the context of the album.
 
---
 
# Bleeding love (for this song)
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): because I know this is gonna be one of the first outs but it‚Äôs so good and is the proper end to this album.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): popheads will pay this flawless bop DUST so I will be ranking it high. I love a closer song on an album that sounds like it‚Äôs literally winding down, and this song does it flawlessly.
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (10): amazing closer
 
**mysario** (10): easily top 2 song on the album
 
**seanderlust** (9.3): spongebob voice I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it.
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9): underrated. Trilogy but make it synthier
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): this MV and the lyrics are so heartbreaking lol. i think its a great closer‚Äî it ends the album on such an ominous note but i never really revisit this track on its own
 
**frogaranaman** (9): stunning album closer
 
**MrMoodle** (9): Yep this hits the spot for me
 
**waluigiest** (9): okay dank closer
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): A fitting end to the standard edition
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (8): Kind of boring, but really good lyrics. The chorus rocks.
 
**fishingfor8** (8): I got in an argument with another user about this song. I like it alot more now, I just think it's placed poorly and the album should've ended on After Hours
 
**Iris3271** (8): Gives me Trilogy vibes
 
**noctilucentvibes** (8): every time i listen to this i hear "i don't wanna get high no more" to the tune of show off from the drowsy chaperone
 
**pig-serpent** (8): Oh hey is this a new sound pallete?
 
**ReallyCreative** (8): there's a little video game synth moment that serves me Risk of Rain 2 and we have to appreciate that!
 
**runaway3212** (8): Haunting
 
**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): This is a great closer, love the glitchy instrumental that really feels like a musical representation of bleeding out
 
**SmileAndTears** (7.8): OwO
 
**team\_kockroach** (7.8): gives me 808‚Äôs and Heartbreak vibes, but higher pitched
 
**2dina3dworld** (7.5): it's nice, but it kind of blends into the other songs.
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): I know this is going out early and I kinda get it because its an outro & not super necessary but the production is immaculate
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (7): :5
 
**bbfan132** (7): not the most interesting outro but the production is pretty cool
 
**fallenriot** (7): good on its own but i wish the title track was the closer
 
**nooodisaster** (7): Closing the standard, this works well ending things on a super dark note.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i love how this song builds to a crescendo. pretty solid closer.
 
**wasian-invasion** (7): decent end to the standard album I guess
 
**bluepupz** (6.5): The original closer for the album is similar to the intro in that it's dreamy and gives off a dark atmosphere. It gives off similar feelings as the interlude, in my opinion.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6.5): This is an appropriate closer to the album. But this is a bit slow for me to replay this song when I am not listening to the album in full.
 
**intheaftermath** (6.5): the chiptune is nice, but I wish more happened in this song
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Not really a fan of the vocals here. The instrumental in the second half evolves in a pretty cool way though.
 
**Stryxen** (6.4): spongebob in sandys dome without his water helmet on or something idk
 
# oh god oh fuck please someone help me i'm literally bleeding to death
 
**1998tweety** (6): ok but a meh closer to the standard edition
 
**camerinian** (6): yeahhhhh probably could have just ended the album with the title track
 
**cocosairdep** (6): It‚Äôs a decent closer to the album, the hopeless ending fits the story quite well imo. A bit too minimal production and lyrics wise to stand on its own though.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (6): He kinda lost me with this one. Suddenly there‚Äôs so much going on and none of it goes anywhere.
 
**ktajlili** (6): below average closer. not the worst in this rate though.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6): eh he missed me with this one
 
**wryn\_** (6): i've listened to this album so many times and yet i still have no idea how this song goes
 
**booksandplantsand** (5): okay in my head this is like end credits music i don't really care
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (5): it's just kind of there
 
**KennyEarthman** (5): not a skip, not a like either
 
**moooo566** (5): taking a leaf out of the ariana grande complete guide to enunciation (3rd ed.) here
 
**mythicalbeaste** (5): meh
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5): forgettable
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): when the top hits it a bit too hard
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (5): This just does nothing for me I‚Äôm sorry. It feels less like a song and more like random space sounds.
 
**Awkward\_King** (4.5): ngl i've listened to this like three times trying to rate it and zoned out every time
 
**ryjomom** (4.2): Enunciate, he‚Äôs worse than Ariana Grande
 
**bespectacIed** (4): Filler, BBTM reject
 
**mayolizard** (4): snooze idc
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3.5): maybe I resent this song more than I should because the title track should be the closer...
 
**ManofOranges** (3): As an album closer, it's kind of funny that it's called "Until I Bleed Out" because that's very much how it feels the album is going out. Like you've got all these strong songs on the album and yet this song is the song to close out the album, ending it not with a bang but with a fizzle, slowly bleeding out.
 
**twistedpython** (3): The vocal effects are weird, but in a serial killer way, not a good, kitschy, quirky way
 
**wavingwolves** (3): now what the fuck is that noise around 1:40 and why does it bother me so much
 
**WhyDidEverIBother** (3): pointless, worthless ruins the climax.

**akanewasright** (8.5): I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for this song. I recognize that it isn‚Äôt Gaga‚Äôs best, but I like her voice on a ballad, and this is the most ballad-sounding song on the main album. Anyway, I don‚Äôt disagree with most of the criticism, I just like this song in spite of it.
 
**hikkaru** (8): The thing about Chromatica for me is that I enjoy it all as a consistent listen, but this is one of the tracks that, despite liking a fair bit, I don't really come back to on its own much. I did still give it an 8 so I definitely like it and the "love the paparazzi love the fame" lives in my mind rent free, but I'm okay with it leaving now because it's not really one of the more memorable tracks on the album.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): Another more fillery track on the album, I really like the lyrics on the track but it kind falls flat compared to other songs on here. It‚Äôs good background music though and does fit with the album in a consistent way
 
---
 
# This song is just on fire (these days)
 
**thePotatofairyy** (11): Probably my favorite Gaga song since Bad Romance. That slow verse sounds so hauntingly depressing and is followed by beautiful vocals with simple production followed by continous build of vocals and a great melody with a delivery that makes you feel every ounce of pain. That lack of a drop is gives the song so much replayability. Its fresh, makes sense in context to the song and allows it to continously build. The energy picks up, drums are added. All the elements that make it feel continously growing in grandness. Then the eventual drop feels so damn satisfying with her vocals after really encapsulating that feeling of holding in such depressing thoughts while numbing yourself with "fun". I know its a song about fame but its my go to song for a heartbreak.
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): i'm a sucker for artists referencing their past songs in their music, what can i say?
 
**runaway3212** (10): I think this is the best song on the album, lyrically it works, sonically the drop is really good and it's such a nice change of pace that she sounds like she means what she sings
 
**shhhneak** (10): I‚Äôm a Fun Tonight stan. We‚Äôre out here. We‚Äôre valid.
 
**Tedyonce** (10): sad bop hell yeah
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9.5): this song makes me feel things
 
**nooodisaster** (9.5): By far the most underrated song on this underrated album. Lyrically so good, in a lot of ways this is the thesis of the album: modern Gaga wishing she wasn't famous anymore, and being angry at Fame-Gaga. Production's so good, the way it builds in a rising wave, adding elements until the catharsis of the bridge is divine.
 
**booksandplantsand** (9): i cannot hit a single note but it's so cathartic
 
**camerinian** (9): I really like how the plain spokenness of the title line undercuts the bigness of everything else on the song. It gives this a lot more power and it's a really inspired choice
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This sounded like a break-up song, but I can definitely see Gaga singing this for herself.
 
**ManofOranges** (9): The way I almost cried while I was listening to this song because I was going on one of my very long walks and while I was walking down the street and listening to this song I was in a very depressed mood because I was thinking my career when I get out of college and how I'm probably gonna hate what I'm gonna be and the line "I'm not having fun tonight" just described that feeling in such a simple, but appropriate way.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (9): this album is just fantastic wow wow wow, such a good prechorus
 
**ryjomom** (9): The homosexuals need to treat this song better. The lyrics kill me, but I‚Äôll still dance my ass off this song.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): I really like songs where the sound and lyrics are dissonant. So the fun upbeat tempo clashing with the heartfelt sorrowful lyrics works well for me
 
**TiltControls** (9): Of course the song that'll probably be near the bottom for Chromatica is also one of the few I actually like
 
**team\_kockroach** (8.9): holy shit the post-chorus
 
**aliensexist** (8.5): Too real fam
 
**twistedpython** (8.5): I agree with the sentiment in the titular line a little too much. I'm indeed not having fun tonight.
 
**bespectacIed** (8): Anthem
 
**Brendon-Urine** (8): legendary pre-chorus, but the chorus is just ok.
 
**fallenriot** (8): the lyrics here are so good
 
**lolcevan** (8): i forgot how much of a bop this song is
 
**shesdoingyoga** (8): A lot of songs on this album suffer from not having a real bridge and this is the one that suffers the most
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): I hated this song until I was laying in bed really stoned and I became obsessed with the irony of the title because you think a song called "fun tonight" is gonna be about having fun, but it's actually about how she's never able to let go of her baggage and let herself have fun. The instrumental builds to the postchorus when everything drops out and she finally acknowledges that she's not having fun instead of dancing around it like in the beginning of the song. The references to Paparazzi and The Fame make me think she's talking to her fans about getting burned out and losing herself in the struggle to live up to everyone's expectations of her. I bet you didn't expect to see a comment this long on this song of all songs in the rate. Anyway, 420blazeit
 
**vayyiqra** (8): "I'm not having fun tonight" me when I log onto Popheads and check #general every day despite knowing better. :mischief:
 
**waluigiest** (8): I am also not having fun :-/
 
**wasian-invasion** (8): love her vocals and the buildup to the last section. The lyrics feel like a lived experience
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.7): Also sounds slightly dated. Good symbolism and lyrics though.
 
**mayolizard** (7.7): cute
 
**followingfreeways** (7.5): wait this is really nice..i love how her voice sounds in this
 
**SmileAndTears** (7.5): That pre chorus is sooooo fucking good but then the chorus (if you can even call it that) hits and its just‚Ä¶ bleh. Everything falls apart. The bridge being this repeated millennial whoop is also really disappointing. This could‚Äôve been an excellent song but it feels incomplete. I still like it cuz the pre chorus is so strong but it could‚Äôve been so much better
 
**Roxieloxie** (7.3): why didnt she just make this a ballad
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): depressing af, get a therapist Gaga.
 
**jasannn** (7): This is basically just a little sadder version of Free woman.
 
**jimmy345960** (7): love the fame and paparazzi reference
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): something about the "I stare at the girl in the mirror, she talks to me too" line really hits me
 
**outsideeyess** (7): this feels more Ally in A Star Is Born than Mother Monster
 
**bbfan132** (6.5): it‚Äôs fun enough but doesn‚Äôt do a whole lot for me
 
**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): This is the definition of a deep cut that "only true fans love", but really it's just pretty generic

**\_SoulGlitch** (5): One of the weakest songs of Chromatica.
 
**CarlieScion** (5): thats a mood gaga
 
**cremeebrulee** (5): you know i had this originally as my 0 but /u/runaway3212 actually made some points about the soft drop + the way gaga sings here. i know we were meming around but i really like hearing about why people like songs i dislike + it made me realize there were some redeemable qualities about this song. i mean this is still lower half of chromatica for me but its not 0 quality to me anymore

**fishingfor8** (5): I typically like the slightly slower songs on albums but it's so muted.

**bluepupz** (4.5): It's a "meh", I have no strong feelings about it. I like the end part!
 
**bulforster** (4.5): The melody reminds me of I Won't Say I'm In Love but with how forced the verse rhymes are, a much worse version.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): tbh this kind of slaps! And I genuinely like it better than half of folklore. Maybe I am tasteless.

**akanewasright** (6): This is obviously super cheaply done, but I low-key bop to it. However, as I said earlier, I kind of wanted this to lose the bonus rate entirely, just because of how fucking funny it would be to watch people realize that Macavity actually beat something. Oh well, there are other complete messes incoming

**hikkaru** (3): The only reason this was included in the bonus rate is because Taylor refused to release much of anything as far as remixes, collabs, and loosies go during the folklore era. If only we were rating evermore and could rate the 320948329 versions of willow. Instead, we get to rate this, which went viral on TikTok for... some reason. It's not good. Love Story already isn't one of my favourite singles from her, but this just adds some shitty dance production for whatever reason. Good riddance.

# MARRY ME JULIET

**jledzz** (10): dont ask

**mms82** (10): loved when this was all over TikTok, wish it was on Spotify

**mythicalbeaste** (10): Okay I love this more than the original potentially

**wavingwolves** (10): we love a tiktok hit yas

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): is it stockholm syndrome or is this starting to sound REALLY good

**hunnybee12** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o2sA7ssPzg

**musical\_pyn** (9): now we just need Love Story (Taylor's Version) (Disco Line Remix)

**pheromenos** (9): i feel VERY guilty for picturing the tiktokers dancing during this

**wasian-invasion** (9): lool they play the full version of this at my gym to connect with the youth I guess

**Brendon-Urine** (8): this shouldn't be good but here we are

**ColsonBakerr** (8): the amount of nostalgia behind both the song and the remix

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I hate to admit this, but this remix is actually good?????

**jimmy345960** (8): yas romeo

**moooo566** (8): this is all wrong, but also it's a bop

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8): Kinda better than the original omg

**hielord** (7.8): wait this kinda slaps?

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): okay but where is Love Story (Talyor's Version) (Dancing Witch Version) (Cabin in candelight version) (Disco Lines Remix)

**frogaranaman** (7): okay objectively: not the best remix, the drop genre doesn‚Äôt match the song. but the TREND associated with this????? ICONIC

**ImADudeDuh** (7): her only tiktok hit

**KennyEarthman** (7): good for a fan made remix

**ktajlili** (7): I never cared for the original song but I like this

**thePotatofairyy** (7): I appreciate the audacity of it

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): it's not like bad but the original was perfectly good why do whatever this is i don't get it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): if Taylor moved just a little faster we could‚Äôve just put Love Story (Taylor‚Äôs Version) here instead of using a random TikTok remix but nope. Anyway this nails the buildup on the verses but it fucks up the chorus

**aliensexist** (6): The chipmunk instrumentals don‚Äôt do it for me. Big 2010‚Äôs club music vibes

**jasannn** (6): Cue hip thrusts

**twistedpython** (6): Would've been lower because it butchers the original song but the thought of the swinging penises on Tik Tok redeems this song in my mind

**DaHumanTorch** (5): it‚Äôs awful but gave us a taylor tik tok hit so i‚Äôm here for it

**mayolizard** (5): this has one good part and thats the tiktok part

**nootnoot781** (5): why is there a full hour version?

**NotMajorTom** (5): Wow, this is bad. Are you sure it's an official remix?

**runaway3212** (5): Stream Love Story (Taylor's version)

**TiltControls** (5): This is just the vocals of love story thrown over some generic beat. Also this isn't the same one, but reminds me how the first version of Love story I heard waaaaay back in the summer of '09 was a dance remix

**waluigiest** (5): gotta be honest and say that the remix sucks. But the two drops in the bridge? Iconic

# Baby just say no

**intheaftermath** (4): why is it so generic? :(

**slimboyfriend** (4): The mixing is so off. Why is the percussion so LOUD?

**vayyiqra** (4): That was very pointless and mediocre and I'm not sure why we're rating it here.

**bbfan132** (3): why????

**jayjaysortagay** (3): maybe I just hate fun but the bonus rates are annoying because I have to listen to shit like this

**LeninaCrowne94** (3): I‚Äôm so glad that TikTok didn‚Äôt exist when I was in high school

**ReallyCreative** (3): Finally, a version of this song that isn't mediocre, but instead terrible

**rickikardashian** (3): Love Story - The Blessed Madonna Remix

**thedoctordances1940** (2.5): why?

**AHSWeeknd** (2): why is this here?

**astrologicalangel** (2): whoever made this remix is obviously talented, but this just isn't for me

**celladonn** (2): Nothing against this sort of remix in theory but godddd this sounds so fucking cheap

**fedefreakss** (2): i found the disco lines remix hope it's the right one if not...well

**jsonphile** (2): no...no why does this exist?? I love Taylor and I love disco but the two go together like peanut butter and ketchup also this isn‚Äôt disco

**kirby31200** (2): I haven't heard a club remix this misguided since the remix of Bastille's Oblivion

**pat-rickstar** (2): No

**seanderlust** (2): thanks I hate it

**aladreeladon** (1): this is an absolutely outrageous and blasphemous remix, how dare they ruin one of her best songs,,,,,help

**Bombay\_Mapper** (1): Why does this exist. Like... why?

**booksandplantsand** (1): i hate it. please let me give this a zero

**brenda\_official** (1): not everything needs to be remixed

**cremeebrulee** (1): niki/skar put this in the nu-disco rate challenge

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): DON'T LISTEN TO THIS MONSTROSITY, DO THE 2020 NU-DISCO RATE INSTEAD!!!

**ellezol** (1): i just wanted to listen to the original

**fallenriot** (1): no. absolutely not. idk, after listening to love story for over a decade i really can‚Äôt picture it as anything but a great country-pop song, and this is not it

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (1): NO

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1): not every song needs a tik tok remix üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠‚úã‚úã‚úã‚úã

**ManofOranges** (1): Prison Honey.

**mysario** (1): Surf Mesa and his impact was a mistake

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Everyone dragged this album but like this is a solid remix. It changes the song just enough but keeps the same energy throughout.

**akanewasright** (7.5): I‚Äôm a little mixed on this take on the song, but I think I like it more than I dislike it. I really miss the OG bridge, and Madonna‚Äôs lyric changes are dumb, but I like both of the featured artists (especially Missy), and I kind of actually like the beat now.

**hikkaru** (7): When it was announced that Levitating was going to be receiving single promotion in the form of a music video and a remix with two absolute legends in Madonna and Missy Elliott, everyone was SO excited... and then The Blessed Madonna showed up. The reaction to this track is possibly among the funniest releases I've ever seen in my time on popheads, from the dejected stans to the arguments about what is or isn't "club music" to the stan twitter memes about "The Cursed Madonna" and her own reactions to said memes. I think all that elevates the track for me a bit, actually. But as just a song, it's not my favourite version of Levitating and I do understand the complaints people have about it, but I still think it's pretty alright and works a lot better in the context of the fully-mixed remix album it is a part of. Ultimately though, it finds itself flopping here in the bonus rate, which is not unexpected.

# Knows what a club is

**AHSWeeknd** (10): would‚Äôve been my eleven if it weren‚Äôt for After Hours, Chromatica, Future Nostalgia, folklore, The Cure, or the ASIB songs

**booksandplantsand** (10): this is the superior version

**frogaranaman** (10): unironically better than the original as well

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): http://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/giphy-70.gif?w=480

**jayjaysortagay** (10): this is so good and people fed it crumbs because they were expecting the original with a Madonna verse.

**jexan13** (10): this is good, you hivemind

**MrSwearword** (10): even with the "suck my breasts like Betty Boop" line...this remix did eventually get in my good graces.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): the superior version

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (9.5): YES, this is the levitating remix we deserved missy elliott makes everything better

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): just because it was unexpected doesnt mean its bad!!

**CHRMbishop** (9): "dark pop" vibes

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I feel like I am one of the few people who actually like this remix. I mean, the premise of Club Future Nostalgia is that it's supposed to give this atmosphere of going to a club and this remix gave me that feeling so perfectly. I am going to bet that the Club Future Nostalgia album is going to be looked back favorably in a few years as an underrated remix album.

**MrMoodle** (9): You all suck this is good

**RandomHypnotica** (9): the release thread for this is one of the funniest and saddest of 2020

**skargardin** (9): Let's go!

**Tedyonce** (9): the sole reason this song has a 9 from me is because missy‚Äôs verse pops off so hard

**waluigiest** (9): honestly pretty based

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.9): it grew on me

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): fuck it this song is actually great I love house

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): feels like its missing something but ok

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Missy good, Madonna is sorely underutilized

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8.5): This is good actually.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): It sucks that I have to lower my scores for the bonus rate too. This is an 11.

**LeninaCrowne94** (8): You can do whatever you want to this song and it‚Äôd still be a bop

**bbfan132** (7.5): kind of bops but grew off me

**cocosairdep** (7.5): I don‚Äôt like how they sped it up. Missy‚Äôs verse saves this version imo.

**1998tweety** (7): step down

**astrologicalangel** (7): video is gorgeous but I definitely prefer the original song

**cremeebrulee** (7): it‚Äôs fine the other CFN remixes outsold greatly

**hielord** (7): definitely a grower

**intheaftermath** (7): the vocals are SO GOOD but the instruments are SO SAD

**jasannn** (7): Oh we're rating Levitating 3 times in this rate?

**nooodisaster** (7): Madonna The Blessed Madonna

**slimboyfriend** (7): I didn't know Dua Lipa had stans until I saw them harass The Blessed Madonna for doing what Dua Lipa asked her to do.

**vayyiqra** (7): Cheesy but kind of a slapper.

**wasian-invasion** (7): until the whole remix album came out, I thought dua was just being deferential to madonna

**NotMajorTom** (6.9): This version is so messy

**rickikardashian** (6.8): club future nostalgia was fun because i got to pretend like i could go out to clubs again to be a judgy bitch about what the DJ plays

**seanderlust** (6.8): missy elliott could describe me getting a root canal and i'd love it. loses a couple points or so because after missy's verse i'm tempted to skip.

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it has grown on me a bit since release, but to me, it's missing so much of the heart and spirit that makes the original fun

**deadline4mymemories** (6): so much missed potential

**fallenriot** (6): don‚Äôt love it, don‚Äôt hate it. missy‚Äôs verse is the best part.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I can‚Äôt remember a release that had so much hype followed by so much hatred in r/popheads.

**J\_Toe** (6): the electronic beat at the beginning is better than the bass-heavy sound of the original, but this remix is just too cluttered.

**KennyEarthman** (6): this song just never picks up and it gets boring by the end

**nootnoot781** (6): missy‚Äôs verse ends i skip

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): I don't have any strong feelings, this is probably made for the clubs, but it doesn't feel as dancy as the original

# What is this noise? I only listen to real music like Charli XZY

**celladonn** (4.5): I feel like I would like this more if it wasn't a remix of Levitating because it just strips away so much of what I love about that song

**musical\_pyn** (4): this gets some points because I can see a universe in which this works, but that is not this universe

**mysario** (4): when you gotta write an essay a night before it's due but you only wrote the title and forgot what the material is

**Parabox314** (4): honestly dua really did something bold with club fn but this track just didn't hit for me.

**wavingwolves** (4): the inferior version of levitating

**ellezol** (3.5): i really love missy in this but overall it's just not my vibe :(

**mayolizard** (3.5): this is definitely a song

**jsonphile** (3): I‚Äôm sorry but no I can‚Äôt stand this sound of music. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a boring nerd who‚Äôs never been to a club. Honestly this should be a 1 but okay Missy Elliott is so insanely cool that she saves this song from being absolutely awful

**mythicalbeaste** (3): this was sorta messy

**rslashpoopheads** (3): um hehe everything about this is a mess

**SmileAndTears** (3): Apparently people who like techno/club music like this song/the remix album but I just can‚Äôt get into it

**NFLfreak98** (2.5): No. You don‚Äôt take out the bassline from Levitating. It‚Äôs not even terrible but it‚Äôs down here on principle

**bespectacIed** (2): this is godawful

**relibee2** (2): this is fucking shit I didn‚Äôt remember it being this bad.

**Bombay\_Mapper** (1): It sucks ALL of the soul out from the original and replaces half of Dua's vocals with other random artists. Pass.

**ManofOranges** (1): Sorry but to me this is just a bastardization of the original. Y'all can say all you want that this would go hard in a club, fine, whatever, MAYBE it would. But it just sucks out all of the fun that the original has going for it. It's sped up to a somewhat uncomfortable bpm, the production doesn't have the same levity of the original, and it just doesn't elicit the same euphoria that the original does. I don't think this song is the worst song in the world, but the fact that it's an adaptation of Levitation and doesn't hold a candle to it AT ALL makes it seem so much worse than it actually is.

**runaway3212** (1): wow I still hate this so much

**shhhneak** (1): look how they massacred my girl.

**twistedpython** (1): Blessed Madonna destroyed this album and I cannot condone any of it

**hikkaru** (7): I mean... I love cardigan so I'm okay with this but it is literally just cardigan, again. She wanted that #1 and she was going to make sure she got it. I'm not sure if this is more or less shameless than the willow remixes, because at least Club Willow changed up production instead of just like, removing an instrumental stem and calling it a day. She did get that #1 though so good for her I guess?

**akanewasright** (6): This is mostly just cardigan. Same old song, just stripped back a little. However... it feels like a lot is missing from this version. Obviously that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm used to the fuller production, but Taylor‚Äôs vocal feels almost uncanny without everything else. Still a good song at least

**ignitethephoenix** (1): Like honestly what the fuck is the difference between this and the original??? It sounds the same...I‚Äôm I going insane? Sorry Taylor I hate this cash grab and therefore I will score accordingly as this is a bonus song so idc if I give this a 1 or not

# Capitalists

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i literally don‚Äôt hear a difference???? so i guess i‚Äôll give it the same score as the OG üò≠

**rickikardashian** (10): i think the original cardigan is a 10, this is pretty much the same, so this is also a 10

**TiltControls** (10): honestly I can hardly tell the difference here, but it seems a little more laid back which is a good fit for the song

**1998tweety** (9): not needed

**intheaftermath** (9): cardigan yule log WHEN????

**ktajlili** (9): probably my favorite remix in this bunch

**ManofOranges** (9): Literally what's the difference between this and the regular version of Cardigan?? I'm deducting a point just because I know Taylor made this extra version just to get another stream out of me and I'm mad about it.

**aliensexist** (8): Let‚Äôs be real, there wasn‚Äôt much point in the remixes was there?

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I actually like this but this can go on Day 1.

**jimmy345960** (8): same song lol

**sirpancakeXI** (8): i mean this sound exactly like the original version

**twistedpython** (8): I don't usually seek this out, but if I ever have a migraine this is the best thing ever to listen to

**zagreux** (8): better than the original, i said what i said

**team\_kockroach** (7.8): Docked a point from the original. On principle I don‚Äôt like acoustic versions

**celladonn** (7.5): ...Is this meant to sound different from the original?

**runaway3212** (7.5): I'm giving this 0.5 lower than the original because it's the same song and I'm mad it exists

**shhhneak** (7.5): just smile and nod y‚Äôall

**2dina3dworld** (7): the original verses worked so much better, but the chorus works just as well, if not better

**bbfan132** (7): i mean it‚Äôs fine but it also seems pointless

**cocosairdep** (7): I‚Äôm scoring it the same as the regular version because I can‚Äôt tell the difference lmao.

**cremeebrulee** (7): one less point than the original for the shameless attempt to get a #1

**rslashpoopheads** (7): what's the difference?

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I cannot tell a significant difference between this and the original

**jsonphile** (6.5): I mean thi$ really ha$ no rea$on to exi$t

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): if it ain't a witch version HUH! I'm not interested okurrrr?

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I like this version a little better because some of the production on the original is distracting

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): displays the massive changes a remix needs to get a song to number one

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): its the same picture dot jpeg

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): cardigan is nice but this has no reason to exist‚Ä¶ secure that #1 i guess

**Bombay\_Mapper** (6): I VASTLY prefer the original.

**booksandplantsand** (6): worse.

**J\_Toe** (6): what is the point?

**LeninaCrowne94** (6): Wow, Taylor really tried for that ‚Äòcottagecore‚Äô aesthetic

**SmileAndTears** (6): BUY WILLOW ON ITUNES

**vayyiqra** (6): This is nice I guess but I feel the original was already "cabin in candlelight" enough.

**waluigiest** (6): she was so desperate this era oof

**wasian-invasion** (6): cardigan cabin in capitalist candlelight version

**LesApfels** (5.5): I still have no idea what's supposed to be significantly different from the original

# Corporate asked you to find the difference between this picture and this picture

**fallenriot** (5): are we still pretending this is even a somewhat different song?

**jasannn** (5): Capitalist queen

**jayjaysortagay** (5): this is so stupid, how is it even different than the original. Stream willow (dancing witch version) instead.

**mythicalbeaste** (5): I mean it didn't add much in my opinion

**nahaalne** (5): I legit can't hear a difference between this and the original version, what's the point of this??

**purplechilipepper** (5): what did this add to the original?

**KennyEarthman** (4): guitar is one of the most boring instruments

**pat-rickstar** (4): This was not only totally unnecessary, but also lacks almost all the charm of the original version

**hunnybee12** (3): bts took notes

**vintagebathingsuit** (3): wtf is the difference

**akanewasright** (7): This has grown on me a lot since I first heard it. Like, overall I still think it‚Äôs a cute, forgettable little pop-reggaeton song, but it keeps coming on shuffle for me for some reason, and I like it more each time.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It‚Äôs cute I just wish it was more upbeat. This is an awkward pace and I feel like it could have been better if it was upbeat.

**hikkaru** (5): I'm not the biggest fan of this one, it's not really music I would listen to much and I'm not sure what relevance Dua has here at all. Not surprised to see it place fairly low in the bonus rate.

**mythicalbeaste** (10): this is one of my most streamed of the year. Still on constant rotation.

**ryjomom** (8.5): I love the instrumental

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this song isn‚Äôt that good but it features my lifelong crush and husband benito so we will be raising the score a ton

**hunnybunchesofhoes** (7.5): this is a little empty (?) at points but I absolutely love that this is more in the reggaeton/pop vibe

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): I wish it was a little more upbeat/fun but it still makes me want to go to the beach so I can't be mad

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Quite chill

**cocosairdep** (7): Catchy but a bit repetitive.

**hielord** (6.7): kinda basic ngl

**outsideeyess** (6.6): I love all these artists but this is kinda boring

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I like Dua and Bunny but this is kinda boring tbh

**aliensexist** (6): This song is just so blah

**bbfan132** (6): it‚Äôs ok but it feels so lethargic in a boring way and it‚Äôs also too repetitive

**fedefreakss** (6): it's cute and fun

**KennyEarthman** (6): reggaeton is not for me, but I can appreciate Dua's vocals here

**skargardin** (6): this is nice but pretty forgettable in the grand scheme of things

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I remember when this came out, I thought Calvin Harris was basically going to release Funk Wav Bounce Vol 2 but then this song kind of flopped and nothing ever happened. I remember being a bit disappointed it was a chill bop instead of a banger, but I think it‚Äôs still good. Definitely one of those songs that takes its time to grow on you

**hikkaru** (7.5): These are two of my favourite artists so I was incredibly hyped for a collab, especially after Calvin Harris has been on a bit of a hiatus/doing his side project that isn't really pop, but... ehhhh? I mean it's decent enough and I won't skip it if it comes on but both artists have so much better so it's a shame this isn't that great. It didn't end up smashing on the charts either so hopefully that will inspire Calvin to come up with something a bit more exciting next time.

**akanewasright** (7): Once again, a pretty chill collab from The Weeknd.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): niiiiiceee

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it‚Äôs alright but why didn‚Äôt they name it ‚ÄúKnow That‚Äù?

**bbfan132** (7): pretty good song, i enjoyed the production

**cremeebrulee** (7): kinda mid but i hope this means funk wav bounce 2 is coming

**frogaranaman** (7): not the greatest song but I really dig the music video

**mayolizard** (7): cute ig

**moooo566** (7): not bad, pretty forgettable imo

**rslashpoopheads** (7): chill vibes

**runaway3212** (7): funky

**twistedpython** (7): Meh

**vayyiqra** (7): Using this space to once again state that Daft Punk deserved to win that nu-disco rate not Calvin Harris and also he claims he invented disco but that is a LIE if anyone one person should get credit for that it's Giorgio Moroder.

**cocosairdep** (6.5): Kinda boring ngl. It‚Äôs a shame, this collab had so much potential.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): decent background music, but Calvin and Abel are both capable of way more than this

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): I wasn‚Äôt really a fan of Calvin‚Äôs Funk Wav Bounces thingy and this is practically the same thing and it isn‚Äôt anything special soooo... :/

**team\_kockroach** (6.4): what is this sorry beat?

**jasannn** (6): a vibe but makes me drowsy

# girl, it‚Äôs over now

**static\_int\_husp** (5.5): Calvin Harris making doctor's offic waiting room type beats now?

**booksandplantsand** (5): nothing special here imo

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): Man, this is so sadly underwhelming. What the hell happened to Calvin Harris? I mean, I dislike him to the core but his Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 music is the best work he has done. This isn't doing anything for me at all.

**jexan13** (5): i suddenly can't hear

**Bombay\_Mapper** (4.4): Generic summer music. It's kind of groovy, but still generic.

**fallenriot** (4): this is incredibly boring

**jayjaysortagay** (4): the melody of this is so annoying. The instrumental sounds like TV dating background music

**sirpancakeXI** (3): this is so bad help. the production is not it

**Tedyonce** (2): üí§

**2dina3dworld** (1): why is this a thing

**hikkaru** (9): This is one of my fave non-singles from the album, though I do get the criticisms of it and why it's ultimately ending up as a day 1 cut. The lyrics are a bit surface level and the production is very Kygo-esque which I understand the subreddit userbase isn't really a huge fan of since it's a more generic style of house music. Still, something about this song just really pumps me up, specifically the punchy piano chord buildup with some really infectious melodies leading into the drop. I'm disappointed it's leaving now, but in no way surprised at all.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): A song that‚Äôs definitely more of a filler track, I think it‚Äôs catchy and fun but definitely isn‚Äôt as memorable as some other tracks on this album.
 
**akanewasright** (5): I don‚Äôt *hate* this, but like‚Ä¶ it just feels a little bit lifeless.

# I just think that women-
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): the number of times I have screamed to this in the car....
 
**fallenriot** (10): i love everything about this song, the lyrics, the melody, THE PRECHORUS, and obviously how important it is for gaga.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): BOP
 
**zagreux** (10): I am neither free nor a woman. This song makes me feel like I'm both. Props to Gaga.
 
**ryjomom** (9.3): This is my anthem for when I‚Äôm walking in drag in the downtown of my small town in the middle of nowhere.
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (9): ended men. also i love the "this is my dancefloor i fought for"
 
**mythicalbeaste** (9): I wanna dance in a crowd with people to this!!
 
**thePotatofairyy** (9): She sounds amazing here! Reminds me of drunk nights in weho. The second prechorus/chorus in particular are a lot of fun
 
**vayyiqra** (9): The way she sings "we own the downtown" is so good. (I miss going places.)
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.5): Me in 2022 when i'm fully vaccinated
 
**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): i feel like this is another underrated track, i really like the chorus
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): underrated, pretty danceable
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (8.1): Sounds kind of dated, but I still love it.
 
**bulforster** (8): Yes the production is extremely basic, but Gaga fit her lyrics to it well and is selling it.
 
**intheaftermath** (8): this song plays all the time at my local Bath & Bodyworks and now I can't think of it without thinking of how weird the dessert fragrances are
 
**jasannn** (8): A basic but fun club bop
 
**twistedpython** (8): I love the production on this song but it's nothing special
 
**mayolizard** (7.7): kinda tiring after a bit but ok go girlboss
 
**aliensexist** (7.6): Dancey Dancey
 
**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): I really hate the way she annunciates the word ‚Äúwoman‚Äù here
 
**wasian-invasion** (7.5): The beat drop here's a little weak, but honestly I prefer it over the demo's chorus. Feels less cluttered
 
**Roxieloxie** (7.2): So her enunciation of certain words is gonna be my gripe with this album isnt it
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): free which woman?
 
**bbfan132** (7): i like the message of this song but parts of it are sort of disappointing
 
**bluepupz** (7): She has very earnest delivery during her verses, which tracks with her personality. I think I like the choruses the most.
 
**J\_Toe** (7): the Honey Dijon remix is a 10/10
 
**jimmy345960** (7): good but not that great
 
**nootnoot781** (7): the demo >>>
 
**skargardin** (7): pretty typical eurodance bop, but a bop allthesame
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): These lyrics are pure camp. You get to the end of the songs and you still don't know what Gaga means when she says "Free Woman." Why does she use a triple negative in the pre-chorus? What is her "sound" when she walks "the downtown"? Why is the chorus just her screaming "Free WOMAaAaAaAaAn!!"?
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): enjoyable but the way she pronounces woman rlly irks me
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (7): pretty good.
 
**waluigiest** (7): for whatever reason this song in particular transfers me back to may/June 2020 it‚Äôs already nostalgic
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (7): It‚Äôs okay, but pretty basic as well tbh and the drop doesn‚Äôt really do it for me.
 
**Iris3271** (6.5): Once again Gaga is outshined by the production
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): cute bop. Put it in my bad bitch playlist. That's about it
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): not sure what she was tryna do with these lyrics
 
**wryn\_** (6.5): catchy chorus but pretty uninspired production
 
# [insert Burger King tweet]
 
**camerinian** (6): I always get this and Plastic Doll mixed up in my head
 
**CrimsonROSET** (6): I don‚Äôt know, the beat just.. Sounds like it was taken from another song.
 
**frogaranaman** (6): honestly I really like the production on this song (funky! fresh!) but that‚Äôs about it
 
**hunnybee12** (6): fine but boring
 
**joeeswift** (6): the demo deserved so much better...
 
**mms82** (6): Gaga has a great voice even if this song isn‚Äôt fantastic
 
**MrSwearword** (6): in its original form, I can't. The score you see is for the Honey Dijon remix which adds six to what the song could've been.
 
**nooodisaster** (6): One of the 3 weak tracks on Chromatica. This is Schibes spineless sister. Also, the production when it drops feels too... fast?
 
**xxrandooxx** (6): if only this song was released circa August 18, 1920 during the ratification of the 19th amendment.
 
**runaway3212** (5.5): The verses here a fairly decent, but I don't like chorus. However her voice sounds good here.
 
**seanderlust** (5.5): i love the line "this is my dance floor i fought for." i REALLY wish i liked this more than i do but it's just kind of...fine? idk it doesn't feel memorable
 
**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): this felt so empty to me, bring back ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a free bitch, baby‚Äù
 
**alwayswords** (5): youtuber intro type beat drop
 
**fishingfor8** (5): have no thoughts on this tbh
 
**2dina3dworld** (4.5): Where's the soul
 
**1998tweety** (4): trash
 
**cremeebrulee** (4): this is the BWBB of chromatica change my mind
 
**Flegasaurus** (4): ugh idk its just boring
 
**ReallyCreative** (4): there are hints of something great in here, like La Croux hints, but hints nonetheless
 
**SmileAndTears** (4): I know this song means a lot to her but damn I wish it wasn‚Äôt on the album. Like, that chorus is just‚Ä¶ awful
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (3): I have nothing to sayüòò
 
**ImADudeDuh** (3): this feels so... calculated? Expected? I don‚Äôt know the right word but there‚Äôs just something off about this song
 
**pig-serpent** (3): All of this album's biggest problems are present here, boring synths, bleck melodies, and limp production.
 
**rickikardashian** (3): this sounds like a jess glynne song. i mean that negatively
 
**Stryxen** (3): there's barely anything here to talk about
 
**KennyEarthman** (2): this feels like a corpse compared to the demo
 
**wavingwolves** (2): this song makes me want to be the opposite of a free woman
 
**bespectacIed** (1): Literally royalty free music, I almost expect a makeup tutorial after the drop

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song grew on me a LOT as the rate went on. It‚Äôs just a nice, smooth track that never really gets old. Plus‚Ä¶ Phillip K Dick
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Although I really like the storytelling in this song (although will you actually leave LA? Doubt but I appreciate the sentiment), I hate how one note it is with his sing / rapping and the stripped back production doesn‚Äôt help either. The Philip K Dick line is iconic though my score is a whole 0.5 higher just for that line.
 
**hikkaru** (7): This and Escape from LA kinda occupy the same space in my brain as the bridge from the first 4 tracks that are the non-singles I like a fair bit, and the run of singles that pop tf off and give me that buzz. Unfortunately that bridge is probably the weakest part of the album for me, though I would not call it bad at all. Given by where this and Escape from LA have placed, it seems a lot of y'all agree with me on that, so that's cool!

**WhyDidEverIBother** (9): Hahahahahaha that Phillip K Dick line gives me life.
 
**celladonn** (8.5): "futuristic sex, give her Phillip K dick" makes me smile every time
 
**musical\_pyn** (8): Every song should have the line ‚Äúfuturistic sex, give her Phillip K dick‚Äù
 
**vayyiqra** (8): Unironically a good song with a nice vibe and good lyrics but also a bonus point for "that Philip K. dick".
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (8): philip k dick
 
**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): "Futuristic Sex, give her Phillip K dick" gives me real "my pussy tastes like Pepsi cola" vibes
 
**Iris3271** (7.5): Between the reference to The Morning and the Philip K. Dick line.. iconic
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (7.5): That Philip K. Dick line in the sad voice is the most hilarious thing on this rate. Even more so than Boys Will Be Boys
 
**aliensexist** (7): nice, chill and a little melancholy. Also 'give her Philip K Dick' and 'all my diamonds dancing like they Swazye' - how can I not love?
 
**jasannn** (7): Phillip K. Dick
 
**overscore\_** (7): Gets a point bonus for Phillip K. Dick
 
**shhhneak** (6.5): ‚Äúgive her Philip K Dick‚Äù is the best lyric in this rate.
 
**ellezol** (6.4): extra point for philip k. dick
 
**CHRMbishop** (6): PHILIP K D***
 
**just\_thonking** (6): "Futuristic sex give her Philip K Dick" is an incredible lyric
 
**MrSwearword** (6): jesus fuck this song cuts deep...wait did I hear him say "futuristic sex, give her Phillip K. DICK"...
 
**booksandplantsand** (5): kinda slow and depressing but not in an enjoyable way. idk. but i do like the philip k dick line
 
# Making snow angels and drinking hot cocoa
 
**ColsonBakerr** (10): wow
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): i already know this is going out day 1 and i‚Äôm pre-emptively upset. i love self-reflection songs like this and the MV is such a treat to long time fans. ‚Äúcali was the mission but now i‚Äôm leaving‚Äù is so relatable personally so this is an easy 10 from me
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is definitely one of my top favorite songs on the album. Abel looks back at his life and his career in this hip-hop/pop track that felt like a nice recap to how much Abel progressed, both as a person, as a celebrity, and as an artist.
 
**frogaranaman** (10): one of my favorite album cuts from him ever
 
**ManofOranges** (10): Me when I'm a child made of snow.
 
**Tedyonce** (10): LEEEAVIN....LEEEAVIN INtO THE NIIIGHT....
 
**bbfan132** (9.5): love love love how atmospheric this is
 
**followingfreeways** (9.5): i love the parallel of him saying "she never need a man she what a man need" on this song and then him saying "never need a bitch im what a bitch need" on heartless
 
**runaway3212** (9.5): It's so slow, but it really hits
 
**Alumineous** (9): I've been an XO for the longest time. This feels like a reflection of his life since the beginning of his career and an acknowledgement to his fans. Cali was the mission, and now he's leaving.
 
**fishingfor8** (9): this song probably shows the character development of the weeknd the best. Also the music video is great
 
**hhiggy** (9): underrated
 
**intheaftermath** (9): I don't know how to explain it but this song really nailed the "snowglobe" feeling?
 
**ReallyCreative** (9): gorgeous
 
**Flegasaurus** (8.5): great song but i need to know what the difference between futuristic sex and current sex is
 
**1998tweety** (8): i will be honest this album is a lot better than i remembered it being

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I really like the storytelling in this one
 
**Stryxen** (8): this is a better track 5 than most of taylors
 
**ktajlili** (7.5): love the storytelling
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): this is nice and atmospheric, and lyrically its the Tell Your Friends or Sidewalks of this album (though I like both of those songs better than this)
 
**2dina3dworld** (7): The Weeknd is a child of Father Winter, confirmed.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): way to address the infamous lyrics Abel üò≠
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7): I‚Äôm conflicted on this one a bit, because it sounds lovely‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs a bit shallow? Fame bad songs never really sit well with me. The parts that aren‚Äôt about that I find much easier to sympathize with.
 
**jayjaysortagay** (7): okay, just didn't stand out. Not memorable compared to the album.
 
**skargardin** (7): this is nice but not my favorite on the album
 
**bluepupz** (6.5): I'm sorry, when he talks about futuristic sex I can't not think of Kanye mentioning alien sex in E.T. haha. The lyrics are really personal which I respect, but the overall sound is just okay for me.
 
**fallenriot** (6.5): i think i want to like this song more than i actually do
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the instrumental part needs something more
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): makes me sleepy
 
**mythicalbeaste** (6): really delicate delivery
 
**SmileAndTears** (6): Don‚Äôt really care for this one

akanewasright:  
# Shoveling snow off the driveway
 
**bulforster** (5.9): I appreciate the vulnerability of the first verse and emotion in the refrain but the later verses are very generic fare for Abel.
 
**fedefreakss** (5.5): my least favourite on the album
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (5): The first verse was very good and then the track took a nosedive. Like being sad and horny at the same time is a universal experience, but you can't just go from telling us about your suicidal thoughts and having to live on the streets to bragging about how futuristic your dick is.
 
**KennyEarthman** (5): grabbed my attention at the opening and slowly lost it
 
**oscarbrierley1** (5): if a song could be taken off the album it would be this
 
**sirpancakeXI** (5): feel like his lyric doesn't fit the music, it seems out of place
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): feels a bit too sparse. Abel's rapping is a little shoddy to
 
**twistedpython** (5): I wish this had gotten a real music video because the animated one just doesn't cut it. The drum machine in this song seems very fake and plasticky and doesn't flatter it at all
 
**waluigiest** (5): the lines at the end about the homophobia scandal are sending me
 
**aladreeladon** (4.5): Not feeling this one, ish not for me luv
 
**camerinian** (4): honestly this is the sort of song I was worried the whole album would consist of. I'm really glad to have been proven wrong, but this sort of ambient trap is just a wash for me
 
**moooo566** (4): I don't know why this grated on me, but it really did. I think this is the point where I got really bored of the album's shit.
 
**plastichaxan** (4): zzzzz
 
**ryjomom** (4): Once again I think the production is cute but I'm just not feeling the song at all.
 
**Awkward\_King** (3): this really doesn't work for me i usually like lowkey beats like this but for some reason it grates on me and the lyrics dont feel like... smart? is that too rude to say i just think abel has written much better songs than this
 
**jimmy345960** (3): I like the story and I think thats really important, but like the last track, I cannot remember this when it turns off and I don't really wanna go back to it
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (2): Horrible song really. Instrumental during the chorus is nice though.
 
**xxrandooxx** (2): It felt like a person speaking over a trap beat
 
**zagreux** (1): I don't like how callously he addresses the controversy about the lesbophobic lyrics. He should've issued a proper apology.
 
**Jackalope117** (0): i do not like this
 
**pig-serpent** (0): The drums are too piercing for this chill of a beat and Abel's verse melodies sound pretty bad to me. The chorus is better but there's no hook.
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (0): this gave me a migraine.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Am I one of the only people who thinks this should have been on the main album? Probably. But I think this is a great song even with the 5 foot 2 line (yas Gaga promote your documentary). The chorus hits hard and I love the vocals she has on the song.
 
**akanewasright** (8): This feels like it was written to be one of Ally Maine‚Äôs sellout tracks in A Star Is Born, which of course means that I like it more than most of the album proper.
 
**hikkaru** (7): A deluxe track that really sounds like the album reject it probably was? Yup, here's another one in this rate (at least in my opinion). It's an alright song but I'm not mad that it was cut from the final product of Chromatica, and I'm not mad that it's placing in day 1 of this rate. Stream EXO
 
---
 
# Should have been on the album
 
**Tedyonce** (11): the fact that this isn‚Äôt a single is fucking disgusting,
 
**ColsonBakerr** (10): mannn just wow.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (10): because she made this song for the short girls. but Target really got the best song on the project for what? I‚Äôm offended
 
**MrSwearword** (10): a delightful surprise from the Target version of the album and honestly could've been on the main album.
 
**sirpancakeXI** (10): should have replaced one of the fillers in this album
 
**twistedpython** (10): The fact that this wasn't on the standard album and then wasn't released as the lead single is BAFFLING
 
**waluigiest** (10): I had no idea this existed until I got to this part of the rate. And it‚Äôs so good!?? Her voice is incredible, it‚Äôs a great chorus, the writing is subtle but poignant. It‚Äôs excellent. I see why it was a deluxe track because it doesn‚Äôt mesh with the album as well, but it‚Äôs very good.
 
**zagreux** (10): This sounds like ASIB and Chromatica's lovechild and I'M HERE FOR IT ‚öî
 
**KennyEarthman** (9.5): would be a 10 but it ends too fast
 
**ryjomom** (9.5): Needs to make it to spotify. This is up there with Swimming Pools-Troye Sivan and Never Get to Hold You-CRJ as target exclusive bops.
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (9): WHY IS THIS NOT ON STREAMING
 
**followingfreeways** (9): why is this better than the majority of the actual album?? she made mistakes not putting this on here
 
**joeeswift** (9): please upload this to Spotify @ladygaga
 
**lolcevan** (9): this track gives me very much crj, 5‚Äô2‚Äù tease
 
**Roxieloxie** (9): You know what I can appreciate that this is distinct enough that it doesnt exactly sound like all the other songs on the album
 
**runaway3212** (9): Why wasn't this on the main cut??? It's actually good
 
**shesdoingyoga** (9): Lady Gaga claims to be against homophobia yet commits homophobia by keeping this off of the standard edition and making it too short
 
**whyishestaring** (9): WHY ON EARTH IS THIS A BONUS TRACK?????
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Oh this is definitely a bonus track for sure. But this is really good! I hope Gaga releases this soon on Spotify so I can play this often!
 
**fallenriot** (8.5): i still can‚Äôt believe this was a bonus track, her voice is stunning on this one
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.5): this is a lot cuter than some of the garbaj that made it on here
 
**AHSWeeknd** (8): the end credits to Chromatica roll as this plays
 
**skargardin** (8): clearly a ASIB Ally reject but it's still a great one I think
 
**SmileAndTears** (8): Why was Free Woman on the album and not this...
 
**TiltControls** (8): target hogging the good stuff as usual
 
**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8): She‚Äôs sick for not putting this on the official release.
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): The first minute of this is wonderful, calming vibes.
 
**wavingwolves** (7.5): making this a target exclusive was a mistake miss stefani
 
**aliensexist** (7): Didn't even know about this until reading the rate but ok. The real question is why wasn't it on my Chromatica vinyl that was shipped in a flimsy plastic sleeve? Could they not at least mollify me with a deluxe track? I'm not American and I'm sick of target exclusives
 
**cremeebrulee** (7): never heard this one before and its fine
 
**jasannn** (7): This would have made a good break from constant beat drops throught the last half of the album.
 
**kirby31200** (7): 5'2" gang
 
**ktajlili** (7): just listened to it but I think I like it?
 
**ManofOranges** (7): Ok it's cute. Not revolutionary but I can dig it.
 
**mayolizard** (7): hm ok
 
**moooo566** (7): I've never heard this before, but it's just, fine? In principle I hate Target exclusives because they seem to be a really common thing and my nearest target is ~3200 miles away, but I don't think I was missing much this time.
 
**musical\_pyn** (7): it's fine? the song has a really strong opening and then just kinda goes nowhere
 
**nahaalne** (7): Why is this Target exclusive??
 
**plastichaxan** (7): better than a lot of the album
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): I can't believe Gaga got away with blatantly plagiarizing Ally Maine
 
**vayyiqra** (7): Never heard this before but it's nice and could be a radio hit.
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (7): This has to be a ‚Äúbasic pop song‚Äù reject from A Star Is Born right? Still kinda cute tho
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.8): tbh should've been on the album
 
**bbfan132** (6.5): it‚Äôs ok? i get why it wasn‚Äôt on the album lol
 
**pat-rickstar** (6.5): It's cute. Probably won‚Äôt listen to it again unless she puts it on streaming though
 
# Target can keep it üíñ
 
**wasian-invasion** (6.5): never heard it before this rate but wow wasn‚Äôt expecting the higher registers. Def feels like a bonus track lol
 
**vagenda** (6.1): Not really worth the drive to Target tbh
 
**booksandplantsand** (6): sad that this is a target exclusive! pretty good
 
**camerinian** (6): Girl what the fuck is she saying in that chorus
 
**J\_Toe** (6): I'm glad it's just a bonus track
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6): Leaving this off the album is the correct decision
 
**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): This sounds more like an "Ally" song than a Gaga song
 
**rosecult** (5.6): boring!
 
**bluepupz** (5): To be frank, I'm okay with this being a Target exclusive. Kind of reminds me of a song that could have come from Ally's pop career lol.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (5): this DOES give me big ‚Äòthis is my most emotional album yet‚Äô single and I‚Äôm happy she didn‚Äôt go that route because it doesn‚Äôt sound that good
 
**fedefreakss** (5): didn't know this existed
 
**frogaranaman** (5): THAT 5‚Äô2‚Äù LINE LMFAO
 
**hielord** (5): whelming
 
**Misentro** (5): ...I'm glad this didn't make the album.
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (5): exo outsold
 
**mythicalbeaste** (5): first time hearing it
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5): Gaga's label: Gaga, we signed an exclusive deal with Target for your album. We're worried selling jockstraps to horny mindless gays won't get enough cash. We need to capture that soccer mom demographic!
 
**Stryxen** (5): i thought this was plastic doll again lol
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (5): its fine.
 
**Awkward\_King** (4.5): i hate it but i enjoy it everytime i listen to it what does that mean
 
**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): I see why it's a target exclusive
 
**1998tweety** (4): the verses are decent but good lorde that chorus is one of the worst things gaga has ever shat out
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (4): ASIB reject.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Should have been in the bonus rate, because it's simply dead weight here, I'm glad Gaga didn't include it on the album.
 
**Iris3271** (4): Target can keep it
 
**pig-serpent** (4): Another song with a great Gaga performace and fun melody over a bland instrumental that's pulling all its punches? It's definitely a Chromatica song alright.
 
**ReallyCreative** (4): the bassline and some of Gaga's vocals in the chorus save this from being a complete mess
 
**TheCatApologist** (4): Another song I can‚Äôt remember
 
**Flegasaurus** (3): this is like really boring
 
**letsallpoo** (2): I had no idea this existed and I preferred it that way
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (1.5): this is so bad it has me cackling she really had to say 5 foot 2 again

**hikkaru** (6.5): This is kind of a weird place to leave the album imo, I guess just because I prefer when albums end on a high note and this just ends folklore on... a note. It's okay but it's not super interesting and I'm not surprised it's one of Taylor's early cuts.
 
**akanewasright** (5): Honestly I don‚Äôt hate this song, but it reminds me of that time someone decided that 1. The relationship depicted in the song was SUPER toxic 2. That it was OBVIOUSLY about Taylor and Joe, despite‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ everything in the promo campaign for the album, and 3. That it was so sad to see that Joe and Taylor‚Äôs relationship is so broken after all of those gorgeous love songs over the past three albums. Anyway, stream Fake Friends by Shannon Strucci on YouTube, it‚Äôs so close to 200k views
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): This is a decent song but I feel like Taylor could have taken this a different direction. I love the line ‚Äúyour faithless love is the only hoax I believe in‚Äù and the bridge melody but again Taylor does this piano riff that‚Äôs getting stale at this point.
 
---
 
# "guys its okay the Doja Cat stuff was all faked"
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (10): Very good ending to the album that definitely does not deserve all the hate it gets.
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): somehow after like 3 duds, this album gives a hell of a closer. the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want no other shade of blue but you‚Äù line absolutely killer
 
**lillipup03** (10): This song hits completely differently when you‚Äôre riding in a car during a thunderstorm...
 
**shesdoingyoga** (10): This deserves so much better than going out day 1 but I sadly don‚Äôt see it going too far
 
**sirpancakeXI** (10): a cute closing track if we ignore the lakes
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): HOAX RIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK YOU /u/imadudeduh
 
**camerinian** (9.5): kinda brutal to put this straight after peace, but like other than that, this is a great late night depression walk soundtrack
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): I loooove the melody at the end of each stanza
 
**booksandplantsand** (9): this was lowkey so well written I thought she dropped Joe for a second
 
**CarlieScion** (9): i dont understand why this was the outro and not peace but sure
 
**CrimsonROSET** (9): This is the one where the wording really struck with me, for some reason.
 
**deadline4mymemories** (9): this will leave on the first round of reveals and it doesn't deserve to
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (9): This is a really good closer! It's quite slow, so the peaceful and airy instrumental fully blossoms here.
 
**fallenriot** (9): this is one of taylor‚Äôs most interesting tracks, she‚Äôs never really made a song like this before, or ended an album on this type of note (at least not before this)
 
**followingfreeways** (9): this is way overhated:( this is a beautiful ballad. also, i love pain and apparently so does taylor. i think this is a really lovely closer (the lakes who??) and the lyrics paint a really sad but compelling story. that bridge makes me want to cry like a baby for real.
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (9): love the piano here
 
**bbfan132** (8.5): very pretty outro, i like how stripped down it is
 
**mayolizard** (8.2): cute
 
**1998tweety** (8): this had to grow on me but its good now
 
**ColsonBakerr** (8): the song might not sonically be my favourite but that damn lyricism. And again, her vocals are so good.
 
**jasannn** (8): STOOD ON THE CLIFFSIDE SCREAMING GIVE ME A REASON
 
**overscore\_** (8): Sweet it's actually the last song on the album OH NO THERE'S A BONUS
 
**pietrohonkhonk** (8): Another underrated song. It‚Äôs just so heartbreaking and a better ending to the album than the lakes, in my opinion
 
**skargardin** (8): another great song that will be an early out and for what
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I liked the way this song left the album unresolved
 
**Stryxen** (7.5): girl get help
 
**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): oh like what the woodvale rumors were
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): breathtaking
 
**ktajlili** (7): again very quiet. It's a beautiful song but I definitely prefer Evermore as a closer.
 
**rickikardashian** (7): can‚Äôt believe taylor just made a song calling covid 19 a hoax created so biden won the presidency
 
**SmileAndTears** (7): uwu
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): this is Taylor embracing her indie side (i.e. making songs I do not have strong feelings on)
 
**waluigiest** (7): I have never thought about this song while not actively listening to it
 
**wavingwolves** (7): cute!!!!!!
 
**ReallyCreative** (6.4): folklore is actually a hoax perpetuated by mindless Swifties and mainstream media in order to control us, it's about control. No one is actually streaming or purchasing 23 different versions of a Taylor Swift album, it's all manufactured to get you to fall under her influence!
 
**seanderlust** (6.4): idk it's just fine
 
# [insert COVID denial here]
 
**bluepupz** (6): This reminds me of The 1, sound-wise. I feel like she's covered this topic before.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Most Taylor's closing songs end on a positive note. This song is an exemption as it ended in a very grim note. Concept-wise, this is a nice switch. But I always have a hard time playing this on repeat because this song is a bit slower than to my liking. But hey, this is still a good closing song nonetheless!
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6): i wonder what taylors phone password is lol, but this is fr kinda boring like peace but has more redeemable qualities like being a better song
 
**musical\_pyn** (6): should have ended with peace
 
**mythicalbeaste** (6): I just listened and I still don't know what this song sounds like
 
**pat-rickstar** (6): It's a shame that the album's worst songs are all at the end. This is just ok
 
**pig-serpent** (6): Nice melody and I like the music box feel.
 
**runaway3212** (6): This isn't a miss, but it's definitly my least favourite on the main album
 
**twistedpython** (6): Boring
 
**2dina3dworld** (5.5): okay but standing on a cliff side screaming sounds very therapeutic
 
**intheaftermath** (5.5): in retrospect, it feels like a less polished, toned-down version of willow. This has always been the weakest track for me
 
**frogaranaman** (5): bland note to end the album on
 
**KennyEarthman** (5): good studying background music
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5): blah
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): Taylor's recent tradition of ending the album with a boring and safe piano ballad is slowing getting grating. I want another New Romantics or Long Live ending.
 
**wasian-invasion** (4.5): someone spraypainted hoax on the floor of my subway station and I was gonna post it on r/popheadscirclejerk like haha taylor's really dropping easter eggs everywhere but I never did
 
**Awkward\_King** (4): i dont HATE it i just cannot remember this song after every time i listen to it it just has no memorable qualities to me
 
**nooodisaster** (3): Hoe, why is you here? This just always felt so pointless to me, it adds nothing, it's boring, lyrically it's average, just an all around terrible closure. Strong 0 candidate.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): i feel like i still don't have an opinion on this song nearly a year later. it's just there and drags on
 
**team\_kockroach** (2.3): sounds seriously unfinished
 
**relibee2** (2.2): you guys clown on ME! when this exists? at least ME! is fun. This is just so... boring.
 
**bespectacIed** (2): she's not slick for putting cardigan twice on the album thinking no ones gonna notice
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): to the people saying this is their favorite song on the album, i literally do not believe you. i'm not saying you're wrong, i'm saying i literally do not believe you.
 
**MrSwearword** (2): this is just so pointlessly dour
 
**ryjomom** (1): skip, next album sweetie, next album
 
**outsideeyess** (0): the instruments on this album are fairly well produced, but i just can't stand her vocal tone

**hikkaru** (8.5): The outro is a bit of a contentious topic among pop fans, but personally I'm a big fan. While I am a lot higher on Chromatica than a lot of people I think she could have stood to experiment with production a tad more, and that happens a bit here which is pretty cool. Elton is also fine on this track though I know some people don't like his presence here, so those things combined make it fairly controversial. I honestly thought it would do a bit better in this rate but I'm also not too surprised that it's getting the boot early.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I really enjoy the lyrics on this song and I think Gaga and Elton have good vocal chemistry but there‚Äôs something missing from this that makes it an amazing song. Also the ending is just really random, there was potential there but they never did anything with it
 
**akanewasright** (6): I like parts of this song. I like the ending and I think Chromatica III might be the best interlude on its own merits, but the chorus is kind of laughable, and it‚Äôs kind of shocking how bad Elton sounds here. 
 
---
 
# I saw the sine, and it opened up my eyes and I am happy now
 
**veryanniev** (11): This song is a religious experience
 
**celladonn** (10): An idiosyncratic opinion perhaps but this has always been my favourite on the album. Deliriously over the top in the best way.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The breakdowns in this are ecstatic. Love the theme of finding escapism and coping mechanisms in music. Gaga and Elton work together surprisingly well too, what's not to love?
 
**fallenriot** (10): act 3 is the absolute best part of this album and i will die on this hill. this song is a fantastic duet
 
**J\_Toe** (10): this song sounds the most like the promo images released in the booklet for this album. The pink, alien looking Gaga peering around a cliff face under a turbulent stormy sky. Perfect! (though I prefer Elton on ARTPOP)
 
**PointlessBibliophage** (10): queen of trigonometry, hipparchus of nicaea who?
 
**shesdoingyoga** (10): I still get chills every time I listen to this, it‚Äôs just something about her voice on the chorus
 
**static\_int\_husp** (10): Honestly believe that Gaga secretly recorded Elton rambling at a dinner party and made that his verse. Also the drum and bass outro fucking slaps.
 
**plastichaxan** (9.3): maybe this high rating is for the last 30 seconds of it and what about it
 
**AHSWeeknd** (9): she really said imma put Elton on a dance song and y‚Äôall will have to deal
 
**Brendon-Urine** (9): I love how both Gaga and Elton John sound on this, separately and together. It also took me until this rate to realize my 3 favorite Chromatica songs are the 3 songs after the interludes.
 
**nooodisaster** (9): My fav Chromatica interlude actually, and SFA is just gorgeous. The VOCALLLLSSSS; Elton and Gaga pair so well and both bring it hard. The imagery here is lovely and some of the deepest on Chromatica, which is saying a lot. Also, people complaining about the electro breakdown in a LADY GAGA album??? It has to be cocaine.
 
**skargardin** (9): this works way better than it has any right to
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (9): , again all for that divine vibe
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): this has shrunk on me but its still nice
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8.5): The orchestra interludes are really the glue holding this album together for me.
 
**mysario** (8.5): perfect club banger probably
 
**ryjomom** (8.5): Transition the haus. Mathematical genius. Sound engineer. The guest. Galileo astronomer.
 
**vagenda** (8.4): There‚Äôs no justification for this having 14 writers but ok, work
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8.2): the advert that gaga is in kinda ruined this song for me but is still a bop
 
**xxrandooxx** (8.2): its the creativity and gay rights for me
 
**\_SoulGlitch** (8): I didn't expect her collab with Elton to go this hard.
 
**camerinian** (8): That breakbeat collapse at the end is a hell of a moment.
 
**frogaranaman** (8): their voices work ridiculously well together
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): kind of living for this 'feuded with madonna' collab
 
**musical\_pyn** (8): I wish more songs on the album sounded like this (especially the ending)
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8): sir elton bodied this
 
**SmileAndTears** (8): Not to be misandrist but this would‚Äôve been 100x times better with Cher
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8): This is so cheesy and Elton's vocals are truly tragic, but for some reason I like it.
 
**twistedpython** (8): Elton worked a lot better on this song than I thought he would and the instrumentation is pleasing
 
**vayyiqra** (8): This is kind of a hot take but the drum'n'bass breakdown at the end isn't the best part I think, it's when Elton comes in and then they duet after that. [That part still does absolutely fuck though don't get me wrong]
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (8): This song feels like it was written as a Eurovision parody, but luckily I‚Äôm obsessed with Eurovision. I think the ending is pretty cool as well.
 
**pheromenos** (7.8): would have been a 9 without the awful outro
 
**team\_kockroach** (7.6): lyrical concept needs some work. I bet this would make a killer music video, though
 
**engifear** (7.5): The ending brings it down a bit
 
**ktajlili** (7.5): hated this one but it's grown on me a lot.
 
**mayolizard** (7.5): hm
 
**whyishestaring** (7.5): Is it mean if I say the chromaticas are the highlights of this album??
 
**outsideeyess** (7.3): the drop is kinda boring
 
**ColsonBakerr** (7): if this song came out in 2010 it would've been a SMASHH
 
**Flegasaurus** (7): um its very all over the place i don't know if its good or bad... i've decided i like the outro even if it is oddly tacked on
 
**MrSwearword** (7): the interlude does the heavy work considering SFA can only do so much despite Axwell not being so useful here. Sir Elton by the way sounds fine, so commenters lay off him.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (7): not too memorable
 
**Roxieloxie** (7): points for the transitions i guess
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): whew this is melodramatic
 
**sarcasticsobs** (7): this is so EDC it hurts
 
**Tedyonce** (7): Elton John lowkey pops off idc idc
 
**waluigiest** (7): there are a few lit parts but otherwise I‚Äôm yawning
 
**WhyDidEverIBother** (7): This is the 2nd best use of Elton John of anything in this rate, but still fun.
 
**aliensexist** (6.9): I'm not sure tbh
 
**cremeebrulee** (6.5): interesting concept but the execution isn‚Äôt there for me. i added a .5 bc that outro is crazy + i wish the whole song was like that
 
**shhhneak** (6.5): In an album full of Eurovision semi-final rejects this is the most Eurovision-y. I still can‚Äôt decide if that‚Äôs good or bad.
 
**thePotatofairyy** (6.5): The weakest interlude. Sine is just fine. It reminds me of subspace emissary in smash bros brawl for some reason.
 
**seanderlust** (6.4): Chromatica III is transcendant - makes me think i'm in a fantasy movie. sine from above is....well I liked gaga's part. elton's feature here is weird, and the d+b outro just serves to hint that this track could have been way more interesting than it is.

akanewasright: # I failed trigonometry 3 times Gaga, don't fucking taunt me like this
 
**jexan13** (6): The drop is so trashy and generic
 
**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (6): Elton and Gaga sound like they sang over two different tracks and then someone who doesn't know how to work ProTools assembled it because it was due the next day and he had to submit the assignment or risk failing.
 
**wasian-invasion** (6): now THIS feels dated. Everything else on chromatica is cutting edge in comparison
 
**wavingwolves** (6): at least it sounds different from the rest of the album so props to that
 
**wryn\_** (6): it's pretty great but that drum and bass breakdown is so weak and unasked for
 
**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): why the fuck does this song have 13 credited writers
 
**runaway3212** (5.6): I'm giving this a passing score because the interlude is pretty and Elton is a legend, but I don't love it
 
**bbfan132** (5.5): don‚Äôt like elton here at all but i love the breakbeat outro so
 
**KennyEarthman** (5.5): transition is meh, Sine From Above's ending is... a choice
 
**2dina3dworld** (5): Elton John sounds like he's enjoying himself
 
**bluepupz** (5): My least favorite collab on the album. It's okay I guess? I'm used to the fast ending by now, but I was pretty taken back when I first heard it.
 
**booksandplantsand** (5): a gaga/elton collab should not sound this mediocre
 
**CrimsonROSET** (5): Elton John sweetie.
 
**intheaftermath** (5): mr. elton john I'm so sorry... I just don't think their voices work well together on this and it's jarring
 
**jayjaysortagay** (5): I saw the Sine and I fucking closed my eyes
 
**lolcevan** (5): sine from above reeks of 2011 to me
 
**pig-serpent** (5): The drop on this song sounds cool but it doesn't hit right because none of the drops on this album do. The rest of the song is kinda boring, and Elton John sounds pretty bad on here. You know what would be cool? If the whole song was breakbeat and not just the ending.
 
**Iris3271** (4.5): Only kept getting worse
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): throwback to when people were afraid this was gonna be a ballad
 
**ReallyCreative** (4): I liked this when it first came out but eventually I realized there's no substance here
 
**slimboyfriend** (4): I like Chromatica III, but Elton John sounds like he's fallen and he can't get up in SFA. It's pretty generic EDM until the very end of the breakdown at the very end of the song
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (3): A generic club song. Filler. Also I dislike Elton John's voice.
 
**followingfreeways** (3): this was just not good and elton john's voice sounded sooo jarring
 
**ManofOranges** (3): Sorry to Elton John and Trigonometry enthusiasts everywhere but, while it's not awful, this song is serving sin(pi) because it does 0 things for me.
 
**rickikardashian** (3): if i was on a gay bar, not paying much attention to the music, drunk as shit, and very disorientated, it would bop hard to this
 
**sirpancakeXI** (3): i kinda like the way they sing together but it is just bland, and what exactly happened in the outro.
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): srry but imagine getting elton john on a song and having it be this boring and unoriginal
 
**Stryxen** (2.5): skip from above
 
**CarlieScion** (2): what even IS this. how did she make elton john BE BAD
 
**imasalesman** (2): This random man ruined the song sorry
 
**MrMoodle** (2): The main instrument thingy in the chorus is some super bland EDM sounding shit but also sounds really grating in a way you wouldn‚Äôt expect something so generic to be? It sounds like something Marshmello would make except instead of trying to be inoffensive like usual he‚Äôs actively trying to make something deeply unpleasant
 
**bespectacIed** (1): get this hag off my ear, I am NOT listening to that
 
**mms82** (1): oi this is all over the place and none of it is good
 
**cocosairdep** (0): I don‚Äôt like how Elton sounds at all, I‚Äôm sorry, it totally ruins it for me.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): My favorite of the bonus tracks (and also in my top half of songs from the album), I love the production, vocals and rhythm of the song. I always thought the production was sampled from something in Lala Land but, but spoiler it‚Äôs not, but it heavily reminds me of some of the songs in the movie for some reasons.
 
**akanewasright** (8): This being the top rated Weeknd bonus track was predicable, but it‚Äôs probably the song from the Deluxe album that sounds the most like classic Abel
 
**hikkaru** (6): I will write the same thing for all of these After Hours deluxe tracks: it is VERY easy to see why they are deluxe tracks. Some albums hide hidden gems there, but not this one. They're not horrible or even bad in my opinion, but I don't really have any reason to listen to the deluxe album at all because they're just kinda there.
 
---
 
#  Nothing compares to how good it is, I guess
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this deserved to be on the standard album! it‚Äôs the same synthpop perfection as BL/INE/SYT so i‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre including it in the main rate
 
**runaway3212** (10): Stream Nothing Can Compare by Agnes
 
**ChandelierFlickering** (9.4): the bonus tracks are very good
 
**2dina3dworld** (9): it sounds very crunchy and compressed, which works super well
 
**jasannn** (9): that synth line is everything. It is a great mix of the heavily proccessed parts of the first half of the album and the poppier parts of the second half.
 
**skargardin** (9): this is def the standout of the bonus tracks
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i feel like this could have fit very well into the "regular" album but w/e
 
**twistedpython** (9): The synths in this song are pretty. They make me feel like I'm being abducted by aliens, which is always an aesthetic I can get behind
 
**1998tweety** (8.5): this is GOOD, should NOT have been a bonus track
 
**Flegasaurus** (8.5): i didn't realize we were gonna rate the bonus tracks too
 
**MrMoodle** (8.5): I fucking hate deluxe albums like I‚Äôm out here full on micromanaging my Last.FM profile but here comes a deluxe and now I have to end up praying the deluxe tracks are shit so my scrobbles don‚Äôt get divided across albums but this ended up being good which just annoys me so much
 
**pat-rickstar** (8.5): The bonus tracks took a while to grow on me but they're actually pretty solid.
 
**fishingfor8** (8): not a huge fan of the deluxe edition tracks but this one should've made the album
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (8): This song doesn‚Äôt go with AH, it makes sense it wasn‚Äôt on the OG, but I‚Äôm a fan of this song. It‚Äôs bouncy, sticky, and grandiose like a lot of his prior work.
 
**ManofOranges** (8): Sinead O'Connor type beat.
 
**seanderlust** (8): I try my best to not get high again (Oh, baby, I can't get high again) / But I've been stuck inside this place for days on end (La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da) - quarantine tingz
 
**Tedyonce** (8): wait this goes off but I already know it‚Äôll be done dirty so whatever
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (7.5): Good. Grew on me after a few listens.
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): I remember listening to this in the first time and I didn't like it at first. But this definitely grew on me now.
 
**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): This is nice but I can see why it‚Äôs a bonus track
 
**wasian-invasion** (7.5): how have I never listened to these tracks before
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): doesn‚Äôt compare to the rest of the album
 
**bbfan132** (7): the production is nice but it‚Äôs definitely a b-side
 
**bluepupz** (7): I'm a fan of the guitar, it gives it some oomph to complement his singing. Plus, extra points in my heart for being a bonus track that sounds like it could still come from the same album.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7): Eh, could‚Äôve been cut.
 
**frogaranaman** (7): I get why this was left off the album but it still is good
 
**mayolizard** (7): somethings missing i think
 
**mythicalbeaste** (7): ok
 
**pig-serpent** (7): I'm a sucker for slow songs with wild guitar parts in the background. This song also has a strong sense of momentum.
 
**ReallyCreative** (7): we love a Stellaris bonus track
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): I honestly haven't bothered to listen to the bonus tracks on this album before this rate and it seems like that was an ok decision
 
# Nothing Compares to how much it sucks, I guess
 
**KennyEarthman** (6.5): a bop but it's just Scared To Live lite
 
**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Eh
 
**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): Stream Nothing Can Compare by Agnes
 
**Awkward\_King** (6): if the agnes song isn't the interlude im gonna be PISSED but its gonna be sinead o conner isnt it
 
**ktajlili** (6): idk all the bonus songs are kind of forgettable to me
 
**musical\_pyn** (6): okay but I definitely see why this is a bonus track
 
**nooodisaster** (6): Yep, this is a bonus track.
 
**ryjomom** (6): It‚Äôs a mood and vibe
 
**Stryxen** (6): i‚Äôve run out of opinions
 
**camerinian** (5.5): Yeah I can see why this was left as a bonus track. It sure is a Weeknd song. Like the guitar sizzle tho
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): the guitar is nice but it's too slow jammy
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (5): now we get to the filler yass
 
**rslashpoopheads** (5): forgettable
 
**wavingwolves** (5): there's definitely a reason why this is a bonus track
 
**wryn\_** (5): i think the deluxe songs should have stayed deluxe songs tbh

**givebackmysweatshirt** (3): going to pretend as if there are no bonus tracks on an otherwise flawless album

**akanewasright** (6.5): This song feels like it could go somewhere, but it never does, which is deeply frustrating. Shake It Off had more effective build than this song.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): This song is okay, it was one of my favorites probably because Taylor drops a lovely ‚Äúfuck‚Äù on this song, but the production sounds like a poor mans Cardigan (which is another song where the piano riff annoys me a bit). There‚Äôs some great lyrics on this for sure but at this point in the album, Taylor has to give me more than just great lyrics.
 
**hikkaru** (6): I really love folklore up until this track. The lyrics and message are fine but it's around this point that sonically I get a bit bored, especially since these sort of tracks are all placed near the end of the album. I still look forward to the BANGER that is Betty but this is just a fine song for me, not one of my favourites at all.

# Taylor said BLOWJOB RIGHTS
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): I‚Äôm surprised people don‚Äôt like this, she‚Äôs spilling
 
**LeninaCrowne94** (10): Flashback to when my dad told me that my goal in therapy should be to ‚Äòforgive him‚Äô
 
**moooo566** (10): There's more genuine passion about the way she's treated in this one song than her entire reputation era
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): The Man really couldn't
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is what The Man wanted to be
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): let's eat grandma walked so mouth fuck you could run
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9): "or does she mouth FUCK you forever?" need I say more??
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is Taylor being angry as fuck at the patriarchy and I am here for it. To hear sing "fuck you" is just everything.
 
**fallenriot** (9): i‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of comments about the mouth fuck line, but what makes this song for me is all the animal imagery - scorpions and bears both work really well in the narrative.
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (9): i love this song, but when people try to take a deep analytical dive into every lyric like scooter braun this kimye that. shut up swifty and enjoy the song.
 
**NotMajorTom** (8.7): If this song has a bad rating, it's JB's and Kanye's fans fault.
 
**2dina3dworld** (8.5): is it wrong I can relate to this whole song
 
**Hogwartsreject1912** (8.5): SHE SAID IT GUYS SHE SAID FUCK!!!
 
**jsonphile** (8.5): well it‚Äôs certainly better than ‚ÄúThe Man‚Äù
 
**mayolizard** (8.5): a bit generic i fear but still great
 
**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I remember listening to this live on the Discord the night this came out and people erupting with "Taylor just said fuck!"
 
**vagenda** (8.4): This song is retroactively about Ginny & Georgia
 
**aliensexist** (8): Deliciously smooth
 
**bbfan132** (8): the lyrics carry this for me
 
**cremeebrulee** (8): this is overhated maybe i like it because it feels like a grown version of a reputation song
 
**pig-serpent** (8): The piano and atmosphere of this song are great and It's amazing how subtley threatening this song is.
 
**runaway3212** (8): Taylor finally rates a version of better than revenge you can enjoy wit feminist brain turned on
 
**Tedyonce** (8): my mom loves this song
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): "Wanting me dead has really brought you two together." This is where my Jack Antonoff hack side comes out, because the lyrics here are probably as good as Illicit Affairs but I just find Aaron's production way more boring.
 
**TiltControls** (7.5): I used to like this one a lot more than I do now
 
**twistedpython** (7.5): Would be lower since I don't listen to this song hardly at all but I live for the flaying alive of Scott, Scooter, and Yael so it gets bonus points
 
**whyishestaring** (7.5): This song has the lowest rating on folklore for me. I know what vibe she was going for, but for a revenge song it sounds kind of boring.
 
**1998tweety** (7): shes cute
 
**camerinian** (7): The way the groove builds up is something wonderful, I just don't really feel like the narrative builds in the same way. Like, she literally does stay mad
 
**KennyEarthman** (7): Taylor saying woman in a deep voice gave me life
 
**ManofOranges** (7): Taylor was at her lowest. Fat, nasty, broke, career in shambles. She came on this bitch mad as hell!!!
 
**musical\_pyn** (7): still better than 3/4 of reputation
 
**plastichaxan** (7): way better than i remember
 
**purplechilipepper** (7): the verses are incredible but the first four lines of the chorus are super clunky and really ruin the mood for me tbh
 
**rslashpoopheads** (7): üÖ±Ô∏èad woman

**vintagebathingsuit** (7): get em taylor
 
**waluigiest** (7): my tears ricochet but not as good
 
**WillamThunderfuck** (7): At this point of the album I always get kinda bored, just because the first half is so much better in my opinion and it all starts to feel kind of similar to each other.
 
**wryn\_** (7): i'm in need for more songs about female agents of patriarchy

akanewasright: # Why doesn't the song sound madder though?
 
**thePotatofairyy** (6.8): I appreciate the meaning but its not something I'd go back to
 
**Awkward\_King** (6.5): okay but i HATE the lyric "fuck you forever" WHO SAYS FUCK YOU FOREVER ??????????????????????
 
**bluepupz** (6.5): Ah, she says fuck here too, I was shocked lol. Sonically, it's not my favorite but I respect how calm mad she is over her masters here.
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (6): The Man's older, better sister.
 
**CrimsonROSET** (6): so this is a response to kimye right? Like she says it isn‚Äôt, but- it totally is, right? LET IT DIE WOMAN.
 
**Flegasaurus** (6): omG not the fuck word 1! 11 ! !1 !!
 
**jackisboredtoday** (6): insert ‚Äúmouth fuck you forever‚Äù joke here
 
**MrSwearword** (6): it's going for quiet storm mad, but it's more quiet than storm
 
**mythicalbeaste** (6): Album starts to blend at this point
 
**noctilucentvibes** (6): i'm really resisting the urge to write a diatribe about how my feelings on taylors use of "mad" in this album & you're all welcome
 
**rickikardashian** (6): this is less *mad woman* and more *‚Äùsilently angry coworker that you will only find out she was bothered when she sends you a very loaded email‚Äù* woman
 
**Roxieloxie** (6): this would be the second song on the uquiz question about what song makes you go feral. This isnt even mad woman, this fuck you was so soft it could be played on the radio and no one would flag it. This should be a Haley Williams type of angry banger or at the very least have more energy, blank space is literally angrier than this
 
**skargardin** (6): I don't really return or think about this that much, it's fine
 
**wasian-invasion** (6): taylor gets a point for fuck. Now all she needs is the other f word
 
**wavingwolves** (6): this is lowkey the worst song in both folklore and evermore (and yes it's still a positive score, her power). edit: no actually the lakes is my the worst one and it has a score under 6
 
**booksandplantsand** (5): we get it you're a victimized capitalist queen
 
**CarlieScion** (5): eh
 
**frogaranaman** (5): this one goes right out to my crazy bitches in The Favourite directed by Yargos Lanthimos, y‚Äôall insane but I fuck with it
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): I get that she is pissed off at Scooter, but the verses are just hilariously petty. Not a good look on someone so mature and successful.
 
**MrMoodle** (4.5): I cannot fucking stand the Swifties on Genius saying that literally every song Taylor ever writes is about Scooter Braun. Aside from that, usually I think Taylor's attempts at explicitly feminist songs fall super flat but she reigned herself in here which is good. I kept expecting her to say something cheesy like "and they say she'd be prettier if she smiled more" or something forced about mansplaining but luckily we didn‚Äôt go down the Boys Will Be Boys route here. But despite that, the song still kinda sounds like shit.
 
**Brendon-Urine** (4): the album reaaallyyy slows down for me here. obviously Betty is great but other than the second half is a lil dry.
 
**ryjomom** (4): should‚Äôve just called it witch, maybe i would‚Äôve like it, needed more drums and synth
 
**slimboyfriend** (4): The songwriting is too melodramatic and I can't stand this instrumental
 
**bespectacIed** (2): girlboss gatekeep gaslight
 
**followingfreeways** (2): this just is not good. i skip this everytime. the chorus has a nice melody but that's it. the lyrics and the darkness of the piano just..like i know what she was going for, i get it, but this doesn't do what she thought it would, at least not for me.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (1.5): This chorus on this is just really weak and not emotive enough and it makes the song boring to me.

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song simply makes me happy. It just feels so soothing to me. There was never any doubt to me that this would leave day 1, but I'm still sad to see it go.
 
**hikkaru** (6): It's at this point that the album really drags for me since there's no Betty left to look forward to, which is a shame.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (3): This is an okay track however it‚Äôs just boring and fillery to me. The album wouldn‚Äôt be any better or worse without it. The production is just too scarce and nothing else really stands out for Taylor here.
 
---
 
# The clowns to the west
 
**wavingwolves** (11): i'm pretty sure this will be a day 1 song, possibly even a bottom 5 one, but i still think it's actually the best song in the whole rate. i find it sonically captivating and lyrically intense in a way few songs are. it's the expression of something i relate to so much that it actually makes me feel like i know myself a little better every time i hear it. i know the idea of peace taylor is using here is about her fame and her status, but i have a different interpretation. in broad terms, it's about being a difficult person to deal with somehow, and in a more personal way it can be about not knowing how you ever be able to give peace to someone else when you're always in conflict with yourself. as someone who struggles so much with mental health, to the point where i actually actively don't date because of it, it really means a lot
 
**1998tweety** (10): the best of the ballads at the end of the album
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): i don't cry to this one but I do stare at my ceiling in the dark to it :)
 
**CarlieScion** (10): another tearjerker
 
**followingfreeways** (10): i know i'm going to be personally hurt when this goes out early. y'all don't have taste! this song is BEAUTIFUL. the lyrics are so so so good and her vocals are fantastic. this is honestly one of my favorite ballads she's ever released. it's so self-aware and so so personal and so honest, i don't see how people don't love this.
 
**hhiggy** (10): this is the perfect closer like why did she not end here
 
**mms82** (10): amazing vibes and definitely the second best song on the album
 
**mysario** (10): I have no doubt in my mind Popheads will crown this slow and rarely discussed track as the rate winner üòÉ
 
**RandomHypnotica** (10): kind of ironic that a track with the hook "would it be enough if I could never give you peace?" is the most peaceful instrumental on the whole album
 
**runaway3212** (10): I agree with wavingwolves
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): PEACE RIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK YOU /u/imadudeduh
 
**twistedpython** (10): This song gets the short end of the stick for some reason. Haunting and stunning and ethereal are the only words I can use to describe the way this makes me feel inside
 
**waluigiest** (10): The songwriting peak of this album. I love her songs like this (eg. Delicate) that show this personal vulnerability in her private, romantic life. And even though it‚Äôs rooted in her celebrity and larger than life essence, it boils down to an incredibly relatable insecurity: would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
 
**vagenda** (9.7): She named this song Peace because that‚Äôs what the world would see if everyone recognized it as one of the best on the album
 
**Stryxen** (9.5): why does everyone hate the wasting your honour line i just don't see the problem
 
**CHRMbishop** (9): are those synths??? disco perhaps??? IDM revival???
 
**ColsonBakerr** (9): an underrated masterpiece
 
**hunnybee12** (9): underrated
 
**jasannn** (9): I think I'm one of the few people who likes the production on this song.
 
**nooodisaster** (9): I lovvvee this song. So personal to Taylor, but universal in that we're all wrecks and realizing your lover has to compromise to be with you is a terrifying, sometimes unmanageable thing. But love is compromise, and the soft production hints at what can be gained from it.
 
**Roxieloxie** (9): You know what it could be because the album is ending, but I actually dont hate this. The guitar is calming.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): This should have been the closer over hoax tbh
 
**Awkward\_King** (8.5): me when it's peaceful
 
**bbfan132** (8.5): super relaxing/peaceful song
 
**mayolizard** (8.5): cute
 
**overscore\_** (8.5): Also a great album closer
 
**intheaftermath** (8): the album really could've ended here or even at betty, in my opinion
 
**musical\_pyn** (8): I love the undercurrent of the beat
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8): idk why this wasn't the closer on the standard edition
 
**skargardin** (8): this is so serene
 
**team\_kockroach** (7.9): this should've been the album closer. I love that bassline
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): The guitar sounds really nice and I really like the retrospective lyrics here. But this doesn't serve me replay value, unfortunately.
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I WOULD DIE 4 U IN SECRET
 
**rickikardashian** (7.1): ‚Äúthere‚Äôs robbers to the east, clowns to the west‚Äù queen of subtlety
 
**CrimsonROSET** (7): I thought her telling stories about other people would let her stop talking about her fucking reputation and I was wrong.
 
**fallenriot** (7): the melody is very meh, but it‚Äôs saved by the lyrics
 
**Flegasaurus** (7): i don't have much to say about this one but i liked it
 
**ktajlili** (7): very quiet and subtle. Gets kind of lost in the tracklist.
 
**mythicalbeaste** (7): Okay
 
**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): this would‚Äôve been a nice closer for the album
 
# The robbers to the east
 
**2dina3dworld** (6.5): peace is when you listen to "Evermore"
 
**pheromenos** (6.5): can't believe they let this song survive 4 rounds over at r/music_survivor
 
**wasian-invasion** (6.5): this song feels way shorter than it is lol
 
**ReallyCreative** (6.2): Well. Peace... never felt that, never been through that, peace, never experienced that E‚Ä¢MO‚Ä¢TION, truly, never never don't know what that is, only know no one has it
 
**bluepupz** (6): I originally heard "now that I see your brother as my brother" as "now that I see you as my brother" and thought about that "trust you like a brother" line lol! It's a pretty song, but I'm not a huge fan of how repetitive the instrumentals are.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (6): She's channeling Ed Sheeran's "I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with the flow" mood here. Not for better, for worse.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6): forgot it already
 
**wryn\_** (6): honestly the only dud on folklore
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (5): The only filler in the whole album.
 
**cremeebrulee** (5): this album drops off so badly in the second half. i appreciate the story she‚Äôs trying to tell here but as a song it bores me
 
**frogaranaman** (5): sadly blends into the rest of the later album tracks
 
**jexan13** (5): The worst song of Folklore
 
**MrSwearword** (5): too mediocre for derision
 
**pig-serpent** (5): It's cool that it has a more driving beat with a pedal tone but there's not a whole lot else going on during the song.
 
**SmileAndTears** (5): Eh
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): this song does nothing but get stuck in my head
 
**KennyEarthman** (4.5): I just can't vibe with this song
 
**AHSWeeknd** (4): the lyrics are great but the production could‚Äôve been wayyy better
 
**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (4): I'm sorry but I just can't with the lyrics. So cringe.
 
**givebackmysweatshirt** (3): why take a melatonin when i can just listen to this song
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (2): ‚Äúfamily that I chose?‚Äù Taylor streams SAWAYAMA confirmedüòó‚úåÔ∏è
 
**xxrandooxx** (2): miss taylor should have just stuck to poetry
 
**ryjomom** (1): I never thought I would give a Taylor Swift song a 1 before folklore existed.
 
**pat-rickstar** (0): Sorry but this is very boring. I'm still bitter about being downvoted on r/music_survivor for saying this should've been voted out first. They hated me because I told the truth

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song I slept on for quite a awhile until the video came out. It‚Äôs definitely an underrated bop on the album. The chorus goes off so much. The vocal effects layers throughout are cool and I love how it‚Äôs his old style lyrically but with a modern flair.
 
**hikkaru** (9): This isn't my absolute fave but damn if I don't love the 2-step / garage elements of it as well as the blasts of synth at the end. I do wish this made day 2 but I get why it's not placing so high here, the album really doesn't get going until a bit later for a lot of people so these early tracks aren't for everyone.
 
**akanewasright** (6): And the last Day 1 song out is probably my least favorite song on the standard edition of After Hours. It‚Äôs really well produced, but it doesn‚Äôt do much for me melodically or lyrically. But it does sound pretty damn cool, so I still at least like it a little

# This song cleanses my soul
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): he really showed some pop artists how to do pop with this
 
**jayjaysortagay** (10): I don't know what the fuck she's saying gurl but I'm living
 
**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): one of the best chorus' in the rate it's so addictive. The production is fantastic and the build up during the third verse - phew. popheads give this song justice
 
**bbfan132** (9): i don‚Äôt know what to say other than ‚Äúthis is a pleasant bop‚Äù
 
**Bombay\_Mapper** (9): Love it love it, distortion is my THANG
 
**booksandplantsand** (9): inject the outro into my veins pls
 
**waluigiest** (9): there are a few big crunchy moments that work really well. The contrast between verse and chorus is also great
 
**The\_Banana\_Nebula** (8.5): good instrumentals, I appreciate
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (8.2): incredible production
 
**cremeebrulee** (8): a song elevated by its outro / mv
 
**CrimsonROSET** (8): Abel I love you but why do you have 30 seconds of just instrumental at the end of this at least make it a transition
 
**mayolizard** (8): beat is pretty weak here
 
**MrMoodle** (8): I watched Fantano‚Äôs review of After Hours before I did this rate because like all Melon stans I am incapable of independent thought but even I can‚Äôt believe he put this as his worst track, this is a bop
 
**skargardin** (8): thinking of the body double in the mv
 
**jasannn** (7.5): The chorus is nice but it can't save the song from the excessive autotune and processing.
 
**nooodisaster** (7.5): Good
 
**thePotatofairyy** (7.5): Gorgeous synths. Not a big fan of the chorus but that bridge is outstanding and I look forward to it each time I play this song
 
**1998tweety** (7): cute lil filler bop
 
**2dina3dworld** (7): very nice
 
**camerinian** (7): I love how foreboding this is, even if that UK garage groove should have hit so much harder
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (7): This slaps, but I'm not amused by the overproduced vocals.
 
**frogaranaman** (7): sldjflksdjflskdjfljshdglksdjfklahsdgk;asjf;lkjadslkgjhdsfl;gkhjsaldkjfls;khgl;sakdhgbjksajglkadshgl;kasdhf;ljkaslgkjdfsl;kgh;lasdkjfl;sadjhgl;kashgl;ashdkljfhasdlkfjha;lfkjfds
 
**shesdoingyoga** (7): The album as a whole suffers for me because the first two songs are forgettable. I enjoy it while listening but it also kind of bores me
 
**wasian-invasion** (7): thank you mr weeknd for including an almost naked man in your music video
 
**SmileAndTears** (6.8): The Weenknd‚Äôs voice has always been hit and miss for me and it‚Äôs unfortunately a miss for me in this song
 
# It's not too late to skip the song
 
**bluepupz** (6.5): I like the chill vibes of the song. The background instrumentals are okay, but I think the ending is a bit too long.
 
**hunnybunchesofhoes** (6.5): Not unique thematically for him but nice
 
**jimmy345960** (6.5): Its going steadly down from here fam, then it JUMPS back up. I didn't listen to this album for so long cause I couldn't get through this section.
 
**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): it's alright
 
**wryn\_** (6.5): the way he says 'too' is so cute
 
**ColsonBakerr** (6): bcs of the MV i mean I love dark but that was... disturbing
 
**fallenriot** (6): the verses build so nicely but it feels like all the energy is released in the chorus
 
**followingfreeways** (6): this song confuses me. half the time i really enjoy it and the other half i am wanting to skip it. i think i'm just not a fan of the production
 
**Iris3271** (6): Not exciting enough for its length
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6): bridge is the best part, I can make him out better
 
**pig-serpent** (6): The sound switchup going into the chorus is cool, but that's most of what the song has going for it.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6): This is one of the last songs I'm hearing (I put the rate playlist on shuffle) and honestly it's way Too Late for me to be courteous.
 
**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I love Abel but the hook here does nothing for me. Easily the worst thing on his album
 
**wavingwolves** (5.5): the chorus is a bit annoying but otherwise the song is fine
 
**twistedpython** (5): My favorite video from this album but one of the weakest instrumentals, and the falsettos here exhaust their welcome quickly
 
**Awkward\_King** (4): i have this song saved from the album and i literally like... i dont think i like it im so confused
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): wow this album kinda opens badly
 
**mythicalbeaste** (4): I almost skipped
 
**runaway3212** (4): a vibe killer
 
**KennyEarthman** (3): I genuinely can't remember anything from this song
 
**ryjomom** (3): The beat is interesting...I like the end
 
**vintagebathingsuit** (3): yeah i...don't like this one. the music video is creepy as fuck though
