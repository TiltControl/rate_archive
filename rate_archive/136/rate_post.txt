**[Hello Popheads](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/funny-santa-claus-showing-fists-with-love-xmas-tattoo-picture-id1060895892?k=20&m=1060895892&s=612x612&w=0&h=8vHbhLV1xoLUoU8gtKy34qj762MtWH_P1KTRBV4Hhd8=)**

If you’ve been following along in the Daily Discussion/Discord you might be aware of the fun little mini rate that the [rate committee](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/659966194735906825/901646752862572634/Screen_Shot_2021-10-23_at_9.42.00_PM.png) has initiated, our first ever ratemas! For those who didnt follow along, we did games over the past 12 days to have users earn spots which they could then use to submit a song of their choice to be rated! Basically a charity rate without the money, and now this is the result. A Mini rate hosted by everyone's favorite weeknd stan, u/ignitethephenoxix and me!

Without further ado lets see our songs.
