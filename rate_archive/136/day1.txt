**Roxieloxie** (10): I personally think you all should be ashamed of yourselves that this is the first song out considering everything we had left. That being said this song isnt even bad enough to warrant the controversy this got!!!! BO$$ was right there

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This is obviously very early 2010‚Äôs X Factor energy in this song, but it‚Äôs decent! I think they have better but as a debut for a girl group, it did what it had to do.

‚Äî

#Will Never get that ten back again 

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (11): Y'all did this... Y'all made me do this... I hate y'all.

**1998tweety** (10): SMASHA

**CarlieScion** (10): idk if this is an ironic 10 anymore

**fadedblue09** (10): I unironically had a 5H phase

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song has more artistic merit than Wuthering Heights

**runaway3212** (10): people will see 5h's name and immediately decide they hate the song despite this being a banger

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the true national anthem

**TragicKingdom1** (10): p good song

**wavingwolves** (10): unironically better than hyperballad

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): I feel similarly about this as I do 1991; if you‚Äôre gonna submit an artist who‚Äôs doomed to leave bottom 5 anyway, why THIS song? BO$$ and He Like That are more camp and were right there! 212 was right there! This is lowkey a bop though, the Radio Disney pop rock/Kelly Clarkson-lite vibe is endearing and makes me nostalgic, so it gets a good score

**ebooks #5454** (8.9): yes i wanna be in HS and go to a fun carnival with my girl friends so what

**akanewasright** (8.5): somewhere, there‚Äôs a version of this song with Camila‚Äôs vocals replaced with takes from her bandmates, and I‚Äôd give that version a 10.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.8): gave this a couple listens to see if it would grow on me, now I like it more than their mainstream hits (Worth It and Work From Home which are both terrible)

**Stryxen** (7.6): a bit camp and slay

**TiltControls** (7.5): Wow! This is the best 5H song I've ever heard

**hikkaru** (7): this is alright actually

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): throwback

**vayyiqra** (7): Almost tempted to give this a 10 as a protest vote, but I have accepted that Popheads hates this band, and as something of a Harmonizer myself, this isn't even one of my favourite songs by them. It has a strong mom-pop energy and isn't that catchy. So whatever: go ahead, tank it. Life is suffering anyway. I can handle it.

#Its like [blank] but [blank]

**futureisrealized** (6.8): Good debut for Fifth Harmony but the song has not aged well.

**bbfan132** (6.5): it‚Äôs ok lol

**kappyko** (6.5): Miss.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Now I'm a Havana stan, but Camila's vocal spasms all over this opening verse make me think....... why was it her

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): I'm kinda screaming cuz this sounds so 2008 but it was released in 2013?? What the hell üíÄ

**jasannn** (6.2): Mr. Perfectly Fine is shaking.

**bo\_g\_o** (6): it's good but it loses points for having camilla cabello on it

**Mysario** (6): I see why Camila left

**throwaway-7650** (6): it's not a good song but I enjoy it a little

**bulforster** (5.6): When describing their 'whole world' as 'electrified' I believe fifth harmony are indicating a deep understanding of how charge-parity symmetry violation explains the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe and thus they are singing as the universe itself 'movin on' from the big bang.

**anothertown** (5): fifth harmony's debut/predebut was like.. we were delusional

**Awkward\_King** (5): now this does bop but it feels wrong to wrong to give it any higher when i look at its competition

**CrimsonROSET** (5): the single art looks like a magazine catalogue but the song itself is giving DCOM

**RandomHypnotica** (5): üê≠

**rslashpoopheads** (5): squeaky squeaky

**skargardin** (5): Well.. there are elements I like here, such as the melody, but ultimately it's way worse than I remember it being I fear

**waluigiest** (5): tbh I‚Äôm glad we left music that sounds like this in 2013

**sage** (4.6): why is camila squeaking

**babadork** (4.5): I never really thought about it before, but I think I don‚Äôt like Camila Cabello‚Äôs voice.

**Blisterman** (4): Lost my interest as soon as I heard "Survi-ived".

**daretheghost** (4): Blech. Nothing new or interesting, the same subject every other girl group has sung about.

**SinfulAnarchy** (4): sounds like an empowerment anthem Tori Vega would sing on Victorious

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): An Etch-a-Sketch huh?

**starla\_** (3.9): ehhtch a skehhhtchhh

**NotWith10000Men** (3.8): shake it off like an etch a sketch. this is offensively bland

**just\_thonking** (3.5): Oy vey it sounds like someone combined a Disney channel original movie song with an Imagine Dragons song.

**Uberpigeon** (3.5): this isnt as bad as i expected it would be! its still bad.

**steelstepladder** (3.2): this is one of those songs that popheads will go crazy for and say is pop perfection but when you go and listen to it, it just sounds like every other pop song from 2013 with an ok hook

**bespectacIed** (3): camila nasal voice a jumpscare... this song is basic white girl edm sorry

**camerinian** (3): my desire to have this song back in my life was literally less than zero

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): my god these camila vocals

**musical\_pyn** (3): like a 5 but ms cabellos vocals at the beginning make me want to not listen to the song so

**nonchalantthoughts** (2.1): yikes this is a pain

**\_\_Avaritia** (2): This irredeemable generic stuff should only belong on boomer radio where it resides to rot, sorry not sorry!

**apatel27** (2): bad disney song vibes

**nt96** (2): It‚Äôs like wonder bread, but for the ears.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2): This sounds like a generic Little Mix song that I don't think wouldn't have even made the cut for Salute.

**welcome2thejam** (2): Might be the only song in this rate I dislike. The generic sort of bad.

**frogaranaman** (1): why does the single artwork look like that really awkward photo pose you would do in like third grade

**plastichaxan** (1): i can‚Äôt even give it the camp 10 so just imagine it says 1.0

**ReallyCreative** (1): yeah I'll be moving on from this one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): oh man so camila really did always sound like that huh

**whoisValensi** (1): Guys, I think my ears are bleeding. I would like to use this opportunity to say that 'Me And My Girls' is worse than this. But also OW MY FUCKING EARS. I don't even have this that loud and yet it sounds so fucking loud. What is this production jesus christ?!?!?!?! This song is genuinely worse than I remember holy shit. And despite Camila doing her damnedest to claim she'll "never be that girl again" she still fucking squeals like she does on this track. Some things just don't fucking change.

**2dina3dworld** (0): this sounds like a reject Shake It Up song, they really wasted four out of five members talents in this and the fifth doesn‚Äôt have any to waste

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): The "inspirational" song leaves me uninspired and ready to be co-dependent.

**DefaultPophead** (0): Oh god, what is that squeaking at the start? It's so awful. Only reason why this isn't a zero is because some of the vocals nearing the end are really strong. EDIT: made it my 0

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (0): Who let their vocals sound like this? I feel so embarrassed on their behalf.

**flavasavavandal** (0): Blocky synths make a blocky synth noise and yet somehow Camila is the worst aspect of the song. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll shake it off like an etch ‚Äòn‚Äô sketch though

**MrMoodle** (0): i‚Äôve already listened to way more fifth harmony songs than i‚Äôve consented to and this might actually be the worst one yet

**seanderlust** (0): this is the song that gets produced when you feed an AI kelly clarkson's post-because of you discography and ask it to create a new song.

**thedoctordances1940** (0): ok i was honestly not prepared for just how bad this was gonna be, my expectations were low but boy were they blown out of the water

**ignitethephoenix** (5): Okay the ending I was not expecting that at all. It‚Äôs nice they injected energy at the end but like it‚Äôs so jarring from the rest of the song which is kind of mid and one note. And I‚Äôve never been a fan of screamo / screamo-esque music either so the ending doesn‚Äôt save it for me either

**Roxieloxie** (1): I am legally allowed to hate everything TOP dropped after I stopped listening on the grounds of the platform incident

---

# u/CrimsonROSET‚Äôs alts


**2dina3dworld** (10): this is gonna be a super unpopular opinion but this actually does go hard

**CrimsonROSET** (10): The reaction to this being revealed was more than worth it. Vote for 3mo!

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.7): story time: I accidentally stumbled upon Trench on its day of release (because it was trending on Genius, I think) and it is one of the first albums that I listened to start to finish because I loved it so much. The me that day would've given an easy 11 to this, now I grew out of their music a bit, especially after Scaled and Icy, but Trench is still pretty good and this is one of the best tracks on it: Josh's guitar, the structure of the song, the outro and the repetition of "Jumpsuit jumpsuit cover me" ugh I love it

**celladonn** (9.5): I haven't listened to Trench in a while and had forgotten how much I enjoy this, the second half especially

**wavingwolves** (9.5): sorry i had to pretend this wasn't good in the past but i'll not do it anymore

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Rock is back baby! Until it wasn‚Äôt but rock was back baby!

**Mysario** (9): TOP heard everyone talking smacking about them making soft pop songs so they started the next album on this banger

**bbfan132** (8.5): i‚Äôve been meaning to listen to this album for the past year or so‚Ä¶.

**bo\_g\_o** (8.5): this is gonna get slaughtered isn't it

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): Scaled & Icy > Trench

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): jumpsuits as an outfit are a 11 tho

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): There's some part of this song I enjoy (the heavy rock bits) but there's also parts of it that I kinda don't (the slower/ballad bits). I guess it's kinda like trying on an actual jumpsuit.

**runaway3212** (8): This song is overhated idc idc

**DefaultPophead** (7.9): I‚Äôm usually into this stuff, but there is something stopping this from being cool. Maybe it‚Äôs my awkward memories of seeing them live in high school.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): sisters.... the slay has arrived üíãüë†üíÖ

**1998tweety** (7): its campy i think

**camerinian** (7): unlucky that this is one of those 21P songs where one member of the band is clearly superior to the other. The percussion climaxes fucking rip, but the bridge (percussion-free) just kills the momentum and goes on for too long with seemingly unrelated content. Also unlucky that this song has to share a rate with Personal Jesus, which it feels massively inspired by

**sage** (7): trench slays i fear

**whoisValensi** (7): You ever hear an element of a song that might just be too good for the song? That's me with this bassline. The rest of this song is pretty meh to me, but that fucking bassline, man. Literally such a fucking sexy bassline, like it's so thicc and hearty and like aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I will forever talk about how much I love the bassline in this song because it is still fucking insane to me. (Literally like all my plays on this are just because I was like "Shit I need to hear that fucking bassline RIGHT NOW") I'm also the same way w/ 'heavydirtysoul'. Might not be too too big on that song either but that fucking bassline. Anyways what I think I'm trying to say is 21p are way too good at making great basslines for their own good.

#The People downvoting 3mo rate each cycle

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): this just doesn't work‚Ä¶ on many levels

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): vewy intewesting

**seanderlust** (6.5): besties i'm sorry but I do not have energy to get into TOP lore this blessed season so I have no idea what in the world they are talking about here. it's a fine song, the bass is cool, 6.5/10

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): This isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I kinda like it tbh.

**akanewasright** (6): I don‚Äôt hear what people hate in this so much. Like‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt say I love it, but this does not sound 0 worthy

**jasannn** (6): I‚Äôll still take this over Stressed Out and Heathens any day.

**just\_thonking** (6): I am incapable of forming an opinion on this song

**kappyko** (6): this really isnt that bad but idc for it much

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it started off great but

**ebooks #5454** (5): lyrically, not for me, which sucks bc i usually bop with 21p music

**frogaranaman** (5): "Chlorine" out jumpsuited

**lady\_sable** (5): banger chorus, the rest is mid

**NotWith10000Men** (5): not sure what kind of jumpsuits mr. pilots has seen but they generally do cover the wearer

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): I‚Äôm stuck between having retail trauma from this song and thinking it‚Äôs somewhat decent. And I hate defending TOP in any way, but I think that my coworker who called this an ugly screamo jumpscare and was worried that it would scare off our boomer customer base had a very bad take, the screams are a 10!

**skargardin** (5): I just found this boring, I'm sorry

**slimboyfriend** (5): My favorite kind of jumpsuit is a sparkly glitter kind :)))

**Uberpigeon** (5): its sad because the instrumental fucking bangs but then they have the extremely embarrassingly horrible refrain of "jumpsuit jumpsuit cover me"

**welcome2thejam** (5): I really like the intro! Basically whenever that riff is the focus, I'm enjoying it, but the rest is basically just the Jumpsuit riff waiting room.

**daretheghost** (4): I just hate Twenty One Pilots, tbh. I just spent a few days visiting family and my sister had one of their songs in her Liked playlist on Spotify‚Äìthe song was ‚ÄúMigraine,‚Äù if you‚Äôre curious‚Äìand the lyrics and delivery were so unbelievably cringey and I was like, ‚ÄúYup, this is exactly what I expect.‚Äù Anyway, I‚Äôm positive a middle school version of myself would love this and make lyrics my away message on AIM or something.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): yeah this song was the sign that Trench overall was not for me. In retrospect, I should probably thank it for kicking me out of my stanning twenty one pilots era.

**vayyiqra** (4): This isn't nearly bad as I feared but I'm not going to say I like it either. The screaming vocals at the end are awful though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I wanted to talk more about why I think this song is lame but I got distracted by the fact that, when you type in "Jumpsuit" on the Genius search bar, the first four songs that show up are PATD songs. None of them even have the word "jumpsuit" in the lyrics üíÄ Genius really went "hey bestie I think you're a little lost here's the band you should be listening to"

**starla\_** (3.6): I have never understood the hype for this band

**Blisterman** (3): This is terrible. "Jyumpsoot Jyumpsoot" ugh.

**plastichaxan** (3): i forgot this was playing until he screamed in my ear

**TiltControls** (3): a venn diagram of 'do I like this TOP song' and 'does this TOP song have a ukelele on it?' is pretty much just a circle. unforunately this one not in there

**babadork** (2): Overalls, shield me! Bellbottoms, protect me!

**fadedblue09** (1.5): huh what was that

**Awkward\_King** (1): ok

**CarlieScion** (1): lol

**mudkip1** (1): they made a whole ass album this year? i

**anothertown** (0): fuck these guys

**ReallyCreative** (0): my very first class of grad school, my professor defined "bullshit" as non-nutritive speech. 21 Pilots are musically non-nutritive, and Jumpsuit is no exception. Everything this band has ever done, someone else has done better and less embarrassingly. They are desperate to seem more interesting than they are, but all they'll ever be is two absurdly mediocre men from Ohio undeservedly blessed with some of the most pleasant fans I've ever interacted with in real life.

**Stryxen** (0): oh this sounds horrific and then it just randomly turns into a worse song halfway through

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i hate twenty one pilots with a burning passion

**Roxieloxie** (10): This Actually grew on me alot, and i say that as someone who normally hates christmas music. On principal as the one christmas song of this rate It should‚Äôve done alot better!! This song is peak comedy and im sorry pophead just couldnt get it

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Hey it‚Äôs the one Christmas song of this rate!!! Honestly this is a great novelty song that I suppose is tailored for popheads (there‚Äôs literally a poppers reference) and I just find it hilarious this is in the rate. If I had to be picky her voice isn‚Äôt  my fave but like everything else about this is entertaining for sure (shout of Pro ZD )

‚Äî


#Anyone want to weigh in their opinion here

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I was so confused when she said ‚ÄúI asked for a Nintendo Switch even though I‚Äôm a bottom‚Äù cause like‚Ä¶ what other video game console would a bottom buy? I‚Äôm not a bottom though I‚Äôm a super manly masc top who happens to have a Switch okay don‚Äôt look at me like that
**flavasavavandal** (6): that joke about being a bottom yet wanting a Switch doesn‚Äôt make any sense, like you‚Äôre a bottom, you worship Nintendo, it is an unwritten law

#King Dragon Sends His Regards

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I‚Äôm glad to know that we‚Äôve rated Cher, Shawn Mendes, and ProZD‚Äôs music the same amount of times. Anyways stream t.i.a.p.f.y.h

**ReallyCreative** (10): I can't believe we rated SonicFox and ProZD before Sara Bareilles, Santigold, or Metric

.**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): automatically a 10 for prozd

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): ProZD both killing it and killing me, ho ho ho

**lady\_sable** (7): oh hey prozd

**welcome2thejam** (6): SONICFOX AND PROZD!?

**\_\_Avaritia** (2): I‚Äôd call this a bad joke that went wrong but that‚Äôd be inaccurate because it assumes that an attempt at humour was made. Highkey this was a 0 until ProZD showed up.

**throwaway-7650** (1): was my 0 but ProZD is a king so

#People that get it 

**Mysario** (11): gave it a 10 once I heard "I asked for a Nintendo Switch even though I'm a bottom" but gave it an 11 once I heard SPOILERS that Santa was not homophobic all along! thanks fat man! even though I didn't get what I wanted for Christmas which was a new life

**bo\_g\_o** (10): i'm gay

**celladonn** (10): I can't believe I was the only person to submit a Christmas song for this rate and that it was this. This song makes me laugh so hard. Make sure you all stream t.i.a.p.f.y.h!

**frogaranaman** (10): love how this song has a furry feature

**NotWith10000Men** (10): a nintendo switch even though i'm a bottom. modern poetry

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's campmas

**seanderlust** (10): I fucking love LaL so much sgfdlkldjf


**TiltControls** (10): Gotta get some bonus points for being the only festive song here

**camerinian** (9.5): I knew getting lazy with address change admin was LGBT culture, I just needed some validation on that take

**bbfan132** (8.5): catchy and good!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): This has theater kid energy (I am a former theater kid) but it's funny as hell

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Wait, this actually kinda bops... Like am I crazy? This is really good.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the gays love cancel culture noitstrue

**kappyko** (8): after all the jack frost gay porn who wouldn't be

**nonchalantthoughts** (8): this is surprisingly good

**nt96** (8): Cancel Culture spares no one

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): unexpected banger?

**skargardin** (8): I got a good laugh out of this tbh


**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): This is silly, but also catchy and several lines have gotten stuck in my head since doing the rate. A warning to Discogs nerds, don‚Äôt cancel anyone without proof, or you‚Äôll definitely miss out on a rare vinyl!

**Blisterman** (7): Should replace Fairytale of New York as a Christmas standard.

**cremeebrulee** (7): üßçüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**ebooks #5454** (7): four year old ebooks was also cancelling santa in kindergarden when she told everyone santa was fake

**musical\_pyn** (7): t.i.a.p.f.y.h. rate when!!

**Uberpigeon** (7): i dont know how to rate this

**waluigiest** (7): the Frank ocean discogs comment at the end hit close to home

**CarlieScion** (6.5): an okay gag song

**MrMoodle** (6.5): left at london‚Äôs singing voice vaguely sounds like that of a high school musical character

# Would not be for a comedy rate


**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): The instrumental sounds like a cheaper "Where Is The Love", but the sudden twist ending is both heartwarming and kinda hilarious (not in a laugh-until-you-pass-out kinda way, more like a brief-nose-laugh kinda way). Also I love the fake choir bridge too.

**letsallpoo** (6): this is too online

**oliviagodrigo** (6): yknow what.. i didn‚Äôt laugh at the lyrics but her voice is really good

**rslashpoopheads** (6): this sounds like Weird Al

**SmileAndTears** (6): me when DHL returned my Mitski Mystery Shirt to the US for absolutely no reason


**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I can't really give this a high score because this is such a novelty song and it definitely isn't my type of comedy, but I need to say that the lead vocals are incredible

**starla\_** (5.3): okay what is this

**akanewasright** (5): camp?

**anothertown** (5): not Left at London x Sonicfox x ProZD LMAO

**plastichaxan** (5): oh i didn‚Äôt know Left at London covered one of Sufjan Steven‚Äôs many christmas songs

#People Who Really hate fun

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): i'm sorry i just don't found this funny

**Stryxen** (4): haha joy emoji

**SinfulAnarchy** (3.5): this is actually kind of catchy but the lyrics‚Ä¶ lmao

**daretheghost** (3): One joke that doesn‚Äôt need to be stretched for nearly 4 minutes.


**joeeswift** (2): idk it was just corny to me maybe I‚Äôm boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): bo burnham core sorry

**2dina3dworld** (1): maybe Santa didn‚Äôt give you any presents because this song sucks

**apatel27** (1): bad song for a good cause. 2yt4me

**bespectacIed** (1): if santa heard this corny song would you blame him

**futureisrealized** (1): Making this song definitely put you on the naughty list.

**runaway3212** (1): after this I think im homophobic too

**sage** (1): what the hell


**whoisValensi** (1): I fucking hate Christmas songs. Bah humbug.

**1998tweety** (0): i hate to call things cringe as an insult (u need to embrace your cringe!!!) but whew this is too much

**Awkward\_King** (0): this is inoffensive entirely but i find it so utterly annoying

**hikkaru** (0): i really can't stand comedy music like this i'm sorry to whoever submitted this

**Islands** (0): pain

**jasannn** (0): no thanks

**Unreal\_Fairy** (0): I think the speech at the beginning and the end of the song damage the whole song, the final chorus I feel it apart from the song and the vocalist's way of singing I don't like too much. I understand the sarcastic meaning of the lyrics, but I just can't see myself singing that song. The song is not that bad, but it is the worst compared to the whole lis

**vayyiqra** (0): Yeah sorry Nat I like you and like your music but this is a joke that didn't land. We didn't need a whole song to confirm that Santa isn't homophobic; we know Santa would never. Also it's very weird that this was a charity single. Maybe there's something I just don't get here but it's not funny.

**wavingwolves** (0): sorry but i don't get this at all

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this song is mid. At least with 212 her flow and the beat switches keep it interesting, but this song is just very flat from beginning to end (except the very end which is cool). Not bad at all, but not great either. Also Azealia‚Äôs producers deserve more credit with their house hop production, I want a revival of this sound that‚Äôs Azealia free

**bespectacIed** (11): Confident, level-headed azealia is one of the greatest songwriters in music, no it's true. Also this might be the first and only time I could ever give her an 11 cuz god knows what shit she'll do next before the sub's finally cool with rating Broke With Expensive Taste or Fantasea (i.e. never) üò≠

**anothertown** (10): :opening up the hymnal: oolalala flirting with a cool french dude named antoine

**Awkward\_King** (10): it slaps i fear, ny rose me most high chose me is one of the catchiest lyrics ik

**bbfan132** (10): i know this‚Äôll tank and my score isn‚Äôt going to change much so yeah‚Ä¶

**Blisterman** (10): Such a good track. The Machinedrum production, Azealia‚Äôs filthy flow. I love it.

**buddhacharm** (10): Banks. u coulda been the greatest female rapper alive but u blew it. dont take it out on the only person who had ur back. (3.9K replies, 27K retweets, 113K likes)

**kappyko** (10): She specifically wrote this song about the birth year of Pixie Lott

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this single song being better than some pop girls' entire discographies sorry i can't make the music not bop

**nootnoot781** (10): i‚Äôm pretty sure the trajectory of my life would be totally different if azealia wasn‚Äôt problematic

**sage** (10): yes azealia is a bad person but she has created some of the best music ever

**nonchalantthoughts** (9.8): classic in my book, my biggest flex that this was my song before it blew up on TikTok- the outro will always be the best

**bulforster** (9): With the authority of my degree in physics I can say Azealia Banks sucks as a person (but I unfortunately still like this song)

**vayyiqra** (9): This should not be interpreted as any kind of positive feeling toward the woman who made it, but this has a nice groove and yeah it's pretty good unfortunately.

**waluigiest** (9): in terms of beats and flow she‚Äôs really unmatched

**yatcho** (9): okay yes, i did submit Miss Azealia just to be chaotic. Don't expect it to win at all considering her reputation but that that aside, i do think this is a legitimately good blend of 90s house and hip-hop and still sounds so fresh

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): I once filmed myself doing a dance routine, Rihanna Umbrella style, to this song with a toy lightsaber. Absolute banger.

**starla\_** (8.1): I know, I know. But this slaps

**daretheghost** (8): I really struggle with Azealia, for obvious reasons, because she does make some great songs.

**lady\_sable** (8): it's a shame we never heard from Azealia again after this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): imagine sharing a birth year with Azealia Banks lol yikes, anyways I wish I hated this song more, insert ‚Äúworst person you know made a great point‚Äù meme

**slimboyfriend** (8): ...ou√≠!!

**throwaway-7650** (8): was a 5 but it grew on me unfortunately... hate it here

**NotWith10000Men** (7.9): this is a huge bop too bad it's from azealia banks

**hikkaru** (7.5): if this was 212 i'd probably want to give it a 10 so i'm glad that that is not here

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): As much as Azealia‚Äôs rapping on this one is kinda inconsistent and drags it down a little, at least it‚Äôs sometimes really on point, which is better than I can say about her social media takes. The instrumental is friggin killer though.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i hate it when shitty people are talented

**just\_thonking** (7): this is just a milder 212

**ReallyCreative** (7): do you think she's seen the tiktoks with the clip from Chowder yet

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Honestly I hate rating people like Azaelia because I'm like it slaps but also hmmmm... Like what if Elon Musk had been in ABBA and made Dancing Queen? What would we do?

**welcome2thejam** (7): I only have a vague knowledge of who Azealia Banks is, so I think I got all of the fun and none of the baggage

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): just removed from all the controversy, i've never particularly enjoyed azealia too much anyway but this definitely has its moments

**joeeswift** (6): obligatory ‚ÄúsHe CoUld‚ÄôvE beEn sO mUcH bigGer‚Äù comment

**nt96** (6): Imagine being a witch who's unable to conjure up a career.

**SmileAndTears** (6): Wait a minute... THIS is the reason some of yall are willing to overlook her actions?? okaaayyyyy...

**Uberpigeon** (6): this is not good enough to justify submitting but not bad enough that its 0 bait so

**seanderlust** (5.5): I am gonna scoot right past The Discourse (TM) as other folks will probably touch on it way better than I could. what I will say is that out of the 1991 EP, the title track is an odd choice. not bad, just odd. musically, it's fine but forgettable. rating it with the backdrop of everything that became of azealia, I fear I have to tank a bit

**bo\_g\_o** (5): ugh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its azealia banks

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (5): Person feelings aside, I genuinely do not like this.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): ‚Ä¶This is what Azealia sounds like? Eh

**ebooks #5454** (4.2): this is that girl at the frat party that thinks shes hot shit but instead she's just making everyone uncomfortable

**apatel27** (4): Very disjointed

**camerinian** (4): straight up this is like if you asked an AI to write an Azealia Banks song, and she is not one of those artists that deserves benefit of the doubt for a mid track

**plastichaxan** (4): this isn‚Äôt even one of Azealia‚Äôs best to cause the controversy

**futureisrealized** (3.1): I don't hate Azealia but this song is just awful, horrible beat and bad lyrics.

**flavasavavandal** (3): mixing this song so badly that it‚Äôs difficult to tell anything part (including Azealia) was a choice

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): the beats sometimes get interesting but hard to listen for the most of it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): I mean

**ImADudeDuh** (2): it was fine but she‚Äôs still azealia banks

**TiltControls** (2): submitting this is just asking for disaster

**2dina3dworld** (1): there‚Äôs a lot going on, and none of it goes together

**CarlieScion** (1): slay

**frogaranaman** (1): 991

**oliviagodrigo** (1): yeah good luck to whoever thought azealia banks would do well in a rate

**runaway3212** (1): I keep wondering why people put effort in defending azealia when her music sounds like this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): i'm so tired of this woman

**akanewasright** (0): This might have grown on me, but my initial impression was that it was‚Ä¶ not really great? Like I‚Äôd heard way better from her? And then it‚Äôs by Azealia

**babadork** (0): I had to listen to an episode of her podcast and now hearing her voice raises my blood pressure

**cremeebrulee** (0): i cant realistically give this a good score considering this lineup, i don't want this to do better than anything else here

**mudkip1** (0): mmhm.

**whoisValensi** (0): Azealia... aka the one of the artists I cannot separate their art from. I'm sorry but every time I think of this woman I think about how this woman is constantly racist, homophobic, and especially TRANSPHOBIC. And as a trans and gay guy that shit bugs me a lot. Real shame because there was a time where I liked '212' but now every time I think of her/hear her songs I think of these things. So yeah -_-, very easy 0 for me.

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): this does have some good elements but overall (the first minute), my anti hyperpop soul is not vibing with this. It feels like multiple songs slapped together and some of the abrasiveness and vocals pitching I can‚Äôt stand.  Also why is this over 4 minutes?? At least 100 Gecs doesn‚Äôt drag this out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): ITS ABOUT GODDAMN TIME THIS SUB STOPS SLEEPING ON FOOD HOUSE!!! they have hands down been my favorite music discovery in a long time and this song shows everything that makes them one of the most exciting artists to ever come from the hyperpop genre. gupi‚Äôs production and talent for beatmaking combined with fraxiom‚Äôs both clever and hilarious (not to mention endlessly quotable, theres not a single line in this song that isnt instantly iconic) lyrics is a match made in heaven and works out almost impossibly well. i debated for a bit which song of theirs to send, but ultimately, their debut song is the one i felt was the best introduction to their work to other listeners. cant wait to see it go out at #29 bc of all the hyperpop haters!!

**thedoctordances1940** (11): hyperpop haters are some of the ugliest people

**anothertown** (10): helpful mnemonic device- Thos moser is the one that doesn'T have the voicemail, and Mos thoser is the one that has the voiceMail

**Awkward\_King** (10): giving this a 10 even tho im ill rn and it feels like the world is red and getting smaller when i listen this too loudly

**bbfan132** (10): post-hyperpop

**jasannn** (10): this noise is giving

**Mysario** (10): this is what movies sound like when captions aren't on for me

**plastichaxan** (10): the next song from a roxie rate that will get the hyperpop shitpost when it inevitably gets robbed perhaps?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): I don't know why you forgot to credit Fraxiom on this, but yeah it's a banger. I like how Frax calls for Gupi to turn the snare up one more level and the volume of said snare doesn't change lol.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is fucking awful

**sage** (10): this being played during every single set at the minecraft concerts around the beginning of quarantine

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Yeah honestly fuck Notch Musk and Zedd

**MrMoodle** (9.5): mos thoser very slightly outsold but this still bops

**slimboyfriend** (9.1): Sometimes I think hyperpop is just really amateurish and grating for the sake of being dumb and annoying, and then I hear something like this where all of those things are true and I love it

**Blisterman** (9): People are going to hate this, but I think it's great. Nice find.

**cremeebrulee** (9): oh this fucks

**ebooks #5454** (9): god bless tony hawk for producing this child

**Stryxen** (9): unfortunately it‚Äôs amazing

**throwaway-7650** (9): from lyrics to production, this is just chaos in song form

**waluigiest** (9): okay so many nuggets are crammed in here. I think my fave is ‚Äúcheck like caroline pola‚Äù

**daretheghost** (8.5): If this song had come out when I was getting absolutely wasted on AMFs in college bars? I still wouldn‚Äôt be proud of myself but I'd also probably be dead.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): I went from ‚Äúhmm too chaotic for me‚Äù to firmly giving this a Good Score, gotta respect an anti-Elon anthem

**akanewasright** (8): This is honestly just a touch too long, but it‚Äôs gonna get tanked by hyperpop-phobes :woeis:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Did this trio just make a crunchy song that's good to vogue to

**kappyko** (8): What The Fuck Is A Thos Moser

**lady\_sable** (8): I am mentally ill

**runaway3212** (8): I hate how I will always end up loving a hyperpop song even if it's fucking terrible

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this isn‚Äôt Mos Thoser :((((

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): I can't tell if I enjoy this ironically or if I genuinely like it

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): There were some interesting noises in this song and I didn't know whether I hated it or really loved it.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): why do i like it sm

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): An experience, for sure

**seanderlust** (7.3): I feel like after every line of this song I have to sit down. Fuck McDonalds up!!!

**frogaranaman** (7): can't believe food house said "poggers" in a song before Ariana Grande

**Uberpigeon** (7): all of the food house album is better than this sorry!

**1998tweety** (6.5): this started nice and then rapidly went downhill

**just\_thonking** (6.5): The last minute really saves it

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): i admit i was kinda flabstering at the start but there's a few parts of this song i do #not like

**musical\_pyn** (6): an ad started playing in another tab and I thought it was just part of the song, like yeah sure this song really wants me to use grammarly

**welcome2thejam** (6): I like how super punchy some of these synths are

**starla\_** (5.9): this is okay

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (5.5): It's been like thirty seconds and I already don't like it. Ok that ending made up for it but not by much.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i am a hyperpop hater, and this song has a lot of bad parts but a lot of good parts too. I‚Äôm surprised I didn‚Äôt give it a 0

**wavingwolves** (5): i think this was a good submission for a rate like this (edit: my apple music had some kind of weird bug and instead of playing this song it played me a bunch of non musical noise and pure static and i listened to all of it thinking it was this "song" and i was like What The Fuck but then i realized i was just.. not listening to the actual song... so i skipped it over and came back to it and it actually played the song i was supposed to be listening to but the earlier comment was made about the whatever noise i heard that no one else will get to hear. i was going to give it a 0 to that bunch of noise but the actual song is merely ok)

**nonchalantthoughts** (4.3): ???

**CrimsonROSET** (4): :audience:

**mudkip1** (4): not this being tony hawk's son?!?!?!!?

**ReallyCreative** (4): there's like 2 really cool parts to this song; unfortunately one of them is when it ends

**TiltControls** (4): this is really just not my thing

**vayyiqra** (4): I can't decide if I like this or not. I like the "wonky" production but kind of hate the vocals. Still kind of a banger but Oh god no I hate the breakdown. Nope. Lowering the score a lot for that auditory terrorism. Not sorry.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): sounds like exorcism on a robot

**babadork** (3): Why is the world trying to make 3OH!3 happen again?

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): "Check like Caroline Pola" is the only redeeming thing about this song

**whoisValensi** (3): This sounds like 2014 FNAF/MLP music. No, I am not taking that back.

**bespectacIed** (2): ?

**flavasavavandal** (2): being hyperpop isn‚Äôt an excuse for mixing this incompetent

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): this is an abomination

**NotWith10000Men** (1.5): i do not enjoy listening to this

**rslashpoopheads** (1): um

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): was that an autotuned condor screech?

**apatel27** (0): It's just disjointed noise. Music for people whose attention span is 30 seconds

**CarlieScion** (0): this song is the audio equivalent of a man cornering you in a club

**futureisrealized** (0): Awful production and equal awful vocals, not even the best written lyrics in the world could save this song.

**oliviagodrigo** (0): might be the worst song i‚Äôve ever heard

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): for an Usher song is kind of mid im afraid. Not bad but not great either.

‚Äî

#well

**TiltControls** (10): wait this is a bop! another great discovery so thanks to whoever sent this! hopefully it doesn't get Misandry'd to day 1 cause it's really good

#Has a parachute

**cremeebrulee** (10): aw i adore the bridge here, its sweet

**flavasavavandal** (10): I am just a sucker for Usher‚Äôs voice


**kappyko** (9.5): actually surprisingly very very good

**Awkward\_King** (9): king

**musical\_pyn** (9): album art a 0 though

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): wait, this is good, why have I never heard it

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): it's pleasant sounding, but it didn't leave much of a lasting impression

**ReallyCreative** (8.1): it's good but I think it's going to go early, and honestly it's tough to argue it shouldn't. it's cute next to gorgeous!

**starla\_** (8.1): I really like this song but I forgot about it. Usher's face on the cover is weird af

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): After all these years this dude really still got it huh? Good for you Usher!

**akanewasright** (8): Me when always be my baby comes on in the car

**CrimsonROSET** (8): well I love you so hope that won‚Äôt affect anything?

**NotWith10000Men** (8): this is a jam

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**bbfan132** (7.5): this is nice!

**daretheghost** (7.5): Nice enough but kind of felt like the same verse over and over again.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): rather same-y throughout tbh but it's still a fine song

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Charli xcx outsold... and yes I'm highly aware the album isn't out yet.

**camerinian** (7): I don't remember this track being this groovy to be honest. The housey groove and bounce suits Usher really well and it'd be a great sound for him to chase going forward. Shame the hook really is as weak as I remember

**frogaranaman** (7): the production is so good

**Mysario** (7): if this was sung by anyone else, it'd be a dire flop

**rslashpoopheads** (7): jason derulo

**skargardin** (7): this is nice

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): started off not good but it honestly surprised me with how better it got as it went on

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Really digging the minimalist production.

**sage** (6.5): this is decent actually

**whoisValensi** (6.5): This isn't 'Crash' by CRX.

**bulforster** (6.1): Usher should hope he crashes against a compressible surface to extend his impact's duration so that the impulse his body has to withstand (defined as a change in momentum over time) is decreased.

#Driving the charli car

**Blisterman** (6): This does very little for me. His falsetto is too high to be enjoyable to me. And there's not much else to it.

**seanderlust** (6): this is for t-pain you bitch (i'm jk i'm not tanking the song it's just meh)

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): kinda boring

**bo\_g\_o** (5): bland

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): this is an usher song

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Please go back to making club bangers Usher‚Ä¶ we miss u <3

**welcome2thejam** (5): Chorus kinda holding it back tbh. Can't put my finger on why but the falsetto combining with the sludginess of the beat there is not working for me

**runaway3212** (4.5): usher's voice here is kinda annoying

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): an Usher song without Lil Jon shouting in the beginning just sounds wrong

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): umm

**MrMoodle** (3): i was excited to hear this, i don‚Äôt really listen to usher but he still has a handful of songs i love, but wow this kind of sounds like shit lol

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this just sounds lifeless to me

**Uberpigeon** (0): so cool that nails collaborated with the chalkboard on this one

**ignitethephoenix** (2.5): This song is kind of a mess imo. The production is very chaotic and sounds like a budget video game. And then I‚Äôm not much going a fan of the lead singers voice. And then it‚Äôs also 6 minutes and for what? Yeah this isn‚Äôt for me (but also Passion Pit may not be for me based on the two songs I‚Äôve heard from them).

---

#Lets take this 6 minutes to think about what was going on for them

**cremeebrulee** (10): shout out to my sister ebooks sorry i plucked your eyelashes off as a child

**ebooks #5454** (10): this one is for 6 year old creme who wanted to play salon with me as a kid and took some tweezers to my eyelashes because "the salon ladies always pluck small hairs from people's face"...THEIR EYEBROWS LIL CREME. THEY PLUCK THEIR EYEBROWS. NOT THEIR EYELASHES!! spent 17 years attempting to grow them back

# hypno and his alts

**RandomHypnotica** (11): I am not exaggerating when I say this is my favourite song of all time. I have over 500 plays of it, over 60 hours of playtime, and I still am obssesed with it. I love all the little instrumental flourishes, there's so many lyrics that just feel so cinematic, yet real, and romantic in a really sweet overboard way. Line's like "you want a life where there's a kiss before the credits", "all i know is that i need you and that you need me, and that's the way it's gonna stay unconditionally" and the whole river of love metaphor and "i held on tight enough, i'd never give up on love" is just so sweet, endearing, and romantic is just makes me desperately wish for a love like that. If Michael ever released this on spotify (which was allegedly supposed to happen with a remastered chunk of change in 2018...), I think I would just die on the spot. I don't expect this track to do very well in the rate, but i hope at least one other person has been introduced to it and can appreciate it. Because there's nothing worse than nobody else enjoying your absolute favourite song.

**2dina3dworld** (10): thank u Hypno, very cool

**akanewasright** (10): This is actually so good?

**Awkward\_King** (10): australia is good


**CrimsonROSET** (10): the passion pitfication of popheads has been the second most pleasant surprised of 2021

**frogaranaman** (10): I forget what this sounds like so I'm giving this my Manners average from the IPR rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): see hypno i finally gave a passion pit song a 10 can you forgive me for giving sleepyhead a 1 now

**TiltControls** (10): please don't rob this, we've already done enough Passion Pit rate damage to hypno this year

**Uberpigeon** (10): we love randomhypnotica <3

**vayyiqra** (10): Wow I'm sure this obscure Passion Pit deep cut that's almost 7 minutes long will clean up in this rate. :zany_face: Too bad I like it a lot. :pensive:

**lady\_sable** (9): the instrumental sounds like something from a video game in the best way possible

**plastichaxan** (9): why did this wash their IPR songs pleek

**skargardin** (9): Off I go to save this EP on Spotify

**waluigiest** (9): it‚Äôs relentlessly fun

**whoisValensi** (9): I see you Hypno, making us listen to your upload. Ya know I could have done that with Falling if I forced everyone to rate the version from the Love Me Again vinyl. Anyways this bops... I think. Maybe I'm crazy (probably am), but this is fun!

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): idk the context for this one but it's fun! a little unpolished but fun!

**1998tweety** (8.5): wait this BOPS

**jasannn** (8.5): I‚Äôm kinda glad the synths are overshadowing the vocals.

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.1): it's a little too long for my taste though

**anothertown** (8): Camp

**sage** (8): maybe if this song was in ipr instead of all the horrendous passion pit songs my average wouldve been high enough to have my ballot accepted !

**daretheghost** (7.5): Lowkey one of the reasons I wound up not finishing the Indie rate (other than running out of time) is because I have never liked Passion Pit. I like the music and instrumentation of this but‚Äìlike every other Passion Pit song‚ÄìI just hate the vocals.

**Mysario** (7.5): thank you to the Random Hypnotica YT channel for uploading this since its not on Spotify! don't know who submitted this song though, huge mystery

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I'm telling my kids this is 100 gecs

**bbfan132** (7): i wish i liked this more although it is pretty good - the production is nice but it doesn‚Äôt really go to a certain place that i would want it to go to

**Blisterman** (7): Pretty fun, if a bit long.

**nt96** (7): Just wanna give Hypnotica a big hug and apology ahead of time when this gets robbed.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): What in the world is this? Ok, it took some growing, but I like it.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Wonky, but in a fun way!

# Starting hypnos selegened era

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): It's not the worst Passion Pit song I've ever heard. His upper register actually makes me wince still, sadly.

**kappyko** (6): Eduardo Vite1 year agoThis is Amazing!4Gerardo CamposGerardo Campos7 months agoTotally agree4

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): This song didn't really need to be 6 minutes long.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): You‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I THOUGHT I KILLED YOU. Well, at least this is more palatable than most of Manners. The magic of singing with a normal, not annoying voice, I guess!

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): I mean this song is fine but like, if the Indie Pop rate taught me anything, is that Passion Pit‚Äôs whimsical tendencies only work when the songwriting is actually there. And well‚Ä¶

**futureisrealized** (5.3): Production lacks depth, don't like the vocals.

**starla\_** (5.2): this is okay, Passion Pit is really hit or miss for me in general

**CarlieScion** (5): ????????

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): Face to Face with more noise. some bits are nice but as a whole I don't like it

**thedoctordances1940** (4.4): tf is this bro

**runaway3212** (4): passion pits voice is still horrible im so sorry

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Nothing will make me re-evaluate my Passion Pit scores for this rate, Hypnotica

**SinfulAnarchy** (3.5): this sounds like mosquitos

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): it got worse the longer it went on jesus

**NotWith10000Men** (2): sorry benji from youtube but i will rob this blind

**throwaway-7650** (2): beep boop music but boring

**wavingwolves** (1): forgive me, hypno, we must continue our journey as enemies...

**bo\_g\_o** (0): this has make the bus energy (derogatory)

**ImADudeDuh** (0): This is reminding me of that anti-catchy how-to music from that one tumblr post I can‚Äôt find. His voice goes between sounding bored to sounding annoying as hell. And yes i have to use the L-word for this. It‚Äôs too Long. Even though its not the longest song in the rate, it is the one that shouldn‚Äôt have been long the most. I‚Äôm sorry but this proves that you really gotta keep moving forward, or at least just leave 2006 alone.

**joeeswift** (0): the ‚Äúraters don‚Äôt rob this‚Äù comment on youtube made the low score even harder to submit im sorry </3

**Roxieloxie** (8): It‚Äôs c-ute

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): this is very boppy but the production is just a tad too harsh and verges almost into hyperpop at parts.

---

#Cute People

**2dina3dworld** (10): I miss C-ute, they had the best music out of the entirety of the H!P, except for maybe golden era MoMusume.

**kappyko** (10): the song in this rate that i didn't know before that definitely makes me want to listen to more from this artist

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ü§™

**vayyiqra** (10): I was going to give this idk an 8 and say "this is cheesy but fun" and leave it at that, but now I can't stop listening to it and played the video about a dozen times in a row, so I have to give it a 10. That's implying it is on the same level as "Hyperballad", and I don't care. This is a total banger. #StandWithDachi

**bespectacIed** (9): so good

**mudkip1** (9): intense but fun

**1998tweety** (8.5): jpop serve

**akanewasright** (8.5): I hope we can have a jpop idol rate at some point, this chorus is delicious

**lady\_sable** (8.5): o shit this SLAPS!! Lowkey giving me Orange Caramel vibes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this goes kinda crazy!

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): now i wish it was on spotify

**skargardin** (8): banger!

**throwaway-7650** (8): it's giving nu'est/2nd gen electrotrash, love it

**nonchalantthoughts** (7.5): fun but they could have went off more

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): it sounds a little‚Ä¶cheaply produced? im not sure how to describe it but the mixing sounds a bit off. still a good song though

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): It's cute...

**sage** (7.3): cute bop

**Awkward\_King** (7): ok pussy

**bbfan132** (7): this was fun, esp the mv lol

**CrimsonROSET** (7): we love budget

**DefaultPophead** (7): Would've given it a much higher score if I didn't force myself to watch the music video. Girl group dancing always makes me kinda shrivel up.

**ebooks #5454** (7): this is the most 2010s jpop thing ive ever seen

**nt96** (7): Pretty enjoyable I guess

**rslashpoopheads** (7): cute

**TiltControls** (7): It's c-ute

**welcome2thejam** (7): The rest of the song couldn't really live up to the promise of that first drop, but then again, what can?


#B-ad


**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.7): I don't like this one as much as the Reol one but it's definitely good. The production/mixing on it could be a little better but other than that, yeah, this is a really dope J-pop tune.

**Blisterman** (6): Had to go on Youtube, and now I‚Äôll be recommended J-Pop songs for the rest of time.

**bo\_g\_o** (6): it's cute

**daretheghost** (6): I know I shouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúthis is dated‚Äù because maybe if I listened to it when it was released I wouldn‚Äôt think that way. Big Dance Dance Revolution energy.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it's good but the little instrumental section is the best part of the song by far

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's fun but I don't have a ton of thoughts about it, and that's not going to cut it for this rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This sounds like it could be one of those Rhythm Heaven Remix songs

**wavingwolves** (6): it IS cute

**whoisValensi** (6): I like how my first instinct was to Google what year this came out (2013 btw). Anyways, yeah this has, as the kids say, "aged". Whether that's a good or a bad thing, I suppose it comes down to preference. But personally I'm not a big fan of this.

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.9): not very exciting

**babadork** (5.8): With no knowledge of this group beyond this song and video, I stan Okai Chisato.

**frogaranaman** (5): I just know that distributing to DSPs with that name is a pain

**Mysario** (5): it's not on Spotify and I can't listen to it at work on YT so here's a neutral score, you can all thank me later

**runaway3212** (5): I wish I liked this more, but I feel like I've heard this exact song performed a lot better, it feels a tad to basic for me

**steelstepladder** (5): I really don‚Äôt like the dentist drills

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): Gnarls Barkley outsold, sorry not sorry!

**celladonn** (4.5): Hmm, I don't like the sound of the synths here

**seanderlust** (4.2): sorry I cannot stand the screechy synth in the context of 2010-ish pop music (see also: rest of my life by david guetta)

**apatel27** (4): dunno if it's the mixing but it sounds like they recorded it using a karaoke machine

**pantomime15** (4): Sounds a bit dated

**camerinian** (3): why is this so loud

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the girls are alright but jesus christ this production is screeching

**NotWith10000Men** (3): oh no these outfits are hideous x(

**starla\_** (0): sorry this is not it

#Stans Trains

**kappyko** (10): vibes.

**nonchalantthoughts** (10): sicko mode or mo bamba?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): my second favorite christmas movie of all time. i have very fond memories of watching this pretty much every single day of december when i was younger and loving the music in it. the ‚Äúwhen christmas comes around‚Äù scene still makes me cry when i listen to it sometimes. also the animation never seemed that weird or uncanny to me? i dont know why so many people hate it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): when tinashe wins both rates OMG

**throwaway-7650** (10): a classic

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): HERE WE ONLY GOT ONE RULE

**seanderlust** (9): we love public transportation

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I only saw this movie once but I remember really liking it.

**Awkward\_King** (8): tinashe only artist w two songs in this rate

#CalArts antis:

**RandomHypnotica** (6): this is why realistic cg is a bad idea

**Mysario** (5): the animation is still scary af

**ReallyCreative** (5): absurdly mid

**akanewasright** (4): dull as fuck

**Blisterman** (4): Weird uncanny valley animation. Deeply unpleasant.

**2dina3dworld** (3): the animation on this is so creepy and uncanny valley that it makes it impossible to enjoy. Doesn‚Äôt help that the story isn‚Äôt that great either.

**plastichaxan** (3): no cause these kids are so annoying and look so weird and for what

**runaway3212** (3): why would you ever take a train when you can take the bike this post was made by dutch gang

**sage** (3): oh thats not

**TiltControls** (3): the animation should count it as a horror movie

**vayyiqra** (3): Even aside from the discourse over the awful animation and uncanny-valley characters, it's really boring and I could barely pay attention to it the one (1) time I watched it.

**apatel27** (1): CGI gave me nightmares so just no

**frogaranaman** (1): stop saying I look like the one guy from this movie just because I have brown hair and glasses

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i hate the polar express so fucking much its so ugly and boring and idgaf about the hot chocolate scene

**Stryxen** (1): oh it just creeps me out

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is definitely one of the most rewatchable Christmas movies. It‚Äôs also probably the only massive group ensemble that actually works well.

**Roxieloxie** (7): Ill be honest the only thing I know about this movie is that its was harry styles favorite movie as a kid which means my only exposure to this movie has been in the context of it being a plot point in various fics in the 1D tag on ao3

‚Äî


#They get it 


**wavingwolves** (10): this was harry styles' favourite movie growing up. i wish i could forget this information but i can't so you'll have to bear it too

#Belives in Love

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SLAYED! legit one of my fave movies

**ebooks #5454** (9.5): creme is gonna kill me for this but well i quite love movies like this where you follow a bunch of different people/stories simultaneously (another ex: Valentine's Day). there were some plots i didn't like at all (the cheating husband & the guy who likes his best friend's new wife) but the lil drummer boy's crush was so cute (also bonus points thomas brodie-sangster is ADORABLE) something about these multi-plot stories always make me feel warm and fuzzy and more connected to people. this is also one of the few rom coms that makes me feel emotions. also i really want to try banoffe pie!!

**runaway3212** (9): Taylor Swift is in this!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): A problematic fave tbh. But "The Holiday" outsold

**Mysario** (8): I feel like this only recently became a Christmas classic but for a good reason

**plastichaxan** (8): colin firth i‚Äôm free every day please

#Getting Targeted Tinder Gold ads

**seanderlust** (4): this title always gives me "well, actually...."

**apatel27** (3): Never cared for this movie

**Blisterman** (3): I can‚Äôt remember a movie I enjoyed watching less than this. Irritating characters. Unearned sentiment. Lame British stereotypes, clearly aimed at Americans. Big thumbs down from me.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): there is still time to delete please delete people are crying

**ImADudeDuh** (3): im heterophobic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i hate seeing straight people happy

**Awkward\_King** (1): bad

**cremeebrulee** (1): oh fuck this movie fr

**RandomHypnotica** (1): recently there was a love actually concert in my city, where they hired an orchestra to play the soundtrack to the film live while it played. While the idea is cute... tickets were $200 a pop... and they sold out???? across 4 cities in australia????? where are these insane love actually stans?!?!?!

**ReallyCreative** (1): criminalize heterosexuality

**ignitethephoenix** (5.1): i have not seen this either but this one girl in my high school always used to talk about how much she loved the main character and how funny he was. So + 0.1 for that

# The people who have nostalgia

**babadork** (10): Admittedly, I have not seen it in years after watching the full 24 hour marathon during a traumatic experience.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is my favorite Christmas movie

**kappyko** (10): i cannot fucking believe my boyfriend made us stop watching this movie to explain the entire plot to jojo's bizarre adventure the night stone ocean came out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if i was able to give a bonus track(movie?) an 11 i would without a doubt pick this one in a heartbeat. easily my favorite christmas movie of all time and one of my favorite movies in general? theres not a single scene or line of this movie that isn‚Äôt immediately iconic. the tongue stuck to the flagpole, the shopping mall santa, the christmas tree shopping, the pink bunny suit, THE LEG LAMP‚Ä¶.for my 18th birthday my dad took me to the actual house that this movie took place at in cleveland and it is one of my fondest memories of the past few years. i could literally watch this movie every day of my life and not get sick of it it really is that good.

**akanewasright** (8): uh oh nostalgia

**Mysario** (8): o v a l t i n e

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): "You'll shot your eye out" is forever burned in my brain. But it's actually kinda iconic.

**Blisterman** (7): It doesn‚Äôt quite hold up as well as other Christmas movies, especially given how much of a touchstone it seems to be, but it‚Äôs enjoyable.

# Dr. Doofenshmirtz to Perry:

**runaway3212** (7): who knows what this movie is, certainly not me

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs a classic but it‚Äôs been done to death

**seanderlust** (6): watched this every year with my dad and when I was a kid this was a 10. then I rewatched it as an adult and some of the scenes uh,,,did not age well so I am going to dock a few points. the drink your ovaltine bit is still funny though

**RandomHypnotica** (5): i literally know nothing about this movie but i didn't wanna leave one movie unscored

**ImADudeDuh** (4): probably the most overrated ‚Äúclassic‚Äù christmas movie

**plastichaxan** (4): this unlocked a boring memory of watching this as a kid

**Awkward\_King** (2): tf is this

**ReallyCreative** (2): criminalize movies about nuclear families behaving like this jfc

**anothertown** (1): It's so bad I want to give you a 0. But that's not possible, so I‚Äôm giving you a 1

**sage** (1): this movie is actually so horrendous .. the amount of times ive been terrorized by it omfg

**vayyiqra** (1): Yeah no I hate this movie and everything about it. I have never gotten through the whole thing. It irrationally annoys me. Can't stand it. Tanking it. Not sorry.

So then I tried a few days later but I ended up watching the knight movie with hypno and creme instead and honestly that one is kinda ???? I wish i remembered it I would‚Äôve tried to sneak it in the bonus rate. 

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I watched this last year and it‚Äôs kind of camp. It‚Äôs probably the best Netflix Christmas movie (which I know isn‚Äôt saying much) but like whoever though to parent trap Vanessa Hudgens + add fictional royalty + baking deserves a raise

‚Äî

# I took her to my penthouse then I switched it

**throwaway-7650** (10): giving this a 10 to support my asian queen vanessa

**Mysario** (9.8): Vanessa Hudgens did it better in Netflix's "The Christmas Knight"

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): lmao

**frogaranaman** (8): LMFAO

**waluigiest** (8): it‚Äôs terrible but like‚Ä¶ Inevitable?

**anothertown** (7): one vanessa anne hudgens is my friend. two.. my bestfriend

**runaway3212** (7): people.... are gonna die

**seanderlust** (7): is the princess switch the same thing as the slay button in drag race superstar?

**ebooks #5454** (6.9): i know its unfair to rate something i haven't watched (i watched a synopsis video) but 2 vanessa hudgens?? shes so pwetty and for what; ik its a basic cheesy plot but christmas movies get a pass on that esp anything parent-trap trope like. also i think its hysterical how much ppl hate it yet theres 3 movies out haha

#Camp can only be camp with gay people 

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i just flipped the switch

**RandomHypnotica** (6): The Knight Before Christmas outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (5): im so into princesses right now

**welcome2thejam** (5): Generic boring prince: i sleep; Loving single dad: real shit?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): im gonna be honest ive never watched this movie nor do i plan to but i didnt want this to be the only film in the bonus rate i didnt give a score to so i just read the synopsis on wikipedia and gave it a score based on that. barbie perfected the prince and the pauper story nearly 20 years ago we dont need to remake this anymore.

**apatel27** (3): How did a child Lindsay Lohan manage to pull off this double act stuff better than an adult Vanessa Hudgens

**agentofscranton** (1): some movies are going to get a 1, which is terrible, but like, inevitable?

**plastichaxan** (1): not camp

**Uberpigeon** (1): this movie isnt even bad in a funny way

**Roxieloxie** (8): Im shocked this ended up being as divisive as it was.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): sex positivity on women from a man? A rarity! It‚Äôs a a nice bop I‚Äôll admit, not my usual genre though.

---

#fka twigs

**joeeswift** (11): already become one of my fav songs. ty to whoever submitted <3

**steelstepladder** (11): A perfect slice of Billy Joel inspired character driven singer songwriter pop that explores sex work in a way that both celebrates the workers and mocks the detractors. A toast to those that don‚Äôt get the credit they deserve with the sincerity of a KKB song and a true breath of fresh air in the current landscape of music, in a tongue in cheek way that only Alex Cameron can deliver. I‚Äôll accept the 11 average now.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was the first song on a playlist a boy i was talking to and think i still might slightly be in love with made me abt a year ago so not only is it a really boppy song with fun and smart lyrics it also just feels like a hug bc it reminds me of him and that time in my life

**bo\_g\_o** (10): fine, I guess flannel melon man has taste

**celladonn** (10): This is bopping, Fantano maybe made some points when he put this at the top of his 2019 singles list

**flavasavavandal** (10): Thinking about how I told steel in beatsense I would give this a 10 if they submitted this instead of Weezer. Yes you can thank me now

**MrMoodle** (10): the warmth of this song makes me yearn for something i never had, like, you ever dream about living in a close-knit country town and having a celebratory shindig in an old converted barn with fairy lights everywhere and you‚Äôre all laughing and dancing and having a good time, and then you wake up and feel severely depressed? same vibe

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): It‚Äôs genuinely catchy, and I feel strongly enough about the pro-sex work message to give this a 10 even if this isn‚Äôt my usual kind of music.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): can't believe the first time i heard this i thought it was only fine

**akanewasright** (9.9): This is really good but I have a weird association with it that leaves me feeling hollow. BUT people are being weird to it so I won‚Äôt drop this score more than a tenth of a point

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): I actually had no idea what this was about until the chorus, I love the juxtaposition of the 80s soft pop rock sound and the blunt, camp lyrics about sex work

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): we love Australians and we love sex workers

**daretheghost** (9): SEX WORK IS WORK

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.7): groovy, fun, interesting lyrics too

**TiltControls** (8.7): an interesting way to start the playlist but I'm really enjoying it!

**starla\_** (8.6): fantano won

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): we love sex work

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): doo doo doo doo

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.4): i like it

**jasannn** (8.3): i love corn

**bbfan132** (8): probably would have to grow on me but i like it

**camerinian** (8): I've always struggled with how seriously I'm meant to take Alex Cameron's sleazeball persona, so I'm gonna take this as a cute sincere shout out to the sex workers of the world and not think too hard about it

**ImADudeDuh** (8): something something billie eilish rotted her brain

**kappyko** (8): "Wow! That TiltControls post was cool, I guess now is a better time to start Popheads rates than any! Let's start this, it seems pretty short!" [FULL HOUSE THEME STARTS PLAYING]

**SmileAndTears** (8): a cute lil bop

**Uberpigeon** (8): i support a girlboss

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): So do you guys think Billie lurks this sub and wrote that thinkpiece cause she listened to this song for the first time

**Mysario** (7.5): coffee shop-core is still perfect for the season

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): sex positive bop that does not stack up against the better songs in this rate

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): DRAG THESE STRAIGHT CIS HET MEN!!!

**seanderlust** (7.3): we love a pro-sex work anthem. and they're right - like, you don't get to look down on sex work and enjoy the fruits of their labor
#lana del rey


**bulforster** (7.1): There is no empirical evidence in physics that God exists so I support her.

**bespectacIed** (7): the video was a slay but message >>> song itself

**lady\_sable** (7): ooh I like this! Reminds me of The Killers, but glitz-ier? Love the message too!

**skargardin** (7): this has a nice groove to it, I like it!

**vayyiqra** (7): I had a whole long essay in my head with thoughts on arguments for and against sex work and their relative merits, but that seems like a discourse it's better to not get into on Popheads, so I'm just going to say this is a good song!

**waluigiest** (7): All About That Bass : body positivity :: this song : sex work inclusive feminism

**welcome2thejam** (7): Alright, I suppose you've earned your doo-do-do-do-doo-doo‚Äôs with this one

**ebooks #5454** (6.9): i really liked the interviews in the m/v

**NotWith10000Men** (6.7): it's a cute song but i'm not crazy about his voice

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**whoisValensi** (6.5): Ya know, I'm not sure if this song is pro or anti sex-work at this rate. Like it sounds pro-sex work, but at the same time... Delivery/wording of a few lines. Now I've heard this song a few times because of Beatsense parties so the "shock" is a lil warn off of me, but I can see how this would shock someone on a first listen lol. Anyways my favorite fact about this song is that Simon O'Connor who is the touring bassist for MGMT shows up in the video lolllll.

**anothertown** (6): i guess i can't make it not bop but the lyrics............

**frogaranaman** (6): üò± she's üò± doing üò± porn üò± again üò±

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the mv really did help me give this a better score

**wavingwolves** (6): for some reason this feels it goes on for more time than it does

**futureisrealized** (5.4): Just feels very generic.

**apatel27** (5): 2yt4me

**Blisterman** (5): Interesting lyrics but musically somewhere between boring and annoying.

**cremeebrulee** (5): i do like everything else about it and the MV definitely puts it in a better context but i‚Äôm sorry i just really hate the chorus. it feels very juvenile and it just drags my enjoyment of this way down

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): Yeah I know this is supposed to be some humorous, tongue-in-cheek song about sex work and chiding people who look down upon them, but it really fails in‚Ä¶ every regard? Overly preachy and narrow-minded in lyrics and just overall the instrumentation needed help. Somewhat catchy though, I guess.

**just\_thonking** (4.5): not to walk into this debate but I feel like he is kind of romanticizing a very exploitative industry? Like yes sex workers deserve respect and support but the way he's like "you can't even comprehend what she does" and "she plays grown ups for real" feel like he's (for lack of a better word) girlbossifying a perilous line of work that women are often forced into and papering over the dark underbelly of the industry. Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about but it doesn't sit right with me. Also the song itself is pretty bland.

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): He sounds like a WalMart David Bowie and the whole song is a little too "I'm not like other guys because I think women who do sex work are cool!"

**CarlieScion** (4): not to be man phobic but can men stop singing about women

**throwaway-7650** (4): slay MV but I wish I liked this more

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): goes on for way too long i fear

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): As much as I do appreciate this song being about comparing the (literal) Virgin porn consumer/coomer to the Chad pornstar/sex worker, it's still pretty mid. I'll probably have to listen to this song a couple more times to really enjoy it but yeah, I'm sorry, at the moment, it's mid.

**Stryxen** (3): this song has a cool concept and the lyrics are great but i just wish it didn‚Äôt sound like a glee cover of a noah and the whale song

**2dina3dworld** (2): this sounds like a reject from the Beach Boy‚Äôs Summer in Paradise

Roxieloxie: **musical\_pyn** (0): This is a sorta interesting topic for a song and everything but that hook is absolutely AWFUL

**runaway3212** (0): I know this is supposed to be 'uplifting' but to me it sounds like he's making a punchline out of being forced into porn for financial reasons and it just makes me super uncomfortable

**sage** (0): this is so horrendous im sorry

**ignitethephoenix** (8): The production is super neat, it‚Äôs very fresh and 80‚Äôs inspired sounding. The melody is great too, the only thing that‚Äôs holding me back a bit is iris‚Äô voice. I don‚Äôt love it and I kind of wish someone else sang it. Overall it‚Äôs solid.

# Manic Pixie Dream Saphics 

**2dina3dworld** (10): a theme song for manic pixie dream girls

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song makes me want to dance on a shooting star and then kiss a thousand people

**CarlieScion** (10): lets go lesbians!!!

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): why haven't i heard this before??

**ReallyCreative** (10): the Norway girls really coming for the throat huh

**Uberpigeon** (10): vote quirky Belgian pop!

**ebooks #5454** (9.7): not creme saying this is how she thought i dressed in HS :grinny:

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): maybe norwegian synthpop girls can make points

**1998tweety** (9): this is nice

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i swear communication isn‚Äôt that hard are you guys ok

**vayyiqra** (9): Oh look I'm giving a high score to some flop girl who made an 80s-sounding synthpop song how predictable

**runaway3212** (8.5): lesbians keep winning change my mind

**TiltControls** (8.2): that's one catchy chorus

**cremeebrulee** (8): the trio in the MV is givng haim x powerpuff girls, kind of love that

**flavasavavandal** (8): the worst thing about this song is that it reminds me of We Don‚Äôt Talk Anymore by Charlie Puth and Selena Gomez

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I love Charlie's Angels

**rslashpoopheads** (8): cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I was a bit put off in the beginning but I was definitely vibing by the end!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Hey @ the next filmmaker planning a coming of age story, boy do I got the perfect song for your soundtrack‚Ä¶

**camerinian** (7.5): this song is literally doing everything it can to overcome indie girl voice. Nice effort I guess

**daretheghost** (7.5): I really like the sound of this and would probably look into the rest of the album. Occupies a similar space to me as the Baby Queen track.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): good but it kinda flows oddly at points

**just\_thonking** (7.5): This sounds like a The 1975 song (non-derogatory)

**plastichaxan** (7.5): the discord nitro user urge to use an emote as my comment that half of the subreddit reading this wouldn‚Äôt understand

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): a cute synth-pop song that would play in a generic coming-of-age film

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): white woman synthpop moment

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I mean... I've already lost my mind. So technically I wouldn't lose anything....

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): it's cute, it's good, but it doesn't blow me away by any means

**bbfan132** (7): this is pretty nice

**Blisterman** (7): Not bad, but once you've heard a few hundred 80s influenced pop songs, you've heard them all.

**skargardin** (7): this is cute

# Gay people can make boring music representation

**Mysario** (6.9): I was told to give this an 11 I think as a joke

**nonchalantthoughts** (6.7): too basic

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): extra point for being wlw

**lady\_sable** (6): ehh not really into her indie girl voice

**NotWith10000Men** (6): i'd like it more if she were a stronger singer

**bo\_g\_o** (5.5): this is bland

**starla\_** (5.2): this is alright

**apatel27** (5): nothing here that sticks

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): sounds like something youd hear while shopping for clothes at the gap

**thisusernameisntlong** (4.6): Chaotic and not in a good way. Song doesn't feel like one coherent piece. Irritating to listen to, even though there is stuff to like.

**whoisValensi** (4.5): This should hit for me because there's a lot of elements I like here (strong synths, reverb drums)... But this just reminds me of everything I don't like about Caroline Polachek for some reason lol.

**sage** (4.2): whys the low budget album cover giving more than the song

**akanewasright** (4): this is a solid song, but if I never heard it again I wouldn‚Äôt notice it was gone.

**frogaranaman** (2): why is this so boring damn

**Roxieloxie** (10): Okay so I sent this and I‚Äôll be honest I sat for a long while thinking of what I wanted to send to ratemas, I wanted something inoffensive enough that was still really good, so i settled on this, which is why it absolutely shocked me when literally no one enjoyed it ???? I remember sitting in the listening party when this came on and everyone was like ‚Äòthis is really good but its probably gonna overstay its welcome in the rate üò§‚Äô and it was literally in 30th place. ~~I guess Im glad it just barely got a 7 average in the very end,~~ **edit: I just put in the ballots i forgot and thats no longer the case so**~~ **edit 2: i added ghost back we are good** but dear god, it sucked to watch the comparison for this song to be ‚Äòwell its not better than american boy‚Äô 

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): this is so carefree and cute, i get nothing but positive energy and vibes from it.

---

# Besties list, I will buy all of you sorbet 

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): First-gen Caribbean excellence

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): this is great but I think it's up against a lot of heavy hitters this rate, I'm not sure it will last as long as people expect

**wavingwolves** (9.1): the title is right

**bespectacIed** (9): fun

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): this song did nothing wrong ever, except not be American Boy

**waluigiest** (9): it‚Äôs so pleasant

**ebooks #5454** (8.9): omg Garnet back with the SMASHA

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.7): what a gem! (pun intended) Mark Ronson killed it with production as usual

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i wanna call this mid but its kinda grown on me a lot every time ive listened through this playlist its such an earworm

**Mysario** (8.5): this song is magnificent xp

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): this is so fun and bouncy

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8): I love Steven Universe promo!

**kappyko** (8): it's cute !!! don't be haters

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): great production

**runaway3212** (8): I still want to explore estelle's discography at some point

**skargardin** (8): oh this is so much fun

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): this is nice, gets a bit tiresome by the end though

**vayyiqra** (8): Wherein we rate an Estelle song that is not "American Boy" for one and find out her other music is pretty good too.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Ugh I love her voice it‚Äôs like a nice warm and cozy blanket üòä

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.8): I mean, the title doesn't lie. Also, I don't really know why but is it weird that the chorus reminds me of that "con flores" song that was big on TikTok for like a week?

**bbfan132** (7.5): i enjoyed this!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Ooh, that production is so good. And the vocals too.

**TiltControls** (7.3): it's nice! Though I hate to say it but Kardinall Offishall kinda outshines Estelle here

**seanderlust** (7.2): I love the vibe of this one. two absolute legends collaborating - we love to see it.

**camerinian** (7): reggae is not my jame at all but this is decent, Estelle kills it as per usual and the percussion is super ramshackle in a charming way

**daretheghost** (7): Cute but sadly doesn‚Äôt leave much of an impression on me.

**frogaranaman** (7): can't believe we're gonna rate this entire album single by single thanks to these grab bag rates

**rslashpoopheads** (7): exactly queen

**starla\_** (6.9): I wish her vocals were more forward in the mix but this is good



**sage** (6.7): i love estelles voice but the actual song is just fine

#Comments I hate, I hope you trip over a small rock this week!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): it's‚Ä¶ ok... but if this went early I wouldn't be upset
**whoisValensi** (6.5): I was gonna say "Wow this aged pretty well" and then this Kardinal guy showed up. Was Sean Paul that expensive????

**Blisterman** (6): Estelle has some great non-American Boy songs. This isn't one.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is just okay

**hikkaru** (5.5): i can't help but compare it to the charity rate 2 winner which is one of the best songs ever

**futureisrealized** (5.3): The song doesn't really go anywhere, not really any high point.

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): WE GOTTA, NUMBER ONE VICTORY RO- wait this isn‚Äôt the right song sigh‚Ä¶

**flavasavavandal** (5): Maybe Estelle shouldn‚Äôt work with Canadian boys

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its no american boy

**throwaway-7650** (5): painfully lifeless I fear, even the feature can't save it

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this sounds like a deep cut from Music of the Sun

**steelstepladder** (4): this is gonna coast by on Estelle love but it‚Äôs not very good sorry :/

**joeeswift** (1): with songs like this I see why she was a one hit wonder

#I hope you trip over a big rock

**CrimsonROSET** (0): I‚Äôm sorry this is just‚Ä¶ not good. Like, the lyrics are nice, but it feels like her vocals just don‚Äôt fit with the song, in a very jarring way. And the guest verse is just an absolute snooze. Let tropical house die.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I heard this song awhile ago from the number one CRX fan who sent this and I don‚Äôt think it grabbed the first time I heard it but it slowly grew on me over time. It‚Äôs a solid indie pop groove

#The person with 34k scrobbles of crx

**whoisValensi** (11): What to say about Falling... What to say... Well I think I should start with, yes I'm giving my own submission an 11. Why? Because this is the only time I'll be able to give CRX an 11 in a rate on PH okay. Now to clear up some more shit, yes I have over 3k plays on this song (36k+ on the band overall lol). Okay now that I got all that out of the way I think I can actually talk about the song now. So this is actually my 4th favorite CRX song (Yes, 3 songs rank above this lol) but I figured it would do best among an audience of "Pop Music Fans" because it has some strong pop-song tendencies imo. So this was actually the second single off PEEK (I consider We're All Alone to be first), tho it had also technically been released before that. It was on the vinyl only 7' singles of Love Me Again which dropped in 2018 and that version is... different. Feel free to look it up on YouTube I titled it like " Falling (Original Version)" or smth like that. But basically there was stuff cut from that version to "trim the fat" which led to this version. I'll save you from the rest of the essay but just know I love both versions dearly. (Also I love this album as a whole but with a social media handle like @crxpeek that should be obvious...) I've already gone on for far too long but jesus christ I really do love this song, I love this album, I love this band. What else can I say without writing a fucking 1k word count essay lollll. But, I truly do hope you guys love this song too (or at least like it). So thank you Ratemas for giving me a chance to introduce a wider audience to this, like what I've wanted to do for a hot minute. If you like it, go check out the rest of the album, it's called 'PEEK'. Tho maybe don't go too close to 'New Skin' (their first record), unless you want a complete tonal shift into like idk "Modern Hard Rock"??? (I could also talk for eons about how that shift happened.) Oh an uhhhh thank you Nick, Darian, Jon, Ralph, and Brad for making this banger! üíôüíôüíô


#People CRX will be thanking for the extra 5$ in streams this month
**akanewasright** (10): Okay, but the bridge leading into the vocoder final chorus? That‚Äôs pop perfection

**Awkward\_King** (10): nick!! nick!! nick!! (referring to my friend, not the singer of this song)

**cremeebrulee** (10): this score isn‚Äôt even nickyola like this is a genuine bop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Aside from being king of visuals, this is really good!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): I wonder who submitted this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): consider this reparation for all the good nick has done for raters

**ReallyCreative** (10): expressing solidarity with my fellow passionate niche artist hype man

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the chorus hits and the vibe here is so good, garage rock but make it noir and sophisticated

**throwaway-7650** (10): in this house rate we support nick/will NOT tank men

**jasannn** (9.3): Nick has great taste wbk

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh this is SLICK

**daretheghost** (9): Someone aggressively promoted this in a rate a while back (no shade) and I wound up checking out the album and was really into it. Love the Elvis Costello vibe.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): this is kinda amaze wait

**runaway3212** (9): Almost as good as the poster made by the person who sent this

**vayyiqra** (9): This song is great in fact but Popheads won't like it because they won't get the new wave influences here and the very high IQ you need to understand the influence of B-52s and the Cars on this track. Nah I'm just making shit up here but still it's pretty good.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Carly Rae Xepsen with the Harry Styles tribute and dad rock aesthetic, we had no choice but to stan!

**TiltControls** (8.3): hmmm now who could've sent this??

**wavingwolves** (8.3): it bops

**2dina3dworld** (8): the vocalist kinda sounds like Harry Styles

**bbfan132** (8): ily nick

**Blisterman** (8): Bit of a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers feel to this one.

**nootnoot781** (8): carly rae xepsen

**skargardin** (8): bop alert!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Why do I actually like this more than the Harry Styles song? Only like a little bit more though.

**nonchalantthoughts** (7.7): good sound, but the vocals kind of ruined it

**starla\_** (7.6): this kinda slaps

**ebooks #5454** (7.5): bonus points for the mFing macys sheep

**sage** (7.1): bop

**1998tweety** (7): this was better than i expected

**bo\_g\_o** (7): it's good but florence + the machine and harry styles both outsold

**buddhacharm** (7): I've somehow come to learn that there is a person who has 36054 (and counting) scrobbles of this artist and I hope that they're having a lovely day and if they've been hired to their PR team yet

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the chorus kinda sounds like harry styles a bit

**thedoctordances1940** (7): it's just a 7 innit

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): I like the song on a surface level but it's basically a synthpop (or new wave? I'm not good with genres) song with 2000s emo lyrics. But then again I'm a big fan of After Laughter and CHVRCHES so can't bring myself to criticize it too much lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Love this sound! But the rest of it is ehhh it‚Äôs okay

# Watermelon Sugar Boy‚Äôs legal team

**NotWith10000Men** (6): feels pretty bland

**slimboyfriend** (6): I don't know how to explain it, but this sounds like it was made by a fake band

**lady\_sable** (5.5): his voice is kind of annoying sorry

**seanderlust** (5.5): I just want to say to WHOEVER sent this in that while this one didn't click with me personally, their stanning of CRX is completely valid and also Criminals by CRX goes off and I hope they still like me i'm so sorry nick whoever sent this

**bespectacIed** (5): who tf are half of the people in this rate lmfao

**camerinian** (5): "two thirds of the way down the festival poster/Today's Alternative playlist" core

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): It's a fairly mid slice of indie pop.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): my score keeps falling the longer this goes on

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): every time i've heard this song it's been against my will

**welcome2thejam** (4): Should probably be way more up my alley than it actually ended up being

**apatel27** (3): Oh look another faceless white middle class indie rock band

**kappyko** (3): i don't like his voice here

**ImADudeDuh** (2.5): yeah sorry, but out of all the CRX songs i‚Äôve heard in the past, this was my least favorite. Anderson East‚Äôs disco Falling >>>

**mudkip1** (2): i was unable to vibe

**Mysario** (0): stream the Remix which is actually good unlike this dumpster fire

**Roxieloxie** (8.6): bop!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): first thoughts ‚ÄúI need a charger big boy‚Äù (we love an iconic Reddit comment). Secondly, I really like the singers voice it‚Äôs very soothing. Don‚Äôt love GRAY‚Äôs part as much, but it doesn‚Äôt bring down the song.

---

**ebooks #5454** (11): i'll be completely honest: i did not care for a ratemas slot...i just wanted to play garlic phone üíÄ i only found this song a couple weeks ago while lurking my friend's playlist and LOOPED IT FOR DAYS (i used to really liked Hoody i lowkey forgot about her music). i looked up the m/v + lyrics and fell in love with the song even more. in the m/v, even tho GRAY is literally shooting up the basement, the lights flicker and for a few moments Hoody gets to experience the vibes of a chaotic party that all her peers get to go to but she's missing out on. for some reason that all really resonated with me. a lot of my friends are still in uni far from me; im worried i won't achieve my career passions; my partner and i split up (nothing awful, we're still friends, im just a lil sad at times); im too shy to tell my friend (mentioned earlier) how much i like them; the state of COVID and the world scares me a lot; and i moved back home üíÄ. in the song, Hoody sings about how exhausting life is: working hard, hoping for so much, and still struggling so much. she just wants to say goodbye to it all and escape. the song is upbeat considering the topic is sad and i think it really summarizes my end of 2021. i know new year hopes are a little superficial but i'd also like to say adios to everything bad and find my freedom like Hoody does. i knew whatever i picked wouldn't make it far in the rate so i picked this bc 1. kpop is quite well known so i wanted to show off krnb which usually isn't as well known and 2. its a song that really helped me emotionally be more hopeful for the future/get me out of a dark rut this year. i hoped with this pick, someone would find a new music sound they liked or perhaps if they're also having a rough time, it could also help them out emotionally. im very new to rates/popheads and am very grateful for this slot. i hope i can do more rates bc the couple i've done this year were really fun and sharing music is really cool! happy holidays popheads, i hope youre all well, and here's to a 2022 with good tidings and ofc great music.

**rslashpoopheads** (11): literally crack thank you whoever put this in the rate

**anothertown** (10): a bop on repeat

**bespectacIed** (10): TASTE my god.

**cremeebrulee** (10): love u ebookstie

**DefaultPophead** (10): Already loved GRAY, and now I love Hoody as well!

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this is so catchy

**runaway3212** (10): im losing my mind this is so good

**TiltControls** (9.5): I love her voice! GRAY's feature gets a little outshined, but it's not terrible

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Yep, it's a bop!

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): nice song, definitely a K-pop artist I could listen to more, it's not Soul Lady level of good however.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): me putting my white hoody in the wash with a black tshirt

**jasannn** (8.5): it gives me 88rising but in a good way.

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.2): that was good

**Blisterman** (8): Not gonna lie, the song title had me expecting a very different language.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i love this, it‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ chill, but like, in a cool way

**ReallyCreative** (8): a cute vibe

**skargardin** (8): bop

**SmileAndTears** (8): BOP

**vayyiqra** (8): Oh look I'm giving a high score to some flop girl with purple hair how predictable

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): amig√≥s

**waluigiest** (8): instant mood lifter

**bbfan132** (7.5): v relaxing to listen to!

**kappyko** (7.5): EVERGLOW????

**lady\_sable** (7.5): this is just very chill

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): cha cha malone I- anyway everglow outsold

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I really like her voice. And the feature is really great too.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.3): it's pretty and the rap makes it even better

**wavingwolves** (7.1): i need a charger big boy

**2dina3dworld** (7): Give me a two champ beat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): its cute

**whoisValensi** (7): This isn't 'ADIOS' by EVERGLOW. Real talk, every time I hear the Cha Cha Malone producer tag I think about the fucking /r/kpop post where the guy thought it was "I need a charger big boy" instead of "I need a Cha Cha beat, boy" [Here it is, btw.](https://redd.it/5g0cp8)

**celladonn** (6): This is cute in a boring kind of way

**daretheghost** (6): This kind of came and went and I forgot I was listening to it until the next song came on. Pleasant, but not much of an impression.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I feel latinobaited

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it's pleasant

**starla\_** (5.9): this is also okay

**camerinian** (5): I'm just not into most moody 2017 trap pop whatever the language, and the guest rapper does not help

**frogaranaman** (5): I thought it was the production person on this track for a second

**sage** (4.8): ok as a major kr&b stan i feel bad not giving this a good score but i do not like this at all, at least its inoffensive

**\_\_Avaritia** (3): A below passable K-Pop generic ass instrumental that is ruined by a subpar rap verse makes not a good song.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I will give credit to this song for having a nice instrumental, but this song actually has some of the most annoying vocals of all time for me. I cannot stand Kate‚Äôs voice here, it‚Äôs so shrieky and she refuses to sing in a straight line. And like this song is literally about the novel wuthering heights from the main characters perspective? I‚Äôll just keep listening to Running Up That Hill and none of her other songs I guess.

**Roxieloxie** (0): yeah im sorry i hate this as well

---

#People who are about to be real mad at us

**2dina3dworld** (11): honestly I could write an essay about why I love this song, but I will just leave you with my main two reasons for loving this song: it‚Äôs my most listened to song ever, and I just love Kate Bush

**babadork** (11): Are any of the other songs sung from the perspective of a melodramatic and annoying ghost that is trying to lure a man to his death AND/OR involve interpretive dance?

**1998tweety** (10): ill give the hag a 10

**Awkward\_King** (10): best song ever made yada yada can we talk abt the ACTUAL best song ever made which is the mary the first horrible histories parody of this

**bbfan132** (10): kate antis dni

**celladonn** (10): Emily Bront√´ who?

**daretheghost** (10): Completely overdramatic in the absolute best way.

**frogaranaman** (10): if I knew nothing about Kate Bush, I'd assume she was a massive racist based on how she sings

**mudkip1** (10): MATERIAL GWORL!!

**musical\_pyn** (10): if this was released today people would call it "the new dance monkey"

**Mysario** (10): this is the best comedy song of all time

**nt96** (10): Pop songwriting and composition at its finest

**plastichaxan** (10): i kinda want to 11 this but what if it wins and kick inside doesnt get a rate but if it doesnt get a rate and it still loses i cant deal with this i‚Äôm having a breakdown over this benji you‚Äôre kinda sick for this

**ReallyCreative** (10): imagine what the Kate Bush flair girls will do if this wins omg

**rslashpoopheads** (10): literary queen

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): outsold the book with such ease

**starla\_** (10): obviously a 10

**thedoctordances1940** (10): so true spill bestie

**vayyiqra** (10): can't help it I was born to be an art heaux

**waluigiest** (10): I live for how deliciously uncoverable this song is

**welcome2thejam** (10): I am so so sorry but any time I hear the name Heathcliff I think of the cartoon cat

**seanderlust** (9.7): I listened to this on a morning where it was snowy and I had nothing to do but sit on the couch, drink coffee and watch it. absolutely perfect

**akanewasright** (9.5): grinny

**anothertown** (9.5): Say what you will but many of your faves wish their head voice had this much control and resonance

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): I‚Äôm not giving this a 10 because I‚Äôm British and I‚Äôve been overexposed to Kate Bush most of my life

**nonchalantthoughts** (9.1): something about this song scratches a certain part of my brain, especially the beginning

**Blisterman** (9): Surely this will win? Would have given it a 10 if it didn't remind me of reading that tedious book in school.

**camerinian** (9): gotta respect a boundary breaking classic, even though you maybe also gotta have a certain level of irony to vibe with its weird ass edges

**cremeebrulee** (9): i hope the discord echo chamber is wrong on this song like it's GOOD!!!!!

**just\_thonking** (9): The electric guitar and strings at the end>>>>

**lady\_sable** (9): she has better songs, but also like. come on it's Kate Bush.

**runaway3212** (9): artpop wasn't the same after this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.9): Very hard to come up with any sort of comment for this song, it's just a masterpiece.

**slimboyfriend** (8.8): idk it's Kate Bush man

**jasannn** (8.7): I feel like I‚Äôm on a tightrope having the time of my life.

**MrMoodle** (8.5): sorry - it‚Äôs his song now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEgzpBjHe4Y

**wavingwolves** (8.5): how can i like a song that i find so annoying at the same time

**ebooks #5454** (8): this song felt like a lil elf toddled towards me and started serenading me and im quite charmed tbh (i have never listened to kate bush before but ik a lot of ppl like her)

**SmileAndTears** (8): if she didnt sound like a goat being strangled this song would be a 10/10

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): This song has never done much for me in terms of kate's stuff, maybe it's just my unfamiliarity with the source material, but at the same time I'm not familiar with the background of Cloudbusting at all and yet I love that so‚Ä¶ I don't know

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): I prefer a lot of Kate's later work to this song but it's still good

**skargardin** (7): This wasn't nearly as bad as the discord echo chamber made it up to be? What are you all on about?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): im sorry i just cannot stand kate bush‚Äôs voice in 99% of her songs. if literally anyone else was singing this i would probably give it a 10

**throwaway-7650** (7): it's giving allie X musical theater audition

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I actually don't mind this. I thought I was gonna hate it, but it's kinda good actually.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The first time I ever listened to this song (which I only did cause Popheads always praises it) I was utterly bewildered by it. It's such a strange piece of music. The chord progressions, the time signature, the lyrics, the surprisingly funky bass and guitar, the interpretive dance of Kate Bush in the music video‚Ä¶ why I found it just all so perplexing I ended up playing it over and over and over‚Ä¶ at the end of it all I can't say it's a song that I like, but it's a song where I always find something new to be fascinated by every time I listen to it. Maybe I'm just too American for it...

**futureisrealized** (6.5): Good production, don't like her voice.


# :Person_Standing:

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): this is my first time listening to Kate Bush and i'm not sure how i feel

**kappyko** (6): You know, there's a better artist who writes about a good book. [sits down on chair backwards] Have you ever heard of Hillsong United

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it's good but this is my first time hearing this song and i've seen so much hype for it that i expected it to astound me lmao...also her voice is kinda annoying here

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): everything but her vocals are great, but her voice is irritatingly high

**sage** (5.3): this is like fine

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): God I really hope this song doesn‚Äôt win the rate. I loved Hounds of Love and was ready to accept this with open arms as a new art pop classic, but the vocals are just annoying as hell, the instrumentation is fine but it‚Äôs just not pulling its weight neither.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i‚Äôm sorry her voice is way too high pitched

**static\_int\_husp** (4): sorry I usually like Kate Bush but this is bad

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): don't we have enough wacky screaming women in this rate?

=====

Roxieloxie: **whoisValensi** (3.5): Oh god I'm gonna get killed for this. But you know what, I'm gonna come out and say it, SOMETIMES I JUST DON'T LIKE KATE BUSH. I respect her but like jesus christ sometimes her voice bugs the over-loving SHIT outta me. This is one of the times. I can handle 'Running Up That Hill' and all that, but when she stays in that higher register for an entire song it just bugs me. Also I don't really like the rest of this song like... musically, ya know. I'm glad people love this song and all and I'm not looking forward to them holding this against me for the rest of my life, but this is my truth. Sorry to disappoint.

**Alumineous** (3): I heard so many things about this artist. I have seen the writeups about Kate on this subreddit. But this song... I just don't get it. I think it's because her voice sounds repulsive to me. I also can't see it growing for me. No hate to Kate Bush, but this is just not for me.

**TiltControls** (3): possibly gonna be an unpopular opinion here but really don't enjoy how Kate sounds on this song

**ImADudeDuh** (2.5): Kate Bush stans are finally getting oppressed in this rate, we love to see it

**bespectacIed** (2): never got the hype for this toxic af novel, this song, and kate bush for that matter

**oliviagodrigo** (2): she sounds like a dying cat

**SinfulAnarchy** (2): um‚Ä¶ the melody is pretty but why does she sound like elmo doing musical theatre

**NotWith10000Men** (1): i'd rather listen to snow white. and i hate snow white.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): these are the most annoying vocals ive heard in a while

**Roxieloxie** (10): I really enjoyed this one, It was a really nice discovery from the rate

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is really nice, brothers osbourne I think are really underrated duo. And in case you didn‚Äôt know, the lead singer TJ Osbourne is gay and this is apparently about one of his first loves! So we love that for him. Also check out Stay A Little Longer if you like this.

#Yee Fucking HAW

**Alumineous** (11): I quote from the Brothers Osborne Last.fm shoutbox, "WE FUCKING STAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I was not surprised to learn that one of these dudes is gay cause those sparkly syths‚Ä¶ this is country yaassified

**1998tweety** (10): wait this is nice tbh

**CarlieScion** (10): yeehaw

**DefaultPophead** (10): We stan our lgbtq+ country king and his ally brother!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yes this was my song. I‚Äôve been a fan of Brothers Osborne for years and liked this song, but wasn‚Äôt my favorite of theirs. After TJ came out in february, I was ecstatic and emotional. This song was one of the songs he explicitly said was written about his gay romance and I felt my 3rd eye open. The lack of pronouns in the song (and a lot of their love songs), them showing a gay couple among other straight couples in a different music video, and more little things suddenly became clear to me. I felt like Rapunzel in Tangled when she realized that she was painting suns all along. When I went to see them live this year, before performing this song, he took a break to talk about how much it meant to himself. He talked about having a heartbreak, but being unable to tell anyone about it and honestly I cried while in that concert when this was being performed. My only regret about this song is that it was finally 2021 and I didn‚Äôt have a summer romance with a boy that I knew was leaving soon but I grew far too attached to him before he left and now know I will never be able to rekindle that romance so I just live the rest of my life with a big ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù question lingering in my life. Fuck im so fucking GAY and LONELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**MrMoodle** (10): dammit this is gonna get robbed because it‚Äôs a country song which is so frustrating because it wouldn't have been robbed if everyone rating realised it was a gay country song, hoping this sub keeps up with random celebrity coming-outs enough to actually give this a chance

**Mysario** (10): better than Swift's "Drool Summer"

**seanderlust** (10): if I had a nickel for every time i've looked up a country act I liked and found out that at least one of the people involved was gay, I would have two nickels. which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it's happened twice (related: shoutout to brandy clark)

**SmileAndTears** (10): its a bop and one of them is ‚ú®gae‚ú® so its automatically a 10 idc idc

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): this feels so warm and lovely

**bbfan132** (9.5): this was really really good, could probably become a 10 for me in the future

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): fuck pop country for robbing us of this soundscape, also yas slay we love a gay country king

**bo\_g\_o** (9): gay anthem

**daretheghost** (9): So I know nothing about Brothers Osborne aside from the fact that one of the Brothers Osborne is gay and with that knowledge I am choosing to frame this song as being about one of those secret gay summer flings in small rural towns where you drive out into a cornfield and lay on the hood of a car and Talk About Feelings and I am very into that.

**ebooks #5454** (9): this boy looks like a lil SIMP i'd dom him

**musical\_pyn** (9): This song probably isn't actually a 9 but I KNOW popheads will rob anything remotely country so I want to give it at least something

**NotWith10000Men** (9): if anyone new to country likes this song, i'd recommend some of eric church's singles. a handful like springsteen and talladega feel/sound very similar to this

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): i didn't expect to like this so much

**welcome2thejam** (9): Luckily this caught me the year I started to dip my toes into country, cause I'm now all in on this kind of cowboy shit

**kappyko** (8.5): i actually really like reading this as gay coded

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): omg can't believe the Holislay rate finally got me to listen to Morgan Wallen!

**runaway3212** (8.5): country is good y'all are just cowards

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this is just a good song to begin with, and the backstory behind this makes it even more emotional

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): extra half a point for that chorus omfg

**TiltControls** (8.4): I just think that men

**wavingwolves** (8.3): this song being amazing for no reason omfg

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): I like the guitar, it's got a really dreamy sound, but in such a competitive rate I just can't give this a super high score

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): definitely has some flaws but also it's just a good ass country song so I won't complain

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): I just know that popheads is going to tank this song with 0s or something because it‚Äôs a male singer + country instrumental when actually this song is pretty compelling and enjoyable. The tastelessness I‚Äôm anticipating-

**CrimsonROSET** (8): when i say yee but you don‚Äôt say haw :pensive:

**frogaranaman** (8): people are gonna tank this song because it's country even though it's actually a Good country song. anyways for more country by gay men please check out Fancy Haygood

**nonchalantthoughts** (8): not a country person, but i found myself enjoying this song

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): r/pophead rating country. Oh boy this is gonna go over well....

**vayyiqra** (8): I wonder how many users will overlook this song because they think it's yet another bro-country song about women and pickups, and then don't know that it's a heartfelt song about lost love (and also it's gay). I read a Time article with the Osbourne brothers and I don't like country much but they seem like cool guys and this is a good song.

**whoisValensi** (8): I am familiar with Brothers Osborne because of 1 dude, and 1 dude only. That dude being ImADudeDuh and ya know what, I GET IT DUDE THEY'RE GOOD. This is what M*rgan W*llen wished he fucking did with '7 Summers'.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): thanks dude

**jasannn** (7.5): Thanks Kacey for warming me up to atmospheric country music.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): ü§†üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

**2dina3dworld** (7): I support gay cowboys



**MoonlightByWindow** (7): why do i actually like this...it's good!

**mudkip1** (7): we love an lgbt country king

**Blisterman** (7): Not three times as good as Morgan Wallen's 7 Summers.

#Fellas is it straight to have a summer romance with someone

**Stryxen** (6.8): it was so good but i unfortunately don‚Äôt like the vocals

**just\_thonking** (6.5): it's cute

**lady\_sable** (6): not super memorable imo, but enjoyable! I like his voice

**starla\_** (5.8): not my style of music, but not bad

**babadork** (5.5): This did grow on me as I listened to it more.

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): screams mediocrity to me, can't point out much to dislike but can't say what I like about it either

**futureisrealized** (4): Name a more iconic duo, country music and being awful.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2.5): I'm sorry but I don't think country/bro-country is really for me. I mean, with the obvious exception of like, some early Taylor Swift but that's about it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): this sure is a country song

**plastichaxan** (2): i promise this is not countryphobia and misandrism combined

**sage** (1.5): i cant stand any country singer that sounds like this (so like all of them)

**bespectacIed** (1): no to hick music pls

**buddhacharm** (0): I'm saur sorry like I understand the weight behind the song and all but I just ... can't it just grates üò≠

PrimaryCrusaders: Yeah‚Ä¶ I was one of those people that called it a ‚Äúbro-country‚Äù song. I don‚Äôt listen to a lot of country and I didn‚Äôt even know the brothers Osborne were gay, which makes this marginally better. I am truly sorry and I wholeheartedly apologise for my bro-country comment.

This comment was just me being a little passionate as I‚Äôm firmly anti-bro country & what it‚Äôs done for country musics perception because I do love the wider genre. Thanks for your message.

# Ive never seen this movie before so [Insert movie relevant good thing]


**Blisterman** (10): The funniest Christmas movie ever made.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): As someone named ‚Äúfrancisco‚Äù who had this movie played several times in school, i am owed financial compensation

**nt96** (10): South pole elves must be seething right now

**ReallyCreative** (10): imagine Zooey Deschanel trading 70% of her personality for a blonde wig and it's still a good movie? that's the power Elf has

**throwaway-7650** (10): it's not actually a 10 but it will be robbed I fear so inflation here we go

**TiltControls** (10): kinda overrated at times, but also still a solid 10

**welcome2thejam** (9): Probably more fond of this movie than it really deserves

**Mysario** (8.5): remember the scene where Buddy went into the bathroom where a naked woman was? what was Elf culture like where that just seemed normal to him?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): i have seen this like 5 times and remember nothing about it

**akanewasright** (8): my dad stans hard

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is unrelated to the actual movie but looked up will ferrell while trying to figure out my score for this movie and HE WAS THE MAN IN THE YELLOW HAT IN THE CURIOUS GEORGE MOVIE???

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): This movie is so awkward and cringe, but it's kinda good.

#Fell off their shelf 

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): if will ferrel was hot this film would b better

**frogaranaman** (6): good but overhyped methinks

**seanderlust** (6): any given millennial during holiday season: omg I looove elf! :heart-eyes: its my favorite christmas movie! :christmas-tree: I watch it every year but just because i'm weird lol :zany-face: :zany-face: :100:

**skargardin** (6): Dare I say overrated

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I think Will Ferrel is the least funny part of this movie

**vayyiqra** (5): I used to hate this movie but it does have some things going for it. It's kind of funny, kind of heartwarming, Zooey Deschanel is a QT. I guess it's okay. Still I do not like Will Ferrell when he acts like a manchild which is most of his roles, and there are a lot of cringe moments too. Overall it's okay I guess. I don't really care about it but don't mind if it's on.

**waluigiest** (5): overrated

**fadedblue09** (4.4): I‚Äôm gonna deduct two points from this Metascore cuz I remember really disliking this movie as a kid

**apatel27** (3): Jokes got old within the first 30 mins

**musical\_pyn** (3): actually not a good movie, sorry

**runaway3212** (2): I have never seen this one but it looks as creepy as those elf on the shelf horror thingies

**plastichaxan** (1): i can‚Äôt stand will ferrell

**Stryxen** (1): i cannot STAND this movie just watching it feels wrong and evil and blasphemous there‚Äôs something evil about this movie i hate it

**Roxieloxie** (10): Yetti presented the premise of doing a bonus rate to me around christmas movies, and I said yes but on the condition that I could include this. I‚Äôll be honest, the sheer concept of this existing is lowkey more absurd than the movie itself, that being said I will never get over getting people into beatsense and making them watch these and seeing their reactions. 

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this short film was way more serious that I thought it would be but also it‚Äôs so ridiculous too. I unfortunately don‚Äôt think it has much of a Christmas vibe outside it all happening at Christmas, but like why not spice up this rate. We have Die Hard here why not this

**akanewasright** (10): another 11

**agentofscranton** (5): this film has a higher rotten tomatoes score than eternals

**cremeebrulee** (2): i had to pretend like i had no idea what this was when my irl friends brought it up even though i had already watched it once when roxie first mentioned it. which lead me having to watch it a second time with them but i had to just sit there and act like i‚Äôve never seen it before

**vayyiqra** (2): It was kind of funny as a meme but it's also boring and has nothing to do with Christmas really.

**ebooks #5454** (1): i made the mistake of watching this (now i just want fried chicken) aLSO THERE WAS BARELY ANY HOLIDAY SPIRIT I FEEL RIPPED OFF

**kappyko** (1): this ruined my life.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): The superior version.v

**Mysario** (8.8): 2018 outsold

**ebooks #5454** (8.4): okay confession i never finished watching this and i know i said the animated version was good for being short but i think here it also works when the story is longer too. i didn't get far in the movie but the bullying plotline really adds to the depth of the story. i too was called a freak and bullied in grade school, also i told everyone santa was fake (not my fault bc my family didn't celebrate and i didn't realize it was a cultural thing to believe in santa) so i got yelled at real bad by the teacher and for so long i fucking hated christmas. i no longer do bc eventually my heart grew 3 sizes, but like yea maybe i'll go back and finish it bc for years i've wondered if the grinch every ends up with his crush.

**anothertown** (8): I feel like a lot of us now are sexual freaks because of this, for some reason or another. Sexy Who people, The Grinch his self, or Christine Baranski's titties, it‚Äôs equal opportunity for all.

**slimboyfriend** (8): Because it's bizarre

#Maybe Rates are good actually

**daretheghost** (11): Okay I know it‚Äôs Me and giving this an 11 is easy points but hear me out: The ARP synth evoking radar that gets less and less prominent as the song progresses. The sudden CRASH of bass notes around 2 minutes. ‚ÄúCrystal meth in meters of millions.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou said that you would find me, even in death.‚Äù And a personal aside: people give Tori‚Äôs husband a lot of shit for his guitar playing on her albums (and they do make some points) but the way the guitar wails like an ambulance siren after Tori asks ‚ÄúDo we conduct a search for this‚Äù is inspired and brilliant and elevates the song in such a way that I have to be a Mac Aladdin apologist for 7 minutes.

**DefaultPophead** (11): I only heard this song for the first time now, but it‚Äôs a worthy winner and I feel compelled to support it.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Hi @ whoever put this in the rate, was your goal to get people to check out Tori Amos despite the fact that you took a risk putting a fucking 7 minute track in this rate? Cos of the lush instrumentation and lovely singing? Because it worked.

# Tourist 

**lady\_sable** (11): literal chills

**1998tweety** (10): this is nice
**bbfan132** (10): probably will leave on day 1 but i‚Äôm ok with that - it‚Äôs a beautiful song and i wanted to pick an album track that probably won‚Äôt be rated again

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the toriamoficatiojn of popheads has been the most pleasant surprise of 2021

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I used to be able to see New York Tori, but now I can't cuz I moved :(

**plastichaxan** (10): god how does she have the power to make me feel things!!! and so many at once?

**rslashpoopheads** (10): queen of seeing no evil

**runaway3212** (10): This is so insanely beautiful and it's about not seeing new york... coincidence??? I think not

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Between this, Mother and the Little Earthquakes title track, Tori‚Äôs long songs are SO good. I used to always pay Gold Dust to Scarlet‚Äôs Walk compared to her other albums and that was a mistake!

**starla\_** (10): Tori is my queen

**throwaway-7650** (10): classic tori, when it's right it's right. 10

**waluigiest** (10): it‚Äôs grand and devastating and just a hell of a song

**whoisValensi** (10): I also cannot see New York because I'm in Florida. /s Real talk I've really grown to love Tori over these past few months and this is fantastic too. Tho I currently cannot shake the fact that I played 'Winter' while eating dinner the other night and my dad said she sounded like she was copying "P!nk's ballads"... I am the only person in this family with a brain.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): when you look at the playoffs of any major league sporting event

**akanewasright** (9): poohascend

**Awkward\_King** (9): wait same

**nt96** (9): Girl just fly there

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): wow this is gorgeous

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): The best way I can describe this track is it sounds like the kind of music you'd have playing when you're by yourself on a dark, cloudy day,and it's raining and you're on the top of a big hill where you can barely see the New York skyline through the heavy rain and fog. And you're gay.

**seanderlust** (8.7): this song about a plane crash causing death in new york was written pre-9/11 which...BOY, that's a rough coincidence

**camerinian** (8.5): this is very theatrical sounding (derogatory) but that grandness does work here so ya know that's cool

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): first thing I thought of was "wow this reminds me Wuthering Heights a lot", but I like her voice a lot more. The song doesn't feel long at all even though it goes on for seven minutes which is great. 1:57 was amazing

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Wow her voice is beautiful. I feel like I'm in a trance.

**ebooks #5454** (8): the bgm def outsells the lyrics here, but her voice is quite nice

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): Well that was quite a shift in tone from Tinashe

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): i did not know it was possible to have written a song so 9/11-coded before 9/11 happened

**Blisterman** (7): It's pretty, and moody, but the way she says certain phrases, I find really unpleasant.

**CarlieScion** (7): me too bitch

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): i like this actually

**RandomHypnotica** (7): me either tf

**skargardin** (7): A reminder of that I need to listen to more Tori

**TiltControls** (7): I think I preferred the tracks that were in Little Earthquakes, but this is still a nice sounding track

#Regulars

**kappyko** (6.5): Stevie Wonder writing "Living for the City":

**babadork** (6): I think this is one of Tori Amos‚Äô more overrated songs.

**bo\_g\_o** (6): I like parts of it but it's kinda long (this is coming from the same person who gave his 11 to impossible soul btw)

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I don't get it. She sounds pretty though.

**frogaranaman** (5): you can't but Omicron definitely can

**mudkip1** (5): someday i'll understand tori amos' appeal

**wavingwolves** (5): i can't see it either

**NotWith10000Men** (4.2): i, too, cannot see new york

**Mysario** (4): have you considered investing in binoculars?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): bitch me neither you aint special

**sage** (3.8): this isnt bad but i dont like it

**thedoctordances1940** (3.7): i don't really like this kind of piano stuff in the first place and when it's this long it starts to get really boring

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): i had this streaming in the background and i was like.. damn this woman has been prattling on for some time now and i check and it's not even HALFWAY OVER??????????

I‚Äôve only heard Little Earthquakes in full from Tori, but I adored that and want to check out more. I highly recommend it to the rest of y‚Äôall who loved the song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.6): okay so I was wondering why this was called fairy of shampoo and I googled the English lyrics and I still don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs called fairy of shampoo. Mostly cause of the shampoo part, is it cause the girl has nice hair I guess? Or is a shampoo commercial model? And for the actual song itself, it‚Äôs quite nice. I kind of wanted more from it though but it‚Äôs a nice listen. Also we love trumpet solos!

**Roxieloxie** (6.5): the trumpet is really good but I fear this is my least favorite kpop song in the rate, Im shocked this was the on that got so much of the fanfare around it, especially cause the shinee song was so good

---

# Poor little Meow meow 11s 

**bo\_g\_o** (11): the first trumpet solo convinced me this song was great and the second one convinced me it was the best song in the rate

**Islands** (11): probably the best kpop song of the 4th gen

**jasannn** (11): This ain‚Äôt no 2-in-1.

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): soobin put his whole bussy into this song

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): i was obsessed with this song when it came out and still love this mini album lol. although i don't up with txt as much as i used to, this is still one of my favorite k-pop b-sides and their whole dream chapter series has a place in my heart haha

**runaway3212** (11): when will music every reach this peak again? never. that's when.

**wavingwolves** (11): this song has been the biggest source of comfort i've gotten from music since it was released, so, naturally‚Ä¶

# The curtains are just blue

**1998tweety** (10): txt's songs are so good when the autotune is done well and the production isnt bad

**anothertown** (10): this song is so bizarre, i love it. has any other boy band song sounded more like it's about an ethereal shampoo woman.

**cherryices** (10): what scent do you think the shampoo has? i‚Äôm going oat milk & rice cream

**hikkaru** (10): for belb

**sage** (10): easiest 10 ever

**throwaway-7650** (10): 11 :soobcry: :soobcry_deluxe: [:soobcry: sticker]

**whoisValensi** (10): What a funny song name but what an actual City Pop inspired bop. One of these days I'll actually listen to TXT's discog and not just 'LO$ER=LO‚ô°ER' & '0X1=LOVESONG'.

**akanewasright** (9.5): I fear for the sub if this is day 1

**seanderlust** (9.3): okay I haven't interacted much with K-Pop outside of rates (I swear i'm getting to it there's just a lot of music okay!!!) but I think TXT overally is quickly becoming my personal favorite BG.

**daretheghost** (9): This is niiiiice.

**TiltControls** (9): I have no idea what 'Fairy of Shampoo' even means but I'm imagining the Great Fairies from TLOZ except with more soap bubbles in their fountain. Also this song is really really good!

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): wish the chorus was a lil more memorable, but i love love the dreamy vibes here

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): this perfectly fits the aesthetic of a shampoo commercial actually

**Uberpigeon** (8.3): oh this is actually good

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Can the fairy save a bad hair day though? Asking for a friend.

**Awkward\_King** (8): they put their whole belbussy into this one

**bbfan132** (8): a good song!

**Blisterman** (8): Bit frothy, but it's head and shoulders above most K Pop.

**just\_thonking** (8): mmmm horns

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Definitely one of the more out-there songs in this rate and not exactly one I was expecting from someone like TXT. Pretty funky. It's wild that they're signed to the same label as BTS.

**ReallyCreative** (8): the very breathy, airy falsetto for the vocals is not working for me, but everything else about this song is firing on all cylinders

**vayyiqra** (8): I was going to give this a high score kind of as a "bit" because I saw the Kpopheads say they like it and thought it might be a meme song like Jopping, but now it turns out I do in fact like it. It's different.

**waluigiest** (8): the trumpet is an inspired choice

**ebooks #5454** (7.9): i like it but uh what does it mean

**babadork** (7.8): I found a dance video instead of an official video. Based on this, Yeonjun is obviously the one to stan with no other knowledge of the band. I stan all air instrument players. Sartorially, I am intrigued by the layered button-down shirts one of the others is wearing.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I don't get the hype. But the FREAKING SAX THOUGH! The sax bumped up the score ngl.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she‚Äôs cute

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the whiplash from the plane crash song into a song about falling in love with a girl in a shampoo commercial

**rslashpoopheads** (7): we vibing

**welcome2thejam** (7): What Zelda game is she in?


#I dont care

**camerinian** (6.5): love that trumpet line, but these guys sound so fucking bored lol

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): i just wish they hadn't sang on this at all, the melodies are funky

**starla\_** (6.1): this is weird but good

**2dina3dworld** (6): wow, I love dreampop

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Babes I love you but what are you even talking about? Okay, apparently it‚Äôs a reference to a famous poem or something? I always feel weird having to do outside research to understand a song

**NotWith10000Men** (5): the trumpets are nice but the rest of the song is boring

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): now what the fuck is a fairy of shampoo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): is fairy of shampoo supposed to be a‚Ä¶romantic pet name? if someone called me their fairy of shampoo i dont know what i would think but i certainly wouldnt think its romantic

**fadedblue09** (2): this was such a snooze and that vocoder? awf

**Roxieloxie** (9): And so we end the day off with the loss of more 11s! This was top ten at some point but unfortunately for the dad rock stans, it was not enough

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I don‚Äôt really love the singers voice it, I‚Äôm honestly getting dad rock vibes from it. Although the production is neat at moments (and reminds me of black skinhead by Kanye at points) it doesn‚Äôt really save the song for me

---

#Once again im really sorry to you all

**\_\_Avaritia** (11): Okay so here is where I‚Äôm busting out the essay, but if you skip this I don‚Äôt care, if this song gets eliminated Day 1 or whatever I don‚Äôt care, if you don‚Äôt care that I don‚Äôt care guess what? I also do not care, because this song is just everything. It might be paradoxical but there is just something so 80s (well, 90s technically, but almost something in between at least) in how it just harkens back to that gothic-inspired synthpop that shit like Tainted Love resided in, but also something that is so fucking TIMELESS about how it integrates various shades of post-punk, country rock, electronic dance music, pop. What results is one of the crowning jewels, if not THE definitive crowning jewel, of the already flawless Violator, a fully certified dark banger that makes you want to dance, stomp your foot, rock it out with an air guitar, doing it all with the nonchalant coolness that your shitty knock-off Ray Bans can make you pretend you have. And admittedly, this song probably does not sound like it works on paper. The guitar riff really just sounds like something a country band would create in the weaning stages of their career as they branch into rock. Dave Gahan‚Äôs vocals are mostly cold and devoid of emotion, like he‚Äôs not even trying to get you to move. The song structure is just kind of all over the place. And you would think these are points against this record, but here‚Äôs the thing - they are absolutely not. The production is rough but that‚Äôs what gives it that sort of nostalgic yet somewhat menacing edge, only enhanced by Dave‚Äôs singing, coming off with an almost casually commanding aura that comes to a head with every ‚ÄúReach out, touch faith‚Äù. The vast number of influences it pulls from may have been cast from a wide net, but to meld them so effortlessly into one gothic synthpop rager is just only a show of this song‚Äôs strengths,.what with these laser-like synths just blipping away as the percussion thumps away like a military procession or blasts off like pillowy gunshots (I really cannot describe it, but they still sound so good). And of course there are 2 passages here that are just the highlights of possibly the entire history of synthpop, the first shorter passage being this exhilarating breathing section as Dave puffs away, usually such things would NOT work here but it somehow DOES?! And then of course there is just that super 80s-kind of synthpop breakdown that transpires in the last third of the song, the part where I literally cannot help but turn the volume up ALL the way and just dance to it. Honestly though, listen to Violator especially if you liked this song, the whole record is just banger after banger, all killer no filler, and yet this one somehow manages to stand tall as the magnum opus of Depeche Mode‚Äôs discography and possibly the 80s/90s. It‚Äôs just such a delight all the way through, and it somehow makes you feel cool while rocking out to what is essentially the precursor of EDM. I just wished that synthpop of this era all sounded like this, man!

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Not generally a big Depeche Mode fan, but always loved the riff in this one

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Goth banger and pop classic at once, who was doing it like Depeche Mode in 1989?? No one!! This song is immediately hooky with that iconic opening line, before plunging into the guitar riff and shuffling beat that injected rock edginess into the band‚Äôs synthpop style and revitalized their career. It‚Äôs full of inviting yet sinister layers, whether you interpret it as a blasphemous commentary on organized religion, a genuinely devoted love song, the saviour complex of a megalomaniac, or straight-up gospel as Johnny Cash did. Perfect for Christmas! I think this has a similar pespective (but very different energy) to Tori Amos‚Äô Crucify, both songs using religious themes to explore the darker side of flexing your own selflessness."

**SFbby** (11): A perfect mix between drums, synthesizers, and Martin Gore's voice commanding you to "Reach out to touch faith"

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): I listened to the entirety of Violator this past week for the first time so this is kinda recency bias but this manages to stand out even in that amazing album

# Blessed

**2dina3dworld** (10): Enjoy the Silence outsold but Depeche Mode is peak bussypopping 80s synthpop anyway

**anothertown** (10): reach out and touch the SLAY button

**bbfan132** (10): i prefer enjoy the silence but both are 10s

**bo\_g\_o** (10): REACH OUT AND TOUCH FAITH

**CarlieScion** (10): I just realised exes and ohs by Elle king has the exact same melody

**frogaranaman** (10): my personal Jesus is definitely a bear

**ImADudeDuh** (10): you ever get so religious and kind that you do a turn around and sound incredibly horny?

**Mysario** (10): Depeche Mode can't miss

**nootnoot781** (10): violator is such a good album

**plastichaxan** (10): classic

**ReallyCreative** (10): it's amazing and fun but it's also the exact kind of music the most obnoxious men in the world hold as the greatest work of art despite it being a repetitive, catchy, generic (non-derogatory) pop rock song of the era, like this is just The Black Keys with a head start boys let's calm down

**runaway3212** (10): I surprisingly really loved this it's so intense

**starla\_** (10): teenage me is screaming rn

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): god we need a new wave rate so bad

**vayyiqra** (10): I am once again asking why every gothic pop/rock song with a shuffle beat is good, but perhaps some questions don't need answers.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Do you accept Personal Jesus as your Lord and Savior?

**whoisValensi** (10): DADS AROUND THE WORLD RISE. üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Now I've seen some people giving this song shit and I. Don't. Get. It. Maybe I'm some quirky bitch because I was raised on the sounds of the 80s/90s before my parents decided that country radio is cool for some reason. But like this is the good shit. I got love for Depeche Mode and this album. Like... who else was gonna serve leather cowboy religion-soaked kinda gay realness???? So yeah I love this one a lot. (Also could have had a chance at being my 11 if it wasn't for... ya know lol.)

**celladonn** (9.5): The beat and that twanging guitar are so good

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): I‚Äôm not giving this a 10 because I‚Äôm British and I‚Äôve been overexposed to this for my entire life

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): I always thought Depeche Mode was kind of fruity because they make synthpop bangers and have this song about being Jesus, who is inherently queer

**seanderlust** (9.1): i'm not gonna sit here and tell you that one of the 500 best songs of all time per rolling stone is less than a 9.

Roxieloxie: **Blisterman** (9): Will Popheads overcome their resistance to any song with Jesus in the title?

**kappyko** (9): this bury a friend rip off üôÑ

**camerinian** (8.5): god that groove is airtight. I wish it was built on a bit more than it is with other instrumentation but like it is a jump up slapper all by itself so

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): really liking this i've been meaning to listen to more depeche mode actually...

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): it's a classic, fuck the haters

**just\_thonking** (8): Policy of Truth would have gotten a 10 but this is nice too

**nonchalantthoughts** (8): cool song! reminds me of new wave music, a little too long though

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This bangs honestly. It's definitely a precursor to the kind of swag-rock you'd hear in like, car commercials or Guga Foods videos for sure.

**skargardin** (8): Wait.. it's THIS song omg

**TiltControls** (8): 'reach out and touch faith' is my new response to cursed hornyposting

**akanewasright** (7.5): OH THIS SONG

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**letsallpoo** (7): hilary duff ended them

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I dunno... sounds a bit GAY to me!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Take Me To Church outsold...

**cherryices** (6.9): bottom half of violator i‚Äôm afraid!

# Only interested in the church aesthetically 

**NotWith10000Men** (6.6): the singer sounds very uninteresting

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): 16 year old suburban kids in the 80s listening to depeche mode as if they were in a leather club in berlin

**mudkip1** (6): this sounds kinky and unapologetically queer. like basement orgy room bdsm music. or am i getting the wrong vibe

**pantomime15** (6): The intro sounded like a car commercial. But the song itself is pretty good, especially the electronic parts.

**DefaultPophead** (5): The longer it went, the more the score dropped.

**ebooks #5454** (5): dadcore rock

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I don‚Äôt get it

**bespectacIed** (4): or whatever lorde said

**SmileAndTears** (4): a song, i guess

**throwaway-7650** (3): the dad rock energy is too strong #sorry

**Uberpigeon** (1): car ad music

**wavingwolves** (1): the way jesus was kind of a gay icon if you think about it...

**bookthieving** (0): i can't stand that repetitive guitar riff sorry

vayyiqra: maybe surprising but it didn't sample it; however i think the influence is clear

also random fact there *is* a remix of black skinhead that 1. interpolates "everybody wants to rule the world" by tears for fears and 2. it's sung by miley cyrus
