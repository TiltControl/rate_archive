**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): I totally get why she is the opening act on Olivia‚Äôs tour, her vibe fits perfectly. I could see her blowing up in the future. Anyway this is a good song, I just don‚Äôt love the vocals riffs in the beginning and the end.

**Roxieloxie** (6): okay I promise its out for real this time
---
#Comments that we have absolutely never seen before 


**futureisrealized** (11): Stellar production, paired with a memorable chorus makes Dover Beach a true experience to listen to.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Whoever put this in the rate, fuck you for baiting my 10, fuck you for making it work, and yeah fuck you for this great ass song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): girl put the phone down he isn't thinkinf abt you

**CarlieScion** (10): this girl is a swiftie

**CrimsonROSET** (10): screaming in poetry is a mood

**ebooks #5454** (10): new cool artist found, time to stream all her music and make that my personality for an entire day

**fadedblue09** (10): This is very Cher Lloyd-ish [complimentary]

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://gfycat.com/PoisedFailingBarnswallow

**just\_thonking** (10): this is gonna get viciously robbed but I submitted it so I hope at least one person enjoys discovering it. It's a perfect pop song!

**letsallpoo** (10): song of the year

**pantomime15** (10): Ooooh that chorus is perfection.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this feels like if Olivia Rodrigo wrote Style but she's British

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I am listening to this on a much nicer beach but the thought is appreciated.

**seanderlust** (10): this is kind of giving me style by taylor in the instrumental and just the fact that it feels like a flawlessly executed air-tight mid-tempo pop song. easy 10, 11 contender tbh.

**TiltControls** (10): started out as a cute 7 but then it picks up so much steam

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Wow! That was so good! Easily my fav! This is going into my daily playlist.

**akanewasright** (9.7): This is getting a lot of love from the #rates channel in the discord so lemme just say - check out more of her music if you like this! Want Me is incredible, You Shaped Hole is great, and I really liked her new song, Wannabe.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.6): reminds me of Style for some reason, nevertheless has very catchy melodies, a fun chorus and I didn't expect the outro to be this good either

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): i wish i liked this project more than i actually did (baby queen has yet to top ‚Äúwant me‚Äù imo) but this is definitely a standout

**kappyko** (9.5): For the sake of fitting it into a lyric she had to remove "Ben"

**jman457** (9.2): Damn this is a huge bop

**steelstepladder** (9.2): OHHH THIS SONG!

**bo\_g\_o** (9): end credits music to a coming of age movie (non-derogatory)

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): she‚Äôs cute, but she shouldn‚Äôt have been in the bonus rate for the 2020 EP rate instead of Olivia O‚ÄôBrien yes I‚Äôm still bitter about this

**babadork** (8.9): ‚ÄúIf I could I‚Äôd cry, we‚Äôve got/ incompatible star signs‚Äù

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): a surprisingly fun bop

**rickikardashian** (8.5): my friend ben has the same last name as this beach

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): cute (non-derogatory)

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this sounds like it could be in a microsoft surface commercial in 2013 (complimentary)

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): bop

**1998tweety** (8): this sounds like "let's take a road trip to a cabin" music, but it bops

**2dina3dworld** (8): this is cute

**bbfan132** (8): this brings me back to 2018-era ph

**camerinian** (8): this is such a cute bop omg

**celladonn** (8): This is fun!

**daretheghost** (8): I feel like I remember a fair amount of buzz around Baby Queen but I‚Äôve never checked her out. This is fun! That scene in a teen movie where the protagonist is destroying all the things that remind her of her ex with her friends catharsis type vibe.

**runaway3212** (8): This man sounds like he's not worth such an amazing song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): that last chorus‚Ä¶its the smasha!!!

**Uberpigeon** (8): its boppy

**vayyiqra** (8): A "bop"! I might check out her other work now.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Jepsen-esque

**Mysario** (7.8): In Stefan Collini's opinion, "Dover Beach" is a difficult poem to analyze, and some of its passages and metaphors have become so well known that they are hard to see with "fresh eyes".

**hikkaru** (7.5): this is very cute, baby queen once again being a nice rate discovery

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): cute bop. wish it was a little punchier

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): cute but sounds kind of faceless, like it was created from a random indie-pop generator

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): It's very coming of age teen movie trailer

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): white woman synthpop moment (see: iris)

**bulforster** (7.2): Mirages are actually caused by the refraction of light from a physical object so the person she wants to push is actually stalking her, just from further than she thinks.

**Blisterman** (7): Never heard this before, but it sounds like fairly standard 2010s pop. And it came out in 2021.

**jasannn** (7): sounds like background for a senior year compilation youtube video

**joeeswift** (7): cute af!

**lady\_sable** (7): cute and catchy!

**musical\_pyn** (7): this chorus is immaculate but there isn't much else going on

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): As much as this is a major bop, this also sounds like the type of song that would instantly get oversaturated in TV ads and kids films (see also: American Authors' Best Day of My Life).

**skargardin** (7): This is cute but I'm already fearing how hellishly overrated this is going to end up being

**whoisValensi** (6.5): Why am I semi-bored right now??? Can someone explain that to me pls????

**anothertown** (6): was this supposed to sound like something

**bespectacIed** (6): fun basic pop

**DaHumanTorch** (6): it was cute but very h&m

**welcome2thejam** (6): A bit Basic Synthpop 101 but it has enough charm to win me over and a soaring chorus.

**sage** (5.8): i feel nothing but its not bad

**nonchalantthoughts** (4.9): too basic and she sings in cursive

**starla\_** (4.5): kinda boring ngl

**frogaranaman** (4): sounds a bit like a Taylor Swift song

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): it's giving ad music

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): I thought we were done with bedroom pop in the TikTok rate

#Stem Coded

**akanewasright** (11): This album has like‚Ä¶ 0 chance of being rated ever, because it wasn‚Äôt a big hit or anything, and I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that good overall. But I really wanted this song to be rated, because it means a whole lot to me, and kinda helped to get me through one of the worst points of my life. So I wanted to lead a few more people to it after falling in love with it myself. It does what I think any truly great song does - the sonics of it perfectly capture a feeling. In this case‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the feeling of reaching for a lost love and not getting through. I didn‚Äôt want to 11 my own submission, but I‚Äôm coming up on 200 plays of this song, I kind of have to

**Awkward\_King** (10): idk what kinda science she studied but this depressing as hell i hope she ok

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this isn‚Äôt gonna win but it deserves to be Top 10

**kappyko** (10): reminders >>> BUT it's excellent

**mudkip1** (10): bop!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is literally dripping with divinity

**ReallyCreative** (10): we love women in stem

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): we love women in STEM

**welcome2thejam** (10): Stunning song. So perfectly wistful and bittersweet, kinda just have to sit and drown in the emotion of it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.8): https://i.imgur.com/ecf1w1F.gif

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Like if Camila Cabello found production that was actually compelling and unique and dreamy and out of this world and excellent, and her vocal chops actually, you know, there?

**starla\_** (9.2): I think she is super underrated

**bbfan132** (9): :glitterfloating:

**Blisterman** (9): Recently discovered this. Sorry Popheads but this is the only Mariah, I'll be playing this Christmas.

**camerinian** (9): man this is just dreamy, it sounds like a Jamie xx beat. I'd not heard this before the rate but I really wanna sit with it cos I feel you really could get in your feels to this

**runaway3212** (9): did you know mariah the scientist shares her name with famous scientist mariah carey of always be my baby fame

**NotWith10000Men** (8.8): her voice is lovely

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): This is the first I'm song I've heard from her and there's something so modern about her cadence and melodic delivery, but something so classic about her voice. I want to smoke a blunt with whoever submitted this.

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is nice

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): yet another horrible person that makes bops in this rate sob

**daretheghost** (8.5): Have I been sleeping on Mariah the Scientist? I think so.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): uuuuuu

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.4): pretty good

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this was so short! What the fuck!

**ebooks #5454** (8): this girl sings in more cursive than sza

**frogaranaman** (8): so effortlessly fun

**skargardin** (8): I should properly listen to this album sometimes soon

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): 2 you more like 8 you. wait no that sounds wrong i dont condone vore

**throwaway-7650** (8): requesting akane to pretend this is a 10 (add 2)

**Uberpigeon** (8): its vibes

**wavingwolves** (7.8): to me????

**TiltControls** (7.5): I like the vibe! I wish parts of it stuck out a bit more (mostly the chorus), but it's really good!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Her voice is so smooth. This is so good. I really like this one.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this is cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs cute‚Ä¶ but I wish it got bigger by the end, you know? It‚Äôs rather quiet

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.7): I love the chopped-up vocals in the background. This one isn't too bad honestly.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): it was alright

**sage** (6.3): cute

#Theater kids

**jman457** (6): pretty mid, couldn't really get into it

**bo\_g\_o** (5): I just kinda find this song boring

**whoisValensi** (5): I wanna like this song, but alas, it is mid to me. Maybe it just sounds too Ari-Wannabe (...Or is this what Ariana keeps trying to be, idk both might apply.) to me idk. But wow this song is like mid-est of mid in this rate so far to me.

**thisusernameisntlong** (4.2): the vocals sound bland and there isn't a lot going on melodically either, the vocal samples (is that what it's called? the ah-ah-ah-ah in the background) are irritating

**MrMoodle** (4): ‚Äúnow i lay it in a grave, now i‚Äôm all covered in dirt‚Äù is such a funny lyric to me, like oh well fuck me i was down in this hole making this totally super profound metaphor and now there‚Äôs mud and shit everywhere, just my fucking luck right

**Roxieloxie** (8): This got really good towards the end, I enjoyed it alot

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I love the production on the song it‚Äôs super interesting with all the different sounds. The song is lacking energy for me though, like I keep waiting for a big moment and it‚Äôs just kind of one note, and then it‚Äôs shrinks back down to the beginning levels at the end. Give me a stereotypical song structure!!!

---

#Idk who romy is but i hope they deliver that album yall want

**TragicKingdom1** (11): great atmosphere and a slow build throughout the song without dragging at any point which is very impressive songwriting!!

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): The Rest is Noise would be my 11 but this is still good to not give a 10. Sultry, strangely a little gloomy yet somewhat hopeful, simple piano chords that really just touch an emotional side. Those last few lyrics by Romy too are just a fucking dagger to the heart.

**bespectacIed** (10): 11 contender my god. this album is flawless

**Blisterman** (10): That moment when the "I have never reached the top" sample comes in.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): this is euphoric

**camerinian** (10): This is a festival anthem for the ages. Drink water, dive into the crowd, find a friend, lose your mind, and look out for each other when the comedown hits

**cremeebrulee** (10): has jamie thought about collabing with this romy girl more often? they sound so good together

**frogaranaman** (10): me when I get overstimulated

**jman457** (10): an immaculate dance track

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i published a fic on ao3 with the title being a lyric from this song so it HAS to be a 10!

**mudkip1** (10): romy being in two songs for this rate omg i know that's mf right

**nootnoot781** (10): high key deserves to win

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I‚Äôm ascending

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): i feel weird elevening my own song but it's gonna need all the points it can get lol

**skargardin** (10): Jamie xx / The xx comeback when??

**TiltControls** (10): would've been an 11 if not for a different Romy track taking it. Still an amazing song, and we really need to do a proper In Colour rate at some point!

**waluigiest** (10): the yassification of the xx

**welcome2thejam** (10): Stellar production and Romy's voice combines so well with it. In love with the little clinking bell sounds on the second verse. And the start of the second chorus? I ascend

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.8): The beeps and the boops are really pleasing. Seriously I don't even know what kind of music this is but it's really weirdly energetic and I can't stop listening

**bbfan132** (9.5): i used to find this kind of boring but i think i get it now. brings me back to 2015/2016

**kappyko** (9.5): Me crying over my boyfriend going to the gay club without me because I was too tired to go

**Mysario** (9.5): love how this is basically a "The xx" song in all but name

**ebooks #5454** (9.2): i apologize to whoever sent this when i said i thought this was a song from the Trolls soundtrack because the covers looked similar

**starla\_** (9.2): where is the new album Jamie pls

**2dina3dworld** (9): this is Brian Eno for popheads

**anothertown** (9): a vybe..

**celladonn** (9): There's a lovely bittersweet beauty to this

**daretheghost** (9): I love this‚Äìand it‚Äôs someone I‚Äôve been meaning to check out for a while, a trend with this rate‚Ä¶

**ImADudeDuh** (9): very good! And I normally hate loud places!

**Uberpigeon** (9): i love a windchime ass song

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): Proof that The Xx need to make louder osngs

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): You should probably bring some earplugs next time you go to those loud places, Romy!

**throwaway-7650** (8): I thought the start was halsey - strangers at first

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): the xx and loud are not two phrases I correlate with each other

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's nice and maybe in a different context I'd like it more, but overall this is a little underwhelming

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Whitney Houston - Higher Love

**seanderlust** (7.5): this feels like it should be a 10/10 for me because it feels right up my alley, but it's just kinda not and I can't put my finger on why

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I really like the sound of this one! It's so good!

**whoisValensi** (7.5): I actually really hate loud places, Romy... So that wasn't me. (Shout out bitches w/ social anxiety yeet.) Great song tho!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): oh I forgot about this as soon as it ended

**nonchalantthoughts** (7): it's solid


#A Quiet Place

**vayyiqra** (7): My ex hates the xx. She said they were mediocre. I have barely heard the xx. This is like, okay. I can see where she was coming from though. It's not bad but it's kind of lacking energy somehow.

**sage** (6.2): wouldve been a point or 2 higher if it was shorter

**runaway3212** (6): This grew off me extremely quickly, it's cute but not for me

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Sounds kinda boring for a song called ‚ÄúLoud Places‚Äù

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): can they FUCK already

**NotWith10000Men** (4): very boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): for a song called loud places it sure isnt very loud sounding

**Stryxen** (2): I cannot force myself anymore to pretend i enjoy anything the xx has ever made

**Roxieloxie** (10): Rapsody is an absolute legend 

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): for a 7 minute song, this doesn‚Äôt drag as much as I thought it would. This is nice, Anderson paak fits great here and the solo switch up at the end is great

---

#Everybody

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): None of the three -heads subs deserve Rapsody. The features here are an incredible meeting of the minds. Black Thought and Rapsody in the same song is actually unreal.

**2dina3dworld** (10): politically conscious rap is a wonderful sub genre, especially when it‚Äôs so personal in the way this song is. Rapsody really presents her own thoughts and experiences in a way that‚Äôs relatable and poetic.

**bbfan132** (10): one of the best discoveries for sure

**bespectacIed** (10): perfect

**sage** (10): so good, this and never will know my fav discoveries of this rate

**whoisValensi** (9.5): Conscious rap my beloved that I need to listen to more of. Fantastic features all around on this one. This truthfully doesn't feel like it's 7 minutes long, even with that switch-up in the middle. Lovely submission you have here, whoever sent this.

**starla\_** (9.2): wow this is gorgeous

**bo\_g\_o** (9): okay this is great but for whatever reason half of this song is missing on genius?

**camerinian** (9): Anderson Paak could sing a train timetable and I'd give it a high score

**frogaranaman** (9): this is gonna be robbed so fucking hard I can already see it

**seanderlust** (9): god i love rapsody. this particular song loses a point or so just because the longer run time makes it a little meandering - I would argue that parts one and two should stay separated since they're only kind of related

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Ooh, that flow! This is so good. It didn't even feel like 7 minutes. Wow.

**wavingwolves** (8.9): something something mitski

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.8): good song

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): this is gonna be robbed isn't it

**daretheghost** (8.5): I don‚Äôt love the last verse but the rest of it is great and insightful.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Sure it's long, but it pays off well

**NotWith10000Men** (8.3): i like the beat and .paak's part

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): that transition to the last part really threw me, I thought I was on a whole new song

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): this song is so good you need to read it

**futureisrealized** (8): Great song overall, could have been a couple minutes shorter.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): and J Cole? NOT in the rate! She wins again

**jman457** (8): drags a bit but I really the way it ends

**kappyko** (8): This is really good

**lady\_sable** (8): that was a whole experience

**Mysario** (8): 2014 really was the worst year and no year could be worse

**ReallyCreative** (8): the cancer line is a little yikes but everything else is great :woeis:

**SmileAndTears** (8): something something mitski idk

**vayyiqra** (8): This is quite a jam and made good use of all its features

**welcome2thejam** (8): Always up for an Anderson .Paak cameo, and what a great track to do it on. That said, why don't any of the lyric sites have any of the last third of this song?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Did the person that chose this song do so because Rapsody mentions "making it clap to Waka Flocka last christmas"?

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): snapshitting

**runaway3212** (7.5): this is great but way too long

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): it does drag but rapsody is so good in this, she carries

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): The 3 points would have been recovered if this was just a concise banger ass track that didn‚Äôt take its time to meander in the second half.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): honestly, this is just a lot.

**musical\_pyn** (7): a seven and a half minute long rap song? Popheads will love this

**static\_int\_husp** (7): like it until after Black Thought's verse, then it kinda loses it for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): anderson .paak is the best part about this song tbh

#Tomatoes for all of you

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The first half‚Äôs pretty good. The second half sounds‚Ä¶ unnecessary‚Ä¶

**ebooks #5454** (6.8): this was nice maybe a tad bit long now i dont have an attention span

**SinfulAnarchy** (6.5): i was not expecting that switch-up

**babadork** (6.3): It would have been better if it stopped after Black Thought‚Äôs verse. As someone that hates most social media, I wish my biggest complaint was that people share too much.

**Blisterman** (6): This is the sort of Hip-Hop that people use to convince people that ‚ÄúHip-Hop is real art‚Äù. Lots of words. Jazzy production. Conscious lyrics. But it‚Äôs too long, and Rapsody‚Äôs clunky over wordy flow is like nails on a chalk board to me.

**Uberpigeon** (5): ok im sorry for robbing this maybe but i found this very boring.. maybe if it wasnt so long

**thisusernameisntlong** (3.9): unnecessarily long, especially the part after the second chorus feels like it has been going on forever. the first two verses are not interesting, the third rap verse is a bit better but after that it's a confusing mess. Anderson. Paak's chorus is the highlight but it's not a very high one at that

**Roxieloxie** (10): Im gonna be honest, Im not sure about how I feel about shinee doing njs, like this is literally a new edition song, but i will save my thots for another day. Outside of that, this is probably my favorite kpop song in the rate

**ignitethephoenix** (9): SHINee always comes through with a fun bop. This isn‚Äôt my favorite song from them but it‚Äôs still great.

---


# 1 of 1 ( the times this was winning the rate)

**hikkaru** (11): this is one of my fave kpop songs ever, incredibly underrated imo, and it was a little disappointing that it wasn't in the bg rate so i'm happy to be able to submit it here, hopefully it can escape the bottom 10 i beg

# Infinite Girls

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**akanewasright** (10): if this was in the bg rate, it would have been my 11. Hell, it damn well could have been my 11 here. This is straight up one of my favorite kpop songs and an incredible slice of modern new Jack swing flavored pop. I hope to hell it makes day 2

**bo\_g\_o** (10): at least I still get to rate a song with taemin in it (stream criminal)

**ebooks #5454** (10): mhm delicious, smooches for them all

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok this slaps

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of their best titles actually and better than the stupid song that won the rate i hosted i won't even say her name cause it's free publicity.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): shinee always hits

**sage** (10): not my fav shinee song but still a 10

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this slaps

**throwaway-7650** (10): you did so well jonghyun üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô

**wavingwolves** (10): more like 10 of 10 am i right ladies. also fuck you u/hikkaru

**whoisValensi** (10): "It's okay I've already given SHINee an 11 this year!" - Me, for the past 2 weeks. Yeah if I hadn't had sent Falling, this would have been my 11. I go way back with SHINee, like 7 years back to be exact, so I was around for this era. And WOW what an era still. This is the "standard" of New Jack Swing/Retro K-Pop songs for me. Also I literally own this album. Highly recommend checking out the rest of it, my favs from the album are 'U Need Me', 'Don't Stop', and 'SHIFT'. In the infamous chants of Shawols waiting for encores, SHINEE! WOOT! WOOT! SHINEE! WOOT! WOOT!

**babadork** (9.5): The most 90s video that wasn‚Äôt actually made in the 90s.

**Mysario** (9.1): for those who need the lyrics translated, it goes "we out here drippin' in finesse, it don't make no sense, out here drippin' in finesse, you know it, you know it"

**bbfan132** (9): this totally bops

**bespectacIed** (9): quings

**jasannn** (9): minho‚Äôs rap is actually pretty good here

**lady\_sable** (9): shout out to the only boy group i fw

**ReallyCreative** (9): the Amazon cart after I load up Normani's discography without guest features/collaborations

**rslashpoopheads** (9): an absolute vibe

**runaway3212** (9): very weak Shinee song

**bulforster** (8.9): Well if the universe is infinite, as some physicists hypothesise, the girl would not be unique because in the infinite universe there would be the same arrangement of atoms infinite times forming infinite exact copies of her.

**jman457** (8.6): I actually really like this, I could see Bruno Mars doing this

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): this is groovy as hell

**daretheghost** (8.5): The 90s vibe is fun but I wish it leaned a little more into the new jack swing, one of my late-80s-early-90s weaknesses.

**kappyko** (8.5): This ends the yassification streak but continues the bop streak

**TiltControls** (8.4): this is really fun!

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.3): nothing wrong with some catchy K-pop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): I feel like I've heard it a hundred times before but idc it's still cute

**camerinian** (8): ok this is kind of a serve. Let's go new jack k-swing

**frogaranaman** (8): SM stands for SHINee Mgood

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): yeah, the second half of this rate is definitely stronger than the first

**vayyiqra** (8): I need to stop sleeping on Kpop boy groups because this is a bop

**waluigiest** (8): if you told me this was Paula Abdul, I‚Äôd believe you

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): Is this vaguely New Jack Swing??? Ok!!!!!!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.7): It's a pretty good mix of new-jack-swing and modern pop. Probably not the best song from SHINee's title-track catalogue but it's definitely up there with the likes of Replay and Good Evening. RIP Jonghyun, god I miss you :(

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Was tempted to say that this was like BTS‚Äô Dynamite but if it had personality, but then I realized this came out 4-5 years before that song and I cannot help but wonder if we regressed or something.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): 1 OF 1 GIRL!!!!!

**celladonn** (7): SHINee are always good but this is one of their least memorable title tracks imo

**welcome2thejam** (7): A bright, fun bop!

#New jackphobia

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I thought this was a Silk Sonic song when it first started

**Blisterman** (6): Never really works when a throwback song is to beholden to the original sound without offering something new. Why listen to this when I can still listen to Guy or Bell Biv Devoe?

**NotWith10000Men** (6): it's okay

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is so ridiculously cheesy

**starla\_** (5.6): yeah alright

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): if you fed an ai 1000 hours of kpop and asked it to write its own kpop song itd sound like this

**anothertown** (4): okayy and here i thought bruno mars was making the most soulless new jack swing in the industry

**apatel27** (4): sounds so generic

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): wow the autotuned vocals on this are really bad‚Ä¶ this sounds like Bruno Mars rejected it for being too derivative

**ignitethephoenix** (8): a fun action movie that sure I‚Äôll consider a christmas movie since it is soundtracked by christmas music and happens on almost christmas. Alan Rickman was iconic in it too. Now only if Bruce Willis wore shoes this whole movie (sorry Roxie that this is all you know about this movie )

**Roxieloxie** (7): Okay so i know that its a really big debate about if this is a christmas movie or not, but i‚Äôve never seen it so I have no horse in the disk. That being said, Yetti tried to explain the plot of this to me a few nights ago and how some guy not wearing shoes is like a huge plot point or something??? Why???? I cant get over that, i may never watch this movie now

---

**agentofscranton** (10): when i was 13 and questioning my sexuality i thought that liking die hard stopped me from being gay (it did not)

**frogaranaman** (10): Die Hard is my favorite Christmas movie actually

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): something something jake from brooklyn nine nine

**vayyiqra** (9): While a great movie, I am going to be not like other guys and take the brave and controversial stand that this is not a Christmas movie, it is just a movie set around Christmastime. Notice that nobody argues that The Hunt for Red October is a Christmas movie even though it is set around the same time. Why Die Hard then? Have some consistency here. Still a good movie though. I love action movies. yippie-ki-yay

**welcome2thejam** (9): Can't believe I'm being forced into the role of insufferable man who insists Die Hard is the best Christmas movie of all time, but I suppose this is my burden to carry

**jman457** (8.3): maybe masculinity is good actually

**CrimsonROSET** (8): yes this is a christmas movie

**plastichaxan** (8): -2 points cause straight men enjoy this

**Blisterman** (7): Is it a Christmas movie? It came out in July. So what? Miracle on 34th Street came out in May.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): The internet has ruined so much

**Stryxen** (7): overrated as hellll but still a good movie uunfortunately

**akanewasright** (2): This is not a Christmas movie!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): die hard isnt actually that bad a movie. if i was giving it an objective rating itd probably be like a 7-7.5. but i am firmly in the ‚Äúdie hard is not a christmas movie‚Äù camp and as such i cannot give it a good score in a ‚Äúchristmas‚Äù movie rate

**joeeswift** (10): number 2 is better. You cant beat NYC at xmas

**SFbby** (10): LOL this is the only movie I've watched on this list

**skargardin** (10): It just never gets old

**thedoctordances1940** (10): In the trap, I'll stay on my own // I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): This movie is in my top 10 fav mpvies of all time list!

**DaHumanTorch** (9): minus 1 because of seeing macaulay caulkin as a sexually fluid vampire prostitute in the recent AHS season

**plastichaxan** (9): classic

**runaway3212** (9): yasss, slayyyy those burglars kevin!!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): i have never seen this in full, only bits and pieces, and yet i still wonder just how much you have to fuck up to forget a CHILD

**frogaranaman** (8): I always wanted to set those traps up just because

**Mysario** (8): Home Alone 2 is still more fun IMO but this holds up

**seanderlust** (8): catherine o'hara I love you

**vayyiqra** (8): Even though it's full of alleged plot holes and movies with child actors are often weak, this is still a classic. Also I like that the old guy that Kevin thought was scary turned out to be a good guy and was looking out for him the whole time. Important lesson!

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): overrated but not bad

**ebooks #5454** (7): a little overrated in my opinion but that's bc my grade school played this so many times (even not during the holidays) that i got kinda sick of it. the church scene with the scary neighbor always gets me in the feels though.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): overrated but at least its not the one with trump in it +1 point

**akanewasright** (6): I have nostalgia but I think I‚Äôd hate it if I watched again

**anothertown** (6): it‚Äôs fine but it's become bible status for a certain type of white 80s baby that I can't stand

**Awkward\_King** (6): just move

**throwaway-7650** (6): fun fact: kevin is married to and has a kid with london tipton

**jman457** (5.8): The second one oldsold! This ones pretty eh.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): can we watch the entire vsauce video as a shitpoost

**wavingwolves** (5): ok

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): white male power trip

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is probably the best classic Christmas movie. I mean it‚Äôs kind of dark but like I think it‚Äôs the most memorable and actually holds up

**Roxieloxie** (7): Alright so i‚Äôve never seen this but i‚Äôve seen it referenced in enough shows ~~and fics on ao3~~ that I have good gist of it. Honestly, I think its interesting and makes me think about alot of different things. And hey whats the holiday season without a little existentialism am i right ladies 

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): I have family who would be very disappointed in me if I gave it less than ten so‚Ä¶

**Awkward\_King** (10): HE DIES ??

**Blisterman** (10): A movie that hits me harder every time I watch it.

**jman457** (10): A classic for american cinema for a reason

**RandomHypnotica** (10): honestly still a really sweet movie

**runaway3212** (10): the donald duck comic based of of this movie was amze

**vayyiqra** (10): This movie has a lot of haters and I find that weird. Is it just overexposure? The religious themes? Because it's old and kind of corny? Idc, I think it holds up. Don't overthink it. It's just a classic.

**Mysario** (9): I've never seen the original and can't imagine most here have but the premise is amazing

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): "Oh Daddy! üò≠üò≠üò≠" is the only thing I remember from watching this movie.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): is it?

**seanderlust** (6.5): the simpsons parody where the angel shows homer that everyone's life is tangibly better without him outsold

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): unrealistic movie. if i was never born i highly doubt it wouldve cause my town to turn into a dump

**akanewasright** (5.1): I was the lead in a play adaptation of this in high school. >!I was also kind of suicidal during that time, partially caused by the subject matter!< so like‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt say I have nostalgia. But it‚Äôs good

**plastichaxan** (5): straight

**ReallyCreative** (3): the lies we were told, even as children!!

**Roxieloxie** (7): I also havent seen this all the way through, but I also dont remember much about it from what ive seen

**akanewasright** (10): an 11

**Awkward\_King** (10): BASED

**CrimsonROSET** (10): king shit, pumpkin king shit more specifically

**DaHumanTorch** (10): YEPPP WE DIED....this movie is incredible

**kappyko** (10): vibes.

**Mysario** (10): would fuel Hot Topic stock for years to come

**RandomHypnotica** (10): something something april from parks and rec

**runaway3212** (10): THE FUCK??? THE FUCK??? THE FUCK IS IN THE AIR??? THE FUCK??? THERE"S WHITE SHIT IN THE AIR???

**seanderlust** (10): it's a ten so i'm rating it such but this is a halloween movie idc idc

**ImADudeDuh** (9): emo kids made several points

**skargardin** (9): classic

**anothertown** (8.5): I SENSE THERE's SOMETHING IN THE WIND THAT FEELS LIKE TRAGEDYS AT HAND AND THOUGH I'D LIKE TO STAND BY HIM CAN'T SHAKE THIS FEELING THAT I HAVE! THE WORST IS JUST AROUND THE BEND... AND DOES HE NOTICE? MY FEELINGS FOR HIM? AND WILL HE SEE? HOW MUCH HE MEANS TO ME? I THINK IT'S NOT TO BE.......

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I honestly think I've seen this movie once? But I liked it!

**Blisterman** (8): Such incredible animation. It‚Äôs a wonderful world they‚Äôve created, that just feels great to immerse yourself into.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Tim Burton did not direct this! He wrote the children‚Äôs book it was based on but the entire creative team is other people!

**plastichaxan** (8): no cause the jointslay of my favorite holidays into one movie is so smart

**welcome2thejam** (8): My brother would kill me if I gave this a bad rating so I‚Äôll settle for the respectable 8

**jman457** (7.5): love it, but its a halloween movie not an xmas one

**vayyiqra** (7): I like it, it has some good music, but the animation is kind of ugly and it's barely a Christmas movie. Emo kids can have it, I'm okay with never watching it again.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I recently watched the whole thing for the first time and‚Ä¶ it was nice? But I didn‚Äôt really get it

**apatel27** (6): Not emo enough for this

**CarlieScion** (6): halloween movie, not christmas

**frogaranaman** (6): scary

**ReallyCreative** (6): I hated this movie as a kid, but it's not that bad.

**agentofscranton** (4): i despise this movie i can't even explain it i just hate it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i strongly believe that if this movie never existed emo kids as we know it wouldnt have existed either

**ebooks #5454** (3): this had so much potential to be good but for the love of god the plot gets so hard to pay attention to after jack sings about christmas to the halloween town. like why are some kids randomly trying to murder him in the middle?? i was just really angry and confused and disappointed

**Roxieloxie** (9): i love disco

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): oh wow this is such an amazing nighttime vibe. The house inspired production is amazing and Rochelle works so well with it. I think I‚Äôd definitely need to check out this album afterwards.

---

#I think this is disco

**kappyko** (11): This is the yassification streak of songs

**ReallyCreative** (11): No song this year has quite resonated me quite like this one. As someone still newly aboard the "Kelela Come Back" train, Rochelle's album from this year, Play With the Changes, fills a niche so desperately missed. That said, Rochelle isn't just harking back to Kelela's brand of house-R+B fusion perfection, she's doing her own thing and it's such a delight. The way the synths come in after her ridiculous vocals on the bridge is just transcendent!!

**bespectacIed** (10): TASTE, this album is perfect btw. Stream play with the changes uglies!!!!!!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this album deserves so much more recognition! in my top 10 albums this year it's so amazing and this is a highlight from it

**daretheghost** (10): One of my favorite songs (and albums) of the last year. I am very grateful to the Popheads I Trust for having this album on their weekly 5x5s.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is simply Black excellence

**plastichaxan** (10): BOP

**sage** (10): one of the best songs of the year

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): a moody bop, Rochelle deserves the acclaim

**throwaway-7650** (10): this WASHES the rest of the album

**vayyiqra** (10): E t h e r e a l music and alternative R&B is one of my favourite genres so. Wait she lived in Toronto too? Now I am helpless, I have to 10 it. Rochelle notice me

**waluigiest** (10): oh man I want to be at a dark sweaty dance party

**wavingwolves** (10): werq?

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): this is my favourite ratemas discovery, this is so gorgeous

**akanewasright** (9.5): Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz throwing ass be like

**starla\_** (9.3): WOW I love this

**TiltControls** (9.2): I need to remember to listen to this album cause based on what I've heard it sounds fantastic

**1998tweety** (9): its giving puss

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Yeah this is probably the best song from Play with the Changes, good job @ whoever chose this track! Slick ass instrumentation that is just a big vibe above all else.

**anothertown** (9): this is sooo nice. Looking forward to listening to this album asap.

**bbfan132** (9): i have been meaning to listen to this for the longest time and i‚Äôm glad i finally did

**Blisterman** (9): I love this moody dark club RnB. Sure, it‚Äôs well worn territory by now, but the execution is great.

**camerinian** (9): I swear I don't mean this as a drag when I say this is really good bougie second-hand retail music

**NotWith10000Men** (9): will definitely be checking out this artist!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): i should finally listen to this album huh [2]

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): What people say when they see me dance...

**jman457** (8.4): no thoughts just vibes

**bo\_g\_o** (8): smooth

**CrimsonROSET** (8): everybody dancing dancing crazy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This, right here, is a whole-ass vibe. Definitely sounds so much like Disclosure that I'm surprised this wasn't produced by them. The whole album is truly amazing, you should definitely check out Love You Good for some slick liquid DnB/RnB vibes (please collab with Pinkpantheress next queen).

**rslashpoopheads** (8): teeny bopping

**welcome2thejam** (8): A Dumbo drop bop of a chorus

**whoisValensi** (8): It's me, I'm the elephant in the room. Look at me dance. (I can't dance. But if I could, I'd dance to this.)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.8): me watching that one scene from winnie the pooh with the heffalumps

**seanderlust** (7.7): idk it's pretty enough but I don't feel likely to return to it anytime soon

**ImADudeDuh** (7): me when I choose an elephant avatar in plug.dj and someone plays a song that i have to woot

**skargardin** (7): Ooh this is interesting, I'm curious to check out her other stuff now

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A song that would have been improved immensely by not having the word ‚Äúelephant‚Äù in it. But it‚Äôs good nonetheless

#Wallflowers 

**runaway3212** (6): this is a big yass but it could use a little bit more slay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this sounds like one of those royalty free songs that would play over a ‚Äútry not to be satisfied‚Äù youtube video

**fadedblue09** (5): not awful but god this house sound is really getting repetitive for this rate. Apologies but someone has to be the sacrificial lamb of my wrath

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): neither the melody nor the lyrics draw me into the song at all, gave this one a lot of listens over the course of these two days and it never left an impression

**Awkward\_King** (3): rc im sorry i promise im just not crazy abt this and this isnt for u getting mad at our team on codenames

**Roxieloxie** (9): I need to get into angel more, but i‚Äôve loved all the stuff i‚Äôve heard

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): so I‚Äôve heard all mirrors before which I really like. This song isn‚Äôt grasping me as much as that one though. The big moment at the end is a bit too cluttered and noisy for me. It‚Äôs not as entrancing and cinematic as I hoped it would be. Still a solid song

---

#Supporting the sapphics 

**bbfan132** (11): best song of all time.

**jman457** (11): One of my all time favorite songs, the strings send me to another dimension

**mudkip1** (11): i'm sure popheads will hate this but what they don't know is that this is actually one of the greatest songs of all time period

**pheromenos** (11): dream on, dream onnnn

**slimboyfriend** (11): I love Angel Olsen because she has an old-time-y voice that always sounds like it's coming straight out of an AM radio and even when it's backed up by a chorus of strings it sounds like she's the only one in the room sing-mumbling her heart out. Everyone please be nice to her in this rate because as you can hear, she has a lot of feelings.

**starla\_** (11): my queen. one of the best albums of all time imo

**Stryxen** (11): i dont know a more cathartic moment to scream than WHAT ABOUT MY DREAAAAAAAMS

#The Dreamers

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece

**bespectacIed** (10): crazy how this sprawling, grand masterpiece is only the 2nd best song on all mirrors??? (number 1 is Chance btw)

**DaHumanTorch** (10): wait because this was incredible and is the first time i'm listening to her...all mirrors streamings are imminent

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): geez i wonder who submitted this!

**ReallyCreative** (10): if you tank this you are sapphobic and you need a shower!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): too powerful!!

**skargardin** (10): Niki DID make some points about this song

**Uberpigeon** (10): we love niki <3

**waluigiest** (10): this song is an epic.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a song that makes me feel like i'm floating in the wide open ocean

**whoisValensi** (10): I'll be honest, I should listen to more Angel Olsen. There's just something about the way she conveys things with her voice, especially emotion. Like wow... She has a certain passion that's like... to die for. I don't think I've hated any Angel Olsen song I've heard yet so like, yeah.

**TiltControls** (9.7): LARK!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.6): Why don't I listen to Angel Olsen more ugh

**futureisrealized** (9.5): Beautiful production, Angel's voice is so good.

**lady\_sable** (9.5): sorry I was an orchestra kid I'm biased towards anything with a banger string arrangement. I went progressively more Ape Shitt during the last two minutes of this.

**flavasavavandal** (9): I remember back in 2019 when this got released as a pre-release single to All Mirrors, and I enjoyed it so much I was getting hyped for the album, then it was released and it sounded like every other pretty but empty art pop album so of course p4k gave it an 8.9

**kappyko** (9): me throughout most of the song: idk this isn't hitting :[ me when the last climax stars: aw fuck yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**runaway3212** (9): I love this entire album but I keep always coming back to this one, it's so simple but beautiful at the same time

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): Poignant song but Chance would‚Äôve been an eleven‚Ä¶ the part where the instrumental gets loud is just a grating wall of noise but it‚Äôs still good

**throwaway-7650** (9): tori kind of did it better with ICSYN but this is still a slay

**vayyiqra** (9): This is such a strong and dramatic opener and it's unabashedly going for Art Pop with capital letters, and it worked.

**babadork** (8.6): I like Angel Olsen more the closer she comes to screaming.

**sage** (8.3): the buildup its giving

**Awkward\_King** (8): she put her whole angussy into this one

**bo\_g\_o** (8): sounds grand and majestic

**CrimsonROSET** (8): god this is a great shout song

**frogaranaman** (8): sounds like an Angel Olsen song!

**jasannn** (8): the moments when the production gets louder is a yassss moment

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): I really like the build up of this towards the end, but overall it just doesn't really do it for me, sorry niki :(

**daretheghost** (7.5): I tried to give this album a shot a while ago since everyone was raving about it and I wasn‚Äôt really into it despite Angel Olsen being one of those artists who is right up my alley. Then I never listened to it again. And now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs the way this sounds like she‚Äôs playing at the bottom of the Grand Canyon while I‚Äôm at the top? I don‚Äôt remember if that was the vibe for the rest of the album.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): the outro is amazing and the whole song builds up to it in a nice way, but that doesn't mean the first chorus is rather weak, not feeling much from this one

**NotWith10000Men** (7.2): i need to listen to this one again with headphones when i'm not doing a silly rate on this subreddit i love so much

**anothertown** (7): i don't remember anything of what just happened other than the strings, I like ominous horror strings in pop songs

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I'm sorry, but I've never been able to get into this type of genre. The instrumental is gorgeous though.

**welcome2thejam** (7): I'm a sucker for a nice epic build. Put some nice strings on it and zoo wee mama

#Another case of longsongphobia

**nonchalantthoughts** (6.9): too long

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): You know I feel like for a 6 minute song if you‚Äôre going to have multiple build-ups you‚Äôd at least have some gratifying pay-off that would make it worth the listen. I like the production overall but the blue-balling and bad songwriting makes it hard to like it.

**Blisterman** (6): Too slow and plodding for my tastes.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I turned my volume up really loud because the first fifteen seconds of this was silence and I thought something was wrong, fortunately there was no audio jumpscare because this track is so soft anyways. Anyways I think Angel Olsen is gay, right? So I really wish this didn‚Äôt bore me

**hikkaru** (6): i wish it exploded a bit sooner but it sounds pretty

**SmileAndTears** (6): I just don't get angel olsen :/

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I was getting into it in the beginning but halfway through I got bored

**celladonn** (5.5): Much as I try I just can't really get into Angel Olsen's music. I can recognize that this is good but something about her sound just rubs my ears the wrong way

**ImADudeDuh** (5): honestly, I expected to like this more

**joeeswift** (5): I couldn‚Äôt click with this. it does sound pretty though

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): I'm sorry but again, imo it's kinda mid.

**rickikardashian** (5): she‚Äôs singing in simlish

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I'm gonna be honest if you tell me you're an Angel Olsen fan I just kinda assume you have 3 feral cats and haven't showered in a week

**ebooks #5454** (4): great m/v visuals, song was interesting to follow

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): so this is what angel olsen sounds like huh. not missing much

**fadedblue09** (3): surprised this song isn't getting slander like Wuthering heights

**Mysario** (3): I listened to this while talking with my co-worker and idk which I wanted to end first

**Roxieloxie** (10): Fun fact! This song had a 3rd 11 but the person never responded about a missing score so we could not accept their ballot

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it‚Äôs a classic and some parts of this I really love (like the middle section) but it just takes awhile to get there . I do want to attempt to learn this on piano now so maybe it made a point

---

#Im way too tired to go separate and sort out the debussy comments so just sit here

**anothertown** (11): hot girls remember Rika Kihira's 2017-18 short program

**frogaranaman** (11): this is up there with Pollen U for favorite moments of chaos I've done in popheads rates

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**akanewasright** (10): fuck it, I support the bussy man

**bbfan132** (10): ily frog for submitting this

**bespectacIed** (10): you tellin me a shrimp clawed this bussy

**cremeebrulee** (10): SMASH!!! I LOVE TWILIGHT!!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is the clit of the rate, danganronpa fans DNI

**daretheghost** (10): Falling water and twinkling stars.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Overexposed, but A for effort

**DefaultPophead** (10): I'm more of a Liszt and Tchaikovsky woman, and I think Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun is his best piece, but Clair de lune is stunning.

**flavasavavandal** (10): good but could use some Che Guevara and a disco beat

**jman457** (10): A really beautiful song, that really can be played at any moment from existential crisis, to a wedding, to a funeral.

**just\_thonking** (10): automatic 10 I don't make the rules. It's literally Claredy Loon

**letsallpoo** (10): BOP!

**musical\_pyn** (10): levitating ft. dabussy

**Mysario** (10): poppin my Debussy to this

**nootnoot781** (10): how many comments are you know‚Ä¶ making the obvious joke?

**NotWith10000Men** (10): r/popheads: "i can't pop my dubussy to this"

**nt96** (10): Imagine Debussy being here and seeing his masterpiece being rated against a song about sex work, Santa being accused of homophobia and Azealia Banks. Don't even get me started on his name. He must be so proud!

**plastichaxan** (10): y‚Äôall tanking this clearly don‚Äôt know how hard it is to play the piano with your bussy and it shows

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): thank you Mr. Debussy.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): https://i.imgur.com/lyJ6X4N.png

**sage** (10): amaze

**skargardin** (10): [Insert bussy comment here]

**throwaway-7650** (10): lo-fi beats

**TiltControls** (10): Chapter 1 still hurts

**vayyiqra** (10): If you don't feel something to this song you might not be human. (No I am not going to make any jokes about this.)

**waluigiest** (10): when is the 19/20th Century Impressionism Ultimate Rate?

**wavingwolves** (10): you're telling me edward cullen sent this in??

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.9): I would've probably given this a lower rating if it wasn't the first stage in Sayonara Wild Hearts, the game that made me seek out more pop music and introduced me to Carly, Charli and many more artists (basically the start of my pophead era). It's definitely overused (I recently lost my shit during my DR v3 playthrough when this started playing lol) but it's still beautiful.

**celladonn** (9.5): Several points were made

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): the first classical music rate when??

**starla\_** (9.1): timeless. can't wait for all the 'bussy' jokes, but not witty enough to make a good one myself

**Blisterman** (9): Famously, Janelle Monae sampled this throwback anthem in Say You'll Go.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not gonna be the only one to mention this but it‚Äôs so weird to me that Debussy is the name of a classical composer and not a gay SoundCloud rapper

**hikkaru** (9): edward cullen won a rate spot omfg

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): He put his whole Debussy into that song...

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Extra points for being probably the only song in this rate I can study to

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.8): nice piano

**agentofscranton** (8.5): beethoven outsold with fur elise teebs debussy stans stay pressed

**jasannn** (8.5): Wow, La La Land‚Äôs soundtrack was so good.

**seanderlust** (8.2): plus 1 point for being nice enough to give us all a secure password with this title

**bo\_g\_o** (8): (insert bussy joke here)

**camerinian** (8): this would be a straight 11 if I was in the womb right now

**lady\_sable** (8): he did in fact put his whole debussy into this

**slimboyfriend** (8): it's really pretty, but idk I haven't heard anyone talk about her in a really long time so I think she's kind of a flop :/

**whoisValensi** (7.5): It is 10pm and I am shaking ass to Clair de lune.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I swear there is a bussy joke somewhere to be made but I‚Äôm just thinning how the fuck this man have 4 or more songs on his Spotify named Claire De Lune?? So, what is the truth???

**Awkward\_King** (7): bussy

**DaHumanTorch** (7): +1 for bussy

**joeeswift** (7): yesss this made me pop my debussy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Not usually a classical piano kinda person but this is actually not too bad, I like it. Go stream The Seduction of Claude Debussy by the Art of Noise btw it's a great album.

**ReallyCreative** (7): do we want to talk about how there are like 4 "versions" of this on Spotify, each with different stream totals? Bussy

**SmileAndTears** (6.9): https://twitter.com/qfizzics/status/1419387102618394633?s=20

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): so nice of stephenie meyer and the twilight production team to give this struggling indie artist some coin <3

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): felt this one in the tkussy

**apatel27** (6): Never understood the hype behind this piece. Reverie is just better in every way

**CarlieScion** (6): bellas lullaby outsold

**kappyko** (6): He put his whole Suite bergamasqussy into this!

**pheromenos** (6): pleasant listen but what

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Popping my Debussy

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): how many comments are going to be like "im popping my debussy" or something

**bulforster** (5.4): Well as astrophysics tells us, the moon doesn't actually produce its own luminescence, so it should be 'lumi√®re du soleil refl√©t√©e par la lune'

**2dina3dworld** (5): Greensleeves outsold, L plus ratio

**welcome2thejam** (5): The sun outsold

**rickikardashian** (4): idk how to rate this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): gay dababy be like debussy

**thedoctordances1940** (3.4): No he didn't put his whole debussy into this. First of all, he's not even playing the instrument so he's not a real musician. Secondly, if he did put his whole debussy into it, he would've had ag cook produce it :pussyeyeroll:.

# Non debussy comments

**ImADudeDuh** (3): he put his whole decock in this (score represents length tho :/)

**runaway3212** (3): this is boring even for classical music standards

**SinfulAnarchy** (3): dated

**Uberpigeon** (1): this is like a chromatica interlude but a full song? not sure it really works tbh...

**ebooks #5454** (0): so i kinda like hate classical piano pieces?? like there's too many keys being played at once and it makes my anxiety go brr

**rslashpoopheads** (0): this song was added as a honey pot trap to uncover all the D*ngan fans

**ignitethephoenix** (9): okay this is super fun. This is definitely one of my favorite songs in this rate that I didn‚Äôt hear beforehand.


---

**sage** (11): one of the best kpop songs ever, anticipating all kpop here going out bottom 15 even though theyre easily all top 10 in the rate

**throwaway-7650** (11): going into ratemas I was hoping to fall in love with another song so I wouldn't have to 11 my own submission but in the end this still gets it. aside from just being an incredible song, I will unfortunately not be giving my 11 to WJSN in smackdown (if I had another 11 I would give it to save me, save you) so I want to make up for it by giving them the 11 here

**1998tweety** (10): omg experimental BOP

**2dina3dworld** (10): I‚Äôm a space girl and proud!

**agentofscranton** (10): worried this isn't for the 'this is good for k-pop!!' crowd. robbery imminent i fear

**akanewasright** (10): This is actually amazing. I honestly thought about 11ing it, and considering the competition here‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs fucking incredible

**anothertown** (10): WJSN has an insanely solid discography stream them

**bespectacIed** (10): we just sold nothing might be the definition of kpop mid, but they got the occasional serves like this Itaewon gay club classique

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of the best kpop songs ever! an easy 11 contender...absolutely crack infused

**hikkaru** (10): bsotm (b side of the millenium)

**jasannn** (10): Charli XCX wishes

**kappyko** (10): song to dry hump your bed to

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): queens and i will be campaigning for them in the girl group rate next month

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is paper mario battle music aka a SLAY

**runaway3212** (10): omfg perfection

**seanderlust** (10): this is so cute! the moment when they say mute and the instrumentals do a full stop? talented brilliant etc. the synths are giving Aura by gaga and yes that's a high compliment

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): THE FREAKING KEY CHANGE!!!

**wavingwolves** (10): too experimental intellectual avant garde etc etc

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): I am looking forward to u/kappyko 's english mime fucking anthem

**lady\_sable** (9.5): stan wjsn i am no longer asking üî™

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.3): certified banger

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): definitely love any track that keeps you on your toes sonically, this is also just adorable

**skargardin** (9): bop!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the key change in the last chorus sends me to the astral plane

**vayyiqra** (9): this goes hard

**waluigiest** (9): the groove is so cool

**bbfan132** (8.5): :listening: this is fun

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.2): bop

**Blisterman** (8): Enjoy the rubbery bass and the ADHD way it switches up every 10 seconds.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ‚Ä¶ so a musical.

**daretheghost** (8): Really fun production that sounds different from a lot of other K-pop I‚Äôve heard‚Äìwhich isn‚Äôt a ton, to be fair.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): we must protect cute concepts at all costs

**just\_thonking** (8): this is kinda weird in a good way

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): That little pause just before the chorus gets me everytime. Some pretty odd songwriting/production choices in here, but that only just makes the song better.

**whoisValensi** (8): WJSN... that group I saw the debut of and then they didn't catch my attention too much so they kinda faded into the back of mind but when they come up I go "OH I KNOW THEM." This is nice I suppose. Interesting production in some areas. Maybe I should give WJSN another go‚Ä¶

**TiltControls** (7.8): There's a level of mysteriousness in the production of this song that I really enjoy!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): If this song hadn‚Äôt done that pseudo beat switch in the last third this would be higher but oh well, not a bad K-Pop song at all. Great hook and production overall.

**bo\_g\_o** (7): there's so much good kpop in this rate

**frogaranaman** (7): this didn't tell me the color of the year

**ImADudeDuh** (7): some parts definitely had me tilting my head but overall it was fun

**jman457** (7): that one who raps randomly is throwing me off

**NotWith10000Men** (6.8): i like the vibe of the bridge

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Verses slap but that generic house beat chorus ruins it for me

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): where Save Me, Save You

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): do gg smackdown where they have better songs than this

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Those accidentals are certainly a choice. Still deciding if it's a good or bad one

**pantomime15** (5): Sounds like Rain On Me at a certain portion

**camerinian** (4): sorry but this is all over the place, and not in an interesting way, more a "producers couldn't decide what sample to base the song around but they had a deadline to hit" kind of way

**starla\_** (4): meh

**apatel27** (3): how was this crappy edm beat released in 2020

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is very boppy but something about the production and the vocals pitching at parts I don‚Äôt love. The chorus is great though.

---



#Hyperpopping off
**CarlieScion** (11): this is an energy drink in song form

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**akanewasright** (10): This feels like song that would randomly get in a just dance game and get a bunch of kids hooked on a new style of music

**anothertown** (10): i literally just became obsessed with this song the other day from hearing a two second clip in a tiktok, launch me to the stratosphere bicth!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): this FUCKS

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is soooo good holy shit, @ this submitter u did well

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i cannot believe someone submitted reol she is my absolute favorite jpop act. this song is pop PERFECTION and one of the most criminally overlooked songs of 2020. easily an 11 contender, i barely chose bad girls over this

**ebooks #5454** (10): omg is this citypop

**frogaranaman** (10): I only found this absolute banger originally because I was trying to find the movie soundtrack

**hikkaru** (10): whoever sent this ily omfg the chorus on this is crazy

**jasannn** (10): i need aespa to release music like this

**kappyko** (10): This is the yassification streak of songs

**plastichaxan** (10): i need to save my girl from xenophobia and hyperpopphobia take your 10

**runaway3212** (10): the biggest slay ever

**sage** (10): banger

**seanderlust** (10): oh I LOVE this. the chorus pumps me up. there's so much going on with the instrumentals but it all works so well together

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): time for my vocaloid hyperfixation to come through! the producer for the majority of reol‚Äôs big hits, giga, has also worked extensively in making some of the biggest vocaloid songs in the past decade, and continues to work with the software to this day! even if its not one of his vocaloid songs we‚Äôre rating im glad we get to rate his work in some degree as hes easily one of my favorite producers in the field

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): oh this slaps

**throwaway-7650** (10): reol and Giga-P ended charli XCX and A.G. cook

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Wait, this might be my fav from the whole rate. It's definitely up there.

**welcome2thejam** (10): The chorus drop makes me feel like that Shaq gif where he takes a nibble of a wing and his eyes turn super wide and he goes "ooh"

**whoisValensi** (10): A BANGER?!?!?! AM I LISTENING TO A BANGER?!?!? I THINK I AM!!!!!!

**wavingwolves** (9.9): this is fucking insane

**bo\_g\_o** (9.5): how many raters are going to call this hyperpop

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I am ALL for the vocaloid producers getting the respect they deserve on popheads

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.4): sounds like an above average isekai anime opening, I didn't expect the song to get so electronic at first but it was definitely welcome

**TiltControls** (9.1): a bop!

**bespectacIed** (9): the beat is hot

**CrimsonROSET** (9): without googling, i bet this has some sick choreo

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): okay yeah I can bop to this

**letsallpoo** (9): Not perfect: the awkward handling of the second pre-chorus nearly halts the momentum of a track otherwise determined to set my brain on fire. But I‚Äôve made peace with how easily entertained I am by EDM excess, and the sensory overload here is conducive to a track that captures the excitement of feeling childlike wonder once again so beautifully.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): exactly queen

**skargardin** (9): BOP

**vayyiqra** (9): WaCkY pop in the best sense of the word

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.8): Hell yeah! Bopping!!

**celladonn** (8.5): This goes off a bit

**daretheghost** (8.5): This is WILD.

**lady\_sable** (8.5): oh she goes HARD

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This bangs! Love the production on this one.

**bbfan132** (7.5): this bops

**Stryxen** (7.5): it was terrible for like 30 seconds and then it grew a clit and slayed

**Blisterman** (7): A lot of Japanese pop feels like western trends from 8-10 years earlier injected with sugar. That‚Äôs not entirely a criticism.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Wow that is a lot of sound effects

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): there's a great song here if you can get through the bizarre production choices, the chorus hits so hard just to get hit by a barrage of nonsense!!

**nonchalantthoughts** (6.3): ok

#hyperpop promo has gone too far

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I‚Äôll be honest, I thought this was made in 2014

**MrMoodle** (6): i feel like most of this song is just padding until the chorus which is the actually good part

**SmileAndTears** (6): is this hyper-j-pop üò∂

**starla\_** (5.9): yeah this is alright

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Other than some wonky EDM production, it‚Äôs beginning to be difficult to deny that K-Pop just all sounds like one homogenous hyperactive blob of electropop :/

**NotWith10000Men** (4.2): it sounds about 5 years older than it is

**2dina3dworld** (4): why does she sound so much like Kamei Eri

**jman457** (0): A mess of a song, feels pretty disjointed

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this song is so high energy but Romy‚Äôs voice is not. I‚Äôm sure for some people this works fine but this is kind of jarring for me. I think I would like it more if someone else sang.

---


#Once again i dont know who romy is but i hope they drop the album yall want

**TiltControls** (11): Romy release the solo album I am BEGGING

**1998tweety** (10): oh my lord this sounds amazing, fav discovery of this rate

**2dina3dworld** (10): is this eurodance

**akanewasright** (10): Kinda want this to overperform

**bbfan132** (10): a perfect lgbt anthem

**bespectacIed** (10): euphoric

**frogaranaman** (10): can she do any wrong (musically, Romy's still white so gotta keep an eye out there)

**kappyko** (10): This is the yassification streak of songs

**mudkip1** (10): where tf are you romy it's been 80 years

**RandomHypnotica** (10): once in a lifetime, I'll be nice to the xx

**ReallyCreative** (10): :daisybop:

**skargardin** (10): the audacity of not following up this amazing single with a full project

**throwaway-7650** (10): a mashup of this and dancing elephants would slay tbh

**waluigiest** (10): the yassification of the xx [2]

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): romy appearing twice in this rate is definitely unexpected but absolutely not underserved. a bop

**camerinian** (9.5): why did nobody tell me Romy was finally making sad girl club anthems that her voice is perfect for

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): damn, i wish i was high in a club in amsterdam right now

**Mysario** (9.5): two songs basically by "The xx" in the rate and they both slap, wild how this is technically her first solo track after all this time but it comes out swinging!

**seanderlust** (9.5): what is it about the phrase "once in a lifetime" that causes songs to be immediately amazing? looking at you, romy and talking heads (and lowkey 1D)

**whoisValensi** (9.5): dancingpuggo.gif

**starla\_** (9.3): let's go lesbians

**Awkward\_King** (9): idk how to explain this but the i just KNOW the bass of this song would use a lot of lube

**daretheghost** (9): I didn‚Äôt stop bobbing my head around for the entire length of this.

**ebooks #5454** (9): vibes

**fadedblue09** (9): I do not fully vibe with the production, but there's something transcendental here.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): yeah this one goes off

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Soul Cycle banger

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): This feels focus-grouped to be eaten up by Popheads tbh, basic but incredibly well-crafted and Romy‚Äôs voice elevates anything

**slimboyfriend** (8.9): When I heard Romy from The Xx was coming out with new music this is probably the antithesis of what I thought it would sounds like

**bo\_g\_o** (8.5): hello other member of the xx I like your song

**NotWith10000Men** (8.1): contrary to my usual taste i actually like this

**Blisterman** (8): It's strange how I prefer the members of the XX's solo stuff to anything the XX have done.

**sage** (8): before doing the rate i thought it was mid as hell but this grew on me a lot

**vayyiqra** (8): Basic "synthpop good" take

**jman457** (7.7): a fun time

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.7): not as good as I thought it was on first listen

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Ooh I like this one a lot. The vocals are so good!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I feel like this song should work for me more than it actually does. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs trying to be a really poppy upbeat happy song but then it‚Äôs like, weirdly devoid of energy from the kinda generic instrumental and Romy‚Äôs vocals? I mean it‚Äôs competently made but there‚Äôs just maybe something missing in execution.

#Rate Heros? Or villains, idk at this point
**CrimsonROSET** (7): a bit bland but I like the hook

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): once in a lifetime by the talking heads outsold

**nonchalantthoughts** (6.8): this song is missing something

**Uberpigeon** (6): the other xx outsold

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That voice splicing in the beginning is kinda really annoying

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): it's not bad at all but like...i don't get the hype sob emoji

**runaway3212** (4): I kinda feel the same way about this song as I did about Crazy, it's not that it's a bad song, it's just that I've heard this type of song done a lot better way more than once

#Just Pure vibes

**cherryices** (11): unfortunately as soon as i saw this revealed i knew there would be no other option for my 11!!

**just\_thonking** (11): one of the best songs ever made PERIOD. Whenever it comes on I have to stop whatever I'm doing and just fall...back....in....to....place.......

**1998tweety** (10): im levitating

**2dina3dworld** (10): why hasn‚Äôt this sub ever rated a dreampop album. Get on it, guys!

**bbfan132** (10): could listen to this for much longer

**bespectacIed** (10): female-fronted dream pop rate when? (bh vs alvvays vs jbrekkie vs wolf alice)

**camerinian** (10): mom leave me alone I'm dissociating

**celladonn** (10): My favourite Beach House song (along with Myth)

**frogaranaman** (10): I didn't get Beach House at first but then I became a depressed college student who dabbles in weed and has a radio show and then it finally clicked

**futureisrealized** (10): All elements of the track blend together so well, creating an almost angelic experience.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): how is there a beach house in space? Wheres the beach?

**lady\_sable** (10): this is what a dream sounds like

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): a classic at this point

**ReallyCreative** (10): oh I can cry to this

**runaway3212** (10): now why didn't indieheads send this

**Stryxen** (10): :ascend:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song is so fucking beautiful. out of all the songs in the rate this one grew on me the most

**starla\_** (9.6): classic, beautiful, etc

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): s o n g

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): down bad need pussy

**jman457** (9.5): Is it their best song, no but even mid for Beach House is still amazing

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): the V I B E S are simply I M M A C U L A T E

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.2): at first I thought this reminded me of a game score, but after a couple listens I realized it reminded me of a less frantic version of Komm, s√º√üer Tod. I love this one, the vocals are my least favorite part but they are still good

**anothertown** (9): i wish to gatekeep this album back from indieheads men. thank you!

**ebooks #5454** (9): this is DEFINITELY that song they play at the end of prom and say "ladies and gents, as this iconic night comes to a close, grab that cutie and hold em close" and you wanna be mad because you're surrounded by horny teens slowly spinning in circles but like this song is like just that good?? you can't hate it. you just sit there and kinda cry thinking why is this still going??

**nt96** (9): Ladies and Gentlemen, We are Floating in Space

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): I feel like Beach House consistently make the same song but it‚Äôs a really good song

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): good but Silver Soul or Myth‚Ä¶ now those would have been 11s

**vayyiqra** (9): This is so beautiful, I need to hear this album badly now. I love dream pop.

**TiltControls** (8.8): dreamy

**bulforster** (8.7): As someone with a physics degree, I can say with authority that space is p neat, just like this song

**sage** (8.7): yasss

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): If you know Beach House you kind of already know what this song sounds like. Is that a bad thing? Of fucking course not lol.

**daretheghost** (8.5): Every once in a while I think, ‚ÄúI should get into dream-pop‚Äù and then I never do and then I hear something like this and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt I gotten into dream-pop?‚Äù

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): didnt we rate this already? oh no their songs all just sound the same. luckily they sound all sound like a song that is good

**Blisterman** (8): Pretty. But sounds like every other Beach House song I've heard.

**bo\_g\_o** (8): I am ascending in a sad way

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): i used to be so obsessed with this entire album when tumblrcore was at its peak in 2013-15

**MrMoodle** (8): i like the spacey sounds, got a super mario galaxy vibe

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I'll be honest, if I were to give this song my true, actual rating, I would get screwed to hell and back like you bastards did to me in the TikTok rate when I gave Mystery of Love a 1, so I'll just have to play nice, give this an 8 and be done with it.

**skargardin** (8): I think this might only grow on me with time

**slimboyfriend** (8): They love their arepggiators and so do I!

**whoisValensi** (8): I know a lotta indie kids, and I know a lotta indie kids that love this song but I have one important statement on this song. THIS DOESN'T FEEL LIKE SPACE TO ME. Idk if I can nail down a song that sounds like "space" to me (probably smth off MGMT's S/T album tbh) but I know this doesn't feel like space to me. It's nice but not space.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I loooove the space production on this one. And that guitar hits!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): [ ]

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.1): I'm Beach House indifferent verging on anti, but I admit this very nice. The vocals don't stir much in me, but the instrumentation is a total 10

**nonchalantthoughts** (7.1): sounds like Tame Impala

**CrimsonROSET** (7): vibes

**DaHumanTorch** (7): this was cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): it‚Äôs alright but not enough to base my personality around

#Anti inidekids

**CarlieScion** (6.5): sorry to do longsongphobia but . But my brain is what it is

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): the inferior beach

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It‚Äôs cute but kinda just fades into the background

**welcome2thejam** (6): Beach House continues their reign at number one in the "hey this sounds pretty pleasant aaand I'm asleep" category

**fadedblue09** (5): meandering

**steelstepladder** (5): I know I should love beach house as a strong indie gal but their songs always just slide off my brain

**NotWith10000Men** (4.3): i love the beginning few seconds that are just instrumental but then the vocals came in and i was like, oh right it's one of those bands

**kappyko** (4): MID!!!!!!!!

**seanderlust** (8.5): shoutout to this movie for making a song that just drags a movie character for three minutes - WITH ZERO MENTION OF CHRISTMAS, JUST THREE MINUTES OF INSULTS - a christmas classic.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): wow im so glad that this is the only animated version of the grinch that exists and that no company ever tried to recreate this story!

**skargardin** (9): classic

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): it has my heart idk

**welcome2thejam** (8): Vince Guaraldi Trio don't miss

**fadedblue09** (7.3): Wait TV Specials are allowed? Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too robbed smh

**Blisterman** (7): Not as entertaining as I remember. But it manages to capture a wonderful tone.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): peanuts robbed in the indieheads christmas rate

**jman457** (7): Dont remember too much about it tbh

**anothertown** (6.5): it's fine idk.. The music is the best part

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): in my freshmen year of college i had a theology teacher who was a full on peanuts stan and one day she showed us a video that was her showing off a room in her house that was filled wall to wall with thousands of dollars worth of peanuts merchandise. ive hated the peanuts ever since i finished her class.

**frogaranaman** (10): literally so fucking true, Christmas isn't Christmas without Miss Piggy beating the shit out of Kermit

**ignitethephoenix** (10): massive bop that deserves to smash! This was also the first Tinashe song I ever heard and really enjoyed.

**Roxieloxie** (8): i like the bleeps 

---


#One day Tinashe will be a rate winner, but not today

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): i HOPE this doesn't get robbed but either way i'm here to support her. i guess you could say............................... i'm in her................................................................................................ company

**1998tweety** (10): one of her best songs ever, whew the sex she OOZED

**akanewasright** (10): The music video is a 12, the song is a 10

**anothertown** (10): bleep bloop queen!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): classic

**buddhacharm** (10): stream 333! someone has to

**cremeebrulee** (10): sure the MV is stellar, but i just really love this song on its own too. it has the perfect amount of attitude that tinashe just nails. it really pains me not to 11 this but i will when we rate nightride eventually i promise

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this would be my 11 if it wasn't my own submission (i don't want to be a #narcissist). this is literally one of the best songs ever made and the FUCKING MUSIC VIDEO?????? the choreography and all in one take it's easily one of my favorite music videos ever. the final part with the lights flickering into the splits....i die everytime. i could write an entire reddit post hitting the character limit on this song but i'll spare everyone but i hope this masterpiece does well

**kappyko** (10): This is the clit of the rate.

**plastichaxan** (10): she really has always been ahead of the game im sorry i doubted the statement

**sage** (10): üíãüíÖ

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this is hyperpop.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Do I need to say any more? If you have ears you know this is a ten.

**vayyiqra** (10): Giving this a 10 because I love trap beats and bleepbloop synths. Also shoutout to how Twitter suggested I follow Tinashe this morning and it was a post by Quenched so also by proxy, shoutout to Quenched for being one of the best Popheads with the best taste

**whoisValensi** (10): Oh hey look it's my favorite Tinashe song. This takes me back to the plug.dj days.

**nootnoot781** (9.5): wait‚Ä¶ this is different to what i remember, i thought it went like ‚Äúcan we keep each other company‚Äù what the fuck is that song then? E: genius lyrics says it‚Äôs a justin bieber song oops

**NotWith10000Men** (9.2): i like the little repetitive boop boop boops in the background

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): I want to like this track more, but the creepy kinda bloopy piano line in the background is almost distracting, but the ending makes up for it it's the hottest part

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): companyiscoming.mp4

**Blisterman** (9): The sparse trap beat with it's crunchy trunk rattling bass gives heft to the frank and assertive lyrics. Very sexy.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): open quotation marks, company, close quotation marks

**daretheghost** (9): I played the hell out of this song when it came out and I guess it says something that I‚Äôm still not tired of it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Love the instrumentals, her ear for them is so good.

**lady\_sable** (9): that bassline scratches my brain

**ebooks #5454** (8.9): what a phenomenal dancer, def the same energy as the modern dance group at my uni

**TiltControls** (8.6): Tinashe has this level of effortlessness to her that makes all of her songs seem like it's so easy yet so masterful and this is no exception

**bbfan132** (8.5): this production is a+++++

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I feel like every time I rate a Tinashe song, my comment is always something like "This is a bop and a half why is this song not more popular??" :(

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): the video is a 10 though

**musical\_pyn** (8): plus one for the ending

**Mysario** (8): the

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Very surprised that this wasn't produced by Dylan Brady, I can definitely hear a ton of Gecs/hyperpop influence in those blown-out 808s. Even the power of Tinashe can make a basic mid beat sound like a proper banger.

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): was a seven until that slowed+reverb beat switch

**throwaway-7650** (8): oh right the MV is just a serve... let me bump this a bit

**welcome2thejam** (8): Probably deserves a 10 for that splits she did in the music video, Jesus

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.8): not me thinking this was an Ariana song at first üíÄ I don't like the outro at all, brings the song down from around what i would consider to be a 8.5ish

**wavingwolves** (7.8): what kind of company? waystar royco?

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): nashe im a virgin this feels like bullying at this point

**starla\_** (7.5): I like this song but I forget it exists sometimes

**frogaranaman** (7): music for NASDAQ

**mudkip1** (7): it's no undo (back to my heart)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the gamer in me appreciates the chip tune parts of this song

#Poggerphobia

**jman457** (6.6): Kind of basic on all fronts, nothing stands out

**camerinian** (6.5): Jesus I really want to like Tinashe but everything I've heard from her shows that she needs better production to perform over cos her potential is just not being tapped

**rslashpoopheads** (6): ok.

**runaway3212** (6): sorry tinashe I love you but this song is not it

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i‚Äôm sorry but her delivery on the chorus is just so annoying to me

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Whose idea was it to put those chiptunes in here? Cause it was a bad idea

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): girl you‚Äôre not gonna get any company if you‚Äôre releasing music that sounds like this lol

**\_\_Avaritia** (1): Jesus Christ, 2 minutes into the song the fucking synths beeping away have grated away my nerves to nothing and I just want the SUFFERING TO END holy fuck, the 1 point is for the somewhat okay vocal performance that is completely ruined by the incessantly annoying instrumental.

#Future spotify monthly listeners 

**apatel27** (11): üî•

**MrMoodle** (11): how the fuck does this only have like 30k spotify streams, am i missing something??? this is unbelievably good, so happy i did this rate for this discovery alone

**Awkward\_King** (10): this kinda one of the best songs ive ever heard ive no clue who sent thtis but like king

**camerinian** (10): thank you for giving me the reason I needed to take this album off the ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll listen to it eventually‚Äù list because holy shit

**CrimsonROSET** (10): albums i would not be mad at rating for 200 roxie

**daretheghost** (10): This absolutely fucks.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): My former co-hostie has great taste (sometimes ;D )

**ImADudeDuh** (10): feels like they just found some people jammin and then started freestyling over it, but in the best possible way

**ReallyCreative** (10): a really great surprise omg small artist stans unite!!

**sage** (10): not anticipating this flopping even though its easily one of the best songs here

**seanderlust** (10): I really regret not getting to this 2021 release yet. maybe I will have to rectify that soon

**starla\_** (10): YES this album is so moving

**throwaway-7650** (10): BOP !!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Third favorite song of 2021! I remember my jaw dropping so often during my first listen. Gorgeous instrumentation, killer grooves, and great flows. The start of the third verse with just the drums and the horns and starting on "Phantoms on phantoms on phantoms on phantoms" is one of my favorite song moments of the year

**Mysario** (9.8): goes on a little too long but otherwise one of the best songs in the rate and deserves everything

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): I kinda love this

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): oh wow this is excellent, i'm definitely going to check out this album after this

**jman457** (9.4): this slaps actually

**wavingwolves** (9.1): truly amazing

**bbfan132** (9): never heard of this artist but i liked this quite a bit!!! the outro was great

**frogaranaman** (9): this is going to get robbed

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Criticizing holier-than-thou Christianity? Yes bestie spill

**nonchalantthoughts** (8.9): like the beat

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): all the artists involved with this track have names that sound like characters in a western film

**runaway3212** (8.7): The outro of this

**TiltControls** (8.7): I love the flow on this!

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Kind of hard to fault this song other than it dragging a little, smooth as hell and the rapping is super cool, love the trumpets on this one too.

**bo\_g\_o** (8.5): still have absolutely no clue why YouTube said this video was blocked in my country when other American popheads could see it

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I'm a sucker for horns and contemplations about religion

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): but what a banger

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Oh ok. I totally get the hype now. This is soooo good!

**ebooks #5454** (8.3): 'love you daughter sorry son' what my dad says to me and my siblings

**futureisrealized** (8.3): Great rapping throughout.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.2): my problem with rap is I miss a big part of the song by not caring about the lyrics so I usually come to not care about most of it, but this song has a lot going on outside the vocals and has a jazzy vibe that resonates with me a lot. It's most noticeable on the outro but even during the verses the little bits of piano we get elevates the song so much

**kappyko** (8): This is really good

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): i should finally listen to this album huh

**musical\_pyn** (8): I feel like I need to listen to this about 10 more times to truly appreciate it

**SmileAndTears** (8): I really need to listen to this album don't I?

**lady\_sable** (7.5): loving the energy here!

#More tomatoes

**Blisterman** (7): Mixing genres doesn‚Äôt automatically make your music interesting. It‚Äôs not bad, but it never really comes together for me.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Yeah... It's pretty dope. A pretty interesting combination of heavy bars, pretty dope jazz pianos and sick drums. The mix is a bit too compressed and the bass guitar could do with a bit of scooping in the mids to make way for the vocals but yeah, again, this is pretty dope.

**vayyiqra** (7): This is way better if you listen to the instrumental and hear the jazz influences like the electric piano

**2dina3dworld** (6): what the drums do

**NotWith10000Men** (6): the trumpets are nice

**whoisValensi** (5.5): Hmmmm I wanna give this a good score but man this is not hitting for me. I mean I guess it's good but like, it's not for me.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.9): the production is interesting and this song truly lives up to the name, but this is not my cup of tea. I just can‚Äôt get behind the contrast of the production and melody aka the hyperballad of it all.  And I‚Äôve never been a fan of Bjork‚Äôs voice either so I have to pass on this song as a whole, as cool as the instrumental is

**Roxieloxie** (2): I'll be honest, I just dont think bjork's voice is for me. Its a little *too* bannis and avocados for me. Because the words of it alot but god I just cant behind her voice

---

#People who are once again gonna hate us

**musical\_pyn** (11): ‚Ä¶I should get into bjork shouldn't I

**nootnoot781** (11): there is so many great songs in this rate and i could‚Äôve spent hours picking which one i would‚Äôve gave it to but nooooo someone had to submit in hyperballad üòêlike i could‚Äôve supported my desi sister M.I.A, some men from the 80s that my dad probably listens to, LOUD FUCKING PLACES, or some virgin from the 1800s but noooooo üôÑüôÑüôÑ i just have to give it some weirdo from iceland singing about dropping off a cliff because this song reminds me to keep going or whateverüòíüòíüòí

**nt96** (11): Kate Bush ran up that hill and Bjork fell off of it just so FKA twigs could be home with you. Art Pop queens stick together üíÖ

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): Easily one of my favourite Bjork songs ever. Haven't been able to get the chorus outta my damn head.

**SmileAndTears** (11): ajay voice okay??? make a song hoe! MAKE A SONG!!!

**waluigiest** (11): I could write essays about how much I love this song. Instead I‚Äôll just note that this song about imagining your own gruesome death to feel more secure in love topped the Billboard Dance Club charts in 1996.

**akanewasright** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, cliff dropping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it with some cutlery, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, die to it

**anothertown** (10): "i go through all this before you wake up" - me at 430am the day my wife and i left for her birthday vacation and i overflowed the toilet and had to clean the entire bathroom

**apatel27** (10): Classic

**bbfan132** (10): yes.

**Blisterman** (10): Love this song. One of Bjork's best.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): okay but does bjork throw car batteries into the ocean

**buddhacharm** (10): well cum 2 bang cock!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): bjork's cutlery:

**daretheghost** (10): Perfect in every way.

**fadedblue09** (10): One of the best buildups in pop music

**ImADudeDuh** (10): she put her whole bjussy into this

**jman457** (10): its not my fav Bjork song, im just worried she is gonna bjomb again

**kappyko** (10): Me talking about how I prefer to take showers in the morning than at night

**lady\_sable** (10): its fucking bjork babey!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of her best songs actually...

**oliviagodrigo** (10): ooh.. she put her whole bj√ºssy in this song

**plastichaxan** (10): the female urge to walk towards the edge of the top of the mountain you live on and throw little things off like car parts, bottles and cuttlery or whatever you find laying around

**RandomHypnotica** (10): If I didn't literally have my favourite song of all time in this rate, this would be the easy 11, it's simply incredible, magical, beautiful, and words don't do it justice. It's moving and profound and delicate and loud and passionate and so much more.

**ReallyCreative** (10): the moment the percussion comes in invented crying at the club

**sage** (10): the tea üíãüë†

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Every detail of this song builds and tells a story, from the skittering beat that sounds like objects literally falling to the exquisite strings. And most importantly, Bj√∂rk is a expert at expressing emotion. I like to think of the ritual in the lyrics as Bj√∂rk purging dark thoughts that no longer bring her joy from the clutter of her mind. Invented Marie Kondo tbh!

**seanderlust** (10): bjork expressing the comfortable love that comes after three or so years of marriage: soemtimes...I think of h√´rling myself ≈ìuf aiiee cliff

**skargardin** (10): it's the classic!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): the storytelling, the strings at the end... I'm ascending

**Uberpigeon** (10): i hope raters' hyperpopphobia and balladphobia are not going to join forces and rob this song

**vayyiqra** (10): Feeling a little bad for not giving this my 11, as a longtime Bj√§rb of many years, but I can't do it in good conscience. As great a song as this is, my (unpopular) belief is that it's a little overrated. I can't even quite explain why, I just don't get why it's hyped up so much like it's her greatest song ever, instead of just one of many good songs she has. It's still objectively great though so I have to 10 it. (Also her greatest song is All Is Full of Love, you can't change my mind.)

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hell yeah Bjork fuck me up with your lush, textured soundscapes and dark pulsating synths

**bulforster** (9.6): Fun fact: due to the laws of physics all the things bj√∂rk is throwing off her cliff take the same amount of time to hit the rocks (if you ignore air resistance)

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): I feel like if I chanced upon this song a year ago I‚Äôd probably give this a 3.5 or something, but now that I‚Äôm at least accustomed to Bjork‚Äôs singing style I can finally appreciate the beauty of this song lol. Wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to this song winning the rate.

**camerinian** (9.5): here I am yet again, stupid little baby Bjork fan, not knowing she had a full on beautiful acid house anthem in her catalogue, feeling dumb as hell for not doing the deep dive yet. Anyways vote for the Y2K Raver Anthems Rate next cycle if you liked this cos

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.1): a bit of a long comment but I'm recently trying to get into Bj√∂rk's music (I listened to Debut and Post so far) and the more I listen, the worse it gets. I can appreciate the artistry in the songs but most of them aren't really pleasing to listen to imo. But Hyper-ballad isn't one of them, I love this one so much.

**1998tweety** (9): this is MORBID

**celladonn** (9): I'm not the biggest bjarb but this is pretty great, musically and lyrically

**futureisrealized** (9): Vocals are quite distinctive

**just\_thonking** (9): Bjork are you okay be honest

**MrMoodle** (9): the way the bass growls at the start tingles my ears

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): one of those songs that only gets better the further in the song you get

**starla\_** (8.5): the climax of this song is amazing

**CrimsonROSET** (8): a hyperpop ballad? she is not shooting for the popheads demographic I‚Äôll tell you that much

**Mysario** (8): Bjork is one of the most impressive artists out there, with an insanely diverse catalog that ranges from the sound of dumpster trucks crushing trash to this, which is considered one of her best songs

**nonchalantthoughts** (7.7): i really want to like this bc its Bjork but I had a hard time in the beginning

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I‚Äôm sure LOONA would have outsold if Jaden Jeong hadn‚Äôt fumbled the ball so hard

Roxieloxie: **frogaranaman** (7): one time I was talking to an art friend about Bj√∂rk and they were talking about how 'Bj√∂rk invented the art of buildups in pop music' and referenced this song as an example like.. sis she's literally just making house music lmfao

**rslashpoopheads** (7): well

**runaway3212** (7): Sorry I love bjork but I really prefer army of me

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Her voice kinda sounds like a mixture of Lorde and Aurora. Is that just me? Yeah? Ok. Oh and also the song is ok.

**jasannn** (6.5): I wish it was more a little more ‚Äúcrying on the dancefloor‚Äù if that makes sense

**TiltControls** (6.5): I think I'm just neutral on Bjork. That said this is pretty good, but the competition is fierce

**whoisValensi** (6.5): Many times I feel like I fail to understand Bj√∂rk, but I respect her, ya feel. Like I'm not very big on her music but I just respect the fact she constantly pushes boundaries by just doing whatever the fuck she wants. Maybe one day Bj√∂rk will fully click for me, but until then, idk lol.

**Awkward\_King** (6): she so wild we cant take her anywhere

**bespectacIed** (6): loonamaison outsold

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Okay so today I learned Bjork isn‚Äôt for me

**wavingwolves** (6): will balladphobia take a hit on this... let's wait to find out‚Ä¶

#Hyperballadphobia

**cremeebrulee** (5): sometimes i don't understand what people hear in bjork because this doesn't really do anything for me üßçüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**ebooks #5454** (4.5): it might have been better if i didn't watch the m/v...

**joeeswift** (3): I really do not enjoy any Bjork song I listen to and I feel like she‚Äôs the final boss you have to defeat in order to gain a musical superiority complex

**NotWith10000Men** (3): i'm reminded why i've never gotten into bjork

**SinfulAnarchy** (3): bjork‚Äôs voice sounds really strained and the lyrical metaphor is heavy-handed and vague to me

vayyiqra: >nootnoot781

>(11): there is so many great songs in this rate and i could‚Äôve spent hours picking which one i would‚Äôve gave it to but nooooo someone had to submit in hyperballad üòêlike i could‚Äôve supported my desi sister M.I.A, some men from the 80s that my dad probably listens to, LOUD FUCKING PLACES, **or some virgin from the 1800s** but noooooo üôÑüôÑüôÑ

nobody is going to read this but this reminded me that today i read up on debussy and learned more about his personal life than i needed to know, such as that he had an open marriage, and was linked to quite a few women, some of whom were also married. i'm not sure what to do with this information

in hindsight perhaps this shouldn't be surprising but it's still a weird thought! going to stop here sorry if this comment is cursed but it is truthful. ~~new rate discourse: was debussy a fuckboy~~  don't answer that

vayyiqra: also not at all sure why i felt the need to share this information in the rate reveal thread; idk i'm sleep-deprived and got my booster shot today so i'm feeling loopy. and again i didn't know what to do with this newfound debussy knowledge

**ignitethephoenix** (11): this is such a bop and gets me very hype when I hear it (a great workout song!) Disclosure does not miss. I‚Äôll never get sick of this. I was going to give my song my 11 but this song is good enough so also deserve it without blatantly just saying my song is my favorite.

**Roxieloxie** (10): God this song is so good

---

#Never coming down

**Awkward\_King** (11): this is the best song ever made.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): I have always said ‚Äòput this in the charity rate, I‚Äôll 11 it‚Äô and I HAVE DELIVERED! THIS IS THE SMASHA!

**ImADudeDuh** (11): honestly? This is the best Disclosure song. Fuck latch.

**2dina3dworld** (10): god I wish Disclosure was popular again, they made bops

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): If every track from ENERGY sounded like this (spoiler, it doesn‚Äôt) we‚Äôd have another Settle and that‚Äôs on GOD.

**akanewasright** (10): This should be an obvious winner/win contender‚Ä¶ I wonder what could possibly impede that

**apatel27** (10): Go off slowthai

**bbfan132** (10): if this isn‚Äôt in the top 10‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

**camerinian** (10): Hip house is so my jam already, so Disclosure jumping on the sound with maybe their most chaotic beat and Amine and Slowthai nailing the hyped up groove is basically just a direct bypass over all critical faculties. This slaps so unbearably hard

**cremeebrulee** (10): when are we launching an investigation as to why amine is credited on the single but not the album version . (real talk, i love this song, it‚Äôs my go-to when i‚Äôm the aux and i need to ~impress people~ and it has not failed me yet)

**DefaultPophead** (10): How come amine isn't credited on the song elsewhere?

**frogaranaman** (10): Amin√© choosing to not have himself credited on this song is such a whack call

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): wait when did I enter the club???

**hikkaru** (10): the superior hip house song in this rate

**joeeswift** (10): this is so chaotic I love it

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): disclosure legends i'm surprised they're not talked about more on ph actually

**mudkip1** (10): i love disclosure so much

**musical\_pyn** (10): one of my favorite discoveries of this rate, it's just such a hype track

**pantomime15** (10): Banger. MY WHAT?

**plastichaxan** (10): this song just gets better and better

**RandomHypnotica** (10): massive fuck energy

**sage** (10): smash

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the energy this has is unmatched, I didn‚Äôt understand why people were so obsessed but now I get it

**skargardin** (10): Slowthai decided to serve for once and then some

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): https://c.tenor.com/qFiVMJ7kDGwAAAAi/catjam.gif

**throwaway-7650** (10): slowthai ate (for once)

**TiltControls** (10): I'm loving this! My favourite new discovery so thank you submitter!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Ooh that beat is NASTY! Easy 10 for sure!

**wavingwolves** (10): i had a dream this won this rate so if it wins i guess it makes me the modern oracle

**whoisValensi** (10): First off, Disclosure is a slay no matter what. Second off, whoever had the literal GENIUS idea of putting Slowthai and Amine on a track... Can I please suck your dick because you're fucking BRILLIANT. Like holy shit their ENERGY!!!! They play off each other so well which adds some fucking insane energy to this track. Super easy 10.

**just\_thonking** (9.5): this gets my ass shaking uncontrollably like nothing else

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): This is such a fun banger and you can tell Guy & Howard put their whole Disclussies into this beat.

**bespectacIed** (9): so good

**celladonn** (9): Quite a banger

**daretheghost** (9): This is a banger.

**seanderlust** (9): this song makes me feel how vodka redbulls made me feel when I was 20

**starla\_** (8.9): I thought this album was pretty underrated when it came out tbh

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is todrick hall but good

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): this sounds like a male mashup of 212 and Boss Bitch. It‚Äôs nice but a little repetitive

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): You want to rate another electronic rap track like this? Preferably also with slowthai? Well look no further than the UK Rap Rate featuring the absolute banger that is Doorman!

**CarlieScion** (8): fuck u leixander

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Did this trio just make a song that's good to vogue to

**ebooks #5454** (8): WHY WAS THIS M/V SO VIOLENT OMG LET HIM LIVEEEE

**vayyiqra** (8): After hating this the first time I heard it (I tend to hate songs about drug use and also this seemed like a "bro" kind of song) now I have more respect for it. It is a "bop"!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Won me over in the end by absolutely killing on a nighttime drive

**jasannn** (7.8): I‚Äôm a bitch. I‚Äôm a boss. I‚Äôm a bitch and a boss and I shine like gloss.

**nonchalantthoughts** (7.6): could be better

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Disclosure needs to make more un-chill bops because this is pretty good

**SmileAndTears** (7): would go off in a club methinks (not that I've ever been to one). Too bad we can't fuckiNG GO TO CLUBS, HUH MISS RONA?!!??!

**ReallyCreative** (6): I was excited to listen to this because of how hyped up y'all were and then got blasted with a super generic club banger that flirts with being outright obnoxious... it goes hard but doesn't hold a candle to most of the rest of the rate.

# Fucked up my high

**runaway3212** (6): im so unimpressed by this

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I prefer my dance music to be a bit more‚Ä¶ fruitier

**jman457** (5.2): Bops a bit, but really sounds like Gentrified zebra Katz

**Blisterman** (5): I love the melodies and tight construction of Disclosure's early stuff. But, like a lot of their recent stuff, this sound like they knocked together a 90s sounding loop and put it on repeat.

**futureisrealized** (3): Some of the most boring lyrics i've ever listened to, production is also very basic.

**thisusernameisntlong** (2.5): longest 294 seconds of my life, sounds like a song that you could dance to at a club after A LOT of drinking, but that's so many steps to get there. The distorted vocals are irritating, the beat is irritating, the chorus is torture to my ears, my ears, my what? my ears.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): sounds like Rich Brian (derogatory)

**NotWith10000Men** (0): i barely made it through the first thirty seconds. absolutely not

**RoyalBloodFool** (0): I think I do not like the totality of the song. It might not just be my taste. I also feel weird with the lyrics although it is loved by many.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my submission! I heard this song ages ago but then recently rediscovered it in the past year and got re-obsessed. It makes me feel like a bad bitch who can do anything I needed that energy in the last year. Also Danja killed this production honestly some of the best production I‚Äôve heard.

**Roxieloxie** (10):  its iconic what can i say

---

#Baddies

**Blisterman** (11): Love this song. M.I.A.'s swagger. That beat. So good. And the video‚Äôs great too.

**buddhacharm** (11): giving this an 11 was part of the reason why I did this rate because if I've been able to muster up like four shitty academic papers on M.I.A., her discography and her life I can muster up the motivation to do this rate (anyways this deserves a 12 but I'll subtract one point for her antivax activism üíÄ we move!)

**bulforster** (11): Ironically, due to time dilation, living at a high velocity would cause you to outlive your peers in the rest frame as you would experience time more slowly than them.

**cremeebrulee** (11): mia ü§ù my mom: 46 year old desi women who tell i‚Äôm a bad girl

**DaHumanTorch** (11): i didn't want to 11 my own submission so this masterpiece of a song is getting it! this blowing up on tik tok and getting a little viral moment was the peak of 2021 i fear

**NotWith10000Men** (11): iconique

**plastichaxan** (11): a bot made this choice for me and i have to admit it feels correct

**static\_int\_husp** (11): God this songs such a banger and I had it on repeat already this month before the rate began so yeah easy 11.

**akanewasright** (10): This should be an obvious winner contender‚Ä¶ but popheads is racist ~~and yeah ig she‚Äôs her own brand of weird

**bbfan132** (10): how has this not been rated yet???

**bespectacIed** (10): she put her entire antivax pussy into this oh wow. one of the best pop songs of the 2010s, iconic every lyric

**camerinian** (10): an eternal banger. Imagine just writing three of the best rap hooks of the 2010s and jamming all of them into one song back to back. Legend shit

**daretheghost** (10): Again, perfect in every way.

**jman457** (10): certified classic for the antivaxx movement

**kappyko** (10): honestly if i was being completely honest this is my 11 but i also like the idea of giving rochelle jordan my 11 too and if bad girls wins rating matangi becomes less feasible naurrrr

**lady\_sable** (10): the GRIP this had on me in high school...

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): LIVE FAST DIE YOUNG BAD GIRLS DO IT WELL

**nootnoot781** (10): ‚Äúlive fast die young‚Äù insert M.I.A anti-vaxxer joke here

**nt96** (10): The biggest bad bitch energy you're ever gonna get. Your fave can't compare

**RandomHypnotica** (10): LIVE FAST DIE YOUNG BAD GIRLS DO IT WELL

**ReallyCreative** (10): I don't want this to win because M.I.A. is my easiest way to get Santigold rated and she'll win that rate too, come through 5G queen

**rslashpoopheads** (10): my go to song when I'm committing tax fraud

**sage** (10): classic

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): THE SMASHA of M.I.A.‚Äôs career, I might get tired of Paper Planes but never this swagger-filled defiance anthem

**seanderlust** (10): the absolute stranglehold Matangi had on my streaming activity in 2013

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): GTA bop

**skargardin** (10): CLASSIC!!

**vayyiqra** (10): Pretty much the definition of "banger".

**waluigiest** (10): live slow die slow slow girls do it slow

**wavingwolves** (10): thee slay if i'm honest

**whoisValensi** (10): Imagine my shock one day when I woke up and found out that this was about sex. I figured she was just talking about speeding or getting too lit to the radio while in the car. Oh well. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**celladonn** (9.5): Now when are we going to rate one of her albums

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): this > paper planes (which I don't dislike anymore but)

**starla\_** (9.1): get BACK, get DOWN

**1998tweety** (9): iconic

**2dina3dworld** (9): my family used to make fun of me for liking this song

**anothertown** (9): weddings funerals

**Awkward\_King** (9): matangi rate when u/buddhacharm [+2]

**frogaranaman** (9): is M.I.A. still a bad girl even tho she didn't die young? I'm sure she lived fast

**MrMoodle** (9): the ultimate girlboss anthem tbh

**nonchalantthoughts** (9): this is a M.I.A. stan account

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.8): The instrumental to this is absolutely epic, kinda sounds like something K/DA would probably use (I was gonna say "has anybody mashed this up with More yet" and as it turns out there's already a few mashups out there lol). It's kinda a shame that like Azealia, M.I.A's become a little bit of a twit on social media thanks to her incredibly dumb anti-vax statements, which kinda puts a bit of a damper on the enjoyment of this song. Oh well.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.8): anti-vaxx queen serving, truly a bad girl üòç fr though I'm not the biggest hiphop fan but I like Paper Planes a lot already and after this I might listen to more of her stuff

**TiltControls** (8.7): great song! but still waiting for us to rate paper planes :waiting2:

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): When M.I.A. puts her mind to actually make a full-on banger, she actually does a really awesome job at it. A little repetitive but the charisma is there, the production is pretty good, not much else to fault.

**ebooks #5454** (8.5): auntie please learn how to dance our bollywood culture did not prep us for you to show these sad moves

**apatel27** (8): weird that this is used for thirst traps but it's a banger

**slimboyfriend** (8): I'd give this an even higher score if I didn't overplay it in high school

**Uberpigeon** (8): i love the bad girls cause theyre all i know

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oh shit, didn't know this was where "live fast die young bad girls do it well" comes from

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): ‚Äúdie young‚Äù it‚Äôs the 5G

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This sounds like if Rita Ora got girlbossed...

**ImADudeDuh** (7): don‚Äôt vaxx, die young, bad moms do it well

**Mysario** (7): you can tell MIA isn't a bad girl cause she didn't do this well

**runaway3212** (7): this is super overrated imo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the anti-vaxxer made some points perhaps!

# Not baddies

**CarlieScion** (6): this is just too middle school vibes for me now

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I‚Äôm sorry, this is not for me. It‚Äôs so repetitive, and the droning beat sounds almost claustrophobic. It should be more.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I wish this was more exciting

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this production is so lush I love it. And Mariya sings wonderfully as well.

**Roxieloxie** (9): Citypop finally won!

---

**1998tweety** (11): beautiful song

**bookthieving** (11): it's simply a masterpiece!

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): It would be a cliche for this to win but also it would be correct‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just make 2021 the year of Japanese rate winners

**seanderlust** (11): (video footage of me googling this artist to ensure that yes, this actually is city pop before writing "it's city pop" into the comment section of my ballot)

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): i hope this wins

**skargardin** (11): This is an open letter to the Yukika stans pleading them to stream Expressions

**vayyiqra** (11): Yeah I know this term is way overused but I really feel this song is "pop perfection". It sparked a whole new wave of interest in city pop, an obscure kind of music that was exclusively from Japan decades ago, because it was just that good. It is special. There are a lot of great songs in this rate that also deserve an 11 but this is the only time I figure I'll be able to 11 this, so I'm going for it.

**welcome2thejam** (11): The first time I heard this song, I immediately had to play it again. And again. And again and again, and two hours later I was convinced I was listening to the greatest song of all time. Well, maybe it doesn't exactly reach those heights, but it does reach eighth on my all-time favorites list, so that's something! Anyway, I don't think a song that I'll never get sick of exists, but boy does this come close. Every time I hear it, there's another element - the background guitar licks, the first horns' appearance, that slight pause before the climax - that wows me all over again. Sucks to be that guy who submits something to a rate just so I can give it an 11, but Plastic Love deserves it.

**2dina3dworld** (10): stream the (Juice=Juice version)[https://youtu.be/f6Nuvg3RuEw]

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Major Songs in the Key of Life vibes here, this song better win the rate even if it didn‚Äôt get my 11, just utterly joyful to listen to and the production and performance and songwriting are just immaculate.

**akanewasright** (10): if this doesn‚Äôt hit the top 5‚Ä¶

**bbfan132** (10): if this wins, it will be lovely

**bespectacIed** (10): My prediction for rate winner. This song will somehow survive the heat death of the universe

**bo\_g\_o** (10): CITY POP QUEEN!

**camerinian** (10): literally the YouTube algorithm's only positive contribution to the world

**celladonn** (10): If my girlfriend did this rate this would be her 11

**CrimsonROSET** (10): rip future citypop rate

**daretheghost** (10): It‚Äôs so interesting to me how the internet can take a 30-year-old song that did alright and turn it into something huge. But it fits for a song this great.

**frogaranaman** (10): if you were aware of this song before this rate, I need to check your screen time report

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is a dark horse to win i think

**kappyko** (10): guys i found this song off youtube you guys HAVE to hear it

**lady\_sable** (10): Mariya Takeuchi is the voice of god

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of the best songs ever i fear

**Mysario** (10): ain't nothing plastic about this bop!

**nootnoot781** (10): any score lower is objectively wrong lol

**nt96** (10): Redemption for Miki losing the tiktok rate

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): If the YouTube algorithm never existed, we wouldn't've had a city-pop resurgence. This is an absolute smash and I would've totally given it my 11 if Hyperballad wasn't on the list.

**ReallyCreative** (10): so tempted to forsake my own song to give this legendary bop the 11 it deserves, but I'm hopeful justice will be done!

**sage** (10): city pop rate when aÃ∂cÃ∂tÃ∂uÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂lÃ∂yÃ∂ Ã∂iÃ∂ Ã∂dÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂wÃ∂aÃ∂nÃ∂nÃ∂aÃ∂ Ã∂sÃ∂eÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂pÃ∂oÃ∂pÃ∂hÃ∂eÃ∂aÃ∂dÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂hÃ∂oÃ∂rÃ∂rÃ∂iÃ∂bÃ∂lÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂tÃ∂aÃ∂kÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂nÃ∂ Ã∂iÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂nÃ∂vÃ∂mÃ∂

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): sounds still fresh and ahead of its time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song is so overrated among city pop enjoyers and theres so many better songs in the genre and i kinda dislike how this song became the face of the entire genre and japanese music in general to a lesser extent‚Ä¶.but goddamn if it isnt a great song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): she did what she had to do

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): god bless YouTube recommendations for introducing me to this gem and citypop in general, not sure if this is my favorite citypop song but it's still a 10. So groovy

**throwaway-7650** (10): rate winner. or else ratemas is cancelled

**Uberpigeon** (10): so THIS is hyperpop?

**wavingwolves** (10): mariya takeuchi the ultimate viral queen

**whoisValensi** (10): I think it would be an honor to lose to 'Plastic Love'. Why? Because it's fucking 'Plastic Love', enough said.

**ebooks #5454** (9.9): whoever sent this needs to get their ass ate (clarification: not by me, but like someone)

**bulforster** (9.8): The physical definition of plastic is 'changes shape permanently under deformation' so rather than indicating the love as superficial, Mariya's use of the word is in fact illustrating the significant impact this interaction has had on her.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): A really lush arrangement. Feels like it's overstaying its welcome, but I assume it's just language barrier issues.

**runaway3212** (9.5): almost perfect

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): the dark souls of city pop

**starla\_** (9.3): why is this song so good, I literally never tire of it

**Blisterman** (9): I only know this from a sped up remix, so listening to this now it feels like a chopped and screwed version.

**CarlieScion** (9): oh WOW

**nonchalantthoughts** (9): i love city pop

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): It‚Äôs absolutely a bop but I still cannot fathom why people wanted to listen to an 8 minute version of this. The intro in that version was waaaay too long for me!

**waluigiest** (9): city gorl!!

**TiltControls** (8.9): Makes me want to drive down a highway into the city. Late at night. Cool wind breezing through the open window. The lights from the buildings shining in the distance as the moon sits high in the sky. Not a soul on the open road. Which is good, cause at that moment I remember I can't drive for shit and immediately crash into a ditch.

**jasannn** (8.7): Mayonaka no Door/ Stay With Me outsold

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): I finally know what city pop is

**jman457** (8.2): cute little song

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): is this shoegaze?

**Awkward\_King** (8): this isnt bad at ALL but whenever the first note hits i think its headaches by raveena and then it isnt and so i get sad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): So I've honestly never been head-over-heels in love with this song. However, by the time you get this ballot, you guys will have seen the Faceshopping/Plastic Love Mashup I made back in November for a 70s soul shitpost. And the multiple times I've heard that has warmed me to the song. It's fun!

**musical\_pyn** (8): the beginning is just iconic, but the rest of the song doesn't live up to the hype

**rslashpoopheads** (8): it's no Mayonaka no Door but it'll do

**anothertown** (7): if I heard this in public somewhere it would be a collapse. Listening to it at my desk does not give the same effect.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I love this production. The vocals are great too.

**plastichaxan** (6.5): kinda was expecting more from the song that showed up on my youtube recommendations for months?

**Alumineous** (5): My main gripe of this song is the lack of any buildup. The production feels monotonous to me and it would have been solved if there was a strong instrumental break or a bridge. The English outro is a lazy climax. Plus, the production is nothing special for city pop. I'm more bothered that the production never changes because I KNOW Tatsuro can be more dynamic than this.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): not much to say about it though i do like the trumpets

throwaway-7650: OMG fantastic results! Plastic Love winning over Bad Girls (only the former is a 10 sorry), Pantomime in the top 10 (just barely missed the 8 average though :soobcry:), SHINee in the top 15, and TXT almost made day 2 (and should've won songeniality :soobcry:). Thank you to the hosts for a great reveal and to the rest of the ratcom for all the prep that went into the games that were so fun to participate in!

edit: Reol in the top 10 as well ofc! continue to not rob non-english songs in AS5 pls and ty

TiltControls: Thanks for the rate Yetti and Roxie! It was a blast to watch even with the Reddit issues day 1. Also shoutout to everyone who hosted a ratemas game! They were a blast to participate in and watch. Really hope we do this again next year!

Anyways we've got some [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates coming!

#**Songs**

Congrats to **Plastic Love** for pulling out the win! As the only song above 9 from the rate it places **141th** against all other songs. Excited to see how it fares in Winners III!

And though it didn't make a splash on the leaderboards, **Santa's Homophobic** came very, **very** close to getting in for highest controversy. It's literally at spot #26. If it made it on it'd be the 4th Christmas song on the controversy leaderboard. And who is the artist blocking the song in spot #25? [Let's just say someone's getting revenge for placing lower than the song earlier in the rate](https://c.tenor.com/T3HmkMNZH5sAAAAM/fifth-harmony-cringe.gif)

#**Artists**

Let's get the big question out of the way. What happened with Kate's flop? Well don't worry too much Kate fans. Her average was already high enough it only really dropped her 1 spot on the leaderboards. 

Tori was another that dropped a little on the boards, but she's still top 10. And kept her 'no 0's' streak going for another song.

Here's the new top for reference

|Rank|Change|Artist|Average|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1|--|Aretha Franklin|8.646|
|2|+1|Jessie Ware|8.583|
|3|-1|Kate Bush|8.558|
|4|--|The Supremes|8.470|
|5|--|Lauryn Hill|8.425|
|6|+1|Curtis Mayfield|8.377|
|7|+1|Donna Summer|8.374|
|8|+1|Fleetwood Mac|8.362|
|9|-3|Tori Amos|8.334|
|10|--|Phoebe Bridgers|8.324|

(Also not shown, but Bjork's average increased - though not enough to raise her any spots)

#**Rate**

**Ratemas** ends up with the **3rd highest 11 spread** (86.11% songs got at least one). Only 5 songs didn't pick up any („ÄéCrazy ÂÆåÂÖ®„Å™Â§ß‰∫∫„Äè, Jumpsuit, Crash, to be mine, Magnificent).

Though it didn't make the list for 0 spread, it came close with 50% of the songs submitted picking up at least one.
