2010 High Concept Pop Reveal Day One: Lost in High Concept Pop Land
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/rdk9fz/2010_high_concept_pop_reveal_day_one_lost_in_high/

 

Hello! Welcome to day one of the HCP rate reveal. Unfortunately due to technical difficulties, u/steelstepladder is unable to attend the reveal today, so I am running both the reddit and the beatsense.

I apologise if this is quite short, this only happened five minutes before the reveal was supposed to happen. You may be aware that the reveal was supposed to happen at 5:00pm EST time, it has been moved to 5:30pm EST to accommodate the writing of the post.

We had a very solid [74](https://pastebin.com/epqrZsE3) participants! Thank you everyone for submitting, and for dealing with all of the technical difficulties that happened over the course of the rate. 

Our average score was 7.846, which is an entirely respectable average, I think. Our average controversy score is 1.698, which means that any song with a controversy score above that is controversial.

\---
  

  
\*\*2dina3dworld\*\* (5): Many Moons was good, but this? Idk, talking backwards is kinda someone else’s thing (do 00s MCs!)
  

  
\---
  

  
\*\*frogaranaman\*\* (10): interludephobia be gone!!!!
  

  
\*\*throwaway7650\*\* (9.5): \[2010 youtube\] janelle a part of the illuminati confirmed !?
  

  
\*\*darjeelingdarkroast\*\* (8.7): My first non-ten that's not a suite. A sad moment of silence. But yes, in theory this song is very interesting. It's Many Moons played backwards. Reading what the lyrics really are, they are cryptic and engaging in this sci-fi fable. I think it's still an interesting choice but definitely not the most transcendant songs off the album.
  

  
\*\*akanewasright\*\* (8): I love Hikaru Utada - Sanctuary
  

  
\*\*apatel27\*\* (8): High Art. While not really a song gets points for being a god tier transition song
  

  
\*\*ReallyCreative\*\* (8): I played this backwards and it said "happy women's history month I guess"
  

  
\*\*AHSWeeknd\*\* (7): I can’t with filler tracks but the production is it
  

  
\*\*ignitethephoenix\*\* (7): okay someone better be playing this in reverse in the reveal so I can understand what’s going on
  

  
\*\*MoonlightByWindow\*\* (7): i mean it kinda goes off
  

  
\*\*nt96\*\* (7): She could be throwing slurs at me for all I know, yet I still live for this.
  

  
\*\*skargardin\*\* (7): For being a reversed track it actually works surprisingly well
  

  
\*\*stryxen\*\* (7): !!!!sssssay
  

  
\*\*TakeOnMeByA-ha\*\* (7): !gnos ecin
  

  
\*\*waluigiest\*\* (7): somehow it works despite not really sonically connecting the songs it’s in between
  

  
\*\*thedoctordances1940\*\* (6.2): yvan eht nioj outsold
  

  
\*\*\\\_\\\_Avaritia\*\* (6): Interesting interlude/closing to Tightrope, but honestly this probably ain't it. Next!
  

  
\*\*b\\\_o\\\_g\\\_o\\\_\*\* (6): uh it's neat I guess
  

  
\*\*CrimsonROSET\*\* (6): thunder.sfx
  

  
\*\*Ghost-Quartet\*\* (6): For those wondering what’s happening here, this is her song “Many Moons” played backwards. It functions well as an interlude but like… well it’s an interlude. You’re in the wrong neighborhood if you’re an interlude.
  

  
\*\*Leixander\*\* (6): probably the only track i'd delete from this album
  

  
\*\*musical\\\_pyn\*\* (6): nice vocal effects but not a while lot going on
  

  
\*\*runaway3212\*\* (6): she has better interludes
  

  
\*\*Uberpigeon\*\* (6): fun fact this was recorded in the red room from Twin Peaks!
  

  
\*\*vayyiqra\*\* (6): Yeah this is very "just okay". I like the electric organ and the thunderstorm sounds, but also this goes nowhere and doesn't add a lot to the album. The backwards lyrics are kind of neat, I guess.
  

  
\*\*moonagenightmares\*\* (5.8): reminds me of the skam season 4 teaser. yes i am taking this opportunity to promo skam
  

  
\*\*seanderlust\*\* (5): paul is dead
  

  
\*\*slimboyfriend\*\* (5): ok it's more of an interlude so this is going to be my lowest score for this album by far
  

  
\*\*stsangie\*\* (5): ok
  

  
\*\*fadedblue09\*\* (4.5): Is this simlish
  

  
\*\*Blisterman\*\* (4): Missed a trick not calling this obmuG noeN.
  

  
\*\*bookthieving\*\* (4): many moons (simlish version)
  

  
\*\*Qwilphish\*\* (4): it literally came and went before I noticed what happened
  

  
\*\*wavingwolves\*\* (4): omfg is janelle trying to make me sell my soul to the devil? cause it's not working
  

  
\*\*welcome2thejam\*\* (4): Wait didn't I already rate Age of Adz
  

  
\*\*BleepBloopMusicFan\*\* (3.5): I don’t what tf she’s saying but girl I’m kinda bored.
  

  
\*\*modulum83\*\* (3): wait what
  

  
\*\*TiltControls\*\* (3): it's something alright
  

  
\*\*UselessTacooo\*\* (3): I understand why it’s here, I just wish it wasn’t.
  

  
\*\*IIIHenryIII\*\* (2): now she's just asking to get bad scores
  

  
\*\*mudkip1\*\* (2): gyesh nyesh nyesh nyesh nyesh
  

  
\*\*Awkward\\\_King\*\* (1): Ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup i
  

  
\*\*cremeebrulee\*\* (0): oh help i thought it actually started raining here

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): playing two truths, one lie with the discord server (which was actually all lies, soz lol), people were very sure that Sufjan didn’t have anything in the bottom 5. Sorry, fam.

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this will probably be the first sufjan song to go out and i admit it is bottom-tier on this album - but i still love it! i interpret this to be about an unhealthy/toxic relationship (hence the “i love you”s interspersed with the pleas to not walk away and ignore the narrator) - something which i find interesting is how this is the only song on the album which is a similar length to futile devices and both are about romantic relationships (in my opinion) but they’re also wildly different in tone. and quality

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's the weakest track on the album and will almost surely go day 1, but there's still a place for this song and that's just Sufjan's power

**stryxen** (9): someone hold me and tell me its going to be alright

**Qwilphish** (8.5): Obviously this came first, but this reminds me of the music and sound effects in the game Baba is You with that squeaky/squishy noise in the production. Anyone else here play that game? I love it, but it makes me feel so dumb.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Giving space age

**IIIHenryIII** (8): the least best track

**seanderlust** (7.7): kind of interesting, but mostly just washes over me

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): i could see this is undertale

**throwaway7650** (7.5): the lyrics at the beginning are me to my dad :zsob:

**wavingwolves** (7.5): realizing this is the kind of relationship i have with most people in my life was... something

**akanewasright** (7): I can’t lie this is like the one moment on the album I don’t have a super strong opinion on. Still good, I just wouldn’t stick my head out for it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): One of the weaker points on the album for me. It suffers for me of being vague, sparse instrumentation and also more generic lyrics. Unlike Now That I'm Older, that has vivid, peculiar lyrics to wrap your head around, here things feel incomplete in intention. This album is full of intention and artistic committment, so this is a more flat song for me.

**frogaranaman** (7): the issue with every post on r/relationships

**stsangie** (7): i won't be funny with you sorry daddy

**waluigiest** (7): definitely not a dud, but it doesn’t sparkle like the rest of the album

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): it's just a little bit whiney innit

**sirpancakeXI** (6.5): it isn't a bad song per se but compare with all the masterpiece on this album this song really isn't that memorable.

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): too short to make anything out of, but as a sort of interlude it works.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): feels more like an interlude than an actual song

**vayyiqra** (6): Yeah. This song is the one song on this album I think it's widely agreed isn't that good. I mean, it's short, and its placement in the tracklist makes it convenient for when you need to get up in the middle of this long album for a break. However, there is already another, much better on this album about finding it hard to communicate ("Futile Devices") so it doesn't add much. It's an okay song, it just has a strong interlude energy. Anyway, that's all I can say about it. I often forget it's there.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This is fine as an interlude track but it kinda doesn’t go anywhere.

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): This song ended like a few seconds ago and I struggled to remember what the fuck it sounded like, I guess that's just bad co-

**Blisterman** (4): The squelchy synth is deeply unsettling to me.

**modulum83** (4): is this what my friends hear when i show them my synthpop demos

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): the song ended

**BeauMeringue212** (3): No Sufjan you're so sexy don't drag down your average like this hahaha

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): don’t really know why he included this one, it doesn’t sound good?

**mudkip1** (3): I wanna know his thought process during the creation of whatever this is

**runaway3212** (3): mess

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): another boring song that does nothing for me. at least its short

**Uberpigeon** (3): this song was originally called just 'Communication' but it was renamed because it was bad

**ignitethephoenix** (2.5): I just hear descending wet farts in the production and it distracts from the rest of the song

**fadedblue09** (0): Somehow the shortest song also manages to be the biggest waste of time. Also electrofarts are not cute

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Interludephobia will strike again

**frogaranaman** (10): intro-phobia is real!!!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): magnificent

**throwaway7650** (10): #down with the british #tea #coldplay

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Just wanted to say that Gorillaz had thr finest interludes in the rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): It's very pretty! Good that Damon got this English orchestra to set the tone for the album.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (8): It might go out first, but that won’t prevent me from trying to save it

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a lovely intro but I prefer Janelle's overtures, the transition does HIT though

**sirpancakeXI** (8): you honestly can't go wrong with orchestra

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Not a bad intro, but it do be just an intro though. Next!

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): instruments

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): pretty but it is an intro

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): definitely prefer this to the janelle instrumentals

**apatel27** (7): It's an intro. Works well as that. Nothing else to say. Sets the scene well

**Awkward\_King** (7): it is nice

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): pretty intro

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is an awesome intro but…it’s just an intro.

**skargardin** (7): Nothing like an orchestral intro to emphasize a project being truly high concept.

**stryxen** (7): an intro with orchestral elements 😳

**wavingwolves** (7): nice

**seanderlust** (6.8): while it's just a short intro, i really love moments like this that are meant to set the scene for an album. i want more of them!

**akanewasright** (6): it’s nice but Janelle’s intros are better

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This would be better if it were a full on overture like Janelle had.

**jackisboredtoday** (6): idk. its exactly what it says on the box. an orchestral intro and nothing more

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): i mean slay i guess

**musical\_pyn** (6): good intro, but definitely lacks the substance of any other track in this rate really

**Qwilphish** (6): Its an intro :shrug: what else can I say, its pretty at least. Why does this album have two intros though

**stsangie** (6): stream the archandroid

**modulum83** (5.5): it's fine. it's an orchestral intro.

**RandomHypnotca** (5): there's better orchestral instrumental tracks in this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): idk why albums always have to have intro tracks like this as separate songs. how hard would it have been to just have this and welcome to the world of plastic beach combined in one song

**TiltControls** (5): I'm curious if the instrumentals will actually outlast anything

**vayyiqra** (5): This is okay, but you know, it's a minute long so there's not much to rate.

**mudkip1** (4): she certainly came and went

**runaway3212** (4): kinda boring compared to other openers here

**Blisterman** (3): A pleasant enough intro. Not one I’d listen to on its own. I have to give credit to Gorillaz for splitting it into its own easily skippable track.

**Uberpigeon** (3): chromatica outsold all the orchestral interludes in this rate

**UselessTacooo** (3): Just a string interlude. Nothing remarkable.

**moonagenightmares** (2.5): meh even for an intro

**AHSWeeknd** (10): would’ve made a great closer

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this sounds so…. melancholic. I really like it.

**ReallyCreative** (10): gorgeous wow

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): wait maybe THIS is the 11 contender, like a balm for the soul

**TiltControls** (10): I feel like this is gonna get robbed, but I love the atmosphere it brings

**throwaway7650** (9.5): :goofyfloat:

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): this should be the closer

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): There's my bestie Bobby back! If you're reading this, it's not too late to submit a 70s Soul ballot, lol! And Damon's not doing stuff I dislike here!!! A gorgeous, sweeping psychadelic soul and baroque pop stunner!

**apatel27** (8.5): A nice way to close out the album and the story of the plastic beach

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): that’s the only track I kinda didn’t like on first listen, but it’s grown on me

**fadedblue09** (8): wow from all those dystopian future sounds we're now in the 60s.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): a cool closer that really should have been the end of extended more tbh. Womack’s voice fits way better here.

**modulum83** (7.5): this song is fine but i'm so glad it's not the ending lmao

**1998tweety** (7): shes alright

**akanewasright** (7): Floating

**jackisboredtoday** (7): this is basically a Bobby Womack solo and I just wanna say stream The Bravest Man in the Universe for more like this (but even better)

**vayyiqra** (7): It's too bad this is going to bomb because it's a ballad, because Bobby Womack's performance on this is, in fact, great. The lyrics were really interesting to read about as well being full of references to

**ignitethephoenix** (6): idk why I can tolerate Bobby on Stylo but I’m not a fan here

**runaway3212** (6): kinda meh

**stsangie** (5.5): i sure know the score tho lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This is a great vocal performance but the songs just kind of meanders.

**Blisterman** (5): I love Bobby Womack. But this does nothing for me.

**stryxen** (5): flop of un-no-ing girl idk

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its not bad but theres nothing really happening either

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): nothing is progressing so I can’t realistically give it a higher score than this. The vocals also sound a mess.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): orchestral stuff is really nice but the rest is kinda a snooze

**sirpancakeXI** (3): it almost make me fall asleep.

**ChidiArianaGrande** (2): this song sucks but not in the way that Glitter Freeze sucks its just not a good song.

**Awkward\_King** (1): i know it is called cloud of unknowing but do we know why this needs to exist

**2dina3dworld** (3): SWEEEEEPPPPPPSTAKES

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): YEAH YOU, I’m looking @ you who gave this a bad score, you tasteless coward. FOR SHAME.

**Awkward\_King** (10): when we sweeping and we bopping we swapping

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this is fucking wild, it sounds like a circus on a merry go round, super disorienting and sinister and just really off the wall and I love it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Possibly the most bat-sh*t song on the album. This album is so great because it can have a song like this right after On Melancholy Hill/Broken and it all makes sense.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh this BUILDS

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is musical genius by dorian electra but for straight people

**stryxen** (10): SWEEEEEEPSTAAAAAAKES

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): this song makes me lose my fucking mind

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this is so fun

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): flabster

**stsangie** (9): YOU'RE A WINNER

**apatel27** (8.5): Life is a carnival and anyone that believes in capitalism is the clown

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): wow the phrase “sweepstakes” takes me BACK… what’s my Neopets login

**frogaranaman** (8): it just keeps building and getting better as it goes on

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): SWEEPSTEAAAAAAAKS

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): LOVE the percussion here. indifferent on the rest

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's an interesting direction but ultimately I think they could have cut this one

**welcome2thejam** (7): Using a brass section makes this a winner

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): is started out this song thinking what the fuck is going on and was weirdly enjoying it by the end. still confused

**wavingwolves** (6.6): as the song went on my enjoyment decreased by a lot but it's still good

**celladonn** (6): I know it's meant to be but this is so cacophonous

**UselessTacooo** (6): I have no clue what’s happening here but I think I like it more than I dislike it?

**seanderlust** (5.6): the conflicting time signatures that i think is going on here is interesting in concept but makes for a very jarring listening experience

**fadedblue09** (5.5): teeters on annoying territory

**AHSWeeknd** (5): These lyrics scream late-2000s 🥴

**sirpancakeXI** (5): this song is like laughably bad, but i can't bring myself to 0 it because i just laugh at this track.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.8): yeah honestly very clearly the worst song on this album, it's just annoying for the most part although the progression of the song is kinda cool at least

**modulum83** (4.5): i don't hate this song as much i remembered doing so before but it still sounds like mos def is trying to sell me an MLM while a 15-car pileup happens in the background

**Blisterman** (4): Sounds like it belongs in Donkey Kong, and not in a good way.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): Oof, I feel like a big ol' jerk. Maybe at the Beatsense reveal watching that live performance tanked this song for me, I fear. Something about the cohesion of this song seems so amateurish, if Damon was trying to go for a improvisational feel I don't get it at all. The beat makes no sense as Yasiin is trying to rap over it. The lyrics are clever about people winning things and the trophies eventually become trash. I wish it was a better song, it sounds like a mess. And for the ingredients within the song, it goes way too long. The chorus "SWEEPSTAKES" also really sucks and is pretty annoying.

**mudkip1** (4): this was awful until the halfway point

**nt96** (3): how about we sweep this out on day 1 reveal.

**runaway3212** (3): more like flopstakes

**waluigiest** (2): I just feel like there’s nothing here. I do like the brass that come in towards the end, but none of the pieces fit together. The lyrics fall flat for me. And it goes on for SO LONG

**Qwilphish** (1): That sweepstakes line is so awful. Ruins the entire song for me

**throwaway7650** (0): you won (the 0)!

**vayyiqra** (0): Oh no, this song is not going to do well, is it. It is Quirky but not in the way we like here, and kind of dissonant, and highly repetitive but also kind of long, and it's hard to follow what the hell these guys are talking about. There are just a lot of things going against this song. It's a mess, and not in the way that many Age of Adz songs are a mess but it's enjoyable. Sorry Mos Def, I know you're a legend, but this is Not Good.

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): Firstly. This was the highest placing Plastic Beach song after I put the first five ballots in the rate machine. I don’t get what y’all see in it, maybe it’s hyperpop or whatever but to me it’s just not anything to write home about. However, there are points in this where it does sound suspiciously like someone lowering the motor on a jetboat, and I guess it wins points for that because I grew up on the lakes and hearing that motor sound gives me an intense sense of nostalgia.

---

**cremeebrulee** (10): finally an instrumental track in this rate that doesn't feel derivative

**modulum83** (10): i'm such a little whore for electronic music tbh

**stryxen** (10): this is disco city pop camp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i listen to merzbow for fun this does not phase me at all

**CrimsonROSET** (9): beep boop

**sirpancakeXI** (9): this will be robbed so hard i can feel it in my bones

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): this sounds so good to blow on your speakers

**akanewasright** (8): flabster

**ChidiArianaGrande** (8): This song sucks

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): This is a camp 8 (usually a Camp 10, but I can't give this song a 10 it's not in my heart lmao). I'm just so amused that popheads are rating the eternal curmudgeon, Mark E. Smith--one step closer into popheads exploring his dour, angular post-punk!! The whole song actually makes me feel like I'm hearing an old-timey HG Wells radio play, or a 50s sci-fi B-Movie. And that's a positive for me. In a weird way, I feel some levity from this track because it's so out there and Mark is being so dramatic in the song. Havin' a blast and totally wired rn!!!

**ReallyCreative** (8): annoying but make it :velmaserve:

**runaway3212** (8): This is like that one good Phoenix song in IPR

**throwaway7650** (8): is this CROWN - TOMORROW x TOGETHER?

**waluigiest** (8): that Morse Code bit was so cool! But there are 4 more minutes of song?

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Honestly not a terrible track at all, but it’s definitely a little bit… too chaotic and meandering for its own good? The instrumentation is pretty cool though.

**TiltControls** (7.5): Cool to jam along to, but kinda easy to forget about when the song ends

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): has some cool bits but a very obvious weak point of the album

**AHSWeeknd** (7): sounds like that tool the dentist uses

**BeauMeringue212** (7): the most beep bop boop song, but I'm not mad at it

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a jam for sure, though it has barely any lyrics and I'm not sure what it has to do with the overarching plot of the album. But whatever, it's a nice groove.

**welcome2thejam** (7): This is the type of sound where if I heard this while staring at the right amount of strobe lights I can give myself an out-of-body experience

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): i want to like this more since the theremin (i think) sounds really good but it kinda just keeps doing the same thing & doesn’t do a ton with the good idea it has

**seanderlust** (6.7): the gary glitter beat on a song called glitter freeze....their mind UGH

**celladonn** (6.5): .. - ... / --- -.-

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): hyperpop

**apatel27** (6): Up the North but Fuck Mark E. Smith

**Blisterman** (6): I still say "Where's north from 'ere" whenever I need to orient myself".

**frogaranaman** (6): I feel like all 2010s semi-electronic albums all have to have some weird instrumental song that you would only get if you heard it live

**ignitethephoenix** (6): spaceships go pew pew

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): sounds like I'm getting a cavity filled

**Qwilphish** (5): Pretty cool instrumental track although it does get repetitive and spooky

**UselessTacooo** (4.5): I don’t really like the conversational tone to the track, but I do like it sonically so bonus points.

**Awkward\_King** (4): this feels more like a science experiment than a song

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): the morse code bit actually goes off but this goes on way too long for an interlude

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): The phaser/laser sound effect is cool - didn’t need to hear it 100 times.

**Leixander** (0): we're just going to pretend we didn't hear that

**nt96** (0): There's not a single thing about this song that's remotely redeemable, believe me I counted.

**wavingwolves** (0): headache inducing if i'm honest

**2dina3dworld** (4): not going to lie, this really does sound like Lou Reed phoned it in. It also sounds suspiciously like Stylo and Superfast Jellyfish’s lovechild, but that does not make it good.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Lou Reed, icon.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t trust this sub to give King Lou his due at all, but I’m doing what I can.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): just great

**modulum83** (9): i like to imagine lou reed just wandered into the studio while they were recording and they just kept it in the song

**ReallyCreative** (9): a legend, rest in peace Lou Reed

**stryxen** (9): some kind of slay sure

**moonagenightmares** (8.6): they even got lou reed on this album damn

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): i don't know if this song is slightly overrated or if fantano absolutely loving it has made me overestimate how popular it actually is

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): this is the second best song lou reed has ever made

**ChidiArianaGrande** (8): Lou Reed my love <3

**CrimsonROSET** (8): an impossible soul, perhaps

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Another camp 8, plz someone give me a better sense of humor lmao. This is the pipeline for popheads to be rating Metal Machine Music and LULU! We did it!! Anyway, conceptually it's a cool song to hear Lou rattle off all the different ways he loves to pollute the earth and how some kind of gold is also some chemical load. No better music villain to deliver the message than Lou Reed! Also, eff it, you're welcome besties https://rave.dj/SIMLLP0XSEyezw

**frogaranaman** (8): I like how Lou Reed just kinda talks the entire song, like lmao same I do that too

**Uberpigeon** (8): i know lou reed from that lana del rey song!

**runaway3212** (7.5): Wow this lou reed person is really good I wonder about his other release in the early 2010s Im sure it's really good

**seanderlust** (7.3): I love it when gorillaz feature Underground local indie artists <3

**1998tweety** (7): bop

**welcome2thejam** (7): Praying that Lou Reed will protect us boys from the spiritual poison too

**Qwilphish** (6.5): I enjoyed myself during this, the vocals are very nice

**Blisterman** (6): I do really like when Damon comes in “Some kind of Nature”.

**slimboyfriend** (6): Stan Transformer

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): the kind of song that’s lyrically/thematically one of the better songs on a record but just way less enjoyable sonically

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): The instrumentation is a little weird/not very captivating + Lou Reed’s vocals don’t really fit this ong well at all. Hurts to give this one a low score given Lou is such a legend but sorry...

**sirpancakeXI** (5): the feature is kinda not it

**wavingwolves** (5): lou reed over this production doesn't work at all but it's not unpleasant at least

**BeauMeringue212** (4): I'm sorry but Lou Reed's voice always freaks me out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): lou reed more like poo peed

**throwaway7650** (4): #fadtano he's #OVER for liking this mid

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): it just felt like a snoozefest.

**nt96** (3): I'd rather stream Lulu.

**MoonlightByWindow** (2.5): damn they couldn’t have given lou reed a better song than this?

**vayyiqra** (2): This song is really testing my statements in other comments about not being malevoicephobic. Lou Reed is a legend, I have respect for him, but he is not and has never been a good singer. The instrumental isn't very good either. Also, it doesn't help that I dislike this song's lyrics implying that humans inherently pollute and destroy nature. I'm not big on the idea of us being inherently bad at all - if that's true, why care about the planet? Why bother with anything? It might be an interesting question to raise, but in the end it's such a nihilistic thought and a dead end. Anyway, this song isn't very good sorry!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): love me some pirates

**AHSWeeknd** (8): would the taps ever run out of water or would they keep running?

**apatel27** (8): A neat epilogue to end the album on.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): iron gem iron gem iron gem iron gem iron gem iron gem

**UselessTacooo** (8): should have been longer, but it’s a pretty fitting outro to the album.

**RandomHypnotca** (7.8): Pirate Jet, Fire Jet Fire Jet, Higher Jet, Higher Yet, Iron Jet, Are You Yet, Higher Yeah etc.

**1998tweety** (7.5): i like this tbh

**throwaway7650** (7.5): stream pirate by everglow and give dun dun/la di da 10s/11s

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I like this but it’s a little underwhelming as a closer.

**fadedblue09** (7): I guess it makes sense as an epilogue, but not really impactful

**Qwilphish** (7): The synth that is used through this song is a great callback from the rest of the album where that sound is used a bunch. A successful closer for a good album!

**Uberpigeon** (7): pirate jet

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): decent closer but def the worst one in this rate compared to babopbyeya and impossible soul...

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Again not a really bad track but couldn’t this track have been closer be a little more… focused? Less just unable to tell if it’s supposed to be epic or whimsical? I dunno. This record is still just as hard to swallow as it was the first time.

**akanewasright** (6): I can never decide if I like this or not

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): this should not be the closer

**Blisterman** (6): Too many comedy boner “boing” sounds.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): So this is a personal preference thing. I love sweeping, grandoise closings to albums. On the one hand, I get that this is like a little outro that's us saying goodbye to our zany journey to Plastic Beach. Still, the song feels dinky after the sweeping Cloud of Unknowing we just experience.

**ReallyCreative** (6): not how I would have closed the album... let's just say that

**vayyiqra** (6): This so short it's more like a coda than a song, and it has an ending-credits vibe to it. I kind of like it. The lyrics are bleak though, since it seems to be about the narrative ending with the world being destroyed by garbage and it's inevitable. That's dark.

**frogaranaman** (5): have y'all ever been on a private jet? me neither. fucked up concept

**skargardin** (5): this isn't terribly intersting to me

**welcome2thejam** (5): The very concept of a Pirate Jet would also make me chant non-stop for a Pirate Jet

**wavingwolves** (4): circus music???

**seanderlust** (3.5): this is a really weird close to the album

**nt96** (2): no

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): such a disappointing album closer

**mudkip1** (1): good the albums over

**2dina3dworld** (10): It’s the defeated and sullen way he sings this song. Beautiful.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Gave me Bowie vibes tbh

**stryxen** (10): Oh no! ☹️ Our love! ☹️ It’s brocken! ☹️

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i used to imagine amvs in my head to this song with my favorite anime characters crying

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): You gotta love those Good Bad Ugly background whistles.

**runaway3212** (9): sHE's brOKen

**Blisterman** (8): Really like the synths and the vibes on this one.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcZd305VI60

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): oh no

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this is such a letdown after the heavenly experience that was the previous track

**nootnoot781** (8): oh no… our table… it’s broken (5 probably, because i’m incapable of original thoughts)

**ReallyCreative** (8): not huge on the verses but I like the chorus

**stsangie** (8): not them being brocken i- 💀🥀⛓️

**UselessTacooo** (8): Borken Haert :grinny:

**modulum83** (7.8): sHE's brOKen

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): sounds like video game music

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): Oh No!

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Sometimes I wish the synths on this record didn’t sound so fucking wonky half the time cos it works sometimes but then there’s songs like this where it’s like… hmm.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): So the album is almost over, but this is the first song that kind of lays out the world of Plastic Beach.

**fadedblue09** (6): really unremarkable

**frogaranaman** (6): I like how you're broken, broken like me / maybe that makes me a fool

**seanderlust** (6): s(he's) br(gorillaz)en

**vayyiqra** (6): There is way too much lore behind Gorillaz for me to get fully into them during this rate, and this is a good example of why, since the lyrics led me to a Livejournal page from 2006, and I had no clue what the hell I was reading, so I won't bother with that. I'll just give it a 6 and move on.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): This song is giving me filler vibes. It's giving Flimsy Steve-core (I'm sure we all want to avoid making Flimsy Steve references, but a gal can't help it). It's giving the most by-the-numbers Gorillaz song. It's very meandering and formless. Also, lol at the NME interview with Murdoc: "Erm….I don’t really know what to say about this track, y’know, like Frank Zappa said “talking about music is like fishing about architecture”. This track just works. I don’t want to talk about it. Is that, OK?" Murdoc, bb, you can't just namedrop Zappa and say "This track just works". There are flaws in the foundation, sweetie!!

**Awkward\_King** (5): dachi/steel pleek play broken clocks by sza

**J\_Toe** (5): the songs are getting a little homogenous by this point

**waluigiest** (4): and this is even more boring

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): :sleeping_accommodation:

**wavingwolves** (2): felt like i had gotten enough of this after the first minute

**throwaway7650** (1): if murdoc niccals has nothing to say about this track, I don't either

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): I’m not gonna pretend I remember anything from this track. It’s filler.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is exactly what I want a song called “Plastic Beach” to sound like, twinkly, sun baked, and a little bit analogue.

**stryxen** (10): Cassie O is on a plastic beach?? cassie girl the pollution get out of there!

**xxipil0ts** (10): Best title track from an album

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): I love Mick Jones, Lost In The Supermarket is one of the greatest pop songs ever written but we are not ready for that conversation.

**modulum83** (9): casio getting that product placement bag iktr

**ReallyCreative** (9): obviously really great for the theme of the album, but I don't think it holds up against some of the stronger songs on the record

**seanderlust** (9): i'm a sucker for the scales the synth does in the beginning

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): Gorillaz on plastic beach: consumerism is destroying the world Also Gorillaz on plastic beach: hey here's a cool little song about my Casio, let's make it the title track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Really good but I do prefer the other song on this album with “Plastic Beach” in the title.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I never knew Mick Jagger and Paul Simon have both worked with Gorillaz; they’re not indie afterall

**Awkward\_King** (8): i think this song probably means something

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I'm a sucker for arpeggios! We love Damon and the Clash vibing!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): luv this chorus

**Qwilphish** (8): The titular track definitely delivers on helping to add to the story of this album. Also helps that the chorus is so catchy.

**runaway3212** (8): I fucking hate England

**AHSWeeknd** (7): is the Casio contributing to the plastic?

**Blisterman** (7): A Clash of styles.

**1998tweety** (6): this would be better without the singing

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Probably the point of the album that it really starts to lose its lustre, no longer is it really very much catchy at all but rather just feels like it’s going through the motions. Like it’s not bad but… eh??

**vayyiqra** (6): I have no idea how they got The Clash on this track since it sounds nothing like their music, but that's cool they got one of their biggest influences to do a song with them. The song itself is good, I guess. I like the keyboard.

**waluigiest** (5): it’s the plastic beach, it’s a beach made of plastic

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): It sounds like a fun jam session, but also one that should’ve stayed unreleased.

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): dumpster fire trash pop (compliment).

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): when i saw gorillaz live they played this song and the people sitting next to me got left during it and never came back

**wavingwolves** (3): now who asked for the baby voice

**throwaway7650** (2): this grew off me so much

**CrimsonROSET** (0): roll credits

**mudkip1** (0): THIS IS FUCKING GRATING OMG I’M MISERABLE

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Serving auto tune from the year 2070

**apatel27** (10): The electric guitar tho

**runaway3212** (10): I love getting high and smelling good

**seanderlust** (10): this has such a trippy soundscape! i love it. i usually highlight one song that almost got my 11 in these comments, so here is where i say that at the very last minute i switched my 11 from this song to...another one

**skargardin** (10): very fittingly psychedelic

**waluigiest** (10): WOW this is just this perfectly psychedelic sex track. The filtering throughout is incredible

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): More vibes

**frogaranaman** (9): I'm allergic go mushrooms. Janelle PLEASE delete this song I am begging-

**musical\_pyn** (9): this is almost like a lost beatles track

**Uberpigeon** (9): I can FEEL this getting robbed

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): The song gets an uptick from me due to the seering electric guitar solo towards the back end. But it certainly feels a bit turgid at the beginning with the specific vocal effect chosen. The lyrics though are cool and descriptive in a deliberately psychadelic way. I like how we get a little detour to this bar within the story. As a certified pretentious person, I'll throw out one of my favorite words and say it all feels so picaresque.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it's cool but I'm not in love with it like the rest of the album

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): You know what one scene in Scott Pilgrim when Scott's brain goes from Doesn't Get It to Gets It? That's what happened when I googled the lyrics for this, not knowing how Mushrooms and Roses actually go together, and found out what it actually meant

**Blisterman** (8): Psychedelic rock befitting the title.

**slimboyfriend** (8): a psychedelic sex trip

**throwaway7650** (8): I thought my spotify switched to a madonna album

**modulum83** (7.8): this is just insane enough to work for me

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): i feel like i should love this, the guitar is awesome, but the rest is just like eh

**CrimsonROSET** (7): badger badger badger badger badger badger badger

**stryxen** (7): i would have given this a 10 like two months ago but it grew off me slightly recently, the guitar still FUCKS tho

**welcome2thejam** (7): Can't say I enjoy the "I'm speaking into a fan" vocal effect, but the ending guitar work more than makes up for it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): this goes on for too long

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): not songs with the words roses in the title on this album are not good

**Qwilphish** (6.5): Its enjoyable but Im not able to pick up most of the lyrics

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): the vocoder makes me genuinely uncomfortable, but the production is so good that I can’t tank it.

**fadedblue09** (6): It's okay but I honestly enjoy this mostly for the instrumental alone. Probably one of the more unnecessary tracks tbh

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I wish I liked this more than I do

**IIIHenryIII** (6): penises and vaginas, but make it poetic

**RandomHypnotca** (5.5): there's distorted vocals… and then there's THIS

**DaHumanTorch** (5.3): this was certainly a song!

**IdiotBox01** (5): they tried to sneak a Tame Impala song in there but you can't fool me!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): aw hell nah they put janelle’s vocals in the vaporwave machine

**TiltControls** (5): I don't think this song has enough going on to last this long

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): is this shoegaze

**vayyiqra** (4): Yeah. This is another song like Neon Gumbo with some good ideas, but hampered by how it goes nowhere. I get that it's about drugs and is meant to be psychedelic, but it's still not that good. Also not to be slowsongphobic or longsongphobic, but it does drag despite not even being that long (I can handle long songs, I'm a Sufjwiftie). The only song on this album where I get a little tempted to skip.

**Awkward\_King** (3): this is camp in a not camp way

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This probably my least favorite song in this rate - I just think it’s pretty boring. But I just don’t feel right giving it a zero. I’ll pass on that for this rate.

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): the guitar saves this from being a 0

**mudkip1** (1): awful!

**wavingwolves** (1): choices were made and none of them were good

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): the orchestral intro is really pretty! But then it all turns to shit.

---

**apatel27** (10): Kano and Bashy going bar for bar in a fun way plus a bomb instrumental. What's not to like?

**IIIHenryIII** (10): if that’s what a plastic beach looks like, I’m totally down for the destruction of the planet

**ReallyCreative** (10): The rap being in Simlish would have made this an 11

**seanderlust** (10): i love this so much. i love the orchestral opening, i love the flow of the two rappers. it's just so cool.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): my standard is literally on the floor when i hear any orchestra part in the song. i honestly will give most orchestra involved song a good score.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): I love everything about this track! The National Orchestra of Arabic music starting us off, then Bashy and Kasho trading bars. I think it's an interesting that after Murdoc dropped them off at Plastic Beach, Bashy and Kano's first impressions are kinda...positive? That throughout the rap, them being stranded gives them almost a peace of mind. To speculate a bit, it's almost telling that two black men living in the predominantly white place of England feel a sense of relief getting away from the systemic issues they're facing. Overall, a very cool, experimental track, great groove and great stitching of various elements!

**TiltControls** (9): BUT I WILL GO DOWN WITH THIS SHIP. AND I WON'T PUT MY HANDS UP AND SURRENDER

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this is goofy as fuck

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): One of the weirdest songs on a very weird album.

**modulum83** (8.5): gorillaz truly live in THE society

**stsangie** (8.5): amd

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Love that flute solo. Is it a flute? Maybe it’s a robot, I’m not sure tbh.

**celladonn** (8): I like the orchestral elements, and the interplay between the two rappers is fun

**fadedblue09** (8): very fun cinematic instrumental

**frogaranaman** (8): this song's feature setlist truly encapsulates Gorillaz's core energy

**waluigiest** (8): Breath of the Wild type beat

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): I thought I hated this song (and for that I have to thank Bashy) but the instrumentation… it’s not honestly that bad, I maybe wish they melded the electronic and ‘classical’ elements a little more seamlessly, but as individual parts they work pretty damn well. Kano’s verses were good too.

**akanewasright** (7.5): the rappers and the orchestra did what they had to do

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): what genre is this

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I really loved the intro and ending (we love Arabic music) but the rest of the song is just okay

**CrimsonROSET** (7): orchestra > kano > bashy

**J\_Toe** (7): this was so unexpected but so appreciated

**musical\_pyn** (7): I'm not the biggest fan of the beginning, but after that the song is great

**stryxen** (7): why does this make me wanna play runescape

**wavingwolves** (6.9): loving the instrumentation here

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): don’t try for a baby on the beach!!!

**moonagenightmares** (6.7): what is happening on this album

**1998tweety** (6.5): the last quarter of this song is giving idle music in an online flash game

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): kinda proto hyperpop...not sure if this is a good or bad thing

**runaway3212** (6): kinda a mess but a fun one

**throwaway7650** (6): kind of hear slowthai on the beat (edit: not gorillaz having a slowthai collab)

**vayyiqra** (6): This is kind of good at making Plastic Beach sound kinda based, if you ignore the environmental devastation. I guess that is the point. It would be kind of idyllic if it weren't for that, you know? Pollution bad and stuff. Anyway I don't like this flute, it's annoying. Otherwise this is okay.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Wait the string intro kind of reminds me of the Great British Bake-off theme music.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): banger instrumental less then banger rapping

**Blisterman** (5): Something about this feels like I’m playing N64.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): no shade but this sounds like the kind of music that straight men listen to

**Leixander** (4): the intro doesn't match with the rest of the song, which is a shame since that part is the highlight

**Qwilphish** (4): This is definitely played during the scene where the main character runs across the setting of the movie and interacts with the civilians who live there

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): The way they are rapping back and forth and suddenly a supersonic shart is inserted in the song gets me every time.

**BeauMeringue212** (3): didn't like the rapping and the eastern instrumental felt out of place in the song

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That chorus harmonizing scares me

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): fucking beautiful

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): remembering when this song randomly hit me a month ago and i looped it for like 2 hours...anyway this is easily one of my favourites on the album + i just find something about it so heartbreaking? sufjan was right because now that i AM older i find myself relating to this song more and more - the second-guessing of yourself, the realisation that as you’ve aged you’ve lost hard-won relationships, constantly wanting to give up because you’ve seen and done enough (at least that’s how i interpret it), and of course the KICKER “i thought i was so in love / some say it wasn’t true”

**musical\_pyn** (10): one of the much needed peaceful moments on the album, there is still so much going on. The song feels like it's at a standstill, like it's all taking place in a single moment. The lack of instrumentation helps with this feeling, but the vocal delivery is also incredible

**skargardin** (10): I'm trying my absolute hardest not to have a breakdown to this album

**stryxen** (10): this is the first adz song i fell in love with it just rips my heart out

**throwaway7650** (10): this midlife crisis anthem :soobcry: love the operetta

**vayyiqra** (10): I feel bad because I know some of you hated this song, but also I kind of get it. This is a rather slow ballad about experiences that many of you haven't had, so it's like that meme of the guy saying "you wouldn't get it". Popheads skews very young, I know, and as an oldhead (where "old" on here means "over about 25" which objectively isn't old but whatever) I can relate a lot more to what he is singing about here. I am not happy with my life at all, but one thing I can say is that I have gained a lot of painful lessons from life, and so will you. Listen to this song again in ten years and tell me if it hits different. I bet it will.

**seanderlust** (9.6): this sounds like a haunted recording of a 1940s ballad and i'm here for it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Another slow burner that is definitely relatable. It's an ethereal ballad about aging, change and reconciling desire. Some of the lyrics are cryptic here about dresses and a man in radiant colors. I like these abstract, freeform type lyrics as well. I think it's an aspect of music I enjoy a lot, like getting access to someone's inner world you may not fully understand.

**moonagenightmares** (9.3): angelic

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): now that I'm older, everything hurts!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): my sister heard this and said that it sounded like a funeral, so I told her to play at mine

**Leixander** (9): king of vocal layering

**UselessTacooo** (9): When Kesha said “beat so fat gonna make me cum”, she was actually talking about these choir vocals.

**waluigiest** (9): this is free therapy

**wavingwolves** (9): ribs by lorde made me a sucker for songs about ageing

**nt96** (8.5): popheads user at age 19 be like: same bestie

**akanewasright** (8): this is gorgeous and a bit chaotic

**CrimsonROSET** (8): what my parents assumed happened the second i turned 18

**runaway3212** (8): being older SUCKS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): The feminine choral background vocals kinda carry this one but lyrically I think it’s one of the most interesting on the album.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): maybe my lyrical favorite of the album, but the melodies here are off-kilter in a way that doesn’t totally do it for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I kinda dig this but also every time I’ve listened to it I’ve started watching a YouTube video over it because I get bored in the middle so… we’ll call it mixed.

**BeauMeringue212** (6.9): Sufjan coming to terms with entering his daddy era

**thedoctordances1940** (6.9): kinda really pretty but also kinda whiney

**stsangie** (6.5): ok hag

**modulum83** (6.3): do NOT play this one at a party long story and i'm not explaining it

**Uberpigeon** (6): me when im steelstepladder haha old

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): I guess I know why the previous song is called "I Walked" it's so that Lorde could run!

**Blisterman** (5): There's something wintery and blizzardy about this. The choir sounds like howling winds.

**ChidiArianaGrande** (4): snooze

**J\_Toe** (4): this is where I admit this kind of music is really not what I like listening to

**mudkip1** (4): this one kinda drags

**Qwilphish** (4): His vocals on this track make me highly uncomfortable for how pretty the production is.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): this sounds like a song that would play in the really dramatically sad part of a broadway musical and not in a good way. the singing in the last minute and a half is particularly unbearable

**fadedblue09** (1): These vocals are serving audition tape of a Broadway reject

**Awkward\_King** (0): why does his voice sound like he was just crying but not in a main character way like in a pathetic way

**ignitethephoenix** (0): sir lay off the vocal layering and creepy choir esque back up vocals

frogaranaman: I've been super into Sufjan Stevens since I had the Great Branching Out in 2009. Everyone I'm friends with now is very aware of this, and they tease me about it, whatever. Most of us like similar music outside of this, so it's not really a big deal. But I have to always listen to my suf privately. But I like to share with people, I like forming a community of bonds, whatever, you know?

So here I think, ok, I love this music, and a lot of other people do too, right? So clearly there's something there. And I know my friends love dancing. I have seen them. And I don't usually get to dance to my Sufjan Steevns, even though it is awesome whenever I do. And my birthday is coming up, so I'm like-- I am never allowed to do stuff like this, but if it's my birthday, I can throw whatever party I want! And people will want to celebrate with me, so they'll come, and then I will show them how fun it is to dance to Sufjan Stevens and we can have a cool moment of togetherness.

So my roommates agree, whatever, I invite people, I borrow some good speakers, I make a bumpin playlist of suf's best dance songs. I am filled with joy as I'm making it because of how much shit is packed into this music and how I can't wait to give people the opportunity to feel the way I feel, or at least give it a shot and like have a fun little dance party where all you gotta do is move your body how you want.


The friends arrive, we Inebriate, whatever-- there's some chill music playing, I have a short little Event, and when the Event is done, I turn off some of the lights and turn on the suf dance playlist and I start dancing.

No one else does.

So I'm all, whatever, I'll roll with the punches, I thought I started off using a good, more recognizable song with "Now That I'm Older," but maybe they just need to take awhile to get used to it sonically, they'll join in.

They don't.

A few songs go by before I vacate the dance floor myself, to try to do the Dance-Drag Some People Over There. Everyone flat-out refuses, standing and talking instead. I had two allies, two dudes who helped bring over the speakers beforehand. They'd go around and convince people to dance too, both real likeable dudes, and nothing. People refused. People I've been friends with for years. I was getting frustrated, cuz you know, I want people to be having fun but the Literal Name that this party was marketed as was "Sufjan Stevens Dance Party" or "suf dance party." They knew what this was going to be.

My next move was to try to announce to the group that we should all dance, because dancing really just needs some momentum. Once everyone is dancing your own moves don't mean anything and you're less self conscious. So I flip on the lights and remind people it is, in fact, an Sufjan Stevens dance party, so dance, or please leave. Lights back off, and then me and those two dudes and one of the dude's little sister and I start dancing and everyone else goes back to talking. And mind me, I put on a real banger at this point: Bluish. That song is so likeable, it's fucked up.

While I'm dancing, this other dude walks up to me and decides to hit me with the "You just can't dance to this is the thing. There's no beat." And I'm super like dude what, because the only rule that I made for this party with regards to the dance was "no bitching about the music." Those were my words. And here is this dude, BITCHING ABOUT THE MUSIC. So I tell him to leave, and he reassures me, "I was already on my way out."

So after that dude and his bad mood were gone, I was hopeful. Maybe he was like pulling down the General Comfort Level with the music. But nope. After dancing by myself for few more songs I'm ready to bail, so I shut off the music. People continue talking, but the smoke alarm starts going off and so that makes everyone leave except the two speaker dudes, and we chill for a bit, whatever.

And you know, it's really bothering me. I don't know what the reason nobody danced was. I don't know whether I was just being too weird about everything so anyone would have felt uncomfortable, or if this was just a shitty group of friends who would rather drink free booze than put a bit of effort into participating in something I was excited about. Since, I've been feeling weird when I listen to any suf.

My Advice for others on this undertaking: maybe don't. Just hope you can see them live next time they tour.

**Awkward\_King** (10): ok i understand mika now

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): BOP. We need to rate Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer btw.

**ChidiArianaGrande** (10): If you gave this one score lower I just don’t get you

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Alright here's the thing. This song will not probably fare well at all. It's bouncy, goofy and with strange lyrics. Sonically, this era with Of Montreal reminds me of MIKA, and we see how popheads fared with MIKA :grinny:. But hear me out! First, this song alone is ebullient and a silly bop. It's giving one of the goofy Beatles songs (Yellow Submarine), and their goofy asses just got an 8 hour documentary!!! Second, OF MONTREAL IS GOOD AND YOU SHOULD GIVE THEM A SHOT. Of Montreal/Kevin Barnes (non-binary, pronouns she/he/they) has been putting out albums since the late 90's. And for a band that started out cranking out lo-fi Neutral Milk Hotel-ass songs, they are an indie band SERVING visuals. Weird, camp and zany visuals and their live shows are apparently super fun!! Case 1 of a lewk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XVMgBw3A8c Case 2 of fun visuals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3XEgsPABZ8 If there's one album I say is essential listening, it's absolutely "Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?" A great song to check out from this album is "Gronlandic Edit". This album--it's new wave, it's indie pop, it's funk, it's Paul McCartney, it's Talking Heads, it's Prince, it's Sparks, it's so many things! Stream Hissing Fauna!

**frogaranaman** (10): this comment is about of Montreal: so when I was growing up, my parents had his CD for Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer? and I LOVED "A Sentence of Sorts in Kongsvinger" to death. every time I got into the car, I would ask for this song to play. every time. this went on for months, literally months, until my parents got sick of it and banned me from asking for it. anyways dope song

**Leixander** (10): this is so much fun, will be sad to see it paid dust

**ReallyCreative** (10): I think of this song anytime I'm about to miss the bus, so every morning

**stryxen** (10): me when i’ve got a terrible fixation (on impossible soul)

**stsangie** (10): this feels like being on a bus

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i havent called any song in this rate camp yet so im gonna use my camp card on this one. this is camp

**Uberpigeon** (10): this has extreme kate bush energy

**Qwilphish** (9.5): I LOVE THIS SONG, but Janelle is almost nowhere to be seen on it. Its so so so fun though. Its probably not everyone's tea, but its camp and psychedelic

**apatel27** (9): Thought Andre 3000 sang the first verse when I first heard this song

**celladonn** (9): This is such a bizarre contrast from the rest of the album but it does slap

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): wait my husband Kishi Bashi was in Of Montreal during 2010… lemme just bump this score up real quick

**sirpancakeXI** (9): this is very different from the rest of the album but i kinda dont mind the change of pace.

**vayyiqra** (9): This has haters? I don't get it. I get that the melody is weird and the lyrics don't all make little sense, but the production on this is bonkers. Of Montreal is really talented. This is Canadiophobic (it's not really I just felt like saying that; Of Montreal is not really from Canada it's just a name)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): It’s camp, overhated and wouldn’t get nearly as much backlash if it were an Of Montreal track feat. Janelle rather than on this album

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Ok this is basically just an Of Montreal song buried in the second half of the album, but I love it

**modulum83** (8.3): hey, this slaps! this fucks!

**akanewasright** (8): bop

**BeauMeringue212** (8): she's right I never make my bus :(

**IdiotBox01** (8): i dig it

**waluigiest** (8): this is a weird collaboration, and it mostly works!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): bop!

**moonagenightmares** (7.7): this is kinda fun

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): has some cute melodies

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The late-2000s vibe 🥴

**IIIHenryIII** (6): filler

**J\_Toe** (6): so unusual but also fun?

**welcome2thejam** (6): Went from being taken aback from the general weirdness to wishing more of it could hit the heights of the verses' delivery

**seanderlust** (5.3): um hey, can you literally go eat your juicy fruits anywhere else?

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): This production... really needed some help. If they wanted it to sound like it was a part of like, some modernized musical, they kind of succeeded, but that's not a good thing tbh!! Did Janelle even sing on this??

**cremeebrulee** (5): i appreciate the change in sound but i’m not into this, just feels very messy

**UselessTacooo** (4): I wish she missed the bus because then I wouldn’t have to deal with this shitshow of a song.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): the archandroid but make it annoying

**Blisterman** (3): I really dislike this track. It's the best example I can give of a terrible song on an otherwise brilliant album.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): perhaps you should have kept this song in the realm of fantasy

**fadedblue09** (3): devolves into self-parody territory I'm sorry

**throwaway7650** (2.5): this sounds like a parody song [derogatory]

**mudkip1** (2): this felt like it was 9 mins long

**wavingwolves** (2): pretty different from the rest of the record and not in a good way

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): this HORRID song omfg

**runaway3212** (0): Sorry this is terrible

**jackisboredtoday** (10): literally all three of them kill their verses here but Janelle’s rapping is so charismatic & this is legitimately one of my favorite things she did in her early career

**waluigiest** (10): what a cast! And I actually think this fits better with the album than the original

**IIIHenryIII** (8): she wasn't kidding when she said this was a remix

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): she really shouldve rerecorded her vocals for the chorus it sounds so off in this version

**CrimsonROSET** (7): too many cooks

**Leixander** (7): original is better, this is a nice take on the song though

**seanderlust** (6.5): did lupe fiasco just say he was gonna fight blind people?

**BeauMeringue212** (6): prefer the original tbh

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I actually think the features on this are quite good but the actual remix of the music is bad and drags it down, it removes all of what what made the original so fun to listen to

**ReallyCreative** (6): I appreciate it for what it is, but I do not particularly enjoy it

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I like Janelle's new verse and appreciate the audacity but..... I do not like this as a whole

**AHSWeeknd** (5): I was never a fan of Tightrope tbh 😔

**frogaranaman** (5): it's aight

**J\_Toe** (5): never heard this before today. I much prefer the original

**RandomHypnotca** (5): this is just unneccessary

**vayyiqra** (5): This is like, okay. It really doesn't need to exist. I feel nothing.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): aurr...not sure about this

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Take this to day 3 😤

**frogaranaman** (10): overture-phobia you suck!!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this takes me back to my childhood and listening to musical overtures and aggressively trying to sing along with all the melody lines

**ReallyCreative** (10): THE DRAMA!!

**runaway3212** (10): if anyone tanks this... I wish you a slight inconvience today

**throwaway7650** (10): suite III? more like candidate for earliest III songs out

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Overture is French for "Save us from interludephobia". Non, c'est vrai!

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): My brain is telling me you can’t give a 9 to an instrumental interlude but my heart is saying go ahead

**seanderlust** (9): motif alert!!

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): when the sequel is better than the original

**apatel27** (8): A next time on... in musical form

**Awkward\_King** (8): i actually think i will listen to this one just on its own this is so calming

**nt96** (8): Yes it's an interlude, yes I rated it higher than almost all of Gorillaz songs, no I'm not sorry. Argue with the wall.

**Qwilphish** (8): This one is just as good as the first overture, this one seems less scary overall

**akanewasright** (7.5): OH THAT ONE MELODY COMES BACK IM A DUMBASS

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): damn, these pretty orchestral interludes

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This overture always reminds me of Willie Wonka

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Tbh I’m giving all three instrumental interludes/intros in this rate the same score. They’re all quite pretty but not super engaging I feel.

**Blisterman** (7): Reminds me of a hundred old movie soundtracks.

**TiltControls** (7): this feels like line music for a disneyland ride

**UselessTacooo** (7): another amazing interlude thag I just can’t give more points to because it isn’t a properly finished song.

**modulum83** (6.5): yeah this is good ok ok get on with it

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Another decently done classical-inspired piece but I-... forgot this song the moment it ended... oops

**CrimsonROSET** (6): lightning.sfx

**stryxen** (6): it’s pretty

**vayyiqra** (6): Another pretty intro, but not quite as good as the first one.

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): honestly have no idea how to rate these

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is gonna sound really random but this song reminds me of the music from the polar express
