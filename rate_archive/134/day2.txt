High Concept Pop Day 2: Plastic Beach Getting Battered? It's Not So Impossible
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/re9fef/high_concept_pop_day_2_plastic_beach_getting/

Welcome back to another riveting day of High Concept Pop!

We officially have the [day one banners](https://imgur.com/a/x8n652t) out, as well as a correction. There were actually [76](https://pastebin.com/epqrZsE3) participants overall, and the two raters whose ballots were missed out on yesterday have been added to today’s reveal. Apart from averages, the only thing that would have changed with their ballots added to yesterdays results would have been that Make the Bus and Suite III would have swapped places.

So, are we ready for another day of High Concept Pop?

Yeah!

Our average with the two new ballots is 7.867, and our average controversy is 1.687, which means anything with a controversy score higher than that is controversial. Today, we will be eliminating the songs that placed #30 - #16, and the songs that placed #4 and #3 in the bonus rate. 

Here’s a list with each album, and the songs they have that are still in:

Plastic Beach

Welcome to the World of Plastic Beach (ft. Hypnotica Brass Ensemble and Snoop Dogg)

Rhinestone Eyes

Stylo (ft. Mos Def and Bobby Womack)

Superfast Jellyfish (ft. Gruff Rhys and De La Soul)

Empire Ants (ft. Little Dragon)

On Melancholy Hill

To Binge (ft. Little Dragon)

Age of Adz

Futile Devices

Too Much

Age of Adz

I Walked

Get Real Get Right
All for Myself

I Want to Be Well

Impossible Soul

The Archandroid

Suite II Overture

Dance or Die (ft. Saul Williams)

Faster

Locked Inside

Cold War

Tightrope (ft. Big Boi)

Oh, Maker

Come Alive (War of the Roses)

static_int_husp: Hey Everyone! static here, I'm hosting Day 11 of ratemas today, which you may have seen via the Discord or Daily Discussion threads. We're playing bingo during the rate. Some bingo tiles are for when songs get eliminated, some are for when common things happen in the chat. If you still want to participate, DM me and I'll send you a board. I'll close submissions a bit after the first song goes out.

First three people to get a bingo get a spot in ratemas. I'll keep this thread and the discord up to date as things progress

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “Planet of the apes” The original? The remake? The book? We need specificity Mr. Dogg!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): Whoever made the decision that Snoop Dogg was the right person to introduce the world of this album, they understood the assignment.

**throwaway7650** (9.5): snoop bringing down 10s to 9.5s 2 rates in a row :soobcry:

**fadedblue09** (9): Feels like being transported to a parallel universe

**IIIHenryIII** (9): such a warm welcome

**musical\_pyn** (9): really good intro for the whole project, just a perfect vibe

**ReallyCreative** (9): I think having what amounts to 2 intros is a little indulgent but I'm giving my 11 to a 25 minute song so I really can't talk

**runaway3212** (9): Snoop Dogg is such a great presence in every song

**seanderlust** (9): snoop dogg's second most impactful location-specific verse in all of 2010

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): I like this a lot, it's a great opener and it's super chill

**modulum83** (8.5): let's go to the beach beach

**Qwilphish** (8.5): A much better intro to the album. Snoop Dogg is such a vibe on this track, and I love the brass section. Definitely gives a look into the mechanical tropical vibes.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): a rare good snoop feature post-2000

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.1): Can't deny how cool Snoop sounds, what a surprise. It's a good opener to the world inside the plastic beach. It's an interesting touch how they make the world sound inviting on cuts like these, even though it belies the world made of used plastic that's so devestating. Though there are lyrics that make it clear we're talking about pollution here. But then Snoop's drinking lemoande in the shade! And shout out to an artist left on the 70s Soul Classics cutting room floor, Gil Scott-Heron.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Snoop is like one of the last people I would expect on a record like this but… you know, who the fuck cares, this track bangs. Can’t tell if that’s a horn or synth that blares in the foreground but you’re doing good sweetie!

**austrosinitic** (8): Not sure how Snoop Dogg ended up both in a Gorillaz song and an Epic Rap Battles of History episode in the early 2010s but good for him this is a cool intro I like the production better than the one in the second title track despite the latter having a better hook

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): Snoop Dogg being the first voice you hear on the record works really well

**ChidiArianaGrande** (8): Solar Power would have been better with a Snoop Dogg feature tell me I’m wrong?

**stryxen** (8): what a kind welcome thank you mr dogg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): snoop dogg is allowed to do whatever he wants

**waluigiest** (8): Snoop Dog rapping about pollution i’m quaking

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this feels more of a snoop dogg song than a Gorillaz song

**akanewasright** (7): Honestly, if snoop wasn’t the one welcoming me, I wouldn’t feel welcome here. Good thing he is!

**frogaranaman** (7): the feature tags weren't loading on my player for a second so I fully thought to myself "why does the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble sound so much like Snoop Dogg"

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): cute idea but leaves something to be desired musically

**jackisboredtoday** (7): this is cool, even though it feels like a second intro. does anyone else remember the song Gorillaz guested on from a snoop album around this time or is that just me???

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): i like this production a lot actually

**plastichaxan** (7): can you repeat that i don’t remember where you were welcoming me to

**skargardin** (7): Still thinking about the NFT drop they did

**UselessTacooo** (7): those horns are so satisfying for absolutely no reason.

**vayyiqra** (7): I like this beat but cannot take Snoop seriously on this (or really, ever).

**1998tweety** (6): this is just a 2nd intro isn't it

**apatel27** (6): The brass is amazing. Snoop not so much

**mudkip1** (6): oh hello snoop dogg

**welcome2thejam** (6): Opening up your album with Snoop Dogg revealing himself is a hell of a move

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): How do u think Snoop Dogg became besties with the guy from Blur?

**Blisterman** (5): Snoop Dogg phoning it in even more than usual.

**moonagenightmares** (5): sounds like another intro

**nt96** (5): The only reason the score's not any lower is cuz I like Snoop. Other than that, I would like to leave plastic beach, thx.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): I think this is the time to admit I have never liked Snoop Dogg. I managed to dodge that on California Gurls, but- yeah, he does nothing for me.

**wavingwolves** (4): "the revolution will be televised" says the millionaire... but the production is cool at some points which doesn't make this totally unredeemable

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The entire album deserves to make it to day 3 but interludephobia will strike again

**frogaranaman** (10): overture-phobia is real!!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): the way this is incredible and transitions into one of the best songs on the album yup

**runaway3212** (10): the world ended, everybody died

**throwaway7650** (10): very cool of janelle to interpolate 4:33 at the beginning

**xxipil0ts** (10): That shift to the glitch effects was amazing!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Beautiful and dramatic opener into Metropolis!

**apatel27** (9): sets the scene perfectly

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): it’s a smasha sorry

**ReallyCreative** (9): interludephobia is a federal crime

**stsangie** (9): outsold orchestral

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): LOVE these, I wish more artists would do orchestral overtures of their work. Steps did one for one of their greatest hits albums and it’s such a fun idea. This isn’t the best one though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I am a sucker for a grand orchestral intro

**seanderlust** (8.2): see my comment on the gorillaz opening track. i love this shit

**Blisterman** (8): Is it a little pretentious to start the album like a symphony? Yes. Does it work? Yes. Sets up the musical leitmotifs for the rest of the album.

**ChidiArianaGrande** (8): Hype!

**fadedblue09** (8): Disney movie opening soundtrack teas

**IIIHenryIII** (8): very cinematic

**musical\_pyn** (8): does a good job of setting the scene for the rest of the album, would be higher if it captured more moments from the album

**nt96** (8): Yes it's an interlude, yes I rated it higher than almost all of Gorillaz songs, no I'm not sorry. Argue with the wall.

**Qwilphish** (8): I really love orchestral, grand intros so its no surprise that this is a smash. It really puts you into a whimsical headspace and gets you to look around you too look out for anything dangerous. Almost sounds like a Harry Potter intro a bit... is it just me

**RandomHypnotca** (8): It may be mostly instrumental, but it's really pretty idc

**slimboyfriend** (8): It's always a gamble guessing when those strings are gonna drop at the beginning

**stryxen** (8): outsold orchestral intro

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i love the ps3 start up sound 😍

**vayyiqra** (8): What a good introduction! The retro vibe of the album goes well with the classic film score sound of this.

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): this is one of the best interludes I’ve ever heard, but seeing as it’s just 2min string arrangement with no vocals I can’t reasonably give it a higher score than this.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Not gonna lie, kind of was waiting for this to be over, even if I can appreciate that this do be kind of a well constructed classical piece, but I mean-

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): cinematic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It’s good but it’s just difficult for me to care that much about any instrumental intro/interlude.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the whiplash from impossible soul to this in the playlist is something

**DaHumanTorch** (7): oh now this was an INTRO

**modulum83** (6.5): bad flashbacks to high school orchestra class :(

**jackisboredtoday** (6): it sure is an overture

**thedoctordances1940** (6): i mean it's a nice opener innit but nothing special

**welcome2thejam** (6): So we're a musical musical, huh

**Awkward\_King** (5): it serves its purpos

**moonagenightmares** (5): no idea how to rate this

**Uberpigeon** (2): this is not a good album opener im sorry!

**2dina3dworld** (8): a fan favourite, but apparently not a popheads favourite. SAD!

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this sounds so much like fucking hallelujah

**IIIHenryIII** (10): if someone told me this was a Grease track, I’d believe them

**nt96** (10): One of the only songs on this list I actually liked.

**stryxen** (10): one of my favourite songs ever it just doesn’t get better than this

**stsangie** (10): binge what lol

**akanewasright** (9): she sounds so much like Kali Uchis here it’s insane

**apatel27** (9): A nice upbeat song about hating yourself and your addictions

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): vibes

**fadedblue09** (9): A surprisingly intimate number. Easily the highlight of the second half

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I find this one really soothing, probably the beachy strings

**mudkip1** (9): so far Little Dragon has singlehandedly saved this album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.7): This album is really a study of contrasts. You have the swaying Hawaiian sound, intermingled with these lyrics of a doomed relationship due to alcoholism. It's a well done duet of two polarized POVs of the same situation.Somehow, this is one the saddest songs I've heard this year. That's I think why bittersweet songs (upbeat sound with sad lyrics) can really take me out. A really well-done song.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it's going to get obliterated but it's a cute ballad

**throwaway7650** (8.5): the inferior little dragon collab but still good!

**FlavaSavaVandal** (8): My power went out when I was listening to this song, and it didn’t come on until two days later. So I was gonna give it a 0 but I like the song too much to be that petty

**frogaranaman** (8): god Little Dragon's voice is just magic

**runaway3212** (8): binging is good actually

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): my favorite gravity falls song

**1998tweety** (7.5): little dragon is carrying this album

**modulum83** (7.2): big vibes

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): me when i add a show to my watchlist knowing full well i’ll never think about it again

**austrosinitic** (7): I feel really bad because I just cannot get into the last three songs on this album, this is probably the best one but I don't know something isn't hitting here I am sorry Gorillaz fans

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): yeah it exists

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): There’s so many good synth lines on this album. This one does drag a bit tho IMO.

**Blisterman** (7): Nice chilled song, if a bit forgettable.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): very clearly the weaker little dragon collab on this album but it's still good ig

**UselessTacooo** (7): it’s cute in a good way.

**vayyiqra** (7): Well then. This is lowkey a song that is built around a metaphor about how drugs and love are a lot like each other, and that's a trope I always complain is overused, but as far as songs about addiction go, this is one of the better treatments of that topic (low bar though). Also, again I have to appreciate Yukimi's voice being on this as the one (1) Little Dragon stan here, although this song does not sound anything like their music whatsoever.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): is this bedroom pop

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Little Dragon to me is like an indie pop feature queen

**wavingwolves** (6.1): nice

**AHSWeeknd** (6): ‘Caught again’ sounds like a British person saying ‘cardigan’

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): the other little dragon collab remains superior

**Qwilphish** (6): It's not a bad song, but its a bit too lowkey for my taste

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Why even have this throwaway song when Empire Ants was a great enough collaboration?

**seanderlust** (4): okay wait is anyone else hearing the sound of yuki's mouth move in like an asmr way? i hate it

**2dina3dworld** (7): Girl, Anthony is an accountant. Dump him, accountants suck.

---

**apatel27** (10): Middle Ages lyrics over a synth beat sung by an android from the future is peak music

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Honestly, I may be in love with Sir Greendown by now.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): at one point in time this was my fave song on the whole album and i still think it’s gorgeous

**runaway3212** (10): will this survive interludephobia and balladphobia? no. It will not.

**throwaway7650** (10): anthony is a pan king for loving cindy/an android tbh. king

**vayyiqra** (10): I love the organ on this song - its retro sound fits oddly well for such a futuristic album. It's also a lot of fun reading the lyrics and following along to the story of this album, because it has the most coherent story out of the three albums here - Plastic Beach does have a story but it's kind of overly ambitious and hard to follow, and Age of Adz is more about feelings than a plotline.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I wish this was longer. It sounds so amazing!

**RandomHypnotca** (9.4): I'm a sucker for flowery imagery and sweet romantic ballads

**akanewasright** (9): This is lovely

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): damn, what a cute, romantic song

**ReallyCreative** (9): we love a cute little ballad

**stryxen** (8.1): i barely know him

**AHSWeeknd** (8): if it weren’t for Janelle’s iconic delivery this would’ve been a six

**BeauMeringue212** (8): nice lil interlude

**Blisterman** (8): Like a renaissance fair on an alien planet.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): no janelle little dragon is on gorillaz’ album

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I’m very curious where this one will end up, even though I like it I’m predicting it as an early out. It’s one of the more curious sounding songs on the album due to the mysterious ’60s pop vibe and dreamy lyrics, but I can’t imagine the album without it.

**skargardin** (8): the calm before the cold war

**Uberpigeon** (8): this one is very pretty i like it

**waluigiest** (8): do the 70s soul classics rate

**welcome2thejam** (8): Really liking the fairytale imagery contrasting with all the futuristic theming so far. The image of dolphins walking like men got me fucked up though

**seanderlust** (7.8): the subtle nod to moon river that later gets more directly referenced is genius

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): it's nice but just too short

**moonagenightmares** (7.6): i’m not sure what the beginning reminded me of but i loved it

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I also don't remember this song being this weak, at least it's an enjoyable song at least. Kind of... cool and mysterious, in its own way.

**austrosinitic** (7): Not bad but Oh, Maker did the whole oldies aesthetic better I fear also can some stan tell me why she named the love interest in this story Greendown it sounds too British

**ignitethephoenix** (7): pretty but I wanted more

**UselessTacooo** (7): it’s pleasant, but it is not one of the highlights.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): incomprehensible outside of the concept & basically an interlude, but its fine within context

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Very relaxing but…well not very exciting.

**Qwilphish** (6): A love letter to Mayweather's lover, it is saccharine and very cute. Unfortunately it doesnt translate into a bop and serves more so as lore

**frogaranaman** (5): Sir Christopher John Greenwood (born 12 May 1955) is Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge and a former British judge at the International Court of Justice. Prior to his election, he was professor of international law at the London School of Economics and a barrister who regularly appeared as counsel before the International Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights, the English courts, and other tribunals.

**modulum83** (5): this is like something damon albarn would reject from gorillaz for being too quirky

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): is this a folk song

**mudkip1** (3): meh

**apatel27** (10): God I wish this wasn't as relatable as it is

**Leixander** (10): bonk, go to horny jail

**moonagenightmares** (10): gay

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this song is very obviously Gay and i find it amusing that someone on the genius page tried saying this was about murder rather than two men being in a relationship sob emoji but anyway i personally find this very underrated! and imo it also conveys the feeling of young love/being in your first (gay) relationship and desperate for approval very well

**ReallyCreative** (10): I also want all the hairy chests for myself, so true Sufstie

**sirpancakeXI** (10): when he sing " i want it all i want it all for myself" i literally ascended to another dimension, it is just so good.

**throwaway7650** (10): I thought it couldn't get gayer than futile devices... but...

**UselessTacooo** (10): I think the soundscape is perfect for a song like this, and I love the lyrical content

**waluigiest** (10): Everything in this song (lyrics, orchestration, vocals, harmonies) come together to create a powerful, beautiful song of longing. This song is love

**wavingwolves** (10): beautiful

**RandomHypnotca** (9.5): Hairy chests huh? 👀

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): Sufjan has been A1 since day one

**BeauMeringue212** (9): this song is so horny omg. Sufjan coming off like the type of guy on Scruff to woof you and compliment your "fur"

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Probably my favorite of the four shorter tracks on this album.

**vayyiqra** (9): The mournful backing vocals on this song are so beautiful. It can compete with "Vesuvius" for being the saddest-sounding song on this album, which is saying a lot. That's the main reason I like it. Lyrically Sufjan talks here about feeling possessive and selfish, which is a recurring theme on this album. The Genius comments on this song are a dumpster fire since it seems to me like one of the least ambiguous songs on the album, but someone got the idea that it's about murder (???) instead and there are heated arguments over it. That's uh, a reach. Anyway I don't care to look for any esoteric meaning in this one. I have no heterosexual explanation for the lines about "hairy chests" (note the plural) and "you, a bathing boy" so this seems like the simplest way to interpret this song - Sufjan is singing about being in love with some guy and blaming himself because he can't have that.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Nice breather in between the five minute song, the six minute song, and Impossible Soul

**seanderlust** (8.8): sob

**austrosinitic** (8.5): Ahahaha! It's gay! It's gay! Every single indication on this album that my interpretation of its narrative makes sense just makes my desperation and my insanity even stronger! Let's look at the lyrics to this one — 'bathing boy, amazing you'? Tsk tsk, Sufjan. That's a little too close to the whole David/Bathsheba story, don't you think? Are you referencing Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen? I mean, I love Cohen too, but every other indie singer-songwriter has done that at least once. How could you? But, nah, I think it's more likely that following Vesuvius, the actual setting of this song is, in a metaphorical sense, reminiscent of Roman, or at the very least, classical times — what with the bathing boy and the smell coming from the Earth, which is a reference to the hot springs of Rome, IMO, and the Icarus reference at the beginning (can't think of another reason why Sufjan would suddenly talk about being able to fly), emphasizing the homoeroticism of the relationship he's talking about, although not as much as the really fucking explicit hairy chests line does (or as much as the references to 'worries' and 'keeping you close to my ear') This song represents the moment where he finally gives into the passion that Vesuvius has released, that now lurks in the waters of his love for his male 'friend'. This is where Sufjan finally becomes able to consummate the love he had for his 'friend' — now unambiguously his lover — something he was unable to do with his former female lover. It's a very erotic, very liberating moment of self-realization.

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): gay rights

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): good noise

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): oh hi kendrick

**slimboyfriend** (8): gay yearning :/

**stryxen** (8): quit moaning in my ear -2 points for that

**stsangie** (8): is what you should've said after making this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): Another tepid lower point on the album for me. I guess I can almost accept is as an interlude (so I'm expressing interludephobia). The melody is very pretty, especially the harmonies. Sonically I'm somewhat bored.

**modulum83** (7.8): i need an adult

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Mixing could’ve been better but I guess it matches the sound aesthetic

**akanewasright** (7): gay rights

**Qwilphish** (7): One of the shorter tracks so it feels like not much is said. I enjoyed the vibe

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): There's a good song hidden in here but it's so fucking chaotic in the sound layering and I am just having major deja vu at this point with the rest of the record

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): this has some nice melodic ideas but the presentation is muddled and wow he sounds whiny

**jackisboredtoday** (6): subtracted a point for hairy chests but added it back for the line about a bathing boy

**runaway3212** (6): this album kinda drags around this song

**Uberpigeon** (6): bjork in pagan poetry be like

**Awkward\_King** (5): this sounds like an american horror story theme (derogatory)

**Blisterman** (5): Another icey cold song.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): if Call Me By Your Name was set in the future, this would play instead of Mystery of Love

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like a cult chant

**fadedblue09** (2.5): On paper, I'm supposed to like this song but I found this really disturbing. and why does he keep on tacking these unnecessarily chaotic outros

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a vibe tbh

**Blisterman** (10): Love the loose funky drums, the vocal performance and the guitar solo.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Another note-perfect soul slow burner. The strings, the grooving bassline, Janelle's vocals weaving between these two. And the yearning lyrics where she's reveling in this flashback with Anthony Greendown. It's really like, a 70s soul nod, and the spoken word part is a serve for me, it's giving ice-cold early 90s jazz rap.

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is what a blissful memory sounds like

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): So soothing and beautiful, the spoken word bit adds a bit of quirkiness and ties to back to the album storyline. And that guitar at the end? I’m ascending.

**TiltControls** (10): the superior neon track on the album

**vayyiqra** (10): By far the better song here with "Neon" in the title. I love the rap part so much and the strings.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): just lovely

**nt96** (9.4): Sounds very similar to Ex-Factor by Lauryn Hill. Perhaps a mashup could work with this?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This song sounds neon. Not sure how that works but it does.

**runaway3212** (9): I love neon I wish I wasn't gay

**stryxen** (9): this is so atmospheric and cinematic the album needs this song

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is nice

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): I've always thought the 2nd half of this record was the weakest part but this song kind of proving me wrong no lie

**akanewasright** (8.5): I just think that Janelle

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): guess what, janelle? My ears DO love this sweet melody

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Not my favorite song on the album but listening to it for this rate it kinda hits? I love how wistful she sounds and the rap verse is cute

**Qwilphish** (8.5): Her voice sounds great. Im dancing on the street waiting for a friend while listening to this

**modulum83** (8): it's an okay song but i'm giving it extra points cause it's pure and wholesome

**mudkip1** (8): vibe

**skargardin** (8): Everytime I listen to The ArchAndroid it just hits me how diverse the album is in genres, truly no song sounds the same

**throwaway7650** (8): ok but the rapped section does read like madonna lyrics

**UselessTacooo** (8): it’s a little still, but the vocals are to die for.

**ChidiArianaGrande** (7): Its neat but it goes on too long

**IIIHenryIII** (7): what a spectacular outro

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): great guitar

**welcome2thejam** (7): I love how normal this song feels for so much of its runtime, offset with brief snippets of the android story and ending with some dude saying "confusion is a walrus"

**wavingwolves** (6.9): the voice effect moment kind of takes away some of my enjoyment because it doesn't fit super seamlessly with the rest of the song but it's still a good one

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): I wanted to like this more because the title is super cool but idk it just didn’t stick with me that much

**fadedblue09** (6.5): her register on this song is honestly soothing, but overall it just feels uninteresting

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): cool guitar solo but also kinda a boring song

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i dont think this is for me but it is nice

**J\_Toe** (5): a lot of neon in this album

**Uberpigeon** (5): wow! a song thats actually about what this album is supposed to be about! its boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): what tf is up with the rap section

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): *insert stale topic joke*

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): numbers as titles of songs should happen more often

**Blisterman** (10): I never thought I'd enjoy Pastoral Folk this much.

**ChidiArianaGrande** (10): Acending

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Beautiful folk number! I'm living my best "black girl decolonizing cottagecore" life rn!!! Anywho, beautiful, angelic number from Anthony Greenwodwn's perspective. Sad that Cindi is in jail now within the story, a stark contrast of the utopia of Wonderland.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Something has always drawn me to this track, it’s just haunting. One thing that makes *The Archandroid* so special is how it calls on this ’30s/’40s pop sound, it untethers the songs from modernity and into timelessness, which is appropriate for an album where time travel is a conceptual device.

**Leixander** (10): has an undeniably perfect chorus

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): more like 101(0)1 am i right ladies

**mudkip1** (10): love this one

**RandomHypnotca** (10): this will definitely be robbed, but it's so delicate and beautiful, and a nice change of pace here before the finale

**seanderlust** (10): love the storytelling in this one and the little outro is gorgeous as well

**UselessTacooo** (10): this is a guitar ballad done perfectly. I see no issue, and the song evokes so much emotion.

**vayyiqra** (10): Again I have to notice how on this scifi album there's a strong retro theme. This song sounds older than that even and sounds almost like a carol or some kind of medieval song. (I would try to find better words for it but I'm really tired and don't have time.) It's so hauntingly beautiful. This is one of the darkest songs on the album, since in this song Cindi has been captured and is being held prisoner in an asylum and given a registration number, which brings to mind for me the numbers tattooed on the prisoners in concentration camps in the Holocaust. My grandfather was one of them, so it has a whole other resonance to me.

**nt96** (9.6): Nothing like ethereally throwing ass to this while gracefully gliding across a winter night sky.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): medieval bop

**throwaway7650** (9.5): betty who? [insert joke about her popheads AMA]

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): Sufjan would kill on this song

**musical\_pyn** (9): so haunting, I love it

**sirpancakeXI** (9): i really enjoy the slightly haunting vibe

**austrosinitic** (8.5): *guy who has never listened to a choir before* Wow this reminds me of the Harry Potter film score

**CrimsonROSET** (8): her sufjan era

**runaway3212** (8): 5+7=13 and 8+2+1=13 also, I can't believe taylor was hiding in plain sight this entire time

**slimboyfriend** (8): Omg it's the musical motif from Suite II Overture! At the album's emotional climax! She's an author!!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): this was such an awesome sound at the start, and I still like it but I kinda wish it built up a bit more or went somewhere sonically. Instead it just starts in an interesting place but gets a little too comfortable there

**Qwilphish** (7.5): Janelle is in her Sufjwiftie era

**stryxen** (7.5): sounds like an evil christmas song

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I don't mind how ethereal this song sounds, it's a cool production and the vocals are nice, but I don't really know if this does it for me as a song on its own, you know?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I think this is really pretty it just doesn’t stick with me much.

**fadedblue09** (7): I understand what it contributes to the album but this screams "obligatory solemn moment"

**modulum83** (7): sufjan? sufjan?

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): kinda a snooze

**akanewasright** (6): I like this song conceptually but not as much sonically

**frogaranaman** (6): is that a zip code

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its pretty sounding i guess

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The arrangement is GENIUS.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is such a close 11 contender for me, it is 6 minutes but feels like about 3 and janelle's tone is so soothing it is just delightful

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Man this song made me cry. It’s just so relaxing and serene and I’ve just been so stressed out lately.

**Blisterman** (10): This song hits me emotionally in a way I don't quite understand.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A beautiful love song between Anthony and Cindi, to this futuristic bossa nova jam. There are a few multicultural and multi-religious references, likening Cindi and Anthony's romance to be holy and transcendant. It's interesting that the final line, in an album steeped in fantasy and often escapsim (Wonderland) - "Love is not a fantasy/It's more for you, you and me". That's an interesting line in such a fantastical album. It grounds Cindi and Anthony's love, as they've been yearning for one another through other prior songs.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): If a song can have good cinematography, this one does. It’s just magical, it really makes me feel like I’m trekking through the space time continuum with just her voice to guide me.

**Leixander** (10): wish this was half a minute or so shorter for the maximum replayability, still perfect though

**musical\_pyn** (10): like an 8 or 9 but that outro is incredible

**stryxen** (10): the weather’s getting cold and the nights are getting long lemme leave this on repeat its the perfect vibe

**throwaway7650** (10): one of the last assignments in my modern japanese culture class was to compose a haiku in japanese but my flop ass just used english

**wavingwolves** (10): the best song in this album actually if you disagree i guess you're just wrong

**nt96** (9.8): That Clair de Lune part YESSSSS

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): the R+B elements bubbling just under the surface of this song really elevate it

**runaway3212** (9): I'll go

**TiltControls** (9): I kind of wish this was the closer actually but oh well

**waluigiest** (9): sobbing…. Idk why

**austrosinitic** (8.5): Do I think ending this album with two ballads may have been slightly overkill? Yes but also this is a pretty damn good thesis statement for the entire album (I say not knowing anything about the arc I'm sorry I'm doing this rate during finals season) and it does a great job as a penultimate track

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I think she could have cut this one down a bit, but it’s definitely an album highlight.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): I really like how mystical this song is, one of those rare, low-key moments of the album that goes over well from how the instrumentation carries it.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): hey it's debussy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i feel like this was supposed to be the ending of the album but then she was like ‘fuck it one more for the hoes in the back’

**fadedblue09** (8): I love Clair de Lune

**vayyiqra** (8): I really like this song, but feel kind of like this album could be better at explaining in the lyrics what is happening in the story. Still a very nice song though.

**seanderlust** (7.6): the piano outro with her singing "the world could end outside our window" bumped this up a solid point or so

**akanewasright** (7.5): This one’s kinda nice actually

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): it's pretty and all but ehhhhhh and a cheap clair de lune interpolation at the end won't save it

**1998tweety** (7): she DRAGGED those last 2 minutes out like there was a time requirement, me but with word counts on essays

**ChidiArianaGrande** (7): I love elements of this but it just drags a bit

**frogaranaman** (7): it's just such a nice listen

**Qwilphish** (7): Another chill track, very ethereal

**modulum83** (6): idk why this isn't doing more for me

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): good but a lot of filler which could be shaved off

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i really like the last minute of this

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I won't

**J\_Toe** (4): Janelle's albums tend to end with slower, sombre songs. Dirty Computer was the same. I just personally like fun danceable songs more.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Absolutely killer beat and loving the Bobby Womack sections

**ReallyCreative** (9.8): :daisybop:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): Not quite as great as the more famous Gorillaz collab with Mos Def but still a fantastic groove. This one grew on the me the most on repeated listens for this album.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): fabulous

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Was Mos Def even on this? Either way, a funky ass track with phenomenal instrumentation and great vocal performance overall, just that I wasn’t sure if Womack’s vocals really fit here, kinda feels like the passion is mismatched. Still a good ass song though, but I’m ready for popheads to pay it DUST.

**akanewasright** (9): Bobby Womack eats

**austrosinitic** (9): Sometimes it feels like everybody blabs on about how x song or album released in the 2010s 'revived' disco and I am constantly confused as to who we should actually credit for bringing it back. Like this is from all the way back in 2010 but I'm pretty sure it counts? Eat your heart out Get Lucky ig either way it's a wonderful song

**vayyiqra** (9): Have to say, this track is a jam. This is the one track from this album that I could see growing on me most. I bet Popheads will hate Bobby Womack's part but controversial hot take, he is Good In Fact on this.

**modulum83** (8.7): what the fuck is a stylo damon

**CrimsonROSET** (8): he sure was fast and furious

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Bobby’s voice is the only overload thing in here

**Qwilphish** (8): Ive heard this chorus for years, had no idea it was from this song

**stryxen** (8): this song is just so chaotic half of these points are just for the drama of it all

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Lavender Lamborghini, roll up in a blue bikini Bitches on the beaches, lookin' super cute and freaky All my friends are princesses, we keep it whipped and creamy Ice cubes on our tongues, because we like to keep it freezy Lavender Lamborghini, get out on the right side Chauffeur stayed at home, because my girl wanted to ride Lookin' luxe and tastin' plush, I'm feelin' so alive Want to take it to the highway, come on, let's go for a drive, uh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): I'm very torn with this one. Bobby Womack and Yasiin sound great here, especially Bobby! What lowers the song for me is how wispy and dull Damon sounds. Especially on the chorus, which I lowkey hate. but Bobby is so great singing about electric love flowing into the streets. It doubles as a good funk number that's also talking about the overmechanization leading to the planet's demise. Proto-doomer bops Damon, thank you!

**1998tweety** (7): bop

**frogaranaman** (7): this sounds like rym-bait

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I appreciate the more old school soul bones of this one but it feels like something from the background of a video game in a bad way

**runaway3212** (7): fuck you becky for never giving back my stylo

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): the production is nice, but I’m a little thrown off with the vocals. They aren’t bad, but they are just weird.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): thank god they stopped before the chorus got too annoying

**wavingwolves** (5): it's... okay? i guess?

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): this sounds like it was rejected from a little shop of horrors remake soundtrack

**mudkip1** (1): this was boring, damn

**2dina3dworld** (10): My name isn’t Alice, but I’m living in Wonderland

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorite songs on the album and one of my favorite Janelle songs in general! I don’t even know what’s supposed to be happening here from a story perspective? I think Cyndi is tripping on drugs? She really said “take her back to wonderland/she thinks she left her underpants” and it was catchy rather than stupid… or I guess it was stupid, but that’s the fun of it.

**Leixander** (10): the last minute and the outro is probably one of my favorite music moments

**mudkip1** (10): love this one

**Qwilphish** (10): We're not getting off of this psychedelic wonderland bus in this second suite and I wouldn't get off even if I had a choice

**ReallyCreative** (10): her name isn't Alice!!

**runaway3212** (10): Stale topic could never

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this is giving me early 10s toy store jingle vibe

**UselessTacooo** (10): it sounds ripped straight from the splatoon soundtrack.

**vayyiqra** (10): I'm really fading here since it's 5 in the morning and I'm struggling to finish this ballot but anyway this is a jam and I love the chorus. I think this song is about sex, drugs, or both. Genius seems to agree. Cool.

**wavingwolves** (10): oh i think there's a word to describe a song like this... won.. wond.... how does it go? i can't seem to remember

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): TAKE ME BACK TO WONDALAND! I GOTTA GET BACK TO WONDALAND!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Take me with you, Janelle!

**Blisterman** (9): Looked up the lyrics, and she does actually say "She thinks she left her underpants". I was certain I had been mishearing that.

**J\_Toe** (9): back to back songs mentioning children's books

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.8): This song has a great beat and melody. I dock points that the vocal pitching is a little bit annoying. But a nice little retreat into this mystical wonderland idea, where people can be loved.

**moonagenightmares** (8.8): this is kinda giving sufjan christmas album at some parts

**austrosinitic** (8.5): Look I'm a Swiftgron truther too but Swifties please shut up about this song title because it is a electro-funk classic and I appreciate it for being one of the easiest tracks to get to on the second half of this very long album <3

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): you're telling me a queer coded this?

**nt96** (8.5): I'm imagining an Afrofuturistic version of Whoville. Also did I just hear Toad in the background?

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): my name isnt alice

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The lyrics ain’t all that, ngl.

**stryxen** (8): this is what my singing voice sounds like

**DaHumanTorch** (7.8): Alice (Metropolis Version)

**modulum83** (7.8): it's a good song but i'm docking points cause it sounds like a disney princess is singing the chorus

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Really irritating at some parts but I do love the dreamy whimsical production

**throwaway7650** (7.5): at least I'm giving this a better score than ateez's :grinny:

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): i like it but i kinda wish i liked it more because i love naming a song for your label/collective like this

**akanewasright** (7): I love how Janelle can kinda use any part of her voice in any style and it’s always wonderful. I don’t think there’s much else to the song but she sounds cool on it

**CrimsonROSET** (7): big KKB energy

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Taylor outsold

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): this song is just there

**frogaranaman** (6): the outro made me want to listen to Christmas music. discussing with my therapist later

**welcome2thejam** (6): You know what, I like the underpants line, it wore me down

**waluigiest** (5): I understand what she was going for here but I think it’s corny

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): this sounds like it was written for a commercial for a magic fairy knock off barbie doll

**2dina3dworld** (10): How did this song inspire the majority of the Sufjan horny-posting

---

**pheromenos** (11): sufjan walked

**apatel27** (10): It's not your fault Sufjan

**frogaranaman** (10): I love how Sufjan built on this sound later for The Ascension. probably why I like both of these albums so much

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): imo one of the best songs on this album (in an album full of 10s, but still) - the outro itself is a career highlight, with sufjan gradually becoming more anguished and the song itself becoming more chaotic

**stsangie** (10): when you walk

**vayyiqra** (10): Here Sufjan is, in classic Sufjan style, writing the most beautiful lyrics in a style that I would best describe as akin to vaguebooking. (Yes, really.) He seems to be singing about lost love of some kind, but beyond that it's less clear. Some of the Genius annotations think this might be about suicide, which would make sense given the lyrics ("knife in my chest", "a mess on the floor") but I wouldn't think that's literal. (At least, I really hope it's not.) And then someone else thinks this song might be one of the tracks that's about Royal Robertson, though I'm not into that interpretation myself and see no reason to think so. (Though Royal's wife did leave him because of his severe mental illness, with all their 12 kids, leaving him alone. Poor guy. She could not help him though.)

**waluigiest** (10): when he switches into falsetto the emotion is so sharp… just wow

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): This is one of the mellower tracks off Age of Adz that I really enjoyed. It's the minimal wave beginning that places it in the 80s for me with the soft synths in the background that take off in the chorus. I like the more straightforward lyrics of being mistreated by a lover. Throughout the large themes of life, death, art and illness, Sufjan's recurring motif here seems to be unfulfilled love on either end; either spurned or too selfish and wrapped in neuroticism to be there for a partner. It's vulnerable either way, and I see the emotional intimacy and supressed frustrations that makes Sufjan so popular.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): so the album could run (for context, that was the lead single)

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): pov: you ask a HAIM sister how they got somewhere

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Can't explain why this song is one of the best on the record other than hey it's catchy and has a nice whimsicality to it balanced with the glitchy electronic production.

**austrosinitic** (9): A bop, one of my favorites on the album, but yet another example of how we can't tell whether Sufjan is singing to a man or a woman in most instances where he apologizes to the mysterious lover(s) that he has failed. Curiously, I Walked's dramatic scenario involves a breaking up, and many lyrics here, such as "I am inclined to explain to you what I could not before", and "I couldn't bear that it's me, it's my fault", imply a sense of guilt on Sufjan's part — but what is this guilt about? I actually think he's singing to the third, female persona in this album's narrative here, instead of the male best friend that I interpret the first three songs as being dedicated towards. The second stanza implies the prior absence of this lover, as well as a sexual betreyal driven by the impulse of desire ("For when you went away/I went crazy/I was wild with the breast of a dog/I ran through the night/With the knife in my chest/with the lust of your loveless life"). Qué interesante; "loveless life". Could Sufjan's female partner have caught him in the act of adultery with another man? And could Sufjan realize by now that what he's felt for her hasn't been real love, amidst the emotional devastation of her leaving him? The final thing to note here is the choice of "I walked" as a metaphor. It used to fancy associating it with Jesus' walk to Golgotha to be crucified, thus making Sufjan, as a queer person and a gay man, the crucified subject (see works of liberation theology such as James Cone's God of the Oppressed for how this mirrors how POC have related to the symbolism of the cross). But now I'm not quite sure how to relate it to my belief that this song is directed to a woman. At the very least, we see mentions here of walking and running "I would not have run off", which is particularly interesting if you think about the mentions of running and chasing after ghosts in succeeding songs and their lyrics. I'm still trying to find out if Sufjan is clearly establishing a parallel or a contrast in between both and whether either is respectively connected to the male and female persona (I'd say that running is for the man, because, duh, he literally states he ran off into the night). I could write so much about this but you all are probably tired of me by now.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I think out of all the songs on this album, this most resembles a traditional pop song. Relatively speaking, of course.

**stryxen** (9): me in PE

**akanewasright** (8.5): why do I love the lyric “For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye”, like that feels like an asshole thing to say and yet????

**modulum83** (8.5): and i walked, i walked so far awayyy

**Qwilphish** (8.5): Sufjan walked so Sufjwifties could run. Very chill, but I really enjoyed listening to it

**TiltControls** (8.5): sufjan walked so a flock of seagulls could run

**wavingwolves** (8.1): more like i strutted cause this ate

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Truly giving future vibes

**CrimsonROSET** (8): where are you going sufjan

**nt96** (8): Sufjan you can walk into my DMs anytime.

**UselessTacooo** (8): One of the songs that grabbed me much more on re-listen. The vocal performance is probably the highlight for the track.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): He sounds sad but I can help him

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): me when my friend gave me a ride to a school event and assumed my parents were gonna pick me up but they weren’t but I was too polite to ask for a ride home

**throwaway7650** (7.5): the choir/opera (?) in the background is the highlight of this

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): this is good but it makes in comparison to the rest of the album

**mudkip1** (7): it’s cute

**runaway3212** (7): bitch me too you're not special

**seanderlust** (7): "i walked cause you walked" - me blaming other people crossing the street when they cross too early and i was looking at my phone

**slimboyfriend** (7): Well I'm glad he's getting his cardio in

**Uberpigeon** (7): this is about HAIM

**welcome2thejam** (7): Dropping this baby on the workout playlist

**Blisterman** (6): Like the sweeping synths.

**J\_Toe** (5): constantly sounds a little off. wonder if someone could explain this due to time signatures or something

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i walked? walked where??

**runaway3212** (11): I love literally everything about this

**akanewasright** (10): The best song ever made

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is the perfect blend of whimsical and heterosexual

**CrimsonROSET** (10): please do not eat jellyfish

**frogaranaman** (10): this is weird in a way that just WORKS

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Genius.com says that this song is a metaphor for the entertainment industry but personally I interpreted it as being more about the aesthetics of advertisements and the overlap they have with the art world, something that the Gorillaz as a project seem to be at the very least tenuously interested in. It makes me think of how artists will “sell out” and use their talents to try and sell us junk just like in this song a chipmunk voiced chorus line of jellyfish tries to sell us on the death of the ocean. Shiny commercialism above the surface, but beneath the waves there’s a flurry of activity as the kings and bottom feeders work overtime to recycle the same trash to us even as it just creates more pollution. The sounds are undeniably fun to listen to but ultimately, as the title of the album implies, plastic. But Is a “commercial” song somehow less worthy than a “pure” song, regardless of its musical merits? Using art to sell a product is so strange because neither element emerges unchanged; the product is elevated into art, and the art itself becomes a product, and thus it becomes difficult to untangle what’s really of value.

**mudkip1** (10): it’s giving season

**musical\_pyn** (10): I'm a sucker for sampling and this pulls it off so well

**Qwilphish** (10): Name a better duo than Gorillaz and De La Soul. This song is PEAK camp

**RandomHypnotca** (10): it's camp af

**ReallyCreative** (10): invented Splatoon!!!

**seanderlust** (10): this kind of gives "don't hug me i'm scared" vibes

**stryxen** (10): this song came on when i was running late and having breakfast once so i get this on a deeper level

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): unironically this > feel good inc

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): i've just always absolutely loved this song, the chorus is just sooo fucking catchy

**modulum83** (9.7): the first time i heard this song i think it legitimately shifted my views on music a little

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): How kind of them to make a song for that one person who somehow has the same fast food order as them!

**welcome2thejam** (9): How the hell you gonna turn breakfast commercial jingle aesthetic into a bop like this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): This song is so bouncy and fun! At least that's how it sounds. Beneath it are lyrics about consumerism and the vapidness of modern life. The combination of DLS and Super Furry Animal's Gruff is so divine. It makes a lot of sense for Gorillaz to team up with Gruff, as SFA was always an eclectic and daring Welsh band. And always good to hear DLS back on a Gorillaz track. Even if the whole track is them dragging the music industry, which is iconic, the song manages to be catchy and exuberant.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I find this enjoyable surprisingly

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): i like how this bounces from old school rap to what feels like a song I’d hear in a PBS show growing up

**apatel27** (8): Impressive attack on consumerism.

**austrosinitic** (8): That's the last time I'll take a bath with my Tentacool ever again!

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I’m proud of saying I don’t consume seafood

**slimboyfriend** (8): This is by far the best song on the album just for the fact that it’s so weird

**TiltControls** (8): how fast are we talking? like is someone launching them from a cannon

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it gives cute technology beach party vibes

**throwaway7650** (7.5): it'z ~~almost~~ camp

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Of course the sea is radioactive, Godzilla lives there.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): One of the sweetest hooks on the album, appropriately. But not a good choice to just repeat the first verse again for the second - you ain’t Mr. Brightside.

**Blisterman** (7): It's no Feel Good Inc.

**J\_Toe** (6): i like the hook in the chorus a lot, but the rest isn't what I like listening to

**waluigiest** (6): nice. I respect it and think it’s interesting, but I never want to listen to it again.

**1998tweety** (5.5): umm

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): this just reminds me that i could be listening to de la soul instead

**vayyiqra** (3): Oh no. I'm not malevoicephobic but Gruff's feature on this is Not Good. There is a good point to be made by its lyrics about instant gratification and waste, but it sure is a goofy-sounding way of making it. :zany_face:

**\_\_Avaritia** (2.5): Lowkey might just rather eat a jellyfish for breakfast instead of listening to this mess of a song again. At least it’s short and followed by one of the best songs of the record.

**wavingwolves** (1): this is on the top 5 most annoying songs i've ever heard in my life and i've worked at a daycare and had to listen to those youtube songs for children

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): funny story, I spent three years with a blocked ear. When I finally got it cleared, I needed two microsuctioning sessions to clear it entirely. What does this have to do with this song? Well, when I heard the noises at the start it reminded me so much of the microsuctioning that I immediately braced myself for the pain of microsuctioning. Which is perhaps my biggest issue with this song, other than that it’s kinda boring.

---

**akanewasright** (10): this song samples Too Much I’m not joking.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): what an introduction to the sound of the album, this is probably one of the most chaotic songs on the album

**plastichaxan** (10): (11): i just love beep boop music so much maybe user BeepBoopMusicFan was on to something

**ReallyCreative** (10): Carly should have covered this on Dedicated just like Sufjan should have covered Run Away With Me on The Ascension

**stryxen** (10): the intro is my stomach after drinking dairy milk

**stsangie** (10): !ifart

**apatel27** (9.5): Beep Boop

**throwaway7650** (9.5): really like the last section, everything before that? HIFN reject

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.2): I like this song! A good, glitchy beat. I like the repetition in the chorus and Sufjan's yearning in the voices. I love the opening and how Sufjan merges the folk melody with how off-kilter the sound and beat are. I read an interview where Sufjan was taking to heart trying to make his music "less accessible", which I respect and see where he's going.

**austrosinitic** (9): "Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden/Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not/Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither/Living nor dead, and I knew nothing". That's a quotation from T.S Eliot of Cats fame's Magnum opus of a poem, The Waste Land (although Eliot was a fascist so fuck him) and it's a great summary of what I think Too Much is about. Throughout Age of Adz, Sufjan alludes to his inability to love properly, which is interesting if you see his words as ambiguously directed to two possible other characters here, who are, judging by Impossible Soul, perhaps a man and a woman (of course other folks think there are just two personas in this album, a dude and a lady, and that Impossible Soul just shifts perspectives between both, and I get that interpretation but I'm also trying to have fun). So who is Sufjan singing to here: a man or a woman? Is he apologizing for not being able to act on his feelings to a man because of his internalized homophobia and the fear that arises from ita and prevents him from admitting to himself that he's gay (hence there being too much to ride on)? Or is he apologizing for not being able to love a woman properly — through both physical affection like sex and the emotional investment of love — for the exact same reasons? You can't tell, even if you do see three separate people within the album's narrative, and I find that very interesting. What's also interesting is the lyrics 'Even if I could have kissed/even if I could be the blind'. That's very reminiscent of the Eliot stanza that I quoted — it links Sufjan's inability to reciprocate love to his sight, which you can link to the question of just who he is physically attracted to and whether that depends on gender. BTW, there are also gay readings of The Waste Land. That Eliot was very mad about. Your welcome.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The image of Sufheads in 2010 listening to this album upon release and hearing the transition from Futile Devices to this is HILARIOUS.

**fadedblue09** (9): If he really wanted to make a noisy glitchpop type of album, then he should have used this as the template cuz this one actually sounds like a song and not just some random noises thrown together

**frogaranaman** (9): who is Too Much and why are they riding That

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this definitely is too much. It's perfectly crafted but Carly Rae outsold

**Leixander** (9): when i party then i party too much~

**modulum83** (9): this is a surprisingly wholesome and tender song when you get down to it. one of the most memorable from the album for sure

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): now THIS is proto hyperpop

**sirpancakeXI** (9): it took me way too long to finally able to appreciate this song, it is hard to like it on first listen since it is so different from futile devices

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i wish the whole song sounded like the first 20 seconds

**vayyiqra** (9): Sufjan is kind of a genius for beginning this song with that cursed intro with noises that make my eyes water, and then the bleepbloops kick in which is such a contrast from the gentle guitar on "Futile Devices". It tells you right away that this is going to be Not Like Other Sufjan Albums. This song has a lot of lyrics that are relatable, singing about his anxieties and feeling kinda cringe ("and maybe I talk too fast / and maybe I talk too much), which is something I feel deeply all the time, especially since I have ADHD and my stimulants make me ramble about weird shit no cares about and say embarassing things I regret and think about for months afterward. Sad! Anyway, it's one of those "look it's deceptively upbeat but the lyrics are about being emotional" songs and I love those. I'm not against long songs, but I am not big on the part after the instrumental break where the strings come in, and then there's a long outro where he repeats the same line over and over which doesn't add a whole lot. Still, a very good song, but I wish he'd instead added another actual verse.

**waluigiest** (9): this is actually the same song as Too Much by Carly Rae Jepsen just with a more aggressive soundfont

**welcome2thejam** (9): First song of Sufjan's new direction, making it a very important track to get people aboard. Was there such a thing as too much "there's too much riding on that" for a song with so much riding on it? I mean, kinda, but Suf goes off on the outro instrumental so who cares

**RandomHypnotca** (8.9): anyone who says this is repetitive better not have a single charli xcx play

**BeauMeringue212** (8.8): "too much riding on that" me when I skipped all my college continuous assessments and have to get 90% on the final exam to pass

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): the production and instrumental can be a little bit messy at times but it is still a great song and the outro is phenomenal

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I love the way he balances a supersonic fart sound effect with nice vocals.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Oh so THIS is where Charli got the idea on how "how i'm feeling now" was supposed to sound like...

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me when a professor says this group project be 33% of the grade

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I took a shit before listening to this and when that intro started I was worried I hadn’t stopped… the song is actually pretty nice though

**nt96** (8): A musical version of what's going on in the head of a person with ADHD.

**slimboyfriend** (8): I like the way this song moves and eventually changes into this twisted brass and synth dystopia

**wavingwolves** (7.1): love instant whiplash this song causes on you coming right after futile devices

**Blisterman** (7): It's jarring to hear this after the track before it. Reminds me of Animal collective, but builds up to something grander.

**Qwilphish** (7): The beginning was great, but I felt that it died down a bit by the end and I wasn't as invested

**Uberpigeon** (7): lets ride lets ride

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): the percussion here… is this unironically proto-hyperpop??

**seanderlust** (6.6): from genius.com: "Sampled in: JOCKSTRAP TWINK TAKES BIG DICK by AOL" umm hello??????

**1998tweety** (6.5): this gets cool at the end

**mudkip1** (6): I fucking hate how this track starts but then the middle is good but then the ending is literally too much pun intended

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): there’s too much going on in the song, where is Carly when we need her

**J\_Toe** (4): the beginning is too gross

**runaway3212** (4): I prefer Call me maybe girl

**2dina3dworld** (10): I may have changed my score at the last minute because honestly, this is art. I kinda love overt-Christian Sufjan, and this indietronica masterpiece urging us to get right with God is iconic and exactly what I want to hear.

---

**akanewasright** (10): do not be distracted?????? *leo pointing meme*

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): Sufjan always manages to make religion sound amazing and transcendent

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I would go to church if the hymns slapped like this.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it’s giving me dark academia disney

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Much like my reaction to the self-titled track, I'm ALL IN for what Sufjan is going for here. The opening halting woodwinds and then sliding brass, and again the atonal choral vocals. I watched a concert clip where Sufjan was explaining the context of the album, and that this was the song he directly dedicated to Royal Robertson. That makes sense to me, since there are so many apocalyptic and heightened language throughout, about dark age, prophets, and getting right for salvation. Somehow, Sufjan managed to incorprate orchestral flourishes with this jarring soundscape to make this sound like on of Royal Robertson's paintings. It's grandoise and straining with passion, undercut with peculiar beats and chants. It's another anguished and busy track that speaks of larger, religious themes and I love how bold it goes.

**moonagenightmares** (10): god i love sufjan songs like this all quirky and dramatic, this is an 11 in my heart

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is obviously a reference to royal robertson, the self-proclaimed prophet who claimed to have visions from god and who is also the artist which the album artwork belongs to, but i like to think this can also be interpreted as some kind of call for help especially considering how often people turn towards religion and faith when going through a crisis...thank you sufjan i do need to get real get right with the lord

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song has an incredible build

**plastichaxan** (10): one of my favorite sufjan songs ever i know y'all are gonna rob this and i'll be pissed

**ReallyCreative** (10): my (FACE, FAce, Face, face...) is the front of shop

**runaway3212** (10): I really love this

**stryxen** (10): amen really he kinda said it all

**vayyiqra** (10): Okay, I shouldn't find this song funny, but I can't help finding it a little amusing. I love the meme that all of Sufjan's songs are about God, because 1. his lyrics, as I have said, are often open to varying interpretations and 2. he also really does sing about God a lot. This song also has Sufjan singing about outer space and weird shit about the apocalypse, so it's not just about him and his memetic religiosity but also more bizarre stuff he wouldn't normally sing about. This is because he's also channelling Royal Robertson here and singing from the viewpoint of someone having a psychotic break (explaining the lines about being paranoid and locking yourself in the bathroom). That's definitely not funny at all, so there is a darker edge to this song. On the other hand, it is pretty funny to hear Sufjan exhorting the listener to find God and chanting about aliens. (Spacespacespacespacespacespace)

**waluigiest** (10): the orchestral flourishes…. NUT

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): A FULL BOP YEP!!!!

**austrosinitic** (9.5): One of my favorite songs on this entire album. Musically it's  basically a perfect blend that represents paranoia and ex-Evangelical guilt alike, which I should know, since I'm both of those things! Like literally. I overanalyze this stupid album so much because my first gay crush lowkey made me experience a psychotic breakdown. Anyway, this track probably has the most overt references to Royal Robertson, the mentally ill artist that Sufjan was inspired to write this album by and nabbed the cover from. It's fantastic at using surreal imagery to expose the tension of this album right as we're about to reach its halfway mark (not counting Impossible Soul, of course). It's suprisingly easy to give this a queer reading, too. It's directed from Sufjan to himself, which is a first on this album, but if you think the source of his paranoia is him discovering that he's queer, then his consistent religious and spiritual fear here takes on a more tragic tone; who is he apologizing to in this song's chorus? Who has caused trouble and pain? Is he singing it to a man or a woman? Both? As he sings about how he needs to 'get right with the Lord', it's clear under this interpretation that the thing he needs to have a talk with God (stream Songs in the Key of Life) with about is his sexuality; does he want it to be purged from him, like a thorn in his flesh? Or is this perhaps a hint that the only way Sufjan can hold himself accountable before God is to accept his sexuality? That denying himself is actually causing him to sin and hurt himself and those around him more? Based on the fallout of the previous tracks, I'd certainly believe that! Either way, great song. Do the right thing, Sufjan.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this song is kind of sexy and hot

**IIIHenryIII** (9): it sounds like a song that would be played in a cartoon (not derogatory)

**UselessTacooo** (9): I have no clue what the hell is happening but gorl I am living.

**seanderlust** (8.5): I owe that street preacher that yells outside of the starbucks I go to an apology - apparently he was just doing a dramatic reading of the lyrics to get real get right

**wavingwolves** (8.1): bop

**Blisterman** (8): My favourite track on the album. A kaleidoscope of sounds.

**throwaway7650** (8): this song is christian propaganda so I predict it will tank

**Qwilphish** (7): Feels like I'm traveling through a wormhole, in a good way!

**welcome2thejam** (7): Love how dramatic it gets in the second half, how distressed and eventually how deadset on this path he sounds

**modulum83** (6.8): too scary

**fadedblue09** (6.5): It starts off as pretty fun initially, but gets overbearing towards the end

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): A little too youth-pastor-core for me

**AHSWeeknd** (6): five minutes may have been a bit much for this

**BeauMeringue212** (6): Bit zany tbh but gets better at the 3 min mark. It's giving conversion therapy vibes though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like a song that would be on yo gabba gabba

**AHSWeeknd** (10): ten minutes of excellence

**moonagenightmares** (10): THIS WAS THE FIRST SUFJAN SONG I EVER HEARD I CAN’T BELIEVE IT’S HERE. i highly recommend everyone check the fanmade video for this on youtube i was obsessed with it when i was like 13. the original is really good too, this is an 11 in spirit

**RandomHypnotca** (10): ok now this is the kind of long sufjan track that works for me

**throwaway7650** (10): idk if I like this as much as many moons but this song #will need all the help it can get I fear... it's #better than impossible soul tbh

**waluigiest** (10): he really put all his eras in one song and it’s so cool!!!

**seanderlust** (9.3): oh wow! an AIDS charity album. what a great cause! I hope none of the featured artists make a song with one of the most ominous four opening minutes i've ever heard!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this songs makes me feel like i can be everything

**frogaranaman** (9): I will be here emotionally devastated and bawling my eyes out to a 10+ minute Sufjan song and he would probably just be like "oh yeah that one, I finished that up on a Thursday afternoon and drank some tea afterwards. it was nice" when asked about the song

**slimboyfriend** (9): I bet all you hyperpop bleepbloopers are living for that intro

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): he has better “hidden gems” tbh (cough BORDERLINE cough) but this is better than i remember actually

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's giving A Sun Came, Alexa stream A Winner Needs A Wand

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): It sounds like a spooky western soundtrack in the beginning

**IIIHenryIII** (7): green was the color of the grass…

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): maybe if I liked art films

**nt96** (5): I already listened to Impossible Soul in it's entirety, we're not doing this again.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): im not listening to another 10+ minute long sufjan song

**vayyiqra** (3): This is creepy, wtf. I listen to Sufjan because I have depression and like bleepbloops, not to be unsettled.

**2dina3dworld** (9): M-I-A-M-I, we’re running out of time

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why are you running!?

**Blisterman** (10): I love the energy of this song and how it flows with the songs before and after it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Another ecstatic banger! A cool exploration on Cindi contemplating love versus her destinty to save the androids. Sir Greendown has a grip on her!! But yes, this song is just a joyful afrofuturistic delight.

**mudkip1** (10): fasterandfasterandfasterandfaster

**nt96** (10): Sufjan's walking, Janelle's running faster, Gorillaz dead in a plastic ditch, it's great!

**plastichaxan** (10): the ballot came with this 10 incorporated and honestly spilled

**Qwilphish** (10): Reminds me a lot of her song Dance Apocalyptic from her next album, The Electric Lady -- although I guess it should be the other way around. Her vocals are great here

**ReallyCreative** (10): ughhh the transitions here!!! Janelle going the fuck off! Yes!!!

**UselessTacooo** (10): I still don’t understand why she says “shaking like a schizo”, but it’s a stunning song.

**celladonn** (9.5): It bops

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): The guitar line on this one always gets me feeling some way, you know?

**akanewasright** (9): not “shaking like a schizo” 💀

**CrimsonROSET** (9): vroom vroom

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Almost perfect, why must Janelle have not one but TWO songs using the word "schizo"? It’s giving JC Chasez.

**slimboyfriend** (9): By itself this song isn't necessarily a 10, but it's part of one of the best album medley's I've ever heard, and the kick of Locked Inside wouldn't hit the same without this song bridging it from Dance or Die

**stryxen** (9): this song makes me think i can dance apologies to my downstairs neighbour

**throwaway7650** (9): the "faster, faster" is so catchy. a point docked for "schizo" though

**vayyiqra** (9): Yeah I have to take away a point for -that- line. I know she didn't mean it to be derogatory, but it's a bit unpleasant. Nevertheless, this does bop. As a big fan of the Blade Runner movies, the Philip K. Dick references are a nice touch for an album about robots.

**welcome2thejam** (9): I want to say something insightful cause this is the High Concept Pop rate but all I can tell you is that I immediately went to Youtube to see if somebody made a Sonic AMV to this song

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): but im tired

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): massively catchy but the "shaking like a schizo" line really irks me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I’m a freak. I’m a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?

**fadedblue09** (8): Solid banger that is dragged slightly by its bridge, even with or without THAT lyric

**frogaranaman** (8): okay Sonic the Hedgehog, give us VCV rate teas

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Honestly this should be a double track with “Dance or Die,” this really isn’t complete without the other half. Like I appreciate the thought of separating the tracks for the listener but I feel like most listeners are gonna listen to them together anyways.

**J\_Toe** (8): I'm not sure of the exact genre, probably a fusion of a number of things, but it's just so fun

**wavingwolves** (8): i was feeling this song so much but the "shaking like a schizo" hit me like a slap in the face... the rest is too good though

**runaway3212** (7.5): wished this was a bit slower sorry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): I was thinking about why so many in the radical left participate in "speedrunning". The reason is the left's lack of work ethic ('go fast' rather than 'do it right') and, in a Petersonian sense, to elevate alternative sexual archetypes in the marketplace ('fastest mario') (1/14)

**1998tweety** (7): not schizo....

**jackisboredtoday** (7): popheads complaining whenever they hear a song that’s under 110 BPM

**modulum83** (7): damn janelle i can't do it that fast... but i know someone who can! TWISTAAAAA

**musical\_pyn** (7): feels more like a transition than its own idea

**seanderlust** (5.5): i feel the most interesting parts of the instrumentation are the most muted here

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this sounds like the previous track except is faster and somewhat improved

**TiltControls** (5): like come alive some not great parts to the song but also the whole song is just weaker overall

**DefaultPophead** (0): That certain “shaking” line made me sad :(
