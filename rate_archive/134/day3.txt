---

**2dina3dworld** (10): The way he pronounces “blue” was cool and quirky up until I realised he pronounces it the same way as Boris Johnson does.

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): i always go into rates with some preconceived 11 and then end up looping a track that makes me reconsider said 11, anyway that was this track.

**austrosinitic** (10): Love this track there's an Oscar Wilde-y elegance to the flow and the production here that makes it sound super cool and coupled with the great beat this ends up becoming super fun

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): MF DOOM is shaking

**BeauMeringue212** (10): the chorus instrumental is ridiculously catchy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Like Houdini by Foster the People, the synth line here is so good it can be the hook on its own, but then they just keep adding elements and building it up more and more. HERE WE GO AGAIN.

**frogaranaman** (10): the tour visuals for this song are great high

**moonagenightmares** (10): GODDD I WANT TO GIVE THIS AN 11 SO BAD. But my heart belongs to sufjan </3

**ReallyCreative** (10): I don't think my insurance covers this condition

**runaway3212** (10): This is like heavenly

**stryxen** (10): me when im a scary gargle on a tar

**stsangie** (10): a smash etc

**UselessTacooo** (10): something about this just scratches a part of my brain. It’s so… nice. The production is stunning and is definitely the highlight.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): the chorus couldn’t be more perfect

**Awkward\_King** (9): i dont actually think i like this but i think i like this

**CrimsonROSET** (9): idk i think crying rhinestones would hurt?

**mudkip1** (9): I’m pretty sure I like this

**nootnoot781** (9): oh it’s the tiktok song

**welcome2thejam** (9): Got me undulating like Squidward

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.8): I really like this song too. I like the backing vocals in the chorus. Sometimes Damon's subdued vocals are so dull for me, but here they're very engaging with the rhythmic, clipped way he's singing. The lyrics are GREAT, really vivid imagery talking about gargoyles and the different climate and pollution issues he's talking about here. And rhinestones falling from the sky is very evocative imagery. This song is definitely a high point for me on the album. At Damon's best, he really curates disparate elements into a cohesive gem of a song.

**RandomHypnotca** (8.6): omg it's the tiktok song

**throwaway7650** (8.5): 0:52 is a "beat drop. ~~naevis~~ 2-D? calling." moment

**seanderlust** (8.2): damon albarn has a spaced-out, acid-drenched voice that makes him seem distant from the subject of his song which makes for a really interesting dynamic on lyrics about "factories far away"

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): *sigh* Finneeeee, let’s get this over with … … … *breathes in* YEAH! I LIKE BIG DICK DICK DICK DICK DICK DICK

**AHSWeeknd** (8): You can tell when a person is actually British when they sing in British.

**Leixander** (8): damon sometimes sounds like the most bored person on earth... or you know, he is just british

**modulum83** (8): i'm also a scary gargoyle on a tower we have so much in common

**akanewasright** (7.5): I think I’m most of the way to vibing with this

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): it’s pretty good but not the best on this album

**Blisterman** (7): Great production. Bit monotone though.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I know this is supposed to be one of the highlights from the album but it’s just okay

**J\_Toe** (7): this is more like the sound I associate with Gorillaz

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): shoutout to the guy that recreated the entire planned mv for this song over the course of 6 years. absolute king

**vayyiqra** (7): Really like this beat. Note it is debatable if the world really is overpopulated or not, since the true problem behind climate change isn't the number of (mostly poor) humans but a small minority of overpolluting corporations. The carrying capacity of the planet has been estimated to be 10 billion or higher! Stay based. Anyway, with your brain off, this is a jam.

**1998tweety** (6.5): ended billie

**Qwilphish** (5.5): It blew up on tiktok but I think there are way better songs on this album. The chorus is good, but the verses are painfully dull

**wavingwolves** (2): i get no enjoyment or enlightenment out of this so

**2dina3dworld** (3): this would’ve been just an “average” song to me if it wasn’t for the lyrics. I find the whole “schizo” motif insulting and stigmatising, and the way it uses schizophrenia both inaccurately and as some sideshow curiosity really rubs me the wrong way. Which is weird considering I regularly consume more problematic shit, but I think I let it slide because I genuinely love it. Whereas this, I have no emotional attachment to, and I find it kind of boring tbh.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): The skank on this one!!! The vocals, once again!!! She is just doing that isn't she! Like holy shit find yourself a woman could can scream-sing like this

**AHSWeeknd** (10): never forget when Janelle made Leonardo DiCaprio do the “la la la la la la la” at the Oscars.

**apatel27** (10): Janelle woke up and said let's murder this track

**Awkward\_King** (10): i feel like anyone who has seen her live will talk about it in this comment, but god her performing this was just incredible i wish i could go back

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): holy shit

**BeauMeringue212** (10): the bassline, the break in her voice, the crazy warbling high notes at the end.... this is amazing

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh look its the 11 on the album sorry

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is just a free-wheeling progressive journey.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): now THIS is what i’m talking about. Almost my 11 if it weren’t for that one questionable lyric in the hook but GOD this is good

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): YASSS omfg we need more of this genre from her

**mudkip1** (10): so fun

**nt96** (10): It gives me Bjork vibes with how vocally unhinged she sounds. Love it

**plastichaxan** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**ReallyCreative** (10): omg I love nu-metal!!!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Massive bop

**stryxen** (10): the lyrics to this may be keysmashes for all i know and it would still be an 11 contender (and then i read the lyrics and it got even better)

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I'm just disappointed horrible histories never covered this song to sing about the real war of the roses

**UselessTacooo** (10): If anyone follows my existence on the discord server, you would know that I am the #1 Come Alive stan. It is definitely my favourite Janelle song, and might possibly be one of my favourite songs of all time. There’s just something about it that’s hard to place. It might be just how unhinged it sounds that makes me love it, or it might be Janelle’s amazing vocal performance. This song genuinely deserves top 2, though I doubt it will make it there. Despite all my 11 campaigning for this song, I discovered something else that I chose to give my 11 to. Call me a fraud I guess?

**waluigiest** (10): she can do it all

**akanewasright** (9.9): this would be a really good 11 but apparently Janelle hates schizophrenic people

**seanderlust** (9.6): 100% pure uncut hard rock

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Another highlight, it's like a rock driven musical theater number

**austrosinitic** (9): I wish there wasn't a kind of slur here (sch*o) but aside from ableist language I do love how genuinely paranoid and frantic this sounds, my gateway to loving the second half of this album that I've neglected for so long

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Is “schizo” offensive I legitimately do not know.

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): Why are you yelling at me?

**runaway3212** (9): This oscar performance... I felt so bad

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): The Oscars performance is the definitive version of this song to me

**throwaway7650** (9): someone link the performance I'm lazy af

**vayyiqra** (9): Janelle, why? I know you are an empathetic person. I don't think you would use this word like this today. Anyway though, I never did notice there are a lot of themes on this album about mental health with references to asylums and medication and so on. Now I'm interested in looking into that further.

**moonagenightmares** (8.7): reminds me of that song from the eating brains scene in billy & mandy

**IIIHenryIII** (8): that's aggressive, I kinda like it

**skargardin** (8): THAT'S WHEN WE COME ALIIIIIIIIIIIVE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): im gonna be honest i thought the song she sang at the oscars was an original song and im only just finding out now that its supposed to be a parody of this

**Uberpigeon** (8): stigmatise mental illness but make it a bop

**welcome2thejam** (8): And now it's time to fucking rip

**Blisterman** (7): Wedding bell heavy metal.

**DaHumanTorch** (7): oh my god her poor vocal cords....i hope Metropolis has a good healthcare system

**FlavaSavaVandal** (7): the kingdom of England in the middle of the 15th century after they lose the Hundred Years War to France

**frogaranaman** (7): feels like the action scene of a classic spy film

**TiltControls** (7): it's good. now if only it didn't have that line

**RandomHypnotca** (6.3): now why did such a good song have to use that word… and SO much…

**1998tweety** (6): not schizo again...

**Qwilphish** (6): More of a spooky kind of frantic. It sounds like a halloween song

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): This just does not fit, the vocals are a mess at points and Janelle also says schizo …

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Honestly this song has always freaked me out and her performing it at the Oscars was kinda cringe… like there’s this video where Bruce Vilanch talks about the infamous opening segment of the 1989 Academy Awards and he says you can’t go into the audience and talk to stars unless you’re on their level and I love Janelle but she’s not there yet.

**wavingwolves** (5): ultimately it's very middle of the road

**2dina3dworld** (10): I’m just gonna call this a banger because I have nothing smart to say. Because really, it is a banger.

---

**xxipil0ts** (11): A HOUSE BOP!

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): If I only had a quarter of the charisma that Janelle shows on this record - or even this song alone - I'd be fucking drowning in pussy, swear to you fools

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THESE LYRICS, please, they’re genius.

**apatel27** (10): anti-authoritarianism but make it funky

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): there's no way I'm not dancing to this

**Blisterman** (10): I love the robotic rapidfire rap flow on this.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Starting off with Saul's rhythmic rapping of a lot of themes in this album, it's so sublime to me. And then Janelle going "Oh these dreams are forever/If You Leave Now or Never". I am ENTRANCED!!! The bassline too, has me hooked. And Janelle's rapping verses are so well-excecuted, and then the lyrics are chock-full of incredible storytelling. The whole song is just a funk opus. Fuck the great divide and fuck systemic racism!

**fadedblue09** (10): an opening track that is simultaneously a banger and a worldbuilding song

**J\_Toe** (10): just so fun

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BANGER

**nt96** (10): Now THIS is how you open the album.

**plastichaxan** (10): biggest BOP in the rate for sure, i cant not sing along and just dance around

**ReallyCreative** (10): THESE STREETS ARE FOR EVAH!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This instrumental is so hypnotic and Janelle’s rapping fits it perfectly, an 11 contender. I love that we’re rating Saul Williams even as just a feature.

**slimboyfriend** (10): She fleshes out an entire album's worth of a world in the first five minutes of her own album! That's incredible!!

**stryxen** (10): her voice simply sounds amazing here and as the first ~actual~ song on the album it sets the tone of the album amazingly

**throwaway7650** (10): *seamless* transition into and from this

**Uberpigeon** (10): this is a good album opener. its so WEIRD sounding and futuristic and cool i love it

**vayyiqra** (10): As well as being a jam, this song's lyrics describe the dystopian setting of the album so well and hints at the coming of Cindi as a messiah figure. Maybe the single most underrated song on the album.

**welcome2thejam** (10): With grooves this good, I guess I'm living forever

**Qwilphish** (9.5): SO groooovy. I love the way that these songs blend into each other already its quite a trip. For this song itself, it is amazing at setting the actual tone of the album which is just fun masquerading terror and franticness. Love the hectic feeling of the song

**austrosinitic** (9): I don't have much to write about the trilogy of songs that opens this album because I am a big dumb dumb and I am saving all my brain power for analyzing Age of Adz but they're all so fucking good I hope they do very well and all end up in the Top 10

**runaway3212** (9): This is such a positive experience

**UselessTacooo** (9): The rapping on this track is really fun, and the chorus is really catchy. The production is also tons of fun. While not being technically stunning or unique, it’s ju too fun to score lower.

**waluigiest** (9): the world building across all of her projects is unmatched

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Such a great intro the world of this album, you can instantly sense the intrigue and panic that the character must be experiencing

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): bop

**akanewasright** (8.3): This gets called her best sometimes and I… don’t get that. It’s quite good though

**seanderlust** (8.2): the yassification of new hampshire's state motto

**RandomHypnotca** (8.1): guess I'll die then 🤷

**1998tweety** (8): big bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): daisybop

**musical\_pyn** (8): this song made me realize that janelle needs to feature on the next avalanches album

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i choose die

**modulum83** (7.5): to quote tramp stamps,

**frogaranaman** (7): okay Squid Games

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): we all die you either dance yourself or get killed

**TiltControls** (7): Wow Dance Dance Revolution taglines have gotten really intense

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Is this title threatening me?

**IIIHenryIII** (0): how can I dance to this? It's too boring! I'm not one to give zeros in rates, but this one is well-deserved.

**2dina3dworld** (11): I love this song. I’ve been very vocal about my love of songs that are dreamy, that balance between loneliness and longing and connection and true happiness. Empire Ants ticks all of those boxes - with the beautiful, swooping synths, the wall of sound effect, and the transition that knocks you off of your feet and takes you away with it. Empire Ants is truly an art piece capable of evoking emotions just through the strings that herald in the transition between Damon and Yukimi. Gorgeous.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): One of the few songs that immediately clicked with me, it’s a unique song on this record that twinkles away dreamily in the first half before transitioning into this synthpop banger and a half.

**akanewasright** (10): That feeling when you start cumming uncontrollably because of a synth

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this is otherworldly

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Going into this rate I was 99% sure this was gonna be my 11 but a certain song did change my mind. Nevertheless I do think the moment where the synths come in halfway through this song is the best singular musical moment in this rate.

**Blisterman** (10): The beat switch on this gives me chills.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): that feat is a serve

**fadedblue09** (10): The second half of this is just heavenly

**modulum83** (10): if you say anything bad about this song i'm sending my personal army of italian mafia goons after you

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): okay i love this one actually..also the little dragon vocalist sounds so much like kali uchis

**mudkip1** (10): little dragon sounds great here

**musical\_pyn** (10): the second half of this might be my faovrite moment on the album

**Qwilphish** (10): Such a mood. Little Dragon is so great on this. Stream Stuck With Me By Tinashe Ft. Little Dragon

**ReallyCreative** (10): godddd the turn!!! such a moment

**runaway3212** (10): okay this song is amazing but I just read the lore of this album while listening to this song and frankly I don't think I will ever recover

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): it’s the 11 contender on Plastic Beach

**seanderlust** (10): "and if the whole world is crashing down on you/ fall through space out of mind with me" is an early contender for favorite lyric on the album

**sirpancakeXI** (10): in love with the instrumental

**stsangie** (10): BEST SONG HERE

**throwaway7650** (10): oh wow the intro/breakdown... :poohascend:

**UselessTacooo** (10): wow. I was not expecting the way this would build, but I am not complaining. It has this way of evoking so much emotion that I just can’t get over. An 11 contender for sure.

**waluigiest** (10): The writing is beyond gorgeous. And the way it swells into this beautiful electronic segment about the failures of empire and capitalism…. This is philosophical excellence.

**RandomHypnotca** (9.7): me when I'm playing SimAnt

**thedoctordances1940** (9.7): this shit's just brilliant

**BeauMeringue212** (9): love this, great late night drive music

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this song sounds like a journey from hell to heaven; the first section being the former and the other the latter - it just kept getting better and better

**nootnoot781** (9): i love kali uchis

**TiltControls** (9): Both of the little dragon collabs on the album are stellar

**vayyiqra** (9): Yeah I'm lowkey giving this a high score partly because I'm Popheads' one (1) stan of Little Dragon, but also they did kill it on this track. The instrumental on this is beautiful, like a lot of their music, and it's good to see this album get a little more serious and less ~quirky. After that beat switch in the middle where Yukimi Nagano comes in, it basically becomes a Little Dragon song for the rest of it as well. Anyway I'm using this comment to plug their album Nabuma Rubberband which you (yes, you, the person reading this) should listen to if you like this song! They have plenty more where this came from.

**wavingwolves** (8.9): love a slowburn of a song

**AHSWeeknd** (8): That middle part does it for me.

**apatel27** (8): the instrumental tho

**frogaranaman** (8): when Little Dragon enters ascend_spongebob_meme.png

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the vibes were cool here

**plastichaxan** (8): this is basically gorillaz x kali uchis what's not to love

**stryxen** (8): once upon a time i was the biggest empire stan-ts but it’s not slaying like it once slayed to me unfortunately

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): On the one hand, there are many things I like about this song. For one, the lyrics are again masterful. Beautiful metaphors likening the march of humankind in our ruthless capitalist society to be ants who cannot rest. Currently I'm kind of still iffy on the second half. I think Yukimi sounds good, but I think the groovy beat switch makes the song kind of generic-sounding.

**1998tweety** (7.5): this is nice

**austrosinitic** (7.5): Would just be an okay slow tempo song near the middle of this record eclipsed by Up On Melancholy Hill and even Broken but that 'working the machine' part would be a 10 on its own it's so SLICK

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I like Little Dragon and I wish they had more of a presence on this track

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): both parts are good but they could’ve meshed better

**Awkward\_King** (7): if only they weren't british

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i do like this song but i feel like the circlejerk around it being the greatest gorillaz song ever made is a little too much. it really couldve benefitted from an extra minute or two and an actual ending

**welcome2thejam** (7): The transition into the second half made me audibly "ooh" so earns an extra point for that

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): this was the last song i had to rate so i put it on and then forgot to perceive it until halfway through and i thought i had accidently gone to the next track

**nt96** (6): Someone described Gorillaz music being for adults who eat cereal for breakfast. Oddly enough I agree.

**moonagenightmares** (5.6): snooze

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): she is opera, she is the moment, she may have gotten paid her dues but it’s hard to tell.

---

**throwaway7650** (11): there are many highlights in the 1st half of the song, including how janelle sings "BaBopByeYa" and the section in spanish, but the 2nd half of this song is just a masterpiece to me, basically starting from where the strings come in around 4:00. this album - and janelle's extended discography - is split into suites but this song itself is a whole symphony with movements (I hope I can learn the violin solo someday). also speaking of violin, I played it in the pit orchestra for my school's musical in 2020, ragtime. the "I must go"s at the end really remind me of something from one of sarah's solos (I think), just another factor that makes me appreciate this song even more. I really hope I'm not the only 11 for fucking once because it deserves!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I get chills every time I listen to this, such an iconic track.

**apatel27** (10): Also known as Janelle flexing

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this like is something I would hear at the end of a classic movie

**ChidiArianaGrande** (10): I want it to be known that this song 57821 and Impossible Soul are all 11s in my heart.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): janelle bond theme when

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): If you couldn't tell, the elements of this closer are what I've been salivaitng over this whole album. So yes, it's a grandoise, heartwrenching closer where Cindi professes her love to her own "BaBopByeYa" aka Anthony Greendown. It's a sweeping, jazz epic that begins with Janelle's crooning into her resounding calling out of her "BaBopByeYa"-the term of endearment for Anthony. Then the rhythmic chanting of Movement 2, into Spanish verses of surviving love throughout the chaos of injustice. It's a song of selflessness and sacrifice for love. The bridge is dramatic classical swells with skittering violins and ominous basoon, with whispering Spanish chants. It's delightfully eerie. But then at the end she pleads "I must go" and she's the archanroid set to free the androids. It's a bittersweet. It's cinematic, it's dramatic and a perfect closer to this epic journey of an album.

**fadedblue09** (10): A combination of topnotch arrangements spanning various musical styles yet it blends it so seamlessly, and overall a triumphant closing to this album

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): best song on the album, amazing “grand finale”

**nt96** (10): The wonderful range of emotions and style changes, outsold Impossible Soul I'm afraid.

**plastichaxan** (10): BaBopByeYass

**ReallyCreative** (10): theatrical, melodramatic, over the top, at times completely unnecessary; all the makings of a perfect closer

**runaway3212** (10): the perfect bond theme

**seanderlust** (10): janelle really showcases her theater chops on this entire album but ESPECIALLY here

**skargardin** (10): such an amazing closing song, truly stunning

**stryxen** (10): omg all the closers are my highest 11 contenders, if impossible soul (and pirate jet) weren’t here i would be one of (i hope) many 11s on this

**UselessTacooo** (10): The way she can make a 9min long song that does not get boring at all. Taylor could never.

**vayyiqra** (10): I tend to love long, epic closing tracks and this is no exception. It's no Impossible Soul but damn, it is great. What a way to end the album and this part of the story. Now I want to listen to The Electric Lady and keep going. That's a sign of a great album.

**waluigiest** (10): i SAID get the orchestra ready!!!

**wavingwolves** (10): oh.. woah... woahhh.... woaaahhh.... WOAH.... WOOOOAAAHHH????

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): MY PAPAYAAAAAAAAAA

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): boop

**celladonn** (9.5): Love how theatrical this is, great closer

**modulum83** (9.2): wait so is this entire album about fucking a robot

**1998tweety** (9): pretty

**akanewasright** (9): This feels like the score under every spy scene in movies ever, but I like that shit so…

**Blisterman** (9): The album finishes on an ambiguous note with this epic. Reminds me of jazzy 60s film scores.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The narrative of the album is over at this point so this is just, like, outro music, and Janelle takes the opportunity to indulge herself a bit and it actually pays off well. Every time you start to get bored by it or think “okay this can end” it switches up to something new so it never feels like wasted air time. I really wish there was a *Fantasia* style short film to accompany this because it sounds like you’re watching a movie.

**Leixander** (9): I MUST GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**Qwilphish** (9): A very very cinematic track -- matches the vibe of this universe very well.

**RandomHypnotca** (9): isn't that the coffee for your head girl

**welcome2thejam** (9): Suite III honestly kinda lost me a bit, but BaBopByeYa makes for a satisfying closer.

**austrosinitic** (8.5): Glad I did this rate because listening to this song again makes me understand the cinematic ambition of the entire album more. It's definitely a very good one for sure but I do wonder why it had to be *eight* minutes long, did Janelle intend for this to be the 'credits' song or something?

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): such a grand and cinematic closing song

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): objectively this is great but it’s missing something for me to make is amazing

**BeauMeringue212** (8): this makes me think that Janelle would Slay a Bond theme

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I would say it feels a little too long, but I gave Impossible Soul my 11 so that might make me a hypocrite.

**frogaranaman** (8): skibbidascubadaskebiddybop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): baBop is right!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): sounds like the theme that plays before you face the final boss in a video game

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's good, but I think the ending instrumental might bring it down a bit

**moonagenightmares** (7): its not that im a long song hater but this really was too long considering it didnt have that much going for it

**J\_Toe** (6): a journey from beginning to end

**mudkip1** (6): this is ok

**Uberpigeon** (5): this album really goes out with a wimper

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I'll pretend this doesn't exist when I come back to this album

**2dina3dworld** (10): I loved this song, but my comment is gonna refer to how vayy would post headlines about Pompeii and jokes about Pompeii and refer to it as “HCP promo gone too far”. Not word for word, but that’s the gist, and for some reason writing that out made me emo. Vote threemo for next rate cycle.

---

**celladonn** (11): This is THEE Sufjan song for me, can't get over how good it is

**sirpancakeXI** (11): This for me is the perfect song for a nice long walk at night and help me deal with my emotion. when im feeling sad on that particular day, it can help me feel better about myself. when i'm having a good mood it can also help me feel refreshing. Even though i'm on my 300th listen, i can still find something new that i enjoy about this song. I dont know how to explain but it just have such a big impact for me. this song is also the reason why sufjan become my favorite artist of all time and i'm happy to finally give this my 11.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): so TIL how to pronounce Sufjan

**akanewasright** (10): The buildup of this song is nothing short of masterful tbh

**austrosinitic** (10): Prettiest fucking song on this entire album aside from Impossible Soul, IMO. Debate a wall. It's been so fun to break apart the symbolism Sufjan uses here every time I've listened to this album because our favorite white poet twink addressing a volcano is such a fucking awesome image, and because the lyrics here are just top tier Sufjan in general, and also some of the most comprehensible, yet fascinating on the entire album. Let's start with the title: Vesuvius was that volcano in Rome that blew up in 79 AD and destroyed Pompeii, right? There are two main themes we're supposed to get here that are constantly referenced by the imagery: fire, particularly the kind triggered by sudden explosions (like falling in love with the same gender!) ("Vesuvius, fire of fire", "the heart of the earth and the weapons of warmth", "the elegant smoke", "the permanent blast", "fall on the flame or fall on the floor") and death ("for in life as in death", "the murdering ghost that you cannot ignore", "it leads to an article of imminent death"). Very biblical imagery, given the setting. And following that, it's interesting to note how fire is portrayed as a purifying thing throughout the Bible; see Isaiah 48: 9-11, Zechariah 13: 8-9, and 1 Peter 1:7. Some theologians (such as myself) even argue that hell — which Sufjan is definitely in emotionally and spiritually right now, just look at how much pain our boy is in — must be purgatorial, because some other stuff in the New Testament hints towards that, because eternal hell isn't a doctrine in Judaism anyway and because it only caught on in Christianity after it became the official religion of the Roman Empire (boo! boo!) and because fire is clearly portrayed everywhere else in Scripture as something that redeems. And fellas, this is where Sufjan is right now. He's finally come to the breaking point where he has to confront something that's been swallowing up in death and so that death cannot be swallowed up in life. And if you're reading this shit you know by now (this is going to be one of the last songs to go out, right?! Right?!) that I believe that what's causing him spiritual and romantic death is him not being able to accept sexuality. For Sufjan to escape death he has to take up his cross and finally surrender to it, to accept the attraction to another man that was clearly established in Futile Devices and later will be again in All For Myself. And the fire that spews forth from Mount Vesuvius will help him do that. Keep note that fire can be seen as a symbol of passion and ardour; here, it's a metaphor for love. (Also keep in mind that dramatically subverting imagery of hell — including hellfire — is a common thing queer artists do, such as we saw with Montero). I argued in Bad Communication that 'the ghost' is Sufjan's lingering compulsory heterosexuality; hence, the fire here will have to overpower the ghost that Sufjan still favors. Above all this, one commandment remains: "Sufjan, follow your heart". The death knell of the flame will also, as the old alchemists said, bring out life and redemption. Sufjan is a phoenix and he's our gay little phoenix. Honestly, I might just be a desperate person trying to relate Age of Adz to my own experiences here, but also, when I think about all this, who the fuck can deny that this is an album about queer self-acceptance and love?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): absolutely transcendent

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I just want to take this opportunity to say how much I love Sufjan’s consistent use of feminine background vocals. Shoutout to the incomparable Shara Nova.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): favorite breakdown song in the album me thinks

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): It's a pious, existential crisis indietronica banger, idk! Clearly a theme of what I enjoy from this album!!

**frogaranaman** (10): I was about to comment "the yassification of Sufjan Stevens" then had to pause and take a step back. like come on. as if he didn't yassify half his listening base

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love this, but hearing him say his name over and over again throws me off (vesuvius starts to sound like Sufjan)

**Leixander** (10): just another "why does it have to be so hard" comment

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): kinda one of the best songs to have a breakdown to especially when you’re going through shit. he’s right...why DOES it have to be so hard?

**mudkip1** (10): the way he somehow rhymes sufjan with Vesuvius UGH!!!!! a POET!!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): but if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing favors the ghost?

**runaway3212** (10): This is really beautiful, sometimes I just feel like a volcano, waiting to be fucked

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this is how I definitively learned to pronounce Sufjan's name

**seanderlust** (10): sob

**skargardin** (10): WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO HARD

**stryxen** (10): hypnotised into believing my name is sufjan for 5 minutes and 28 seconds

**throwaway7650** (10): the frantic energy heating up from a 0 to 100 as the song progresses... I feel like a bubbling volcano... sufjan, american god of fire

**UselessTacooo** (10): the tenderness, followed by sonic insanity is what brings me to the song every time. It’s just so emotional, and deserves more than I think it will get.

**vayyiqra** (10): Here I would post the gif of Andy Samberg saying "alright, I'm gonna go cry". Yep. This is kind of my go-to song for the last year when I need to mope in the shower. It's once again hard to tell what exactly he's singing about here, but the specifics don't matter that much to me: it's more about how it's just such a doomer mood. Let me explain it in a comment I wrote a few days ago: "[I]t's like this: this song is just like, the saddest thing I have ever heard in my life. He sounds so incredibly defeated and regretful. Someone needs to give this man a hug. I think it helps me to know someone else feels this way and then relate to that". Genius thinks this song is about anxiety, which tracks with the lyrics ("the panic inside") and the feeling of impending doom (Vesuvius famously once erupted and leveled whole cities, if you remember, which is pretty apocalyptic). I don't want to project my own feelings onto his lyrics -too- much, but Sufjan is known for writing sad music, and I have to wonder if this song was inspired by having depression, because some of the lyrics ("I cannot be made to laugh", "I'd rather be burned than be living", "though I know I will fail", and most of all "why does it HAVE to be so hard?") capture that exact feeling so incredibly well. Yeah I'm going to loop this song and mope. Hugs are appreciated.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Opening piano is gorgeous as hell. Also wild as hell how incredible the "Vesuvius fire of fire" section is, and yet it might be only this album's third best climax where they repeat the same lines over and over again until shit like "follow me now as I favor the ghost" becomes imprinted into your brain

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): just really phenomenal

**RandomHypnotca** (9.6): I never realised Vesuvius could rhyme with Sufjan but here we are

**plastichaxan** (9.5): throwback to this song teaching me how to pronounce his name

**DaHumanTorch** (9): this was just random noises. i loved it

**nt96** (9): Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Pompeii was a great place. Hopefully they would have been a Sujwiftie.

**waluigiest** (9): every time he introduces a new orchestral texture I just start smiling

**wavingwolves** (8.8): "i'd rather be burned than be living in debt" thank god you're probably rich then

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): that is a volcano

steelstepladder: **\_\_Avaritia** (8): The instruments are cool and stuff but I can't shake the feeling that I heard this song already. Catchy though

**J\_Toe** (8): this is one of the more nicer songs on the album, for me

**modulum83** (8): now this right here is a banger. excellent song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): “Pompeii” didn’t deserve to win the commercial pop rock rate!

**slimboyfriend** (7): "follow me now as I finger the ghost"

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this started off good but went downhill in the last two minutes by doing too much.

**Blisterman** (6): This is the only song I knew going into this album. It’s fine.

**fadedblue09** (5): Really could've done without the choir and should've ended at 3 minutes

**Qwilphish** (4.5): It doesn't really go anywhere besides devolve into some medieval fair music at the end

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): who brought the dying otamatone in

>(10): I loved this song, but my comment is gonna refer to how vayy would post headlines about Pompeii and jokes about Pompeii and refer to it as “HCP promo gone too far”. Not word for word, but that’s the gist, and for some reason writing that out made me emo. Vote threemo for next rate cycle.

oh no i didn't mean to make you sad : (

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this is the second song that really lends itself to Corona jokes that we’ve rated in the past two months. Also, I blame Poppy (the artist, not the user) for being the reason why I gave up on DAP when Miss A and Cape God were actually really good.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): You can’t go wrong with Cindy Mayweather’s story

**apatel27** (10): Pure Anthem

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is so dreamy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She really did lock in here.

**Blisterman** (10): My favourite vocal performance in the album. Janelle shows her versatility as she switches effortlessly between styles.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A post-disco smooth gem of a song. It's amazing how Janelle can balance the paletable moments of love in the sing while also giving exposition to the Android world in Metropolis. Also, the lyric "The color black means it's time to die/and nobody questions why" is so loaded and bracing. Another clever line showing how clearly the androids are an allegory for black people who disproprtionally suffer from systemic racism.

**frogaranaman** (10): literally predicted COVID

**Leixander** (10): OH HOW OH HOW I NEED YOU BABY KEEP ME FROM GOING CRAZY I NEED YOU BABY I NEED YOU TO STAY turnitup.gif

**mudkip1** (10): Jesus the transitions between these first three tracks are incredible

**musical\_pyn** (10): really love the groove on this one, and the chorus is incredible

**plastichaxan** (10): the chorus lives in my mind rent free

**Qwilphish** (10): This is definitely the most melodic of the songs on this album so far. This chorus is killer and makes me want to slow jam.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Mario Party minigame music but with a tiny bit of stank on it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I played the four-track stretch from the intro to this one in an Uber, and the driver was like "wow that was one long song!" Little does he know I almost played Impossible Soul

**sirpancakeXI** (10): im in love with the chorus

**stryxen** (10): this chorus is so satisfying and addictive i can’t help but sing along

**UselessTacooo** (10): It gets its best qualities from that amazing chorus. Without it I would give the song an 8, but it’s just so good.

**vayyiqra** (10): This album's lyrics, as always with Janelle, are based as fuck as she makes this scifi story sound plausible and have parallels to real-world oppression. I also love the trope of robots falling in love with humans or with each other

**waluigiest** (10): it’s stevie wonderesque, and the fact that she cohesively packs all of these ideas and sounds into just over 4 minutes is masterful

**xxipil0ts** (10): That three song stretch from Dance or Die to this is so satisfying.

**akanewasright** (9.5): raters conga line when

**fadedblue09** (9.5): One thing I like about this albums is that the songs are equally enjoyable as standalone bops while perfectly fitting into the album storyline

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): Dancing because it's a bop but crying because we live in this capitalist dystopia

**throwaway7650** (9.5): omg wow, this chorus is even catchier, I love the cadence

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): saur good

**CrimsonROSET** (9): had you told me this song was about twitter i’d have believed you

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the chorus melody reminds me of American Boy. I'm so sorry, I meant, that Fortnite song

**nt96** (9): Janelle predicted the lockdown. We stan a prophetic queen! ❤

**rotating3Dtext** (9): me in 2020

**runaway3212** (9): [corona comment goes here]

**skargardin** (9): I feel like this might be underrated

**modulum83** (8.7): this started at a 7 but as the song kept going on i kept incrementally increasing my score

**RandomHypnotca** (8.7): something something covid-19

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): my least fave out of the first like...7 songs i fear but still good

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): I don't remember this song being this weak but luckily the chorus on this thing slappt and that's enough for me I guess!

**cremeebrulee** (8): omfg help why does the chorus sound like when you get the invincibility power up in mario kart

**ignitethephoenix** (8): me during the pandemic

**J\_Toe** (8): early instance of queer-coding

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Probably one of the clunkier tracks on the album, there’s some nice imagery and a strong central idea but it’s too preoccupied with telling Cyndi’s story to achieve its full potential as a song. The chorus is great though!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): place tired pandemic joke here

**1998tweety** (6.5): quarantine teas

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): its kinda generic and boring but the guitar solo makes up for it a little

**IdiotBox01** (6): she sounds like that Alicia Keys chick

**moonagenightmares** (5): it came and went

**2dina3dworld** (10): strummy strummy Sufjan makes his only appearance in this rate! Clearly y’all liked that more than some of the indietronica tracks

---

**Leixander** (11): every second of this song is perfect

**slimboyfriend** (11): Loving someone like a brother is hot when Sufjan sings about it, but weird when Taylor Swift mentions it

**akanewasright** (10): God, I want a hug (bc this is Sufjan, this line is up for interpretation)

**apatel27** (10): Sufjan Gay Icon

**BeauMeringue212** (10): wanted to give this an 11 but it wouldn't really be in the spirit of the rate since it's so much more accoustic and low-key compared to everything else

**cremeebrulee** (10): one of the coziest songs i’ve ever heard <3 the irony in him saying words are futile devices when the lyrics here capture what he’s trying to convey so perfectly.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh boy i cant wait for this acoustic album from indie folk legend sufjan stevens

**fadedblue09** (10): I know it's technically just a preface to this album, but it's easily my favorite. The simple acoustic arrangement makes its emotionality stand out

**frogaranaman** (10): for the longest time I thought this said "fertile devices" and was going to make a breedable and submissive joke to it

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67706c0000bebb671e2fc0e095c9a81bdb391d

**mudkip1** (10): bop hunty ariana slay mawma boots the house down charli xcx yes god

**musical\_pyn** (10): sometimes when I'm sad I'll just watch videos of sufjan singing this song live and for some reason it's just super comforting, would highly recommend

**Qwilphish** (10): Beautiful Beautiful Intro. Definitely a different vibe than the rest of the songs, but it lets it stand out.

**RandomHypnotca** (10): yes sufjan, sing your sweet little gay words to me

**ReallyCreative** (10): y'all something lgbt just happened to me

**seanderlust** (10): listen, i know sufjan was sick of the strummy-strum guitar songs for this album, but i'm such a sucker for it. this song is gorgeously tender and intimate and sweet and i love it so much

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this is such a beautiful song and also make me extremely lonely :/

**stryxen** (10): words are futile devices? shut up then? (- my comment if this was a 0 but it’s unfortunately one of my favourite songs ever)

**stsangie** (10): omg the cmbyn song it's been a long long time since i memorised your face it's been four hours now since i wandered through your place and when i sleep on your couch i feel very safe and when you bring the blankets i cover up my face i do love you i do love you and when you play guitar i listen to the strings buzz the metal vibrates underneath your fingers and when you crochet i feel mesmerised and proud and i would say i love you but saying it out loud is hard so i won't say it at all and i won't stay very long but you are the life i've needed all along i think of you as my brother although that sounds dumb and words are futile devices

**thedoctordances1940** (10): it's just so beautiful

**throwaway7650** (10): the your type 10s/11s/essays better give their 11s to this

**UselessTacooo** (10): if he no likey strummy strummy song, why he make strummy strummy song? much to think about.

**vayyiqra** (10): What a perfect opening track. Sufjan is perhaps best known for his acoustic ballads and gentle vocals, and this is the one (1) song on the album he does in that style (putting aside the coda section of "Impossible Soul" which is in many ways a counterpart to this song). Anyway, let's talk about the lyrics. It's ironic Sufjan is singing about how hard it is to express his feelings and put them into words in this song, given he literally does that for a living and is a gifted lyricist. But what he's talking about here is something that men especially tend to struggle with given how we're raised to feel that affection toward each other is inappropriate and stigmatized. Genius says this song may be about being confused over if this feeling is platonic or romantic, which makes sense to me since both are legitimate kinds of love. There's a widespread reading here that this song is also about unrequited gay love, which is not an out-there take - after all, he is singing about a man here. If that's the side of this song that you relate to I'm not going to argue with that and say "nooo this isn't gay it can't be", because that'd be dumb. However, this song is also relatable in other ways. For me at least, instead it makes me think of my friends and especially my brothers, and how we used to struggle to be affectionate with each other and felt awkward even hugging each other. It's incredibly important to me to be able to open up to each other and express our feelings without feeling ashamed. Basically this song makes me think about how sometimes I just wanna hug my bros, and that's beautiful.

**waluigiest** (10): it evokes such a distinctly nostalgic kind of longing. I can’t get over the tenderness in these lyrics.

**wavingwolves** (10): how is this only 2:14 but it's powerful enough to feel both like a punch in the gut and a warm hug

**austrosinitic** (9): This is already an amazing song about the experience of falling in love with a friend BUT it gets even better when you introduce the queer angle to it, since the platonic and the romantic overlap a lot within the liminal space that homoeroticism often is. Like, remember Johnlock and Destiel? ...okay, no, sorry, those were terrible examples. Fortunately, there's actually a lot of better ones in biblical and Christian tradition (that the church's homophobia has sadly covered up in modern times) which I'm sure Sufjan thought of when he wrote this, knowing him! David and Jonathan, anyone? Or better yet, remember Jesus and John, 'the beloved disciple'? You ought to, because that's what John My Beloved was about! This dynamic I'm talking about is perhaps best  encapsulated in two lines of Futile Devices: "You are the life I needed all along", which is both gay and as Jesus as hell (as is the norm for Sufjan's lyricism) thanks to it being both an expression of romantic adoration yet also tying in to the very Christian idea of being revived from both physical and spiritual death (something that's going to come up a lot again on Age of Adz) and/or born again into a fuller and greater life — something that can be triggered both by religious conversion and, from the narrator's perspective here, falling in love with his best friend. This is the beginning of how Sufjan manages to radically reconcile his own personal experiences of being of faith and being queer in this album. But what really seals the deal here is the line 'I think of you as my brother, although that sounds dumb'. One of the least heteronormative things about early Christian practice is how, contrary to how its conservative practitioners control and gaslight their queer children today, it renounced traditional family ties for greater community. As Christ said: "Who are my mother and my brothers? [...] Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother (Matthew 12: 46-50)" Sufjan feels *this* close to the dude he's singing to to call him his own flesh and blood like this, in the same way that Jesus is talking about. And while I really want to avoid any thoughts of incestous jokes here (which would give big "Trust him like a brother" energy) I'm just saying that this same feeling of familial love is also present in couples in a different way than it is amongst siblings, and that if there's anything to blame for statements not wording this in a less awkward way, it's heteronormativity! This is the first hint that the protagonist of this album is, if we're interpreting him as queer, closeted. Sufjan can't admit that he doesn't *just* loves this dude like a brother; he loves him like his *love*. Such complex feelings will only plague him more and more as this album goes on, and as he's forced to confront his sexuality. Words ARE futile devices, no?

=====

steelstepladder: **b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): beautiful opener, and a fake reassurance that the old Sufjan is still here before you get dropped into the chaos of the rest of the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Lmao this is misleading as hell as an opener but also IT’S SO PRETTY.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): So this song wound up growing on me. Initally, I liked the lyrics but thought maybe the sound was a bit too tepid. But after a few listens and reading through the lyrics, I've come to enjoy it. It's soft and unassuming, but I like the very gentle twist in the lyrics. It starts with Sufjan sweetly mesmerized by his lover, and the simple moments they share together. Then, without warning, he pivots to "And I won't stay very long". I like how quietly tortured it is, that's one of my favorite vibes. Glad I sat with it a bit longer.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (9): the last line in this song is a subtle hint that in the following song Sufjan is not going to try very hard with the lyrics

**IdiotBox01** (9): this will probably beat impossible soul but it doesn't deserve to

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is pretty

**IIIHenryIII** (9): especially when it comes to most of your music

**moonagenightmares** (9): the cmbyn remix is superior i fear, more ethereal

**runaway3212** (9): imagine being in love with your best friend, that only happend to me only three times

**modulum83** (8.7): i already give this album propos for not starting with a Orchestral Intro

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This sounds like the title of a manga series that’s run for twenty years in Japan but fortunately it is much more accessible and cute than that

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): as more of an acoustic sufstan i must admit this is more to my taste than a lot of this album. as impressive as the more heavily produced stuff can be I’ve always preferred this sound on him

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): This is highkey the least fitting song on the record but it's SOOOO Sufjans that I really shouldn't be surprised... if anything I am kinda surprised by how nice and lowkey this song is compared to something like his stuff off of Carrie and Lowell

**AHSWeeknd** (8): “I think of you as my brother” Taylor Swift in Call It What You Want

**ChidiArianaGrande** (8): I hated this song first time I heard it and have raised it 1 point ever relisten

**J\_Toe** (8): this is nice, even if I wouldn't regularly listen to it

**nt96** (8): Pretty strummy strummy guitar song. Never been done before.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Nice to hear a song more akin to a pre-Adz Sufjan song real quick before dude goes full space robot

**Blisterman** (7): A sweet piano driven intro.

**Uberpigeon** (6): this is a sufjan song

**Awkward\_King** (5): i dont think this being one of the more stripped back songs on the album is bad i just find the ones where there is more going on more enjoyable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): those little plucking noises that keep popping up in the instrumental are so grating

**2dina3dworld** (10): this probably did better than it did in the Charity rate.

---

**akanewasright** (10): oh right this was in charity rate! I wonder if it’ll do as well here, it deserves

**apatel27** (10): smooth and perfect vocals

**Awkward\_King** (10): it is just so lovely

**Blisterman** (10): Always get chills the moment she launches into “Suffering in sinking sand…”

**CrimsonROSET** (10): who knew in a rate with sufjan stevens janelle would make the christian bop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Well, NOW I'm transcending!!!! This is a SERIOUS 11 contender and a deep cut that NEEDS more love in this world. To me, this song is like half a Beatles ballad and then kicks into a Marvin Gaye torch song in the chorus. And it's sublime the whole time through! Janelle's quiet, lower register at the beginning is so tender and heartbreaking. And the lyrics are so delicate.

**IdiotBox01** (10): this one was genuinely amazing

**Leixander** (10): perhaps the most beautiful song ever

**mudkip1** (10): I’ve been in love with this track for so long. very calming and chill vibes but I always get this strange sense of dread in it too

**musical\_pyn** (10): probably my 11 contender for this album

**RandomHypnotca** (10): I heard this in the charity rate before, and my opinion of it has only grown over time, it's a gorgeous song

**ReallyCreative** (10): come on vo-kills

**runaway3212** (10): This has grown off me a little bit

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this is gorgeous

**throwaway7650** (10): I really hope this can make day 3, it's simply a beautiful song

**waluigiest** (10): queer high concept Beatles

**welcome2thejam** (10): That chorus is gorgeous as hell, Janelle's killing it there

**seanderlust** (9.5): this is so theatrical and really showcases janelle's vocal range very well. i'm glad we get to rate this one again

**stryxen** (9.5): yes this was robbed in charity rate, yes im giving this a lower score now than i did then, and no i cannot explain that

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): This song fucking went off in the chorus, as usual Janelle's vocals just continue to serve - hard to hate anything about this song at all. Any criticism? Probably the outro

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): help why does the beginning of this song remind me of octopus's garden

**celladonn** (9): This just has such a pretty vibe

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): OMG color theory

**TiltControls** (9): grown off me a bit since the last time we've rated it, but still really good

**Uberpigeon** (9): this is a debimbofied version of femmebot by charli

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): I didn’t expect this to end up being one of my faves from the album but it was just SO good

**austrosinitic** (8.5): One of those rare songs that has a pop melody that's so simple yet so beautiful that it becomes an instant classic to the ears of gays and boomers alike (no boomers probably do not listen to Janelle Monae but come on this sounds very oldies radio). Most of my pretentious theological analysis for this rate is reserved for Sufjan but independent of the story this album has I love how this is essentially a slightly queer-ified remake of the spiritual slash erotic dynamics of Song of Songs

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): this started out so great, but the chorus is a bit of a letdown, and the outro is just completely disappointing

**1998tweety** (8): pretty

**AHSWeeknd** (8): That outro is worth mentioning.

**fadedblue09** (8): Love how this starts off as subtle while displaying her vocal range

**frogaranaman** (8): this rate's getting me thirsty for daddy Jesus I guess

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i like this song but the beginning of it always reminds me of octopus’s garden so i have to take a point off for reminding me the beatles exist

**UselessTacooo** (8): it’s cute in the best way possible.

**vayyiqra** (8): This song is very pretty, but around here Suite II begins to drop off a bit. At this point I start to wonder where the plot is going. Still a good song though.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): I mostly like the beat to this but it got just a little grating towards the end.

**Qwilphish** (7.5): I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would from the intro. Its a massive vibe, but the outro is a bit long

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): it's pretty enough ig

**cremeebrulee** (7): i definitely enjoy this more in the context of this album than i did in charity rate. still as sweet as it is, it's far from my fave on here

**J\_Toe** (6): sounds like The Beatles

**2dina3dworld** (10): THIS IS THE AGE OF ART

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): he really put his whole sufjussy into this one and it SHOWS

**moonagenightmares** (11): THIS IS. THE AGE. OF ADZ. ETERNAL LIVIIIIIIIIIIINGGGGGG

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Production snapped

**apatel27** (10): Please be happy Sufjan

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song sounds drunk in the best possible way.

**cremeebrulee** (10): “when it dies, when it dies, it rots” is such a catchy hook for how morbid it is lmao💀 i love the grand, sweeping sound of this, genuinely an 11 contender for me.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this would be a lovely winner

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I was like....built to love this song. From having to learn about Brecht musicals in college to the fact that my dad's passion is classical music. The opening is sharp and makes me think of the atonal Brecht musicals with stilted group chorals. And then the song blossoms into this magpie of sounds that tumble under Sufjan's singing. Honestly, it just works for me. It's a dramatic song that's both catchy and experimental, busy yet stark. It's strong concept to the song structure, where the lyrics make it sound like a harsh religious chant. And the lyrics about grand concepts of life, death and action are just as striking. I'm all in. It's a striking concept with strong attention to detail and an album highlight for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): LOVE IT when a song just full on sounds like a haunted Fleischer cartoon

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): okay my comments for the rest of this album are gonna be really #cringe now but the lyric “i’ve lost the will to fight / i was not made for life” has had such a profound effect on me that i should really bill sufjan for my therapy

**mudkip1** (10): GOD this album is so all over the place but I’m obsessed. It doesn’t even FEEL 8 minutes long. The chorus is so GRAND!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): this is the age of yass

**Qwilphish** (10): A celebration! I love the horns, Christmas bells, and overall grandness of the entire production. Stevens's vocals are also amazing here. When it slows down, it gets downright beautiful - it reminds me of something out of a movie.

**RandomHypnotca** (10): In this comment section, you will find people saying things that don't actually rhyme with Adz

**ReallyCreative** (10): the brass! the beeps and the boops! the acoustic section!! the existential dread!!!

**runaway3212** (10): beautiful, amazing, fuck capitalism, gravy

**stryxen** (10): i love when he says owo in the intro

**stsangie** (10): owo

**thedoctordances1940** (10): idk why but this has always given me willy wonka vibes

**UselessTacooo** (10): It sounds like a song someone on star wars would walk out to, but drugged.

**waluigiest** (10): I tried to start this rate when I was high. This song started and I had a truly transformative experience. I feel like I can’t even explain the extent to which every piece of this song fits together in a delirious storm of pain. Everything about this song is extreme and beautiful. The intro cacophony honestly evokes a deep woundedness. And the twisted disjointed melodies throughout the song are haunting. At any given point there are 3 complete, independent musical ideas happening like a choral round.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the age of YASS, eternal SLAYING!

**akanewasright** (9.9): Disney chaos

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): depression in one song

**nt96** (9.5): THE TRUMPETS, THE FLUTES, THE CHOIR, EVERYTHINGS SO INTENSE AND CACOPHONOUS. IM LIVING.

**throwaway7650** (9.5): he's right, it's giving... the far superior title track in the rate

**austrosinitic** (9): Sometimes I think I've been a whiny baby listening to this song. Waah, the undisciplined austrosinitic may have said to himself when he was just getting into Sufjan, why is this eight minutes long? I don't understand the symbolism of 'when the earth was split in fives'! I want to get to the poppier songs on this record! Fortunately, at the time I'm writing this I realize just how beautiful of a ballad this is. The orchestral stylings of Sufjan's earlier music are transformed here into an epic existential crisis, and we also get our first full introduction here to the recurring theme of this album of being caught in between life and death (yet another parallel to T.S Eliot and The Waste Land, which I talked about in my comment for Too Much, a song that has HOPEFULLY not gone out yet). This also brings the theological dilemma Sufjan faces regarding his queerness and his attraction to his male friebd into the forefront. I think that the lyrics to this song contain one of the best arguments for a same-sex 'intruder' coming into Sufjan's life and relationship with a woman — specifically, in the line 'well I have known you for just a little while'. Why would he say that about somebody he's already in a relationship with? And, thus, a full portrait of the temptation Sufjan experiences upon getting to know this hypothetical male friend and getting closer and closer to him is unravelled in the Age of Adz's title track. I explain the tension between life and death here from a queer paradigm as follows: Christianity, in its mainstream, conservative form, will tell you that being queer is a sin, and that it is spiritual death. Fuck that. This is alluded to in the line "I would see you die" (curiously, a mention of a 'her' follows, which once again essentially established that there are three personas here and that only one, who is out of the question in this specific song, is female). But Sufjan also asks here: why is this attraction to another man making him feel ALIVE? The realization that he can't suppress his love for this man and simply call him his brother anymore comes down crashing on him in spite of his self hatred: "I've lost the will to fight/I was not made for life". As he accepts this, he still fears that he and his new lover are damned: "Are we the lost of the lost?". He even apologizes to him at the end, something I've seen queer people brainwashed by religion do to their former partners. Its heartbreaking, but at least Sufjan is starting to get a hint here that the truth he feels when he experiences this love for this man is closer to the REAL truth that will set him free — the truth that involves him accepting that he, as a queer person, is fearfully and wonderfully made, and that it is only through accepting his love that he will be able to liberate himself from our fallen, patriarchal, heteronormative world. "This is the Age of Adz/Eternal living!"

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): ETERNAL LIVING!

**frogaranaman** (9): it's called the Age of Adz because it's Adz how this will be robbed in this day and Age

**TiltControls** (9): the DRAMA of this song

**Uberpigeon** (9): this is like that scene from the movie robots where its like the undrground workshop with the red lady with the lips where they mash up all the broken robots with a hammer this is that scene but its turned into a folk song

**vayyiqra** (9): Oh boy. This song is like the final boss when it comes to interpreting the lyrics on this densely written album. Despite having listened to this album close to 50 times and having read the lyrics a bunch of times I still am not sure what the fuck Adz even is, and it seems even Sufjan isn't quite sure either. He got the name from the writing of Royal Robertson, who had a severe case of schizophrenia and one symptom of that is oddities in language use. It seems to be a word Royal made up himself which might come from "odds". The annotations on Genius.com are not helpful since they talk about mythical vampires and weird shit like that, so I guess they were just as confused as we are. Anyway, we don't need to talk too much about what exactly the age of Adz is right now, though I have a vague feeling that it's ambiguously dystopian. One reading of this song I like is that this song was influenced by Sufjan's poor health at the time which would explain the references to death and decay on this song and the lines about not being made for life. I could also try to get all theological about how he sings about "Gloria" which is a Latin word that has strong Christian overtones, but I'll hold off on that because it might be a reach and probably nobody cares. Anyway, notice here Sufjan brings up in the outro his feelings about being selfish which show up later in "All to Myself" and "Impossible Soul". Foreshadowing!

steelstepladder: **welcome2thejam** (9): Favorite moments in this song: the loudness of the chorus dropping for the second verse, and the oddly triumphant horns after "when it dies it rots"

**fadedblue09** (8): Feels like it's the opening...to something. Not sure what it is though cuz the album just goes awry from here

**slimboyfriend** (8): This is the first time in the album where I think Sufjan definitely turns into a little drama queen and lets his Cancer sun and Aries moon OUT

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I can’t unhear the… sonic the hedgehog sounds

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): I swear to God this record finna sound like BJ Burton produced a Disney musical and this is the villain song. If only I knew what the fuck this song was about when he says it's the Age of Adz/Odds (???)

**modulum83** (7.5): this song gives me time cube vibes

**seanderlust** (7.1): for all the critiques of this album being cacophanous, i think this is the track that that is a fair critique. it resolves later in the track but the high-pitched violins in the beginning can be grating, and i'm not entirely convinced this song earns its eight minute run time. that said, for anyone tanking this song, i encourage you to give it a few more listens. this one grew on me over time majorly (even during this rate even though i was already familiar with AoA - my first take score was like a 4 :sob:)

**Blisterman** (7): So, I discover on this track, it's pronounced "odds", and not actually about advertising?

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): so this album definitely is supposed to be ambitious and have detailed production I guess but I just don’t think it works as well as intended. I like this more than the previous song but everything feels so mismatched except when Sufjan is in his wheelhouse at the end

**J\_Toe** (4): a little antagonistic to listen to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this song is 8 minutes long and yet it somehow feels longer than impossible soul

Yes I know 55 unstable twinks, they/thems, and insomniacs gave IS their 11, no it doesn't matter because statistically giving a low score is more significant than giving an 11 and we have quite a few people this rate who have demonstrated a lack of taste!

**J\_Toe** (10): one of the highlights of Janelle's discography

**2dina3dworld** (10): Big Boi is a Kate Bush stan, and therefore this song is good. But seriously, this was the first Janelle song I knew, when I was a little kid playing Just Dance 3. So really, it holds a special place in my heart.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Sonically this doesn’t fit in with the rest of the album at all, but it’s such a bop and I’m glad people discovered Janelle through this song

**J\_Toe** (11): so catchy and so danceable and I love the Afrofuturist themes in the music video. Dance is technology!

**rotating3Dtext** (11): this is the song that first made me love her voice, delivery, songwriting, everything

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): went on a constant back and forth between this and cold war on what to give my 11 to but this narrowly beat it out. i mean this is just such a joy to listen to. the fact this didnt top the billboard charts for 10+ weeks is proof we have failed as a society.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): This is the ideal pop song. You may not like it, but this is what peak performance looks like.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): never really liked this too much but the arrangement does it for me.

**apatel27** (10): Can't go wrong with funk and Big Boi

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this song fucks

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t think it’s much of a question that this song will be high, not low.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the video for this is amazing too

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I mean also an obvious 11 contender. My exhaustive plays of "Int'l Players Anthem" in high school BUILT me to be a Big Boi stan, first of all. Always ready to jam to "Wuthering Heights" with Big "Kate Bush stan" Boi!!! But yes, a groovy and futuristic funk jam that as a single stands very well without the context of the Cindi Mayweather story. And naturally, Big Boi's verse is smooth self-assurance that's a perfect match to this, considering how many funk samples Outkast had already done at this point. Whew, this album!! And I learned in a behind the scenes interview that they're really singing happy birthday to someone at the end of the song, lol

**fadedblue09** (10): I think this might be the first Janelle song I have ever heard?

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is so fun! This brings me as much joy as Dance Apocalyptic.

**mudkip1** (10): this is gonna win for sure huh

**plastichaxan** (10): the hold she has that she can make incredible songs in every genre, mood or style possible she’s just amazing

**Qwilphish** (10): If this song doesn't make you want to dance then... what is wrong with you. Whether you're high or low, get into it

**ReallyCreative** (10): I just think that Janelle Monae

**skargardin** (10): one of Janelle's best no doubt

**slimboyfriend** (10): This is the perfect single from the album because out of context it's just a fun song to dance to, but within the album it's about navigating life as a person with a marginalized identity

**TiltControls** (10): Probably one of the most straightforward tracks on the album (and in the rate), but it's a bop so it all works

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes, this song was everywhere, and is the best-known song from the album. Does that make it bad? Hell no. This fucks. God I love horns.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Both this and Cold War have incredible intros that instantly bring the energy. In Tightrope's case, it's getting you ready for a song that's impossible not to move & groove to. Also, I don't really know the lore of the overall story, but I choose to believe Big Boi is playing himself and you can't tell me differently

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): Yeah it’s the basic pop track on the album, but wouldn’t the world be so much better if this was a huge hit so we could ACTUALLY call it basic pop??

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this goes so hard and it’s so fun...just love it

**seanderlust** (9.4): ladies and gentlemen, the funkiest song in The Archandroid

**1998tweety** (9): BOP

**frogaranaman** (9): I can't even walk in a straight line on solid ground

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I’m just thinking about how many people have heard Janelle say “ladies and gentlemen, the funkiest horn section in Metropolis” and just think it’s a random little ad lib in a pop song instead of an allusion to an elaborate Afro-futurist alternate universe inspired by Fritz Lang’s *Metropolis* that Janelle spent two+ albums developing. I can’t say I’m surprised that this was the big pop hit from the album because the wacky sound and old school “singing about choreography” lyrics helped people really make sense of Janelle’s distinctive visuals and unique persona, plus it’s probably the least linked to the Cyndi Mayweather lore which the public clearly never had an interest in and just kinda acted as a barrier to entry to her music. Also it slaps.

**modulum83** (9): big boi kinda ate this verse

**waluigiest** (9): an incredible, feel-good single. I feel like it doesn’t really fit in with the album.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): a bop but maybe slightly overrated

**austrosinitic** (8.5): Huh this is one of her bolded releases on RYM and while I think something is preventing me from really being in love with it — I think it's probably how the melody is modelled after, like, the limbo dance or shit, which it does well although it's at the cost of sounding annoyingly like Elvis (WORST MUSICIAN OF ALL TIME!) — I can't really prevent getting lost in Janelle's energy here, either, nor loving it when Big Boi comes in because 2010 was *his* year (at least he had the decency to release a solo album Andre where is yours)

**throwaway7650** (8.5): this grew off me over the years I fear. solo ver. >>>

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I’m a big fan of the old school vibes littered throughout the song. The Big Boi verse isn’t that great but it’s my only issue with the track.

**akanewasright** (7): this is fine but I never loved it as much as a lot of the other hyped Janelle songs. Will feel a bit weird if it wins.

**Awkward\_King** (7): i think i have made peace with this winning because it is very good, i just think it is predictable and i would rather over winners, but janelle deserves

**ChidiArianaGrande** (7): I have a different opinion on this song everyday

**stryxen** (7): the funkiest horn section in metropolis omg is that city pop

**Blisterman** (6): Despite being a hit and featuring one of my all time favourite artists, I always considered this one of the weaker tracks on the album.

**nt96** (5): After hearing this in commercials, I cant help but feel like this cheapen the song a little. Nowadays it's giving me Old Navy vibes sadly.

**wavingwolves** (5): makes me feel like i'm living inside a tv commercial

**runaway3212** (4): this is like kinda bad

**Uberpigeon** (2): im sorry i just find this song really repetitive and annoying and boring. also janelle im sorry but you cant convince me this has a single THING to do with robots from the future

**2dina3dworld** (10): Sufjan’s ode to mental pain, chronic pain and loneliness touched a chord in a lot of you. Me, as well. Such a sad, painful song that is up there with Mitski levels of music-induced sadness (for me, at least). This totally deserves it’s placement.

---

**DefaultPophead** (11): The “I’m not fucking around” part just really gets to me.

**RandomHypnotca** (11): When I first heard this song, I was a huge fan of Illinoise and C&L, but hadn't really listened to any of his other stuff, and I actually was exposed to this song in some meme video, that had the "I'm not fucking around" part, and I was SHOCKED to hear my dear sweet meow meow Sufjan swearing like that, and going so hard as well. I immediately listened to the song, and was absolutely hooked. This felt so immediately raw and chaotic and energetic in a way that I hadn't experienced from Suf before, and at the time, I was also dealing with some really bad physical side effects of anxiety that were making me sick constantly, so it was a case of the song coming to me at the exact right point in my life.

**seanderlust** (11): mister sufjan said the f word!!!

**akanewasright** (10): When he said “I want to be well” I felt that, but when he said “I’m not fucking around”??? I understood that in my soul.

**apatel27** (10): 😢

**Awkward\_King** (10): no bc i dont like how hard this is hitting rn

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): he's not fucking around

**BeauMeringue212** (10): love the production on this, there's a lot going on but it all works very well together and reflects the sense of turmoil in the lyrics

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): If you haven’t screamed along to the last few minutes of this song while driving home from your family Thanksgiving - have you really lived?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): he is NOT fucking around

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Another indietronic banger, that starts off with the flourishing and racing woodwinds and choral vocals Lyrically, I really resonate with the allusions to chronic illness in this song, as a lot of this album was spurred by Sufjan's mysterious nervous system illness. I've had two big medical issues this year so I can relate to feeling out of control of your own body, the disconnect and how you vacillate from malaise to desperation. And the IMNOTFUCKINGAROUNDDD repeated shout in the end. It's giving 00s indie love of group chanting (outsold the Arcade Fire) and I'm here for it. For a song grappling with chronic body pain, I think the cathartic, goofy and is well-earned.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): who can relate?

**Leixander** (10): i'm not fucking around, well i want to be

**modulum83** (10): I'M NOT FUCKING AROUND

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): TOP 3 ON THE ALBUM BABY...honestly easily an 11 contender too. slightly embarrassing but i basically always cry at the “I WANT TO BE WELL” chanting section of this song lol even though i’ve been listening to it for years - obviously this was written about when sufjan had a mysterious illness but i think a person with any type of illness (mental or physical) can relate to it...hence the tears. (also sidenote i love the...impact(?) this song has because sufjan rarely swears in his music so the fact he does it so many times here is a big :omg: moment. he really isn’t fucking around!)

**mudkip1** (10): fantastique

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is one of the most cathartic songs I have ever listened to, and one of my 11 contenders

**nt96** (10): When Sufjan says he's not fucking around, he means it!

**plastichaxan** (10): i wonder how many variations of people agreeing with the song title we’ll get

**Qwilphish** (10): A masterpiece on illness and healing. The background vocals and multiple repeating lyrical sections (Well, I want to be; Im not fucking around; etc.) add to the message of the song in such a cool way.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I don't think he's fucking around y'all

**rotating3Dtext** (10): I’m not fucking around

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I got into this song as I was going though the worst physical pain of my life, and now that this has passed, it has become a mantra for my mental health. Thanks for the free therapy, Sufjan!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): everyone that give song a low score is the reason why sufjan is fucking around.

**skargardin** (10): fucking mood

**stryxen** (10): the fact that the album could have ended here and this would have been the best album closer of all time and then he did impossible soul instead wow

**stsangie** (10): guies he sayed the f word D:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the catharticness of that ending…

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I do have some slight tiny problems with this song, mainly the vocal mixing at the beginning of the song, but the outro more than makes up for that, it's a truly transcendental moment

**vayyiqra** (10): This song speaks to me. I'm a disabled person - I have ADHD, depression, and hearing problems, as well as a neck injury that often causes me pain - and I've always had a strong interest in medically-related topics. Neurology especially fascinates me a lot - I learned a lot about it in college where I studied health biology. Sufjan's mysterious illness that inspired a lot of this album sounded truly awful, and it affected his whole body. Neurological diseases are often cursed because they are very hard to cure, and in his case it wasn't even known what disease it was. I can see why here he said "I would rather be dead" at the time. Anyway, all this makes this song such an incredible mood, and I really feel it when he says "I want to be well" as a mantra like forty times. aaaauuughghg I'm not fuckin around aaaaughghhgghh

**waluigiest** (10): so intensely personal yet universally cathartic

**wavingwolves** (10): me too

**welcome2thejam** (10): If it was just the first third, it'd already be incredible, but once we hit that first "I want to be well" it starts evolving into a true top-tier track. It's 2AM as I type this and I'm trying my hardest to not scream "I'm not fucking around." Top five Sufjan song and my favorite from Adz.

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): i don’t think he’s fucking around

**austrosinitic** (9.5): I'M NOT FUCKING AROUND! The more I've looked into the background of this album, specifically into Sufjan's mysterious chronic illness and into Royal Robertson's schizophrenia, the more I'm interested in how disability is just as much of a reality in this album for Sufjan as queerness is, although I wouldn't go as so far as to say that the entire narrative of Age of Adz is about disability itself. I'd argue that no song captures this element of the album more than I Want To Be Well, and that the perspective Sufjan gives onto his mysterious 'illness' here — which I believe he's turned into a metaphor for his love and romantic yearning here, as seen in his address towards a specific 'you' — holds parallels to what St. Paul describes in his epistles as a 'thorn in his flesh'. What he was referring to is just as much of a mystery as Sufjan's illness (hence the parallels) but it has the potential to be physical as well as spiritual. In Sufjan's case, this thorn that's causing him so much physiological angst could very well be his queerness — something would imply the existence of his lingering internalized homophobia, even after he's consumated his love for his male friend in All For Myself. It's interesting how disability and queerness get combined here in that particular sense, and this interpretation would be also further backed up by the otherwise strange passage in the middle of the song that goes 'I forgive you even as you choke me that way' — a statement that's also very erotic in a sense. There's a love pushing Sufjan to the edge of death that makes him yearn for peace, and once again, we cannot tell if it's a woman or a man which he's addressing. Either way I believe this is the climax before he finally spits the truth of his sexuality out, making the intensity of his illness even more severe, which explains the frantic way he exclaims 'I want to be well, I want to be well!' over pulsating beats that certify this as one of the best and most underrated songs on Age of Adz. Deep, right? I'm so glad I'm almost done with these comments holy shit I'm sorry everyone

**2dina3dworld** (10): Disclaimer: I’m not planning on dying for another 50 years or however long I take to die naturally. But goddamn, I want this to play at my funeral, it just has *those* vibes. The whole dreamy, ethereal promise of what could be and what has been, the quiet resignation to your fate, and the romanticisation of being alone together and being someone else’s rock all tackle an itch in my brain. Also, whenever the bell at the end dongs for the last time, I feel this cathartic sense of release, the release of tension and anxiety and trauma and what have you. In a way, it’s incredibly therapeutic, in the same way that most forms of art are. It’s a form of release, a form of venting, a way to express you, and your problems and to turn it into something that invokes all of those emotions that you’ve been holding in, and to let you process and express them.

---

**IdiotBox01** (11): what it felt like when Gordo finally got that kiss at the end of The Lizzie McGuire Movie

**IIIHenryIII** (11): I really don’t get why people who don’t make pop music tend to create some of the best pop songs ever

**jackisboredtoday** (11): its the smasha. I doubt it will happen but Gorillaz rate winners would be such a moment

**nootnoot781** (11): one of the most beautiful songs i’ve ever heard

**TiltControls** (11): sorry Sufjanelle Monstevens fans, this is one of my favourite songs of all time so this 11 isn't even close for me

**akanewasright** (10): shut up why am I about to cry during the silly lore album

**apatel27** (10): Anyone that doesn't like this hates the planet

**Awkward\_King** (10): i fear it is the smasha

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this is just wonderful, a really romantic and saddening song

**BeauMeringue212** (10): the sound and lyrics are so dreamy and escapist

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Gorillaz are one of the most unique acts in mainstream music - dipping into numerous genres and collaborating with all kinds of artists. I think the strangeness of their overall discography makes this song, with its straightforwardness and simple beauty, shine even more.

**celladonn** (10): So good

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh we love a 11 magnet

**fadedblue09** (10): Would be my 11 if Janelle wasn't here. Sounds inexplicably poignant and it feels robotic yet human at the same time. If I lived in some parallel dystopian universe, this would probably be my self-help song.

**frogaranaman** (10): "melancholy hill" is just living in rural midwest

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song is so good it belongs on the soundtrack to a Warioware game

**ignitethephoenix** (10): they definitely captured melancholy with this song

**J\_Toe** (10): the song I'm here for

**modulum83** (10): sobs uncontrollably

**moonagenightmares** (10): i cannot imagine what kind of person would give this anything below a 10

**mudkip1** (10): this is very nice

**plastichaxan** (10): classic

**Qwilphish** (10): That bass line is killer. Reminds me of a 70s movie, very nostalgic sounding.

**ReallyCreative** (10): tiktokgirldancingwhilecrying.mp4

**runaway3212** (10): Me 2 bestie

**seanderlust** (10): this is beautifully morose

**stryxen** (10): if damon albarn were a woman this would win with an 11 average

**thedoctordances1940** (10): it's just so fucking amazing

**UselessTacooo** (10): this is a really cute love song that has no place on an album like this, but I don’t care.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Incredibly beautiful and bittersweet sounding song, with the added bonus of Genius letting me know that one of the Gorillaz characters has a canon fear of whales

**austrosinitic** (9.5): Love to have a straight-up pop song in the middle of this record for no narrative reason that is still fucking amazing

**throwaway7650** (9.5): this is just 100 gecs if they existed in the 90s /hj

**RandomHypnotca** (9.2): how far away is Melancholy Hill from Magdalena Bay?

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): This will probably lose to Tightrope or something but if this song gets into the upper echelons of the rate / even wins it, that’s honestly fine with me lol.

**Leixander** (9): has one of the loveliest melodies i've ever heard

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): idk why this makes me feel so :catcry:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.2): This is a lovely, sublime little song. To be honest, looking over the lyrics several times, it's hard for me to fully get sold on the double-meanings or satire of this song. It's a bit too indirect for my tastes, but I can't deny I feel very happy listening to another depressing anti-consumerist bop.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**vayyiqra** (8): This is such a big improvement from the song before it. It's just a nice little synthpop song, kind of sad, nothing groundbreaking but it's a highlight on the album for sure.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The consistent mention of “Plastic” throughout the album is great, it really makes it feel like an album.

**Blisterman** (7): Blissfully chilled.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this has really shrunk on me over the years

**waluigiest** (6): I got so bored I’m sorry

**wavingwolves** (4): i've heard so much about this song before so when i actually listened to it and felt nothing about it i just felt disappointed in myself

**IIIHenryIII** (9.063): I couldn’t care less about the concept, this sounds amazing. The lyrics are literally just a complement to the music. I consider this the best album in the rate even though I’m giving The Age of Adz a higher score.

**ReallyCreative** (8.894): As someone who had long shilled for rates featuring the other two albums in this rate, but with various other third options, I decided to check out this album a few months ago to see what the fuss is about. I was shocked not only at how much I enjoyed it, but at how well it works with the other two albums in this rate. There are a couple speed bumps, but this album is consistently great.

**stryxen** (8.875): i only listened to this for the first time a few months ago and the way it impacted me i can’t describe in words other than pirate jet pirate jet pirate jet pirate jet pirate jet

**stsangie** (8.681): pirate jet

**modulum83** (8.369): an imperfect album that remains one of my favorites of all time

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.313): those Gorillaz nfts don't exist those Gorillaz nfts don't exist those Gorillaz nfts don't exist

**apatel27** (8.281): While there is a massive hypocrisy of Gorillaz putting out NFTs, this album still slaps

**musical\_pyn** (8.250): This was the only album I was unfamiliar with coming into this rate but oh boy did it surprise me! Some weaker tracks, but overall it kept growing on me.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.219): Has some really great highs but there are definitely also things i don't love here, still a brilliant album overall

**AHSWeeknd** (8.188): I mean, wow. I didn’t expect to like this album but it’s honestly great.

**plastichaxan** (8.175): great album, i thought i would like it more but i guess in comparison it feels short, i admit it has some of my favorite Gorillaz songs in general and i’m very glad we got to rate it

**CrimsonROSET** (8.031): I have never been much familiar with Gorillaz other than their big hits + song machine, but consider me pleasantly surprised! Much softer than I expected, but that’s a good thing. The concept is a bit ??? but at the same time its the best in the rate so idk what that says about it

**austrosinitic** (7.969): Gorillaz' whole aesthetic confuses the fuck out of me, trying to make sense of their lore just makes it worse, and I can't tell whether their fans are furries or not, but this is a pretty great album even if I'm not that big on some of the songs (which just goes to prove that the highlights rock) and probably the best produced record of 2010 too so congrats Damon Alburn shoutout to my friend Liv and to Flimsy Steve

**fadedblue09** (7.906): I appreciate how this album paints a picture of a dystopian future, and I like how it spans various sonic influences and not necessarily relying on the generally perceived notion of “futuristic music”. I am personally ambivalent towards its execution of social commentary, and the album really could’ve used more seamless transitions, but still a solid experience.

**ChidiArianaGrande** (7.813): All of these albums are more then the sum of their parts. Especially this one. I like it as a whole a lot more then what my average score is

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.744): So I went into this a Gorillaz casual, knowing their biggest hits since the Feel Good Inc. days. The first few listens of this, my attention was really distracted and it became background music compared to the other two albums. So many of these songs have a smoothness (well, not Sweepstakes, lol) and Damon's subdued vocals can really make my mind wander, even when I know the lyrics are probably cutting. So sitting down to read through the lyrics, and listening to this on a walk has helped me appreciate the highlights of this album. The start of the album bangs for me, with some of Damon's best and evocative writing. And the features like Bashy and Kano are great for me as well. Some of the low points for me sound like stock Gorillaz or the total experiment-fail of Sweepstakes. And again, reading through the lyrics made me appreciate Damon's knack for a turn of phrase over some upbeat, sweet music. Good to have experienced the depths of this album!

**sirpancakeXI** (7.375): This album really have some very strong songs but are sadly accompanied by many middle of the road songs that are not exactly standouts.

**xxipil0ts** (7.344): Baffling how this production has not aged like milk. Although, some of the songs are a hit or miss.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.250): This record is hard. Now I get why Fantano took a decade to bump this album up by 2 points; it’s not even that experimental but every track here just registers so much more differently from the last time I listened to it. There are some good tracks here especially in the first half but it starts to wear out it’s welcome and the songwriting starts to lose ideas. Not to mention Superfast Jellyfish SUCKSSS. I’m sure most of popheads will trash this record save stuff like On Melancholy Hill, which would be tragic as hell. At the same time I wouldn’t be surprised if this record got hard shafted.

**cremeebrulee** (7.206): a lot of music written about the climate crisis feels a bit flat and underwhelming to me, so i can't say that any of these songs impressed me from a /conceptual/ point of view but i will say was a pleasant listen sonically.

**Leixander** (7.031): like this album a lot but the other two albums in this rate are just on another level for me. has a few songs i like to revisit from time to time, while for the other two i just listen from start to end with a skip or two at most

**welcome2thejam** (6.938): I treated this rate as a Sufjan, Cold War, & Tightrope rate, but Gorillaz definitely held their own! Some great beats and stellar production.

**skargardin** (6.875): I was surprised that an album that contains some of my favourite songs, that being Rhinestone Eyes and On Melancholy Hill, didn't resonate with me more. I've tried giving it a couple listens but some songs just don't do it for me at all. Still, I'm really into the overall concept of it.

**BeauMeringue212** (6.844): I enjoyed this album more than I thought I would. Some great vibey melancholy tracks, and I like the artificial world theme, but it got a bit flat toward the end

**Callum1245** (6.750): 7

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.625): i have mixed feelings towards this album and gorillaz in general nowadays. back in 2017 when they released humanz i became obsessed with them and for about a year they were my absolute favorite band and was basically all i listened to in that time period. and then one day i…suddenly felt nothing towards their music anymore. and for the most part i havent listened to a single song from them since. despite all that, i do still have nostalgia for plastic beach since it was always my favorite album by them and after revisiting it, while a lot of it doesnt hold up as well as i remember it is still a very solid album throughout. too bad gorillaz destroyed any impact the album concept had by selling nfts anyway

**waluigiest** (6.500): I really tried to like this album. I hated it the first two listens. By the third, I came around to an appreciation but no sort of affection. I can’t get into the stories they create, and I think a lot of tracks are super corny. Empire Ants is a gem tho. One of the best songs in the rate for sure.

**UselessTacooo** (6.469): Well this was a shocker. I went in to this having no clue about the album, and hated almost everything while listening, but in the end I actually came out enjoying most of the album. It’s really interesting, and it does a good job of making you think. Definitely will come back to this album in the future.

**Blisterman** (6.438): Some incredible highlights on this. But listening to it over a decade later, there’s a lot more filler than I remembered.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.031): yeahhh you can tell by my averages that i def like this album way less than the archandroid and age of adz

steelstepladder: **vayyiqra** (5.938): Well. Good news, everyone! I didn't hate this album! See, I've always had this irrational dislike for Gorillaz. As a kid I liked Blur's "Song 2" (still goes off, banger) but not them and could hardly believe they had the same guy behind them. Frankly I always thought they were dumb: their name was dumb, their art style was dumb (and ugly, which I still feel ngl), and their lore was dumb. They seemed like a more British and goofier bargain-bin version of Daft Punk, and I love Daft Punk, so why would I listen to a worse knockoff of them? I know this is irrational, but couldn't get past it. Now that I have been forced to listen to a whole album of theirs (more than once, even) I can see why they get so much acclaim. This is still my least favourite album in the rate, but given this rate is "two of my favourite albums of all time and also Gorillaz", my score isn't bad. It could have been much worse. I could have trashed it like 1000 Gecs. Instead it converted me from a Gorillaz hater to a ... I guess I'm lukewarm on them now. They're okay. I don't mind them. Having said that, I wish I'd given myself more time with this album and let it grow on me a bit more, and maybe delved into its backstory more, but it's not my fault their lore is bafflingly complicated, so whatever. At least they stuck to the concept throughout the album, which most concept albums are pretty bad at, so credit for that alone.

**J\_Toe** (5.563): I admittedly tried to do this rate a few weeks ago but didn't have the time. So this is attempt 2, and I'm appreciating this album a lot more.

**mudkip1** (5.188): well it’s a cute 5 out of 10. I don’t think I’d revisit anything from this album. Just not for me unfortunately

**nt96** (4.875): I'll admit that even I was surprised about the average when I calculated it lol! I wasn't exactly wowed by the content and some songs like Glitter Freeze had the synths that annoyed me to point I kinda got infuriated which is rare, hence the 0. On Melancholy Hill was pretty nice to listen to, but To Binge is my favorite song on the album since it felt very soothing for me. I kinda hope it makes it to day 3 but we'll have to wait and see. While Age of Adz was equally over the top, there was a sense of consistency that I could follow, it's kinda hard to explain. Maybe it's lyricism that clicked for me? Not sure. ArchAndroid didn't have that over the top sound, but my God was I in love lol. For what it's worth, I can almost guarantee that I'm in the minority here with the average. I think it's best to leave it as it is, I'm certain there will be many more positive scores and 11s to even it out.Plastic Beach was just not it for me sadly.

**2dina3dworld** (10): art. ART of the highest order. I have the attention span of a goldfish and this was able to hold me rapt at least three times. If that’s not a testament to how good it is, I don’t know what is.

---

**akanewasright** (11): god this is just. Every kind of incredible? Like every part of this song is good and meaningful and enjoyable, like yeah there’s a lot going on, it’s 25 minutes, but like… “BOY WE CAN DO MUCH MORE TOGETHER”

**austrosinitic** (11): Woah, I can't believe it's the best fucking song of all time and the epic conclusion to the saga of Age of Adz, where Sufjan finally has to confront that he likes other dudes!! Here it is! There's no option for me but to pick it apart from top to bottom! (Heh, top to bottom.) Most of this song is obviously a conversation between Sufjan and a woman, perhaps bar the lines 'boy, we can do much more together', which some people think is uttered by the woman. And I say fair enough; truthfully, I can accept a reading of this album that involves Sufjan learning that he's ace, not that he's gay. I respect it; however, that's now how I project onto — I mean, interpret this song. If it's a woman singing 'boy, we can do much more together', then, pray tell, what the fuck is the point of the female voice in the middle if Sufjan is just going to allow himself to sing from the woman's perspective? I think it's him singing those lines. And I think it's him singing them to another man, the one he denied his love for earlier on in this album's narrative. The only thing that challenges me is him saying 'woman, promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes' in the first line, but given all the evidence that points in the other direction, who can just say it doesn't simply mean  that Sufjan is asking her to stay to listen to him, instead of storming out on him? Or that this first part isn't him trying to stay with this woman for one last time? The way he opens the song certainly sounds like an explanation on the dawn of epiphany — 'woman, you are the lover of my impossible soul' is Sufjan's declaration, and I think what makes his soul impossible for her to love is...well...his queerness and his presumable interest in men alone. 'I would sing all my life to you if I could get you at all' once again links sexual sterility to silence. He talks about chasing after something that was gone — again, this could be a reference to the male lover and a final display of internalized homophobia from Sufjan, which wouldn't explain much. Or he could have been chasing after compulsory heterosexuality, which he can also no longer abide by. It depends if you see this part as a confession to win back the woman or to intentionally close a chapter on. But my favorite part of this section where Sufjan initially sings is the lines 'All I want is the perfect love [..] want love for us all'. What is 'the' perfect love? 1 John 4:18: There is no fear in love, for perfect love drives out fear. BOOM. THE PERFECT LOVE FOR SUFJAN IS THE LOVE THAT WILL STOP HIM FROM BEING SO SCARED OF HIMSELF. OF BEING GAY. And I can nearly say with certainty that the biblical allusion here isn't a coincidence, because look at what the female voice, the woman sings next: 'Do you want to be afraid? [...] Do you want to love me more? [...] The scariest things are not half as enslaved [...] Have you failed to feel delight? Instead of the love lived tired and lost/where it floundered its death/with the language of ghosts [...] Don't be distracted [...]' Her words call back to Get Real, Get Right, and fits in perfectly with Sufjan's paranoia in that song, which I believe was caused by, you fucking guessed it, his queerness. And it is through this section and these words that I believe Sufjan realizes he cannot go on pretending he can give his full romantic love to this woman. The only way he can love her more, along with other people more, including his male lover, including *himself*, is to drive out that fear that has been haunting him throughout this entire album. And so his queerness explicitly resurfaces as the song switches up: 'Stupid man in the window, I couldn't be at rest…now I know it wasn't safe...to breathe at all...' To breathe is to live. And Sufjan now realizes that by living a lie, he has been dead. Now, all of a sudden, there's a '1! 2! 3!' and, voila, he comes back to life. 'It's a long life, only one last chance, couldn't get much better, do you wanna dance?' and then, a glorious, triumphant 'BOY, WE COULD DO MUCH MORE TOGETHER, IT'S NOT SO IMPOSSIBLE!'. He's finally done it! Our boy has finally done it! He's going back to his man! He's accepted he's gay! And the most heartwarming thing about this is that through doing this, he makes a proclamation that makes him realize his soul is worthy of love and redemption: 'It's not so possible!' (I also want to reiterate that I don't think this is about Sufjan as a real person, just the character or version of himself he plays on this album). If you read this song and album about coming out, it's just a wonderful, wonderful feeling to finally see Sufjan exclaim this, because we've all been there too, where we finally admitted to ourselves that we were queer and that we liked it after denying ourselves for so long, and where we experienced the same cathrasis that the music here so beautifully conveys right now. This is the perfect love; the truth of your queerness sets you free. The outro is still a little tragic: Sufjan apologizes to his former female lover one last time as he leaves, saying 'I never meant to cause you pain/my burden is the weight of a feather'. So he's finally accepted that being queer is not a problem or a burden, but he still feels guilty: 'I'm nothing but a selfish man/I'm nothing but a privileged brother. And did you think I'd stay the night/and did you think I'd love you forever?'. The woman even feels guilty about it too: she tries to repeat the 'boy, we could do much more together' refrain, but all Sufjan can say is 'Girl, I want nothing less than pleasure'. Something that heterosexual love can't give him. And that's fine; all is fair in love, and even amidst the joy of being queer there's room for sadness for us along the way as we go through the challenge of coming out. I think the woman understands that. That's why she sung earlier to Sufjan to accept himself. But at the end of it all, at the end of this epic, terrific, wonderful album, it's still haunting how he sings 'Boy, we made such a mess, boy, we made such a mess, boy, we made such a mess together…'

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): this is one of, if not the greatest song of all time. sure, it's pretty lengthy at 25 minutes long but those 25 minutes are all essential as Sufjan lays his soul bare, singing about love, loss, and his inner mind all while it sounds like the world is crumbling around him. this song is an absolute rollercoaster, going from melancholic to absolutely heartbreaking to extremely uplifting, and then finally ending just as the album started, with only an acoustic guitar and Sufjan's beautiful voice, all of the chaotic electronics gone. it suggests that Sufjan has finally overcome his suffering, his pain, and has come out of it a changed man. so yeah, this song is one of the most emotive and moving songs I have ever heard and I agree when people say it is basically a free therapy session. in fact, this whole album is a therapy session.

steelstepladder: **BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): This song making it to Day 3? I really hope it’s NOT SO IMPOSSIBLE.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): I mean, maybe the best song of all time? Not actually but like, there’s an argument out there (probs gucci’s comment) and I’m willing to listen to it, because I don’t think my words can do it justice. It’s a song bigger than life. A song bigger than death. A song bigger than the self, with only one message: life’s not so impossible.

**frogaranaman** (11): some artist's entire discography never even come close to reaching the heights of this song and "Impossible Soul" is maybe, like, Sufjan's sixth best song

**modulum83** (11): i am fighting for my life to see this win

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): honestly the greatest song to ever be made in the history of music

**mudkip1** (11): I have to I have to I have to. It’s perfect it’s stunning it’s magnificent. The way it continuously gets better as it goes along just amazes me every time. Taylor Swift could simply never. Some of our fave pop girlies release entire ALBUMS that are as long as this song and none of them ever reach the same heights.

**musical\_pyn** (11): this might be the easiest 11 I have ever given, it almost doesn't feel fair to compare it to other songs in this rate because it's so different in scope and scale, it's pretty much an EP on its own

**plastichaxan** (11): this was laced, how is there no way i want to skip a 25 minute song? that i enjoy every second of it and just get transported out of my body for 25 minutes god i love this man so much this is one of the hardest decisions i've ever made cause this rate is one of my favorites ever and i had so many 11 options aaaaaaaaaaa

**ReallyCreative** (11): this song is the most extreme form of that one meme where the girl transitions between crying and twerking, except it's me drunk in my living room at 3am and it's mostly crying

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Why does this 25 minute song exist??? Well, it’s more than an emotional journey through the five stages of grief that would not be as impactful if split into parts… it’s a lifestyle. This weaves together so perfectly even when the switches in style should be jarring, from intimate to bombastic to glitchy to full 808s and Heartbreaks autotune despair.

**skargardin** (11): Going in I had pretty high expectations seeing all of the praise this song was getting, but my god I wasn't prepared for this at ALL.

**stryxen** (11): no competition at all [essay about why this is the peak of music ever]

**stsangie** (11): woman, tell me what you want and i'll calm down without bleeding out with a broken heart that you stabbed for an hour woman, i was freaking out because i want you to know my beloved, you are the lover of my impossible soul woman, too, promise me you'll stay and put off all your woes i was wigging out too much worry, i could not get you at all and if you said what you want, you would laugh it off but i know you won't go, not for real at last must you write it off for the impossible soul? and i was in a dream, i was gone away without you but not too slow lest i put it off, for i put it right for the impossible soul and all i couldn't sing, i would say it all my life to you, if i could get you at all don't be a wreck, trying to be something that i wasn't at all seems i got it wrong, i was chasing after something that was gone to the black of night, now i know it's not what i wanted at all and you said something like "all you want is all the world for yourself" and all i want is the perfect love, though i know it's small i want love for us all and all i couldn't sing, i would say it all my life to you, if i could get you at all oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh trying to be something that i wasn't at all do you want to be afraid? do you want to be afraid? for life in the cage where courage's mate runs deep in the wake for the scariest things are not half as enslaved don't be distracted, don't be distracted do you want to be alone? do you want to be alone? for life isn't stained of righteousness pain the seed and the hail all impossible flights, for an interesting light don't be distracted, don't be distracted do you want to love me more? do you want to love me more? for love is the breath if water and wind is cursed by the same thing that nurtured its shame is it worth all the work? don't be distracted, don't be distracted have you failed to feel delight?

=====

steelstepladder: **thedoctordances1940** (11): Sufjan is quite probably my favourite artist of all time and with as many incredible songs he has, it'd surely be ridiculously difficult to pick a favourite. It isn't. In fact it's incredibly easy. Impossible Soul takes you on one of the most incredible lyrical and musical journeys you'll ever experience and all I can say is good luck not crying. Whether it's the gutwrenching impossibility presented by the prospect of "though I know it's small, I want love for us all", the heartbreaking "hold on suf"s or the cry-dancing you'll do to all of part 4, it's one hell of a ride and I'm not getting off anytime soon.

**Uberpigeon** (11): you gotta pay the troll toll if you wanna get into the impossible soul

**UselessTacooo** (11): Well… holy fuck. No one could have prepared me for the emotional gutpunch that is this song. There is just something about the production and the vocals that come together to create one of the best songs of all time. While for ages, I had been parading around my 11 for Come Alive, I discovered this and couldn’t help but 11 it. The only part of the song I’m not sure of is the vocoder part, and even that isn’t bad, just weird. I seriously hope this wins.

**vayyiqra** (11): This isn't merely a song. Calling it that wouldn't begin to describe it. I'm going to try to be brief in explaining how I see its meaning, but this is a suite in five parts and the premise of the song is that it's a story about Sufjan being with a woman and being unsure what he wants from her - he describes it like this: "I want to get with a girl, and there’s all these obstacles, and shortcomings, and miscommunication ... and this is a basic fundamental of life, between two human beings." From here there's a dialogue between them in the form of a duet where she tries to convince him that they could love each other and have a relationship together, while he's not sure if he wants that, and feels guilty for leading her on. This leads to him spiralling and having an existential crisis where he has to confront feelings of inadequacy, conflicting feeling about loneliness vs. intimacy, and questioning if he's a good person at all. At this point it's become about much more than just these two characters and is about the human condition and the need to be loved. I'd better stop because I'm getting pretentious here, but it's such a cathartic song - everyone can relate to the kind of things this song is about even if they have no experience with or interest in romance or sexuality. Sufjan himself called the intent of the song to be therapeutic, and it definitely is. The coda is the saddest and bleakest part of it with Sufjan singing about his self-hatred and apologizing for his faults, but it seems like the ending is a downer. This part being acoustic isn't a coincidence I think since it's about the same length and sounds a lot like "Futile Devices", making it a counterpart to that song. I'm getting in my feels now so I'm going to stop here, but I could easily write a whole essay on why this song is so deep and moving. It is a masterpiece, and there's no question it deserves to be called the best song in this rate even if it doesn't win.

**waluigiest** (11): this is basically 5 perfect songs. I would give it a 50, but 11 is as close as I can get.

**wavingwolves** (11): look it's sufjan's own all too well (10 minute version) (taylor's version) (from the vault)... i could not believe it...

**1998tweety** (10): this gets a 10 solely cause he managed to make a 25-minute long song and not have it suck

**AHSWeeknd** (10): are y’all gonna play the whole thing in the rate reveal?

**apatel27** (10): A concept album within a concept album

**Awkward\_King** (10): woah

**celladonn** (10): Not long enough

**ChidiArianaGrande** (10): This should be renamed the long as fuck rate. But also I cannot stop listening to this song

**cremeebrulee** (10): i love that this ends on a more acoustic note, really bookends the whole album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Well, here we are. I mean...I don't know what comment I can give that will give this song its justice. What a sweeping, rollicking journey of several acts, covering so many genres and emotions. All the acts differ from one enough but I feel like I'm being transported into this epic, of Sufjan wrestling with his desires enmeshed with disappointments, wracked with indecision. It follows a similar sonic template at first to the rest of the album with the electronic beats and orchestral garnishes peppered throughout. It opens up I think in a more straightforward way than the rest of the "bigger" songs of the album like title track and Get Real Get Right. It's a song of back-and-forth inner turmoil, of daring to go for what you want (your passions in life or passions towards a person), or to recoil in fear and paralysis. The chorus in the song feels like someone's desperate inner monologue-no I don't want to feel pain!- parallels with this existential grief and also the chronic pain allusions in this album. The plea to not feel pain and don't be distracted almost feels like Sufjan was predicting our numbing fears in the age of social media addiction, how we long for things but would want to stay in our algorithmic numbing bliss. I like Part 3 with the autotune, with Sufjan admonishing himself, as if he's upset that his own ambitions put him in this precarious situation, for he "couldn't be at rest". Then Part 4 in the choral chant of "it wasn't safe", it's resounding and sounds like people having a joyous call and response at a bonfire but also a breakdown. I view Part 4 as subverting us into thinking the song will resolve into this cheery, hard-earned optimism, until the very end brings us back to Sufjan's acoustic yearning about a failed relationship due to his selfish desires. It's a true rollercoaster of a song between sounds and lyrics. It subverts expectations at every turn. It bobs and weaves through folk, show tunes, prog, noise rock and electronica. The wrestling of all these conflicting desires against the non-stop genre shifts make it one of the most enthralling pieces of music I've listened to in a long time. I get the hype.

**IdiotBox01** (10): some dipshit will probably give this a 0 because it's 25 minutes long

**IIIHenryIII** (10): we have to show appreciation when an artist is able to achieve what Sufjan achieved with this track. It's already a hard task to keep someone entertained throughout a whole album, and he was able to do that with a song so long like this? What???

**nt96** (10): Not even LOTR: Return of the King took this long to end but it still slayed.

**pheromenos** (10): why not

**Qwilphish** (10): Probably one of the most impressive songs I've heard simply for being so long and yet it never feels a drag to get through. It is split into multiple sections each of which are stunning in their own right. I like how the end of this track ties in with the beginning track and Stevens's earlier works with the acoustic style. I'm glad he was able to work through all of the chaotic feelings he went through during this album to go be in a place to go back to his roots at the end. Perfectly encapsulates the themes of this album.

**seanderlust** (10): fun fact: this song, by itself, takes up almost 13% of the main rate's run time

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the way im fully entertained throughout the 25 minutes and won't have the urge to skip it. he really did THAT.

**slimboyfriend** (10): Imagine Impossible Soul (50 Minute Version) (Sufjan's Version) (From the Vault)

**welcome2thejam** (10): First and only time I saw Sufjan live, he played this. Honestly was not a big fan of this track at the time, thinking, "he's really gonna do the twenty-five minute song? So much stuff I finally wanna hear, and instead the setlist is one-third Impossible Soul?" Well I was wrong, it's a 10 out of 10 (that said, I would've still killed for another Illinoise song)

**xxipil0ts** (10): This is if Swans was gay and made Bohemian Rhapsody. I love it!

**bookthieving** (9.5): the duality of having both a 0 (stupid man) and an 11 (not so impossible) in a single song

**nootnoot781** (9): TWENTY FIVE MINUTES????? oh wait it slayed

**throwaway7650** (9): he's talking about the rate results at the end :noitstrue: [2]

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): on one hand, i don’t have either the time or the emotional bandwidth to sit through this at the reveal, but on the other hand this is too good to not make a big run

=====

steelstepladder: **\_\_Avaritia** (8): Sometimes I think this song, which by the way is longer than 1000 gecs, is just way too long for its own good, like I keep thinking to myself GOD WHEN WILL THIS END! But every time I listen to it I find something new about the song that captures my attention and I think, okay, this is a fine enough song length... I GUESS. No it's too long dude, it's too long, it's a long life, better pinch yourself, put your face together, better get it right! Why is it fucking 25 minutes long, I'll never understand, it's not so impossible! It's not so impossible! It's not (it's really too long though)

**rotating3Dtext** (8): it never ends

**runaway3212** (8): This is good, but in a 25 minute song there's bound to be some weaker parts

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I’m glad he saved one of the best songs for last however he really could have split it up into multiple songs (one 25m long song is pretentious I’m sorry), and each of those songs would have been better than nearly the rest of the album

**Leixander** (7): remarkable to make a song this long but still captivating. "don't be distracted" part is 10-worthy on its own, wish it was a separate song

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this doesn't get good until about 11 minutes in and even then i think it's hard for literally any song to justify being 25 minutes long

**BeauMeringue212** (6): he really had some gall making this 25 minutes lol. The song feels like a bit of a spiritual journey, but it doesn't work well enough to be that long and fully keep your attention imo (sorry sujwifties don't kill me pls) . It's a great narrative conclusion to the album though, and I love the banjo part at the end, it's a bit more traditional Sufjan

**FlavaSavaVandal** (6): This is like partially a good song, Suite I and II are good and then Suite III starts and it starts a quick descent to bad. Suite IV is slightly better even if I think Sufjan should never harmonise with a choir for the remainder of his life before coming back to something resembling the quality of Suite II and II as Suite V starts. It’s a messy song, probably to reflect the messiness of that relationships can embody, but not the good kind of messy, just a sloppy kind of messy, the kind of sloppy messiness that comes when you decide to do as 25 minute long song that honestly feels shorter than some of the other songs on the album cough cough looking at you Too Much

**RandomHypnotca** (6): An important part of music for me is replayability. I'm the type of person who will become obssessed with certain songs, and loop them dozens of times, hundreds for my absolute favourites. Often I'll be listening to a playlist on shuffle, come across a song I really like, and loop it for a few plays even. The key part is I love reliving moments. The first listen is a great experience, but being able to revisit feelings and emotions is what I love. And that's ultimately why Impossible Soul doesn't do it for me. I'm fine with long tracks, but this length feels excessive. There's defintiely repeated themes, melodies and ideas in this song, the clear division of parts does in fact tell a story, and it's an interesting journey, but I'm not convinced the parts coulldn't have been released as seperate tracks, as part of an EP, or in some other form or shape than the 25 minute long song we see here. I get why some people like it, but it's length ultimately makes it hard for me to enjoy it.

**TiltControls** (6): I get the point of having a massive epic like this, but I still kinda wish it was split up since there are some sections of the song I like a lot more than others

**fadedblue09** (5.5): It definitely feels like a grand, climactic closing track…..that is, if we were talking solely on the sound. Unfortunately, the lyrics are not on par with the song's sonically intriguing quality, and ultimately it just feels meandering as a result.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Gluttony is a sin! This song upsets me because there’s parts that I do like but they’re buried in so much excess, it would have been smarter to just cut out the parts that work rather than

**Blisterman** (3): Good choice if you want to get value for money on a Jukebox. But otherwise I'd never listen to this again.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i know im going to get ripped to shreads by the sufjan stans for this one, but please let me explain my reasonings. i have absolutely no problem with songs being 10+ minutes long, and having different sections and being "experimental" and whatnot. hell, theres a 10+ minute song in the bonus rate that im giving a 10 to! the problem with impossible soul to me is that it doesnt sound like a fully fleshed out song that just so happens to be 25 minutes. to me, it sounds more like sufjan woke up one day and decided he wanted to make a song that was 25 minutes long, started writing it and realized that he couldnt reasonibly stretch it out to 25 minutes without it getting boring and tedious to listen to, and decided instead to just throw in as many random musical elements in as possible to extend the runtime, without considering whether or not they actually fit with the song or sound good in general. i could list so many parts of this song that have absolutely no reason being in present: the awful sounding off tune guitar solo that comes in about 2 minutes in, the choir that sings the majority of sections 2 and 4, the AWFUL autotune used section 3 (it sounds like a parody of people making fun of awful autotune usage but its being played off entirely sincerely?), actually the entire third section in general is a complete mess to be honest and is completely out of place compared to the rest of the song, the weird electronic(?) breakdown near the end of part 4, every single one of these elements sound like something that was added in just to inflate the song's runtime and not for actually fitting the theme of the piece. so yes, i already know that this song is gonna win and im gonna look like an idiot when im the only person who gives this a 0, but for all the hype and praise this song gets, i was expecting something life changingly amazing and extravagent, and all i got was a disjointed cobbled together mess. thanks but no thanks

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.955): i’m predicting now that i’ll be the highest average for this so i’ll just accept this achievement gracefully and use the space to say that this is one of my favourite albums ever. this album slowly grew on me over the years (although i always thought it was good!) and i think almost every song here is a masterpiece. i love it so much and impossible soul is the best song of all time i fear (also incredible that this is only my 2nd fave suf album - dear god when are we rating carrie and lowell)

**ReallyCreative** (9.891): This album just means a lot to me, for a number of reasons. I would say this was my first true exposure to experimental music, and it shocked me how much it deviated from what I knew about Sufjan as an artist. However, I quickly fell in love with the beeps and boops, and Age of Adz remains one of my favorite albums of all time!

**stryxen** (9.727): a bit of context for my scores: i have 4000 sufjan scrobbles and my 2000th and 3000th were both impossible soul and also those were within like a month of each other

**apatel27** (9.682): Evey Sufjan album is a giant emotional dump and all them are always great. This is no exception.

**musical\_pyn** (9.636): Age of Adz is one of my favorite albums of all time (and my favorite sufjan album), so uh my scores kinda reflect that. There's so much I could write about this album but I'll just say that it's one of the best albums about embodied experience I have ever listen to. I don't really know what that means exactly, but if it means having to listen to Adz more and more I will gladly do so.

**plastichaxan** (9.591): My God i love this album, Sufjan is just an incredible artist, everything he does just makes my ears happy and my soul feel emotions i didn’t know i could feel also he’s hot how can a man be so perfect

**waluigiest** (9.545): I’ve been a Sufjan fan but I only knew 3 albums: Illinois, Carrie and Lowell, and A Beginner’s Mind. This project blew my mind. Everything is executed with perfection: the lyrics, the emotional vocal delivery, the thematic threads, the HUGE orchestration. It’s a masterpiece, plain and simple.

**sirpancakeXI** (9.500): this is my favorite album of all time and multiple tracks being my favorite song of all time as well. i might not be able to write a whole essay to express my love for this album but im just glad more people get to hear sufjan's music through this album.

**vayyiqra** (9.455): My comments have all the details, but wow this is an incredible album. I wrote the most about it by far and had the most to say, because I've been listening to this nonstop this year. It's full of emotional and relatable lyrics (especially about Sufjan's health and personal struggles) and I love the experimental and electronic direction he took on it. This is definitely my favourite Sufjan album and maybe the best of the year it came out. Masterpiece. I've been converted, I am a Sufjwiftie. I have gotten right with God.

**stsangie** (9.318): :sufjanholdingpoppers:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.300): For whatever reason, I've always put off a Sufjan discography deep dive. It could be my indifference to a lot of folk music, and getting caught up in the quieter albums in his catalogue. Well, this album is up my alley and an exquisite mixture of ambition and desperation. The soundscape is very much for me, as the halting, dramatic orchestral arrangements over electronic beats keep me engaged most of the time. I'm very fascinated by the making-of this album, as Sufjan delved into Royal Robertson's artistry. I can see the not-so-great aspects about people's fascination towards outsider artists and musicians. Is it voyeurism, like staring at something peculiar in dehumanizing manner? I see that side; however, I understand Sufjan's fascination because I've had my obsessions over the years with people like Henry Darger and James Hampton. I think there's an aspect of earnest, fundamental connection you get with these artists who live outside the realms of conventional, art systems. You're peering into another's unfiltered world where there's often a lot of fabulousity and grotesque things poured over the page. I see Sufjan's attraction to Royal's artwork and wanting to make something more fantastical, insular and emotional than his earlier, more accesible concept albums. Here I can hear his desperation all throughout, whether in more intimate moments or the grand religious calls that sound straight out of a 1930s German opera. Also, the themes of chronic illness and body struggles I relate to a lot this year, which I think steeps this album further into that insular yearning and grief. It's a peculiar and bold album that resonated with me for the most part. And yes, Impossible Soul is a highlight of my year.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.227): The most beautiful "noises" I've ever heard. This is not my favorite album in the rate, but it's getting the highest score. I have a really good explanation though: the quality stays consistent from beginning to end. Every single song is so perfectly crafted; however, Plastic Beach ended up becoming my favorite. It was such a surprise, and it brought me a lot of fun. I had a blast bopping to it.

**akanewasright** (9.218): This is… maybe one of the best albums rates have introduced me to? The 10s on this album are some of the strongest 10s I’ve ever given, I actively want to 11 all of them

**skargardin** (9.182): Seeing the praise this album got before I listened made me go in with pretty high expectations, and I'd say that they were met and then some. Such a hauntingly beautiful album, even though it's a heavy listen and I couldn't see myself return to it much because of that, it's nontheless excellent.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.182): this album sounds like nothing else. it is cacophonous and loud and suffocating and alternates between hauntingly beautiful and loud and chaotic. it feels like Sufjan in the middle of some great crisis, some large catastrophe. you get peeks of the old Sufjan here and there but mostly he's consumed by some great force, some great emotion throughout the album. it is amazing

**CrimsonROSET** (9.182): I’ve been wanting to rate Sufjan officially for a MINUTE now, and while this is an odd album to start with, it’s still so fucking good. He really wasn’t fucking around. Carrie and Lowell next, please!

steelstepladder: **austrosinitic** (9.182): So I know that I've written long, pretentious comments about each song on this album that are probably incomprehensible to other people and that y'all probably won't be bothered to read but I just want to say that aside from Sufjan being an important artist to me as a gay person with faith in general Age of Adz in particular is a very significant album in my life because I got into it right when I was having my first ever crush on a friend I made in freshman year after I'd suppressed any romantic feelings I had for years due to trauma and tbh in hindsight I was obviously going through some kind of mental health episode during that time that made me exaggerate and overglorify those feelings (also I am still friends with this guy and I haven't even liked them at all that way for a long time now) actually getting the chance to fall in love as a gay person in a (mostly) healthy way released so much shame and guilt about my sexuality in me and the way I interpret this album — as an album about Sufjan, or whatever persona he's writing from the perspective of here, realizing he's gay — just encapsulates the feelings I had during that time period so much and ties in with my beliefs about how queerness is legit a spiritual experience that changes your inner nature (quoting St. Paul here) that and affirms your worth and dignity and gives you new life <3 (I didn't even realize that Sufjan was ill when making it up until now but that just makes me soooo much more interested in analyzing it even further from the added paradigm of disability too.) Thanks so much to the hosts for creating this rate and to give me a chance to finally put into words why the narrative of this stupid album speaks to me so much and how I think it's essentially the best summary of how Sufjan's music can occupy both the Christian and LGBT tags on RYM LMAOOOO

**UselessTacooo** (9.136): My personal big shock of the rate. I went into this expecting basic guitar ballads with like 1 shocker track, and left with my ears broken by insane synth sounds. Sufjan has such a way with lyrics and it allows him to work around any style of production. For my first listen of Sufjan, I’m quite impressed

**Leixander** (9.091): the amount of delusion some people have to annotate obviously gay lyrics on this album as "straight brotherly love" is something else honestly @people in genius.com

**thedoctordances1940** (8.918): as a massive sufjwiftie I'm so excited to finally be able to rate an album of his and while it may not be quite as good as Illinois or C&L, this is still a phenomenal album and well it has my favourite song of all time, so there's no way I could be disappointed

**nt96** (8.636): All I gotta say is WOW. I've listened to a few of Sufjan's songs before and I kinda liked them, but this….this was something else. A perfect balance of glitchy chaos and orchestral whimsicality.

**cremeebrulee** (8.482): i think saying this is a bad sufjan album to start with is kind of inaccurate dddd i'm not super into the folksy scene, so this was a rly great entry point for me since the sonics and the lyrics of here work pretty harmoniously. it really made me appreciate sufjan's songwriting enough to check out his other stuff-- i think he just has a knack for just writing honest lyrics that are understandable but still quite beautiful.

**Callum1245** (8.455): 10

**AHSWeeknd** (8.273): This was a great listen, ngl the closer was probably my favourite track.

**welcome2thejam** (8.091): This was always gonna be a tough follow-up to my co-favorite all-time album Illinoise, and it took a while to grow on me, but boy am I glad it did. Some of Suf's best stuff is on here, especially the trio of cathartic climax screamalongs of Vesuvius, I Want to Be Well, and Impossible Soul.

**modulum83** (7.964): impossible soul and her cute little sisters

**BeauMeringue212** (7.745): I love his more accoustic/folkier stuff more tbh but some of these tracks succeed in hitting that same emotionality in his other works.

**mudkip1** (7.727): a recurring theme that connects all three of these albums is that the good parts are great and the bad parts suck horse shit. I wish some of the middle tracks were stronger, they feel sluggish compared to the beginning and ending

**ChidiArianaGrande** (7.545): 7.54

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.409): Yeah I'm pretty sure this is Sufjan's best album (at least from the few I've listened to from him, being this, Illinois and C&L). Perhaps it's the glitchy, electronic, almost hyperpop-esque production that sells it for me, and how it marries the sort of lush and whimsical, Disney-esque production that Sufjan loves to employ. It's a cool record with more highlights than duds, even if the duds are pretty sizable stumbling blocks. I still would like to know what the fuck the Age of Adz is though >:(

**FlavaSavaVandal** (7.045): In Sufjan there are two dragons, the one who wants to make folksy singer-songwriter songs, and the one who wants to make indietronica songs with lyrics that just repeat themselves until you die. One of these dragons consistently makes good music, and the other varies in quality. Unfortunately the wrong dragon won throughout most of The Age of Adz

**xxipil0ts** (7.000): For some reason I can't get into every track despite it very good. Sufjan has always been an artist for a specific mood for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.909): I was apprehensive about this album going into this rate because I’d tried to listen to a Surfjan album before (*Illinoise*) and found myself terribly bored by it but I was quiet pleased by this when it started… unfortunately it kinda peaks with the title track and then slides downhill but maybe he isn’t bad.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.900): I think this album is just not for me. Sufjan’s voice and lyrical style does not work at all with me for the production, which is pit band music mixed in with chaotic electronic sounds that have no cohesion. Props to him for trying something new when get was getting sick of his previous style, but this doesn’t work for the most part

=====

steelstepladder: **Blisterman** (5.818): Had never listened to this before the rate. I only knew Sufjan from his quiet, melancholy songs. So I was surprised at how ambitious and big this album sounds. I feel it's an album that would benefit from more repeated listens than I could give it now.

**fadedblue09** (5.318): I knew I was gonna have a hard time with this album because it’s not my taste, but even then I still think it’s the weakest of the three. IMO, it lacks the cinematic storytelling and intriguing themes present in the other 2 albums. I think this album only works if you are a fan of Sufjan to begin with, but if you aren’t (like myself) it just comes off as another Sufjan album...with a tinge of glitchiness I guess.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.091): i tried to like this album. i really, really did try to like this album. im not exactly a known sufjan enjoyer but i really wanted to give this album a chance for supposedly being his most experimental album of all them all. surely even if im not a fan of his acoustic tracks id enjoy something more electronic right? but listening to this album felt like a chore. i relistened to this album at least 5 times waiting for something to click, and it never did. yes, its “different” from his other work, but adding bleep bloop noises over boring acoustic guitar doesnt change the fact that underneath it all its still boring acoustic guitar music. the couple songs on this album i actually enjoyed are not enough to save how boring a listening experience this was for me overall. at this point ive accepted that im never truly going to enjoy any project with sufjans name on it

vayyiqra: >u/austrosinitic (9.182): So I know that I've written long, pretentious comments about each song on this album that are probably incomprehensible to other people and that y'all probably won't be bothered to read

james just wanted to let you know that i read every single one of your comments carefully and thoughtfully and enjoyed seeing your interpretation of this album and how much it means to you; when your scores were left out on day 1 i was afraid you missed out on this rate, but i'm glad to see you did get to do it and write everything you wanted to say about the albums here. (and damn you wrote a lot i thought i was wordy but you pulled out all the stops)

even though your reading of adz is kind of different from mine (i don't tend to see it as a coherent narrative from beginning to end the way the archandroid is meant to be, but more like a series of vignettes of what sufjan was thinking and feeling at the time) i see a lot of the same themes you do in it, and just last night i was relistening to the album and thinking about your proposed storyline for it, and it did make sense to me and i can see how you relate to it. it's very interesting to see a work through someone else's eyes and how that changes what it means to them

hope you're having a great day my friend! keep being you you're awesome

---

**2dina3dworld** (9): OUR WINNER, BBIES! Held the top spot for the entirety of the rate, never wavered, despite her doubters! Icon shit!

---

**1998tweety** (11): im ascending

**AHSWeeknd** (11): Janelle is a powerhouse when it comes to writing… and honestly everything else. But oh my god this is such genius from every aspect.

**apatel27** (11): The pure energy coming from this gives me strength like no other song has

**BeauMeringue212** (11): the electric guitar solo omg

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): ALRIGHT. Well here we are. There are many potential 11s in this album for me. Back in 2010 when I was more casually listening to this album, this track always stuck with me, as well as the iconic music video. The new wave, driving Drum n Bass instrumentals are just a punch to the gut in the best way. It propels you to move forward while the synth riffs wrap around your head like a tantalizing earworm. And Janelle's impasssioned singing really makes me feel like yeah, this world can fucking suck! Janelle explains that the song, outside the album's context, is also about people fighting with self doubt (paraphrase) "a lot of us were taught to think there's something wrong with us, from our hair to our nose..a lot of us are fighting a war within ourselves..it was important for this song to be on this project...you can use those unique qualities as superpowers." There's doubt then defiant confidence. And the bridge sells it for me, where Janelle releases her voice to shout out her guitarist Kellindo to go into an epic guitar solo. It's new wave, it's soul, it's drum 'n bass, it's electric blues, it's epic, it's fragile, it's so many things all at once. Truly an 11 I feel in my heart.

**fadedblue09** (11): might be a basic choice but damn these lyrics are emotionally hitting me right now. I know that she wrote this with her personal experiences as an American black woman but the lyrics feel universal enough to be a song of struggle.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (11): the USA to the USSR after WWII ends

**nt96** (11): "You better know what you're fighting for". Damn right I do, I want this song to win!!

**welcome2thejam** (11): A mighty being of unstoppable momentum. Once she yells Kellindo, it's over for my other potential 11s

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): A triumph for Miss Monae all around. Hard to hate a song like this. Let's go!

**akanewasright** (10): People are saying this will win, which seems odd to me, but I’ll take it, it’s excellent

**austrosinitic** (10): Even when I was a lame person who couldn't get into this album I loved this track so much — it's one of those pop songs that manages to convey a breadth of epicness in spite of its shortness. It's in between this and Impossible Soul for the winner IMO and while I'm rooting for Sufjan I wouldn't mind this masterpiece taking the prize home at all

**Awkward\_King** (10): me until monday because my bedroom window is stuck open and i havent got it fixed i should go down to reception

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): great

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Cold War….Hot song!

**celladonn** (10): Absolute banger

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok bop!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): is a taylor swift reference a stretch here

**frogaranaman** (10): Harry S. Truman during his presidency:

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is such a uniquely Janelle song and probably the moment where she best hits the balance between her wacky Afro-futurist android persona and her authentic, revolutionary pop star self; it’s pop friendly yet artistically ambitious AND manages to further the narrative of the album while still having an accessible/universal message. Her vocals go OFF and I love the music video where she just stares at the camera… she’s just such a star here. A win contender, hopefully.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): why does it sound like Janelle is shouting “Glinda” at the end?

**Leixander** (10): KALINDOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**modulum83** (10): FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): wouldn’t be mad if this won

**plastichaxan** (10): i don't think i've ever heard someone sound so powerful ever

**Qwilphish** (10): Such an important song for this album and for the Metropolis Suites story line overall. The MV is also very simple but so powerful. I love every part of this song.

**RandomHypnotca** (10): try fighting somewhere a bit warmer then it won't be cold idk

**ReallyCreative** (10): way more fun than the real thing!

**rotating3Dtext** (10): I want Janelle to make a musical

**runaway3212** (10): If only the actual cold war was as good at this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I WAS MADE TO BELIEVE THERE’S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME!!

**seanderlust** (10): this goes off. mister gorbachev, bust it open on that wall or whatever reagan said

**sirpancakeXI** (10): it would have gotten my 11 if sufjan isnt in the rate

**skargardin** (10): there's so many layers to this theme in terms of the production and the subject matter, I can't get enough of it

**slimboyfriend** (10): I saw this song live once....... tears

**stryxen** (10): i am desperate for this to beat tightrope

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/853273927718797333/906610738200739890/IMG_7268.png

**throwaway7650** (10): the stretch from the beginning to here is sooo good. KELLINDO!

**UselessTacooo** (10): Iconic bop. It’s so upbeat and fun.

**waluigiest** (10): I love the middle where it sounds like she screams “Glinda!!!” like she’s auditioning for wicked

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): absolute megabanger, the cold war wishes it had this much going on (actually probably not, avoiding nuclear destruction was definitely the better thing to do)

**ChidiArianaGrande** (9): Tempted to give this a low score because I dont think it should win but I am an honest man.

**J\_Toe** (9): really strong song and an amazing music video

**Blisterman** (8): this track's maximalist energy reminds me of Outkast's BOB, setting us up for an appearance by Big Boi in the next track.

**vayyiqra** (8): Sigh. I have to give this a good score because it is a great song, and I don't want to pretend it's not, even though that also means Sufjan is less likely to win. But still, what a good song. Maybe it does have a flaw in that the lyrics are kind of underwritten and could be more detailed, so I can justify not giving it a 10. It's still not the song I want most to win, but I won't be mad if it does, you know?

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it's fine, I guess

**wavingwolves** (6): i really like the way it winds down and connects with tightrope

It is so validating to know someone else hears the "Glinda" yell

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.778): Believe it or not, as I write this I feel like I've spent the decade taking Janelle Monae for granted. Now, I've been in love with her music the moment I heard Tightrope in 2010, and rocked out to songs off Electric Lady and Dirty Computer. I know we like to be hyperbolic on internet music communities, but I really do this this album is a masterpiece. Janelle is effortless in blending genres that you can barely tell the broad scope of what she's covering. Her voice goes from a quiet lull to soaring belts, and you feel her conviction of each note. She sings with intention at every corner whether it's Come Alive, Cold War or 57821. Sitting back and taking in all the lyrics offered me a deeper understanding of Janelle's world-building. Her afrofuturism influences know no bounds as she takes us on a trip through androids' struggles and Cindi's quest to make things better. Cindi is such a dynamic, complex character who is a fighter but also so in love with Anthony Greendown. Janelle explores racism, self-hatred, self-love, incarceration, time travel, star-crossed lovers and so much more on this album. She came onto the scene after her first EP with one of the strongest points of views I've seen in a new musician in my life time. On a personal note, even when I was more surface level, early 20s me felt so enthralled to see a fellow black woman who was such a commanding presence like Janelle. She was free about being herself and taking all of her influences and sci-fi passions and constructing this beautiful piece of art, beyond the music industry/general public's constraints of what they think black women should be doing in life and music.

**ReallyCreative** (9.583): I mean, it's Janelle. The worldbuilding, the genrebending, the iconicism, we know who she is and with this album, we get to see it up close and personal.

**apatel27** (9.528): Outside being an amazing album, the transitions between the tracks deserve an 11

**AHSWeeknd** (9.389): 10 A masterpiece. The production merging orchestra with R&B is such perfection.

**Leixander** (9.278): one of my favorite albums of all time, simply amazing.

**plastichaxan** (9.067): Janelle is one of my favorite musicians ever and this album is just masterful, full of 11s id give if i could, honestly her talent in literally everything she does in insane i love this woman

**SFbby** (8.889): I've listened to Dirty Computer before but this my first time listening to The ArchAndroid, and now I 100% understand why people say Dirty Computer is good, but The ArchAndroid is a stronger, more ambitious work of art. Absolutely phenomenal

**nt96** (8.711): I'm ashamed to admit that until recently, I didn't know that Tightrope was Janelle's song. Aside from that, many consider this to be among the greatest albums of the 2010s and I can see why.

**xxipil0ts** (8.706): This is the first time I'm listening to this album and damn, even the interludes are also good.

**stsangie** (8.694): pirate jet

**stryxen** (8.672): i gave this a 100 on aoty even tho this is my lowest score the consistent high quality carries this to being a perfect album and i wouldn’t change one thing about it.

**vayyiqra** (8.611): This is the album I got into first of the three. Despite my highest average going to Sufjan, I didn't really listen to his music before this year. I have liked this album for a while though, and have heard all of Janelle's music a lot of times. Sometimes I'm not sure if I like this better or The Electric Lady, but it is good from beginning to end and has some of her best songs. I love the way Janelle uses scifi themes that borrow from retro aesthetics like Art Deco, cyberpunk stories about robots, and more and blends all these influences together, along with her based political themes. Also, she's really pretty and the cover is cool as hell so there's also that going for it. Damn, I need to listen to this album more. I love Janelle so much.

**musical\_pyn** (8.611): The storytelling on this album is incredible, and it doesn't sacrifice good music either.

**waluigiest** (8.556): For me, Janelle Monae is maybe the only artist who can do a concept album that 1) is coherent and textual, 2) has genuinely good songwriting independent of the concept, and 3) isn’t extremely corny. She knocks it out of the park here. She effortlessly builds this world with poignant themes and characters and arcs. And you can pick out any individual song and relate it to the theme or digest it independently as it relates to sexuality/race/government in our reality. It’s masterful.

**skargardin** (8.444): There truly is something for everyone on this album. Janelle is such a diverse artist and it really does show on this album with the wide range in genres.

**Callum1245** (8.389): 10

**austrosinitic** (8.361): Honestly this has always been a pretty daunting album for me because it's such an epic, cinematic album that my ADHD has trouble recalling a large portion of it especially the parts that are full of instrumental bits lmao but each time I've listened to it I've warmed up to it more and more and I think this rate is one of the first times where I've straight up realize how? Good? It? Is? I don't even know the story it's built on (I wish I could but. school. will definitely check out the ep sometime in the future though) but along with Hounds of Love it's probably the closest a pop record has ever gotten at telling a story from front to finish in lush, consistent detail by both musical and lyrical standards. It's not one of my favorites yet, although it will probably be one in time, but I'm grateful that I've finally seen the light 🙏

**sirpancakeXI** (8.306): This is the first janelle album that i have listened in full and im interested to further explore her discography,

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.167): Admittedly I had always thought that this record, from the point that I had listened to it way back when this year, was a masterpiece. While obviously there are some real high highlights on this one, The ArchAndroid’s weak spots are tough to ignore in how boring its lulls are. That being said, the whole record is still very much enjoyable and still remains as Janelle’s most excellently crafted album to date, packed with powerful performances and a nice diverse spread of tracks throughout that make this album seem shorter than it actually is.

**UselessTacooo** (8.167): The only album I went into the rate knowing, and for that I’m thankful, as without it would have not discovered everything else here. Janelle definitely has the most upbeat and fun album on the list, and it’s one I revisit often. While not every song is perfect, most of it I enjoy. I really want Janelle to make her way back to the more unhinged sounds of this record on her next project. This is the sound for her, and I don’t think that’s up for much debate.

**Blisterman** (8.167): This blew my mind when it was first released. I'd never heard an album so inventive and eclectic. To this day it is my favourite album of all time.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.056): I kinda have to give this album a good score or Janelle will ban me from the sub lol

**CrimsonROSET** (8.028): I think it’s time I admit that other than a dirty computer, I had never dove deep into janelle’s discography. This is a good start, but I can see how far she has evolved. Even if some of the lyric choices in the album have aged awfully, most of its sound hasn’t!

**fadedblue09** (7.833): A recurring sentiment I had in this Rate is that all these albums sound more interesting on paper than they actually are. This is probably my favorite of the 3 but it still has its issues. The premise is really cool and I love the themes tackled, but I feel like it could've been condensed better and sometimes it stuffs too many ideas in one. Still glad to finally hear this though.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.833): first time listening to Janelle, and I love this project. Feels futuristic and retro at the same time, and is such an amazing fusion of funk, rock, and pop

**thedoctordances1940** (7.711): Suite II is definitely really good and has a load of great highs, but Suite III is just a drop off for me and I can't find myself caring for that much of it

steelstepladder: **welcome2thejam** (7.611): If I treat this like an actual musical or a story, it doesn't really stick the landing for me, though I suppose that might be unfair cause I'm not sure that's what it's trying to be (definitely wouldn't mind seeing her take a crack at a stage musical though). Overall, a wonderful, beautiful trip into this world Janelle's created, and makes me want to dig deeper into the rest of her discography. Cold War into Tightrope is as strong of a 1-2 punch as you'll find anywhere, and the guitar here - Kellindo! - is just something else.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.611): her best album actually! now can we rate her 2nd best album the electric lady :) and we ignore farty computer

**modulum83** (7.239): janelle monae said robot rights

**mudkip1** (7.111): what a solid piece of art! Very experimental and profound, she really shows us everything she’s capable of and leaves with nothing else left to prove. I don’t care for a couple songs but as a whole it’s definitely her best work

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.806): falls off in the second half and has its fair share of duds but the highs are extremely high and overall its a great pop record from an artist so unfairly ignored by the gp. one day we will get you the recognition you derserve janelle!

**IIIHenryIII** (6.667): Too long. It would've benefited from a shorter tracklist, which I know wouldn't make sense because of the concept. However, I couldn't care less about the storyline. Basically, if your music does not sound good, what you have to say is irrelevant. Anyway, I liked this album more than I thought I would (it's not really my cup of tea). It has some skips but it's a good album overall.

**cremeebrulee** (6.606): i feel as though i was a bit catfished by this album... i expected something more dystopian, but everything here is so much more romantic. nothing wrong with that, it just feels like a set-up to not mention how much the love story plays a part in this album. that aside, while there are some clear standouts on here (cold war/come alive/tightrope), i think janelle has outdone herself on subsequent projects.

TiltControls: Amazing rate Dachi and Steel!!! Even if the string of Gorillaz elims caused me pain.

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates coming!

#**Songs**

Congrats to **Cold War** for pulling out the win in the face of numerous 11s!! It lands in the top 100 highest rated songs at #23, which is enough to land on the highest scores leaderboard! Funny enough it lands right ahead of Janelle's first rate winning song

**Impossible Soul** still gets the distinction of having the 12th most 11s acquired in a Popheads rate at 26! (Which ties it with Ungodly Hour). It also lands on the 11's Magnets leaderboard in 8th, getting 34.21% of the available 11s! This is the first time a song has made the leaderboard in about a year (last time was in the Whitney/Madonna/Janet rate) 

For the other 9+ songs:

* **Impossible Soul:** 99th

* **On Melancholy Hill:** 103rd

* **I Want to Be Well:** 223rd

#**Artists**

**Janelle** becomes the 8th artist to get 3 or more rate wins (with 2 previous wins with Make Me Feel) 

We've got a mix of cases for the average leaderboard today! We've got Janelle already on the artist board, Sufjan with two songs rated, and Gorillaz never rated before. Let's see how they stand!

* **Sufjan:** 11th out of 280 artists with 8.297

 * Below: Fiona Apple (10th by 0.019 points)

 * Above: Kendrick Lamar (12th by 0.005 points)

* **Janelle:** 31st out of 280 artists with 8.084 (previously 28th)

 * Below: Chloe X Halle (30th by 0.015 points)

 * Above: Kanye West (32nd by 0.006 points)

* **Gorillaz:** 160th out of 280 artists with 7.405

 * Below: Miranda Lambert (159th by 0.003 points)

 * Above: cupcakKe (161st by 0.003 points)

Though Sufjan is our only non-winner today, congrats to Sufjwifties as he did manage to win himself a leaderboard spot! And super close to the top 10 too

#**Albums**

Unfortunately **Age of Adz** just misses the top 25 highest averages board as it lands in 27th (which is still quite high!)

Also past the immediate neighbours for the artist averages that whole average region is so hilarious when comparing them:
