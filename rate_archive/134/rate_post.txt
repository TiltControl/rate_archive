2010 High Concept Pop Rate (Gorillaz/Janelle Monae/Sufjan Stevens)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/qle5do/2010_high_concept_pop_rate_gorillazjanelle/

 Let’s get schwifty, Sujwifties!

Kia ora, and welcome to the 2010 High Concept Pop rate. u/steelstepladder and I are very excited to be hosting what is sure to be an exciting and highly competitive rate!

The three albums we will be exploring in these rates are all concept albums, that explore themes such as climate change, racism, and mental health through the lenses of characters living in either a dystopic far future world (*Age of Adz, the Archandroid*) or simply fictional characters in our real world (*Plastic Beach*). As an English major, I can say that often the best stories are ones that explore real-life themes explored through the lenses of a world that is unfamiliar to us. The disconnect from our real-life society is often enough for us to think of certain themes in a different context, and to reconsider previously held notions, especially in dystopian works where it encourages you to think critically about the circumstances that led to the world the characters are now living in, and how the decisions we make inform the world we will be living in tomorrow. Remember, critical thinking is hot girl shit <3

The fun thing about all three albums is that they all have their high energy, frenetic moments that r/popheads seem to love. All three have their inspiration from pop music, thus the “High Concept Pop”, even Sufjan whose usually remembered as “sad ukelele boy”, but as you can tell from the write-up by the wonderful gucci.

**Plastic Beach**

The album that started it all.

Notice the username?

My username comes from the Gorillaz - Gorillaz were 2D characters in a 3D world… or to simplify it, 2dina3dworld.

But enough about me. Here’s almost everything you need to know about Plastic Beach!

Plastic Beach is what is referred to as ‘Phase 3’ of Gorillaz. Phase 1 and 2 belong to the self-titled album, and Demon Days respectively. Does that all seem meaningless to you? Don’t worry, Gorillaz lore is weird and complicated and somehow involves the Powerpuff Girls, but that it is a story for another day. Let me give you the basic rundown of the events leading up to the release of Plastic Beach.

Let’s start with the four members of Gorillaz. Murdoc, 2D, Russel, and Noodle. Want to learn them to tell them apart? Easy. Murdoc is the green one, 2D is the one with black eyes, Russel is the one with white eyes, and Noodle is the token girl. Except, if you watch the videos, you may notice one thing. 2D, yes, the blue-haired guy, has white eyes throughout the majority of plastic beach with the exception of the Stylo music video. That’s from the stress of Murdoc holding him hostage on an island of floating trash.

You see, Murdoc’s ego led to the band imploding in between the release of Demon Days and Plastic Beach. Well, that and the death of Noodle in [El Mañana](https://youtu.be/hji4gBuOvIQ). Oh, and Russel being exorcised of the spirit of Del the Funky Homosapien, which led to him having a breakdown in Ike Turner’s basement. Murdoc, upset with not being the center of attention anymore, kidnapped 2D from Beirut and ran away to a floating trash island where he forced 2D to work on an album with both him and a cyborg he made that he based off of Noodle. Cyborg Noodle was used as security, and as a very funky guitarist.

Then shit hits the fan when a boogeyman just randomly shows up and kills a manatee, it turns out pirates are pursuing Murdoc because why not, and a mutated Russel shows up with a very much alive Noodle. The story ends there, due to several conflicts that everyone had with each other, including the label versus Damon Albarn, and Damon Albarn versus Jamie Hewlett.

But now that that is out of the way, let’s talk about the album itself.

Plastic Beach is an album that is built on an electro-pop base, taking influences from various genres, and bringing in a variety of eclectic collaborators while not wavering from the electropop that it’s built on. While the electropop is definitely the most pervasive element, there are several other large influences on the album itself - for example, the orchestral elements present in the first three songs of the album, or the hip-hop influences on Stylo, Superfast Jellyfish, and Sweepstakes. One way of describing it is “genre roulette”, and that is very true, but those who love the album will argue that it is still cohesive and one with an over-arching sonical theme. That theme is the ever-present synths that never seem to waver, providing a backdrop throughout the whole album and a connecting thread that stops the album from becoming too cluttered or incoherent. 

The lyrical themes of Plastic Beach are mostly related to anti-capitalism and [climate change](https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/fans-criticise-gorillaz-selling-nft-impact-climate-change-revealed-2909703#:~:text=27th%20March%202021-,Gorillaz,anniversary%20of%20their%20debut%20album.), with the occasional intervening love song. So, on one end of the spectrum, you have “Some Kind of Nature” which is about fast fashion and commercialism, in the middle you have “Stylo” which talks about the benefits of human connection and the over-use of the planet’s resources, and on the complete other end, you have “On Melancholy Hill”, which when divorced from the context of the album, it becomes a straight love song. That’s the thing about Plastic Beach, even in songs not directly about the theme of the album, the concept is still weaved in through little references to the imagery and storyline that Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett created. It is immersive even without context, and some would argue that the visual components of the album actually make it less immersive and impactful. 

The combination of dreamy synths, and pessimistic, often heart-broken lyrics create an environment that is morbid, foreboding, but it’s kind of like being at the end of the universe, watching the sun consume your planet while you watch from the stars. Plastic Beach is meant to be [the traditional Earth ballad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEyX1On_b0) we listen to as our world is destroyed. It’s pretty, but that pretty is superficial and hides a terrifying story of human selfishness, broken relationships, trauma, and unending, unrelenting anxiety. In the end, the greatest commentary of Plastic Beach may be how we see our world dying, and instead of rallying against the dying light, we look at the death and destruction and stubbornly insist on "Seeing the good side" while we inevitably slide to our deaths.

**Age of Adz**

(guest written by u/MoonlightByWindow)

After the release of Sufjan Stevens' fifth studio album \*Illinois\* in 2005 (part of his notorious ‘50 States Project’ marketing scheme), he had firmly cemented himself as an indie star. The album, his most critically and commercially successful up to that point, was lauded by many critics as the best album of 2005 due to its superb songwriting and varied instrumentation. It comes as no surprise, then, that Stevens would capitalise on this success, embarking on a world tour and releasing two more albums in 2006 - \*The Avalanche\* (outtakes from \*Illinois\*) and \*Songs for Christmas\* (self-explanatory). 

What \*was\* surprising were the years that came after that. Since making his debut in 2000, Stevens had released one full-length studio album every year, up until 2006. Fans wondered why the usually-prolific singer seemed to be taking his time with the release of a new album. The answers aren’t hard to find - in an interview with Pitchfork after the release of \*Illinois\*, he stated that he was considering quitting the music business, as well as saying “I'm getting tired of my voice. I'm getting tired of ...the banjo. I'm getting tired of ...the trumpet” (a sentiment that would be echoed in 2010 when he said “I was sick of the strummy-strum acoustic guitar song”). But the most important reason for his break from music lies in a mysterious affliction he dealt with - in a promotional interview for \*The Age of Adz\*, he stated:

\> Yeah, it was really confusing and catastrophic in a lot of ways because it was a virus I had that affected my nervous system and I no longer had control of my responses to circumstances and events. I had this hyper-adrenaline and was in chronic pain. I had to go and see neurologists and physical therapists and do all of these tests. The nervous system, the brain and spinal cord are so mysterious, profound and beyond our understanding. When you’re not well and your body has these traumatic responses to illness, it takes so long to recover from that and have your body restore itself. It took months and months and months. It was really bizarre.

Doctors were left dumbfounded, unable to work out what had caused the illness and how to treat it. After many months, the illness subsided on its own - and Stevens was free to make \*Adz\*. A noticeable departure from his previous acoustic sound which he was known for, \*Adz\* is synth-laden and explosive with Stevens even wailing and shouting at times. He would go on to say: “That’s why I think the record’s really obsessed with sensation and has a hysterical melodrama to it.” While Stevens experienced this illness, he would also take inspiration from artist Royal Robertson (of whose artwork can be seen on the album cover), a self-proclaimed prophet who had dreams and visions of “space aliens, futuristic automobiles, eccentric monsters, and signs of the Last Judgment” - in fact, the track \*Get Real Get Right\* reflects Stevens' view of Robertson.

Of course, this kind of sound from Stevens was entirely unexpected with many people not sure what to make of it - both critics and fans were left divided, with some proclaiming it as his best work yet while others called it a cacophony of noise. Nonetheless, it received generally positive reviews with critics highlighting the themes of love, anxiety, and death. The opener \*Futile Devices\*, an acoustic track that sounds nothing like the rest of the album, was highlighted for being a standout, as well as the epic 25-minute (!) closing track \*Impossible Soul\*, described by some (i.e me) as a “free therapy session” which takes you through the break-up of a relationship in five different parts. \*Impossible Soul\* is regarded by many fans to be his best song ever made.

In my personal opinion, this album has grown on me incredibly over time and I believe it’s his second best album (just behind 2015’s \*Carrie and Lowell\*), and I hope that through this rate some people listen for the first time and end up loving it!

Tracklist:

1. Futile Devices
2. Too Much
3. Age of Adz
4. I Walked
5. Now That I’m Older
6. Get Real Get Right
7. Bad Communication
8. Vesuvius
9. All For Myself
10. I Want to Be Well
11. Impossible Soul

Janelle Monáe - [The ArchAndroid](https://imgur.com/a/Pk4EGYZ) 

And now we have the third and final album in the rate! The ArchAndroid by Janelle Monae. It's been a hot minute since we've rated Janelle so it's great that we are going back to arguably her most ambitious album from a conceptual level. The album itself follows Janelle's first EP, Metropolis, and follows the same character throughout. It isn't essential to listen to Metropolis in order to follow the story into The ArchAndroid, but it is a great listen so I'd recommend it. The projects follow Cindi Mayweather, an android sent back in time in order to save her fellow androids from The Great Divide, a secret society whose purpose to oppress android kind.

The Metaphor of androids as this world's minority population is prevalent throughout the album, as they are often hypersexualized, and degraded throughout the story. The power of artistic expression is also seen as extremely important, specifically in the dance and music forms. This can be seen in the Tightrope music video, where the power of dance enables Cindi and friends to enact a jailbreak. The Great Divide knows of this power, and wishes to continue to suppress the androids from using it to its potential. This can be seen in the art included with the album on the release of the [Ten Droid Commandments](https://imgur.com/gPjzQgh). I don't want to go too far into the story as to spoil it, but the use of these types of metaphors and lyrical themes don't stop there.

Musically this album is very similar to other albums in the rate as it blends various genres and sounds, without being nailed down to any given one for too long. One moment you'll be grooving to a retro soul bop, the next you'll be whisked away by a gorgeous string arrangement, setting the stage for the story to unfold. At its core I'd say that type of retro R&B is what really drives this album's base, but at the same time, it does not do justice to Janelle's varied musical pallet that she takes from on this album. That retro sound is not only there to drive the music, but the setting and themes as well. As the story is loosely derived from the 1927 film Metropolis it makes sense that this album would look backwards to drape atmosphere and intrigue over the already rich setting. Janelle's vision has an attention to detail so vivid that it makes for more than a worthy challenger to the other two high concept albums in the rate.

Tracklist:

1. Suite II Overture
2. Dance or Die (ft. Saul Williams)
3. Faster
4. Locked Inside
5. Sir Greendown
6. Cold War
7. Tightrope (ft. Big Boi)
8. Neon Gumbo
9. Oh, Maker
10. Come Alive (The War of the Roses)
11. Mushrooms & Roses 
12. Suite III Overture
13. Neon Valley Street
14. Make the Bus (ft. OfMontreal)
15. Wondaland
16. 57821 (ft. Deep Cotton)
17. Say You’ll Go
18. BaBopByeYa

**And last but not least, the bonus rate**

2. Gorillaz - Doncamatic (ft. Daley)
3. Sufjan Stevens - Where were You?

**RULES**

1. You must assign a score to every song in the main rate, no exceptions, zero, zip, zilch. I know Impossible Soul is long, but it’s no Dopesmoker. We will reject any ballot that does not have every score in the main rate done. The bonus rate is optional, but we do encourage doing it.
2. You have to give each song a score between 1 and 10. You are allowed to give up to one decimal place (for example, a 7.5 or a 4.3), however, any more than one decimal place (4.57 or anything longer than that) will cause your ballot to be rejected.
3. Your scores should not be considered confidential. We will share them with your username attached to them, and once the reveal has happened then they’re public anyway. You may have your scores highlighted, or taken the piss out of. That is not us being mean, it is all meant to be in good fun!
4. If you want to change your scores for nearly any reason, feel free to privately message me (u/2dina3dworld) or steel and we will do so.
5. You can add a comment to your scores! Entirely optional, and you are not expected to provide a comment for every single song, although it is good to have justification for particularly hot takes, and your 11 and 0. If you wish to do so, please use the following format:

Broken: 10 s(he’s) br(ok)en

6. Any variation from that will not be accepted. Here are a few examples of what not to do:

Dance or Die: 1: The Tramp Stamps said it best - “I’d Rather Die”

Too Much: This song was too much so I gave it my 0

Rhinestone Eyes: (11) i love it when a singer talks about how much they like big dick, it speaks to my soul… oh wait, they’re saying “that’s electric”.

7. Again, comments are not required, but they make reveals so much more fun so please consider it!
8. If you want to give an overall comment to the album, you can, using this format:

Album: the Archandroid: Janelle Monae is my favourite popheads mod, both current and former.

9. Please do not try to sabotage songs/albums. Steel and I will not accept your scores unless you have an essay’s worth of justification. And even then, we can tell when there’s a very obvious case of sabotage going on. If you have any questions about that, Steel and I would be happy to answer them if you shoot one of us a reddit or discord message.

**SCORES ARE DUE BY THE FOURTH OF DECEMBER, UNLESS YOU MESSAGE ME OR STEEL FOR AN EXTENSION. THE REVEAL ITSELF RUNS FROM THE 10TH - 12TH OF DECEMBER**

Ngā mihi nui (thank you very much!), and happy rating!
