NPR-Core Rate Day #3: Make Me Feel like a Geyser of Butterflies
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/bie9xz/nprcore_rate_day_3_make_me_feel_like_a_geyser_of/

Welcome fellow popheads to the final day of the rate reveal for the NPR-Core rate. Today we will be revealing the top third of the songs, from **#13 - #1**. Janelle and Kacey each have 5 songs remaining, and Mitski is still in the race with a solid 3. The rate will begin at 3pm Eastern / noon Pacific (about a half hour after this post goes live).

Don't forget to do the [Ms. Songeniality](https://forms.gle/JkQcYmxsayQMcue37) poll to decide what song from the first two days was robbed the most, and also what album was robbed the most from being in this rate. Voting is open until I reveal song #5, and the winners will be revealed before song #3.

Matthew-the-First: Haven't looked at how you guys have voted so far, but I'll take a crack at some predictions.

Top Janelle track will be Make Me Feel. Top Mitski track will be Two Slow Dancers. Top Kacey track... the safe pick would be High Horse, but I'm thinking there'll be an upset for Oh, What A World.

&#x200B;

As for actual winner, Kacey/Janelle top 3, with the edge towards Janelle taking the No. 1 spot

This song seems to best encapsulate Janelle's philosophy she esposes over the album. In a story in Rolling Stone before the album released, Janelle came out as pansexual, stating that "I consider myself to be a free-ass motherfucker". This philosophy of freedom is quite prevelant here, with Janelle saying "I don't really give a fuck if I was just the only one / Who likes that". She is telling the listener not to be boxed in by society or your labels, but be you, and don;t let the opinions of others effect it.

---
**TragicKingdom1** (11): best production in the rate + best lyrics + super catchy...what's not to love?

**bespectacIed** (10): Highkey the best song of this album and my true 11, but I wanna win my first rate sooo bad and Make Me Feel is a god-tier song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of the most underrated songs on the album. It‚Äôs so gorgeous and I love the self loving lyrics.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I wish I was able to turn my bullying into a bop like this

**Kaylaboe** (10): i remember when you dropped this song and rated you a 10. r&b perfection. and that fucking BRIDGE

**Leixander** (10): This was my favorite song from the album for some time, before being overtaken by Take A Byte, I love the lyrics and the spoken verse is the best one in this album.

**leviswift13** (10): the best song on the album. such an exuberant celebration of self. also i literally had someone tell me i was a 6 after cutting off a perm but i've always been the shit!!

**nooodisaster** (10): Interesting, clever lyrics? Check. Relatable emotion? Check. Empowering message? Check. Catchy and replayable? Check. And that's all before the highlight of this song comes in, the brilliantly personal rap.

**plastichaxan** (10): This gets to me every single time she's so powerful.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I was so so close to giving this my 11, because this is easily a top 3 track on this record that doesn‚Äôt get enough love when the album is discussed. The chorus is so fucking great, and the lyrics are so subtle but effective. It‚Äôs a very gentle self-empowerment jam and it doesn't feel like braggadocious excess, but instead fitting. That little spoken word verse is just icing on the cake, and the fade out in this song works incredibly well. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm always left of center and that‚Äôs right where I belong‚Äù is Janelle Mon√°e‚Äôs thesis statement.

**waluigiest** (10): everyone else who makes self acceptance jams can stop because this is what we need

**1998tweety** (9.5): A personal album highlight for me, vocals are great, lyrics are great, beat is good; it's hard to find something to dislike about this track. I love the shoutout to TLC, especially because as a black woman I'm sure they were a big inspiration to Janelle. It does get a bit repetitive at times but I get that this song is supposed to be a bit more catchy than say DJ for example. The rap verse is good too and is actually pretty memorable.

**kappyko** (9): yea i do too

**ManofOranges** (9): I like it like that.

**Roxieloxie** (9): tag yourself, i'm one of the kids in the math class

**survivorjdmarina** (9): This song is great! The melodies and strumming guitars at the beginning automatically give it a 1970s summer theme, and the semi-autobiographical bridge is a standout on the track.

**vhqv1997** (9): The fuckboy that rated her a 6 is about to catch these hands

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): i also like that

**c-ming** (8): an ode to individualism and self-esteem

**Cubascastrodistrict** (8): The production is probably the most boring on the album but honestly it works. I love the bridge.

**J\_Toe** (8): I like this. :)

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (8): are we supposed to all rate this a six as a prank?

**letsallpoo** (8): justice for sistar

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I Like That is another solid empowerment off Dirty Computer, and it happens to be the last link into a series of chains featuring songs that people adore (soon we‚Äôll head to Don‚Äôt Judge Me and So Afraid, both of which are controversial at worst and not nearly as beloved as the rest of this album at best). I Like That is a fascinating exercise in appealing to both universality and specific minorities at the same time. While Janelle is singing very clearly from the perspective of a black lady set apart for her physical features, there‚Äôs also a pride here that means something to the hearts of minds of every listener who‚Äôs been picked on for something they can choose to be. That delicate mixture is what makes I Like That so worthy of a song. Sonically, I admittedly don‚Äôt like it as much (the funk here doesn‚Äôt seem to go off as well as in Make Me Feel) but the track has special qualities that even I greatly admire.

**radiofan15** (7.7): You might do, but I just though it was OK

**Really\_Creative** (7.5): A little more "traditional" R+B song, it's nice but it's overshadowed by the rest of the album.

**enecks** (7): Just a little too sleepy, but also this is a more textured and admirable take on trap.

**passionfruits2** (7): I don't have strong opinions about this song.

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is fine, I like the doo-wop backing vocals, but I'm only rating it a 7 [and I was like, damn].

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): oh my god the bass in this is incredible how have i never noticed before. but i'm not too keen on the monologue break in the middle. idk if that's a popular or unpopular opinion, i really like the message but i just can never take "i remember back in maths class you insulted me" seriously and i feel bad

**frogaranaman** (6): Cardi B who?

**ryjomom** (6): I kinda Like That

**foxxglove\_** (5.5): this is a little lowkey and generic compared to the rest of the album. i like the spoken word section tho

This song is just pure braggadocio rap from Janelle, which isn't something you see that often from female rappers. Janelle pulls it off flawlessly, fending off all of the haters, and backing it up with her succesful career in acting as well. As someone who can sing, dance, rap, and act, this song is her warning to all that might underestimate her.

---
**vayyiqra** (11): When this album came out there was a lot of talk over how seamless the transition between Screwed and this song is, but hasn't anyone noticed that the rap itself is brilliant?? This song stays with me more than anything else on this album. It's like Janelle's whole thesis for it.

**bespectacIed** (10): Bars

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i feel like of the pre-release singles this was unfairly overshadowed but it's amazing

**Cubascastrodistrict** (10): Brilliant wordplay.

**gannade** (10): janelle is a better rapper than she is a singer teabh

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Let the vagina have a monologue makes me not even want to comment on this song so it can speak for itself.

**Kaylaboe** (10): easily my favourite lyrics of the year, easily the best rap song of 2018

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): This song personally came to my house and punched me in the face

**passionfruits2** (10): COMPLETE BOP! UGH HER MIND!

**radiofan15** (10): My guess is that Quavo Monae recorded this track earlier on the production of the album and decided that she was 2Pac reincarnated so she decided to include more rapping on her album even if it didn't worked that well... she works great here mostly because she's saying some really important stuff and because the production is top-notch, and that's it

**Roxieloxie** (10): another 11 honestly. I cant tell you how Refreshing hearing this live, second row screaming this Black Girl Magic anthem

**tapdancingpig** (10): Ugh she drops BARS here. Also - LET THE VAGINA HAVE A MONOLOGUE!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Another 11 contender in this rate. Janelle doesn‚Äôt usually rap on her songs, but this track shows she‚Äôs a very talented MC. The song obviously has some pretty feminist and outstanding lyrics, but I think it‚Äôs underrated just how well the song flows, with some pretty great assonance and alliteration going on, which just adds to how potent and punchy the song is. It‚Äôs all one verse, and it‚Äôs all heat. ‚ÄúLet the vagina have a monologue‚Äù is a clever highlight.

**vhqv1997** (10): LET THE VAGINA HAVE A MONOLOGUE

**enecks** (9): Janelle Mon√°e has bars. Like seriously this has more lines that connect than entire rapper's discography. No 10 because it's a wee bit gender essentialist.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song is BDE and also BVE

**ManofOranges** (9): This song has me QUAKING.

**nooodisaster** (9): A single 3 minute rap verse, and a highlight of this entire rate.

**waluigiest** (9): it took me a while to warm up to this song because it‚Äôs kind of discomforting. But it‚Äôs celebratory and smart and gives so much to the project

**stansymash** (8.7): transition of the year

**Leixander** (8.5): Let the vagina have a monologue.

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): A start to a more hip hop-centric sound on the album, it‚Äôs really great for what it is and what the lyrics represent. The political undertones of this track are a standout.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I‚Äôm honestly removing a half point for ‚Äòlet the vagina have a monologue‚Äô (you can see my Pynk comment for why, although I honestly think that statement sounds more out of place here than almost all of Pynk) but, God, is this a fantastic little segue into hip hop that newcomers to Janelle may not have been expecting. I don‚Äôt know how much Janelle‚Äôs tried rapping on The Archandroid or the Electric Lady, but if this isn‚Äôt the black girl magic that she‚Äôs talking about, then what could that magic possibly be? Dirty Computer‚Äôs forays into hip hop are actually excellent, in general.

**c-ming** (8): powerful, strong, motivational message with monae flexing her rap skills

**J\_Toe** (8): If each song on this album is representative of a facet of Janelle's identity, this song would portray Janelle's class background. She specifically talks about her parent's occupations and how hard they worked to shape a life for Janelle. And it furthermore references her own education and work to achieve the position she is in now.

**leviswift13** (7): i think janelle shines the most with melodic songs that highlight her voice and pop sensibility. her lyrics are fantastic in every song, but i think her songs shine the brightest when they rely on a musical melody

**1998tweety** (6.5): Ok so I already know that despite giving this a 6.5 (which isn't even an awful score), I'm gonna have to write an essay to defend myself otherwise I'm sure I'll get death threats. While I do absolutely love some of the clever lyrics Janelle writes on this track ("Jane Bond, never Jane Doe", "Black and white, yeah that's always been my camo"), I also found that a lot of them missed the mark: The bit starting with "Emoticons, Decepticons" and the next couple lines to follow feels like she's just slinging lines together nonsensically. The lyrically content aside, I'm not a fan of the production either (besides the violins and violas). The beat has the pulse feeling to it but it never really draws you in, and the autotune is completely unneeded and at least for me takes a lot away from the track because Janelle clearly does not need it. The one thing that I really love about this track though is that its a 3 minute long verse; unconventional song structures are something I dig a lot. Ultimately for me the track just feels underrealized; I've seen what Janelle can do and I don't feel like this reaches that bar, especially when she's making a political song and some of the lyrics completely miss the mark.

**frogaranaman** (6): The beat should go harder to match how hard Janelle is going IN on this song.

**kappyko** (5): she's a competent rapper 4 sure

**ryjomom** (1): i want to love this song, but I just can‚Äôt

**mokitsu** (0): really cmon now

Just Barely missing the top 10, this is the perfect closer to Mitski's album about love lost and unrequited. A song about two old lovers, very aware that their time on Earth may soon be coming to and end, and painfully aware of how complex their life has gotten since they were in school. There's something so beautiful and moving in this song about the boring but unstoppable tragedy of growing old.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Wow what a strong end to the album. The longest song on the album, it actually has enough time to leave an impression on you. The lyrics and emotion in this song are so gorgeous.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): this song is so pretty it makes my heart <//3

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i think i've listened to this maybe TWICE without at least tearing up. heartachingly beautiful

**enecks** (10): Two wigless dancers more like. Because WEW.

**kappyko** (10): the best album closer out of these three albums... her mind

**Kaylaboe** (10): the perfect way to close the album

**leviswift13** (10): SUCH A HEARTBREAKER AHHHHHHHHHH feels like the end of a heartbreaking indie film

**nooodisaster** (10): True story: Once I made my boyfriend listen to this song and he didn't think it was sad, and we almost broke up. Seriously, this song is EVERYTHING. The lyrics evoke all senses, from smell to touch, with the bizarre yet perfect scene of a school gym dance. There's a lifetime of sadness to this song, a realization of age passing and acceptance of things far gone. This is kind of an epic scope Mitski is dealing with, but she makes it as intimate as a close-up in an indie movie. When she repeats "To THINK that we could stay the same" over and over, the bitterness of age weighing against the last delusion of an easy life? Oof. I need a hug.

**radiofan15** (10): I've been too harsh with this album... it deserves it but at least it ended up having an actual good song that also happens to be one of the few tracks with a normal lenght...

**Really\_Creative** (10): A 4 minute song?? In **MY** Mitski album??

**rosesmp3** (10): the rumors are true i'm crying

**stansymash** (10): we can all cry together!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Why are the first and last songs on this album the best‚Ä¶ anyway, this song is really sad and touching and great and is actually ethereal, unlike the rest of the record which tries to be and never quite reaches the heights that the first and last tracks do.

**vhqv1997** (10): This song is an existential nightmare, like slow-dancing inside a black hole at the end of the universe

**waluigiest** (10): makes me nostalgic for the high school experience that heteronormativity stole from me

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Ending a record with a ballad completely fit to appease  your listeners is incredibly tricky business, but Two Slow Dancers concludes Be The Cowboy on such a satisfying note that it might be the best example of this trope done right since Madonna‚Äôs ‚ÄòMer Girl‚Äô. The only standard-length song on an album full of tracks that last shorter than the life of your average housefly, Mitski‚Äôs swan song makes the most out of its special status by sticking to minimalism. All Mitski has here is a piano to accompany her ‚Äì there‚Äôs no rock guitars or pop production, but merely the awe-inspiring presence of a woman, her emotions, and a couple of keys. It‚Äôs no coincidence that Two Slow Dancers contains some of Mitski‚Äôs most compelling notes on Be The Cowboy, and it‚Äôs no coincidence that this is the one track of the entire record that nearly everybody likes, bias against ballads be damned. If this ends up low in our rate, then we may have to bring that classic ‚Äòdelete Popheads‚Äô petition back!

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): It's peaceful, and the story is captivating and beautiful. Mitski's vocals are also really impressive here.

**c-ming** (9): captures nostalgia in a scary and sentimental way

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): A wonderful heartbreaking ballad to end the album on

**Leixander** (8.5): Lyrically amazing but could do better if it was shorter. At 4 minutes length, it is like 1/8th of the album (which has 14 tracks mind you) duration.

**vayyiqra** (7): This song opens with the most random simile I've ever heard in a pop song [yes, including that Shakira song] but other than that it's alright. Being a slow ballad it seems kind of Lana-core, and I can fuck with it.

**frogaranaman** (6): I would appreciate the odd rhythm more if the rest of the song / album wasn't so lazy and last-minute sounding.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (4): Oh thank god, this album is finally over.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (3): A four minute song, truly, a miracle. I actually really like the synths after the chorus. Nice closer. Strong emotionally.

A very simple song from Kacey, but also very sweet. I think the fact that it's simple, but also so happy, just makes it that much better. The lyrics are pure, and sound like something a teenager might write about a first crush. Kacey excellent songwomanship then transforms them into a great and beautiful song.

---
**Brendon-Urine** (11): I can't think of a single song at the moment that makes me feel immediately happier than Butterflies. When Kacey comes in with the hook it just directly warms my soul in the most literal way possible. Can't get enough.

**Awkward\_King** (10): the post chorus instrumental is just fucking phenomenal, and the double entendre throughout with a rebirth as well as the feeling of nerves is neato as well

**bespectacIed** (10): CÃ¥ÃÇÃ≥Ã£Ã¶ÕìHÃ∏ÃÇÕñÃùÃ©RÃ∑ÕÜÃÉÃ∞ÕöYÃµÕêÃéÕäÃ¶Ã§Ã≥SÃ∑ÃΩÃÄÕïÃ¨Ã•AÃ∏ÕëÃõÃêÃãÃπÃªLÃ∑ÕÇÕùÃ™ÕïIÃ¥ÃøÕäÃÉÕùÃØÃ∫Ã¨ÃûSÃ∂ÕÇÃ¢Ã™ÕçÕâ

**ExtraEater** (10): the most relaxing sunny afternoon ever

**Kaylaboe** (10): the vocoder effect on this is so pretty üò≠ kacey took her crown with this one

**passionfruits2** (10): lovely gal

**plastichaxan** (10): My favorite from the album.

**strawberryswing1** (10): u/imadudeduh no offense but please choke

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Making me want to twerk and yeehaw at the same time

**tapdancingpig** (10): This song was already an 8.5 before the vocoder harmonies came in.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song is pure wholesome excellence and I‚Äôve never understood why it wasn‚Äôt as revered as some of the other tracks on this album. It gets overshadowed by some of the bops on the record, but this is my favorite song on the album for sure. It‚Äôs a beautiful track that‚Äôs simple but makes me smile because it sounds exactly like summer and the songwriting is so simple yet so effective. If this dropped in the early 2000s, bitches would be fucking headbanging to this masterpiece and Natasha Bedingfield would‚Äôve bent the knee.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): diabetic coma levels of sweetness and we have to stan!

**1998tweety** (9.5): This song is so soft and cute and wholesome. The lyric "stealing my heart instead of stealing my crown" is so simple yet effective.

**Really\_Creative** (9.5): It's so simple but so peaceful and gorgeous, which you can say for quite a lot of this album.

**c-ming** (9): a gorgeous ballad and ode to her lover. so wholesome, so pure

**leviswift13** (9): litearlly country-pop, ethereal, romantic realness

**ryjomom** (9): CHRYSALIS

**vhqv1997** (9): Everytime I listen to this song I think about that time somebody on here asked for songs about anthropods and I kinda want to be their friend

**stansymash** (8.6): this is so cute and wonderful

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Not the biggest fan of cute love songs, but this one is good

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): This kinda feels like a song off of fearless but either way its nice

**kappyko** (8): This one has always been cute to me... but you're no "Slow Burn"

**Leixander** (8): I need the kind of joy I hear in Kacey's vocals in my life!

**waluigiest** (8): is this a bisexual anthem

**yourhostandpatron** (8): This was always one of my least beloved songs on Golden Hour because of it being a simple infatuation song that I didn‚Äôt find to be as magical as, say, Oh What A World, but listening to it again for this rate made me appreciate its beauty, although I still can‚Äôt exactly pinpoint what goes on here that makes the song adored by so many others. Some things that I can admire in its composition are the mix of comfort, humility, peace and acceptance that Kacey reveals throughout its duration, as well as the fact that she just sounds incredibly cute as she sings it. It‚Äôs still not one of my favourites, but maybe I‚Äôm finally starting to see why it brought so much attention to Golden Hour.

**radiofan15** (7.8): This sounds and feels like something that a 17-years-old Taylor would have written... if that's a good thing or not it's up to you

**frogaranaman** (7): This is literally me with my crush.

**ManofOranges** (7): This song reminds me of Dandelion on Kacey's first album in that they both involve some nature symbol and I don't particularly like them.

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is cute but the "chrysalis" line is taking this metaphor a little too seriously. I kind of wanted to laugh, but didn't.

**gothheart** (6.5): meadowesque but ultimately too prarie

**nooodisaster** (6): VERY generic, but pretty catchy.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (4): I like the synth in the background, it adds some lightness to the song. But in general this feels sort of meh. It just doesn't do anything for me. Like it's not bad, it's just not anything.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Ok the lyrics are awkward, the melody is boring and empty, which for a song that's supposed to be a positive love song, that's not a good thing. I feel like whatever this song has for it, literally any kacey song has done better.

This song snuk its way into the top 10, which came as a complete shock to me. A very spacey song, questioning everything she sees, it evokes a sense of wonder that we all need in our lives. The combination of vocoder and banjo is also something that seems completely new. The synthetic voices that open the track were also used to open her live shows over the past year. Also, the inspiration for this track was, you guessed it, an LSD trip.

---
**ExtraEater** (11): life-affirming park walking music

**Kaylaboe** (11): this song is like therapy in music form. the vocoder effect is once again so pretty on her voice, the melodies are incredibly warm and comforting. i feel so at peace and at the same time i want to cry

**rosesmp3** (11): this is honestly one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard

**c-ming** (10): this song would've been cliched and corny if delivered without kacey's genuine sense of wonder and amazement. without a doubt, kacey's writing abilities are still amazing; she has merely discarded biting punchlines for equally witty and gorgeous coinages. extremely uplifting, hopeful, motivational.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): kevin parker wants what kacey has

**frogaranaman** (10): Pure bliss in a song.

**gannade** (10): a perfect love song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is so soothing and gorgeous

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I almost gave this my 11. I went on a walk on a sunny day the sunday after this came out, and this song came on and I nearly cried just cause I was walking around and looking at all the beautiful things around me and I was a little overwhelmed and just happy.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): you think I'd be tired of these slow jams but honestly feels like they're just getting better

**leviswift13** (10): THE VOCCODERS AHH literally such an otherworldly effect

**ManofOranges** (10): Another beautiful song.

**radiofan15** (10): If Thomas Rhett's Leave Right Now is as if The Chainsmokers have made a country song, this is the Daft Punk equivalent

**Really\_Creative** (10): Genre-bending QUEEN. Also, I love me some TASTEFUL banjo lines.

**ryjomom** (10): I need to get my hands on some edibles

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Definitely my favourite on the album. The Daft Punk-inspired vocoder at the beginning is heavenly, and fits well with the mood of the track. I also like how the chorus is dreamy and atmospheric, like I‚Äôm floating underwater.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): these are *REAL* *THINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): electric disco cunt~~r~~y wow she jsut never stops

**kappyko** (9.5): oh god oh fuck, what a world

**1998tweety** (9): This song took a few listens to grow on me, but I love it now. It's so atmospheric.

**nooodisaster** (9): This was the standout on my first listen, and still is great. The awe-filled way she describes the world in such simple yet distinct ways is wholesome and perfect for this song, the chorus is catchy, and the vocoder gives it flavor.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I love how this record takes pop country into some bold territories. On this track, Kacey infuses some metallic-sounding Daft Punk-like vocal effects with some familiar banjo to evoke the magic of the modern world. It‚Äôs a pretty optimistic track about discovery, and while it‚Äôs not quite avant garde, there‚Äôs a pretty slick modernity to the track, as the instrumental feels almost more post-rock than pop country.

**vhqv1997** (9): Combining vocoder and banjo? The power that that has, the intelligence that that has, the clearance that that has, the access that that has, the influence that that has, the profile that that has, the international implications that that has

**Leixander** (8.5): Makes me feel calm, would fit on a "studying" playlist well.

**enecks** (8): wo

**silkypanties22** (8): chords are same as slow burning that I liked, and vocoder intro did not feel out of place

**waluigiest** (8): the little instrumental bit after the chorus is fun and cute

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I really like this track for the sense of enchantment it gives its welcome listeners, though I‚Äôm not as big on the Daft Punk-like robotic voice that opens the song as some may be. I‚Äôm going to take the time to share a snippet of a Rate Your Music review of Golden Hour pertaining to this song that I had to endure once, though: ‚ÄòThen there's the embarrassing "Oh What a World," which is just her saying, "Wow, there's some cool stuff in this world." Wow, no shit. You can hear the song as a confirmation that the world is more beautiful than it is ugly, but that doesn't mean you have to refuse to acknowledge the fact that the world is really fucking ugly. Every time I hear her say, "These are real things," I think of that Syrian toddler in the back of an ambulance, not knowing what to do with the blood he's wiped off his brow.‚Äô Read this out loud in an accent for maximum enjoyment and/or pain.

**passionfruits2** (7): they got me gal

**vayyiqra** (6): The banjo and Daft Punk-esque vocoder are ... not meshing well to me. Otherwise, it's fine, I guess.

**Roxieloxie** (5): It's a nice song, im just never a fan of slower ballad types

**Cubascastrodistrict** (2): Like the background vocals. Is Kacey negging me???? I don't like the lyrics. Again, this is fine, I guess.

I feel like this song can be compared very easily to Kesha's song of the same name. Both are songs that are fairly minimalist, just a piano and vocals. Both use the rainbow to sybolize a light within the darkness of the surrounding world. This song is quite the pick me up, and I really love the sentiment behind it.

---
**passionfruits2** (11): It ends the album on a perfect note. There's not much to say really. MASTERPIECE.

**1998tweety** (10): An LGBT BOP, this song is so wholesome and simultaneously makes me feel happy and sad.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): this song makes me think everything will be alright

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): kacey can say the f word!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A nice piano ballad for a closer? I am in love!

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Break out your phones and lighters

**leviswift13** (10): we got a lot of tears left to cry with this one

**nooodisaster** (10): Kesha and Kacey both platinum selling, outsold hate. If someone sang this to me, I would fucking cry. Just so wholesome & beautiful.

**radiofan15** (10): We stan a slut anthem that gaves us gay rights when performed at the Grammys

**Really\_Creative** (10): Kacey doubling as my personal therapist for my emotionally unstable ass when will your fave

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): [I wrote about this track in the jukebox](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ay1v9k/the_popheads_jukebox_week_107_come_and_paint_the/ehxnhik/), but to reiterate, it‚Äôs a really beautiful closer, a tearjerking song fit for a stadium, and the most tender moment in a record full of tender moments. It‚Äôs great.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): She is... the mother I never had. She is... the sister everybody would want. She is the friend that everybody deserves. I don't know a better person.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this is the gay anthem we should be hearing in the clubs. gays popping their pussies and crying to "cause the sky has finally opened" dance remix

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): a bit strange to end the album with a simple piano ballad, but it‚Äôs so effective at the same time

**c-ming** (9): as a companion to silver lining, it is an uplifting message that emphasises the hopefulness and power of optimism. definitely a song to listen back to whenever one feels down.

**plastichaxan** (9): I'll be honest, this wasn't a standout to me at all when I first listened, until she released as a single I realized how much of a powerful closer this is and I'm sorry I underestimated that Kacey.

**ryjomom** (9): https://www.target.com/p/twizzlers-candy-straws-rainbow-licorice-candy-bag-12-4oz/-/A-50526120

**survivorjdmarina** (9): I like how this song is very hopeful and optimistic, and it‚Äôs beautiful.

**vhqv1997** (9): Kacey said GAY RIGHTS!!

**waluigiest** (9): a fine piano ballad. Maybe even better than fine!

**Leixander** (8.5): May be a bit cheesy but it is still adorable and sincere which is all you need from a song sometimes.

**stansymash** (8.3): yo there's a rainbow outside my window right now, it's a sign i should give this song my 11. should

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Now here‚Äôs a song that‚Äôs certainly inspired by Carole King‚Äôs Tapestry. Pop has evolved into a more maximalist genre ever since the days of Frank Sinatra and jazz bands, thanks to American culture making it take shape, but Rainbow is a welcome return to the genre‚Äôs soft, singer-songwriter roots. Perhaps cementing her status as an honorary member of the queer community, Rainbow is an excellent way to end Golden Hour, and it grows in time the more you start to admire it.

**enecks** (7): Kesha outsold. And this is a little dull.

**kappyko** (7): I wrote on this before and I still feel like this is a rather lifeless ballad to close such a colorful album out on. The sentiment strikes me more now though.

**Roxieloxie** (6.8): very calming

**frogaranaman** (5): Gays.

**vayyiqra** (5): I have a rule about piano ballads on pop albums: they're almost always mediocre. This song only supports my hypothesis. Kesha is unbothered.

**bespectacIed** (2): I know this is a mcdonald's drive thru but i'll still rant anyway: kacey has admitted to bullying gays before and probably still says the word that rhymes with maggot and y'all are making this bland song a gay anthem? Electric chair.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (2): Not as good of a ballad as slow burn but not bad I guess.

Americans is the perfect way to sign off on such a tense, politcally charged album. Janelle paints a picture of everday tragedies in America, while also contrasting older, more opressive values, with her philosophy of more personal freedom. The pastor who opens "Crazy, Classic, Life" also returns to end the album, reiterating that until all of us can live in complete freedom, "This is *NOT* my America." The song ends on two very different notes, both with a confident "It's gonna be *my* America before it's all over", but also with the more somber "Please sign your name on the dotted line", implying we are still in service to the corporate machine that hangs over us all.

---
**frogaranaman** (11): Yep, definitely going to move out of this country sometime soon.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): A fucking bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): The moment this track erupts into a holy intro, you know you‚Äôre in for a ride, and what a ride Americans is. Janelle Mon√°e brilliantly satires American conservatism in a track that feels effortlessly critical in a way that doesn‚Äôt feel like pandering, choir-preaching safeness. It‚Äôs bold in the best way, and the first verse drones on, with clever wordplay that would piss off any bootlicking bastard who would stumble upon this track. Each individual nugget of the verse is a quip in itself, and we didn‚Äôt even get to the smirk-inducing bridge, where Janelle gives some of her greatest lyricism to date. ‚ÄúI like my woman in the kitchen, I teach my children superstitions‚Äù  is one of the slickest political clapbacks I‚Äôve heard in the last few years of music. And it doesn‚Äôt end there, with the sly ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy, baby, I‚Äôm American‚Äù in the chorus. My favorite part of the entire song (which is saying something), is the brilliant, succinct second verse. ‚ÄúSeventy-nine cent to your dollar, All that bullshit from white collars, You see my color before my vision, Sometimes I wonder if you were blind, Would you make a better decision?‚Äù is just spectacular. The spoken word sections are also great, and the song and album closer ‚Äúplease sign your name on the dotted line‚Äù is the icing on the cake for a truly great project. Americans is perhaps Janelle Mon√°e‚Äôs greatest accomplishment thus far, a truly searing satire where every second, every word feels not just essential, but monumental - and easily deserving of my 11 in this rate.

**1998tweety** (10): Now this is the kind of track I was looking for in Django Jane, it's so polished and pulls off its message so well. Dirty Computer is obviously a political album, which appears to be triggered in part by Trump's controversial presidency. When the results were announced I saw tons and tons of people wanting to leave the country, so it's extremely refreshing to hear Janelle blare about how she is American and she will defend her land. Despite being a queer black woman, being a part of so many disadvantaged minorities, she's not going to give up. The line "I'm not crazy, I'm American" is so simple but packs so much punch. Americans have constantly pushed the boundaries on what is possible, and have been true innovators (although not always have the right people been given the credit they deserve ex. women and poc). This is the kind of lyrical complexity I wanted from DJ, the lyrics have multiple layers and can be read in different ways. On top of the lyrics being great, the song is groovy too and the chorus is really catchy.

**Awkward\_King** (10): she signed the declaration of indpendence and the bill to pass gay marriage. her mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ivqFkLYxp8 also stan mj rodriguez

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): janelle 4 president

**enecks** (10): This ties together Dirty Computer. A protest anthem with joy and pulse. GOD DAMN IT I WANTED TO LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH WHY THE FUCK DID YOU HAVE TO HAVE PYNK IN THERE AND RUIN IT. THIS WOULD BE MY AOTY BUT YOU JUST HAD TO SLIDE THAT TERF ANTHEM FEATURING A PEDO IN.

**gothheart** (10): a perfect closer for a pretty close to perfect album

**hikkaru** (10): if this doesn't make top 10 popheads is made up of racist republican trump stans tbh

**kappyko** (10): This has more in common with "Footloose" but a bop

**leviswift13** (10): the genius really jumped out

**PuggleMaster** (10): I get chills from the intro alone

**Really\_Creative** (10): The song This is America could have been, everything about this song is amazing. The church choir opening, the poignant but crisp lyricism, the instrumentation. This is NOT my America.

**rosesmp3** (10): This is one of my favorite album closers of all time. Janelle did that

**Roxieloxie** (10): Catch me blasting this on the way to polls next year

**ryjomom** (10): This is the only way I can rate Americans a 10.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): I'm not from the U.S. but this song makes me feel American. Regardless, this song is extremely funky and the subject matter is extremely noteworthy of the political climate of America, much like this album/\.

**waluigiest** (10): yes god this works

**radiofan15** (9.2): Woke fun BOP... but I had to deduct the arbitrary number of 0.8 points because i'm not American

**stansymash** (9.1): perhaps the Princiest moment

**Brendon-Urine** (9): Prince didn't die, he just channeled himself into Janelle Monae.

**c-ming** (9): this song is a call to action, with monae raising multiple issues to take a stand on. contains the iconic line 'you see my colour before my vision'

**foxxglove\_** (9): janelle said lemme just fuck around and end this country's career

**J\_Toe** (9): I love how subversive this song is. Following my theory that this song explores Janelle's many identities, this clearly focuses on her national identity, and the legacy of America.

**Kaylaboe** (9): fuck trump

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Now, this is the protest song we‚Äôve all been waiting for. Americans is amazing precisely because it unites everybody struggling under Trump‚Äôs America (or under any country polluted by the same twisted ideologies that fill the States‚Äô political structures, for that matter) and its refusal to soften its message is a play-off that only makes Janelle resonate more powerfully with all of her target audiences. Taking down nearly all of the ideas that make America‚Äôs societal landscape such a mess today (she forgets capitalism, but come on, we were never going to hear that from the lips of even a semi-mainstream artist) Janelle delivers a thesis that‚Äôs more relevant to our times today than any line off the Declaration of Independence. It‚Äôs essentially an angrier, more political version of the rock songs off masterpieces like Purple Rain, and it makes me pump up my fist and breathe a sigh of relief. I don‚Äôt know if art really can change the world, but Americans shows you that art can both let loose some steam yet add fuel to the fire. Finally, perhaps this is a little selfish of me, but I love how Janelle samples a pastor preaching a more social justice oriented version of religion in the midst of Americans‚Äô wonderfully engaging tenure. I know that as somebody who belongs to a majority faith, I‚Äôm not supposed to be the centre of attention anymore, but for as little as I could find about the pastor who provides the voiceover in this song‚Äôs bridge, I‚Äôm incredibly happy that something actually resembling the tearing down of social and political barriers that Christianity is actually supposed to try and achieve is something that‚Äôs being voiced in a relatively well-known anthem. This is what I‚Äôm talking about when I say Americans brings people together, more so than any flag or formal creed could ever hope to ‚Äì no matter what sector of society you‚Äôre in, if you‚Äôve felt the anger and frustration being sounded out in this song, then you‚Äôll react just as happily and as madly as me and so many other people have to Janelle taking a much-needed stand at the end of Dirty Computer. Three cheers for Ms. Monae!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Ended racist, sexist and homophobic Americans

**nooodisaster** (8.5): This is the song Red from Us (2019) sings on a daily basis to practice talking.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): i‚Äôm not american but i like this

**gannade** (8): a funky little song but these lyrics :skull: this album wouldve been a lot more successful if it was a little less political and a bit more personal

**ManofOranges** (8): She snapped.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a bop, don't get me wrong, but I feel like it gets a lot of hype for how woke the lyrics are [and they are] and not because the music itself is really amazing. But still, it is a bop.

**Leixander** (7.5): Nice closer but I would've expected something stronger. Or maybe it doesn't hit me as much as others because I am not American.

**silkypanties22** (6): sounds like 80's movie outro

**passionfruits2** (0): Overrated.

deleted: Everyone who loved the album seems to love this song but I don't tbh. The prechoruses ("I pledge allegiance to the flag...") should have been doubled in length and then followed by a much better chorus. Also, why the trap drums during the bridge? They bring what should have been a powerful climax down to a weak simmer.

I love the message of the song and most of the verse lyrics, but if you're gonna go for a "Let's Go Crazy" vibe, you really need to up the energy and bite of the song. I feel like I'm being overly critical but I know Janelle could have done better if she tried

A beautifully orchestrated track, and a great opener. Unlike much of the rest of the album, this is not about a relationship with someone. Rather, it's about her relationship with music. The rest of the album shows that Mitski may have troubled romantic relationships with others, but this track shows how she's well off with the one thing that has brought her true happiness.

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (11): it was so, SO, so hard not to give my 11 to kacey. but  it had to go to this song. what a fucking tune. so incredibly powerful. it starts with this organ thing, and then brightens a little, before glitching while mitski hums beautiful lyrics over it. and then that subtle piano makes you feel WARM. and the tambourine kicks in. and then the organ thing comes back. the drums come in. guitar pulls. and BOOM it goes FULL FORCE and creates this beautiful sonic experience that is indescribable. i know nobody is like the decided favorite on BTC, but geyser deserve its spot. its seriously such a well-made, well-written, beautiful track (and my SOTY last year)

**theburningundead** (11): Mitski manages to pack so much into all of her songs but the way this song builds to that final chorus is really something special, it's a wonderful introduction to the album and a perfect summary of everything I love about her music

**vhqv1997** (11): I also want to throw myself into the sand digging away while whimpering and writhing on the beach so yeah this song is a big mood

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely gorgeous song; I adore songs with unconventional structures and Geyser pulls it off amazingly well. The way the song erupts halfway through like a geyser is genius and elevates the song to a whole new level.

**Awkward\_King** (10): it's so cinematic and yet so simple and raw

**Brendon-Urine** (10): This was a classic the day it came out. Such a brief song but it fits in SO much.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): absolutely majestic from the jumpscare intro to buildup of the climax. I'M A GEYSER FEEL IT BUBBLING FROM BELOW HEAR IT CALL HEAR IT CALL HEAR IT CALL TO ME CONSTANTLY!!!!!!

**enecks** (10): My god, this album is so invigorating and replayable. A bunch of short, perfectly realised songs. This is a real geyser of a song, building tension to a explosive climax of emotional catharsis. Also, this rocks hard. All the people doing "Rock is dead" takes just need to give talented women like Mistki the credit they deserve to see rock is fine.

**gothheart** (10): i'm a gayser for geyser

**kappyko** (10): I wrote something on thsi in the popheads jukebox lol but its still a great tension and release rock tune hopefully top ten

**leviswift13** (10): i decided to listen to this album based on the hype it stirred up on popheads and twitter the weekend it was released. i turned on the record and didn't pass this song for like 20 minutes. such an entrancing opener about love and coldness and infatuation and lonliness UGH

**ManofOranges** (10): Old faithful tea

**nooodisaster** (10): This is one of those "holy shit" songs. Where you listen to it and go "holy shit." Because, holy shit. In 2 minutes, this builds and climaxes more than some of yalls' favs' entire albums.

**Really\_Creative** (10): I love this song so much as an opener to the album, Mitski just knows how to take you places and the hauntingly gorgeous introduction just takes me there. The build up through to the triumphant climax of "I will be the one you need," is just outstanding.

**selegend** (10): masterpiece

**stansymash** (10): when she sings I WILL BE THE ONE YOU NEED i can't even describe what it does to me but god is definitely involved

**survivorjdmarina** (10): The guitars from 1:18 are fucking ACE

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Old Faithful is shaking. Seriously, though, this is a stellar, STELLAR song with an incredible buildup, some of her best yet most brief lyrics, and some of the album‚Äôs most interesting quirks, from the weird glitch in the beginning to the tension drifting at the end. It hints to something greater, but unfortunately for me that never really formulates. That said, this intro is just incredible.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): So intense. I just wish it was longer

**c-ming** (9): the change throughout the song is captured beautifully by the guitar, with mitski's vocals capturing the desperation that often comes with giving the whole of yourself to someone/thing

**Leixander** (9): Blasphemy, I know, but I start listening to this album from Why Didn't You Stop Me. The glitch voices sound horrible in my cheap headphones and give me jump-scares every time. Other than this unnecessary personal information, this song is great and just shows how incredible Mitski is about conveying her emotions into music, which is stale topic to state at this point but I will keep stating it on other songs over and over again because it NEEDS to be stated even more.

**waluigiest** (9): amazing start to the album

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I used this to open up a lesson on geysers once, and, boy, was it fun. Art pop songs based on natural and geographical have been done before by a certain lady from Iceland, but the problem with Biophillia was that despite its beauty, complexity and fascinating conceptual basis, the songs on it just weren‚Äôt supremely attention-grabbing enough to capture the hearts of many of Bjork‚Äôs casual fans. Now, I love Bjork, but compare that to Geyser, which is one of the songs that makes people check out Be The Cowboy, and we clearly have a winner. Despite Mitski‚Äôs relatively stoic voice, Geyser‚Äôs musical arrangement quite literally gushes forth so strongly and sweeps you with a level of passion and emotion that happens to be extremely hard not to visualize within one‚Äôs imagination. Heck, if I happened to be in a certain state of mind, possibly or possibly not coupled with the experience of being on something, I don‚Äôt doubt that listening to Geyser would unironically give me the sensation that I was being submerged in boiling water. That would probably make me die, but Geyser‚Äôd be a good one to go out on, so I‚Äôm not sure I would care very much.

**Roxieloxie** (8.9): This song almost ends too suddenly, but that could be intentional. Either way it's a fantastic opener

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): clearly the best song on this album. whew

**hikkaru** (7.5): the jumpscare at 0:27 holy FUCK i'm shaking

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): Bop but lowkey kinda hard to listen to cause the melody just gets wild

**frogaranaman** (7): Enjoyable, but also reminds me of that one interview where she makes sure to emphasize her Moby Dick reference when talking about this song.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It has good moments (especially the production build up) but it doesn‚Äôt grab me as much as I think it should

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a great intro! The synths are really mysterious, and then the guitar comes in and it sounds like a 90s alt-rock song, and then the chorus is epic .. and oh wait it's over.

**radiofan15** (6.7): FUCKING GLITcH it made me crap myself the first time I listened to the song

**silkypanties22** (6): I feel like it was overproduced, trying to be smart

**J\_Toe** (5): I wouldn't listen to this song if I had the choice.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (3): I think the lyrics on this are a bit clunky, like a lot of Mitski work. Great production though.

Everything is sex. Except sex, which is power. A common tenant of Freudian psychology, Monae brings the metphor up to 11 in this fun sounding pop song. Sex being seen as a power dynamic is a common theme, and Janelle uses it to it's fullest extent here. Taking this philosophy to extreme lengths makes this song sound incredibly unique, but also politically interesting as well. Now ask yourself, who's screwing you?

---
**Cubascastrodistrict** (11): This track is total genius. The sort of sassy sarcastic chorus, it's not too heavy handed or preachy in it's politics but it has a clear message. The part in the bridge (I think) where you just hear Zoe Kravitz (I think it's her) laugh and say "God we're so screwed" is amazing.

**nooodisaster** (11): this is my score for jane's dream.

**Roxieloxie** (11): This song is a work of art. It's truly a Chaotic good. It didn't even need the breakdown into django jane with that last verse but the fact that it was included just takes the song to the next level

**tapdancingpig** (11): YAY ZOE KRAVITZ! I‚Äôm so glad she can sing, I‚Äôve loved her in all the shitty movies I‚Äôve seen her in. Also this song is pretty ~~okay~~ fucking brilliant too.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): quite possibly the best song ever recorded

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Let's get NAILED!

**J\_Toe** (10): This song demonstrates Janelle's political identity. I absolutely love the pairing of Janelle and Zoe Kravitz. This song is such a perfect encapsulation of 2016-2018, and I feel is one of the many reasons why the album should have won AOTY.

**Really\_Creative** (10): Now ask yourself who's screwing this song in this rate

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is easily one of my favorites on the album, this song is so, so stellar. In 5 minutes, Janelle does more with the concept of apocalyptic escapism than Gorillaz did with a 50 minute album. This song speaks about so much, from sexual liberation, to gun violence, to political revolt, and does it all in a smart, mature way. And, it really helps that this is definitely the catchiest track on the album, with the stellar execution of the screwed double entendre to the very memorable prechorus. Oh, and that transition to Django Jane might be one of the best transitions of the entire decade, it‚Äôs truly special.

**vayyiqra** (10): The intro to this is so epic and the interlude is so cool! I love this song!

**vhqv1997** (10): Janelle and Leta Lestrange really and truly Avada Kedavra'd me with this song

**waluigiest** (10): horny!! Everything works: the double meaning, the bridge, the melodies..

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): screw ME queen

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i forgot how phenomenal the transition from this to django jane was. wowzers

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): The guitars sound spectacular on this album, and this track is no exception. The repetition within the lyrics work extremely well, and that transition into Django Jane? Iconic.

**stansymash** (9.3): the double meaning of screwed is maybe the most brilliant thing any human has ever done ever

**1998tweety** (9): A highlight from the album, Screwed blends politics and sexuality together quite well. There's something so primal about wanting to have sex when (under the illusion that) the world is ending, and I adore it. The rap verse blends in seamlessly and keeps the flow of the song rolling. My 2 caveats though are that the feature doesn't really feel needed (half the time I can't tell if it's Zoe singing since she sounds so similar to Janelle), and I did find some of the lyrics in the rap verse to miss the mark, but with all that aside it's a pretty solid tune.

**frogaranaman** (9): I want dick, yeah.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (9): "You fuck the world up now we'll fuck it all back down" goes through my head at least once a day

**passionfruits2** (9): When they say "Screwed!" it just makes me shake my ass uncontrolably.

**rosecoloreds** (9): Janelle and Zoe invented sex

**yourhostandpatron** (9): If you‚Äôre like me, Screwed‚Äôs bold declaration of ‚Äòeverything is sex, except sex, which is power‚Äô may have given you frightening flashbacks to Foucault. If you are not like me, you probably have the ability to enjoy Screwed‚Äôs brilliant, funk-inspired cynical brand of feminism. If that‚Äôs the case, I envy you. I‚Äôm not too familiar with Janelle‚Äôs larger body of work, but I have noticed that apocalyptic themes show up more than once on Dirty Computer, and it‚Äôs no more fun elsewhere than it is in Screwed, where Janelle gives us a radical treatise in the form of excellent music and solid exercises in making songs that inspire you to both chill and imagine some freaky fantasies at the same time. This is the power of Janelle Monae, and it‚Äôs power I wish I could appreciate. Unfortunately, I am always forced to submit to the will of the bald gay Frenchman. However, I will give this a 9 regardless.

**Leixander** (8): The riffs in the intro makes me go "AAAAAAAAAA" but after that it becomes repetitive quickly. Obligatory mention of the perfect transition to Django Jane.

**ryjomom** (8): SEX IS POWER bitches

**radiofan15** (7.8): I liked the chemistry, the production is flawless, the message is important and the verses are great but the chorus is kinda bland for a song with such a great potential and the rapping is underwhelming

**c-ming** (7): a fun bop with a fun pun

**plastichaxan** (7): I remember not liking this at first but it grew on me a lot

**silkypanties22** (7): trying to be in touch with modern society but lame lyrics, otherwise great instrumental ruined

**Brendon-Urine** (6): I remember why I was so disappointed when this album came out - so many of the songs are just meh.

**kappyko** (6): extra .5 cos i never realized how clever the lyrics are and how incisive that final line is

Awkward_King: > **Cubascastrodistrict** (11): This track is total genius. The sort of sassy sarcastic chorus, it's not too heavy handed or preachy in it's politics but it has a clear message. The part in the bridge (I think) where you just hear Zoe Kravitz (I think it's her) laugh and say "God we're so screwed" is amazing.

deleted: Ugh, this is hands down one of my favorite tracks out of all three albums. I don't like Janelle's verses at the very end (the lyrics are cheesy; same with some of the chorus) but everything else is amazing. I especially love when the lead guitar comes in after the 2nd chorus

By far my favorite song on Kacey's album. The pure acoustic sound and sometimes subtle wordplay in the verses make the song both easy to listen to, but also super interesting at the same time. The first song Kacey admitted to conciving of while tripping on LSD, it is wonderfully thoughtful. It perfectly encompasses one of the best writers currently in country music, while still showing her humility and self awareness.

---
**gannade** (11): putting this on during a sunny day while you casually stroll down the park, there is no better feeling

**ryjomom** (11): I swear I could go off my antidepressants if I listened to this song everyday

**WeastofEden44** (11): My bussy exploded when I heard this for the first time

**zekkyzach** (11): This song has been my go-to for calming nerves/dealing with general anxiety lately. Kacey and a couple other artists have played vital pseudo-therapeutic roles in my life lately and it's just nice feeling like someone gets you, even if they don't know you.

**1998tweety** (10): This song is so cute and wholesome, love it.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): can you SAY a perfect opener? and then three more times for everyone in the back

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Everything is just so great, from the guitar to the lyrics and the vocals.

**c-ming** (10): one of kacey's best songs, and i think it sets the stage for the rest of the album really well; i can't imagine listening to this song at any time other than sunset (golden hour). ethereal guitars

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): what an opener! "old soul waiting my turn/i know a few things but i still got a lot to learn" is one of those lines that always hits hard

**enecks** (10): Every lyrical detail is a 10.

**ExtraEater** (10): quintessential summer evening sunset sitting relaxing and just thinking about things music

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is gorgeous and is also a slow burn within itself. Her mind!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): God, what a fucking opening track......................... I love Kacey.

**kappyko** (10): The excellence the taste the talent served with the instrumentation... easily the BEST on this album! The drums kicking in the second verse with the strings later coming in is such a slay.... And the songwriting is excellent even if i have to push the "look at all the flowers" line into the back of my head

**Kaylaboe** (10): just so melodically gorgeous

**leviswift13** (10): what a way to open the album. like woooooooooooooooow. "grandma cried when i pierced my nose" is an all-timer of a lyric

**ManofOranges** (10): Fantastic opener to a fantastic album

**nooodisaster** (10): A stellar opener, and probably my favorite of the whole album. The lyrics are so personal and detailed, while still matching the intelligent and keen writing of her earlier work. The slightly ominous production is actually one of my favorite things about this, as it adds a great dimension and intrigue.

**plastichaxan** (10): Maybe country has made some points, or well, at least women in country have.

**Really\_Creative** (10): Why am I only allowed a single 11 in a rate that includes this, Screwed, Nobody, and High Horse???

**silkypanties22** (10): great song-writing right here

**survivorjdmarina** (10): The production is nice and spacey but what elevates this is how the song's about a drug trip, and I stan.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): she really didnt have to go that hard but she did

**radiofan15** (9.5): Fantastic opener... a slow burner indeed

**Leixander** (9): Apt title.

**passionfruits2** (9): This song was the one that got me into Kacey Musgraves. It's just perfect vocally, not a dry moment and so emotional.

**stansymash** (9): the squeaky clean production bothers me for approximately 10 seconds when i start this album and then after that i'm in love

**waluigiest** (9): a song that lets me find romance in the mundane and I love that

**yourhostandpatron** (9): From what I‚Äôve seen, a bunch of y‚Äôall are piling up to give this your 11s, and I can definitely understand the hype that you‚Äôre building. Slow Burn is the first Kacey song a lot of people in this rate have probably heard, unless they were introduced to her via High Horse, or, for all the country fans out there, Merry Go Round, and a bunch of lines here reveal Kacey‚Äôs character in an intriguing and pleasantly exciting manner. You understand that  Kacey is a rebellious country lady here in a way that‚Äôs considerably less political and more gentle than in songs like Follow Your Arrow, and that shows in lines like ‚Äògrandma cried when I pierced my nose‚Äô and ‚Äògood on a glass, good on green, good when you‚Äôre putting your hands all over me‚Äô that catch your interest right away. Those lines might sound a little like a pretentious white girl trying to be different from the wrong person, but aside from the fact that everybody trusts Kacey Musgraves, the entire atmosphere of Slow Burn in general is wise yet witty in a way that you‚Äôd expect from a thirty-year-old woman who knows her artistic stride. I‚Äôm ultimately not as captivated by Slow Burn as everybody else, but it‚Äôd be futile to deny that it‚Äôs a masterpiece.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Simply gorgeous.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This song truly is a slow burn. It‚Äôs innocent enough, but as it progresses, it just keeps getting better.

**vhqv1997** (8): Edging anthem

**frogaranaman** (7): Lazy spring afternoon spent laying the grass watching the clouds go by vibes.

**Roxieloxie** (7): my favorite fanfic trope

**vayyiqra** (7): This song kind of sets the tone for the album: pretty, but I don't love it.

**bespectacIed** (6): Overrated

**Cubascastrodistrict** (6): Really well written ballad. Strong opener.

High Horse had the biggest comeback of this rate. It bottomed out at #33 and hit a peak of #2. Unfortunately, it never quite got high enough to reach #1, and the only song it never got in front of was Nobody, by Mitski (at one point it was in front of Make Me Feel, more on that in a bit). A disco infused country smash, it has been deservedly praised by popheads since its release last year.

---
**hikkaru** (11): she snapped and i'm basic so a 11 it is

**ManofOranges** (11): One of the best songs I've heard at least when it comes to production. Sounds absolutely stunning.

**radiofan15** (11): She can say fagg\*t, specially after giving the gays everything they wanted

**silkypanties22** (11): lyrics are simple, relatable and original, production fits all the instruments in the best way, country guitars in breaks and in chorus are a breath of fresh air

**Awkward\_King** (10): oh it;'s still so good, everything about it just so good ugh. pop ur ass to it

**bespectacIed** (10): this is less country than old town road

**c-ming** (10): melding disco and country over a groovy bassline and quotable lyrics, this song is a brilliant kiss-off to doubters and those living in their ivory towers. perhaps this song is a continuation of space cowboy.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): G I D D Y U P

**enecks** (10): POP COUNTRY SHOULD BE THIS. THIS IS BETTER DISCO THAN MOST DISCO, AND BETTER COUNTRY THAN MOST COUNTRY. THIS IS PERFECTION.

**tapdancingpig** (9): I really hope this isn‚Äôt the only Kacey track that makes it to day 3. ACOUSTIC SONGS ARE GOOD TOO! Anyway, disco country needs to happen.

**vhqv1997** (9): We r/discoheads boys

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Disco and country is a combination that I‚Äôm sure‚Äôs been executed many times during the wild west we all like to call the 70s, but that seemingly baffling combination (they‚Äôre not so incompatible when you think about it, but putting disco together with country sees funny when you consider the reason why disco lost popularity in the first place) is what drew this subreddit towards Golden Hour, and though we may all be a little tired of basic white gays calling this song the best on the album now, High Horse is still a fantastic little pick-up near the end of a cohesive record. The camp here is surprisingly subtle yet delightful, and the groove is unmatched by all but titans when it comes to popular music. A more creative song than it seems, and a much better one than what you may think it to be.

**1998tweety** (8): This is a bop but y'all overate it so much lmao. The lyrics aren't anything special and honestly the chorus could punch just a little more. Still bops though

**frogaranaman** (8): Very infectious, almost like the snobby people Kacey is talking about in political science class discussions.

**J\_Toe** (8): still salty this won the "H" slot on the popheads alphabet

**Leixander** (7): This is highly revered and I can see why, but the other songs in this album deserve more love.

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a bop, but it isn't a good thing to me that the song that I like best on the album is the one that sounds nothing like the rest of it.

**Roxieloxie** (6.5): yeehaw but make it roller derby

**nooodisaster** (6): I know this is a popheads favorite, and it's definitely cute and fun! I just wish this was 10x more uptempo to really yeehaw out to.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (5): I actually like this song, it's fun. Disco is a good vibe for Kacey.

**poppinmmolly** (5): this is just so out of place on this album. It takes you out of the vibe of the album. I'm a lyrics person and these lyrics are very weak imo. I skip this song.

static_int_husp: # Golden Hour

---

**Overall average**: 8.229

---

**Leixander**: Be The Cowboy by Kacey's perspective.

**ExtraEater**: A sunny day as an album

**WeastofEden44**: Taylor Swift found run over by a tractor

**Krogan\_Whisperer**: Kacey Musgraves is the antidote to bro country that we need

**TragicKingdom1**: Ethereal and extremely calming. Kacey is super talented in all regards and there really isn't a weak moment here. A very worthy AOTY winner. [Grade: A]

**stansymash**: the most soothing album i think i've ever heard

**Really\_Creative**: 9.6 An absolute masterpiece and living proof that country music CAN be good with magical honesty and authenticity. There are no songs on this album where I feel like Kacey is being anything but her most authentic self, and her art absolutely shines through.

**J\_Toe**: dull

**mokitsu**: AOTY period..

**vayyiqra**: I already know I don't fit in on r/popheads, so I am okay with being a contrarian and giving this album a [relatively] low score. I get the appeal of it on an intellectual level, I just don't like it. It sets a nice, relaxing mood and some of it is very pretty, but about half of the songs are super corny and I think some of the lyrics leave a lot to be desired. I do like it better than Same Trailer, Different Park which we rated last year. Also, the cover is beautiful. Still, I feel this album is very overrated. Overall rating: 5.5.

**cloudbustingmp3**: GODly Hour winning AOTY at the Grammys is proof that talent does indeed win sometimes

**frogaranaman**: This is cute.

**Kaylaboe**: I mentioned in my comments for Oh, What a World that this album is therapy in music form. And that's very true ‚Äì¬†this album manages to make me feel comforted, warm and at the same time on the verge of sobbing, but all without ever feeling melancholic. It's just such a pure album and the melodies are just incredibly lush throughout this entire record

**yourhostandpatron**: 2018 turned out to be a year with fewer critically acclaimed albums than some would hope for, but along with the other two records in this rate, Golden Hour stands as a body of work that deserves to be in that precious handful. Though it was one of the few albums I decided to immediately listen to last year after it started to get traction in musical circles, true to its title track, Kacey Musgraves‚Äôs commercial breakthrough was less of a first-listen favourite to me and more of a slow burn. I definitely liked Golden Hour the first time I heard it, but as the months went by and I started to revisit it several more times, the album‚Äôs beauty stood out to me more and more as I grew more comfortable with its nature and sonic landscape. I will say that Golden Hour might not be as lyrically sharp as Kacey‚Äôs previous material, nor as perfect of a bridge into attaining an interest in country as some would expect, but my fondness for it only increases more with age. And it‚Äôs only been a year!

**kanyewestrep\_**: yee haw

**survivorjdmarina**: Kacey definitely deserves the growing fanbase she has, and this album is an example of that.

**nooodisaster**: in which i roast kacey musgraves for 44 minutes. I know by now ppl probably hate me, but let me just say: I gave Merry Go Round a 10 in the Winner's rate & thought it was robbed, so I was honestly really excited for this album. Let's just say this was not my tea.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: her big fat yee haw fucking mind.... it amazes me...

**kappyko**: loved it at first still love it now tbh just a couple of songs im not as hot on anymore

**1998tweety**: My fav album in the rate, lots of strong highlights and not many weak songs.

Poor, poor Mitski. This song was on top for the longest time. It even stayed in first place for a while with *two zeroes*. For a while, it seemed that nobody could beat Nobody. But, over the last two weeks of the rate, Nobody dies a slow, painful death with Make Me Feel and High Horse getting tons of 10s and 11s, and Mitski getting a bunch of 8s. Eventually, the song that could have won even with two zeroes to it's name ended up losing by so much that it still would have lost even without two zeros. Personally, I really love the song. The simplicity of the chorus, which some saw as a weakness, I see as one of it's best fetures. Each utterance of the word "Nobody" contains a specific emotion, ranging from longing, to anger, to depression. It so effortlesssly shows how do deliver emotional vocal range in a song, that I was so disapointed when I realized it would lose, even though it meant my 11 would win.

---
**Awkward\_King** (11): this must be number 1. m u s t

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): every little detail of this is just... so well thought out. the cymbal intro, the way instruments come in piece by piece. the subtle synth that sneaks around. the Nile Rodgers-esque guitar. that one double clap after "and STILL nobody wants me." the way the drops out before zooming into the key change(S! plural!). her vocal performance is what really sells it though. loneliness turned into euphoria turned into desperation. this is ART!

**didney-worl** (11): SOTY

**enecks** (11): Is this the most perfect song ever recorded this decade? Yes. Every lyric hits. Every moment in the performance hits. The production is Random Access Memories-level perfection. Like oh my god. I'm crying so hard. Mitski what did we do to deserve you saving music. The repetition of nobody works incredibly well with the syncopation. I'm crying so hard but also smiling. NO BODY N O BODY NO BODY NOBODY . The end is so tragic. Away from the veneer of optimism, the nobodys sound desperate. It's a call for help. It's an anthem of isolation. Please somebody save me. It's an anthem to mortality and isolation. It's the universe in a song. Compress the human condition into a song and you get this. But Mitski finds the JOY AND THE PAIN. This is an eldritch song - to look at it is to be emotionally overwhelmed on a cosmic level. I can't explain why I like this. But this sets off some millenia-old thoughts. Maybe isolation is the most human of all human experiences.

**foxxglove\_** (11): nobody nobody NOBODY

**gothheart** (11): i really don't know if i can put how i feel about this into words. it's just pure excellence in every sense of the word. no...bo..dy...

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (11): Will be sadgrooving to this song all week thanks

**Leixander** (11): Isn't it amazing that each time she says "Nobody" you sense a different emotion in her voice? You can hear sadness in one, anger in other,  despair in another.

**leviswift13** (11): literally one of the greatest songs of all time. probably the best song of the century about lonliness. the hook is undeniable. the lyrics are genius. like just the idea of a sad, euphoric, manic disco song about crippling lonliness is genius in and of itself, but with this execution it is beyond genius. such a song.

**plastichaxan** (11): Other songs in this rate really didn't stand a chance for me, when she says Nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody oooO nobody nobody nobody I really felt that.

**Really\_Creative** (11): This song will be taught in Psychology courses in 30 years and we'll be better as a society for it

**rootbeer\_surge** (11): this gets my 11 solely for that key change at the end

**stansymash** (11): it was when i saw that Genius video of her explaining the lyrics that I realised thing song is perfect and this album was gonna be the best (which it was)

**waluigiest** (11): when it‚Äôs 3pm and I‚Äôm sprawled across my bed, scrolling between four different dating apps

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): a secured lonely bop

**bespectacIed** (10): Spare some one good movie kiss, ma'am! (p.s. I wanted to give this an 11 so bad but I'm whipped for janelle)

**c-ming** (10): when i first heard this song, it struck me how much yearning and desperation was packed into upbeat, catchy song. the melodic chorus appears to be something sung just to comfort herself and make herself feel less lonely, but the repeated refrain only gets sadder and sadder with each iteration, especially when set against the bright instrumentals

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ugh, I didn't want to be a basic ass bitch and give the one song everyone memes about a 10 but this song is definitely a 10 and my fave from this album and I feel all the \*actual\* Mitski stans being mad at this opinion

**kappyko** (10): man somebody gave this a 0 didnt they. anyways if u liked out of the woods theres no reason to not stan this and if u didnt like out of the woods well idk

**Kaylaboe** (10): noBOdy NObody nobodYY nooobody nobooody oooh

**PuggleMaster** (10): The only song on this album that spoke to me tbh. The global warming quote gives me chills

**rotating3Dtext** (10): THIS SONG hit me like a freight train when I finally listened to it late last year

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song also feels like when your spiraling out of your mind and just overwhelmed with too much

**ryjomom** (10): https://behlerblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/mr-nobody.jpg

**survivorjdmarina** (10): What I like a lot about this track is the simplicity of the lyrics. They‚Äôre not overly complicated while also describing the emotion of feeling lonely perfectly. The production gives it an amazing disco vibe as well.

**vhqv1997** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC7kwEp-Oo4

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): A sad relatable bop.

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Nobody is Be The Cowboy‚Äôs most popular song by far, and perhaps the one that only receives some sort of mainstream interest, with Geyser just maybe holding on for breath behind its back. I‚Äôve always seen Nobody as one of the most solid songs on the album, but I‚Äôve never gotten why its chorus of ‚ÄòNobody, nobody, nobody‚Äô is such a highlight until some time ago when I looked at its single cover. Yeah, I haven‚Äôt seen its music video. I just looked at its single cover. Go fight me. From just the image Mitski painted on the cover alone ‚Äì the woman herself hunched behind a car wheel during the late hours of the night, with a fascinatingly Burton-esque  font accompanying her, I‚Äôve managed to pin down the exact spot of loneliness Nobody captures in the minds of its biggest fans. It‚Äôs not a loneliness I‚Äôve ever fit in with exactly, but it‚Äôs a loneliness I‚Äôve been adjacent to, and it‚Äôs a loneliness I think deserves representation in music this fantastic. Nobody may or may not be the pinnacle of what Mitski makes work on Be The Cowboy, but it was always going to be the song that‚Äôd reach out to audiences the most, and that, on its own, is a commendable quality. I might prefer Remember My Name or Pink In The Night, but I bet that, in time, I‚Äôll grow to love the quaint shade Nobody casts, too.

**1998tweety** (9): I'm gonna be honest, you guys overrated this song just a little bit. There are at least 2 songs on the album better than this. With that being said though, it's still great and the lyrics are so so relatable and sad and depressing and amazing.

**J\_Toe** (9): yeah, i like it enough

**radiofan15** (9): FINALLY A SONG WITH A NORMAL LENGHT... AND A GOOD SONG TO COMPLEMENT... it would be a 7 on other circunstamces but it's surrounded by so much shit it deserves a 10... well, it deserved until that fucking awful outro

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The opening verse of this song is so so good, like why can‚Äôt the rest of this record match up? She‚Äôs got this whole old movie aesthetic thing going on and it almost feels scrapped outside of a few songs and the singles.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): You can just tell this is a highlight of the album within seconds.

**hikkaru** (8): kinda overrated tbh but it's still good

=====

static_int_husp: **Cubascastrodistrict** (7): Mitski's highnote on "people" actually hurts me. I love the melody in the chorus. The piano after the chorus works here (still it's the fourth time it's been used in the exact some way, I just like it this time). I love the second chorus. She's singing and she doesn't sound bored! It reaches an emotional climax and has an outro. Best song on the album so far.

**silkypanties22** (7): interesting mix of genres

**ManofOranges** (6.5): I did not like this song at all for a long long long time. And now... I still don't really. I've warmed up to it a little bit but I don't think it's the stellar masterpiece that others would maybe call it. Overall an average song.

**letsallpoo** (6): +1 point for birthing that roblox video

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): an ok meme song

**vayyiqra** (6): I was going to say I like the part when she says "nobody" a lot, but by the end of the song it was becoming rather grating.

**frogaranaman** (0): It‚Äôs really interesting that, like, people try and tell me the songwriting on this album is out of this world when she literally copy / pasted her way through the entire thing like she had an english essay due in 12 minutes.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (0): Me and My Husband was my original 0. This started off strong, I was thinking maybe a 4.5, then it drifted down to a 4 and then a 3. And then it got to that weird disco bit and I was just done. None of this is making sense to me. It all sounds atonal, but this was the worst offender.

static_int_husp: # Be The Cowboy

---

**Overall average**: 7.887

---

**Leixander**: Yee bawl

**Cubascastrodistrict**: Well, I liked parts of this album. It comes off pretty amateurish to me. A lot of the melodies and lyrics seem forced and unpolished. Only a few songs really felt complete to me. Idk I don't get the hype.

**ExtraEater**: I prefer Puberty 2 but I love the brevity of all of these songs and how crisp it all is. Good album but I know it's going to be the least well-rated of the three.

**enecks**: Hey it's an actual masterpiece

**WeastofEden44**: I liked most of it

**Krogan\_Whisperer**: This is pretty much my intro to Mitski, and honestly I fuck with this

**McIgglyTuffMuffin**: This entire album, from the production to the song lengths, sounds like half baked demos and it makes me want to rip my hair out. Songs would end just as they were about to get interesting in most cases, Pink in the Night is a huge example of this. The big bass drum notes come in and you think it will build to something, but it doesn't. Except for the opening track, that had my attention right away. But I was lied to straight off the bat, I thought I was getting into a new and fantastic experience. Instead it left me insanely frustrated as the album went on. This entire album was just a very unpleasant experience for me. I've never listened to Mitski before and this album doesn't make me want to explore anymore of her. Her reminds me of Amanda Palmer, except Amanda is making music that I actually want to listen to.

**TragicKingdom1**: I love Mitski's general sound and there's nothing bad here but it kinda drags even when almost every song is less than 3 minutes long. If it had a bit more curation in the tracklisting then it would be one of my favorite albums of the year, but it's more of an honorable mention as is. [Grade: A-]

**gothheart**: i became the cowboy, yeehaw folx

**stansymash**: i'm an indieheads transfer student and mitski is the biggest icon over in our school

**Really\_Creative**: 9.4 This album is so good at meshing conflicting moods and styles and forming some very complicated but powerful emotional feelings. It's a distinctive direction for Mitski compared to her prior work, but one that I personally appreciate. She's that bitch and she deserves all the success in the world.

**vhqv1997**: This album is depression compressed. My reaction to literally every song is just "mood", and honestly, mood.

**mokitsu**: well it's not as good as it was when it came out that's for sure

**vayyiqra**: I have a ... complicated relationship with Mitski. She was first recommended to me in 2015, by someone I no longer talk to, because they knew I liked Lana Del Rey (???). I didn't listen to her until last year or so, when I tried Puberty 2 and found it ... really boring. I've listened to several of her albums, some a few times, and just can't get into her even though I want! to like! her!. This is the one I liked the most, though. Overall rating: 5.8.

**cloudbustingmp3**: had Rosalia not released the Album of the Decade near the end of last year this would've been my AOTY 2018. the perfect example of cohesive versatility tbh

**frogaranaman**: Brokeback Mountain was better.

**yourhostandpatron**: I have a strong fear that Popheads is going to slaughter this album, and the various complains I‚Äôve heard towards how unusual and brief Mitski‚Äôs music sings towards the majority of our subreddit‚Äôs population don‚Äôt do anything to quench my anxiety. I do understand why Be The Cowboy won‚Äôt immediately connect with the majority of people doing this rate compared to how much Dirty Computer will resonate with all the marginalized folks participating or how the classic country sounds of Golden Hour are going to approach familiar, yet exciting and comforting territory to my fellow listeners, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt deserve the right to be frustrated about how a lot of people don‚Äôt get this record! Be The Cowboy is an album that grows stronger with familiarity and understanding, and that‚Äôs precisely because it‚Äôs another show of Mitski‚Äôs tendency to turn descriptions of specific thoughts and moments frozen in time and swept up into a temporal ocean into fantastic, briefly incredible songs by converting feelings to musical form. Her combination of indie rock and art pop on Be The Cowboy is an artistic decision that attracts more listeners without sacrificing creativity, and her entire aesthetic of moodiness without dipping into farcical despair is a perfect balance that tons of people‚Äôve been clamouring for so long. And, yes, maybe I am just excited at the fact that an Asian woman is receiving this much attention! No, I won‚Äôt get my hopes high up for how y‚Äôall are going to treat Be The Cowboy, but I hope some of you are going to go back to it and give it another chance. This is a clich√© phrase by now, but it‚Äôs the sonic definition of what a grower should be. And, boy, is it one of the best musical growers that I‚Äôve ever heard!

**survivorjdmarina**: I liked this album when I first listened to it, but for some reason I‚Äôm not feeling it as much. The singles are still ace though.

**nooodisaster**: yuh

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD**: very........ samey

**strawberryswing1**: This album is weird and was hard to rate. It's not bad but I won't be revisiting it.

**kappyko**: turns out this was my favorite album all along oops

**1998tweety**: I like the album, but I feel like a lot of the songs are way too short and don't give you enough time to actually get into them and form opinions about them.

Make Me Feel is possibly the funkiest song of 2018, and maybe even the 2010s as a whole. Prince, who was an influential mentor for Janelle, helped produce this song before he passed three years ago, and it shows. The guitar has been compared to his song "Kiss", which is an extrmely fair comparison. Prince was one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, and this song cements Ms. Monae as the person who will carry on his legacy into the current generation. The song is just so funky, so sexy, that there is literally nothing you can do when it comes on than just groove with it. Also ranked the #1 song by /r/popheads at the end of last year, it is a fitting winner to this rate.

---
**bespectacIed** (11): This will only be my first 11 to win :((( Pop perfection as pop perfection goes.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This is the easiest 11 I have given in a rate. This song is pop perfection. It‚Äôs super catchy, groovy, fun and clever. I absolutely love the Prince influence on this, but at the same it‚Äôs 100% Janelle. This song deserved so much more success and should have been a massive hit.

**J\_Toe** (11): Following my theory that this album chronicles the facets of Janelle's complete identity, this song is clearly an affirmation of queer identities. This is clear in a video which makes use of bi-lighting and lyrics that represent her pansexuality. Also, it is super fun and hella catchy. Favourite song in the rate!

**kappyko** (11): this deserves to win more than anything else in this rate even if i stan mitski 4 the culture. once upon a time there was a man who said julia michaels understands prince better than janelle monae does. i dont listen to prince enough to verify this statement but it made me scream

**PuggleMaster** (11): This is such an ICONIC song that i'm sure will be sabotaged of the win

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I remember when this first dropped, I was like, the queen is coming back

**skargardin** (11): Our mod snapped hard.

**survivorjdmarina** (11): I mean, what other song could I possibly give an 11 to? Definitely one of my favourite tracks of last year, and one of my most played on Spotify. The lyrics, the production, the vocals. All amazing.

**1998tweety** (10): I already know this song is gonna win the rate, but despite that, I can't justify giving it any lower than a 10. The song is so groovy and it's probably the song that stands the best outside of the film context.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): obviously this is gonna win and im not MAD about it but id choose differently

**Awkward\_King** (10): yes

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Truly a crown jewel of pop music. Janelle went off on this song and the world is better for it. It was SO hard to not give this my 11 but I had to save it

**c-ming** (10): channeling prince and jackson on the same track isn't an easy feat, but monae does it perfectly. between the catchy bass line, the panting 'ah-ah's, and initial coyness transitioning into a desperate begs and declarations, this song simultaneously makes me feel powerful and sexy

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): that grammy performance... but WOW what a moment!

**enecks** (10): Best pop song robbed of being a hit in 2018? Maybe so. This is the bisexual funky masterpiece that should've been the jewel in the crown of a pop revitalisation. But nah, radio's got a 6ix9ine song to push.

**ExtraEater** (10): bicon

**frogaranaman** (10): Absurdly good.

**gothheart** (10): and this one makes me pansexual

**hikkaru** (10): the clear winner tbh!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We stan the winner, that will probably be sabotaged by people who call it overrated and will try to use that to justify their 2 they gave it.

**Kaylaboe** (10): bicon

**Leixander** (10): Almost perfection.

**ManofOranges** (10): I got chills the first time I heard this song. And I still do. Wig.

**nooodisaster** (10): the prechorus to this is powerful enough to send a (wo)man to the moon.

**passionfruits2** (10): One of my favorite 2018 songs, and my favorite Janelle song. It's just the way it makes me feel you know? :>

**radiofan15** (10): SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THAT HARD BUT SHE DID AND NOW HERE WE ARE, STILL LOOKING OUT LOST WIGS!

**Roxieloxie** (10): TwentyBiTeen Babey

**strawberryswing1** (10): Prince is a great artist

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I would actually be incredibly shocked if this doesn‚Äôt win. And it should. It may not be my favorite song on the record, but it‚Äôs loved for a reason - from the smart, stunning prechorus to the catchy, funky chorus, everything about this song works so well to be a summer staple for the socially conscious. It‚Äôs the most infectious moment on the record, and

**waluigiest** (10): this song is wet and so am I

**stansymash** (9.4): god damn!

**leviswift13** (9): funk pop perfection; the pre-chorus is EVERYTHING

**Really\_Creative** (9): I actually don't think this song holds up as well as songs like CCL, Screwed, or Pynk but it's still fun and quality and the climax of the song is so much fun

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Holy shit, why does Janelle inherit the talents of so many iconic musicians? Her futuristic themes and use of characters in her music already called back a lot to David Bowie, which is already one titan in itself, but she really decides to amp the Prince influence up on Dirty Computer (heck, it‚Äôs not just an influence, considering the fact that Prince was actually a part of the album‚Äôs recording) and the end result of this all is Make Me Feel, which is absolutely freaking fantastic. We‚Äôve needed a bisexual anthem that‚Äôs as empowering and as liberated as this song for a long time, and, oh, boy, does Janelle fucking deliver. Sure, there‚Äôs nothing explicitly queer in the song‚Äôs lyrics (which bear the mark of Prince on them, by the way) aside from the phrase ‚Äòsexual bender‚Äô, but coupled with the music video, the gay energy here has me quaking. The only conclusion I get after listening to Make Me Feel is that Janelle is a talented badass, and that you can be one, too! What a song‚Ä¶what a song.

**tapdancingpig** (8): This is not my favorite song on the album, but I feel like this may be the song y‚Äôall rally behind to give Janelle a win. And yeah, this song is a bop and a half.

**vayyiqra** (8): [Obligatory comment about how much this sounds like a Prince song] Oh yeah and the video was pretty cool too. Bisexual lighting is my favourite a e s t h e t i c.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (7): Fun, very derivative obviously but i know that's intentional. Great video.

**ryjomom** (7): I‚Äôd rather have a mashup of Britney Spears‚Äô Make Me... and Calvin Harris‚Äô Feels

**silkypanties22** (7): a bit annoying use of samples

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (4): This song just feels all Prince and no Janelle, and I know he helped produce it before he died, but it just sounds TOO much like a Prince song

deleted: This song is the 21st century "Kiss" analog that we deserve, and we are truly blessed to have Janelle sing it for us. I hope artists keep emulating Prince so that we'll never have a shortage of unabashedly sexy & cool funk in this world. Even if Prince himself wasn't the greatest person at times, he was a musical groundbreaker and I love seeing people like Janelle carry his torch while also trying to make the world a more empathetic, inclusive, and beautiful place.

static_int_husp: # Dirty Computer

---

**Overall average**: 8.209

---

**Leixander**: Feels really calculated to capitalize on her post-Oscars fame. While I like the message of the songs, they feel too preachy and I feel like she did this shtick better in her previous albums. I also realized I am not a fan of the rap verses now. Her verse in the song Q.U.E.E.N. was better and felt more organic compared to the verses(if I have to be specific about the verses I don't like: the last verse on Crazy, Classic, Life & last few verses in Screwed which I despise and would skip if the perfect transition to Django Jane didn't exist, Django Jane is nice but it feels too out of place for some reason) in this one. This album's highs (Take A Byte, Make Me Feel, So Afraid, I Like That) are better than most of the songs in The Electric Lady (which I realized I like more than Dirty Computer overall) but her best album is still Archandroid hands down. After all the things I said, I must state that I still love this album but I think the other two albums in this rate deserve their praise way more.

**Cubascastrodistrict**: a 10/10 album. Brilliant.

**ExtraEater**: The movie is as great as the album is

**enecks**: This is so frustrating. A couple of removed songs and I would join the masses in calling this a masterpiece.

**WeastofEden44**: Janelle ended homophobia

**Krogan\_Whisperer**: Doesn't top Archandroid for me, and I'm not sure where it ranks with Electric Lady, but I still love it

**TragicKingdom1**: Diverse genres, Janelle exhibits much talent, really nothing bad to say about it. It's not as "high art" as The ArchAndroid or Electric Lady but it doesn't need to be. [Grade: A+]

**gothheart**: i'm just a dirty computer sir

**stansymash**: i'm so glad this has widened her audience, but its big not enough and will never be enough

**Really\_Creative**: 9.2 A wonderful, amazing blend of political commentary and straight up art. This album is cohesive, fun, but also poignant and gorgeous. Dirty Computer is everything y'all.

**mokitsu**: i can't stand this puta. one of the most overrated albums in a long time. she thinks she's doing something but her message comes across and cringey and forced, with tired production that tricks people into thinking it's avant garde but really is about 2 years late. thank u, next.

**vayyiqra**: This was probably my third favourite album of last year [after Kimbra's Primal Heart and Lykke Li's so sad so sexy, both of which y'all slept on, especially the latter]. There isn't much I can say about it that's original, but it deserved to win the Grammy for album of the year. Also, Janelle is our moderator and queen, so she had better win this rate, or at least do well in it. My searing hot take is that this is the only album in this rate that is actually good. Overall rating: 7.8.

**frogaranaman**: I'm crying, she really did that folks.

**Kaylaboe**: Where do we even begin? Musician, actor, singer, songwriter, dancer, rapper, director, visionary, popheads mod and beloved Janelle has crafted a masterpiece both musically and visually. It‚Äôs much more accessible and concise than her first two albums, yet it‚Äôs still incredibly Janelle. I must admit I wasn‚Äôt very huge on it on my first few listens ‚Äì I adored the singles (with the exception of Pynk) and the rest of the tracks just weren‚Äôt up to that very high standard. Fortunately I came to my senses after a while, especially after watching the e‚Ä¢mo‚Ä¢tion picture accompanying the album.

**yourhostandpatron**: I like the other two records in this rate more than Dirty Computer, but with all due respect to Kacey and Mitski, Dirty Computer is inarguably the best musical representation of the catastrophe of our times, and perhaps the most deserving of the label of a codifying body of work featuring a collective, incredibly relevant perspective that dominated the world in 2018. It‚Äôs a record sung by a black, queer lady, with some help from a long-gone act that left the building with many other legends associated with marginalized peoples a few years ago, and even if I have some small criticisms of how Janelle voices her messages or how well some musical aspects of this record are executed, as an entire album, Dirty Computer just works so well for the times! And the crazy thing about it all is that it‚Äôs evidently an album that‚Äôll still be relevant throughout the future, with some tiny exceptions (hey, Pynk, I‚Äôm looking at you). Is that a good or a bad thing? That‚Äôs up to you ‚Äì I‚Äôd be somewhere in the middle ground, for what it‚Äôs worth ‚Äì but that only shows how amazing Dirty Computer is. I‚Äôve warmed up more and more to it recently, and now I‚Äôm interested in checking the rest of Janelle‚Äôs music out. Queer ladies of colour stay shining, as usual!  :kisskiss:

**survivorjdmarina**: This album was one of my favourites from last year, and for good reason. It incorporates political and noteworthy lyrics into funky, soulful, 1960-70s esque production, and that to me is a very colorful and enjoyful music blend.

**nooodisaster**: the crazy thing is I could give this album straight 10s and you couldn't even judge me for voting fraud, it's that good.

**kappyko**: I love u janelle im so sorry ill listen to the archandroid eventually. remember that leak that included a fake song with kamasi washington titled pussy poppin

**1998tweety**: There definitely are a lot of solid tracks on this album, but I personally feel like its a bit overrated and could've used a bit more polish on pushing its message and vision.

deleted: I said something similar the other day, but I think this album could have genuinely been a masterpiece if she tightened up the screws. The production is too reliant on modern trends at times, some of the songs feel undercooked and could have used stronger lyrics/melodies, and a few of the song transitions were fumbled. Yet, the album as a whole was still fun to listen to and was my favorite of 2018.

Janelle is ridiculously talented and has a unique vision, I just think she could benefit from working with some new producers/songwriters to edit her music and take it to the next level. I hope she takes more risks next time instead of playing it safe, because the general public already proved they'll sleep on her no matter how accessible she is anyway

J_Toe: So, when I participate in these rates I try to be 'fair'. Meaning: I personally love Dirty Computer and consider it one of my fav albums of all time. Whereas I am lukewarm on Be The Cowboy and hate Golden Hour. So to be 'fair' I thought I would give the later two albums higher scores for being well produced for what their genre is.

BUT

After seeing Golden Hour, my least favourite of the three, dominate made me realise I should have voted how I truly felt. There are clearly enough people here who love her that there is no harm in me handing out all the 3s and 4 I thought her album deserved.

vayyiqra: I knew that *Golden Hour* would get inflated because of the hype so I was okay giving it lower scores like how I truly felt, but I was also shocked Mitski did so badly. I wouldn't have given her higher scores because of it, but it shows how rates are fickle and the results are unpredictable, so it's important to always vote honestly and neither sabotage or inflate scores.
