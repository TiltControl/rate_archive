frogaranaman: I was drunk last night and went to check my scores then realized that I, also drunkenly, changed some of my scores before submitting. So, uh, sorry for my 0..

~~I would have given it a 5 or a 6, but I guess I saw my comment and thought, "that's 0 worthy!", then changed it..~~

This is the first Mitski song I feel was truly robbed. The fierce electric guitar makes this one of the hardest songs on the record. Even with that, Mitski gives us some very good, introspective lyrics about leaving a legacy. No one wants to die, and leaving a legacy seems one of the best ways to "stay alive", no matter how futile it is.

---
**enecks** (10): I love this guitar tone. Also that hook is so perfect. mm yass .

**kappyko** (10): a bop that will be like bottom 5 cos of that initial guitar tone lol

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Proof that people who say rock and roll is dead are mistaken

**Leixander** (10): This hits close to home.

**gothheart** (9.5): i feel like the last part kinda drags it down the tiniest bit but the part where she says remember my name... so good

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Despite the stronger presence of a pop influence here than on Mitski’s previous records, I’d argue that Be The Cowboy still sticks true to its indie rock roots, and Remember By Name in particular is a song I regard as special in that regard. It’s a perfect example of how Be The Cowboy’s songs create such an impact of you despite their brevity. In Remember My Name, Mitski displays a level of desire ad unabashedness that I’ve been waiting to hear from an Asian girl all my life. The traditional sense of rebellion that comes with rock is evidently present in Remember My Name’s melody, and these elements of the song come together to make me hold love for it in my heart.

**Roxieloxie** (9): this song feels like disassociating at a party

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): how can she understand me like that. just libra stuff

**1998tweety** (8.5): I like the guitars on this even though they got a bit weird and PC-like at some points; the lyrics are very nice though.

**radiofan15** (8.5): Screw it... this sounds like a Pixies song and that's enough for me

**letsallpoo** (8): this is ten percent luck

**leviswift13** (8): i love how willing she is to show the ugly parts of her psyche. the honesty is pretty moving tbh

**vhqv1997** (8): The instrumentals made me think I listened to an early Fall Out Boy song by mistake

**rosecoloreds** (7.5): big mood right there

**c-ming** (7): the chorus steals the show

**nooodisaster** (7): The lyrics are really clear and powerful, but I feel like this reaches for 11 and only gets to a 6.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Again, not a whole lot to say tbh

**waluigiest** (7): this song is big. Maybe bigger than it needs to be but still neat

**Cubascastrodistrict** (6): This song actually seemed to reach it's emotional climax, I like that.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the selfishness JUMPED out

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Another track with some decent ideas but this one almost seems too long? Like it’s 2 minutes but not much happens and my favorite riff of the song is easily at the beginning and the song never gets that momentum again sadly enough.

**vayyiqra** (6): I'm kind of bopping to this, so it's better than the last two tracks, but it's still [pun not intended] nothing memorable.

**frogaranaman** (4): The only good thing about these songs being so short is that they’re over before they even start.

This intro teetred on the edge between day 1 and day 2 at the end, but it finally pulled through at the very last minute. Brian Wilson's vocals, while underutilized, are still the best part of this song. As an intro to the album, it could use a litte bit of work as a thesis, but is otherwise pretty good.

---
**Awkward\_King** (10): i had this as a 9 then when i played it again for the first time in a little while to re-rate things i immediately changed it to a 10. the opening gives me fucking chills i love it sm

**CreepyMannequin** (10): I feel like this song gets underrated due to its length, but I could listen to it all day. Everything about it is immaculate.

**gothheart** (10): a warm, cleansing hug

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This fucking intro omg the melodies and the harmonies omg they both fucking snapped

**passionfruits2** (10): One of the best album openers in 2018, no doubt.

**PuggleMaster** (10): One of the only intros I listen to in full

**radiofan15** (10): wish it was longer BUT it still really catchy and dreamy... like HOLY SHIT THAT CHORUS IS GONNA GET STUCK ON MY HEAD FOR YEARS

**ExtraEater** (9.5): deserves better

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (9): Incredible intro, wish it was longer

**ManofOranges** (9): Really beautiful opener.

**tapdancingpig** (9): This is such a good opener! It’s a short little intro, but it sounds amazing, it’s memorable as hell, and it eases you into the album.

**waluigiest** (9): from this track I knew that this album was something special. It just works

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): a solid tune that sets the tone for the rest of the album

**nooodisaster** (8.5): A killer intro, and the first of 3 features you won't be able to fucking hear at all.

**Really\_Creative** (8.5): An excellent introduction to the album, if not an amazing song on its own. Still super chill and exactly what we've come to love about Janelle

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): I really like this track! Even if it’s a bit short, it’s a nice introduction to what the audience is to expect on the album.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): god only knows was ROBBED in AS2

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): It always makes me smile to see Brian Wilson perform music out of his own will in a world that’s been very cruel to him. As intriguing as the concept sounds, opening interludes and overtures in pop albums are actually very rarely executed properly (sorry, Janet, I love you, but there’s no need to make your records even  longer than they already are by having that many thirty-second intermissions). Dirty Computer is, thankfully, and instance where the idea actually works. We have solid production and singing here, and tied in with the continuation of Janelle’s techno-centered imagery from her previous works, the song ultimately gets one excited for the rest of its namesake album despite its smoothness and simplicity.

**c-ming** (8): an opening track that blossoms gorgeously with lush instrumentals before a smooth segue into the next track

**enecks** (8): Brian Wigson more like. This is a good concept introducer.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): For an intro type song, this is pretty good.

**kappyko** (8): This song's good

**leviswift13** (8): okay the background vocals and the melody of this song is eargasm

**silkypanties22** (8): smooth

**stansymash** (8): I'm unsure if the 'feat brian wilson' bit has any importance whatsoever. maybe its just so the beach boys fans get a burst of serotonin by reading his name

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): Super creative intro, and including Brian Wilson on an album like this is so cool to see

**J\_Toe** (7): As much as Janelle abandoned the Metropolis Suite for this album (and the idea of being an android), I love how she still infuses her music with science fiction aesthetics.

**Leixander** (7): A lackluster opener compared to her older work, still has great instrumentation though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Short but sweet intro.

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is pretty decent for an intro

**Cubascastrodistrict** (6): A pretty good opener, has more meaning in the context of the album.

**vayyiqra** (6): Tbh I skip this whenever I listen to the album : / it's cool Brian Wilson is here but this track doesn't add much to the album.

**frogaranaman** (5): Ahaha, it's the title of the album.

**gannade** (4): i mean its kinda nice but whats the point

**ryjomom** (4): It’s mellow and cute, but I don’t think I’ll listen to it again.

A decent ballad. The duel guitars give it a very special country twang that doesn't really seem to exist on the rest of the album. Other than that, it feels like a pretty average country love song.

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): this song makes my heart feel fuzzy

**c-ming** (10): like oh, what a world, the lyrics of this song would be chock full of meaningless platitudes had it not been kacey's delivery. cliches are cliches for a reason, and it is kacey's re-discovery of these simply treasures that make me feel as though i myself am only finding about the joys of love for the first time.

**kappyko** (10): FUCK U FOR PUTTING THIS ON THE LOWER THIRD OF THE ALBUM RANKING POPHEADS THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!

**Leixander** (10): It definitely is.

**leviswift13** (10): one of the prettiest melodies i've ever heard. for some reason the lyric "flowers in the concrete" gets me choked up

**ManofOranges** (10): This song gives me a particular sentimentality that few songs give me. This song makes me think about love and reminisce about past crushes. Its message might seem a little generic but it truly affects me like few other songs do.

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): The instrumental break is so simple but so satisfying

**stansymash** (9.5): perhaps the most gorgeous melody on the entire damn album

**1998tweety** (9): Another song that took a bit to grow on me, I love listening to this while taking a walk outside.

**ryjomom** (9): brokeback mountain vibes

**nooodisaster** (8.5): This just works for me. It fills me up with like happiness and peace, idk leave me alone.

**Really\_Creative** (8.5): A more traditional country song, and a weaker on song on the album for me but like, it's still better than some artists' entire discography. I adore how the song meanders in energy even if I'm not completely in love with everything else.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Love Is A Wild Thing might, for some, become a point where Golden Hour becomes too cohesive of an album, especially since it’s another return to fairly standard country after the brief bizarreness of Mother. As for me, I’ve never found anything to dislike about it. Sure, it’s not an immediate standout compared to other tracks from this album, but Kacey’s performance on the song makes it worthy of being called a classic country track in areas of both melody and execution. Love Is a Wild Thing isn’t very distinguishable, but sometimes, as proven by this album and other records of its kind like Tapestry, something’s simple can also be special.

**radiofan15** (8.3): YEE HAW GIRL SNAPPED HERE

**enecks** (8): Love is an underrated Alessia Cara song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Another really good track, and those background vocals are pretty nice. This album has much more in common with indie rock than country.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): Don’t really have anything objective for this.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): kinda corny but passable

**vayyiqra** (7): I don't love this, but if I heard this on the country station my dad makes everyone listen to on long car rides, I would be okay with it.

**frogaranaman** (6): Strong 'nothing can hurt me anymore' vibes.

**passionfruits2** (6): Huh?

**waluigiest** (6): could do without it but it’s not like offensive or anything

**Cubascastrodistrict** (1): This is like the fourth song in a row that I think is fine but completely un-impactful. The chorus is cute I guess. Who's singing in the background? I don't like his voice.

This song got ABSOLUTELY ROBBED! A song about the fallout of a toxic relationship, the raw emotion is so present throughout the lyrics. A very good indie rock song, it also sounds better produced than some of its bretheren. Anytime I hear it I just want to shout along with the chorus. "I. FELL. IN LOVE. WITH. A WAAAAAARRRRRRRR!"

---
**bespectacIed** (10): Mitski is a phenomenal songwriter, and A Pearl's chorus is her best work

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): it's very 90s college radio but in the best possible way. builds up beautifully too

**enecks** (10): Oysters be like

**gothheart** (10): this song goes OFF but in a sad, whale crying type of way

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): The dream of the 90s is alive in this song

**leviswift13** (10): WE LOVE SELF-DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is certainly one of the pearls of this album.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): I didn’t understand the meaning of this song until recently and that is all I’m going to say

**stansymash** (10): rip out my soul replace it with be the cowboy. be the cowboy only at all times, it's just be the cowboy

**vhqv1997** (10): This is the first time I feel like I could cry from a guitar riff. She is so powerful

**1998tweety** (9.5): A definitely highlight on the album, this song goes off so hard and leans into Mitski's rock side which we've seen on her previous albums. The guitars with those weird deep synths on top of them are great.

**Really\_Creative** (9.5): This feels more traditionally Mitski than much of the album, however, if there's one thing connecting this album together, it's how amazing the song climaxes are.

**nooodisaster** (9): This is the third longest song on this album at 2:36. ANYWAY, that guitar slays my entire existence and I relate to the lyrics some of the most on this album. Epic Mitski is best Mitski.

**Leixander** (8.5): It is just that I... fell in love... with a **WOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!** NOBODY TOLD ME IT ENDED-

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): The psychedelic synths mixed with the electric guitar makes a nice atmosphere.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the chorus made me add 2 points to this

**waluigiest** (8): intense and no!!!! I don’t want your touch!!

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Lyrically, this reminds me a lot of that song about burying a pearl off St Vincent’s debut record Marry Me, although I can’t remember the name of that track, owing up to the fact it’s been a bloody long time since I visited that album in spite of me thinking it’s Annie’s  third-best work. The reason why I just wasted an entire long sentence on an artist not even in this rate is that even I really like A Pearl, I can’t exactly mention anything about the song that’ll make it seem great. It does go back to a rock influence and deliver a sense of urgency very well, but I’d pick Remember My Name over A Pearl, so I suppose I find this a slightly inferior version to the former. I’m not going to lie – I love Be The Cowboy, but mulling about songs like A Pearl that I really enjoy but find difficulty in writing about, I guess I can see why a vocal minority thinks it’s not as good as some critics deem it to be. That doesn’t mean that they’re not wrong, though. Mitski defence squad, where you at?!

**c-ming** (7): gorgeous guitars

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://i.imgur.com/NZZBKPl.png

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): The lyrics are fascinating in this song, but I feel like the production drowns Mitski once again here

**plastichaxan** (6.5): I thought it had grown on me with the video but it's still one of the weakest compared to the rest.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (6): I don't love the verses but the chorus is great. I like the harder guitar production, I think it works for her voice. She has more emotion vocally in this song than a lot of her others.

**Brendon-Urine** (5): This is where the album starts getting meh for me :/ too many average tracks

**frogaranaman** (5): Love this Spongebob song!

**silkypanties22** (5): chord progressions are so unpleasant

**vayyiqra** (5): I feel nothing about this song, so I'm giving it a score in the middle of the scale. It's just generic indie rock song #23425, and that's all I have to say about it.

**radiofan15** (4.9): What kind of music style is she trying to do here? It feels as if she was improvising on the spot

Pink In The Night fell so, so far from it's peak of #8, and it's honestly quite sad. Personally, I've come into thinking that Pink In The Night is on eof the most beautiful love song in this entire rate. The feelings of infatuation (or lust) really comes through in the sound of this song.

---
**rosecoloreds** (11): this song literally sounds like a heartbreak but in a good way

**enecks** (10): Such an evocative, tragic artpiece.

**gothheart** (10): an underrated classic

**kappyko** (10): every time she does this dream pop thing it's a 10 why doesn't she do thsi more often

**nooodisaster** (10): "I could stare at your back all day" WOW okay we're all crying. I fear this will be majorly slept on, so let me just say: this might be my favorite writing in the entire album. A lot of Mitski's songs are about loneliness or unrequited love, but I think she nails it best here. Her vocals are filled with excitement and yearning, but also seem kinda pathetic in how unreturned this all seems.

**yourhostandpatron** (10): In a record full of conflicting emotions, Pink In The Night is the only track off Be The Cowboy that I’d describe as triumphant, in a sense. There’s still a lot of that familiar Mitski melancholy here – the song contains some implied sadness in it, never outright stated except for the brief mention of hearts breaking, yet evident from all its musical elements. And, yet, there’s still something so glorious and magnificently imaginable in Mitski’s repetitions of ‘I love you, I love you, I love you’, a declaration making up the final part of the song that manages to be satisfying in all its finality. Mitski’s music always tries to express those fleeting, temporal moments that you never have the chance to reflect on until you take the time to record them, and Pink In The Night Is a beautiful example of all the strengths and all the vulnerability of her approach.  Without a doubt, it’s my favourite song from this album.

**Leixander** (8.5): Lovely.

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): This is VERY ethereal and peaceful I'm in love.

**c-ming** (8): when i listen to this, i visualise a amorphous lover glowing and radiating pink, but walking farther and farther.

**leviswift13** (8): the try again's break my heart

**waluigiest** (8): a good song for when you catch feels too quickly and need to revise

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is a little boring compared to the other slow songs on the album. I do like the build-up at the end though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): No one: … Mitski: *stares at your back all day*

**Brendon-Urine** (6): Beach House, except it's Mitski

**vayyiqra** (6): This song is, to quote one of my favourite descriptions of pop music ever [from a review of Pure Heroine], "aggressively okay".

**Cubascastrodistrict** (5): This is the first song in a while that I've felt the melodies and flow of the lyrics is really clunky and weird. It just sounds... off to me, like she wrote the lyrics and then forced a melody on to it. I actually like the lyrics though. Song has a really nice build. Overall I like it.

**radiofan15** (4.5): Why does r/Popheads stans only Asian pop girls wihtout talent like Misty, Rina Sayonara and Red Velvet?

**frogaranaman** (4): something something Pinkerton

A fairly standard country pop song from Ms. Musgraves. Lonelyness seems to be a fairly common theme in this rate, but this seems to be the only song that is content in it's longing. I kind of relate to that message. Even when you're alone and all the thoughts of what you *could* be doing with someone are going through your mind, it's alright to hang with yourself.

---
**yourhostandpatron** (11): If somebody would pick a favourite disco-tinged track from Golden Hour, they’d be likely to pick High Horse. Lonely Weekend has, however, always been the highlight of this album for me, ever since my first attempt at listening to it. While High Horse is an immediate crowd-pleaser, I find Lonely Weekend to be an even better sibling of the former due to its refinement and acute descriptions of loneliness and boredom to such a sonically pleasurable track. In particular, its chorus is one of the most deceptively catchy and interesting hooks in country pop that I’ve ever seen. I have no doubt my 11 for it will be useless, but ultimately, Lonely Weekend is the song I love most in this rate.

**hikkaru** (10): :comfy:

**kappyko** (10): some TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMES

**ManofOranges** (10): I can relate to this one every week.

**Really\_Creative** (10): This album starts off so impossibly strong with some real mood pieces and Lonely Weekend I feel like is super slept on.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Probably my favorite song on this album

**ryjomom** (10): literally me listening to this rate

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): if anyone hasn't heard this album y'all better have a fear of missing out

**stansymash** (9.4): i'm groovin to a country song!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): the so low/solo thing is genius

**c-ming** (9): this is the counter to mitski's loneliness and desperation. thoroughly relatable lyrics, and i love how comforting the bridge is.

**enecks** (9): mood

**gothheart** (9): a sweet milkshake but misses the cherry on top that makes it a ten

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (9): Its a crime how relatable this song is

**passionfruits2** (9): No issues here.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (8): this and space cowboy were the only songs i didn't like at first but they both grew on me

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Who can relate? WOO! - Logic (2017)

**leviswift13** (8): a bop that grew on me over time

**survivorjdmarina** (8): It's kinda cute, but not my favorite on the album.

**vhqv1997** (8): "I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one/I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down" Me doing this rate and surfing Reddit instead of doing my homework.

**waluigiest** (8): she gets it!!

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): big mood

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is cute but it doesn't really measure up to the highs on the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I feel like Kacey basically walked into my house one weekend and wrote this song for me

**radiofan15** (7.2): Second track and the YEE HAW made its presence known...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song is really cute but a little repetitive. That said, the bridge is awesome and the instrumental is great.

**Leixander** (6.5): This feels basic compared to the other songs in the rate even though I think it is cute enough.

**vayyiqra** (6): Other than the relatable lyrics, there isn't anything great about this.

**frogaranaman** (5): God, I'm so depressed.

**nooodisaster** (3): Both the lyrics and production are more annoying than cute to me, it's melodically forgettable, clunky, and seems to drag forever at less than 4 minutes.. The base idea had potential.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (2): I don't like the chorus. This song seems about as deep as a puddle. I definitely feel a drop in quality lyrically here.

**gannade** (2): imagine being kacey, youre organizing your track list. you have the perfect opener in "slow burn," you have beautiful love songs in butterflies and oh what a world coming up. theres a cute little interlude in mother midway right after. but then you put lonely weekend right in the middle.

My favorite very indie rock song on the album. The guitars and synths on this record make it a fun, almost danceable track. Even so, like most of Mitski's songs on this record, it deals with some themes of troubled relationships. Even though she ended the relationship, she didn't want to and was hoping her lover would come back. It's kind of heartbreaking, and the superb lyrical themes make the track even better.

---
**enecks** (10): Hey, it's a perfectly formed song. This was very nearly my 11. Every element of buildup, new instrumentation, lyrical detail, riffs - it's perfect. This rate is an argument for multiple 11s being allowed. Like I have 8 11 worthy songs in this rate. THE FUCKING TRUMPETS. MISTKI SAVED MUSIC. SHE IS AN ELDER GOD. SOPHIE AND MITSKI WILL RAZE THIS BASTARD EARTH AND SOW SEEDS OF RENEWAL. THE UTOPIA IS AT HAND. ALL WILL BE JOY.

**stansymash** (10): i'm gonna be dishin' out 10s like i'm at a park and i got way too many frisbees

**vhqv1997** (10): Oh God the synths the guitar the lyrics everything about this song is so good

**waluigiest** (10): it’s problematic but I imagine my exes feeling this way when I listen to this song

**Leixander** (9.5): The riffs in this song send me to heaven for a few seconds.

**Really\_Creative** (9.3): A soft and sad bop. As with every Mitski song I only wish it was longer, but I love the ending of this song so much.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): why would we stop perfection

**c-ming** (9): memorable memories married with simple lyrics means there's a space, as through mitski's waiting for the person to respond to her question

**J\_Toe** (9): okay, I've tried to listen to this album, but never really got into it. But this is the kind of song I could like.

**Roxieloxie** (9): this song sounds like it would go on a playlist called "love songs for robots" and im kinda into that vibe

**survivorjdmarina** (9): The synths(?) in this song are really great, especially during the chorus. Also, Mitski's storytelling is great.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I don’t know if a certain user is reading this, or if they still give this flop subreddit a chance or if they’ve wisely abandoned it like so many others have failed to do, but I’m sure they were the one who submitted Why Didn’t You Stop Me? to that rate in that certain server that we accidentally deleted, but even if they  weren’t, they were the practically the only person in Popheads who mentioned Mitski before Pitchfork season came near the end of the year, so I salute them immensely. I think Why Don’t You Stop Me deserves more attention that it usually gets; the song is my go-to example of why incorporating more pop into Be The Cowboy ended up being a good idea, despite the whining of indie fans, and it must be said that the electronic influence in this song mixed in with its rock-oriented roots make for a fantastic experience. It might not be anybody else’s favourite, although it’s certainly not hated, but I’m damn glad this is the first Mitski song I ever heard.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Another weird song where the instrumentals take up like half of the track, nonetheless it bops a bit and I like it.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): i love how this builds up and the guitar riffs whew 🙇‍♀️

**kappyko** (8): kinda overrated but i mean it's still good

**leviswift13** (8): that lil synth line? i felt that

**nooodisaster** (7): This is catchy buuuut is it more than that?

**radiofan15** (7): Is this a warning for me to stop listening to this album? Because it-s kinda working... at least the last 20 seconds were interesting

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I like the synths but this isn’t super memorable honestly. Idk why but the chorus just doesn’t connect with me.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): The production is good but it drowns out her voice. It also reminds me of a last stage of a Nintendo game music for some reason lol

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): why does the intro of this sound like it's going to bust into the Danny Phantom theme song

**vayyiqra** (6): This song is incredibly catchy and is the one I remember most about this album. That synth/horn line repeats in my head daily, to the point of infuriation. Unfortunately, this has also kind of ruined the song for me.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (4): I really like the baseline on this, Again I find the lyrics sort of clunky. the melody after the chorus is great.

**frogaranaman** (4): This sounds like something I'd write on Garage Band in one bored afternoon.

[/r/popheads/comments/bi1h9p/nprcore_rate_reveal_day_2_nobody_is_happy_sad/elxgr8i/]

=====

frogaranaman: I just relistened to it, it's something like:

kick: on beats 1 / 3

snare: on beats 1 / 3, sometimes on 3 / 4 to end a 4-bar section in the second verse

intro synth: same note every eight beat, bring it up a note on the scale twice in the second verse

melody synth: after each verse ends, something like 5-5-4-2-4-4-3-1-3#-3#-1#-5 with the last, octave lower fifth held out for a bar

guitar: it's the key chords, I'm going to assume it's something like 7-5-5-3...1. The last chord has her sliding her fingers down the neck

guitar synth: it's a melody line, not hard to replicate

honestly the underlying meaning of the comment was that it's not complex production which is fine but it's not mixed at all and her voice is really drowned out so it feels like an unfinished wip that you do in a day 🤷🏼‍♂️

The true opening track to Dirty Computer, and it's truly a bop and a half. An indulgent pop song, the the lyrics celebrate Janelle's blackness and queerness in a way only she can. The rapped outro then adds to the song with its stark contrast to the pop section. While the pop part speaks to Janelle's ideals, the rap part shows the unfortunate reality people have to live through every day. Dichotomies like this pop up throughout Dirty Computer, and it brings a heightened meaning to the album.

---
**enecks** (10): This is so good. A juxtaposition of American iconography, modern glamour, and brutal reality in the outro. This is super-relistenable

**ExtraEater** (10): nostalgic, not the 80s nostalgic but like early 10s nostalgic tbh

**gannade** (10): janelle is a lot less interesting the more she tries to go political... song is still a bawp though

**ImADudeDuh** (10): "I just want to find a god, and I hope she loves me too" has so much more big dick energy than god is a woman ever did.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): The anthem we need in the late 2010s

**Really\_Creative** (10): This song checks so many boxes for me, it's catchy, fun, and the lyrics are amazing. "We don't need another ruler, all my friends are kings/we don't need another fool" I love in particular

**Roxieloxie** (10): I am not americas nightmare, I am the american dream

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): A crazy, classic bop

**ManofOranges** (9.5): I like this song tons. Only issue I have with it is that the chorus kind of pales in comparison to the rest of the song.

**c-ming** (9): this song captures the feeling of the wind beating against your face while riding down an empty freeway during a Californian summer

**J\_Toe** (9): While all the songs on this album successfully interweave the many facets of Janelle's identity, I feel like this song specifically focuses on themes of race. With an intro reminiscent of Martin Luther King, and the opening line of "young, black, wild and free" this theme is apparent. And the outro wraps up this commentary with a reflection of the unjust treatment of black people and the hands of the police.

**nooodisaster** (9): The beat kicking in coupled with the opening line "Young, black, wild and free/Naked on a limousine"? Yeah, that's gonna be a 9+ for me. The only thing that's not 10 worthy is the chorus for me.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Crazy, Classic Life is probably one of the tamest songs on Dirty Computer sonically – while the lyrics definitely have a rock and roll style of deviance to their spirit, it mostly resembles a sleek, RnB-inspired pop track that’s relaxing to one’s ears, but no less engaging to one’s mind. Even if it comes closer to easy listening than you’d expect, Crazy, Classic Life is a surprisingly political statement that makes an already appealing song more and more praiseworthy when you run across all the assertions that Janelle makes on it. ‘I am not America’s nightmare/I am the American dream’ is a really good one, but the rap verse that ends Crazy, Classic Life is an incredibly powerful racial declaration that reminds you that Dirty Computer is as much of a record about being black as it is a record about being queer and about being a woman. It may not be as exciting as Screwed or Make Me Feel, but the merits of Crazy, Classic Life are no less lush and luxurious than the song implies.

**radiofan15** (8.5): This is lush, sexy and moody... but I have to extract some decimals because it kinda goes on for like a year, and also that rap gave me some Madonna's American Life vibes, but with better lyrics

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I really love this song. The lyrical content is great, and the chorus and the transition into it is stellar.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (8): I like this song quite a bit, and I like the layers it has to it's meaning.

**gothheart** (8): this song makes me feel like i'm not wasting my life even though i am

**passionfruits2** (8): OPULANS, YOU EARN EVRYTHANG!

**ryjomom** (8): the extra comma in the title… also wish there wasn’t an outro

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I used to really really like this track but the chorus now just kinda drags the song down for me, especially after how great the verses are. However, the rap at the end of the song is one of the best moments on the album.

**vayyiqra** (8): To me this is the true start of the album. The synths are great and the chorus is so catchy!

**vhqv1997** (8): This song is a total bop, but some of the lyrics are a bit too corny for my taste

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): Ever since the album release, this track isn’t one that I come back to often. It’s okay though.

**1998tweety** (7): I feel like this goes on a bit too long, but there are a bunch of lyrics that I like a lot "we don't need another ruler, all of my friends are kings" which bring the song up but unfortunately I just find the whole thing kind of one-note with the exception of the rap verse at the end.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): Catchy, but still pretty plain.

**frogaranaman** (7): Relatable.

**leviswift13** (7): this song would be an easy ten with a better chorus. like i strongly dislike the chorus. the verses and pre set up a popping chorus and we get a flat musical theatre trap moment hmmm

**waluigiest** (7): beautiful lyrics and vocals, but the orchestration and flow don’t hold up against the rest of the album

**Leixander** (6): I love the message but it is one of the songs from the album I go back to least.

**silkypanties22** (5): rapping part was 2000 and late

**kappyko** (4): This reads as pop done by youth group leaders

deleted: This song suffers from lackluster production imo, the trap beats feel shoehorned in and the chorus isn't as bombastic as it could have been. Also, the long note she holds after the last chorus could have used some vibrato or something to make it pop. There could have been a better transition from this into "Take A Byte" as well, the end just kind of falls off... I'm just nitpicking now though, love u Janelle

edit: just to highlight what I *do* like about the song, I love her verse at the end and wish it was longer. and that bass fill when she says "now my black poppin like a bra strap on ya" 👀

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): toss ur dirty shoes in my washing machine heart bb bang it up inside

**enecks** (10): This is a metaphor that is actually really potent despite being seemingly ridiculous. Also *clap clap*

**gothheart** (10): this song made solfege sad, iconic

**Leixander** (10): A better way of saying, *just confide in me about your problems and... love me.* ^Also ^stream ^the ^magnum ^opus ^that ^is ^Confide ^In ^Me ^by ^Kylie ^Minogue ^which ^is ^available ^since ^1994 ^on ^her ^album ^that ^is ^also ^called ^Kylie ^Minogue.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song was kinda a shocker being right after A Horse Named Cold Air but it's really good so that's cool.

**Really\_Creative** (10): My 1 and 0 keys are getting a workout this rate and I'm so happy to see it

**stansymash** (10): laundry bops only

**vhqv1997** (10): I didn't know people wash shoes in a washing machine, is this a first-world thing or an upper-class thing?

**c-ming** (9): i love that the handclaps mimic the rhythmic noises of a washing machine, as though tossing mitski's desperate words around in a fervent tempo

**kappyko** (9): the rhythm of this echoing a washing machine is still the kind of shit that gets me lmfao

**Roxieloxie** (9): The synthish more upbeat songs that are weird but still kinda good are honestly the highlights on this album

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Mitski is not SOPHIE, and therefore, Washing Machine Heart does not contain the sounds of actual washing machines, an absence which may either relieve or disappoint you. Does the song actually capture the chaos of what goes on when laundry starts to spin? I guess you could make an argument that this track’s beat resembles the thumps of a washing machine, but it always reminded me of a military drill much more. Full of stomping and clapping in a way that’d make Freddie Mercury green with envy (come fight me, Queen fans, the only thing that stops that song from being absolute trash is its queer reading) Washing Machine Heart is an immediate attention-grabber that saves the album from dipping into slow and somewhat mediocre seas. I’ve heard that Mitski doesn’t perform as well live as she does in the studio, but I Imagine this’d be a crowd-pleaser.

**1998tweety** (8.5): The production on this is so damn groovy, I have no idea what she's saying but the production alone is carrying this track hard.

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): It's very catchy and the drum beats give it more depth.

**hikkaru** (8): what a weird metaphor lmao

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love laundry bops

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Nobody: ................................................................................................... Mitski: Someone fucking kiss me

**leviswift13** (8): such a little bop bop bop to the top

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Did you know Mitski created the percussion in this song by recording her washing her pair of Doc Martens in a washing machine?

**waluigiest** (8): “I’m not wearing my usual lipstick / I thought maybe we would kiss tonight” this song made me reflect and realize I choose my underwear based on the likelihood that I will hook up with someone that day and I feel exposed. That being said, after the amazing opening verse there’s not much there :/

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): i love the title

**nooodisaster** (7.5): i used to use Tide, but i switched to Mitski's heart and i feel like it cleans better??

**Brendon-Urine** (7): Love the beat.

**vayyiqra** (7): I love doing laundry! It's so relaxing and sleeping in clean bedding is the most refreshing feeling. Oh yeah, and this song is alright.

**radiofan15** (6.5): The intro screamed Imagine Dragons's It's Time but the song itself (sans guitar) was more like Pixies doing a song for the soundtrack of Drive

**frogaranaman** (6): On one hand, mild banger. On the other hand, weird solfege usage w/r/t her range.

**silkypanties22** (5): heart bassline seems so raw and unfinished, annoying melody

**Cubascastrodistrict** (2): I like the funky backing. I think she's trying to sound sexy here? Maybe I'm getting the wrong vibe but if she is... it's not working. Oh my god a post chorus keyboard I want to die.

Pynk is the most controversial song that Janelle has in this rate. There is some symbolism in the song that people took to be anti-trans, intentionally or not. Janelle has since come out against that reading, and the pink baseball bat in the video can be seen as Janelle affriming trans women as being included in the songs themes. Because really, deep inside, we *are* all just pink. Also this song is further hightened by its place is the emotion picture, with a beautiful extended bridge that includes a love poem between Janelle and Tessa Thompson

---
**KiwiKenJJJ** (11): After hundreds of listens to the album, the only song I never got sick of

**bespectacIed** (10): For such a progressive artist, janelle really decided to make this heteronormative bop. Still a 10/10 tho

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Uuhgghghhh the production on this song and the melody and everything is PERFECT

**hikkaru** (10): pink like the inside of your................................................ babey :comfy:

**J\_Toe** (10): Feminist anthem! I love how this song can present a universal message: we don't need to differentiate ourselves based on the colour of our skin when we're all pink on the inside, and that's what makes us all the same. Though the song is even greater for the fact that it is a specific rumination of queer black women's identities. Janelle stepped onto the music scene in a black and white suite at the beginning of the decade, saying it was what she would want to be buried in. I feel like this song has an added significance for Janelle in signifying how comfortable she is now in her complete identity. She can wear masculine suits and feminine dresses, and always be 100% Janelle Monae. Also, I love how the video is inclusive of trans women. :)

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): The first Janelle song I had heard since YOGA and it got me back on the hype train

**leviswift13** (10): talented brilliant incredible amazing showstopping spectacular

**ManofOranges** (10): The color blue has been abolished.

**Really\_Creative** (10): The chillest bop in the world, I love how this song builds up and as usual Janelle providing us the commentary we asked for

**Roxieloxie** (10): Ms.Monàe said Trans fucking Rights

**tapdancingpig** (10): Ugh the beats are just so clean and pretty. And Janelle sings it so well. AND THE PUSSYPANTS! I boosted my score a little after I saw that post about that fucker giving this a 0.

**stansymash** (9.3): this grew on me so much in the context of the record, god damn

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): that's pussy babe!

**Awkward\_King** (9): who'd have thought a song about vaginas would be so popular among gay men? people with taste that's who

**gothheart** (9): this song makes me straight

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A song I really hated on release but with the full album released I fell in love with it, ugh I was so fucking stupid back then.

**passionfruits2** (9): At first I hated this song, but then, after listening to it again, I found the lyrics to be very catchy, and the beggining of the song is so goooood!

**survivorjdmarina** (9): I feel like Grimes doesn’t have that much of a presence within this track, but besides that, this track also has standout lyrics, which this album is consistent on.

**vhqv1997** (9): That guitar is the best part of the song

**waluigiest** (9): gay! Gay! gay!

**nooodisaster** (8.9): Okay so the first time I listened to this, I thought the lyrics were "Cuz boy it's cool/If you got the blues/We got the pink" which I thought was SO clever to do a double-meaning of blue as a "boy" color with "the blues" as sadness that comes from toxic masculinity, and proposing femininity to all to make the world a better place. And then I read the lyrics. So yeah, gotta deduct some points.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love the instrumentation and unapologetically gay lyrics, I’m just not a fan of Grimes baby sounding voice at parts but it doesn’t take away from the song that much

**c-ming** (7): cool and quirky sounds, with monae's higher vocals complimenting the chill finger-snapping beat

**radiofan15** (6.9): Sorry but I don't like vaginas... I saw my mother's vagina when I was born and then I said to myself ''this would be the last time i'm seeing one of these''

**1998tweety** (6.5): On my first couple of listens I did not dig this track at all (the verses are so boring), but the chorus grew on me a lot. The Grimes feature does feel a bit unneeded though. I'm choosing to be a bit more forgiving on the lyrics of this song compared to Django Jane because even though Pynk holds a message, it's not nearly as lyrically driven as DJ.

**Kaylaboe** (6): the only mishap on the album :(( i can appreciate doing something a little different but i just never find myself caring for this song

**rootbeer\_surge** (5): I'm sorry, I just... don't like this. it sticks out like a sore thumb on an otherwise-perfect album

**vayyiqra** (5): This seems to be one of the most popular songs on this album but I don't like it and think it was only memorable because of its video. I'm a Grimes stan but I think she's wasted here.

**frogaranaman** (4): Outside of the chorus, I never really found this song to be interesting.

**Leixander** (4): I don't like this one since release. I don't feel like Grimes has anything to do with this song, not even as an inspiration. One positive thing to say: I love the video and her hidden verse in the motion movie is cute.

**ryjomom** (4): P!nk

**gannade** (3): It kinda feels like filler. also why did she work with grimes

**kappyko** (3): there's great moments of tension here but vocal delivery ruins it 4 me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): This is the track that kinda kills the chance this album had of being my AOTY. It’s definitely one of my favorites of last year, but this song is a big, big disappointment. Grimes is an extremely talented producer and singer, and Janelle obviously is one of the greatest voices of our generation, but for whatever reason, their collabs turn out to be vapid and uninspiring, and Pynk is just that. Grimes’ vocals are straight up annoying on this song. The verses are frankly aggravating. I love the message and even some of the lyrics, but it’s a chore to listen to, outside of the nice outro. That said, the instrumental is serviceable, but easily the weakest on the record, not nearly as interesting as some of the other great, fitting instrumentals on the record. Also, this song does not need to be 4 minutes, as it’s repetitive as shit, it doesn’t fit on the tracklisting (imagine the three song stretch of Screwed, Django Jane, and Make Me Feel), and it doesn’t deserve to be on this album.

**enecks** (0): For as much as I like the rest of Dirty Computer, I can't call it a classic album in good conscience because this is here. A gender essentialist anthem - this song is the equivalent of a pussy hat protest. It's empty protesting that has no musical ambition. Despite the video's best efforts, the song's lyrics are extremely excluding of anyone that isn't cis enough. It's no surprise this song was widely shared by TERFs. The fact that I haven't even mentioned the vapid empty production, or the fact it features a honest-to-god pedophile in it just shows how much I hate this worthless trash. This is going to be to this album what Halftime is to Illmatic. A blight. For the record - I appreciate Janelle's trans-inclusiveness elsewhere. So the fact this song got made just bums me out even more. This song is stealing a seat from the table for trans people.

static_int_husp: Posting patron's comment seperately b/c the post was too long:

**yourhostandpatron** (6): Look, I’m not going to be as harsh on this song as I would if it was done by anybody other than Janelle, a woman who’s obviously  a great, courageous, and wonderfully accepting woman who undeniably supports trans people, though I have to admit that part of the reason why I’m not more than moderately bothered by it is because I’m not exactly the kind of person whose opinion on this song’s lyrical content is supposed to be paid attention to over everybody else’s. For what it’s worth, Pynk is not a piece of work that I can say I unambiguously dislike. I don’t mind hearing it when I listen to Dirty Computer as an entire album from start to finish, and I honestly think that Pynk is well-constructed and minimalistically engaging when it comes to matters of composition. My problem with Pynk is, essentially, more philosophical and political than quality-oriented. I appreciate what Janelle is trying to do here, and I think this could’ve been a cute lesbian anthem a few decades ago, but as a trans person I’m more than a little bothered by any piece of art that associates feminism and womanhood with having a vagina. Now, let me make  this clear: again, I absolutely do not think Janelle is transphobic. This song’s music video evidently proves that. I also think that cis women are oppressed both on the basis of sex and gender (although, unlike radical feminists, I’d argue that the latter leads to the former) and that cis women absolutely have the right to make empowerment anthems based on the sexual aspects of their bodies, especially if they’re attracted to fellow women. But when feminists do all of these things without leaving any room for trans women, and without making clear that trans women are welcome to their version of feminism, too, something’s rotten in the state of Denmark. I’m a transmasculine person who doesn’t experience much genital dysphoria (to be honest, I’m fine with my vagina, I just wish it would stop fucking bleeding all the time and reminding me that I’m not normal), and if you take away the political nature of Pynk and concentrate on its sexual and sensual side, there’s no reason why this song wouldn’t apply to people of my kind. Pynk describes the experience of being a queer woman by celebrating cisgender vaginas, without giving a hint that neither of the women performing it condemn transphobia. It’s true that Pynk’s music video is more inclusive than song’s lyrics, which is a huge-ass relief, but without the help of the music video, we’re left with a song that accidentally appeals to gender essentialism that has no proper place in feminism. Before you folks say I’m stretching things, I witnessed some TERFs and radfems deeming Pynk an anthem for their very own ideology of scumbags with my very eyes upon its initial release; then, its music video got released, and the poor darlings threw themselves into a rage. I found this hilarious, but I find it also troubling that transphobic lesbians may have appropriated this song if Dirty Computer wasn’t a (very gorgeous) visual album. Am I super pressed about this? No, I’m not, even if I just wrote what might be the longest serious comment in rate history, although I can see why transfeminine people would be angrier at Janelle for making this song than I am. I am, however, very wary of the existence of these types of feminist and WLW anthems. Both cis and trans people deserve a future where gender goes past the boundaries of bodies and societal labels, and Pynk as a standalone track on Dirty Computer does not achieve that goal. So, yes, it’s not a bad piece of art, and I won’t yell at any of you it, but I can’t ignore that the background behind songs like it are at the very least moderately problematic ™, In other news, cheers up for one of the last slightly dignified moments Grimes got before her entire image went to shit! Woohoo!

yourhostandpatron: A lot of people don't get this, apparently, so I figured I'd type out another comment. 

The first premise you'll have to adapt here is that some women don't have vaginas. Some women will never have vaginas. Some men have vaginas, and some people who are neither male nor female have vaginas. Some of these people are always going to have a vagina. This is because trans people exist. The usual response to this is to claim that being trans is a rare exception, which is true, but considering the vast amount of trans communities we have online, it's not really that large of a clause. 

The second premise is one of postmodern feminism. Gender performance is a social construct (the word 'performance' is wider than the word 'roles', since even people who are gender non-conforming are still performing under the guise of the gender they identify and/or present as) and to tie it in with the presence of certain body parts is inaccurate and exclusionary of trans people. 

Therefore, the conclusion critics of Pynk are making over here is that it is wrong to associate the state of being a woman, or a queer woman, for that matter, with having a vagina. Yes, it's true that many trans women want to have a vagina eventually, but many do not, and some will never transition. It's also true that many nonbinary people who were assigned female at birth still identify with scenes for queer ladies to some extent despite having genital dysphoria. Statistically, these are small exceptions, but culturally their presences are getting more and more significant. 

How does this connect to Pynk? I'm not getting into this because I'm a minor, but the song obviously connects female sexuality with vaginas. The song in itself (we're not talking about the music video because we aren't rating the music video) portrays a kind of eroticism that's very oriented towards queer women who are cis. There's no part of the song that could apply to trans women who aren't very late into their transition, which is a category most trans women fall under. There's no room for trans people in Pynk's original lyrics *alone*. 

Pynk is not intentionally transphobic. The exclusion it perpetuates is accidental. Now, Janelle obviously realized the mistake she made in writing it after Dirty Computer was released. Do you know why Pynk's video had to specify that Janelle supported trans women? TERFs and transphobic lesbians were already claiming the song for their own. 

'But wait!' you may ask. 'You just admitted Janelle didn't intend for the song to be transphobic, so why are you blaming her for TERFs reading it in the wrong way?' Yes, this is true, but songs with lyrics are essentially just texts put to music, and there's this handy little concept called Death of the Author that explains that occasionally, the original meaning of a song as intended by an author no longer matters if an alternate reading of it is somehow valid. (This is a difficult idea to grasp, and I'm simplifying it very hastily.) If Janelle never released a music video for Pynk, the same kind of vile groups I just mentioned would have claimed it as an anthem. Her original intent for the song would be a pale shadow if not for the video. The exclusion in Pynk is not trivial. It is not even theoretical or hypothetical. It had a harmful concrete effect related to transphobia that was stopped in the nick of time. 

The exclusion in Pynk is accidental, but it's still irresponsible. I wouldn't have lowered my score for it to a 6 if it was, say, an underground lesbian anthem in 1982, but Janelle is a young artist who's interacted with trans people in the past and who focuses much of her musical themes on the idea of futurism and human advancement, which trans people fit into perfectly. It wouldn't have been hard to have a throwaway line in Pynk itself that made it clear that Janelle supported trans women, or for her to release a statement right after Dirty Computer was released that would have been affirming towards transfeminine people. Pynk isn't going to become a national anthem for transphobia anytime soon, although it almost met that fate, but it is very careless in the way it treats queer womanhood in relation to gender dysphoria.

Does this mean that cis women can't celebrate their vaginas, or that cis lesbians can never release songs about vaginas again? No, but in 2019, I think it's only fair to ask for them to acknowledge trans people at the same time. Women are oppressed on the basis of sex no matter if they're cis or trans, and cis women can absolutely talk about that, but inclusiveness has to become more and more of a requirement. 

Are the mistakes Janelle made in Pynk as a sole song severe enough to discount it? You can have your own opinions on that, but in these sorts of dialogues the voices of trans people will matter the most. If there's any message I can send to queer cis people who've read these posts, all I can say is this: whenever you talk about gender in relation to physical existence, take a careful look at what you're about to say. Some gay couples can produce their own child. Some men also have the right to birth control and abortion. Some young women without PCOS can never get periods. Every trans people has different experiences with their bodies and with gender dysphoria. Don't generalize us. Do not limit the boundaries of gender.

A really beautiful song. Sometimes, even when your at your happiest, you just know that the feeling has to go away. "This too, shall pass", as they say, and unfortunately that doesn't only apply to the bad times. Kacey expresses these emotions quite well, and it's part of what makes her record so special.

---
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): the best song on the album PERIODT

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Greatest chorus in the rate? Maybe.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): jesus the bridge always just does something very visceral to me

**didney-worl** (10): a new classic

**ExtraEater** (10): strong small town vibes

**Kaylaboe** (10): honestly, this album in a nutshell

**Leixander** (10): Would give this my 11 if there wasn't another song in this rate that made me feel Happy & Sad a bit more. :')

**leviswift13** (10): thank you kacey for this song. i've needed it so often

**passionfruits2** (10): 110% mood.

**plastichaxan** (10): This is basically Golden Hour, smiling with tears in my eyes.

**c-ming** (9): this is the opposite of silver lining. relatable lyrics that capture the anxiety of feeling like your run of happiness is going to run out soon, but also the yearning to cling on to even the last sliver of joy before worrying.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): mood

**letsallpoo** (9): is there a word for the way that im feelin tonight / sweet but psycho at the same time...

**ManofOranges** (9): We love an oxymoron.

**Really\_Creative** (9): Another song that doesn't QUITE live up to what the first half of the album was providing us... until the key changes. Girl had me shook. I can see where other people might not like them though

**ryjomom** (9): it’s called me everyday

**waluigiest** (9): what goes up must come down :(((

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I’ve heard complains about Happy and Sad citing the fact that its lyrics are overrated by neophytes who decide to check out Golden Hour for the first time. The chorus of this song, for example, goes ‘Is there a word for the way that I’m feeling tonight?/Happy and sad at the same time…’ which sounds poignant to virgin ears. However, a friend of mine pointed  out once that several such words exist, one of them being *conflicted*. That does bug me a bit now that I think about it, but I’m not sure the point of Kacey’s writing is supposed to be a lexical diatribe put to music. It’s true that none of the lyrics on Happy and Sad are something that the Pulitzers would typically award, but I think it’s less about the words Kacey is using here and more about that the feeling she evokes through such simple phrases. Coupled with some gorgeous music, you can easily see why this has such an effect on so many people, although some may not personally get it themselves. At the end of the day, I’m ultimately going to have to say that Happy and Sad deserves to be in the top tiers of Golden Hour.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is cute and nice but also feels like it blends a bit with some of the previous songs. With that being said though, it's super relatable and I like the lyrics a lot. I especially love the bit where she sings "I know that rain is coming my way".

**kappyko** (8.5): :'D

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): ugh a depression but hopeful anthem

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Delectable little bop with a lovely beat and a GREAT key change.

**enecks** (8): mood

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): relatable even though I’m single lol

**radiofan15** (7.5): BIPOLAR YEEHAW QUEEN

**rosecoloreds** (7.5): my two moods right here

**Awkward\_King** (7): same kacey same

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): 😊😔

**frogaranaman** (6): I love how relatable fearing everything in your life is going to spiral out of control and you can do nothing about it is.

**vayyiqra** (6): Going to copypaste my comment about "Lonely Weekend": Other than the relatable lyrics, there isn't anything great about this.

**nooodisaster** (5): If I have to listen to one more mid-tempo song I'm gonna golden shower on this golden hour.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (1): This song is just very surface level. I don't think it ever digs any deeper than the title.

I feel like this song was completely built around the pun of the "You can have your space, cowboy" line. It's still quite a good breakup song. Some fun facts about this song: 1) One of the inspirations for this song is actually a horse 2) When you look up "Space Cowboy" on Genius, the first song that comes up is actually "The Joker" by the Steve Miller Band. 3) When I saw Kacey perform live, she threw up her middle finger at the last "Space.... Cowboy" line, so there might be a little more anger in this song that there seems to be.

---
**1998tweety** (11): I loved this song since the first listen. Some people will hate it cause the title is a bit of a bait, but honestly it kind of makes me like the song more. The lyrics and instrumental and vocals are so pretty and all come together to make a really nice song.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Everything about this song is just so beautiful. Earned that Grammy for good reason.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (11): I love the play on words. I love the melody. I love Kacey's voice. It's a perfect song that just puts this already pretty much perfect album over the edge.

**bespectacIed** (10): that pause

**ExtraEater** (10): a whole new world

**ImADudeDuh** (10): While it's definitely disappointing that this song isn't about an actual space cowboy like Cowboy boopadebop, but this track really conveys the feeling of emptiness amazingly.

**leviswift13** (10): SO CLOSE TO GETTING MY 11 what an emotional, clever sad bop

**tapdancingpig** (10): Holy shit I’m crying what the fuck is this?

**vhqv1997** (10): This is false advertising but the product is so good I don't care either way

**Really\_Creative** (9.8): This song is outstanding but feels like a slight step down from my faves on the album. The key changes ALMOST makes this a 10 alone though

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): :pensivecowboy:

**c-ming** (9): a misleading title but a quintessential breakup song ever since it has been released.

**Kaylaboe** (9): when a horse wants to run, there’s no sense in closing that gate 😔

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (9): Okay I'm starting to get fatigued on the slow jams, but if this song was earlier I think it would be one of my favorites so it still gets a decent score

**ManofOranges** (9): Great song. Kinda gets a little boring sometimes though.

**passionfruits2** (9): Get it? Because u thought it was a cowboy from space, but it's a cowboy that should get spaced. I don't know actually.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I don’t have much to say about this track that hasn’t already been said, but I love the clever title.

**waluigiest** (9): this song is built around defying cultural expectations of “space cowboy” and wow it works

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I’m still going to give Space Cowboy a high score because of how technically good it is as a song, but I’ve never really fallen in love with its flow or melody as much as some other examples of Kacey’s talent within Golden Hour. It’s true that there’s a certain maturity here as Kacey takes the role of being the one who rejects a mediocre lover in a way that might make this the even better, even more country version of Taylor Swift’s White Horse, but I’ve yet to fall in love with it as a whole.

**stansymash** (8.4): this reminds me of my favourite animated show, cowboys in space

**enecks** (8): Cowboy Bebop is overrated

**strawberryswing1** (8): https://imgur.com/9hLe53g

**radiofan15** (7.6): More moody than expected... It's more of a grower but I kinda di it

**foxxglove\_** (7.5): i feel like kacey names her songs before she writes them

**Leixander** (7.5): This doesn't hit me like the other songs in this album.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): It’s nice and breezy

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): I like the title of this one

**AbnormalPopPunk** (7): the least best on the album and its still great. when will your fave ever

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the lyrics but it’s just kind of boring compared to the other songs on the album so far

**ryjomom** (7): yee haw version of ariana grande’s space program nasa

**nooodisaster** (6.5): The yeehaw jumped OUT in this song.

**frogaranaman** (6): He yee'd, and she let him haw.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (4): part of me wanted to give this the zero just because of how much the chorus made me groan. Overall I actually like this song, it's not completely generic twangy yeehaw stuff. And the part at the end of the first chorus where there's a pause on space is great.

**vayyiqra** (4): It doesn't bode well that this whole song is built around a dad joke-worthy pun.

**kappyko** (3): THIS RUINS THE FLOW OF THE ALBUM!!!!! i HATE the dumb pun here so much and it's just kind of an ugly blemish on this beautiful record cos its kinda just muddy to me

Kacey really knows how to do acoustic love songs. Dedicated to her (at that point new) husband, the song is just such pure love. I also really feel like this song, along with Slow Burn, best captures the aesthetic of this lovely album. Fun fact: When I saw Kacey live, she replaced the last "Golden Hour" in the lyrics with "Golden Showers"...

---
**strawberryswing1** (11): This song makes me feel like I'm in love. I've listened to this song during final exam season because it has a really calming effect on me. I think everything about it is just beautiful and I wish more people would appreciate it.

**bespectacIed** (10): one of my favorite love songs of all time

**c-ming** (10): this title track captures the beauty of a radiant, orange sunset, engulfing her and her lover in a sense of comfort and calm. gorgeously simple, simply gorgeous.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): SO close to snatching my 11 ugh if i ever get married i want this played at my wedding, but also i would never marry anyone who doesnt make me feel this song inside

**kappyko** (10): underrated classic that they play on the mfin sirius xm coffee shop radio on occasion i always tune in.... deserves day 3. i love how the guitar solo almost threatens to go into some fleet foxes shit

**Leixander** (10): When she says "Everything is going to be alright", you want to believe that.

**passionfruits2** (10): God it just gets better

**waluigiest** (10): I’m the kind of thot who takes golden hour pics when half of my face is just a shadow and ya know I feel this

**gothheart** (9.5): it's like a golden shower but actual gold

**Really\_Creative** (9.2): A pretty mood song, but not my favorite.

**enecks** (9): is good

**rosesmp3** (9): this song sounds warm idk if that makes sense

**ryjomom** (9): *Inserts link of Jonas Brothers on a boat* as if i have the mind of a master, i'm just so creative

**stansymash** (9): I feel so loved when listening to this song, despite the fact i'm distinctly not

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Just like Love Is A Wild Thing, Golden Hour appears to me as a country-inspired song designed to be a classic that just puts me into a right mood. The title track of this brilliant record is woefully ignore, a fact that I’m glad more people have been pointing out; it may seem like nothing incredibly special at first, but if you have a heart, you’ll listen to Kacey and feel like you’re actually basking under the rich gold light emanating from the sun. There’s no place captured so well with proper musical talent like home, and Golden Hour has a warm atmosphere that fills the entire household.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is cute and lovely

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): The guitars at the beginning are really nice and peaceful. The chorus is breezy as well.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): mood is the Jonas Brothers on a boat singing along to this

**leviswift13** (8): such a mellow culmination of a journey focused on love and self-worth

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (7): How is this the title track

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This title track isn’t an album highlight but it’s very solid.

**vayyiqra** (7): In the medical field, the golden hour is "the first hour after the occurrence of a traumatic injury, considered the most critical for successful emergency treatment". Unfortunately, this fairly pretty song got to me too late to resuscitate my good first impression of this album. : /

**radiofan15** (6.5): I'm not feeling this one chief, sorry

**foxxglove\_** (6): idk i feel like ive heard this song multiple times already on the tracklist

**frogaranaman** (6): Ahaha, it's the title of the album.

**Roxieloxie** (6): chill bop

**Cubascastrodistrict** (2): I feel like I'm repeating myself, but this is average. It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it.

**nooodisaster** (0): Kacey really wrote this song as an ode to her boyfriend... maybe you shoulda just sent an e-card, gurl.
