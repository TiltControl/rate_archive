The 2018 NPR-Core Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/awkdfb/the_2018_nprcore_rate/

Hello everyone, and welcome to the 2018 NPR-core Rate!

**The what??**

The NPR-Core rate.

**We heard you, but what is that?**

It's the top 3 albums from NPR's 2018 year end list. We're rating *Dirty Computer* by Janelle Monáe, *Be The Cowboy* by Mitski, and *Golden Hour* by Kacey Musgraves.

**Wow, those are some pretty different albums.**

Well, we rated the entire 2009 year-end Billboard singles chart last month, so it's not like we haven't had diverse rates recently.

**Is there anything else connecting these albums though?**

You mean other than being some of /r/popheads favorite albums of the last year? No, not really.

**\*sigh\*. Okay, lets hear about it, then.**

# Janelle Monáe - *Dirty Computer*

*Dirty Computer* is Janelle Monáe's 3rd studio album and is her most critically acclaimed yet. Nominated for album of the year at the Grammys, the #1 album of 2018 according to NPR, and /r/popheads #1 album of 2018. Not only that, but the songs Make Me Feel was also named by /r/popheads as the #1 song of 2018. All those awards are well deserved, and we are blessed to have /u/JanelleMonae as a mod in this subreddit.

With *Dirty Computer*, Monáe created a sci-fi odyssey that explores blackness, queerness, and surviving the modern American political landscape. Monáe channels musicians from the past such as Prince and David Bowie, and works with modern artists like Grimes and Pharrell to create her own funky pop sound of the future. A modern day Renaissance woman, Monáe also created a 48 minute [Emotion Picture](https://youtu.be/jdH2Sy-BlNE) to go along with the album. Essentially an album length music video, this short film drives home the points of Ms. Monáe's immaculate concept album.

*(Note: due to the reality of rates involving judging each song individually, the interludes Jane's Dream and Stevie's Dream will not be included in the rate. A 17 second song does not conform well to that format)*

# Mitski - *Be The Cowboy*

Mitski's 5th studio album was the #2 album of the year according to NPR. While it may not have been nominated for major Grammys (it was nominated for Best Recording Package), it was hailed by indie crowds, being named album of the year by Pitchfork. Many of it's singles also had major crossover appeal in the pop world. The songs Nobody and Geyser reaching #12 and #24 on the /r/popheads top 100 of 2018, respectively.

*Be The Cowboy* is surely Mitski's most pop album, though it still stays close to her indie rock roots. The electric guitar riffs in "Why Didn't You Stop Me?" and "A Pearl" stand out as an excellent continuation of the sound Mitski honed on the album *Puberty 2*. Meanwhile, "Nobody" and "Two Slow Dancers" are a great evolution of her into singer-songwriter pop music, in the vein of fellow 2018 tour mate Lorde. Indeed, Mitski's lyrics may be the highlight of this album. Each track offers thoughtful observations on topics such as relationships, loneliness, or desire. Overall, Mitski's great lyrics, indie-rock guitar riffs, and pop-flavored synths combine to make one of the most interesting and introspective albums of 2018.

# Kacey Musgraves - *Golden Hour*

2018 was a great Year for Kacey Musgraves. Her 3rd studio album album *Golden Hour* won Album of the Year at the 2018 Country Music Awards, and both Country Album of the Year and Album of the Year at the 2019 Grammys. It also made many year end lists, including #3 at NPR, #2 at Pitchfork, and #2 on the /r/popheads list. The single "High Horse" was adored within the subreddit, making it to #4 on our top 100 songs of 2018.

*Golden Hour* is not quite a mainstream country album, as it was shunned by country radio. Yet Kacey Musgraves' freewheeling spirit and thoughtful lyricism has helped her build a devoted fanbase . The album opens with "Slow Burn", a beautiful autobiographical track that sets the tone for the rest of the album. Other songs push the boundaries of country music, with "Oh, What A World" incorporating electronic effects a la Daft Punk, and "Mother" being a song that was written while Musgraves was tripping on acid. With *Golden Hour*, Kacey presents us with music that is wholly unique, while still sounding familiar at the same time.

# The Rules

* Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). You can use up to one decimal place, although I recommend only using integers and multiples of 0.5, because no one's opinion is truly strong enough to justify giving a song a 6.8

* You may give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11). These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. It is **strongly** encouraged to leave a comment on any song you give an 11 or a 0.

* You must use the prepared link to send in your scores.

* Feel free to PM me on Reddit or Discord if you'd like to change any of your scores.

* DO NOT SABOTAGE. There is no hard minimum for album scores, but if you submit a ballot that is suspect, I reserve the right to have you explain your scores or to reject your ballot

* You may add comments to any song or album. The following format is the only acceptable format for song and album comments, respectively:

> Make Me Feel: 11 The second coming of Prince

> Album: Be The Cowboy: Too much yee, not enough haw.

Any of the following formats are INCORRECT (they crash the program we use to record scores)and must be CORRECTED or else your ballot will be REJECTED:

> Make Me Feel: 11 - The second coming of Prince

> Make Me Feel: Janelle Monáe is the second coming of Prince, so give this an 11

> Make Me Feel: (11) The second coming of Prince

> Album: Be The Cowboy - Never seen this album on /r/countryheads

> Album: Be The Cowboy (Mitski deserved a Grammy nom)
