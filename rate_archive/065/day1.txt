NPR-Core Rate Day 1: So Afraid For Mitski

Hey Eveybody, welcome to the first day of the rate reveal for the NPR-Core rate, a brutal battle between 3 queens of music: Mitski, Janelle Monae, and Kacey Musgraves. Today we will be revealing the bottom third of the songs, from **#39 - #27**. The rate will begin at 5pm Eastern / 2pm Pacific (about a half hour after this post goes live).

But memes aside, there isn't a bad song on this list in my opinion, these are three of the best (and most cohesive) albums 2018 had to offer.

A Horse Named Cold Air has an experimental, eerie, and somewhat stripped back sound. I personally find it decent, but nowhere near the quality of the rest of the album. Also, I have no idea what the lyrics mean. The scores show the popheads found this song incredibly devisive, with multiple 0s, but also almost twenty 9+ scores. It was by far the most controversial song in the rate.

---
**enecks** (10): Why would you name your horse cold air when you could name them Neigh-Neigh

**leviswift13** (10): "i thought i'd traveled a long way, but i had circled the same old sin"

**Really\_Creative** (9.5): Another song that feels more classic Mitski than Cowboy Mitski, it almost feels out of place on this album but I love the piano chords soooo much. I can sense this song being an early out though, it's a little weird even I can admit.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): THE EXPERIMENTAL *RETIRED FROM SAD, NEW CAREER IN BUSINESS* VIBES WE DESERVE

**survivorjdmarina** (9): This is very simplistic but I like it??? It's cute.

**kappyko** (8): i'm going 2 ascend. somebody said this is radiohead-esque on genius and yea ur right so FUK radiofan15 lives!!!!!

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): let me hear y’all say yeehaw

**letsallpoo** (7): closed off from love, i didnt need the pain

**1998tweety** (6.5): On most albums, this would be an interlude but not for Mitski! A song that sounds like an interlude is longer than half the album.

**gothheart** (6): hit or miss, i guess this one missed huh

**Leixander** (6): This doesn't feel as polished as the others. Keeping it out of the album would be a wise idea.

**Roxieloxie** (6): I dont know what I expected with the title and after listening I still dont know

**vhqv1997** (6): This song has a very interesting concept, but it serves little to no purpose in this album, and it's not really interesting to listen to either

**c-ming** (5): honestly, i don't really understand what she's singing about

**nooodisaster** (5): This shit is too deep for me.

**rosecoloreds** (5): miss mitski ily but what the fuck was that

**yourhostandpatron** (5): A Horse Named Cold Air is one of the two songs on Be The Cowboy that din’t really work like Mitski intended to. I’m not sure if this song suffers from being so brief, or if I should be glad that it sticks to the Mitski formula so I don’t have to endure more than two or so minutes of mediocrity, but I feel like the storytelling and atmosphere in this track is rather numb and lacking in strength compared to all the heights reached on the rest of Be The Cowboy. After several listens of the entire album, I still can’t find anything distinguishable about it. That’s quite the disappointment, no?

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this song has like 6 words in it and she still managed to make it longer than most of the actual songs on this album

**ManofOranges** (4): I didn't know Mitski was one of those horse girls.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I think I like the title for this song more than the song itself :/

**waluigiest** (4): tbh what does it mean

**Brendon-Urine** (3): Well it's a good thing these songs are short

**Cubascastrodistrict** (3): Again, clunky flow, bad melody. The lyrics and the rest of the song don't work together. It sounds like a poem being forced onto a melody, which to me isn't good. Her voice has a little bit of power near the end which is nice.

**vayyiqra** (3): The dissonance of this song is really bothering and creeping me out and I can't explain why. I know it's weird but I just instinctually hate this song.

**frogaranaman** (2): When I turn my three-line poem into a boring ballad, y'all better be as hype for it as you are for this album.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I feel like this is more of a poem with music rather than a song. I really like the oohs at the end though but other than that it’s not that good

**radiofan15** (0): Random but at least Kevin Federline can rest assured he never released anythign as bad as this song... also, who would name a horse like that? poor little thing

This song is peak indie rock Mitski, which for some people is not a great thing. It's short and lacks a traditional song structure. Personally, I find it kind of plesant to listen to in the background, but that's about it. The shortest song on Mitski's record, it's blink and you miss it.

---
**enecks** (10): A mood moment, but nonetheless potent genius.

**kappyko** (10): haunting '60s pop in space

**gothheart** (9): bottoms up, and the devil cries

**Leixander** (9): I see this as the perfect intro to Nobody even though they are lyrically not related.

**vhqv1997** (9): This song needs to be longer. I understand it basically acts as a transition between Me and My Husband and Nobody but the potential for this is just too much to be ignored

**1998tweety** (8.5): I love the lyrics and vibe of this song but its way way WAY too short. This track would benefit a lot from a longer length.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): i love the ethereal quality of her vocals

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): always feels like more of a calming warm-up before the astronomical high of Nobody but still good in its own right

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I wish this was longer

**leviswift13** (8): there's a creepy girl-group vibe here that is so disturbing and so amazing

**survivorjdmarina** (8): It's cool

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (7): Least memorable of the under two minute songs

**plastichaxan** (7): This is too short for its own good it could've been a dreamy masterpiece of a song but in the context of the album it's great.

**Really\_Creative** (7): Possibly the one song on this album that doesn't click for me but it's still pretty and pleasant so like??

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Come into the Water’s artistic vision is almost ritualistic in quality, perhaps drawing some inspiration from traditional Japanese religion symbolism (then again, I know almost nothing about Shinto, so don’t take my word for it). This track was never a favourite of mine ever since the first time I’ve listened to Be The Cowboy, because, with the exception of Two Slow Dancers, I’ve always seen the slower, more sparsely produced songs on the record to kill the momentum its brief length needed to keep up in order to retain my enjoyment. I’m still not a huge fan of Come Into the Water now, but the mystic atmosphere it creates now makes me like it well enough. It’s a shame Mitski doesn’t do visual albums, because I’ve a feeling this’d benefit a lot from a beautiful video.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): No offense but based on these song lengths most popheads hosts probably would’ve removed half the album from the rate considering they’re as long as interludes

**waluigiest** (6): short and not fresh

**nooodisaster** (5): *looks up from phone as this ends* wait what?

**Roxieloxie** (5): it's a little slow

**vayyiqra** (5): And we're back to college radio-core. I thought this was the NPR rate. Then again, I don't know what kind of music gets played on NPR since I'm not American and never listen to it.

**radiofan15** (2.5): Now she's trying to be Lana del Rey? Outside of the keyboard, IT SOUNDS LIKE A LANA DEL REY REJECT

**frogaranaman** (2): Glad we're rating an album of interludes, a first for popheads.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (1): Again this song goes absolutely nowhere emotionally. Mitski needs to learn to make songs longer than 2:30.

**Brendon-Urine** (0): Listening to this album in full is making me hate Mitski

Another short Mitski song without a traditional song structure. I find the symbolism within the instrumentation to be really beautiful here. Coming near the end of the album, it does symbolize Mitski's slow breakdown over the course of the album relating to finding someone to love. As the song ends, the backing track loses any sort of structure it has, as the music joins Mitski in her unfortunate downward spiral. Once again though, this is kind of a short song, and it feels like it could be more fleshed out.

---
**Awkward\_King** (10): somebody kissss me, i'm going crazzyyyy

**enecks** (10): Huh, more songs should be called after coloured lights

**Leixander** (10): Words cannot convey how much I adore this song, but I can try. I imagine this song as her waking up from a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare) and then slowly coming back to reality all squeezed into one minute and fourty-three seconds.

**Roxieloxie** (8.3): something something joke about lorde

**survivorjdmarina** (8): It's cool, I like it. Not much to say otherwise tbh.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Melodically, I like this.

**stansymash** (7.5): I've heard the intro to this song countless times directly after all the times i've listened to Washing Machine Heart

**c-ming** (7): the instrumentals during the 'are you that blue light?' part are unlike anything i've ever heard before, and it makes me feel kinda queasy tbh

**leviswift13** (7): mesmirzing, but slight

**Really\_Creative** (7): I kind of like this song but it's not quite for me I don't think. Little too out there, sorry girl.

**kappyko** (6.5): this one was kinda eh i don't think this distinguishes itself from the rest of the pack

**1998tweety** (6): This feels like such a non-event...also wtf is going on at the very end lmao

**ImADudeDuh** (6): ok but I think we've ALL walked around the house naked in the night singing for someone to kiss me.

**plastichaxan** (6): The weakest in the album for me and yet, in the context of it, it still doesn't feel like filler, Mitski truly has the mind of a mastermind.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): *buys loop pedal once*

**vhqv1997** (6): The majority of this song is its own outro. My God I love you Mitski but this is way too much.

**vayyiqra** (5): You should avoid blue light at nighttime because it causes the brain to suppress production of melatonin [via the pineal gland] and delays the onset of sleep. However, this song is so dull it would probably have the opposite effect on me.

**waluigiest** (5): me at the local Kmart

**yourhostandpatron** (5): Blue Light seems like a song that…uh, it seems like a song that just does not belong on Be The Cowboy, if I’m being honest. It might not belong on any kind of album at all, actually, because I can hardly remember a thing about it and it ends up doing basically nothing. I can’t even visualize an actual blue light when listening to it unless I induce myself to, which is weird, because Mitski’s descriptions and lyrical style always tend to make me come up with images. At least I can see where Mitski was trying to steer this album to when she made A Horse Named Cold Air, even if I don’t like that track at all, but, really, what’s Blue Light’s purpose on this album? May the other comments enlighten me about what’s going on here? I should probably pay more attention to the song’s lyrics, but, eh.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): lorde is shaking

**radiofan15** (3.7): Some artists might call this thing a shitty interlude that needs lots of reworking... for Misty is an actual song that deserved to be released

**frogaranaman** (3): mitski are you even trying anymore

**Cubascastrodistrict** (2): This is fine I guess? It's not bad it just doesn't do much for me.

Pharrell may have won the Grammy for Producer of the Year last year, but this did not sway popheads' opinion of him one bit. This track seems out of place on *Dirty Computer* to me, and I might have a better opinion on it if it was recorded by a different artist. Thanks to a group of users who prefer this funky sound submitting in the last week, I Got The Juice barely crawled above a 7 average.

---
**Awkward\_King** (10): she said it herself you try to grab her pussy that pussy will grab u back sis

**bespectacIed** (10): I don't even like this song this much (a 7 at best) but I JUST know the pharrell haters will attack this. I'm doing a reverse-sabotage, i have a mind of a mastermind

**kappyko** (10): This wasn't produced by Pharrell but doesn't it sound like it

**radiofan15** (10): Why is she still rapping? Janelle sweetie even Pharrell outrapped you... having said that, this is still a FUCKING B.O.P.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Lizzo and Janelle should open up a juice shop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): you got my wig too!

**c-ming** (9): this song made me wonder if i was attracted to pharrell during his verse

**Kaylaboe** (9): pharrell has the mind of a master and i will not hear any more negativity on this sub

**vayyiqra** (9): I know /r/popheads hates Pharrell, but this is a B O P and no one can deny it. His rap isn't very good, but the rest is fire.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Holy SHIT this is sooo funky. Pharrell actually has a good flow, even if some of his lyrics...... tu,n outsold.

**Really\_Creative** (8.5): Janelle being a prophet and predicting the absolute slam-bop of Juice by Lizzo, when will your fave?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): lizzo shaking

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I see you Pharrell haters getting ready to give this song your 0s, and I will not be surprised at all when it goes out on Day 1. I’m not a fanatic of the guy or anything, but I think I Got The Juice deserves more credit than people give it for; it’s considered a primary candidate for the worst track on the album, and while it’s definitely as good as many of the earlier songs on Dirty Computer, I still find it to be incredibly fun. True, the song structure here is a little messy, especially in its opening verse, but Janelle’s energy in describing her, uh, juice (is there a way for me to review this album legally? Because I don’t know if there is) is something that always puts a smile on my face. What starts out a little worryingly ends up becoming a flawed, but enjoyable deep cut.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Janelle’s Blazed

**stansymash** (7.3): the one you skip

**frogaranaman** (7): There's going to be a comment about _Sweetener_ on this song.

**J\_Toe** (7): Pharrell's lyrics are gross :(. Look, he didn't ruin 2018 music, but between this and some of the tracks on Sweetener, he certainly didn't make the highlights of 2018 pop.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (7): second half of this song saves it

**leviswift13** (7): down dog

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Like Crazy, Classic, Life, I don’t really come back to this track a whole lot, but it seems fun enough.

**CreepyMannequin** (6.5): Would have an extra point or so without Pharrell.

**enecks** (6): I defended Sweetener. But the lyrics... are a choice. I can't defend Pharrell in this.

**ManofOranges** (6): Stream Juice.

**passionfruits2** (6): Worst song in the album IMO. The chorus is annoying.

**rosecoloreds** (6): at this point anyone collaborating with Pharrell is making..... a choice.

**Brendon-Urine** (5.5): Just kind of obnoxious. The beat doesn't work well

**ryjomom** (5): Lizzo sweetie I am so sorry...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Another miss on the record for me. Janelle and Pharrell are a great pairing in theory, but this song doesn’t really fit the record in my opinion. The instrumental is pretty nice, if a little grating, but the chorus doesn’t do anything for me, and despite having a really solid Pharrell verse, I’m just kinda checking how long I have until this song is over.

**vhqv1997** (5): I read on Genius that Janelle wanted this song to represent male and female collaboration in uplifting women and fighting for women's rights and honestly, I love you Janelle but how can anybody understand that when literally half of the song is just the title

**1998tweety** (4): Yikes this is not it at all, it has grown on me a bit since my first listen but I still find it awful. Pharrell's flow on his verse is great but some of his lyrics are criminally bad.

**letsallpoo** (4): shawty you can get blazed

**plastichaxan** (4): This ruined what could've been the perfect album for me, sorry.

**Leixander** (3): *0 Kelvin cold take:* Does any song that *is produced by*/*has some involvement from* Pharrell that has been released since 2014 have to be non-memorable and feel like the same song again and again? Call me a basic Pharrell hater or whatever, you can't make me like this song and give it a higher score than this. I love some of his production & work, but this (and dozens of other stuff he released lately) is not it.

**waluigiest** (3): this is just… so out of place and uninspiring. It gets a few points for the (Janelle) bridge. Like I’m not even a Pharrell hater! I like Happy, I like his stuff on Sweetener. But this is so messy.

**gannade** (2): we stan pharrell, who always sabotages no talent pop girls like camila, janelle, and ariana

This is the first song to go out that I genuinley like. I think we all have some person in our life that hasn't quite dissapeared, but we still have feelings about. It fits in well with the general melancholy of the album, and is one of the first Mitski song's to go out that has a more traditional song structure.

---
**c-ming** (10): with many specific details littered throughout the song, this song definitely means something very person to mitski, but i can't help feel like this song is personal to me as well - the feeling of desperation in unrequited love, and the loneliness that follows is a universal theme. we all have our old friends, and we all have our blue diners.

**enecks** (10): After the explosive two first tracks, this might seem like nothing. But the lyrical details are super-evocative, and the instrumentation has real weight and subtlety.

**Really\_Creative** (10): such a good fucking song, the rhythm of her vocals is weird and I live for it

**waluigiest** (10): as i’m listening critically I’m realizing how beautiful I find all of her writing. Maybe it’s because I’m fake deep but the chorus here hits me

**Leixander** (9.5): Explains relations with old friends perfectly.

**leviswift13** (9): bitch blue diner sounds like the saddest most romantic lonliest most nostalgic place ever, just like this song

**stansymash** (9): i don't even know what a blue diner is but if i ever see one i'll probably cry. seems like the right thing to do.

**vhqv1997** (9): Those synths are so magical I think I got transported into a Studio Ghibi movie

**kappyko** (8): this one is fine

**nooodisaster** (8): Why am I getting Moonlight vibes from this? Her voice has such longing to it, it sells the whole song tbh.

**plastichaxan** (8): These short ass songs that could've been 10/10 if they were just a bit longer Mitski we need to talk.

**Roxieloxie** (8): It's very visual

**survivorjdmarina** (8): Not a whole lot to say

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Setting a song’s background in a diner with fine coffee served and nostalgia thrown into the mix is something that’d work marvellously on a listener like me (no, I’m not calling myself a hipster, journalism major aesthetics are different from hipster aesthetics, go away) and, by golly, Old Friend does achieve such a wonderful effect. Despite Mitski’s relatively static voice, Old Friend has an appealingly platonic sense of intimacy and reunion woven into it. In my opinion, it’s always deserved more attention due to how well Mitski illustrates what I’m talking about in such a short timespan. Old Friend is a song that perfectly tells the story of a specific moment, and, as such, t benefits extraordinarily from its briefness, not just in spite of it. The most underrated song on Be The Cowboy!

**1998tweety** (7): I like the lyrics on this song but I'm just not a fan of it musically.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): a nice story but the actual song itself feels awkward and stilted

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This starts out as an imposter of a Mitski song and ends as an imposter of an Alvvays song.

**vayyiqra** (6): Tbh the lyrics make me kind of nostalgic but doesn't stand out to me.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (5): The keyboard after the chorus sounds too much like the last song. I like the flow of the lyrics more than a lot of the other songs. It's too short to me, doesn't really reach an emotional conclusion. Mitski sounds bored singing this?

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I just don’t like the melody in combination with the lyrics and production. It just seems uneven to me.

**frogaranaman** (4): The syncopated rhythm is like she's trying to tell us she attended a music conservatory.

**radiofan15** (2.5): Connie Converse outsold and she didn't even released anything during her career

I think this is the bottom of Kacey's otherwise very good album. Her otherwise heroic writing is here substituted for easy references to a certain superheroine (~~Black Widow~~). Otherwise, musically, it is still a decent-to-good pop-country song.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): gal gadot retired!

**leviswift13** (9): such a beautiful statement on long-term relationships

**Really\_Creative** (9): A song that I didn't like on my first listen but after a couple of re-listens I've grown to appreciate.

**ryjomom** (9): there is a reason I won’t see action films in the movies, cause baby im a kacey stan

**vhqv1997** (9): Gal Gadot is shaking

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): kinda the same issue as velvet elvis as i feel it doesn't add much to the overall album, and it might have done well without. but in any case i find wonder woman a much better song

**Leixander** (8.5): This feels like a throwback to Pageant Material and I love it.

**ManofOranges** (8.5): I heard this song playing in a Kohl's one time Kacey really is out here getting that radio play.

**radiofan15** (8.2): Gal Gadot, Lynda Carter and Adrianne Palicki (yes, she was WW for an unpicked TV pilot) found YEEHAWed to death

**c-ming** (8): countering the idea of love as cleansing, kacey absolves herself from the idol position, instead embracing love for what it is in this simple, catchy tune

**enecks** (8): wew

**passionfruits2** (8): WW1984 found dead

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is cute but again feels a bit meh compared to the other tracks on the album. The metaphor feels a bit overdone within the song.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): Don’t have a lot to say lol

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Significantly better than the 2017 film.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): This is the song on Golden Hour I almost never come back to, and what mystifies me about it is that people see it as one of the best songs on the record overall several others I’d call more deserving. I don’t hate Wonder Woman, but I’m not a fan of how Kacey sounds within the bounds of its hook, and overall I think that my clear bias against superheroes makes this song more of a miss than a hit. I’m not saying its bad (look, I’m still giving it a 7) but it’s absolutely nothing specia.

**frogaranaman** (6): Fun film.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): definitely wish this was better for the title

**kappyko** (6): i feel like this sounds like a mix of previous songs on the record

**vayyiqra** (6): I haven't seen Wonder Woman but I was told it was good. This song, however, is nothing special.

**waluigiest** (5): not really feeling the transitions and I’m kind of bored

**nooodisaster** (4): "I like the way this is going" Bitch I do not! The first half of this album focused mostly on Kacey's observations on the world and society, which I think is her strength. The second half is just endless mid-tempo, same production, single idea, generic singer-songwriter tunes, one after the other.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (3): The message is fine. Doesn't do anything for me.

With this song, all of the Kacey songs I think are mediorce are gone. Kacey does channel some of Elvis's sound on this song, but it doesn't quite mesh like some of the other pop/disco sound on the record.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): when i saw her i slutdropped to this minimum eleven times

**bespectacIed** (10): all she ever wanted was something classic and she yet she's the one who delivered a classic

**gothheart** (10): harvest festival party teas

**Really\_Creative** (10): Such a fun little bop, should NOT be as catchy as it is

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): i hate both velvet and elvis but love this

**enecks** (9): Wow Velvet can make anything good, even Elvis.

**foxxglove\_** (9): ive seen this rated as the worst in a lot of places but theres something so charmingly schlocky about it

**radiofan15** (8.8): I had to look what the fuck a Velvet Elvis was and it made me question how would anyone be jealous of one of those things

**kappyko** (8.5): you appreciate this song more when you realize what a velvet elvis is

**Leixander** (8.5): Most people think this is the worst song in this album but I love it so much. It may be a bit basic but it is cute and has great replay value, I love to sing along.

**leviswift13** (8): BOPPITY BOPPITY

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is a little cheesy but i like it

**silkypanties22** (8): I love the spacey vocal processing

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is a huge bop that everyone out there is forgetting about.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): Very peppy and positive I guess

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Fuck Elvis. I’d insert some Public Enemy lyrics here, but the idea that the guy was racist was probably a myth. What is true, though, is that Elvis had a strange thing for teenage girls that I’ve never been able to get over, and that’s not even bringing into account debates about whitewashing rock and roll for a wider and much whiter audience through Elvis’s output too. But we’re not talking about Elvis here. We’re taking about Kacey. Velvet Elvis is, in my opinion, unfairly picked on as the worst song on Golden Hour. Sure, it’s not excellent, but Velvet Elvis has some groove to it that makes me enjoy listening to it when I put on the entire album. At the very least, I prefer it to Wonder Woman.

**c-ming** (7): kacey embraces kitsch

**frogaranaman** (7): The beat reminds me of 'Slow Hands' in the best way possible. (Both songs are bops!)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It’s cute but for Kacey it’s lyrically a bit lazy

**Kaylaboe** (7): the weakest song on the album, and the only one i’d cut out. it doesn’t really have the same impact as the rest of the songs

**1998tweety** (6.5): Unlike a bunch of other songs on the album, this anti-grew on me. At first I liked it cause it bopped, but know I find it a bit meh compared to the other tracks. The chorus is a little grating and the lyrics are done better on other tracks like Butterflies or Golden Hour.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (6): I love the baseline. The yeehawness still kind of hurts but I like this song. It's kind of groovy. Good production.

**ManofOranges** (6): Found dead on a toilet thanks to a drug overdose.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (5): This song tricked me into thinking we were finally going to get a higher energy track but honestly it just sounds like a less catchy derivative of "Slow Hands" by Niall Horan

**passionfruits2** (5): Kacey missed here.

**waluigiest** (5): vocals are nice but I’m irritated

**nooodisaster** (4): A disposable (also called disposable product) is a product designed for a single use after which it is recycled or is disposed as solid waste. The term often implies cheapness and short-term convenience rather than medium to long-term durability. The term is also sometimes used for products that may last several months (e.g. disposable air filters) to distinguish from similar products that last indefinitely (e.g. washable air filters). The word "disposables" is not to be confused with the word "consumables" which is widely used in the mechanical world. In welding for example, welding rods, tips, nozzles, gas, etc. are considered to be "consumables" as they last only a certain amount of time before needing to be replaced.

**vayyiqra** (4): While Mitski had the most random simile in this rate [the first line in "Two Slow Dancers"] Kacey wins for most bizarre metaphor.

**ryjomom** (2): it stands out from the album and not in a good way

This song is kind of interesting in structure, with very short verses constrasted with a longer chorus. It is also an interesting choice considering Mitski is not married. It's also an interesting contrast to the rest of the album. Many songs are about Mitski's longing to be near someone, whereas this one is about a long term relationship that is successful albiet boring.

---
**Awkward\_King** (10): honestly this is my favorite track from the album (and the rate) along with nobody. idk what it is because this is a middle track for most people but i fucking love it

**bespectacIed** (10): She really made a song about literally being Boo Boo The Fool, when will your faves

**enecks** (10): This is such a composition

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok a bop

**kappyko** (10): the piano riff is beautiful

**Really\_Creative** (10): A rare happy song from Mitski and it ain't even that happy. But I love SO MUCH about this song, it's my lowkey second choice for an 11. Right from the get go she has my attention and she just lets me have it.

**Leixander** (9.5): Song version of trying to live happily ever after. Isn't "But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved" something we all want to relate?

**Kaylaboe** (9): this is such a cute song

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Half the songs on another album on this rate are about Kacey Musgraves’s new husband, so Mitski having a song about possible martial problems is about as interesting as last month’s rate having songs by gay men contradictingly titled Lucky Strike and Lucky Escape. I don’t know if I can really explain why I find Me and My Husband so good, because it’s explicitly about a romantic relationship, and I happen to be a very unromantic kind of person when it comes to monogamous, long-term partnerships, but if I have to pin some special quality down to it, I’d probably like to mention how the song’s fanfare-inducing atmosphere creates an impression of a married couple learning to manage themselves and fall in love over again within a compelling background of a bustling urban town filled with streetlights, traffic, and considerable pollution. I might just be talking out of my ass here, though. Maybe Mitski actually lives in Alabama. Maybe she and her husband are part of an anarchist commune of sad indie musicians in the desert. I wouldn’t know.

**1998tweety** (8): This gives off some minor jazzy vibes, I dig it.

**survivorjdmarina** (8): Mitski croonibg here sounds nice

**leviswift13** (7.5): if the beatles were actually a bunch of e-girls

**c-ming** (7): love the instrumentals in this domestic fantasy

**nooodisaster** (7): The first time I listened to this (& knowing nothing about her but the 6 songs preceding this) I was like, there is no way this is autobiographical this chick is a lesbian.

**vayyiqra** (7): This is the weirdest thing ever, but the synth in this song is making me nostalgic for my childhood and playing Sonic the Hedgehog with my brothers on a crappy old CRT television. Random? Yeah, I know. But I'm a 90s kid.

**waluigiest** (7): no more men

**Roxieloxie** (6): not that much of a fan

**frogaranaman** (5): Is she even trying anymore, or is she just hoping the gays instill meaning into her songs?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I dig the chorus on this until it gets annoying near the end but the rest of this track just seems filler-y, sorry.

**radiofan15** (3): And people dareto say J.Lo can't sing? at least she's not doing this kind of heteronormative bullshit (Jackoff's words, not mine)

**Cubascastrodistrict** (0): That goddamn post chorus keyboard again? I actually liked it the first time I heard it but the third time it's getting old. I feel like this song is meant to have some sort of emotion to it but it just doesn't.

The soaring intro to this song feel's right at home among Janelle's asthetic, but does not fit with this song. A six minute long slow song, it all kind of blends together. I legitamitely forgot this song existed when I was first putting together the materials for this rate. This song does do some things well, but they are all done much better elsewhere in the album as well.

---
**enecks** (10): hey this is good

**ManofOranges** (10): Really like this song. It's very laid back but just beautiful.

**radiofan15** (10): Ergh I really respect her and everything but I don't think is is as good as most people have been saying.... WAIT IS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING RADIOHEAD SAMPLE?!?!?!?! TAKE ME 10 YOU BITCH

**waluigiest** (10): this song made me warm tea with dairy free milk

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): something about the cinematic nature of it and the extended runtime reminds me of Babopbye Ya which is a total serve

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): i adore this song. it’s following a bunch of high-energy bangers, and this is such a welcome and i love how introspective it is. 6 minutes long and it maximises every second of it

**Really\_Creative** (9.5): This song is so moody and dreamy, I'm not always in the right place to listen to it, unlike a lot of the album, but there's nothing like listening to this on a lazy, rainy day.

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): It's so interesting that This song and So Afraid are next to each other because these are the ones i'm most likely to skip. However hearing this one live really made me appreciate it more

**Cubascastrodistrict** (9): Love this, very slow, oddly funky, and very personal.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (9): Feels like a classic Janelle song

**leviswift13** (9): perfect for emo hours

**stansymash** (8.6): this song is so warm and lovely and it flies by every time

**survivorjdmarina** (8): I'm really liking the chill 2000's R&B vibe, along with Janelle's breezy vocal performance.

**c-ming** (7): the song is so fragile, with vocals and instrumentals seeming so quiet and fragile

**frogaranaman** (7): So, so sensual and so, so good.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): A sweet song that's a little slow for me

**rosecoloreds** (7): a bit too long for my taste

**silkypanties22** (7): chord progression is pretty and sad

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): It’s great to finally have a slower, more pensive track on the record to take a breath, and this one is pretty forgotten when this album is being discussed, but it’s a tender and smooth affair. It’s a little long, but it doesn’t quite overstay its welcome.

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is very smooth, but doesn't stand out to me. It has a nice atmosphere though.

**kappyko** (6.5): the strings SNAPPED but i almost fell asleep sorry

**nooodisaster** (6): I mean.... it's long y'all. Mitski can play an entire EP before this song finishes. Unlike her rate partners, I think ballads are Janelle's weakness, and with this I just don't feel much listening to this. Good lullaby tho.

**passionfruits2** (6): At this point in the album I wanted something different from Ms. Monáe. This song is good, don't get me wrong, but I can see similarities in tone and lyrical subjects on this song with other previous songs in the album.

**yourhostandpatron** (6): Haha, get it? Don’t Judge Me is six minutes, so I’m giving it a six as a score! I’m a genius! My love for subtlety is unparalleled! I really wish I could say I love Don’t Judge Me as much as most of Dirty Computer, but even if the song starts off as relatively strong, it all becomes a bit worn out and messy the further and further it goes on. Melodically, it’s already comparatively week to the best of Janelle’s work on this record, and stretching the song out for two minutes more isn’t exactly a great way to make your average listener find merits in it that’ll make them end up giving it another chance. Don’t Judge Me isn’t…a bad song, but being so close to the end ruins the momentum of Dirty Computer just a little bit, which is part of the reason why I’m not quite as captivated towards it as our other two albums.

**1998tweety** (5): This song has no business being 6 minutes long. It's not even a good song either and it being way too long does not do it any favours either.

**Leixander** (5): I like the first few mintues but it overstays its welcome and has no replay value sadly.

**ryjomom** (5): my gay brain barely made it through this 6 minute song

**vhqv1997** (5): This song has no business being this long when it's so repetitive

**gannade** (4.5): why is this 6 minutes long

A very short but sweet song about Kacey's mom. Fun Fact #1: This was one song Kacey wrote while on LSD. Fun Fact #2: When I saw Kacey Live in San Francisco earlier this year, her mother was in the audience, and this was a very emotional song.

---
**1998tweety** (10): I know this song is gonna get robbed because of its length, but its such a cute song that always makes me miss my mom (even if it's only been a few days since I've seen her). The song conveys emotion so strongly that it can do it in a little over a minute.

**gothheart** (10): a sad yeehaw bop

**Leixander** (10): Most of us felt the things this song conveys as we grow up, but hearing it straight from an external source still hurts.

**leviswift13** (10): a truly sad, beautiful, aching little moment

**radiofan15** (9.7): AMAZING, SHOWSTOPPING, FANTASTIC... why is this shorter than Old Time Road tho?

**didney-worl** (9.5): cool I'm crying that's fine

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): this is so short and sweet but it still manages to reduce me to tears

**Really\_Creative** (9.5): A little short but the message comes across very clear. It's not quite as amazing for me as the big hitters on this album but like, imagine thinking it deserves less than an 8

**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): such a pretty interlude

**enecks** (9): this is sweet.

**letsallpoo** (9): this is beautiful fuck everyone who gives it a low score because of its length

**survivorjdmarina** (9): This is really cute and atmospheric. I'm liking this.

**c-ming** (8): i love how abrupt this song is in the entire song order, just like how these outbursts of appreciation and love can come at very unexpected timings.

**nooodisaster** (8): On my first listen when I got to this song I was like "oh my gosh, finally a song I'm feeling!" And then it was over within 80 seconds lmao.

**passionfruits2** (8): my mom doesn't like this song. I actually showed it to her and she hated it. I think I like it more now.

**stansymash** (8): hell yea mothers

**waluigiest** (8): I miss my mom :(

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Mother is a weird little quasi-interlude that I’ve always liked, even though I don’t really know how to feel about it as a complete song. It definitely does its job as a transition on Golden Hour’s tracklist. One thing I will say about is that, all things considered, I’m not surprised Kacey wrote this on acid. This is nowhere near as trippy as some music you’d be able to listen to, but the sense of nostalgia throughout this brief stop emanates in a slightly pleasant yet dizzying way. And, speaking of which, is every comment about this song going to mention acid? Is this going to go into a pile of comments with a cheesy header that’s cantered around all the users that pay attention to the fact that Kacey wrote this on acid? I’m curious to know the answer to these questions. Is this all a bit too meta?

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (7): Would have gotten a higher score but it was too short and felt more like an interlude than a song, where the short songs on "Be the Cowboy" didn't feel that way

**Roxieloxie** (7): this could be a mitski song

**ryjomom** (7): this song is as raw as my hole after getting pounded with call me mother by rupaul playing in the background

**tapdancingpig** (7): Sweet little interlude.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A short but fulfilling track.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): That was unexpectedly short

**ManofOranges** (6): Pretty song and all but I don't really like it. Good thing it's really just an interlude though.

**vhqv1997** (6): I demand the rest of the song

**frogaranaman** (4): I honestly do not remember this song. It finished three seconds ago.

**kappyko** (4): i love u mom

**Cubascastrodistrict** (3): Piano, interesting. This song is... sweet I guess. Seems more like an interlude.

**vayyiqra** (0): This song began, it was starting to be okay, and then it was over. I can't even give it a rating, so I'm going to give it my 0.

A mid or low tier song from Be The Cowboy. Musically, I feel like this fits better on Puberty 2 or some other older Mitski album. Thematically, it does fit here as another song about Mitski's tortured relationships.

---
**Awkward\_King** (10): just great

**enecks** (10): Can I get a sad yeehaw in the replies

**kappyko** (10): the vocals served were excellent

**Leixander** (10): I will probably never experience something like this, a one-night affair to escape feeling lonely but feeling even lonelier and dumb in the end because the intense emotion of love you felt for the other person was not mutual and sadly pointless, but I felt that. And that's the magic with her music really.

**leviswift13** (10): obvious candidate for lyric of the album is "nobody butters me up like you, and nobody fucks me like me"

**stansymash** (10): this is the most underrated song on the album and has the best lyrics. i also like how both the words in the title start with the letter 'L'. visionary

**vhqv1997** (10): This song is a 10 just because of the line "Nobody fucks me like me". Because, honestly? Same. But also? Same.

**waluigiest** (10): nobody fucks me like me.

**1998tweety** (9): This song is actually really cute and kind of relatable, I wish it was longer though.

**c-ming** (9): the companion to old friend. the song starts with a jaunty vibe, which is undermined before the bridge, melting away the facade only to find, yet again, loneliness.

**Really\_Creative** (9): "Cause no one butters me up like you, and nobody fucks me like me" just YES, the rest of the song isn't quite up to the quality of the rest of the album but those two lines just sell the song for me

**plastichaxan** (8): We got you, we got you, yeah.

**gothheart** (7.5): it feels kinda off in the grand scheme of the album, but overall still good

**ManofOranges** (7.5): I really liked the outro.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Lonesome Love is sort of a more romantic, more…scandalous version of Old Friend, which is only a couple of tracks behind it. Unfortunately, I’m not exactly sure it’s the most effective cousin of Old Friend, which I’d call the most underrated track on Be The Cowboy. I can’t figure out why I don’t like Lonesome Love all that much, or why it’s a song that makes the magic of this album lost on me for awhile, despite featuring some of the most interesting elements of Mitski’s artistry that make me love a majority of tracks on this album. Maybe it’s the misplaced harshness of ‘nobody fucks me like you do’, or maybe it’s just my inability to relate to the entirety of the song’s lyrical themes. Either way, I still enjoy it a little, but it’s not in my interests for it to score high.

**foxxglove\_** (7): the one thing i want in life is for mitski to be happy :(

**radiofan15** (7): Finally something listeneable... I don't like it at all BUT it's surrounded by shit so it wins by default... also did we really needeed that last ten seconds of white noise on this sub-2 minutes long track?

**silkypanties22** (7): cool and unexpected lyrics

**survivorjdmarina** (7): It's noice, it's different, it's unusual

**nooodisaster** (6): This is Plodding Mitski. Plodding Mitski is boring.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Another short but decent track that honestly just makes me wish these songs were fleshed out instead of the indie versions of XXXTENTACION songs (Before you come at me I’m a fan of her and I’m used to her short tracks but these seem half-baked in comparison so goodbye).

**vayyiqra** (5): I was liking the first few tracks on the album before this came on, and then the synths mysteriously disappeared and it became college radio-core. [And believe me, I work at a college radio station, so I know what I'm talking about.] It isn't bad, it's just ... bland.

**frogaranaman** (3): The song title is tea, I always feel alone no matter who I'm in love with.

**Cubascastrodistrict** (1): This song didn't do it for me. It's too short to have an impact and again, Mitski sounds bored.

Take a Byte is a fairly simple pop song, with (i think) some questionable choices on the production. Compared to the rest of the album, you know Janelle can do better. This almost feels like something that was written to help explain the context of Emotion Picture (which is very good, please stream it).

---
**enecks** (10): I am obliged to give this a 10 because it's a horny song with computer references.

**Leixander** (10): Underrated gem right here. I love the somber instrumental and the great looping instrumental in the background.

**yourhostandpatron** (10): There’s not as much of a technological emphasis on Dirty Computer than what some people may have been hoping for, but hopefully Take A Byte should satisfy their complaints. I didn’t think much about it aside from the impression that it was obviously excellent for awhile, but on my most recent revisits towards the song I’ve found that it’s a great representation of the sensual, secretive, hidden affection between queer women that we happen to come across so often in real life, a theme which makes it all the more loveable to your average, passionate, depressed young homosexual (such as myself). The Prince influence strengthens these qualities all the more for me; I’ve felt that there’s a sore lack of lesbian readings of Prince’s music that we’ve all collectively ignored for some reason (I mean, come on, guys, can’t you see the potential I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man has to be about gay girls?! Sheesh, people, can’t you get a hint?!) Janelle channelling all of that makes me love this song.

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): Now this is the start of a killer streak on this album. The guitars in the intro of this song sound very Prince-esque and summery, and I love the flow of Janelle’s singing.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Never have I wanted to let a computer take my virginity more since Mr. Robot aka Rami Malek cause idk what the show is actually about, so I'm just gonna assume he's a robot in the show.

**Really\_Creative** (9): Sexy and fun, but something about it doesn't seem quite as iconic as the rest of the album. However, it's still amazing and quite the bop

**stansymash** (8.7): i don't know my computey mumbo jumbo, but isnt byte little

**foxxglove\_** (8.5): this makes me feel sumn

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I love how this really fits in with the ‘dirty computer’ theme of the album. It’s a fun and sexy song.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): your teeth in my neck 🧛‍♀️ it’s a funky banger but it’s also easily one of the weaker tracks on the album

**tapdancingpig** (8.4): I love the low key disco vibe here?

**c-ming** (8): im a sucker for sexy songs with religious imagery, especially those with instrumentals as groovy as this

**vayyiqra** (8): I love the beat to this! What a bop!

**waluigiest** (8): on the one hand I think some of the wordplay with computers is corny, but on the other hand...... “my random access memory wants you to come again” went there

**1998tweety** (7.5): This song is so groovy and chill. It dips enough into the film fantasy that Janelle created, but can also stand well on its own.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): worst song on the album which is a hot take apparently

**frogaranaman** (7): Ahaha, it's 'byte' because the album theme is about computers.

**J\_Toe** (7): If each song on this album represents a facet of Janelle's identity, I feel this song is a reflection on religion, playing on the themes of Eva and the fruit of Eden. Though it again achieves an Afrofuturist aesthetic in the bite/byte pun, because this album is about people as Dirty Computers needing to be cleaned. Though, as a religious commentary, this song is also about women's autonomy and agency.

**passionfruits2** (7): I don't love it, but it has a great beat, and her voice is so soft here it gives me chills.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): One of the weaker moment son the album for sure, but it’s not bad by any means. Just a bit more forgettable than some of the other, greater tracks.

**radiofan15** (6.7): Cute and nicely done but it kinda goes nowhere

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): this just... goes on too long despite only being like a 4 minute song

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (6): Groovy but forgettable

**leviswift13** (6): there is obviously so much intellectual thought put it into this song, but i think that the production is kinda dull and the melody is flat. lyrics are so smart tho

**nooodisaster** (6): This isn't AS iconic to me, and prob my least fav uptempo song on the album. Still, the lyrics are clever.

**ryjomom** (6): funky 101010111010101011010101!

**silkypanties22** (4): cringey lyrics

**kappyko** (0): the chorus is so underwhelming it really upsets me. then they repeat it again and again and i feel more disappointed because despite all of this sweetness it's so empty and barren.

deleted: This song is representative of *Dirty Computer* as a whole for me, in that it doesn't quite live up to its *full* potential but Janelle still makes it slap through raw talent and vision. I think the album could have been a straight up masterpiece if she took the time to tighten up most of the songs (except "Make Me Feel" which is flawless) and create better transitions, but the fact that it was still my favorite of 2018 says a lot.

edit: this made my reaction to the song sound lukewarm and I want to make it clear that I fucking love "Take A Byte" and I'm sorry that yall don't smh

This was not originally a song I liked, but the episode of Song Exploder that focuses on this song really changed my opinion. Some of the things that inspired this song, including a trip to the dentist, seem like such banal fears. But it all comes together in such a way that it becomes so powerful and moving. Obviously not a song that was going to end up in the top 10 of this rate, but it should have made it much further.

---
**Cubascastrodistrict** (10): The build in this song is amazing.

**Leixander** (10): The build-up to the climax is wonderful.

**ManofOranges** (10): Bitch me too the fuck

**plastichaxan** (10): So underrated in the album, every single element here elevates the song, just wow. So close to be my 11.

**Roxieloxie** (10): An emotional sucker punch.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Usually, when artists release a song about political unrest, there’s a disconnect. It never truly feels scary, and that’s just the nature of music. Short of including guttural screams or dizzying chants, getting that message across always falls short. Is it because seeing a photograph of someone affected by civil unrest does so much more, as pictures are worth a thousand words? Who knows. And, yes, I know this song isn’t quite about being afraid of the future, but in a way, it is. Janelle expresses fear for loving, fear of being in a world where people aren’t safe loving who they want to love, and in this way, this song is a somber, brutal, visceral moment in an album full of those. It’s incredibly vulnerable and makes for one of the best tracks on the record.

**ExtraEater** (9.5): slow burner

**enecks** (9): this is a mood

**Kaylaboe** (9): https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/433716930252374036.png?v=1

**waluigiest** (9): very good. When she yells? woah

**Brendon-Urine** (8): I really appreciate the production and mood. Definitely a standout for me.

**leviswift13** (8): when she takes it up the octave, i felt it

**passionfruits2** (8): The beggining of the song is the most impactful part, it's what convinces you to keep listening. Here, Ms. Monáe captivated me in her initial words. Love it.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Ugh, she sounds so good here.

**vhqv1997** (8): When the bridge kicked in and the guitar started riffing, I ascended. But otherwise, this song had the potential to be much more powerful, but she didn't push it hard enough

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is nice, this type of track feels a bit mandatory on each album, but Janelle's idea on a slower more ballad-esque track doesn't feel same-y or boring. It carries the same kind of vibe she's created throughout the rest of the album, and in doing so this doesn't feel like tacked on or like filler.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): I don't have much to say about this honestly.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): The amount of songs that’ve been more or less written in response to all the political catastrophes that have taken place across the world since 2016 make up an already intimidating canon, and So Afraid is another addition to the trend that’s worth discussing despite some flaws. Though perhaps not as masterful as MUNA’s ‘Crying on the Bathroom Floor’, So Afraid features imagery not often traversed in modern pop music. Painting a picture of chaos and woe entirely caused by the actions of regular humans, there hasn’t quite been a song that provides such a poignant description of terror that was, that is, and that is to come since Prince’s Sign O’ The Times. All this makes me guiltier over the fact that I don’t appreciate So Afraid as much as I used to. Maybe a fault in the song’s production prevents me from making me see its true glory? I’ve heard it’s better live, so that wouldn’t be a shock.

**c-ming** (7): love the instrumental swelling in the middle of the song

**ImADudeDuh** (7): [2]

**nooodisaster** (7): To me, this is the more successful ballad. The lyrics aren't flawless, but the raw emotional delivery of that climax gives this SO many points for me.

**silkypanties22** (7): great vocals

**vayyiqra** (7): This is probably the closest thing to filler on the album. It's not bad, it's just there.

**kappyko** (6.5): gorgeous vocal harmonies and a whole lot of nothing except for that beautiful instrumental breakdown

**radiofan15** (6.1): It went FUCKING nowhere... I had to relisten to it several times in order to sort-of get it

**frogaranaman** (6): It's personal but I really have no opinion on this song.

**ryjomom** (6): You ain’t special, I think we are ALL So Afraid
