leafsnash61: Hi everyone! I hope you all enjoyed day two of the rate. All that hard work is paying off! :)

Apologies for any errors along the way, completely unintentional. Any mistakes are entirely on me and not on superr_rad.

I wish I could have been here following along but I will be present for day three tomorrow. Get hype!

Albert_Cole: On the one hand, Kesha said in [her New York Times interview](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/30/magazine/kesha-lawsuit-dr-luke.html?_r=0) that Tik Tok was actually intended to be more openly ironic, and she was told to dumb it down by Dr Luke. So though I love Kesha, the song has soured on me because of the problematic context in which it was written and produced. And even ignoring that, it hasn't aged all that well.

On the other hand, **fite me irl if you think it's worse than Too Close**

We have our first Gay Icon leaving the rate. Barbra deserved better, you should all be ashamed. This was recorded for a movie of the same title, but I think its safe to say Barbra stole the show. Truly a legendary talent. 


------------------------------------------------------- 

#I LIKE IT THIS WAY

**joshually**: KWEEN BABS we are not worthy. Your impeccable enunciation of every syllable infuses me with the holy spirit.

**the_monkey_:** I guess it’s fine if you're into goopy ballads, which is kinda Barbara's specialty.

**[therokinrolla](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6ejoyw/rate_2013_ultimate_album_rate_artpop_vs_beyonc%C3%A9/):**  this is a gorgeous track. Her voice is beautiful and yadda yadda yadda take my 9

**misstututulle**: Oscar winning, tearjerking legend!

**Elitefourbrad**: Queen Barbara giving us the best song about a former lover that I’ve heard in a long time. Great vocals accompanied by a great instrumental ends up being one of my favorites of all time.

**enecks:** A VOCAL TALENT WHEN WILL YOUR FAVES EVER. A good choice for #1, though shoutout to Bennie and the Jets, a song so good that it still gets plagiarized.

**Hopelesslyemoted**: Totally serene.

**MrSwearword**: the only Barbara song worth a damn. SALUT.

**ThatParanoidPenguin:** I really don't care for her music - it's not at all bad but it's really not my thing. I'm not gonna let that bias get in my way, though; on The Way We Were, Streisand knows when to be quiet and when to be bombastic, and it's quite an atmospheric song.

**dropthehammer11**: Her voice is fucking angelic. Arguably the greatest pop voice of all time

**Zamomattel**: STREISANDDDD this song is actually kind of boring but her voice is stunning af
 
-----------------------------------------------------------

#THERE’S A REASON IT’S NOT “THE WAY WE ARE”...

**johnazoidberg-**: Why did the 70s love ballads so much?

**whatyourheartdesires**: quoting wikipedia: The Way We Were is a 1973 American romantic drama film, and that's what it sounds like

**camerinian:** Don’t let your music-inept friends use this list as a reference point for the 70’s, because I refuse to believe that this bland garbage was representative of the masses and everything that was going on

**Jelboo**: Meh I'm sorry. A 6 for me means 'it's better than the average song'. I don't like average songs, I like songs that are good. This is 'ok', I don't mind it, but that's all.

**PandoraKris:** My first Barbara Streisand song! I think I'll like it... Ummm, forget about it.

**DrunkHurricane**: I had to listen to this like 10 times to remember how it goes

**[jess_22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imOzfOqsLWk):** nothing really stands out on this

#HENCE BARBRA INSTEAD OF BARBARA

**OxfordSemicolon:**  I think Barbra pronounces it "memries" because she hates vowels.

The only somewhat-country song in the rate is out! [I’m so glad nobody else has a song of the same name!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathe_(song)) This the second song ever to peak at #2 on the Hot 100 and still be the year-end #1, so that just shows you how powerful the country audience can be..^^^which ^^^we ^^^also ^^^know ^^^from ^^^the ^^^election^^^^^lol^^^^^ihaterepublicans



Leaf has something to say:

**Are you guys seriously going to do this to /u/NapsAndNetflix? He's a nice guy, damn it. He's done nothing worse than being a [Winnipeg Jets fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hNOJqiJb-E), OK? Just because he likes terrible music - and country music - doesn't mean he's a bad guy. As for the song, it was the second song at the time to hold the distinction of topping the year end charts despite never spending a week at the top of the weekly charts. Faith Hill unfortunately is not related to [Hank Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amKyA2PrSu4).**
----------------------------------------------------------
 
#BREATHING

**poppinmmolly:** I forgot this song existed!! Omgg I love it!

**NapsAndNetflix**: country music? in my popheads? ew delete it it's another genre of music i don't like variety

**letsallpoo:** Those riffs leading into the chorus are EVERYTHING

**TragicKingdom1**: I have to admit that I generally like ballads less than other songs because they don't hold my interest but I think the combination of Faith's vocals and the instrumentation makes this pretty interesting.

**MrSwearword**: this should’ve been #1 on the Hot 100…like regulation…

**chanelephant**: queen of country-pop crossover jams

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: 2000s bop right here. It's amazing how much this set the stage for the next half-decade of pop.

**Banananaise**: i was going to say that america is weird but tbh this is good

**jess_22**: ok normally i hate country but this is a bop

**Skyblade79**: Honestly legendary! The way that she changes her voice so much sounds amazing and gives this song so many Moments.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: Faith Hill was robbed of a number one bottom line cut and dry

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**:  invented inhalation (and peaking #2 hot 100 but #1 year-end)

**tevinterimperium:**  amazing song. the only country song on the list. represent us southern legend.

**therokinrolla**:  I was bored by really basic country but then **THAT REALLY BIG AND LOUD HOOK COMES THROUGH AND SLAYS YOU
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------

#SUFFOCATING

**Zamomattel:** Hmmm this song is DULLL

**vapourlomo**:  Boring soccer-mom country? I'll pass. Shania was better.

**mokitsu**: well choke

**Ispilledsomething**: This is bad in a very uninteresting way.

**Dustinhaltom**:  Being from the South, I've heard enough country to know I'm not a fan of it.

**ffourthofjuly:** is this country if so i don’t like it, if not i still don’t like it

**Jelboo:** This is exactly the type of music I don’t like.

**Magic_warlock0-**: UGH I've had my fill of this song forever. Faith Hill has a good voice, but this song is not powerful or inspiring at all.

**Inguss:** I’m not American so it sounds boring to me

**nerfherder01:**  I should hate this because it popularized auto-tune, but how can you hate a song with a line as iconic as “Do you believe in life after love”?

This is a chill, summery track about the woes of wanting to fuck your teacher. I mean honestly… relatable; so relatable it topped the billboard chart for 5 weeks. Yeah, that was all it took back then. I’m not saying she didn’t deserve it, but that same year had [plenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Year-End_Hot_100_singles_of_1967) of bops. May Lulu’s horny plea RIP. (In this rate, not in real life. She’s definitely still alive maybe.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------
#WRITTEN WITH LOVE
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** A nice little song, definitely feels very 1967. I like the strings, but they clash a bit too much with her voice sometimes too.

**Banananaise:** the name is creepy as hell but the chorus BANGS. i can't help but remember when Sasheer and Cecily sang this song on SNL to farewell Obama, which was possibly the most awkward and cringeworthy 2 minutes of live television in history

**Eribertknows**: Nice and calm. Could see myself falling asleep to it while regretting past decisions.

**Magic_warlock0-**: Love the strength of her voice. I can gel to this, as it's low-key

**Calltehshots**: my sis lulu did that. this is a just a killer song and a great way to start off the this rate.

**Skyblade79:** This is really what oldies music should be like. I could imagine my grandparents dancing to this. It’s just so sweet.

**Joshually:** Reminds me of Aria & Mr. Fitz’s forbidden love in the masterpiece TV show “Pretty Little Liar”. You could NOT play with Lulu’s voice though, that is pure white female vocal prowess!

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD:** this bitch is so dickmatized, honestly me

**Elitefourbrad:** I really like this song after hearing it for the first time. The relaxing vocals from Lulu carry you through the strings with melodies galore, a great song!

**Awryj:** I didn't expect this to be this nice!

**Angusaditus**: Queen Lulu killed it on this track, the delivery is so great

**Enecks**: OK this is good stuff. Lulu’s vocals are a little bit out of their element at times, but the instrumentation patches any problems they might have pretty well. A respectable choice for the #1.

**HopelesslyEmoted**: Satisfying buildup to hook and chorus

**Berober04:** Just a really chill song. A pleasure.

**Dirdbub**: this is exactly how I expected the late 1960s to sound and I LOVE it. I can’t really think of a thing wrong with this song, it’s just so smooth and awesome

__________________________________________

#WRITTEN WITH DISINTEREST
 
**Pugglemaster:** A cute little song, probably wouldn't listen to it again

**Ispilledsomething:** Solid enough song, don't really have a strong opinion on it.

**Tragickingdom1:** Cute but not memorable. I like the message though.

**Mrswearword**: sweet vocals but this is kind of creepy.

**Johnazoidberg-**: This is more boring than the series finale of Girls

**MariahGr8rThnJesus:** WTF, is this song about incest? Also she looks like a Chucky doll on the cover

**Lassidoggy:** Lulu is giving us some good vocals, but the shitty production drags it down.

**Look_A_Fangirl**: To Sir With KILL ME. I am bored. Crayons to perfume is a concerning line by the way, makes it sound like they turned from a kindergartener into a stripper or something. Just why.

**cedollete:** i'd maybe like this song more if someone else sang it but... honestly i just don't like lulu's voice very much. i'm not docking it too much for that because i get that this was before autotune, and the song's pretty 

**Camerinian:** I try to keep an open mind, and I recognise it has objectively good qualities, this just does absolutely nothing for me

The first disco entry to reach year-end #1, please watch [Spidey dance](http://i.imgur.com/qswO0HC.gif) to this. I personally am a huge BeeGees stan, and even disco haters are digging this bop, but like twat_brained says, this outperforming “Stayin Alive” is pretty weird. 



-------------------------------------------------- 

#DACE LIKE NO ONE IS LOOKING

**[chanelephant](https://media.giphy.com/media/xTiTnr0lQObHdzDeWA/giphy.gif)**: classic mom jam

**dropthehammer11**: THIS SHIT IS SO FUNKY. I'M PELVIC THRUSTING AT THIS MOMENT

**eklxtreme**: i had no idea the bee gees had solo careers (besides barry gibb)! this is pretty much another bee gees song but that's a very good thing

**twat_brained**: The Bee Gees are the absolute undisputed kings of disco. Whether together or solo, they were absolutely legendary. Considering how big “Stayin’ Alive” was, I’m surprised that IT wasn’t the #1 song of 1978.

**ffourthofjuly**: its oddly funky, and i was dancing all the way throughout without even realizing it,, DISCO SUX though

**clipeuh:** great disco from one of the kings of disco.

**nerfherder01**: the Gibb brothers wrote the chorus in fucking ten minutes. And Andy was only 20 at the time. Freaking legends.

**misstututulle:** Good disco bop, died too young.

**superr_rad**: the chorus is weak but everything around it is great

**enecks**: This giving me Persona 5 vibes. Like Persona 5, I’m going to ignore that this song is kinda problematic because it’s a B O P. This and Staying Alive are both good #1 picks.

**HopelesslyEmoted**: Kind of expected more disco tracks up to this point. All the Gibbs were tremendously talented, come to think of it I'm surprised the Bee Gees haven't been represented. Not even Andy Gibb's best track but nice to see him here
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#STAY IN THE SHADOWS

**therokinrolla**: pls stay in the shadows and dont come out scary monster demon

**borpo**: I just have to say that the Bee Gees had such a great sound early on, and I have no idea why they chose to go disco and ruin it.

**vapourlomo**: This sounds like a C-grade Bee Gees castoff.

**AbnormalPopPunk**: -2 points for his voice, -.5 points just for fun

**TragicKingdom1**: I like the disco sound by don't like Gibb's vocals. 

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: This is wholly underwhelming as a disco song imo.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** Basically the definition of cheesy 70's disco for better or worse

**camerinian:** The disco groove on this is pretty tight, but I’d struggle to say I’d rather listen to this over regular Bee Gees

**atlastata**: Oh, disco. You burned so bright, so fast. P.S. Good riddance, because 6 out of the next 7 songs on this list are fantastic.

**joshually**: OMG this song hurts to listen to… it’s so douchey and cheesy. The Justin Timberlake of 1978, he is.

**TheKneesOfOurBees:** a disco staple, but also kind of awful
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#COME ON, EVEN PRINCE AND TAYLOR SWIFT ARE ON SPOTIFY…

I might cry. Boys II Men are nothing short of iconic, and lets not forget that One Sweet Day feat. Messiah holds the record for most # of weeks at #1 on the Hot 100! [Here’s a shitpost courtesy of my mother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKKmzmeU5-0)

----------------------------------------------------
 
#ONLY GREEN LIGHTS ON THIS ROAD
**
ThatParanoidPenguin**:  If you're not out on the streets blasting that Boyz II Men and singing along I can't be friends with you.

**[carly-rae-sremmurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btuCIXOhiSs)**: flawless harmonies. we need more boy bands like this

**dropthehammer11**: Boyz II Men invented sex.

**twat_brained:** I don't give Boys II Men enough credit; they're a fantastic vocal group! Also, the bridge kept reminding me of this

**Nerdy_boy_chris:**  An R&B classic, no other words are necessary.

**eribertknows**:  Invented R&B. Would be a 10 without the dude not even trying to sing and just talking over everyone.

**Magic_warlock0-**:  A love song for the ages, I love the power that the group brings to talking about love!

**Zamomattel**: Wow Boyz II Men were everywhere in the 90s. Anyway this slays

**skiddos**: omg the talking at the beginning made me crack up. love this song though.

**joshually**:  OMG BIIM was UNSTOPPABLE in the mid-90s for real. This song is so perfect though. The deep voice dude speaking during the bridge… such a classically 90s male R&B group move, and one that would have probably gotten me wet in the underoos.

**borpo**: What is the best R&B album of the 90s and why is it CoolHighHarmony?

**vapourlomo**: I'LL MAKE LOVE TO YO....oh wait, it's the other Boyz II Men ballad? Ah. This one is pretty good too, as far as 90s prom slow dance songs go, I guess. Not my cup of tea, but these dudes have some pipes.

**mokitsu**: okay this is cute as hell....reminds me of mariah....

-------------------------------------------------------
 
#DEAD-END

**Look_A_Fangirl**: Motownphilly where are you? WE NEED YOU!

**cedollete:** i had to drop a few points from this song because i reaaally don't like the talking breakdown after the second chorus. plus the verses feel a biiit creepy to me? like "you love me, you just don't know it yet"

**camerinian**: how did anyone ever take this remotely seriously like I’ve only ever heard spoken word shit like that from Whose Line Is It Anyway I refuse to believe this was once recorded sincerely

**Albert_Cole**: Please, for the sake of all of us, LET GO. JUST LET GO. She cheated on you! She left without saying goodbye! She absolutely, blatantly doesn't love you! Offering to let her back into your bed is not going to be a magical dealbreaker!

**Banananaise:**  i was going to make a worthless comment about how early 90s this song is, but instead i'm making a worthless comment about how he's singing about being c u c k e d and i hate myself for thinking that

**noideawhatever:** boooooorrriiing

**therokinrolla**: except the end of the road of this song takes almost 6 minutes jesus fucking christ

**Kioescport**: I will never get Boyz II Men.

**ImADudeDuh**: Boyz II Men have always been very meh

**BlasifeelsSwift:** boring, what kind of touchy-feely shit is this?

-------------------------------------------------------------
 
#BOY TOY NAMEDT TROY USED TO LIVE IN DETROIT

**[enecks](https://youtu.be/xWM5aSfrWPs)**: Confession – I don’t like 90’s boy band music at all. This is a sweet innocent song. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, I gotta mention that this blocked Baby Got Back from #1 of the year. Now as an ass woman, I feel qualified to say that is the most important song. If that had gotten the #1, it would be my easy 11. Fuck the beatles, that song is the peak of music. I am not joking around with this. If there’s a rate with that song, it gets my 11.

This calm saccharine-driven track is adored by white grandfathers everywhere. It stayed at #1 for four weeks, [completely on its own I’m guessing/s](http://gijoeinformation.com/gallery/albums/sixties/aro.jpg). This song sounds super sweet, pun intended, but those innuendos tho..it was 1969, after all. 

------------------------------------------------------
 
#OH SO SWEET

**nerfherder01:** I actually forgot how cool the verses are, awesome bassline!

**elitefourbrad**: An iconic song with iconic innuendo. It makes me want some Sugar, Sugar from Daddy Orlando Bloom.

**ForretressArtillery**: Invented virtual bands, gorillaz is shook

**awryj**: The music video alone is perfect.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I know I've been shitting on this song in the Discord channel, but this is honestly a really fun and upbeat song, so I'm giving it a relatively high 
score. I'm trash.

**BlasifeelsSwift**: iconic, https://vine.co/v/eXl6XwQhrDx

**Poppinmmolly**: Pretty good! I love that riff between "Sugar" and "Honey, Honey"

**Mrswearword:** It’s just a silly little song that’s more infectious than Zika.

**Ispilledsomething**: Fun little pop song.

**eklxtreme**: loving the classic 60s pop-rock vibe, funny how this was such a big song though

**johnazoidberg-**: So cheesy, but it's a classic. This song is lame but it's just plain fun.

**TheParanoidPenguin**: This goes squarely into the category of "songs I've heard incessantly and not known the name of." I like this chorus a lot, and it's iconic for a reason. The only problem I have is it's really most effective in small doses and I think it's almost too much to have the chorus as much as it's in this song. The bridge seriously helps, as does the different chorus, but I can't help feeling like the song is really just the chorus.

------------------------------------------------------------
 
#BITTER TO THE TONGUE
 
**camerinian:** Years of animated family comedies using this as the first date montage song have conditioned me to hate it. Sorry guys it’s not you it’s me

**Bananannaise**: jesus christ i had no idea this was a real song, i thought it was just background music for bad tv shows

**veryunfinished**: this is exactly the kind of music you’d expect the band from the old archie comics to make

**kioescport**: HOW IS THIS ONLY 3 MINUTES LONG SOMEBODY PLEASE END THIS NIGHTMARE

**Magic_warlock0-**: Song gives me diabetes of the ears every time I hear it. Just not excitable enough to be a song about getting that sugar from a lovely lady.

**cloudbustingmp3**: this is one of those songs that i'll never change if it's playing on something, but i don't ever remember actively wanting to listen to it

**superr_rad**: Flo Rida did it better...but did the animators for scooby doo do this video?

**dirdbub**: this is a non-song

**Tragickingdom1**: The OG bad pop song.

**atlastata**: The next time somebody talks to you about how terrible music is these days, remind them that in the year of Woodstock, a year when The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Johnny Cash, Neil Young, AND Creedence Clearwater Revival each released MULTIPLE albums, a song by the four lead characters of the Archie comic book was the #1 song of the year. Suck on that, defeners. #lewronggeneration

**vapourlomo:** This is an earworm in the worst way possible. Normally I can tolerate a good amount of pop cheese, but this is just too much. How was this toothless song the biggest song during the height of the LSD-fueled countercultural movement? And what on earth does Archie have to do with this? I always knew Jughead was the cooler one.

**ffourthofjuly:** this is one of the worst songs i have ever heard. that is no exaggeration whatsoever. like....... the melody drills itself into your head but not in a good way, the lyrics are so vapid and disposable, the whole song is just one of the most corny songs i have ever heard in my entire life! in the worst way possible i feel like this could function as one of those songs that is used in a horror movie for weird scary ironic purposes, like "tiptoe through the tulips" in insidious

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#RIVERDALE RIVERDALE, AH HONEY HONEY...

**Napsandnetflix**: a classic, riverdale is s h o o k

**ImADudeDuh:** Riverdale fans are shook.

**Twat_brained**: The cover they did on Riverdale this year outshines the song at least 6 times

**Joshually**: How topical that the Archies’ innocence has been corrupted for 2017 in that dark & sexy show Riverdale

**Smoothbartowski**: i prefer cw riverdale's version imo but it's always good to recognize the original

If there were a single song to sum up the 80s, it has to be Bette Davis Eyes. This was actually first written in 1974, but it didn’t become a success until Kim Carnes recorded her version in 1981. [What’s with Kims only having one hit single?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHp7sq1Tzn0) I’m not sure who Bette Davis actually is but I’m willing to bet she’s an old white lady. 
 
-------------------------------------------------------
#I CAN SEE IT NOW

**vapourlomo**: The synth-guitar-whatever riff and the fake handclaps are so, so early-80s and I'm here for it. Also shoutout to Kim Carnes for being the female Rod Stewart, vocally speaking.

**Ispilledsomething**:  Pretty decent song but she sounds she has a sore throat.

**Dustinhaltom**: One of the coolest pop songs from the 80s, very underrated.

**letsallpoo**: I go back on forth on thinking this song is an amazing masterpiece and thinking it's absolutely terrible. Like everything about it makes me feel conflicted - 
Carnes' raspy voice, the synths, the weird-ass music video with the slapping, even the entire premise of the song. Today is one of the good days, I guess.

**dropthehammer11**: This song is so fucking good. That synth line is incredible. Even though this is great, the Chipmunks cover is even better.

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD:** she sounds like she has lung cancer but like a good kind of lung cancer

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:**  I can see alot of this song in Emotion, seems like one of the songs Carly took inspiration from. Really good synthpop song

**BlasifeelsSwift:**  I’m already sad bc this is probably going to leave way too soon. I don’t know why but there is something about this song that speaks to my soul. 
Maybe it’s her delivery, maybe the lyrics or maybe it’s the way the song manages to paint a timeless snapshot of a feeling idk. Also, this is kinda sad ngl: http://imgur.com/a/JUx4f

**OxfordSemicolon:** I really like the rough edges in Carnes's voice. I don't think I would in other songs, but it works here.

**noideawhatever**: not a fan of her voice, but the song is good

**-dolantello-**: love this song. that synthline is remarkably ahead of its time

**smoothbartowski:** probably one of my favorite songs of all time, the synths are just too good

**TheKneesOfOurBees:** Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**themonkey_**: Honestly just one of those cases where a song is so incredible literally anyone could have sang it and it would have been massive. This is a list full of gems but this gets the 11.
 
------------------------------------------------------------

#I CANNOT SEE

**Mrswearword**: one of the worst songs of the past 37 years

**twat_brained**: Dear God, the beat isn’t so bad but that riff is just so out of place. And can SOMEONE GET KIM A DAMN THROAT LOZENGE? The vocals are literally atrocious on this song! I can’t even IMAGINE a less-deserving Year-End #1.

**lassidoggy:** This is so corny and I feel like this would be a song that Gertrude gets turnt up to when it's Bingo Night on Wednesday.

**Look_A_Fangirl:** I don’t understand how this song got so big. I just don’t get it. What even are “Bette Davis Eyes”? Also there were so many better songs that should have been song of the year for 1981 cough cough Jessie’s Girl cough cough

**Pugglemaster**: not a fan of those raspy vocals

**TragicKingdom1**: I want to like this more but it's too...lowkey if that makes sense.

**Jelboo**: This is one of those songs that makes me think "I have to like this, because it's famous and popular" but I dunno really. It doesn't fulfill me like it could. The music is good, I just don't like the verses and chorus.

**Magic_warlock0-:** Dull and boring, bad lyrics, bad everything. Just no life to it.

**jess_22**: never really liked the song, the beat sounds so 80s

**Skyblade79**: SHE NEEDS TO CHILL WITH THE SMOKING. THe lyrics are so bad too

**themaus2**: dis terrible

**cedollete**: i would have liked this song a lot more if someone else was singing it, but i can noooot stand her voice.

And the nonproblematic white devil is gone! Not gonna lie, I actually bought this on itunes when it was popular. It’s bopness cannot be denied. If you’re a fan of producer-driven rap tracks, you could probably thank these guys for helping revamp the trend.^^^Kendrick ^^^was ^^^still ^^^robbed ^^^tho
 
---------------------------------------------------------------

#WALK INTO THE CLUB LIKE WADDUP I GOT A BIG….

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** Macklemore before he crossed the line from endearing to beyond corny, this song is still corny as hell but I can bop to it so I tolerate stuff like the R-Kelly line

**Skyblade79**: Such an iconic song. It really did define these years for me, and got me into rap [(don’t laugh)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztVMib1T4T4). It still works super well today and it’s just so impressive.
lassidoggy: Macklemore, queen of economizing and being wise with money. Queen of referencing R Kelly peeing on women in bed. Queen of walking into the club with Big Bird.

**dirdbub**: this is like one of the Three good Macklemore songs in all honesty

**calltehshots**: yeah this still goes off don't act like this isn't fire

**johnazoidberg-**: As much as we like to shit on Macklemore, this song is fucking fantastic. IF he'd stuck to stuff like this and Can't Hold Us, he'd be respected as an artist. Instead, he saw the praise he got for Same Love and said "I need to make sociopolitical statements, and that's more important than the music!" and he's a joke now

**eklxtreme**: it's weird how i first heard this on an alternative rock radio station. i remember the exact moment too and i always think back to it when i hear it; i was playing basketball by myself around 5pm in the fall after school while listening to iheartradio. despite all the common macklemore criticisms and grammy salt, i can't deny that this is a bop.

**ffourthofjuly**: one point off for the corniness but if you take away the fact that macklemore is now a living meme and the whole subject matter you have a wholesome song about literally picking up old thrifted clothes!!! its so great!!! and every line in the rap is so memorable because its so simplistic and corny, (thinkpiece idea: did macklemore kick off the whole hipster thrifting craze of recent years? discuss)

**vapourlomo**: Macklemore gets WAAAAAY too much hate. Oh, I'm sorry he's corny, would you prefer the supreme blandness of G-Eazy and Gnash? Maybe it's because I'm from the Puget Sound, so I grew up listening to Mack before he got big, but I'm always going to be hella defensive of the guy. "Thrift Shop" has a killer sax riff, clever lyrics with a legit message about consumerism, and a danceable beat. What more do you want from pop-rap? I'm still pissed all of you drove Mack away from the mainstream. Have fun with Machine Gun Kelly. Blech.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
#THAT'S JUST SOME IGNORANT BITCH SHIIIIIIIIIIIT…

**Elitefourbrad**:  This was a pretty good song when it came out, it’s just it hasn’t aged that well and it’s starting to come apart.

**superr_rad**: why

**veryunfinished**:  pros: the beat, the hook. cons: macklemore’s voice, inherent corniness, “this is fucking awesome”. what i'm saying is shoutout to ryan lewis

**Dustinhaltom:** I loved this song when it first came out, but it's pretty cringey to listen to now.

**mokitsu**: i can't believe this shit song was #1 in the year where katy perry and beyoncé released music.

**angusaditus**: I like the line about him having a big dick, that used to give me a tingle, but that's about all

**jess_22:** was this really 2013? It feels like my ears are just recovering from this atrocity

**borpo**: G A R B A G E 

**themaus2:** dis ugly

**ThatParanoidPenguin:**  I like Macklemore. The Heist is a legitimately good album. But this is not a good song. It certainly bops, which is why I gave it a 6. Ryan Lewis is a really talented producer, and it shows on here. But Macklemore really just doesn't do the beat justice. Listen to A Wake or White Walls instead.

Okay honestly, I would have never heard this song if it weren’t for Bridesmaids. The 90s was clearly the era of girl/boy bands, and I live for it. Fun fact: two of the members, the Wilsons, are the daughters of Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys! How embarrassing to have your offspring outpeak you..

------------------------------------------------------
 
#DON’T LET GO

**vapourlomo**: How much you want to bet nobody would remember this song if it wasn't for Bridesmaids? Good thing that movie gave Hold On a boost, because it's some quality cheese.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Inspirational high school VHS"-core. Chorus is iconic.

**mustangs16:** this song was the number one the year I was born, it gets extra points for that

**dropthehammer11**: This song is feel good as fuck. I feel brighter

**whatyourheartdesires:** oh this is the girlsband! I forgot about the song and their name and it's such a shame because it's good

**tevinterimperium:** some day somebody's gonna make you wanna gobble up a waffle fry

**Banananaise:** god bless bridesmaids for introducing me to this song

**Zamomattel:** Little Mix could never. Fifth Harmony could never.

**joshually:** THE TIGHTEST HARMONIES, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MELODY, THE MOST GORGEOUS INSTRUMENTAL ARRANGEMENT.

---------------------------------------------------------------
#NO GRIP

**Ispilledsomething:**  It’s okay, this was really the biggest song of the year?

**AbnormalPopPunk**: too inspirational, a five at best

**eklxtreme:**  i really appreciate their harmonies but the rest is kinda cheesy. i almost wanna compare it to a slower and less fun HAIM, even though HAIM were probably inspired by wilson phillips

**Look_A_Fangirl**: Part of me dreads this song to death. And I know better songs called Hold On, hell, one literally saved my life.

**camerinian:** Was this the first self-esteem anthem? Cos if so … that’s a shame

**Albert_Cole:** Literally just a list of platitudes all in a row

**Veryunfinished**: this is such a lackluster motivationa song. It’s like Fight Song but worse

**Skyblade79**: is this literally fight song from a few decades ago?

#JUSTICEFORPHILCOLLINS

**PandoraKris**: By formula, Hold On is gotta be the best pop song ever because it's an empowering song by a girl group which consists of daughters from iconic pop groups (The Beach Boys, The Mamas & The Papas) with production that has both 80s & 90s sound in it... Except it's the direct opposite. It's so white, dated, bland and cheesy af, even a slice bread with tofu has 99.99% more flavour than this song. I refuse to have this to define my 90s. Oh wait, I mean, I refuse to acknowledge that this song exist at all. #JusticeForPhilCollins #AnotherDayInParadiseIsGOAT

----------------------------------------------------------------
 
#YOU’VE NEVER LOOKED BETTER

**TragicKingdom1**: The midtempo is kind of weird but it works as a more hopeful counterpart to Candle In The Wind.

**MrSwearword**: moving as hell

**twat_brained:** A legendary song to honor a legendary woman.

**eklxtreme**:  something about the way elton writes his tunes... what a legend

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: This is a very 'prom' song, it's kind of cheesy but also endearing, I love how randomly huge Elton John was in the late 90s

**camerinian:** Having this jammed in between the Macarena and Too Close on the Spotify playlist is a fucking mood whiplash sandwich

**stansymash**: elton john is so precious

**jess_22**: not as good as Candle in the Wind, but there's something relaxing about this

**joshually:** I recite these lyrics to my hookups when I’m trying to seduce them.

**Elitefourbrad**: Another great bop from Elton that screams 90’s ballad in the best way possible.
 
---------------------------------------------------------

#CAN YOU PUT ON SOME MAKEUP?

**mokitsu**: big snoozer

**ffourthofjuly**: why is it the worst elton john songs that make this list, where’s “i guess thats why they call it the blues” or “goodbye yellow brick road” or fuckin “tiny dancer” god damn gen pop really screwing over elton john one step at a time

**Look_A_Fangirl**: Y’all know Candle In The Wind was better of the double single.

**Ispilledsomething:** Love you Elton, but nah

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: I like really feel bad about giving Elton John a 6, but honestly, I've never really liked this song. I know it's a classic and all, but I've never really gotten the hype for this.

**lassidoggy**: It's a nice song, but it just carries on for too long.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**:  meh. John has stuff that is 1000 times better.

**Therokinrolla**: i love his voice. If only this song was better

THE end all be all of club anthems is out! 14 years later and this shit still pop the fuck off, truly a timeless bop. Popheads might agree that having sex is better than making love, but its not like we gettin either, so…

[It’s not Weird Al, but here’s a great parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSbPrd-5ujA)

------------------------------------------------------
 
#GO SHAWTY, IT’S YOUR BIRTHDAY

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: Iconic beat, iconic hook, catchy as FUCK, this still goes off like 13 years later

**lassidoggy**: Everyone and their mothers knows the iconic chorus.

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: This hook will never leave my memory.

**ffourthofjuly**: for a song that literally everyone knows its weird that this bangs as much as it does. its also weird that everyone knows this song because then you get six year old me rapping every word by heart of a song with lyrics like “im into having sex i aint into making love" listening off my ipod nano ah memories

**clipeuh**: 50 cent's peak. he wasn't the most talented lyricist but boy did he have the attidude and ambition.

**wearingsox**: such a wonderfully dirty bop with many iconic lines.

**enecks**: OK this is a guilty pleasure. This beat is incredible, but 50 cent drags it hard. Crazy In Love is better.

**HopelesslyEmoted:** Still a jam and always pumped to hear this on a party playlist. Kind of an automatic

**patronsaintofaspies**: love the production on this one!

**justdancegottabeok:**  Dr.Dre serving another timeless beat. My lord, he will never lose it will he? I wasn't planning on giving this a 10, but this production just keeps me shook all the time.

**Ispilledsomething:** The mumbled mouth 50 Cent never sounded better than here. While I hated this song in my grade school "all rap is crap" phase, its now my go to gym song.

**chanelephant:** the bop for birthdays for centuries to come

**dropthehammer11:** This shit is a fucking ANTHEM

**whatyourheartdesires**: This brings so many memories. I love the beat, I couldn't care less for the rapping lol

**-dolantello-:** super infectious song. i think it was probably the first hip hop song i remember hearing. one of Dre's best beats ever too
 
----------------------------------------------------------------

#15 CENT

**joshually**: Whatever happened to 50 cent???

**camerinian**: We don’t need 50 Cent. We never needed 50 Cent. Give Snoop Dogg this song what changes.

**Magic_warlock0-:** 50 has made more iconic songs than this. It's a decent rap, but compared to his other works, it's not quite as memorable.

**calltehshots**:  this song only holds up because the beat goes hard and ~nostalgia~ but 50 sucks on this

**Skyblade79**:  I hate this song so much! The lyrics are just so sleazy and it’s just not catchy.

**themonkey:** It's a bad song but its also iconic.

**BlasifeelsSwift**: is this the beginning of the dark side of the 2000s?

**vapourlomo**: Why was 50 Cent so big when Jay Z was still at his peak and was 80 times better? At least "In Da Club" has a Dre beat.

**mokitsu**: you're telling me this isn't called [birthday?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqYxyd1iSNk)


**NapsAndNetflix:** when this is played at the ratchet clubs I go to I leave the dfloor and go get a drink tbh

**TragicKingdom1:** I'm not used to the explicit version of the song so the chorus sounds weird to me :(. Although I don't like this song, I do think it deserves credit for making rap the dominant genre on the chart until 2009 or so.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#HEH, MONEY JOKES:

**OxfordSemicolon**:  If this had been before How You Remind Me we would have given the charts 50¢ and gotten a Nickelback.

[Bitch what the fuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlxbQ7LVBuU). Yall really let this get this far? I mean the oh ayyy oo is catchy and all, but I cannot believe this was the most successful song of 1987. Also, if you’re wondering if this is racially insensitive, [I found a forum of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans having an …intelligent discussion about it.](http://forums.thetechnodrome.com/showthread.php?t=56564)
----------------------------------------------------------------
 
#LET’S WALK TO CAIRO

**vapourlomo**:  Is this racially insensitive? No clue. Still, it's prime, goofy 80s pop with a killer surf-rock beat, and you can't beat that.

**MrSwearword:** cute 80s cheese done right

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: The 80s was probably the invention of memes tbh. Memes aside, though, this song slaps. It's got a really weird industrial instrumental and a bunch of iconic moments.

**dropthehammer11**: For some reason I thought this song was bad but it's damn catchy

**Albert_Cole:** This is rather a stupid song. Still gets me on the dancefloor every time (or it would, if I ever went near a dancefloor)

**Jelboo**: Fantastic song but it lacks a chorus. Why are the verses so cool and is the 'chorus' so dull? Still, really, really good.

**Magic_warlock0-**: An upbeat and fuckin' fun ass song to jam to. The lyrics encourage the love of rock and excitement!(though the cultural aspects of a song like this...)

**calltehshots**:  love this cultural appropriation bop.

**BlasifeelsSwift:**  iconic, Cleopatra could never, Nefertiti wishes she could, Tutankamon who?

**wearingsox**: The melody of the verses is so fun. This song is better than I remember it, the premise is a little corny but it’s better in the context of a silly rock song

**TheKneesOfOurBee**s: Macarena who? this is the definitve dance craze song.

**nerfherder01:** I adore this. Makes me want to be in an all-girl rock band singing wacky-but-adorable tunes

**timothy444:** Classic childhood memories from this song. :)

**justgottadancebeok**: The production is interesting, but it's not like I would turn the volume higher when this comes on the radio.

**Dustinhaltom**: I don't think Egyptians actually walk like that, but I guess "Walk Like A Hieroglyph" isn't as catchy.

**jess_22:** there's something that i don't like about this song but i can't put my finger on it

**letsallpoo**: Too supremely stupid for me to enjoy. It's like if "What Did the Fox Say?" became the most successful song of the year

**Tragickingdom1**: I don't see how this was such a big hit other than mild novelty factor.

**tevinterimperium**: egpytians didn't even walk like that tf

**superr_rad:**  i live for any female dominated song but what does walk like an egyptian mean??? is it problematic??? and that dance is very suburban white mom

**Elitefourbrad**: A generic 80’s track, I don’t really have anything good to say about it.

**kioescport**: I still don’t get it.

**Swaqqalicious:** This song brings back bad memories. Always hated it, still do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#SAY EGYPTIAN ONE MORE TIME 

**therokinrolla**: this is a bop no more explanation needed more like bop like an egyptian am i right you know im right bc my ass is shaking like an egyptian and im dancing like an egyptian whille climaxing like an egyptian bc mmmmm this song some good shit like an egyptian like this song is a better invention than those silly pyramids this is the best gift from ever bc it bops like an e-fucking-gyptian and that doesnt stand for electronic gyptian

Fun fact about this song: you can see Sharona Alperin's nipple on the single cover.

#YOU MAKE MY MOTOR RUN

**kioescport**: I have no idea why this was so big but I'll take it.

**Swaqqalicious**: The drums and bass in this are supreme. I almost forgot it existed, but this was my song like 10 years ago.

**camerinian**: This isn’t gonna win, I know that, but hell this song is part of my musical soul, one of the first songs before my era that I was exposed to and I fell in love. The hook is infectious, the energy is unstoppable, the solos kill and it doesn’t outstay its welcome. This song is a classic, easily the best track out of our picks from the 70’s and no one will ever tell me otherwise

**Albert_Cole:** This is about a 17-year-old and contains the line "I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind". Still less creepy than Tonight's The Night.

**ffourthofjuly**: i always forget how good this song is until i listen to it again; i love how the chorus kicks in with the unrelenting riff and it just keeps building again and again until the guitar solo at the end. i think this is overall a perfect rock song through and through, and honestly upon relistening this for the millionth time to rate it, i can’t find many, or any, flaws with it. which is weird for a throwaway 1 hit wonder song on the cusp of the 80s.

**Magic_warlock0-**: Fuckin' yes, this is what rock embodies to me: excellent guitar riffs and badass lyrics!

**Zamomattel:** Live for this song, even though it wouldn't usually be my type

**johnazoidberg-**: I could write a long comment about how infectious this song is and the traditions we had based around it in high school drama, but more important than all of that is that this was the first song Weird Al ever released a parody of - this song invented God and it would be blasphemous to give it any less than a 10

**skiddos:** wow i'm jamming. this is where the rate really starts to get interesting.

**themonkey_**: Such a classic! Iconic Dad rock!

**smoothbartowsk**i: invented the term B O P

**vapourlomo:** This is the blueprint for power pop perfection. I adore The Cars, but they never wrote a song this mindlessly perfect. Just maybe don't listen to the lyrics too closely.

**enecks:** Iconic cheesy legend. It is THE song to do air guitar to. It’s the straightest thing since consensual hand-holding missionary sex with the lights off, and I still love it. This and YMCA are both classics deserving of #1.

**patronsaintofaspies**: The fact that this song is about an underage girly is really shifty, even if this was the 70s, but the guitar solo is GOAT.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#DIE SHARONA

**HopelesslyEmoted**: Definitely can hear the transitioning sound of popular rock here. It is an iconic song, just not really into it. If this song came out today the lyrical content would raise a lot of eyebrows. Kind of funny to think about considering the explicit nature of many popular songs

**BlasifeelsSwift**: sharona is a weird name, who the fuck names their daughter sharona

**hoolytoledo**: It's just overly repetitive, no matter how iconic this song was.

**mokitsu:** ???

**NapsAndNetflix:** no thanks

**TragicKingdom1:** Instrumentation is good but I really hate his vocal inflections

**eklxtreme**: i never understood why this song got so massively popular. it's extremely generic and almost feels like a copy of a rock song but it's alright and sorta catchy i guess?

**granitenotebook**:  the ending is GOAT but the rest goes on way too long

**cloudbustingmp3:** this song is fun for the first 30 seconds and then dives right into annoying

**Skyblade79:** Just like the Rod Stewart song, this sounds like it was written by a creeper. My mom likes it but this was one of those songs I could never listen to with her.

**joshually**: This song has been ruined by drunk white old ladies at karaoke forever.

**misstututulle**: Catchy but supremely annoying.

**Elitefourbrad**: I never liked listening to this song when my grandpa would have it on, the beat is catchy but eh I’m not feeling it.

The second part of 1997s double single is out. a tear-jerking tribute to two female women icons, [Marilyn](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e2/6e/c4/e26ec4ad6eae4a87adb0a2331cb0962f.jpg) and [Princess Diana](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CusL-eUWEAAEolG.jpg)


This song was originally written in 1973 to honor the memory of Marilyn Monroe, but that was long forgotten after he re-wrote the song in 1997 after the passing of Princess Diana. But...we have teenage girls on Facebook to keep Monroe's memory alive, anyway. Fun fact about this song: it's the second best selling single of ALL TIME behind Bing Cosby's White Christmas - when will your fave ever?? Also, RIP Lil Sebastian. - leaf


----------------------------------------------------- 

#OH MY FUCKIN GOD SHE FUCKIN DEAD

**twat_brained**: You will never fall apart, Diana, you're still in our hearts🕯💜

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: RIP Diana :(

**Chanelelphant**:  eh song but extra points cause RIP Princess Di

**Elitefourbrad**: A tribute to the late Princess Diana, Elton gives us his most memorable song and my personal favorite from him. This was the better of the double single for 1997.

**Blasifeelsswift**:  rip Diana, long gone but not forgotten. I actually wanna take this moment to remind everybody how important Lady Di was and still is. She was the first royal anyone could remember who behaved like a normal person, Charles still acts like a robot for example (fuck you Camila btw, also thank god Charles will never be king). Keep in mind that back then the royal family in the UK had a really bad image, they were seen as people that dedicated their life to shooting birds and just being there. There was a huge disconnect. Diana was literally a girl who was like everybody else, she went clubbing, was friends with Elton John and even though she tended to her duties she still had that girl next door image. Plus, she dared to divorce the prince. SHE DARED. She also used her status to help a lot of people. Remember when she was seen interacting with people suffering from aids, that was huge. I will always remember this quote by her: HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it. What's more, you can share their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys This was at a time where it wasn’t known how the diseased was transmitted. Also she got into a really huge fight with the Queen about this, scolding her (the Queen) for not supporting this type of charity. She wasn’t perfect don’t get me wrong, but she tried her best and one of the biggest injustices of this world was that her two beautiful children had to grow up without her. Harry carries her mantle to this day and her death really affected him. She was and still is really popular: in 1999 two years after her death Time named her one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, in 2002 she was ranked third on the BBC’s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons, outranking the Queen. A huge loss and a person that will always be remember. To this day she still continues to influence the way the Royal Family acts.

[#BURN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ZNK0Tewqs)

**ffourthofjuly**:  i appreciate the message and vision i even stan elton john with every fiber of my being but id be lying if this wasn’t one of my least favorite elton john songs of all time i just think its corny and simple, rest in peace princess diana but elton john could’ve made a better song

**Jelboo**: Awww Lady Diana. Did you know she and MJ would chat on the phone very often late at night/early in the morning? They were buddies and he was distraught over her death, still talking about it in music many years later. The song itself... I love cheese but this is a bit too sentimental even for me.

**Vapourlomo:**  Is this rating supposed to be for the Princess Diana-specific version? Anyways, it's an okay Elton song, but not one of my favorites, and honestly I don't feel as sad about Diana as I probably should...maybe it's because I was only three years old when it happened?

**Albert_Cole**: This is just not that impactful for me, sadly, as someone who was born after Diana died, because the lyrics are so specific to her. There's still plenty about it to appreciate though - including the fact that it's produced by the great George Martin.

#PARKS AND REKT

**NapsAndNetflix**:  the only thing sadder than this would be 5,000 candles in the wind rip li'l sebastian

**veryunfinished**: insert lil sebastian joke here

**eribertknows**: RIP Li'l Sebastian <3

**jess_22**:  BYE BYE LIL SEBASTIAN

**AbnormalPopPunk**: if this was "5000 candles in the wind" from parks and rec itd get my 11 tbh

**sjoors**: This is ok, but I prefer 5000 Candles in The Wind

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** Pretty sad and solid ballad for Princess Diana, but I'm trying really hard not to make Parks and Rec jokes cause 5000 Candles in the Wind goes off

QUEEN OF EXERCISE, ARIANA WHO? WHO BICYCLE? 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

#DO YOU EVEN LIFT, BRO?

**nerfherder01**: strong contender for an 11, one of the best examples of 80s production and it’s so fun! (And they all turn gay at the end of the video wtf is this :D)

**misstututulle**: A timeless bop, with an amazing YouTube thumbnail.

**superr_rad**: anyone that rates this less than a 8 needs to be b&

**Elitefourbrad**: Olivia Newton-John is the queen of making you go to the gym and having guys in the music video leave in couples for the locker room for some after workout fun ;)

**ImADudeDuh**: iconic video tbh

**awryj**: The vibrating butt at the beginning of the music video turned me gay

**angusaditus**: a ho anthem for the ages, perfection

**enecks**: This chorus is iconic and catchy and the verses are kinda weird “suggestive movies?” and the sax is cool IDK how I feel about this which is weird considering that it is a song I’ve heard so much. A lot of good alternatives for #1 (Eye of the Tiger, Tainted Love, Chariots of Fire), but yeah this is good.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I've never listened to this song until now. The YouTube thumbnail scared me. That's the only bad thing about it, though.

**mokitsu**: TIMELESS BOP. Sexy, raunchious. Something Katy Perry would release. LOVE IT

**justdancegottabeok**: That chorus is unstoppable.

**ffourthofjuly**: this is one of the lamest songs ive ever heard but because of the campy-ness of it it gets bumped up a couple points. i love it but ironically!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

#FELETE IT DAT

**therokinrolla**: its good and has a nice hook but something feels so cheap about it

**atlastata**: Olivia Newton-John cannot sing.

**gannade**: its ok not really that great sorry poo

**twat_brained**: I never understood the hype for this song. It’s a good tune but I feel the video just undoes the hell out of it; it objectifies and fat-shames men and I’m not here for it. I hope Olivia can get over her breast cancer again, though. r/popheads wishes you well and hopes you can recover!

**dirdbub**: an iconic chorus, but nothing much else to it.

**vapourlomo**: Surprisingly boring and lifeless for a song that's had a decently long shelf-life. I guess it's...not the one that I want (cue sunglasses and CSI theme).

**Ispilledsomething**: Embarrassing but still kinda fun to sing along to

**TragicKingdom1**: Really basic, not even particularly fun or catchy.

**MrSwearword**: 80s cheese but done terribly

-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#NOT ONLY IS THIS RATE FUN, IT’S ALSO EDUCATIONAL!

**borpo**: Full disclosure, I always thought Olivia Newton-John was somehow related to Elton John, so I learned something new today. One of those things you believe as a kid and it sticks in your brain.

[Most of this song is pretty zzz](https://media.giphy.com/media/26tjZmRqyPj9jUd56/giphy.gif) but talk about a crescendo. This is the title track to Simon & Garfunkel’s final album and their most successful single, critically and commercially. I’m surprised it got this far but two men on a ballad together was probably the gayest thing to happen in pop music at the time, of course popheads would like it. 


-------------------------------------------------------------
#SMOOTH SAILING
 
**cedollete**: this isn't really my type of music but maaan, the guy whose singing has a BEAUTIUFL voice.

**Nerdy_boy_chris:** This is one of the most calming songs I've ever heard.

**Bananannaise**: i don't even need to listen to this one again, it's getting a ten.

**Vapourlomo**: Not a lot of songs make me cry. This is one of those few. I'd give up a kidney to see Simon and Garfunkel perform this live again.

**ffourthofjuly:** i can't listen to this song without crying, theres just something about it that hits you in the soul. maybe its just a running theme with simon and garfunkel songs but no other band knows how to tug on my heartstrings the way they do. this song just puts me at ease, so much so that i start to become caught up in a sea of emotion.

**clipeuh**: its a bit cheesy but still the kinda song everyone knows. paul simon is so great in this one.

**Jelboo:** Many of these songs aren't necessarily the best of these artists' discography (for these two I think of Mrs. Robinson, The Boxer, If I Could, ...) but once again, this is such a gorgeous soundscape. A little bit too tame, perhaps.

**PandoraKris:** ngl I don't like it at first, but it had been grown on me and man, it sounds sincerely I guess it must be hard for them to sing this. :(

**Zamomattel:** Moving, amazing, I live. Not higher just because I can't really imagine listening to this on my own accord

**Wearingsox:** This is the first time I’ve heard this, the keys are beautiful.

**TheKneesOfOurBees:** if this goes out on the first day i am doxxing all of the people on the sub

**Agentofscranton:** this is one of those songs that never fail in making me tear up when I hear it
______________________________________________________ 

#THE WATERS ARE ROUGH
 
**Albert_Cole:** Everyone seems to say this is a shoo-in for #1, but I don't hear it. It does build majestically, but I don't think the last chorus is grand enough to justify the hype

**timothy444:**  A bit too boring for me. What are you? Adele's inspiration for making me fall to sleep? 
Mokitsu:  SNOOZER. They were really depressed in 1970 huh

**Look_A_Fangirl**: This turned into accidental background music. Whoops. Guess it bored me.

**Magic_warlock0-:** Eh, never was able to gel to this song, it's so sleep-inducing!

**Skyblade79**: My dad sang this to my mom once. It was a super cute moment, though the song itself isn’t for me.

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: i know this is supposed to be beautiful or some shit but i literally want to fall asleep

**Superr_rad:** sorry this song has always been too boring for me

-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**YOU SAY “TOMATO”, I SAY “TOMATO**

**OxfordSemicolon:** I have nothing to say about the song, but when I looked up the lyrics to this one site credited Paul Simon as Simon Paul.

Our last song out today is The Sign! If you can listen to this song without thinking of that puke scene in pitch perfect, I envy you. 
Nevertheless, this is a wonderful pop song. Those Swedes know how to make a catchy tune.
-------------------------------------------------------------
#I JUST SAW THE SIGN, GIRL

**johnazoidberg-**: Can we bring back European dance pop? Please?

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: Song honestly slaps, I still listen to this every once in a while, fuck anyone who gives this lower than a 7, I sing this bitch on road trips every day this is a top 25 chorus all time fuck off.
twat_brained: You: "The Sign" by Ace of Base. Me, an intellectual: America, say hello to your new pop music overlord, Max Martin!

**RandomDKguy:** "AN. ABSOLUTE. BOP"

**cloudbustingmp3**:  i'm so happy my birth year had such a gr8 year-end #1. hopefully i can slay as much as this song does.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** With so many ballads in this rate, I really appreciated a great bop like this

**lassidoggy:**  This song will forever be ruined by Pitch Perfect, but this goes the fuck off.

**misstututulle**: Europop wins.

**HopelesslyEmoted**: Fully full on 90s.

**MrSwearword:**  screw you all, I love this tacky number
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

#ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

**chanelephant:** vomit inducing

**whatyourheartdesires:** Ace of Base is the synonym of cheap for me

**Banananaise**:  this song is pretty unexceptional except for the fact it is a BANGER at karaoke

**eribertknows**: How did we go from Whitney to this? And why does one of them look so angry in the video?

**Jelboo**: Oh and here's the 90's. Definitely not their best song, it's all a bit... vain? Empty-headed? Don't know how to express it.

**Elitefourbrad**:  The studio version is worse than the version that Stephanie’s band played on Full House.

**vapourlomo**:  It's ABBA, but slightly worse! Honestly, 1994 was a great year for music, but I'd like to think my birthyear would be better represented by Smashing Pumpkins, Nas, or Blur.

**patronsaintofaspies**:  the production is really nice but i hate the voices lmao
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#ONE HIT WONDER? ALL THAT SHE WANTS, DON’T TURN AROUND, BEAUTIFUL LIFE AND CRUEL SUMMER WOULD LIKE A WORD WITH YOU….

**eklxtreme**:  one of the many amazing one-hit wonders of the 90s with incredible choruses. the subtle reggae influence kinda works and makes it feel very "sunny." it doesn't get much better than this tbh.

mustangs16: there's one song left I gave a 1, but gave it my 0 in another rate and only didn't this time because Happy was an option.

dropthehammer11: Besides my 0, lowest score I gave was a 3.5, I'm usually pretty nice with my rates

btw since we have the same 11 I tagged you as "good ass taste"

mustangs16: I had two ones besides my 0 but other than that, yeah, I think everything got at least a 3 or a 4 from me. I'm only mean when I truly hate a song/album haha

mustangs16: I think it'll be one of the 80s songs that win. Maybe We Belong Together. I know Uptown Funk got multiple 0s.

Albert_Cole: Reminder: [Tik Tok made it to #6 in the last rate it was in](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5772nl/rate_results_teenage_dream_vs_the_fame_monster_vs/d8pqotj/)

Let's see if it can go higher this time, except not really, because it didn't age well, most of the songs on Animal are way better and Dr Luke probably makes money every time you play this song

lunasaflowers: JUSTICE FOR PHYSICAL YOU HEATHENS

(Irrelevant side note, but for the record, I would take twenty more Macklemores over any more Gnashs or Machine Gun Kellys. Corny is infinitely better than dull and unmemorable.)

EDIT: also i'm out here rooting for careless whisper or gangsta's paradise to take home the crown god bless
