The first bop to drop is Boom Boom Clap de Boom de Clap de Clap. It seems that yall either love this or hate this, but most of us hate it. This and I Gotta Feeling hoarded #1 on the 100 for *half of a fucking year*. ~~They’ve probably been on hiatus for almost 7 years because they were sick of themselves too.~~
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
#SO 3008

**eribertknows:** I'm so 3008 you're so 2000 and late. Fun fact: I learned some English listening to this song. Also, GOAT video.

**vapourlomo**: I love the Black Eyed Peas. Sorry, I won't apologize for loving goofy, ridiculous pop-rap like this. The beat kind of bangs, you can't lie. That 3008 line? So-dumb-it's-perfect.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:**  This song is Dance (A$$) levels of being so stupid that it's actually genius and incredible, it's like a crazy trainwreck and I love it.

**dirdbub**: okay this is the most post-ironic 10 of the rate for me. I was Here for the Black Eyed Peas domination of 2009 then and I’m still here for it Now this shit is poppin and I will be Here for it for a LONG time

**NapsAndNetflix:** easily their best song @ me

**MrSwearword:** Yeah I gave this a high score. Eat me, haters.

**joshually:** OK I don’t hate this song, but I’m surprised I Gotta Feeling wasn’t #1!?!??!

**Skyblade79**:  Now this is mostly a nostalgia rating. I remember singing this with my sister when we were like 8… we still have recording of us singing it on one of our computers. It’s just such a fun song and it’s actually pleasant to listen to.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#SO 2000-AND-LATE

**Elitefourbrad:** The Black Eyed Peas phenomenon made me quit listening to the radio for quite some time, this is easily their worst track too.

**Look_A_Fangirl:** D A T E D

**enecks**:  This is so awful. The autotune. The incessant noise in the background. That garbage flow. This is the 2nd worst #1. How did this beat the debut of LADY GAGA who for a couple of years saved pop.

**Dustinhaltom**: Just a reminder that this and "I Gotta Feeling" were number one for 26 straight agonizing weeks.

**patronsaintofaspies**: honestly i'm not trying to sound lwg here but if a recording of this song still exists in 3008 its going to become a meme

**calltehshots**: a 3 for 3008

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**:  something something "this song is 2000 and late now!!!!! Xd"

**timothy444:** ironically they were the ones who were 2000 and late

**gannade**: this song is so 2000 and LATE

**johnazoidberg-**: This is the most annoying song ever written and I'm still waiting for Will I Am to issue a formal apology for his entire career. The Black Eyed Peas were a mistake. This song is so 2000 and I wish I was deaf.

**ThatParanoidPenguin:** The Black Eyed Peas' 2000s reign produced a few mediocre songs and a few horrid ones. This is a horrid one. In retrospect, I have no idea how this was as popular as it was, because it sucks. The beat is admittedly nice, but oh my god, the chorus sucks, and the lyrics... this song is so 2000 and late.

**whatyourheartdesires**:  it reminds of me of the funny ideas people had in the 60s for what the future world will look like. The BEP are so 2000 and late.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

#AND NOW FFOURTHOFJULY PUTS MORE EFFORT INTO HER COMMENT THAN BEP DID FOR THE SONG

**ffourthofjuly**: when i was listening to this song for this rate, i pondered what score to give it. i have heard this song countless times before, i know that it infiltrated pretty much every facet of my life at its peak. and yet, i was dumbfounded. i didn’t know if this was literally the best song to ever be created or the worst of the worst. in fact i still don’t know, every element says this song should be total shit and yet, i feel like its so shit it transcends the next plane of existence? everything from the terrible autotune to the simplistic backing 808s to the mindless catchy hook to the fucking line “im so 3008 / you’re so 2000 and late” tells me this song is absolutely awful, and it is, but it all comes together to be so………bad its good. its like a train wreck you can’t look away from or in this case the black eyed peas song you can’t stop listening to it

Ok, talk about recency bias. Was this song played every 5 minutes on the radio for an entire year? Yes. Is it incredibly annoying after the 5th listen? Yes. But is it a bad song? Some of you think so...passionately. [Here’s a Weird Al if you can handle it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq7Eki5EZ8o).



-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#IF YOU’RE HAPPY AND YOU KNOW IT CLAP YOUR HANDS

**superr_rad:** this is gonna be rated low bc recency bias and overplayed, but its still a solid song esp if you managed to avoid it

**joshually**: This song was inescapable that year, but a few years later, I find merit in its. It’s a fun catchy joyful precious song and that choir in the end is so random but give me a good choir in a song and I’ll subscribe

**Albert_Cole**: People seem to be giving this their 0s, and I don't get why. What would you rather have as year end #1 for 2014? Fancy? Rude? All Of Me? This song has almost recovered from the intense overplay, and it's really not that bad.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: This is such a mom song, but I'll take dancy happy Pharrell any day

**twat_brained**: This song can get inane and basic at times, especially when you've heard it at least 200 times like I have. Still bops tho👌

**TragicKingdom1**: This song makes me happy, what can I say?

**MrSwearword**: Even I don’t hate this. I quite love it.

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: This song makes me #Happy and it deserves love and support.

**lassidoggy:** I like this song, I do. It makes me happy.

**eklxtreme:** i've always loved this song so much because of the smooth catchy vibes. this is so cliche but i was having so much general anxiety in early 2014 and i would always listen to this song (and some san cisco songs) to try and make myself feel better. i simply can't give this a bad score.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 
#HAPPINESS IS UNATTAINABLE

**patronsaintofaspies:** some men just want to watch the world burn

**vapourlomo:** God I hate this song. It might be overplay talking, but this is easily the worst thing Pharrell has ever created.

**angusaditus**: having this song + Minions being everywhere truly was the darkest timeline

**Elitefourbrad**:  I just really hated this song a lot because of the repetitive lyrics and it’s just horrible.

**mustangs16**: POSSIBLY THE WORST SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD

**BlasifeelsSwift**: fuck you Pharrell and fuck you minions, I could go on and write all about how the minion’s movie plot is a perfect example of capitalism but I won’t

**awryj:** this song makes me angry

**Therokinrolla**: kill it

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: this song makes me actually want to blow the roof off my room and die

**ForretressArtillery**: Good song, gets too much crap for its overplay IMO... but it drags on after a while.

**Look_A_Fangirl:** Oh hell no.

**Pugglemaster**: kill me

---------------------------------------------

The first meme song is out! [I found footage of /u/leafsnatch when he was a kid doing the dance!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lVNXslJ52Y) Fun fact: until Despacito, this is was the only song with mostly Spanish to top the Hot 100. [Los Del Rio](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Lo6WIiDcrw/hqdefault.jpg), when you dance, they may call you Macarena, but popheads say que soy mala. Sashay away.
__________________________________________
 
#(SOMETHING THAT MEANS “I LIKE IT” IN SPANISH)

**awryj:** No matter whether you were born in 1970 or 2000, you know the Macarena. My ass is having a life of its own right now.

**berober04**: Invented school dances.

**Albert_Cole**:  I was about to give this a 10 until I remembered how little I like the verses in this version. Los Del Rio themselves are great, and the production is fantastic. Still the only dance I can actually do, as well.

**themonkey**: a song I'm supposed to hate but fuck after a few drinks this becomes the best shit in the world.

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: Despacito is shaking.

**calltehshots:**  fuck it this shit is a bop WHEN I DANCE THEY CALL ME MACARENA AND THEY BOYS SAY QUE SOY BUENA also "now come on, what was i suppose to do, he was out of town and his two friends were so fine" are words to live by.

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy:**  FOR DA MEMES!!!! And also it's still a bop.

**BlasifeelsSwift:** I debated for a long time whether to give this my 11 bc spain duh but at the same time the original version should be the one to get the 11 not this shitty remix. Let us take this moment to remember this video exists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8yqWU0UzeY

#(SOMETHING THAT MEANS “I DON’T LIKE IT” IN SPANISH)

**borpo:** I can’t deal with this song anymore

**timothy444:**  Annoying and repetitive. Can we just forget that this happened already? At least with Gangnam Style, it was funny and enjoyable. K-pop luv

**NapsAndNetflix:** this is the '96 gangnam style and there's no way it should have been the #1 for the year


#DISSERTATIONS


**dirdbub:** this song is so bad that I gave up on learning Spanish just so I wouldn't understand it. this song is so bad I just went into post-partum depression after listening to it just from the fact that someone decided to give birth to this monstrocity. this song is so bad that I booked a plane ticket, flew out to California, and told my uncle studying cancer to stop his research and instead focus in on whoever made this song because they very clearly have an advanced form of cancer that needs to be studied. this song is so bad that I decided to never get married just so I never have to hear this song at my own wedding. this song is so bad that I tell my shotgun-crazy, homophobic cousins that I’m gay whenever this song comes up at weddings just in the hopes that they shoot me and that I don’t have to deal with the song anymore. this song is so bad that I intentionally made myself dissociate before this song even got played so I wouldn’t remember listening to it. this song is so bad that I want to become a famous Dutch post-impressionist painter that was never appreciated in his lifetime, depressed as all hell, an alcoholic, and eats paint thinner in hopes that it puts him out of this world and who is probably a bisexual due to evidence that he has hooked up with male and female prostitutes, who only started painting six years before his death, who painted over fourty self-portraits of himself in those six years, and who shot himself in the chest with a 7mm Lefaucheux à broche revolver just so I can cut off my ear after hearing this song. this song is so bad that I would rather have the government drill into my ea just so I wouldn’t have to hear this again. this song is so bad that I spent the better part of 15 minutes of my life writing up all these comments one after another with no break just to exemplify how much I hate this song. I fucking hate this song don’t @ me

**ThatParanoidPenguin:** I have never given a song a 0 before. To give you perspective, my lowest score for a song before was a 4. Almost all of the songs I rate are a 7 or higher. I thought it would never have happened. Then this rate happened, and I saw that Macarena was on it. I know some people are gonna give this a 10, and to those people: I highly recommend you visit an ENT and make sure you have ears. This song would be the worst stain in the history of wedding music of Crazy Frog didn't exist - it's a repetitive mess with some of the worst vocals I've ever heard in my life - and my father makes me listen to 90s freestyle, a genre formed when D-list pop singers were sad they couldn't be on the radio and whined so much they made their own genre of shitty house music. The vocals on this are so bad I'm legitimately convinced I could record better singing, and I have a voice so monotone I make Penguinz0 sound like Prince. The beat is offensive. It angers me that someone made this. Fuck you, person who made this. The only redeeming factor of this song is the chorus, which is admittedly fun, but it doesn't save this song from a 0. If it didn't have the chorus, this song would be a -3. I would've submitted it as a -3, too (sorry leaf). This song is so fucking bad I've sworn myself to a life of celibacy so I don't have to hear this. This song is so fucking bad I'm inclined to go to record stores to buy this record just to break it in half so people don't have to experience this mess. This song is so fucking bad that whenever I hear it on the radio I swerve my car off a bridge and jump out just so I don't have to hear it. This song is so fucking bad that if I was forced to listen to a minute of this or never being able to hear again, you can catch me throwing up ASL like gang signs. Fuck this middle school dance-ass piece of shit fucking excuse for a musical composition, in the name of the fucking father, the fucking son, and the motherfucking Holy Spirit, a-fucking-MEN.

#WE ONLY HAVE TONIGHT

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** That sax solo shook me

**clipeuh**: it's alright. kinda sounds like something Ed Sheeran would sing these days.

**Jelboo:** I definitely like this! Has, in a way, a very Disney-esque sound, you can imagine this in a romance montage somewhere.

**Magic_warlock0-**:  Stewart's gritty voice combined with solid ass instruments make for a wonderful slow song. That saxphone, YAS!

**joshually**: I LOVE that a sex song was the #1 song of 1977. Y’all was some nasty azz hoez back in the day!!!

**Elitefourbrad:**  A great bop about sex. I mean there’s not much more to say, sex is good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin:**  I'm really trying to keep an open mind on this one - Rod Stewart is the opposite of what I usually listen to, but I'm really digging this. Granted, it's 1 pm on a shitty near-sleepless Monday as I write this, but I close my eyes and can imagine the jazzy night that I hear here.

**dropthehammer11:** This song is honestly kind of sexy even though Rod Stewart is a scarecrow
 
----------------------------------------------------------------- 
#HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT GETTING A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST ROD STEWART?

**lassidoggy:** Rod Stewart was a mistake.

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: I forgot about this song after I was done listening to it.

**camerinian**: My mum is a huge Rod Stewart fan, so I’m really surprised I’ve never heard this before. Then again it is boring as tar and that little French outro is super corny so maybe there’s a reason for that

**Banananaise:** this rate is reminding me why i don't like the 70s

**ffourthofjuly:** my parents love rod stewart. i hate rod stewart. i have nothing else to say about this song. this sucks. also the french makes me feel really scummy idk what they're saying but i don't want to hear seductive french in a ROD STEWART SONG

**stansymash**: imagine if ur name was rod though, could you imagine

**PandoraKris**: The last time I heard this song, I fell asleep and almost got killed in the car... from boredom. Never again.

**calltehshots:** omg that people fucked to this creepy shit back in the day. his voice sounds like the drunk 50 year old divorcee hitting on you at the bar at 4AM and the existential dread of trying to escape this creep. my skin crawled.

**OxfordSemicolon:** Je ne parle pas français.

**MashLuke**: "Spread your wings and let me come inside", when you only want to have sex but you pretend to be romantic

**wearingsox:** This sexy song ain’t doing it for me, the French girl at the end turns me off even more. He sounds old.

**therokinrolla**: omg does this guy smoke 30 packs/s cause yikes dude i can just hear the blood hitting the mic

**superr_rad**: oh god no. this is so creepy

**Dustinhaltom**: Contains some questionable lyrics: “Don’t deny your man’s desire, you’d be a fool to stop this tide.” “Don’t say a word my virgin child.”

**NapsAndNetflix**: I think it's because my dad has a passionate hate against him and I grew up in that environment, but I do not get the appeal of Rod Stewart at all

Bieber is out right after right after a mostly Spanish song, I guess [karma is real girl](https://twitter.com/callmeanjelito/status/874460374896177152). This minimalistic fuck you track had two white devils powering it, Bieber and Ed Sheeran, and it somehow beat out Closer for year end #1 of 2016. I would say Bieber is at peak douchiness in this track, but he managed to out douche himself with Despacito. 
------------------------------------------------------
 
#MY MAMA LIKES THIS SONG

**jess_22**: the only justin bieber song that i'll admit to liking

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: I Love how douchey Bieber is here omg.

**calltehshots**: My all-time favorite of JB's work, it's just subtle enough

**Magic_warlock0-:** My all-time favorite of JB's work, it's just subtle enough

**superr_rad**: so simple and so effective. idk if it would be a hit if it werent bieber but we all have someone we sing this about..

**johnazoidberg-:** I commonly refer to this as "the good Justin Bieber song," It's simple, it's catchy, and it's a great middle finger to an ex.

**Jelboo**: I just have to say it, I absolutely love Purpose. Love Yourself is definitely not my favorite song on it (Company, Children, WDYM and Sorry are definitely better) but I'm going to give it this high score just because it reminds me of the whole 
Bieber-redemption era

-----------------------------------------------------
 
#FUCK YOURSELF

**Look_A_Fangirl:**  Come on Justin you can say fuck, you’re an adult. Anyways, I know better songs that make better use of [“Mama”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMOL0FAC1g)

**therokinrolla:** love yourself and skip this song

**Skyblade79:**  Honestly, this song is so boring and trite. Why was THIS song chosen to be #1 of the year when there were so many better? I would honestly rather have 
Closer.

**TragicKingdom1:**  This is basically a standard Ed Sheeran ballad so it's trash. Also for some reason this never felt like a massive hit to me despite being #1 overall for the year.

**Zamomattel:** HOW WAS THIS THE BEST SONG OF 2016 BY LITERALLY ANY MEASUREMENT

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: Did people really love this song so much? Jesus. This song makes me want to take a nap.

**skiddos**:  i can't stand this song. it's so ugly. out of all of the purpose singles, why this?

**eklxtreme:** the melody is nice but the lyrics are pretty dumb and it's weird how they're disguised as a "sweet pop ballad"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: Ed Sheeran can choke on a dick tbh

**AbnormalPopPunk**: more like fuck yourself

**Pugglemaster**: Can I kill myself now?

**mokitsu:** TRASH. HOW was this successful?????'?? that saxophone or whatever solo is HORRIBLE. I LOATHE this song.

**bwc222:** This song is so dull, so simple, and so lyrically inferior than the rest of the songs on this list. I hate it. I really, really do. P.S. My mama really don't like this song, and she likes almost every other song on this list.

**enecks:** There is a specter haunting pop. The specter of Ed Sheeran. He promises to bring more meaning and humor to pop, yet his writing is acidic, nasty, and not actually that clever. Love Yourself shows his authorship clearly; a black stain of meaningless metaphors, jerkish jokes, and soulless simplicity. Having Justin Bieber say these words only makes it worse: the delivery is flatter, more dull, even more basic. Is this what pop really is right now?

--------------------------------------------------------
 
#SHAME, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A VIDEO

Oh come on guys this really isn’t a bad song. If Nickelback didn’t record the same exact song for the rest of their career I think yall would appreciate this more. [Maybe you need a dose of a delusional stan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_08uF7qb5g) to convince you. Or make you glad you don’t stan Nickelback. 
------------------------------------------------------ 

#A REMINDER...

**Skyblade79**: honestly, this song isn’t that bad at all. I like it. Don’t love it, but I appreciate it.

**joshually**:  I mean this song isn’t THAT bad tbh…. And despite all that hate, he is laughing all the way to the bank

**wearingsox**: Not going to waste my 0 on this song but it definitely sucks!!!! His voice is too rough for pop/rock, their music is too basic for actual rock music.

**the_monkey**:  it isn't the worst Nickelback song released…

**nerfherder01**: IT’S NOT AS BAD AS EVERYONE SAYS, the only super cringy moment is the Nirvana ripoff near the end of the chorus

**superr_rad**: i was gonna say lifehouse was peak white boy rock but honestly...this song is fucking great. nickelback fell off pretty hard but shit no one can deny this bopness!!!!

**Swaqqalicious**: Nickelback isn't as bad as everyone thinks honestly, this song is great

**dirdbub:** I know this is Nickelback BUT - this song is iconic and nothing can stop me from giving this a 10 post-ironically

**lassidoggy:** I love Nickelback, sue me

**clipeuh:** will this be the worst rated song? probably. still it's passable. chad kroeger's gurgling voice is still annoying but its one of the few nickelback songs i can enjoy.
 
 
---------------------------------------------------------

#I WANT MY NICKEL BACK

**kioescport:** I understand why this happened but that don't mean I have to agree with it.

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: sometimes with canada you get carly rae jepsen, maple syrup, free health care, and poutine. other times you get nickelback.

**HopelesslyEmoted:** so obvious to save my zero for this but come on. Well, hm, I guess the song does have a strong hook. Aright it is a well crafted pop-song but how am I supposed to get my circle jerk on if I don't give this my zero? I just don't like this song at all

**Look_A_Fangirl**: If you ever want me to sum up my feelings on this song I will just go “uuuuuuuuuuugggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhh” Nickleback are the Walmart of pop-rock music

**Nerdy_boy_chris:** I know the Nickelback meme isn't funny, but this song is horrible.

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: Bieber was supposed to get my 0 but Nickelback is in this rate.......yeah.

[**camerinian**: I’d just like to use this platform to point out that Nickelback’s newest album a song that’s basically porn background music with Kroeger vocals and the bridge has Chad making clucking noises and also there’s a Flo Rida guest verse and I haven’t laughed this hard in a long time fuck me sideways](https://open.spotify.com/track/3G9fYXdtVgGP8IdPTuWppS)

**Banananaise:** if you had told me this song existed and was the no. 1 song in America for 2002 i would not have believed you

**callmetidle:**  Nickelback outpeaked all our faves sad face

**cedollete:** i was hoping that i could keep the fact that i kinda like nickelback a secret from /r/popheads but ALAS

**ffourthofjuly:** im sorry to everyone that thinks i have a good music taste because i actually really enjoy this song. it’s catchy and definitely emblematic of the sounds of the time period, while also being the only good nickelback song!!! its weird how a band so shitty could put out something so good & i know that this will immediately get stuck in my head for weeks

Another white bites the dust! This is pretty generic and can apply to a lot of people’s lives probably, so it makes an ideal number 1. What happened to Bryan Adams anyway? Didn’t he record a cover album of Taylor Swift? Talk about a flop.
---------------------------------------------------- 

#HE DID SOMETHING FOR ME, ANYWAY

**eklxtreme**: i should find this cheesy and bad right? idk i always liked that pre-chorus

**eribertknows**: Changing my 11 to this because it's iconic. Also listen to Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman, Bryan Adams' best song.

**Magic_warlock0-:** Solid song that hits deep in the feels. Bryan's gravely voice adds a touch of extra strength to the solid tone he's singing.

**jess_22**: ok the last 2 minutes of this song were completely unnecessary, it has a good guitar solo though

**MashLuke:** Back when a white guy with a guitar was pleasing to listen to

**noideawhatever:**  at first it was a contender for my 0, but it grew on me. it still kinda drags though

**joshually:** I think it’s a great song… but it’s just SO cheesy. I prefer Brandy & Faith Hill’s love duet cover of this song better.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: Bryan Adams deserved a better career, let’s be real.

**Elitefourbrad**: This ballad has really stood up against time, it’s a great track to play in a movie.

**ForretressArtillery**: Invented sore throat canadian vocals, chad kroeger is shook

**enecks**: The vocals drag this song hard. Alright song tho, and just the right dose of nostalgic cheese.

**HopelesslyEmoted:** Strong ballad. Memorable piano line. Carries the torch of strong "adult contemporary" hits that will eventually fade toward the end of the decade

**BlasifeelsSwift:**  I remember hearing this in the car with my mum, good memories

**hoolytoledo**: Now THIS is how you do a cheesy ballad. glares @ Look Away

**NapsAndNetflix**:  tbh Bryan Adams is incredible, a true Canadian icon
 
---------------------------------------------------------

#HE DID NOTHING FOR ME

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:**  I swear, this song never ended

**Skyblade79**: pedo alert + smoker voice = not good

**lassidoggy**: Canada’s sorry.

**leafsnash61**: Remember, this is the same guy who once sued a reference publication. That’s all that needs to be said.

**cedollete:** holw cow i HAAAATE this dude's voice

**camerinian**: Holy shit this is lame and why the ffUCK does the Spotify version cut out the track for a split second only to bring back 2 and a half minutes of musical 
wankery that goes nowhere wtf I hate white people

**veryunfinished**: This song literally makes my skin crawl. I don’t really know why.

**kioescport**: Honestly everyone that didn't give this 0 should be slightly ashamed.

**OxfordSemicolon**: This is a boring, generic song for 3 minutes, then it becomes a boring, generic song that's way too long.

**Albert_Cole:**  I can't really beat Todd in the Shadows' verdict: "Everything? Eat lunch? Go bowling? Watch reruns of MASH? It's a meaningless statement [...] He may as well have named this song *I Super-Duper Love You More Than Infinity. It's not true, and if it was, it wouldn't be healthy."

**ffourthofjuly**: this song is about six minutes and thirty four seconds too long tbh i just wanna listen to hold on fifty times instead of this

**atlastata**: If we had two 0 grades to give, this would be my other one. There are no redeeming parts of this song. Awful, bland adult contemporary.

**Jelboo**: This song grinds my gears. Every time the big radio stations here in Belgium do another "all time top 500" or something, the whole list is dominated by cheesy white rock bands and then every so often a genuinely fantastic record. You'll be lucky to find black artists in the top 100, you'll be lucky to find non-rock in there at all. And this song is always inexplicably in the top 5. What is so fantastic about this run-of-the-mill power ballad?

**calltehshots:**  fuck him!!! fuck this man! this is guantanamo bay torture music!!

**johnazoidberg-:** Is there a cliched phrase about love that ISN'T in this song? Who wrote these lyrics, a 14 year old after his 3rd ever date?

**wearingsox:**  I blame the time of year for all these sappy ass songs! Jeezus. It’s okay, it’s like an inferior “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing”.

**gannade**: what is this male rachel platten from 20 years ago. omg and its almost 7 min. no bye i dont think so
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

#AND A WARNING FOR ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE PARTNERS...

**Look_A_Fangirl:** This isn’t summer of 69 therefore I don’t care. Also this is one of the most overplayed songs of all time. If I ever get anywhere near married and have to hear this at my wedding I will flip on a bitch.

I had a bad day, you had a bad day, we all had a bad day. Im having a bad day right now actually. Yay for clinical depression! But really this song is the epitome of one-hit wonder. Generic enough to be relatable and a got damnt catchy hook…but who. Seriously, who.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
#EVERY DAY IS THE WEEKEND

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah:**  guilty pleasure even tho i know how lame everything about it is

**Inguss**: I love it so much. It may be biased as it reminds me of my childhood.

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: Probabaly my favorite song from a no name flop.

**ImADudeDuh:** This was literally the first song I bought on iTunes when I was a young angsty middle schooler, my score is 100% nostalgia based

**mustangs16:** Ahhh I still can't believe this song was as big of a hit as it was. I still love it though.

**Albert_Cole**: What's wrong with this song? He's right, I do fake a smile when I get my morning coffee.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: fuck y'all i like this song i know it will be out on the first day and still fuck you all preemptively

**NapsAndNetflix:** I know this is going to get like 30 0's but I don't care it's a decent song that gets A LOT of flack, and some of it is deserved, but also no

**wearingsox**: This song isn’t as bad as I remember it, but it’s still pretty bad. The chorus is just a tad too corny, but I like the verses.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------

#I HATE MONDAYS…

**leafsnash61**: Fuck this song.

**ffourthofjuly:** if mayonnaise was a song it would be bad day by daniel powter

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD:** listening to this would just make me more depressed

**patronsaintofaspies**: the hook is fucking unbearable lmao. also 7 years sounds really similar to this song.

**twat_brained:** I'm gonna have a bad day if I listen to this, how did it both go #1 AND get the Year-End #1? Why not "Promiscuous" or "SOS"? I hate the GP

**calltehshots:** okay this song is literally unbearable this is all american idol's fault

**mokitsu**: this reminds me of incestuous texan hillbillies and trump supporters

**Dustinhaltom:** One of my least favorite songs ever. This was the blandest hit of the 21st century until Lukas Graham came along.

**atlastata:** I wanted to give this song a few pity points for being the last 'rock' song on this list, but I can't do it. All of these white guy/acoustic guitar songs are basically the plain oatmeal of rock music.

**cloudbustingmp3**: I have a bad day every time I hear this

**Skyblade79:**  now THIS song deserves the hate that it gets. What trash.

**joshually:** I feel like this song only went to number 1 because American Idol played it every time someone got voted off.

And a boring song leaves us. Where’s the drop? Does it even have a hook?? At least this song gave Roberta Flack a big boost, who later gives the world “Killing Me Softly”. This is certainly a classic, but that doesn’t keep it from being boring.  

---------------------------------------------------

#LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT

**Dustinhaltom:** Roberta Flack does not get the recognition she deserves. This and "Killing Me Softly" are classics!

**eklxtreme:** simple, but beautiful. her voice is so gentle and strong at the same time.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** A little slow at times, but a really nice ballad

**Jelboo**: An absolutely classic ballad, timeless beauty.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: stop giving Roberta flack for this song, it is great.

**Hopelesslyemoted**: Haunting melody and voice, very sweet that this was the #1 even considering the time
 
--------------------------------------------


#I’D PREFER IF IT WERE THE LAST TIME

**nerfherder01:** I really want to like it.. the lyrics are really pretty, Roberta’s voice is too but it’s just too static for me

**superr_rad**: where are the pop girls at? because i am not here for these [melodrama](https://open.spotify.com/album/2B87zXm9bOWvAJdkJBTpzF)tic ballads

**kioescport**: HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? It's like they specifically designed this to be as boring as possible.

**borpo**:  Nice song, but a little too long and repetitive

**vapourlomo:** Hey, Roberta, could you speak up a bit? Or maybe sing a song with some actual energy? Thanks!

**TragicKingdom1:** I respect the artistry here but it's dull and goes nowhere.

**MrSwearword:** good vocals but I was tired of it by the two-minute mark.

More white guy rock leaves the island. This song is mayonnaise on white bread. 
-------------------------------------------------
 
#THIS SONG GIVES ME LIFE….HOUSE

**twat_brained**: So THAT'S what this song is called. I've heard it several times on the radio but never knew the name. Tbh it's nothing too sensational.

**eklxtreme**: suddenly all the pop-rock bands of my childhood are rushing back into my head. i didn't even know it was this old. this is definitely getting a high score from me.

**Noideawhatever**: nostalgic af, i can’t help but love it

**OxfordSemicolon:**  Holy crap, a contemporary Christian band hit #1, and it's a song I kind of like. (They don't call themselves that, but I heard it on Christian stations in middle/high school, so that's close enough.

**skiddos**: I used to love Lifehouse so much

**therokinrolla:** undeniably a bop, undeniably forgettable

**ForretressArtillery:** Decent song but not Lifehouse's best. Everything is a far better song and slays my life tbh. Shame that never charted...

---------------------------------------------
 
#BARELY HANGING ON

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: Can this song end please?

**MashLuke**: The singer has apparently said he wrote this in 5 minutes, that explains the repetitive lyrics

**Skyblade79:** I actually hate this more than Nickelback. His voice is SO annoying.

**hoolytoledo**: I just vividly remember being so drained and annoyed listening to this song on the radio during my early childhood.

**veryunfinished**: i thought this would be my 0 but i guess uptown funk did really well in 2015

**Inguss**: not my cup of tea

**nerfherder01**: The singer wants to sound like Kurt Cobain but he sounds constipated instead

**Zamomattel:** I had never heard this song prior to the rate and now I'm pissed I had to

**atlastata**: Look, Nickleback is bad. Really bad. But at least How You Remind Me rocks. Like, it's an actual rock song. I'd listen to it a million times before I gave Hanging by a Moment's bland, formulaic, paint-by-numbers adult contemporary hit another spin. These generic rock songs were a god damned epidemic in the early-00's and I listened to every damned one of them and they were all terrible.

----------------------------------------------------------
 
#IN A DIFFERENT WORLD…

**calltehshots**: okay...listen...don't look at me like that. i love this song. this shit is fire. in an alternate universe where i lived in a small town and drank beers with my meth dealer boyfriend this would be our wedding song.
 
--------------------------------------------------------

#DEFINITELY A DIFFERENT WORLD, LIKE REDDITORS IRL CAN FIND GIRLFRIENDS? PLEASE..

**HopelesslyEmoted:**  Just awful. Only somewhat redeeming factor was that my girlfriend at the time would sing it to me and say it reminded her of me, I guess that's a sweet sentiment

#LOOK AT ME

**ThatParanoidPenguin:** This is not even my favorite Chicago song, idk what this is doing at the top song of the year. It's alright.

**mustangs16:** I shouldn't be surprised a Chicago song is on this list, but I am kind of surprised it's this Chicago song

**Nerdy_boy_chris:** Now that’s an 80s power ballad

**Albert_Cole:** As an avid Todd in the Shadows fan, I had been told that I should be suspicious of Chicago. However, as whiny as the lyrics are, I still kind of dig this.

**eribertknows**: Nice cute little breakup song

**atlastata:** I’m a sucker for 80s bombast.

**jess_22**: lol you gotta love a good 80s power ballad

**Elitefourbrad:**  wasn’t really a big fan of the talk singing in the beginning of the song, but once it picked up it got a lot bit better. I ended up really loving this song with the 
rhodes and the rock-infused chorus with great vocals as well.

**enecks:**  Is there such a thing as too 80’s? This is it. It’s a good song, but holy shit the 90’s could not come any sooner for music. Like A Prayer is better.

**vapourlomo**: I am a HUGE sucker for these stadium-sized, mega-cheese 80s pop power ballads. My personal favorite is "Total Eclipse of the Heart," which should be Scotland's national anthem if they end up splitting off, but Chicago's made quite a few classics in this mini-genre. "Look Away," with its soap opera lyrics and clanging guitars, is definitely one of those classics.

---------------------------------------------
 
#NO, REALLY, LOOK AWAY

**clipeuh**: Boring arena rock.

**Jelboo**: Once again, this decade has given us much better music than this rather dull white dad rock music... The charts sometimes really fail to reflect the feel of a time period. Shows that you really know music you gotta dig deeper.

**MrSwearword:** just made of no

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** This is the dumb kind of cheesy, Chicago needed to stay in the 70s and they're somehow still a band

**camerinian**: hahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahaahah god this is embarassing

**veryunfinished**: it’s weak! I don’t have the patience for Chicago.

**Magic_warlock0-**: I could never get into this, just not a fan of many aspects of this song. A shame, Chicago has a number of hits that are better than this!

**awryj**: 90s_movie_credits.mp3

**HopelesslyEmoted**: I really want to like this song more

**hoolytoledo:**  I'm just kinda baffled how this ended up holding the title when there were WAAAY loads of memorable and iconic proper power ballads in 80's than this. (eg. Can't Fight This Feeling, Total Eclipse of the Heart, Eternal Flame, Time After Time, Forever Young, etc.)

**ffourthofjuly:** i hate chicago let’s leave it at that. actually lets not: chicago is literally the musical equivalent of an moldy loaf of wonder bread. the equivalent of a cbs daytime game show. the equivalent of the smell of your grandfather’s apartment. the equivalent of bingo in a church basement god DAMN i hate this band

Paul Mccartney’s first song out is a self-aware bop about uhhhh..silly love songs. Mccartney received a lot of criticism on his writing, but he showed critics where to shove it with the release of this massive hit. McCartney has had quite the impressive career, hence why he’s on this list twice, and he has more than earned his position as one of the greatest pop songwriters of all time.
----------------------------------------------

#JUST A SILLY LOVE SONG

**ForretressArtillery**: A silly love song about silly love songs. inception BWAAAAA

**awryj:** Really summery and nice.

*[ThatParanoidPenguin](http://2ykov18qyj81ii56523ib0ue.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/kanye-penguin.jpg):** I love the intro, but everything after it feels like your usual disco-influenced pop stuff. I'm really not into the vocals he provides here, but that's probably my Donna Summer bias speaking. However, the layered vocals in the second half are gorgeous and I'm glad the song ends on a high note.

**mustangs16**: Definitely not Wings' best work, but good enough still to get a nine from me.

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: Vocals sounds weird here and it should not be almost 6 minutes long but it's a bop!

**dropthehammer11**: That intro tho. Decent song all around

**eklxtreme**: i lowkey like wings more than beatles. but really tho, what's wrong with silly love songs? damn those strings r nice. all of the instrumentation, really.

**twat_brained**: Paul McCartney with TWO songs on this list? What a legend! I don’t know why people say “Hey Jude” is the best thing he’s come up with; this sounds so much better! No, my recency bias is not clouding my judgment!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: One of Paul's cheesier songs, but I can't help but love it. I love the melody on the 'I loooovee youuu' part over the string section, and it just 
grooves. That saxophone solo is iconic, and Paul is a legend

**Look_A_Fangirl**: FINALLY ANOTHER GOOD SONG AFTER DRAGGING THROUGH SO MANY SHIT SONGS.

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: This loses points for dragging on a bit too long, but it's a good song nonetheless.

**Albert_Cole:** This is the silliest love song on the list (with the possible exception of Sugar Sugar)

------------------------------------------------

#SILLY INDEED

**ffourthofjuly:** don't get me wrong, i love paul mccartney. i think he's a musical genius and one of the most important people currently living right now. i stanned the beatles, i gave hey jude a 9. but god DAMN wings was a mistake lmfao who let this man go from writing classics like "back in the ussr" and "eleanor rigby" to turning out songs like this. i miss fiery beatles paul, not lovestruck easy listening paul

**stansymash**: listen if i needed a band to replace the beatles id take the shaggs over wings any day

**Jelboo**: You can always depend on Paul McCartney to write sugary sweet songs; and this is one I'm not very much a fan of.

**DrunkHurricane**: this song is so corny and stupid it's genuinely infuriating.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: Paul McCartney can do better than this shit, lets be real.

**enecks:** A good song, but a little too long and too soulless. The #1 could’ve been a lot worse (Afternoon Delight) or a lot better (Bohemian Rhapsody).

**dirdbub**: this song is almost filler, but that bassline is too good to give it my filler 
score. too bad the bassline was wasted on kind of a boring song, it would have slapped on a song with a bit of a different topic

**vapourlomo**: Trim this from six minutes to like three, and you've got a decent McCartney jam. The groove is there, but it's just so, so repetitive and it NEVER ENDS.

**mokitsu**: this is so cheesy and the type of cheese that's filled with mold

**letsallpoo:** I don't mind silly love songs, but I'd prefer if they didn't take six minutes and go nowhere

**OxfordSemicolon:** What's wrong with that is that this is not a good silly love song. McCartney can do and has done so much better than this. What even is that chorus? Why do parts of the song suddenly start and stop? You want to know who's had enough of silly love songs? Me. I have, by the end of this. This song is bad (though other songs in the rate are sonically or lyrically worse), stupidly repetitive with stupid lyrics, generally janky, and stretches the few good ideas it has well past their breaking points, but that's not why it's my zero. This thing is a zero because it's bad and smug about it.

Another positive bop leaves the thunderdome! Happiness and love? Not in my /r/popheads.

------------------------------------------------
 
#ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE 

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: That groovy piano makes this bop

**cedollete**: FIRST OFF the album cover of them just holding dogs is the cutest thing ever!!!! the song is really good and catchy too!

**lassidoggy**:  All I can say is that Tennille can give us passion and power with her voice. The Captain better catch up.

**camerinian:** Look this isn’t good, like, at all, but this sort of doofy track is actually a breath of fresh air from all of these dreary ballads in how shamelessly white it is

**Banananaise**: the slight shifts downwards on the "forever" and "together" are great

**Jelboo**: Damn I didn't expect that synth breakdown. I'm a fan, this is a fun little track

**calltehshots**: this bop makes me wanna dance in the street.

**Mudkip1**: a cute bop but I could see myself getting sick of it pretty quick, so I'd say a 7 is a decent score

**Elitefourbrad**: I like to Mo Town feeling it had with the catchy lyrics and great funkay guitar.

**Swaqqalicious**: So much nostalgia with this song, I almost forgot it existed. Such a good track.

**HopelesslyEmoted**: Probably the boppiest track to this point. Cheesy and campy for all the right reasons.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: Honestly, this is the funniest rate I've ever seen, I love this combination of artists. This is a certified 70s bop, with some intricate production and some extremely catchy vocals. This rate is making me want to dig around some crates and listen to some 70s music (really one of the decades I'm extremely unfamiliar with)! And oh man, the weird bridge thing is awesome! And the piano outro!
 
---------------------------------------------------------

#SINGLE LIFE

**Magic_warlock0-:** Not a fan of the beat at all, especially that little synth thing halfway through. A shame, the lyrics are pretty decent.

**Zamomattel:** Retrograde cheese, this just is not my thing at all

**Inguss**: horrible bass, horrible synths in the end and just horrible to listen to

**enecks**: This instrumental pisses me off to no end. It is such a hot mess. I mean, it at least blocked Rhinestone Cowboy from #1, I song I hate more than I like sucking dick.

**patronsaintofaspies**: This is fun to dance to, but the production is so dated. It's not a bad song, but I'm not sure if I would listen to it regularly.

**vapourlomo**: Todd in the Shadows described this duo as sounding like "your drunk aunt doing karaoke after a few too many daiquiris," and I can't argue with that. But idk drunk aunts are kind of fun in their own ridiculous way, so I can't hate this too much.

**TragicKingdom1:**  Would be scored higher without that misplaced synth breakdown near the end.

**MrSwearword**: throw the Captain and Tennille the fuck overboard; this is awful

**whatyourheartdesires:** This sounds a bit too simple

--------------------------------------------------
 
#SO IT TURNS OUT…

**Albert_Cole**: Wikipedia: "Tennille filed for divorce from Dragon in the State of Arizona on January 16, 2014, after 39 years of marriage. Dragon stated he was unaware of this until he was served with the divorce papers."

The next song to go out only got one 11, and it was mine. What can I say, I love me a song with a storyline, and in my defense I’m not the only one. The song sold 3 million records in 3 weeks, which is pretty incredible. And if you didn’t at least smile a little when you found out homegirl tied 100 ribbons instead of just 1, you might be soulless.

#TREE HUGGERS

**Magic_warlock0-**: Whimsical and has a great theme to waiting on your love after a long time. I dig it.

**skiddos**: all of these older songs are so cute

**skyblade79:** Awe, this is such a cute little story :)

**Inguss**: a happy feel-good song

**bwc222**: This song was the best discovery I made from listening to all these. I don't remember hearing it before, but this song is so heartwarming. A certified 70s bop!

**nerfherder01**: This is the most adorable song I have ever heard in my life. And it’s so catchy!

**superr_rad:** this is so cute and makes me really happy

**Elitefourbrad**: A great upbeat happy song with a happy go lucky feeling that I really love from songs.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Bonus points for being used in two very important protests that are dear to my heart. Considering what this song is actually about, it's honestly not that bizarre that this song's been used to fight against dictators.

-------------------------------------------------------
 
#TIE A YELLOW RIBBON ROUND THE OLE SKIP BUTTON

**enecks:** For some reason the instrumental pisses me off. I kinda like the narrative going on in it, with a prisoner wondering if he’s going to be welcomed back. Not deserving of #1 FFS considering it was the year where GOD DAMN [LET’S GET IT ON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsUGi9FvWkw) came out.

**timothy444**: Just barely a bop but it sounds like a children's song. Out of my /r/popheads please.

**BlasifeelSwift**: It just finished and I can’t remember a single note of it.

**vapourlomo:** 70s cheese is the worst cheese. NEVER let Baby Boomers try to tell you that pop music was that much better in their day.

**Dustinhaltom:** I don't see how anyone under the age of 65 can like this song.

**MrSwearword:** I could eat three corn on the cobs and that would be less corny than this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: I feel like this is really unremarkable, yet serviceable - it's got a really nice instrumental and great backing vocals, but I don't care for the main singer and the lyrics.

**Mustangs16**: Overly cheesy and not in a good way.

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**:  so this shit is about some guy coming home from jail on a bus, but if his girl aint gonna tie the yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree, he aint coming home? http://imgur.com/a/HdgB5

#FRIENDS ARE PARAMOUNT

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** This is the cheesiest song ever, it's kind of beautifully cheesy though

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: This makes me thankful for my friends

**Zamomattel**: The Cheddariest of cheese but also still cute. Wish it was just Dionne tbh

**jess_22**: HOW have I never heard this song before?

**skiddos**: what a star-studded collaboration!

**joshually:** Can you imagine being a music fan in 1986 and this song comes out? It is literally the popheads equivalent of Carly, Lorde, Lana & Troye coming together for a song about friendship & love, except these megastars were A-listers, and not the C-listers I just mentioned.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: iconic as fuck

**themonkey_:** So cliche but we all cried at grad hearing this bullshit

**Elitefourbrad:** I mean how can you not give a song with Dionne Warwick, Elton John, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder a 10? A great 80’s ballad about always being be counted on and that’s what friends are for. I actually just watched the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt episode that Dionne was on where she performed with Titus and it was a very great song.

**patronsaintofaspies:** This sounds...really dated and cheesy, but I like it. If I was a little older or a little younger this would have sound too dated to like, though

**dirdbub**:  tbh a pic of all of them should be the next mod pic, this is a STACKED line up. Elton absolutely kills his part too, like usual (I mean, of COURSE the gays kill their part. what else is there to expect?)
 
 
#I CAN LIVE WITHOUT THEM

**lassidoggy:** Dionne may be able to talk to the dead, but this is unimpressive.

**Look_A_Fangirl**: Is that really what friends are for? Yay for my lonely friendless sad girl life :/

**wearingsox**: This is too saccharine for my taste, it was the 80s when all these group songs were popular. It sounds so forced, though they’re all great singers.

**cedollete**: this is just....... so bad and boring, i'm sorry but. this feels like "we are the world" but even worse somehow

**camerinian**: Anyone here play The Simpsons Game? Yeah, if you did you’ll know why this gets my 0

**OxfordSemicolon**: I had to listen to this four times before I could remember anything about it other than the harmonica.

**Banananaise:** okay it's a good song but best of the entire year? were the 80s this boring?

**eribertknows**: The lyrics sound like a first grader wrote them, and yet, people in the comments section of YouTube are saying things like this: "People with talent like this are still out there, they're just flipping burgers or something. When music, or any art, gets too powerful because it's so good, they change it. They give us rap to make us dislike blacks."

**Jelboo**: Eehhhhhhhhh fairly sure this year delivered better music than this. All-star cast (Stevie Wonder especially is an absolute legend) but not an all-star song by any means

**ForretressArtilerry**: Friends are for making generic pop ballads

**Kioescport**: This is everything I hate about the 80s

**ImADudeDuh**: seems like a rejected disney song tbh

2 (1): justdancegottabeok

1 (1): Dustinhaltom 

This absurdly uplifting tune topped the charts for 6 weeks in 1971. This song was used a lot in anti-war demonstrations and was interpreted as having [religious symbolism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ub7EWmDRU0), but since the song was created for a kid’s show that never happened, I think the song is just about a drunk bullfrog named Jeremiah. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
 
#THE WORLD HAS BEEN BLESSED

**eklxtreme**: ah this is the southern rock vibe that i loved about the 70s (just looked it up and they're from LA tho), a bit cheesy but it sounds nice

**cedollete**: a BILLION times better than i expected a song called "joy to the world" to be!! this was going to get my ten before the lyric "make sweet love to you," which just really takes me out of the song tbh. it's a small lyric though so i won't dock too much for it

**clipeuh**: never heard of it before this rate, still sounds like decent 60s rock. is it a gospel song? Idk

**Magic_warlock0-**: Goddamn this is how you do a song that gets you up and excited about life

**calltehshots**: this shit makes me want to drink a 40 by a creek so that's an instant 10

**themonkey_**: This song bangs even today. JOY TO THE FISHES IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA..

**patronsaintofaspies**: How come I've never heard of this song before?! It's amazingly catchy!

**carly-rae-sremmurd:** this is stupid and fun. the dadrock equivalent of Party Rock Anthem
 
#TRY AGAIN

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** Kind of a silly, dumb song, but I can't like it cause the Broncos play it after every win and fuck the Broncos

**Lassidoggy**: It suffers the same fate as To Sir With Love. It's an iconic bop, but production sucks.

**Look_A_Fangirl**: Admit it, you all thought this would the Christmas song too. Either way, jesus I hate super preachy songs like “y’all the word has gotta love each other, woo”. Also, why the fuck are we wishing joy to the fishes, THEY ARE FISHES, NOT HUMANS. And THEN, this bitch starts bragging about being able to get all the ladies. This is messy and terrible.

**Dustinhaltom**: Three Dog Night's whole career was taking other people's songs and making them worse, yet they were somehow hugely successful in the early '70s. There's nothing great about a bunch of mustachioed guys singing about a frog.

**Stansymash**: Fellas with guitars thats what we have here yes boys this is most certainly the case

--------------------------------------------------------
 
#HAVE YOU MET THE BULLFROG?

**chanelephant**: JEREMIAH WAS A BULLFROOOOG

**Dropthehammer11**: JEREMIAH WAS A BULLFROG. I like the guitar a lot on this track
twat_brained: How the hell can someone befriend a bullfrog? And wouldn’t wine kill it? And why would you wish joy to fishes but none of the other animals? What about Jeremiah? Why did we sing this at our summer camp? How did this go #1? Let alone was the year-end #1? I should stop before I go insane.

#THERE’S ONLY ONE FLO…

**eklxtreme**: i used to rap along to this song on Lyrics.com every saturday in 2008 before i went off to saturday school and eventually i was able to rap the whole thing by heart. i never lost this skill :)

**atlastata**: I spent most of the late 00's listening to indie rock in a college dorm, so I completely missed this song on the radio. Damn this song goes hard.

**jess_22:** this is such an iconic song

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: AHHH I FEEL SO NOSTALGIC WITH THIS SONG. Defs one of the first songs that I had on my first ever MP3 player. This is Flo Rida's peak tbh.

**superr_rad**:  remember when uggs were huge and they were everywhere? this timeless bop will always remind you

**dirdbub**: okay okay another fact: fuck yes

**berober04**: Singlehandedly made Apple Bottom Jeans the driving force in fashion they are today!

**NapsAndNetflix:** this song literally created the greatest rapper of our generation and while it's not his best, one has to respect their R.O.O.T.S to respect their future

**Ispilledsomething**:  I miss T-Pain honestly. The only real weak point is Flo Rida who doesn't add anything to the song.

------------------------------------------------------------
 
#AND FORTUNATELY ONLY ONE RIDA

**OxfordSemicolon**: This is so dated. Back in 2008 they still had their porn on posters.

**Elitefourbrad**: Flo Rida is horrible

**therokinrolla:** i love it bc the title aptly describes my score for this overplayed song

**angusaditus:** nope nope nope (but I like the memes though)

**clipeuh**: annoying after hearing it too often. it hasnt aged well

**stansymash**:  this was a rough couple of years wasn't it. jesus

**BlasifeelsSwift**: american explain yourself

**johnazoidberg-**: Flo Rida please, just stop. You ruined rap music, you ruined 
Wrestlemania, the state of Florida was already ruined but you're not helping.

**enecks**: WTF is this sub-Soundcloud beat. Sounds like a shitty distorted whistle. This was a garbage year for billboard tho (asides from Viva La Vida)

**joshually**:  A sharp decrease in quality of #1 songs of the year happened around this time…

------------------------------------------------------------ 

#IS THIS LEAF’S #BRAND?

**ffourthofjuly**: the production on this doesn’t deserve to be as smooth and as fire as it is!!!! can’t believe flo rida made real bops!!!!! if this wins the rate ill know that it was rigged thanks leaf

**ThatParanoidPenguin:** /u/leafsnash61 's 11. And rightfully so. This slapped back then and it slaps now.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:**  One of the most iconic club anthems ever, that hook will never not make me yell along to it, I miss this Flo Rida (sorry leaf)

#WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK THE COMMENTS FOR THIS WERE GOING TO BE?

**TragicKingdom1:** guessing 4 other references to the "why you always lyin'" meme in the comments for this

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: WHY YOU LYING? WHY YOU FUCKING LYING?

**superr_rad:** obligatory why the fuck u lyinnnn but really the top selling song of 1998 was about a boner 

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: Would have got a 10 if it was Why You Always Lying

**granitenotebook**: ooooooh why you always lyin

**Look_A_Fangirl**: A few words my friends, why the fuck you lying, why you always lying, umm oh my god, stop fucking lying.

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: WHY THE FUCK YOU LYIN', WHY YOU ALWAYS LYING

**camerinian**: You: Hey this is the ‘why the fuck you lying’ song LOL! Me, an intellectual: "Too Close" is a song by American R&B group Next, featuring uncredited vocals from Vee of Koffee Brown. It was released in September 1997 as the second single fr

**cloud[busting](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CmZBfbfXgAAdanO.jpg)mp3**: STOP FUCKIN LYIN

**MashLuke:** Just realized this is where the "why the fuck you lying" meme came from

**BlasifeelsSwift:**  boring, why the fuck you lying is better

**enecks:** Why the fuck you lying? Why you always lying? Why did you rob My Heart Will Go On?

**eribertknows**: LMFAO

**ffourthofjuly**: HNNNNNN OH MY GOD

**Jelboo**: damn that meme hit me out of nowehere

**Zamomattel**: memes aside this songs bops

**NFranklin50:** this song has been ruined by memes

**Dustinhaltom**: The fact that a song about boners became a hit is funny. The fact that a song about boners also was the most successful song of the year is absolutely hysterical.

**stansymash**: we need more artists to sing about boners, they’re a fact of life

**atlastata**: What even is this?

#JOKES


**NapsAndNetflix**: it's funny this is by next because when it comes on I hit next lol rekt

lunasaflowers: Honestly? Justice for Happy. And also the Macarena.

(Also, not gonna lie, I'm always surprised that Boom Boom Pow is the BEP song that's 2009's #1 SOTY and not I Gotta Feeling, which felt much more everywhere and memorable to me. And is also a vastly superior song-- I'll admit BBP has a so-bad-it's-bizarrely-brilliant charm, but holy shit, how did the GP let it rule the top of the charts for so long?)
