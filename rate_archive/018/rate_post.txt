Welcome to the Billboard Year-End Rate of 1967-2016!

[Seatbelts, everyone!](http://i.imgur.com/k5Mcx0t.jpg) 

*(Pleeeease let this be a normal field trip)
(With leaf? No way!)*

We're going on an adventure through time; more specifically checking out some of the biggest hits of the last 50 years in pop music. All of the songs here landed #1 on their respective year's Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles list.

What started as a throwaway idea to gauge interest has somehow evolved into a full-fledged rate. We would have agreed on more songs but that would have been overkilly, admittedly. We all have lives here - except for /u/fuckupsomecommasyeah, mind you - we can't be spending all our free time doing rates!
____________________________________________________
Let's just cut to the chase, shall we? The 51 songs **(1997 was a double single, technically, so please rate 1997 as TWO separate songs)** we'll be rating, starting from 1967, are...

_____________________________________________________
As daunting of a task as this may seem to do alone, this is in fact a joint effort! 

Unfortunately, my schedule most days does not match up with the majority of the subreddit to hold a reveal at an accomadating time. 
The lovely /u/superr_rad has volunteered in assisting me in doing the actual reveal, which I probably won't be present for. She's doing me a huge favour.

Please give her the time and respect she deserves when the reveal is happening. This is as much her rate as it is mine. 
____________________________________________________
**A few things to consider**:

- Please try and be as OBJECTIVE as possible. We all have our biases, I get that, but when rating the songs try to give them an accurate rating to what you feel is best.

- Recency bias is another factor to be aware of: the subreddit has a bit of a younger demographic, but don't go rating the songs from the 1960's low because you've never heard them before, etc.

**Rules**:

- Listen to each song (duh) and assign each a score between 1 and 10.
- I kindly ask that you guys give nice, whole, round ratings. The only scores I will except will either end in a whole number or point-five (.5). 
For example, if you send me a score for a song of 7.3, I will not accept that - either give it a 7 or a 7.5. A 7.3 is a stupid, unassured rating. Be confident in your scores!
- I will not accept your ballot if you have one or more scores missing. Otherwise, why you doin' the rate, homie?! 
- All the songs (minus When Doves Cry) above have a YouTube link attached to them so every song is easily accessible. [/u/letsallpoo has also made a Spotify playlist with all of the songs - including Prince - which you can access here.](https://play.spotify.com/user/thepopheads/playlist/6cenIL4YbKn3aJ8IO7XLAQ?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open) If you're having issues listening to any song(s), feel free to message me or /u/ superr_rad and we can help you out. 
- Do not consider your scores confidential. 
- You may give ONE song a zero (0) and ONE song an eleven (11), if you see fit. No more than ONE zero (0) and ONE eleven (11). 
- If you feel like a score of yours needs to be changed, you can change scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards, here or on Discord.
- Feel free to leave comments on songs! If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! I'll get into how you should format your scores momentarily.
- Please send in your scores to me (/u/leafsnash61) by midnight June 1st PST / 3am EST.

____________________________________________________

I'll quickly run down how you should format your scores, should you be new to rates on r/popheads.

**Use this prepared link to send in your scores if you wish! (shoutout /u/letsallpoo once again).** Link [HERE.](http://tinyurl.com/m6366kw)

This is **CORRECT**:

Love Yourself: 1 My mama don't like this song and she likes every song

This is **INCORRECT**:

*Love Yourself: 1: My mama don't like this song and she likes every song*

*Love Yourself: My mama don't like this song and she likes every song! 1*

*Love Yourself: I'm giving this a 1 because my mama don't like this song and she likes every song.*

*Love Yourself: 1-My mama don't like this song and she likes every song!*

*Love Yourself: 1 (My mama don't like this song and she likes every song)*

*Love Yourself: 1 - My mama don't like this song and she likes every song*

##Scores are due midnight June 1st PST / 3am EST.
