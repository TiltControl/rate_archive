We will (hopefully) be starting around 5pm CST, about 45 minutes from the time I post this.

I want to sincerely apologize for the rate being later than I initially announced, I was really unprepared and thought I was hot shit and could do it all within a few hours. Thank you to /u/leafsnash61  for helping write some of the summaries and also providing shitposts and memes for you guys!!!

**A handful of thank yous to begin....**

**Firstly,** a huge, huge, HUGE thank you to my co-host /u/superr_rad who did me a huge solid and hosted the actual rate for me when I was unable to. She took all the work I did and made it even better than I could have imagined it. Please shower her with all the love. She made this rate what it was.

**Secondly,** thank you to everyone who joined us whether it was on Discord, plug.dj or in this thread here. It was a blast!

**Thirdly,** thank you to everyone who participated in the rate. I was blown away by the amount of participants. An amazing turnout from an amazing bunch of people.

This rate was a lot of work, but it wasn't perfect as I'm sure you guys noticed. I made a handful of errors along the way so I apologize first and foremost for any errors. Naturally some would slip through the cracks, but I feel terrible regardless. 

Fun fact - I did this whole rate by hand with pen and paper and a spreadsheet so I guess that explains the errors. Anyway, let's move on from that....

As fun as this rate was, I'm honestly glad it's over. I've been stressing over it for weeks now. I can't look at these numbers and write-ups any more. 

Thank you to everyone who joined. I hope you all had fun. We can now look forward to the next few months of rates!

Thank you, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, to all of you.

Albert_Cole: So I don't have to edit this (just in case it looks like I cheated) I'm calling When Doves Cry, Call Me and Careless Whisper as other Top 5 songs/strong #1 contenders

I also had Hey Jude on my list before yesterday (but judging by certain comments, that must have got a few 0s) and Bridge Over Troubled Water, Physical and The Sign (until they went out). With how high the standards are at this point, the winner will have to be a song with very few low scores (like [Billie Jean in its rate, which didn't get any scores lower than 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5z0ynj/rate_reveal_the_great_80s_rate_day_3_the_way_they/deukjlm/))

Another song suffering from recent-overplayed-bias, because this was EVERYWHERE in 2015. But if you don’t agree that this is a hot damn BOP all the way around I cannot trust you…

 
Anyways, as per usual, they got sued for [copyright infringement](https://youtu.be/pfTr_fgQpvg) and you can be the judge of that. I believe this song single handedly [inspired](https://open.spotify.com/album/6f6tko6NWoH00cyFOl4VYQ) several [records](https://open.spotify.com/album/4VFG1DOuTeDMBjBLZT7hCK) after it, and now we have a wonderful bloom of funk influence in hip hop! We all win!
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#FUNK ME UP
 
**Magic_warlock0-**: Fun and silly, much needed breath of fresh air at the time for me. Song is all about looking good, feeling good, and having fun to me!
 
**Jelboo**: Funky, cool, full of swagger - nice.
 
**camerinian**: Give this song maybe another year of distance for the overplay to subside and I guarantee this song will go off at every opportunity, such a brilliantly constructed song from almost every angle
 
**nerfherder01**: Funky pop is what I love the most and this song just screams fun. I love the percussion in the last part after the bridge/chorus
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees**: Incredibly catchy and insanely well produced. Mark Ronson invented brass instruments. Sorry Carly.
 
**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** I don't care how overplayed this song got, it's so well produced and Bruno's vocals slay and there are SO many iconic lines,
 
**twat_brained:** THIS IS A BOP AND HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE THE YEAR-END #1, DON’T @ ME
 
**MrSwearword**: Shit is funky as fuck and I live.
 
**NapsAndNetflix**:  I genuinely think this is one of the greatest songs of the 2000's
 
**didrbub**: yea okay this is true this is a fact this song is a Slapper and I cannot fathom minus overexposure why you would hate this song
 
**timothy444:** This should've been #1 in the 80's
 
**Nerdy_boy_chris:** this is one of the greatest songs ever recorded. Don't lie to yourselves, this is musical perfection.
 
**vapourlomo:** No exaggeration: This is a top-five pop song of all time. "Uptown Funk" is MJ/Prince/Beatles/Gaga-level quality, and it officially made me a Bruno fan. This will be played at wedding receptions until we all die, god willing.
 
**ffourthofjuly:**  i can’t pass up any mark ronson production. its virtually impossible for me, and when you add a nice groove and bruno mars at his peak retro, it creates the perfect song. i must’ve heard this a thousand times but every time it comes on i know that i’ll sing every word and start dancing as soon as “THIS HIT THAT ICE COLD” graces my ears
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
[#DOWNTOWN]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGhoLcsr8GA)
 
**therokinrolla**: like 99% of the songs here, it has just been KILLED by overplay. But, it is a really fun throwback bop, but it kinda seems like thats all bruno can do at this point
 
**bwc222**:  I think recency bias hurt newer songs more than older ones due to hearing them overplayed on the radio the past few years. "Uptown Funk" certainly hurt the most from this.
 
**angusaditus**:  I don't hate this song but I sure do leave the dance floor whenever it gets played.
 
**mokitsu:**  the only time i bopped to this was when beyoncé sang it
 
**Pugglemaster:** kill me now
 
**BlasifeelsSwift:** no, this is wrong, this should have never existed, this is why aliens refuse to communicate with us, who asked for this, who??? I wanna fight them. GARBAGE, G A R B A G E
 
**jess_22:** I'll admit that Bruno Mars is talented but i don't think there's a single song that he's released that i've liked
 
**dropthehammer11**: Okay, I USED to love this song. I did. But after being played into the fucking ground, I've developed an undying hate for it that has not ceased. I may come back around to liking it again, but for right now, I just fucking hate it and that's why it gets my 0

Look_A_Fangirl: #The Rumor Come Out: Does Bruno Mars is Gay?
___
**Bruno Mars is gay** is the most discussed in the media in the few years ago. Even it has happened in 2012, but some of the public still curious about what is exactly happening and to be the reason there is a rumor comes out about his gay. At that time he became the massive social networking rumor.

The public, especially his fans are shocked. He just came out with his bad rumor which is spread massively. This time is not about his music career, but his bad rumor. The rumor is out of standardize of hoax, according the last reported this singer revealed himself as homosexual. Do you still believe or not, this rumor is really much talked by people even in a person of his fans

Wikipedia: "Commercially, "Somebody That I Used to Know" is Gotye's most successful and signature song" - [ya don't say?](http://i.imgur.com/GtKFRun.png) This lowkey, mid-tempo ballad seemingly came out of nowhere so it's only fitting that Gotye went back to that nowhere. Has he died? Did he have to go into witness protection? Did he change his name to Quavo and is actually still a chart-topping success? Some say we'll never know.... As a kid, did you ever draw a bunch of random lines on a piece of paper and then colour in the spaces with different colours so you could make your own impromptu stained glass-esque drawing? Well if you did, you were the inspiration for the music video so you can take that to bed with you.
 

 
------------------------------------------------------------------

[#I WANNA KNOW YOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM6_W6U-j7w)

**wearingsox**: I loved this song from the moment it hit the reddit frontpage. The back and forth between Kimbra and Gotye is clever, her feature brings so much to the song instead of being tacked on. It doesn’t get old for me unlike many hits.

**Mudkip1**:  one of the coolest songs that the GP has ever stanned. gotye is a legend and kimbra is an icon

**MashLuke:** Best pop song of the 00's, fight me

**Banananaise:** everyone hates this song now because of how overplayed it was but gotye and kimbra are angels on earth and never before have two artists been more deserving of the word.

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy:** I remember giving this song a score lower in the the Billboard 2012 rate. I apperciate this song more now since then

**Ispilledsomething**: Excellent song, I hope to see some more Gotye in the future.

**TheKneesOfOurBees:** When will your fave create a smash hit using the melody of baa baa black sheep?

**misstututulle**:  Kimbra really makes the song, too bad both of them are almost destined to be one hit wonders.

**ImADudeDuh**: Indie music King and Queens. Such a haunting song that I'm really happy got huge.

**Magic_warlock0-**:  I love the concept of the song: two people with sides to a story after a failed relationship. The actual music is okay, but the lyrics and viewpoints shine in this!

**ffourthofjuly**:  yeah so if careless whisper didn’t get my 11 it would’ve went to gotye here, how this managed to get here still confounds me today, its such a wholly weird and non mainstream song that it puzzles me how genpop let it get so high, but, thats why i love it: it’s odd, it sounded different than the entire radio landscape at the time, it had one of the most memorable videos in recent memory, and its too damn catchy. every element comes together in the best way and it helps that i have some really good memories associated with this song

**PandoraKris**: The most complete, perfect pop* song ever (out of the 51 songs). I had plans to brainwash my future generations with this song, so that, 1000 years later, when aliens decided to come and stay at our planet, when one of the alien students from university exchange program asked them questions like, what's the best song ever produced from this planet, then my great-great-great grandson / granddaughter able to name this song and sing them glory lyrics to our alien friends, and tell them this song is the most beautiful music ever existed on our planet ~~while ignore the fact that CRJ and Lady Gaga ever existed~~. After that, our alien friends will spread this beautiful music to their homeland and... This song will never disappear, ever. Beautiful music are meant to share among living creatures, don't you think? I hope I inspire you to do the same thing like me too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#THERE’S A REASON IT’S “USED” TO KNOW

**superr_rad**: sorry i didnt like this either. and who is this knock off katy perry? (((even tho she sing better than katy...)))

**jess_22:** Gotye is the king of one hit wonders, I could have sworn that this song used to be better?

**patronsaintofaspies**: the music video is pretty cool. that's literally the only thing i like about this song

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD:** Kimbra is the only good part of this song sns

**nerfherder01**: It sounds like Sting singing songs for children. The way he emphasises "cuuuut me ooooff" is so irritating for some reason

**bwc222:** This definitely suffered from negative recency bias because it was VASTLY overplayed

**mustangs16:** this would have gotten my zero, but there is another song on this list I hate even MORE

**MrSwearword**: still sucks. Just no.

**angusaditus:** I can't stand this song, it's nice having something "different" doing well on the charts, but that's about all I like about it.

**lassidoggy**: By far the worst song on here.

I have something to say…


^So um this is probably an unpopular opinion but I much prefer P Diddys version yes its so corny its still its husk but none of you acknowledged it and I just had to drop that here. 

Ah a band that named themselves The Police is out. All T all shade, that name sucks. But the song is super catchy and slow, so people think it’s a love song. But once you look closer, that sweet tune your bae is whispering to you is actually a creepy stalker anthem and that is NOT what a genuine relationship is like so if you find yourself in this situation run like hell girl.^^too ^^real  But honestly I’m totally here for this [niche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDTZ7iX4vTQ) because im a sick fuck and [creepy/depressing disguised as positivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beINamVRGy4) is pretty interesting to me. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#EVERY SONG YOU MAKE….

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: Gotta love anti-love songs that are taken as love songs, this is probably the prime example and it's a little problematic, but what a great song.

**kioescport**: A bit creepy and the police have way better songs. Solid tune tho.

**timothy444**: Who cares if AskReddit thinks it's creepy, I find it romantic and a perfect wedding song! Also, this song bops HARD!!!

**eribertknows**: If you don't think about how fucking terrifying this is, it's a good song.

**clipeuh**: perfect line between loving and creepy. pure genius.

**Jelboo**: The way the guitar sounds in this song has always sounded so melancholic and sad to me. The whole sound is just sad, even when many people think it's romantic. It's about not wanting to let go, obsessing over a failed relationship. Fantastic song all around

**jess_22:** aside from the stalkerish lyrics, this song is perfect

**OxfordSemicolon:** I think one of the great things about this is that the instrumental lets people assume the song's not creepy (as it's known for) but still fits if you listen to the lyrics.

**skiddos:** when i listened to this as a kid, i never realized how creepy the lyrics were. the lyrics are horrendously creepy, yet i still adore the song.

**ffourthofjuly:** i stan the police and i grew up hearing this around all the time because the police is my moms favorite band. this song was always always always a favorite of mine, but as i grew older i appreciate the real true beauty of the instrumentals, the intricate layers; it seems like every time i listen to it i discover a new layer - the one note synth in the background, the bright piano notes softly playing in the background of the bridge

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: This is honestly probably the all-time height of new wave. Synchronicity is a fucking classic, and it's the textbook for the synthpop bands such as The Postal Services, The Knifes, and the Future Islands out there. It's surprisingly abrasive in its two very distinctive tones, and it's almost shocking when the song explodes into its passionate mid-verse/bridge (idk what to even call that). The outro is the perfect solution to avoid stagnation, and it's gonna be hard to convince me there's a better new wave song out there.

**enecks**: This is such a well-produced song. It nails the balance between intentional creepiness and still sounding incredible. It’s a classic. 1983 is one of the best years in music ever tho, so I’m not sure if even a song this good deserves #1. This was the year of Billie Jean, Flashdance… What A Feeling, Down Under, Beat It, Total Eclipse of the Heart, Man Eater, Maniac, Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), and that’s just the songs in the top 10. Real talk: Can our next whole year billboard rate be 1983? Good luck picking a 11.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#FUCK THE POLICE

**twat_brained:** I love the riff but the song doesn't really amend to much apart from that key change in the middle. Also, this is such a stalker anthem and somehow, it's been turned into a love song. And to top it off the song ends on a whimper. If not for that riff this would be far lower.

**eklxtreme**:  tbh this is the LEAST interesting police song

**camerinian**:  I’d much rather be ranking literally any other song from the 1983 year-end top 10 instead of this creepy stalker anthem which is not even remotely endearing, but like it sounds nice if you ignore everything in the lyrics I guess

**Magic_warlock0-**: I've always hated this song, just instills me with a creepy feeling. Hate the lyrics, the beat, everything drives me up the proverbial wall!

**Skyblade79**: why do almost all of the male sung oldie songs sound so creepy???

**wearingsox**: It gets in my head and makes me feel like someone is watching me

**dirdbub**: Filler.

**AbnormalPopPunk:** always hated this song, stalker vibes for watching every move i make

Jelboo: From Wikipedia:

Sting wrote the song in 1982 in the aftermath of his separation from Frances Tomelty and the beginning of his relationship with Trudie Styler. Their split was controversial. As The Independent reported in 2006, "The problem was, he was already married – to actress Frances Tomelty, who just happened to be Trudie's best friend (Sting and Frances lived next door to Trudie in Bayswater, west London, for several years before the two of them became lovers). The affair was widely condemned." In order to escape from the public eye, Sting retreated in the Caribbean where he started writing the song.[10] 

The lyrics are the words of a possessive lover who is watching "every breath you take; every move you make".
I woke up in the middle of the night with that line in my head, sat down at the piano and had written it in half an hour. The tune itself is generic, an aggregate of hundreds of others, but the words are interesting. It sounds like a comforting love song. I didn't realize at the time how sinister it is. I think I was thinking of Big Brother, surveillance and control.
— Sting[11]

Sting later said he was disconcerted by how many people think the song is more positive than it is. He insists it is about the obsession with a lost lover, and the jealousy and surveillance that follow. "One couple told me 'Oh we love that song; it was the main song played at our wedding!' I thought, 'Well, good luck.'"[12] When asked why he appears angry in the music video Sting told BBC Radio 2, "**I think the song is very, very sinister and ugly and people have actually misinterpreted it as being a gentle little love song, when it's quite the opposite.**"[13]

deleted: That's my point. Everyone thought it was a cute song (and it is, even if you know the lyrics are about a stalker) until askreddit users started convincing people it was an evil stalker anthem.

Leaf is doing this summary because I couldn’t manage to write one that wasn’t shady as hell


Do you remember the first time you heard this song? Well I don't, but if you remember 2011 at all, it was EVERYWHERE. You knew the words, your mom knew the words, that cute girl/boy in your English class knew the words and you would try to impress them by playing the song for them a-- uhh, getting sidetracked here. Ahem....smack-dab in the latter half of the club shit era, came this roaring, powerful anthem of a song from a singer WITHOUT autotune? Who was this? Give me back my LMFAO's and Black Eyed Peas, damn it. Oh, Katy Perry and Pitbull both had four songs each on the same year-end list. Remember when times were simpler? Dale!

---------------------------------------------------------------
 
#THEY SEE ME ROLLIN

**Ispilledsomething:** One of the most cathartic Billboard hits of all time.

**Albert_Cole**: I know it's cool to complain about Adele being for middle-aged white women and all, but this is legit an awesome song. If this doesn't make Top 5, I will be thoroughly displeased.

**veryunfinished**: Fuck, what an anthem

**angusaditus**: I don't like Adele, mainly cause she doesn't make enough songs like this, but damn, this is fire

**wearingsox:** Definitely a stand out from 21, finally some interesting material from Adele.

**Jelboo:** Adele is really extraordinary. Listen to this. The scope, the drama, the weight, the fullness, the vocals - and she was 21 when she recorded this. Clearly one of the best songs of the past few decades, and only Someone Like You surpasses it in her personal discography.

**Zamomattel**: Adele's best song, America has some taste

**calltehshots**: my favorite adele song. the melody, her vocals, the lyrics, the video its all a swift kick in the vagina and i love it

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: I need to stop throwing 10s around but I can't. This was a fucking SMASH in the US. I knew this was a megahit when I was at a party and everyone even the grandparents fucking knew every word. Fantastic song.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#WE COULD HAVE HAD IT ALL

**Magic_warlock0-:**  So boring, this is not a great song for Adele. She gets points for that strong voice, at least, but wake me up when she's done.

**nerfherder01**: I always liked Adele’s voice but I never got into her music

**skiddos:** Catchy but not Adele’s best

**lassidoggy**: Zzzz

**MrSwearword**:  I'll say this over and over; better Adele songs exist.

**PuggleMaster:** overrated and just plain boring

**superr_rad**: i will be dragged for this, but i never liked this song. im not a fan of 
adele to begin with, but i can at least tolerate her other songs.

**Skyblade79**: There are a few reasons for this zero. For one, I always found Adele’s voice to be completely intolerable. Sounds like a bullfrog. Two, she robbed Lights with this song back in 2012. That just ain’t working for me.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 
#SINCE YALL WONT LET IT GO

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: JUSTICE FOR LIGHTS

**patronsaintofaspies**:  yes, i'm still giving this a high score. no, i'm neither white nor a mother. also i swear to god if this gets to #1 again by some manner of sorcery this sub is going to burn itself down

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: Let this song win another rate please!

**twat_brained**: I just really wanna see this song go #1 in multiple rates and make the sub question whether or not our anthem should be “Rolling in the Deep” or “Run Away with Me”.

**ImADudeDuh**: IDC if she wins again, this song deserves it's 10

**ExtraEater**: This deserved to win the 2012 rate imo

**timothy444**:  I didn't participate in the 2012 rate but I hope this becomes #1 again for the lolz (or at least the Top 10)

**NapsAndNetflix**: oh look the winner of the 2012 rate I'm sure your score will be just as high and bitter people won't rate it unfairly low

**camerinian:** See 2012 rate, cbf ctrl + v’ing in my comments

**joshually**: You best believe every time Luda told me to “take that and rewind it back” and make my “booty go CLAP” I followed all directions fully and completely.
 
**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: will always remain Usher's best song
 
**Elitefourbrad**: Usher is literally Daddy and this is a great dance song for clubbing with Ludacris before Justin Bieber ruined him.
 
**ForretressArtillery**: kings of crunk
 
**HopelesslyEmoted**: Really wish one of Usher's better songs could've got a year end #1
 
**poppinmmolly**: This is a bop. I still hear this on semi regular rotation. It's that good. And still makes sense to be on the radio now.
 
**dirdbub**:  I subscribe to the idea that this song is the top song of 2004 that is a True statement
 
**vapourlomo:** This the prime intersection of crunk and R&B and pop. Can Lil Jon be on every song? OKAAAAAAAY
 
**noideawhatever**: the definition of a banger, this song just never gets old. if I heard it nowadays in a club I'd still bop hard!!!
 
**justdancegottabeok**: In what way can you describe a "bop"? Well, just play this and you exactly know what it means. This could be one of the best R&B songs ever made, in all honesty. Lil Jon did a sublime job with creating that iconic crunk inspired beat. This song brought Usher to the top of R&B, and rightfully so, because this song will be remembered in every dance club for all eternity. A masterpiece.
 
**camerinian**: This isn’t reeeeeaaalllllly one of Usher’s better songs but who the fuck cares this track still pops off every time and BIG DADDY JON IS HERE BLESS UP
 
**Albert_Cole:** HELL YEAH! This is the song I request every time I go to the club (like,
once a year). If this song doesn't make Top 5, I will be low-key pissed off.

**Inguss**:  Usher ushur ushut u shutup
 
**enecks**: What is this? Why did I give it a high score? None of this works. This inspires no emotion in me. All I know is that this is a 8 and Hey Ya is a 11.
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: would have gotten a higher score if the synth didn't sound really dated
 
**BlasifeelsSwift**: no, nope, no way, never, nah to the ah to the no, no, no insert meghan trainor video here pls thank you
 
**Hoolytoledo:** If the radio had not overkill this song throughout the entire last decade, I potentially would have ranked this song higher.
 
**mokitsu**:  this sounds so bad and dated....this goes off on clubs but listening to it casually NAH
 
**NapsAndNetflix**: I would never listen to this song if I'm like, alone in my room, but this goes off at the right time and place
 
**mustangs16**: Should this be given a higher score? Maybe. Am I still a little scarred from hearing it probably twenty times a day for a good year or two? Definitely.
 
**ffourthofjuly:**  i was never a fan of this song from the minute i first heard it on the dance floor of whatever school dance function came first. the only redeeming element is ludacris’s feature & im glad this rate exists so that i can express my opinion without being crucified apparently everyone feels really passionately about this song

0 (2): dirdbub, FuckUpSomeCommasYeah

And Mariah is out. She’s perfect, shes beautiful, she looks like Linda Evangelista, she’s a model ~~and her fans are fucking terrible~~. This is certainly one of her best songs, and its amazing how much traction it got considering its pretty slow. This was Mariah’s [second coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JX40zKSQTZQ) and [not many artists can say they outpeaked themselves in their 60s!](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0OWhacYLRCBJ0Adq/giphy.gif)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
#BELONGS

**eklxtreme**: this song has SO much nostalgia for me, from those beginning piano notes to the slow fade-out ending.

**Magic_warlock0-**: One of the greatest songs that I personally have ever heard! The queen belts out her desire to be with the one that she doesn't have, god YES one of my absolute favorite songs.

**cloudbustingmp3**: her SECOND decade-end #1. not everyone has that! truly an emotional masterpiece that has destroyed my throat several times when i try to hold that note at the end

**joshually:**  The song that deservedly relaunched the career of the most illustrious woman in all of pop music. WHO hasn’t been in a relationship and cannot relate to this song? It expertly straddles the line between nostalgic old school R&B and new school hip-pop, and that key change in the last chorus??? I lost my wig 12 years ago and I have never found it again.

**angusaditus**: this song came out around the time when my best friend went to boarding school and I was crying listening to this so much, I was so dramatic lol, I literally acted like he was dying. we're still friends btw

**Pugglemaster**: This is the song of my childhood. I also spent many hours lusting after Wentworth Miller

**joshually**: Is this perfect? Yeah, it is, from her vocals to that music video with Wentworth Miller

**Jelboo**: Okay so I very often throw shade on modern Mariah. That I find her new music dreadfully boring and lifeless. Same for this song, I just could not understand why it was so praised, especially in the light of many songs that came before. But recently I played this song loud on my best speakers and suddenly I get it

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: I am giving this song a 10 but I hope it doesn't bite my ass back when this song is doing much better than it needed to be.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#WE ARE NEVER, EVER EVER EVER, GETTING BACK TOGETHER

**themonkey**: never been a fan of this song sorry mimi stans

**vapourlomo**: (I don't like Mariah and this song doesn't change my mind I am so sorry please don't crucify me)

**NapsAndNetflix:** who is this ariana grande copycat???

**MrSwearword**: horrendously overrated and overwrought.

**therokinrolla**: I really don’t get mariah. I’m so sorry /u/joshually [+21] and mr. doxxer but all her songs sound so the same. This one is p good but I still dont get it, im sorry


#PRESST

**dirdbub**: I do Not subscribe to the idea that this song is the top song of 2005 there are least a Million better songs than this such as “Hollaback Girl”, “Gold Digger”, “Since U Been Gone”, “Mr Brightside”, “Beverly Hills”, “Feel Good Inc.”, etc. this song goes nowhere, I can’t tell what’s going on in this song, the theme/content of the song is so boring, the drums are mixed too loud in the song, the fact that one ear has louder high hats than the other fucks with me on a Personal level, the fact that the backing vocals have more presence than the actual vocals at certai times, I just Can’t with this song there’s nothing to be excited for in this song nothing leaves you going “oh Wow I can’t believe that happened” it just makes me want to not Be Here at All and it’s so bad I would cleanse my ears with the fucking Macarena after listening to this song because at least with the Macarena there’s something interesting going on in it such as How much I want to kill myself during that song like this song there’s just nothing it did not need to exist why does it exist its existance is unnecessary literally this song is so extra but in a bad way like none of this was Needed why was it number one of 2005 I didn’t even remember that it existed until this rate what a fucking Terrible year end number one god Damn

Queen of forever changing the way we say “to the left”. This iconic “pack your shit and leave” bop is on the incredibly underrated album B’Day, and is just one of the hundreds of songs in her discography about cheating[…](https://images.rapgenius.com/9e60ffcc8f9f5025e0511507f7ca3a49.575x563x1.jpg)

Nevertheless, I am so glad Bey got this far, because if we’re being honest, popheads loves to talk shit. But at the end of the day, the true bops rise to the top. 

--------------------------------------------------------
 
#YOU MUST KNOW BOUT ME

**AbnormalPopPunk:** AN ICONIC BOP !! INVENTED BREAKUPS !!! THAT SHIT GETS MY ELEVEN SO FAST!! i would be HONORED TO MOVE to the LEFT OR RIGHT FOR HER!

**Ispilledsomething**: One of the best put down songs ever

**veryunfinished**: who the fuck cheats on beyonce??? BEYONCE??? straight men really don’t know how good they have it

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy:** Imagine if Vine existed when this song came out, the "To the left, to the left" would be a huge meme, as if it hasn't already.

**Elitefourbrad**: Gotta give Bey a 10 for this bop about her kicking her man out, but it’s so damn satisfying.

**borpo**: My favourite Beyonce song.

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: invented moving to the left, democrats are shook

**Smoothbartowski**: man you must be living a really mundane life if you don't bop to this

**poppinmmolly**: this is the first Beyonce song I remember liking. It was on my Xanga page!! Do you guys remember that? I'm Old!!

**justdancegottabeok:** This song got me into Beyoncé. No bias here by the way, this score is well-deserved.

**therokinrolla:** this song was so much better with this re-listen, because it is one of those rare ballad-bops, with immediately iconic lyrics

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: This is my favorite Bey song not on self-titled or Lemonade. This fucking SLAPS. TO THE LEFT! TO THE LEFT! YOU MUST NOT KNOW WHAT I MEAN! YOU MUST KNOW WHAT I MEAN! DON'T YOU EVER FOR A SECOND GET TO THINKING YOU'RE IRREPLACEABLE! It's like the song has 3 fantastic hooks and they're all equally career-defining.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

#TO THE LEFT, TO THE LEFT

**Magic_warlock0-:** Jesus, Beyonce, how did this become a top song? I like the message, but nearly every other part of this song is grating and hard to jam to.

**TragicKingdom1**: I think the instrumentation in this sounds kind of weird and it isn't particularly catchy. One of Beyonce's weakest singles imo.

**mustangs16**:  I've never liked this song and now the Bey stans are gonna murder me

**eklxtreme**: the acoustic guitar kinda saves the song but the rest of the song just feels eh

**camerinian:** Beyonce’s first and most recent album are all you need to hear from her, everything else is just kinda ok

**ffourthofjuly**: this is when beyonce sucked :meghan:

**TheKneesOfOurBees**:  Not the best bey song. Hell it's not even in the top half of that album.

**BlasifeelsSwift**: meh, it’s not bad, but it’s not good, as usual with Beyoncé

**MrSwearword:**  There’s at least 30 better Beyonce songs but this is still cute

To no one’s surprise, Chad Michaels makes it to the top 10! Obviously popheads don’t care that she about to die or else she would’ve won. This is actually the first song to use autotune as a noticeable effect, so we can thank Lady Cher for paving the way for ~~atrocities~~ tunes like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO9cBXRcBvo).


 I…cannot #BELIEVE you guys let this slip out so early. This is of the best pop songs of all time. No memes, invented noticeable autotune. 

------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
[#SHAWTY, YEAH YEAH YEAH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GW1e6B1lFs)

**RandomDKGuy**: Invented autotune.

**misstututulle**: Invented autotune.

**timothy444:**  Autotuneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee lol

**berober04**: Too Much Autotune

**veryunfinished**: I love autotune!

**ffourthofjuly**: i love popping my pu$$y to cher in an autotuned kermit voice sounding 
like she’s floating thru space 10/10 slay queen!!!

**clipeuh**: autotune before the autotune fad. its robotic but fun.

**OxfordSemicolon**: Thank you, Cher, for inventing Autotune.

**cloudbustingmp3**: LEGENDARY AUTOTUNE ICON!

**skiddos**: queen of autotune

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: Can you believe that autotune was invented in 1999?

**noideawhatever**: behold the invention of autotune

**jess_22**: this borders on annoying, plus it popularised the use of autotune so points off for that

**Swaqqalicious**: that autotune...honey...

**patronsaintofaspies:** iconic for being the first song to use autotune. i legit thought cher was a guy when i first heard this song though

**twat_brained**: Why is this the Year-End #1 and not "…Baby One More Time"? Also why does Cher have AutoTune? It's already iconic, leave it that way!

**Elitefourbrad**:  Cher literally invented autotune with this song, and is still performing it at 71 years old. Queen of autotune reigns supreme.

**ImADudeDuh**:  Literally invented autotune, and that's almost not an exaggeration.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: Cher invented autotune, life, love, singing, being old, etc.
Albert_Cole:  Yeah, it literally invented Autotune, but there are dozens of songs after it that use it far better. But all in all, a fine way to end a century.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:**  Kind of a product of the time, the Auto Tune parts are really grating but when she's not using it, I can really bop to it

**camerinian**: Stans on this sub say things like this all the time, BUT CHER LITERALLY 
INVENTED AUTOTUNE WHEN WILL YOUR FAVE

**nerfherder01**:  I should hate this because it popularized auto-tune, but how can you hate a song with a line as iconic as “Do you believe in life after love”?

**justdancegottabeok**: What a brilliant and absolutely timeless song this is. Whether you like it or not, this song is a valuable work for the industry of dance-pop. Not to forget that this was one of the first commercial songs that used auto-tune, low key resulting in a revolution in the world of dance music. This song did something to humanity.

**vapourlomo**: ROBOT CHER!

**Skyblade79:** This is going to be an unpopular opinion but I HATE this song. There’s nothing redeemable about it at all. She makes her voice as ugly as humanly possible wit the autotune.

Look how far the old people have come! This is definitely the most recognizable Beatles hit. Maybe it’s the fact that half of the song is the same thing looped 8 times. [Repetition can be memorable.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkz6FyVP4Nc) There’s a long version and a short version of this, so if you’ve only heard the short version you’re not missing out because its just na na na na another 80 times. This was written by Paul Mcartney to John Lennon’s son Julian because Lennon was a piece of shit and didn’t father his son during the divorce from his mother. Yay for Daddy Mcartney! If you listen closely you can apparently hear Lennon say “fucking hell”, which [wasn’t edited out of the radio single](https://68.media.tumblr.com/90476bf3a823cb5f858b500ec5f0aa6a/tumblr_o6livvg8i11rzd9pfo1_500.gif). And if you’re wondering how “Jude” is doing, [he just recently released a song that sounds like something either of his fathers would release, so kudos for coat-tailing!](https://open.spotify.com/track/5P3Nq8KSSKm1syKcTBOFBQ)



----------------------------------------------------------

#GOOD JUDY:

**Clipeuh:** naa naah hey hey. the ultimate campfire song. everyone knows the lyrics.

**Magic_warlock0-:** Excellent reminder of the range that the Beatles can hit, definitely a killer song!

**Calltehshots**: we ~youths~ like to give the beatles shit bc the older generation is so far up their ass it's unbearable but they really did make some jams - this being a total classic. you turn up when you hear this shit.

**Dirdbub:** this is one of the first songs I willingly learned on the piano. I’ll be seriously saddened if this goes out quickly, as it’s literally one of the best songs in existence. The Beatles are seriously so good, I swear to god

**TheKneesOfOurBees:** The Beatles invented the modern pop song I could not believe it.

**Therokinrolla:** i thought this was very bland the first listen, but the vocals on this track are actually very very pretty. I appreciate ancient history, too

**Smoothbartowski:** this song never fails to make me feel emotional tbh

**Superr_rad:** ok basic but this is definitely one of my favorite beatles songs, its just so uplifting and catchy. and you can replace jude with dude to fit anyone

**Kioescport:** What is there to say about this that hasn't already been said?

**Napsandnetflix**:  This is one of the most iconic songs of all time, and deservedly so. Literally everything about it is perfect. The Na Na Na Nanananaaaaaa may be one of the best moments in music history.

**Vapourlomo**: Paul McCartney is my favorite Beatle (lame, I know), and this song just cements exactly why I love him: The man has an uncanny knack for the most beautiful, simple melodies that feel like they've existed for hundreds of years. And somehow, that outro doesn't feel too long. This song is pure magic.

**enecks**: If I could only save 10 songs from history as humanity’s legacy, this would be one of them. It has this beautiful universality to it. The best choice for the #1.

----------------------------------------------------------

#MAKING IT BAD:
 
**Blasifeelswift**: truly overrated, this is boring, I considered giving this a 0 but I don’t want the sub to hate me, also (sittin’ on) the dock of the bay was ROBBED, idk who is screeching near the end but please stop rn, holy shit this feels long af. I can’t believe my last.fm is now tarnished by this crap. This is not enjoyable. Shit like this is what /mu/ adores.

**Berober04**: I actually think this one hurts itself a bit without a big fuckoff stadium crowd na'ing along wow.

**Pugglemaster**: The vocals completely turn me off of the song. The yelling and screaming weren't the tea. This didn't need to be 6 minutes long

**Stansymash:** I live in britain, so my god is this song insufferable when its played like, every other day. all these nonces singing along when we all know deep in our heart its one of the beatles worst songs.

**Skyblade79**: I always found this song to be overrated. The bridge is just too noisy and I hate people who are like “this is teh only REAL good pop music.”

**Elitefourbrad:** I just personally have never really liked The Beatles and their style of music, even though I appreciate their influence on pop culture. The vocals are pretty great here, but I just can’t get behind the song enough to like it.

Albert_Cole: [Guess Kesha disrespected you then](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/30/magazine/kesha-lawsuit-dr-luke.html?_r=0)

> “TiK ToK,” she told me, was written to be more nuanced and more definitively ironic at first. But her producers and co-writers on the song, Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco, had to keep her image in mind. She says of Dr. Luke: “I remember specifically him saying: ‘Make it more dumb. Make it more stupid. Make it more simple, just dumb.’ ” She tried, joking around with some lyrics she found silly. “I was like, O.K., ‘Boys try to touch my junk. Going to get crunk. Everybody getting drunk,’ or whatever, and he was like, ‘Perfect.’ ”

> The problem was, she said, there was no balance. Every song was a song about partying, and yes, that was who she was, Kesha says that was definitely who she was, but she’s a real person having a complete human experience, and she wanted her album to reflect that. “To this day, I’ve never released a single that’s a true ballad, and I feel like those are the songs that balance out the perception of you, because you can be a fun girl. You can go and have a crazy night out, but you also, as a human being, have vulnerable emotions. You have love.”

I love Kesha, but Tik Tok is not a Kesha song. It's a Dr Luke song. Everybody here should feel bad (I mean, I still gave it 8.5, but you know what I mean)

The living rainbow herself, Kesha, has been eliminated. Her debut single, Tik Tok gave the world a bop for the ages and set up an image that pleased Dr. Jackass and his pockets. Apparently, the original version was more obvious that she is being ironic and playing a character, but the version released swayed the GP towards that “party girl” image. Kesha has come a long way since then, but her talent and kindness has always been here. She was the first full-on pop artist that I stanned, and she helped me through incredibly difficult times. Of course no human being deserves to be put through what she has, but Kesha has given the world nothing but positivity and love and for that, she will always be a /r/popheads favorite. We love you Kesha!
----------------------------------------------------------

#BLOW ME, SPEAKERS :TONGUE::

**Skyblade79**: What an iconic song. One of the first songs that I actully enjoyed. Sure, it’s super sleazy, but it’s such a fun bop. This was a push-up 11, but I still love it and I love it more for the album great music I found because of it.

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: my mom still sings the "po-po shut us down" line whenever she sees a cop car to this day; you can't ignore the level of iconic here

**therokinrolla**: YAS. I used to hardcore stan Ke$ha, and this song really defines why. So good, so bueno, so magnificent. 

**HopelesslyEmoted**: Signified/was part of a change in pop music at the time, love this song. Also here's a found haiku - Don't stop, make it pop//DJ blow my speakers up//Tonight, Imma fight

**MashLuke**: Invented getting drunk and being covered in glitter

**cloudbustingmp3**: trashy perfection

**borpo**:  I am too old for clubs and house parties but Kesha makes me want to do that stuff anyway

**AbnormalPopPunk**: A CERTIFIED BOP! QUEEN OF BEING TRASHY! QUEEN OF BEING A BAD INFLUENCE!

**whatyourheartdesires:** You can smell the glitter.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**:  Some of the autotune is grating and it was produced by a shitty person but I can't really say anything bad about that iconic ass hook

**bwc222**: This song will always hold a special place in my heart. I remember the first time I heard it and falling in love with it entirely. I went home and downloaded over 30 remixes via youtube because I was so in love with it! One of my favorite songs of all time!

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: Ke$ha's best song in an already flawless discography

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#NOT MY /R/POPHEADS:

**nerfherder01**: This was my most hated song of 2010. I used to hate hoe-pop, and I’m still not 100% sold on this but I appreciate the catchiness and the Nintendo-like sounds. Still, it’s a slutty version of Love at First Sight

**twat_brained**: I mean… it’s fun, but it never deserved to block “Bad Romance” from going #1, let alone blocking “California Gurls” from taking the Year-End #1.

**Mrswearword:** Meh.

**Elitefourbrad**: Ke$ha shines when not having her vocals covered up by autotune. This is iconic still, but it’s just not that great when compared to the rest of the field.

**Banananaise**:  my sister got really into Kesha after coming out as bi but her autotune in TiK ToK still makes my head hurt a bit

**gannade**: she's not really singing or rapping, and i'm definitely not bopping

**lassidoggy:** I know this is controversial, but Tik Tok was hot garbage.

**Jelboo**: Of all of Kesha's single in this era, this is my least favourite. The trashy image translates to a pretty average electropop song that chases after Lady Gaga's The Fame a bit too much

Albert_Cole: I'm going to reiterate because my comment didn't make it in:

> “TiK ToK,” she told me, was written to be more nuanced and more definitively ironic at first. But her producers and co-writers on the song, Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco, had to keep her image in mind. She says of Dr. Luke: “I remember specifically him saying: ‘Make it more dumb’ [...] I was like, O.K., ‘Boys try to touch my junk. Going to get crunk. Everybody getting drunk,’ or whatever, and he was like, ‘Perfect.’ ”

And the final Faith has left us. Congrats, George for not only making the list twice, but for both of your bops making top 10!! Everything about this era was iconic. This video, this song, burning the jacket, the EARRINGS I live for all of it. He actually came out as gay in 1998, but honestly we been knew. 


Artists like Prince and George Michael s h o o k conservatism and have played a major role in the acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. Even though we still have such a long way to go, us youngins will never know what it was like to be gay in the 80s… the horrors of HIV and the stigma that still surrounds it. [If you’re in the US and you are sexually active, know your status! Its surprisingly easy to get tested, I actually just did this morning](https://gettested.cdc.gov/). Of course, if you’re outside of the US, please get tested too. ((I will edit with links for as many countries as I can)) We are a community of love and hope and in order to lift each other, we must care for ourselves first.

----------------------------------------------------
 
[#KEEP THE FAITH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRudX8s1UwU)

**wearingsox**: Probably the most iconic George Michael single, as soon as you hear the chorus you’ll remember it for life.

**dirdbub:** this song is literally one of the best songs of all time, no exageration. I don’t care what you think about my taste after reading this comment, I will stand by the fact that this song and its depth is one of the best of all time no matter what. also: https://twitter.com/GeorgeMichael/status/68839852162035713

**justdancegottabeok**: The atmosphere of this song is oh so fine. His voice in here is amazing. Such a classic honestly, and definitely the runner-up for my 11.

**Ispilledsomething**: Bouncy, fun, and everything a pop song should be.

**TragicKingdom1**: One of the sexiest songs ever imo

**mustangs16**: the second best George Michael song. I was obsessed with this one for a brief time when I was an angsty teenager.

**twat_brained**: This man has TWO Year-End number ones? Make way, Paul! Careless Whisper is the more memorable one, though.

**eklxtreme**: irresistible melody + george michael's smooth voice = bop

**Look_A_Fangirl**: Best song here, hands down. This song will never get old and it is amazing.

**cedollete**: this was a really strong contender for my 11!!! MAN now i'm really sad i've never listened to more george michael before, i need to get on that ASAP.

**camerinian**:  I can’t believe how many 10’s there are in this rate, but this really is one of the all time great pop songs.

**veryunfinished**: that organ! good god i love george michael

**calltehshots**: this song just kicks ass, raises my spirit, makes my bank account flourish, and adds bounce to my hair.

**cloudbustingmp3**: turning a Wham! song into a funeral arrangement to open up the first track on your debut solo album is such a stunt queen maneuver and i live

---------------------------------------------------
 
#ATHIESTS:

**mokitsu**: this is cute....i'm trying to bop to it cause he was gay but it's not snatching me.....

**Jelboo**: It's kinda weird George is in here twice and Michael Jackson didn't get a song in after the pure dominance of Thriller and Bad. Anyway I like the album Faith but this song might be my least favourite song on it.

**Magic_warlock0-:** Ugh, not a very decent song in the least. Hate the beat of this.

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: This is almost too stripped down for me.
 
-------------------------------------------------

#DID IT ALL FOR THE NOOKIE:

**Dustinhaltom**: Iconic song and video. I wish I could forget Limp Bizkit's douchey cover of this song.

**johnazoidberg-:** Literally invented Limp Bizkit.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus:** The Limp Bizkit version would have gotten a 9 tbh

She didn’t Slumber Party her way to the top, but I’m still surprised Gangsta’s Paradise got this far. We are offisially /r/hippopheads! From the iconic sample, to the opening line that everyone knows, to the badass video with Michelle [Pfieffer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljfsN3UXv-0), there’s no denying this is one of the best rap songs of all time. Its also probably one of the cleanest rap songs of all time, thanks to Stevie Wonder, who refused to clear the sample unless the curse words were taken out. 

Also, Weird Al done did it. 

And I gotta point out, 

>Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
>I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
>I'm 23 now, will I live to see 24?


to remind yall that “Gangsta’s Paradise” is actually anything but..

-------------------------------------------------
 
#ITS PARADISE

**patronsaintofaspies**: Everything about this song is great, from the rap, to the chorus, to the choir in the background. It's a very foreboding song, and i appreciate that.

**jess_22**:  one of my proudest achievements is being able to rap this whole song

**dropthehammer11**:  One of the greatest hip hop songs fucking ever. Chorus is amazing, lyrics are dope, flow is on point, just so fucking great

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: One of the greatest hip hop beats of the 90s, I wish it didn't lowkey make me think of the Weird Al version though cause the original is so good. I especially love the background chorus on the hook, combined with the strings on the beat it gives the chorus such an epic feel.

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: A great storytelling rap song.

**carly-rae-sremmurd**: I will never forget that joke from I Love The 90s about how the guy singing the hook looks like that personifized image of the wind

**Skyblade79**: What an amazing rap song! The production is great, the hook is really nice, and the verses are very interesting and not super edgy.

**Albert_Cole**: Stevie Wonder's only writing credit on a year end #1 is for a song he isn't on. Which isn't a problem because this is far better than the one he is on. If this song doesn't make Top 5, I will be very annoyed.

**veryunfinished**: AS I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH. what an iconic opening line. where’s coolio now he just dropped this on us and disappeared

**stansymash**: OH ITS BECAUSE IT SAMPLES PASTTIME PARADISE I HAD NO IDEA. thats so wild man, i love stevie wonder and i guess i love coolio

**calltehshots**: the hook alone is a easy 10 and any music video that sits coolio across from michelle pfeiffer is instantly iconic.

**awryj:** I'm not into rap, but this is pretty much an anthem.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 
#NOT VERY COOL...IO

**therokinrolla:**  those verses are actually really bad looking back, but i definitely love that chorus

**RandomDKGuy**: "Keep spending most our lives Livin' in a AMISH paradise"

**Jelboo**:  Guys just so you know this chorus is a sample/interpolation of Stevie Wonder's Pastime Paradise. Which I like much better than this.

**TheKneesOfOurBees:** Weird Al did it better.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

#GLAD I COULD HELP!

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**:  I have been looking for this song since I was a kid wtf. Now I found it thanks to this rate!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
#CAN SOMEONE CONFIRM?

**camerinian**:  Can someone confirm if internationally it’s a common thing for this to be the only rap song that Adult Contemporary stations ever play? Like, not complaining, I just can’t believe that there are enough rap-loving baby boomers to warrant it

Hands down, one of the best [covers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDqqm_gTPjc) of all time. Dolly agrees! This is one of the few ballads that can be heard in a gay club at peak bop hours, and there’s never a silent person in the room. Probably the best key change of all time, probably the best long note of all time, Whitney really fucking did that. Pop music has an empty spot without her, rest in peace, queen. 

------------------------------------------------------
 
#AAAANNNNDDDD IIIIIIIII….

**Look_A_Fangirl**: If you don’t scream out the “AND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII WILL ALWAYS LOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEE YYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUU” you’re a fucking piece of shit.

**twat_brained**: It actually brought tears to my eyes listening to this and watching the video. This song has every right to be a Year-End #1 and will probably be the rate winner. And I would be so happy if it was.

**eklxtreme**:  i would give an extra point for some sort of radio edit that gets to the point and doesn't stay so downtempo for so long, but i really appreciate the uptempo highs

**tevinterimperium**: vocals untouchable. wig flew.

**superr_rad**:  literally fucking iconic like there is nothing else to say

**Elitefourbrad**: Iconic as hell! Whitney’s vocals are off the charts insane here, the best ballad music has ever had the chance to listen to.

**Swaqqalicious**: that key change slays my existence

**awryj**: Iconic voice, iconic cover.

**berober04**: Still one of the best 20 seconds in music history

**dirdbub**: Whitney Houston is basically the good parts of Mariah Carey’s discography but for the entire discography and that’s assuming that there was much good about Mariah’s discography

-----------------------------------------------------------
 
#AND IIIIIIIIII WILL ALWAYS turn off the goddamn radio

**mokitsu**: this is boring until she sings that "AND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIiiiiIiIiIiIIIII !!!!!!!! WILL ALWAYS!!! LOVE YOUUUUUUU!!!"

**kioescport**: Ouch.

**gannade:** i have nothing is better

**Dustinhaltom**: Whitney had an amazing voice, but this isn't a masterpiece like everyone makes it out to be.

**letsallpoo**: As a vocal performance, perhaps the greatest of all time. As a song? Not for me.

**TragicKingdom1**:  Whitney's vocals don't hide the fact that this is kind of a boring and generic ballad.

**MrSwearword**: Kill me later, but this song has overstayed its welcome and people need to let it GO.
 
----------------------------------------------------------

#WE CAN APPRECIATE BOTH VERSIONS, HUNTY

**Zamomattel**: Adored this until I heard dolly's which I think is miles better

**agentofscranton**:  when Whitney died I walked past my mum's room and she was just sat on the bed crying to this song, it was a beautiful moment until my dad shouted from the kitchen that he thought Dolly did it better

**BlasifeelsSwift**: #DollyPartonDidItBetterAndYouAllKnowIt

**Ispilledsomething**: Its over produced and super silly, but Whitney Houston has a fantastic voice that makes it better than it probably deserves. In the hands of a weaker vocalist, this would be a 1 (throwing no shade on Dolly Parton though).

**mustangs16:**  I'm giving it a ten but you know what? Dolly's version is still the superior version

**carly-rae-sremmurd**: I'd get crucified anywhere but /r/popheads for saying this, but I like Whitney's version better than Dolly's. they're both great songs, but totally different interpretations

**dropthehammer11**: Tied with Barbra for greatest all time pop voice

#OKAY, I CHUCKLED…

**ImADudeDuh:** What's Whitney Houston's favorite kind of coordination? HAND EYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYE

And George’s last year-end #1 is out. The sax, man, the sax!! This is credited as a Wham! song, but Youtube only says George Michael…hm. And the girl in that video? Hunny, you’re not fooling us. Doesn’t matter, this is an iconic jam and George Michael has serviced pop music well. I’m never gonna dace again…
---------------------------------------------------------
 
#YOU’S A SAXY CHICK

**misstututulle**: r/popheads loves a good opening sax line, and this should be no exception.

**Elitefourbrad**: Who doesn’t love this song lol? I mean how can you not love this song? The amazing saxophone gives it an insanely sexy vibe along with the whispery vocals from George.

**nerfherder01**: Holy fucking crap this song. If you know someone who says they don’t like it THEY ARE FUCKING LYING. The only song in the entire word that makes me overcome my singing shyness and I belt the crap out of it at karaoke. The epic sax, the emotion in Michael’s voice, the melody – all just fits together like nothing else ever will. The “Tonight the music seems so loud…” part is probably one of my favourite moments in pop music history

**HopelesslyEmoted**: This or at least the sax has been kind of meme-ified in the context of modern times but the melodies are great, the hook hits hard and George Michael's voice is incredible

**BlasifeelsSwift**: this song is sex, sex is this song

**joshually**: OMG YES THAT SAXOPHONE COME THROUGHHHHH AND ENVELOPE MY BODY I AM READY. Seriously though, GM is one of the best male vocalists of all time and this song is pure perfection.

**wearingsox**: This video has perfect 80s aesthetic minus George Michael having to pretend he’s straight. Excellent vocal performance.

**veryunfinished**: this is it!!! this is the song!!! even without the sax solo careless whisper has all the elements of a great song, so when u add it in… whoo boy!

**Inguss**: So kistch

**bwc222**: Will probably be crucified for this, especially on Popheads, but George Michael is vastly overrated.

**kioescport**: Good meme, OK song

**Swaqqalicious**: Sorry, as a saxophone player this song is the absolute bane of my existence. "HEY CAN YOU PLAY CARELESS WHISPER" no fuck you, and fuck this song.

**borpo**: The saxophone is just too much.

**themonkey_:** Goofy af to be honest. Wake me up before this song goes.

**lassidoggy:** The saxophones ruin it for me. It's extremely cheesy, and I'm lactose intolerant.
 
-------------------------------------------------------

#FILIPINOS CANNOT EVEN

**Doctorwhowhenhowwhy**: For many Filipinos including myself, we see this song very differently because this song was linked to a sex scandal of two local celebrities in in the Philippines. In 2007, there were two celebrities named Hayden Kho and Katrina Halili who participated in a local singing contest show titled "Celebrity Duets." They sang Careless Whisper together on stage. Two years later, a sex tape between them was leaked and holy shit the local media ate this up like crack. That's not the worst part. Cho is a licensed cosmetic doctor so this caused a huge uproar to the point Cho had to speak to the Senate and his trial was live on national television. His license was revoked as a result. Huge mess. I recall my Filipino best friend telling me that his father was annoyed that Careless Whisper was playing in the restaurant that he requested to change the song. End of the story. And oh yeah the song itself is great.

The only song with a worse reputation in the Philippines is "My Way" 


For non-Filipino popheads you all should know, the stigma associated with this song is still very much alive. Whenever this song plays it's pretty much a requirement for at least one person to do this sexy dance, even for just a second. Both parties involved have pretty much recovered from the scandal though, which is good for them.   


Also his name is Kho.

Well, we've made it. The number one and highest rated song in this long, long rate. We're all aware of the impact Purple Rain and it's singles had on music in the 80s and this song is no exception. Many consider it to be his magnum opus. The B-side to this song has a long name that would put mid-00s emo bands to shame. The entire title is "17 Days (the rain will come down, then U will have 2 choose, if U believe, look 2 the dawn and U shall never lose)". It's the longest titled flipside of a Hot 100 number one, with 85 letters and/or numbers. Who wrote that title? A sixth grader making his screen name on AIM/MSN? When Doves Cry managed to re-chart last April after his death along with a few others, notably Purple Rain at #4. Both songs are 1 and 2 in the biggest drops off the Hot 100 in history; granted they were re-entries but still the biggest nonetheless.

#GOOD NIGHT, SWEET PRINCE

**therokinrolla**: i like this so much more now than i did for jellybean’s rate wtf

**nerfherder01**:  Listening to the list chronologically, this is on a whole another level music- and production-wise. Also l I am aroused by the ways Prince sings “don’t make me chase ya”.

**Dustinhaltom**: Possibly the best song to ever hit number one on Billboard. One of my favorite Prince songs.

**borpo**: Most iconic keyboard part in music history.

**justdancegottabeok**: Come through with that experimental pop. Definitely the signature song of Prince. And damn, that looping beat is so addictive. That guitar at the end is a complete slayage.

**Jelboo**:  Cold, frightened, haunting, hypnotic, funky, trippy. A masterpiece from an absolute master at the top of his game, no more needs to be said that I haven't said before. Second place in the 80's rate and will end very high in this rate as well - I sense a top 10 at the very least.

**PandoraKris**: Never had a pop song that sounds colorful until this song exists. Dare I say, this song invented 80's synthpop. Whenever you hear a modern pop song that sounds 80s, I'd say Prince deserved to be credited for that. Not to mention that the SYNTHESIZER DROP. IS. ICONIC. Respect your #legend, people.

**OxfordSemicolon:** If doves crying actually sounded like this there would be professional dove depressers.

**cloudbustingmp3**: iconic. legendary. Immaculate.

**Skyblade79**: Hot take; the verses on this song suck. The lyrics are super cringy. However, that is all outweighed by the chorus and the amazing production. This song is legendary and one of my mom’s favorites. And I mean… that screaming isn’t a look… gotta remove a bit for that.

**joshually**: The most magical of songs…. What does it sound like when doves cry? Did you know this song has NO BASSLINE whatsoever? How amazing is that?

**veryunfinished**: ok but will anything ever top this...

**superr_rad:** prince is amazing and i believe he's the first PoC on this list so he obviously ended rasicm

-------------------------------------------------------
 
#NO, THE DOVES ARE CRYING

**Inguss**: Never heard this song before, and I'm more than ok with it

**Mudkip1**: Prince has better songs oops

**wearingsox**: I wish I was rating this higher, this song has never stood out to me as much as it does for others but I have so much respect for Prince and his impact.

**lassidoggy**: Is …. Is it bad to think that Prince is kinda overrated? Like, this is pretty run of the mill for 80’s music, sweet guitar solo aside

**awryj**:  It's... reaaally mediocre.

------------------------------------------------------------

I did not expect Blondie to make it this far but man am I glad she did!! Call Me is such a fantastic pop rock bop (say that three times fast..) and Debbie Harry is a gay icon. 

-------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
#HERE’S MY NUMBER:

**Kioescport:** Certified new wave classic how can you not love this. Giorgio Moroder tends to get the credit for this which is not undeserved but let's not forget this is Debbie Harry in fucking peak form here too.

**borpo**: I love that pop is kind of going back to the 80s, but we need to commit and get more guitar and keyboard riffs, this track is basically perfect.

**berober04:** Debbie Harry is a queen and this ranks up there with the absolute best production Moroder has ever done. Flawless

**dirdbub**: me whenever a hookup is good

**misstututulle**: Harry's vocals shine and soar across the tight instrumental. An iconic song from an iconic band. Did "Call Me" before Carly, with less uncertainty.

**vapourlomo**: Debbie Harry is the queen of new wave and it's insane that "Call Me," a song that is absolutely flawless, isn't even Blondie's best song (that would be "Heart of Glass," of course). More pop songs with random French lyrics, please!

**twat_brained**: How the hell this wasn’t the #1 song of the 1980s I will never know. What I do know is that this is song is nothing short of iconic, and if it doesn’t make it into the top 10 then this sub can choke.

**cedollete**: this is my first time hearing this song and omg, it's SOOOOO good!! the guitar riffs are excellent, the girl's voice sounds incredible, and it's impossible not to sing along with the killer hook of a chorus!

**veryunfinished:** yes bitch i’ll call u!!!

**atlastata**: This is a god-damned straight up banger. Perfect blend of 70's rock and 80's dance.

**calltehshots**: this song makes me wanna teleport to the 80s and do coke with rockstars so that's an instant 10.

**stansymash**:  heck YES. This song is gosh darn no holds barred fantastic and debbie harry is a goddess. there aint no world where i dont love this song, and you should too

**MashLuke**: This song invented pop music everybody.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: 1980s, WHAT'S UP?! This is probably the decade I'm most familiar with besides the ones I've lived in. Blondie is one of the most iconic artists of the era and it's obvious why. Call Me feels like a really nice transition between the more unrestrained vocals of the 80s in pop (thanks punk and rock) and the less synthy instrumentals of the decade that preceded it (although the synths are present here). It's also really sprawling and goes in a lot of different directions during its duration. Call Me has one of the best hooks of the decade, and it's almost tauntingly crafted with its 3:32 runtime.

---------------------------------------------------------------
 
#BLOCKDT

**lassidoggy**: It really isn't Blondie's best song.

**nerfherder01**: not my favourite Blondie song

**Elitefourbrad**: I can appreciate the vocals, it’s just I didn’t really like it as a whole.

**timothy444**: Overrated.

=====

Albert_Cole: More 11s though, and the lowest score is 5 (compared to When Doves Cry garnering a 1) I can now sleep easy

But I am thoroughly offended my comment didn't make it in, so here it is anyway:

> In August 1978, Blondie released the first single from Parallel Lines and invented music. In 1980, Blondie went on to invent sex. Debbie Harry turned me straight. If your parents had sex any time between 1978 and 1982, your dad was thinking of Debbie Harry - and so was your mum. Blondie came out of retirement in 2017 just to try and help lesser artists like Charli XCX and Sia be more relevant. If this song doesn't make Top 5, I will be supremely disappointed.
