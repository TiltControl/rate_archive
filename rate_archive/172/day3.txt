**pig-serpent** (8): This song sounds like a hit more than it sounds good.  Idk if that makes any sense, and it certainly doesn't sound bad, but I don’t think it has the real impact to feel like somebody’s favorite song.  Just scraping by into day 3 feels like the correct placement for it, and I would consider it accurately rated.  Good job raters!

**hikk** (7): The lead single for Dirt Femme, I was honestly kind of disappointed with it and I still don’t love it. I think it works a lot better in album context as an introductory track, but on its own I feel like it takes too long to build up and then doesn’t even end up building up enough to be satisfactory. This wouldn’t be a day 3 choice for me, so I’m fine with seeing it out now as our first cut of the day so we can make room for the three 10s that Tove has remaining now.

## Perfectly healthy individuals

**phonethephoenix** (11): an eleven runner up!! I love this song. the bridge really hits for me.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): rip an icon ❤️

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): This song is so good as an intro that every synth playing makes my anal fissure pulsate like an aching heartbeat.

**Ambrosia42** (10): has all the classic elements of a tragic and fantastic Tove Lo bop

**Aoquesth378** (10): Initially I didn't like this song except for the second verse. I thought it was overproduced, too much autotune, and it didn't land. But after hearing it a bit more I became obsessed with it all. It's a great lead single choice.

**Awkward\_King** (10): wow... just wow... cinema.. we come to this place for magic.. somehow heartbreak feels good in a song like this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Kinda want to see Tove snatch the win in this rate idk…

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the DRAMA the ATMOSPHERE the GAY ROBOT IN THE VIDEO

**Frajer** (10): Her mind is gonna be blown when she hears abour Romeo and Juliet

**imbaby122** (10): tove lo makes music for the insane and messy and dramatic girls.

**JIRACHI** (10): lowkey rooting for this to win even though i didn't give my 11 to this

**jman457** (10): A great little synthpop song

**notarobot3675** (10): i dont know a better song

**oscarbrierley1** (10): when the beat come in during the second vere??? it kills every time. she was right to not include the extra lyrics from the video, they clutter the song.

**plastichaxan** (10): I did but you see I didn’t die I had crystalized and now I’m a glamazon bitch ready for the runway

**reput4tionera** (10): werk

**Stryxen** (10): love this, was one of my fav songs over summer - a bit sexy a bit melancholy and “Guess I’ll be the first ¯\_(ツ)_/¯” is kinda werking its way into my regular vocabulary

**throwaway-7650** (10): ik I'm a part of the problem but this shouldn't be the last lead single remaining when ~~all~~ most other dirt femme singles >

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): lots of us die from loneliness though!! :D

**shipperondeck** (9.4): this could win (delusional)

**1998tweety** (9): cant relate

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): candace from you season 2 on netflix would disagree

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Great chorus! Kinda wish the music video version with the bridge was on streaming, it feels awkward without the bridge.

**ricki** (9): she hasn't of the love bomb

**sarcasticsobs** (9): The instrumental stretch from 0:55 to 1:10… I gasped…

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): what an amazing lead single. has elements of the album's main thumping club sound, but is still accessible and works perfectly as an opener

**UselessTacooo** (9): I’m still waiting for the extended version on streaming

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): love making a firm absolute statement and then immediately talking about how you're the one exception

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I guess the broken-heart syndrome is not a thing anymore

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): i remember hearing the 5 second clip of this every week on the popheads charts video until i finally listened to the whole song when the album came out

**akanewasright** (8): I’m a little surprised this was the big thing that propelled the era but it’s a bop so I can’t complain

**alexismateofan** (8): tove i just want to tell you that some people have war in their countries.

**beeozan** (8): she'll be the first in the rate too so true

**camerinian** (8): love how emo that chorus is, “nobody dies from love except for me i guess :(“ ok go off livejournal

**CrimsonROSET** (8): girl you’re too theater coded to not have read Romeo and Juliet

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): so true tove lo

**ImADudeDuh** (8): she really ate this

**impla77** (8): we love dramatic bitches

**queershoulder** (8): this song is just so catchy and memorable

**scythersboots** (8): so catchy

**sharts-n-farts** (8): when this single came out I was gagging

pig-serpent: ## Guess I'll die ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): i remembered when she released this as a lead single and was worried the album would be bland - but thankfully the rest of the album are mostly good :)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I love what’s there but I feel like it’s missing something? Like there’s a lot of build that doesn’t quite climax. But the music video is incredible, have to mention that.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7.5): solid opener but it did feel like it was building up to something and then didn't really go anywhere

**nick1372** (7.5): Does Tove Lo live in a world where people go around saying "no one dies from love" to her at like, Target or whatever?

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): Solid opener.

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i like this one quite a bit i just wish it went a bit harder or built up to something more to take it to the next level

**prettybirbkotori** (7): the chorus is very memorable but i wish the song had a bit more punch to it

**skeeturz** (7): this was a pretty nice album opener!

**TiltControls** (7): it's grown on me a little since the last time I rated it for Jukebox but that title line is still one of the clunkiest & corniest lines in this rate

**vayyiqra** (7): true ... ♀️

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): She’s so dramatic (like me)

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): just such a disappointingly underwhelming song. I generally love this kind of production and arp synths but the song just doesn't really go anywhere, I just want a big chorus please

**DrumBeatGlass** (6.5): Well what do we have here? A wasted potential. Same with Good Ones, the bridge is the best part of a song. At least she gave the good verses and decent lyrics here

**apatel27** (6): Good Hook. Bad everything else

**bogo** (6): it’s fine

**Nagisoid** (6): What about death by Snu Snu?

**moonshxne** (5): 🤷🏻‍♀️ I was about to criticize the reverb in the chorus, or how the synths drop out to highlight a really flat beat in the second verse, momentarily killing the song's momentum, but tbh, ultimately nothing particularly detracts from or enhances this. Just wish it lived up to its dramatic premise — unfortunately, I would **not** fuck a robot lover to this.

**shckskndv** (5): I like how fuzzy & hairy the synth backing is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): god this is so monotonous

**cremeebrulee** (4.7): it feels stagnant for its entire runtime tbh

**Raindrac** (4): This is really repetitive, and although the vocoder does sound good on her voice in the chorus, the hook isn't strong enough to justify the repetition. Seeing how it's a somewhat popular single of hers, there must be something that I'm not getting. But right now, I don't like it.

**welcome2thejam** (4): Dawg, people die from love all the time. Get out of here with this

**flava** (2.5): a beat so uninspired it’s almost aspirational

**runaway3212** (2): death from boredom

**hikk** (10): When I learned this would sample & interpolate Popcorn I was a little worried because although it’s cool for its time, nowadays I do feel like that’s just a dinky little synth tune that would just be funny in a song that’s trying to be serious. But somehow she made it work for me?? The melody of it works stunningly as a build up to the drop and I think the plinkiness of Popcorn itself contrasts against the darkness of the harsher synths in a really satisfying way. The intense dramatics of this relationship are fully sold here despite the worries I initially had. This is probably my fave on the album so it would have been nice to see it a bit higher, but I honestly can’t really complain about a day 3 placement because I was thinking the sample would be offputting to more people.

**pig-serpent** (10): I have a soft spot for pop songs that take older songs that are rightfully classics, but maybe haven't aged greatly in aspects like production or structure, and update them in a more modern style, not to replace them, but to pay respect to the past of music.  Popcorn, being one of the first electronic songs, is pretty aged, and Tove Lo did an amazing job of turning it into a 2020s pop song, and it's easily the highlight of the album.  This was the only Tove Lo song to ever be in first place (even if only for 5 minutes) and I fully expected it to be the top Tove Lo song (as it deserves) and especially feel like it should have cracked the top 10, but a few people were not into the interpolation, and given the current interpolation climate, I can’t really hold that against them.

---

##Movie Theater Butter

**Xaviersi** (11): This was the absolute BEST sample done last year and I will die on this hill.

**1998tweety** (10): she devoured this

**akanewasright** (10): the UNBELIEVABLE levels of cunt being served here… it’s like she owns the pussy factory

**Aoquesth378** (10): Ugh what a perfect song. It's catchy, uses a sample in a creative and unique way that doesn't feel lazy, and overall it's just perfection.

**Awkward\_King** (10): she so dramatic,, girl he just pretty

**beeozan** (10): an eleven if I was being more honest with myself but I want that 11 win with TLT tt

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I didn’t realize this was a sample until my roommate heard it from the next room over. Idk sometimes unoriginality slays.

**DirtyRat583** (10): crazy frog used this sample

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): obligatory popcorn comment - also her flower hat in the video is such a serve! besides that, the interpolation were used so well here, it’s a club banger what can i say.

**frogaranaman** (10): insanely good use of the sample

**JIRACHI** (10): this was my summer 2022

**kappyko** (10): Pop the corns feed the children etc.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this took a long time to grow on me but I guess popcorn is a brain eating earworm for a reason

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Oh lord this production

**sharts-n-farts** (10): The sample on this is hilarious but also such a bop.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): "you won't sample that popcorn song"

**throwaway-7650** (10): it works. [cuntiest beat drop of all time]

**UselessTacooo** (10): The Hit That Got Away

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): infectious

**camerinian** (9.5): absolute banger once you get over the slow creeping realisation that the sample is a Crazy Frog jumpscare

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): great pop song!!

**shipperondeck** (9.5): THIS is REAL pop(corn)

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): At her concert I wanted to post this song on my story but I only filmed the prechorus cause the Popcorn drop was slightly embarassing to show the straights

**Raindrac** (9.4): I've seen a lot of discussion about the trend of sampling and interpolating classic hits, the sentiment usually being that it's overdone and low-effort. But honestly? I love this trend. It gives many of my favorite hits of old a second life, a modern reimagining that might just begin a new renaissance. And that's exactly what 2 Die 4 did with Popcorn; it took a somewhat dated hit that I appreciated but didn't return to often and then turned it into a song that I want to listen to again and again.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): such a bop but that chorus beat sounds like a Nokia ringtone

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): stomped on most of charli's interpolations i fear

**DrumBeatGlass** (9): That's how you make a song. Amazing use of a sample. Where are more moments like this, Tove Lo?

**IIIHenryIII** (9): banger

**imbaby122** (9): i am the sexiest person on earth whenever this song comes on, tove lo is so powerful.

**modulum83** (9): trashy as HELLLLL (compliment)

**plastichaxan** (9): 🍿

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): See, this is how to do a tasteful interpolation.

**runaway3212** (9): this sample kills me every time

**shesdoingyoga** (9): something something sample something something Ava Max

**skeeturz** (9): oh i really liked this song it was cute and quirky

**static\_int\_husp** (9): the sample in this bangs

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Love the build and lyrical concept of this but the xylophone sounding drop is a little wimpy

**impla77** (8.5): This samples a song that was covered by Crazy Frog. I had not one, not two but THREE copies of the Crazy Frog Christmas album. I had this whole narrative about a robot factory and a princess who was kidnapped (??) as I performed to this album on repeat.. I’m assuming this was an original experience??

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): That sample is quite familiar and I've heard it before, it's also similar to Ellie Goulding's Time To Die. (the sample was in fact, that Popcorn song.)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): :flushed:

**ignitethephoenix** (8): her crazy frog slay

**just\_thonking** (8): Good use of the sample tbh

**Nagisoid** (8): I would rather have Tove Lo on the Die For You remix considering how much Ariana flopped honestly

**nick1372** (8): okay maybe the pop drop can work... I like how the drop is the same melody as the chorus that's fun

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): SEE this is how you sample an edm classic. Fuck you Bebe Rexha

**shckskndv** (8): my favourite Tove Lo songs are very intense. I’m so happy she took out the terrible extra verse from the music video.

**slimboyfriend** (8): I really only wanna hear this drenched in sweat on a dance floor at a warehouse race at 2:30 a.m. surrounded by dehydrated twunks on MDMA feeling each other up under strobe lights

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): one of last year's best pop songs and videos. the extended version is quite literally 2 die 4

**welcome2thejam** (8): Regret to say Neil Cicierega's Floor Corn poisoned me on anything that uses or will use this interpolation

**bogo** (7.5): would be higher if it had a better drop

**Leixander** (7.5): good use of the sample

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7.5): I like the sample use on this one, feel like it works well!

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): The sample is killer but I think it's carrying too much of the song.

**alexismateofan** (7): i could die for some popcorn right bout now

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the popcorn sample does not work on its own as a post chorus melody

**moonshxne** (7): *It works*. Actually, it works really shockingly well considering how nondescript the production sounds, not to mention that this song literally interpolates the same melody for the pre-chorus, chorus, and sampled instrumental drop!

**prettybirbkotori** (7): my neck 2 die 4 my legs 2 die 4 this uh uh sex 2 die 4 iiii want someone who thinks i’m 2 die 4

**hikk** (10): I think it’s really interesting to take a topic so deeply personal that is immensely difficult to talk about and pair it with synthy, dancey production like this. There’s plenty of songs about breakups or general depressed vibes that use this formula but this is the first time I’ve seen something like this and at first I didn’t think it would work, but something about the repetitive beat works really well to mirror how oppressive EDs are in their plaguing your everyday life. In the chorus the counting also works to contribute to this and it makes for a really unique but also heartbreaking track. I think it’s an important topic to talk about if people are able to and I’m glad Tove is in a better place now. As this song leaves though, we are left with just one track left for her. How Long can it last in the rate?

**pig-serpent** (7): The melody to this song is fantastic but the muted and weirdly dark synthwave instrumental does nothing for me, which given my dislike for how overplayed synthwave is, doesn’t surprise me.  There aren't any bright pink or neon blue synth stabs that cut through the dirty sounding bass line and as a result it’s missing the mark for me by a lot.  That said, I still  think it landed in a fairly reasonable spot but given some of our recent robberies and the fact that it’s Tove Lo’s second highest rated song, it’s hard for me to not walk away feeling like this song is just a tad overrated.

---

## Actually eating disorders are no laughing matter so no funny titles out of respect.  I hope everyone suffering from an ED gets the help they need to start eating healthy.

**jman457** (11): Just a great sad bop, with a chorus that builds so well

**akanewasright** (10): there’s so much praise I could heap onto this song, but lemme just say that this chorus is nothing short of brilliant. Like the double meanings of all the counting is just so clever. Even if it’s just a layer of detail for her and her devoted fans, anyone can tell from her vocal performance that every second of the lyrics means a lot to her, and it adds a lot to the song

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (10): yeah

**Aoquesth378** (10): A career highlight that speaks volumes. This song speaks to me on a personal level and it does so in such a catchy way. Almost took my 11…

**beeozan** (10): a song that will hopefully do better than Harry Styles

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): man i cried the first time i heard this because i wasnt expecting it anyway someone link the grapefruiting video PLEASE

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is incredible but i can't stop thinking about how i went into it thinking it was named after the grapefruit technique

**Frajer** (10): tw ed I am so glad she's in a better place and able to be a body positive sex positive queen

**RandomHypnotica** (10): man, I just wanted a bop about deepthroating a citrus

**ReallyCreative** (10): the grapefruit technique is a necessary shitpost for this song tbh

**runaway3212** (10): She didnt have to end so much

**seanderlust** (10): it's a delicate balance to approach such a sensitive subject in the form of dance pop but tove really sticks the landing here.

**throwaway-7650** (10): 7... wait 7 is 2 syllables that's why she stopped counting at 6

**TiltControls** (10): wait hikk actually make that 3 11's

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): a smash about body dysmorphia

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): ed stands for everybody danced

**camerinian** (9.5): well thank fuck I went to genius.com before slagging off the “nonsense chorus” like I was ready to

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): she really aced making a song about having body dysmorphia but making it a bop

**imbaby122** (9.5): oh god this song is so visceral like i need to scratch and claw and rip out of my skin.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): My fat ass screaming to this thank you Tove

**ricki** (9.2): this goes after fiona apple - paper bag on the ED playlist

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (9): Fucking killer.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this is great, and it has the same title as that Harry Styles song that I like, but this is a mile better.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): this on is just gut wrenching

**impla77** (9): This is such an important song, we love you Tove!! <3

**Nagisoid** (9): I'm grateful grapefruit at Tove for making this song, very nice message

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): the swedes must have some gay genes in their DNA to be able to make songs like this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): personally all i can think about when i hear this song is the Grapefruit technique lady slorping down in the video

**wasian-invasion** (9): a heartfelt song about body issues. whole time i keep thinking about the blowjob technique

**phonethephoenix** (8.8): I really like this one!

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): seven, eight, mississippi

**nick1372** (8.5): what is the point of the counting in the chorus... is it supposed to be counting calories? does Tove not eat anything more than 8 calories?

**queershoulder** (8.5): iconic

**uberpigeon** (8.5): every single person being suprised when this song wasnt about grapefruiting your man she really subverted expectations!

**AHSWeeknd** (8): thinking about that video…

**bigbigbee** (8): I appreciate this song a lot as someone who’s (like many of us) had a few cute lil’ body image issues at varying points in my life…I don’t even really resonate with the lyrics / her own personal experiences, but I just think it’s cool and important that she’s talking about this, since I think that so many celebrities are trained to give off the impression that their thinness is effortless, natural, etc.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): see everyone this is why we always read the lyrics before making comments about possible dick sucking techniques

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): the lyrics of this are very heart-wrenching - i just wish it were a little more interesting sonically! but i obviously appreciate it for its message.

**Leixander** (8): ❤️

**prettybirbkotori** (8): this is great i will never listen to it again

**shhhneak** (8): I’m glad you beat that ED and are here making music for us :)

**UselessTacooo** (8): oh

**vayyiqra** (8): before reading the lyrics I was going to make the lighthearted comment "I love grapefruit! I am grateful for it" (Björk reference) but after reading them yeah no this song is not something to joke about I hope Tove is okay ♀️

**scythersboots** (7.9): idk i appreciate the sentiment, i do think we need to talk about this more, etc., etc.

**shipperondeck** (7.8): its good but it has not really hit for me yet

**moonshxne** (7.6): i actually just love the taste of grapefruit 😭

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**JIRACHI** (7.5): interesting

**DrumBeatGlass** (7.2): Lyrics are fabulous, I feel really sorry for Tove Lo. Synthpop shines here, but could've had more elevated production

**sarcasticsobs** (7.1): Like, this instrumental is "good" to me, but also I'm kinda real tired of it?

pig-serpent: 
**alexismateofan** (7): the vibe is good??? I mean its not fantastic but its like good.

**bogo** (7): i wish this had better production/melodies cause the lyrical content is very emotionally strong and affecting but idk the rest of the song isn’t quite there

**shckskndv** (7): I love the lyrics but as someone with experience with the subject matter I wish it was given a grimier instrumental

**Stryxen** (7): bop!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): quite depressive and affecting, but still a full-on dancefloor filler. who else but a scandinavian pop girl!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): So who's gonna complete the trinity of pop divas naming songs about eating disorders after fruit?

**cocosairdep** (6): great message but kinda repetitive and boring

**Raindrac** (6): This is almost as formulaic as electropop can get. The short synth hook is the only thing that I remotely care about here.

**reput4tionera** (6): this is too triggering i skipped sorry

**skeeturz** (6): it's a cute song but it didnt particularly stick out to me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i mean i gotta give her credit for singing about such a deeply personal topic but im getting so tired of this album’s sound already and i’m only on track 5 😭

**apatel27** (5): do i need to explain every song on this album is extremely forgettable

**oscarbrierley1** (3): this song has suffered from spotify shoving it down my throat. i liked it when i first heard it, but it felt like it was always the second song to come on shuffle and i grew a resentment to it. its just so serious it makes it uncomfortable to listen to.

**pig-serpent** (11): This song was a hard sell for me at first, being both the first look at Charli's new direction and being blatantly reminiscent of an older smash hit, but the music video absolutely mesmerized me and I had it on constant rotation regardless.  Around the time I heard this in a Target and had the sudden urge to start body checking the nearest clothing racks, I decided that it has 11 energy, and the rest is history.  Obviously I’m disappointed this couldn’t make the top 10 but I wouldn’t say this placement surprises me either.

**hikk** (10): This is nothing novel for the genre of pop but Charli claimed to be making a sellout pop album and this is evidence that just because something is basic and not at all unique doesn’t mean it’s bad! In fact, this is quite great imo, catchy beyond belief in both vocal and synth hooks.   A great lead in to the era, but although I did give this a 10 I think there’s probably other songs I would prefer to see in day 3.

---

## The Good Ones

**ignitethephoenix** (11): honestly may be my all time favorite Charli song. This should have been a hit!!!

**skeeturz** (11): the stranglehold this damn song had on me from single-release to album-drop to current-day is insane, incredibly catch and infectious, absolute charli perfection

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): Absolutely killer and her hair for this song was a cultural reset.

**\_alien-superstar\_** (10): Good song

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This song really got me into Charli, but kept me in the Crash era cause she doesn’t regularly do this 💀

**akanewasright** (10): insert “you’re serving cunt at a funeral?” tweet

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this magnificent song should've been a hit, considering it's length, sound and catchiness, but to be fair, I wish it was longer.

**Ambrosia42** (10): SMASH!!!!

**camerinian** (10): the one undeniable slay of this album cycle. A simple concept executed brilliantly

**cremeebrulee** (10): she was so wife for this

**DirtyRat583** (10): i have listened to this song 208 times idk if thats a good or bad thing

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): a bop

**IIIHenryIII** (10): banger

**Leixander** (10): AND BABY YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ME ANY BETTER

**Nagisoid** (10): This country divorcees anthem...

**oscarbrierley1** (10): it being so short worked when it first came out because i would just listen to it on repeat, but now it leaves me wishing for it to be longer. its still such a galactic slay tho

**phonethephoenix** (10): it's a good song

**plastichaxan** (10): So glad we are rating this after I overcame my trauma of listening to this nonstop since I used it for my first performance in drag ever

**queershoulder** (10): i especially loved seeing the UK drag race girls in this video, RIP Cherry Valentine

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's cunt you either get it or you don't idk what to tell you

**reput4tionera** (10): the cuntiest song on the starbucks coffeehouse pop corporate playlist

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the definition of a grower, and the music video amplifies the slay

**saviorARMY101** (10): BANGERRRRR

**seanderlust** (10): this is my second most scrobbled song of all time it is getting a 10 at least

**thatplatypus99** (10): this was almost my 11 because of the opening synth alone

**uberpigeon** (10): omg they made the funereeling into a real song

**UselessTacooo** (10): she opened the era with a serve and a quarter

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): one of the best jogging songs of all time methinks

**alexismateofan** (9): kind of a banger if i’m being honest like i might be jamming to this for a while.

**Aoquesth378** (9): Idc if it is her sellout era she can sell herself out all she wants if bops like this are the result

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The Really Really Good but Not Quite a 10 Ones.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): alexa play the funereeling

**sarcasticsobs** (9): GO-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH

**welcome2thejam** (9): Too danceable

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): okay this one still suffers a bit from both "song too short" syndrome and "this played like 3-4 times a shift at Target" but it's still a fun lil bop so i cant hate it, im just fatigued

**Raindrac** (8.7): I remember when Good Ones initially dropped. Caught up in the hype on Discord, I watched the video on the hour that it dropped and became obsessed with the song. Replaying it 30 times in just a couple of days, I thought it was going to go far. And then I just... stopped listening to it. Months passed before I even returned to the song. Ouch. But despite how it's not captivating enough to encourage me to revisit it, Good Ones is still one of the most catchy and entertaining songs on Crash. I love it whenever I play it. It's a shame that it's so short, maybe a great bridge is what it really needed for it to have a lasting impact on me.

**jman457** (8.6): I wouldn’t be mad at this being charli’s first rate (but it should have been Track 11)

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i want to hate it but i cant

**bogo** (8.5): the title reflects the quality of the song

**imbaby122** (8.5): haven’t had a heterosexual thought since i saw charli in this music video. please kill me and hump my grave charli i’m begging.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): i want this level of choreo at my funeral

**shipperondeck** (8.3): im also kind of tired of this but i also know all the lyrics so

**impla77** (8): A nice guys origin story

**ktajlili** (8): I didn't like this at first. I thought it sounded so bland but it's actually great, especially the production. It's definitely a great choice for a lead single and really helps introduce her more palpable sound.

**ReallyCreative** (8): I overplayed this one I fear but I'll give her the flowers she deserves

**runaway3212** (8): maybe she never needed to be high brow

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): when she said “i let the good ones go” she was referring to her ability to make good singles

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I heard this in a Target once so I consider that a success! Good job Charli!

**JIRACHI** (7.5): i thought this was kinda cute idk...

**TiltControls** (7.5): I like this song, but honestly it's kind of giving me a headache right now

**beeozan** (7): the chorus reminds me of a LMFAO song which is not a bad thing but still I’d rather listen to LMFAO

**bloodjet** (7): the buildup was great but the gooo in the chorus gets tired real quick

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7): I don't dislike this but definitely the weakest single imo

**prettybirbkotori** (7): this is 100% gonna get overrated bc the gays were just starved for new charli. it’s still good though

**shckskndv** (7): oooooooooooooooooooooo-oooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooo-oooooooooooooo

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): idk something about this one never quite hit for me. goes hard live though

**scythersboots** (6.5): just the right length for this song

**modulum83** (6.2): this is like a song a tv show about a fictional popstar would use

**DrumBeatGlass** (6): Well, you cannot do much in 2 minutes. Missing one big chorus that would tie everything up. The lyrics are okay, I guess. This song misses other moment like the magnificent bridge

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): sellout era is right because this is literally a tiktok song… like this had so much potential for a good bridge and all we got was that

**jasannn** (6): ngl, the popheads charts videos made me dislike this song more than I should.

**apatel27** (5): A blatant attempt at a radio hit that failed miserably.

**Stryxen** (5): this was the final song charli played of her encore when i saw her live and i left during to throw up (unrelated)

**moonshxne** (4.6): if only the song was actually complete. then the wail of the chorus might actually mean something

**nick1372** (4): LEAVE THE POP DROP IN 2017 WHERE IT BELONGS!!!!!!!

**kappyko** (3): Alright pull up the "more like BAD ONE" comments

**vayyiqra** (1): One of the most boring and underwhelming Charli songs ever! Not good! In one ear and out the other every time. 🚘

**thedoctordances1940** (0): I have absolutely despised this song from the moment I heard the teaser I just hate the sound of these synths and structurally the song is just not doing anything, it's a song written around one little soundbite and that soundbite sucks

**hikk** (10): This is such a smash and I definitely agree with it being an album highlight. It manages to take some notes from Charli’s more experimental work and blends it with the full on pop vibes and the result is very much a bop. The chorus gets stuck in my head all the time and I love the transition into it from the more low key opening section. With the loss of this song Charli is now down to just one remaining track… as are both Tove and Rina. The three of them have five Carly tracks to fend off, can any of our heroes pull through??

**pig-serpent** (8): It's very obvious why this is a fan favorite, and I really wanted to give it a 10 because of the winner potential I thought it had (lol), but this song just doesn't hit for me the way it should.  It's a great song, but it doesn't boom in the way lightning should, and seeing it live proved how much better it can be.  Another Charli song that spent a decent amount of time in the top 10 but you can see the exact moments it got tanked in the graph.  It’s rough that this couldn’t even make the top 10 with how much support it was getting, but at least Charli still has two songs in so she’s not getting HIFNed again.

---

## Heartbreak already hit them once.  They are now immune to heartbreak!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): this song is soooo magnificent, like it made me speechless at first, definitely one of my favorite songs from her discography so far and it keeps me up at night asking, why is this NOT the lead single?

**oscarbrierley1** (11): immediate stand out of the album from first listen. a great balance of being catchy and easily digestible while still having weirder sounds thrown in. the vocoder part scratches my brain and the flamenco guitar solo is so random and so fun.

**queershoulder** (11): just so so good and it also me an my husband's number one song from crash

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it took me forever to realize she also says “blinded” in this. The British accent was accenting

**akanewasright** (10): this opening her show was a MOMENT

**Ambrosia42** (10): epic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t care if this song is kinda a mess. It’s a GREAT mess.

**bloodjet** (10): charli is a master of sad bops, this one's no exception

**buddhacharm** (10): Charli performing this in the Gossip Girl reboot right after they announce that one of the main character's girlfriends is fucking her own brother... literally one of the most surreal moments in recent (bad) pop culture

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the vocoder in the prechorus makes me lose it every time like yes girl give me drama

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the best song ever made

**jay** (10): LOIT NIN.

**JIRACHI** (10): kinda overrated within the fandom but woah...

**Leixander** (10): SO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT AND I'LL BRING IT TO YA

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): don’t ever think that you’re that girl but you still ate that little one thing

**plastichaxan** (10): HEARTBREAK ALREADY HIT ME ONCE THEY SAY THAT IT WON’T HAPPEN TWICE??? HELLO?? I have to scream that everytime

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): This is such a great tune. Should've been made a single.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when im playing breath of the wild and a fucking storm starts

**ReallyCreative** (10): me after purposefully driving backwards in Mario Kart

**reput4tionera** (10): im obsessed

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): everyone is doing 80s pop these days but Charli managed to make it sound fresh again

**sarcasticsobs** (10): The vocoder had me do whiplash, then those synths are went right ahead stabbing me in the ear and I live for it all

**skeeturz** (10): another incredible banger up there among my faves on the album

**uberpigeon** (10): a well placed vocoder can be so life changing

**welcome2thejam** (10): I can feel it! The power of an absolute top tier smasha coursing through my veins!

**prettybirbkotori** (9.5): best song on the album easy queen of electricity

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): The bridge is a bit too drawn out in my opinion but otherwise this is a 10

**UselessTacooo** (9.4): this is so close to being a perfect song and then the random Spanish guitar comes in and deducts points

**apatel27** (9): Why couldn't the whole album sound like this

**imbaby122** (9): you’re not gonna get the song the first time you hear it (spanish guitars wtf?) after the 2nd and 3rd time, you’re gonna be like “whoa, what is this?” (omg epic synth pop revival)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): could it be? a song on this album that actually sounds like the charli i know and love? i thought it would never come!

**thatplatypus99** (9): this song is a tad bit overrated but still good

**vayyiqra** (9): Good track! 🚘

**shhhneak** (8.7): and not one g in the word lightning was enunciated.

**camerinian** (8.5): I kinda don’t think the hook is very good but holy shit Ariel is going hard on this production. There are so many cool details and tricks going on in the background that you don’t notice until a few listens in

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.5): So much here screams True Romance. From synths to the cute lyrics. The inclusion of the flamenco guitar was genius

**seanderlust** (8.5): this probably took the longest to grow on me but it's such a little oddball 80s pop track i can't help but love it

**kappyko** (8): You fucked me dow

**Nagisoid** (8): As a Floridian, I feel so represented in this song 😳

**phonethephoenix** (8): not my fav glitchy Charli but I still really like this song! it was a great tour opener

**shckskndv** (8): so many opportunities for death drops in this song

**wasian-invasion** (8): this feels the most hyperpop-adjacent song on the album (which isnt really saying much) i kinda love how she just throws everything into the mix

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): I love everything about this new order ripoff except for that SPANISH GUITAR

**jman457** (7.8): Blame it on your love if it only sold out a little

**bogo** (7.5): the synth fuckery in the bridge of this song derails it a bit but the whole thing comes together nicely

pig-serpent: ## Turns out Heartbreak does strike twice

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): A bit of a slow start but it when it hits, it hits.

**alexismateofan** (7): some weird shit going on before the booty bumping chorus

**Aoquesth378** (7): It's good but I don't think it's great. I love shouting 'you struck me down like lightning' though.

**cremeebrulee** (7): i once played this album for some friends and they all agreed this was the stand-out track which was... interesting. i don't really agree but it's not a bad track

**CrimsonROSET** (7): can i propose electricity for the bumper track

**just\_thonking** (7): Stream bizarre love triangle best song of all time

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Ooo sparkly

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.2): this is a bit catchy i fear but it's still not very good

**dreamingpastel** (6): Good ideas all around, but as a whole it's a bit disjointed

**Stryxen** (6): this was so so so amazing live but i haven’t been able to enjoy it that much before or since. It was like something in a bottle ugh what’s that saying

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): i do like this song, but not as much as everyone else seems to lol

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): frustrating song because it could be really good, the robotic production elements work quite well for the most part (although towards the end they are used a bit too much), the synths sound pretty good and yet the hook just gets boring so fast

**ImADudeDuh** (5): does anyone else remember when this had a very small viral moment

**runaway3212** (5): this song also does like so little

**Raindrac** (3): When I saw that this was the highest rated song on Crash at rateyourmusic before listening to the album, I expected this to be one of her best songs since Vroom Vroom. After all, if it's the best song on the album, then it would have to be better than my favorite single, Good Ones. But... nope. Not at all. The pre-chorus is good, but that chorus is repetitive as hell and the rest of the song doesn't have much else to offer either. The autotune and vocal manipulation doesn't add much to the song either, sounding like it was added just to pander to fans of her hyperpop era. Because of that, it lacks the same effect.

**beeozan** (2): this is like hyperpop in that it sounds horrid but the difference is I can’t understand what’s the intent here

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): it’s just too much for me

**frogaranaman** (0): sorry Tiktok gays ruined this one for me

**hikk** (10): This is a bop idgaf, it may be corny in its lyrics but sometimes we just have to accept a fun little pride parade anthem! Let loose (i said let loose) for just a few minutes and scream out FUCK WHAT THEY DID TO BRITNEY TO LADY DI AND WHITNEY you’ll feel so much better!! It also kind of rubs me the wrong way for people to call this “pandering” because that kind of erases the fact that Rina is queer herself. The song itself is so catchy through its entire runtime and although sonically I would say it’s a step down from the heights of Sawayama, I was still left excited for what was coming after this upon its release. For a while this was floundering a bit more here but near the end it managed to work its way into the top 10 which is fine by me. Now, however, Rina is left with just one song left, and it’s my 11! Can Frankenstein pull through against Tove, Charli, and 5 Carly songs?

**pig-serpent** (0): It's hard to pull off the confident, in your face cool swagger to sell this kind of song, and unfortunately Rina's vocals don't pack enough of a punch for this song, especially compared to something like KKB’s Lipslap, which I think has very similar energy at least as far as vocals are concerned.  On top of that, the hook is terrible and the “ohs” (That kind of sound like “Gimme Gimme Gimme” tbh) are the most annoying thing in this rate.  And if that wasn’t enough, the instrumentation of this song sounds like someone microwaved plastic until it began to melt.  This song is an utter disaster and made me expect the worst for this album when it was released as the lead single. 

 I knew this would be a popular song, and I was content with it sitting around 20 like it was for most of the rate, but right at the end it jumped up into the top 10, and I am immeasurably disappointed that this song didn’t have a few more tankers just to keep it where it was (or heck, lower it down further like it deserved.)  Anyone who voted this song rate villain is correct and gets a thumbs up from me.

pig-serpent: ## These rates are better with them

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): Absolutely loved this one ever since it came out. Great tune.

**Raindrac** (11): After having been told that I'm going to go to hell by religious fanatics for years, hearing a song that dismisses those insults by playfully embracing them feels so revitalizing and validating. That's my favorite way to respond to those people: Embrace how they believe that we're going to hell, accept our status as the enemy and walk away while they're astonished. It's fun, and the look on their faces is priceless~. I'd much rather spend my time with my fellow heretics than conform to the expectations of those morons. This hell is better with you! 



 And although not remotely country, the production is lightly seasoned with the vibe of a rural outlaw bar on a busy, alcohol-drenched night; it's a unique aesthetic that really helps distinguish it from sounding like a mere Born This Way reject. And speaking of Born This Way... wow. There are so many elements of Hold The Girl that remind me of Born This Way that I've got no doubt that she was inspired by it; the eccentric look on the cover art, the motorcycle sound-effects at the beginning of Hold The Girl, the specific style of the production and dance beats, the influence from LGBTQ culture, and, uh... the muddy mixing, which is a little unfortunate. But out of all of the songs on Hold The Girl, it's This Hell that reminds me of Born This Way the most. And I mean that as a compliment— it replicated the magic.

**shesdoingyoga** (11): There’s just something about screaming along to this song with friends that meant I had to give this my 11

**akanewasright** (10): I’m not gonna pretend this isn’t silly as hell, but like… idk we can use another silly pride song!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): One of my classmates was bullying me so I sang this song in front of our room and he called me the f-word and he stopped being a cunt to me.

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): Listening to this song for the first time made me unlock the memory of Westboro picketing my high school!

**Ambrosia42** (10): the yas slay mother lake gaga song but like, it’s truly pop perfection

**Aoquesth378** (10): Love this song, a perfect lead single still stuck in my head to this day.

**Awkward\_King** (10): f*ggot oop... queen

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yeehawphobia…I fear it comes no matter how yassified you are.

**bogo** (10): the gay anthem we all needed

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): no sorry my little oklahomo ass will NEVER hate this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): see holy til you let me go but this makes it cunty

**Frajer** (10): looking camp straight in the eye, the let's go girls, fuck what they did to Britney to Lady Di and Whitney, the Gaga influence it all works and slays

**lordofthepotat0** (10): wow, thats hot

**phonethephoenix** (10): let's go girls! my eleven runner up.

**plastichaxan** (10): Maybe y’all need to drive to this song that’s how it hit for me

**reput4tionera** (10): its something fun for the gays let her live

**ricki** (10): she kinda set herself up with this as a lead single but there’s nowhere to go but down after releasing this

**seanderlust** (10): Don't even lie to me PH this is delightfully camp and an easy 10

**skeeturz** (10): despite the song feelin a little out of place it's very enjoyable and fun

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): she put the kunt in country

**thedoctordances1940** (10): This had fantastic lead single from an underwhelming album written all over it from the start. Ok maybe I shouldn't find a way to make the comments about the songs in this rate I love negative, cause this is just a fantastic track

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): its cheesy but cheese is good

**throwaway-7650** (10): the way this would get a higher average if it wasn't the lead [2]

**uberpigeon** (10): i thought this song was stupid  and then one day it smashed me in the head with a corny guitar and i finally understood it

**queershoulder** (9.8): peak pop for me

**babadork** (9.5): I like individual parts of this song more than I like it as a whole, but I really like those individual parts.

**impla77** (9.4): A shame noone on popheads can relate to this song :/

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (9): Campy and fun but it completely takes me out of the album.

**alexismateofan** (9): catch me riding to hell giving all these good scores maybe i’m a Rinarina.

**cocosairdep** (9): a bop, very BTW era Gaga

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): yee, and may i politely add, haw 🤠

**IIIHenryIII** (9): hymn by Kesha but make it rockier

**imbaby122** (9): broke: “fuck what they did to britney, to lady di and whitney” woke: “britney shaved her head and all we did was called her crazed”

**musical\_pyn** (9): if rina leaned into the country elements even more this would easily be my favorite song in the rate

**Nagisoid** (9): This is so Destiel-coded

**saviorARMY101** (9): can’t believe she made a song for me 😍

**shhhneak** (9): contrary to what I feel about how safe this album is for Rina, this is pure innocent fun!!

**Stryxen** (9): if you are BRAVE its because you can SLAY

**modulum83** (8.7): this is so corny but the guitar solo goes off i cant lie

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): this is like You Need To Calm Down but for gay people!!!

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.5): This hell is really better with Rina. A tongue in cheek track is banger to scare the homophobes away

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): some of the lyrics are very clunky, but Rina just really sells it with her delivery and it’s undeniably catchy

**TiltControls** (8.5): Honestly I don't really care for the verses but this chorus is just too damn catchy

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): i once spent like 20 minutes listening to a 15 second loop of the chorus while making my first ig reel

**jman457** (8.3): This is XS for gurlies with religious tramau (me)

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I see is a big fan of Born This Way

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): I’m sure Rina was trying to be really genuine but this has the same energy as the Target Pride collection

**kappyko** (8): Wait omg is she gay?

**nick1372** (8): What was the point of all the cowboy imagery if the only country element on this entire album is the first 20 seconds of this song...

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): corny and stupid but idgaf! her voice sounds amazing and it's fun as hell

**UselessTacooo** (8): omg I am soooooo Y2K quirkyyyyyyyy!

**vayyiqra** (8): Despite not liking this when it came out this is kind of a banger? And I like how among the hair metal flourishes there is also the Shania ref, 90s kids get this 🫂

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): I never wanted a shania twain type dance pop track from Rina, and after hearing this song so many times I still don't

**sarcasticsobs** (7.8): "The production is bad" I'm here to tell you right now- We don't care. We don't care.

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): why did so much of this song’s marketing act like it’s a country song?? girl was posting pics in cowboy hats for a lady gaga b side

**runaway3212** (7.5): this is rina's take on born this way

**moonshxne** (7.4): fun romp

pig-serpent: ## Catholics

**apatel27** (7): Big Mood in Gay Pride

**camerinian** (7): trying my hardest to balance how much i love the melodies and modulation in this track with how hard the lyrics make me cringe on a bad day

**ignitethephoenix** (7): look it’s boppy but it truly just feels like a born the way reject / variant.

**ktajlili** (7): yeah this is fun. I like the sound here. I kind of wish the rest of the album sounded like this.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This song conflicts me to no end. Cause not gonna lie, I always had an idea for a song that directly confronts and calls out the idea that certain people are destined for hell for elements outside of their control (specifically in my case, being a bit 💅 lmao) so I was very excited to see Rina attempt to tackle it! Unfortunately the results were not really what I was looking for. It just felt like a really superficial and even meme-y take on a concept that I think could have been examined with more detail and angst. She isn't even specific to what it is that's gonna send her to hell, like I get that you're trying to downplay whatever flaws you have to these religious fundamentalists, but girl we all know it's cause you're queer! None of this "Don't know what I did," say it loud and be proud! The shout out to Britney, Lady Di, and Whitney is a nice touch, just wish there was a bit more to it.

**bloodjet** (6.9): yassified chosen family. it's fun but there's way too many cringe moment in the lyrics

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (6.7): we love a British southern accent!!

**notarobot3675** (5.7): this song is fun but i also think it should have just been a standalone single and not included in the album. i feel like it doesnt fit with the rest of hold the girl.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.5): I wanna like this so much but these lyrics just feel like the side of her that says stuff like mother slayke too often

**beeozan** (5): me playing helltaker or whatever i never played that game

**Leixander** (4): this gets worse every time i hear it

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): very boring honestly and sounds like it was written by marina but like 2021 marina, not 2014 marina

**shckskndv** (4): Rina’s songwriting camps are comprised entirely of twinks, for whom she reads out the lyrics & determines if they’re usable by the volume of the “YAAAAAASSSSS” and amount of finger waggles she gets.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): if you’re BRAVE it’s because you SLAY

**cremeebrulee** (2): this song could've been good if she didn’t try to cram like a hundred random pop culture references in it

**ImADudeDuh** (2): I can’t tell you why I hate this but I do. I think I really hate the production and I feel like some of these lyrics would be dragged for pandering to the gays if it was from a random tiktok artist.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): Can’t stand this song. Production-wise it’s over-compressed and tinny to all hell, and the scoopy chorus I find super annoying.

**hikk** (10): What a great album opener this is. Charli cited Janet as an influence on this record and hearing that new jack swing tinge here is so much fun, the melodies are sticky and provides such a burst of energy right at the beginning of the album. It places as the second highest song behind Yuck, which I'd probably say would be my ranking too so we love to see it! But with that, Charli is now down to just one remaining track, alongside both Tove and Rina. Can any of them outlast Carly's remaining FIVE???

**pig-serpent** (9): Yet another of Charli's no nonsense album intros that makes a grand statement while being one of the best songs on the album.  The contrast of the faster chanting and the slower, drawn out nu-jack swing of the verses is a fantastic touch.  This was my favorite song on the album when it released, and while I still think it’s very good, a few songs have overtaken it.  I don’t fully disagree with it placing this high, but that definitely happened because it had the least amount of tankers when compared to the other Charli songs, and not because of a strong outpouring of love.

## Crashed their car into a bridge.  They don't care, they love it!

**1998tweety** (10): me driving in the winter and hitting a patch of black ice

**AHSWeeknd** (10): omg she’s doing coke

**akanewasright** (10): THAT! Is how you start an album! By getting in a car crash!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): it felt like a Janet song, but with ketamine and LSD thrown on the mix causing a wonderful car crash of emotions and sounds.

**beeozan** (10): not all albums can boast of having an intro track that is their best song

## There were no survivors

**alexismateofan** (7): this is kinda diva-y serving fiercely

**skeeturz** (7): a pretty fun opener. weirdly catchy, which is standard charli fare

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): cute bop but the melody reused from queen lizzy kinda drives me crazy lmao

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): definitely works well as an opener, has some solid production, sounds good and yet just feels a bit underwhelming, maybe that's just because I don't care for the album as a whole but idk it feels like there should be more to it

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Why is the album title in all caps but the song title isn't? Much to think about.

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): give my five reasons for the guitar solo go

**impla77** (6.4): we love a bit of underwater car trope

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): this rate’s gonna be a car crash for charli and i’ll support it

**Raindrac** (6): There couldn't be a more effective intro to the album than Crash. Carrying one of the best hooks of the album right out of the gate and some memorable production, it's probably the best moment on the album outright. Unfortunately, it's a little too short to be replayable. But for what it is, Crash is quite good.

**vayyiqra** (6): This has a very weak hook but I don't mind it! I do not like two-minute songs though! 🚘

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): “im about to crash into the water” omg its the sequel to when she crashed her car into the bridge in i love it

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (5): It's fine, but wish it wasn't the title track.

**frogaranaman** (5): like the album of the same name, this track feels like a collection of Tiktok sounds cobbled together to make a “song”

**runaway3212** (5): next level charli at home

**hikk** (10): This song went through a journey over the course of the rating period, bouncing between being among Charli’s top tracks but generally not the #1 for her, and also in day 2 for quite a lot of it. Ultimately it managed to somehow find its way into the top 10 and ends up as Charli’s highest song, which is so deserved imo! I love this song, even if it kind of is the most derivative track on the album sonically. This slick nu-disco Say So sound isn’t interesting at all at this point but Charli makes it work with just how fun the lyrics and delivery of them are here. It’s such a cute song in how opposed she is to romantic gestures but can’t help falling for them and trying to cover up those feelings with denial, the writing is just brilliant in how it conveys that in such an amusing way. It was an instant favourite for me upon hearing the album and has become one of my favourite Charli songs overall. With its elimination also brings Charli’s elimination from the rate, further extending her rate loss record as the first contender to exit the race today.

**pig-serpent** (10): Genuinely don't understand how this wasn't a single?  With songs like Big Dick Energy floating around in early 2022, with the right promo this easily could've been a huge smash and slotted right in with what radio was playing at the time.  Huge blunder for Charli and her team, and it seems like quite a few people agreed, as this was Charli’s highest placing song on the album.  However, there were quite a few people who absolutely hated this song, precisely for how much it sounds like corporate radio filler, and this resulted in it being the most controversial song to make day 3 and Charli being the first to lose all her songs.

pig-serpent: ## Sick (complimentary)

**babadork** (11): This is my most listened to song in this rate by a large margin, and I still think this should have been a single. (I also can’t decide which Carly song I like best.)

**hakkerj** (11): smash hit went #1 for 237 weeks

**jessi\_survivor\_fan** (11): This song is so good. I can't get over it.

**reput4tionera** (11): she is THAT GIRL!!!!!!!

**uberpigeon** (11): YUCK!

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): This is so cute!! This is gonna sound not serious at all but I really think it's powerful when a woman sings about not being attached to a relationship compared with the man for once

**1998tweety** (10): she ate that

**AHSWeeknd** (10): how does she manage to sing in British?? Like, how is there more than one way to say “yuck”??

**akanewasright** (10): shouting “YUCK!!!” at the top of my lungs when she played this live was only like the 5th most incredible thing at the Crash show, which is a MASSIVE endorsement of charli’s performance abilities

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): what a bop about not liking a guy back, unfortunately it's too short.

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): If I had another eleven

**Aoquesth378** (10): One of the most addictive songs in recent memory for me. Almost got my 11, I just wish the song was longer.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc3AT6Au_A_/?hl=en Well I guess she vetoed the popular vote…

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): charlotte emma aitchison you are a SICK and TWISTED DEMON for making one of the best pop songs of the last 5 years and not actually finishing it! an easy 11 if it had even just a final chorus. maybe she knew it would be too powerful if it were complete

**cremeebrulee** (10): she's just lik— [GUNSHOTS]

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the most bratz-coded song in this rate

**ignitethephoenix** (10): best deep cut on the album deserves to be a tik tok hit

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Carly getting the highest average when Charli clearly has the best album

**imbaby122** (10): u may call this song silly and camp. but rlly it’s a genius social commentary on not giving men what they think they’re owed and reaping the benefits of their persistence.

**jay** (10): the pseudo 11

**JIRACHI** (10): when this takes the rate win then what

**just\_thonking** (10): It's cut from the Lovefool-Say So-Cuff It cloth

**Nagisoid** (10): Please don't make the hint for this song the lady eating red onions video...

**queershoulder** (10): best three song streak on crash

**RandomHypnotica** (10): where the FUCK is the mv charlotte

**ricki** (10): if this had been a single the album would have gone triple platinum and it would be a viral hit, but instead it will just be #7 in the popheads top 100 songs of 2022 (coming soon, allegedly)

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I went to a BBQ once where someone was so obsessed with this song that they played it out of the speakers on repeat for at least 25 minutes

**seanderlust** (10): somehow not the campest song in this rate, but it's a close runner up

**sharts-n-farts** (10): charli and I are on the same wavelength for this song, wish it was longer though…

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is the song I find myself revisiting the most from Crash, I just enjoy everything about it

**skeeturz** (10): absolutely incredible it reminds me of sucker-era charli in the best ways

**Stryxen** (10): this is the point in the tracklist where she found the clit

**thatplatypus99** (10): all I can think about is this yuck x god is a woman mashup where the uploader was part of a conversion therapy group

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): sorry I like to cuddle after....

**shipperondeck** (9.6): charli when this outranks good ones

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): More like "Yum" lol

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): me when the entire era went by and it was never made a single with a video starring julia fox

**impla77** (8.8): see this is catchy, if only she hadn’t made this song but worse about 10 more times on this album

**plastichaxan** (8.5): I know this is her chance of winning but it’s nowhere near my favorite of the album sob

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): more like Yum!

**bogo** (8): yum

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): She put this on here to pander to people like me but unfortunately she forgot that people like me want songs to be over 2.5 minutes.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8): I too am allergic to feelings

**shhhneak** (8): Me watching the chill Carly songs go out back to back to back.

**Raindrac** (7.8): "Quit acting like a puppy" is such an iconic lyric, I love it! Although not my most-played song on Crash, Yuck easily has my favorite chorus. If only it weren't so short.

**UselessTacooo** (7.8): I can’t hear this without thinking of her waving the pride flag while singing it

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): was one of my favorites initially but after a year of spotify deciding to autoplay it after every single album the opening notes activate my panic response

**scythersboots** (7.4): feels fun and classic charlie

**welcome2thejam** (6): I don't have the app, did this Tik Tok bait work?

**ImADudeDuh** (5): chart of “enjoyment of the chorus of Yuck over time”: 📉

**kappyko** (5): Reaching the depressive stage of grief where i realize i dont really like funk wav bounces that much

**DrumBeatGlass** (4.5): generic disco sound at its best, still not original. The final one of the worst lyrics trinity from the standard edition.

**apatel27** (4): Very derivative

**runaway3212** (4): this is so overrated like what is this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): im actually so mad right now everyone hyped this song up as the best song on the album and its so painfully generic…like we can NOT be listening to the same song what do y’all see in this

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): this feels like it was written on autopilot

**dreamingpastel** (3): Lyrics just don't do it for me

**memezaharamole** (3): tik tok fodder

**thedoctordances1940** (2.4): i'm just tired of this sound and i can't bear her saying yuck over and over

**MasterWizardRyan** (2): words cannot explain how much this song annoyed me last year, i do not like the beat and the lyrics are ahem... yuck

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): this is a Kim Petras song [derogatory]

**vayyiqra** (0): I said I was going to tank this song once and Hikk said he'd reject my ballot and I couldn't tell if he was joking so I overthought this for a while and worried I annoyed him for real but anyway I really dislike this song sorry I find it deeply annoying and not enjoyable and I hope he isn't really mad at me 🚘

pig-serpent: # Crash

---

**Overall Average**: 7.496 **// Average Controversy:** 2.110

---

hikk: Charli promoting this era as her "sellout" album was very interesting, especially after HIFN was perhaps her most abrasive project yet, and while I do like her more experimental work a lot I can't deny a good generic pop song and Charli's penchant for writing hooks would undoubtedly pair brilliantly with that vision. While it's not a perfect album, I think it might be my favourite out of these four in the rate and I wish it did a bit better across the board here. She's already started kind of disowning this album which is a shame honestly because I think it was a really neat experiment that ended up working really well, but hopefully what comes next is even better.

pig-serpent: My favorite album of these four and the very unfortunate and incorrect loser of the rate (well, it has a higher average than Dirt Femme at least but…)  Even then, it’s not my runaway favorite, there are a few songs on it I think are aggressively mid and many of the songs don’t feel as fleshed out as they could have been.  But at the same time, Charli weirdly proves she doesn’t need to be hyperpop to make good music, as her voice and melodies carry this album for me and it’s evident she still mostly has a good ear for instrumentation.  It’s just a little bizarre because I still believe this could have been as good as her hyperpop albums even though it ended up nowhere close.  Putting the “Stepping out of your comfort zone and mostly succeeding but still failing to live up to your full potential” in the Disappointing Sub Favorites Rate.

**reput4tionera** (10.063): my most scrobbled album of 2022 for a reason

**AHSWeeknd** (10.063): The photoshoot does it for me ngl

**RandomHypnotica** (9.362): i do love this album, i did the aoty writeup for it after all, Charli perfectly delievered on the sell out era, and I really hope she returns to this sound in future

**Frajer** (9.031): Charli making a huge deal of this is my sellout era and then just making an album that is Charli to the core is so relatable and funny

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.969): this album will probably have my highest rating, but it's not as innovative as her previous ones, but I still like it, to be fair, and this popstar era is wonderful as it's the second one I was able to witness unfold and my god, what an iconic album!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.844): Thanking the heaven's that the "80's influences" that she mentioned during pre-release promo were not just relegated to "yeah, add those 80's stock synths". Like, HELLO new jack swing

**akanewasright** (8.781): I think I just have Charli brainworms at this point. I can defend my love of this album profusely, but it’s easier if I just say “she basically raised me and I think I’ll like literally anything she makes”

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.750): I really like this album. I think Charli’s wit, personality and presence that’s been throughout her work is what clinches it for me. So many sticky hooks with Charli’s sneering, passionate yet icy delivery.

**phonethephoenix** (8.725): i would be lying if i wasn't a little disappointed when this was released but it was probably my most-listened-to album of the year and has a lot of really solid songs!

**DirtyRat583** (8.313): FUCK YEAH CHARLI apart from the bonus tracks dont look at the bonus tracks

**Nagisoid** (8.250): Normalize selling out. It's curious how I really did not like this album upon first listen and looking back it's only cuz I wanted her to not leave the hyperpop/bubblegum bass of Pop 2 and HIFN, but this is really solid on its own. It's just bop after bop with few exceptions, and even though she doesn't do anything new at all, the throwbacks here are pretty varied in terms of genre. The first half is way better than the rest but that's a problem with most pop albums either way so not much you can do about that. The only part that soured on me about this project is that she handled this era in a... curious way to say the least, getting into fights with fans on twitter and shading her record label. At least that's over now and I don't think she's going to repeat that behavior so we will see.

**wasian-invasion** (8.250): this album (& dawn fm to a lesser extent) soundtracked my spring 2022 so much that I feel like I've kind of worn out this album (luckily spotify quality doesnt actually degrade that would suck). This feels like an album that Charli needed to make to break out of the hyperpop image that she had excelled at but felt constrained by. I love how all the discourse around the singles vanished the second the album came out and people were like wait this is actually good. Also extremely satisfying to see her get a top 10 album in the US after hifn got the coveted triple 1s.

**imbaby122** (8.188): like a lot of fans, i had my reservations with this sellout era concept, especially because the singles weren’t nearly as ironic and bloody and satanic as the marketing was. but as a whole, i came to appreciate crash more. self destructiveness set to 80s synth pop and 90s house throwbacks. it’s messy and sassy and fascinating. crash is not nearly my favorite charli project, but i appreciate her artistic vision, agency, and general messiness. and it’s a great showing lyrically, vocally, and production-wise for what it’s trying to be.

**dreamingpastel** (8.163): Listened to this album a lot while I drove to work, and while I didn't crash my car, I can confirm that it made my commute a little less dull

**Aoquesth378** (8.125): 9 Listen I know this album isn't considered her best and while I think she does indeed have better projects, but I think the project still had the same level of depth even though it went a more approachable and commercial route. I wish all pop music was as good as Crash.

**shipperondeck** (8.119): this is my most played album among these 4 but i've gotten a bit bored of it as a result

**notarobot3675** (8.088): I think of the albums featured in this rate Crash is my favourite - I think some of the songs on their own are fun but solidly just okay, but within the context of the album they all make for something really special.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.063): I think this is my second favorite album by her. It’s full of catchy melodies and has a great sound overall. I'm so glad she decided to sell out 🤩 I hate the fact that the deluxe tracks are tanking my average.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.063): listening to how much bridges elevate songs on the other albums in the rate reminded me how much they are missing from half the songs on this album. the main album has very high highs and quite a few lows, but the deluxe is very consistent.

**nick1372** (8.000): She released this album a week before I saw her in concert and in that time I successfully Solar Power-ed (verb: to obsessively listen to an album you don't like that much) myself into actually loving it. It's a brilliant merging of Charli's sound with sleek pop production and despite its influences sounds incredibly modern. I'm not surprised there was no big hit from this album but I'm disappointed because I'd love if mainstream pop music started to sound like this.

=====

pig-serpent: **throwaway-7650** (7.900): definitely my fave charli album that I've heard (pop 2 - present)

**xxipil0ts** (7.813): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand CRASH. The irony is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of her career trajectory and love for pop music for the last decade, most of the jokes will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Charli's blatant love letter for pop music, which is deftly woven into this record - her personal philosophy draws heavily from Mark Fisher literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these songs, to realize that they're not just ironic - they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike CRASH truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the sample in Charli's single "Used to Know Me," which itself is a cryptic sample of Robin S.'s "Show Me Love (Stonebridge Mix)" I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Charli XCX's genius unfolds itself on their streaming devices. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, I DO have a CRASH tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the mens' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.750): honestly not my favorite charli record, but nonetheless a fun and well-made pop album. has some real career highlights and honestly the era was just SO fun that it's hard to dislike it, even if you, like me, are more of a true romance/pop 2 kinda girl. will also always treasure that this was the era where i got to meet her and see her live for the first time <3 love you charles!

**JIRACHI** (7.625): the deluxe tracks ate and definitely should've replaced some songs on the main tracklist...

**prettybirbkotori** (7.563): it’s great but after 2 10/10 albums in a row an 8/10 feels like a downgrade

**camerinian** (7.531): definitely was let down by this album on first blush as a big fan of Charli in her more experimental and wild mode, but with repeated exposure I found a lot to like here. There’s a real depth to the production that showed Charli clearly put the bigger budget to good use, and it helps the more accessible tone still have enough bite and resonance than I initially gave it credit. Certainly still doesn’t come close to HIFN or Pop 2, but that’s a wildly high bar and I’m happy with where this one ultimately landed

**lexiaredery** (7.469): This album has really grown on me over the last month. It did a lot better than I was expecting going into it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.438): The album for people whose favorite Charli song is still Boom Clap, aka me. Charli gets my award for biggest glow-up since 2020 Sub Faves that's for sure. It's not that I hate hyper-pop, it's just that even through all of that, I still find my tastes comfortably in the world of mainstream pop. Even though she's spent so long so far away from the mainstream, she's still able to make a wonderful pure pop album, with a few unique hyperpoppy elements too!

**shhhneak** (7.394): Sellout (complimentary)

**just\_thonking** (7.156): Hmmmmm

**jman457** (6.906): I really felt like this was just a muted/ “sell out” version of all her previous work, like an unslay self-titled.

**redgold51** (6.625): Charlie set the bar sooo high with previous releases that this one didn’t hit quite the same :/ victim of her own excellence fr

**alexismateofan** (6.625): I knew almost nothing about Charli XCX before I listened to this album, and I’m down to listen to some more, though I feel like maybe I don’t get her like some of the people do. But that’s fine, means the other girls can get tour tickets from tourmaster.

**impla77** (6.488): Charli has always eluded me, unlike most other sub faves. This album is fine.. works well enough but feels a bit samey. Its a meh from me

**vayyiqra** (6.438): The discourse over this era before it came out was kind of insufferable! But then it died off quickly? Idk but I have tried this album a bunch of times and have no wish to discourse more about it but it is kind of Not For Me. It feels oddly empty and on autopilot. Not unbearably bad, just boring and not up to her standards. And not even because of the "mainstream pop" thing, just because nothing about the songwriting grabs me. Also I'm very against the "two-minute songs that feel like snippets" thing which doesn't help. Still not a bad album, just inconsistent and not a standout of hers. Idk I've been following Charli for about ten years, I think she's still got it. 🚘

**apatel27** (6.438): Given how hard she went in the marketing of this, the album itself is such a disappointment

**Stryxen** (6.375): more like rash

**TiltControls** (6.281): turns out me cheering for charli to win all stars was really just a temporary alliance

**kappyko** (5.938): kinda insulted on behalf of Janet Jackson and True Romance but she ate with a couple songs here

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.938): I think Charli does nothing for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.813): im so disappointed in charli, i know that the point of this album was to get out of her contract and make a “sell out” album, but you can strip away your more unconventional sounds while still making good music. this is just an average run of the mill pop album that couldve been made by any no name c-lister, and if charli’s name wasnt slapped on this i highly doubt anybody would care about it.

**beeozan** (5.813): Imagine a world where, amidst the hyperpop craze, Farrah Abraham notices that MTDE is now considered a proto-hyperpop visionaire camp classic and wants to capitalize on that. Now, Farrah knows that simply repeating the novelty of MTDE on another project won't be a good move. A sequel album nearly a decade later needs to show some growth and evolution, therefore she and her producer jump on some of the new sensibilities in the pop music scene. To their credit, they manage to create some bops but ultimately these are the people who made MTDE: ideas are thrown around like darts with most of them missing their target. I imagine the final product would've sounded like this album.

**moonshxne** (5.775): *sighs* what i want...charli ain't got it here. so many of the songs have the potential for greatness, but are just missing that spark and ultimately sound not just disposable, but too frustratingly static to even bop to

**MasterWizardRyan** (5.531): I figure my CRASH average is going to get me suspected of sabotage. So, my thoughts on CRASH is that it's a pretty mid album, it has some highlights for sure but the album is bloated with mid and downright awful songs (those deluxe cuts-, Charli, babes what we're you thinking?)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.513): why is she romanticizing traffic accidents… im disgusted ://////

**thedoctordances1940** (4.331): I do really love Charli, even her earlier albums that a lot of her fans kinda ignore but it was clear from the moment I heard the teaser to Good Ones that I would not like this album and every subsequent single just made it more and more obvious that I was going to be incredibly underwhelmed by this album, and, well, I was. Crash is my least favourite Charli album by a country mile, and I was not inherently against a shift to more generic pop, I really really like a lot of very generic pop music (I wouldn't have hosted yass and slay if that wasn't the case) but Charli can just do so much better than this and I think that's the most damning thing I can say about it, it just doesn't sound like she's trying.

**ImADudeDuh** (3.756): There’s a few good songs here but there’s a lot of just samples of better songs used in the same way (unlike something like Renaissance) which has really become a peeve of mine after 2022. Maybe I can’t objectively rate this album because some of her stuff this era annoyed me, but I’ve never liked Charli that much and I actually rated this higher than other Charli albums I’ve rated, but its still not much of an improvement.

**hikk** (10): Tove is an excellent fit for the Euphoria soundtrack, I mean she basically had that whole ~aesthetic~ going on in her music and visuals before the show existed, so it was cool to see them get her for the show and also to see her put out something of such quality while she was at it! How Long is classic Tove as it should be for the themes present in Euphoria, with dark synths and lyric that reflect the love triangle plotline in the show’s second season while also being nonspecific enough to work perfectly on its own. Though perhaps a bit disconnected from Dirt Femme as a whole, I’m glad it was included on the album and that we could rate it here, because it ends up as her highest rated track. With that we have now lost both her and Charli, and against all odds Rina is now the only hope against Carly.

**pig-serpent** (6.5): It really shouldn’t surprise me anymore that a synthwave song I think is decent is actually highly regarded by popheads.  It’s certainly her best take on the genre on this album, with that synth bloop that jumps all around the scale, but I don’t think it’s catchy or interesting or bright enough to really stand out in the genre, even compared to her prior song “Stranger.”  Is it the best song on the album?  Eh, not really.  Did it deserve to outlast all of Crash?  Certainly not.  But am I happy Tove Lo has top 10 representation?  Yes, absolutely.

---

## High school play with an infinite budget

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I’ve been obsessed with this song since it came out. So much suspense and drama in one song, love the dark synths throughout. And Tove completely owns this song.

**memezaharamole** (11): helped me process the news that I was in an open relationship with my ex, and I just didn't know it was open haha song is amazing though, the way that the beat starts and then warps into this slow, hazy synth, the delivery of the lyrics, the way it worked for the storyline in Euphoria, a deserved eleven in a rate that had many competitors.

**plastichaxan** (11): It was a close call for my 11 but this hit the hardest this time

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): Love this one for her. Peak Tove Lo.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Tove Lo’s closing tracks are always top tier

**akanewasright** (10): YASSS I WAS SO GLAD THIS MADE THE ALBUM, SOTY MATERIAL FOR REAL

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I like how it sounds, those synths reminds me of all the migraine I get from listening at CRJ for the first time and I upped my headphones' volume.

**Ambrosia42** (10): HOW LONG HAVE YOU LOVED ANOTHER WHILE I’M DREAMING OF US TOGETHER!?!??

**Aoquesth378** (10): This song fits so well into her discography it's not even funny.

**Awkward\_King** (10): she rly made the song of the year for the euphoria s2 soundtrack like be fr

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Bitch you better be slaying!!! Idk that’s the only line from Euphoria I know and I just tried to make it work.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): maybe euphoria isnt completely useless

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): when this landslides euphoria soundtrack rate omg…

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my faves from her! She aced the euphoria energy of it and it’s also just great on it’s own

**imbaby122** (10): bro. whoever thought of adding “iii neeed tooo knowww” leading into the second repeat of the chorus needs their pussy eaten. it’s makes the song 10x more hype. takes it from a 9 to a 10.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): probably should be my 11 for the intro alone but i'm leaving it as a 10 for the euphoria connection...

**kwcty6888** (10): deserved more than 5 seconds in euphoria

**Leixander** (10): perfect chorus

**modulum83** (10): the DRAMA???

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the best thing to ever come from Euphoria (except those cassie memes)

**reput4tionera** (10): oh bitch

**runaway3212** (10): obvi

**seanderlust** (10): inject that synth line directly into my veins

**sharts-n-farts** (10): one of her best songs.

**shipperondeck** (10): been in love w this since it dropped and it's still that bitch!!!!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): dark and moody synths like this are just a cheat code

**throwaway-7650** (10): I only watched euphoria vicariously through twitter and discord oomfs but this is the 11 if rina wasn't in the rate

**vayyiqra** (10): I hear synth arpeggios and I like it, this is what Daft Punk has done to me (positive) ♀️

**welcome2thejam** (10): Is this just Talking to Yourself/Constant Repeat from the third piece of the love triangle

**Xaviersi** (10): After this came out on Euphoria from HBO, the amount of times I had it on loop before the album dropped resulted it being in my top 5 for the year. Such a chill song you really can't over play.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): grew off me a Tad but it was a moment when it dropped yup yup

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Choli outsold, not our Choli, the other Choli, our phcj king

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.3): not the best song being something tacked on from the euphoria soundtrack

**impla77** (9.2): omg weeknd teas

**CrimsonROSET** (9): charlie puth outsold but this is still kinda cunt

**JIRACHI** (9): OKAAYYY

**phonethephoenix** (9): good song!

**ricki** (9): i was going to make a lewd joke but i decided instead to have some shame today. you're welcome

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Alright, I'm back in a tad

**UselessTacooo** (9): euphoria was lucky to have her

**jman457** (8.6): her weeknd euphoria moment

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended that fad charlie puth

**flava** (8.5): this is going to sneak the win, isn’t it

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Sam Levinson is just straight Ryan Murphy and therefore will not even see purgatory much less heaven

**TiltControls** (8.5): but now with the album tagging i'll never know if the song is 'From "Euphoria" An HBO Original Series'. at least spotify's still stuck it with the single art to remind us for all time <3

**luckyphase** (8.3): intro reminds me of playing 3d pinball for windows (it's a good memory)

**camerinian** (8): kills me how good the euphoria soundtrack is when I can’t fucking stand watching the actual show

**ktajlili** (8): I think this is a great closer. I wasn't much of a fan on this album, but I did appreciate the thematic cohesion, and this closer really ties it together and gives it a tragic ending. IDK if it was intended to be on the album but it works really well. A grown up relationship, with troubles, that ultimately ends up being more doomed that the narrator thought.

**Nagisoid** (8): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1093022036923777055/1104149885915250728/ohwf3t6.jpg

**shckskndv** (8): I was so disappointed when this wasn’t actually in any episodes of Euphoria

**skeeturz** (8): it's a nice album closer, very dark and synthy which are things i love

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Sexy and futuristic

**wasian-invasion** (8): the euphoria soundtrack shouldve just been the full dirt femme album

pig-serpent: ## Cassie puking in the hot tub

**alexismateofan** (7): who was this man in this song and how do i give him a restraining order

**DrumBeatGlass** (7): Back with slutry, sexy track and deep synths. Better than Lana's song for Euphoria. It's mysterious and packed with so many details and small sounds. Wish she didn't hide them so much

**frogaranaman** (7): every time Euphoria is the HBO show of the month I lose a year of my life

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Kinda weird choice for a closer.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): somewhere, charlie puth realized he needs to post another thirst trap

**prettybirbkotori** (7): this is fun but i want it to be even filthier

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): unfortunately for a song on the euphoria soundtrack this kinda slaps

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): too good to be on the euphoria soundtrack

**bogo** (6): maybe in isolation i would like this better but listening to this in album order i fail to see how it’s more interesting than the other songs on this album

**Stryxen** (6): the instrumental in the chorus is gorgest but this is so forgettable

**scythersboots** (5.4): intro too long, feels like a watered down version of more interesting tracks earlier in the album

**apatel27** (5): I can see why this was played in Euphoria

**Raindrac** (4): Charlie Puth did it better. Please, don't let that happen to you. It's shameful.

pig-serpent: # Dirt Femme

---

**Overall Average**: 7.467 **// Average Controversy:** 1.936

---

hikk: I've been a fan of Tove for a while now but I didn't really care for Sunshine Kitty all that much, so I see Dirt Femme as a return to form. Is it a perfect album? No, there's definitely some misses, and I think as a whole it's not particularly novel at all, but it's still a good listen and has some great songs. I'm so glad that we got to rate it here, even if she didn't do all that well, because in my mind she is more than deserving of being considered a Sub Fave.

pig-serpent: I was very impressed with this album the first time that I heard it, but the more I listen to it I feel like the good parts are merely good and not great, and the bad parts get worse and worse for me.  Tove Lo has some great melodies on here but the instrumentation is so standard and a little bit flat, and half of the album is forgettable, so I think it deserves being the losing album of the rate.  Putting the “Thinking an album is good but having it grow off you” disappointment in the Disappointing Sub Favorites rate.

**DirtyRat583** (9.308): bass queen (this album + a subwoofer = literal explosion)

**Aoquesth378** (9.269): 9.5 This album is sooo amazing, my second favorite of the year after Renaissance. There's only one song I don't absolutely love. I think it also has some issues with the track order.

**Frajer** (9.192): Tove is the quintessential pop girl, she always delivers and makes cute bops that I love , they put something in the water in Sweden I swear

**AHSWeeknd** (9.000): queen of making bops tbh

**beeozan** (8.615): sometimes the tacked on faves are the best faves, congratz to Tove Lo for making a good album!

**shipperondeck** (8.608): cool ass album cover

**RandomHypnotica** (8.554): my least fave album in this rate, but I think it's the most consistent project here

**wasian-invasion** (8.538): My first full Tove Lo album that I listened to and I'm so glad I did. So many bangers bops and jams you can really count on the Swedes i guess. She's also one of the most impressive live singers I've seen it's kinda crazy how close she sounds to the recorded versions

**phonethephoenix** (8.500): i don't listen to enough tove lo but i def need to change that. good album!!

**akanewasright** (8.462): Tove Lo has almost never been a consistent albums artist for me. Aside from QOTC and maybe Sunshine Kitty (which have this problem to a lesser extent), she usually has some of the biggest bangers I’ve ever heard and then some *massive* duds of epic proportion. Dirt Femme has a few misfires, and a lot of it doesn’t reach the depraved heights of songs like Disco Tits, but it’s a lot more consistent for me. And for whatever reason, I feel more empowered than usual to hit the skip button on the few songs I do hate without it detracting from my thoughts on the album

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.385): I was scared of listening to her because of my storage issues (I'm definitely NOT pirating my favorite albums ;) but this album has a decent amount of bops, but some of the songs here are, for the lack of a better word, boring and the album wouldn't mind losing them, but other than that, this album is pretty good, it just needs trimming.

**jman457** (8.146): Im usually mid on Tove Lo but she put audible crack in this album

**imbaby122** (8.115): i’m not an avid tove lo fan, so i don’t have as much to say about this album. however, since this album released i have reflected on her discography and realized just how well she has perfected raw, confessional, horny pop. dirt femme is no exception.

**dreamingpastel** (7.938): The last time I listened to Tove Lo was in 2015, so this was a fun little check-in

**throwaway-7650** (7.915): wonder if the deluxe would increase or decrease my avg.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.800): Consistently "fine-to-good", just a lot of sounds I feel like I had so much heard before (or maybe just recently, so maybe I wasn't being fair)

**JIRACHI** (7.731): just like every other Tove album there were very high highs and very low lows

**TiltControls** (7.731): A bit more hit and miss than her previous albums, but the peaks here are fantastic

**just\_thonking** (7.692): Didn't like this at first but it grew on me! Especially the back half

**IIIHenryIII** (7.615): I’ve been sleeping on her and now I finally have a reason to go through her catalog. I expected something dirtier, but I’m not disappointed.

**alexismateofan** (7.538): Tove Lo is one of those artists that I knew the hits from, but I never really gave an album a shot. Like the only song I really jived with from the get go was Cool Girl, and everything else was very touch and go. Dirt Femme was a really fun start for me to get into a full release by her. I will probably be coming back to her sooner rather than later.

**nick1372** (7.500): Tove's most consistent album yet but it never reaches the highest highs of her best work

=====

pig-serpent: **darjeelingdarkroast** (7.462): Overall, some highlights including my favorite song in the rate. As an entire album it’s way too samey and kind of blurs together for me. Tove continues to be an artist where a handful of songs I adore but don’t really clamor to follow every single thing she drops.

**camerinian** (7.423): first time listen for this rate, and honestly now I feel bad for pigeonholing Tove Lo as more of a singles artist, because hoo boy I had a lot of fun with this

**vayyiqra** (7.385): Tove was once one of my favourite artists; I was heavily into *Queen of the Clouds* (good breakup album!) and *Blue Lips* is very good but she kind of lost me with *Sunshine Kitty* being very "just okay" ... this was good though! Will go back to it soon. ♀️

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.154): an album i have a weird relationship with. half of it is some of the finest pop music of last year and of the decade thus far, and the other half of it just does nothing for me. i remember being so into it when it first came out and then really quickly losing interest on follow up listens. but, putting some respect on tove's name, half of this record is still absolutely immaculate, some grade-a premium quality dance pop confectionery. and the visuals, as always with tove, were iconic.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.038): honestly, it was simultaneously better and worse than I was expecting

**Nagisoid** (6.923): This is the first Tove Lo album I hear so I don't have a lot to say about it, however like practically every other human being in Earth with ears I did listen to Habits and I found it to be a solid pop song. She does sound a bit bored on almost all the songs but that's more of an artistic choice that works for me only occasionally. In this one though the album peaks in the middle hard and never reaches the same heights. SG Lewis' production is so good and he makes this album a pretty fun listen. I don't know what else to say other than her lyrics are nice for the aesthetic she's trying to present and the slower songs falter somewhat compared to the upbeat tracks.

**prettybirbkotori** (6.923): this album reaffirms my belief that tove lo can be such a star with just absolutely filthy ridiculous over the top production and i think her usual light synthy sound is doing her a disservice

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.769): It's generic dance-pop but done in the most high quality way. I will admit I was pleasantly surprised to listen to this, as someone who has little experience with Tove Lo, it's really really good!

**kappyko** (6.308): Me when i dont bathe im really running out of ideas man take me back to 2021

**ktajlili** (6.154): wasn't too impressed

**Stryxen** (6.038): mould masc

**oscarbrierley1** (6.038): very high highs and very low lows. feels like she had a concept but didnt stick to it fully.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.915): Tove Lo is the only artist in this rate I've never really got into in the past outside of a few tracks, so I don't really have the same level of investment in her and thus the same level of disappointment as I do with the others. That's one of the reasons I didn't really write that many comments for this album, at least not compared to the others, but another reason is that this is just by far the least interesting album in the rate anyway. It's definitely not the worst, it's my second highest average and only just behind Rina, but I just don't really have much to say about, it's worst songs are generally not that bad, but it's best song are generally not that good, with a few exceptions on both sides. There's just a whole lot of "eh" here.

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.269): I don’t get this one. I know the sub has been raving about it, but I felt that the whole album felt bland and dated. Nothing really stood out except for How Long, and most songs made me think that I’d heard them done better five years ago.

**moonshxne** (5.246): wish this sonically embraced the desert landscape of the visuals (and/or went the retro-futuristic route), but then again the one song that did was a bit of drag so

**flava** (5.231): I did check this out last year on the basis that odd numbered Tove Lo albums tend to be far far far better than her even-numbered output (if Lady Wood ever gets rated I might honestly give it a less than 2 average, that sense of disappointment stung hard). And after spending some time with Dirt Femme, why is this here, every shot at its transgressive message of retaining a feminist independence while staying in a long term relationship is hampered down so badly by the boring as hell sonic palette, covering uninspired synthpop and more hyperpop-dancey sounds.

**bogo** (5.154): i’m sorry but i found this album really boring. this album strips away basically everything unique about tove and replaces it with the most generic sounding low energy synthpop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.885): look im sorry that my scores for this album are just consistently in the 5-6 range but genuinely this is my least favorite type of music. there’s no soul in here theres absolutely no innovation or creativity in the production of anything and every single song sounds the exact same to me and i can’t stand it. like none of these songs are that particularly awful on their own and if i were to rate these songs individually and separated from each other in a grab bag context they would probably score better but listening to this in an album is genuinely unbearable to me. im always of the opinion that being boring is worse than being bad and in that regard this album is probably one of the worst i’ve ever listened to because i can not remember a single second of any song here.

**apatel27** (4.154): Should've been a 3 album rate. This is so bad

**hikk** (9): This was another grower for me, at first I just saw it as a decent album track but as it found its way to the top 6 of the rate I gave it some more time and now I do see the light. The prechorus is such a highlight, I love how she says "you're my little rock skipper skipper skipper" idk idk... There's definitely songs I would rather see this high (quite a few from Charli or Tove...) but I'm not too upset, plus it's just really funny to me to see how this turned out with Carly having five of the top 6. Unfortunately with this cut it means that Carly no longer has the opportunity to beat the Paramore and Beyonce record, but will she be able to tie them?

**pig-serpent** (6): Every time I listen to this song I want to give it a different score as the two halves of my brain go “but it’s catchy” and “but it’s boring” at each other over and over again.  This was sitting around The Bends and Beach House territory for a while, but just before the last week it closed the 15 song gap and crawled its way into the top 6.  Far from a bad song, but outscoring every Charli and Tove Lo song is a bit absurd, methinks.

## Actually I want it 3 times!

**cocosairdep** (11): she severely outmothered I’m afraid

**runaway3212** (11): more like great thing once

**Stryxen** (11): it has so much character and i played this on repeat so much in november when i did a few bad things twice. hehe. the lyrics are subtle playful perfection - it’s such a stand out i can’t BELIEVE she didn’t play this when i saw her but maybe she knew the slay had to be contained or the building would collapse.

**wasian-invasion** (11): i feel kind of bad that charli has gone so long without winning a rate but honestly at this point it's kinda funny so i guess i'll do a bad thing once

**AHSWeeknd** (10): relatable queen

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this song sounds like it's a Dedicated outtake that deserves a single rollout and a TikTok trend to get the vitality it needs because it's soo good!

**babadork** (10): This got bumped up from the nines for being my dog’s 11.

**phonethephoenix** (10): cross the rivers of my mind, you're my like rock skipper skipper skipper. love the lyrics and sooo catchy.

**plastichaxan** (10): Tell them queen

**prettybirbkotori** (10): easiest 11 of all time if one song didn’t barely edge it out. not QUITE my favorite from her but a career highlight easily

**RandomHypnotica** (10): scorpio-coded banger

**ReallyCreative** (10): Evil Angela Bassett cloning herself

**sarcasticsobs** (10): BASS

**shckskndv** (10): “cross the rivers of my mind, you’re my little rockskipper, skipper, skipper” gives my brain an orgasm

**1998tweety** (9): this is hitting something

**Awkward\_King** (9): second time rate hosts be like:

**bookthieving** (9): wjsn robbed!

**camerinian** (9): this sounds immaculate, like you can really feel the energy in the studio with just all the little instrumental vamps and the way every layer is so locked into each other, like the melodies and the rhythms all play off each other so well here. Easy album highlight.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): shitpost needs to be twice momo encore pleeeease

**ktajlili** (9): cross the river of my heart / you're my little rock skipper - it's funny how Carly's lyrics can be so good without drawing too much attention to yourself

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): she thought we needed an emotion moment before the album wrapped up. and she was right.

**impla77** (8.7): omg me and Carly were born in the same month!! literally twins

**Aoquesth378** (8.5): Love the baseline and the song is fantastic to listen to. Thematically reminds me of the opposite of Feel It Twice by Camilla Cabello, where she is willing to try again instead.

**ricki** (8.5): i feel like this is TWICE shade

**alexismateofan** (8): I mean it’s a serve. What can I say? It’s just a serve.

**bogo** (8): alright we’re back to slaying

**CrimsonROSET** (8): actually Carly skipping rocks is very in character but I’m now jealous because I can’t do five skips

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Reminds me a lot of “Cry” from *Emotion: Side B*

**letsallpoo** (8): this NEEDED a final chorus

**throwaway-7650** (8): when the hint is playing bad thing by jesy nelson twice

**vayyiqra** (8): More like "good song once"! (I'm funny) 🍐

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): So many of Carly's song are hitting just the right parts of my brain

**DrumBeatGlass** (7.9): Going back to disco-pop. A freaking grower. The bass guitar is outstanding

**Raindrac** (7.5): Carly's whispery vocals pair really well with a groove as energetic as this. "You're my little rock skipper-skipper-skipper" is a good hook, not enough to draw me back but something that I really enjoy whenever I happen to play this song. Bad Thing Twice is the highlight of the second half of The Loneliest Time and the beginning of a stretch of songs that lead me to consider this album backloaded, something quite unusual for an artist whose albums are usually frontloaded instead.

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): this feels like the Loneliest Time: the prequel. It’s not as good.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the way this song describes the last and the next track is so genius

**uberpigeon** (7): TWICE???

**UselessTacooo** (7): this is nice to listen to maybe

**queershoulder** (6.9): so close to loving this one

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): almost very good

**Nagisoid** (6): Me when I play that new Jesy Nelson song two times idk

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): carly when she rates track 12 on crash

**frogaranaman** (5): Carly when she put the album duds near the final stretch

**welcome2thejam** (5): Nice groove, but doesn't do enough with it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): this is so generic what is going onnnnn with this album

**hikk** (9): I'm honestly not really sure what the point of making these "bonus tracks" was if they're just going to be immediately available on streaming on the only version of the album. But this is plagued with the (Bonus Track) tag which is too bad because it's definitely among the best on the album for me and it seems y'all mostly agree! I really didn't see this or Bad Thing Twice doing quite this well, to me they gave more late day 2/early day 3 energy, but it's cool to see I guess. This is a nice sultry track equipped with a killer bassline so what's not to like? Unfortunately though, Rina has now killed the all-Carly top 4 dream - can she make it the rest of the way?

**pig-serpent** (7): This was a huge fan favorite that was sitting in the top 10 for the whole rate, and threatened to get even higher than 5th for a while.  And I have to be honest, this song is reminding me a lot of Charli’s Constant Repeat but less interesting.  Idk, another song I don’t really get the love for I guess.

---

## People with anexity disorders

**alexismateofan** (11): i’m picking up the phone and asking Carly to inject my entire body with this song and it will kill me but it will be worth it.

**ReallyCreative** (11): the way this album came out like two weeks after I got diagnosed with an anxiety disorder

**shhhneak** (11): Every time this bitch drops an album she casually has the best song in her discography as a bonus track. Insane behaviour.

**shipperondeck** (11): idk what to say except this is like the perfect song

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): IMAGINE TARGET EXCLUDING THIS FROM THEIR TRACKLIST.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the boy is in his reputation era

**akanewasright** (10): Thee smasha, easily the best bonus cut

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , I hooked up with somebody last week and it was the first time I had the s-word with somebody I actually liked and this song always plays inside of my head, especially with what happened next, it's like a puzzle where everything fits into places (literally)....

**Aoquesth378** (10): Perfect bonus track imo, it's fun, exciting, and enjoyable. Honestly I think it's a better song than several others that made the album.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me at 2 PM after I drink a large iced coffee every morning (and I’ll continue to do so).

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): shes just like me fr

**DrumBeatGlass** (10): Can this replace TLT or Sideways, thank you. Carly is naughty, I love how she doesn't tell you straight in the face about her fantasies and make the songs really sexy. She did THAT

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): why is the clit of the album a bonus track,,, make it make sense carly

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): girl therapy can help with that

**JIRACHI** (10): i give 10s where 10s are due...

**just\_thonking** (10): The Tame Impala serve

**musical\_pyn** (10): Probably my 11 from this album if it wasn't for the song that immediately precedes this

**phonethephoenix** (10): this song is cool! I like the bass

**prettybirbkotori** (10): that GUITAR LINE??? the bonus tracks don’t really mean anything because they came with the album but this should’ve been a main track

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she's just like me fr

**ricki** (10): omg meeee

**sarcasticsobs** (10): BASS. More 10 bait tailored specifically to me

**saviorARMY101** (10): UNDERRATED ASF

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): she's just like me

**throwaway-7650** (10): why is this better than most of the album like... bonus track my *

**wasian-invasion** (10): im so ready for tlt side b in like 5 months

**notarobot3675** (9.9): how was this a bonus track yet beach house made the official cut

**Stryxen** (9.8): MEEEEEEE

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): why did she call this song anxious when it cures my anxiety for 3 minutes

**nick1372** (9.5): Carly is so good at these sensitive sex jams

**Ambrosia42** (9): can we move it to the bedroom…

**bloodjet** (9): love the bass in this

**bookthieving** (9): owning ts6 is a red flag [2]

**CrimsonROSET** (9): BIG REPUTATION BIG REPUTATION

**dreamingpastel** (9): Really like how Carly sounds in this. Like, subtly sultry or something.

**ktajlili** (9): yah why wasn't this on the main disc?

**Leixander** (9): 👀👀👀

**plastichaxan** (9): This being better than most of the main album

**queershoulder** (9): should have been on the main album!

**slimboyfriend** (9): more of this!! Less G-rated Lana Del Rey!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): so randomly excellent... the loneliest time side b is gonna be out for blood

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Wait this is amazing Carly?? How are you gonna leave this one off?

**welcome2thejam** (9): Could've easily replaced a few of these songs and did what they do better

pig-serpent: ## Nuerotypicals

**scythersboots** (8.8): I love this why was it a bonus

**imbaby122** (8.5): i thought this song would be a deep confessional about mental health problems but carly rae jepsen FUCKS too much to mess with that anxiety stuff.

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): doja cat’s naked is a sluttier version of this

**IIIHenryIII** (8): she’s so relatable 🤩

**Nagisoid** (8): That boy got a BIG REPUTATION BIG REPUTATION

**skeeturz** (8): a great bonus track, fantastic addition and would've fit perfectly fine in the tracklist IMO

**UselessTacooo** (8): This is the grooviest groove of groovy grooves

**vayyiqra** (8): Like me trying to speedrun this rate! 🍐

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i have anxiety and it does not feel like pleasant synthpop it feels like a powerdrill to my skull

**camerinian** (7.5): really wish that thick bassline wasn’t immediately buried by the standard disco percussion because otherwise there’s a real allure to this track that the rest of the album lacked in a lot of spots

**jman457** (7.4): fun little bop

**impla77** (7.3): I’m assuming its bc this man has a big dick

**flava** (6.5): these bonus tracks

**Raindrac** (6.5): For a song with the title "Anxious", it's surprisingly upbeat. Groovy and sultry, it's probably my favorite deluxe track. I haven't listened to it much though, so maybe I'm sleeping on it or maybe the bassline just isn't enough to carry it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I was gonna say “Austin Mahone outsold” because he also has a song called “Anxious” but even though I like his song better, if we’re being honest, he’s never outsold anyone in his life.

**shckskndv** (6): the instrumental is spotless, but the song underneath rolls off my brain like a pat of butter on a skillet.

**runaway3212** (2): this is so boring im sorry

**hikk** (10): If there's one thing Carly can always nail it's an album opener. RAWM, Julien, This Love Isn't Crazy, and now this all rank among my absolute faves from her. It resonates lyrically, and her vocals deliver them convincingly. It's her tried and true brand of synthpop done extremely well, and she even says FUCK oh neptune! This found its way to #3 early on and just stayed there, which is fine by me. She also ends up with the podium sweep, and now all that's left is to see which of Talking To Yourself or The Loneliest Time will take the crown!

**pig-serpent** (9): A nice wash of synths playing punchy chord changes while Carly serenades you.  The synthwave stylings add a nice dash of momentum, and it's the perfect combo of energetic and relaxed to be a great song.  Maybe not great enough to grab 4th place and sit there the entire rate though; there are def a lot of other songs (including a few Carly songs) I would’ve liked to see here instead.

pig-serpent: ## Brave Enough for Everything

**nick1372** (11): oh man. ohhhh man. oh boy.

**saviorARMY101** (11): SHE SAID FUCK

**slimboyfriend** (11): it’s run away with me it’s real love it’s this love isn’t crazy it’s that one to two songs she slots into every album to remind everyone that she’s the vulnerable yet bold girl who blessed us with Emotion and could make another Emotion if she wanted but she doesn’t want to

**thedoctordances1940** (11): This reminds me of why I did (and to an extent still do?) love Carly. Shame about everything that comes after it

**1998tweety** (10): she ate this

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I can’t even make joke comments with this album, it’s so beautiful

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is, soo good, so great that the demo is better that almost a of the other songs in this rate, I love the vulnerability she made us felt with this song.

**bigbigbee** (10): when she got JANE KRAKOWSKI for the MV for this I died…like…I see the vision…this album is just Theatre, you normies wouldn’t get it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is currently my most played song ever according to last.fm. DESERVED.

**bloodjet** (10): just a beautiful reminder to be honest!

**cremeebrulee** (10): a lot of my favorite songs of all time are about being emotionally closed off so the fact that i love this song is kinda out of character… the line “i wanna be brave enough to show you my not so perfect family” like damn she gets it....

**CrimsonROSET** (10): her renting out a theater for the mv iconic

**dreamingpastel** (10): The magic behind all my favorite Carly songs is how the song builds up to a huge chorus, and this is no exception. One thing I do want to point out that makes it stand out from the rest is that there's a tinge of sadness mixed with hope. It's the perfect song for the ending of a romance movie, when the couple finally gets together.

**impla77** (10): Carly really just dropped a fuck and moved on with her life.. take notes Taylor

**jman457** (10): A perfect album opener, just a nice synthpop tune

**just\_thonking** (10): Hearing this le*k changed my life

**modulum83** (10): the lyrics on this song knocked me on my ass and made me rethink my entire attitude towards myself and my romantic partners. thank you queen!

**notarobot3675** (10): her album openers are always iconic

**oscarbrierley1** (10): this song becomes more amazing to me every time i listen to it. for some reason the music video is when it first really clicked for me, it sent it from like a seven or eight to a ten.

**prettybirbkotori** (10): a perfect opener i still regret missing the tickets to the broadway version

**ReallyCreative** (10): the woman knows how to open an album

**reput4tionera** (10): she said fuck

**runaway3212** (10): me after seeing a guy for 5 seconds

**sarcasticsobs** (10): This probably would be a blast live

**seanderlust** (10): i absolutely love the vulnerability on this track coupled with the dancey atmosphere

**shhhneak** (10): This is so Britney Spears comeback coded.

**shipperondeck** (10): it's like my lowest 10 but it's hard not to 10 this

**Stryxen** (10): she just knows how to sell a song ! the punchy synths and hooks on hooks delivered with an infectious audible smile. She just gets it….

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): more like surrender my wig

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): her bad girl era

**throwaway-7650** (10): #LETCARLYSAYFUCK

**TiltControls** (10): something about the production and songwriting makes this feels like a lost one direction song (affectionate)

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): honestly would easily be my 11 if it was like two minutes longer and had an insane buildup

**UselessTacooo** (10): SURENDA MA HAAAAAA IM OUT HEEEERE IN THEEE OPUNNNNNN

**wasian-invasion** (10): her best songwriting ever, something about it just captures my attention like no other Carly song

**flava** (9.5): the hype for this one was real

**Leixander** (9.5): that one gif of gretchen crying while smiling

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): this is just missing a little something to really reach its full potential because it's so short but also too long to be an intro. like maybe a proper final chorus since that end segment would be a decent bridge idk

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.2): disco darling wishes it could be this good

**queershoulder** (9.2): I think it such a great opener

**Ambrosia42** (9): a catchy bop

**ignitethephoenix** (9): cute opener!

**imbaby122** (9): i don’t need to be brave to talk about my not so perfect family, my absentee instagram influencer dad who named my half sister after melania trump is a conversation starter.

**JIRACHI** (9): the lyrics are so cute omg

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Carly really knows how to do an album opener

**skeeturz** (9): it's the perfect opener for the album, it's sweet soft and energetic and vulnerable. Absolute essential Carly Rae Jepsen

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.5): Overall a great track, but feels too short. The synths are just magnificent. Lyrics, THE LYRICS. She really grew since Emotion

**jasannn** (8.5): very standard carly in a good way but i wish this and Joshua Tree didn't end so abruptly

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (8): She says Fuck! Based album opener.

**akanewasright** (8): I think this song is good, but not in a “winner” way?

**alexismateofan** (8): i feel like the album had better openers but this still hits so good.

**apatel27** (8): Carly has a tried and tested formula but damn if it doesn't hit every time

**Awkward\_King** (8): carly practically invented basic synthpop as a genre for the gays she's allowed to do it lazily!!

**beeozan** (8): have little opinions on this song aside from it’s carly doing carly things and it works

**bogo** (8): first taylor and now carly proving that sometimes just saying “fuck” on a song is enough to make people lose their shit completely. i am not excluding myself from this i also lost my shit

**frogaranaman** (8): my personal ‘not so perfect family’ to introduce to men in my life is this rate comment

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): solid album opener

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it’s a great song but it’s not Carly great

**luckyphase** (8): it's not bad but I don't need this song

**therokinrolla** (8): I sincerely think I'd consider this her best song if it JUST had ONE more chorus. That outro after the second chorus just kills the track's momentum.

**vayyiqra** (8): I love synthpop 🍐

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I guess I like generic popheads synthpop track #3,832

pig-serpent: ## Mama told me I'd meet girls like you

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7.5): such a great album opener!

**scythersboots** (7.5): “I want to be brave enough to show you my not-so-perfect family” is such a sweet line. To me this song is Carly’s essence.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): this sounds exactly like at least 7 other Carly songs

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (7.3): hate as an opener but we move

**Aoquesth378** (7): A solid start to the album and lyrically I love it, but the pre-chorus feels dated. Very funky and fun though!

**camerinian** (7): I do like the sweetness of this, but like it's almost a bit too sanitized, like Christian pop level if I dare say it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this kind of feels CRJ-autopilot vibes

**Raindrac** (6): I've listened to this a couple times, but I can't quite say that it feels like single material. Carly's vocals are quite good, and there are some great moments in the verses, but the hook in the chorus just isn't anything spectacular.

**shckskndv** (6): I’m happy for her in the lyrics but I don’t revisit this a lot.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): oh looks its another carly rae jepsen song with a vaguely 80s sounding synth lead to it i have never heard this before in my life

**Nagisoid** (5): Carly really surrendered here huh, this is extremely boring and very plastic

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Don’t really like this one, something is off about the melody of the chorus. It doesn’t flow, it seems like she tried to fit too much into too little space.

**hikk** (11): I was admittedly left disappointed with Hold the Girl as a whole, as a massive fan of all of Rina’s prior work it felt like a pretty substantial step down for me. The exception of course is Frankenstein, which is just an unbelievable distillation of frentic energy packaged with insane drums and a chorus that makes me want to do backflips. It pairs well with the lyrical content but honestly she could be singing about literally anything and I’d still love this song because the production and melodies are just that crazy. Any song that goes for this style of no-holds-barred energy is super appealing to me and this is no exception. Upon the album release I looped this an embarrassing amount of times and it’s already one of my most played songs on lastfm across 5.5 years of data tracking. This would have been my personal rate winner obviously, so it’s a little disappointing to see it fall victim to Carly’s podium sweep, but I’m still proud of it for holding out against the competition and making it to #4!

**pig-serpent** (10): Halloween is the best holiday, and I love punk music, so of course the punk influenced song about Frankenstein was always going to be my favorite song on the album.  I sure hope someone will be submitting a rate with more Halloween music for the next rating cycle so that we can rate more Spooky songs like this one! 

 Congratulations to Carly Rae Jepsen on her 3rd rate win.  Frankenstein is the only song to never leave the top 5, quickly grabbing the number 4 slot and holding it for nearly the entire rate, putting up a barrier and counter attack on the Carlygeddon.  I was hoping this would knock a Carly song off the podium, but alas it came closer to falling to the eventual Anxious rise that came in the last week of the rate.  Still, breaking up a top 5 sweep is nothing to sneeze at and if any song deserved that it was this one, as it was my favorite non Charli winner pick.

pig-serpent: ## I <3 Frankenstein

**Ambrosia42** (11): Matt Tong ate the drums tf up omg. And the chorus is so good. PUT ME TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME!!

**camerinian** (11): any song that efficiently conveys panic has basically a shortcut to my 11 spot. What a fucking belter. What a rager. What an anthem for being at the bottom and just needing a primal scream for help from anybody. It’s loud and unashamed and ugly and read to throw down just to be able to get one leg up. Desperation at its finest.

**Nagisoid** (11): I think about the fact that some people in RYM argue this is "Deathrock" almost daily

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): remember when people were spreading rumors around that this was gonna be the uk’s entry for eurovision this year? in hindsight im kinda glad those rumors were fake because it would’ve been really embarrassing for me to rank this song below a drunk finnish manlet and two austrian girls singing about edgar allan poe

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): ended both the doctor and the monster and that frankie bitch from monster high too

**vexastrae** (11): we love asians who remake themselves into something wretched and abominable yet totally themselves YASS

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): Imagine not giving this a ten it's got everything: high BPM, self-destruction, and wicked guitars.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Honestly I love how she went all in with the rock influences in this album, perfect way to convey the lyrics.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this song is the reason why she's MOTHER and this album is great, and I got not a lot to say after.

**apatel27** (10): Big Mood in Self Hate

**bogo** (10): comes out of the gate sprinting and never looks back whew

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the outro could loop for 5 hours and i wouldnt get sick of it

**Frajer** (10): paws up Rina you'll always be a Monster

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is a deep cut but it could genuinely win the rate.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): best song of the album idc idc

**ImADudeDuh** (10): kill me just so you can build a person with my corpse QUEEN

**notarobot3675** (10): yeah this song RIPS

**oscarbrierley1** (10): she popped off on the halloween song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if Charli wasn't here this would be the easiest 11 ever

**ReallyCreative** (10): where was this energy for the rest of the album babe

**runaway3212** (10): frankenstein literally my fave book

**sarcasticsobs** (10): STEI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EI-EIN

**shhhneak** (10): OOOKKAAYY HEX GIRLS!!

**skeeturz** (10): this is classic rina IMO it's got just the right amount of edge and is an absolute bop

**throwaway-7650** (10): rate winner...?

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): should've been the eurovision song idc about deadlines or eurovision history

**UselessTacooo** (10): the Holy->Frankenstein run is seriously some of the best music I’ve ever heard. Sadly after here the album drops off a bit

**welcome2thejam** (10): If Rina wanted to do her version of 2000s Bloc Party, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, TV on the Radio, etc, from here on out, I would be all "you go, girl"

**xxipil0ts** (10): WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU [FOR EUROVISION]

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): i will never get over the drums in this song like she is so sexy for the bloc party inspo

**JIRACHI** (9.5): just remembered the eurovision rumors and got sad again so here's a -0.5 for you

**Aoquesth378** (9): I love how this song is structured and it holds up as one of the best on the album.

**Awkward\_King** (9): howd she make thriller gayer

**beeozan** (9): this song 🤝 Destroy Me by Rebecca Black in having a Firestarter moment

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Bobby Pickett’s Halloween song crown is secure, but this is a very nice addition to the holiday playlist!

**imbaby122** (9): hit number one on the Gay People’s Halloween Playlists charts

**queershoulder** (9): love this one so much

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.7): Back on track with a banger. The lyrical content is the strongest part of the song and the concept of Frankenstein used in this song is fantastic

**jman457** (8.7): This is for all the “I can fix him” gurlies

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): BIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH where has this been since the beginning of the album

**akanewasright** (8.5): not a highlight for me but it’s good

**frogaranaman** (8): I can see Scooby skanking to this

**nootnoot781** (8): docking two points because she teased about this going to eurovision when in fact it did not go to eurovision.

**phonethephoenix** (8): excellent concept

**scythersboots** (8): feels more balanced than some of the other uptempo tracks

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Just listened to the UK's Eurovision song… I understand why people are upset

**wasian-invasion** (8): Rina DISAVOWS gaga stans after free woman remix FLOPS

pig-serpent: ## Actually Frankenstein was the Doctor, not the monster

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): Pearl (2022)

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): i remember everyone really hyping this one up and it’s GOOD but i still wish it was more

**IIIHenryIII** (7): once again the chorus disappoints, she spent all her genius and money on the verses and forgot to invest in the choruses

**Leixander** (7): finally, a good song (the repetitive post chorus is meh though)

**sharts-n-farts** (7): The song sounds kinda cool but the lyrics are a little cliche for me.

**shckskndv** (7): “I was doing fine, till I hit rock bottom” oh?

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): I mean it's fine ig I don't get the hype

**just\_thonking** (6.5): the "I don't wanna be a monster anymore" is too corny for me sorry

**moonshxne** (6.4): i understand the track's appeal, but there's just a fundamental disconnect from the entire thing, as if i'm observing everything from the third person. it's probably a lot to do with the blown-out mix (again...*sighs*)

**uberpigeon** (6): this is very electra heart (derogatory)

**vayyiqra** (6): Kelela: take me apart Rina: put me together (think about it) 🫂

**Raindrac** (5): This is surprisingly danceable for a song with lyrics like these. I like it. And that drum breakdown at the end? Sweeeet. There's a little too much going on, though.

**Stryxen** (5): cool concept but the lyrics are all over the place and the instrumental is nothing special until the outro (really good). also the fact the structure is just… the same song plays twice with a really boring chorus (the i don’t wanna be a monster one) is dull

## But Victor was the real monster though

**impla77** (11): i will take the responsibility of being that one insufferable person- umm actually Frankenstein refers to Victor, not the monster!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): put me in the ‘actually it’s frankenstein’s monster’ category even if she addresses it in the post chorus

**reput4tionera** (10): did you know that frankenstein was actually the doc—

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Frankenstein was the doctor and Rina was the mother

**alexismateofan** (6): Frankenstein was the doctor, Frankenstein’s monster was the one responsible for the lyrics, most people don’t know this.

**nick1372** (6): okay yeah frankenstein was the doctor not the monster. I'm not really mad about some loyalty to the source material, just disappointed because it shows that Rina does not really interact with the Frankenstein concept beyond a the surface level.

pig-serpent: # Hold The Girl

---

**Overall Average**: 7.627 **// Average Controversy:** 2.009

---

hikk: I'm annoying and while I think the Rina EP and Sawayama are both essentially perfect projects, Hold The Girl is definitely a step down for me. It still has quite a few songs that I really enjoy and produced one of my new favourites from her, but the album's themes and general sonic direction just doesn't appeal to me, which is unfortunate but I still have faith in her as one of the brightest lights in pop music at this time. To be honest I thought this album would do a bit worse here, with some of the day 2 tracks being day 1 material in my mind, but in the end she also winds up with the highest non-Carly track as well. Good for her!

pig-serpent: I wasn’t kidding in my writeup when I called this a perfect album on paper, because I fully respect the vision and think that every song on this album had the potential to be amazing, but it just didn’t pan out in practice quite like it should have.  On top of the song-writing feeling just a little worse and less memorable than SAWAYAMA, my biggest issue with that album, the production, especially in relation to the guitars, has not improved on this album, and if anything, sounds far worse here.  Combined with a couple of power ballads that fall into one of my pet peeves, it took me a long time to see the good in this album, and while I’m glad I found it there still should have been much more to find.  Putting the “Follow up that failed to learn from the previous album’s flaws and was overall just a lower quality anyway” in the Disappointing Sub Favorites Rate.

**throwaway-7650** (10.008): making up for my sub-10 SAWAYAMA average with this (but seriously this album is way overhated and really not a huge step down from SAWAYAMA, ofc I get why this is less of a fave but y'all do TOO much!)

**apatel27** (9.577): Go read my [AOTY post](https://redd.it/10njflm) for more detailed thoughts on the songs.

**DirtyRat583** (9.538): i mean my flairs rina what do u expect (whoa exact average!! epic)

**Frajer** (9.385): I was a little late to the Rina train because I was not in the place to discover new music in Spring 2020 but she's undeniably talented

**bogo** (9.077): something clicked when i rated this and now i think it’s better than sawayama

**impla77** (8.954): I will be exceptionally biased here, but yeah.. I love this album, maybe because I love Rina as an artist, and she feeds my overuse of slay. Do I like SAWAYAMA more? Yes, and I can see how some are disappointed, but I still think this is a fantastic album!! And I saw her live (as I will probably expostulate upon loads in my comments) and I could go on for ages... I should be prepared to have my (minor) feelings hurt by these results

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.885): maybe if y'all tried unpacking some of your childhood trauma you'd get it idk

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.692): Probably the best album of the bunch here. So many great hooks and excellent production here. Tons of quality tunes. Is it better than SAWAYAMA? Definitely.

**phonethephoenix** (8.654): this album is so cohesive!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.615): this album has a lot of great hits in it specially tracks six up to ten, it's so well-made lyrically, sonically and I like the pop-rock tinge innit, mate.

**JIRACHI** (8.462): don't get the hate for this honestly it may not be SAWAYAMA but it's still on a very high level

**jman457** (8.400): Overhated album; has one of the best song tracks run ever and has a cathartic religious tramau moment.

**TiltControls** (8.385): Is it not as strong as SAWAYAMA? yes. Is it still a fantastic album? Also yes. It sounds a little too plucked right out of the 2000s for me to have hope for some of these songs, but I had a blast listening to it

**Aoquesth378** (8.308): 8 okay so this album would slay if it was in a rate by any other artist. I think there's some fantastic songs on the album and I don't think anything she put out would be as good as SAWAYAMA.

**luckyphase** (8.300): This album was weird for me because I found a lot of it forgettable but there are some songs I listen to so much that I will remember them years from now. I liked it best when Rina leaned into the NIN sounds.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.223): I too was kinda impartial towards this album when it dropped, but over time I've come to appreciate it for nailing what it aims for. But Rina, please try and improve your lyricism for the next project xo

**camerinian** (8.115): this album is definitely a lot more uneven than Sawayama but after I saw her live and seeing how much she described it as a therapy album, I get the feeling this was one she needed to make just to project everything she’d been holding on to, and for that I’m grateful. We definitely got a lot of great bops out of it too, so that’s a nice bonus.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.000): This is Breakaway (Rina’s Version)
[/r/popheads/comments/13o1r7t/2022_ultimate_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_3_are/jl2neo6/]

=====

pig-serpent: **shipperondeck** (7.938): some of the highest highs but definitely has the most of the lows

**akanewasright** (7.923): now that the layers of disappointment have settled, can we admit that this album is kinda pretty good on its own terms? Comparing it to Sawayama does it no favors, but her voice is stronger than ever and fits the more AC musical direction really well, and a lot of the songs actually are fantastic. Imo, the opening and closing tracks are kinda bad, but everything else kinda hits

**flava** (7.923): Well I’m mostly doing this rate for her (and to keep the streak alive), this album has problems, mostly with its production which feels compressed as fuck and can’t match the emotional weight Hold The Girl goes for, and not every swing for the fence is earned. But its reconciliation with feelings of being groomed, queerness and loss of religion is captivating nonetheless and when the album hits, it fucking hits. If we were to put this album’s problems aside, it’d probably be on par with SAWAYAMA, but we can’t just ignore 33% of an album’s very real issues, it wouldn’t be fair to the other subs faves and Tove Lo

**wasian-invasion** (7.885): I didn't really revisit it for a few months after the initial listen and I don't think it's as much of a masterpiece as Sawayama but it's definitely grown on me. Each new listen I appreciate how biographical Rina's lyrics are and how she unloads all her trauma and lived experience over a whole variety of production styles

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.846): to me, a vastly underrated album with some of rina's best songwriting that many twitter gays hated just cuz it didn't have the beep boop synths in it. don't get me wrong, i'm a sawayama era pixel till the day i die, but the response to this album was sooooo dramatic in spite of it having some absolutely excellent songs on it, having only a few overall duds, and being pretty much her most cohesive project to date. not to mention going all the way off live. this girl is held, why aren't you?

**sarcasticsobs** (7.800): Rina + Clarence Clarity is very much my taste, and but idk what happened here, it's just not really the same even though he's here over 75% of the time, and it just did not hit much overall (my average might seem a bit high despite me saying that, but it's really kinda saved by one stretch that I really love. I don't really return to this record). Matty Healy, you will pay for this for some reason.

**dreamingpastel** (7.769): Listen. Do I find the phrase "healing my inner child" overused and annoying? Yes. But am I also a sentimental sap at heart? Also yes.

**xxipil0ts** (7.754): this isn't the album i used to introduce my straight cousin after seeing Akira but would reconsider

**nick1372** (7.654): I don't know why Rina released all the 2000s throwback songs as singles when this album is actually very diverse in sound and the experimental songs are some of the highlights of the album. Maybe if Holy was a single instead of Phantom y'all would realize that this is just as good as SAWAYAMA.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.654): all of the songs are elevated by their bridges. im a bit critical of some of the songs that sound too similar because the japanese bonus track, flavour of the month, is a bop and shouldve taken one of their places.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.654): An album that definitely feels uneven, but it’s highlights are definitely emotional and/or awesome bangers. Those rousing mid-tempo songs are good in moderation but could have cut some imo

**notarobot3675** (7.646): I am a big Rina fan but this album left me wanting. There are some real gems here (Holy - Frankenstein run... she was crazy for that), but a lot of this album felt too safe for me.

**imbaby122** (7.615): i don’t have much to say about this album other than that i was disappointed by it. i love the theme of healing your inner child, but i think the execution was very cringe and corny, and kind of disney channel. healing is great, but the songs felt really idealistic, especially as a whole. production wise the album is fine, but i think that the y2k r&b and pop sounds of her first two projects is much more her lane than the 2000s rock and country inspirations of hold the girl. i love rina, and i love that the album was healing for her, but i just can’t connect with it.

**ricki** (7.485): if you're BRAVE it's because you can SLAY 🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸🎸

**alexismateofan** (7.462): I knew so very little about Rina entering this album, I only have heard one of her songs but it was absolutely a banger, so I was pretty positive entering this one too. Lots of great tracks on here and one I’ll be coming back to for sure.

**shhhneak** (7.315): Sellout (derogatory)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.192): topping sawayama is basically an impossible feat yes, but damn this is a really solid follow up. a few flops for sure, but the tracks here that i love i REALLY love, and i love how rina can pull off just about any genre and sound natural at it.

**vayyiqra** (6.923): Feeling awful about not engaging with this album further because I like Rina as a person (even with her kinda-cringe internet posting) and paid a lot of money to see her live (well, mostly because of Hana but still) and like a lot of her music but this album did not interest me so I never gave it a chance and now it's too late to let it grow on me so sorry to its stans I will try to be sweet [update: liked it more than I thought! I'm thankful] 🫂

**ImADudeDuh** (6.885): It’s really sad that this is one of the most 7/10 albums for me because she definitely put a lot of her heart into this but it just.. doesn’t hit for me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.846): Y'all ever hear an album you dislike so much it makes you wonder why you fell in love with the artist in the first place? Ok no Hold The Girl isn't that bad, it's a perfectly fine album, but omg this was such a disappointment to listen to compared with SAWAYAMA, it just feels like it has so much less… idk, heart? SAWAYAMA was unique, influenced by Rina's cultural heritage, had some great lyrics, it ROCKED (literally), but this just doesn't feel like it has the same amount of personality… And can we talk about this production? Idk if it's just me but it sounds so low-end-heavy and muddy? ESPECIALLY This Hell. That's just one more thing that takes away the magic that this album could have had. It's just a bunch of missed opportunities, down to that ugly-ass cover. tl;dr: 6/10 girl not held

**Stryxen** (6.846): volta

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.823): if you are BRAVE it’s because you can SLAY

**lexiaredery** (6.692): There are some really good moments on this album but then it completely falls off at the end.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.654): I was not a big fan of this when it came out. I felt like I had heard all of these songs before. They all sounded very familiar. To this day, when I listen to some of these, I find myself trying to find out where I know some of the melodies/sounds from. Anyway, it has grown on me since the release, but it was a step down after SAWAYAMA.

**cremeebrulee** (6.623): i don't really love this album but i do respect it a lot.... it's incredibly cohesive and has a clear visions, but it's just not sonically for me at times. honestly, i find it a little hard to listen to because of the lyrical content sometimes. it makes me believe that this was more an album for her than it was for her fans? idk i really hope that releasing it has helped process some of the trauma she’s mentioned, it seems like she's been carrying it around for some time

**prettybirbkotori** (6.423): i hate that i don’t like this album much because it’s clearly so special to rina but it’s just sonically played out

**ktajlili** (6.346): I remember when this came out I kind of agreed with what everyone was saying about this. While I think there are good moments and even better songs, I kind of feel like Rina bit off a bit more than she could chew. I liked the idea of eschewing pop trends in favor of music styles closer to what Rina grew up with, but I don't think she 100% pulls it off. The sound of her first album was unique and really felt like her, and this style just pales in comparison for me. I think it comes down to the individual songs not being as good.

=====

pig-serpent: **Nagisoid** (6.231): Let's get the elephant in the room out. Both the RINA EP and SAWAYAMA are way better than this. Now we can evaluate this taking these factors out of the picture. It's a mixed bag. The pop rock/adult contemporary cuts are way too inconsistent for what they are trying to be, and as much as this is a dead horse, the sequence from tracks 6-9 grab your attention way more than anything else on here, like I'm surprised she didn't just try to make an entire project out of similar songs. As much as I can relate to the lyrics, they aren't thought out all that well and honestly feel too broad and even short sighted to me, in my personal opinion. Unrelated, but the album cover sucks and in a cruel twist of fate any of the single covers would have both fit better and been more aesthetically pleasing. I'm starting a prayer circle for her continuing the industrial rock of her song for the John Wick soundtrack, but I'll keep listening even if she releases covers of the Bluey soundtrack or whatever.

**just\_thonking** (6.154): Album cover is great idc idc

**moonshxne** (5.969): Rina I'm so sorry 😭 but this record just leaves me so confounded. Back when the initial singles first dropped, I remember feeling bewildered with how the songs all had fleeting moments of potential brilliance but ultimately came out derivative and faceless, if not incongruous. Looking back, I'm often too distracted by the strikingly overblown and "microwaved plastic"-sounding mixes to even really think about the compositions and incorporated genres, much less the lyrics! The mixing in *SAWAYAMA* was questionable too, but whereas it just felt like minor nuisances there, it's actively wreaking havoc and ruining songs here.

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.962): look, I haven’t really been tempted to revisit this album. It always felt like an album a solo X-Factor winner would release, negative connotations and all. Coming back to it, I think a lot of heart was put into it but it isn’t reflected in the production- Rina is trying her best but the production just falls flat. This album is just too ambitious for its own good.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.869): Coming back to this I've realised that with the exception of the title track, I do really like the singles from this album, but apart from that there's just not really much here. There are more lower lows than I remember as well and quite a few tracks that just feel very nothing. There have always been a few of those tracks in Rina's discography (Chosen Family is NOT one of them smh) and I wouldn't call this an entirely unexpected downturn in form for her, her output has steadily been getting worse and worse for me, but there are moments on this album that show that she can be a really good songwriter and I'm far from giving up on her, but it's just a bit of a disappointing album and not always in the most interesting way.

**hikk** (10): If there's one thing Carly can always nail it's an album opener. RAWM, Julien, This Love Isn't Crazy, and now this all rank among my absolute faves from her. It resonates lyrically, and her vocals deliver them convincingly. It's her tried and true brand of synthpop done extremely well, and she even says FUCK oh neptune! This found its way to #3 early on and just stayed there, which is fine by me. She also ends up with the podium sweep, and now all that's left is to see which of Talking To Yourself or The Loneliest Time will take the crown!

**pig-serpent** (9): A nice wash of synths playing punchy chord changes while Carly serenades you.  The synthwave stylings add a nice dash of momentum, and it's the perfect combo of energetic and relaxed to be a great song.  Maybe not great enough to grab 3rd place and sit there the entire rate though, there are def a lot of other songs (including a few Carly songs) I would’ve liked to see here instead but this is more of an anti-carly sweep gripe than one against the song.

pig-serpent: ## Brave Enough for Everything

**nick1372** (11): oh man. ohhhh man. oh boy.

**saviorARMY101** (11): SHE SAID FUCK

**slimboyfriend** (11): it’s run away with me it’s real love it’s this love isn’t crazy it’s that one to two songs she slots into every album to remind everyone that she’s the vulnerable yet bold girl who blessed us with Emotion and could make another Emotion if she wanted but she doesn’t want to

**thedoctordances1940** (11): This reminds me of why I did (and to an extent still do?) love Carly. Shame about everything that comes after it

**1998tweety** (10): she ate this

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I can’t even make joke comments with this album, it’s so beautiful

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is, soo good, so great that the demo is better that almost a of the other songs in this rate, I love the vulnerability she made us felt with this song.

**bigbigbee** (10): when she got JANE KRAKOWSKI for the MV for this I died…like…I see the vision…this album is just Theatre, you normies wouldn’t get it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is currently my most played song ever according to last.fm. DESERVED.

**bloodjet** (10): just a beautiful reminder to be honest!

**cremeebrulee** (10): a lot of my favorite songs of all time are about being emotionally closed off so the fact that i love this song is kinda out of character… the line “i wanna be brave enough to show you my not so perfect family” like damn she gets it....

**CrimsonROSET** (10): her renting out a theater for the mv iconic

**dreamingpastel** (10): The magic behind all my favorite Carly songs is how the song builds up to a huge chorus, and this is no exception. One thing I do want to point out that makes it stand out from the rest is that there's a tinge of sadness mixed with hope. It's the perfect song for the ending of a romance movie, when the couple finally gets together.

**impla77** (10): Carly really just dropped a fuck and moved on with her life.. take notes Taylor

**jman457** (10): A perfect album opener, just a nice synthpop tune

**just\_thonking** (10): Hearing this le*k changed my life

**modulum83** (10): the lyrics on this song knocked me on my ass and made me rethink my entire attitude towards myself and my romantic partners. thank you queen!

**notarobot3675** (10): her album openers are always iconic

**oscarbrierley1** (10): this song becomes more amazing to me every time i listen to it. for some reason the music video is when it first really clicked for me, it sent it from like a seven or eight to a ten.

**prettybirbkotori** (10): a perfect opener i still regret missing the tickets to the broadway version

**ReallyCreative** (10): the woman knows how to open an album

**reput4tionera** (10): she said fuck

**runaway3212** (10): me after seeing a guy for 5 seconds

**sarcasticsobs** (10): This probably would be a blast live

**seanderlust** (10): i absolutely love the vulnerability on this track coupled with the dancey atmosphere

**shhhneak** (10): This is so Britney Spears comeback coded.

**shipperondeck** (10): it's like my lowest 10 but it's hard not to 10 this

**Stryxen** (10): she just knows how to sell a song ! the punchy synths and hooks on hooks delivered with an infectious audible smile. She just gets it….

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): more like surrender my wig

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): her bad girl era

**throwaway-7650** (10): #LETCARLYSAYFUCK

**TiltControls** (10): something about the production and songwriting makes this feels like a lost one direction song (affectionate)

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): honestly would easily be my 11 if it was like two minutes longer and had an insane buildup

**UselessTacooo** (10): SURENDA MA HAAAAAA IM OUT HEEEERE IN THEEE OPUNNNNNN

**wasian-invasion** (10): her best songwriting ever, something about it just captures my attention like no other Carly song

**flava** (9.5): the hype for this one was real

**Leixander** (9.5): that one gif of gretchen crying while smiling

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): this is just missing a little something to really reach its full potential because it's so short but also too long to be an intro. like maybe a proper final chorus since that end segment would be a decent bridge idk

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.2): disco darling wishes it could be this good

**queershoulder** (9.2): I think it such a great opener

**Ambrosia42** (9): a catchy bop

**ignitethephoenix** (9): cute opener!

**imbaby122** (9): i don’t need to be brave to talk about my not so perfect family, my absentee instagram influencer dad who named my half sister after melania trump is a conversation starter.

**JIRACHI** (9): the lyrics are so cute omg

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Carly really knows how to do an album opener

**skeeturz** (9): it's the perfect opener for the album, it's sweet soft and energetic and vulnerable. Absolute essential Carly Rae Jepsen

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.5): Overall a great track, but feels too short. The synths are just magnificent. Lyrics, THE LYRICS. She really grew since Emotion

**jasannn** (8.5): very standard carly in a good way but i wish this and Joshua Tree didn't end so abruptly

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (8): She says Fuck! Based album opener.

**akanewasright** (8): I think this song is good, but not in a “winner” way?

**alexismateofan** (8): i feel like the album had better openers but this still hits so good.

**apatel27** (8): Carly has a tried and tested formula but damn if it doesn't hit every time

**Awkward\_King** (8): carly practically invented basic synthpop as a genre for the gays she's allowed to do it lazily!!

**beeozan** (8): have little opinions on this song aside from it’s carly doing carly things and it works

**bogo** (8): first taylor and now carly proving that sometimes just saying “fuck” on a song is enough to make people lose their shit completely. i am not excluding myself from this i also lost my shit

**frogaranaman** (8): my personal ‘not so perfect family’ to introduce to men in my life is this rate comment

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): solid album opener

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it’s a great song but it’s not Carly great

**luckyphase** (8): it's not bad but I don't need this song

**therokinrolla** (8): I sincerely think I'd consider this her best song if it JUST had ONE more chorus. That outro after the second chorus just kills the track's momentum.

**vayyiqra** (8): I love synthpop 🍐

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I guess I like generic popheads synthpop track #3,832

pig-serpent: ## You mean you wish to surrender to me?  Very well, I accept!

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7.5): such a great album opener!

**scythersboots** (7.5): “I want to be brave enough to show you my not-so-perfect family” is such a sweet line. To me this song is Carly’s essence.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): this sounds exactly like at least 7 other Carly songs

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (7.3): hate as an opener but we move

**Aoquesth378** (7): A solid start to the album and lyrically I love it, but the pre-chorus feels dated. Very funky and fun though!

**camerinian** (7): I do like the sweetness of this, but like it's almost a bit too sanitized, like Christian pop level if I dare say it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this kind of feels CRJ-autopilot vibes

**Raindrac** (6): I've listened to this a couple times, but I can't quite say that it feels like single material. Carly's vocals are quite good, and there are some great moments in the verses, but the hook in the chorus just isn't anything spectacular.

**shckskndv** (6): I’m happy for her in the lyrics but I don’t revisit this a lot.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): oh looks its another carly rae jepsen song with a vaguely 80s sounding synth lead to it i have never heard this before in my life

**Nagisoid** (5): Carly really surrendered here huh, this is extremely boring and very plastic

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Don’t really like this one, something is off about the melody of the chorus. It doesn’t flow, it seems like she tried to fit too much into too little space.

**hikk** (9): I was not expecting much from a soundtrack song but Rina actually did a really good job with this and I would say I like it more than a fair chunk of Hold the Girl. It’s still not her best obviously but it’s very catchy and well produced, I can’t ask for more when I have the lowest expectations for these sort of songs.

**pig-serpent** (6): I love the idea of Rina doing some sultry bar rock, but this isn’t hitting for me.  The mixing sounds off, and the chorus is stuck halfway between sexy James Bond theme and intimidating rock song and as a result her vocals feel like they’re fighting against the instrumental rather than working with it.  In hindsight I wish I scored this lower.

---

##Baba Yaga

**AHSWeeknd** (10): when doesn’t Rina kill it tho?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this song should blow up and give MOTHER the Top40 hit in BBH100 that she deserves.

**beeozan** (10): this is like the good version of the Demi song in jukebox, she's coming for the Oscar win

**CrimsonROSET** (10): when charli has half the bonus rate and she still loses then what

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this SLAYS me

**DirtyRat583** (10): ill meet you in the alterlife (stream, immediately)

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): heard this in imax and hell yeah

**Nagisoid** (10): Head Like a Hole (Rina's Version)

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): she was so fawkin good in john wick 4

**shipperondeck** (10): this song reminds me a lot of hiroyuki sanada (served cunt and died)

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): she makes revenge sound so fun

**throwaway-7650** (10): rina main actress girl era incoming YUP

**UselessTacooo** (10): WHY IS THIS HER BEST SONG EVER LIKE

**Aoquesth378** (9): WHAT A BANGER, I'm obsessed.

**Frajer** (9): all pop girlies should write a Bond theme

**imbaby122** (9): my republican grandma has probably heard this song. she’s obsessed with john wick (and guns).

**impla77** (9): now I really need a Rina Bond song (that would be SO SLAY)

**plastichaxan** (9): Akira spin-off when

**queershoulder** (9): movie star icon

**runaway3212** (9): boringcore but rina made it this time

**skeeturz** (9): this was really fun

**TiltControls** (9): I love Rina Sawayama's John Wick 4

**vayyiqra** (9): We need more of this 90s industrial-ish alternative banger

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): kinda better than the majority of Hold The Girl, oops!

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (8): It's such a good movie track.

**alexismateofan** (8): rina should be the new john wick i’m so serious

**Awkward\_King** (8): with this song rina is only 4 awards away from an EGOT <3

**bogo** (8): i didn’t click with this on first listen but i just get it now

**moonshxne** (8): there's just a nearly insurmountable impedance mismatch from implying that "seeing wick tonight", a ridiculously stereotypical m\*n-oriented activity, is yass & slay

**RandomHypnotica** (8): N I 4 N I

**static\_int\_husp** (8): this is better than a lot of HTG songs, which is a low bar but I'll take it

**Stryxen** (8): (ate)

**thatplatypus99** (8): the way this is better than 2/3 of hold the girl😭

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): listen sorry I've never watched John wick but this seems like a great song for those movies! lmao

**DrumBeatGlass** (7.5): It will take some time till I fully appreciate the track, but go girl!

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): hammurabi main pop girl

**sarcasticsobs** (7.3): BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics' Choice Award, and Oscar winner Rina Sawayama (I haven't seen this movie as of this rating)

## Makes the whole world blind

**akanewasright** (7): I still need to see the John Wicks

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): rina finding out that sub faves would have a bonus rate and sweating to release something quickly because she knew she didnt have any loosies that were eligible for rating

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I was contemplating the idea of seeing the movie because of her, but after listening to the song I lost all interest. I believe she was able to capture the plot perfectly within the lyrics, and it doesn't look very interesting.

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): this just SOUNDS like a move tie in. good for her getting her bag tho

**DaHumanTorch** (6.3): cute song and she devoured in this movie, like wow. debut role and everything

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): perfectly fine

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Can’t say I’m in love with this song but I will be seeing the movie and supporting future Oscar winner Rina Sawayama!

**shckskndv** (6): it’s kind of cool hearing Rina, this super left-of-field artist, on a movie fodder track, bcus you can imagine what she’ll sound like if she goes full mainstream.

**Ambrosia42** (5.5): It’s decent, but it still hasn’t really grown on me after a few listens

**shhhneak** (5.5): The locals got our girl.

**apatel27** (5): The chorus sounds like Trap of Love

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): the instrumental is bonkers but the song itself feels just like standard action movie soundtrack fare. sorry rina luv u

**reput4tionera** (3): this is too theater kid for me

**hikk** (9): Here’s our bonus rate winner! It wouldn’t be my choice but I still really like it and it is well deserved. Nowadays I often find myself bored by edm collabs like this even if that was literally the basis of the first rate I ever hosted, but thankfully Charli’s charisma comes through and Tiesto’s production, while certainly nothing crazy, isn’t uninteresting enough to ruin the song.

**pig-serpent** (9): Easily my favorite of the bonus tracks and it’s the correct winner.  It’s just a bouncy bop and Tiesto’s production has a ton of energy to it that carries the song through its short run time.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): get that TikTok coin Charli

**akanewasright** (9): Tiësto kinda didn’t miss last year tbh

**Frajer** (9): this sounds like someone made an AI Charli song to play in the background of a movie without having to pay royalties but it also slaps

**jasannn** (9): I love it when my underrated faves get a minor tik tok hit

**Nagisoid** (9): Charli's going to cause global warming at this point by overusing the word "hot"

**nick1372** (9): Why was this not a huge hit

**Stryxen** (9): YASSSS

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): the way tik tok ignored her whole album for this clip

**shipperondeck** (7): the fact that charli obtains musical success pretty easily outside of her own music will never not be funny

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): hot girl…hot in it…im starting to get the sense that charli might be a little bit overheated

**TiltControls** (7): for some reason i only associate tiesto with the hit late 2000s mobile game series tap tap revenge

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Not even Charli could drag Tiesto's corpse across the line to "Good Song"

**DrumBeatGlass** (1): lyrics are awful, sge thought she ate

**hikk** (10): So... by not very much at all Talking To Yourself loses the rate. This is a song I really love so I would have been happy to see it take the win, but something about it does just give slightly less Winner Energy to me than The Loneliest Time title track. I think it's just a little too quintessentially Carly - executed to perfection, for sure, but nothing novel for her in the slightest. As I mentioned in my writeup for Constant Repeat, recent ongoings in my life have provided a prime opportunity for me to consume a song like this that allows me to feel catharsis in being a little bit bitter and conceited for just a moment... the song is punchy in both production and vocal delivery, with a highlight surely being that pause before the -SELF! I was honestly surprised how close it came to winning, and it did nearly snatch the crown, but in the end it just wasn't enough...

**pig-serpent** (10): Carly's best songs are special not in the sense that they're super unique songs that only she could make, but rather like anyone could kind of write them, but Carly's the one who perfected the idea.  Bombastic, catchy songs that never feel flashy or show-offy.  Talking To Yourself is yet another example of all of these qualities, and another fantastic addition to Carly's best songs. The lyrics might be some of my favorite Carly lyrics too; the chorus is filled with a ton of polite little jabs, that coyly refer to tiny details of someone’s life following  a break up and like… yeah, I wonder if I would continue talking to my ex after she moves on and out of my life.

And even though I like this song more than the title track, this song almost feels too basic to be a rate winner?  I’m not sure if that makes sense, but while the lack of specialness makes the song amazing, I’m happy to see a song that does feel special take the crown.  Either way, this is a super deserving addition to our 9+ averages list.

pig-serpent: ## Reaching for you

**DaHumanTorch** (11): pop perfection if i've ever heard it and one of my favorite carly songs to date

**imbaby122** (11): only three words needed to justify my 11. talking to your….SELF.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): THE Smashaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): a career high light honestly

**vayyiqra** (11): I love this song! Peak Carly! 🍐

**1998tweety** (10): pop pefection

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): This is also my favorite sorry imagine being in the room when they choose this lineup.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): With every album Carly makes that one song that @‘s me directly

**akanewasright** (10): this is basically Carly playing the greatest hits sonically, but GOD her comfort zone rules

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I really, really love this song and how it made me dance whenever I play it.

**alexismateofan** (10): this song serves. It just serves. Like you look at it and you nod because you know it serves. It’s IT. IT’S THE ONE. Like this would be the best track on so many other albums and it’s like only one of a few on a Carly album.

**Ambrosia42** (10): yeah this went on playlists immediately when I heard it the first time

**apatel27** (10): That last chorus 👌

**beeozan** (10): The guitars in the post chorus are so good!! or should I say pre bridge

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I have yet to see someone on the popheads subreddit or discord who dislikes this song. I’m sure there are a few of them out there, and they’re just too ashamed to show themselves, as they should be.

**bogo** (10): SLAYYYYYYYYYYY

**buddhacharm** (10): So embarrassing how I was at the mezzanine barrier when I saw her live and I was literally SLUTDROPPING... like I'm still feeling the humiliation like half a year later

**camerinian** (10): the one second pause before resolving the chorus is such a cheap trick and my chimp brain falls for it every single time and hold on I've got a tick in my hair I need to eat

**cocosairdep** (10): BOP

**DirtyRat583** (10): me when i talk to myself (something is seriously amiss)

**impla77** (10): MEGABOP. Nearly lost my mind when this was played live

**jasannn** (10): slaying to yourslay

**JIRACHI** (10): one thing about Carly she knows how to eat a pop record my god. that little pause in between yourself is so motherly.

**kwcty6888** (10): the beat before “self” always gets me when trying to sing along

**Leixander** (10): bottled lightning

**memezaharamole** (10): that beat in between the 'your...' and ...self, self' is superb, can't get enough.

**Nagisoid** (10): She made a song for the dissociating girlies ❤️

**prettybirbkotori** (10): this is like the platonic ideal of a pop song

**queershoulder** (10): BOP!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me using a random discord bot's DM's as a testing ground

**ReallyCreative** (10): call her a squatter because Carly's living rent free in this poor man's head

**reput4tionera** (10): kunt

**runaway3212** (10): me every night

**saviorARMY101** (10): BANGER

**seanderlust** (10): the delay on "talking to your...self" invented delayed gratification

**shesdoingyoga** (10): My favorite single from the rollout, it’s very much just a typical pop song but Carly does that so well

**shhhneak** (10): Ironic that she’s basically screaming at the top of her lungs throughout this entire song.

**shipperondeck** (10): incredible

**skeeturz** (10): an absolute fun song that showcases her strengths all around IMO, the chorus is absolute bliss

**Stryxen** (10): …SELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): listening to this to the first time was like getting bashed in the face by a large homosexual sledgehammer

**TiltControls** (10): though it's not my 11, it might be the most fun I had listening to a song last year

**welcome2thejam** (10): Yeah, this got that classic Carly bop spirit

**cremeebrulee** (9.9): love a well-placed pause like that “talking to your . SELF!” is so scrumptious

**phonethephoenix** (9.9): I think this song is just a hair shy of perfect

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): bop

**nick1372** (9.5): funniest pause in the middle of a word in music history

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): spiteful bitterness looks good on her

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): the way a lower-tier carly synthbop is still miles ahead of most people... that's what happens when your catalog is too strong

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (9): no but fr is he thinking of me does he talk to me when he talks to himself

**CrimsonROSET** (9): antititititititici

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): omg is her ex neurodivergent

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I feel like this is on here because she listened to the rest of the album and decided she wanted something a bit more traditional to please the pop fans and you know what? She was right to do so.

**ktajlili** (9): why doesn't pitchfork like this it's such a bop

**luckyphase** (9): it was originally lower but i rounded up because I might really like it in a few years and I don't want to frustrate my future self

**plastichaxan** (9): I’ll never forget that time someone said she writes from the gay experience cause there’s always a song like this that proves it

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): didn't stand out to me initially, but has grown on me exponentially and goes OFF live

**uberpigeon** (9): this is like a faggier version of "TAKE MY BREATH (pause)... AWAY!!"

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Carly is the master of cute bops

pig-serpent: ## I'm sorry, but they've moved on

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Sonically, it’s Now That I Found You Part II, and Now That I Found You was just Higher Part II, so this song is also Higher Part III

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.4): Bombastic, wasn't into it at first. Now even this cut in the chorus doesn't bother me

**jman457** (8.3): Interesting lyrics, cool beat

**IIIHenryIII** (8): catchy as hell

**shckskndv** (8): bog standard Carly track & that’s a good thing

**throwaway-7650** (8): and when I say this is the worst TLT single with EASE

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): initially I really really liked this track but I do now find the chorus a bit underwhelming I feel like it could be quite a bit better, but it is still good

**Aoquesth378** (7.5): Okay so it wasn't my favorite song when I first listened to it but it grew on me and it was on heavy rotation because of the addictive beat and strong melody.

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): I think this is good??

**modulum83** (7): tbh this sounds like something i’d hear in between the chainsmokers and sia on the radio in 2016. it's good, but overrated.

**Raindrac** (7): On my first couple of listens, I didn't really get this song. But during my third listen, it clicked a little. An energetic beat and some wonderfully bitter lyrics about an ex always pair up to create something pretty good. I'm not sure how much I'll return to this, but it's certainly not bad.

**sharts-n-farts** (7): This song is kinda boring on a re-listen.

**Awkward\_King** (6): idk why i hated this, like i genuinely cant remember. its so inoffensive sjdsj, the chorus is a little annoying but like i needed to grow up fr

**bigbigbee** (6): When I was 13 I had to go to the bat mitzvah of a girl I barely knew and didn’t know any of her friends either, so I went outside, pretended to be on my cell phone, and had an entire conversation with myself

**hikk** (10): It wouldn't be a Carly rate without a little oversharing would it? In the time preceding this rate and for most of while it was open, I was in a romantic situation that, while admittedly was short-lived in the grand scheme of things, was beyond effervescent and like nothing that I had experienced before. I speak in the past tense here because unfortunately it was broken off by the other party, which absolutely shattered me. I feel like there's a special kind of sadness that is spawned from something like this not working out - a relationship that was still in its early stages, but regardless shone brighter than you could ever imagine. That sort of instant mutual infatuation that feels absolutely unreal, where you click with this person you've known for barely any time as if you've been friends for years. While it may seem like no big deal compared to a breakup from a real, long-term relationship, knowing that the seeds were sown for what easily could have blossomed into something truly beautiful only for it to end before that could be experienced is just so, so incredibly disappointing. I've gone through the motions over the past few weeks processing this, and the times where I'm bitter over being dropped like a rock despite knowing that I still haunt him have been soundtracked by our runner-up here, and as cathartic as Talking To Yourself is for me, it's this song that has been feeding my dramatic delusions of hoping someday he'll wake up and realize what he threw away and we can have our fairytale stage play moment. The iconic bridge describes the situation quite perfectly actually, because although reaching the moon so quickly felt amazing, the issue arose of him not thinking that through enough. I had written a draft of this comment a bit ago that was far more pathetic and longing, but at this point in time I can feel myself reaching a better headspace as I realize my self-worth. That being said however, to say I haven't spent time daydreaming about getting that notification of being reached out to again or having some miraculous reuniting meeting in public would definitely be lying. The Loneliest Time provides a perfect "what if" soundscape, painting a vivid picture of the rekindling of a relationship that, in retrospect, was too good to simply leave as is. There's certainly no shortage of Carly songs to fit the tragic gay romantic experience, but this one just might be the zenith of her collection of tracks in this genre, and it's certainly very apt for me, in this moment. The rational part of me realizes that he's not leaving the light on for me though, and I think this is a good time to recognize that wallowing in these absurd fantasies isn't helping me heal. This song having such an impact me is such a testament to Carly's ability to capture that magic within just a few minutes, and I really do think that, despite it being the obvious winner contender, it's also absolutely the correct winner. For me, as one of this rate's hosts, I'm happy to give this song its well-deserved flowers now while it's so relevant to my current situation, but additionally I'm hoping that as we close out this rate I can also close this chapter for myself. It might be a while before I can healthily listen to this track again, but I’m at peace with that.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): And we have our rate winner!  Was there ever any doubt?  Because actually, it blew a 30 point lead and almost lost to Talking To Yourself before pulling back again and winning by half a point.  It was a ton of fun to watch at the very end, even if we didn’t get that tie I was hoping for.  

Honestly, despite my own preference for Talking To Yourself, I feel like this song is probably the better winner of the two.  It’s obvious what makes this song special to so many people, even if it’s the type of song I could see myself loving in certain situations more than loving in a general sense.  If I heard this while on a roller skating date, for instance, it would probably get a 14 from me and I would join everyone who was clamoring for it to take the W.  Even with all that said, there were a few low scoring comments that had some really good points and I can totally understand their perspective, and I just wanted to say I really appreciated reading your comments.

pig-serpent: ## Their loneliness is coming to an end!

**beeozan** (11): This song makes me think of how dude was complaining Rufus was higher in PH charts than Bad Bunny. Bad Bunny was so robbed but this song is so nice, everything just clicks from the start (seriously, the drums in the first verse are enough to get me dancing) and then it just escalates from there in the best way possible.

**bigbigbee** (11): I listened to this on loop when my flight from Seoul to Dallas was delayed by 3 hours and I was going to miss my connection from Dallas to home for Thanksgiving. So as much as I love it, it is also associated with one of the most stressful days of my life. Good news tho, flights are so fucked lately that my connection from Dallas home was ALSO delayed by like three hours so I did actually get home in time to smash some pie and fall asleep on my uncle’s couch

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Remembering the like half a day when I thought this was going to be a legitimate hit on Tik Tok...take me back to that headspace.

**bloodjet** (11): have you ever thought to yourself 'if i only i did x, my life wouldn't be shit like how it is now'? for me, this song perfectly encapsulates that feeling

**CrimsonROSET** (11): the only male feature on the rate being in the winner what does that say about the discourse

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): I know saying “wow how wasn’t this a big hit” is beating a horse that’s been dead since EMOTION, but wow how wasn’t this a big hit

**IIIHenryIII** (11): she might have fucked up Charli’s business with the devil and made her own deal to craft this masterpiece

**ImADudeDuh** (11): she detached her pussy and he detached his pussy and they put both ENTIRELY into this song

**JIRACHI** (11): just because of that bridge you are 11 as fuck

**MasterWizardRyan** (11): now why could this not have got the TikTok boost that Made You Look got?

**modulum83** (11): the difference between the loneliest time and the other 3 albums here is that i genuinely believe carly rae jepsen has experienced what joy feels like

**musical\_pyn** (11): literally everything I could want from a pop song and then some

**ricki** (11): i usually shoot for tiktok but when this blew up and the app consensus was that "the bridge was the only good part of the song" it made me want to go to testify in favor of shutting the app down

**scythersboots** (11): catchy as hell, idk why it didn’t blow up (more than it did, ig)

**shckskndv** (11): in contrast to the TikTok times, where bridges are being sacrificed for song brevity, we need to celebrate our proud rhythm nation’s great bridges.

**welcome2thejam** (11): Sorry gang, I missed the Emotion rerate and thus my chance to drop the basic but understandable Carly 11, so allow me this. Fantastic melody, the two sound awesome together, and the "to the moon" bit is just one great moment of many on this track

**xxipil0ts** (11): if you played this at my funeral and i dont sing along when "what happened was..." comes on, that means im truly gone.

**1998tweety** (10): camp and pop pefection, we love a viral smash

**\_alien-superstar\_** (10): Best music video of that year

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I truly wish this was a solo track but it’s still fun

**akanewasright** (10): This would’ve been a DANGEROUS song if I heard it at the wrong time… it makes hooking up with an ex sound like the climax of a character arc

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this song should've brought here back to Billboard Hot 100, why in the name of Jesus Christ did it not! Was the disco sound, great lyrics and a great duet not enough?????

**alexismateofan** (10): I only wish this was the first single of the album so it could get the attention it deserves. Then again it’s Carly so the general public would give it as much attention as they normally do.

**Ambrosia42** (10): perfection

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (10): period. PERIOD.

**Aoquesth378** (10): This song is EVERYTHING. It's beautifully written, produced, and performed by both artists and I live for the bridge. The choke hold it has on me is REAL.

**apatel27** (10): Weird that this became her second most known song but a win is a win

**babadork** (10): My dedication to retro things is strong enough that I’m really into this even though I don’t like a lot of the music this is referencing.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): sooo lush, Rufus repping the gays with mother and their voices work so well together. outro is gooorgeous cannot say it enough

**cocosairdep** (10): still not over the fact that this fell into the hands of the most demonic of straight people

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): rufus

**Frajer** (10): one of my favorite singers of all time a true Canadian legend, and also Carly Rae Jepsen is on this song with a killer bridge

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): tiktok rate 2 winner OMG…

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Glad Rufus Wainwright got a moment on here, he’s a great artist who doesn’t get mentioned enough.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): what happened was, we reached the moon! But lost in space I think we got there all too soon. And you know what IM COMING BACK FOR YOU BABY (IM COMING BACK FOR YOU)

**jman457** (10): Watch this match that viral tik tok sound and it go out next to Beg for You/cry for you

**kappyko** (10): Rufus Wainwright please beat me to death

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (10): this would be an easy 11 for me if only this rate didn't have so many great songs! It feels very theatrical and fun but also melancholic at the same time. Easily one of Carly's best songs

**phonethephoenix** (10): it's fun!!

**plastichaxan** (10): The way I didn’t like this at first because of Rufus but he’s just a silly gay guy having fun and sounds good here

**prettybirbkotori** (10): this album has so many 11 contenders. when this had minor tiktok success while made you look went top 20 i became the joker. deserved #1 worldwide

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): What a masterpiece. Blew me away on the first listen. This one deserves to be a timeless classic. The bridge is so iconic.

**queershoulder** (10): my first alternate for my eleven score

**ReallyCreative** (10): me in Congress using this song going viral as evidence TikTok should not be banned

**sarcasticsobs** (10): 10 bait for me but idc. Strings, baybee

**seanderlust** (10): if this doesn't make top ten i do not want to hear shit about camp from PH anymore because this is camp and it's GREAT. this is the sonic equivalent of trying wigs and costumes on with your best friend

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I just love how much personality she puts into her music

**shhhneak** (10): Deserves a ten simply for becoming a meme and alerting the locals that the Call Me Maybe girl is alive. This song also involves my favourite tweet of all time: https://twitter.com/emotion_deluxe/status/1595944565902610432?s=20

**Stryxen** (10): CARLY WHAT’S FOUR PLUS FOUR? Carly:

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Carly Rae Jesus will always come back for us

**throwaway-7650** (10): "is this nirvana?" - flava when this somehow loses:

**TiltControls** (10): such a wild pairing but it works perfectly

**UselessTacooo** (10): the first TikTok bag fumble

**wasian-invasion** (10): i will never forgive the straights after made you look became an actual hit off of tik tok instead of this

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i will have a twinge of annoyance when this wins because i prefer all three other albums but then i'll hear the start of the song, the euphoria will take over and i will be at peace with it

**camerinian** (9.5): I’m not actually so sure how well Carly and Rufus’ voices blend together but fuck this is just the most fun way the album could have ended. TikTok were correct in picking out the bridge as the highlight from this whole thing.

**imbaby122** (9.5): we were so SO close to world peace when this song trended on tiktok.

**impla77** (9.5): I don’t know if I’d be satisfied with this winning but I don’t have it in me to tank it. 0.5 points off for the Shakespeare line (I mentioned this in an Ariana song, but what is with weird Shakespeare lines in pop songs??)

**nick1372** (9.5): Queen of nicotine patches

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): my only gripe with it is that i don’t fully love the outro yet, but other than that it’s a very deserved winner

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (9): Truly incredible album closer.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): "im coming back for you babyyy" -me to my hobbies once the depression passes

**luckyphase** (9): it's so sweet 😊

**skeeturz** (9): it's a lot more fun than I thought it'd be and works so well as a closer, it takes you on a journey and never lets up in all the right ways

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): this is going to be such an underwhelming winner

**Leixander** (8.5): I'M COMING BACK FOR YOU BABY line deserved a better song but i'll take it

**Raindrac** (8.2): Ending an album on a high note is more important than many artists think; knowing that one of the best songs is still yet to come is just what a listener needs to encourage them to continue listening. The Loneliest Time does exactly that, saving one of the best songs for last. The melodies are great, and Rufus Wainwright's vocals have excellent synergy with Carly Ray Jepsen. I love how they sound together, especially in the outro! Oh, and that "I'm coming back for you, baby!" was perfectly delivered— bright and passionate.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): the closest she's gotten to a hit in years and the only thing we have to show for it is dozens of TikToks in which annoying teenagers complain that the bridge is the only good part... i'm gonna be sick

pig-serpent: ## At least they reached the moon

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): the bridge serves, but te rest of the song is just kind of regular.

**bogo** (7): sure it’s cute but against some of the other tracks in this rate it’s cute next to gorgeous

**memezaharamole** (7): would be higher if we were rating the music video, also check out her merch store to see her Loneliest Time pillowcases

**runaway3212** (7): im not coming back for her

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the tiktok kids who only payed attention to the chorus and said the rest of the song was bad…im not saying theyre right but im not exactly saying theyre wrong either

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Kinda sad how one small part of this song going semi-viral on tiktok is the closest thing she's found to mainstream success lately 😬

**uberpigeon** (6.5): okay its grown on me since jukebox..............

**DrumBeatGlass** (6): I don't really care for it. Could've been better without Rufus. The outro is a masterpiece tho

**Nagisoid** (6): I'm a TikTok anti (I think the bridge is the weakest part of the song and the strongest one is the outro, but either way it's just fine as a song)

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): when this inevitably wins i will be very disappointed

**static\_int\_husp** (5): Rufus sounds so bored and the spoken bridge is honestly so bad

**vayyiqra** (2): I do not get the hype over this one at all! I find it kind of a mess in fact! Sorry to this man 🍐

**flava** (0): ok I have been having issues with this since day 1. And quite frankly I just don’t get the hype at all. This isn’t magical, this is some weak soft-rocky disco that never reaches those magical heights that it aspires to be. It opens fine enough, that string could’ve used some more lsuness to it but whatever that’s a nitpick. The first big problem starts about 30 seconds into the song. It’s not that I’m relying on misandry, I’m sure Rufus Wainwright sounds good on his own music. But the synthetic effect they give that introduces him just sounds so inorganic. But maybe I could get around that if Carly and Rufus had chemistry, and that’s my second problem, they just don't. And that vocal effect Carly uses on the post-chorus is just flat out annoying. So I’ve already become really unsettled by some nitpicks and bigger issues, everything else just starts feeling underwhelming, the magic of disco has been broken. This song just kinda sucks. And quite frankly listening to That! Feels Good! and some older disco from EW&F and Donna, this just keeps on sucking the more i listen to it.

pig-serpent: # The Loneliest Time

---

**Overall Average**: 7.861 **// Average Controversy:** 1.791

---

hikk: This is definitely the album that grew the most for me over the course of hosting this rate. When it released I did enjoy some songs a lot but overall I found it to be a step down from Dedicated and Emotion. At this point though, after listening more and having some more experience with the subjects she's singing about, it's really resonating with me. "The Loneliest Time" is a great summation of the record, and has truly helped me out under some unfortunate circumstances. Even with my newfound appreciation, I don't know if I would award this album 5 out of the top 6 songs in the entire rate... but a podium sweep makes sense in my mind, those three songs are just fantastic. For the first time in years, the subreddit's true mother has won a rate (RAWM 2.0 doesn't count) and you love to see it! What a redemption this was from last time with Dedicated Side B!

pig-serpent: I have a confession to make.  Carly’s music has fallen off me hard over the last few years.  I never clicked with Emotion outside of a few songs, and while I liked Dedicated and Side B on release, the instrumentation always felt bland to me and eventually I stopped listening to the songs I liked from those albums because they started feeling bland and had lost all of their magic.  When TLT came out, none of the songs stood out to me, and while I thought going for a softer and more indie coded touch was a smart move for her, nothing was connecting with me and I was ready to call this the point where I officially denounced my status as a Carly fan. (n) But then I was assigned this rate, so obviously I started listening to this album to give myself thoughts on every track, and forcing myself to notice every track led to many of them starting to grow on me.  While I still think there are too many slower songs here, I’ve begun noticing what makes each one special individually, and I’m starting to think that this album is going to be the first Carly album that actually holds up for me years after its release.  Putting the “This isn’t actually disappointing, you’re just impatient” in  the Disappointing Sub Favorites Rate.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.625): Could easily be a musical

**just\_thonking** (9.438): YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**prettybirbkotori** (9.438): every carly album since emotion has been a 10/10 to me so this really isn’t fair but i’ve also listened to the album like 100 times so i feel uniquely qualified to say it’s amazing

**Frajer** (9.219): The reason we're all here, her music is so comforting and such a great serotonin boost

**Stryxen** (9.050): the kylie lawsuits were piling up, meghan was threatening to steal her #184 spot on billboard 200, on the verge of becoming a tiktok fad, dedicated side b... she had one chance...

**moonshxne** (8.969): genius songwriter

**alexismateofan** (8.875): So when I started this rate, I picked this one to rate last, thinking, with my clown nose, and my clown shoes, that I would fall less in love with it than I did when I first started listening to it, maybe find a different 11. That is not the case, apparently. I really love Loneliest Time, I think it’s such a well done album. The way it took over my life for a little bit, and then wormed it’s way back in after spending some time away. I really think it might be her best album to date.

**nick1372** (8.844): This could've been Carly's best album -- the theme of loneliness is perfect for her -- but it's brought down by a messy tracklist and some poor single choices. I have hide hopes for side B because the instrumentation and production on this album is absolutely stellar, and the sound fits Carly like a glove.

**imbaby122** (8.750): this album came at the right time for me. carly has a way of making seemingly generic music that is really genuine and charming. she makes things you would read on a pillow in homegoods feel heartfelt and quirky. and of course, the production! carly knows how to make a banger, but the more chill songs also feel natural for her. this album perfectly encapsulated all of the complicated feelings that i was feeling around that time, so i’ll always have a special connection with this album.

**phonethephoenix** (8.700): crj always makes solid pop tunes! this record is fun as always, and has a lot of nice chill moments too.

**kappyko** (8.688): This album is for people that love islands of adventure

**sarcasticsobs** (8.688): Honestly surprised at my average, didn't remember enjoying this THAT much ("Talking To Yourself an all-timer tho). Bonus tracks definitely helped I have to say

**jasannn** (8.688): I find this to be the perfect evolution of Carly’s sound. It sounds much more mature and grounded compared to Emotion and Dedicated but still undeniably her. I love the use of guitar throughout the album. This was my favorite album of 2022 and I still listen to it weekly. Also, if you listened to this album before Midnights, I love you.

**shipperondeck** (8.681): i forgot how good this is wtf

**akanewasright** (8.669): I don’t immediately love this as much as some of Carly’s other work, but like… there’s nothing bad here, really. I don’t think the highs are her highest, but there are no real lows to object to. I’ll always love Carly, and this shows a lot of why

**impla77** (8.581): Carly is just so good at writing bops, so all of the songs are excellent and untankable. QUEEN! Time for my concert bragging: I went with my sister who is annoying so we were not at doors opening and we had a bit of a shit position.. but it was still so good!

**DirtyRat583** (8.563): not been the biggest carly fan but this......... this is so good

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.500): i feel like people overrate how much of a critical darling carly is but she will always be mother to me

**TiltControls** (8.469): sure she's never going to match EMOTION but basically every album she's put out since has been a blast to listen to

**wasian-invasion** (8.450): 2nd favorite album of the year after Renaissance, it's just so incredibly consistent and warm. I've found myself going back to this album whenever I have a shitty day at work (which is getting more and more common) because I know it'll just make me smile involuntarily. I didn't really connect with Dedicated that much, so this is definitely a close second behind Emotion for now (let's see in a few years if it surpasses)

**apatel27** (8.406): Is it her best work? No but as is always the case her most mediocre washes most of the others artists best work

**RandomHypnotica** (8.381): it's kinda insane how all the singles sounded like entirely different projects, but when the album dropped it all suddenly became cohesive. Carly really does have a vision.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.375): my second favorite album in this rate is this, and I ain't lying when I say it's also one of the best, not only is it consistently great and catchy, but it also sounds great, especially with headphones on, and being a patient Raecist does pay off, and now I shall wait for TLTSB.

**throwaway-7650** (8.350): would be 9+ if not for the stinker near the end...

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.250): carly will always be someone i am deeply attached to and have high standards for, and this album lived up to the hype and then some. it may not be as packed with pure pop excellence as emotion, but it has a lot more nuance and veers into sonic experiments i would love to hear more of in her music. bends, western wind, go find yourself are all career highlights and they fit right in with the relentless pop magic of surrender my heart and bad thing twice. she just *gets* it and she shows it every. single. time.

**dreamingpastel** (8.181): Carly could release a metal album, and I'd still find at least one song to make my entire personality for a month

**JIRACHI** (8.031): the way this used to be my least fav of the four but it grew on me so much after rating this...

**xxipil0ts** (8.019): Best Pop Record in a while tbh.
[/r/popheads/comments/13o1r7t/2022_ultimate_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_3_are/jl2rw2n/]

=====

pig-serpent: **ImADudeDuh** (7.969): idgaf this is overall better than Emotion, even if Emotion has higher highs.

**shhhneak** (7.900): I’m kind of surprised at how little I have to say about this album? At this point Carly clocks in, delivers some chill bops among career defining music, and goes home to mind her business. It’s good but this record cause use an Emotion Side B moment.

**Aoquesth378** (7.844): 8.5 The album isn't Emotion but it's better than Dedicated. I think it's lyrically and sonically very strong, even if some tracks are boring.

**jman457** (7.737): I liked it more than Dedicated but less than Emotion, had some great tracks on here though

**luckyphase** (7.725): My thing with CRJ is that her vibe is my style, I adore some of her songs, and I love pop music but most of her music falls flat to me. I don't know music theory or music history so I don't know why, but the overlap between her influences and whatever music imprinted on me in my childhood is super small. Would love a music therapist to help me find out why, but meanwhile she has my attention!

**IIIHenryIII** (7.625): I love Carly and I consider her one of my favorite artists of all time, but this was a big disappointment. When Wester Wind came out, I was so excited to listen to the album in its entirety, and then it was finally released and I got to listen to all the songs I was so eager and thirsty for I felt nothing but dissatisfaction. They all sounded the same and lacked something. I think I'm just not a huge fan of the overall sound.

**vayyiqra** (7.500): Not the album we wanted from Carly perhaps but the one we deserved? However that meme goes. I liked this album enough to play it on the radio, listened to it a few times, not in love with it but it's pretty good! Also I saw her for the second time on the tour for this and it was SO COLD the coldest concert I've ever been to and it was only September, wtf. I sat huddled in my seat with my hands in my pockets feeling like that one meme of Bernie Sanders. Therefore I feel I've earned the right to any wack takes on this album (joke) but mostly I find this album "so nice!" 🍐

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.500): Carly really is skilled at synthpop. It's funny, as someone who loves concept albums, this album has 0 concept or shared ideas and yet I love it just the same. Sometimes you just need a bunch of good songs to make a good album!

**Nagisoid** (7.063): Yeah... This is probably my least favorite of all Carly projects I've heard. It just sounds very manufactured and synthetic, like her delivery is extremely uninterested in a lot of these tracks and that takes me out a bit. The more dancey/nu-disco tracks unironically I like less, not only because that type of music got really tired to me but because Carly does not seem comfortable in that genre and she's trying to imitate artists that have way more experience doing that genre. I wish she'd gone harder on the new wave revival of Talking to Yourself or the downtempo feel of Bends, I think she really nailed the vibe on these songs. Another major pet peeve I have with this record is that the lyrics give that energy of being speedwritten, especially because Carly just gives up at times and says vocalizations like "la la la" way too often. It's a fine album but I expected more and pretty much everything else she has released is better.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.000): This really grew on me after coming out. It only has one bad moment, but it is a bit boring in places.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.875): some fun cuts that are either signature Carly sweetness or have a dreamy vulnerability to them. but also some cuts that feel very uninspired to me, like Carly on autopilot. Maybe the album could have afforded to be shorter

**ktajlili** (6.750): this is a grower album. It doesn't stand out, but it's nice and I think deserves a lot more credit that it initially got. It's no Emotion, but it still sticks to its theme pretty well and has solid songwriting. Songs like "Talking to Yourself" and "The Loneliest Time" are outright classics and should be considered essentials in Carly's discography

**camerinian** (6.688): i literally don’t understand how the sub gets behind this album and yet Solar Power gets repeatedly slagged off. I feel like I’m in the “corporate wants you to find the difference” meme

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.000): The Loneliest Time dares to ask the question: “what if we had filler AND put that filler all at the front of the album?” If you get past the first few forgettable songs and find yourself listening to the second half, it becomes a solid album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.000): one of the most disappointingly generic and forgettable albums i’ve listened to in a long time

**thedoctordances1940** (5.638): When I first listened to this album I quite liked it but then I revisited it and didn't really enjoy it and never revisited it again until now and it seems that second listen was how I actually do feel about the album. Beyond Surrender My Heart and Talking To Myself there just isn't really anything that excites me here. Tbh I've come to realise that as a whole I really don't like Carly as much as I thought I did, Emotion and Emotion Side B are still great but whenever I think back at Dedicated I also realise there was very little I cared for there either. She'll still release the occasional really good track but I think at this point Emotion is the only album of hers I really enjoy in full and even that has grown off me a bit, it just had a much higher starting position.

**flava** (5.625): ooh rating this while having been jamming to That! Feels Good! makes this come across as a lot worse than it probably is

**Lilacly\_Adily** (5.281): I listened to this album twice and felt it was unmemorable but the third time was the charm. I still think the back half really drags the album down.

pig-serpent: This was a so much fun, and getting to host this rate was both a dream come true and a major boost in my life as everything else this weekend has been a bit rough for me.  I hope you has as much fun watching the reveals as we did making it!  Hikk was an amazing cohost and he taught me so much about hosting and he balanced out all the newbie mistakes I made while hosting.  I couldn't have asked for a better rate mentor!  I'm excited to do it again someday, but in the meantime remember to do the Anime Rate and Anthemic Indie Pop, and tune in next week for the Eclectic Art Pop reveal!

TiltControls: Sorry for the delay today with the stats! Had to run pretty much right after the reveal ended.

Anyways fantastic job hikk and pig for the rate! The day 2 bloodbath still pains me, but with such great songs it was always bound to end that way for someone.

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Congrats to **The Loneliest Time** for the win! Across all songs rated by the sub it places 241st. It ties with A-Ha's Take On Me in score. It places just below Kylie Minogue's All The Lovers and Loreen's Euphoria and places just above Queen's Somebody to Love

And the rate's only other 9+ song isn't that far behind. **Talking To Yourself** is only separated from being next to The Loneliest Time by Queen sitting right between them. It places slightly higher than a 3 way tie of Róisín Murphy's Jealousy, Marvin Gaye's Inner City Blues, and One Direction's Night Changes.

**Song Stats**

* Not only did it (barely) get the win, The Loneliest Time also earns a spot on the leaderboard for most 11s! With 23, it places 21st overall (tied with Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill from Winners II and Taylor Swift - August from 2020 Ultimate Rate)


## Artists

As the title indicates, these 4 artists have been rated plenty of times already. All that appears might just be slight position changes. Though two of the artists did manage a bit of a swap in ordering


* 48th: Lorde / Girls Aloud (8.009)
* **50th: Rina Sawayama (8.004) [PREV 26th]**
* 51st: Mis-Teeq (7.995)

-

* 114th: Vince Staples (7.734)
* **115th: Carly Rae Jepsen (7.732) [PREV 123rd]**
* 116th: Lily Allen (7.730)

-

* 165th: Kelis (7.572)
* **166th: Charli XCX (7.564) [PREV 165th]**
* **167th: Tove Lo (7.563) [PREV 157th]** / Kero Kero Bonito (7.563)
* 169th: Bridgit Mendler (7.559)

-

Feature changes:

* Caroline Polachek: 50th -> 57th
* Christine and the Queens: 79th -> 82nd


**Artist Stats**

* With a win today, Carly moves up on the **most wins** leaderboard! She now has her 4th following two wins for Run Away With Me and one for Higher. She ties Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, and Kanye West for 3rd. Only the Weeknd (5) and Beyonce (6) have more wins.
* On the flipside, Charli extends her record for most rates without a win with her 22nd now. Sooner or later it's bound to happen right?
* I suppose they're sub faves for a reason. We've got quite a bit of movement on the 'most songs rated' leaderboard today
 * Carly overtakes Beyonce for 2nd (which Beyonce only took after 2022 Ult) with 122 songs to 109. Taylor still has quite the lead over either of them though with 166 total.
 * Charli manages to rise from just outside the top 10 all the way into 5th place! She actually only sits one song behind Ariana, who is in 4th (102 vs 101)
 * Tove Lo manages to just barely sneak into the top 25 with 55 songs now. She ranks 24th overall and knocks Fall Out Boy off the list (who had 52)
* Charli rejoins the tie for first for 'most rates appeared in' with 22. The other artists with the same number of appearances are Ariana Grande, Beyonce, and The Weeknd. Carly is also on this list, but going from 18 appearances to 19 doesn't get her any closer to the artists right above her (Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, and Taylor Swift at 21 each)
* With 61 11's picked up in this rate Carly begins her journey to catch up to Taylor Swift in 1st! Right now there's only a small gap of 443 for Taylor to 362 for Carly. Considering this stat had a 100 11 gap for the longest time this is actually quite the improvement!
 * Charli XCX also picks up enough to jump over Lady Gaga and goes from 6th to 5th overall
 * And despite not showing up on the most songs rated list, we have a surprise appearance from Rina too! She manages to just edge onto the chart with 166 11s across her 41 songs and knocks Kesha out of the top 10. Despite the numerous songs and rate appearances Rina is only 2 11's off of Rihanna above her.\* (As always the bottom of this leaderboard is a partially unknown spot as we still don't know how many 11's Britney got for Toxic from her first rate and she is only 11 11's off from the top 10)
* Charli keeps jumping up the charts today. Though maybe she would've preferred not to be on this one. On the 'most 0's' leaderboard she jumps from 5th all the way to 2nd with 153 total 0's, passing Halsey, Ariana, and Katy. Only a matter of time before she catches up with Taylor who has a slight lead with 416 total.

## Albums
 
Despite all the painful cuts, it does seem like all 4 albums were at least well liked. The overall song average is around 7.40 so they all are technically above average in that regard!

(Rankings are out of 389)

* 108th: Miguel - Kaleidoscope Dream (7.862)
* **109th: Carly Rae Jepsen - The Loneliest Time (7.861)**
* 110th: [MUNA](https://redd.it/135wyy9) - About U (7.856)

* 177th: Robyn - Body Talk (7.629)
* **178th: Rina Sawayama - Hold The Girl (7.627)** / Kesha - Rainbow (7.627)
* 180th: Fall Out Boy - Folie à Deux (7.624)

-


* 214th: Slayyyter - Slayyyter (7.502)
* **215th: Charli XCX - Crash (7.497)**
* 216th: Eve - Scorpion (7.494)

**Album Stats**

* Carly manages the rare accolade of sweeping the top 3 of a rate! With the trio of The Loneliest Time, Talking To Yourself, and Surrender My Heart she joins fellow sweepers Lady Gaga (Fame Monster), Ariana Grande (My Everything and Sweetener), Arctic Monkeys (AM), Tyler the Creator (IGOR), and Red Velvet (K-Pop GG Singles). The only two artists to manage a top 4 sweep are Paramore (Brand New Eyes) and Beyonce (Renaissance)
* And you thought Charli might be out of the clear by now. Though all 4 albums ended up with solid averages, Crash does get the fun distinction of landing on the 'Highest 0 Album Spread' leaderboard in 3rd place with three quarters of the album picking up at least one 0. The only songs to escape this wrath were Crash, Constant Repeat, Twice, and Sorry If I Hurt You. The only two albums to end up with a higher 0 spread were Olivia Rodrigo's Sour (90.9% of the album with a 0) and Lorde's Melodrama (81.8%)


## Rates

* No leaderboard spots, but it was a single participant off ending up on the 'Most Participants' list (had 159, needed 160)
