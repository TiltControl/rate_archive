[Hello popheads!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIGgoYgEg9E)

If there's one thing about our beloved subreddit that has stayed consistent over the years, it is our devotion to the girls that deserve better. After all, we were quite literally built upon discussion of  *E•MO•TION*, the absolute poster girl for immensely high quality pop music that just wasn't getting the recognition it deserved. Seven years later, we're still at it - and we still haven't shut up about Carly's music, either! This rate will cover four of the most-discussed and well-beloved flops across this subreddit, all of which released new albums in 2022, and none of which went without the spewing of hot takes and controversy that will inevitably lead to an exciting time! We're your hosts for this month u/hikkaru and u/pig-serpent, now let's get to meeting our contestants!

# Carly Rae Jepsen - The Loneliest Time

By this point we all know the story of Carly Rae Jepsen - an artist that easily could have been swept away into the depths of irrelevancy should she have been stuck being pigeonholed into the Call Me Maybe shaped hole, she instead reinvented herself and her brand by becoming a face of modern poptimism, and of course the mother of r/popheads. 2019's Dedicated was immensely anticipated due to the massive shoes it had to fill coming off the heels of *E•MO•TION* and its follow-up b-side EP, and although the acclaim did not end up being quite as ubiquitous as its predecessor, her reputation remained intact. The album saw her exploring similar styles of pop, synthy and dancey all the way through. It's what a lot of people have come to love her for - the wheel isn't being reinvented, but she's still putting out spectacular sugary pop that hits every time. If it ain't broke, why fix it?

2022 brought forth a new Carly era, and as always, any good pophead was waiting with bated breath. In May of last year, we got our first taste of her upcoming album - her feet were bare, she was being sexy, playful, feral, and free... "Western Wind" showed a side of Carly that hadn't really been put on display too much prior. The breezy indie-pop tinged track was more lowkey than previous lead singles that leaned on bombast and saccharinity, but of course with a switch-up in sound came more controversy. Follow-up single "Beach House" didn't fare all that much better, because while it did provide a more upbeat soundscape, it also leaned into Carly's penchant for campiness more than really any track of hers had before. However, these two singles proved to be the album's extremes, with the rest of it falling somewhere in the middle. She even had a brief moment of virality with the album's fan favourite disco-inspired title track, and while it didn't amount to another smash hit, it was cute to hear such a stellar bridge across the internet for a while.

One of the old guards of rates and the subreddit as a whole, Carly has only ever won rates with songs related to *E•MO•TION* and has floundered a bit since. Lest we forget what happened in the 2020 Sub Faves rate! She's reached the moon before, but will she be able to come back for it again? - u/hikkaru

1. Surrender My Heart
2. Joshua Tree
3. Talking to Yourself
4. Far Away
5. Sideways
6. Beach House
7. Bends
8. Western Wind
9. So Nice
10. Bad Thing Twice
11. Shooting Star
12. Go Find Yourself or Whatever
13. The Loneliest Time (feat. Rufus Wainright)
14. Anxious
15. No Thinking Over the Weekend
16. Keep Away

# Charli XCX - CRASH

By the time *How I'm Feeling Now* released in 2020, Charli had already spent almost half her career time wise and most of it release wise being the Dippin Dots of pop music.  Every release pulled her forward thinking, "pop music of the future" into a new direction, and when Charli announced that she was changing styles for her last album on her Atlantic contract, the shock to her fandom wasn't that she was leaving hyperpop--rather, what was more surprising was Charli's new inclination to look towards the past, calling this album her "Janet Era" and her "Sellout Era," and her hope to make a smashing entrance into the nostalgia based music scene.

Naturally, any change in sound is going to cause a ripple through an artist's fan base, but Charli was accutely aware of this fact and did the best she could to mitigate it.  Crash is littered with producers from all of her eras, from her pre-hyperpop producers like sadpony or Justin Raisen, to hyperpop giants 50 gecs and Mr. PC Music himself, A. G. Cook.  But underneath the album's many producers and aestheic trip through time--the promised nu jack swing, samples of songs from 1992, 2000, and 2006, a song that apes a 1983 classic, and contemporary sounding nu disco--one thing remains apparent.  Charli is still Charli.  Even with the many changes of styles, her voice, both literally and artistically, shines though on every song she made.

Popheads, you need no introduction to our rate scene's biggest loser.  Having never won a rate in 21 attempts, and having previously lost a rate to all three of her current competitors, there is only one question left to ask.  Will Charli playing dirty in her "Evil Era" be enough for her to finally take the crown?  Or will this Crash prove to be fatal? - u/pig-serpent

1. Crash
2. New Shapes (feat. Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek)
3. Good Ones
4. Constant Repeat
5. Beg For You (feat. Rina Sawayama)
6. Move Me
7. Baby
8. Lightning
9. Every Rule
10. Yuck
11. Used To Know Me
12. Twice
13. Selfish Girl
14. How Can I Not Know What I Need Right Now
15. Sorry if I Hurt You
16. What You Think About Me

# Rina Sawayama - Hold The Girl

Rina Sawayama has spent the last few years setting herself up as the next big thing in the pop music world.  At the very start of her career she was already dropping all time classics like "Cyber Stockholm Syndrome" and "Cherry," and her debut album felt like a bomb going off to everyone who was paying attention.  *SAWAYAMA* was an all-encompassing vision that laid out the many fascets of Rina Sawayama; One moment she was living a mirage of glamor more appealing than actual depictions of xs wealth, the next moment she was singing a ballad about making your own family, and the next she was fronting a nu-metal band, screaming about her parents' failures. *SAWAYAMA* was such an impactful work of art to many that Rina was going to have to dig deeper than she ever had before for the follow up to even attempt to live up to the impossible expectations set out for it.

What Rina came up with is *Hold The Girl*, an album meant to live up to ever facet of *SAWAYAMA* while occasionally even surpassing it.  To continue her quest to transform from internet sensation to proper pop superpower, Rina refined her melodic sensibilities and scrubbed a few of the pointer edges from her previous album, all while striving to be more eclectic, exploring tons of new sounds and mashing up genres in ways most pop princesses wouldn't ever dare.  It makes a more flamboyant entrance, with almost every song striving to match the dramatic flare and presence of "XS", and above all else, it strives to be more earnest and heartfelt, speaking to everyone who's queer, an immigrant, or has had issues with their upbringing and found the need to re-parent themselves in adulthood.  On paper, *Hold the Girl* dumps style, substance, accessibility, and variety into a blender indiscriminately, and pours out a glass of everything you could ever want in a pop album.

According to our rate history, *SAWAYAMA* was as close to a perfect album as one could reasonably expect, taking home both her second rate win and sneaking 7 songs into the top ten of our stacked, previous Ultimate Subreddit Favorites Rate.  Will we hold the seemingly perfect follow-up to the same high regards as its predecessors, or is this an album that's too good to be true. - u/pig-serpent

1. Minor Feelings
2. Hold The Girl
3. This Hell
4. Catch Me In The Air
5. Forgiveness
6. Holy (Til You Let Me Go)
7. Your Age
8. Imagining
9. Frankenstein
10. Hurricanes
11. Send My Love To John
12. Phantom
13. To Be Alive

# Tove Lo - Dirt Femme

The above three artists have quite a storied history - from Carly and Charli's joint loss in the 2019 Sub Faves rate, to Rina's absolute sweep against those two in the 2020 Sub Faves Rate, the three of them all have story arcs to further in the context of this type of rate. For Tove Lo though, she's always been just a little shafted here compared to her contemporaries. The Swedish pop star gained immense notoriety with smash hit and rate winner "Habits (Stay High)" back in 2014, but like Carly and Charli, the mainstream relevance was not there to stay. Follow-up albums did not provide any hits to that degree and went far more under the radar, but even on our humble subreddit she was not met with such acclaim that other flop girls received. But thankfully, after the release of *Dirt Femme*, she's made her way to the highest echelon and was overwhelmingly voted in to this rate via poll.

Dirt Femme finds Tove Lo embracing pop music to its most gay-appealing degree, somewhat of a shift from her previous effort in 2019's *Sunshine Kitty*. Synthy dance-pop is what this album is all about, with elements of nudisco and synthwave making up the influences. Proven by multiple collaborations with producer SG Lewis and even a sample and interpolation of 1960s classic "Popcorn", much of this album's bright production moments reflect Tove's recent marriage. Jubilance aside, however, it wouldn't be a Tove Lo album without melancholia shining through on multiple tracks, and we see her sing of various song topics such as her experience with an eating disorder (on "Grapefruit") and the rejection of what a traditional marriage looks like, among others.

Despite this being her first appearance in a true subreddit faves rate, Tove already has two rate wins under her belt. Will being the initial obvious underdog work out in her favour and get her a third win? Or will being the odd woman out have the tides turned against her?

(Please note that we have included Borderline in the rate tracklist as it appears to be a part of an eventual deluxe release.) - u/hikkaru

1. No One Dies From Love
2. Suburbia
3. 2 Die 4
4. True Romance
5. Grapefruit
6. Cute & Cruel (feat. First Aid Kit)
7. Call on Me (with SG Lewis)
8. Attention Whore (feat. Channel Tres)
9. Pineapple Slice (with SG Lewis)
10. I'm to Blame
11. Kick In The Head
12. How Long
13. Borderline

# BONUS RATE

Despite what some people would have you believe, the album is not the end all be all of music releases, and all four of these artists (some more than others) released collabs and loosies over the last few years that we couldn’t work into the main rate, but many have been clamoring to rate regardless.  These songs are:

1. Charli XCX - Hot Girl (Bodies Bodies Bodies)
2. Tiesto & Charli XCX - Hot in It
3. No Rome - Spinning (feat. Charli XCX & The 1975)
4. Lewis OfMan & Carly Rae Jepsen - Move Me
5. Rina Sawayama - Eye For An Eye
6. Martin Garrix - Pressure (feat. Tove Lo)

You may notice that one artist has half the bonus rate representation.  This is partially because of a lack of bonus song options from two of these artists, but mostly because we need to appease Charli fans so they won’t smash reddit’s servers with baseball bats when she loses another rate.  We figured that stacking the bonus rate in her favor would be the easiest way to do so.

**REMINDER: The Bonus Rate is optional** and **you do not** ***have*** **to submit a score for every song in it if you do do it**. You **cannot** give your 0 or 11 to any song in the bonus, as they are not part of the main rate, but that doesn’t mean you should shy away from 10’s or 1’s ;). While it is optional, there are very good reasons people want these songs to be rated.

---

# RULES

* **You must listen to and score every song in the main rate.** Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.
* **Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10 and can include one decimal place** but no more. So 8.2 is fine but 8.25 is not.
* **You may give one song in the whole main rate a score of 11 and one other a score of 0.** If you want to award these scores, save them for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate, respectively.
* We encourage you to leave comments of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, **they must be in this format,** simply leaving one space after your score:

>Yuck: 10 The only thing yucky about this song is how high it’s making my Charli average!

Any other format such as:

>2 Die 4: hahaha more like 2 die (4)

>Joshua Tree: 6: I want to like this but I still haven’t found what I’m looking for in Carly’s music :/

will cause the rate machine to **break!** Oh no!

* If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole **they must be formatted like this, leaving a colon then a space after the album title,** as so:

> Hold the Girl: Holding on to the good girl (and she knows it!)  We’re going home.

* Your **scores** **will not be confidential** and will be revealed, along with any comments, with your username attached.
* We reserve the right to reject ballots with ludicrously lopsided and/or lazy scores that may indicate sabotage against one artist or another. If you are worried of your harshness being perceived as sabotage, leave comments to explain yourself!
* You may change your scores up until the deadline by messaging this account or either host (u/hikkaru & u/pig-serpent) on reddit or discord.

**The due date for this rate will be Friday, May 12th.** The reveal will then occur a week later from May 19th-21st!
