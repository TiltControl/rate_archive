**pig-serpent** (4): This song should be much better but it's just hitting me as a grand sweeping statement that doesn't feel earned in the instrumentation or the production.  At one point in time, this was a day 1 elimination despite having the most 11s, which checks out I think.

**hikk** (2): Ahh I’m sorry… I know there’s some shooters for this track but I was so bored, and every revisit has just been the same. The guitar solo is nice but as a whole this is just too plodding and uninteresting for me to appreciate, truly the antithesis of what songs I do like on this album.

---

#if you are BRAVE it's because you can SLAY

**apatel27** (11): Big Mood in Self Acceptance

**bogo** (11): something just… hit. like when i listened to this song it just all made sense

**indie\_fan\_** (11): this feels like a day 2 cut but idc i love it

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I feel like that picture of Emma Roberts covered in blood while smiling, cause I’m so impressed by the lyrics, vocals, beat, and production but at the same time I feel like dying

**akanewasright** (10): this is my runner up 11. Idk the trauma and the vocals just hit

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): omg, this song made me tear up in first listen.

**bloodjet** (10): damn this hits hard like bricks

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Kinda my favorite from the album actually? I really relate to the theme of trying to reconcile with your inner child and she sounds fantastic.

**JIRACHI** (10): people really hate this?

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): this was in my 11 shortlist. I was very surprised people aren’t raving about this song.

**musical\_pyn** (10): Rina Sawayama makes disney channel music (complimentary)

**runaway3212** (10): this being the first hit that made me believe in this album

**throwaway-7650** (10): danny phantom has ruined an entire generation of teenage boys

**UselessTacooo** (10): this song is so overblown but in a good way

**MasterWizardRyan** (9.6): this song is the grower on the album for sure

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I’m a slut for waltz time

**Ambrosia42** (9.4): I DON’T WANNA DO THIS WITHOUT YOU!!!!

**1998tweety** (9): she ate this

**alexismateofan** (9): an absolutely haunting piece that really sticks with you, what a beautiful piece of work

**CrimsonROSET** (9): now why am I crying

**dreamingpastel** (9): Playing this live in an arena/stadium would absolutely kill

**DrumBeatGlass** (9): Calmness in this song, it's a safe space. Power ballad, that's what I was looking for!

**queershoulder** (9): good good good

**RandomHypnotica** (9): lowkey this has Passion Pit energy

**shhhneak** (9): "once upon a time, there was a girl pleasing the world" me advocating for this to win songeniality.

**TiltControls** (9): sorry i can't hear you over the EXTREME GUITARS

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): a bad choice for a single but a great song. in ten years i hope rina is playing this song to sold out stadiums with everyone singing along bc that's what it was made for

**wasian-invasion** (9): please save this from chosen family's fate

**impla77** (8.7): bribery can only get you so far i guess

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): this is so unapologetically cheesy I can’t help but adore it

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): I think I kinda erased this single's existence from my mind but I do really like it

**imbaby122** (8): i still am my inner child. when do i stop dying to be liked and looking for love?

**reput4tionera** (8): why do half of the songs sound the same like they’re good but they’re the same song

**ricki** (8): if you are BRAVE!!...

**shckskndv** (8): the power ballad is power ballading!

**xxipil0ts** (8): this sounds like the ending of those indie films where the main character actually does get what they needed in the first act of the film and then the credit fades and your eyes are just sobbing bc you realize you'll never live to see yourself be this happy.

**luckyphase** (7.8): there are parts I like and parts that make me want to skip the whole song

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): at this point in the tracklist I believe she made a Halloween album and did not even realize

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): so gorgeous i think if the rest of the album sounded like this and SMLTJ it would be really great

**phonethephoenix** (7): her voice really is great!! similar thematically and musically to other songs on the album

**sarcasticsobs** (7): : (

**shipperondeck** (7): better than i remember

**skeeturz** (7): another enjoyable song that i largely appreciate in the whole context of the album

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Aww cute Rina

# Not Brave, Can't Slay

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Disney Channel Original Movie Ass Song

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (6): I always confuse this with Hurricanes in my memory, but I don't think this is the better track.

**Aoquesth378** (6): One of my least favorite songs from the album. I just think it doesn't flow well and had nothing memorable about it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the guitar solo at the end SLAYS but unfortunately the rest of the song is just too mid of a ballad for me to really connect to

**welcome2thejam** (6): Her voice and the guitar doing two separate carry jobs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): I’m sorry to all the 11’s…I dunno I guess my inner child is kinda boring me rn.

**ReallyCreative** (5): I love the message of this song but it just doesn't hit the way I wish it did

**Stryxen** (4.5): i like the idea of this one and i wanna like it but it just doesn’t do anything for me - her vocals are great as always and the guitar sounds nice i think they don’t fully reach the emotional mark it should to make these lyrics work and it falls flat (for me anyway, but i see why people love this)

**Nagisoid** (4): The vocalizations in the Chorus are giving AOR CupcakKe remix (derogatory)

**Raindrac** (4): These lyrics are a pretty good tale about finding yourself, but musically, Phantom is a bummer. There are some good melodies and ideas buried in this song, but this is one of the songs that Hold The Girl's poor mixing was most detrimental to, and I just don't feel captivated enough by Phantom to look past it.

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i love the verses but the chorus is so anticlimactic

**ktajlili** (3): ugh

**Leixander** (3): danny phantom i'm so sorry

**uberpigeon** (3): https://twitter.com/findurtiktok/status/1603575488278044673

**vayyiqra** (3): I get what she is trying to say here but musically don't like this at all 🫂

**just\_thonking** (2.5): I don't like it but I don't have it in me to give a zero

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (2): can she stop with the electric guitars omfg.

**pig-serpent** (10): The problem with ballads isn't that they're slow, but because artists think they can take shortcuts on slower songs because they're more emotional (a 10!) or whatever.  New Shapes does everything a ballad should, featuring a stunning synth pallet, and having strong melodies to back up every artist's performance.  Charli is great at sequencing her guests so that she starts a song strong, and the guests only get better as the song goes along, and this is no exception.  Caroline Polachek is basically a goddess on this song. 

 However, a lot of people do not see this song the same way I do, and it was hovering around the day 1-2 border for the whole rate.  I’m at least glad it was able to pull itself up a bit towards the end.

**hikk** (7): This was really disappointing to me when it released, but it’s grown a little since then. I still feel like it’s the worst single from Crash though, and I definitely would not have this big of a gap between it and Beg For You. The chorus simultaneously feels extremely lazy but also catchy as hell, but my biggest problem is with Caroline’s bridge that feels so out of place, like… Don’t Call Me Angel-esque… I think this is a fine place for this song honestly.

---

# i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I never noticed how all their names start with the letter “C”, I wonder if that’s why Charli called them up

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is easily my favorite single off the album and it really combined the three of them into a heartbreaking song that I'll always play on repeat.

**Aoquesth378** (10): A perfect song, idek what else to say. Can't go wrong with Charli, Christine, and Caroline.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The way I’ve seen so many people act like that is bad…what reality do you all live in???

**bogo** (10): no i think you do have what i want it’s right here

**flava** (10): ended society with this one

**jman457** (10): my fav crash single, yall should be scared of my Caroline average in the 2023 rate.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (10): they clearly DO have what I want! This is a banger

**Nagisoid** (10): https://files.catbox.moe/x5wi7a.mp4

**notarobot3675** (10): POP GOLD

**queershoulder** (10): first of many hits on this great album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this one took a while to grow on me but now I *get* it

**reput4tionera** (10): geometry in the future

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): If someone ever asks for the definition of "maximizing joint slay" just show them this song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.8): me in elementary school when my teacher showed me what a trapezoid and a rhombus were

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (9.5): I’m a new shapes truther y’all are just nervous

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): i like it it’s fun

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): boygenius for gays who do poppers

**Frajer** (9): Bang Bang for people on SSRIs 

the SNL performance of this being canceled because of Covid so we never got it live with Chris and Caroline, although we did get it with Caroline, is proof the universe hates me sometimes

**imbaby122** (9): we need a caroline polachek dictionary at this point. dive baring, wikipediated, etc. she speaks her own language.

**memezaharamole** (9): holy trinity of 'C' artists

**nick1372** (9): "What you want? I ain't got it." - me to my cat when he begs for food in front of the automatic feeder

**prettybirbkotori** (9): that moment when you, a queen, come across another queen and another and the queens and discuss how to best maximize your joint slay

**ricki** (9): the best single of the era oop

**shhhneak** (9): One thing Caroline is gonna do is deliver a Shakespearean late song monologue.

**skeeturz** (9): absolutely love this one, all three of their voices mesh so well together and the throwback sound is killer

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): they have formed a Haim

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): they were so right... charli caroline chris was what i want what i want

**UselessTacooo** (9): Whachu hwhant? Eye aighnt gawt iught!

**wasian-invasion** (9): whoever pointed out that these are the same synths from dj got us fallin in love again i will twist you into a new shape

**welcome2thejam** (9): Those two notes after the "what you want" are so magical

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes alright

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.5): the chemistry between those queens. Give me some of the confidence, I need it in my life

**jasannn** (8.5): they put the C's in Collab

**Leixander** (8.5): christine kinda carries

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): i literally can't stop thinking about the person who called this a posse cut

**impla77** (8.3): Did anyone else try to make a 3 sided shape that wasn’t a triangle in their youth??

**alexismateofan** (8): currently my new favorite song about shapes with 3 singers on it.

**ktajlili** (8): I go back and forth on this. I much care for the chorus, but I love the spacy production, especially in the Caroline verse. Honestly, I think the Caroline verse saves this.

**musical\_pyn** (8): I wish the verses flowed better together because that chorus is addiccccctive

**oscarbrierley1** (8): really didnt like it when it first came out, but it really grew on me in the context of the album

**phonethephoenix** (8): like yes I thought this song was disappointing but it really did grow on me. there's something satisfying about it

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Yeah, it's not "Gone" (her best song, DNI) nor "Tears" (Caroline Polachek screeching is something that can be so personal), but I like it

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): I love Caroline's bridge!

**akanewasright** (7): This hook is objectively the laziest thing ever but I can’t lie I kinda live for the verses

**bigbigbee** (7): Chris really ate this one up, especially the MV…he’s such a PERFORMER and a dancer. Absolutely magnetic

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it works because this makes her look like a massive square

**plastichaxan** (7): I was just being a hater cause how is the collaboration with the 3 of them like this but it’s good

**Stryxen** (7): overhated but also not amazing

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): it’s just so weirdly paced it feels like I’m a horse plodding on a muddy track. And Caroline is the giant puddle the horse travels over and gets splashed by to get coated in mud

**seanderlust** (6.5): "what you want? i ain't got it." - mcdonalds drive-through employees after midnight

**DaHumanTorch** (6): don't call me angel but christine is miley (useless) and caroline is lana (best part but also doesn't fit at all)

**shckskndv** (6): it’s weird that this is second in the track list, right? Second half of album energy

**shipperondeck** (6): im kind of tired of this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this is one of the laziest chorus ive heard in a long long time, like charli is supposed to be the queen of making supreme choruses how did she embarrass herself this badly

**camerinian** (5.5): shockingly mid track for what should have been a slam dunk collab. The hook is underwritten and does not have Charli’s normal high-level stick factor, and the lyrical matter feels like it’s treading old ground by Charli standards. The guest gals do kill their parts and the harmonies they deliver are brilliant in developing the track but ultimately they’re in service of a whole that doesn’t have the bones to really make them shine. No idea what people see in this one.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): During the album rollout this was my favourite single but that was always saying very little and even at the time I would've said it would be the weakest single from most of her other albums and coming back to it now, I do see why I did at least somewhat like it, there are some good parts to it, especially the verses, but the chorus sounds so stale and I think if I listened to it even more I would very quickly get very fed up of it. Also Caroline adds nothing.

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (5): I felt like it needed a punchy moment somewhere and it never hits.

**JIRACHI** (5): gone and tears were so much better what was this snoozefest omg

**ReallyCreative** (5): they did spill a little here, Tetris has been getting stale lately

**throwaway-7650** (5): ...meh

**MasterWizardRyan** (4.5): i don't see the appeal, it's incredibly basic and boring

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): me: i want a good chorus 

 charli: what you want, i ain't got it :(

**Raindrac** (4): Wow, that "What you want, I ain't got it" hook is... atrocious. And that's supposed to be a chorus? I can hardly recognize any melody and the pause ruins any sense of rhythm. The drumbeat and features are good, but they can only go so far. A good pop song needs a good hook and this song lacks one. Possibly her worst single.

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): bang bang for people who have a rym account

**ImADudeDuh** (3.5): what you want (a good score) I ain’t got it

**AmandaYoung2083** (3): I think this is harsh but I just really dislike this song... skip every time.

**runaway3212** (3): I literally cannot wait to rate Desire, I Want To Turn Into You

**frogaranaman** (2): none of them got the same brief on this song

**moonshxne** (2): something about the entire affair just sounds so *cheap*.

**uberpigeon** (2): there's three of them and they still couldn't get a chorus. what were they doing in the studio

**vayyiqra** (2): A mess of a song! A waste of features by two artists that are otherwise "good at times' for me. 🚘

**kappyko** (1): Up next Old Forms by Charlie Puth featuring Camila Cabello and Creed

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): stop putting Christine and the Queens on things

**IIIHenryIII** (0): this is honestly a mess, and those ooohs in the background are annoying as fuck

**hikk** (8.5): This gets the achievement of highest Crash deluxe track and I think I agree, the production is really great and punchy and is just another example of Charli executing a fairly standard synthpop song very well. I do think there’s better tracks on the standard edition but as a whole I think I would have placed all of these deluxe tracks a little higher, they’re good!

**pig-serpent** (8): One of the best instrumentals on crash being relegated to a bonus track?  The Charli slaughter continuing into day 2?  Which of these is less fortunate?  You Decide!

---

#Deluxe track fanatics

**AHSWeeknd** (10): about as loud as a DJ White Shadow track

**bloodjet** (10): this is def title track material

**musical\_pyn** (10): I think I read an interview where she said this was going to be the original title of the album? I may have also dreamed it but either way that makes perfect sense

**queershoulder** (10): wanted this one on the main album

**reput4tionera** (10): i absolutely love this song but why does the mixing make it sound like a demo

**runaway3212** (10): apologising queen, influencers should take notes

**shckskndv** (10): shrinkwrapped Lightning but like in a really good way

**skeeturz** (10): it's very repetitive but it works

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): tumblr user morgrana's legacy will outlive us all

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): she needs to be studied because why are the bonus tracks better than a good chunk of the standard

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): me giving songs I know my friends love a 0

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): not her fake-apologizing apologizing to this poor boy

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): What the hell, I did NOT remember enjoying the production on these bonus songs as much I am right now

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): it would've been an interesting title track, but CRASH is better otherwise.

**Ambrosia42** (9): Hurt being kind of a double meaning since it can be past or future tense

**Aoquesth378** (9): Originally supposed to be the album title… and I think it should have been because this track is amazing.

**imbaby122** (9): the title track that never was </3 deserved better.

**Nagisoid** (9): Looks up on Google "Sorry If I Hurt You Higurashi AMV"

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i get such a nostalgic feeling from this song, like it would play in the credits of a video game i played as a kid

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): this would've slayed as an album title tbh

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): https://i.imgur.com/7LNr0Dv.jpg

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**DrumBeatGlass** (8): I love when Charli lets herself be vulnerable in the lyrics, pure 80s sound

**ignitethephoenix** (8): bop!

**Leixander** (8): hate the title love the song

**luckyphase** (8): it was kinda fun but everytime she paused and said "worse" I decreased the score

**phonethephoenix** (8): i like these verses

**Raindrac** (8): I thought that the instrumental of Sorry If I Hurt You was sampled, but apparently it wasn't. Neat, I love how it sounds.

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (7.9): she’s taking ME for granite?

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): still has a lot of the issues that I have with the sound of the album but it's just damn catchy and easy to see why this has become a bit of a fan fave (I think?, if not then maybe it should be!)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): glad she’s finally apologizing for her last three albums

**jman457** (7.5): Sorry If Im a slut for strings

**uberpigeon** (7.5): if the album was called this it would make it her first non-10 title track

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Those strings sound like they were ripped straight out of a JRPG from the 90s

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): i like how british people say granted

**Stryxen** (6.5): Bitch BYE. I will NEVER understand what possesses people to be such C*NTS online.

**UselessTacooo** (6.2): you can tell how quickly mishmashed a few of these deluxe tracks are, but this one sounds semi-okay

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (6): I'm a slut for strings in a song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Me when I give a song a 0 except I’m never sorry.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): you’re forgiven

#Sorry

**JIRACHI** (7.5): it's okay... the intro was so promising but then it got nowhere

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I’m sorry for my score too

**flava** (6): this could’ve been a 10 if it wasn't for the string modulation sounding so robotic and lifeless

**kappyko** (6): My bad

**vayyiqra** (6): me to the hosts with my rushed ballot and bad takes 🚘

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): me anytime i bite my boyfriend for no good reason

**alexismateofan** (5): some words i never thought i’d use are that this song is just way too generic to have any hyper positive or negative feelings on so….

**beeozan** (5): the guy from Genghis Khan made this??

**shhhneak** (4): Damn is she trying to hit a word count with these bonus tracks?

**hikk** (6.5): Like So Nice that has already left this is a very sweet little tune that doesn’t do quite enough to stand out from the crowd and reach the heights of this album. It’s very catchy for sure but that’s about all it has going for it. “I get all my confidence from you” is a line that really resonates with me though because that feeling of feeling loved when you have such pitiful self confidence is so electric, I get her…

**pig-serpent** (4): A perfect song for cruisin’ down the road on a bright sunny day  in a convertible with you SO by your side.  Maybe I just can't relate because I don't have an SO or a convertible, but I'm happy for those of you who do.  But for as fine as this song is, I’m certainly blaming Carly inflation on this song escaping day 1.

#forward

**Leixander** (11): joy in song form

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This was my favorite on release and is still in my top 3 for sure

**queershoulder** (9.7): one of my faves from her new era

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): I checked and I think this is officially the shortest song Carly has ever released? But I don’t mind the length, it works. Short and sweet and I like the lyrical concept.

**jasannn** (9.5): animated sun smiling and singing type of a song

**prettybirbkotori** (9.5): this song makes me feel capable of levitation

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): insane chorus

**AHSWeeknd** (9): She really doesn’t care if she gets run over

**alexismateofan** (9): oh this is the ticket bitch.

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (9): I LOOOOVE to get my way

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): “I get all my confidence from you” Well idk if this is quite ideal…

**IIIHenryIII** (9): ok, the titles of the last two tracks are giving felt this way / stay away

**kappyko** (9): Alexander Payne fans RISE UP!!! i havent seen the movie though i just wanna see if anyone stands up

**reput4tionera** (9): oh this is cute

**sharts-n-farts** (9): This song just makes me feel warm inside :)

**Ambrosia42** (8.9): a vibe

**akanewasright** (8.7): idk I just envision Carly skipping around a stage during this song

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): carly PLEASE stop making these gorgeous songs so short this has so much potential

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): the pauses in the chorus are so cunt

**JIRACHI** (8.5): "i get all my confidence from you" i wish i could say that please

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): a nice follow-up from faraway!

**seanderlust** (8.5): "It is also possible that she simply refuses to be late to her plans and will disregard traffic. Perhaps she means that she has no respect for other cars and will commit glaring moving violations, as her plans are more important." why are carly rae jepsen stans the funniest people on the planet

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): fuck me…

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**\_alien-superstar\_** (8): You cannot put a song called Sideways right next to a song called Far Away. I get confused

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a cute bop that never goes anywhere (but sideways, hehe)

**imbaby122** (8): carly rae jepsen write a song without “way” in the title challenge (impossible)

**oscarbrierley1** (8): cute beachy mid tempo vibe. the chorus is such an earworm for me.

**runaway3212** (8): 34+35 got nothing on this

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): so fucking cute and groovy. the everything he needs of the album for sureee

**vayyiqra** (8): I love guitar 🍐

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): Sweet and calming

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): “i like to get my way even when things go sideways” - m.i.a after winning the cyberpop rate

**nick1372** (7.5): whoever produced this album I am giving you a kiss on the mouth. those twinkles before the chorus!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): We're really just saying "Fuck bridges" huh

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): He Needs Me but not weird

**bloodjet** (7.2): this song feels somewhat overshadowed by far away cause my comment for far away applies to this song too

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it goes get me going from side to side so

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): no carly don't get your confidence from someone else haha ure so sexy

**Nagisoid** (7): This song did what YNCTD tried to do with the parade line

#backward

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Cute but nothing special

**wasian-invasion** (7): a bit too chipper for my taste

**Aoquesth378** (6.5): Catchy but that's all the song really has going for it compared to other tracks on the album. The chorus carries the song.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): im sorry but i swear this was on dedicated side b

**bigbigbee** (6.5): ALL your confidence from them? You wrote Emotion, don’t undersell yourself babe

**DrumBeatGlass** (6.4): Not really memorable. Cool cut, although I don't listen to it unless I go through the whole album

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): see above

**camerinian** (6): cute

**scythersboots** (6): weirdly bright for the subject matter

**skeeturz** (6): i feel largely the same for this one as Far Away but i find Far Away a little more catchier

**uberpigeon** (6): this is her Sometimes

**jman457** (5.5): This sounds like an Andy Grammer song

**flava** (5): is this even a complete song?

**plastichaxan** (5): These lyrics hit so hard I wish it sounded better

**Raindrac** (5): Too short to be remarkable, but still a somewhat sweet song regardless. Good song while listening to the album, but not anything that I'd throw on a playlist or listen to on a whim, and that's ultimately not enough for it to mean much to me.

**thedoctordances1940** (5): this is the side of carly that I just do not remotely care for, I just find this so dull

**beeozan** (4): something went sideways when they were recording this

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (3): This wasn't it.

**shckskndv** (3): I like to get my way too though!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): the only good thing about this song is how short it is

**pig-serpent** (10): Honestly this album was starting to get fairly monotonous, and this is the right time for a song like this, which has the warbling synths and a little bit more abrasion while still fitting in the line up of the album and continuing in the lane of what Carly does best.  I genuinely think this might be my favorite track on the album, it’s one I just keep coming back to and it pops into my head almost daily.  Deserved Day 3, The haters are wrong about this one idc idc.

**hikk** (9): this is fun i had fun IDGAF! It just barely makes day 2 which is something at least but it deserved better. I can see how the vocal filter/processing could be offputting but sometimes a little chipmunk moment is fun idk. The chorus could maybe hit a little bit harder for me but the melodies in the verses are just so delicious.

#my shooting star

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it’s good to know Carly still has hope for New York City

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): it gave me Kylie M. vibes and that placement of Disco Darling lyrics on the bridge is so wonderfully nice and a great way to reduce, reuse and recycle unreleased bops.

**alexismateofan** (10): i’d be more sorry about giving so many songs here a 10 if they didn’t absolutely SERVE.

**beeozan** (10): me when I play Skarner and ult Aurelion Sol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Fun fact - this song actually invented being a silly fun little gal!

**cremeebrulee** (10): she is actually Such a scorpio its unreal (no other sign could write Want You In My Room)

**imbaby122** (10): she really is scorpio this song is horny asf

**jasannn** (10): This song makes me so flirty.

**JIRACHI** (10): KYLIE MINOGUE?????

**just\_thonking** (10): The Kylie Minogue serve

**nick1372** (10): I know y'all don't like the vocal processing but Carly's personality shines through and makes it so euphoric!

**notarobot3675** (10): again im sorry but pls understand that i am obligated, not only as a scorpio, but as someone who shares a bday with queen carly, to give this song a ten

**phonethephoenix** (10): fun and catchy!!

**prettybirbkotori** (10): oh she was in her kylie minogue BAG. anthony fantano i still haven’t forgiven you for putting this as worst track this is incredible

**RandomHypnotica** (10): please Carly give me a whole album with this sound

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is a Kylie Minogue song (complimentary)

**skeeturz** (10): this one shouldn't be a surprise as it seems to be the fan favorite, with good reason!

**Stryxen** (10): her producer yelled STOP RIPPING KYLIE OFF and she heard YASS MAKE THAT PUSSY POP

**vayyiqra** (10): I love autotune! (serious) 🍐

**dreamingpastel** (9.9): Thought I wouldn't like it due to how the vocals are processed, but everything else kinda cancels it out. Only thing I don't REALLY love is the bridge, hence the decimal score.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Wait have I been sleeping on this song it’s way better than I remember

**shipperondeck** (9.3): i used to like this more but it's still great

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): someone once said this is basically a disco-era kylie song and i totally hear it and now i need a duet

**1998tweety** (9): it was camp

**AmandaYoung2083** (9): This song gives me a shot of energy every time I hear it it's SO fun

**Aoquesth378** (9): Her most 'experimental' song on the album and I think it works very well overall, I just wish I liked the vocals more than I do.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): the producer yelled "carly let's go" but she heard "kylie minogue" and just went with it

**Frajer** (9): hey it's not Charli time yet why is this hyperpop

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): scorpio seasonnnn

**impla77** (9): oh.. I’m not a Scorpio.. maybe we’re not twins after all

**plastichaxan** (9): The way most of my crushes have been Scorpio I can kinda understand her other songs better now

**welcome2thejam** (9): The gut instinct to hear that voice effect and call this hyperpop

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): her vocoder moment

**akanewasright** (8): I MIGHT SLEEP WITH YOU TONIGHT

**CrimsonROSET** (8): so Carly DOES know what the star signs are wtf were you on about Jupiter

**DrumBeatGlass** (8): Processed vocals to the highest degree, but I gotta say, it doesn't bother me at all. Her voice is like an instrument here

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8): I don't think I've listened to this since the album came out but this is great! Huge bop

**runaway3212** (8): this being so boppy too

**shckskndv** (8): I understand gripes with the vocal effect, but it doesn’t bother me enough to not enjoy the jubilance here.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): shes trying to be charli xcx so bad rn

**TiltControls** (8): I wish the vocals were a bit let processed on the chorus, but a really fun track otherwise

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): okay kylie minogue!

**wasian-invasion** (8): doesnt deserve to be the first carly song out but realistically it will be

**scythersboots** (7.8): i always forget about this song bc it sounds more like something Remi Wolf would put out?

**babadork** (7.7): I want to like this song more than I do, but the vocal effects don’t work for me.

**jman457** (7.5): Diet 100 gecs

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): this is what I think Kylie minogue sounds like if I haven’t listened to her in awhile

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): don’t love the vocoder effect here but it does bop

**sarcasticsobs** (7.2): That's certainly a vocoder choice one could say! Do really enjoy the instrumental. Okay, nevermind the vocoder is kinda growing on me

**Raindrac** (7): The filters applied to Carly's vocals really work on this song. It sounds good and helps make Shooting Star stand out amongst the rest of The Loneliest Time. It has a good bridge too, something that I appreciate on an album where the songs are often a little too short for my taste.

**seanderlust** (7): "if you wanna know why [i'm gonna sleep with you] just because i still believe in my new york city" this makes no sense why is it so valid

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Kay pawp

hikkaru: #hybe antis

**bloodjet** (6): idk it just kinda fell flat to my ears

**kwcty6888** (6): let’s stick to shooting for the moon

**shhhneak** (6): Carly’s a Scorpio? No because I would take a bullet for them now.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Horoscopes 🙄🙄

**camerinian** (5.5): I have no idea if this vocal processing is a terrible fit for Carly or if it brings some much needed variety to the album. Someone please have an opinion for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): I like the actual song but unfortunately her voice is quite annoying here.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): carly rae chippette

**kappyko** (5): Remember the glee episode whe

**Nagisoid** (5): I'd never thought I would say this but XG outsold Carly

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (4): This was weird and I'm glad it's the only one on this album.

**Leixander** (4): very disco era kylie (derogatory)

**oscarbrierley1** (4): the autotune is so attrocious it kills the song, her vocals sound like when they get a side disney tv character to do a song.

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): I cannot with this autotune

**thedoctordances1940** (3): I've just got to the point where I'm so fed up of 99% of the funky nu-disco sound in modern pop music, it just immediately evokes a negative reaction I can't do anything about in me and so few songs are able to get past that

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): ASDVBFGJKFDVDFJVNFDJK chipmunk ass

**hikk** (9): I wish this had done better, for me it’s definitely the best of the if you are BRAVE it’s because you can SLAY tracks on this album. In general I’m not a huge fan of the Kelly Clarkson DCOM style she goes for a lot here, but Hurricanes is very tight in its execution and in a quality small dosage like this I can get into the fantasy.

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Another cheesy, shimmering, and empty power ballad. Out of all the songs on this album that fall into this category for me, this is the best one of the bunch.  That said, yeah I think this is a good placement for it.

---

#NOT THE GIRL I TRIED TO BE YESTERDAY!

**pheromenos** (11): only baddies will get it

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Dorothy can probably relate, although she dealt with a tornado

**apatel27** (10): Big Mood in Self Sabotage

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Part of me feels like this song might be a mess…but the rest of me doesn’t care.

**dreamingpastel** (10): The Disney Channel rock of it all scratches my brain in just the right way.

**impla77** (10): I just really love songs that are slay to walk to

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Such a dope tune this one.

**queershoulder** (10): my absolute favorite from this album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): a sound of wall? is this shoegays?

**reput4tionera** (10): the superior 2000s teen movie end credits song

**shhhneak** (10): This song was taken straight from the cracks of Kelly Clarkson’s Wayfair couch cushions.

**throwaway-7650** (10): "april shower" omfg another rina x seventeen interaction I live!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): maybe my fav rina vocal performance. just so good

**Ambrosia42** (9.7): the way it builds up energy the whole song omg

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I bet she was a rockstar in her past life

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): straightest thing she's done and i love it

**camerinian** (9): 2000s radio rock loudness war type beat (complimentary, somehow)

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): her mid-00s kelly clarkson serve

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the beginning is slow and a bit corny but the chorus kicks in nicely

**kappyko** (9): Somebody joked about the mixing being bad bc it made her sound like she was in a hurricane but unironically i was kinda thinking that lol my bad

**seanderlust** (9): THE BRIDGE!!!

**shckskndv** (9): “I created a storm and buried it deep, hiding the key in plain sight in case I need help” is ???? but the chorus is quite lovely.

**Stryxen** (9): this grew on me a lot. That hook is undeniable as are most of the melodies, and i love the instrumental it feels so hectic but still clearly carefully put together - and it doesn’t last too long!

**TiltControls** (9): This one grew on me quite a bit after the album released. Sounds like it was plucked right out of the mid 2000s in the best way

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): I'm going to be called insane for having this and Catch Me in the Air as 2 of my highest scores from this album aren't I. But I'm just a sucker for pop rock like this, I can't help but love this

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.6): She's proud of the lyrics and for a good reason. She brought this Kelly Clarkson Since U Been Gone energy in and killed it

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.5): this is a J-rock song, but one I wouldn't mind playing on a radio station.

**modulum83** (8.3): could you guess i’m an imagine dragons fan?

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): I get that the guitar songs on this album are a little too straightforward for some people but I’ve been craving some solid mid-2000s pop rock bangers and she kinda delivers with this and phantom

**akanewasright** (8): the little dose of distortion is DELICIOUS

**alexismateofan** (8): my second favorite song titled Hurricanes, if you can believe it.

**Awkward\_King** (8): girl you not avatar

**CrimsonROSET** (8): why don’t more pop stars do arena rock this rips

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Pop rock n roll

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): me telling my choice specs pelipper what move to pick

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this is so hilary duff'd (complimentary)

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This feels like the only big song on this album she did right

**jman457** (7.6): Spring

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (7.5): I love when rina is in her Disney channel era

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): seems too similar to other songs on the album but isn't bad by any means

**runaway3212** (7.5): she's kinda giving but not all the way

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): ps2 racing game-core

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): That bridge 😌 she could have kept everything else though ☺️

**ricki** (7.3): disney channel original song (if you are BRAVE!!...)

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): I like this but the opening line of April showers never worked for me.

**Aoquesth378** (7): I saw someone call it a Kelly Clarkson ripoff on the sub and I haven't been able to think of this song any other way since.

**jasannn** (7): the best of the poprockish songs here

**JIRACHI** (7): this is cute

**skeeturz** (7): it's pretty alright, it reminds me of early 2000's popgirl music

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): when the main character of the DCOM finally lets loose at the climax

**welcome2thejam** (7): Solid pop rock track, feels like a Kelly Clarkson hit that was lost to time

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): mid-2000s teen movie music but not in a bad way

# ... still not brave and can't slay

**bookthieving** (6): i hate pureed soups bc it reminds me of baby food and that's what this mix sounds like

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this is so interlude music for a 2000s MTV reality show lol. it’s giving Laguna Beach

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Feels a bit basic

**just\_thonking** (6): Bridgina Mendlayama

**Leixander** (6): she'd sound way better if she was trying less

**Nagisoid** (6): New Orleans' impact... iconic

**ReallyCreative** (6): I want to like this song but it's just so generic

**beeozan** (5.5): ok we get it chill

**bloodjet** (5): this is pretty forgettable except for the "so won't you give me a sign" part, which i love

**imbaby122** (5): everything about this song gives me sensory overload. this first time i heard it i was high and i started getting really scared.

**prettybirbkotori** (5): i think this is the most boring song she’s ever made and the mixing on the chorus does NOT sound good

**Raindrac** (5): I'm noticing that finding yourself is an important theme of Hold The Girl, perhaps the most important outright. I've already found myself, so I don't have much to relate to; I've got other problems. But I still appreciate hearing her story, and there's a lot of energy in this track. But yet again, can I get some better mixing? It's rough, so rough that I don't really want to come back to this.

**vayyiqra** (5): [trying to be witty and failing] uh yeah Storm from X-Men be like 🫂

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): Rina aimed to be Kelly Clarkson-lite but this song turned out to be Chris Daughtry-lite instead

**ktajlili** (4): meh

**shipperondeck** (3): this song makes me mad why is it so cliche

**uberpigeon** (3): https://twitter.com/findurtiktok/status/1603575488278044673

**moonshxne** (2.5): there was a dual-vector foil in that hurricane. not only do i hate how it sounds, the drums are literally migraine-inducing

**pig-serpent** (5): I’ve never been a fan of this kind of inspirational pop rock where the chorus ends up sounding more hollow than big.  I do think the verses are pretty solid but that hook is so nothing to me, and the “ay-ee-ay-ee-ay-ee” is pretty annoying.  Overall, I get the appeal but it’s not for me, and I think around the halfway point is a reasonable spot for this to fall in.  It’s pretty fitting that it was joined to the hip with Hurricanes.

**hikk** (3): The parts of Hold the Girl that tackle this mid-00s inspirational pop rock sound are really not up my alley for the most part, and for the majority opinion they seem to be a mixed bag as we lose two back to back in the middle of the rate. Having this snooze so early in the tracklist is unfortunate for me, but more power to the people that find comfort in this song because I do recognize how personal it is to Rina and how it can be very relatable to other people.

---

#happy mother's day

**dreamingpastel** (11): Even when I first listened to it back in August last year, it just had such a timeless feeling to it. (And by "timeless" I mean "could be played in the credits of an early 2000's movie starring someone like Amanda Bynes or Lindsey Lohan.) I'm still not tired of listening to it, so yeah. It's my 11.

**TiltControls** (11): This song is basically the type of mom-pop (get it) P!nk makes now but Rina's soaring vocal moments during this song make it impossible not to give it my 11

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**AHSWeeknd** (10): idk how she managed to add the action of cutting onions into the production of this song

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): The queer daughter of immigrant mother energy in this song... is so powerful

**Ambrosia42** (10): epic and somewhat nostalgic and the chorus is just delectable

**Aoquesth378** (10): Idk if it's everybody's cup of tea but I am obsessed with it. I heard it in a JC Penny and was blown away that I was hearing Rina in public.

**camerinian** (10): this is the closest this album gets to really recapturing the intoxicating magic of the last album. I love the sweetness of the narrative and the swells make all the emotions feel euphoric. What an anthem.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i had so many takes this rate and the only one I got pushback for was calling this a ballad oh it’s bad for me

**DirtyRat583** (10): ok ive said im a balladphobe before but im not a balladphobe im a piano-and-guitar-balladphobe and it just so happens that most ballads nowadays are exactly that. but this isnt so

**DrumBeatGlass** (10): Pure gold. Moving, girl didn't have to be so descriptive in her words, but she did THAT again. This eeyah eeyah eeyah adds so much to the song

**flava** (10): she put her full pussy into that key change

**Frajer** (10): Stuart Price you will always be famous

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is the song that plays in a 2008 coming of age movie that fundamentally changes you as a person.

**jman457** (10): A nice little smashing pumpkins riff that gives 90’s coming of age realness

**kappyko** (10): Kappy in the Air

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (10): balladphobia is probably going to knock this one out earlier than it deserves, and to be fair I wasn't a huge fan of this song either at first, but something clicked the first time I heard it in the context of the full album and now I can't listen to this in public cause the opening notes literally make me tear up like some kind of fucked up pavlovian response for people with mommy issues

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I can already picture this playing in the emotional climax of a DCOM movie

**runaway3212** (10): She did not have to slay so much but girl did she

**seanderlust** (10): this song legitimately makes me tear up.

**shhhneak** (10): balladphobia sit this one out!! the outro is so cathartic for that mother-child relationship.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this scratches the nostalgic mother-loving bone in me they could never make me hate you

**throwaway-7650** (10): happy late mother's day!

**xxipil0ts** (10): true story but i cried abt this when i watched the concert stream.

**apatel27** (9.5): Big Mood in Generational Trauma

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (9): This one is so delicate and hopeful and sure knows how to build to a chorus.

**akanewasright** (9): her doing this live before the song came out >>>

**alexismateofan** (9): just absolute amazement of a song, it was so flowy and beautiful i feel like i’m really in love with this song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This hit for me like right before the rate! We love that!

**impla77** (9): This is what I love about this album.. the melodrama. I get how it can seem too much, but I’m v invested in this album so again it hits

**modulum83** (9): she’s tapping into her inner child i’m tapping into my inner soccer mom

**phonethephoenix** (9): hAIR short of perfection

**ReallyCreative** (9): I need the outro verse part to be LONGER

**uberpigeon** (9): this song is way too earnest and saccharine and yet somehow it got through to my cold and wretched heart

**wasian-invasion** (9): for some reason this song immediately makes me start tearing up (i blame the shared language of having an asian mom)

**shipperondeck** (8.9): grew on me a lot

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Saw someone describe this as something from a direct to video Barbie film and while it’s not that good, I do enjoy it.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Could've probably done with a cold end instead of a fadeout but whatever. Still a good tune.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I didn't felt it as first, but as I listen more to it, I grew to like it.

**buddhacharm** (8): LEAVE CATCH ME IN THE AIR ALONE! LEAVE IT ALONE! Sure it's cliche but so is all of the album. And I KNOW you bitches are gonna gas Frankenstein to the top 20 or whatever. LEAVE CATCH ME IN THE AIR ALONE!

**JIRACHI** (8): AIR YEE AIR YEE AIR YEE AIR YEE AIR YEE AIRRRR

**welcome2thejam** (8): Liked this one, nice ballad, didn't feel overdone

**queershoulder** (7.8): this one just never stuck with me

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): one thing I noticed when I first listened to this album is that actually I do quite like this and I was maybe a bit too harsh on it when it came out as a single

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): the hook gets tiring but she's cute

**prettybirbkotori** (7): when this single released it was when i started to lose faith in the album, but i think i was a bit unfair to it. it’s a cute moment

**reput4tionera** (7): like it lyrically but it crosses the line of y2k inspired and just sounds like 2000s teen movie end credits music

**scythersboots** (7): its giving cinematic 00’s pop

**skeeturz** (7): it's very nice and pleasant

**UselessTacooo** (7): it’s giving teen romance credits song (derogatory)

**vayyiqra** (7): Really like the detailed backstory about her mom that rocks 🫂

hikkaru: #dropped

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Caroline would have slayed this. Unfortunately it's Rina signing and she kinda turns it into a tie-in single for a direct-to-dvd kids movie about horse girls

**ricki** (6.8): i wish i had stronger feelings about this (if you are BRAVE!!...)

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): she forgot the chorus is what usually makes a song good

**imbaby122** (6.5): this song has the same irritating charm of a disney channel original movie

**ktajlili** (6.5): I like the concept, but I can't help but here in the aYAYAYAYAY. Thanks pitchfork.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): her very obviously lip syncing the high note on tour will forever live in my heart. do we need both this and hurricanes? they sound a bit too similar for me

**Nagisoid** (6): I Don't Really Care If Something Good Happened to You. It Should Have Happened to Me Instead

**slimboyfriend** (6): was excited hearing this live… then the studio version came out with that weak production and that wimpy fade-out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this is like american teenager but if it was mid

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): very emotionally attached to this one but on an objective level, it is sort of middle of the road

**notarobot3675** (5.8): a song thats nice but a little forgettable and feels weak in comparison to the rest of her discog

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): i’d let her fall

**sarcasticsobs** (5.5): Liked it live but idk now

**shesdoingyoga** (5): I just don’t really care for this one but that’s mostly for the subject matter

**Awkward\_King** (4): this song is for people trying to mend the relationship with their mother and im not

**bloodjet** (4): the chorus is so annoying lol. the rest of the song is okay-ish but unremarkable

**Raindrac** (4): Fairly generic anthemic pop song. I appreciate the sentiment, but it's not really worth coming back to.

**moonshxne** (3.4): i adore the melody! too bad it's like the only thing going for it, (seriously, compressing the chorus like *that* makes zero sense! rina is supposedly flying but what do we hear? literal dimensional collapse)

**beeozan** (3): so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed just to get it all out what's in my head and I'm feeling a little peculiar and so I wake in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath and get real and I scream from the top of my lungs catch me in the aiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiair

**Stryxen** (3): really don’t like that chorus and the random sudden shift to adult contemporary was not a choice i would’ve made !

**Leixander** (2): i'd rather not x

**shckskndv** (2): on the Table Manners podcast, Rina revealed that she has become lactose intolerant. I can understand why Catch Me In The Air was written, then; as a coping mechanism. It’s cheesy as hell.

**thatplatypus99** (2): this is probably the lowest ranking I’ve ever given a song in a rate it is straight up bad

**frogaranaman** (1): sorry I cannot do this rn. ask me in like a year

**hikk** (7): I liked this when it came out but I accidentally looped it while grinding smth in a video game and i got sick of it instantly and have not listened since. it’s ok actually… but as someone that likes all these acts i’m still not gagged

**pig-serpent** (7): A very pleasant song to listen to, but it’s never made a real impression on me.  I fully agree with this being the first Charli song to leave.

---

**1998tweety** (10): rare 1975 W

**modulum83** (10): THE 1975 MENTIONED :wah:

**RandomHypnotica** (10): No Rome is the only one without a link to Taylor now...

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): me when i spin

**vayyiqra** (10): I listened to an EP by No Rome once for Popheads album club and it was cool! Underrated! Love these vocal effects and the piano! Not sure why the 1975 are here and I have no comment about that!

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this is the charger remix of the rate

**imbaby122** (9): ik we’re all experiencing a lot of matty healy trauma right now but this song did not get the attention it deserved.

**ktajlili** (9): This is a great

**reput4tionera** (9): would be 10 if it was the ag cook remix

**wasian-invasion** (9): what happened to rome

**welcome2thejam** (9): SPEEN

**xxipil0ts** (9): i will die on this hill that this is a good song

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): not sure if I have a justification for this but I like this song!

**shhhneak** (8.4): You won’t catch me tanking The 1975’s average today.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it’s a mess but it's pleasant

**Nagisoid** (8): The top in Inception:

**queershoulder** (8): pretty good

**shckskndv** (8): the best thing about this track is the little animated drawings of the musicians, and it’s a pretty great song itself

**jman457** (7.6): The way charli and Taylor are Iniut sisters omg

**beeozan** (7.5): a little matty healy jumpscare but still good

**DrumBeatGlass** (7.5): playful with more of 1975 style, but I'm not mad

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): (ft. charli + the 19 7.5)

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): as long as i ignore matty healy’s involvement with this its pretty good

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): it's fine.

**alexismateofan** (7): Some good ass vocals together, sounds really fun actually. After some of Charli’s songs I listened to, this is like pretty enjoyable.

**ricki** (7): were the news of the taylor relationship released late enough for every comment of this song to be about that?

**shipperondeck** (7): ive never consciously listened to a 1975 song before this one sooo where does the raw meat eater come in

**skeeturz** (7): it's pretty okay and dancey

**moonshxne** (6.8): 빙빙

**Aoquesth378** (6): It's a nice song, not my favorite

**frogaranaman** (6): this song is either life changing or the most annoying thing you’ve ever heard and it changes every listen

**runaway3212** (6): boringcore

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): https://twitter.com/peepfictionn/status/1563247890343964673

**Ambrosia42** (5.9): tbh I like the A.G. Cook remix more, but it’s decent

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): not too big on this tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (5): as much as I love CRASH idk why I can’t get into Charli’s regular sound, maybe I’m the problem

**prettybirbkotori** (5): i actually like this song but it loses 2 points for being promo for some nft bullshit

**Stryxen** (5): wrdgaf

**UselessTacooo** (5): dollar tree video game music

**thedoctordances1940** (4.8): on the lastfm page for this track somebody commented "Charli really can do wrong" and I was gonna agree with them but then it turns out they had made a typo and wanted to say she can do no wrong but let's be honest, they were right the first time around, and in their subconscious they know that this song is entirely forgettable and uninteresting

**sarcasticsobs** (4.5): Saw someone say this plays to none of their strengths, and that articulates my exact feelings on this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Respectfully, this kinda sounds like ass.

**DaHumanTorch** (4): how did a combo of such great artists make such a boring song

**impla77** (4): I think I just had an allergic reaction To Matthew Healy

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (3): sounds like what an ai would spit out if asked to make a charli/1975 collab

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (2): I have to assume their talents just cancel each other out.

**nick1372** (2): this gives me a headache it's way too busy

**luckyphase** (1): on principal because matt healy's brain is controlled by a fungus

**pig-serpent** (5): I get the appeal of this song I think, but I’m not sure It’s really for me.  I think it’s cool to see Carly branching out more into this style of indie pop, I think it suits her skillset really well, it’s just not a type of music I normally enjoy listening to.  I’m not surprised the sub as a whole was reasonably split on this one, with the song marking the beginning of the top half of the rate.

**hikk** (3): Probably my least favourite song on the album and though it's cliche to say, a really worrying first look into this album. It's not horribly out of place amongst everything else but it's certainly not really what the album as a whole is going for so I think it's a pretty poor lead single in that regard, but also more than anything I just find it extremely boring. Honestly I'm surprised it did this well and if it wasn't a single it probably would have flopped a lot more.

---

#blink three times when u feel it kicking in

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Not as bad as Popheads made it out to be

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I really like the sound of this sign but unfortunately, the only other song in this album with the vibes like this happens to be my least favorite off this album.

**alexismateofan** (10): probably a mildly unpopular opinion, I really love Western Wind. It just feels so relaxing and something we really haven’t had from Carly before, especially not as a single. Overall, it got me EXCITED for her upcoming album which ended up way different than Western Wind but still.

**Ambrosia42** (10): some people complained when this dropped as the first single (or were determined she was about to release her Solar Power even though it sounds nothing like that???), but they just didn’t understand her understated slay idk

**apatel27** (10): Lovely Spring Vibes

**bogo** (10): i see the california redemption arc in carly’s discography is still going strong

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): man i did not understand this at all as a lead single but it really reveals itself over time. so delicate and intricate and really highlights her best songwriting sensibilities

**cremeebrulee** (10): thinking about when this dropped and everyone thought we finally an album to rate solar power against

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): underrated fr

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I went nuts after this came out. I thought she was going to deliver a Solar Power type of album but boy was I wrong.

**Leixander** (10): wish the rest of the song could evoke the same energy of the intro (still a 10 nevertheless)

**nick1372** (10): I just realized how genius it was to place this after Bends in the tracklist... after a devastating song about familial death it feels like a warm and comforting hug.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): remember when she released the pirate map teaser... we lost out on a pirate era

**throwaway-7650** (10): the way this would get a higher average if it wasn't the lead

**xxipil0ts** (10): im just gonna go soft and say this is peak cuddle music

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (9.8): thinking about moving the tables and blasting the music for thanksgiving hmm…

**bloodjet** (9.5): i love how nostalgic this song feels. it's like daydreaming under a tree shade while a light breeze is blowing through

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): i looped this like 100 times while playing Stardew Valley and it might have been the happiest 3 hours of my life

**memezaharamole** (9.5): Rostam with Carly is consistently great, Rostam has the midas touch imo

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I’m still not 100% in love with the sound of this but the album did help me appreciate it a lot more.

**Frajer** (9): Carly in her Solar Power era, still a weird choice for a lead single but I appreciate it more now

**impla77** (9): this is such a laidback vibe

**sarcasticsobs** (9): chillin' on the beach at sunset with a cool breeze blowing-ass song (complimenary)

**seanderlust** (9): this one grew on me a lot since i first heard it! in the context of the album i like it a lot better

**TiltControls** (9): An odd choice of starting single considering the rest of the album's vibe. Still a good song, just one that maybe would've been better left as a fun deep cut

**UselessTacooo** (9): I used this song to help me during my science exam I hope western winds are actually warm❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

**vayyiqra** (9): This was boring and underwhelming the first time I heard it but it's really grown on me! 🍐

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.5): I remember when we thought it was going to be Carly's Folklore era. The guitar break is just delightful. This one is probably the most interesting track on the album and really different from others.

**jasannn** (8.5): I’m glad this wasn’t her solar power era.

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): another song that took a bit to grow on me but I do really like it!

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): i do not agree with this song’s place as lead single but i love it either way

**Stryxen** (8.5): this was so overhated at release but it’s also not my fav

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): sometimes on the chorus i pretend that instead of her saying "what is love" she's singing to her secret Russian lover Vladislav

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Call Me Maybe continues to be her best lead single

**Nagisoid** (8): She was so close to saying First Love / Late Spring, but us Mitski stans will have to keep waiting for recognition

**queershoulder** (8): solid

**ReallyCreative** (8): the way she can't pick a good lead single to save her life... she really is going to be featured on 1989 huh

**scythersboots** (8): this was one of my favorites in 2022, allegedly, but I feel like..it’s not v Carly? Also something about the way she says CAULifornia is weird to me.

**shckskndv** (8): I didn’t get it as a single, but a real breath of fresh air in the tracklist.

**skeeturz** (8): i am very fond of this, it's a very different sound than we're used to from her and I love it

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): so thoroughly gorgeous, the vocal layering, the percussion, the visuals...

**uberpigeon** (8): this was such a weird first single

**welcome2thejam** (8): Crazy, my fingers just started automatically typing things like "#Coachellavibes 😎☀️"

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): dropping this as a lead was such a choice…

**ricki** (7.8): and this is when i knew that not all ph faves are built the same bc lorde got crucified for pulling the same stunt

**Aoquesth378** (7.5): It's a slower more indie-inspired song but I think it actually works for the album, even if it was a poor lead single imo. I do like the build to the instrumental bridge.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): This song definitely grew on me but I do remember I was a little SPOOKED when this was the first single released…I shouldn’t have doubted!

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): the way I lost all hope for the album when this dropped and then it slightly grew on me

**ktajlili** (7.5): I think this is over-hated in the sub. It's nice! and cute! and well written! It's not like the best Carley song but it's still pretty good. I like it.

**runaway3212** (7.5): this was a test and we passed

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): Kind of underwhelmed me when it first came out but now I appreciate it more

hikkaru: **shipperondeck** (7.4): improves as the weather does

**jman457** (7.3): Kind of wished it built to something more

**beeozan** (7): we needed Solar Power vs Western Wind vs Dirt Femme vs Blue Water Road and Charli could be Azula

**imbaby122** (7): if this song wasn’t the lead single i genuinely don’t know if i would be able to tell it apart from far away.

**kappyko** (7): using this space to say the above two jokes only make sense for the people taking in the ballot my bad

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): ooo atmosphere

**notarobot3675** (6.9): i was very lukewarm to this song when it was first released but in the context of the album i think its lovely


#i still hate california after all

**CrimsonROSET** (6): even in context of the album this is such a weird choice for a first single

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): coming in like a snoozy skip

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Rostam I know you know how to put together a good instrumental so why did you give her this solar power reject

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (5): This got better over time but I wouldn't respect someone if this was their fave Carly track.

**Awkward\_King** (5): while i maintain i was very underwhelmed with this on release i will also admit i am a hater and it is perfectly fine just much too mellow for me!

**camerinian** (5): *farts*

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): She was so shady to release this as the lead single lol

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (5): still not a huge fan of this one, as much as I enjoy the laid-back vibe of most songs on the album I feel like this is just a bit too laid-back for me? I just don't think it's particularly catchy or memorable

**Raindrac** (5): It's pleasant, but a song as mellow as this needs something interesting that'll capture my attention, and Western Wind lacks anything of that sort. It follows the mellow indie pop formula far too closely.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): I genuinely keep forgetting this exists, I do not get why this was picked as a lead single and then left on the album while party for one, which is better than anything that actually did make it onto dedicated, was left off that album

**JIRACHI** (4): this is kinda bland i did not remember anything from it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): the people who were mad at carly when this song dropped and everyone hated it had a point

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): so robotic

**oscarbrierley1** (1): the song stopping me from having a tove lo bottom 5. its so boring it put me off listening to any of the other singles until the album came out.

**hikk** (8): This has a really nice bassline and I enjoy it every time I hear it but there's quite a few other songs on the album that I return to more. Right about in the middle of the rate seems apt to me, therefore.

**pig-serpent** (6): The hook to this song is trash but the rest of the song grew on me significantly so I couldn’t tank it too hard :/  And honestly, I think the whole song might be growing on me more over time too.  That said, I’m happy to continue cutting Carly songs at this point in the rate so bye bye.

#yew tew

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Idk U2 reference I guess.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): girl fuck them kids and FUCK U2

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): U2 have been real quiet since this dropped

**CrimsonROSET** (9): me when someone asks me to name the u2 album wasn’t the one that was on everyone’s iPhones for free

**vayyiqra** (9): I love U2 🍐

**runaway3212** (9): this album being frontloaded just like a similar U2 album

**sarcasticsobs** (8): I love U2

**Frajer** (8): always forget Joshua Tree is a real place and not just a U2 album

**impla77** (6.7): I really love the verses (Carly is Aphrodite its true), but the Baby Shark chorus brings this down. Also I hate U2 :)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): my u2 stanning dad would call this song blasphemy

#tree enjoyers

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): My favorite off this album this should be her new sound ugh.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “I’m like Aphrodite, and it’s fine to only know things I know” This line floors me every time

**Awkward\_King** (10): oh this fucks so hard.. groovy beat... horny carly... but who is josh

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): i am feeling dramatic and i do like the moon and the magic

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): i wanna sit on one

**throwaway-7650** (10): julien, joshua... who's next, jimmy neutron?

**UselessTacooo** (10): How does this have anything to do with Joshua Tree help

**shipperondeck** (9.6): the da da das can get the tiniest bit monotonous both otherwise this is so good

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): carly california song ranking goes LA Hallucinations > this > NIDHCAA

**1998tweety** (9): idk ha but this bops

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): doing drugs in a desert seems like a thing that should've been on everyone's bucket list.

**alexismateofan** (9): baby carly knew that what i wanted was this song.

**Aoquesth378** (9): OBSESSED. The beat/production of the song goes hard and the song flows very well on top of being catchy.

**prettybirbkotori** (9): the verses are so hot and then the chorus is an absolute jam i love

**sharts-n-farts** (9): dadadadadada is my favourite part.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): imma be honest i have no idea what this has to do with the national park like it could just be about a boy with first name Joshua last name Tree and i'd be like yeah

**welcome2thejam** (9): She saw Charlie Puth leave a track behind when he fell back to earth after Attention and said "well if nobody else wants to use this"

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): one of her most sensual grooves

**akanewasright** (8.5): :titty:

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): i always forget how this one goes based on the title for some reason, but it’s good

**beeozan** (8.5): the lalalalas are catchy idc

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): (i will climb) joshua (from seventeen like a) tree

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8.5): I like it, dadadadadada

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): What's with the abrupt ass ending though

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): huh why did they name a tree after the drivers license boy

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I was expecting some type of folk song with this title but I got a groovy ass bop instead

**imbaby122** (8): so obsessed with this song until it turns into a jcpenney commercial in the chorus.

**queershoulder** (8): mellow

**reput4tionera** (8): it’s fine

**saviorARMY101** (8): makes me wanna go on a road trip

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): Carly announcing the album with a billboard promoting Western Wind that was right on the edge of Joshua Tree… if she really wanted the promo to serve she would’ve made this the lead single for that billboard to promote instead

**DrumBeatGlass** (7.5): Another short cut, I appreciate the little experiments, but gosh that last chorus/outro should be longer. If only she released a longer version, this track would be a 9

**JIRACHI** (7.5): that chorus has been stuck in my head for days help

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): I’ve been trying to be more accepting of songs being short these days since so many of them are, and I do like this one but girl this song really needed a last chorus it ends way too abruptly

**uberpigeon** (7.5): she's trying to be cunty but its just a little vaginal... but i support the attempt!

**\_alien-superstar\_** (7): “I'm feeling dramatic / I like the moon and the magic” is a good thesis statement for the whole album. Lovely pre chorus, same about the actual chorus.

**apatel27** (7): Her voice doesn't really work with this style

**bogo** (7): i can’t wait for carly’s next album where she makes a song called “achtung baby”

**modulum83** (7): carly stfu about california challenge

**Raindrac** (7): Groovy song with lyrics that bring to mind imagery of driving through a scorching hot night in the Californian desert. I like it.

#who is joshua

**Stryxen** (7): this was so fun to sing along to live although its never been my fav

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): i hate to say it - i hope i don't sound ridiculous - i don't know who this national park is. i mean, he could be walking down the street, i wouldn't know. sorry to this national park.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Not this k-pop-ass chorus

**jman457** (6.9): The guitar was nice, but something feels missing

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): cute idea but it’s kinda underwritten

**nick1372** (6): Joshua Tree National Park is an extremely overrated park near LA that is basically a desert with some funky trees. There's literally nothing to do or see there. I can see why Carly had no inspiration and could only come up with nonsense baby talk for this chorus.

**ReallyCreative** (6): hey diva, you know I'm just not feeling this one

**ricki** (6): 🌳sunday morning

**seanderlust** (6): top ten songs that made me google "who is joshua" before realizing exactly how vague that search is

**skeeturz** (6): it's perfectly serviceable and i don't hate it but it doesn't have much oomph to me outside of the absolutely infectious chorus

**camerinian** (5): those "da da da"s are… kinda mind numbing huh

**shckskndv** (5): Carly is in a toxic relationship with California/LA. Every single album has a song about it. This ones fine

**slimboyfriend** (5): one good thing about climate change is that maybe after California burns to the ground people will stop making bad songs about it

**Nagisoid** (4): That chorus is way too close to 7 Rings for comfort I fear

**RandomHypnotica** (3.8): I kinda fucking hate that chorus actually

**thedoctordances1940** (3.3): chorus is just so annoying

**flava** (3): this one felt painfully awkward before just ending with Carly sounding very thin, also that opening guitar melody sounding suspiciously close to the beat on Superstar by Jamelia

**hikk** (10): I love how she delivers the lyrics here, you can tell she is PISSED….. the production is dramatic to match and fits the lyrical content fantastically. The part when she says “you fucked with my life.” and then the prod goes crazy ouuuu I ascend every time…. this deserved better tbh at least an 8+ average!

**pig-serpent** (5): This is another song that feels almost cool to me.  It has a good tone and I think it achieves an epic feeling, but there's no real moment of catharsis, it's not very catchy, and the song just stops instead of ending properly.  And I mean, I don’t want to harp on the production for every song, but… 

 Anyway, I think this song placed in a fine spot.

---

#YOU FUCKED WITH MY LIFE.

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): A hard listen but it goes hard.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): PAINNNNN personified ✨

**akanewasright** (10): [AAAAEEEAYYYYY AAAAEEEAYYYY](https://www.icegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/icegif-983.gif)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): another great song here as well!

**Ambrosia42** (10): The NIN-inspired production slays, and I love the lyrics too. Growing up as a kid, I really thought adults knew what they were doing and trusted in them, and then I got older and realized a lot of adults are just dumb or deliberately harm others for their own benefit

**beeozan** (10): the start of the slay section

**cremeebrulee** (10): the only ethical grimes song

**CrimsonROSET** (10): FUCK EM UP RINA

**DirtyRat583** (10): absolutely crazy

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this album needed more grungy songs like this to be honest - the ‘you fucked with my life’ line before the bridge felt like a real moment.

**jman457** (10): This is for the STFU/XS 11 gurlies

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (10): the OUTRO

**nick1372** (10): I was turned off at first because I hear an instrumental like this and expect a vapid pop song that appropriates some "exotic" aesthetic. But this is actually one of her best tracks ever and has the exciting experimentation that y'all loved from SAWAYAMA

**notarobot3675** (10): oof what a song!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): 25

**sarcasticsobs** (10): THERE'S the Rina + Clarence chemistry I've been missing

**sharts-n-farts** (10): The anger on this song is what makes it for me.

**skeeturz** (10): this song is raw and goes hard

**Stryxen** (10): i never really think about this one because its between my two favs and has just kinda been there whenever i think about the tracklist but i’m paying attention now… so good…

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): dear john (tv) mashup with this when

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I'm not even there yet and I feel this so hard

**uberpigeon** (10): i survived a social suicide after i zeroes green day in ratrick

**UselessTacooo** (10): banjo slayery

**shipperondeck** (9.8): i was blasting this through my earbuds in public transit this week while coming home from work because 50 middle schoolers were simultaneously belting taylor swift songs in the train car

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): some of her most sickening production ever like to even think about this combo... yas

**1998tweety** (9.5): i mean come on now

**bogo** (9): YEAH GET HIS ASS

**Frajer** (9): when she says she survived the social suicide she means her and Cady were in Mathletes together

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): If I were the person Rina was writing these songs about I would combust

**impla77** (9): I feel like this could be a highlight but just is not quite there. I still really like it!

**jasannn** (9): seeing this live with rave type lights was amazing

**JIRACHI** (9): this is so good

**just\_thonking** (9): It's kind of giving Garbage? The band not the thing

**Nagisoid** (9): Rina joining the school of Kendrick and Lorde of claiming not to be our saviors, the jointslay...

**runaway3212** (9): another song that became so much better after hearing it live

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the only thing keeping this from being a 10 for me is that the lyrics sound a little corny to me…like yeah i know this is a deeply personal song but i just think that “why did you do it, what the hell were you thinking?” is such weak lyricism coming from rina who’s usually really good at writing lyrics

**DaHumanTorch** (8.8): YOU FUCKED WITH MY LIFE.

**bloodjet** (8.5): p4k comparing this song to gayle is so funny. anyway we need more song abt queer anger

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): this song is raw but it does work!

**Aoquesth378** (8): A skip in first listen but I think I'm obsessed listening to it again for the rate.

**apatel27** (8): Big Mood in Hating Abusers

**ktajlili** (8): I really love the sound of tracks 6-9.

**shckskndv** (8): REALLY GREAT gym music.

**TiltControls** (8): I wish this song was a tiny bit longer since it does a great job building up and then just kind of ends, but it's still a blast to listen to

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): that string instrumental intro is such a moment

**vayyiqra** (8): why did nobody tell me that Rina goes full Trent Reznor on this album more than once 🫂

**scythersboots** (7.9): I love to hear women’s anger in music.

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (7.8): finally 29…

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): trying to get me to doxx myself she thinks she's smart huh

**imbaby122** (7.5): I Survived: A Social Suicide

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): this song has a lot of potential but it doesn't quite work for me

**DrumBeatGlass** (7): Thank God she didn't make the beginning melody a whole song. The transition into the last chorus is weird and takes some time to get used to. She's furious and I'm here for it

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the message but sonically it’s not my thing

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it kinda grew on me

**Raindrac** (7): [Is this Loss?](https://i.imgur.com/kGQ7hI3.png) Anyway, I can't wait to relate to this song in 9 years once I'm the age of a certain someone who betrayed me.

hikkaru: #what the hell were you thinking???

**camerinian** (6.5): I really like how, conceptually, so many big pop girls are trying to do industrial. Not many of them are very good at it but

**babadork** (6): I’m picking up on some nu metal vibes, and I hate nu metal enough for that to be enough to make this my least favorite song on the album.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): There are some slay elements here but the “You crossed the line by multiplying the lies” part…I don’t know…

**prettybirbkotori** (6): so many songs on this album have this larger than life production but with vocal performances that don’t rise to meet them

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I just don't understand. I love the rock-ish songs from SAWAYAMA, why do they all sound so much worse on this album?

**wasian-invasion** (6): this kinda drags

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): the end is good, the beginning gets a bit cluttered

**flava** (5): I don’t really want to hate on it cause the content must’ve been painful to make but this just doesn’t sound good to my ears

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i really want to like this but i don’t (which is the theme for the album)

**reput4tionera** (5): i want to love this album but sometimes i don’t think some songs will grow on me

**jackisboredtoday** (4.2): I was feeling this for one verse and then the pre-chorus killed every bit of this for me

**hikk** (9): This was included in the main rate because it was assumed that it would be a part of some sort of Dirt Femme deluxe or repack, seeing as it uses the same aesthetic as the other singles and got the whole MV treatment. While that supposed release still hasn’t happened, the Sunshine Kitty repack took ages to come out too so there’s still hope! This is a nice song but FN Dua has her fingerprints ALL over it which makes it tough to interpret as a Tove Lo song, it really feels like she’s just singing a reject from that album. At least it’s a pretty decent reject though, probably in line with something like If It Ain’t Me where there’s nothing wrong with the song but most of the actual album tracks do the style far better and in more memorable ways. I still enjoy it as someone that loves FN but I get why it’s going out mid day 2.

**pig-serpent** (8): We haven’t seen Tove Lo in a hot minute, and this song was pretty much always on the bottom of the block of “good Tove Lo songs.”  A much warmer song than I'm used to hearing Tove Lo on, it's a solid jam, and it really stands out from the rest of the album.  I was really expecting this to do better because it has a lot more hit energy to me than some songs that scored higher than it, but I still think it put up a good showing all things considered.

#i'm levitating

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (11): Dua has my heart forever for Borderline.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): it sounds like a amazingly repurposed outtake for Future Nostalgia, and when I saw that Dua Lipa wrote it, I realized that she should've collaborated with her so she'll have a hit.

**Aoquesth378** (10): a great song and I'd love to see some other songs with Dua Lipa as a writer!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the best song on the album is not actually from the album

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way this is better than everything on the actual album

**JIRACHI** (10): this might be generic but i'd eat it up anytime of the day idc

**plastichaxan** (10): This is so catchy and fun and etc I can’t wait for it to be songeniality

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "I cross my heart and hope to die" is just such a fucking great pop hook

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): "cross my heart and hope to die" so TRUE give Marianas Trench your 10s and 11s in 2000s Pop Punk!

**shipperondeck** (10): so cool sounding i wanna dance to this in a club (has never danced in a club) (ignore my sad affair)

**thatplatypus99** (10): why is it that all songs called borderline are so good (Madonna, Ariana, Tame Impala)

**UselessTacooo** (10): wait this isn’t a Dua Lipa song?

**wasian-invasion** (10): this was so goddamn good live im so glad she put this out before my tour date

**kwcty6888** (9.5): can practically hear Dua in this but still slaps

**modulum83** (9.3): why the hell was this left off the album

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Tove Lo’s delivery will always be iconic. Also, I love saying “Tove Lo” such a fun name

**akanewasright** (9): it bops idk

**Frajer** (9): hopefully getting a long lost Dua/Tove collab means we get to hear those songs Charli and Tove wrote together a few years ago someday

**Leixander** (9): would be even better if dua actually featured in this (tho i swear i can hear her in the chorus a lil bit?.. or tove is very great at sounding like her)

**ReallyCreative** (9): yes ma'am

**reput4tionera** (9): serve

**runaway3212** (9): should've been on the album

**shesdoingyoga** (9): You can really hear the Dua in this one

**shhhneak** (9): the shhhneak hates Tove Lo allegations are simply not true!!

**throwaway-7650** (9): wow dua really is all over this chorus

**phonethephoenix** (8.7): i like the die / borderline rhyme

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): The chorus is fun, but it took a while to grow on me

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): oh this is a bop

**alexismateofan** (8): Oh this is giving and serving and working.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): kinda wish Dua had a feature on this? the huskier tone she's using in the chorus makes it sound like Dua's doing backing vocals already (havent checked tho) so why not go for it

**flava** (8): I think I should be in charge of the track-listing of Tove Lo’s albums because in no world should this have not been on Dirt Femme proper

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): fresh grapes

**imbaby122** (8): i’m glad tove lo got a song out of the dua lipa sessions. i cannot imagine dua singing about the taste of blood and crushing bones. she has the face of someone who has never experienced pain.

**queershoulder** (8): love this one and I love the acoustic version that came out recently

**sarcasticsobs** (8): This is more my tempo

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): so random that i had never heard this song before now. it's good

**uberpigeon** (8): right at the where fergie is going to stay when she asks you to meet her halfway. or something. this comment needs workshopping

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i enjoy this a lot however it is literally a dua lipa song

**camerinian** (7.5): ooh the momentum on this track is killer

**DrumBeatGlass** (7.5): Could replacement most of the songs on the album. If she's planning to release more tracks like these, sign me in. And push the pads forward more Tove.

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): this is a bop what more can i say

**TiltControls** (7.5): whens that tame impala rate coming

**DaHumanTorch** (7.3): randomly better than most of the standard

**beeozan** (7): wouldn't this be in the bonus rate 🧐

**CrimsonROSET** (7): is this the actual closing track or deluxe tracks on the end syndrome

**jman457** (7): Ok tame impala

**Nagisoid** (7): El Paso:

**shckskndv** (7): so proud of Tove for getting her Avatar blue pussy out in that junkyard for the music video

**vayyiqra** (7): As someone with BPD I would like a moratorium on songs with this title thank you; Madonna is excepted ♀️

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Oh "bones"... I thought she said "I like to feel my boobs"

#boys will be boys

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): on the borderline of being a good song

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): fine, it sounds like a dua lipa reject because thats what it is.

**Raindrac** (6.5): This is alright, but quite forgettable. Borderline might be better than most of Dirt Femme on the basis of having a good chorus, but that's not enough to save it.

**skeeturz** (6): it's enjoyable but nothing too special to me

**Stryxen** (6): the chorus is a bit wordy but i like it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this is just good ones again

**hikk** (10): OKAAYYYY here we go, after a rough first few tracks this is where the album picks up for me, starting with this absolute slay. This is DRAMA, a really great experimentation with eurodance & trance production and vocal melodies befitting of that dramatic flair. This is honestly too low for this song, I’d personally place it in day 3.

**pig-serpent** (6): I think that sometimes the idea of a Rina song outperforms the actual execution of a Rina song, and this would be my first example of this phenomena.  Rina absolutely nailed the vibe of throwing a dance party in an old cathedral, to the point where I want someone to buy out an old cathedral and turn it into a nightclub (I’m sure it’s been done somewhere) and I really want more songs in this style.   With how much I like the concept for this song, it pains me to say that the song itself is just okay.  I really wish this song connected with me more than it does. 

 This song hovered in the low 20s but started to slip down at the end.  I think I would’ve liked if it kept around 21 or so but sliding down to 25 isn’t that big of a deal.

#blessed

**flava** (11): It was the only song I saved from this album when I first heard it, it was captivating, magical, and beautiful. It felt like every swell swept up into something grandiose that can only be played on the biggest stages of the world (yes I am still bitter about I Wrote a Song getting picked over this. banish this island into the sea). And yeah my gay little heart feels particularly felt, she sings it with such perseverance and confidence it is hard not to get a little inspired.

**throwaway-7650** (11): the outro giving snakeskin...! 2 career highlights!

**UselessTacooo** (11): this is literally one of the best songs I’ve ever heard. The cold wet rave vibe was so well executed. Chills.

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): The Holy-Your Age-Imagining triptych is unbeatable.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): not gonna lie, this is low key the best song in the entire rate

**akanewasright** (10): I didn’t get this song until I envisioned it being the Eurovision pick for the UK… and like… that would’ve been literally fucking incredible

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is soooo great, fuck those homophobic religion leaders forcing us to be straight when it's old-fashionably fatal for f-words like us.

**Ambrosia42** (10): FOUND MY PEACE WHEN I LOST MY RELIGION!!!! This song is very real, and the production is fantastic

**Aoquesth378** (10): This is like Hold The Girl but it goes harder, which is what I wanted so no complaints.

**apatel27** (10): Big Mood in Losing Faith

**DirtyRat583** (10): WHOA i love 90s trance.............

**DrumBeatGlass** (10): this song is so dark and I love this. She gave us the fabulous synths, the great vocal performance, a perfect composition. And the lyrics, girl...

**impla77** (10): The first time I heard this was when I was playing KH2- first visit to Hollow Bastion, so now all I can think about is fighting off Nobodies (or was it heartless?) from the gate with my bae Leon. Anyway, world ending bop here <3

**JIRACHI** (10): SAWAYAMA's crown tipped a little bit when this was released idk

**jman457** (10): This felt like a religious expierence

**oscarbrierley1** (10): yas religious trauma haunted cathedral eurodance bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): I swear some parts of this sound like the BBC News theme

**reput4tionera** (10): need to throw a rave in a church just so i can play this

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Ah, here's where the good stretch is. Pains me to know that the first track I don't enjoy Clarence Clarity had nothing to do with. Anyway, production wild.

**saviorARMY101** (10): BANGERRR

**shesdoingyoga** (10): “I wanted it to sound like a cold wet rave in a converted church, with dripping pipes and wet stone walls” well you definitely achieved that

**shhhneak** (10): Sasuke Uchiha x Itachi Uchiha AMV soundtrack.

**shipperondeck** (10): ALRIGHT SO. LISTEN TO THIS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1ExnZRdL8o AND TELL ME THESE DON'T SOUND SIMILAR. in a good way. theyre both bangers

**skeeturz** (10): and this starts the holy quadruple of this album, this is a very powerful song

**Stryxen** (10): the instrumental is so perfectly intensely emotional and her vocals sound amazing - and the lyrics !! what a highlight

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): genuinely this is an out of body ethereal experience and if you dont feel that then like…sorry that you don’t have ears or feelings

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Wanda Maximoff coded

**xxipil0ts** (10): my mom didn't want me to study in a catholic school before and now i know why.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I love how thematically this is the opposite of Unholy, mostly in how it's actually a good song

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): me pretending to be catholic in religious education class to graduate high school

**1998tweety** (9): she slayed this

**camerinian** (9): I love the swinging for such a mammoth sound, like Rina’s trying to fill the most decadent, sweaty warehouse party and lead a sermon about her religious trauma at the same time. Do those two things go together? Not really, but points for the audacity

**Frajer** (9): every generation gets its It's A Sin by Pet Shop Boys

**ktajlili** (9): this is the best song on the album IMO. It's so unique sounding and I love the lyrics. "I took your stones and built a cathedral" is lyrical genius

**Nagisoid** (9): She's so queen for following the vibe by making the song sound like it was recorded in a Victorian church

**nick1372** (9): she didn't lie it is giving oonts oonts. why wasn't this a single?

**phonethephoenix** (9): she's right!

**vayyiqra** (9): adding this to my playlist "songs with Catholic vibes" (this isn't a bit this is a real playlist I have) 🫂

**welcome2thejam** (9): Alright, I'm down with the church rave song

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): [SCREAMS IN CULTURALLY CATHOLIC UPBRINGING]

**seanderlust** (8.5): Real formerly religious queer girl shit…AH 👅

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): does that mean she then becomes UNHOLY?

**beeozan** (8): euphoric chorus in a very rhythm gamey way

**bogo** (8): go off rina

**dreamingpastel** (8): Why can I see the DDR beatmap so clearly? Actually, no. I should be asking why this is the perfect song for a Nightcore version.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): kinda grew off me a little bit

**imbaby122** (8): religious trauma sounds so bad i’m so sorry guys

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8): religious trauma but make it bang

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Great chorus but the verses take too long to build to it

**scythersboots** (7.2): its giving the weeknd

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): “i took your stones and built a cathedral” is just “i can build a castle from all the bricks they threw at me” in a different font

**alexismateofan** (7): one of a few times for me where a score will tank due to spoken word but if it’s going to have spoken word, I like it like… in the middle of the song rather than right at the end where they’re trying to hide it.

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (7): went platinum in the gay club

**ignitethephoenix** (7): her enunciation/vocals on here sound weird

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's fine I just wish it sounded… better

**ricki** (6.9): this is so european

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): carried by cool production

**bigbigbee** (6): this would have been the hottest DDR track in 2005

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I don’t even love this song that much and I still wanted to see it on Eurovision.

**kappyko** (6): Holy Til You Kappyko

**Raindrac** (6): I've complained a lot about the mixing on Hold The Girl in my comments, but yeeeeeeeeeesh. It's atrocious on Holy (Til You Let Me Go). There's so much noise in the chorus that it's like the auditory equivalent of being blinded by light, far too overblown. And in contrast, the verses are so quiet that I've got to turn up my volume just for it to sound on par with the rest of the album. What happened here? It's a shame, because the lyrics are great and I can relate to the sentiment of being demonized and losing my religion. This had potential.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): sounds just a bit uninspired compared to the rest of the album, and does not quite beat the diet born this way allegations

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): REM reference

**shckskndv** (5): I have absolutely no idea what Holy Till You Let Me Go means as a phrase, but the beat is beating.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): it's just a bad eurovision song

**moonshxne** (4.1): the compression clashes really poorly with the trance-like synths. the instrumentation in the chorus honestly sounds so flaccid

**Awkward\_King** (3): i support eurotrash idk why this has grown off of me

**Leixander** (3): literally forgot about this seconds after i listened to it

**IIIHenryIII** (1): it sure sounds like what she intended too but that doesn’t mean it was a good idea

**buddhacharm** (0): This song traumatized me live. Worst concert experience ever: sweaty, sticky, hot as fuck (I was getting heat rashes???), claustrophobic, weird millennial moaning behind me and whipping their hair in my face that somehow got stuck in my mask, could barely see, enclosed by white circuit muscle gays, and it literally blew my eardrums out like I feel it literally damaged my hearing. I HATE this song, it literally couldn't be associated with worse imagery for me 💀 that being said Rina chewed!

**hikk** (9): I really thought this would be a bit more controversial here but thankfully it ends up not performing too terribly, #24 is nothing to scoff at for something that I think a lot of people would assume would be more of a target for hatred. This is Carly at her campiest and for me it works very well. Although the male vocals were offputting at first, they add to the song's fun. Not the best on the album for me but a very good time.

**pig-serpent** (9): I’ve been back and forth on this song a bit.  That male vocalist is atrocious and I’ve listened to it enough that the basicness of the pop formula is making the song grow a little stale.  But that is because I’ve been continuously listening to it for the past month because I love everything else about the song.  Predictably a lot of people hate fun or something, but I don’t think this song ended up being as controversial as a lot of people expected, probably because most popheads like fun (if I had to guess.)  That being said, I’d gladly put this in my personal top 10.

#LOOKING CAMP RIGHT IN THE EYE

**AHSWeeknd** (10): which voice is Jack Antonoff’s

**akanewasright** (10): BOOOYS AROUND THE WORLD

**Aoquesth378** (10): Okay listen the song is a bop and I never understood the hate I saw for it. Such a bop and it's FUN. Not every song needs to be so serious and you can tell it's a song she enjoyed making.

**apatel27** (10): This is gonna get tanked for dumb reasons and it's gonna hurt

**Awkward\_King** (10): they could never make me hate you <3

**beeozan** (10): (lets hope im not the only one plagiarising here) an abstract instrumental journey of mind-bending musicianship and rich expressiveness via avante garde film-score soundscapes, featuring flashes of stylistic innovation and ensemble work that is staggeringly packed full of drama yet still meaningful from a compositional standpoint.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’m happy to say that I’m now one of the girls who get it!

**cocosairdep** (10): some of y’all hate fun istg

**babadork** (9.5): I am probably overrating this, but I think I would regret rating it lower when I’m singing along during the rate reveal.

**camerinian** (9.5): wait isn’t this just the plot of Preacher’s Daughter

**imbaby122** (9.5): idgaf if this sounds like a sketch song by the lonely island, it’s legitimately a masterpiece.

**wasian-invasion** (9.2): if this doesnt win most controversial i'll go get my organs harvested by a sketchy grindr hookup

**throwaway-7650** (9.1): put me in the camp section

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (9): I love this song but why is it on this album.

**flava** (9): “I’m probably gonna hurt your feelings” me to everyone when they see my score for TLT title track

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): anyone who dislikes this hates fun!!

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): common tinder experience

**impla77** (9): Men are trash wbk

**ReallyCreative** (9): Once Twice Organ Harvesting

**shesdoingyoga** (9): She looked camp right in the eye

**skeeturz** (9): i love how campy and tongue-in-cheek it is i live for it

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Carly why are you going after literally the most fruitiest-sounding men?

**Ambrosia42** (8.6): it’s kinda weird but kinda camp and good

**1998tweety** (8.5): it was camp

**jasannn** (8.5): more like beach camp

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): ok i know this song is gonna catch heat but it’s FUN okay

**jman457** (8.1): This sounds dated in the best way possible

**Raindrac** (8.1): Beach House is REALLY charming. THIS is why I love listening to Carly Rae Jepsen. Packed full of energy with humorous lines, it's a lot of fun, and it quickly captures my attention whenever I play it. There aren't many pop stars that would release a song like this, but Carly knows not to take herself too seriously, and that's why I love her.

**bigbigbee** (8): this song isn’t NOT like Catallena

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this grew on me sooo much, super fun bop now

**Leixander** (8): a grower for sure

**memezaharamole** (8): what can I say, I just love to have fun

**Nagisoid** (8): Dream Pop Classics is shaking

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Why did this get hate when it first came out? It's cute. Oh yeah, I forgot, the dudes. That makes sense I guess

**TiltControls** (8): it's grown on me for sure. though mostly cause of the great mv

**welcome2thejam** (8): "I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings" - Raters on their Beach House scores at Indieheads Ultimate

hikkaru: **ignitethephoenix** (7.8): would be better with less men

**queershoulder** (7.8): I don't hate it

**luckyphase** (7.7): it's kinda fun but i don't want to listen to it

**bogo** (7.5): me when someone asks me what artist in indieheads 2022 ultimate deserved way better:

**DrumBeatGlass** (7.5): Wasn't into this track at first. But now I just want to find myself on the beach listening to this song. Carly, just add one more minute. The guitars are so addictive.

**modulum83** (7.5): justice for beach house in the 2022 indieheads ult rate iykyk

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): I gradually warmed up to this song but it does feel incomplete near the end.

**alexismateofan** (7): out of the first two songs that came out, this is probably my least favorite of them. I mean it’s serving but man is it weird. Why are we talking about harvesting organs?????

**moonshxne** (7): you know what? i'm glad that this song, in all of its "snl digital short" glory, is in *this* album. its placement is a bit jarring and i have no idea where i'd place this otherwise, but this truly needed to be here

**nick1372** (7): Extra points for being a ton of fun to sing along to live. It feels like it's too tied down to the pop song structure, I wish it was a little looser so it could be weirder and campier.

**phonethephoenix** (7): it's fun!! def had to grow on me at first but it's a fun listen

**reput4tionera** (7): it’s camp but it’s too camp yk

**saviorARMY101** (7): this is camp

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): i love when she's goofy. can't take her anywhere

**xxipil0ts** (7): i mean, if i rizzed my way into carly, i too would need $10000


#organs harvested

**AmandaYoung2083** (6.5): I have a love hate relationship with this song, like I hated the lyrics but it was a Carly single so I was also obsessed and had it on repeat

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (6.5): looking camp right in the eye

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (6.4): if those men don’t all go put themselves down for a nap already

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): it's kinda fun ig and the hook is pretty solid but idk the funny bits are still just a bit annoying

**bloodjet** (5): well i no longer hate this song, but i still think it's not that good. it's a fun song that i wouldn't mind, feels like the song works best with the video

**ktajlili** (5): okay its not terrible. its kind of fun and camp but I think it suffers from the same problem as "You Need to Calm Down" I think it's trying to hard and I don't think Carley is in her element trying to write a fun song, but since it fits the theme I guess its okay

**oscarbrierley1** (5): camp to the point of annoyance.

**scythersboots** (5): i can’t decide if this song is too camp

**shckskndv** (5): kind of funny. Unfortunate that Carly betrays Popheads repeatedly by including male vocals. I am against men’s right to release pop music.

**vayyiqra** (4): I like this but not the organs line! It is very weird and offputting! Which is the point but idk I don't like this song much or find it super funny or anything it's okay though 🍐

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): this is just a C Tier Teen Beach Movie song. This is the most cutting insult I could think of for this childrens YouTube video ass song.

**shhhneak** (1): I'm glad this was kinda fun when I saw Carly live because it may have saved itself from a zero.

**notarobot3675** (0): im sorry i am a beach house hater :/

**slimboyfriend** (0): people need to stop calling things camp when they’re just bad

**hikk** (10): This is such proof that Rina is amazing at making off the walls bangers like this. The energy here is crazy and this is a great blend of the 2-step motif of some of this album’s tracks with some more experimental hyperpop stylings. It comes in the pussy part of the album and is definitely a highlight, which has me upset that it didn’t make day 3 nor even an 8+ average. and it was SO close like omfg. More like this next album please!!

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This song was holding in the top 10 for a good chunk of time, and gradually fell down into the low 20s before turning it around just a little bit.  I wasn’t expecting this song to be that big of a favorite, but I think the song sounds pretty cool and has a nice hardcore edge to it, like it’s a better Your Age, and I was rooting for it to have a good finish for Rina, because uh, she’s starting to run out of songs.

---

#do the hyperpop rate on indieheads if it's still open i don't know actually

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (11): I love how the best songs in this album are Rina taking her past traumas and just making absolute bangers out of them, and this is the best example. This song makes me want to scream and jump around and throw shit

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): The production on this is so good imagine not singing along.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Rina will always ensure her production is miles ahead of her peers

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): bruh, this song gets me more than my psychiatrist will ever try.

**Ambrosia42** (10): The energy of the song and the vocal manipulation really drive home the vibe of absolutely losing your shit

**apatel27** (10): Big Mood in Self Doubt

**Awkward\_King** (10): rina is at her best when she's doing stupid off the wall 2000s british club glitchpop and screaming tbh

**beeozan** (10): maybe I might be convinced to hold the girl

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We have now entered the clit stretch of the album.

**bloodjet** (10): love how chaotic this sounds

**camerinian** (10): the most feral fucking banger of a hook this whole rate has in store.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): desperately need the digital hardcore album from rina

**Frajer** (10): hyperpop Rina

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): the middle part of the album being the most yass and slay is so weird

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Can’t believe Rina dropped a bunch of “dad rock” songs as singles when she had songs waiting like this in the wings

**JIRACHI** (10): you have to shout out the words to this to properly get the song i'm saying

**kwcty6888** (10): a transcendent experience

**oscarbrierley1** (10): the chorus reminds me of azealia banks singing into a megaphone at cochella that one year.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): imagining a world where charli xcx actually had 21 rate wins

**reput4tionera** (10): im #living

**runaway3212** (10): when the post-chorus hits like my god

**sarcasticsobs** (10): 2-stepping in my room rn as I ignore the "Mercury's in retrograde" line

**skeeturz** (10): this song is also very raw and goes very hard, it's very reminiscent of a grimes song before i started hating grimes

**Stryxen** (10): the spotify extra info for this makes me giggle it just says This is a song about gaslighting. but has a picture of her serving face in a cunty outfit in the background

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): me when the results come in and rina is losing

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): she sank to the bottom of Mother Lake and returned 3 days later prepared to slay

**UselessTacooo** (10): she has lost her mind

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hell yes, this feels like a fantastic follow-up to the rock-infused tracks I loved off SAWAYAMA

**imbaby122** (9.5): what a sonic disaster omg i love it sm

**nick1372** (9.5): Do y'all remember in 2020 when everyone was calling Rina a hyperpop artist? Crazy because this is the first song I've heard from her that is actual hyperpop and it makes me want to live in the word where Rina does exclusively hyperpop

**sharts-n-farts** (9.5): The autotune took me by surprise but once I got into it this song really hooked me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): tbh i love that she explores so may emotional facets of uncovering and recovering from trauma like yes girl get mad!

**seanderlust** (9): I'M!! IMAGINING!! SO TELL ME https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSYiyg8LGzY

**shckskndv** (9): I really love the part in this track where the chorus’ vocal effects drop out. A dance freak-out.

**Aoquesth378** (8): I really wanted to give it a ten but I don't like the vocals until the last chorus. I do like the idea of like, breaking free and her discovering herself so even if it isn't my cup of tea I still like it.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): what the fuck IS happening

**ktajlili** (8): yeah this is my second favorite. A true bop.

**Nagisoid** (8): John Lennon actually was shot after a stan became an anti thanks to this song outselling his flop copy ☕

**phonethephoenix** (8): I don't know if this deserves this score but I like it too much to score it lower

**vayyiqra** (8): hyperpop?! 🫂

**impla77** (7.9): probably one of the more standard songs on the album

**moonshxne** (7.8): for once, the wall of blown-out sound actually works really well to accentuate the screaming, disorienting atmosphere of the track

**jman457** (7.3): Why did i keep thinking it was switching to the Charli album on accident

hikkaru: # my fave charli albums are sucker and crash

**prettybirbkotori** (7): this one is fun but i do not like the lyrics

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): she wants that spotify hyperpop playlist promo soooooo bad

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): i wish the vocal affect had been used less liberally, the best part of the song is when she sings the chorus without it

**uberpigeon** (7): imagine how tired we are of it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Thank God for these Spotify storyline clips cause I has NO idea this was about gaslighting or whatever

**wasian-invasion** (7): if only gal gadot and those other celebrities saved us from the pandemic with this song

**shhhneak** (6.6): "what the fuck is up? what's happening?" is me listening to this album for the first time.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): the chorus ATE and then the verses took a couple bites and sent it back to the waiter

**DrumBeatGlass** (5.2): Would live without it. Sounds like something that Grimes could release... as a b-side. This song doesn't click until the long outro. And lyrics are not the best

**IIIHenryIII** (5): dragons?

**kappyko** (5): Imagine Dragon These Nu

**Leixander** (5): just as i thought it was going to be a good song it got ruined somewhat by bad vocal/production choices

**Raindrac** (5): Huh, I'm surprised by how different her vocals sound here. It's a neat effect. Not the greatest, but a fun song.

**ReallyCreative** (5): well

**ignitethephoenix** (4): this song is such a mess

**thedoctordances1940** (3.5): The vocal production on this song is so bad in so many ways, the compression on the chorus sounds like garbage, the autotune effect in parts does not work at all, the only saving grace is that the song does have some pretty interesting production in parts

**bigbigbee** (3): me in the car in 2003 thinking about what I’d do if I suddenly had 1 million neopoints :3

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): yeah this could be cut

**alexismateofan** (0): this is where i took a deep breath out of my nose and really hoped that things would get better in my life

**hikk** (9): This song is so relevant to me right now it’s insane. I do think that Carly’s version of this topic on Talking To Yourself edges this out but I still like this a lot. The lyrics alongside Charli’s delivery of them ooze bitterness that is oh so satisfying to hear when I allow myself to be conceited and fill the role of the bad girl in question. “Do you even know the reasons why you had to let me go?” like ugh okay!!

**pig-serpent** (7): A good song but I've never really understood its apparent status as a fan favorite.  Apparently it’s not as much of a fan favorite as I thought it was, but this is still a solid placement.

---

#love you like a love song

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I may relate

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she really should make more Ava Max music cause this sort of stuff is amazing

**akanewasright** (10): I made fun of this song for not living up to the title when it came out, and somehow it became my most played song of the year LMFAO

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I always had this song on constant repeat, yass.

**Ambrosia42** (10): an addictive bop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Self explanatory.

**camerinian** (10): ugh the way they use those scales in the melodies to drill in the repeating tension on this track is so good, and to just never give it quite enough release even with an all time Charli hook backing it up. This is such a mammoth track and I didn’t even really appreciate its brilliance until this rate.

**cocosairdep** (10): she collapsed the whole maternity wing with this one

**cremeebrulee** (10): she's right i am cute and i am rude with kinda rare attitude

**shipperondeck** (10): i remember her performing this live and this song just clicked for me. I Understood The Vision

**thatplatypus99** (10): me looking at my CRASH scrobbles in 2022

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): probably my favorite song this era, it's just so cunty

**UselessTacooo** (10): i don’t know what’s happening but I am living

**wasian-invasion** (10): the real grower on the album! didn't really leave a mark first few listens but it kept getting constantly and repeatedly stuck in my head and now i love it

**Aoquesth378** (9): very interesting song, I'm addicted to the beat and repetition, and I like how it matches the title and flows together.

**bogo** (9): me listening to this song

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): im cute nd im rude and u like what i do!

**ktajlili** (9): yeah this is great

**modulum83** (8.7): shawty like a melody inside my head that i cant keep out got me singing like nananana every day its like my ipod stuck on replay

**1998tweety** (8.5): the "repeat" line in the bridge is doing something

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): Pretty pleasant perhaps

**bloodjet** (8): idk why this song is so great. is it because charli sells the bad girl persona so well? but slay anyway queen!

**DrumBeatGlass** (8): Synths are gorgeous, lyrics better than in the previous track. "Got me on repeat" is sung in a fantastic way, really elevates the song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): was about to make a this song won’t be on constant repeat joke but it’s actually good

**imbaby122** (8): the intro of this song kind of has a roblox music vibe to me

**prettybirbkotori** (8): true lyricism is ‘got me on repeat (x16)’

**shckskndv** (8): the magic in Charli is the same magic that produced Better Off Alone by Alice Deejay. Those songs have matching energy.

**skeeturz** (8): much like the title this song was also on constant repeat, just too too good

**welcome2thejam** (8): Kinda hitting the same themes as Talking To Yourself. Don't know if she really 100% nails that bad girl image tbh

#skipped

**nick1372** (7.5): I do not, in fact, have you on re pee Charli

**alexismateofan** (7): but only because no i do not want the end on repeat plz????

**CrimsonROSET** (7): could have had a BAD BITCH

**vayyiqra** (7): Cool title! Wish I liked it enough to put it on repeat ahah (chuckles). 🚘

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is like spacey video game music

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): unfortunately i only put this on partial repeat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this sounds like a song the spoiled rich mean girl bully would sing in a high school movie after her boyfriend breaks up with her

**impla77** (6.2): Talking To Yourself outsold, unfortunately

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): subliminally trying to get people to replay this song… it’s not working though

**oscarbrierley1** (6): it sounds like how she dances

**TiltControls** (6): well I don't know what that's like

**thedoctordances1940** (4.8): some good parts to it but also some really not good parts. thanks for coming to my ted talk

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (4): Let's just say I won't have this one on constant repeat.

**beeozan** (4): more like constant skip

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): i think this song would be better if someone who could sing recorded it

**Raindrac** (3): I can't wait to see how many people are going to make a snarky comment about the song title, positive or negative. But that aside, Constant Repeat gets off to a promising start in the first verse because of the great production but then falls off once it reaches the chorus, never quite recovering. Another song that could've been better if it were longer and had a better hook.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): constant repeat is a torture method so it fits the song I guess

**Stryxen** (1): it could be amazing, i love the melodies, but its completely ruined with cheap and messy production . and the yodeling outro is so so so bad

**hikk** (9): This wasn't a huge standout on my initial listens but it grew as I heard it more and now it's definitely one of the better songs. It's a really sweet yet sad look at loss and the emotions surrounding that are conveyed greatly through the production and especially Carly's delivery. I know it gets a bit repetitive with how she does the lyric filler with "do do do do do do" like she does on a few other songs on this album but I think it works here - it's hard to explain but something about it just sends the emotion home even harder. Happy to see it end up with an average over 8.0.

**pig-serpent** (6.9): The production is fantastic and feels like the ocean gently lapping at your feet.  A great chill out song, but it's missing that extra mile that would really pull that score up for me.  All things considered, I think this is a good spot for this song to go out.

---

#i can feel the sun on you...

**prettybirbkotori** (11): this is her best song point blank. it makes me want to sob but it’s also just soooooo beautiful. in a just world it wins the rate but we do not live in a just world

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She said “let me take you to another plane of existence”

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): the sadness and grief here really hurts to feel.

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (10): yeah…

**apatel27** (10): Radiohead could never

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Everyone who gives this a low score…just know that I WILL be taking it extremely personally.

**bloodjet** (10): love how tender this song feels. also love the songwriting in this!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): loooove when she does more vibey tracks her voice sounds so urethral on the production

**CrimsonROSET** (10): why am I crying like

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): sometimes the silliest pop album can make you sob like a bitch

**kappyko** (10): Radiohead

**Leixander** (10): queen of e•mo•tions truly

**Nagisoid** (10): We stan Carly's Ribs moment

**nick1372** (10): God this song is so gorgeous

**notarobot3675** (10): might be song of the album idk!!!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): still have no idea why it’s titled bends if that word isn’t even in the song

**queershoulder** (10): I likes side A more than side b, except for The Loneliest Time!

**ReallyCreative** (10): as someone who is currently watching the slow death of a grandparent, this song absolutely annihilates me. This is a deeply personal track, the kind we don't usually see from Carly, but it's her most breathtakingly gorgeous ballad. I really hope it doesn't get done dirty

**Stryxen** (10): carly

**throwaway-7650** (10): realizing that this is just western wind [10] but a bit more uptempo

**TiltControls** (10): hikk can i please have a 2nd 11 for this song as your jukebox cohostie

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): a strong contender for my favorite carly song ever, tbh. i love when pop artists talk about loss and grief, there's something very raw about it. the line "how can this be life?" stabs me in the heart every time. i lub dis song <3

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I don’t know what this song means but it’s like a warm blankie :)

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): doo dooo dododododddoooodoo

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): bends my sweet baby mewmew

**modulum83** (9.3): recalls the early glitch of oval’s seminal early 90s experimental piece “do while” and the ambient techno of basic channel…ugh her mind

**akanewasright** (9): doo doo… doo doo doo doo doodoo… :(

**buddhacharm** (9): "blue eyes we are the sensitive ones" okay Aryan pride....

**DrumBeatGlass** (9): She treated us with another airy synths (like in Far Away), but this time it's even better! The lyrical content is honestly so heartbreaking, can't believe she wrote tje chorus in her before-Kiss times

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this, more than any other song, is giving cult

**runaway3212** (9): this song is so good but I will never forgive it for making me forget its name and I sung "dudu dududu" to all my friends cause I was going crazy but of course nobody knew the fucking song cause carly's a fucking flop

**welcome2thejam** (9): Writing "Oh hey, this is really capturing such a dreary and moody yet enticing vibe. I like it" while eating a string cheese stick in my kitchen at 2pm

**jman457** (8.7): Cool ambient dance track

**shipperondeck** (8.6): <3

**imbaby122** (8.5): i was gonna say that i kind of hate the “doo’s” in lieu of lyrics, but thematically it works really well. like if i was a depressed songwriter i definitely wouldn’t have the motivation to write actual lyrics.

**jasannn** (8.5): This song feels like I am taking an introspective walk at sunset

**seanderlust** (8.5): if they made a gay adaptation of the movie drive this would be on the OST no i will not explain

**impla77** (8.2): I don’t really connect to this the way some do, but its still beautiful

**alexismateofan** (8): this really feels like a sunset song like i would be on the beach playing this out of my stereo as the sun goes down and i’m the only one not kissing someone (this is not from experience i do not visit the beach)

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): My knee jerk reaction was to call this boring but then I kept listening and I kinda get it now, it’s so hypnotic.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): william orbit all saints y2k sounding song.

**shckskndv** (8): the inspiration behind this track is heartbreaking and very Covid unique. Lovely.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i just know her favorite radiohead song is high and dry

**Ambrosia42** (7.8): not really a standout, but it fits nicely in the album and it’s lovely

**bogo** (7.5): do ee er or whatever idk

**camerinian** (7.5): there’s something here in the slight atonality in the synth pad backdrop and the uneasy emotional conflict in the lyrics, I just wish the composition supported it better

**Raindrac** (7.5): Bends was unremarkable on my first listen, but something drew me back to this song when I went to comment on how the "do do, do-do-do-do-do-do" sounded like a lame way to extend the lyrics to fit the melody. And yeah, that's still true, but I know exactly what drew me back to the song now. It's the beat. Nocturnal and slightly futuristic, the slow-to-rapid pace of that beat is addictive. I can't go without mentioning how sweet Carly's vocals sound, either. Soft as a pillow, they're perfect for a nocturnal song like this.

**ricki** (7.5): she's so 00s-adult-contemporary-coded

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): It grew on me! Nice to see a new side of Carly.

**dreamingpastel** (7): Nice, easygoing, but doesn't really do much for me.

**frogaranaman** (7): great Radiohead album

**luckyphase** (7): bedtime playlist 🧖‍♀️

**phonethephoenix** (7): possibly a bit too chill? it's nice though

**skeeturz** (7): it's very cute! not one i'd go out of my way to relisten to specifically, but if it comes on during shuffle/album relisten i won't dread it

**slimboyfriend** (7): bends? Doodoo? Doodoo Doodoo???

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): idk, didn't hit

**JIRACHI** (6.5): it's okay i guess

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): this song is too personal to be mean to

**Aoquesth378** (6): A boring song that I don't think leads anywhere, but I like how it feels like the sister to Western Wind

**ktajlili** (6): i think it's kind of nice and chill but also very forgettable

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): me when i'm scuba diving and i swim too deep

**thedoctordances1940** (6): I feel like I should really love this but idk I'm just a little bored

**vayyiqra** (6): This song surely does exist! (It's filler) 🍐

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): first she says i was born in vegas now she says im bent

**beeozan** (5): if this song had 1 or 2 more minutes with more build-up it would be the best song in the album truly but as it is, it’s mostly boring :(

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): did she just rhyme “sensitive” with “sensitive”?

**hikk** (8): I feel like there are other tracks on the album that I would have preferred to see get an MV post-release (YUCK) but this song is pretty nice. It feels like it’s definitely one of the more Ava Max coded songs, in how it uses a well known sample of an older dance song as its base and has that house sound, but it’s a fairly good execution of that style. This is a fine placement for it imo, I would not have wanted this in day 3.

**pig-serpent** (6): Charli writing a song over one of the two "insert 90s dance music here" samples sounds good because of course it does, and I love the “Held me back, tied me up inside a cage” line  but I'd be lying if I didn't call this blatant filler.  I’m actually pretty amazed at how high this one placed, I never expected this to have a shot at day 3 during the current wave of sample backlash, especially with Beyonce using the same sample around the same time.

---

#you won't break my soul

**AHSWeeknd** (11): Sounds like she’s escaping a cult

**thatplatypus99** (11): I’m sorry but this song is saur good

**1998tweety** (10): ended Beyonce

**akanewasright** (10): This sample is overused but idk it said gay rights so I’ll allow it most of the time

**Aoquesth378** (10): Spectacular song, I read that some people didn't like the sample/that it was lazy and I agree it isn't the most creative I've heard, I'm still in love with the song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): somehow only the second best sample of show me love by robin s that came out by a popheads favourite in 2022

**DirtyRat583** (10): awesome sample use

**frogaranaman** (10): David Guetta would go nuuuuuuts over this

**kappyko** (10): i have spent an embarrassing amount of time strutting around my apartment pretending this song is about a person im mad at right now to pretend this isnt good. Sorry redacted but im so charli and ur so atlantic records yes this is the same person in my So Nice comment IDGAF

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): it's a ru-girl song but with budget

**nick1372** (10): outsold beyonce unfortunately.

**phonethephoenix** (10): this song took me a minute but it definitely became one of my favorite songs on the album.

**reput4tionera** (10): if dylan brady cowrote this why doesn’t it have a snare that sounds like a toolbox falling down the stairs

**sarcasticsobs** (10): This sample is overdone *gasp* I never said that. This sample is my friend

**seanderlust** (10): BANGER. arguably the best use of this sample

**shhhneak** (10): Lala Ri walk-out music.

**Stryxen** (10): randomly one of her best songs idc that it sounds like an unfinished and messy demo. I’m an unfinished and messy gay man

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): an anthem

**throwaway-7650** (10): I love enhypen - go big or go home

**UselessTacooo** (10): this is such a trashy bop and I’m in love

**wasian-invasion** (10): god i love her backup dancers

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): bop that could be about a boy or her record label or both or neither

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): i feel so unstable fucking hate my label

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): it lost the sample battle but it's still cute idk

**hakkerj** (9.5): u won’t break my soul

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): so catchy it’s almost yuck

**imbaby122** (9.5): when that fake beyoncé quote about her being inspired by charli xcx went around my friend reposted it unironically. i had to explain some things to her (robin s., gay fanbases, etc.)

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): what Gotye and Kimbra were singing about or whatever

**shipperondeck** (9.1): the mv SLAYS btw im afraid that's helping bump up my score

**camerinian** (9): you’d think we’d be sick of the Show Me Love sample by now. Hmm.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): her ava max-coded yass and slay omg…

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): the title is actually in reference to robin s knowing charli for 2 months before break my soul dropped

**vayyiqra** (9): Using this sample is cheating basically but I can't help how much I love this sample okay if Slayyyter can do it so can Charli 🚘

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): She kinda did this sample better than B—

**welcome2thejam** (9): I mean the sample went from club banger to also club banger, idk what else you could want

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): that sample showed me not love, but camp in the best way possible, especially with the music video.

**alexismateofan** (8): This song visited the Lala land machine.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The superior lazy interpolation of the album.

**dreamingpastel** (8): Ava Max pop (positive connotation)

**Leixander** (8): an ode to germany???

**Nagisoid** (8): I've heard this in a Taco Bell (affectionate)

**prettybirbkotori** (8): FUCK ATLANTIC

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Which comment describes this song best? A. Love Island-core; B. Ministry of Sound compilation CD-core; C. H&M-core; or D. All of the above. If you selected D, you're god damn right.

**skeeturz** (8): a fantastic song, it's catchy and very infectious

**uberpigeon** (8): this is the best interpolation one

**bloodjet** (7.8): the mv made me realize how fun this song is

**scythersboots** (7.8): v dance dance revolution, interpolation feels much fresher here than in other tracks somehow

**JIRACHI** (7.5): this is a gay song for straight people i don't know how to explain it but it very much is

**ktajlili** (7.5): I like the sample even if it's overused. This is a fun send off for her old record label

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): This one is a banger actually.

**runaway3212** (7): this is fun idc

#does anyone think record labels abusing their control is a good thing?

**shckskndv** (7): SO SO sad for Charli that this came out the same year as Break My Soul.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): out of the lazy samples on this album this is the least interesting. like yes it still bops but again she couldve done more

**ricki** (6.8): enhypen ended her

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): i thought i liked this more than i did hearing a bit of it once in a public last summer but then i never went to listen to it outside of that to see if I did actually like it and actually the answer is not as much as I thought. Still a highlight on the album though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): gotye:

**CrimsonROSET** (6): who is she! drag her! slay her!

**DrumBeatGlass** (5.5): Beyonce thought she ate that one. If you ignore the lyrics, this song is enjoyable, but not memorable enough. I know you can do longer songs and better short songs

**jman457** (5.5): Idk this felt like a lazy sample

**apatel27** (5): One of the worst uses of Show Me Love

**beeozan** (5): was okay for the 3 months break my soul didn’t exist

**bogo** (5): see this song is where i find the sampling a bit too obvious and overbearing, especially since i don’t think the song is strong enough on its own

**bookthieving** (5): how is this not the song with a proposed ava max feature

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): begging the pop music industry to find a different house song

**modulum83** (5): music for a boiler room set in the most gentrified gay club you’ve ever been to

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): controversial but i just don't like this that much, it's fun, i like the beat... but i much prefer break my soul's use of the sample

**moonshxne** (4): for the longest time this was gonna be my 0, but something clicked. charli really knows how to elevate a song with just her brash presence

**Raindrac** (3): Oh, I recognize that sample! It's the same sample of Show Me Love that was used in dozens of other house-inspired pop songs... except not as good as any of them! Next.

**hikk** (10): Even though this was a joint effort that ended up on both this album as well as SG Lewis’ from this year, it feels like the heart of Dirt Femme. Bright, chunky synths back catchy melodies and heartfelt vocals to make one of the biggest bops of this rate and one that DESERVED BETTER! I thought this had a really good chance at being top 10, perhaps on of Tove’s highest songs, but instead it finds itself missing day 3 entirely and barely making the top 20. It’s such a shame because this was one of my favourite songs from last year.

**pig-serpent** (6): The turning point where the album slides down to just okay for me.  It's apparent how much this album was being carried by Tove's hooks and not by the production. Her melody is still fine, but it’s a step down from every song preceding it and the instrumental is extremely bland 

 Or well, I guess that’s just me.  This song was hanging out in the top 10 for a while and had the potential to end up as Tove Lo’s highest scoring song until it just failed to keep up with the competition as a result of some Tove Lo tankers.  And I have to say, they were doing us a service at least as far as this song is concerned.

#I'D DIE FOR YOU BABY

**akanewasright** (11): LIFE CHANGING EXPERIENCE

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): literally mother and father… this is a match made from heaven - i need a collab album stats!

**frogaranaman** (11): when this song came out, I was jamming out to it so hard on the train that someone asked me what I was listening to. I showed them and they then told me that this song reminded them of DDR music 

 another important detail is that they were one of the hottest people I have ever seen in my life

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): listen iykyk and me? ik

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (11): a perfect pop song. tove's vocal control, that buzzing synth beat. there's not much that hits that high for me. i have like a billion scrobbles of this song since it's on this album and audiolust/higherlove and i'm not even remotely tired of it. also i'm not even exaggerating when i say that i am in love with sg lewis he is so fucking talented

**1998tweety** (10): devoured

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): SG Lewis put something in this one it's addictive.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): holy fuck, this is where the album started to hit it's peak, because it sounds so great, and it felts refreshing and retro at the same time.

**Ambrosia42** (10): THE SMASH. Doesn’t have that dark lyrical edge typical for Tove since she didn’t really write it, but it’s a hit

**Aoquesth378** (10): Took a, second for me to get into it but now I am and I'm in LOVE.

**beeozan** (10): BOP! Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs is also on this although they're not credited so that's a fun fact

**DirtyRat583** (10): SG LEWIS BESTIE

**imbaby122** (10): bro this song is actually alive and sentient and it told me to dance and sweat and go to the club and be horny wtffff

**impla77** (10): MEGABOP

**JIRACHI** (10): so close to giving this my 11

**just\_thonking** (10): Fuck it this gets a 10

**kappyko** (10): Ngl sometimes it takes noticing a certain lyric to like a song more and the lyric about sweat on your naked chest i mean jaw drops to floor steam coming out of ears fireworks shoot from head slamming own head with hammer like that's so me

**memezaharamole** (10): SG Lewis and Tove Lo were the best duo of 2022, everything was a banger

**Nagisoid** (10): Tove Lo I love you but please turn off ur phone or give me a dall. I cannot support this slayage. Please stop this. I know this isn't your heart

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): pussy facing the world

**oscarbrierley1** (10): the song that makes me want to throw ass most in the rate.

**ReallyCreative** (10): SG LEWIS YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS

**saviorARMY101** (10): BOPPP

**sharts-n-farts** (10): I want to dance to this song in clubs, what a good collab!

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I don’t think this has left my on repeat playlist on Spotify since it dropped

**throwaway-7650** (10): he fathered here

**shipperondeck** (9.8): i was obsessed with this song when the album first dropped and it's still so good

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): this being as close to rating an sg lewis album track as we’re gonna get :’(

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): https://twitter.com/JCov1/status/1581794174005047296?lang=en

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): eric prydz who

**alexismateofan** (9): Oh fuck this gets me GOING to the MOON.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): SG Lewis did what he had to do on this album.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): love when she kinda lets go vocally the way she does on the chorus here

**reput4tionera** (9): ok im living

**shckskndv** (9): tfw you casually write a brilliant 80s dance track, into a market literally fit to burst with them

**skeeturz** (9): i really enjoyed this one, i'm not even really sure why, but something about it reminds me of the early 2000's

**Stryxen** (9): a song so good it’s on TWO albums

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Production is hot but of course it is, it’s SG Lewis

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): oh this is kinda cunty

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): I was SO scared this was gonna be one of those modern "updates" on an "older" song. Anyway, I dig the Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs contribution

**camerinian** (8): something is blocking me from really embracing SG Lewis’ production. I think maybe I just wanted more than the lead synth mimicking the vocal melody. Bit of interplay wouldn’t have gone astray. It’s a good melody but

**jman457** (8): Sorry im american, i want to understand swedish dance pop so badly

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8): Eric Prydz outsold

**seanderlust** (8): eric prydz outsold but he outsold most pop music so this can also be good

**uberpigeon** (8): i love a chunky synth

**vayyiqra** (8): No real comment but I want to shoutout SG Lewis; was reading some interviews where he talks about learning about disco and electronic music history and its queer and black roots; given the sometimes broey nature of the electronic genre it's great to see straight white guys doing this kind of thing; also his music is just good? stream *Times* it's great seriously) ♀️

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): ok dead or alive

**modulum83** (7.8): these songs sound great but they’re starting to blend together

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): this crypt of the necrodancer ass beat

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's nothing too revolutionary, but a fun track

**AHSWeeknd** (7): this H&M beat, I can’t

**Awkward\_King** (7): this was like my favourite track on the album but one day it just like.. unclicked with me i guess? it is still a bop but sg lewis' really sparse production just doesnt work for me here

**DrumBeatGlass** (7): Weird combination, an 80s inspired track with the big, bright, neon synths plus sexy lyrics. They both don't collide well. Buth I gotta admit, the production is sick

**IIIHenryIII** (7): aspiring banger

**phonethephoenix** (7): nothing special but still solid!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Feral club music (one of my favorite kinds of club music)

#misandrists

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): torn on this because the synths are some of SG’s best and its boppy, but this feels less distinctively Tove than a lot of the other songs on the album

**queershoulder** (6.5): not sure about this one sometimes i love it and sometimes it's a skip

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): unfortunately it seems eric prydz may have ended them

**moonshxne** (6.3): appreciate that it's more layered and intricate, but the synth hook is so harsh on the ears 😣

**bloodjet** (6): sounds messy, and not in a good way

**CrimsonROSET** (6): imagine not even being the best SG Lewis collab on the album

**Raindrac** (6): Decent dance-pop song. I'm struggling to think of what to say for this one. This rate is really testing my ability to come up with various permutations of "It sounds alright, but I don't really care about it."

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): this is like cute but just soooo unremarkable a million people could've made this

**runaway3212** (5): this album is so repetitive in some points

**scythersboots** (5): the forgetfulness of this song makes me uninterested in figuring out who SG Lewis is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i think i heard this in the gap once

**apatel27** (4): Should've given this to Ava Max, she would've made it interesting and acted like she cared about the song

**flava** (1.5): that blaring synth work that has this squelching undertone to it just sounds like the worst thing ever, what did my ears do to deserve this?

**hikk** (10): If anyone was disappointed that Grapefruit wasn’t about the grapefruit technique then this is a nice way to make up for it with another fruit related song. Just a classic horny Tove bop with amazing production from SG Lewis, the two are a match made in heaven here. His take on the nudisco trend is still fresh despite oversaturation and they knocked it out of the park here. This was in day 3 for a while which was very cool but unfortunately it ended up missing out in the end, truly too bad.

**pig-serpent** (5): Man, we really just killed both SG Lewis songs back to back huh.  I don’t particularly care for this song, or have much to say about it regardless, but I do think the production is a contender for best on the album, so I at least kind of get the appeal of the song and why it did so well.  I’m also glad it's here to keep this album horny, like it should be.

#pussy taste sweet cuz i ate my pineapple

**Aoquesth378** (11): The perfect Tove Lo song. If we had an album full of tracks like this it would be her magnum opus fr.

**camerinian** (9): ugh, finally, no subtext, no deeper meaning, just good raunchy empty brain horny bullshit. Direct into my veins thank

**JIRACHI** (9): god this is just so sexy. tove and sg lewis are a match made in heaven

**Nagisoid** (9): We need something stronger than the H word for this song

**Leixander** (8): bonk

**oscarbrierley1** (8): good, but the worse of the sg lewis songs.

**reput4tionera** (8): could do more production wise but still slay

**runaway3212** (8): her pussy slayage

**vayyiqra** (8): ew I hate pineapple most overrated fruit but shoutout SG Lewis again for being a dude who rocks; also that pineapple juice thing is a myth by the way, debunked by noted Canadian OBGYN Dr. Jennifer Gunter even, I follow her on Twitter she's very cool ♀️

**ricki** (7.5): this froot looks familiar

**TiltControls** (7): The lyrics go all out, I just wish the production and Tove's performance could match it a little better

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Jack Harlow take notes

**DrumBeatGlass** (6.8): Fresh and juicy. Another great production provided by SG Lewis. Again, lyrics are not the best

**skeeturz** (6): i enjoyed it the more it went along but i didnt find it to be a song i'd listen to outside of re-listening to the album

**apatel27** (5): It could be something but it's a tired sound at this point

**bloodjet** (5): why do i find this so sterile. like there's nothing sexy about the bassline or the delivery

**moonshxne** (4.1): when you're a bit horny but also sleepy af 😪

**Raindrac** (3): Both the beat and hook are generic and unremarkable. I've got nothing against pineapple on pizza, but I'll pass on this slice.

**flava** (1.5): People are like SG Lewis saves this album so badly like this and the other one aren’t the two worst songs here. The only reason why I can imagine someone liking this is because its title is slightly weird and it being slightly reminiscent to some of her best songs from Blue Lips but like this can’t match those, those committed fully to the slut bop, this one commits to calling itself a slut bop but only thinks a slut bop is just annoying, in your face and a weird title, like no, there is nuance to what makes a good slut bop!

**shhhneak** (0): The launch of the Tove Lo fruit song titles that are gross to eat but delicious to drink auditory universe.

**hikk** (10): I love this so much, this is MY bonus rate winner. The Vroom Vroom-lite energy is amazing and I love when Charli goes for this style of vocal delivery, it’s so fun and she sells it so well. Still haven’t seen the film but I do really want to especially knowing some of the other songs on the soundtrack

**pig-serpent** (7): A dirty club anthem, and it’s obvious Charli’s having a lot of fun with this song and her energy is infectious.  The part with her higher pitched singsongy vocals are a huge highlight.  My main issue is that I really only like this style of track when the instrumental has some sort of change up (think Vroom Vroom) or screeching trebles (think Burn Rubber) because this down and dirty raunchy house party vibe has just never been something that connected with me.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Wondering if Charli’s vibe fit perfectly well with the movie or if the movie was inspired by Charli’s vibe

**akanewasright** (10): I’M SO HOT WITH SNOW UP MY NOSE

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): yassss, CHARLIIII!

**Awkward\_King** (10): charli murdered a man at a party and hid his body in the mother lake here....

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Slay of the century. This would put up a serious fight for my 11 if it were in the main rate.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): oscar winner in my heart

**DaHumanTorch** (10): HE'S A LIBRA MOON THAT SAYS A LOT

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): my delusion song

**jman457** (10): This is giving Vroom Vroom charli, robbed of an oscar tbh

**lordofthepotat0** (10): yeah i wish

**Nagisoid** (10): Allie X's dog:

**plastichaxan** (10): Cunty song for a cunty movie iktr

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i would 11 this if I could, because i *am* a hot girl

**reput4tionera** (10): seeing bodies bodies bodies with one other person in the theater was such an experience

**seanderlust** (10): sometimes you just need a brain-off bop that makes you feel like the sexiest person on the planet.

**shipperondeck** (10): i too take my clothes off for the neighbors (i forgot to close my shutters)

**skeeturz** (10): I absolutely love it, it oozes cunt

**slimboyfriend** (10): this is so XCX World coded for pandering so blatantly to the gays

**Stryxen** (10): this is the best mediocre movie ever

**Frajer** (9): Charli and Rachel Sennott vibing makes perfect sense

**imbaby122** (9): this song is so epic bc you can read it as ironic or as deadass and either way it’s still a 9.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (9): real hot girl shit

**modulum83** (9): she managed to make the vroom vroom sound straight 😭

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Rachel Sennott main pop girl

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): upper. middle. class.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I love the song, but I just have to say that BBB is one of the best horror movies ever made. It’s a modern classic that is gonna go down in history, and Charli's name will be remembered forever

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): when this played in bodies bodies bodies that was MY avengers moment

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): so if bodys by csh got a 7.722 average in ratrick, surely a song called bodies bodies bodies will have an average 3 times as high, so i predict this song will get an average of 23.166

**Ambrosia42** (8.3): a fun bop but nothing too special

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (8): Classic Charli.

**impla77** (8): ok maybe i have a degradation kink

**queershoulder** (8): not one my favorites but i still love love

**runaway3212** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FDfrlpQM8Q

**saviorARMY101** (8): this indeed makes me feel like a hot girl 😌

**ricki** (7.7): this song would be amazing in a commercial for cleavage

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): peaks with the snow up my nose part

**TiltControls** (7.5): i do hot shit, spend his income on my outfit

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**beeozan** (7): i do hot shit

**jackisboredtoday** (7): thinking about that tweet wondering if Charli actually saw bodies bodies bodies or if she just got emailed a plot summary and vibe again

**phonethephoenix** (7): see this is hard cause i don't really think this song is that good but also it's great if that makes sense? the perfect song to like, listen to on your way to work.

**thatplatypus99** (7): this isn’t great but it is cunty

**welcome2thejam** (7): That reminds me, where is the Body rave dj of Car Seat Headrest & Megan Thee Stallion

**jasannn** (6): discount vroom vroom ep track

**UselessTacooo** (6): dollar tree sophie

**thedoctordances1940** (5.6): it is interesting and I could imagine a song with this beat being great but I just don't like what Charli is doing over it

**AmandaYoung2083** (5.3): Needs more VROOM VROOM

**Aoquesth378** (5): the song feels very jarring, the lyrics are very basic with no substance. I do like the second verse but that's it.

**shesdoingyoga** (5): I like this but I also hate it

**throwaway-7650** (5): yeah hot in it cleared this I fear

**bogo** (4): doesn’t work for me. sorry!

**frogaranaman** (4): about as interesting as the movie itself

**shckskndv** (4): I too am also a bitch girl

**shhhneak** (3.3): Love you Rachel Sennott! Yeah…

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): I'm sorry, this isn't it. Felt like she was trying to recreate what she was doing on the Vroom Vroom EP/mixtapes but failing.

**alexismateofan** (2): you remember the song Crash by Gwen Stefani? This is the worst version of it. Which is impressive when you remember how badly that flopped in its rate.

**moonshxne** (2): charli is so very hot but this is very much not

**DrumBeatGlass** (1): just delete

**vayyiqra** (1): Really want to like this in the "lol what an intentionally-obnoxious shitpost kind of song" way but instead I find it really annoying and am sad about that. It's a fine line.

**hikk** (10): This is such a smash and for me was the best taste of Crash we got before the album released. I’m honestly a little shocked that this didn’t make it to day 3, it’s one of my faves in the entire rate and I was under the impression that it was a major fan fave but I guess it has its tankers. The Janet influence is apparent here and it’s so good, every part of this song is catchy to the highest degree and is just an expert display of Charli’s hook writing abilities.

**pig-serpent** (8): Never one of my favorite songs, but it’s a fun bop that gets in and gets out.  It had a lot of stans and made a few runs for the top before being smacked in the face by low scores every time it got momentum, and in the end it was enough to lose the day 3 spot it had for almost the entire rate.

#she's still on mother list

**buddhacharm** (11): The queen that should've won RPDR UK4:

**RandomHypnotica** (11): [I can't say I didn't try](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847147094937567234/1098399499468152923/IMG_9650.jpg)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Charli said “I’ll do pop, but I’ll still be repetitive”

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): those synths made my bussy clench every time I dance to it.

**alexismateofan** (10): this song has the banger capacity of three songs like goddamn. Fuck me up!!

**Ambrosia42** (10): it’s amazing everyone moved

**Aoquesth378** (10): Such a fun song and I love the production. Imma make you my imma make you my imma make you my Baby.

**Awkward\_King** (10): still ridiculous how many plays i have of what is the song equivalent of a long moan but she ate here!!! its so seductive and playful, an amazing intersection of janet and like nelly furtado

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I know some people don’t like it when Charli gets super repetitive with her lyrics…but those people are wrong and they can be ignored.

**bogo** (10): im baby

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): now THIS is how you do a short song that feels complete! verses, choruses, a BRIDGE!, and the final chorus has some zest to it! funky and fun

**cremeebrulee** (10): honestly, i don't process anything past the introductory 5 seconds because they are SO good. they're so dreamy & bollywood-esque, i hope she leans more into that sound in the future

**CrimsonROSET** (10): hypno didn’t carry this for 9 months for you guys to just cut it at #4

**Frajer** (10): it's Charli dramatic pause Baby

**frogaranaman** (10): 👼

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): the catchiest song Charli has released in years… like you cannot stop me from going “baby” along with her

**ignitethephoenix** (10): ass shaker

**IIIHenryIII** (10): so many baby songs out there and she ended all of ‘em

**imbaby122** (10): OH and finally if u wanna throw around midlife crisis fucking throw it at me - I’m getting older, I’m getting hotter, my tits are stunning, I’m in great shape, I’m dancing, I’m progressing and I’m living my best life - and that the tea ☕️

**JIRACHI** (10): IMMA MAKE YOU MY IMMA MAKE YOU MY IMMA MAKE YOU MY IMMA MAKE YOU MY

**Leixander** (10): perfectly catchy

**Nagisoid** (10): I love this yassified version of I Bet on Losing Dogs, she devoured

**reput4tionera** (10): mmm baby

**sarcasticsobs** (10): STRINGS

**saviorARMY101** (10): BOPPPPP

**skeeturz** (10): this one also had a stranglehold on me that it has not let loose

**throwaway-7650** (10): me when I'm asked who the surprise guest at the NMIXX concert is

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): amafookiwap amafookiwap amafookiwap amafookiwap

**UselessTacooo** (10): Imma fuck you up still lives in my head rent free

**vayyiqra** (10): A really catchy tune! One where the "mainstream pop" thing really worked! If the whole album had been like this I'd love it. 🚘

**welcome2thejam** (10): Watching the best moment of this song over and over on the weekly chart videos caused me to become Baby-pilled over the past few months

**shipperondeck** (9.8): the way i was obsessed with this song when it dropped..

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (9.7): ….baby

**jasannn** (9.5): IM READY TO MOP

**luckyphase** (9.5): i love this song

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): this was my first favorite song from this album but for some reason it's not getting a ten.

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): this wins the "most sung to my cats in this rate" award

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): really catchy!

**ktajlili** (9): I thinks this a perfect pop song. Great writing and production.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (9): fuck me up!!!

**shckskndv** (9): I think Charli’s chain smoker vocal fry on the word “baby” is extremely accurate to the spirit of the 80s.

**uberpigeon** (9): she was so real for imma fuck you up imma fuck you up imma fuck you up imma fuck you up

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): well yes

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): like the choruses of I got it and unlock it, this one just transcends words

**beeozan** (8): a good song wow

**camerinian** (8): conflicted cos the production on this is so slay but Charli is giving a *lot* less than she normally does

**indie\_fan\_** (8): racing game music (compliment)

**queershoulder** (8): I am a huge charli stan but I think this is my least favorite form crash

**Stryxen** (8): this like doesn’t even seem like a charli song but it’s very good

**1998tweety** (7): a small bop

#de-mi-lo-va-to

**ImADudeDuh** (7): fuck this song because having to search for duplicates for this on the popheads charts involves me ctrl + f ‘baby’ and seeing 252 results

**prettybirbkotori** (7): i liked this song when it came out but i don’t think i’ve come back to it in months

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): there is a good song trying to break out of here somewhere deep down in this underwhelming shell

**Raindrac** (6.5): Not much to say about this one besides "bop". It's a fun and well-written but somewhat forgettable pop song that's clearly aiming for mass appeal and isn't very ambitious. In that sense, it's basically Crash in a nutshell.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): I know there are people that don't like this album that consider this it's saving grace, and yeah it's better than a lot of the album, but it's still not really too interesting

**scythersboots** (6): fascinating incorporation of new jack swing but gives me anxiety

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): You're gonna fuck up a baby???

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): you could say that I’m bullying Charli’s baby 😎

**dreamingpastel** (5): Wait, what did Charli want to do again?

**nick1372** (5): Charli XCX: is like Adam Levine for gay people. But while every Maroon 5 song is about how the hot sexy sex is so bad for him, Charli sings about how the hot sexy sex is bad for YOU. Somehow I have to stan Charli for this even though I want to rip Adam Levine's nuts off every time I hear his stupid voice. Baby sucks tho she's done this way better before (track 10, etc)

**moonshxne** (4.5): hate how the chorus veers off into bored spoken word

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (4): It's fine.

**bloodjet** (4): i lovee the intro but the song feels like it's never progressing anywhere. by the end it just feels so grating. always tempted to skip this song after the first chorus

**impla77** (4): no thanks

**DrumBeatGlass** (3.5): Another lyrics to delete. This time she comes with something groovy. The production could be more risky

**shhhneak** (3): Sugar and Spice’s original song for the talent show on the next season of Drag Race All Stars:

**TiltControls** (2): I don't know exactly what it is, but this song (particularly during the chorus) just kind of annoys me when I listen to it. Sometimes the rapid fire works and sometimes I give it a 2

**runaway3212** (1): justin bieber did much more with so much less talent

**jman457** (0): Ok melanie Martinez!

**pig-serpent** (10): The second of three Hold the Girl songs I come back to frequently.  It’s a perfect balance of Lady Gaga-esque bombast and bold instrumental choices, featuring a very synthetic and white-noisy drum shuffle, some lush strings, and instruments that sound like midi’s but good midi’s that sounds slightly off in an interesting way instead of a cheap way.  It’s a fantastic pop ong, probably the most realized this album’s aesthetic will be, and it deserved to make top ten.

**hikk** (5): This has always felt so awkward to me, switching between the inspiration of the chorus to the 2 step beat makes no sense to me and I don’t think it blends well at all. Individually the parts are fine but they don’t come together to make something that’s enjoyable for me. I do get the appeal of this track but ultimately I’m ending day 2 happy this is out since I like every other remaining song quite a lot more.

---

#she is me... i am her...

**1998tweety** (11): so many 10s in the rate but this song does something different, the theatrics...stanning

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): My therapist wants me to write a letter to my younger self but I don’t think I could do better than this soaring dance anthem

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (10): Now THIS is a title track.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the way this song is beyond brilliant.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this song made me cry upon listening to it at the second time, it's that powerful!

**alexismateofan** (10): i wasn’t so sure about giving this a 10 until I heard the ending of the song and that BEAT AT THE END. okay yeah rina you’re serving

**apatel27** (10): Big Mood in Traumatic Childhood

**babadork** (10): I’m not sure if this is still an unpopular opinion, but I like the little mini drop.

**bigbigbee** (10): You haven’t lived until you’ve done a really really fast walk through the city to this song at night while it snows heavily…that final chorus oh my GOD

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Worst title track in the rate. It’s excellent.

**bogo** (10): this is like a whole ass epic movie in 4 minutes and i love it so much

**buddhacharm** (10): This song became the funniest joke for my friend circle. Like whenever any of us are acting crazy and volatile we're like "you NEED to hold the girl right now" and then suddenly we're grounded again. We even started making playlists of artists who, desperately, need to hold the girl (Azealia Banks)

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): do you ever listen to this and think back on all the times you were unkind to your younger self and wish you could give yourself a hug and apologize for it because a lot of it was a response to external forces and not your fault? anyway seeing this live was such a powerful experience that the venue had an electrical problem immediately after she finished it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this kinda eats idc

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): album highlight

**DrumBeatGlass** (10): a well deserved ten, masterpiece, unconventional. The strings really took me out. Put this song in a movie, now!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): the lyrics of this just really resonates with me :(

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): slay, no notes

**impla77** (10): surely the mother moniker is warranted when tending to your inner child

**jay** (10): wig YANKED

**JIRACHI** (10): this is a masterpiece. listening to that final chorus was a life changing experience for me

**phonethephoenix** (10): unironically pretty epic

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Absolute masterpiece here.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): "she is me and i am her" - her looking at the memes of us saying she looks like an enema and a bowling ball

**therokinrolla** (10): The Bridge is the best part of any 2022 song. Dear god.

**throwaway-7650** (10): her best title track like

**UselessTacooo** (10): HOLD THE SLAY HOLD THE MOTHER HOLD THE KUNT

**shipperondeck** (9.8): how many of yall have cried to this song ha ha not just me i hope

**akanewasright** (9.5): she nailed it idk

**TiltControls** (9.5): I kind of hate that weird breakdown after the peak of the chorus from keeping this from being a 10/10 song. Rina's vocals are enough to get it close though.

**Awkward\_King** (9): im fucking HOLDING HER WHAT DO I DO NEXT???

**bloodjet** (9): this should be an anime opening track

**camerinian** (9): all the little touches in the production really elevate this from just being a standard emotional pop ballad. The transitions between each section are just so elegant

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Kinda get some Gaga vibes from this?

**imbaby122** (9): this song is confusingly good. it’s like disney villain uk garage childhood trauma.

**reput4tionera** (9): bring uk garage back please im begging

**runaway3212** (9): okay I swear im not gonna flex too much that I saw rina live but this song was literally so much better live

**skeeturz** (9): the song takes you on such an emotional journey and never loses steam

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): this girl is so fucking held, lois

**Ambrosia42** (8.9): I very much enjoy the melodies and harmonies and production

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): that little girl? Charli XCX actually

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): her vocals elevate this so much

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I like this song but I think the drop after the choral intro is lacking, the chorus feels tinny and hollow where it should be sweeping and grand but it's still a good song and I LOVE the bridge/key change

**queershoulder** (8.2): I really liked this song and i feel like it is somehow nostalgic even though it is new

**Aoquesth378** (8): I really enjoy the production of the song and I think it works as an album opener.  I wish it went harder though.

**beeozan** (8): need the Rina collab with Yuki Kaijura asap

**IIIHenryIII** (8): she said the girl not the chorus, what a lackluster beat drop

**Nagisoid** (8): They seem like really good friends 😍

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): oh i just KNOW if i heard this song when i was 10 i would be make flipnote hatena animations with iris from pokemon black and white

**vayyiqra** (8): I like the backstory of this song being a therapy session we need more of that 🫂

**jman457** (7.8): Really like the influence of church music, cause it adds a nice nostalgic touch.

**nick1372** (7.5): god this slaps live

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): props for the only key change in this rate (i cant actually remember if other songs did and im not going back to check)

**DaHumanTorch** (7): she literally went into the session and said to Jonny and Barney that she felt like making a bon Jovi garage madonna slay. basically they were sailing on the mother slayke and decided to take a sip

**oscarbrierley1** (7): ava max with a great bridge

hikkaru: #not held :(

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this would’ve been a 9 had it not been for the 2017 chopped up vocals pop edm drop chorus

**shckskndv** (7): EXTREMELY impressive mix of styles, the big choral bridge & key change is just one step too far for me though.

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I wish I liked this song more, but parts of the production just feel kind of weirdly empty even when there’s a lot going on

**welcome2thejam** (7): I liked when it became a Kingdom Hearts song

**moonshxne** (6.8): ...Yeah, the first ~~of many~~ misstep~~s~~ is putting "Hold the Girl" *right after* such a tension-building opener. It just sounds deflated in comparison. That aside, I've listened to this so much and yet still feel that much of this song sounds so...incongruous. There's actually a lot to like about the sonic layers individually, but everything prior to the cathartic bridge at the end kinda comes together in such a confoundingly nondescript (?) or just plain bewildering (?) fashion. I'm still very conflicted about the gently tumbling UK garage beat drops and if that really contributes to the experience

**ricki** (6.8): i wish i had stronger feelings about this

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): i like the garage elements and the very Large production but it’s kinda boring

**Raindrac** (6.5): The production is lush and varied, but the chorus underwhelms. The vocals were poorly chopped and sounded neither catchy nor pleasurable to the ears. And much like many other songs on Hold The Girl, it could really use some better mixing. Still, her vocals are great when left unaltered, and the melodies are memorable enough for this song to stand out amongst the sea of mediocre songs in this rate.

**Stryxen** (6.5): i don’t know what it is cuz on paper this song should be amazing but it totally misses the mark for me. Giving it points for swinging big and trying something cool tho

**cocosairdep** (6): the song’s mostly fine but that key change is so corny omg

**dreamingpastel** (6): "She is me and I am her" also happens to be a line in a cringy Tumblr poem I wrote as a teen.

**ktajlili** (6): I think it's an interesting concept that's well-executed...but I'm just not that into the blending of orchestral and electronic sounds. It's just not for me.

**musical\_pyn** (6): I think the release of this single was when I realized this album wasn't going to do it for me in the same way SAWAYAMA did

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Flashes of early Rina but doesn't hit the same. Message is nice, which saves it. Feels like too many musical ideas and they clash more than they mesh

**scythersboots** (6): obviously rina is super talented. i like the lyrics/theme but the strings are just too much.

**seanderlust** (6): i understand that this song is meaningful for rina, having wrote it immediately after a therapy session. that said, even when i understand and relate to the underlying feeling, this song doesn't really click with me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): She kinda dropped the girl with this one (also that key change with the chorus sounds so bad. It's half of the reason why I'm rating it a 6 in the first place)

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I just really don’t like the chopped vocal drop

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (5): sue me…

**shhhneak** (5): Barney Lister: what kind of production would you like? Rina: yes

**flava** (4): I don’t think she’s earning that key change

**thedoctordances1940** (3.2): The melody just sounds way too similar to It's My Life and I can't listen to it without thinking of that and it just really really annoys me. And even apart from that I still never got the hype for it and relistening to it for this rate my opinion of it has only gone down. Like it's just kinda messy and a lot of the little sound effects are just thrown in there for no reason, and then it also has a terrible bridge and a really really fucking tacky key change that it does not earn.

**frogaranaman** (3): production is very Chainsmokers

**uberpigeon** (3): me not understanding people not liking dynasty has come back to bite me
