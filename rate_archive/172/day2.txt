**pig-serpent** (8): Our first elimination! And… this song is good, I fully disagree with this song’s placement.  The acoustic guitar gets a lot of crap, but it's a very pretty instrument and has a distinct texture that can be and often is woven into many other songs.  The album art has a heavenly vibe to it, and this is the song I think lives up to the artwork the most, because of its said inclusion of the acoustic guitar, and it creates a great backdrop for another of Tove Lo's great melodies.  I understand that it was a little too lowkey to get diehard defenders, but I certainly can’t understand any hate thrown at this song, especially with some other songs that deserve this vitriol that didn’t get it.  It won’t be the worst robbery of the day, but it’s not a sign for a happy day 1 ahead of us.

**hikk** (3): Here we have our first out, and I fear this is very well deserved. Sandwiched between an entire album’s worth of synthy dance pop cuts is this folky acoustic moment that is beyond out of place. On its own perhaps it isn’t that bad, but I totally get why for the most part nobody was here for it because it really is just such a momentum killer. Not my personal 0 here but I’m perfectly fine with this as the first boot.

---

##Cuties

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m levitating, this production is IT.

**alexismateofan** (10): its actually impossible for me to rate a first aid kit track lower than 10 like i try to do it and no matter what it autocorrects.

**beeozan** (10): yesss like bring the acoustic guitar too why not

**camerinian** (10): god this is such a gorgeous soundscape. Harmonies are ridiculous and the gentle plucking is such a great template for the song that gives it a delicate quality without becoming a snooze. Hell yeah

**Leixander** (10): amazing collaboration

**Frajer** (9): First Aid Kit is used so well here and they somehow managed to squeeze in the word statistically

**queershoulder** (9): i loved this collaboration so much and i will always love anything first aid kit does!

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): yeehaw

**runaway3212** (8.5): STREAM SILVER LINING

**jman457** (8.2): This is cute…..

**CrimsonROSET** (8): sweet… but psycho.

**shipperondeck** (7.9): kinda wish the title/lyrics described a person rather than """love""" as a concept but thats okay

**phonethephoenix** (7.6): simple but nice! I like first aid kit's voices

**sarcasticsobs** (7.6): idk head empty no thoughts

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): I though First Aid Kit was just another electronic producer feature until they started singing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Medic!

**wasian-invasion** (7): she's cute ig

**DrumBeatGlass** (6.7): Nice addition to the tracklist, a peaceful ballad with a great guest appearance. The lyrics are okay

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): *laughs* ~~ariana~~ First Aid Kit what are you doing here?

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): love is my boyfriend love is a god love is breeze in my hair on the weekend love is a relaxing thought

**seanderlust** (6.2): this is a sidebar but it took me embarassingly long to figure out that ELVIRA the music producer was a different person than elvira, mistress of the dark. maybe she got really into producing random dance pop idk the mother of halloween camp can do whatever she wants!!

**slimboyfriend** (6.2): sounds like two songs that would be better apart

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): these same people collaborated with Zara Larsson for a boring cover of I Need Love and uhhhh....this feels the same.

**Aoquesth378** (6): This might be the only song I've heard by Tove Lo I don't like or listen to on repeat. It's not bad it just simply isn't for me. I find it boring and it doesn't catch my attention like the rest of the album.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): cute is a good word for this but it's also just kinda there

**imbaby122** (6): me except i’m not cute i’m just ok and i’m not cruel i’m just delusional.

**ktajlili** (6): i like the melodies but otherwise pretty mid

**nick1372** (6): this is kinda dumb but First Aid Kit sound just lovely

**sharts-n-farts** (6): The guitar is great but slow songs don’t do it for me.

**vayyiqra** (6): idk it's ok ♀️

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): First Aid Kit sounds like the exact halfway point between Kacey Musgraves and Sia

##Cruelies?  Cruelellas?  Meanies?

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): ZARA LARSSON? (edit: bye I forgot that she's also swedish and not a nigerian woman of color)

**impla77** (5.4): First Aid Kit, I love you but why must you always come out with such mediocre features

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (5): idk if First Aid Kit was well used on this track.

**\_alien-superstar\_** (5): I’ve tried so many times and I just don’t get First Aid Kit.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): i genuinely have no thoughts about this song

**skeeturz** (5): i did not feel too strongly about this one

**bigbigbee** (4.5): In one of the official (?) English translations of the One Piece manga, the translator talks about how they tried to translate a Japanese pun that Luffy misunderstands by playing on how “Cute” kind of sounds a little like “Cruel” in English, before giving up since actually no, they don’t at all. Anyway I have no idea why I remember that so strongly, but it’s what I think of any time I listen to this song.

**akanewasright** (4): it exists I guess

**Ambrosia42** (4): Somehow this is so jarring in this album in a way that True Romance isn’t even

**bloodjet** (4): there's something about this song that annoys me but i can't place it

**IIIHenryIII** (4): not cute

**Nagisoid** (4): And Katie Cruel?

**shckskndv** (4): “love can be cute and cruel” is such a funny lyric

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i dont know man

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (4): idk, it doesn't do anything for me and breaks what could've been an immaculate transition between grapefruit and call on me

**UselessTacooo** (4): there are two wolves inside of me

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Kinda shapeless

**JIRACHI** (3): i did not know what i was listening to

**modulum83** (3): can we please leave this shit in 2016

**oscarbrierley1** (3): what is this country ballad doing inbetween two synth pop songs?

**reput4tionera** (3): now…

**DaHumanTorch** (2): i'm still convinced they hit upload with this accidentally in the album on release day and just went with it

**Raindrac** (2): Really boring; there's not enough going on here. What was the point of this?

**Awkward\_King** (1): i fucking hate first aid kit and i really dont know why but this only furthers that

**Stryxen** (1): ew jesus gross

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): boring as hell sorry

**1998tweety** (0): this chorus has negative energy and the lyrics are horrid

**apatel27** (0): Coldplay would make this interesting

**cashewconstellation** (0): this is actually a crime towards humanity what the hell is wrong with her

**hikk** (4): I totally see why this is so low, in fact for a large portion of the rating period it was at #58. Like Cute & Cruel it definitely interrupts the album’s momentum, being placed in the middle of the SMASHAS baby/lightning/yuck, but at least this one has the courtesy to be a synthy ballad instead of a random acoustic cut. Regardless though, it does nothing for me and clearly that’s also the case for the majority of raters.

**pig-serpent** (3.5): Charli XCX has written some amazing ballads.  Charli has written some amazing ballads for the 2022 album called Crash.  None of these great ballads are called "Every Rule."  It spent a lot of time in last place, and honestly I wish it stayed there over Cute & Cruel, it’s just not giving anything and it’s hard to believe this was one of  AG’s 2 contributions to this album.

---

## Yeah we can count this as mid day 1

**TiltControls** (10): love being able to root for at least 1 charli song until it leaves mid day 1

## Nothing can stand between them and their crush

**AHSWeeknd** (10): hoe anthem but make it emotional

**akanewasright** (10): Do not mope over a former flame the week a mid charli single comes out, you will be stuck with it for the rest of your life

**alexismateofan** (10): oh no my weakness soft love songs charli really getting me going

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I hate rules, why can’t I give this an 11 too?

**reput4tionera** (10): i love a good charli xcx infidelity anthem

**shhhneak** (10): shhhneak this is the 7th rate in a row you’ve trauma dumped about a past relationship.

**modulum83** (9.5): daniel lopatin please miss just once i beg

**apatel27** (9): Cute Charli best Charli

**dreamingpastel** (9): Definitely feels like the odd one out in the album, but it's a good black sheep

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Reminds me of “Emotional” from *No. 1 Angel*, one of my favorite Charli tracks.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): its not you its me :( (sike its you)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): don’t break rate rules tho or the host will break your kneecaps

**Aoquesth378** (8): Good song but I'm not a huge fan of the theme. I love how it is structured.

**scythersboots** (8): luv this production v Daft Punk

**vayyiqra** (8): I love autotune and ballads suddenly! 🚘

**hakkerj** (7.7): Charli LOVES to cheat

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): Expected a bit more out of A.G. Cook and OPN, but sad and sweet overall nonetheless

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): it's a sweet ballad but definitely not gonna make it to day 2

**shipperondeck** (7.2): somehow both boring and enrapturing

**UselessTacooo** (7.1): cutesy ballad

**babadork** (7): Normally, the tone of the music not matching the lyrics is a songwriting trope I like, but it doesn’t work for me on this one.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Oh we’re breaking rules? Let me give the Loneliest Time title track a 20!

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): i actually really appreciate this in the context of the album because it's a nice breather and doesnt break the flow despite being more chill but at the same time... i dont ever go back to it individually?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Charli XCX tax evasion arc

**imbaby122** (7): this was the song about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating, etc. that lana del rey was talking about.

**phonethephoenix** (7): ag Charli is still one of my fav partnerships but like. this song leaves a little something to be desired, but it's not bad by any means

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): This one is decent. Should've been given the Matrix/Avril 2002 pop-rock treatment. Yeah it would've probably sounded like "F2F" but still.

**skeeturz** (7): it's very cute and mellow i love it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I'll always be kinder to cheating songs that at least acknowledge that they're morally wrong

**1998tweety** (6): this is not doing it for me

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): every album here has a boring song and this takes that place, it reminds me of the Neon Mixtape Tour - Choose Your Seeds from Plants v.s. Zombies 2, but more boring.

**camerinian** (6): highest score: 7, lowest score: 4. Controversy: a record-breaking 0.3

**Nagisoid** (6): Dua Lipa during the lockdown:

**prettybirbkotori** (6): shes cute or whateva

**shckskndv** (6): aaaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaa-aaaaaaaaaa

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): i love that charli is unashamedly an absolute nightmare to date and just keeps making songs about it

**welcome2thejam** (6): Break the Rules came out nine years ago, talk about a lack of character development

pig-serpent: ## Okay but there's a reason there's a rule against cheating though

**bloodjet** (5.8): just ok. i guess it's another song i'm tempted to skip, though maybe it's just because yuck is such a bop. the aahs after the chorus is kinda annoying. she's done better ballads than this

**bigbigbee** (5.5): wheels out the “Mario Dire Dire Docks synths” comment again

**DrumBeatGlass** (5.5): Lyrics are kinda weak, but not the worst. This track is boring at the beginning, but thankfully develops throughout. This ahhhaa sounds like moaning

**Ambrosia42** (5): super mario 64 water level song about cheating

**ignitethephoenix** (5): why did she drop this flop ballad in the middle of a boppy album

**Stryxen** (5): also overhated. But just fine

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i dont think ive ever liked a single ballad that charli has made

**jman457** (4.8): Idk kind of boring

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): was made to be broken

**jasannn** (4): Did they really break every rule making a standard retro-ish ballad

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (3): Idk this just didn't connect. Not sure I like ballad Charli.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): a Charli ballad would be between a snubbed toe and a new Drake album in the list of things that I want to receive

**ktajlili** (3): okay this is the only song I don't like on the main album. i get what she's going for but I am really NOT a fan of the cheesy 80s vibe. It sounds so spare by comparison. like almost underproduced? I can't explain it but it just falls flat...

**ricki** (3): https://gfycat.com/keengrandioseindochinahogdeer

**cremeebrulee** (2.7): girl just dump huck its that easy

**flava** (2.5): Charli describes this immoral yet allegedly “so passionate it is worth hurting everyone” with all this misery and dour tone, like dump them both

**kappyko** (2): "Hnghhhhh" - charli xcx 2022

**Leixander** (2): the autotuned wail(?)... no thanks

**Raindrac** (2): ...Was I just listening to something? I already forgot it.

**Awkward\_King** (1): charli got so many songs about cheating bitch i think u might be the problem ava max was right

**thedoctordances1940** (1): I generally like to think I'm not too balladphobic, i mean i am kinda, but not to the extent where I think it's impossible for any ballads to be good whatsoever but god this is so uninteresting and it has a.g. cook and opn production how do you squander that so badly

**beeozan** (0): nothing of a song

**DirtyRat583** (0): cute! anyway

**impla77** (0): babes this isn’t Lady Chatterlys Lover just get together

**JIRACHI** (0): this is so boring that chorus is so bad how did this make the cut

**runaway3212** (0): She literally made so much good music just to throw away all that artistic growth on this song

**hikk** (4): Like with Cute & Cruel I really feel like nobody asked for this. This is vaguely more instrumentally interesting but nowhere near enough to warrant its inclusion on the album amongst all the other bops, and it’s no surprise to see it out in the bottom 3.

**pig-serpent** (4): Um… this is a boring song and I have nothing to say about it.  It got 3rd to last and I can’t say I disagree with that placement.  Uh, at least it’s a little different than the rest of the album.

---

## Accepting responsibility is a very mature and sexy thing to do

**IIIHenryIII** (10): is this a cover? I swear I've heard this song before

**dreamingpastel** (9.7): I know the ballad has to go somewhere, but putting it directly after Pineapple Slice was a funny choice

**Aoquesth378** (9): I feel this way a lot so I felt validated hearting this song on first listen.

**jackisboredtoday** (9): this is gonna get so robbed and i'm already trying to hold back my hate bc of it

**jman457** (8.9): dramatic bop

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): I’m just realizing how many of these songs talk about her love dying or dying because of love…but yeah it’s pretty good, not the best on the album. I like where it fits into the album while it’s playing

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): this is great but it’s definitely doomed for day 1…

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Actually really appreciate the more stripped back moments on this album.

**sharts-n-farts** (8): this gets me right in the feels in a good way.

**skeeturz** (8): it's a slower song but i don't hate it!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Why does her voice eat up all the other girls in this rate

**UselessTacooo** (7.8): for a guitar ballad on a synthpop album it does what it needs to

**babadork** (7.5): I can’t decide if I like this or if I like it because it is unexpected.

**modulum83** (7.5): oh this is a nice coldplay type bop

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): me when i get home and the cats confront me after i forgot to feed them in the morning

**1998tweety** (7): Taylor can't relate

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): Why wasn't First Aid Kit on this one???

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I’d say why is this here but Tove Lo makes it work

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is boring at first until the end hits my head hard.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it’s very DCOM

**imbaby122** (7): no one does self-destructiveness better than tove lo. charli tried but no one can top the og.

**phonethephoenix** (7): i like her voice!

**shhhneak** (7): This sounds like an AI voice you’d find on a fake Sia album.

**throwaway-7650** (6.9): who let younger now miley cyrus into the rate

**DrumBeatGlass** (6.7): The placement of this track is bad, but the production isn't. The lyrics are kinda childish, but not the worst

**seanderlust** (6.5): i guess i just don't click with the tove ballads

## That guy over there did it!

**impla77** (6): this isn’t good but its sweet

**Nagisoid** (6): Maybe I'm the problem 😔

**prettybirbkotori** (6): very jarring jump from the sexy sex sex song to this

**runaway3212** (6): meh

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Switched up the sounds but to little avail

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): early 2010's rihanna b-side energy

**akanewasright** (5): it’s fine

**JIRACHI** (5): what

**Raindrac** (5): The acoustic guitar sounds nice, but... what was the point of this? There aren't even any verses! There are only so many times that you can repeat such a mediocre chorus before I want to skip to the next song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): how many tiktoks exist of gays learning to play guitar for the first time playing this in an acoustic very poorly

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): to blame for ruining the album's flow? yeah. yeah you are

**vayyiqra** (5): sorry this goes in one ear and out the other ♀️

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): these acoustic tracks just dont work

**alexismateofan** (3): yeah you kinda are

**apatel27** (3): What's the use putting a bad guitar song on a dance pop album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This song jointflopping with Forgiveness in being my lowest score, boring as hell, but not bad enough to give a 0 to I guess.

**Leixander** (3): to blame for lowering my average for this album, yes

**thedoctordances1940** (2.6): there's a melody in here that's reminding me of something and I can't figure out what it is it feels kinda coldplayish idk. song sucks anyway though

**Awkward\_King** (2): its actually not that serious

**shckskndv** (2): my girl really pulled out that guitar, sat on that piano, and clapped all up on that damn mic bless her heart

**welcome2thejam** (2): There's a Rina song in this rate that felt like a good variation of Kelly Clarkson type pop rock. This is a bleh variation of that

**moonshxne** (1): when a song just *really sucks*, who's to blame?

**reput4tionera** (1): this killed all momentum from the last 3 songs

**Stryxen** (1): it’s like if fight song were bad

**camerinian** (0): what is this doing here. What compelled her to make this Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) ass acoustic jumpscare on this album of otherwise bops. Not to say she can’t break the album up with a ballad, but this doesn’t even remotely fit and it kills the pacing of the album. In a vacuum, this song is perfectly mid radio filler, but the notion of ditching your entire soundscape and thematic focus just to squeeze this on to the album is utterly baffling.

**oscarbrierley1** (0): the mixing of this makes me feel like i have an ear infection. the drums are so loud and everything else is so crunchy

**shipperondeck** (0): zzz

**hikk** (9): This caused so much discourse and for what? Personally I think it's a cute little song, perhaps not the best use of an iconic sample, not the best use of a Rina collab, and I get the criticisms that the drop is a bit limp... but even despite those issues I still enjoy this quite a bit, it's still endlessly catchy and I think there are some small production quirks that shine through regardless of the boring allegations. Bottom 4 is kind of insane for this imo...

**pig-serpent** (4): I have extremely conflicted feelings on this song, and at the end of the day I feel like the new drop isn't strong enough (even the crowd at a Charli concert didn't seem into it :/) or really different enough than Cry For You's to warrant this being an interpolation over a cover.  But at the same time, Charli and Rina's new verses are much stronger than the verses of the original so it's not like this rendition doesn't have a reason to exist. 

 Everyone expected this song to be super controversial, and my brain always thinks having polarizing scores will lead to a mid score because it always forgets most people grade on a scale of 7-10 so having 50% high scores and 50% low scores is actually extremely bad.  I really thought there would be enough defenders for this song for it to make high day 1 instead of bottom five and being the first Rina song out.

pig-serpent: ## Go Queens!  Give us nothing!!!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this is so overly dramatic, like girl chill, it’s just penis

**Awkward\_King** (10): ill defend this song til the day i die idc. EXPECTING WOMEN TO PUT EFFORT INTO THEIR MUSIC IS MISOGYNISTIC omg let her release a lazy banger

**bogo** (10): i do realize that the interpolation is very blatant but idk i still think the song slays

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this is good, OKAY??? I WILL BE VINDICATED ONE DAY!!!

**queershoulder** (10): chorus is so catchy

**reput4tionera** (10): i need uk garage to actually come back

**sharts-n-farts** (10): Love the sample and love the collab.

**Xaviersi** (10): I may have deluded myself to thinking this is a 10 because it samples a throw back and involves two of my absolute faves but damnit it's a bop!

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): it could be argued that Cry For You is better, but this is still pretty great

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): is it lazy? Yes! Is it a bop? Yes!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I was so glad when this came out and popheads finally understood my disappointment in Backseat featuring Carly

**thatplatypus99** (9.5): this song is like anti cunt idk

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): why is it that every time gay TikTok gets excited over a snippet they end of trashing it after release? i'm a sucker for UK garage and the sample works well idc.

**Frajer** (9): I hope Charli isn't actually kissing George in an airport bathroom

**runaway3212** (9): vernon outsold

**vayyiqra** (9): Statistically, someone had to like this song so I guess I might as well! Don't care if it's part of the "lazy interpolation" trend, I like it anyway. 🚘

**kwcty6888** (8.8): prefer the original but this still slaps

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): YES they couldve done more with such an iconic sample but also like... this is still fun! also funny to me that i heard Rina do this live before Charli since i had to skip out on seeing the Crash tour

**luckyphase** (8.7): i didn't need another version of cry for you but I listened to it a lot anyway

**shipperondeck** (8.7): idc i still enjoy it a lot for some reason (Vernon remix better tho)

**bookthieving** (8.5): it's reassuring to know that i will never be as insufferable as i was the day the vernon/a.g. cook remix came out

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (8): I hate to say it but Cry For You is still the better track.

**akanewasright** (8): this is lazy as hell, and “you know I go insane everytime you have to catch a fight” is a clumsy opening line, but I have charli shaped brain worms idk

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): just a couple of MOTHERS having fun in a uk-garage song that samples Cry For You, the last chorus sounds like Ava Max though, unfortunately.

**plastichaxan** (8): This is actually great I don’t care

**prettybirbkotori** (8): ‘oh the sample is lazy’ ‘oh a collab w charli and rina could be so much better’ ok and?? it fucks

**wasian-invasion** (8): excuse my enlightened centrism for a moment but the whole drama when this song came out was so stupid on both sides

**jman457** (7.7): my unpopular opinion is that their vocals sell the bridge way more than the original

**Raindrac** (7.7): Just a week ago, a certain hook was looping through my mind when I tried to figure out which song it was from: "You'll never see me again / So now who's gonna cry for you?". Remembering that Charli XCX interpolated Cry For You and that I had recently listened to her version of it, I went to listen and... Oh. That's when I realized that I was actually remembering the original version, not the Charli XCX version. After all, Charli changed the lyrics. And yeah, that just about sums up how similar Beg For You is to Cry For You. 



 But despite finding the lyrics of Cry For You much more memorable, I actually prefer Beg For You both musically and vocally. It's a pretty great modern reimagining of Cry For You. Gotta say though, nothing makes an album sound more inadequate than when one of the best hooks on the album wasn't even written for it.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Look, it obviously doesn't hold a candle to September's original, but this is still a pretty good song.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): this would cross the 8 average if we rated the vernon remix btw

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): September's best output since Cry For… wait…

**indie\_fan\_** (7.3): this is overhated, idc

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): oh ok I'm kind of enjoying this now? I mean it's just the same generic Digital Farm Animals beat they always use but also it's a pretty solid 2-step beat and yeah this is very very very basic british chart bait with a really lazy sample I feel like it has a lot of the worst elements of modern (British) pop music but idk it's also kinda good. Maybe that's just because I'm actually just happy for something somewhat enjoyable by this point in the tracklist

**apatel27** (7): Lazy sampling but it's good enough

**camerinian** (7): the way this collab was hyped to the heavens and then that hype immediately cratered when the teasers came out showing it was based around a super obvious meme sample is something that I hope *a lot* more artists are paying attention to. Either that or they saw that it was the highest charting single from the album and we’re doomed to repeat this nightmare scenario countless more times before this soulless venture capitalist archive-hoarding bullshit trend finally dies out and we can all hop away from the infinite chasing of the nostalgia and recognisable franchise cycle that has come to dominate or influence basically every form of pop culture since our pandemic-induced desire for mindless childhood comfort food lazily disguised as New Product. Song’s fine by the way.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): oh neptune

**dreamingpastel** (7): I've listened to the A.G. Cook and Vernon remix so much, the original version now sounds incomplete

**ktajlili** (7): I really like this. It's got a solid 00s disco vibe and yeah it's not as good as the song it samples but it still is enjoyable in a chill sort of way

**nick1372** (7): finally... an anthem for being racist in bed

**sarcasticsobs** (7): The hype I had… it could never have been lived up to tbh…

**skeeturz** (7): it's perfectly okay, if not a little underwhelming

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): when you copy your friend's homework but read the answer wrong

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): y'all broke her with this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Well… it's not exactly an improvement on the original…

pig-serpent: ## Entitled Fans

**impla77** (6.8): ngl I’m uncultured so I don’t know the sample from the original, but yeah.. its the best part of this

**phonethephoenix** (6.8): this song was a disappointment when it came out and still kind of is now! I don't really care for the lyrics

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Probably gonna be the most controversial song in the rate and it’s like fine.

**jasannn** (6.5): not terrible but disappointing sparse for a dream collab

**JIRACHI** (6.5): another disappointing collab on this album

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): not having rina sing a bit on the chorus was such a misses opportunity, it should be a real duet not just a verse.

**seanderlust** (6.5): yeah the original outsold, but charli's right that the tempo change in rina's delivery is cool

**scythersboots** (6.2): TOO cry for you

**1998tweety** (6): its not bad but it is underwhelming

**Aoquesth378** (6): I had such high hopes for this collab. I still have high hopes for a, collab between them but this ain't it.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (6): I really wish I liked this more than I do because I like rina and charli, and I was really hyped for them to work together, but it just feels very half-baked to me. The AG Cook remix sounds better but Rina's barely on it.. It feels like this song could've easily been improved with some tweaks to the instrumental

**Nagisoid** (6): This was kinda the blueprint for Alone in dissapointing features that sample dance classics

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's really not bad it's just dreadfully disappointing. Rina's verse is great at least

**shckskndv** (6): a good driving song.

**shesdoingyoga** (6): This definitely did not live up to the hype that a Rina Charli collab had before this.  It’s not a bad song but it feels like its missing something

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): a.g. remix outsold but people were too hard on her

**bloodjet** (5.5): this song is kinda ava max coded

**alexismateofan** (5): my ears glazed over what was going on

**DaHumanTorch** (5): i just don't know why anyone would ever choose to put this on over september

**frogaranaman** (5): it was sooooo slay when Rina showed up to Charli’s Primavera W1 set to perform this song as if Rina didn’t have her own set to perform in 15 minutes literally across the entire park

**imbaby122** (5): mid for you by charLi xcx and rina flopwayama (i have never recovered from the missed opportunity of this collab)

**TiltControls** (5): I already don't love the original, I'm probably not going to love any variations of it

**uberpigeon** (5): imagine squandering rina fucking sawayama on a song even ava would have passed on

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): A waste of talent.

**notarobot3675** (4): i think the remix >>>>

**RandomHypnotica** (3.2): this was just… so fucking underwhelming. Everything about it could've been executed better.

**babadork** (3): I am normally a big supporter of samples and interpolations, but this just makes me want to listen to the original. Also, do not make out in airport bathrooms. Just make out in front of everyone.

**beeozan** (3): you know I go insane every time I hear this song, any plus points here are for Rina trying her best

**cremeebrulee** (3): making out in an airport bathroom would definitely invent new strains of RSV so no ty <3

**kappyko** (3): Dont make me Lets All Poo

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): that moment when you, a queen, come across another queen, and discuss how best to maximise your joint disappointment

**DrumBeatGlass** (2): it wasn't, isn't and won't be a good track. And the lyrics? Delete, cringy

**flava** (1): she was really on her Bebe Rexha shit with this one but she forgot that was for bad btiches and rexhars only

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): a collab between these two should be a ground breaking, non-conventional pop anthem instead of a limp ass 2000s europop-wannabe dirge… a heinous crime truly

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this somehow had negative charisma for me

**jackisboredtoday** (0): this is an ava max song without the campy energy

**moonshxne** (0): not only is it so lazily slapped together in the most lacklustre manner, charli's vocal take is absolutely dreadful to hear

**ricki** (0): a song this uninspired shouldnt bother me so much

**static\_int\_husp** (0): literally the only thing this song evokes in me is a want to listen to Cry For You 10x as much as this

**Stryxen** (0): immediately unmother-listed both of them when this came out.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): somehow this is ava max’s fault

**hikk** (6): This has a nice foundation of a cool bassline but that’s pretty much it, and at this point in the album I feel like a song needs to do more to stand out, which this track flops at. Not much else to say, although maybe bottom 5 is a bit much.

**pig-serpent** (2): That has to be up there with Selena Gomez's "mmm mmm mmm mm mm mmm" for the "Most annoying vocal sample to play for several measures in a row."  On top of it, the instrumental is extremely boring, even with that cool bassline that loses all my interest by the time the first verse is over.  I think rounding out the bottom five is both expected and deserved.

---

## Thank you.  I have straightened out my life now

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That chorus hum throws me off but this remains a bop

**beeozan** (10): that bassline won me over instantly

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I love you like la la la la la la la la la

**DirtyRat583** (10): odd message but i get it

**Leixander** (10): effortlessly cool

**plastichaxan** (10): She’s so real I think we ALL need a good kick in the head

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I want tove to kick me in the head [2]

**UselessTacooo** (10): gagged

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): too relatable

**phonethephoenix** (9.4): cool! i love this chorus

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): miguel be like:

**1998tweety** (9): she was in her cunt bag

**akanewasright** (9): I have such a mental image of [this rough expression](https://twitter.com/dilfshub/status/1655619301909356544?s=46&t=UeAv0KRJsb_oKl5ESUba1Q) in my head when I hear this idk how to explain it

**Aoquesth378** (9): the pre-chorus is to die for (pun intended), although the chorus itself is a bit lacking.

**Awkward\_King** (9): i love a good old "im definitely the problem" song

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): weird but I’m into it

**vayyiqra** (9): The humming at the beginning is kind of annoying but this is a jam ♀️

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): something about this feels so like late 90s? idk how to explain it but it has a vibe that reminds me of like Imani Coppola's Legend of a Cowgirl and those kinds of songs

**babadork** (8.5): Something about this song gives me 2000s British girl group vibes, but I can’t figure out what it is.

**bookthieving** (8.5): SALINA MOVE

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Donkeys when someone grabs their tail

**shipperondeck** (8.5): felt

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (8): Solid track, if a little forgettable.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): that one Miguel clip:

**just\_thonking** (8): Is this trip hop

**sharts-n-farts** (8): The chorus is so groovy.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I do think being kicked in the head would fix what's wrong with me

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): me too

**TiltControls** (8): fallout 3 was better

**runaway3212** (7.5): me too bestie

**sarcasticsobs** (7.4): Bass is cool, "mhm"'s annoyed me a lil

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is okay, that's all I can say.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The mmmmmmmmm part in the chorus….giving a little Look at Her Now energy (a 10 btw).

**bloodjet** (7): the mmhh is kinda annoying and remind of another song but kinda prevent this song from feeling one note

**modulum83** (7): i never liked disco tits tbh

**Raindrac** (7): Kick In The Head stood out on my first listen because of the great bassline, but I ended up not returning to it as much as I expected. I suppose a good bassline can only go so far. Still, it's a pretty groovy song. I like it.

**skeeturz** (7): it's a bit of a weird song but i kinda dig it

**Stryxen** (7): me thinking about arca <3

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): All these songs are like… what if Rare was made by a better singer

**wasian-invasion** (7): the wood plank during anetra's talent show:

## OW!  Why did you do that!?

**IIIHenryIII** (6): actually, sounds like a kick in the balls

**imbaby122** (6): that bass line stuck on loop is making me dissociate and now i rlly need a good kick in the head.

**nick1372** (6): "Kick in the Head" is such a weird phrase. like 95% of the population is not athletic enough to kick someone even above the waist why is this a semi-popular saying

**slimboyfriend** (6): hate the humming

**prettybirbkotori** (5.5): now girl what the hell is this i dont know if i love or hate this

**queershoulder** (5.1): side is preferred on this album for me personally

**camerinian** (5): not sure about that groaning eh

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): this could have been good if the chorus wasn’t whatever that was

**ktajlili** (5): zzz

**Nagisoid** (5): Me after looking at Matt Berninger in the Bloodbuzz Ohio video

**welcome2thejam** (5): Oh, I already know this mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm bit is gonna knock some points off. Shame cause it's got a solid groove and she's hitting a nice mix of playful but wounded, but it annoys me enough to never wanna hear it again

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): something i'd rather get than having to listen to this again

**JIRACHI** (4.5): i was so bored

**alexismateofan** (4): That’s exactly what it felt like listening to it. What even is this song. It feels like a Madonna outtake in a not good way.

**apatel27** (4): a good 10 second opener connected to a boring 3 minute song

**DrumBeatGlass** (4): That's definitely a song, Tove didn't even try. It's as uninspired as her before having the title kick in the head

**bogo** (3.5): there is zero energy whatsoever in this song and it drives me insane

**DaHumanTorch** (3.5): i just hate that mmmm mmmm chorus so much, ruins about everything good the song had going for it

**dreamingpastel** (3): The hook isn't my cup of tea

**ricki** (3): this song does not deserve this bassline

**shckskndv** (3): I wanna make you mmmmmmmmmmmmm

**throwaway-7650** (3): uhhh... this must be what disc0 tits sounds to its tankers

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): did they have a sample pack called “annoying household noises” that they wanted to try out or did it just happen to work out that way

**oscarbrierley1** (2): this song is another that absolutely does not feel like it belongs here at all. the mmmmmmmmmmm sound is so annoying

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): worst chorus of all time

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (2): a song that feels like it goes nowhere. it's kinda fun, but is just so unsatisfying to me

**reput4tionera** (1): :sob:

**pig-serpent** (3): This was jumping around the bottom 10 spots for the entire rate, and it’s easy to claim balladphobia as an explaination, but with so many A-game ballads in this rate it’s really hard for me to come to this one’s defense.  Sometimes ballads actually are just boring and this is a pretty good example.

**hikk** (0): Originally I wasn’t sure if I was going to give out a 0 in this rate, but while listening through the albums this song in particular was just begging for it I fear… Not to be the most typical old rina stan but the audacity of it to be the most boring song on the album placed right before the middle stretch of absolute gags and slays, I was so bored waiting to get through this slog and that tracklist placement was definitely the nail in the coffin here for me. Sorry jay ily 🫶

---

## Forgive and Forget

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is why I don’t listen to this album too often, it’s only track 5 and I’m already in my feelings

**IIIHenryIII** (10): me when I think I’ll take the high road but then end up digging my key into the side of somebody’s four-wheel drive

**jman457** (10): Such an underrated gem on the album, her you and I moment

**throwaway-7650** (9.8): just know that you're sick for the 0 u/hikkaru tagging you idc

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): These lyrics cut straight to the heart

**impla77** (9.2): I know a fair few people think this song is boring and I just don’t get it!! The chorus just hits so hard

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (9): I love how this connects Catch Me In The Air to Forgiveness.

**Ambrosia42** (9): IIIIIEEIIIEEEIIIIIIIIIEEEIIIEEEIIIIIIIIII

**apatel27** (9): Big Mood in Moving On

**bogo** (9): i’ve seen hate for this one but i find it such a lovely ballad

**ignitethephoenix** (9): great song writing and she just ate this up

**phonethephoenix** (9): not news but Rina is a great singer

**UselessTacooo** (9): this song deserves so much more it’s like the best acoustic of them all

**CrimsonROSET** (8): honestly it’s such a good message about how forgiveness is much more a journey than a destination but instrumentally it kinda just goes nowhere

**flava** (8): probably wouldn’t get this on a regular day but I kinda feel this hitting right now so

**imbaby122** (8): citing the bends era radiohead as inspo for this song activated my pop girly and radiohead daughter senses simultaneously

**queershoulder** (8): very good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): wait why is this is the song on the album everyone hates 😭 this is so good wtf

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.9): sheryl crow: um actually EVERYDAY is a winding road

**bloodjet** (7.2): the pop-rock sound suit this song so well. docking some point because of the silly accent she did at the end lol

**ricki** (7.2): idk how to explain it but this is latin american musical teen telenovela-coded

**shipperondeck** (7.2): one of the holy trinity of kinda mid songs on this album except i actually like it now oops

**1998tweety** (7): filler

**alexismateofan** (7): feels like a less good (???) Catch Me in the Air which would be fine if they weren’t like right next to each other?

**Aoquesth378** (7): I love the song lyrically and it's one of my favorite tracks lyric-wise, I just find it kind of similar to other songs on the album, and it doesn't captivate me as much as I want it to.

**dreamingpastel** (7): I only really like the post-chorus/bridge. Everything else is kinda meh

**DrumBeatGlass** (7): Sounds medieval haha, doesn't give me the same feeling as the previous tracks. The transition to the next song is awesome

**letsallpoo** (7): why does this sound like FU by little mix

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I forget about this song, and apparently so does she since I’m pretty sure this was the only one she didn’t play live from the album when I saw her

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): a grower, but very well-written imo

**vayyiqra** (7): Not a great song but I love the lyrical concept! Revenge is bad in fact she's so right 🫂

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Youuuu want forgiveness (for releasing this album) but IIIIIII can't do it yet

**wasian-invasion** (7): hey rina you can't just do the yodeling on the chorus thing on back to back songs

**xxipil0ts** (7): that after laughter sounded familiar

**Raindrac** (6.5): Forgiveness has a lot of great melodies, and there are a lot of subtle touches in the production that make it stand out; especially in the first verse, where there's enough clarity in the mixing for the strings, guitar, and sparkling synths to stand out. Unfortunately, once the chorus hits, everything is overblown and the sound begins sounding like mush because everything blends together in the noise. Yet another song with unfortunate mixing, but at least Forgiveness has enough detail in the production to encourage relistening to it.

pig-serpent: ## We want some atonement

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): it's fine, I forget that it exists honestly

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): this feels so 2006 soft pop

**hakkerj** (6.2): Paramore outsold

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): unfortunately Paramore made a song with the same theme and it's way better than half of this album.

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (6): rina I will not forgive u

**camerinian** (6): this is the opposite of This Hell where I love the lyrical idea of working through the emotions of trying to confront someone’s past wrongdoing and work through the messy feelings to find contentment within that, and so of course she had to go pair it with an uninspired ¾ ballad progression that does nothing to convey that conflict or any of those feelings. Frustrating.

**ReallyCreative** (6): this feels like one of those times where contributing to an album's cohesion doesn't necessarily make a great song

**reput4tionera** (6): it’s fine

**skeeturz** (6): it's a very okay song, i have nothing against it but i dont love it

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): rina made such a good decision going into like 2000s pop rock ballads even if there are maybe a few too many on this album

**beeozan** (5): there is a cocteau twins song somewhere in there but its drowning

**nick1372** (5): Feels like filler. Whatever substance was here is completely overwhelmed by the stupid AIYAIYAIYAIYAI hook

**prettybirbkotori** (5): this song really illustrates my issue with this album which is that sawayama felt never done before and this album feels like it has been done for 50 years

**runaway3212** (5): this is kinda boring for this album

**sarcasticsobs** (5): I remember really liking at least some stretch of this record, when does that start?

**scythersboots** (5): again, like the message, love her voice, but really wish the production was…less. Like can you imagine how cool this would be as a stripped down ballad.

**sharts-n-farts** (5): This kind of sounds like a country song so it gets low points.

**DaHumanTorch** (4.5): this is just so...nothing

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): this is travelling dangerously close to christian music territory which is funny because the next track is named Holy

**JIRACHI** (4): yeah this was not good

**moonshxne** (4): want to clarify that i adore adult contemporary ballads! it was the sound design that tanked this

**Nagisoid** (4): That's what Rina's begging for after her SAWAYAMA ranking

**oscarbrierley1** (4): the far worse of the powerballads

**Stryxen** (4): Forgettable

**welcome2thejam** (4): What do you mean this is supposed to be "in the world of The Bends-era Radiohead"

**akanewasright** (3): this being in the middle of two runs of songs I like a lot is so painful my god. It’s just so substanceless melodically for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): If was gonna use a 0 in this rate it would be this song but nah it’s not THAT bad. It is very boring though.

**thedoctordances1940** (2.8): ugh

**ktajlili** (2): ugh this is so bad. it sounds like shit.

**shckskndv** (2): I just listened to this & can’t remember how it goes.

**pig-serpent** (9): That single guitar line is somehow the most atmospheric thing on the entire album.  It mashes up one of the most sophisticated beats on the album with Charli pretending to be 15 again, and quite frankly it’s my favorite of the bonus tracks.  I shouldn’t be surprised at how many people thought this song was annoying, but I guess the song registered as too low key and atmospheric to predict this many people would get mad at it.  I could complain about the robbery, but in the end I still like the song and go on listening to it so I guess all I have left to say is “I don’t give a fuck what you think about me (or my taste in music.)”

**hikk** (8): Charli putting on her bratty inflection and doing some sing-talk-rap stuff is so much fun always, I kind of need a whole album where she does her best early Kesha impression. This song’s topic is pretty unique tbh and apt for the Crash era, it extends the typical fuck the haters anthem to the people that really do criticize her the most - her own stans. Everyone was critical of this album’s singles and her fanbase has had their weird moments, so I can’t say this song’s existence isn’t deserved. Unfortunately it ends up flipping here in this rate which I get because the inflection she puts on isn’t for everyone but I do think this deserved a bit better.

---

## Ignoring haters never looked this easy

**AHSWeeknd** (10): you guys, I don’t think she gives a fuck

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yeah overall these bonus tracks are a major serve.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): Bitch BYE. I will NEVER understand what possesses people to be such C*NTS online.

**thatplatypus99** (10): she was so real for this BITCH BYE

**throwaway-7650** (10): I DON'T GIVE A FUCK- BITCH. I SWEAR TO GOD

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): I mean I get it, have you *seen* how annoying some Charli fans are?

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): ik she wrote this immediately after that twitter exchange

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (9.2): I think we all have hated a charli stan

**queershoulder** (9.2): so close to a ten

**cocosairdep** (8): she really gagged the gays with this one, her millie bobby brown moment

**Frajer** (8): Yeah Charli your IDGAF vibes could not be stronger you don't need to tell us

**kappyko** (8): I swear to god she said b b q at some point wtf. PDQ

**musical\_pyn** (8): she channeled the spirit of cher lloyd on this one

**skeeturz** (8): it's very cheeky and reminds me of all my favorite charli tracks

**uberpigeon** (8): this was so sucker of her

**vayyiqra** (8): lol the sass is a nice little callback to the *Sucker* era [citation needed] 🚘

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): bratty and pretty fun

**bloodjet** (7.8): charli if you don't give a fuck then why did you said “Bitch BYE. I will NEVER understand what possesses people to be such C*NTS online” on twitter dot com

**shhhneak** (7.6): oh she came prepared for this rate.

**Aoquesth378** (7.5): I love the chorus but I'm not a big fan of the vocals or the verses.

**imbaby122** (7.5): it’s so funny how quickly she scrambled to get a song subtweeting her “toxic” fans on the deluxe version of crash. not entirely convinced that you don’t give a fuck charli <3

**impla77** (7.5): looking at my scores, i’m glad for you charli

pig-serpent: ## Haters deserve the right to an opinion too!

**scythersboots** (6.2): is this a parody of a charli song

**DaHumanTorch** (6): she wanted her cher lloyd moment so bad

**Nagisoid** (6): Can't wait for all the comments shading Charli for making a song about not caring about what others think of her, showing that she does indeed care! haha irony

**Raindrac** (6): What You Think About Me does a pretty good job of feeling laid-back without becoming a bore because of the subtle ways that they inject some energy into the song. The guitar gives the song a sort of relaxing vibe that makes me want to reflect on a peaceful day, while the beat has just enough energy that it could've been adjusted into a dance beat with just a few subtle changes. Charli's vocals do a great job at striking that balance as well, having a soft tone yet a strong enough rhythm that they pack a punch. They really nailed the vibe that the lyrics were going for. 



 Twice was a cute way to conclude the standard edition, but What You Think About Me would've actually done the job much better. It's the kind of song that would make for a good credits theme, having the feeling of reminiscing on what happened while making the intention clear. I wouldn't go back and listen to this song on repeat, but it's still a worthy inclusion on the album.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): having kim petras - alone autoplay after this song ended was such a jumpscare

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): awarded the presidential medal of honour for her service in the idgaf war

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Kids when they learn their first cuss word:

**thedoctordances1940** (5.3): I really like this bratty British girl concept in the delivery of her vocals but it does fail a bit in the execution, I don't think it's the right fit for this song, needs a more energetic song to work the best

**Ambrosia42** (5): “I will NEVER understand what possesses people to” etc. etc.

**frogaranaman** (5): she sounds so BIPPING on this

**moonshxne** (5): i don't give a fuck about this score because charli wouldn't give a fuck about whether i gave a fuck about her

**prettybirbkotori** (5): i remain unconvinced that the bonus tracks arent the same song 4 times

**sarcasticsobs** (5): I'm not huge on the verses/pre-chorus but I *really* don't like the chorus at all, despite knowing what she's going for

**shckskndv** (5): so yeah f*ck you!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): oh no she’s channeling her inner cher lloyd

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): this is very xcx world outtake core (wouldve been good in 2017)

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (4): Works as a closer.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): oh so she just gave up

**1998tweety** (3): this is not for me...

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is a dangerous question to ask after I listened to this whole album

**ktajlili** (3): yeah this one is bad too. I like that she sounds vulnerable while saying "I don't get a fuck" but it's also really childish.

**ricki** (3): this is an all time bad chorus

**runaway3212** (3): I get what she's going for but it's not hitting

**UselessTacooo** (2): fourth graders when they learn curse words

**DrumBeatGlass** (1): The way she ruined the great beat with such trashy lyrics. No wonder why I keep this song hidden

**CrimsonROSET** (0): Cher Lloyd ass song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (0): i thought she went past her teenage angst phase but clearly not!

**krusso1105** (0): this wouldn't usually be bad enough for a 0 but the rest of the rate is so strong this stands out

**ReallyCreative** (0): would it be a Charli album without a song that's needlessly REALLY annoying?

**seanderlust** (0): i truly hate the lyric "so yeah, fuck you"

**pig-serpent** (7): I'm a big fan of lower key closing tracks, especially on albums like this where the bigger songs don't hit right for me.  If more of the album sounded like this song, but maybe a little more fleshed out it'd be a classic for me.

**hikk** (5.5): Not exactly an atrocious closer but not one that is particularly memorable for me, honestly I don’t care that much for Snakeskin either so maybe Rina albums just aren’t fated to have great closers (which is too bad, because her flair for the dramatic should indicate she can do something amazing). A solid day 1 cut imo.

---

## Big fans of being alive

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ending the album on a positive note was a highly useful step towards ensuring her fans don’t fully open up their personal past-trauma

**apatel27** (10): Big Mood in Self Love

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now this one didn’t hit right away…in fact I had it deleted for a while. I get it now.

**Frajer** (10): Adam Driver in the restaurant in Marriage Story after the divorce was final

**throwaway-7650** (10): the outro is smilers as flowers slowly tanks out of the hot 100

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this is one that didnt fully click until hearing it live but like... such a powerful statement of resilience and healing

**skeeturz** (9): a perfect album closer

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.8): Ranking these tracks was a great opportunity to relisten to albums. And may I tell you, it was worth it. Hold The Girl really grew on me. First, my thoughts were mixed and I left this album without even touching it for months. Back to the song, she ended this album on a high note, what a closing track!

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes a cute closer

**jman457** (8.5): A nice Bop

**kwcty6888** (8.5): starts out strong but drags a bit

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Great closer. And it ends with a fade out let's goooo!

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8.2): Could be a good Eurovision song entry

**alexismateofan** (8): i TRULY get what it means to be alive now, ty Rina.

**AmandaYoung2083** (8): This song closes out the album really well

**Aoquesth378** (8): An epic closer to the album, it would fit in well to a movie soundtrack.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Such a triumphant closer

**phonethephoenix** (8): so true!

**vayyiqra** (8): I like how Porter Robinson and Rina coincidentally both ended an album about trauma and healing and so on with an uplifting song with a similar title, that rules 🫂

**wasian-invasion** (8): "flowers still look pretty when they're dying" on a motivational poster when

**beeozan** (7.5): Rina girl you can sing you don't need to mute the instrumental to shine

**imbaby122** (7.5): can’t wait until i relate to this song. the closest i get to this feeling is when i brush my teeth after a week long depressive episode.

**JIRACHI** (7.5): this is a grower you just had to have a few listens

**shhhneak** (7.5): The way I would eat this up if it was her Eurovision power ballad moment but here it's an alright closer.

**Ambrosia42** (7): it’s a fine closer, not really my favorite with all the other standout tracks

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she died :skull:

**ignitethephoenix** (7): oh she hit the UK garage a bit with this

**ktajlili** (7): I think this is a solid closer.

**shckskndv** (7): great credits music

**Stryxen** (7): lyrics aren’t as good as they should be for an emotional climax like this but i love these drums combined with this sound so 7s where 7s are due

## Zombies, ghouls, and other undead friends

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): this is such a meh closer compared to snakeskin

**sarcasticsobs** (6.1): Sure

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): this would place 23th in a eurovision final

**runaway3212** (6): im dead actually

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This might be the most basic uninspired closing song I've ever heard

**RandomHypnotica** (5.9): I said I forget Forgiveness exists the most on this album but I forgot this song existed when I wrote that…

**impla77** (5.7): My least favourite on the album, and a bit of a disappointing closer. I don’t like the flowers line.. so I was never going to vibe with this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): idk i have no thoughts on this whatsoever

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (5): I'm sorry Rina but I always skip this one, it's not you it's me.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): unfortunately this album had to end with a very boring cliche ending.

**Awkward\_King** (5): girl i tried to kill myself this song is not for me 💀💀💀

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (5): this is an underwhelming way to finish the album imo

**Nagisoid** (5): It's really hard to make a breakbeat track sound boring but Rina managed it and she's mother because of that

**frogaranaman** (4): doesn’t work as an album close to me

**modulum83** (4): this album has the same energy as star trek: discovery. i refuse to elaborate.

**prettybirbkotori** (4): i get wanting to end on a positive note but this is REALLY boring. this feels like the credits song on an extremely corny movie

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (4): shouldn't even be on the record tbh, just feels superfluous and corny. phantom would've been a fine closer

**UselessTacooo** (4): I REALLY WANT TO LOVE THIS BUT I CAN'T HELP THAT IT SOUNDS SO BLAH BORING AND BAD THE ONLY GOOD PART IS THE LAST MINUTE AND WHILE THAT PART IS A 10 EVERYTHING ELSE IS LIKE A 2

**akanewasright** (3): this ending with such a nothing burgers song after my favorite on the album AAAAAA WHY

**Raindrac** (3): Far too cliché to be interesting, To Be Alive is another song about finding yourself. But unlike the rest, it just doesn't hit the mark. Similar songs on Hold The Girl have all had a slight twist that made them passable, but To Be Alive just has nothing more to it. Her vocals soar, but it's not anything that I haven't heard before.

**IIIHenryIII** (2): it doesn’t sound like it

**Leixander** (2): just glad it's over

**reput4tionera** (0): sorry :/

**pig-serpent** (9): There was no universe where this song did well, and it was exactly the hard sell to a lot of people that I was expecting it to be, but Tove has a distinct, scratchy voice that's on full display on this song with minimal instrumental backing.  A bold choice for a song, and in my opinion she nailed it and helped stack this rate with crazy good ballads that are continuing to be robbed..

**hikk** (6.5): There’s part of me that appreciates Tove getting so raw like this in her vocals, it’s a pretty interesting way of showing that desperation in her voice. At the same time though, it definitely gets grating and can be a little much. I think a good middle ground here is that it’s honestly just funny how much she’s straining and groveling in this song like sis is going THRU it…. a fine cut here tbh

---

## Just Links, searching for their Zeldas

**akanewasright** (10): I’m pretty sure she just spoiled a movie I wanted to see but eh I’ll allow it for the theatrics

**alexismateofan** (10): holy absolute shit this is GOOD

**AmandaYoung2083** (10): I really love her vocals on this song

**beeozan** (10): I don't know how this goes so hard on my heartstrings yet it does. Like I could see myself hating this but I don't

**bloodjet** (10): i love her vocals in this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love the passion here, slay Tove!!!

**flava** (10): what is it about Tove Lo songs beginning with the word ‘true’ on her most underwhelming albums that make them the best songs on the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ve never thought of Tove as an especially strong vocalist but her voice really sells this one, there’s a lot of nuance and emotion in this performance that elevates the song.

**jay** (10): im screaming

**plastichaxan** (10): Maybe y’all need to see it live to hit idk

**UselessTacooo** (10): so fucking prettyyyyyyyyyyy😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

**TiltControls** (9.5): Expecting this to fall day 1, but this is such a well done ballad

**shipperondeck** (9.3): bro her voice... immaculate

**Ambrosia42** (9): the way her voice cracks and such idk it’s great. It definitely soured the mood a bit when I put this album on at a gatheration though

**cocosairdep** (9): she’s giving deranged but like in a slay way

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.5): Grower, but worth it. The storytelling is on point. Dark, dramatic and minimalistic. The vocal performance is strong and outstanding, one of the best in her whole discography

**imbaby122** (8.5): ambient synths. raw emotion. stunning vocals. i’m so enthralled by this song.

**scythersboots** (8.5): love her voice on this track

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): loooove the vibe

**Aoquesth378** (8): I'm not as much of a fan of this song but I like the vocals, storyline, and i think it works well sonically. I dont think it fit the rest of the album though.

**Awkward\_King** (8): she so dramatic,, girl have a drink take a nap youre not gonna die

**shckskndv** (8): a Moment

**shesdoingyoga** (8): The vocals!

**nick1372** (7.5): once the youtube AMV girlies find this song it's over for y'all

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): this was a weird choice of single but honestly once the buildup gets there that last minute and a half is really good

**sarcasticsobs** (7.2): Nice vocals

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): She’s really going for something here. I don’t know if she’s completely succeeding but she’s going for it!

**reput4tionera** (7): too sparse for me but damn that last chorus

**skeeturz** (7): it was okay, i can't quite put my finger on what I like about it but it just has something that i like about it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I feel like I'm listening to an acting audition

**queershoulder** (6.8): I wanted to love this one so much more than I did her voice was too good on this one but i feel like the music didn't match it

**phonethephoenix** (6.5): meh. vocal performance is good but it's kind of boring. i like the wooo near the bridge though

pig-serpent: ## If your romance is dangerous I think you're doing it wrong

**JIRACHI** (6): i feel like songs like this don't suit her at all idk

**prettybirbkotori** (6): yeah it’s pretty

**Raindrac** (6): When I first listened to True Romance, I thought that it was just another awful Tove Lo ballad— she usually can't carry them well— but something about this one is beginning to stand out. Maybe it's the minimalism of it all— how it's just a synth and her vocals throughout the entire song. It's not a very appealing song because of how overly simplistic it is, but at least it's memorable.

**Stryxen** (6): so uninteresting i love it, kinda spacey video game vibes but if you got someone on fiverr to make the soundtrack

**welcome2thejam** (6): Awesome news! I looked up "true romance joker harley" on youtube and all of the relevant results were made before this song came out!

**moonshxne** (5.7): 🏜️

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): this is boring, like so boring

**apatel27** (5): 😴

**impla77** (5): I don’t think the lyrics are good enough for a song this stripped back.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (5): sorry but this is a bit boring

**ReallyCreative** (5): ehhhh

**cashewconstellation** (4): STOP SCREECHING IN MY EAR

**ImADudeDuh** (4): at least she tried

**sharts-n-farts** (4): boring song

**thedoctordances1940** (3.6): can we get to the next song please

**DaHumanTorch** (3): someone get her some throat lozenges

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): i’m generally higher than Tove ballads than most do, but I can’t defend this one when it’s just a dour 4 minute song

**Nagisoid** (3): Tove (Lo Lo Lo)

**shhhneak** (3): Demi Lovato core.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): so are we just gonna spend four minutes of build up to absolutely nothing or

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (2): I'm sorry Tove this is a skip for me.

**oscarbrierley1** (2): she wants to be caroline polachek so bad, but shes not and thats fine. this song has no business being a full song, it should be a minute interlude.

**frogaranaman** (1): if someone told me this I’d ask them to be astronomically fr rn

**bogo** (0): literally nothing happens in this song

**ignitethephoenix** (0): “will it ever end” me listening to this song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): "i don't like the real world" people watching late 90s early 2000s MTV be like

**throwaway-7650** (0): how did caroline sneak herself on another album in this rate

## No, Charli XCX is a different artist in this rate.  Easy to make that mistake though

**CrimsonROSET** (10): isn’t that charli xcx’s gig sub fave on sub fave crime

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): it's not gonna because of balladphobia but imagine how hilarious itd be if this won. We could tell Charli that True Romance won after all her past losses and then not elaborate further

**AHSWeeknd** (9): here’s another Charli XCX comment

**thatplatypus99** (9): ended Charli

**jman457** (7.4): shots fired at charli xcx?

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): definitely my favorite charli xcx album. oh sorry, my favorite mø song. oh sorry, my favorite oh wonder song. oh sorry, my favori

**pig-serpent** (10): I’ll be honest this was my backup 11 pick.  Charli's token insecurity ballad is always the song I'm most looking forward to when she drops a new album, and Move Me does not disappoint.  It radiates comfort in a way very few songs do.  On top of that, the transition from the slower verse where the instrumental drops out and Charli starts singing in double time is my favorite moment on the entire album.  I knew it wasn’t going to do well, but I was strongly hoping it would escape the bottom 10 and it’s easily the most tasteless elimination of the day.

**hikk** (6.5): This is a cute song tbh, parts of the chorus are really nice but as a whole I do find myself forgetting about it. It’s definitely a fitting placement here among some of the other forgettable tracks of this rate.

---

## Moved

**AHSWeeknd** (10): perfect track for David Cronenberg’s CRASH

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (10): SOMETHIGNFBOUTTHEWAYYOUHOLDMYBODYTIGHTEVENONMYLOWESTNIHJT

**dreamingpastel** (10): SOMETHING 'BOUT THE WAY YOU HOLD!! MY! BODY!! TIGHT!! EVEN ON MY LOWEST NIGHT!!!

**memezaharamole** (10): underrated Crash track

**nootnoot781** (10): hearing this live was like a vaccine for the anti-cunt virus

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the underappreciated banger of the album

**reput4tionera** (10): this was my least fav song on the album when i first heard it but hearing it live made it make sense for me

**impla77** (9.6): Like chorus, verses are dull

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): one of the best blends of her more eclectic sound with the direct pop sensibilities

**nick1372** (9.5): that chorus is STICKY

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): somethin bout the way you HOLD. MY. BODY. TIGHT. EVEN ON MY LOWEST NIGHTS!!!

**bloodjet** (9): that part after the chorus when the drum stopped playing is so powerful... good song overall, feels like a continuation of hifn. also looved the chopped vocals in the last chorus!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Okay this is working for me, she can pull off sexy sometimes.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I’ve definitely slept on this song

**IIIHenryIII** (9): one of the couple of skips in an otherwise perfect album (sidenote: this rate made me change my opinion on this one; suddenly, it moved me)

**JIRACHI** (9): me when i want to be moved:

**queershoulder** (8.7): not my least favorite but, to me, it is a bit meh

**imbaby122** (8.5): forever associating this song with having a mental breakdown at the back of the charli concert bc i almost passed out in the pit before charli even came on stage lol.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): The beat coming back in on this hook feels like you’d just been jumping on the bed and everything slows down for just a moment before you land on your back in the mattress

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): The rhythm of her singing in the chorus just hits the Q-zone

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I like it a lot, it sounds like trap-ish but not as boring.

**Nagisoid** (8): Selener to Ajayll after she returned:

**phonethephoenix** (8): this is a solid song!

**prettybirbkotori** (8): the bridge is transcendental the rest of the song doesn’t matter

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Really feels like there should've been a bridge and a final chorus here but whatever. This one's pretty good.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): kinda true romance coded and for that i love it

**vayyiqra** (8): This beat is really cool! 🚘

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**akanewasright** (7.5): this is something of a snooze but it’s grown on me over time

**camerinian** (7.5): the dropout of the track to leave just Charli’s rawer vocals front and centre is such an inspired move that brings a lot to what could have been another more subdued ballad-ish track

**shipperondeck** (7.1): when she says ooooOOOOOOO

## **wasian-invasion** (6.5): we didnt move

**jman457** (6.5): The song dragged a bit but started off promising 3

**Aoquesth378** (6): Everyone I know seems to love this song but I don't understand the hype tbh. It's not bad but not as good as others. Apparently it was written for Halsey but I don't hear that tbh.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): it kinda sounds like she’s singing in front of a fan

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): sorry but this is mostly unremarkable to me

**skeeturz** (6): it's perfectly okay, it's catchy but i don't super love it

**thatplatypus99** (6): forgot this existed ngl

**UselessTacooo** (6): she is a song ☺️

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Uhhh this is meh

**welcome2thejam** (6): It's okay, though she is doing a really good job with those "everything drops out but one thing" segments in this album

**slimboyfriend** (5.4): what can I say, it’s the skip of the album

**DrumBeatGlass** (5.3): Really think the chorus doesn't hit hard enough, it's the worst part of the song. The song is kinda flat. Okay, the lyrics are fantastic here

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (5): I love the chorus.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): for a song titled ‘Move Me’ this isn’t very movable

**scythersboots** (5): the baby voice is too much

**bigbigbee** (4.5): There’s something very 2016 radio about this to me

**oscarbrierley1** (4): ehh im not mad at this one being short.

**Raindrac** (4): Well... the beat is good, I guess. Charli's vocals sound awful though, overly manipulated and lacking a good vocal melody. The lyrics are forgettable as well. The only memorable moment of Move Me is when the beat drops out during the pre-chorus, which is kinda ironic given how I think that the beat is probably the best part of the song.

**ReallyCreative** (4): well it didn't diva

**runaway3212** (4): this is so uninspired

**DaHumanTorch** (3.3): good lord this chorus is grating

**alexismateofan** (3): the chorus was so good what happened charli!!!! do something!!!!!

**apatel27** (3): defanged charli

**Leixander** (3): i remain seated

**shckskndv** (3): soppy melodrama

**thedoctordances1940** (2.7): so so so devoid of being remotely good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): this is so unbearable that its not even funny

**throwaway-7650** (2): oh that's what the "move me" melody was reminding me of... anyway britney outdid with ease on mood ring [by demand]

**beeozan** (1): this is such a mess on every front like I can’t help facepalming while listening to this

**Stryxen** (1): ew. Awkward nauseating pacing and her vocals are disgusting

**Awkward\_King** (0): this has just never done it for me, i was initially meh on it but the more i tried to like it the more it just grew off of me. it just (miss piggy voice) doesn't do it for me anymore.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): that demi lovato song from when they were 12 >>>>>>

## Charli Outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (10): ain’t this that Charli XCX song?

**bogo** (10): oh they just ended charli right here

**jasannn** (10): I’m probably the only person to submit this in my top songs of 2022 list.

**queershoulder** (10): love this one

**shckskndv** (10): idgaf I’m here to fight for this track. It’s so lovely. Waiting for a teeeeext BACK. Her harmonizations in the chorus. I feel it… f*ck. At least I made this song! All the small changes throughout… ADORABLE

**DirtyRat583** (9): wow okaayyy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): super random thought listening to this but I think Elton John & CRJ would be such a cute collab. maybe it’s the prominent piano in this song idk

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.5): She really moved us

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): ended Charli pretty badly

**alexismateofan** (8): Carly always has some great vocals, and whenever she’s featured in something, it always makes me smile because I know it’s going to be a good time.

**beeozan** (8): holding back the urge to laugh at this man's name

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is cute

**Frajer** (8): I kinda just want to listen to I Feel The Earth Move now

**phonethephoenix** (8): I didn't think much of this song when it came out but this is clicking more now!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Charli cleared

**impla77** (7.4): ok the instrumental solo was really cool but the rest is just meh

**sarcasticsobs** (7.1): It's fine I guess. Oh wait, I like the solo, go back to that

**ktajlili** (7): cute

**jman457** (6.7): When is Charli gonna have a song called Run away with me

**shipperondeck** (6.5): lewis seems like a nice guy

## Shoot I already said "Nobody moved."  Uh.  Everybody stood still.  Nailed it

**akanewasright** (6): oh this exists I guess

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): it's fine, but boring.

**Aoquesth378** (6): It's a decent song but not really for me.

**imbaby122** (6): this song kind of came out of nowhere. that janky piano kind of has jessie ware energy but not as good.

**Nagisoid** (6): This title is actually an abstract masterpiece because I didn't move

**nick1372** (6): this is fun but the melody is kind of cloying it's trying too hard and misses the smooth confidence of most good Carly songs

**skeeturz** (6): it's perfectly serviceable but it's not my cup of tea

**Stryxen** (6): really good considering the french

**hakkerj** (5.7): Charli outsold

**prettybirbkotori** (5.5): this is the first carly song in like 8 years that i haven’t been that into. and this is coming from someone who likes her gryffin collab and lalala remix

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (5): why do ofmen…

**cashewconstellation** (5): Lewis stripping during his opener set for Carly being the most interesting thing about his music

**reput4tionera** (5): i had a premonition that this was on a starbucks corporate playlist and turns out it isn’t! it’s on H&M’s

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): im so completely uninterested in everything about this

**wasian-invasion** (5): This guy doesnt even have a wikipedia page

**runaway3212** (4): even more boringcore

**seanderlust** (4): carly better win the main rate for how mid of an entry her bonus song is

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (4): just sort of boring besides the instrumental breakdown, which is admittedly pretty sick

**Ambrosia42** (3.5): I do not like these vocals from this Lewis OfMan person I am sorry

**thedoctordances1940** (3.2): I was happier when I didn't know this song existed. Luckily I will have probably returned to that state of mind by about mid-June

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (3): I'm normally a sucker for a good piano track but it wasn't for me. More Carly, I say!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): We should all take out our misandry on THIS Carly/Man collab! This one!

**DaHumanTorch** (3): oh that's not-

**UselessTacooo** (3): dollar tree musical number

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): almost as bad as charli's ou

**IIIHenryIII** (2): stop featuring Carly on shitty songs

**Awkward\_King** (1): ive never heard this song before wtf is this :sob::sob:

**pig-serpent** (8): Good News: Carly finally lost a song! Bad News: It’s one of her best ones.  No joking, I think this is Carly’s best slow song and her best bonus track.  It’s one of the only few slower songs I find myself singing and the instrumentation is gorgeously ethereal (even with the slide whistles XD.)  Just another day 1 robbery for the pile.

**hikk** (5): After Anxious makes a strong case for being deserving of an actual album placement, this song does the opposite. The flute is nice but other than that I really struggle to find anything interesting about it. After plenty of cuts from everyone else it’s Carly’s first, which makes sense since it’s hard to say anything on her album is truly bad, the worst it gets is boring and forgettable - like this.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): donkey kong country water levels vibes

**kwcty6888** (7): hot take but I could’ve done without the bonus tracks

**vayyiqra** (6): Me not doing my ballot over the weekend! (I was out of town sorry hosties it was quite a chaotic time I spent all night getting back home and at one point napped on a bench) 🍐

**jman457** (5.6): nice production elements but this sounds like a bonus track

**nick1372** (5): maybe I don't get it because I'm not an astrology gay

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): Kinda surprised this one didn't end with a fade out tbh

**runaway3212** (5): her making this song

**skeeturz** (5): it's a perfectly serviceable track but it doesn't get evoke anything particularly strong from me

**UselessTacooo** (5): melatonin personified

**thedoctordances1940** (4.2): me doing this rate on the weekend

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I honestly can’t believe I don’t like another song by Carly

**JIRACHI** (4): giving this a 4 for the 4 minutes i wasted listening to this

**ktajlili** (4): Zzzz

**Raindrac** (4): These synths sound smooth, reminding me of listening to the theme of the Riverside Station while watching the sunset in Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. Considering the lyrics of the song, that's a pretty apt thing to remind me of. It looks like they did a good job nailing the aesthetic! Unfortunately, that's all that I really enjoy about the song. It's not really enough to draw me back.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): coincidentally im not thinking about anything when i listen to this song

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): This is the one song on the album I can't get into

**uberpigeon** (3): the girls are not sending their best for these bonus tracks

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (1): I skip this every time.

**Awkward\_King** (1): we have now i don't hate california after all at home now i don't hate california after all at home:

**wasian-invasion** (0): yachtcore

**pig-serpent** (7): A fairly small intro song that sets the tone for the album.  It’s certainly not a song I seek out or have major feelings about, but I think it’s good and see why it had a few hardcore supporters.  Y’all put up the good fight getting this song this far.

**hikk** (5): This is nothing special for me, but it would be worse if it weren’t the album intro I think. As an introductory track it works ok even if I never see any reason to come back to it, so at least it has that going for it, but more than anything I’m just uninterested here and it sets the tone for a lot of tracks on this album that aren’t appealing to me… so I’m okay with it leaving day 1 for sure.

---

## Sees a therapist.  In touch with their feelings.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is how you emotionally prepare the listener for this sort of an album. Rina is a genius

**alexismateofan** (10): like a legit fucking masterpiece on the album

**apatel27** (10): Big Mood in Acceptable Racism

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is such a beautiful album opener, where dynasty is grand and explosive this is calm and welcoming and honest and i think that works so much better for this album, it's not the massive statement piece sawayama was, it's intimate and intrusive even. "dreaming of the day i'm tall enough to save myself" is one of my favourite rina lyrics too, it's just such a brilliant painting of a buildup of childhood trauma you try and bury

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me and the like 3 other people who 10 this are you ready to flop???

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Fantastic opening to the album and the themes of growing up and feeling put out.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): she got me sobbing right from the very beginning and then she threw all my emotions in the trash can

**JIRACHI** (10): would've been a 11 if it was longer honestly...

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the introphobia should NOT apply to this like please pin the tail on the taste

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): the first time i heard that "all my life i felt out of place" i started crying HARD. hearing it live also had me bawling in the crowd. listening to it casually STILL makes me cry a lot of the time like that's power

**throwaway-7650** (9.7): the non-POC raters using their 0s on this are going to hell

**Aoquesth378** (9): heavy hitting song and I love how it opens the album. The production is captivating and the lyrics are on point. Plus I love the transition

**plastichaxan** (9): This grew on me so much since release I’m sorry I didn’t pay attention to you

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Excellent album opener. Would've loved an extended version.

**queershoulder** (9): beautiful

**reput4tionera** (9): this is how you do an intro

**moonshxne** (8.7): such a potent opener that just tugs at my heartstrings

**flava** (8.5): excellent intro that sets the tone of the album, especially with those heavy plucks of the guitar and what sounds like church bells in the distance under the rain as the song ends setting up this album’s themes of disillusionment with religion as either being far away or

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): a bit short but it's a good album opener

**Ambrosia42** (8): it’s a great intro, but not a standout track

**bloodjet** (8): great set up for the album's themes

**DrumBeatGlass** (8): I don't really consider this a full song, more like an intro, a beautiful one

**ImADudeDuh** (8): good intro

**jay** (8): floating a bit.. wig was tugged a lil

**sarcasticsobs** (8): : (

**seanderlust** (8): the minor-to-major shift on minor feelings are majorly breaking me down??? her mind

**shesdoingyoga** (8): A cute cinematic opener

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): love the concept of the song. somewhat unexciting in execution, but still a good intro to the themes of the album

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): a good intro but not a standout

**1998tweety** (7): shes a cute opener

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): God I love this as an opener, but doesn't play as well out of context.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): I like this an opening song, but yeah, it's just an intro.

**bookthieving** (7): “Theresa Hak Kyung Cha writes, 'Arrest the machine that purports to employ democracy but rather causes the successive refraction of her.” The most damaging legacy of the West has been its power to decide who our enemies are, turning us not only against our own people, like North and South Korea, but turning me against myself.'" - Cathy Park Hong, *Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning*

**camerinian** (7): good of rina to get the obligatory interlude flop out of the way nice and early

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this OPENS the album??? Oh she set herself up

**impla77** (7): We love a heavy handed yet earnest intro. This was the opening song for the tour and it sets things up nicely

**ktajlili** (7): nasally vocals aside, I think this is a good opener. Really introduces the themes of the album very well.

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (7): great intro but can't really give this a higher rating as it's barely even a song

**ReallyCreative** (7): feels more interludey than intro-y but alright

**skeeturz** (7): it's a decent opener and sets the tone for the purpose of the album

**slimboyfriend** (7): amazing but also should be more than just a verse a pre chorus and a chorus

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): one thing about rina is that she is always gonna serve with her album openers. ok well maybe this isnt a “slay” but its still really pretty

**jman457** (6.7): nice little set up for the album

pig-serpent: ## Ignores things that bother them.  Doesn't admit they have feelings.

**nick1372** (6.5): I totally get what she's going for but an album with such blatant themes like this does not need an intro track. There's something interesting here with her identity as a Queer Asian woman and how she's minimized her own feelings but it's buried by the corny chorus about how it's "majorly getting to her now".

**Raindrac** (6.5): Pretty good intro to the album, although somewhat forgettable. "All of these minor feelings are majorly breaking me down" is a clever line.

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): i dont know a thing about music theory but i imagine this would sound funny in a major key

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): she lowkey sounds like dua lipa here

**imbaby122** (6): me when i have feelings (bc i’m a minor)(i’m actually 19)(but i’m a minor until i declare otherwise)(idgaf what biology or the law says)

**prettybirbkotori** (6): it’s got some cool production but i’ve never felt a reason to come back to it

**runaway3212** (6): kinda a boring opener that introduces the theming fine but not like great

**scythersboots** (6): idk i didn’t want to like it but the subject is v close to home

**shckskndv** (6): a good intro. I feel her pain!

**uberpigeon** (6): "all these minor feelings are majorly getting to me now" girl... i know she felt so smart writing that

**vayyiqra** (6): pretty 🫂

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Rina… I love you but… okay

**welcome2thejam** (6): Very solid intro

**bigbigbee** (5): Rina pours our her heart about a lifetime of holding back and how it’s emotionally affected her Me: sighs loudly, makes an obvious glance at my watch, mouths “this guy” to a passerby

**Stryxen** (5): i think this might be the most average song i’ve ever heard. Her vocals sound so good at least

**thatplatypus99** (5): describes my overall relationship to this album

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): I mean I can't be too harsh on this because it kinda sounds pretty cool ig but it's just an intro track that doesn't really stand on its own

**akanewasright** (4): happy for the people who like this, but “all these minor feelings are majorly breaking me down” is a lame ass lyric and there’s nothing else here that’s remarkable at all. She sounds nice as usual I guess

**beeozan** (4): i aint lookin at genius, happy for u or sorry that happend

**cremeebrulee** (4): wonder if cathy park hong knows about this song

**oscarbrierley1** (3): it was a great opener for the concert, but its such a boring song

**dreamingpastel** (2): Not a huge fan of the whole minor/major wordplay. It feels less like wordplay and more like "banging the words into my skull so I know what you mean the first time around"

**modulum83** (0): (the theater kid that has kidnapped me) My favorite album of 2022 is hold the girl. Its rinas most personal album yet that girl WENT to therapy [I try to stand up and am pushed back into my chair by the guard] No you’re going to listen to all of this

**Nagisoid** (0): This is like Dynasty if you took literally everything good from it, like this belongs in an alternative universe where Bebe Rexha is a main flop girl that gets 5k upvotes in r/popheads and charts at #85 in the UK Charts and Rina Sawayama gets made fun of for sampling Darude - Sandstorm in her #1 hit "I'm Sand (Dee Dee Dee)"

**RandomHypnotica** (0): rina doing her best madison beer album track impression here

**hikk** (6.5): Honestly relistening to this now I should have lowered my score because it’s sounding more awkward and clunky than I remember. The beat is plodding and the melodies are all over the place, maybe that’s the point but it just sounds a bit odd to me, especially after a very strong opening trio of tracks. The man doing that thing isn’t really necessary either. Definitely fine with it being her second song out

**pig-serpent** (4): I can't say this song does much for me, even though there are a few really cool moments in the production, like the squealing that happens right before and after the last chorus.  It’s a shame that a song this mid escaped the bottom 10, and outlived much better songs from Charli and Tove Lo.  And herself for that matter.

## In a land, Far Far Away

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Carly committing to the concept of this album with each song is pop icon behaviour

**kappyko** (10): This is for those that understood Now I Don’t Hate California After All

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): it just kinda eats idk

**bigbigbee** (9.5): This gives me “90s family film soundtrack” and I’m all about it

**queershoulder** (9.5): something so nice about this song

**alexismateofan** (9): It’s such a chill song, and it really fits nicely on the album here.

**prettybirbkotori** (9): i’m usually not as big of a fan of her slower songs but i come back to this one a lot

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (8.9): relatable fr actually

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): she really likes songs with the word "away" in the title huh

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (8.5): this might just be me being dumb but Carly having Far Away, Keep Away, Stay Away, Felt this Way, Run Away With Me... I'm bad enough at remembering song names as it is this isn't helping!!!

**phonethephoenix** (8.4): chill vibes! classic carly refrain

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): something about the verses is a bit too... verbose for the rhythm but conversely the rhythm is soo good

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I too want to be loved carly!! unless the words you want involve getting a top100 hit again in which case i can’t relate but gl with tiktok

**DrumBeatGlass** (8): The atmosphere is just pure gold. Again, the length is disappointing

**imbaby122** (8): the bridge is kind of giving this generation’s kate bush.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Groovin'

**seanderlust** (8): not to be "guy who has only heard phil collins" but getting some phil collins vibes from this

**vayyiqra** (8): The sound of most of this album really doesn't fit the cover art huh 🍐

**wasian-invasion** (8): wow she really went for the Stay/Far/Keep Away trinity

**bloodjet** (7.8): i always thought this song is kinda forgettable but it's actually kinda cute.. like a breeze of fresh air when it's playing

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): men is so disrespectful, let her sing

**jman457** (7.5): The bridge kind of made this

**impla77** (7.3): I’m sure the feet not being on the ground is a metaphor but it always conjures some literal imagery for me!!

**Stryxen** (7.2): i LOVE a run on sentence chorus

**akanewasright** (7): 100% filler but idk I’ll let it stay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is good but…honestly…truly…and I mean this sincerely…Nickelback did it better.

**dreamingpastel** (7): Why does this remind me of The Lion King

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like the way that this is built around that drum kick, gives the track a unique vibe for Carly, but the actual melody leaves a bit to be desired.

**jasannn** (7): dedicated cut

**ktajlili** (7): this is kind of a grower, but it's like super nice and chill. I am admiring your qUalItiEs

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): far away, keep away, stay away like damn no wonder it's the loneliest time!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pretty but uh I kinda forgot I was listening to it

## In THE land of Far, Far Away

**camerinian** (6.5): i’m gonna be writing “cute” and nothing more a lot for this album aren’t I

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): it’s fine

**Raindrac** (6.5): The drumming on this song sounds really good, I'm impressed. Far Away didn't capture my attention on the first listen because I wasn't paying attention to the drums, but now that I've noticed them, I'm actually enjoying this song. It's amazing how noticing just one instrument can change your perspective on a song.

**Aoquesth378** (6): I like the song a lot but for some reason I'm not in love with the vocals for it. It is also a very mellow song which isnt bad by itself but it borders on boring to me.

**JIRACHI** (6): i did not really care for this

**Leixander** (6): putting this right after Talking To Yourself is the second war crime she committed (first one is Heartbeat right after This Is What They Say in Dedicated Side B)

**Nagisoid** (6): Everything in Texas:

**RandomHypnotica** (6): covid safe queen

**scythersboots** (6): this song sounds old and tbh a little stale

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): why does the beginning of this song sound like the pornhub intro

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (5): The bridge is sooo good and that's carrying the whole score.

**Awkward\_King** (5): stay away... felt this way... keep away... far away.... theres no way

**jay** (5): okay..

**plastichaxan** (5): Shrek when he went to visit Fiona’s parents

**skeeturz** (5): it's a perfectly okay track i don't hate or love it

**UselessTacooo** (4.5): omg solar power I luuuuuuv uuuuuu

**bogo** (4): these verses are not sticking with me at all, they’re not catchy at all

**oscarbrierley1** (4): this song reminds me of far by sza in that i finish listening to it and immediately forget what it sounds like.

**reput4tionera** (4): next

**runaway3212** (4): this nothing song

**shckskndv** (4): losing the fight for second place in the “___ Away” trilogy

**cremeebrulee** (3.3): the way she is obsessed with putting a “way” in her song titles

**aldwin\_is\_here** (0): unfortunately, this album has a single dud song and it's the redundant sequel to my favorite song from her discography, (it's Summer Love.)

**hikk** (8): I like this tbh, a lot of people seem to criticize it for being very on the nose but I think that’s something that allows it to stand out, it’s a pretty unique topic. It does a good job of melding the Tove Lo persona we’ve come to know over her past albums with her new life as a married woman, fully being in commitment to her partner but also admitting to not wanting to change who she is to fit the stereotypical mould of a wife, which is in line with the often hedonistic tones of her older music. It could be more sonically interesting but I think it’s a neat track regardless. It’s not one of the album’s top standouts but this might be a little harsh for it imo.

**pig-serpent** (7): This is just Hall and Oates' Maneater with the lyrics of "She Wants a Baby" by Hobo Johnson.  I still think it’s a lot of fun, but it’s probably the weakest song on the front half of the album so I’m not too upset about it being cut a little early.

---

## They fucking hate this town.  They want to burn it down!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She referred to the baby as “them”, queen of understanding gender as a social construct

**plastichaxan** (10): Let them KNOWWWW

**runaway3212** (10): fuck suburbs honestly

**throwaway-7650** (10): stanford wife? (edit: not stanford's founder's wife MURDERED...)

**shipperondeck** (9.7): played this on loop while crying over my bf once. anyway now hes my ex

**Ambrosia42** (9.4): Especially growing up as a queer person, you kind of realize that all the ideals of heteronormative society don’t make sense. But sometimes when you fall in love, you do end up wanting some of those things you never thought you would. Idk it’s a cool perspective and I appreciate there being a song like this

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (9): I love this one and it pointed me to the Stepford Wives! #literacylegend

**alexismateofan** (9): If desperate housewives came out this year, this would be its theme song.

**DirtyRat583** (9): tove. why is the bass this thick. you could not play this song in suburbia without 18 noise complaints. its literally distorting girl explain yourself

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): the sentiment expressed in this song is definitely one of the most interesting in this album, and one that i resonate with! it says a lot about Tove’s songwriting talent when she manages to include ‘Mom-Olympic’ seamlessly in a song.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): my mindset in a nutshell

**nick1372** (9): novelty of song topic turns this from a basic pop song into a total banger

**ReallyCreative** (9): END car-centric infrastructure exactly queen

**vayyiqra** (9): pensive ... keep thinking I kind of want children and worried about getting too old ... [mostly joking] maybe I should call her ... no ... but what if ... sad ... ♀️

**Aoquesth378** (8.5): This song really hits home for me with a lot of my thoughts and feelings about marriage and a family. It also taught me what pedantic means, which is nice.

**camerinian** (8.5): the “i won’t be a housewife ok” thing used to be such a ridiculous notion for pop singers cos it was like the epitome of “no one asked” but frankly in the current day it comes off as anti-tradwife and that’s both rad and depressing as hell

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): for whatever reason this song reminds me of Maneater by Hall & Oates

**1998tweety** (8): ended arcade fire

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I like it but unfortunately, I don't have a family-man breeding kink but other than that it's a great song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): A little something for the girlies who don’t want to reproduce!

**lordofthepotat0** (8): i will also not be on the mom olympic team (im guy

**phonethephoenix** (7.8): maybe a bit on the nose but like fair! synths:)

**jman457** (7.7): Like the lyrics

**queershoulder** (7.7): relatable

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): evil rihanna be like:

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): she is so real for this

**JIRACHI** (7.5): what even is a stepford wife

**CrimsonROSET** (7): god I wish this went faster

**impla77** (7): Stepford wives is still feeding the girlies after all these years

**modulum83** (7): pet shop boys outsold

**Nagisoid** (7): Arcade Fire were ended (literally)

**sarcasticsobs** (7): kinda in one ear, out the other, but not bad

**skeeturz** (7): it's a cute song!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Omg numtot anthem!

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (6.7): she never wanted babies (she knows they’re kinda cute!!)

=====

pig-serpent: ## If they die, they want to die in the suburbs

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): she watched Harry's acting in Don't Worry Darling and said no thank you suburbs

**babadork** (6.1): It being addressed to the guy doesn’t work for me. I think it makes the lyrics a little unfocused.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Tove said “I’m not a stepford wife, I’m your faaanntasy”

**imbaby122** (6): yk i kind of have the same worries but i would never write a song about them and that makes me cringe a bit.

**Leixander** (6): tove lo against traditional family values tm could've bopped better 😔

**oscarbrierley1** (6): lyrics on the verge between real and mundane

**prettybirbkotori** (6): she’s so real for this one but it’s a bit shallow

**seanderlust** (6): "will you be less pedantic"?? why did she drag him out of nowhere

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): the way she says Stepford Wife reminds me of Derrick Barry in the Rectangle Girls of the World song

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): i like this song sonically, but the lyrics are questionable at best

**DrumBeatGlass** (5.5): The more I listen to her songs, the more I think she makes the music exclusively for her fans that fell in love with this kind of production. So this song is the same until the last chorus, too late to save the song

**shhhneak** (5.4): Fck them kids and fck you too!

**apatel27** (5): Ad music

**bogo** (5): ok

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): look I simply can’t get this one because I love stability and really want kids one day

**Stryxen** (5): derivative and forgettable but still my kind of landfill synth pop i can’t dislike it

**UselessTacooo** (5): If there’s one thing wrong with Tove it’s that she CANNOT be subtle. The blunt storytelling leaves no room for the imagination it makes the track feel awkwardly corny

**akanewasright** (4.5): This grew on me after seeing her live but it’s still easily one of the worst things here

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): these lyrics are so on the nose she lucky this bops

**flava** (4): a beat so uninspired it’s almost aspirational [2] but it’s at the lyrical content is more interesting

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): /r/childfree anthem

**moonshxne** (4): I actually heard the lyrics here! Which, given the sparse production, was clearly the intention. But, arguably to the song's detriment: they're easily relatable, if not conceptually compelling, but are just written so banally that it comes off as juvenile. Honestly, the lyrics along with certain production choices kind of gives the entire track a *Don't Worry Darling*-lite sheen so

**reput4tionera** (4): why did the swing randomly stop in the bridge

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): do you think tove lo browses r/childfree

**shckskndv** (3): Electra Heart core

**Raindrac** (2): I really don't have much to say about this one. It's just extremely boring, and it lacks any sort of interesting hook.

**cremeebrulee** (1): this wants to be an electra heart cut so bad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): hate that the chorus of this is a bit similar to Hall and Oates - Maneater. Don’t like this song at all, very clunky.

**cocosairdep** (0): we have electra heart at home

**hikk** (5.5): yeah, the elephant in the room is the la la la la la…. she has a bad habit of over utilizing these sort of “lyrics” as filler through the whole album and I think this is the worst example of it because it stands out so much since she gets some rando to sing it. Outside of that this is a cute little track and she sells the sugary sweet love affair very well (god i wish that were me) but it feels very forgettable amongst the rest, and tbh it’s very odd that she decided to name her tour after it! Don’t be shy Carly do another tour for the actual album this time and please come to my city

**pig-serpent** (5): Finally.  This is giving Hallmark movie where a guy goes to visit his crush's Winterwonderland show and this is the song she performs while dressed in a modest, but still sexy santa costume.  I can't say I understand where I'm getting this image from, but I guess my brain needs to picture something while listening to this extremely fine song.  I would’ve liked to see this go out sooner.

---

## Nice! (means it)

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Sometimes simplicity is the most striking thing, the lyrics of this song are so straightforward and almost conversational but they really capture the contented lovestruck tone that she’s going for (which is where Carly is the strongest). I think this is one of the most authentic representations of being in love that I’ve heard in a long time and I keep coming back to it.

**kappyko** (11): Feeling like a crazy person explaining why this is her best song like please carly just drop the carly cut where ur the one singing the la la la part so everyone realizes how good this is This is for the Lets Sort the Whole Thing Out stans PLEASE BELIEVE ME Also i listened to this song while walking all the way to a movie and crushing on a guy i kinda hate now sooooooo

**Leixander** (10): HE'S MY CUP OF TEA! SUGAR ON MY SWEET!

**nick1372** (10): ended all incels everywhere

**wasian-invasion** (10): my boyfriend came up with a cute little dance for this one so i have to give it a 10

**notarobot3675** (9.8): i think this is my stealth fave of the album - objectively i know its not the best but whenever this song comes on shuffle i have to play it nine million times on repeat or else ill die

**jasannn** (9.5): I will be defender of the lalalala’s. It’s kind of a jumpscare at first but it gives the song a bit of lovey dovey cheese like in Sideways. A favorite part of mine is when it transitions to Carly’s sweet lalalala’s and that makes it worth it

**prettybirbkotori** (9.5): gets an extra .5 just for the ‘i love you’ in the background it’s SO CUTE!! this is music for fun people if you don’t like it that’s on you

**akanewasright** (9): the lalalalas add flavor even if the flavor is a little nasty idk

**alexismateofan** (9): When carly does a sweet love song I know that I'm in the right place and time and headspace. It’s definitely so nice

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I like the dumbass la la la’s idc

**just\_thonking** (9): It would get a 10 if I didn't find the "la la la"s slightly annoying

**ReallyCreative** (9): we love a song that matches the title

**phonethephoenix** (8.9): this song is!

**Ambrosia42** (8.5): a vibe

**bigbigbee** (8.5): This reminds me of like Korean café music in a good way

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): dont like the "la la la"s they used. another one probably wouldve been ok (a.k.a. a 9 or 10) but not this one

**TiltControls** (8.5): this album

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): knocking off a point for naming a tour after this and then NOT performing it even when she was previewing tracks before the album release but also this song IS so nice and v cute

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this sounds like a dedicated track that got left behind

**dreamingpastel** (8): Song title says it all.

**JIRACHI** (8): this is cute i like it

**jman457** (8): Groovy little track

**RandomHypnotica** (8): me constantly appearing in the top 10 rate averages:

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This is a cute song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I think one of my favorite genres of love song is women singing passionately and lovingly whilst also describing their men in the most basic-ass nondescript way… Like yes you go girl and your flavorless boyfriend!

**plastichaxan** (7.8): Me about this song

**luckyphase** (7.7): this isn't shade but it sounds like a well executed kpop b-side... like, this is what some of them were trying to do

**beeozan** (7.5): the last minute is such a 10 but it comes with baggage

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.5): there’s something very Dedicated-side-B-core (complimentary) about this

**queershoulder** (7.5): my least favorite from the album

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): Noice. Love the instrumental bridge despite not really digging the rest

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): okayyy slap bass

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): the beat is funky but everything else is so meh

**babadork** (7.1): I don’t dislike this song, but it’s the one I’d bump to make room for Anxious.

**impla77** (7.1): this ones for the nice guys

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the intro ain’t it

**Aoquesth378** (7): I love the simple and clean production as well as the overall sound, but lyrically I think this is the worst song on the album

**DrumBeatGlass** (7): Similar to Sideways, but with more punch and more memorable parts (the lalala part for example)

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): a little too nice

**kwcty6888** (7): not so nice

**shckskndv** (7): I feel like her vocals are a little more Soulful than she usually is.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): i like this song and it's v cute but i have to dock points for how goofy the "i love you" sounds lol

**vayyiqra** (7): NICE! 🍐

**welcome2thejam** (7): Insert Taylor Swift Bejeweled "Nice!" sound effect here

**shhhneak** (6.8): She’s so Sandra Dee.

pig-serpent: ## Nice! (Doesn't mean it)

**bloodjet** (6.5): kinda too sweet for its own good. also docking a point cause i hate the la la las in this

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): what a lie

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I wouldn’t describe someone who’s incredibly honest as “so nice”

**runaway3212** (6.1): nice next to gorgeous

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): if she harmonized the guy's voice saying "lalalala" with her voice, (or simply remove it), it would've been perfect as fuck.

**imbaby122** (6): so 😭 happy 😭 for 😭 you 😭 carly 😭😭😭😭🖕😭😭

**Stryxen** (6): definitely bottom 1 but i still like it. The la la la la las are so annoying tho

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): so mid... incredibly honest...

**uberpigeon** (5.7): something to play for your grandma

**UselessTacooo** (5.5): La La laalalalalalaaaaaaa

**apatel27** (5): So Nice for What?

**DaHumanTorch** (5): definitely one of the weakest on the album for me, but not bad! kind of just there

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): those backing vocals are TERRIBLE. I’m throwing tomatoes at them. The rest is lovely.

**Nagisoid** (5): [insert ironic snark about the title]

**Raindrac** (5): There's a little bit of funk in this song that I appreciate, and Carly's vocals are as sugary soft as ever, but the chorus is lacking something and the la-la-las that make up the post-chorus sound like nothing more than filler. It needs a little bit more to it.

**skeeturz** (5): another song i don't hate or particularly like. it's just okay

**scythersboots** (4.8): corny, v. canadian, maybe

**bogo** (4): is this chorus trying to be camp or cutesy or something cause it’s not working

**bookthieving** (4): not carly validating nice guys

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): the “la la las” here i find annoying

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (3): I just couldn't connect.

**Awkward\_King** (3): i think one of the reasons this album doesn't hit for me is a lot because me and carly just want different things out of our men

**camerinian** (3): these backing vocals suck. Straight up ruin a track that would otherwise be slightly above “cute” with the actual real solid yacht rock funk backing

**thedoctordances1940** (2.8): the guitars in this song just evoke a visceral negative reaction in me, rotten cherry on the top of a bland and boring hook

**buddhacharm** (1): This song is tainted by its association with a former situationship who tried to convince me that this song is good. It's SO bad

**memezaharamole** (1): this is nice in the way that I would say 'nice.' to end a conversation I don't want to be in, I'm sorry.

Here we see Charli invoking the spirit of legends like Rebecca Black and the Black Eyed Peas by having whole sections of lyrics devoted to naming the days of the week which idk it’s funny to me idc…

## You've got what I neeeeed

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it’s like learning about the days of the week in preschool but the teacher is on acid

**Leixander** (10): we love a good breakdown song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "I broke down in Paris" me too tf!? [note: I have never been to Europe]

**reput4tionera** (10): hot take why doesn’t the week start with monday. sunday does not feel like the first day of the week. let’s talk about that

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Wtf George Daniel beats just hitting so right for me

**thatplatypus99** (10): she’s listing off the days of the week that I stream this song

**dreamingpastel** (9.5): Starts off pretty great, but I don't know how to feel about the chorus. I don't hate it, but the whole "Sunday Monday Tuesday", etc. part doesn't really hit the way the verses and prechorus do.

**bloodjet** (9): lol why did i ignored the deluxe tracks they are SO GOOD and better than some album tracks

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): she's a menace for tucking the most interesting interpolation in the bonus tracks i cant stand her ass sometimes

**JIRACHI** (9): that chorus is so fun and camp i love it

**kappyko** (9): MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY FRIDAY SATURDAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY

**ktajlili** (8.7): yeah this is so good.

**1998tweety** (8.5): now why wasnt this on the standard version

**impla77** (8.5): why are the bonus songs better

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): this might be my fav George-produced song rn. i like the tempo?

**beeozan** (8): charli saving all the bops to deluxe

**bigbigbee** (8): Latin Girl, Mexican Girl, Korean Girl, Japan Girl! MONDAY, TUESDAY! WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY! Friday Saturday Sunday. MAZEL TOV!

**bogo** (8): idk girl i’m not your therapist, idk what i want half the time

**camerinian** (8): a-tier title and verses paired with a c-tier hook. Babe could you have not just finished the job

**imbaby122** (8): me when the days of the week

**nick1372** (8): rebecca black found dead in a ditch

**shckskndv** (8): please listen to Saturday Love by Cherelle!

**skeeturz** (8): simple in theory but dirty infectious at it's core, queen of teaching me the days of the week

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): obsessed with this horrible song title

**wasian-invasion** (8): there are seven days there are seven days there are seven days of the week

**shhhneak** (7.9): How did this NOT get a Rebecca Black feat?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.8): rebecca black: That sounds... does that sound familiar to you? Cause that sound really familiar to me!!

**Ambrosia42** (7.5): Oh you get me through those Monday blues

**lexiaredery** (7.5): I can't decide if the listing the days of the week actually annoys me

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): queen of naming the days of the week

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): why are these deluxe tracks outselling the main album so hard 😭

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): mazeltov monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday sunday latin girl mexican girl korean girl

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): her Rebecca Black slay

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): we love learning the days of the week

**Aoquesth378** (7): This song feels so chaotic and all over the place to me but I'm still into it.

**jasannn** (7): Rebecca Black better watch her back

**Nagisoid** (7): Not the blatant Weeknd interpolation... her ass will be in court

**Raindrac** (7): The lyrics of the chorus are nothing more than singing the days of the week, but I don't care! It makes me bop my head, and that's what matters. The soft texture of her vocals works really well too, she needs to sing like that more often. Also, the jittery vocals in the outro are probably the best utilization of vocal manipulation on the entire album. It's the only moment where they managed to recreate the magic of Pop 2.

**TiltControls** (7): why does any succession of short capitalized words read like a jaden smith tweet

## Charli has recently come out as someone with early onset dementia

**DrumBeatGlass** (6.5): She really knows what she wants, I love the confident lyrics. Could've been better without the Rebecca Black moment. Too short

**seanderlust** (6.5): this chorus line runs through my head every time i think of the days of the week now

**Stryxen** (6.5): what she needs is to log out of twitter

**uberpigeon** (6.5): she wants to be rebecca black so bad

**Awkward\_King** (6): i love the verses of this but the chorus just feels like a cheaper version of the sunship remix of 7 days by craig david, which i grew up on a little because my older sister had a big garage phase

**CrimsonROSET** (6): hope you’re doing well Charli x

**DirtyRat583** (6): why the long ass title. Did You Know That I Know The Days Of The Week

**just\_thonking** (6): Friday vibes

**plastichaxan** (6): I never know what I need you could try just being unstable

**prettybirbkotori** (6): man i miss how im feeling now

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Girl… no. You are better than this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): I don't want to be reminded of all the days I have to endure school, so I give it a bearable score.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): okay so story time: i'm in another community that run contests based on Eurovision (like the Worldvision rates that was run here) - and somebody sent this song for Uganda and then threw a tantrum, rage quitted and left the Discord server it didn't qualify for the final?? like damn you didn't need to do all that for such a mid song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): sorry did she just list the days of the week, um

**Lost-ln-the-Echo** (5): the bonus tracks on this album just feel like filler to me, nothing memorable

**cremeebrulee** (4.3): we did not need the days of the week lesson 💔

**IIIHenryIII** (4): esl teachers around the world should all be aware of the existence of this song

**jman457** (4): This sounds like a P*rt*r R*binson song. Yes im still bitter from Last year sub favs rate

**lordofthepotat0** (4): its friday friday gotta get down on friday

**runaway3212** (4): the chorus im fucking dying

**vayyiqra** (4): Cool beat but list songs are bad 🚘

**alexismateofan** (3): spelling is fun is over now learn your days of the week

**MasterWizardRyan** (3): this applies to every bonus CRASH song because we were better off not hearing it

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (2): Not what I needed.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): and here i thought Cry For You was the most useless sample on the album

**thedoctordances1940** (1): laughably bad chorus. I mean I appreciate the sentiment of the song but that chorus is so so bad

**UselessTacooo** (0): Kindergarten teacher side hustle? maybe it’s been Charli poor all along

oscarbrierley1: Yall just don't get it, this was the Janet Jackson vibes that she promised before the albums release. The days of the week chorus is an interpolation of the Iconic Saturday Love by Cherelle which was written and produced by Janet's producers jam and lewis.

**hikk** (8): The production here is so good, a really fun 2-step beat that feels better executed than Rina’s attempts at it on her album. It could maybe be equipped with some catchier energy in the chorus but it’s still a really good track and I could see it easily replacing some of the standard tracks. I thought this could have made day 2 but it appears not!

**pig-serpent** (5): Easily the most bonus track of the bonus track.  That is to say, it's completely inessential and completely inoffensive in equal measures.  It seems like this was a popular opinion, but there are a few diehard fans of this song who are screaming right now, and I would’ve liked to see this do a little better for their sake.

---

## They want everything designer

**Awkward\_King** (11): creme said this was bad friend by rina in a different font and my entire worldview changed. anyway this does not get the respect it deserves it's an amazing b-side i wish more of the album was like this

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU'RE SELFISH! WOO! PUT YOUR HANDS UP IF YOU'RE SELFISH SELFISH!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): sis went straight back to her trademark sound

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): So many love songs are like “I would DIE for you” and yeah that’s just not me I want to live and thrive tbh!

**buddhacharm** (10): something something motherquake... mother lake... mothercane...

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is rina's bad friend (charli's version), like from the title to the lyrical content to the "put you're hands up if ..." bridge

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): mega bop

**Leixander** (10): the dramatic fadeout sends me every time

**reput4tionera** (10): the corporate people for my starbucks came to our store while this was playing and i was just hoping and praying that they thought this was on the store playlist

**AmandaYoung2083** (9.7): I'm a selfish girl!!

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): the production is irresistible idk my hands are up

**notarobot3675** (9.6): my fave of the bonus tracks

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9.5): this should've had a Rina Sawayama feature for maximum impact.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): Not my favorite song on the (deluxe) record by my favorite beat/production on the whole thing, for sure. Most points are for that

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh that breakdown at the end is so pussy

**moonshxne** (9): stuck in sound and vision, something like religion

**oscarbrierley1** (9): y2k bop. im docking a point for the party noise singng part, it always annoys me when songs have a part that has random people singing along.

**shckskndv** (9): INSANE that this is a deep cut. Sexy af.

**skeeturz** (9): this feels like the most janet-esque of her songs and it's incredible

**Stryxen** (9): ended the mid allegations with ease

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): 🙌

**vayyiqra** (9): sick beat ! 🚘

**bloodjet** (8.8): damnnn crash should've had more garage influence like this song because this song is a bop! 🙌 (putting my hands up cause i'm selfish)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): me fighting off co-hosts to play my niche interlude choice nobody knows at the reveal

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): The outro hook "Put your hands up if you're selfish!" is so catchy dear gawd

**runaway3212** (8.5): this is lyrically great

**impla77** (8.3): my hands are firmly up

**1998tweety** (8): now why wasnt this on the standard version

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): rihanna's crown tipped a little bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I’m often mixed on the party mad bad girl Charli portrays in her music but I think it works here, it’s a nice deconstruction of what that archetype is about.

**JIRACHI** (8): shellfishes when they are a girl:

**jman457** (8): Nice B-side, like the bridge

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): WAITTT garage charli is kinda hitting

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): why does this almost feel like a pastiche of a charli song

**scythersboots** (7.6): fun

**seanderlust** (7.3): "you only ever wanted the world"??? that froot looks familiar charli

**dreamingpastel** (7.2): The "put your hands up if you're selfish" part is a bit of fun

**DirtyRat583** (7): the primadonna girl vibes - even she wanted another familiar froot moment

**DrumBeatGlass** (7): Started the deluxe strong enough, are those strings sampled?

**ktajlili** (7): i like these bonus tracks. their weird, messy and not as cleanly produced, but I think they add something special to the album. A little bit of bonus content for fans of Charli. I really don't think there are many albums as cohesive and as well-curated.

**modulum83** (7): i am in a boutique clothing store in soho

**Nagisoid** (7): That bridge sounds like something I'd hear at a quinceañeras party but it ate a bit I fear

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Choosing to believe Newjeans heard this and said "What if we slow it down a little?"

**welcome2thejam** (7): 🙋‍♂️

**shipperondeck** (6.9): fun?

## Begging you to do mutual aid with them

**alexismateofan** (6): kind of popping but like i need more breaks charli ending is perfection though

**Aoquesth378** (6): I'm not obsessed with the song like I want to be, but it's an okay track.

**imbaby122** (6): that froot looks familiar…

**prettybirbkotori** (6): this song feels like if i ordered a crash song from wish

**Raindrac** (6): Now THIS is a propulsive and energetic beat! Her vocals sound great in the chorus as well. As soon as I listened to this, I immediately had the feeling that the deluxe tracks were going to be better than most of the tracks on the standard edition. I wasn't wrong. The post-chorus is repetitive and could've been better, though. But hey, it's better than nothing. Without a post-chorus, the chorus would feel unresolved as it transitioned into the next verse.

**uberpigeon** (6): im just a selfish girl with selfish dreams who never learns

**camerinian** (5.5): there's a bop buried in here somewhere, and I like hearing some more hyperpoppy synths and filters, but this is quite clearly a first draft

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (5): Oh the synths are good in this one.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): you should’ve been more selfish and kept this one to you, Choli

**shhhneak** (5): Crowd work? Do not sing this live in Germany.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (4): This actually my first introduction to this album because I was on long train ride home and I fell asleep after relistening to Loneliest Time. I missed most of Charli’s album and I woke up to mid chorus to “put your hands up if you’re selfish”.

**UselessTacooo** (4): she tried 😭

**thedoctordances1940** (2.9): this just sucks

**cashewconstellation** (1): don't order Primadonna from Shein!

**babadork** (0): I think this is supposed to have a You’ve Got To Give It Up party vibe, but the production doesn’t work.

**TiltControls** (0): REDACTED LIKELY FRONTRUNNER should be glad the Charli added a lightning rod to her deluxe album for me to 0 instead

**pig-serpent** (7): This is a cute song with a nice instrumental.  It gives me strong day 2 energy, but it was holding on to a high day one spot the whole time.  It’s pretty accurately rated in terms of Charli songs, but people are bullying her middle of the pack songs as she’s almost lost half her songs while Carly and Rina have only lost three each, and this song definitely should’ve been over a few more of their songs.

**hikk** (6.5): This is a cute little closing track with some nice production but I fail to see much interesting about it outside of making jokes about the kpop group. This is a fine placement for it imo.

---

## Impulsive

**cremeebrulee** (11): such a comforting song that assuages a lot of my own personal fears of loneliness and death. i love how blunt the chorus can be (the line "die happy thinking about my best friends" hits particularly hard) yet it's one of her prettiest sounding songs ever

**AHSWeeknd** (10): that outro lifts me to another plane of existence

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): I really love this song, it reminds me of SOPHIE and it sounds like a tribute to her.

**beeozan** (10): vgm-core (complimentary)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Just gonna give this a 10 and move on to the next song!

**dreamingpastel** (10): The sweetest song about endings. It definitely took a while to grow on me, but after reading what Charli has said about it, it might be my favorite song off the album.

**phonethephoenix** (10): ultimately I think this is my fav on the album. love the theme and love the music :)

**queershoulder** (10): love the lyrics

**RandomHypnotica** (10): another 11 worthy song for the "charli songs to crydance to" playlist

**reput4tionera** (10): don’t cry don’t cry don’t cry

**seanderlust** (10): TWICE?! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkA7rMHxtlI (yes i'm making this joke twice on my ballot)

**Stryxen** (10): WHAT impeached trump ???

**Ambrosia42** (9.3): one of the songs that leans more into her hyperpop tendencies and also expresses some tender emotions after losing her friend SOPHIE <3

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): Pre-chorus and chorus are both ear-worms in very different ways and I love them both

**shipperondeck** (9): score kinda inflated bc i associate it with an oc (writer moment) (my bad)

**skeeturz** (9): very mellow  but i enjoy it a lot

**bloodjet** (8.5): cute song, i like the lyrics. also love the key change towards the end

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): who said existential crisis can’t be fun

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): charli must be a Scientist the way this song makes me Feel Special and Fancy. it makes me want to Dance the Night Away even when i’m Alcohol-Free. this song is always a Signal for me to Cheer Up. jesus christ twice has so many title tracks uhh doughnut the feels yes or yes heart sh

**runaway3212** (8.5): She spilled a bit maybe

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): I think about TWICE all the time sorry charli

**DrumBeatGlass** (8.1): I really thought it was gonna be a tribute to the kpop girl group. It's not really the production, but the lyrics that draw me to this song and the therapeutic feeling. The outro is angelic

**UselessTacooo** (8.1): I wish I liked it more but it’s nice

**Awkward\_King** (8): i wont make a kpop joke

**throwaway-7650** (8): scoring this higher than the feels' winning average (edit: was at 8.5)

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): actually so cute, people underrate her slower stuff

**jasannn** (7.8): Charli’s a ONCE confirmed

**Aoquesth378** (7.5): One of my favorite songs on first listen but it hasn't grown on me as much as some other songs have

**imbaby122** (7.5): this song is stuck in how i’m feeling now/crash limbo. pick a side.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): yeah I don’t think twice anymore cause new jeans ate them up

**jman457** (7.2): Stan Loona instead

**1998tweety** (7): ended those kpop fads

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what do we think Charli XCX thinks of The Feels winning the kpop rate

**kappyko** (7): WHAT IS LOVE???

**Nagisoid** (7): Where's the I NEED YOUR COCK RIGHT NOW?

**TiltControls** (7): XCX World a level in the next Kingdom Hearts game?

**vayyiqra** (7): Charli in this song: "don't think twice" / Twice in smash hit "I'm Gonna Be a Star": "you- you better think twice" which is it??? Getting mixed messages here! 🚘

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Utada is unbothered

**xxipil0ts** (7): Nayeon-i, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun-i, Chaeyoung, Tzuyu, urin baro TWICE!

## Thinking through their options

**ricki** (6.4): i feel like this is TWICE shade

**bogo** (6): don’t think twice? i don’t even think once

**camerinian** (6): the outro is surprisingly dreamy but otherwise this is a pretty anticlimatic way to end the album, especially when Charli is normally so good at closers.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): something something Kpop

**ktajlili** (6): I think this is a bit boring but it's a cute closer. A cute little message to fans reminding them to live their lives to the fullest. Makes even more of an impact when you consider what she's been through as an artist and with the death of her close friend.

**uberpigeon** (5.7): TWICE TWICE??????

**apatel27** (5): Insert twice reference here

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): minatozaki sana sweetie im so sorry

**frogaranaman** (5): THE GIRL GROUP????

**JIRACHI** (5): TWICE the group is better

**Leixander** (5): can confirm

**oscarbrierley1** (5): 2016 called, it wants topical house back

**Raindrac** (5): This is cute, I like how soft her vocals sound and how sparkly the instrumental sounds. I don't have much of a reason to relisten to the song and it's quite forgettable, but it's a decent enough outro to the album.

**shckskndv** (5): cute!

**alexismateofan** (4): holy fuck that ending. i really don’t want to be thinking twice about this song because oh my god NOT EVERY MOMENT NEEDS A LYRIC let us BREATHE.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): yeah i dont think twice about this song queen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): didnt think twice about giving this score

**thedoctordances1940** (4): alright i will not think twice about it then

**welcome2thejam** (4): Bad Thing: Twice

**impla77** (3.7): yassified existential crisis

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): would it be a Charli album without a song that's needlessly annoying?

**shhhneak** (3): I’ll listen to this exactly once and be done with it thank yew.

**ImADudeDuh** (2.1): You have stolen my heart, oh, yeah, Never let it go, oh, oh, no, Never let it go, oh, oh, oh

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (2): Nothing happens in this song.

**memezaharamole** (2): haven't loved this one, and seeing it live just didn't hit at all like the rest of the set.

**hikk** (7.5): I’ve only heard Channel Tres through features and he’s pretty cool but this track is just Decent. I appreciate it because I too am an attention whore but I wouldn’t call this an album standout, so late day 1 isn’t too far off from where I would place it.

**pig-serpent** (2): This song is a hard whiff and a strong zero contender .  An ugly melody and the bassy male spoken word vocals have no energy and actively take me out of the song, on top of having what is probably the worst iteration of Tove Lo’s bargain bin synthwave production.  There’s nothing about this song I like listening to, and this easily should’ve been in the bottom five the rate, but a lot of people love this song for some reason.  More power to them I guess.

---

## Very good at getting attention

**akanewasright** (10): she’s just like me fr…

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): so do I bruh, so do I!

**Awkward\_King** (10): channel tres the father that you are

**plastichaxan** (10): I’m not sexy enough to relate to all Tove Lo songs but when I do I feel unstoppable 💋

**ReallyCreative** (10): Channel Tres if you're reading this i am free on thursday night. if you would like to hang out i am free on thursday night when i am free to hang out.

**shhhneak** (10): This is happening on the same dance floor as That! Feels Good!

**shipperondeck** (10): i resonate with this line: IM AN ATTENTION WHORE

**notarobot3675** (9.7): her and channel tres on this song are just so good

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): resisting the urge to tag u\/h- a host

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): I’m an attention whore….

**1998tweety** (9): the man kinda slayed this

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (9): Channel Tres' feature feels phoned in to an otherwise perfect track.

**Aoquesth378** (9): Initially I didn't think Channel Tres fit the song and I wanted just Tove Lo, but listening to the song again I actually think he fits very nicely.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): this song speaks to me

**JIRACHI** (9): i'm an attention WHOREEEEEEE

**phonethephoenix** (9): this one's fun!

**reput4tionera** (9): slayed

**sharts-n-farts** (9): The feature is cool, the deep voice makes me drool.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): gets stuck in my head shockingly often. how deranged must i seem when i sing "i'm an attention whooooooore" under my breath in line at the post office

**vayyiqra** (9): the title made me think this would be obnoxious but it's really good also she explains it's ironic and self-aware or so on ♀️

**wasian-invasion** (9): wait how is this one not SG Lewis

**welcome2thejam** (9): Solid stretch of mid-album club tracks

**jman457** (8.4): Euphoria if it slayed

**AHSWeeknd** (8): A&W

**alexismateofan** (8): I want to see a drag queen perform this so I can tip them.

**modulum83** (8): me when i write an out of pocket comment for a song in hopes of getting featured in the banner

**Nagisoid** (8): This one is for the banner-obsessed raters

**sarcasticsobs** (7.8): Boppin' a lil bit

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): we all are

**imbaby122** (7.5): i’m an attention whore for channel tres apparently bc ermagerd that voice.

**Stryxen** (7.5): twerk…

**uberpigeon** (7.5): me too gorge

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): what hole did Channel Tres crawl out of I don’t get it

**frogaranaman** (7): me too

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Don’t love the voice/delivery of the featured artist

**impla77** (7): are we going to talk about the dinosaur mount??

**prettybirbkotori** (7): the spotify storyline says THIS IS MY SASSY DRUNK SONG and yeah that sums it up

**ricki** (7): omg meeee

**skeeturz** (7): just like above i'm not really sure why i really liked this song, but something about it was just a fun listen

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): deadmau5 and mellefresh who

**DaHumanTorch** (6.8): predicting exactly 16 comments that in some way say "same girl"

**camerinian** (6.5): please don’t let this put you off Channel Tres’ music. His feature here isn’t bad but he just doesn’t blend very well with Tove. He makes bops on his own and he fucking kills live. 6AM and Topdown are the bangers you must start with.

## Don't feed the trolls

**dreamingpastel** (6): I'm afraid the feature brought the score down

**kwcty6888** (6): the only dud on this album

**shckskndv** (6): exactly which channel can I find this Tres guy on? I hope it’s a 🟠⚫️🌈 channel 🤤

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Good for you Tove Lo

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): There's something cool about Channel Tres' voice here but idk at the same time it just doesn't really work

**CrimsonROSET** (5): see this is what I was scared this album was gonna sound like but also why does she have a dinosaur

**queershoulder** (5): my least favorite from this album and this entire ranking

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): me when i make the most unfunny joke ever in an attempt to make the banner of a popheads rate

**runaway3212** (4.5): does not keep my attention for a long time

**apatel27** (4): Rhyming Hollywood with Hollywood? Jail

**bogo** (4): funny that this song is called “attention whore” when it’s super ignorable

**Raindrac** (4): The male vocalist, Channel Tres, has a great performance here— the sultry delivery is perfect for a song as sexual as Attention Whore. But everyone else, not so much. It's an unremarkable song otherwise.

**moonshxne** (2.6): 🤖 feat. 🧟

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I’m such a Channel Tres fanatic that I’m somewhat floored how much of a flop this song is to me. it’s not his fault, the whole song just seems like a cheesy mess. It’s somewhat boring but also has the minimal, annoying repeating synth and uninteresting melodies.

**DrumBeatGlass** (1): boring and cringy, can't stand the man's voice

**hikk** (7): tbh I liked this when it came out ages ago but after that initial period of listening I haven’t come back to it and hearing it again now I feel like my score should be a bit lower. In the world of edm collabs this isn’t the worst of them, there’s plenty of boring and bland and bad ones, this sultrier take is just okay but as a whole it misses the mark of being anything truly great.

**pig-serpent** (2): It’s certainly trying, but overall this song is giving me nothing.

---

## Does their best work under pressure

**1998tweety** (10): at least tove will win something

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this should’ve been longer omg

**runaway3212** (10): a moment in my life

**throwaway-7650** (10): how to serve cunt in <3 minutes:

**akanewasright** (9.4): YASS

**Aoquesth378** (9): Very fun and experimental track from Martin, and Tove Lo serves once again

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): I love the minimalist groove on this one. Really sick.

**reput4tionera** (9): that bassline is insane

**phonethephoenix** (8.3): kind of mesmerizing and cool

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I really, really like this song.

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (8): if there’s one thing tove is gonna do it’s make me pop my pussy in the club

**queershoulder** (8): all around good

**skeeturz** (8): it's that good dark synth stuff i eat

**vayyiqra** (8): this is cool

**Ambrosia42** (7.8): not really that catchy, but it’s a vibe

**modulum83** (7.2): playing this on bass-boosted car speakers and immediately causing a magnitude 2.1 earthquake

**imbaby122** (7): this is kind of grungy and sexy in an understated way. i like it.

**Stryxen** (7): sure

## Getting headaches from their sinus pressure

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (6): I love the main hook but it doesn't quite carry for 2:24.

**alexismateofan** (6): it feels like it’s trying to be sexier than it actually is which is unfortunate.

**jasannn** (6): Stream Strangers by Seven Lions Feat. Tove Lo!!

**RandomHypnotica** (6): i am under immense pressure trying to write this, the last comment of the ballot

**seanderlust** (6): i have heard this almost ten times and i have no idea what it sounds like

**shckskndv** (6): lovely bass

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): the spotify canvas for this song is so funny. what is going on

**jman457** (5.2): just boring vibey edm

**Awkward\_King** (5): this is definitely a dance song featuring tove lo

**Nagisoid** (5): Not this Nintendo 64 type beat

**nick1372** (5): this is fine but it sets a bad precedent. can we keep martin garrix in the 2010s please

**prettybirbkotori** (5): i have never heard such ugly trumpets

**UselessTacooo** (5): dollar tree geometry dash

**DrumBeatGlass** (4.5): interesting, but too short and samey throughout

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): pretty boring

**IIIHenryIII** (3): missed opportunity to have named it Under Pressure and get a ton of comments saying Vanilla Ice outsold

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i thought edm was supposed to stand for electronic dance music, who is dancing to this

**moonshxne** (2): i heard nothing

**sarcasticsobs** (1): Christ on a cracker. Not a fault of Tove at all, but this is offensively soulless and boring

**shipperondeck** (1): literally goes nowhere ughhhhh

**pig-serpent** (10): Acoustic guitar songs are super hit or miss for me, but this one is a resounding hit, not only musically, but the lyrics about an immigrant parent apologizing for refusing to accept her gay son are hitting super hard for me as I'm watching my non immigrant parents struggling to accept that I'm trans.  I really hoped this would prove me wrong and find a lot of supporters, but it fairly predictably got whacked towards the end of day 1.  Easily one of the two biggest robberies of the day for me.

**hikk** (2): The lyricism here is very sweet but I struggle to find myself able to get engaged with it at all sonically. It’s probably the most low-key song on the album and a big drop off from the middle section that I adore so much, so that also affects my score.

---

## Will cry when witnessing a parent loving their child

**1998tweety** (10): we love a gay bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): wow, pain

**akanewasright** (10): fuck…

**alexismateofan** (10): my new favorite song about John. also might be my favorite song on the album. I LIKE THE SLOW SONGS.

**apatel27** (10): Big Mood in LGBT Acceptance

**Awkward\_King** (10): im still not sorry for everything i said about chosen family, rancid ass song. this is what she should've dropped!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When the top three is this, Bends, and Go Find Yourself or Whatever and my feelings don’t get hurt yaaasss.

**bogo** (10): man… i’m lucky enough to have a mother that is very accepting of my sexuality, but like even then this song just hits hard. my heart goes out to everyone who relates to this song in some way and i send my best wishes to those people and hope they know they are loved

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): her best songwriting argue with the wall

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): one of my favorite songs from the album, so emotional

**frogaranaman** (10): incredibly poignant and potential career high lyricism from Rina here

**nick1372** (10): This should be one of the defining queer songs of our time. There's something beautiful about Rina putting herself in the shoes of not only a parental figure, but someone clearly not from her culture. Even though it's clearly a fantasy (whose parents are going to therapy and being honest about their feelings like this) the empathy, kindness, and understanding weaved into the song is just so wonderful. Anyway if this goes out on day 1 like Chosen Family did I'm committing homophobic hate crimes against every single one of you <3.

**phonethephoenix** (10): this song is sweet😭

**RandomHypnotica** (10): idk him sorry

**reput4tionera** (10): oh i’ve cried to this

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): olivia rodrigo - hope ur ok if it slayed a bit more

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): her best ballad. so quaint and unassuming but so so *sad*

**throwaway-7650** (9.6): u/Raindrac in ratrick:

**dreamingpastel** (9): Pretty straightforward ballad, but the folk/country sound works very well with the lyrics

**DrumBeatGlass** (9): The backstory is heartbreaking, simple but great production. The break was much needed after bombastic Hurricanes. I think this could fit better in place of Imagining

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love gay people :(

**queershoulder** (9): I really like this one and how soft it is

**seanderlust** (9): god what a sweet subject for a song

**UselessTacooo** (8.9): this song is so pretty omg love

**Ambrosia42** (8.8): not a smash or anything, but it’s beautiful

**flava** (8.5): wait, is this about John Wick?

**modulum83** (8.5): [https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/115/903/70e.jpg_large](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/115/903/70e.jpg_large)

**babadork** (8.3): This was going to be in the 7’s, but she sounds too good at the end of the second chorus before the bridge.

**Aoquesth378** (8): beautifully haunting song. Not much else to say.

**camerinian** (8): also send my love to any kid under 15 named John. Seems like one of those names kids just don't have any more, like Darren

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this reminds me so much of haim hallelujah and idk if it’s just me

**ktajlili** (8): I really love the story of this song. It's very sweet.

**prettybirbkotori** (8): the story behind this song is so cute and i actually really love that she just fully embraces the ballad-ness of the record here

**ReallyCreative** (8): I do know a bunch of gay Johns tbh

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Aw

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This one hurts

**wasian-invasion** (8): was this john wick 4 promo

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7.5): very heartfelt, but there's better songs that sounds like this.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): i didnt really care for this song when it first came out. then i listened to it hungover one day and nearly cried

**TiltControls** (7.5): why wait to make a Rina Sawayama's john wick joke in the bonus rate when one can be made now

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.2): this is actually really nice?

**bloodjet** (7): the lyrics are gorgeous but i feel her voice isn't a good suit for this type of song

**DirtyRat583** (7): yeah this one can flop idc

**jman457** (7): Taylor swift in 2011 3

**Leixander** (7): lovely

**shckskndv** (7): Rina’s songwriting camp of excitable twinks were probably BAWLING when she read this one out.

**vayyiqra** (7): I was kind of worried I wouldn't fully get the emotional core of this album because I have a traumatic upbringing and family backstory but for very different reasons from the things Rina talks about in her music but this song did kind of move me so 🫂

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): We queers are so emotionally fucked up our only source of closure is writing fake songs where we pretend we're our own parents who learn to accept us 🥲

pig-serpent: ## Probably would kill John Wick's dog

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (6): It hits really hard but I can't quite connect to it.

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (6): Joanne by lady Gaga ass song

**imbaby122** (6): motherrrrr

**plastichaxan** (6): I don’t know if he’ll like it

**scythersboots** (6): i don’t know i want to like it but there’s a little too much musical theater in it for me

**shipperondeck** (6): very sweet

**skeeturz** (6): it's an okay song it's not my cup of tea but i appreciate the song in the context of the album

**Stryxen** (6): i usually love an acoustic moment but i think rina’s vocals weirdly are too strong for this, like she feels out of place but the melodies and guitars and especially the lyrics are gorgeous - it just doesn’t do much for me

**cremeebrulee** (5): it gives audiobook a little

**JIRACHI** (5): so cheesy for no reason like

**Raindrac** (5): The acoustic guitar riff here reminds me a lot of X-Static Process by Madonna. I wonder if it was inspired? Between that and the mention of chasing the American dream, it feels likely. Either way, it's a pleasant song, but not something that I see myself coming back to.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): john WICK?

**uberpigeon** (5): i just have no thoughts about this sorry john

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): definitely a song that exists

**notarobot3675** (4.5): this is fine but feels like a song that could have been done by anyone - there was a lot of room for it to be more dynamic imho

**DaHumanTorch** (4.3): love the lyrics but...that's about it

**beeozan** (4): so this is how Rina got the role

**IIIHenryIII** (4): this is very pretty and emotional but has nothing on chosen family

**jasannn** (4): I’ll take chosen family over this

**runaway3212** (4): literally no mom is this self-reflective

**shhhneak** (3): what in the Younger Now/Endless Summer Vacation Miley Cyrus era is this?

**kappyko** (2): Chrissy Teigen is responsible for this

**Nagisoid** (2): Listening to this hurts both because the subject matter hits close to home and also because I believe Rina did not know how to approach such a delicate topic in the wider context of the album's "if you are brave you can slay" thesis, which makes some of the lyrics come across as tasteless, at least to me. The folk pop pastiche she's trying to go for is also pretty dull and mediocre but it's not my main problem with the song. I'm sorry for this score but this track triggers me so expect me to leave the queue when this goes out. I gave this a 2 because I appreciate her for writing a song about an underrepresented issue like this, even if I do not think it works at all. It's one of these few songs I'd rather not hear ever again, and it's probably not Rina's fault in the grand scheme of things but it is what it is.

**sharts-n-farts** (1): ugh this song is making me emotional and I hate that for me.

**pig-serpent** (5): This feels like it should be one of the better slow songs on this record with the acoustic instrumental choices, but at this point in the album I'm over okay slow songs, and enough people thought this song was boring to have it in last for a little bit.  I certainly think this song landed in the range of acceptable values for me.

**hikk** (4): This has always been a skip for me because this folky ballad style isn't for me at all but the lyrics are actually really hitting right now so I do wish I gave this a higher score... but if I was in a better headspace right now I think I wouldn't have that regret for this mid score, so I'm at peace with it. The sorrow is really here in her voice, you can hear how much it hurts for her to be on the receiving end of this heartbreak that, from experience, I understand is difficult to process. All in all though, I'm not upset at this leaving day 1.

## Book 6 of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World

**static\_int\_husp** (11): feels unfortunately much too relatable to me

**AHSWeeknd** (10): tears ✨

**amiriteoramiwrongg** (10): sobbed at the concert, sob every listen since

**Aoquesth378** (10): Complete 180 from Shooting Star but I actually love this song so much and I think it works much better than other slow songs on the album.

**apatel27** (10): The switch up to lowkey works really well in this album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): People cried.

**bogo** (10): BALLAD BALLAD BALLAD BALLDA DLA BD LDABA DBLAD BLADBADL DALDBALDBABDABDALBDLDABLBD AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IT’S SO GOOD

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): lovely

**flava** (10): oh this hit a very ethereal spot, really good shit carly

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): carly should do more guitar ballads like this so i can sob pathetically to every song

**IIIHenryIII** (10): that instrumental bridge is superb, props to her

**imbaby122** (10): no other song has ever given me such a strong urge to wistfully stare out a car window on the open road on a beautiful summer day.

**impla77** (10): This was an encore at the concert I went to. Rogue encore pick.. but it worked! Really loved how she showcased her longtime guitarist with the solo :) I feel like this will be robbed..

**nick1372** (10): Me to my Airpods when I lose the case and I can't find it but I have to pretend like having the earbuds without the case is not causing tremendous anxiety:

**runaway3212** (10): self-help queen

**seanderlust** (10): i love how well this illustrates the hurt by combining anger and sadness so well

**shhhneak** (10): Her audition to be our generation’s Stevie Nicks.

**Stryxen** (10): real

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): gut-wrenching. the hurt in her voice when she so softly says "...or whatever" is so palpable

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): it’s so good, i can’t explain

**bloodjet** (9.5): i love how huge this song feels

**DrumBeatGlass** (9.5): Country Carly? Yes, please. Morgan Wallen found dead. Lyrics are outstanding, can we just have a good talk about her growth as a songwriter?

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): i love this end of the campfire ballad idc

**TiltControls** (9.5): I love the way that the chorus is just so casually said

**Frajer** (9): exactly what every other CRJ song was missing a sitar solo

**ImADudeDuh** (9): “go find yourself or whatever” is a top 10 burn of all time

**shckskndv** (9): a real feat for Carly as a songwriter.

**scythersboots** (8.9): this seems like it should be the album closer for some reason, its so pretty and so sad

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh she's over it

**Nagisoid** (8): Who would have thought there would be a song in this album that sounds eerily similar to Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd, but it's a great change of pace

**prettybirbkotori** (8): probably my least favorite from the album but still a very pretty ballad

**vayyiqra** (8): [Very passive-aggressive title lol!] Mellow guitar ballads are of course always a hit on this sub! 🍐

**sarcasticsobs** (7.6): Sweet. Not wild on this one's instrumental bridge tho

**queershoulder** (7.5): I think it would be a higher number if it wasn't next to the BEST track

**notarobot3675** (7.3): this was actually the first time i relistened to this song since the album came out, i wasnt impressed with it initially but i ended up really liking it this time round!

**shipperondeck** (7.2): me realizing i made someone feel the way this song feels oops

**2000ablenderoddyssey** (7): I love this for her actually.

**alexismateofan** (7): it’s rare to find such a beautiful yearning song but here we are, here it is!!!!

**Leixander** (7): lovely but wish it was more memorable

**luckyphase** (7): it's too long

**phonethephoenix** (7): so pretty! toeing the line of being boring though lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Surprisingly not too bad for how long it is

**wasian-invasion** (7): if this album was a movie, this is when youd go get popcorn before the big finale

**jman457** (6.7): Its a nice throwback to her more folk self, but i wish it was either more folkcore or blues-rock.

pig-serpent: ## Have yet to go on their hero's journey to find out who they really are

**camerinian** (6.5): yeah fine carly you can be in boygenius too

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6.5): or whatever

**JIRACHI** (6.5): balladphobia did its thing this time i'm sorry

**Raindrac** (6.5): It's easy for a song as mellow and minimalistic as Go Find Yourself or Whatever to go wrong, but she managed to pull it off. The guitar riff and her vocals both sound great, something which is important if you're going to put such a strong focus on them. Other instruments are gradually eased in, preserving the focus on the guitar and her vocals while adding more depth to the soundscape. It's a really pleasant song, probably my favorite ballad of this rate.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): feels more like a closing song than the title track, and this is good but also it feels weird sandwiched between two songs with more energy

**1998tweety** (6): snooze

**kappyko** (6): Just say fuck girl

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): this song is unfortunately boring.

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): normally im a ballad defender but this is sooooo out of place even with some of the more organic sounds like Western Wind

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): More like... Nah I'm not gonna make the obvious joke.

**ReallyCreative** (5): she really had the most cutthroat read ever with Talking To Yourself and followed it up with this neoliberal nonsense...

**thedoctordances1940** (5): very whatever indeed

**uberpigeon** (5): me breaking up with waldo

**frogaranaman** (4): this is so whiny. like just jerk off you’ll be fine

**skeeturz** (4): i don't particularly like or hate it either, but something about it makes me feel less than neutral about it

**indie\_fan\_** (3.5): idk i never found this to be all that interesting

**ktajlili** (3): boring and cliche Zzzzzz

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): a song with this title should be the most camp thing ever and yet it is not

**UselessTacooo** (3): snoooooooooooze

**cremeebrulee** (2.5): ik this is a fan fave but it just bores me so much.... sry

**beeozan** (2): if Carly distributed the almost 5 minute runtime of this song to other songs to extend the outros this album would’ve been so much more slay or idk maybe don’t put this between your two greatest slays in the tracklist

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Not into this sound from her.

**Awkward\_King** (1): when i am playing hide and seek as a child but have no friends to play it with

**hikk** (7.5): Honestly I don’t remember much about this song ever except the one little synth part at the end. Like wow she didn’t have to eat that up so much? I love a little bleep bloop moment and I wish it was featured more prominently through the whole song, it sounds so cool paired with the vocoder repetition of the song’s title. Maybe I should have given this a better score because the lyrics are also hitting more now… Carly is just so good at these themes my god i’m so sad rn

**Leixander** (10): carly putting herself in horny jail : the song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): someone needs to ban this woman from using the word Away in her song titles anymore

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is so Fleetwood Mac coded

**impla77** (9.3): another robbery inc i fear

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): a vibe

**prettybirbkotori** (9): i thought this song was my least favorite on the album and then i listened to it while playing mario kart and ascended and looped it for like a day

**kwcty6888** (7.3): how many “Away” songs do we really need Ms. Carly

**CrimsonROSET** (7): taps sign ‘STOP RUINING GOOD ALBUM OUTROS WITH ADDING THE BONUS TO THE END AND NOT JUST PUTTING WHERE ELSE THEY FIT IN THE ALBUM’

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): At least the filler songs on the album are all still a little pleasant to listen to

**jman457** (6.3): A little bland but it kind of bops

## 🐵🐵🐵

**babadork** (6): 6

**Raindrac** (6): Keep Away sounds pleasant on the ear, but there's not really much else to it. Decent, but kind of forgettable. Maybe I'll appreciate it more another day.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.7): ok

**IIIHenryIII** (5): stay away, away, away, away

**shckskndv** (5): fighting for second place in the __ Away trilogy.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like a song one of those fake spotify artists that use stock photos of models as their profile image would release

=====

seanderlust: So this is what it’s come down to, huh?

With the tanking of “Keep Away” as 2022’s 37th greatest piece of music by a sub fave, Popheads has finally completed their transition from pretentious Swiftie rag to absolute, unsalvageable garbage. Maybe I’m just old and out of touch. Maybe the children are wrong. But I have no idea how a song with such a luxurious beat and such a fantastic flow and such rare, mindful lyrics like “Keep Away” is even considered just a decent piece of music, much less some generic work of art.

It’s obvious at this point that Popheads has changed, and for the worse. This wouldn’t have happened even five years ago. Back then you could have critiqued Carly for their writing or their attitude or their politics, but their Keep Aways? Their Keep Aways contained some genuinely forward thinking, boundary pushing music. When they made a Keep Away it felt as if they were really trying to reward the best gays of the year. Don’t believe me? Their top three songs of 2012 were Usher’s “Keep Away”, Frank Ocean’s “Keep Away”, and Grimes’ “Keep Away”, three songs that were unique, innovative, and overall well-crafted pieces of pop music. Let’s go back even further, to 2007. Pitchfork’s top three songs from that year were Panda Bear’s “keep away”, Battles’ “Keep Away”, and LCD Soundsystem’s “Call Me Maybe”. There’s no way, absolutely no way at all, that you can tell me that “Keep Away” deserves to be ranked below any of those songs.

And you know what? I actually like some of this list. In the top ten alone I really like “Talking To Yourself” and “Holy (Til You Let Me Go)” and “Pineapple Slice”. But the songs that I only like are simply overwhelmed by the amount of Keep Away elsewhere. And it’s not even as if these “non-Keep Away” songs have some redeeming qualities here and there. It’s not as if they’re songs that, while well-executed, just fail to connect with me. The reality is that, try as I might, I simply cannot fathom what makes a song like “Keep Away” or “Twice” an Un enjoyable, backward thinking piece of music. I can’t even fathom what makes those songs “just decent”. To me they just sound like absolute, unmitigated, masterpieces.

So yeah, I’m getting older. What might have connected with me ten years ago may not connect with me now. But Popheads has also changed. And in their attempt to gain a larger audience they’ve shed the bulk of the avant-garde music that might’ve scared off some of their potential audience (could you even imagine something as weird as the 12 minute long psychedelic odyssey that is “Used To Know Me” cracking the top ten in 2023?) in favor of music that largely panders to the lowest common denominator.

Congratulations, Popheads. I hope all that extra ad revenue is worth it.
