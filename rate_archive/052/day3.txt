Shippy 9 : omg mariah okay you really went off with this oml
 
**twat\_brained** (7): I blame Mariah for kickstarting the Internet herpes that is Wendy Williams memes for that pre-chorus lyric.
 
---
**itsnotrelevantt** (11): No questions asked. I love this era of Taylor Swift, Funhouse is one of the best Pink songs ever, and I love 4 Minutes, Halo, all of the Britney songs… But this is my song yall.
 
**1998tweety** (10): This is such a chill bop. One of the first Mariah songs I heard when I was younger and I still love it. At the time I didn't know how big she was; after listening to a lot of her huge hits this still remains one of my favourites.
 
**followingfreeways** (10): iconic bop and anyone who says otherwise is a robot
 
**gannade** (10): omg Mariahs vocals. How does she even do the ehehehieieroiuifosiyaYAsiodyasydheIOIUWERsas at the beginning
 
**J\_Toe** (10): This is the kind of sound I like from Mariah.
 
**jamesfog** (10): [Iconic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-n_JMkfoe4)
 
**jimmy345960** (10): Now this is a bop that will never ever leave my head for the next 80 years of my life. TOUCH MY BODY
 
**JunkyGS** (10): We love a #1 Billboard Hot 100 song, which  is difficult, to get. Not everybody has that to their credit.
 
**original\_doll** (10): classy hoe anthem
 
**piccprincess** (10): No one can touch my body like Mariah can
 
**tapdancingpig** (9.5): Ah, yes, Touch My Clitty. Mariah’s 18th and, as I type this, last #1 single (I’m praying that this Drake collab goes well). I’m ok with that (well, I’m not but suspend your disbelief) because this song deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as her classics.
 
**CarlieScion** (9): i actually dont know if i like this so much or if its just a relief to hear after Migrate
 
**Pearl Louise** (9): Iconic Mariah song. Not to mention the Wendy Williams reference. I also recommend watching the music video with Jack McBryer. It’s very cute and funny.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (9): 🎶🎶 *stop singing my part now, baby* 🎶🎶
 
**AnimationJava** (8): This song will always be iconic for being Mariah's last #1, plus the MV is great and it bops.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Maybe us Mariah fans don't like to admit it, but Touch My Body fucking haunts us. In general, most people I've seen like it, though quite a few people think it's only passable and rate folks think it's one of her best hits. But where it places on our rankings of her No. #1s don't really matter in the long run, because, chronologically, it's her last #1. (Haha, get it? Never mind...) Perhaps that's why I find it a little hard to actively enjoy. I'm going to have to get pass that bias if I want to score it, though. Listening, I find the song quite serviceable. It's the elegant sort of trashy we know and love and expect from Mimi, and no matter how much I resent what it ended up being, I still can't help but love 'I will hunnnntt you downnnn!' It's impossible for one artist to continue pumping out hits forever, and even if this isn't what I'd pick for Mariah's last chart-topper, it's a perfectly fine song on its own.
 
**rickikardashian** (8): 7
 
**selegend** (8): literally a classic
 
**wailordfan\_** (8): Much better, I like the piano presence, and her lyrics/delivery fits the light piano beat really well.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): what... is that video
 
**lilacsweetener** (6): It's cute but basic as hell.
 
**Raykel** (5): I can't describe exactly what it is but the melody of the chorus irritates me
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I’ll pass, mariah, sorry
 
**MissyBee37** (4.5): I've never liked this song... Sorry, I know it was a hit, but I find it boring.
 
**frogaranaman** (1): I usually try and keep my comments light-hearted and fun, but I really couldn’t listen to this song. I’m doing this at a time where I’ve been very triggered from past events over happenings of the world and this song kinda dug into those emotions a bit. So I’m skipping it and moving on.

Shippy 8: idk if ive ever actually listened to this full album but this song kinda convinces me that i should because its really interesting
 
**twat\_brained** (6): Red flag #1, this is literally the exact same guitar pattern for "Who Knew?", just tuned to a C# instead of an A. Doing this rate means I have a chance to properly listen to the lyrics to this for the first time, which brings us to our second red flag: it's a plea to endure a toxic and abusive relationship. I feel like too many of her songs detail her frustration with marriage. Someone get this woman some help, damn
 
---
**1998tweety** (10): My favourite P!nk songs have always been the bops where she gets more emotional and this one is no exception.
 
**AnimationJava** (10): This is my favorite p!nk song, something about the raw emotion and loneliness.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): :sad:
 
**frogaranaman** (10): This song has not been played in a decade and I still can belt every single word to it. Now THAT is a legendary song.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): probably will get sabotaged for the video :shrug:
 
**jamesfog** (10): Beautiful
 
**jimmy345960** (10): Wow she sure makes hard hitting songs.
 
**JunkyGS** (10): Jeez gurl just put your heart on your sleeve and stab it over and over again
 
**Pearl Louise** (10): Such a boppy ballad (idk if I made that up, but you get my point). Deserves way more praise.
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): First of all, that sample of her singing is perfect. Second, no this song is not subtle. But P!nk has never been subtle. We let her release a song about how “you’re fucking perfect.” And this song hits hard. It’s Max Martin produced, so it sticks in your head like nobody’s business, but the lyrics, plain and unsubtle as they are, work.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Wow this shit damn near want to meet someone to love and then lose just to have full atmospheric effect
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): oh...
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): lol this is the complete opposite of So What.
 
**original\_doll** (7.5): pretty generic, but it's good and easy to listen to
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): I've never really heard a downtempo song from Pink that I'd willingly listen to again, so, unfortunately, I don't have particularly strong feelings about Please Don't Leave Me one way or the other. I can appreciate everything here being cleaner compared to songs like Bad Influence, considering Pink's vocals and the smooth, transparent pop rock production accompanying them. But Pink's actual description of her deteriorating relationship doesn't hit me in the gut as much as it should. I get what lines like 'you're my perfect little punching bag' try to go for, but as the song ends up, I'm not particularly convinced that the situation she's singing about is one I'd be clamouring to go back to if I was in her or her ex's place. This song needed to try and be as much of an event as other tracks off Funhouse instead of trying to appear so plain and simple to the point where it ends up being boring.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (6): no idea why this was released as a single, it is genuinely not that great, ugh. iconic video tho
 
**MissyBee37** (3): I can't listen to this without hearing the abuse... Which makes the title & repetition of it hard to accept. Maybe that's the wrong take, but there are too many red flags in these lyrics for me to like it.

Shippy 8: the vocals and lyrics dont interest me, maybe im too old, but its production is really good and it has great energy!
 
**twat\_brained** (7.7): Teenage Taylor at her teenage Tayloriest. Make of that what you will.
 
---
**patronsaintofaspies** (11): Fearless is one of my favourite Taylor songs ever, and it's one of the most memorable tracks I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. This is her first critically acclaimed single for a damn good reason. I think her self-titled debut from 2006 is worth more than a few listens, don't get me wrong, but Fearless is where that blonde singer-songwriter teen idol really becomes Taylor Swift, and it's where she jumps from an upcoming country pop artist from Tennessee to becoming a global idol. Though many rightfully praise Taylor for writing a song as good as this at such a relatively age, it's not surprising - the nostalgia and intensity represented in Fearless best comes from a young adult ending one chapter of their life and starting a new one, and that's what Taylor was when she wrote this masterpiece. Maybe there are a handful of songs from its parent record that Fearless doesn't claim the popularity of, but anybody who appreciates Taylor should automatically enjoy this one. Here is where that record opens, and here is where one of the most iconic artists of our generation truly begins.
 
**poppinmmolly** (11): this is such a killer album opener. It sets the tone for the album perfectly.
 
**AnimationJava** (10): UGH! Taylor's ability to write. A banger that served LYRICS.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): IN!!! MY!!! BEST!!! DRESS!!! FEARLESS!!!
 
**followingfreeways** (10): this is the first song I learned on guitar 6 1/2 years ago, it means lots to me and I just absolutely love everything about this song and album
 
**gannade** (10): It’s enjoyably breezy, but I do like to point out how annoyingly white this song is. Standing in your best dress in the rain is fearless now? Lmao. Even Rachel Platten has more edge
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): what a bop
 
**jamesfog** (10): Bop
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): whew
 
**original\_doll** (10): fantastic album opener, this song just makes me smile
 
**piccprincess** (10): This song was just one of my two secret songs at one of the Metlife dates and it poured the entire show. When will your fave
 
**tooshorttoofast** (10): omg how was this 10 years ago
 
**1998tweety** (8.8): I don't know why but for some reason I didn't think this was that good, but its much better than I remembered.
 
**rickikardashian** (8.7): Since I became an actual stan just quite recently this song (and like ⅔ of the album tbh) was kind of unknown to me, I had heard it, but I didn't care for it, until she performed it live in the Rep tour. It was just magical seeing Taylor full of love and joy, dripping wet under the rain sing the line “With you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress”
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): I sometime hear fingerless instead of fearless in the chorus and I don’t know what to think about this...
 
**MissyBee37** (8): There's a special spot in my heart for this song because of a time in my life, but tbh I always thought the verses a little bumbling in flow. Like, the rhythm of the clunky is just hard to follow? But the chorus is a bit of magic. I love, love, love the sentiment and imagery of dancing in a storm in your best dress.
 
**Pearl Louise** (8): The title track is probably one of the few songs on the album I can tolerate. Even though country Taylor is not my cup of tea, I can listen to this song by her and decently enjoy the song.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): Not her best, but still absolutely adorable. Taylor has come SO far as a singer and a songwriter, but you can still see her strengths as a songwriter on clear display here.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://media.giphy.com/media/K7HYkHOU911D2/giphy.gif
 
**jimmy345960** (7.8): Good, On par with Shake it off and Dress in that I like them but they aren't her BEST.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (7): iss really cute.
 
**frogaranaman** (6): This is very white of Taylor.

Shippy 10: remains one of katys best songs
 
**twat\_brained** (9.4): I love that Katy is going for an atypical theme here; her vocal and emotional commitment makes it feel even more endearing + convincing
 
---
**MissyBee37** (11): I love every single tiny detail about this song. I love the tone of her voice, I love how she expresses the longing & the love & the ambiguity of it all. The lyrics are Katy's wit and wordplay at its finest. "Comparisons are easily done once you've had a taste of perfection" might be one of my favorite opening lines to a song ever. I love the added part in the final chorus, where she daydreams, almost angrily, about the real object of her affections coming back.
 
**PuggleMaster** (11): SO FUCKING GOOD!!!
 
**selegend** (11): she wrote this entire song by herself, and it’s remarkably beautiful. her vocals on this are so on point. definitely wish she had more songs like this.
 
**1998tweety** (10): Another song where I love Katy's vocals. The lyrics on this are super cute too, Katy uses various metaphors that work well together. They all help push the overall theme that Katy is not over her ex. “He kissed my lips I taste your mouth.” is my favourite line in the whole song. Its so simple but that one line perfectly captures the rest of the song.
 
**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): I can see why this wasn't as big as her other singles, but it's a shame since it's honestly one of her best songs
 
**black\_velvet\_** (10): I already gave my 11 to Miss Mariah, but this was my second choice. Plus Katy never looked more beautiful than in music video for this song.
 
**followingfreeways** (10): this is my favorite song by her and I dont care what anyone says, this song is fuckign fantastic
 
**hikkaru** (10): :genericsad:
 
**JunkyGS** (10): We love a tear jerking master piece written by only Katy Perry.
 
**piccprincess** (10): I cry everytime
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): her best song
 
**jimmy345960** (9.8): Very good song.
 
**CarlieScion** (9): vocals on poooooooooint
 
**tooshorttoofast** (9): one of her best-written songs just wow
 
**wailordfan\_** (9): ~~There are some people I knew who were thinking of giving this their 11, and no tea or shade, but why? It's a fun power ballad, and has some of Katy's best instrumentals, but the chorus~~ Never mind, this is really great lyrically, I love this I think. Like, legit in love with it. I stan.
 
**AnimationJava** (8): Really cute and heart-throbbing bop!
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Remember the music video rate, everyone? I recall people becoming raging mad over the fact that this wasn't picked for Katy's video list, all because the random number generator decided the poor girl couldn't get a break. Guess what? This is my first time consciously listening to the song, so I still haven't watched the music video! I might as well, though. This may be a step below The One That Got Away, since it's pretty much just a simple pop rock ballad that fits right in a sample of popular music in 2008, but it's a great track that serves to assure you that, yes, even if she isn't always a pro at it, Katy does have genuine songwriting skills. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy her crooning in that blended chorus, too.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8): the acoustic version she played on the witness tour made me emotional
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Her vocal delivery here could have used some more work, but otherwise, this is a surprisingly effective ballad.
 
**Pearl Louise** (7): ̶W̶o̶w̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶g̶u̶y̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶v̶i̶d̶e̶o̶ ̶d̶i̶e̶d̶ ̶q̶u̶i̶c̶k̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶n̶ ̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶o̶w̶n̶ ̶c̶a̶r̶e̶e̶r̶.̶ A nice little tearjerker. It’s not a great standout, but I applaud Katy for bringing back the christian pop sound that made her famous.
 
**ulikejazz** (7): Cute song but it has some real weird turns of phrase that throw me off every time
 
**gannade** (6): These vocals ain’t it. Katy has definitely improved since here, also I can’t understand anything she is saying in this song. She is doing her best indie voice girl impression.
 
**Raykel** (6): It's a little boring but she gets real emotional towards the end and it carries it
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Never really was one of the Katy songs I gravitated towards tbh
 
**animefangrant62** (5): [parts of this song work but others are really fucking annoying]
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (4): there is a reason this was katy's worst performing single for like 6 years. And i get some people like it but it is just a bad ballad sorry about it KATY HAS BETTER BALLADS
 
**frogaranaman** (3): ..okay.

Shippy 10: i tried giving this less than a ten and im sorry but it literally didnt work the number autocorrected to a ten idk man idk what to do but i feel like ten is appropriate for a song that literally has one of the best music videos ever and is actually probably an amazing song thanks
 
**twat\_brained** (10): A DESERVED #1 hit. Also have I ever mentioned the first time I saw the video it was right after purchasing it on iTunes and my dad was right next to me? Also I was 10 years old lol. Nonetheless this bops, the video is sexy and Brit looked sexy performing this on the Circus tour. Hell, she looks sexy now when she does the dance breakdown to this on the POM tour.
 
---
**Pearl Louise** (11): Ladies and gentlemen, all rise for the LGBT national anthem. WOMANIZER IS THAT BITCH! When I was listening to all the songs from this rate, I was torn between this song and I Kissed A Girl, and then I thought fuck it, I give Katy too much praise. So, I will let Britney have her time to shine. This song is such a banger, if this song doesn’t get you laid, idk what will.
 
**AnimationJava** (10): Probably one of Britney's most iconic hits ever, I forgot how catchy and boppy it is.
 
**animefangrant62** (10): [This song is pop royalty.]
 
**CarlieScion** (10): this is on my running playlist lmao
 
**frogaranaman** (10): Gays are always walking to the beat of Britney Spears, which is why they go at a faster pace than straights.
 
**jimmy345960** (10): Wow this song is great and the music video made me realize I like men and women! We stan this video Britney Spears and Joseph Khan.
 
**JunkyGS** (10): One of Britney's catchiest songs. Idk why The Gays™ give this song shit.
 
**MissyBee37** (10): I knew I loved this song and I still forgot just how good it is. P.S. There's some serious feminine & feminist energy in this rate!! I love this total call-out on shitty, womanizing men. Get it, Britney! This song is so catchy. Also, "Lollipop - you must mistake me for a sucker," no joke, is an amazing lyric. Seriously!
 
**piccprincess** (10): womanizer woman womanizer youre a womanizer oh womanizer baby youre a womanizer baby you you you are you you you are womanizer womanizer womanizer
 
**skargardin** (10): Come thru pop perfection!
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): that sound at the beginning... iconic
 
**1998tweety** (9.1): Circus was always my personal standout from the album, but this bops too.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): I remember one of the first music videos I saw on the internet was the one for this song. My innocence was decreased that day. And I introduced to a bop and became a fan of Britney’s music from this era!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): when this went from like 96-1 in one week, oh wow, an icon
 
**J\_Toe** (9): found out from r/popheads that this song is in a 12/8 time signature, and that's cool.
 
**Raykel** (9): They don't make trash bops like this anymore
 
**tooshorttoofast** (9): iconic
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): For better or for worse, this was Britney's career resurrection, moving away from the messy days of Blackout to this sassy, straight to the point electronic pop rant where Britney directly calls out an idiot using her distinctive Southern drawl. It held an impressive record for obtaining the highest jump on the Billboard Hot 100 in a time long ago, later beat by Kelly Clarkson, and this success is why most people consider it an memorable revival of Britney's prospects in pop music after an era where the promise she used to show seemed closed to breathing its last. As a song, I do appreciate how ridiculous, campy and fun Womanizer is,, giving us different rhythms every other segue that one can't help but sing along to. However, despite everything that it does right, Womanizer also has blaring electronic backup tracks that are hard to miss with headphones on. It doesn't feel nearly as polished as songs off albums like In the Zone, either, it's a track I respect, but not one I love.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (7): lily allen did it BETTER
 
**original\_doll** (6): I actually really enjoy this song but can admit that Britney's delivery here lacks impact in some ways, and the bridge is lame lol
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Manizer
 
**gannade** (3): This was very annoying when it was on the radio
 
**lilacsweetener** (3): Still remember how disappointed I was first time I heard this. The nasal vocals, the repeated chorus and the general nothingness of the lyrics. It sucks.
 
**tapdancingpig** (3): ...Look, I know this is controversial, but this is probably her weakest lead single. Yes, including the one with Madonna that everyone forgot about. The song isn’t BAD by any means and the hook kind of sticks, but the rest of the chorus doesn’t do much for me and there isn’t a lot more to the song. I love a good bridge, and let me just say that THIS BRIDGE SUCKS!

Shippy 8: the lyrics are cringe but this is great for dance
 
**twat\_brained** (9.8): This is the closest Beyoncé will get to pop perfection. Fucking @ me on this, I will fight
 
---
**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Some of her live performances of this song are fantastic, and I wish we got an extra studio version based on some of those as well
 
**CarlieScion** (10): :kimbryell:
 
**gannade** (10): I miss the days of pop music when a generic bop like this still managed to climb the charts. It’s a really simple song, but the basic melody is so catchy that it ends up making the entire song memorable despite the lack of complexity. And beyonce lowkey serves one of her best vocals here.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): I think this is one of Beyoncé most underrated songs (out of her hits). This is such a bop
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (10): yessss the nostalgia
 
**jamesfog** (10): I love Beyonce's best song
 
**JunkyGS** (10): One of Beyonce's best songs ever. All other opinions are factually wrong.
 
**lilacsweetener** (10): Has aged well, but the production could've been
 
**Pearl Louise** (10): R.E.M. who? A true nighttime bop that gives me flashbacks to second grade. Everything about this song makes me want to have a slumber party.
 
**AnimationJava** (9): Did not know this song was by Beyoncé but I remember hearing it while growing up and I love ittttt.
 
**animefangrant62** (9): [This song is dope. One of 2 Beyonce songs I like.]
 
**followingfreeways** (9): woah!! I didnt realize I knew this song until the chorus!! good shit
 
**ImADudeDuh** (9): the fact that i first heard this song through a kids bop commercial... yikes
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (9): this is my favorite beyonce bop, truly
 
**1998tweety** (8.9): Wow another iconic bop, this really was her best era. I actually didn't know this song was Bey so I was pretty shook listening to it.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8.5): This song was fucking EVERYWHERE, at least in the US and UK. Like, it was a top ten hit and all that, but that doesn’t reflect how much I heard it. I’m not sure I’ve ever listened to it of my own volition before now, but I was able to sing every line correctly. THAT’S how ubiquitous it was.
 
**frogaranaman** (8): I can be ur angle.,.. or yuor devil
 
**MissyBee37** (8): Oh I forgot about this song! It's a pleasant surprise, though. Her voice on the bridge is especially pretty.
 
**piccprincess** (8): sweet dreams are made of peas
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): One of the few truly acclaimed songs and singles from Sasha Fierce is Sweet Dreams, which has a lot of things going for it. It wouldn't sound out of place on any Beyonce album adjusted for production, showing her best traits and covering up most of her flaws. Further benefiting it is a stellar hook, playing with Bey's flair for the dramatic. The problem with the song, however, consists of the background noises accompanying Beyonce's singing. Her voice is edited too obviously sometimes, and different parts of the backing track may tend to clash. All in all, unfortunately, this downgrades the song from being amazing to being decent. If you want to appreciate the creativity otherwise put into it, make sure not to set your headphones at max volume. It's easy to get distracted by the dated production elements if you don't.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): u can be my angle or my debil
 
**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): it took me a long time to realize i fucking hate this song, it doesn't bop at all and shows zero talent

Shippy 7.5: i liked this song but madonnas vocals are REALLY quiet and its hard to hear them. Justin was great on it.
 
**twat\_brained** (9.4): Hot take Justin's hair in this video is worse than his ramen hair from NSYNC. Also I can't think of a good Timbaland song after this release. After this it became officially clear he would stay in the 2000s. Those horns just can't be beat!
 
---
**TragicKingdom1** (11): i was not expecting this to be a legit 11 contender for me. the beat is fucking INCREDIBLE; the horns work so well and Justin x Madonna is a dream combination for me.
 
**1998tweety** (10): Wow what a bop. JT and Timbaland are talented kings for sure. Maybe its the nostalgia, but this is still one of my fav Madonna songs.
 
**animefangrant62** (10): [this song is ICONIC]
 
**frogaranaman** (10): Well, that was 4 minutes of being a slapper.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): Timbaland knows how to produces bops, and this one of more iconic ones. Madonna and JT play off each other well, and it’s just a lot fun. The music video kind of weirded me out though.
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (10): I love this song!!
 
**J\_Toe** (10): everytime "four minutes" is mentioned in casual conversation I bust out lyrics from this song, and have done for the past ten years, lol I'm basic.
 
**jimmy345960** (10): This is a hit that I remember humming to when I was in the closet.
 
**lilacsweetener** (10): This has aged very well, the chorus is an event in itself.
 
**piccprincess** (10): Cant top this song also I want JT to top me just once
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): a bop
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): this song... you could say it's not that good, but it's freaking iconic and everybody knows it
 
**skargardin** (10): Timbaland snapped with this one!
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I forgot how much I missed Timbaland my god
 
**JunkyGS** (9.5): Bippity. Boopity BOP. Still mad they didn't make the song exactly 4 minutes long.
 
**amacaroon** (9): Except for the whole hesitating theme, this is more a Timberlake/Timbaland song than a Madonna song. They should collab again
 
**CarlieScion** (9): this is such a good song but i really just wish it was exactly 4 minutes long
 
**hikkaru** (9): iconic horns, Timbaland did that. JT's charisma jumps out and the chorus is super catchy, a song deserving of being one of Madonna's last hits
 
**original\_doll** (9): this song is pretty great but I've always thought the intro was so unnecessarily long, it's almost minute into the song before we even hear Madonna...
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): I have not heard this song in such a long time and I forgot how much of a banger it is
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (9): nelly furtado died for madonna's sins.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Wow, this is such an improvement over Candy Shop! I'm not a huge fan of Justin Timberlake or Timbaland, even if I respect how solid their output can be, but the melody and production here are so infectious and energetic that it's hard not to appreciate how alive the music feels, which is one of the qualities Hard Candy lacks, in the first place. Madonna's feature is also memorable, if brief, and in a rare moment for this era she actually sounds like she's interested in...wait, what? This is a Madonna song? She's not just a special guest? Justin and Timbaland are the featured artists? Not her? Ah, I see... *throws commentary in the trash*. Anyway, my point still stands: this is a solid track, with top-tier performances from the guys, but hardly any Madge in it at all. That just feels wrong. This is a Madonna song. Shouldn't the queen reign as much as the rest, if not even more? Have things turned democratic? Was Madonna voted out?
 
**rosecoloreds** (8.5): out of sentiment
 
**followingfreeways** (8): this intro is too long, it's lucky it's iconic or else
 
**kanyewestrep** (8): good track, but i would be lying if i said it was not because of Timberlake, Timbaland and DANJAHANDZ
 
**selegend** (8): It’s so amazing how EVERYTHING about this song works. I miss Timbaland.
 
**MissyBee37** (7.5): Wow, this intro is long! I don't remember it (and it probably wasn't on the radio edit?). But this song is still fun. Madonna & J.T. are a great pair in style.
 
**AnimationJava** (7): I gave it a higher score than I think I should've because of fetus Justin and environmental awareness!
 
**Pearl Louise** (7): An iconic collab (at least for popheads’ standards). As someone who is not the biggest fan of Madonna, this song is tolerable compared to the rest of her work.
 
**perfumevee** (7): I have never been a big fan of this song but it's better than I remember.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7): I like a lot of this song. The “tick tock” reminds me of Perfect Lover, so it has been effectively prevented from getting any kind of low score, and I like Timbaland and Danja ~~even if they’re kind of wasted here~~. However, the chorus doesn’t work for me and the lyrics feel very... charity single like. And that’s not a complement.
 
**wailordfan\_** (6): They would've had more time in their 4 minute song if they didn't complain about having just 4 minutes during their almost 1 minute long intro. Unacceptable.

Shippy 10: i mean! can u blame me for giving this a ten when its beyonces best song
 
**twat\_brained** (9): u/shipsinker22 can we shitpost that video of the fan screaming the note before the last chorus at Beyonce's concert? As for Queen Bey herself she sounds flawless here
 
---
**1998tweety** (10): My most vivid memory of the song was at the last school dance of the year when I was in grade 8. One of my friends in grade 7 had a crush on a girl in my grade, so me and a bunch of others set them up and got them to dance to 1 song together, which was this. She ended up not liking him back but was nice enough to slow dance with him to one song. Looking back it seems super cringy, but it was cute at the time.
 
**AnimationJava** (10): Iconic, that's all I can say. I watched my cousin marched down the aisle on her wedding to this song.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): 😔💕😔
 
**followingfreeways** (10): I have a distinct memory of my mom singing this song into her hairbrush getting ready in the morning for work when I was younger. happy memories attached

**gannade** (10): It is pretty basic and I wish Beyonce realized she had other ballads not named Halo, but I can’t help but enjoy it each time.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): talented, brilliant , incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (10): Another contender for my 11
 
**jimmy345960** (10): great song, had this on repeat in 2014
 
**lilacsweetener** (10): Is it possible to get sick of this? Nope.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Kelly Clarkson was shook!
 
**Pearl Louise** (10): A beautifully iconic ballad. Ryan Tedder made the right choice giving this song to Beyonce.
 
**piccprincess** (10): Already Gone kinda a bop!
 
**PuggleMaster** (10): [All I can think of is Bey singing this to the little girl in australia really sad ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_UBu_-wOuw)
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): One of my favorite early Beyoncé songs (pre S/T). She sounds perfect and it’s both catchy and affecting.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (10): yes.
 
**J\_Toe** (9): (((top anthem)))
 
**kanyewestrep** (9): great song, makes me very nostalgic
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I don't think I'd be very wrong if I called this the best known ballad from Sasha Fierce, because I've heard it play in every restaurant I've visited regularly at least once. For that reason, I may or may not find it easy to dismiss as 'that one Beyonce song that people like to cry to from 2008'. Listening to Halo, though, I find it hard to continue being annoyed at its omnipresence on Sunday lunch hours for very long. Halo features some of Beyonce's best solo vocals at this point in her career, going for an ethereal, heavenly feel that prevents the song from being trapped in one particular time period or trend. Bey's delivery is warm and powerful, exceeding all expectations and acutely capturing an impression of reconciliation. My favourite tidbit about it is that soon after a certain someone's passing, Bey changed some of the chorus lyrics to 'Michael I can see your Halo/I pray your music won't fade away'. I can try to groan and complain about this one, but I can't find anything to actually dislike.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): [i love beyonce](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/747/624/5f4.jpg)
 
**MissyBee37** (7.5): I wish the track behind her vocals was prettier because Beyonce is great, the melody is pretty, the lyrics are beautiful, but this song just feels so cheapened by a generic synth track. I want a lush instrumental. The piano parts are lovely but otherwise... Meh.
 
**selegend** (6): This is peak mom pop
 
**hikkaru** (4): a snoozer tbh
 
**animefangrant62** (3): [I don’t care for the production or the vocal delivery. It all just comes together to create and incredibly boring experience. I want to give it a 1 but that wouldn’t be allowed and honestly I can’t explain to someone properly why I don’t like it as I can the others.]
 
**JunkyGS** (0): I HATE this song. Holy shit it honestly feels like torture listening to it and idk why. Maybe it was because I was so fucking over exposed to it when it came out, but I actually get anxiety when I hear it. Nope Nope Nope. No thank you.

**twat\_brained** (9): Popheads, this is what happens when you Get the Party Started for too long and you become far too desperate for it not to end. Let this be a lesson to you.
 
---
**gannade** (11): One of the best songs ever made. UGH
 
**saucymac** (11): As an Aussie I obviously had to give P!nk my 11, and this song is everything
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (11): I SAVED A PIE NOTHING CAN TOUCH ME (in all seriousness it is just pink's best song, possibly ever. icon and legend)
 
**amacaroon** (10): The end is pretty similar to Vitamin C’s Graduation ending
 
**CarlieScion** (10): i never think of pink as one of my favorite artists but damn all of her songs r soooo good
 
**frogaranaman** (10): You know, I never realized how many pure unadulterated bops P!nk had until now.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is the best sober song, and this is a fact.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): I SAVED, A PIE
 
**jamesfog** (10): Love the lyrics
 
**jimmy345960** (10): I love how vulnerable I feel when listening to this song
 
**JunkyGS** (10): "I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth" Thanks for this drag Pink.
 
**kanyewestrep** (10): i love this song. very good lyricism and songwriting, and a nice beat from DANJAHANDZ and the two other guys
 
**selegend** (10): what a KILLER song. that chorus rattles every bone in my body.
 
**wailordfan\_** (10): Imagine being THAT bitch in 2008. Pink truly did everything with Funhouse.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Pink might just be the queen of delivering constantly good empowerment anthems, firmly making her snatch the title of one of the most beloved 'mom pop' artists of all time. Competing with this decade's Try in terms of popularity, Sober is often described as one of Pink's most powerful works, combining her grand, blaring vocals with production as bombastic as a ballad can get in today's music scene. Despite all the musical elements it has going for it, Sober's true power lies in its lyrics, that exhibit a masterful shift between comfort and insecurity, proving to be surprisingly introspective for a mainstream pop hit. Its central themes might seem old today (Selena and Lorde have recycled it, both to high-quality results) but a careful listen reveals that Pink adequately handles a risky metaphor in order to deliver a classic 'enjoy being yourself' message that avoids sounding typical or forced. This is good as a cool big sister gets.
 
**Pearl Louise** (9): A really good song both lyrically and vocally.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (9): If you locked me in a room with only this song and Lorde's Sober on repeat... I'd be okay with it
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This chorus is so real, felt like the edgiest and most damned shit I’ve ever heard on the radio back in 2008.
 
**1998tweety** (8.6): /u/gannade has made some points
 
**AnimationJava** (8): Another classic bop!
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): Violins and and emotion? In my good sinful Danja song? This song in general is kind of making the subtext of So What (that all of the fun she’s having is masking her sadness) bold text. Also: if anyone here still thinks that Danja is a one trick pony, take a good look at this.

Shippy 9: i have really weird memories attached to this song that i cant exactly remember and its infuriating and been driving me crazy but anyway this is my moms favorite pink song
 
**twat\_brained** (10): Pink used to have such a great "give zero fucks" attitude. What happened? I blame motherhood. This song proves you can channel all your frustration, however petty it may be, into a song and still have it sound flawless.
 
---
**ImADudeDuh** (11): She fucking snapped so hard on this and she didn't have to!
 
**AnimationJava** (10): This was one of the first P!nk songs I really jammed to, and it will always be iconic to me.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): I DONT WANT YOU TONIGHT :KIMBRYELL:
 
**followingfreeways** (10): my best friend growing up always sang "guess what, im having more fun, than I ever before done" and that's just the way to sing it now
 
**frogaranaman** (10): I honestly don’t think I’ve heard a harder pop song in a decade when compared to “So What”.
 
**gannade** (10): Pink defined in one song, which is amazing.
 
**jamesfog** (10): Iconic
 
**jimmy345960** (10): Honestly this is a guilty pleasure and I lived for this at twelve.
 
**JunkyGS** (10): Classic!
 
**Pearl Louise** (10): An iconic bitch banger. Whenever I hear it, I have a sudden urge to go wild. The inner bitch in me comes out when I hear it.
 
**poppinmmolly** (10): a BOP
 
**skargardin** (10): This goes off each and every time I LOVE it.
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): This was the first P!nk song that I really fell in love with. P!nk has always struck me as the most human pop star, and this song is large part of that. She’s giving her ex (well, not really...) the finger, but she’s also giving us the clear subtext (well, to the extent that P!nk does subtext) that “I’m miserable and hurt.”
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): One of the rare pop songs that feels infinitely raw, teeming with energy and rage, and nobody else but P!nk could nail this.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (10): ugh it really is that bitch
 
**wailordfan\_** (10): A classic, legendary, iconic, show stopping tune.
 
**1998tweety** (9.5): Wow this is such a bop, I remember hearing this all the time when I was younger and getting pumped up.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): A classic
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9): it feels like this song has always existed
 
**TragicKingdom1** (9): a BIG bop that is underrated lyrically. step aside Raise Your Glass or Get The Party Started, THIS deserves to be Pink's signature song...it sums up her personality so well
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The first Pink song I ever listened to still holds up today, although, as expected from any pop rock hit from last decade, the mixing is kinda bad and the production ends up sounding really noisy. (At least as it's not as bad as One of the Boys!)Though one could be a little annoyed at Pink blowing a raspberry in the track's last five seconds, the rest of the song goes off hard. Not attempting to sound even remotely mature, Pink gives us delightfully campy haughtiness straight from her own mouth as she shades everybody from her then-ex husband (good news, they eventually reunited) to Jessica Simpson with her petty yet witty lyrics. This is a great crowd-pleaser, and it's likely to stay that way.
 
**piccprincess** (8): So what I’m having more Funhouse
 
**Raykel** (8): This was way more intense when I was young but it remains a bop
 
**lilacsweetener** (7): What is her issue with Jessica Simpson lmao
 
**MissyBee37** (6.5): I rated this song mainly on how much I like the chorus, because I think the verses are annoying & cheesy. Not my thing. But the chorus rocks, and I love the badass, empowering, anthemic feel of it.
 
**selegend** (3): i always thought this was annoying

Shippy 8: i havent heard this song in SO long and its so nostalgic (also FUCK twats comment below)
 
**twat\_brained** (9.6): I love the guitars and just how much of a jam this is. I bet this song was how Britney felt for much of the 2010s ;)
 
---
**hikkaru** (11): SHUT UP AND PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS :kimbryell:
 
**1998tweety** (10): Oh wow another 10. The lyrics aren't super complicated on this song; I think Katy is describing a relationship where you both take risks and it either pays off huge in the end or you lose big time. Again, I really love Katy's loud vocals on this song, It bops hard.
 
**black\_velvet\_** (10): One of her most underrated and overlooked singles. This is such a fun song.
 
**followingfreeways** (10): A BOP!!!!!!!!!
 
**frogaranaman** (10): This shit went wild at Coalchella.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is honestly one of Katy’s best songs, and one of the most underrated pop songs from the decade. This is pop perfection and I will come for anyone who thinks otherwise.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): God, an underrated gem of a song (even though it hit 9) if only this made it to number 1 instead "I Kissed a Pandering"
 
**jimmy345960** (10): One of her best songs of her discography and a really good story in such a short song!
 
**JunkyGS** (10): The ultimate "I don't like Katy Perry, but I like...." song when she came on the scene.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i actually wanna go to Vegas, but im scared of hearing stories about how homophobic the place is
 
**piccprincess** (10): Major ~~key~~ bop alert
 
**PuggleMaster** (10): THE INTRO UGH HER MIND LEGEND
 
**rickikardashian** (10): Pop perfection. The music video for this was this is amazing ~~and got robbed on the videography rate~~. I have loved this song since the first time I heard it, and back then I didn't even know English
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This probably has the best lyrics of any Katy Perry song by a mile, it’s just buckets of fun and has such vivid imagery, truly one of the greatest pop songs of the millenium.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (10): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, not afraid to reference or not to reference, buy ASIB on blu-ray, put in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, win the oscars
 
**tooshorttoofast** (10): one of the triple bops on this album along with IKAG and Hot n Cold
 
**wailordfan\_** (10): The easiest 10 in the rate imo outside of Taylor's stuff
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Sometimes I find it a little sad that I think Katy peaked with this song, since it's one off her first album, but on the other hand, it's hard not to agree with this pop rock classic being her all-time greatest single release. My throwback radio was understandably fond of playing it, which made me appreciate Katy much more as a teenager who used to think lowly of pop music. This is one of Katy's first songs where everything comes off natural and genuine. Reminding you a little bid of Teenage Dream in a rockier format, Waking Up In Vegas says it all as it captures a hectic yet memorable mood you can only find roaming around the streets of a bustling city on Monday noon.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): SHAKE THE GLIIITTER (she threatened to play this when I saw her in las vegas... she didn't)
 
**ulikejazz** (9.5): Even though it’s best with the music video, I didn’t realize I liked this this much.
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): This song has one of Katy’s only production credits. Yay her! But also, this song is great! It’s a great fusion of her rock and pop sides.
 
**perfumevee** (8.5): A better song than I remember it being.
 
**AnimationJava** (7): Probably the most forgettable track of the ones chosen for this rate from One of the Boys, but it's still undeniably a bop!
 
**Pearl Louise** (7): Iconic single from the album. However, the way she sings “baby” makes me cringe. Hopefully she performs this song live again.
 
**MissyBee37** (6): The music video is so much fun. But the song itself is just not one of my faves? I still don't even know how to articulate why but it's never been one of my faves, which is rare because I am so unapologetically in love with Katy and 99% of her discography. But not this track. It's fine?
 
**animefangrant62** (3): [Katy is still listening to Paramore it seems]

**Overall average**: 7.210

okay sis i was actually very pleasantly surprised with this album!! Im not really a mariah fan and i dont like a lot of her music but these songs actually really bopped
 
---
**TragicKingdom1**: This album is pretty standard Mariah will a sprinkle of 2008 flair on top. It doesn't represent a lot of artistic evolution but it does have some bops. I am struggling to think of anything else to say about it. [Grade: B]
 
**AnimationJava**: I have yet to listen to a full Mariah Carey album all the way through, but I liked most of her songs in this rate so I think I'll give all of E=MC^2 a try!
 
**itsnotrelevantt**: I have never, ever listened to this album but Touch My Body is my god damn song. Me, in middle school or whenever… that’s MY SONG.
 
**J\_Toe**: lol I remember my brother being so mad at the title of this album around the time it was released!
 
**perfumevee**: I'm a long time Mariah fan but this was one album that I've probably listened to the least for whatever reason. I've owned it since its release but didn't spend a lot of time with it. Definitely time for a revisit!
 
**letsallpoo**: this is highkey the best album in this rate. the hagphobia needs to STOP!
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: This is a strange pick for what I call Mariah's most underrated album. Instead of a record with deep, introspective lyrics like Butterfly or Daydream, it's a very poppy, very late 00s project full of tracks that sound like long lost hits glittered with forgotten guest rappers galore. E=MC^2 isn't groundbreaking or innovative as much as Mariah's 90s work, of course, but my honest opinion is that it makes for just as solid listening. Though it was originally conceived as a sequel to Mariah's previous comeback album, I honestly believe the album eclipses it in terms of cohesion and quality, if not popularity. Another underrated aspect of it is Mariah's voice; it reaches the best heights it'll have to offer in the 21st century here, sounding pleasant and unstrained yet still energetic. I'd seriously call this one of her best releases, and it deserves just as much attention as its predecessor.

Shippy 10: ugh oh my GOD i cant explain how well this fed me as a closeted gay and it still holds up
 
---
**twat\_brained** (11): I'm like the ringleader, I u/calltehshots 😘. I only realized last year that she's saying, "I run a tight ship" instead of "I wanna touch you". Welcome inside my rock, this is where the magic happens. Also can we talk about the choreo? I need to learn it. While we're at it, let's also talk about how great an opener this was on the Circus Tour
 
**frogaranaman** (10): I’m gay.
 
**gannade** (10): One of the best songs ever made. This is a guaranteed extra 3 minutes on the treadmill whenever it comes on.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): Just a really good pop song in general. I think it was one of first favourite pop songs.
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (10): My favorite off of this album and totally iconic. Contender for 11.
 
**jimmy345960** (10): I always tell my kinda self absorbed friend to listen to this song because he is self absorbed. It works.
 
**JunkyGS** (10): "There's only two types of people in the world The ones that entertain, and the ones that observe" Iconic AF
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): uh-uh-uh-uhu
 
**1998tweety** (9.6): One of my fav Britney songs, this song is such a huge bop. And its pretty easy to sing to.
 
**lilacsweetener** (9): I feel like this has been forgotten which is a shame, it has everything a great pop single should have and is classic Britney in ever sense.
 
**MissyBee37** (9): The pre-chorus makes this song. Chorus is catchy, sassy verse lyrics are great, but damn that pre-chorus is on point. Extra points for the whip sound effect.
 
**piccprincess** (9): another slut drop bop
 
**Raykel** (9): The new girls don't even have the breath control for this
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): I hate Mr. Lukasz Gottwald. I hate him with a passion. I hate his alleged plagiarizing, body shaming, cocaine snorting, supposed raping ways. But that man can write a fucking BOP! I guess I should be glad that this wasn’t the uber successful lead single (even though it peaked at #3), but this would have been a better mission statement and a better SONG than Womanizer.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (9): honestly, this should have been the first single.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Greatest Showman who? The princess of pop really does seem like the ringleader of a circus here, cracking her whip to make a hit where she exhibits a voice of innocence leading into with temptation and carefully placed double meanings. Britney's performance here proves that the girl's truly back at the top of her game, showcasing enthusiasm that the less organic tracks on the album lack. Her skill makes you feel like she's directly addressing you as you listen, demanding to know whether you can handle her or whether you're too scared to face her power. And, honestly, you'd be excused for admitting to the latter option, because there's definitely a keen, ferocious energy and sense of identity here that her post-Blackout songs had an unfortunate tendency of skipping out on until she released Glory. What makes Circus the most beloved anthem from its title record is that, despite all the setbacks she experienced in 2007, the song ultimately proved that, without a doubt, Britney was still here, and that she was here to stay. How's that for an iconic comeback?
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda iconic Just Dance song
 
**Pearl Louise** (8): There’s only two types of people in the world. Ones who like this song, and the other deaf hoes who don’t. Iconic bop.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoscyA86n9o
 
**AnimationJava** (7): bop!
 
**CarlieScion** (7): liiiiiiiiiiike a cihcuhssss
 
**PuggleMaster** (3): Circus has always been one of my least favorite britney singles (Work bitch is the worst)

twat_brained: # I Am Sasha Fierce
 
---
 
**Overall average**: 7.384
 
---
 
i feel like this album had iconic singles but eh otherwise its a good album but didnt have anything special for it
 
---
**TragicKingdom1**: Despite launching the Sasha Fierce persona, this album is Beyonce at her most faceless. The majority of the songs sound like they weren't written with Beyonce in mind (because they weren't) and although Beyonce objectively shows talent, it is diluted by the dull production and songwriting. I'm glad she traded Sasha Fierce for Queen Bey starting with the 4 era because her output has been much better since then (including Everything Is Love, haters can stay pressed) [Grade: C-]
 
**AnimationJava**: I was actually extremely surprised how much I liked all of the songs in the rate off this album, I can understand how many people see this album to be one of Beyoncé's best.
 
**itsnotrelevantt**: I love some songs, hate others… Never really got the whole Beyonce obsession thing in society woops.
 
**J\_Toe**: I like Beyonce, but more here music from 4 onwards.
 
**MissyBee37**: TIL I think I like Beyonce best when she's Sasha Fierce.
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: No Beyonce era is truly forgotten by the general public, but although Sasha Fierce produced a decent amount of chart-toppers and awards show controversies in its own right, you'd be hard-pressed to find anybody who actually adores this point in Bey's career. In sits in the middle of her creative growth, trying to adapt to emerging pop sounds and trying to signify artistic maturation. Unfortunately, as a project, Sasha Fierce fails to satisfy most music fans. Ostensibly a concept album, the record squashes songs into one of two sides based on which persona they're supposed to line up with, which makes the track arrangement feel bloated and poorly planned out. What doesn't help matters is how obnoxious the production seems on songs like Video Phone, tainting your listening experience. I feel like the entire record is a failed bridge in Beyonce's career, with a few noteworthy songs that elevate it from being a complete disaster. Though she'd eventually master the art of the concept album, Bey's ambition just falls flat on Sasha Fierce. Skip this one and go straight ahead to 4, which is a much superior album despite its lack of story.

twat_brained: # Hard Candy
 
---
 
**Overall average**: 6.626

I like Madonna and all, id even call myself a big fan. I had no idea this album *existed* until this rate. and i wish it stayed that way, because it is NOT good.
 
---
**TragicKingdom1**: This is the most surprised by an album I have ever been going into a rate. I was expecting a complete mess with shitty electro-slutbops but instead I was served Pharrell and Timbaland genius. I'm sure the Madonna stans were disappointed with this because it's completely out of left field for her but the production is absoletely superb, aging better than not only the majority of this rate but also a lot of Pharrell and Timbaland's most renowned works from this time period. It keeps a high level of tension throughout and switches up the production enough that I can vibe with it without being bored. It does futuristic way better than Discipline and slutbops much better than Circus. I'm not sure if I would have ever checked this album out if it weren't for this rate, which would be unfortunate for me because it is now my favorite Madonna album. [Grade: A]
 
**AnimationJava**: This was the first time I've listened to any Madonna song that wasn't her biggest hit or "Bitch I'm Madonna", maybe I should listen to her older stuff because this didn't really click for me.
 
**itsnotrelevantt**: I haven’t listened to anything but the biggest hits from Madonna. What is with this album and have normal, cute songs and then randomly changing them up in jarring and weird ways?? Madonna this album is garbage I’m sorry sweetie
 
**J\_Toe**: My favourite Madonna albums are Ray of Light and Confessions. Let's see about this one.
 
**MissyBee37**: This whole album just kind of fell flat for me? Like it's all fine, but none of it gets me too excited.
 
**tapdancingpig**: Sometimes I forget that Madonna is a GREAT lyricist. This album, messy as it is, reminded me of that fact. Also, I generally like Pharrell, Danja, and Timbaland, so even when all else about a track fails, at least they’re there to give it something good.
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: I still maintain that, not including her soundtracks, MDNA is the only Madonna album where Madge actually resorts to chasing trends. While she attempts to try out 00s RnB here in a not completely successful manner, there are still flashes of brilliance here that make the album wasted potential at worst. Unfortunately, it is wasted potential. Instead of continuing a solid streak of albums, Hard Candy becomes a bit of a worse Let's Dance as it falls off a little into coming off as manufactured. The biggest problem about the album isn't that it's not unoriginal, or that it's lacking in catchy hits. Though there are quite a few missteps within the music itself, there are still enough redeeming elements included for me to praise Hard Candy's songwriting and production. The biggest problem with Hard Candy is, quite frankly, Madonna herself. I don't see any effort in her performance, vocals or delivery. She sounds bored out of her skull throughout most of the album. What's worse is that the songs here are some of the best Hard Candy has to offer. Its flaws shine much more in its lesser output, and that compels people to declare it Madonna's second worse album of all time. The album doesn't fail because it was too ahead or behind the times, or because higher-ups and collaborators ruined it. The album fails because of Madonna herself. For such an innovative and iconic artist, it makes me very disappointed. At the very least, I'm just glad the blackface cover never happened.

twat_brained: # Funhouse

**Overall average**: 8.161

pink... GIRL, I WAS SO SHOCKED to find out that this is one of my favorite albums(i mean, set of six songs) in this rate. I am SO sorry for doubting u u absolute GODDESS
 
---
**TragicKingdom1**: I remember not liking this album back in my youth but it surprisingly held up, even outside of the singles. The ballads are pretty strong despite Pink not being known for them, and the production is varied but without any wild risks that don't pay off. Ultimately, it's one of the two best albums in this rate. [Grade: B+]
 
**AnimationJava**: I didn't realize until listening to Funhouse how many iconic p!nk songs came from it!
 
**itsnotrelevantt**: I honestly kind of hate a lot of Pink’s singles from how overplayed they are and how much my mom loved them so I’m super duper biased here but I’ll try to rate them based on how good I think they are and not how much I hate listening to them!!! I love Funhouse the song, though, it’s my favorite Pink song.
 
**J\_Toe**: I wish I Don't Believe You was part of the rate
 
**tapdancingpig**: I feel like I need to listen to this whole album to form an opinion on this. Honestly, So What and Please Don’t Leave Me are highlights of the rate, but some of these tracks are just fucking messy.
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: I don't know much about Pink, to be honest. Her cool rocker girl vibe was very last decade for me upon my first introduction to her music, and I resisted the urge to check her songs out even if I enjoyed hits like So What or Try. Owing to her status as a mom pop artist, I never got pressured to actually check her discography out. The songs in this rate may have convinced me, though, that Pink can be actually fun. I'm still not the biggest fan of her image or music, simply because I don't really feel attached to the confident pop rock she often releases, but reading into Funhouse's background and hearing some of the best songs off it proved to me that even if Pink seems like an ordinary superstar today, she still must have sounded pretty fresh to a lot of pop fans in the 2000s.

twat_brained: # Circus
 
---
 
**Overall average**: 7.875
 
---
 
ive heard every song on this album way too many times but anyway this is an underrated album in britneys discography. ive seen it get a lot of hate from gays and ive never understood it, it has AMAZING songs. and it holds up way better than blackout... which honestly sounds terrible nowadays lol. anyway, i would put circus in the top three britney albums in my rankings.
 
---
**TragicKingdom1**: Britney sounds dead on this album and it ranges from mindnumbingly annoying to mindnumbingly boring for 80% of the runtime. Some songs are really good but the lows are really, really low. One of the worst albums we've ever rated. [Grade: D]
 
**itsnotrelevantt**: I pretty much love every song off of this album.
 
**MissyBee37**: This album is a strong, strong showing from Ms. Britney. It's no "Oops!...I Did It Again," but we can't all be perfect pop albums. So many fun songs, though!
 
**tapdancingpig**: Honestly, this is one of my least favorite Britney albums. Like, it’s not THE worst, but there’s SO much filler and lackluster stuff. The good is very good though. This is pretty much the one album that I think benefits from being cut down to 6 tracks, even if these weren’t the 6 I would have chosen.
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: I always viewed Circus as a weird album in Britney's discography, even if it was the one that ended up paving the way to her comeback. Released barely a year after Blackout, the Britney of this album still comes across as less involved than ideal, although she does sound a tad less messier. The tracks off it do tend to be catchy, harmless plain pop fun, despite the terrible lyric here and there. But what holds the album back from being a classic like her previous ones is the production, which perfectly fitting 2008 and slowly becoming more abrasive as time goes on. Also, as much as I hate to admit it, Britney only sounds emotionally and mentally invested in a few songs here. She sounds near lifeless on others. That doesn't surprise me, considering how stressed out she must have been while recording this, but you can hear her starting to get less and less personally involved in her music beginning with Circus, a trend which reached a nadir with Britney Jean and started thankfully fading away with the release of Glory. In short, while Circus may be an ultimately successful collection of catchy songs and spectacular singles, it hardly does anything for me. It's gone down in my ranking of Britney's releases.

Shippy 10: okay LOOK i like this song more than love story and im sure thats not controversial at all but i do remember long ago, back when youtube was good, and replaying this music video so fucking much man. i had an actual crush on taylor swift AND her love interest and thinking back, i probably shouldve been realized much earlier that i wasnt gay or straight lol i was both. ANYWAY, a truly incredible song
 
**twat\_brained** (9.2): BEDADENSHECAN. More importantly, I'm also on the bleachers. Team Bleachers, that is! Give "Don't Take The Money" your 11s in the 2017 pop rock rate. Either that or "Hard Times". "Fake Happy" also works.
 
---
**napsandnetflix** (11): i fucking love this song and i was in like my friends cousins car with her and her parents and i was in the back seat and this song came on and i was like oh SHIT but i barely know these people so i'm trying hard not to bop but i ended up bopping and they could tell i was into it so they turned it up for me and then they went off to it too and i became really good friends with my friends cousin that day and hangout with her more than that original friend and i'm facebook friends with her parents and honestly it's all because of you belong with me so thanks taylor i have a new friend cause you served up a bop so big i couldnt hold back
 
**1998tweety** (10): I don't know why but I never connected with Love Story the way I did with this song. I love that it continues the storybook theme between Love Story and White Horse. I know that this song is the female version of a “nice guys” song, but I still like it. Its such a tune and I have fond memories to it.
 
**AnimationJava** (10): Another iconic smasher from Taylor Swift, she copied Mariah Carey in acting as the villain of her own music videos.
 
**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Lyrics are pretty terrible, but it's a great song despite that
 
**CarlieScion** (10): this is also an 11 tbh
 
**followingfreeways** (10): god this rate is revealing how im such Taylor trash ... but.... I was a band geek and all the guys I liked dated cheerleaders in school so this was my theme song in school *insert nerd emoji*
 
**frogaranaman** (10): https://i.imgur.com/88tZkAD.jpg
 
**jamesfog** (10): A classic
 
**jimmy345960** (10): A men liking men anthem.
 
**MissyBee37** (10): A perfect pop song? I think so. Interestingly, like another song in this rate ("One of the Boys"), it's just such a perfectly teenage song. I love little details like how she changes it up on the line, "You say you're fine; I know you better than that."
 
**original\_doll** (10): iconic! nothing else needs to be said
 
**piccprincess** (10): The transition from Love Story to this on the rep tour was godly and now when I'm singing in the shower I do it automatically HELP
 
**rickikardashian** (10): My dream is to be very powerful and famous one day, and when that happens, I'll make sure I become best friends with Taylor and convince her to DO A FUCKING STUDIO VERSION OF THE RED TOUR VERSION OF THIS SONG GOD. It's easily one of the best live performances she has done, and I want to listen to it and actually listen to her and not just yells of fans having panic attacks while she sings.
 
**rosecoloreds** (10): she really snapped on this one
 
**tooshorttoofast** (10): this goes out to all my straight crushes
 
**amacaroon** (9): This was the only song on my iPod for the longest time. Actually it might still be the only song on iPod.
 
**J\_Toe** (9): The lyrics and story are questioning but the music bops
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Sometimes I relisten to this and I think 'hey, this is corny and the mixing is terrible. It's not good. Why do people like this?' Then, the song builds up starting the first chorus, and by the time I'm rooting for Taylor to show up to prom like in the video and wreck the dark-haired queen bee that looks mysteriously like her in a wig. Is this a song she's obviously grown past? I mean, probably. I don't think this is something most of us end up relating to after high school. There's also a Madonna-Whore complex here that comes off as immature at best and sexist at worst. But even if you could call it the quintessential 'old Taylor' anthem, despite how much its writer and its audience have grown over the years, there are plenty of us who still recognize how much of a classic this is. It's not her best song by any stretch of the word, but it still proved to the world that Taylor was a bonafide hit machine in the making, and that she'd be heard by many for years to come. Also, it's cute. End of story.
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): I docked a point because this is the Nice Girl™️ song. It’s still absolutely delightful, though. The chorus is still among her catchiest, the bridge is everything, and the lyrics are too sweet to be considered truly problematic. I only docked one point because, while the trope is annoying as fuck and destructive as hell, it’s clear that Taylor is just fantasizing and isn’t saying any of these things to her crush (*cough* Shawn Mendes *cough*).
 
**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): I don't like that she's criticizing another woman but I can understand the sentiment. Also, it's catchy.
 
**gannade** (8.5): you belong with memes
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://media.giphy.com/media/SlI3RYXnUAkPm/giphy.gif
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): my view on this song changed completely when someone pointed out this is the female version of Treat You Better
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (7): she wears short shorts, I wear sneak sneaks, she's cheer cap-cap, and i am on the bleach bleach
 
**Pearl Louise** (6): I know how some call this one of Taylor’s most iconic songs, but when you compare it to her more pop songs like Shake It Off and Blank Space, it just does not do the other songs justice. Sorry.
 
**PuggleMaster** (5): [This highkey outsold ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5bL5mZk8hk)

Shippy 10: okay ik its basic as fuck to give this a ten but like COME ON MAN, it deserves it. one of the best songs in the 2000s and a defining moment for taylors career.
 
**twat\_brained** (10): Taylor's cutest and most endearing single. In fact, I can see this being a prequel to Red in many ways; a love that Taylor and her s/o felt incredibly passionate about while those surrounding the two felt a strong anti-passion, certain their love wouldn't last. Their dismission would prove correct, as Red was recorded in the key of E, much like the end of Love Story. Furthermore, Love Story makes prominent use of the Four Chords of Pop, unlike Red which only uses a three-chord structure through most of its runtime, making the song, much like Taylor's heart, feel incomplete in comparison to when she was still in a relationship with her ex. In fact, it probably goes even deeper than all this. I need Swifties to help me piece this together. I should also learn this on guitar.
 
---
**animefangrant62** (11): [It was a really difficult decision as to whether my 11 went to this or YBWM. However, the part that sent this one over the edge was when it hits "And he KNELT to the GROUND and pulled out a ring and said 'MARRY ME JULIET, YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO BE ALONE'" and I actually died.]
 
**CarlieScion** (11): that key change, the country-popness, the lyrics, the production, the EVERYTHING came to slay
 
**frogaranaman** (11): Me: Ugh, I’m over Taylor Swift. Her music has gotten really dull. | Also me, crying: AND DADDY SAID, “STAY AWAY FROM JULIEETTTTT”
 
**jimmy345960** (11): That key change and her beginning long live this 18 year old retelling of classic tragedy. It puts a positive spin on such a sad story and that's how I hope to view life. So 11.
 
**piccprincess** (11): Absolute iconic timeless unproblematic bop
 
**skargardin** (11): The best key-change in the history of key-changes right here
 
**static\_int\_husp** (11): Probably Taylor's most well known song. The key change near the end is amazing, and the lyrics are something I still have memorized a decade later. Truly a modern classic
 
**tapdancingpig** (11): Pop perfection. This was the one song of hers I liked before ~~I got taste~~ We Are Never etc. happened, and I can’t blame myself for that (well, that’s not true, but at least I recognized some perfection). She wrote this on her own and co produced it WHEN SHE WAS ONLY 20.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): https://cdn.skim.gs/image/upload/v1456338597/msi/key-exchange_ub7yjq.jpg
 
**tooshorttoofast** (11): goat key change
 
**AnimationJava** (10): ICONIC! This song will always be THAT bop, one of my earliest memories of Taylor Swift.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Gay Life Hack - If you change the words to "heard youre a prince, lets go and be princes," and "juliet" to either "never met" or "don't you fret" when dad/romeo says it, you can make this a gay anthem, and also it makes the post chorus on the second chorus so much sadder.
 
**jamesfog** (10): A classic
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): how could anyone hate this innocent song?
 
**MissyBee37** (10): This song is quintessential early Taylor. I just adore how she took such a classic, tragic story and twisted it to give it a happily ever after. The original story is timeless, and Taylor gives it a refresher that is sweet, romantic and beautiful in lyrics and music. Also the melody and music are both absolutely gorgeous.
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): [2] @ white horse comment
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This is such a memorable song, I think this song (and You Belong With Me) really propelled her towards a more pop sound (which I think was a good decision).
 
**1998tweety** (9.4): Usually I'm not a huge fan of songs that rely too much on existing stories that everyone knows, but for some reason this works. I think its the way Taylor say “its a love story, baby just say yes”. Its aware that this is a common trope, but thats fine cause sometimes its really the best way to convey a message. I also love this thing Taylor does where she switches the last chorus in the song, something she later does on Speak Now for example.
 
**followingfreeways** (9): am I fake Taylor fan if I think this song is ridiculously overrated? lol but it's still good so it's a 9
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): There is at least one literary debate regarding a popular song for every decade in pop culture. For the 80s, it's whether 'shamone' is an actual word. For the 90s, it's whether 'Ironic' is actually ironic. For this decade, it's whether 'now that I become who I really are' is an acceptable breakaway from grammatical rules or if it's an inexcusable violation. And for the decade before, it was Love Story. Sorry, that sounds pretentious. Anyway, I just brought these things up to tell you that the Romeo and Juliet references here aren't mistaken because, guess what, people, Taylor's trying to create a subversion by giving the story she's describing a happy ending. Rant over. Now, let me actually talk about the song itself. I listen to Love zstory much more than You Belong With Me, and I think that's because for all the desperate optimism and naivety in this track, it still manages to be pretty amazing. Maybe we just like going back to the point in our lives where we thought that everything was going to be alright and Romeo was going to pull out a ring after all. (God, this is such an overwrought comment. I regret writing this. My apologies.)
 
**hikkaru** (8): I get that she was a literal child when writing this but come on I really would like to think at that age I knew that Romeo and Juliet was so incredibly played out. Disregarding the topic though I can't give this song anything below an 8 because her knack for hooks is just that good and the key change DID THAT
 
**kanyewestrep** (8): good song
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): using romeo and juliet as an example of a successful romance is :yikes:
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): kinda boring tbh...
 
**selegend** (7): ugh this got white girls around the world SHAKING
 
**amacaroon** (6.8): Apparently there is some controversy about who said a line at the end of Romeo and Juliet. My Shakespeare professor thinks Taylor Swift got it right when she said “I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress” aka that maybe the parents were going to reconcile for the sake of their children before the stupid teenagers killed themselves. Anyway, that’s why were played Taylor Swift in my literature class.
 
**Pearl Louise** (5): I know I have already said this, but most of Taylor’s country stuff does not impress as much as the stuff she has put out now. I am more used to the pop Taylor rather than country Taylor. This song is an epitome of that.
 
**black\_velvet\_** (1): I usually more or less enjoy her stuff, but I hated this song with passion the minute I first heard it almost 10 years ago. Her voice sounds flat and the lyrics are giving me 3rd place winner in 4th grade poetry contest.

Shippy 11: nnnnnnnnn im SORRY im not TRYING to give katy such high scores but holy FUCK these songs are just so fucking good. i remember the music video for this song playing CONSTANTLY on television and even tho its a little dated it doesnt take away from the song. its crazy thinking of how she made a song like this and then a decade later she makes bon appetit (another good song) because she has really strayed from this album and sometimes i wish she'd return. anyway, this is not only one of my favorite katy songs but one of my favorite songs ever and i HOPE that if this full album ever gets rated, it comes out on top. i have a lot of great memories attached to this song. singing to it with my sister, screaming it at school dances. its just a really fucking amazing song.
 
**twat\_brained** (10): Absolute megahit, top 3 all time Katy song. When she performed this on the California Dreams Tour and did all those costume changes? That was a classic, that was a classic.
 
---
**1998tweety** (11): Funny story, I always thought she said “you be a mess” instead of “you PMS”. I also heard “stuck on a rollercoaster”, as “staccato rollercoaster” and was pretty confused. This is easily one of Katy's most iconic songs, the video is everything. Again, I love the rock edge to this song. This is my 11 cause it bops the hardest out of all the other songs on this album.
 
**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Literally triggered my pop awakening. Despite me thinking pretty poorly of Katy's musical abilities after I Kissed A Girl, the one-two punch of this and 'Vegas' are probably the biggest influences on my musical tastes today
 
**jamesfog** (11): Pop perfection, a classic.
 
**AnimationJava** (10): One of my favorite bops to listen to growing up! The nostalgia is real with this one.
 
**frogaranaman** (10): The song that defined straight weddings for years to come.
 
**gannade** (10): Katy’s best song
 
**jimmy345960** (10): Great song, while still affected by this whole man up attitude, its not enough for me to actively hate the song.
 
**JunkyGS** (10): bop. bop. bop. bop.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a timeless bop
 
**Pearl Louise** (10): A bop! This song is so boppy and catchy, it comes to no surprise why this is one of Katy’s many signature songs. It’s just a bummer that it never hit #1 in the US.
 
**piccprincess** (10): BOP BOP BOP
 
**rotating3Dtext** (10): imagine when new generations discover this
 
**selegend** (10): yes one of the best songs of this century
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): Probably my favorite Katy song to this day. She’s still got her rocker edge, but she’s got Max Martin and crew on her side. The lyrics are a little problematic (“GOT A CASE OF LOVE BIPOLAR!”), but the song is catchy as fuck, Katy sounds awesome on it, and THAT BRIDGE!
 
**TragicKingdom1** (10): katy's 2nd best song behind teenage dream
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Katy honestly had great bops in this era, and this one of my favs.
 
**MissyBee37** (9): This song is just pure fun. A Katy classic for a reason!
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I love a nice lyrical contrast in a pop song, and Hot n Cold, a track that gets associated with zebras, PMS, and controversial episodes of Sesame Street, is chock full of them. While I Kissed A Girl may have been Katy's first single to make its mark on the general public, this is generally the song off One of the Boys people will recognize the most, and the reason for that is because it's another testimony that Katy's songs are catchy as hell. The beat plays in with the parade of opposites, culminating in a song that you'll likely bop out to, even if you're not Katy's biggest fan. Elmo wants to play with Miss Katy!
 
**animefangrant62** (8.5): [classic pop right here]
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Note: my middle school teacher at the time said she used this song to teach her child what the opposite of things were, truly Katy is a master educator and for the children
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): better than IKaG, change my mind
 
**wailordfan\_** (8): The verses aren't in a great key for Katy, but damn if the chorus doesn't go the FUCK off.
 
**J\_Toe** (7): This song has an ironic value for me. I watch Boku No Hero with my brothers and initially struggled to remember the character's names. So to "help me remember" I would call Todoroki Katy Perry, because of this song :).

twat_brained: # Fearless
 
---
 
**Overall average**: 8.190
 
---
 
okay....so. im sorry swifties, but fearless is my least favorite taylor album. even behind self titled. i love tayor, my second favorite artist of all time, but this album just really bores me and its the one that i revisit the least. I wouldnt call it a bad album, but its not for me. THAT BEING SAID, the best songs on the album were chosen and the iconic singles are actually legendary, so it has that going for it.
 
---
**TragicKingdom1**: (copy and pasting from the countryheads rate of this album) Probably my favorite Taylor album, although it's still flawed. At points, her artistry is on full display and I can fully understand how she attracted such a large fanbase, because her emotional songwriting connects. There are still songs that feel too sappy, melodramatic or lacking in momentum, which were my main problems with Red. I don't think it was a bad listen at all but it definitely could've been refined. [Grade: B-]
 
**AnimationJava**: The most iconic album of 2008, beating out all of these other girls for AOTY from the Grammies. Taylor was the youngest woman to win AOTY, and to this date it's still her best-selling album. Some of her other music I like much more, but there's no denying that Fearless shaped her career.
 
**itsnotrelevantt**: I love Taylor’s early albums.
 
**Bajuko**: Her fake country accent is so grating
 
**J\_Toe**: I've only started listening to Taylor this year because of the praise she receives on this sub. I must say, though, I prefer pop!Taylor.
 
**tapdancingpig**: This has never been my favorite Taylor album. There’s a lot of really amazing stuff in here, foreshadowing her peaks in songwriting, but there’s a lot of stuff that just don’t like. All of that stuff got cut out, though, so throughout the rate I’ll just seem like the perky Taylor stan I am.
 
**jimmy345960**: So, here we are. Her beginning. Why didn't I listen to this back in 2008? I will never know. I would have loved to be a fan of hers during the Speak Now era, which I missed :(. Anyway this album is full of classics, y'all left out You're Not Sorry which is one of my favorites off this album. When I say Yee, you say Haw. Yee
 
**rickikardashian**: I can't wait for Taylor to lose this rate too because this dumb fandom will split their 11’s with Love Story and You Belong With me and have both end in like #6 and #3
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: This used to be my least favourite Taylor album. Now, I'm a little more nuanced in my ranking of it. It has really high highs, including all of the songs in this rate, plus a couple more, and...well, not really low lows. Just kind of boring songs like Hey Stephen or Tell Me Why that belong more on a playlist of leaked rejects from her self-titled days than anywhere else. Despite that, though, there are so many moments on the album worth listening to that it's kind of hard not to fall in love with. I can see why this acted as the floodgate for Taylor's fame to gush into. It's an important record for her, even if it isn't perfect, and, artistically, it was a critical stepping stone for her to develop her career further and eventually release one of the best three-album streaks in pop music I've heard of. It might not be a masterpiece, but it sure is full of some of them. You'd better believe that it's the most acclaimed album in this rate for a reason.

twat_brained: # One Of The Boys

**Overall average**: 7.712

okay im sorry im a katy stan so i obviously went into this with a little bias but thats because this is such a fucking stellar album dude. Katy started her career off really well <3 this album has huge huge memories attached for me, singing and dancing with my old sister before going to school, something we still talk about whenever hot n cold or i kissed a girl comes on, so ill always love this album just for that
 
---
**TragicKingdom1**: This album really falls apart in its second half, but has some bops that redeem it. I like it more in theory than execution for the most part. One thing that is consistently on point is Katy's aesthetic this era, which I think compliments the music nicely. This isn't the worst album we've ever rated but it's not worth revisiting outside of a few songs (although those aren't even THAT good other than Hot N Cold.) [Grade: C]
 
**AnimationJava**: I will admit I'm biased with One Of The Boys because this album was mainstream when I was growing up, it's something that makes me nostalgic but has still aged pretty well.
 
**itsnotrelevantt**: I obviously know the singles but haven’t listened to anything else on it.
 
**J\_Toe**: I don't like Katy. That will show in my scores here.
 
**MissyBee37**: Ah, the original Katy Perry. It's my least-favorite of her albums, but I think that says a lot about how great her discography is, because it's such a solid, fun and personality-filled debut. This selection of songs is a strong showing from it, too. I'm crushed that "Lost" isn't here in all its devastating glory, but I digress. Katy's debut may be different from anything else she's done, but it still has so many of her charms -- it's funny, quirky, flirty and unabashedly Katy. I love it. I love the more rock-like sound for her.
 
**tapdancingpig**: This is a weird album. I had seen gossip site rumors that Katy hates her music and wanted to be an indie rocker, and this album kind of lends a touch of credibility to that rumor. She’s a lot more rocker-y, even on the Max and Satan tracks, and she has more of a musical identity here than she ever really will again.
 
**jimmy345960**: So I needed some scalding hot tea coffee for this album now I gave this album (7 songs) a 5.6 and I am trying not to be biased. It's just that the songs we choose are haunted by a certain attitude that really gets under my skin. The "feminine bitchy" male definitely exists and should be called out but this album is not helping anyone. Using gay as a slur and the "be a man" attitude really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Anyway, Hot n Cold and Waking Up in Vegas are pop royalty.
 
**twat\_brained**: I'm gonna relisten to the full album just to see how it shapes up 10 years after its original release, just to see how it compares to Teenage Dream: Complete Confection and Prism. Having all of the songs representing this album indicates to me that it is completely front-loaded, however. Or at least, they're the most well-known tracks.
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: I don't try to sort out my feelings on Katy because when I attempt to gauge whether I like her or not, I get more than a little confused. I love a lot of her individual songs, and my unpopular opinion regrading Witness being an actually good album isn't actually an uncommon one at all. Still, the lady has a lot of flaws that I find hard not to spot, and those flaws are evident on all of her albums. One of the Boys is a little rough around the edges in the sense that it occasionally has awkward lyrics, and, like Fearless, the mixing on some songs leave a lot to be desired. However, for all I could nitpick about the era, One of the Boys does show that Demi isn't the only pop girl that could try incorporating a little more pop rock into her music. Say what you want about its more questionable aspects, but songs off One Of The Boys like Waking Up In Vegas and Hot N Cold do show that Katy has enough talent to impress you at least once or twice. The songs included in this rate represent the record well, for better or for worse, and despite the wide difference in how well they're regarded, at the very least, they give us a balanced view of Katy's true debut.

animefangrant62: She may not have won the rate, but Fearless had the highest album average. Katy is more of a singles artist so her winning the rate makes sense. But Taylor has the superior album and honestly that's all that matters. 

All these girls with their quick little singles.
