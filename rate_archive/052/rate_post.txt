Hi and welcome to the [**2008 Super Mega Deluxe Ultimate Rate**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/396894234164199428/485507836336537601/XtFxneg.jpg) hosted by The Three Muskequeers; /u/shipsinker44, /u/twat_brained and me. For this rate we will be rating 8 albums from [mega pop stars](https://imgur.com/a/cqGztKL) to [skinny legends](https://imgur.com/a/i0ZrgFU). The rate includes:

- **Janet Jackson - Discipline**

- **Mariah Carey - E=MC^2**

- **Madonna - Hard Candy**

- **Katy Perry - One Of The Boys**

- **Pink - Funhouse**

- **Taylor Swift - Fearless**

- **Beyoncé - I Am... Sasha Fierce**

- **Britney Spears - Circus**
 
8 albums is a lot so that's why we are only rating 6 songs from each album (Beyoncé and Katy have 7 in order to make a 50 song total) that yall lil cuties voted for to be in the rate over the last few weeks.

#Here Are The Super Sexy Rules

- Listen to each song and assign each a score **between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots. This means that giving a 7 is fine! Giving a 7.5 is fine! Giving a 7.55 is absolutely out of the question!

- You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11**. By one, we mean that this is **one song total, not one song per album**. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results and is very annoying! 

- You have to listen to and rank each song!

- Your scores are not confidential!

- If we suspect you from intentionally giving certain songs or artists low scores for the sake of sabotage, I will not hesitate to tell you to clarify or change your scores!

- Your scores can be changed at any time! Just PM the corrections to /u/shipsinker44!

- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Like this:

###THIS IS THE CORRECT FORMAT TO SUBMIT:
>Ur So Gay: 11 I cannot vibe with queers

###THESE ARE WRONG, LITERALLY ANY FORMAT THAT IS NOT LIKE ABOVE IS WRONG:
>Ur So Gay: 11: I cannot vibe with queers

>Ur So Gay: 11 - I cannot vibe with queers

>Ur So Gay: I cannot vibe with queers, this gets my 11

>Ur So Gay: eleven I cannot vibe with queers

###You can also comments on the albums as a whole by adding a colon after the title:

>Album: E=MC^2: outsold Einstein

###Don't do it like this or anything that's not like above

>Album: E=MC^2 outsold Einstein
