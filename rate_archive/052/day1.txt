oh my god gays LIGHTEN UP!!!! katy has already shown herself to be a gay activist (and this wasnt any different back then, shes always supported us, but it was a different time!). I fuckin adore the production on the song and her vocals and hey, maybe this makes me a bitch, but i thought the lyrics were hysterical. yall take this WAYYYYY too seriously, the song is a joke lol. anyway, good song!

**twat\_brained** (10): You know what? I liked this when I was younger and even though I don't like it as much now, I'm giving it a 10. Unlike the rest of you who are gonna sabotage this for having a poor message. But guess what? We didn't have to rate this to begin with. The point of the song votes was to vote for the song you wanted to rate. Why in fuck's name would someone willingly vote to want to rate Ur So Gay only to give it a 0 when we rate it? You can't have this both ways.

**frogaranaman** (0): An 11.


# AUTOASPHYXIATED FASHIONISTAS

**1998tweety** (10): Usually you have to defend your reasoning for giving a song a 0, but this time its the opposite. Before you all call me homophobic I'm gonna actually agree with you and say that Katy is being homophobic on this song. Whether shes doing it intentionally or not ultimately doesn't matter but the overall consensus is that she does say some shitty things in the song. I could interpret this song as Katy never actually saying theres anything bad about being gay but there are a bunch of implications that she makes so ultimately it would feel disingenuous to take that approach. So the song is homophobic but why would I give it a 10 despite not being homophobic myself. Well just like how lots of people will be giving this a 0 based solely on the fact that the lyrical content is homophobic, I'll take a different approach and give it a 10 for how well its written. Katy doesn't say the f-slur once and yet this song is still way more savage than lots of Eminem songs. Each diss is masterfully stringed together, building off of each other. Katy looked up every stereotype about gay guys and added them to this song. Wearing makeup, reading (?), being vegan. A lot of the things listed in this song arent even seen as feminine, what exactly makes feminine? Anyway, Katy mentions everything little thing about this guy in an attempt to emasculate this guy, but why? She feels that he doesn't care enough about her, he cares more about his looks than hers. Hence where the title comes from, Katy is calling him gay because hes in love with himself. She also brings up that hes fake and isn't open and honest with her. Everything about this has awful execution. Being fake with your partner isn't a good thing so I see why Katy is angry about that, but dragging him for being feminine and insulting gay guys was not the best way to go about that message. We know now that Katy loves the LGBT community and takes back these homophobic words, so I can tell that she doesn't approve of this message. I do give Katy the benefit of the doubt though, she did come from a very Christian background so thats why the messages of this song and IKAG are so controversial. Ultimately this song has shitty lyrical content, so I just take a different perspective to enjoy it. Thats not for everyone so I completely understand why this song will get a bunch of 0s.
 
**JunkyGS** (10): This song will probably be the first song gone, but this song (to me) is so fucking hysterical and really a good relic of its time. It is also the song that introduced me to Katy ALLLLLL the way back in 2007. Like I can't think of a song that is such a total take down drag of somebody. Hip Hop artists who like to beef should hit Katy up for some cowriting cause this goes IN.
 
**MissyBee37** (10): I know popheads is going to tear this song to shreds, but I want to be one voice in its defense. My take is that the narrative is about one specific ex who is too self-absorbed and too obsessed with what the rest of the world thinks of him to care about Katy/the narrator half as much as he cares about keeping up this identity he's made for himself that comes across to her as entirely fake, counterculture and superficial. I think this song ultimately comes down to the lyrics "Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you" and "I wish you would just be real with me." He gets off on embodying this persona that she's calling BS on. I think within the context of the song, the often criticized lyric about how he has "nothing there" underneath his pants is not meant to be literal, but more illustration of how empty he is behind this fake persona. She has no idea who he really is because he isn't being real with her or really connecting with her. Does she take it too far in concluding that, based on all of these stereotypes that he aspires to, he may be gay and hiding it either from her or even himself? Maybe. I know many feel that way, and that's understandable because it's a personal interpretation what her intention was and whether the end result is offensive. But I think this song is meant to be tongue-in-cheek and playful. Is it sharp & biting in its humor? Yes. Is it homophobic? I don't think so. What I love about the song itself is the playful nature, the humor and the sheer attitude. She's so over this guy & she's not afraid to let it show with all the sass in the world.
 
**PuggleMaster** (10): Pressed faggots can be mad that she read us it's still a 10
 
**hikkaru** (8): I lowkey love the lyricism of this even if the topic and message are absolutely horrible. Are there any opening lines as iconic as "I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf, while jacking off listening to Mozart"? I don't think so. "You're so sad you should buy a happy meal, you're so skinny maybe you should supersize the deal" these are some of Katy's best - Chinese Water Torture is shaking. And the good sis really did expose all the sad art hoes "Secretly you're so amused that nobody understands you" GO OFF! This is definitely one of my most "guilty pleasure" bops, but I can't in good conscience give it anything higher than an 8 just because of how toxic the message of femininity in men being a bad thing is (and utilizing the word "gay" to insult this feminine male that is the topic of the song).

twat_brained: # POINT MISSERS
 
**rickikardashian** (7.7): This is problematic and offensive, I can't admit I kinda bop to it
 
**gannade** (7): @ all the stupid annoying twinks of popheads
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): sigh

# UR COMPOSITION IS SO GAY
 
**animefangrant62** (7): Lyrically sharp and pretty damn funny, but not the most enjoyable to listen to

**CarlieScion** (6): now, this song is #problematique but my bigges issue with this is katys vocals, the weird censoring, the whistling in the chorus and the production

**wailordfan\_** (4): yes blah blah blah controversy, the issue I have with this is that it comes across as the 'let's be controversial to be controversial' except without the great sounds of I Kissed a Girl. The whistling is also really shrill sometimes because it just goes on throughout the whole song.

**poppinmmolly** (2): I will cut her some slack because this is 2008 and people definitely still talked like that but the fact that this was her first single is a choice and very yikes. The song is not that good musically and people only like it because they think the obtuse lyrics are funny.

# THIS IS A GAYS ONLY EVENT GO HOME

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): For an artist as loud and ferocious as Katy Perry, Ur So Gay is an oddity, even removing the discourse around it from the equation. Ignoring its traumatic music video, the song is soft and lowkey, incorporating elements of rhythm and jazz onto a track with pretty damnable lyrics attached to it. As much as we can find valid reasons for defending I Kissed A Girl, there's unfortunately not much to decipher here. It's a legitimately homophobic track, and while I enjoy elements of the production, the song as a whole isn't quite memorable for me to excuse myself and say I like it. Katy whispering 'penis' at the end makes it even worse. Who on earth asked for this?
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): This song is so 2008...and it was problematic then, and still is problematic now. Her vocals sound great though. Also her saying penis at the end is kind of iconic. This song is such a mixed bag I honestly don’t even know what to think lol
 
**napsandnetflix** (5): i have no idea what to rate this so an unbiased 5 it is!
 
**Raykel** (5): This just had to be catchy
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): The most real injustice in this song is the song title
 
**original\_doll** (3): yeah this song is super problematic but yall know 'I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf' is a clever line
 
**selegend** (3): i know it’s supposed to be satire but like.. it’s not funny
 
**tooshorttoofast** (3): why katy why u were doing so well sweetie
 
**ulikejazz** (3): i’m not even gonna comment on this, brb getting some popcorn
 
**skargardin** (2): A stain on an otherwise great discography. Deserves to go out first.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (1): yikes lmao
 
**jimmy345960** (1): I wish I could give two zeroes. This is probably going out before my actual zero, get your reading glasses out girls.
 
**AnimationJava** (0): Using gay as an insult oof, that aged poorly sis.
 
**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): For some reason whenever I read the title of this song I just hear in my head the chorus 'You're So Vain' with only that lyric replaced. I like to keep it that way, since the less thought about the actual song the better

**itsnotrelevantt** (0): oh boy. yall.
 
**J\_Toe** (0): why was this her first single and why did Madonna praise it?
 
**Pearl Louise** (0): As much as I love Katy to death, I have to put the foot down when it comes to homophobia. On behalf of fairness for al, the other songs in this rate, I will be giving this song my 0. I no way want to call Katy a homophobe. Times were different back then. However, if a song like this were to come out today (no pun intended), it would be bashed apart by this subreddit. So, in fairness for the other songs I am rating, this song, in my opinion, shall be getting a zero rating.
 
**perfumevee** (0): This is truly awful.
 
**piccprincess** (0): This is so fucking problematic holy shit Katy lmao
 
**static\_int\_husp** (0): Man, the lyrics on this aged worse than I remember
 
**tapdancingpig** (0): “I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf/While jacking off listening to Mozart.” So starts one of the most problematic songs I know that wasn’t written by an actual hate group. It also contains the laziest chorus she’s ever written. If you’ve ever doubted the wonders Max Martin and crew can work, here’s what “before” can look like.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (0): stop the meme this needs to die
 
**TragicKingdom1** (0): no

# ROCKING ON MY WAVELENGTH
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (0): i rarely give 0’s, but this song deserves to die on a hill. This song managed to be homophobic and skinny-shame at the same time. She really did THAT! But seriously, I feel like people only voted this in so that they could give Katy their zeroes and that’s the tea. 🍵

im so sorry janet stans but this might actually be one of the worst songs i have ever heard

**twat\_brained** (8): Janet doesn't need 3 minutes to get me turnt, that's a great quality in my books

# JANET BETTA BRING THE HEAT

**JunkyGS** (10): Hearing this song for the first time was one of my most distinct "gay awakenings". Listening to this song just feels right and when I discovered many years later that it was one of the gay JanFams™ favorite deep-cuts I knew I was with my people. I about died when Janet started doing a mash up of this song and throb on her latest set list for the SOTW Tour. I wish I could describe why I love this song so much, but it just goes off and is so fun to sing / dance to.
 
**letsallpoo** (10): ended sophie
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): The chorus vocals me of Nudity by Kylie Minogue. Therefore, rating it anything less than an 8 would be a sin.
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (8): This is immediately good. It’s weird but fun to listen to.
 
**perfumevee** (8): Another one that is super odd but I like the beat.
 
**PuggleMaster** (8): I think I liked this i'm not honestly sure
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Legally Blonde is shaking
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): this is one of the best songs on the album yet it features like 10 seconds of janet's voice, i feel like some producer did her dirty
 
**wailordfan\_** (8): K yeah this is probably my favorite on this album, but she has so much odd vocal modulation, 2018 is shaking.
 
**AnimationJava** (7.5): Janet low-key sounds like Britney on this track, but I like the line that goes "I can do what she can't do."
 
**selegend** (7): This beat is amazing

# NO SHE BETTA DON'T
 
**ignitethephoenix** (5): I used to have some Betta fish. My first one was named Leo and he was a gorgeous fish, but he only lived for a year. My next one was named Lucky and he was much luckier and lived about 3 years. I miss my fishies.
 
**Pearl Louise** (5): Nice beat and production, but it’s too repetitive for my liking.
 
**piccprincess** (5): Her transitions are literally flawless but these songs are honestly such a mess
 
**followingfreeways** (4): oh
 
**tooshorttoofast** (3): i hate her voice in this
 
**ImADudeDuh** (2): ok the vocals on this are real annoying
 
**frogaranaman** (1): This sounds like the kind of music my assaulter would like.
 
**jamesfog** (0): This is trash!!!!
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (0): Literally what is this song supposed to do? It's even minutes long, full of bad vocal editing and other strange production choices, and a Daft Punk sample nobody can actually praise Janet for with a straight face. Why on earth did this get voted in? Why the hell is it even on the album at all? It's a real pain to listen to, owing to just how unpleasant and unfinished the entire result sounds. Perhaps the most mysterious thing about it is that most people under this one's Youtube comment section actually like it. This has over a thousand likes. One commenter even says that they like working out to this. If I worked out to this I think I would go into cardiac arrest and die on the spot. How can this be by the same woman who made songs as good as Together Again and Velvet Rope? How could three minutes cause so much ear pain?
 
**saucymac** (0): y'all vote this song in so ur so gay didn't come last?

# KIDZ FLOP

**Raykel** (7): The kid like voice kinda freaks me out but it kinda works?

**CarlieScion** (6): why does it sound like a child is singing this

**1998tweety** (4): The baby voice isn't even the only think I don't like about this. The gibberish part isn't great either and the production is annoying but at least it fits with the vocals.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): why is a 5 year old singing in reverse what the fuck am i listening to
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (1): What is going on with this baby voice, I can't handle it
 
**hikkaru** (0): wtf this song is actually horrifying? Why the demon voice background noise thing looping through the entire song it's scary!! and then the high pitched voice that sometimes comes in smh! why is it reversed sometimes? I won't be able to sleep tonight

# DIVAS

**black\_velvet\_** (10): If you don't do the Naomi Campbell walk, Naomi Campbell walk, walk across the room like Naomi Campbell, the minute it starts, what are you even doing with yo life.
 
**gannade** (10): A diva is a female version of a hustler
 
**JunkyGS** (10): Such a fun feel yourself bop. If you haven't randomly diva walked while listening to this song you haven't lived. Song still gets me fucking hyped.
 
**followingfreeways** (9): added this to my library, fuck this is great
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This song slaps, but I think I prefer the glee version (which I originally heard first ) more *hides in a corner*.
 
**MissyBee37** (8.5): The female empowerment in this song & just such confidence is so badass.
 
**AnimationJava** (8): Never heard this bop before, a bit repetitive but infectious!
 
**piccprincess** (8): Im a Im a a diva Im a Im a a diva Im a Im a a diva Im a Im a a diva Im a Im a a diva
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): This song is so obnoxious, I feel like every few days I wind up hating it again. BUT ITS ALSO REALLY REALLY FUN!
 
**CarlieScion** (7): of ah hustlah
 
**J\_Toe** (7): This album is pretty incohsive, but is that on purpose? It starts with, like, ballads? Then the middle is chart topping pop songs. Then the later tracks are heavy electro hip hop? They key hook is great though.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Too often, when people think of Diva, they think of the annoying synth voice that bleats out 'imma, imma a diva' or whatever it's trying to say about a million times in the middle of this song, which I believe is actually fun and sassy enough to be a worthwhile collection to a playlist full of the kind tracks where Bey decides to go a little more hip hop instead of staying strictly in RnB. Remove the voice and some other annoying elements in the production, and you get a track that gets stuck in your head as fast as the wind, bringing forth power from Beyonce we'll know and need later on. Thus, Diva might be hated on for understandable reasons, but let's not forget there are good things hiding in it, too.
 
**Pearl Louise** (7): A boss banger. However, the high-pitched “imma a diva” is kinda annoying and irritating.

# DIVS
 
**1998tweety** (6.6): The perfect streak had to end somewhere...
 
**PuggleMaster** (6.5): I always thought she was saying "I'm a fucking hoe"
 
**skargardin** (6.5): Well this was messy
 
**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): a milli > but this has grown on me significantly over the years, especially after seeing it live
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): It’s like self-titled but not as good
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (5): :/ I can’t really listen to this lol
 
**jamesfog** (5): No.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): The beat is annoying and the bridge isn't very good
 
**tooshorttoofast** (4): that chorus... no
 
**original\_doll** (3.5): the chorus is easily the worst part of this song
 
**frogaranaman** (3): ..what.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (3): ew
 
**jimmy345960** (2.6): yah this is …. unpleasent
 
**animefangrant62** (1): [The production, the vocal delivery and production, the lyrics, every single thing is awful and just doesn’t fit together at all. The chipmunk repetition of “I’m a- I’m a diva” in the background is aggravating. Combine that with the “ay’s” and the violins in the production just makes it more grating.]
 
**hikkaru** (1): This is so annoying, who thought this sounded good? Pitched up vocals and jarring snare makes me want to die
 
**ImADudeDuh** (1): the worst bey single
 
**amacaroon** (0): I genuinely cannot listen to more than 10 seconds to this at a time. I would rather listen to tinnitus. Kill it with fire and extreme witchcraft dead god

oof okay sis even i cant forgive this

**twat\_brained** (2.7): 1. Why did we care about video phones all of a sudden in the late 2000s? 2. Where is the Lady Gaga remix? There's no Telephone without Beyoncé, a better song and video, mind you, so there shouldn't be a Video Phone without Gaga in this rate. Not that it even touches any of Gaga's Tony Bennett duets nor Bey's Jay-Z collabs but still.

# GAYS ON FILM

**piccprincess** (10): I slut drop to this
 
**JunkyGS** (8): The chorus is kinda a buzz kill for me and song was (rightfully so) over shadowed by telephone.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Queen of AfterEffects

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): isnt a video phone just a phone

# TELL EVERYONE IT'S BROKEN
 
**AnimationJava** (6): The title and content of this song aged poorly!
 
**CarlieScion** (6): lmao swag up

**tapdancingpig** (4): The beat is solid, but the rest of the song is both boring and annoying. I always thought those were opposites, but this song proved me wrong. The harmonies around 2:20 made me boost it a point, though.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (4): girl this aged so poorly
 
**selegend** (3): THIS over Ego??? I have to laugh
 
**animefangrant62** (1): [It’s the exact same situation as Diva, every single part of the song seems to be fighting against the other and it’s just a chaotic, droning mess.]
 
**frogaranaman** (1): This ain’t it.

# A STAR IS MORE ICONIC
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): “Telephone” remains unbothered
 
**Pearl Louise** (8): Hubba, hubba! Iconic collab between two ladies who have made a huge impact on pop music.
 
**rickikardashian** (8): The Gaga version is better, and yes, I know there will be another 20 comments mentioning her
 
**yoereyesr** (8): the remix is better

**tooshorttoofast** (7): telephone > videophone
 
**1998tweety** (6.7): This isn't as bad as I remember it. I listened to Telephone and bopped to it a lot, and then went to listening to the Gaga version of Video Phone and I was so disappointed.
 
**gannade** (6.5): This video had lil me shook especially with the gaga feature. This is way more catchy than it should be but it does become kinda monotonous as it goes on.
 
**Raykel** (6.5): Beyoncé and Gaga trying to pass this off as Telephone part 2 and thinking we'd be happy lol

**J\_Toe** (6): Not as good as Lady Gaga Beyonce Telephone
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (5): I think I just don’t like these more hip hop / R&B beats on some of the songs on this album. They’re garish and hard to listen to.
 
**jamesfog** (5): Not even Gaga could save this
 
**ignitethephoenix** (4): I remember when Telephone and this game put around the same time, and I always hated this song compared to it. It’s just kinda obnoxious and not that fun. Even worse this version doesn’t even have Gaga.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): Apparently somebody really liked what the previous two songs in this rate were going for, because this tries to combine Diva's swag hip hop vibe with the terrible production on Sweet Dreams. What results from this unholy mixture is a mess than I can't enjoy from any angle. With a video featuring Gaga having been previously rated on this sub, I did not look forward to rehearing this one, and I'm forced to conclude that my instincts were right. Aside from the title being dated (every phone can afford to take videos now) you're more likely to focus on the mess trying to hold the song together than Beyonce's sultry vocals, which, while not revolutionary, are noteworthy enough to barely redeem the song from becoming downright awful.

this song never WENT anywhere, it was super unsatisfying to listen to. the like, first bridge (?) tho was really nice

**twat_brained** (1.7): What key is Madonna singing in at the bridge???? It's such a jarring disconnection from the rest of the song. And what's sad is the bassline is pretty funky. Sidenote: WHY THE HELL DOES THIS SONG GO ON FOR 6 MINUTES?? Also, what the hell is that verse from Pharrell? There's way too little going on the song. I will give Madonna some credit, though. She manages to create a filler song, which itself contains filler instrumental quatrains. Truly an innovator in mediocrity.
---
# NERDS

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): it's funky! and then Pharrell makes weird noises

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Pharrell and The Neptunes are killing it here! It goes on for WAY too long, but the production is great, and lyrics and hook are great.

# SHE'S NOT ENDING

**JunkyGS** (8.7): This song would be rated higher if it wasn't fucking 6 minutes long. Still a bop, but needs a radio edit
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.5): this started out so good, but did it really need to be 6 minutes long?

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Suprisingly long. Like a lot at the start and end of the song, but a little in the middle isn't great.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I gave this a 9 at first and i checked and it was 6 minutes and come on madonna, you don't need to make this that long.
 
**jamesfog** (7): Too long

**1998tweety** (6.9): This feels needlessly long, the song should've ended right before the guy started singing.
 
**hikkaru** (6.5): this song is too long. Otherwise has a nice groove but it's a bit squandered
 
**Raykel** (6.5): Could've been way shorter but had that amazing bridge 2 minutes in
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): This song was alright until they decided to not end if after 4 minutes and have another 1.5 minutes of useless dance stuff.

**gannade** (3): this is so long and uninteresting

# BYE BYE GUY 

**wailordfan\_** (8.5): This is fun, and the build up around the 2:30 mark is really cool, and I think this is a song that works with it's length for once.
 
**J\_Toe** (8): The song bops, but all I can remember it for is the time Madonna sung it after a Born This Way / Express Yourself medley used to shade Gaga. For that reason alone I *want* to give it a low score, but I won't.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I'm not a fan of calling Hard Candy trend-chasing, because Madonna does try to spice up 00s RnB with some of that classic Madge flavour her fans know and love. She's Not Me, in particular, is a call back to petty, pure pop Madonna, with a guilty pleasure melody combined with subject matter that would melt the hearts of biphobic gay men. She still sounds a little...nonchalant for a track where she's supposed to sound vengeful and bitter, though. This sounds more like a song to practice modelling to than an angry callout. At least I kind of feel like she's trying.
 
**Pearl Louise** (8): A bop. One of my favorite songs from the album.
 
**skargardin** (7): Average bop

# SHE'S NOT THE ONE
 
**jimmy345960** (5.5): IS THIS ABOUT GAGA? jk but its not that great
 
**CarlieScion** (5): billie eilish who?
 
**MissyBee37** (5): Meh. These lyrics feel shallow or plain. I don't like the random whistles & claps, or the long outro. Also Pharrell's verse feels really out of place?
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Beat is sick outside of the trap drums but otherwise eh
 
**AnimationJava** (4): A bit of an overdone trope.
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (4): Another weird song switch-up that ruins the song
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (4): Britney's Perfume but if Britney was like more confident in herself. full honest this only gets points for the disco-ey guitar riffs, this is hot hot trash
 
**frogaranaman** (1): Why? Why? Why?

# REBELS

**kanyewestrep** (10): strongest track on the album
 
**PuggleMaster** (10): ms jackson getting frisky at the nursing home
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (9): I can see why this song is the title song and was voted through. Love, love her voice here.
 
**JunkyGS** (9): This song is so intimate that I would bet it makes most popheads feel uncomfortable upon listening. I think it's pretty brave for Janet to be this explicit and it is a total sex jam. Since popheads is full of sub bots this song should win the rate, but yall are ALL talk and won't reward a song that speaks for your inner hoes! Also fun fact Janet had no part in writing this and Ne Yo was the one who wrote it if that helps with your mental images! I wish yall picked another song from the album to rate cause this song is gonna get CRUSHED!
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): Hot as fuck.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (9): this is a gay anthem im sorry if you dont think so but it is you who is wrong please pack up your knives and GO

**AnimationJava** (5.5): Knowing that Janet has a daddy kink and is into some rough play is kinda scary.
 
**hikkaru** (5.5): daddy...

# FIFTY FLAVORS OF VANILLA
 
**1998tweety** (7.3): This song is a bit weird and the lyrics are kind of uncomfortable. I get that its supposed to be sexy and kinky; maybe its just not for me.
 
**MissyBee37** (4): This song just made uncomfortable. I know some people are into that and I respect it but not for me!
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (4): ...oh. Well. Uh...please...can we...can we...not? Sorry. I liked how Janet explored female sexuality in her 90s albums and I'm doing my best not to kinkshame her for whatever...this is, but...to be honest, it just makes me...really...uncomfortable. Even past the, er, interesting lyrics, I'm not really impressed with it sonically. I can acknowledge that certain people rating this song might enjoy listening to it for obvious reasons (y'all nasty), but instead of sounding tempting to me this comes off as flat and almost farcical as it's accompanied by a instrumental that makes me doze off. Not a fan. If she really had to make this song, why couldn't it have been some guilty pleasure Charli-esque bop? Why did it have to be this mess of a fetish retardant?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): this is almost embarrassing to listen to i feel like i'm kinkshaming an older woman by saying that but yikes janet

# COME THRU WITH THE SHORTENER

**CarlieScion** (7): its sooooooooo loooooooooooooong

**wailordfan\_** (6): This is about 2 minutes two long. I kinda forgot this was still playing and thought it looped over again because there wasn't any kind of a build-up/pay-off.
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (2): Kinda cringy and soooo slow and long

# TEACHER'S PETS

# SHEESH

**jamesfog** (9): Back when Pharrell production was good

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): The melody really doesn’t stick, but I love Pharrell’s production enough that I’m ok with it.

# KNOW HOW TO BRING THE BITTER TASTE

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): I'm pretty much going to have to talk about this song's good points first so I don't sound like an absolute spoilsport, eh? Well, for starters, the best thing about it is that Pharell does an amazing job with the production. He delivers yet another memorable bass hook to capture people's attention, and the beat he uses is fit enough for a track as purposely vapid as this one. It's no wonder critics hated this back in 2008; in an era before poptimism and Charli stans, a song as repetitive as this would have to be really good in order to avoid sheer embarrassment on behalf of its performer. Unfortunately, it...doesn't really achieve that level of quality. The thing is, there's a difference between sounding robotic on a song and sounding flat. On Candy Shop, Madge sounds flat. She sounds like more like an impersonator than the one and only actual Madonna, and her voice contains none of the irony needed to make the track as a whole tick into your brain. It's a shame, because I'd call this song a lost classic otherwise, if only because she sneaks a really unexpected Narnia reference in the lyrics that you wouldn't expect to see on something so disappointing sultry (it's the 'I've got Turkish Delight' line, and you are absolutely never going to convince me that this isn't a reference to Edmund being offered the same sweet by the White Witch. Go on, try me.)
 
**hikkaru** (6): I guess the percussion is neat but it's kinda boring for a song called Candy Shop
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6): Fairly generic, the ad-libs at the end don't help it
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Actual candy shops remain unshaken and unbothered
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): i think i could do without madonna calling herself raw to me
 
**frogaranaman** (5): Pass.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): I've never heard "get up on the dance floor" said with less fun before
 
**AnimationJava** (4): I didn't particularly care for this song, it's too repetitive and she's not really trying to sing.
 
**Pearl Louise** (4): I don’t know how this song made it this far in the rate. It’s too basic, and I wish Madge would have added more to the song.
 
**wailordfan\_** (4): The intentional non rhyming of Store and Stop in the chorus bugs me and the bridge is so lazy

i am so far really disappointed with madonna

**twat\_brained** (9): I was just going to remark on how surprisingly well this aged before hearing that glass percussion breakdown; this was an easy 10 up until that point. Nonetheless this is one of Madonna's better efforts from the past 10 years. One of numerous underrated Madge singles
 
---
# CAUSE I'M A GIVER

**rotating3Dtext** (11): 12 year old me loved this song, don't @ me (the bridge is kinda... stupid, tho)
 
**JunkyGS** (10): SO. CRIMINALLY. UNDER RATED. One of my all time favorite Madge songs and one of her most under rated songs ever. I remember watching VH1 Top 20 every weekend and hoping that this song would stay because I was obsessed. I wish I could give this my 11, but Janet has my heart and she needs it more <3
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is so naughty I love this
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Hey, at least Madonna seems a little interested in what's going on here, right? Always look at the bright side, folks. Okay, I'll try not to roast this song so much. It's not as dumb as I thought it was, after a few listens. In her own words, Madonna imitates a boxing pose here, sounding as fierce and threatening as...well, as a diva can if she seems mildly bored, throwing punches as she dares her opponents and her lovers to come forth and face her. The production choices can be a little shocking at first, but the synths add all to the chaos and fun as the song goes on, which is as good as we're going to get when it comes to this album. Unfortunately, the reason why this isn't called the one true classic from this era is because of that middle section. To be honest, I don't know why it's there. I can assume that Madge was trying to be experimental, which I appreciate, but the problem is it goes on for too long. Interludes such as these are supposed to seem to last the same amount of time as the '...stop!' section in the iconic You Drive Me Crazy radio version, being memorable enough to give the song variety without outstaying their welcome. I'm not going to take the effort to count how long the bass and bell section takes place for here, but it feels like it lasts forever. By the time the original melody comes out again, the transition can be more than a little jarring. I'd definitely have liked the segue if it was done better, but as it turned out, I'm forced to think it's stupid. It's stupid. It's stupid. It's stupid. It's-okay, okay, I'll stop. You get the point. Wasted potential.

**J\_Toe** (7): The first three tracks on this album sound like the natural progression for Madonna following Confessions

**tapdancingpig** (7): This sounds like a love it or hate it song, and I’m not sure which side I fall on. I like The Pharrell & Neptunes Sound™️, which is prevalent here, so I think I like it more than I hate it.

# WE WANT AN ABRIDGED VERSION
 
**amacaroon** (7.9): What is that bridge.
 
**1998tweety** (7.2): This is annoying but also bops a bit.
 
**frogaranaman** (7): Minus the weird midsection, pretty good.
 
**Pearl Louise** (7): It’s good up until the end. The second half of the song just doesn’t impress me much.

**CarlieScion** (6): this would be good if that annoying fucking bridge wasnt here

**MissyBee37** (6): I really like the beat (and it's no surprise to see Pharrell in the credits; it's very much his style), but the song overall is a little dull. And long.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Give It a 6
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (6): tbh this is one of the best non-lead singles from madonna in the past like, 15 years.

**letsallpoo** (5): this would have been okay if it ended at about the 2:40 mark

**itsnotrelevantt** (2): It was good until that… cowbell… “get stupid” part???

# CAUSE I'M A TAKER
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): The production is interesting but the song is super bleh otherwise
 
**hikkaru** (5): The weird bell breakdown certainly made me "get stupid" I think it killed all my braincells and also the flow of an otherwise decent song

**AnimationJava** (2): Pretty boring if I'm being honest, I had no desire to re-listen to it.
 
**therokinrolla** (2): i did not give this score as a joke it is actually a 2
 
**ImADudeDuh** (0): this feels even she's singing this in the booth without even smiling, the "climax" was just a hi hat being played kinda faster and this is the most lifeless song I've ever heard

# NO OFFENSE TO YOU, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME

**lilacsweetener** (5): This was not Pharrell's era.
 
**piccprincess** (4): is this blurred lines
 
**PuggleMaster** (3): this sounds like Successful's ugly little cousin. I knew this was a Pharrat song immediately.

This production is NOT vibing with me at all, and just like feedback, my main problem is her vocals, which im just not a fan of.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): I won’t remember how it sounds 30 seconds after it ends but for now I'm strutting in the metro to this

#LET'S RIDE

**gannade** (10): sexy whisper queen yas
 
**JunkyGS** (10): A literal bop. Like if you don't bop and groove your head to this you have bad taste. Janet rides this beat in a way only she could.
 
**PuggleMaster** (8.5): really fun song
 
**J\_Toe** (8): The more I listen to these songs for the rate, the more I appreciate how cohesive the sound of this album is, even if it's not the kind of music I would listen to regularly.
 
**1998tweety** (7.7): Chung Ha outsold easily.
 
**perfumevee** (7.5): Not entirely sure what I think of this one. The instrumentation is odd but I still feel myself bopping.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7): Kind of like a low key version of Feedback, which works a lot less, but it’s still got a pussy popping beat, so it’s fine.
 
# I WANT TO GET OFF THIS RIDE
 
**wailordfan\_** (7): K the intro beat is deadly, and the hook is pretty good, but I don't think I like Janet's voice at all, and it is kinda a drag to listen through.
 
**jamesfog** (6): Filler
 
**Pearl Louise** (6): A sexy jam. However, it is not a rememberable song from the album.
 
**AnimationJava** (5): I found the song a bit boring but it's still pretty sonically cohesive.
 
**frogaranaman** (5): Like her emotions, this album is a rollercoaster of quality!
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Our first signs of Discipline going Downhill arrive as we listen to Rollercoaster, which is an absolutely baffling choice of a song. For a relationship that's supposed to be exciting, Janet does a pretty boring job trying to capture your attention with whatever this track is supposed to try to do. The song is slow in this irritating, tentative way that never builds up to something remotely engaging, not even when Janet reaches the chorus. She sings it in a weird accent, too. This feels more like a slowly singing pendulum than a rollercoaster.
 
**piccprincess** (5): I literally forgot I listened to this song and spaced out
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5): the chorus is really repetitive and boring. The verses are maybe okay
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (5): this is the auditory representation of the mess that is in my room.
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (4): forgettable and the guy going “oh!” in the background is really off-putting.
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (2): Production is annoying with the guy's voice in the background, melody is flat/doesn't feel like the song's going anywhere
 
**hikkaru** (1): What is this percussion askldfjdk it's so bad and doesn't work for this song at all imo. Pharrell is also shaking in his boots at the rando screaming those adlibs

# DO PICC'S RATE
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): inspired Jack Antonoff to create a song of the same name!
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Jack Antonoff is shaking

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Eric church outpeaked, Bleachers definitely outpeaked, Luke Bryan did not outpeak tho, so janet won there.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): this just sounds annoying lmao i feel bad for bleachers
 
**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): bleachers are unbothered

# u/letsallpoo's impact

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I swear I heard “You make me poo, you suck me boob” in the post chorus multiple times, so I can’t take this song seriously.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): This sounds like something that would play in a trendy urban hotel lobby. I'm here for it!

# ROC ME OUT

**JunkyGS** (10): Janet said this song was made with the the gay community in mind and that she had to do something for her gay fans. Janet said "Honestly the song was created for the gay community. I kept stressing to Jermaine [Dupri, the song's co-writer], ‘I got to do something for the kids.’ I had talked about it on the last album – and there was a song that I had, and it wasn’t quite completed. And I talked about it to the papers, gay magazines, and it didn't wind up on the album with the cut-off date. I felt really badly about that. So he just handed me a CD and said, ‘Here are 10 tracks for the kids; tell me which one you like the best.’ I fell in love with 'Rock With U'." It is the most accessible songs on the album because its a perfect mash of the futuristic styles on the album and retro at the same time.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ok this keyboard riff that goes through the song is soooo good.
 
**J\_Toe** (9): My favourite of the Janet songs on this rate

**lilacsweetener** (9): Slick as fuck.
 
**tooshorttoofast** (9): omg this instrumental gives me life
 
**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Ms. Jackson literally said that she recorded this song because she wanted to please her gays. I think it’s safe to say that she succeeded.
 
**MissyBee37** (8): This beat is everything.The vocals & lyrics are fine but that beat is *fiiiiiinnnne*.

**AnimationJava** (7.5): Finding out this song was written for LGBT people made me bump its score up a little bit higher.
 
**gannade** (7.5): why does it only say Janet as the artist here but every other song has Janet Jackson?
 
**Raykel** (7.5): She's rocking this Kylie Minogue production

# ROCK WITHOUT ME
 
**frogaranaman** (6): Surprisingly monotone.
 
**CarlieScion** (5): oml this production
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (5): I can’t help but feel like I’m succumbing to recency bias but this is boring
 
**piccprincess** (5): Also forgot I listened to this song and spaced out
 

**wanderingimpromptu3** (2): Chill and kinda catchy but too much falsetto and production is annoying
 

 **ignitethephoenix** (0): This may be one of the most repetitive songs ever, and it’s not even that fun. Also I just don’t really like Janet’s vocals here

# JANDROID
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I love those 8 bit vibes

**1998tweety** (7.1): The heavily computerized voice takes away.
 
**Pearl Louise** (6): A nice effort, but the weird robot voice makes me cringe.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (4): oh wow she really stole that title from her brother. also this the worst use of robotic-auto-tune-voice like ew
 
**wailordfan\_** (4): This GladOS feature is killer.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): hatsune miku is cool i guess nice of janet to feature her

 # OH BROTHER
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): One thing I will credit Janet for being, even if this album isn't my shit, is that she's been a very dedicated LGBT ally ever since the 90s. A sort of sequel to a track off Velvet Rope, Rock with U sounds like it could come straight from that decade. Dedicated to her queer fans, Janet uses the kind of gentle, soft delivery that many of her classic songs utilized, singing within a moonlit backing track that more than resembles her brother's acclaimed disco song of a similar name. Though, ultimately, it's not as good as Michael's, Rock with U still shows more foresight than other tracks from Discipline, proving itself to be a heartfelt love letter.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Michael Jackson is shaking

**amacaroon** (7.1): There’s almost 30 years between this and Michael’s take. It feels like a lot less, but neither sound out of place in their decade. Maybe disco is just immortal
 
**jamesfog** (7): Michael's is better

# UNRECOGNIZABLE

**gannade** (10): why is this filler so good
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.8): @ me ho
 
**1998tweety** (8.3): This album hasn't been the best so this bop is greatly appreciated.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I boosted the score in my mind the second I heard the choir of Timberlake’s around the 3:30 mark. I don’t even like the guy, but that was a great choice. The rest of the song is a bit of an overlong mess, but the lyrics are great.
 
**jimmy345960** (7.4): Honestly this is scathing and I love it
 
**AnimationJava** (7.2): Probably my favorite song off of Hard Candy.
 
**amacaroon** (7.1): It was a… choose to pair such a badass title with that weird bubble beat
 
**CarlieScion** (7): the instrumental piano part is very pretty

# THE OSCARS RECOGNIZE SEAN PENN FOR HIS LONGSTANDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO FILM
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Madonna, sweetie, please...please come back to life. Please just come back to life. You're ruining a song that could have been a classic! I'm sorry, I know this is one of the only songs from Hard Candy that people actually enjoy, and I know why that's the case. That's because the production is fantastic. I mean, seriously, sounds of softly falling rain mixed in with a gentle yet desperate electronic atmosphere? A (mostly correct) suggestion from Justin Timberlake to change the section featuring the title drop into the song's hook? Ray of Light-esque lyrics, fittingly enough for a song that Madonna had been trying to actually work out ever since that very era? Come on! This is supposed to be one of her all-time magnum opuses! But...no. This could have been Hard Candy's saving grace, but this is where she just proves the record's critics right. It has everything it needs to sound like a gift from pop music heaven, and then it all sinks down and slowly dissolves before falling apart. Not by a drastic error in the production, not by a faulty or laughable breakaway section, not by a shitty set of lyrics, but by...Madonna herself. This doesn't sound like a track that she'd been trying to ferment like red wine for an entire decade. For a song that's supposed to be the fruits of her labor, it just completely, utterly disappoints. It's still not a failure, because the other elements that stand out are really impressive, but at the heart of every song Madge releases is Madge herself. And Madge isn't quite here. She's barely present at all. It's like her voice was slapped on without any of the passion it was supposed to convey upon performing this. To be quite honest, it feels like the title is referring to Madonna herself. Even the devil wouldn't recognize an lady so capable of bringing out men's temptations if she sounded this tired.
 
**piccprincess** (7): sad bop
 
**Pearl Louise** (6): Kinda forgettable, but it’s not too bad. I just wish her vocals were more unleashed. In this song, she sounds like she’s holding herself back.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (6): the devil: "whomst? ugh we unstan sis"
 
**wailordfan\_** (6): This kinda sounds like a potential Reputation album cut, and a bad one at that. If this weren't so damn repetitious, there are some really cool elements in the song. The male harmonies near the back third of the song and instrumental break is so cool and sets a really great atmosphere, but for the most part it is just a stale song lyrically, and madonna doesn't deliver great lyrics.
 
**perfumevee** (5.5): There is too much happening here.
 
**skargardin** (5): This ain’t it
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This is soooooo long
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (4): it’s just bad
 
**frogaranaman** (3): Just.. boring. Move on.

omg starting with a BOP

**twat\_brained** (0): This is very of its time… and not in a good way. There's too much going on here; Mariah's vocal layering is poorly done, the instrumental does nothing to save it and T-Pain doesn't even phone it in, he just texts "k" on his verse. For such a career revival with TEOM you'd expect Mariah to at least try to follow up with a good opener. You could say the same for Madge but at least she makes it listenable

# MIGRATING TO THE TOP OF THE CHARTS

**lilacsweetener** (11): ABSOLUTE BANGER. A national tragedy that this wasn't a single.
 
**gannade** (10): omg there needs to be more hippity hoppity mariah


**patronsaintofaspies** (9): My name. Is not. An alcohol reference. I'm not the Patron Mimi and T-Pain are talking about, okay? Anyway...this actually managed to sneak into the Billboard Hot 100 when E=MC^2 was released. It had a relatively low peak, at a mid 90, but back in 2008, a song sneaking into the charts without getting a single release was still pretty damn impressive. I was a little lost when I got introduced to this song for the first time, because the Autotune distracted me (I'd just came in from a streak of Mariah belting her heart out) but now I appreciate how atypical this sounds compared to most of what arrived before it. This is a perfect opening song to the record, because it tells us that the album's going to be pretty damn fun.
 
**skargardin** (9): She snapped!

**AnimationJava** (8.5): I really liked the hook for Migrate, it instantly made me like the song.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): A pure bop. Apparently people really hate that she used auto tune here, but it’s a clear artistic use of the tool.



# I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE

**jimmy345960** (6.5): This song's instrumental sounds so 2008, which isn't the worst thing but I won't be putting this on repeat.
 
**J\_Toe** (6): I've only started listening to Mariah in the past few months, per the advice of r/popheads. I like some of her songs, but this isn't the kind of sound I like
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): The beat is pretty nice but I get bored pretty soon after that
 
**frogaranaman** (4): This is just trying too hard.

 **Pearl Louise** (3): There’s nothing that special about this song. It’s just very weird and generic. That intro makes my ears bleed.
 
**wailordfan\_** (3): Hm. We all make choices I guess.

# A MAN WITH A YEAR END #1, WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO GET
 
**kanyewestrep** (10): MC works well with T-Pain over a DANJAHANDZ beat to deliver a banger

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This song works really well. The T-Pain feature is suprisingly super good
 

**1998tweety** (7.7): Two legends working together, of course its gonna bop.
 
**JunkyGS** (7.5): Part of me wants to say GO OFF MIMI, but the T Pain feature does no favors with this song sounding aged af.

**piccprincess** (7): sweetie….kinda boring but t-pain a good meme

**MissyBee37** (5): Wow, did T-Pain destroy my score. I was feeling it when it was just Mariah, but like... All I could think about during T-Pain's (long) verse is how much it reminded me of him parodying himself in "I'm On a Boat," and I mean that as a compliment to the joke song, not this one...

**ImADudeDuh** (3): T-Pain an icon

**CarlieScion** (2): im screaming what is this autotuned mess and WHO LET T PAIN ON THIS
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (2): I’m sorry Mariah but T-Pain must die. I can’t give this a good score with the terrible rap in there.

this was better than the last few janet songs but there is nothing ive heard from this album so far that like.... has me enjoying myself

# TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the transition from “Rock with U” to this song OH MY Gdo
 
**Pearl Louise** (9): Best song from the album. Definitely a song I could listen to again. A hot bop.
 
**1998tweety** (8.8): I love the vibe of this.
 
**JunkyGS** (8.5): This song was produced by super star production duo Stargate. It is pretty harmless and not that memorable as other songs on the album or discography in general.
 
**CarlieScion** (8): this is very smooth
 
**skargardin** (8): Sexy bop
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I couldn't find this off Youtube as easily as the rest of the songs in this rate from Janet, and when I did, I ended up looking at a music video that may or may not have been official which carried a dismal amount of views and likes. Annoyed, I finally tried to listen to it, and I decided that it wasn't all that bad. Though this is admittedly an inferior version of the electropop and dance tracks Janet and other artists are easily capable of, the song still slaps enough for me to appreciate it and forgive how cheap it sounds like, even if still sounds like a song out of a soundtrack.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.2): Not actively bad, but a little boring. The beat is fun, even if it’s a little dated. The bridge is pretty great though.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): She sounds super Michael-y in this song.
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (7): This is better than the others as it has more of a build and the second half of the song gets kind of catchy!

# I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY TOMORROW
 
**AnimationJava** (6): I liked the beat a lot, but her songs from Discipline are starting to get a bit repetitive tbh.
 
**piccprincess** (6): Bring back the bops :((
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): LCD Soundsystem is shaking
 
**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): i mean i guess this one isnt completely terrible but does every track have to use a different spelling or number where applicable or
 
**wanderingimpromptu3** (3.5): Chill, kinda boring but unobjectionable
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (3): iss really generic. like every song on the radio in 2006-2009 generic
 
**frogaranaman** (1): This triggers my fight-or-flight response.

# LOVE WILL KEEP US TOGETHER

**gannade** (10): This is actually my favorite Madonna song of all time lol. It’s really nice and relaxing.
 
**jamesfog** (10): So underrated
 
**tooshorttoofast** (10): i was kinda underwhelmed with the previous 3 songs on this album but this song is SO GOOD, instantly added to my playlist
 
**CarlieScion** (9): this production is so sleek and the song is so catchy, although it is slightly repetitive
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): Timbaland and Danja are put to better use here than on 4 Minutes, and the lyrics are great.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): timbaland's "doop-doops" really dock a point from this
 
**1998tweety** (7.5): This is nice but also felt a bit long.
 
**MissyBee37** (7): The chorus is really, really pretty. The verses feel flat in comparison, but I love the chorus.
 
**piccprincess** (7): sounds like mini chair squeaks but a bop
 
**AnimationJava** (6): Probably the catchiest of her songs so far.

# RESTRAINING ORDERS

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Madonna sounded bored from the start of this album, but at least in Candy Shop her monotone deliver made a little sense, even if it was poorly executed. Here, it...doesn't. Harkening back to the psuedo-country acoustics of Music, Miles Away is supposed to be a song dedicated to Madge's then-husband, Guy Ritchie. Given the end result, though, I'm not surprised they divorced. Is this how you make a song about your spouse? I'd sound terrible if I recorded this, but at least my wails would try to convey some degree of emotion, even if they'd also end up driving my entire neighbourhood to suicide. Here, Madonna sounds like she feels absolutely nothing at all. No insecurity. No passion. No anger. Nothing at all. You can immediately understand what this song's trying to go for once you hear it, but it gets all the more frustrating, because when you witness how it turned out, you get the sense of a stark contrast between Madonna's intensions and how she actually carries the track out. 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Vanessa Carlton is shaking
 
**Raykel** (5.5): Forgettable
 
**static\_int\_husp** (5.5): very repetitive
 
**Pearl Louise** (5): Overrated. A lot of users on this song say this is the best song from Hard Candy, but I disagree. It’s too bland and generic.
 
**wailordfan\_** (5): it's ok, the issue here is that I can't really tell what's supposed to be a ballad and what isn't on these albums.

# OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE WORLD
 
**ImADudeDuh** (4): Madonna sounds like she's singing a children's song here.
 
**frogaranaman** (3): Massive downgrade in song quality.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (3): Boring
 
**PuggleMaster** (0): It got worse how????

this has never been my favorite katy song and its because of her vocals

**twat\_brained** (8): Better this in the rate than Britney's Mannequin tbh. Also I remember this being a lot rockier than I remember. My aunt got me OOTB as a Christmas gift and I'd play it a lot on my red iPod Nano. I should really dig that that up from the grave and take a USB to sync music from my iTunes onto it.

# DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE A PLASTIC MAN

**JunkyGS** (10): YES KATY! DRAG THESE MEN WITH LOW EQS!!!!
 
**MissyBee37** (10): I love this song concept - how do you break through someone's wall to get to know them? The agony of how hard she's trying to love him & help him open up yet how much he resists --  it's all so palpable throughout the lyrics, music and her vocal. I love her wordplay with man/mannequin so much.
 
**original\_doll** (10): one of Katy's best deep cuts tbh!!
 
**PuggleMaster** (10): this is basically a female john mayer bop and this deserves all the 10s in the world
 
**skargardin** (10): Pop-rock greatness
 
**1998tweety** (9): When Katy calls this guy a mannequin I think shes saying that hes fake and doesn't show his emotions. He doesn't react to things and ignores her. She could also be saying that he cares too much about making himself look flawless, like the smooth skin of a mannequin, something we'll see more of on the next song...
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (9): why not WOmannequin i thought katy was a feminist
 
**Pearl Louise** (8): An underrated Katy gem.
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): A BOP! She actually uses pretty decent metaphors here, and rocker Katy is the best Katy.
 
**tooshorttoofast** (8): i wish the chorus went harder
 
**wailordfan\_** (8): I love Katy's rock sound, the past three songs have been great, it kinda loses steam as it goes on though and just begins to sound like Paramore tbh.
 
**AnimationJava** (7.5): "But with you there is no guarantee, only expired warranty, a bunch of broken parts, and I can't seem to find your heart" One of the best lyrics off the album.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I like the play on words in this song, it’s cute.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): We narrowly avoided there being two Mannequins in this rate...life's funny sometimes, eh? For what it's worth, I think Katy's version is superior to Britney's. As you hear Katy continuously accuse 'you're not a man', you can't help but feel that this is a song you've heard a lot before, but despite it not being anything special there are still some things to enjoy here. Katy's flawed voice is in reality an asset here, since it makes the song sound much more genuine, and the chorus and title are actually quite clever. Not the best, but a solid album cut.

# MGTOW
 
**jamesfog** (7): Cheesy lyrics, Self Inflicted deserved.
 
**piccprincess** (7): manny the mannequin
 
**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): the sound is kinda messy, idk
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Another album cut I’m really not that into, sorry Katy fans
 
**CarlieScion** (5): this feels very average
 
**TragicKingdom1** (5): painfully strenuous
 
**gannade** (2): This is really bad and the “you’re not a man you’re just a mannequin” line is … interesting.
 
**jimmy345960** (1.5): I HATE the "man up" phrase. Please retire it. It's such a flimsy and vague insult but its really detrimental to people who aren't properly masculine (me).
 
**frogaranaman** (1): I have no reason to hate this, but I just.. Kinda do.

# Then why isn't it in the rate?

# COMME UNE COUPURE ELECTRIQUE

**hikkaru** (10): I LOVE the dark production on this whew. Danja and Britney making magic even outside of Blackout
 
**lilacsweetener** (10): Charming and vibrant but somehow like a more hollow Gimme More remake.
 
**original\_doll** (10): underrated tbh, Danja's work is pretty hit and miss for me but most of his songs with Brit are fucking bangers
 
**Pearl Louise** (10): Our bitch snapped! This song is so underrated and needs a lot more praise. A bop.
 
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9.8): invented blackouts!
 
**JunkyGS** (9.5): A continuation of Blackout Era Brit and I live for this song.
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (9): this era was just filled with great sings
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I feel that I would like this song more if I was a little drunk. It’s fun, catchy and a bit mysterious, but it has a cluttered kind of sound to it which makes it a touch less enjoyable to listen to. I still like it a lot though!
 
**1998tweety** (8.3): I like this song except for the way she says “kill the lights”.
 
**AnimationJava** (8): I was trying to figure out the meaning behind this song but it's a bop regardless.
 
**MissyBee37** (8): Another pre-chorus that just shines far & above the rest of the song! Otherwise, this song is a 7. That pre-chorus is a 10.
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.5): DANJA IS BACK! I missed him so much, honestly. The production is just Blackout enough for me to love it, but it’s candy covered enough for it to sort of fit in with the rest of the album (sort of). It’s not as good as any Danja Blackout tracks, though. The lyrics are pretty bad (although I love the line where Britney says “you better get me from my good side” and everyone else screams back “PICK ONE!”). The post chorus with the “I KILL the lights LIGHTS the lights CAMERA the lights ACTION” is everything, though.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Lights! Camera! Action! Everything this song has going for it is supreme cheese, which starts gushing in from the memetic opening that acknowledges Britney's legendary status, and continues as Britney readapts her Blackout persona to make a second version of Piece of Me. The actual quality of Kill the Lights, however, is a bit lacking compare to Blackout's iconic dance floor anthems. Britney's lack of emotion doesn't go as well as it did a year previously, owing to Circus having a very different atmosphere and sense of ambition compared to Blackout. The track is just as playful as songs like Womanizer, but it simply isn't an outstanding example of what Britney can achieve through well-written pop music.

# I NEED TO SEE WHERE I'M GOING
 
**CarlieScion** (6): oh my that "i kiiiiill" killed this song for me
 
**gannade** (6): Is this really the sequel to Break the Ice? How disappointing.
 
**imasalesman** (6): keel
 
**static\_int\_husp** (6): There's a lot of ... interesting ... choices they made with this song
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): What did the lights do to deserve this
 
**frogaranaman** (5): Okay.
 
**piccprincess** (5): more like HIT THE LIGHTS by Selegend Godmez

# Good idea, can we get Trisha Paytas to cover this?

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): This doesn't even have the same album art as the other songs from Sasha Fierce. I don't know what's wrong with it, but I'm not very surprised, because this sounds like a demo plastered in to an international deluxe album edition. To be fair, this at least seems like it was supposed to be exciting, but what drives its potential into a standstill is how unfinished it sounds. Beyonce's vocals seemed forced on top the production rather than seamed into it, and despite having everything else going for it, the song doesn't manage to form a whole.
 
**animefangrant62** (5): [If it weren’t for the lo-fi synths in the production this song would be okay.]
 
**frogaranaman** (4): Kind of a wasted instrumental. Also, I really don’t like how.. errm, controlling and manipulative she sounds in her lyrics. And it’s kind of a constant theme in her discog. :l

**kanyewestrep** (10): Mariah Carey and Jeezy work well together to make an emotional banger
 
**lilacsweetener** (10): Probably the only Mariah song that means a lot to me. It's more relevant to the bullying I experienced rather than an abusive relationship but the general theme is one I strongly relate to.
 
**tooshorttoofast** (10): wow this is really sad :(
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): In lieu of us rating Butterfly, can I just admit that I'm really glad people are finally realizing the marital hell Mariah had to go through and how much that had an effect on her psyche? The backstory behind Side Effects is a huge part of why I like it so much, because, admittedly, I find Jeezy's voice to be a little too...distracting for me to rate it so high, otherwise. She might have disguised its subject matter in a bop like this one, but it still feels like a more upbeat precursor to the moody RnB we know today, and, boy, is she serious about what she's alluding to. Poor, poor Mimi. Tommy can go fuck himself.



**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda an unexpected bop? i know touch my body and did not like it but this kinda shook me a lil bit
 
**itsnotrelevantt** (8): Ignoring the rap
 

 
**JunkyGS** (8): Yes Queen. Shade insecure men! Again these features aren't doing the songs any favors....
 
**tapdancingpig** (8): I think Mariah out-Taylors Taylor in this rate. She wrote a *scathing* breakup song about a mysterious guy that we can all identify. Also, it has a KILLER bridge.
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I wish I could give it a higher score but the feature is awful
 
**AnimationJava** (7.5): I actually found this to be a really sad and intense song lyrically, but I love the emotion and rawness in the lyrics.

# Seriously, why haven't we modded them yet?
 
**1998tweety** (8.3): The Chainsmokers are mildly shook cause this is a big bop but at the same time they're not that shook since their version bops harder.

 **jamesfog** (8): The Chainsmokers sweeties

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Chainsmokers did it better and that’s my tea for today

**napsandnetflix** (6): chaingods remain unbothered

**piccprincess** (6): /u/the_chainsmokers outsold

**hikkaru** (5.5): the chainsmokers outbopped lol
 
**poppinmmolly** (5): The Chainsmokers and Emily Warren outpeaked!!

# PUSHED TO THE SIDE

**frogaranaman** (7): [...]
 

**CarlieScion** (6): this song is waaaaaaay too long
 

 
**Pearl Louise** (6): I have no idea who Jeezy is, but it isn’t nice that Mariah is helping him pay for dinner. Kinda generic. Not a song I would listen to again and again, but it could be a lot more worse.
 
**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Never really liked Jeezy and this isn’t any exception although the beat is nice
 
**TheKneesOfOurBees** (5): it really is that middle of the road filler
 
**wailordfan\_** (5): The rap features here are really bad, but partially because I **REALLY** dislike most late 2000s rap features.
 
**MissyBee37** (3): This sounds like the lyrics are probably a good message but I'm just bored at best, annoyed at worst, with the song.
 
**Raykel** (3): She sounds so monotone

MrSwearword: Day 1 is complete and Discipline's best, Hard Candy's worst, whatever can be assessed from Mariah, 1 good Katy song [Hot N Cold], 3 good Britney singles with the good cut Lace and Leather along with Unusual You for some reason, 3 good Beyonce singles and If I Were a Boy for some reason, and amazingly all of Taylor and surprisingly all of P!nk remain

shipsinker44: pink surviving all of day 1 was the biggest surprise to me, but it makes sense when none of her six songs are bad at all

twat_brained: If you did the rate you could've dragged Pink and,Taylor

MrSwearword: I wouldn't drag P!nk that hard teebs and I like Love Story and You Belong With Me enough to spare Taylor from a full fledged flogging. Still, no full album/full flogging/full stanning chance, no dice

natsby: I love how 1989 and reputation were ripped apart by this sub in their rates but everyone seems to still love Fearless. My kind of swifties, honestly.

Here to pay respects for Side Effects though! Still my favourite Mariah song.
