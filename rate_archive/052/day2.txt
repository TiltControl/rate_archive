hm okay. this is where mariah lost me. her vocals arent pleasant sounding to me, i know this is usually a plus for her music but i dont like her voice in it

**twat\_brained** (8.4): it starts and I think Janet then Mariah starts singing and at one point I think Kylie Minogue but what I do know is that this deserved to smash

---
**patronsaintofaspies** (10): She really is. There are some artist you just can't sample in a new song without making sure you actually know what the hell you're doing. Micheal Jackson is one of those artists. It's a little more bearable for you to sample him if you're going for a vocal sample. If it's bad, people will groan, get a little offended, and move on. But here Mariah is, sampling the hook of Off the Wall. And...she pulls it off. She actually pulls it off. It's admittedly a little too close to the original to be revolutionary, but Mimi pays respect to the original's catchy composition while still managing to make I'm That Chick a song that shows how awesome she can be. For that alone, it gets my kudos. Who wouldn't want to walk down the runaway to this?

**JunkyGS** (9.5): One of the standout highlights of the album for me. This song has such a catchy groove, Mimi sounds great on it and who doesn't love a fun "feel ya self" bop?

**jimmy345960** (9.1): This was surprisingly good. I usually dislike songs that boast about being "special" and that's it. This one is still stuck in my head.

**original\_doll** (9): it was cute on the first listen but this song is growing on me a lot, it's so fun

**tapdancingpig** (9): I need more disco hip hop soul in my life. I looked up the producers, and Mariah and StarGate should have done 1,000 more collabs.

**wailordfan\_** (9): Ok yeah, she didn't lie on this track.


**1998tweety** (8): Groovy

**ImADudeDuh** (8): again a bop? really? hm

**itsnotrelevantt** (8): cute!!!

**J\_Toe** (8): "You got flavour like ice-cream" lol

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I'm that chick you like

**CarlieScion** (7): a VibeTM

**Pearl Louise** (7): Kinda shocking coming from Mariah, but it’s not THAT bad. It’s definitely a song to play at a party, and even though I wasn’t a huge fan at first, it grew on me after a few listens.

**piccprincess** (7): Im That Chicken Light kinda bops!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This beat really funky

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (6): iss cute

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.5): what the fuck is an ooie

**AnimationJava** (5): I found this song to be a bit boring but still pretty empowering.

**gannade** (5): forgettable

twat_brained: # #31: Bad Influence - P!nk

**Lowest Scores:** (2 x2) lilacsweetener, welcometoNY (3 x1) PuggleMaster 

---
**twat\_brained** (5.7): Day drinking is one thing, but is she insinuating pedophilia in the second verse? I like the beat and Pink is playing to her strengths here but honey… you just lost 2.5 points from me on that.

oh my god pink im so sorry for expecting to fall asleep lisetning to ur music but this song absolutely BANGS
---
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I'm not listening to the full album just yet, but from what I'm hearing now, I'm getting the impression that Funhouse is delivering a lot of bops with badass beats. Bad Influence has an instantly recognizable rumble of a melody that you could hear on a pirate ship, and it swashbuckles into your brain because of how delightfully edgy Pink sounds throughout the entire track. Honestly, a mom pop artist shouldn't succeed this much at a song that's so fit for hormonal teenagers, but Pink pulls being a rebel without a cause off yet again. My only complaint about the song is that sometimes it's just a little too loud, no thanks to the mixing.

**1998tweety** (8.4): This sounds like carnival music, which I guess is fitting considering the album name and cover.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Okay this song is pretty fun and I like how it keeps to the ‘Funhouse’ circus theme.

**MissyBee37** (8): I've never been a party girl, but P!nk makes it sounds like so much fun. It's hard to deny how catchy this song is, and how strong a vibe it captures. The interlude about the doctor is a fun bit!

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): i love morgan mcmarkers

**frogaranaman** (7): Seems more like a live song than a studio song.

**JunkyGS** (7): very lily allen-esque, but its all very over the place. Definitely sounds very circusy / funhouse tho

**Pearl Louise** (7): A nice choice for the album. Not a standout, but definitely a song I don’t mind listening to again.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): me_irl

**AnimationJava** (6.5): First time hearing the song, but it only grew on me with each listen.

**tapdancingpig** (6): ...That was a thing. This song feels really, really weird to me. Maybe I’ll like it more with relistens, but at least was able to bop to it.


**jimmy345960** (4.5): Kinda tacky and was not expecting such a low quality song right after those BOPS.

**original\_doll** (4): it's kinda weird to me that P!nk has (or attempts to have) this edgy image when her primary audience these days is soccer moms...

**PuggleMaster** (3): this is really bad, who picked this oml

twat_brained: # #30: Unusual You - Britney Spears

lmao this is the worst song on the album can we not

**twat\_brained** (7.6): reminds me of Shattered Glass in many ways; and frankly I prefer that to this. Both cute but I suppose the odd mishmash at SG's end is a tad overbearing to some. The bass is really good here, though. A very underrated Knee cut
---
**animefangrant62** (10): [I'd never heard this before this rate and omg it's incredible. Instant fave from the legendary Ms. Britney Spears.]

**gannade** (10): Why is this filler so good wtf

**jimmy345960** (10): Slow but great

**lilacsweetener** (10): Should've been a single...sigh...

**tooshorttoofast** (10): wow i really love this, the background instrumentals and vocals are beautiful <3

**1998tweety** (8.8): This is a chill sexy song. Britney is at her best making songs whisper ballads or electronic bops.

**JunkyGS** (8.7): Cute!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Unusual E


**PuggleMaster** (7): it was pretty but it overstayed it's welcome

**Raykel** (7): I went from what the fuck is this to trying to sing in that autotuned voice

**rotating3Dtext** (7): “Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart? I expect you do, so why haven't you?” oh

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): I probably have more mixed feelings about this song than most other Britney fans. The lyrics are great, but the melody doesn’t do much for me, and the production seems like it was dated even for 2008 (a rare miss for Bloodshy & Avant). Oh well. It’s a pleasant listen if nothing else.

**CarlieScion** (6): this really doesnt sound like britney at all

**Pearl Louise** (6): It’s not that memorable, but it is a song worth considering.

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (6): how did this get into the rate, it is straight up filler

**AnimationJava** (5): Wow yet another song about infatuation!! Who could've expected that??

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Britney ballads are a mixed bag for me. There are ones I obviously enjoy or even love, like Everytime and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know; those are classics, and usually off her earliest albums. But Unusual You features a post-breakdown Brit trying to copy the success of my previous examples, and for this reason it feels like more of a letdown than a forgotten masterpiece. The production here is pretty monotone, and this is one of the rare tracks where a mediocre vocal performance from Britney actually gets on my nerves. Though the lyrics may be tender and intimate it's hard to feel strongly enough about Unusual You when everything else is so forgettable and disappointing.

**frogaranaman** (3): No.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is like PC Music aka, not good

this song is too long but its REALLY cute

**twat\_brained** (7.3): "laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool" laughing at the fact that Taylor will become that which she's talking about a whole decade from now. [Also, speaking of Taylor at 15…](http://katelinbrooke.tumblr.com/post/21634556444/this-is-a-picture-of-my-friend-becky-she-used-to)

---

**followingfreeways** (11): yeah ok ok this gets my 11 because it's just. so important? and so poignant??? I just think it's so beautiful and even tho I am not 15 anymore and have not been for a while it still comforts me as much as it did when I was 15. thank u tay love u

**napsandnetflix** (10): this song was a single when i was 15 and honestly it was perfect and when i hear it i think of that summer between grade 9 and 10 where you're just booling everyday and i just got my first job and was working and had money to hangout with friends and we'd go get food and then have a bonfire and ugh fifteen lit

**piccprincess** (10): Cuz when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you, you're gonna believe them until they ghost you for a week and they start dating another person immediately anyways thats how you scar a teen and make them not date for 4 years only to end up in an abusive relationship!

**jimmy345960** (9.5): I saw this live and its golden. Kinda like waking up in Vegas, it has a great story in such a short amount of time.

**MissyBee37** (9): Taylor the storyteller... I love how she captures such universal feelings with just the right details. The chorus is crushing, juxtaposing the hope & the magnitude of feelings with the naivete of that age. Lovely guitar, too.

**tooshorttoofast** (9): rip abigail

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): She kind of perfectly summed up what falling in love that young feels like.

**1998tweety** (8.3): I like the lyrics and theme of this song, but Taylor's vocals don't sound great on this.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): My former fifteen year old ass cannot relate because I was boring af at fifteen and had no boys interested in me and wasn’t that interested in dating so this song doesn’t connect much (although it is nice song).

**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda tea

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I don't know why I'm giving this a pretty good rating, considering how much it's eclipsed by a lot of other songs Taylor's written since. It might even be a little bit problematic, depending on whether you think 'Abigail gave everything she had' is actually talking about a teenage girl giving up her virginity (and, for the record, I suspect it isn't, because I'm the same age as Taylor when she wrote this and I don't think I'd describe how my friend got nutted for the first time to the general public if I was as famous as she was). But there's something to be admired in this second song, because, despite the occasionally oversimplified inference, Taylor still displays an above average level of understanding for her age as she somehow manages to perfectly summarize an period of school life that was only a couple of years behind her at the time she wrote this. And, hey, despite this song having some potentially troubling lyrics here and there, can't we all agree that 'don't date a senior in freshman year holy fuck' is actually sage advice? Listen to Taylor, kids!

**rickikardashian** (8): maybe Im rating this song too kindly, because the lyrics can be a bit… clumsy, but I just love the realness of it, how well it does describe being young, and liking someone, and wanting to be liked, and all that. She is able to actually describe how it feels to be fifteen and crushing hard on someone while also being very shy.

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): we love her proclivity for writing songs that are long af


**CarlieScion** (7): this has lost some of its charm after i turned 20 lmao

**J\_Toe** (7): While I don't like the song, I can appreciate that it has a good hook

**selegend** (7): Abigail is iconic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://media.giphy.com/media/WdqlVs14FqkKc/giphy.gif

**AnimationJava** (6): Kinda catchy but also a bit boring tbh.

**original\_doll** (6): I thought this song was really deep when I was 11 and first heard it but tbh now that I graduated high school I think the lyrics are kinda cliche

**Pearl Louise** (4): A bit cliche, Taylor. When I was fifteen, I was eating Goldfish in my room alone. I wasn’t obsessing over boys.

**TragicKingdom1** (4): this is the song that made me a taylor skeptic back in like the 5th grade lol

**frogaranaman** (1): My gay ass cannot relate to being on dates at 15.

**gannade** (0): If I wanted to listen to basic lyrics about high school life, I would play Miley Cyrus’ Breakout album (a major bop) and not this mess

this songs put me in a gay trance

**twat\_brained** (10): You know those posts about freshmen hanging out with seniors? That's what Lace and Leather does with Gasoline, Up 'n Down and Change Your Mind. And Circus is stronger (than yesterday) because of it.

---

**MissyBee37** (10): I am honestly just so thrilled this song made the rate because it's been one of my top-tier Brit faves since this album was released. It may not be a single but this song is a deep-cut GEM. I absolutely love it. Sexy af! It brings out my (deeply hidden) inner stripper, ha!

**Pearl Louise** (10): A sexy bop, not to mention the backup vocals from my girl, Kesha!

**tapdancingpig** (10): “French fingertips, red lips, bitch is dangerous.” I’m not into girls, and I still think this line is hot as FUCK! The entire song is so catchy, and so good and that bass line. This was going to be my 11, and then Love Story turned 10 and I realized that I loved that song just as much and it doesn’t have a certain Dr. Lukasz Gottwald attached to it.


**hikkaru** (9): The bass line SLAPS, I'm always such a slut for them in pop songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): wow this is another surprising bop

**JunkyGS** (8.5): Great production!!

**1998tweety** (8.4): I love the weird electronic guitar bridge. The rest of the song bops too.

**lilacsweetener** (8): Prince would be proud

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): My prime candidate for the best deep cut from Circus is, without a doubt, Lace and Leather. It's a bit baffling this wasn't released as a single, because it completely fulfills Britney's promise to entertain her fans, featuring a hot hook that appears tailor-made for pop radio and the sexiness and intrigue that songs like Kill the Lights seemed to lack to a certain degree. I'm even pretty sure this managed to make it on the Bubbling Under, although maybe that was a different song on Circus. It's not her best release this era, but it's still so catchy and fun to the point where I feel like it was robbed. At the very least, it's definitely a solid song to complete this rate with.

**gannade** (7.5): Loving the electro-guitar hybrid sound or whatever that is

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): funky

**amacaroon** (7): It’s not a bad song… but Britney should not do funk. Or at least not with that delivery.

**CarlieScion** (7): boppy

**kanyewestrep** (7): very visual song, i like it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): My two favorite things

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (7): i thought i hated this but apparently not. also the worst runway of S7

**rickikardashian** (6.9): haha nice

**original\_doll** (6.5): sadly this is one of the least memorable songs on the album for me

**letsallpoo** (6): why did you dumbasses vote this in

**piccprincess** (6): s s s and m m m s s s and m m m

**frogaranaman** (5): I assume this is the song they use in gay bondage porn.

**AnimationJava** (4): Is... is this song about her BDSM kink?

this was alright, but nothing special really.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Groovyriah came to show us why she remains a skinny queen and I feel skinnier as a result

**kanyewestrep** (11): an incredible song, wonderful soulful beat provided by DJ Toomp, and a clean verse from T.I.

**CarlieScion** (10): :kimbryell:

**letsallpoo** (10): there are SEVERAL points kanyewestrep has made

**PuggleMaster** (10): I haven't heard this bop in years.


**JunkyGS** (9): This song has aged really well and is super fun.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): True story: I didn't actually know this was a fan favourite until I did this rate. I figured For The Record would get in over it. So, when I reached this song on our playlist, I paid close attention to find out just what made so many people like it over some of the other songs on the album, especially since it was a track I wasn't very familiar with. All I knew was that it had a catchy chorus. Well, here's what I discovered: I still don't think this is one of Mariah's bonafide classic album cuts, but I now know that the chorus isn't the only part here that shines. Right from the get go, Mariah makes versatile use of her voice to create an engaging RnB track. It's true that T.I barely has a presence here, but there's no denying that a song like this could be repeated incessantly without the risk of losing your enjoyment.

**1998tweety** (8.2): I kind of forgot this was playing while listening to it, but it did bop a bit. A forgettable bop but still a bop.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): omg mariah stop making some bops

**jamesfog** (8): This song is better than it's title would make you think.

**piccprincess** (8): Okay major bop alert

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Nice beat, and she sounds great (duh), but this feels less substantial than the other tracks somehow.

**AnimationJava** (7): It's meant to be a party record, according to Mariah. I think it accomplishes that feeling pretty well.

**gannade** (7): Overproduced and a little oversung

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.5): fergie did this better

**Pearl Louise** (6): Cute, but not memorable. It’s forgettable after even a few listens.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): No U

**frogaranaman** (3): This is just boring.

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (3): the instrumentation is great but then there's that issue of that it completely drowns out mariah. ^^^^maybe ^^^^its ^^^^for ^^^^the ^^^^best

**wailordfan\_** (3): ok.

this was real cute!

**twat\_brained** (7.6): @ people who went to see Mimi's residency: Bye, 

@ Alfred Carey: Bye Bye, 

@ Tommy Mattola: Bye Bye Bye. 

The "hey" noises take me out of the song and unfortunately give me a sense of ingenuity in Mariah's message here

---

**black\_velvet\_** (11): No other song in this rate can get me this emotional.

**kanyewestrep** (10): beautiful song

**Pearl Louise** (10): WHY DOES THIS SONG NOT GET TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH? Amazing vocals, amazing lyrics, amazing delivery. It pisses me off how underrated this song is. As soon as I first heard it, I fell in love. I love it so much.

**PuggleMaster** (10): I wasn't ready for Mariah to snatch me with this album holy shit

**tapdancingpig** (10): Another StarGate collab, and it’s somehow better than the last. It feels like more classic Mariah than the other tracks (I think it’s the piano and the whistle note), but it’s still got the 808s, which help make the song sound even more melancholy somehow.

**JunkyGS** (9.7): Wooooooo I forgot about this gem. What a pleasant surprise to rediscover this song.

**AnimationJava** (9): Mariah shows the most raw emotion in this track, the production and lyrics are really intense and sad-- the song kinda reminds me of One Sweet Day by her and Boyz II Men.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Is this about the troops?

**jimmy345960** (8.4): This song was a nice song about loss. It makes it feel like the loss that people are going through won't be forever and I think that that is a good message to promote. A skinny legend (I've always wanted to say that)

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): You know, as full of absolute bangers this Mimi release tends to be, I actually think that it gets pretty depressing sometimes. Side Effects morbidly fit that claim, but Bye Bye does, too. Mariah lost her father not long before she wrote this song, actually. She even wrote a song about it on Charmbracelet, which was...not the best the Songbird's had to offer, putting it lightly. This feels like a more generalized and palatable tribute to Mariah's lost loved ones, taking the form of a softly sung RnB track, and from one of the fiercest divas at all, it actually tugs my heart out. Unlike One Sweet Day, which was a well-meaning, if overwrought monster of a hit about AIDS victims, this single, despite merely performing decently on the charts, addresses death tactfully and simply. The end result is thoughtful, touching, and genuinely worthy of praise. I recommend watching its video, simply because Mariah honours her loved ones and collaborators (with special mention to Ol' Dirty Bastard) in it.

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): i love friends forever by vitamin C

**TragicKingdom1** (8): underrated, a mild ballop and a good single choice


**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): I guess is kinda sad, but also sounds sooo 2008 that I can't help being amused

**itsnotrelevantt** (7): This is sweet but it’s real cheesy

**piccprincess** (7): NSYNC is shaking

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): disney junior shows @ me when the half hour was up

**CarlieScion** (5): the opening lyrics made me worried that this might be a zero (bc i personally think its very Yikes to sing "Put your hand way up high, you will never say bye" to somebody who just lost a baby), but she slightly redeemed it with the verses

**MissyBee37** (5): I feel bad giving this song a low score because its intent is very sweet but I just don't feel the song itself.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Bye Mariah

**Raykel** (3): I'm really not a fan of ballads with trap beats, especially with a song about losing loved ones lmao it's just so off

**frogaranaman** (1): I’m just happy you’re leaving after these shitty songs.

tbh i didnt know... what score to give this?? its really good but idk if it deserves a 9 but it doesnt feel right putting it any lower so i guess ill just be unsure forever

**twat\_brained** (3.7): …if you were a boy, you'd turn into the triflin' good-for-nothing type of brother bug a boo who wouldn't say your name that you and Kelly used to lambast when you were teens. And Letoya and LaTavia too, I guess. Listen to your own advice, girl! At least your vocals remain on point, though.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Beyoncé kills it vocally here! Probably her best song from this era, and this still holds up really well in my opinion.

**followingfreeways** (10): such a close contender for my 11. I love everything about this song, I love everything about this music video. my only issue is that it's impossible to sing! thanks Beyonce

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FEMINIST ANTHEM

**MissyBee37** (10): This song is genuinely iconic and influential. We use those words a lot, but how many other pop songs tackle sexism and double standards so perfectly? Not to mention the way she explores just the difference in perspectives. It's also just a beautiful song; I love how she controls her voice from the calmer tone of the verses to the release of power in the chorus.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (9.5): A little pointless to sing along if you're already a guy, but that's never going to stop me if this comes on

**AnimationJava** (9): This was my first time hearing this song but I really liked it, the lyrics and vocal range just wow!

**CarlieScion** (9): her vocals in this oml

**JunkyGS** (9): Queen of calling out double standards

**1998tweety** (8.8): Trans icon

**frogaranaman** (8): I hate men.

**Pearl Louise** (8): Beautiful lyrics that tell the narrative of how guys have it easier than girls do. Beyonce perfectly captures the storytelling of the song, and how girls like her have fought their way to get the same privileges men have.

**Raykel** (8): This actually started the men are trash movement. Middle school girls fighting with their bfs after they heard this song omg that was a TIME. I'm sure some of them are going into congress soon.

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): ugh same

**original\_doll** (7.5): I wish this song had a big key change moment or something, because it's pretty good but it's weirdly anti-climactic to me

**jimmy345960** (7): I would give this a 5 because it bores me to tears but its message gives it an increase

**piccprincess** (7): An alright bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I am a boy and I hate it

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): The most interesting thing about If I Were a Boy is that it's actually a cover. I know. I've looked up the first version, and the vocals are a bit too shrill for my tastes, which may explain why Beyonce's singing isn't really god-tier yet on this single. Interestingly, there was apparently controversy about this song being adapted for Sasha Fierce, and during that particular skirmish, its original writer mentioned it being a very personal and painful composition. I think that her words are worth bringing to light, because, even if Beyonce doesn't really stray that far from the song's origins, her cover still doesn't make much sense unless you focus on its emotional implications over its political ones. In the grand scheme of things, If I Were a Boy has some of the least interesting observations about sexism Beyonce has to offer in her discography, because whenever one tries to read its lyrics as an attack on men, the entire thing ends up becoming vapid and overblown. Though this may be one of Bey's initial attempts to recapture the feminism of her Destiny Child days in her solo career, it's certainly not an effort that I can bring myself to commend or even appreciate. Everything here's been said before, and everything here's been brought up in much more captivating ways. Meet me in two eras, Beyonce.


**itsnotrelevantt** (3): God I hate this song

**tapdancingpig** (3): I’ve never liked this track. It kind of bores me, and the lyrics strike me as trans and gay ignorant, not to mention sexist. The one thing that keeps me from rating this track any lower than I have it right now is Beyoncé. This song is kind of a cover, if you didn’t know, and Beyoncé interprets and emotes the crap out of this song.

**amacaroon** (2): This song is a waste. Its got Bey’s vocals and an incredible title. “If I Were a Boy” is just powerful. It’s like “What is Love?” it just a powerful phrase. So much potential. And Beyonce instead uses it to make a generic song littered with vaguely sexist remarks. Does Beyonce think women are incapable of wearing what they like? Are women incapable of drinking beer and chasing after girls? Do only boys have friends that stick up for their irresponsible asses? And are men not capable of emotional maturity? And half way through it stops pretending to be an empowerment ballad and just becomes petty nonsense. I feel like someone like Ariana could pull this off because no one can understand what she’s saying. But. Beyonce. Pronounces. Every. Word. Perfectly. So I can’t just ignore the lyrics. If I want to listen to Beyonce complain about her relationships, I’d listen to Lemonade.

**animefangrant62** (0): [I despise every single moment of this song. I just fucking hate it so much. It may be the number 1 song I despise.]

This was cute but i didnt like how repetitive it was

**twat\_brained** (6): Does this refer to an old recording studio where she has bad memories or something? Also "burn this fucker down"? Literally just say "sucker", it's a one letter difference and can save you so much in censorship fees. Yes, I am saying this as a Halsey stan.

---

**frogaranaman** (10): I was goddamn **SHOOK** when she yelled “Burn this fucker down!” into the mic as a young gay. Still am.

**itsnotrelevantt** (10): This would have been my 11 but Touch My Body is my song.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): “..Now it’s full of evil clowns” Pennywise is shook! Also when she says “Burn this fucker down” is actually iconic.

**1998tweety** (9): This video scared me a bit as a child. I love how different the bridge sounds from the rest of the song.

**CarlieScion** (9): aaaaaaaAAAAAA

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): An old radio station I regularly used to was actually really fond of playing this, together with Waking Up In Vegas; they definitely had taste when it came to late 00s pop rock, didn't they? I'm was never a huge Pink fan, but this is a song I loved hearing back in those days; being scared shitless of sinister clowns are something we all relate to, and Pink captures the atmosphere of a terrifying amusement park with a funky beat you wouldn't expect to hear from mainstream pop in 2008 and a melody incredibly easy to clap along to. She pulls the eerie atmosphere off so well that when you reach the bridge, her exclaiming 'burn this fucker down!' is something you actively cheer for rather than groan at.

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): a fun bop

**PuggleMaster** (8): iconic guitar

**tapdancingpig** (8): The lyrics are a little gimmicky for me, but the song bops like nobody’s business. And THAT BRIDGE SHOULDN’T BE AS CATCHY AS IT IS!

**AnimationJava** (7): I liked the kinda weird and creepy production on this track.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this album really has a lot of dope singles huh?

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (7): this needs to be a lip sync. "this used to be a funhouse/but now it's full of evil clowns"? iconic line for a lip sync. wbk

**Pearl Louise** (6): A nice creepy bop. However, I find the countdown a bit too creepy, maybe it’s just me.


**TragicKingdom1** (5): i simultaneously hate and love this song but i think more on the like song but also it's really annoying so ughh

this was fun although it feels lacking for a title track

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I think this is offensive to non-binary people, correct me if I'm wrong. +2 for the guitars though

---

**AnimationJava** (10): I always thought this song was so relatable as a gay person, even if not intentionally? I'm not a particularly feminine gay man but I always wish some of my crushes had seen me as one, because I never had the courage or heart to be proactive about relationships in real life.

**MissyBee37** (10): I love the way this song captures a feeling of adolescence. It may not fit everyone's story, but I relate because it very much fits with my narrative growing up as a girl. I like the playful feel of the guitar & music, and I love how she plays with her voice to show softer sides of it, huskier sides of it and more brash sides of it. I also love the build through the bridge to the variations in the final chorus. The doo-doo's are so cute, too!

**Pearl Louise** (10): My apologies if I seem biased if I give Katy’s songs high rates, but this song deserves way more praise than it already has. I love the punk-rock aesthetic. Like what one of my peers said, it has big dick energy.

**PuggleMaster** (10): FINALLY ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS EVER AAAAA

**JunkyGS** (9.5): Same

**original\_doll** (9.5): please return to this sound Katy!

**hikkaru** (9): A little bit problematic but SUCH A BOP

**1998tweety** (8.7): I love it when Katy is the main songwriter on her songs cause she does such a good job. This song is interesting cause Katy illustrates a battle between things that are typically masculine and feminine. First she plays and acts like the guys, but after I assume she goes through puberty she becomes a lot more feminine and her connection with this boy changes from wanting to be his friend to now wanting to be his lover. My takeaway from this song is that Katy still wants to be this guy's best friend, like how they used to be, except now she wants to be more than that. She wants to be treated better than how he treats his other guy friends. Shes not shunning masculine girls, cause deep down she still loves all the masculine things she used to. She just wants it all. Sonically this song isn't my favourite, I mean its not awful but I think Katy sounds much better on some of the other songs on this album.

**rickikardashian** (8.7): I used to watch a novel on Wattpad with the same name as this song, and it was very cheesy and dumb, but damn, if I didn't love it. I think the writer never updated it again and tbh thinking about it got me sad

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Katy really does pop-rock music well here. This is a pretty fun song.

**piccprincess** (8): Total bop

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I want one more album in this rockier style Katy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): I feel like I just transported back to the late 2000s and I’m ready to hit up a motherfucking Spencer’s Gifts

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): issa cute subversion of the "im not like other girls" trope. I do feel like it's mixed a bit weird, like katy is drowned by the guitars.


**jimmy345960** (7.3): Kacey Musgraves Good Ol' Boys Club is better sorry

**CarlieScion** (7): this sounds like something i would listen to in my pop punk-emo phase but katys vocals r so forced that this cant be more than a 7 😔

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): For a song that's chronologically the first song in Katy's discography, ignoring that one Christian record, this is...not a great introduction. I can see why this is the track the album's named after, because, like it or not, it has all the elements of Katy's earliest days in mainstream pop music. It has entertaining lyrics that might make you cringe just a little bit, it does its best trying to convey a narrative, and it has that pop rock vibe her and other artists were going for in 2008. That very vibe, though, is what makes this song sound unfinished. The mixing here is noticeably worse compared to the rest of the album, and it makes the track's background sound messy and unrealized, which makes me enjoy the song considerably less. Even outside the production, the song still has issues. Ignoring a few lines that are confusing at best ('I studied Lolita religiously'? Come on, Katy...) the transition from verse to chorus still isn't as clean as you'd expect from a pop artist of Katy's caliber. In conclusion, while this song shows promise, even if it isn't enough to make you give up on the album, it's lazy. Despite all my criticism of it, however, I find it tolerable enough for me to give it a decent score. It might be pretty flawed, but it's still Katy.

**tapdancingpig** (7): Wow, Katy lost a lot of personality when she switched to making pure pop. Like, obviously Teenage Dream has some of the best pop songs in recent memory, but there’s a lot of attitude here that doesn’t ever come back for later records. ~~If only the melody ever stuck with me.~~

**tooshorttoofast** (7): "i started studying Lolita religiously" LOL where does katy get her lyrics from gurl...

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Yeah, that Lolitia line is a little :yikes:

**frogaranaman** (6): Forgettable.

**wailordfan\_** (6): I thought this song sounded better than it actually does. I thought it was more rock sounding, but it actually just sounded kinda bad? I don't know, I generally prefer this album to the rest of her discography, but this is kinda a weak title track.

**animefangrant62** (3): [just sounds like Katy was listening to a bunch of Paramore]

okay this was a real mood killer after love story but this song is cute but it doesnt do it for me on a casual listen, but its quite good in the context of the album

**twat\_brained** (7.7): was feeling nauseous so I needed to listen to something to calm me and my stomach down so thanks Tay

---

**1998tweety** (10): This feels like a direct continuation to Love Story following the storybook theme. I slept on this song for so long and I have no idea why since its probably now my favourite songs on the album. I think the reason why I love it so much is cause it feels like a prequel to Dear John which is imo one of Taylor's best songs.

**followingfreeways** (10): FUCK this song is so sad and it's the first song I listened to and cried to after I got my heartbroken for the first time. soo beautiful and I still get sad over it

**jimmy345960** (10): I wish I could give two elevens but gotta rally behind the rate winner that soon will be Love Story. I loved this song since my mom showed me it in 2008. I completely forgot about it until my senior year of high school while combing through Taylor's discography. Thank goodness I rediscovered this amazing song.

**lilacsweetener** (10): Whew, these lyrics...masterful.

**napsandnetflix** (10): I'm assuming this will be out before love story so imma write my dissertation here and then just kinda do a [2] for love story. Taylor is at her PEAK when she uses fairytale symbolism. It's fucking lit here, and as well as love story. When she does her fairytale symbolism, she manages to bring out your inner child. Similar to reading stories as a child, I hear her songs and feel like I'm seeing the world in a new light. The possibilities are endless, and she manages to fill the songs with wonder and excitement with a dash of nostalgia that not many artists can do.

**piccprincess** (10): idk who this is about but fuck all men

**tooshorttoofast** (10): i love the dramatic intro in the MV lmao

**MissyBee37** (9.5): I looove the melody and the guitar on this one. It's just such a pretty song, and you can *feel* her pain and disappointment.

**CarlieScion** (9): character progression in song form

**tapdancingpig** (9): Sometimes I forget just how young Taylor was here. She’s still only 28, don’t get me wrong, but 20 year old Taylor getting her heart broken for the first time is jarring in comparison to stuff like Blank Space and Getaway Car where she has all the experience and control in the world. It helps that she captures it so incredibly well.

**Raykel** (8.5): Omg my 11 year old dramatic ass was going THOUGH IT while blasting this

**itsnotrelevantt** (8): A little more boring than the other classic but it’s still sweet and the music is so pretty.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Taylor subverts fairy tale-esque romantic expectations in this song for one of the first times in her career, which is...actually pretty damn early in it, so, hey, ease down, critics. This was one of my favourite Taylor songs in general when I became a fan of hers at the the ripe old age of thirteen, and even if it's kind of dropped a notch in my tanking, this is a song off Fearless I never skip. White Horse might not reach the artistic heights of ballads like Back to December or All Too Well for most of us, but it still sends a very important message, if we're being honest. Teenagers go back into toxic relationships way too often, and when this got released, the vast majority of people people who listened to Taylor Swift were teenagers. For somebody who used to put it on repeat a lot back in the day, I wish I could have listened to Taylor's advice, because, unfortunately, I got into one of those relationships myself....I'm not bitter, though. The song is still pretty good.

**Pearl Louise** (8): One of the best songs lyrically on the album. A bit of a tearjerker, but Taylor really delivered in terms of storytelling and getting her message across.

**AnimationJava** (7): Taylor's strength is her songwriting for sure!

so like this was a bop but sorry i cant really stand her voice

**twat\_brained** (10): it's like the Pussycat Dolls recorded "Get Naked" for Doll Domination. Megabop detected! I'm glad my country gave this the love it deserves with a top 3 chart position. If only y'all showed it the same love by giving it at least a top 20

---

**JunkyGS** (11): "swag is serious, something heavy like a first-day period" If these lyrics aren't worthy of an 11 I don't know what is. This song marked Janet's return to the Top 20 of the Hot 100 since her last single from 2001's ***All For You***. Real talk this song is so bizarre, infectious and has this fat electro bass I still live for until this day. One of the most distinct sounding songs in Janet's discography.

**amacaroon** (10): I have a funny feeling this has some cringey lyrics which I’m willingly not going to look up because the hooks, choreography and staging are so good I don’t want to ruin it for myself

**black\_velvet\_** (10): 12 year-old me was slut dropping to this. Good times.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented customer feedback! she did that! because of this song, customer opinion was deemed a necessity and society has further progressed forward.

**MissyBee37** (10): Wow! I've never heard this album before but I immediately love this song. This song *bangs*. That bass! I love her rhythm on the verses, and the melody of the chorus is sooo good. Hot. Love it.

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (10): it really is that bitch


**1998tweety** (9.2): This actually bops a lot and it gives me nostalgia cause I've heard it before.

**gannade** (9): asian persuasion

**hikkaru** (9): OOookay so I think I've had this song in my head since 2008 but I don't think I heard it once after that year and so I forgot completely about it but the moment I started listening to it for this rate I got thrown back in time ten years to when times were so much simpler and i was a wee lad bopping to this and like circus and stuff whew i had taste anyways this bops and i like the production

**tapdancingpig** (9): Wow. I had never heard this before, and my tiny mind was blown.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): the video is amazing

**followingfreeways** (8.5): how have I never listened to this? it's a bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Never realized I have heard this song before until today! Didn’t know Janet was making radio bops in 2008!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This was apparently a minor hit of sorts. Actually it reached #19 on the Hot 100, which is, in all fairness, impressive. I think it could be called Janet's last popular single? It fits very well into 2008, capturing the funky RnB certain songs tried to go for at the time and seaming it with the weird, robotic production seen in albums like Blackout or X. Though Feedback may fall short from reaching the zeniths of either approach, it still serves us some much needed sass from Janet and ends up coming across as a certified banger, ignoring the atrocious line involving first day periods.

**Raykel** (8.5): Letting the girlies know what 00's greatness is

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this is one of the two songs on discipline that i actually like, and the only one that was voted into this rate. i hope this can make day 3 because it is actually a bop but the rest of this album can choke

**frogaranaman** (8): I feel like I’m the captured middle man of a spy movie who is about to be interviewed by several women in sultry outfits and one man in a suit while I’m tied up in the middle of an abandoned parking garage.

**perfumevee** (8): Apparently this song was a top 5 hit in my country. I only vaguely remember it and let's just say I was definitely old enough to know all the popular songs in 2008. Definitely catchy, though.

**piccprincess** (8): This song seriously bops live, the fuck

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Kanye West is shaking

**AnimationJava** (7): This song bops! I could see myself dancing to it in a club but not a whole lot of depth.

**jamesfog** (7): Dated

**Pearl Louise** (7): A nice comeback single from Janet after that disastrous moment she had from the 2004 Super Bowl mishap. It is nice to see her move on from the situation.

**CarlieScion** (6): this song is okay but the loud ass intro made me jump

**ImADudeDuh** (6): production sounds kinda weird and i am not a fan of the editing on her voice

**itsnotrelevantt** (6): the chorus is really good but man I hate the intro and every other part

**J\_Toe** (6): Can someone please explain the context behind "asian persuasion" as a lyric here

**kanyewestrep** (6): this song is almost good

**lilacsweetener** (5): Catchy but cringey too.

**wailordfan\_** (5): I don't like that this is the beginning of the rate and it already sounds so much like it's time, it also sounds like she has a heavy lisp during the harmonies in the verses.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): is she supposed to sound super pitchy in like all of these songs or???

**wanderingimpromptu3** (4): This is pretty catchy, but if I listen too hard to the lyrics it's a little questionable... "my Asian persuasion"? "Yeah that sexy sexy sexy sexy"?

**imasalesman** (3): no offense but this is literally painful to listen to

**original\_doll** (2): these lyrics are so repetitive and cringey... "heavy like a first day period" whyyy

twat_brained: Overall album information
 
# Discipline
 
---
 
**Overall average**: 6.343
 
---
 
this album was really disappointing. i havent heard too much of janets music but i hear her revered as a legend and lets just say i hope this was her worst album because if her fans consider this good i wont trust anything they say about janet
 
---
**TragicKingdom1**: This album was incredibly disappointing. Janet has always been a forward pushing artist but that did NOT manifest here as everything has aged poorly. The futuristic aesthetic does nothing to save the production from being muddy and songwriting from being uninspired. I will never listen to this album in full again unless it somehow gets in another rate. [Grade: D+]
 
**AnimationJava**: This is the first time I've listened to (part of) a Janet Jackson album and I thought it was okay! I think in a few more listens it'll grow on me.
 
**itsnotrelevantt**: I’ve never listened to any of Janet Jackson’s music! Unfortunately I think I ended up not liking these songs as they were long and largely boring to me… It’s at a weird place between being electronic, groovy, and R&B but without any of the interesting elements of any of them.
 
**J\_Toe**: I really like Rhythm Nation and The Velvet Rope, but I'm still warming up to this album, I guess, which I'm only listening to the first time for this.
 
**tapdancingpig**: Wow. That was hot (and I’m not even into girls).
 
**letsallpoo**: leave junky alone
 
**jimmy345960**: This album did not change my opinion of Janet. While I like some of the highlights of her discography, a majority of her songs are just middle of the road for me. They are high quality and very creative but just not my type of music. I have a similar relationship with Beyoncé and Lana's music.
 
**twat\_brained**: some great R&B gems here but I won't be keen on checking out the rest of the album. "Feedback" still bangs though
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: I haven't fully listened to any Janet album past Velvet Rope. This rate perfectly demonstrated why I'm too scared to. Though there are some genuinely praiseworthy attempts at Janet emulating 00s RnB here, like Feedback, cheap production and failed experimental tweaks bring Discipline down noticeably, culminating in an album that sounds more like a pastiche of Janet than the real deal. I don't think I'm assuming wrongly that these six songs were some of the tracks in this rate that people dreaded listening the most too. Personally, I don't think what I experienced off this album was all that bad, but nearly every song here could use some serious improvement in multiple aspects of their composition. At the end of the day, the combination of detailed descriptions of sex and bad autotune act as huge obstacles preventing people from truly enjoying the record.

the ENERGY, the EMPOWERMENT, the EVERYHING, beyonce serves. idc if this was popular im not gonna be stupid and rate it low just because its a popular choice. its GOOD

**twat\_brained** (3): Overrated, overplayed and overrewarded. Good choreo, though, I suppose. Why'd this go #1 and not Sweet Dreams? Or Freedom? This irritated me in the Grammy's 

---

**AnimationJava** (10): I C O N I C. This will always be Beyoncé's signature hit imo.

**followingfreeways** (10): I am not a single lady, but I will put my hands up

**jimmy345960** (10): great song, had this on repeat in 2008

**JunkyGS** (10): I'm sorry Taylor

**MissyBee37** (10): Classic. When people ask what modern hits will stay hits and become cherished all-time hits, this song is one of them. Easily. It's a unique, clever song idea, it's so, so fun and catchy, and the spirit is electric. Some of the sounds in the beat are weird but not enough to ruin the song or detract from its 10.

**piccprincess** (10): Uh….ICONIC

**rickikardashian** (10): inb4 someone makes a Kanye in the 2009 VMA’s reference if this is out before You Belong With Me

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): One of the only times the US has more musical taste than the rest of the world was when they made this song a bigger hit than If I Were A Boy. This one is 1000 times more interesting than IIWAB, especially melodically ([see this post by u/eltrotter](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9cukk2/comment/e5dpqv5?st=JM3ZP70T&sh=3902e844)).  This is 100% Beyoncé’s signature hit (ok, there are a shitload of other contenders, but my vote still goes to this song). AND THAT VIDEO! Slavery isn’t a choice, Donald Drumpf was never going to be a good president, and crashing award shows is never justified, but I think I’m with Kanye on this one.

**1998tweety** (9.3): The definition of iconic; the song, the dance, the video. Joe Jonas really did that.

**Pearl Louise** (9): If you think this song is not iconic, you are crazy. Immediately when this song is played, it defies you from resisting the urge to twist your hand like Beyonce did in the music video. I am not gonna lie, I myself am able to dance to most of the choreography.

**original\_doll** (8.8): this song is lowkey really annoying in retrospect but it's undeniably iconic and was such a bop in '08

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I like this song and the video is iconic, but I don’t think it’s a top tier Beyoncé song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Hey, this and You Belong With Me are in a rate together! How's that for a throwback, huh? From what I can tell, most people don't like this as an actual song anymore, preferring the now-infamous video over how the track sounds. Honestly, though, I still think it bangs, almost ten years after Kanye's iconic interruption. Sure, the production may be dated, but, hey, Crazy In Love is at least just as constrained in the early 00s as this is near the decade's end. I get why people dislike how repetitive it is, however. Presumably I don't care about such an element all that much, especially considering the beat is some of the catchiest stuff that's gone straight to my ears. One thing I will criticize about this song, though, is that I still don't understand what Beyonce's trying to go for in the lyrics. To be fair, I don't think most people do, either...

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): we need a song for the single men

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): the video, the video, the video

**skargardin** (7.5): A song that’s 1000x elevated by the MV.

**frogaranaman** (7): It bops but I’ve always found it repetitively boring.

**itsnotrelevantt** (7): So so so earworm-y. Not really that great to me?

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (6): the chipettes did it better

**hikkaru** (5): I know it was huge and iconic but it's just a bit obnoxious imo

**ImADudeDuh** (5): one of the worst bey singles

**selegend** (5): Really repetitive and overrated

**amacaroon** (4): I think it was Todd in the Shadows who described this song as if Beyonce’s posse of demonic elves were circling you, clapping. It fits. Way to clattering for my taste and there isn’t really a good enough hook to grab on to to save your ears. 10/10 video and 10/10 bridge tho

**CarlieScion** (4): [this song was ruined for me because of this Norwegian Pop Culture MomentTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V71QTyNSFfg)

**gannade** (4): For the life of me I have NO idea how this became one of Beyonce’s most iconic songs. NO idea. The beat is so grating

**PuggleMaster** (4): I forgot how fucking annoying this song is



**animefangrant62** (1): [This song makes me want to commit, it’s painfully annoying now and it has been since it was all over the place, sure it’s a damn cool video but the song itself is insipid and annoying as hell.]

this song does not do it for me AT ALL! a positive about the song is that it isnt a BAD experience listening to it, but its not fun either

**twat\_brained** (4.2): Sis, you're 18 years old. You need to think about what university you're gonna apply to, and what your post-high school career will be. This album went #1 and spawned two top 5 singles, so that's rather obvious in hindsight, but you can't promise "forever and always" in your damn teens.

---
**jimmy345960** (10): She really only put the best on this album. How can someone with such mediocre music inspire some of Taylor's best songs? You guess should hear my opinion of Last Kiss. Damn this is good.

**JunkyGS** (10): bop. bop. bop. bop. bop.

**napsandnetflix** (10): if this was the piano version this would easily get my 11. This song is beautiful, moving, and powerful. This entire album just reminds me of my freshman year so much, and the nostalgia is REAL. This just reminds me of downloading these songs on limewire and pretending i didn't like taylor swift and that i was into billy talent but her songwriting talent was too strong and i eventually had to come out to my friends as a huge taylor swift fan and like it was a big moment in my life

**piccprincess** (10): joe jonas a RAT confirmed

**rickikardashian** (10): “It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone” it was originally written by William Shakespeare, but he gave it to Taylor because it was too emotional for him

**tooshorttoofast** (10): would be my 11 if it was the piano version

**CarlieScion** (9): the piano version is slightly better

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This used to make me mad. Out of all the songs on Fearless' second half, why would people pay attention to this? Why not Change? Why not The Way I Loved You? Heck, why not Breathe? Maybe we all just collectively have a subconscious hatred of Joe Jonas for dumping Taylor by phone (though, that'd be assuming their relationship wasn't arranged, in the first place...). I still don't like this as much compared to quite a few songs on Fearless, because I think the guitar is a little clumsily placed and this isn't as melodic as I hoped it would be. Still, it's another welcome track to the musical collection of Taylor absolutely trashing other people, and I'm ready to say it has a solid place in her canon.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Why was this song voted in when You're Not Sorry, The Way I Loved You, and The Best Day exist? This song is pretty decent but its not a standout among her other songs.

**AnimationJava** (8): who hurt you sis??

**tapdancingpig** (8): Her first big upbeat breakup song! This kind of feels like a baby step into her current persona. The bridge is catchy as hell, the lyrics are affecting, and I live for final chorus belting (even if it’s a little weak).

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DisgustingFalseCock-size_restricted.gif

oh ive actually heard this song before but it is very good, she sold the tone of it very well

**twat\_brained** (10): no because it'd be a bitch to clean up off the floor. Kudos for taking "vocal acrobatics" literally though

---
**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Her Grammy performance of this is one of my favourite live performances out there

**gannade** (10): Omg the grammys performance of this was so iconic and even without it this song is great. Pink is one of those vocalists whose voice has aged like fine wine

**jamesfog** (10): Stunning

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): someone fist me

**MissyBee37** (10): This might be my favorite P!nk song. The lyrics are just gorgeous; she says so much, so so much, with just the right phrases. Each verse and each line reflects something different, yet she weaves them together so beautifully in a way that doesn't feel incomprehensible. It's not a mess (which it could've been, with lesser writing), but a tapestry of life moments & feelings, with a thread for everyone. Also, her voice shines so well over just the piano. It's simple and beautiful and deep. That's the P!nk I like best.

**Pearl Louise** (10): A ballad that P!nk always does justice, hands down. Not only does P!nk love to perform this song, she performs it UPSIDE FUCKING DOWN. Her aerial performances of this song makes me love both her and this song even more. It’s  just a low down dirty shame she didn’t do the series tricks for the Beautiful Trauma tour, though.

**poppinmmolly** (10): I love this song so much

**PuggleMaster** (10): my favorite pink song the grammy performance of this is LEGENDARY


**wailordfan\_** (10): honestly I think I prefer this as a ballad over All Too Well don’t @ me

**JunkyGS** (9): legendary grammy performance

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Wow what the fuck I literally forgot how good this fucking song was

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (9): put me in the subsection that mentions her grammys performance

**1998tweety** (8.5): A cute closer.

**original\_doll** (8): huh I've definitely heard this song before but I had no idea it was a P!nk song...weird. not bad though.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): imagine your biggest complaint about a singer being that she does too much acrobatics

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): not what I expected from that title to be honest

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): The lyrics are kind of (super) clichéd, but P!nk pretty much sells it. This is easily her best vocal performance on the album (at least of these six tracks), so I don’t want to rate this any lower.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): And now, I'm reminded why grown women enjoy Pink so much; Glitter in the Air is basically the perfect kind of title you'd want to slap onto a birthday card. However, like Please Don't Believe Me, Glitter in the Air isn't as shiny as you'd hope for. The song is very soft and personal, even compared to the former, but the fact that it's only accompanied by a simple piano makes it a bit boring to listen to. The problem with it is that Pink tries to be subdued and quiet, something I'm not huge on. The lyrics have the potential to hit hard, but there's not enough variation in the song to make a difference. The song blends it together, and it ends up being rather dull.

**CarlieScion** (6): this is very anticlimatic after getting bop after bop

**ImADudeDuh** (6): ok but that grammy performance wig

**AnimationJava** (5): A slow ballad but still lyrically nice.

**frogaranaman** (5): I don’t know what this is but I assume it’s the acrobatic part of the show.

even though ive heard this song a million times and absolutely didnt need to hear it all the way again to rate it, i still did, because its just that fucking good

**twat\_brained** (8): I'm looking at the runtime; this wasn't even 3 minutes long? Definition of short and sweet right here. Halsey does have a point about this song, though.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Something tells me I'm gonna have to harshly defend this song. So first the subject matter; I know Rita Ora's Girls caused a lot of controversy on the sub and I completely get why. Personally I love the song and think its fine but I understand that some LGBT people don't like the message that being bi is just something you do for fun while drunk. On that note though, for some people it is easier to experiment when under the influence, so I don't think its fair to invalidate those people's experiences. I think an issue arises when “get drunk and makeout” songs are the only ones we have. If there were more LGBT songs then this wouldn't be an issue, Katy and Rita's songs would be in the minority so no one would really complain about then since they're not the only songs being made by LGBT artists. Now that thats over with I'll talk about Katy's song. The lyrics aren't as fancy as the previous song, but there are still some cool metaphors, cherry chapstick for example. For me the highlights of this song is the vibe and Katy's vocals. I love the production on this song, theres a stellar rock version as well. Katy's vocals work best with a rock edge imo. Her belts sound a bit better with production thats a bit rougher around the edges compared to the super polished pop she now makes. Don't get me wrong I love TD, but OOTB will always have a special place in my heart.

**CarlieScion** (10): baby StraightTM me really liked this song, little did she now she was actually gay lmao

**frogaranaman** (10): Biphobia never banged so hard.

**JunkyGS** (10): Scream at the top of your lungs car bop.

**kanyewestrep** (10): could possibly be the biggest banger of her career

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): every single rhyme in this song is iconic AF

**MissyBee37** (10): I wrote a novel for this and then decided I'm tired of defending it. This song is awesome, and I totally disagree with the criticisms leveled at it, so I'm not even dealing with them. (I'm also saving my word count for Ur So Gay.) IKAG is catchy, boundary-pushing, raw, sexy, fun and energetic. No complaints about the music or her powerful vocal whatsoever.

**Pearl Louise** (10): I-CON-IC! One of my favorite Katy Perry songs, and *the* song that made me stan her. Immediately when you think Katy, you can’t help but think of this iconic bop. Like what she said before performing this song on the Prismatic Tour, it put her on the map.

**poppinmmolly** (10): a bop

**PuggleMaster** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Honestly an iconic (even if it’s slightly problematic after some of Katy’s comments) song. That chorus is so memorable, and the attitude in the verses that she has is so fun.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): I'm not giving this a 10 because it feels inappropriate, but God if this isn't a fucking bop. This might be a bit fetishy of lesbian relationships, but I mean, there's girls that truly kiss girls one time to experiment and they enjoy it, so this is still a valid song

**AnimationJava** (9): This song will always be Katy's debut smash, an LGBT icon!

**followingfreeways** (9): problematic? yes. a bop? yes

**hikkaru** (9): A little bit problematic but SUCH A BOP

**rotating3Dtext** (9): I guess it's problematic. But also... hot? I'M SORRY

**tooshorttoofast** (9): problematic (not rly) BOP

**gannade** (8.8): I really liked the superbowl version when they made it more rock influenced but this original is pretty great

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): It it a little problematic? Sure. But it bops tho.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): bop BUT the reason why everyone would lower the score of this is the reason i dont give it a 10

**original\_doll** (8): couple points off for being gimmick-y but this song is a bop and a half tbh

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Hahahaha! It's debate time! Oh boy! My honest opinion of it is that it's more dated than offensive. There's a difference between the two. Yeah, nobody could dare to call kissing girls a thing that good girls don't do in 2018, but the hard truth is that when Katy was writing this, queer acceptance was still a bit off the mark. So, yeah, sure, it's not something that people would approve of today, but it's nowhere near offensive as some of her other songs in this rate...if you know what I mean. Ha. On its own, though, I Kissed a Girl might as well have deserved to be Katy's first hit. Aside from controversy that's a bit more troublesome in hindsight, it shows that Katy's great at delivering hooks and choruses, and it's a nice blend between the kind of music she released for this era and her later pop classics. It might bother me a little, but I can't deny enjoying this coming on on shuffle.

**piccprincess** (8): Gay anthem Gay icon A classic

**tapdancingpig** (8): These lyrics didn’t age well, but do you know what absolutely did? BENNY BLANCO’S PRODUCTION. I hate Dr. Luke, but his and Blanco’s production styles mesh perfectly here. Also, the bridge is synthy heaven.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): absolutely not me_irl


**wailordfan\_** (8): A bit problematic? Maybe. A bop? Definitely. Katy should incorporate guitars way more into her music, especially like she did in the chorus here.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (7.5): Hated this when it first came out. Only took 7 years and 2 more albums for this to actually grow on me. Good thing 'Hot N Cold' came next so I didn't completely dismiss Katy right out the gate

**itsnotrelevantt** (7): It’s a great song but the obvious problems mean it’s hard to rate it fairly. It’d be a 10 if not for how badly aged the message is.

**perfumevee** (7): That line "I hope my boyfriend don't mind it" is so cringy. That said, the song itself is undeniably catchy.

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (7): i wanna call this problematic but ur so homophobic is on this album so

**TragicKingdom1** (5): ugh i wish i liked this more bc the main guitar riff is good

**jimmy345960** (0): Salute to me, I'm your ~~American~~ bisexual queen. tldr, Fuck this song and its joking about the validty of bisexuality.So this song. It was a struggle to decide which song was getting my zero and this song won. While I think that "Ur So Gay" is more harmful to the LGBTQ community, "I Kissed a Girl" was more harmful to me. When I was younger, I had this song on repeat. I had all of Katy's singles on my Ipod Nano and this is the song I started with each time I was riding in my moms violet mini van. I had some Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Rolling Stones songs that I always skipped because they were boring. I "hated" pop music but I had all of the big pop girls songs on my Ipod because I secretly loved them. This was a point where my mom begged me to get rid of Britney Spears "Womanizer" and The PussyCat Dolls " I Hate This Part" because of "how it made me look". She came around to the idea that I was a fan of Gaga until I screamed at her on a walk to not say that I was a fan because liking Gaga was "GAY". So you have some background on how insecure I was about my Man liking Men feelings. Now for the good things. This song's beat and melody is fantastic and if this song had a different subject matter this would have been a 10 no doubt. It really forced the idea of homosexuality/bisexuality into the public's minds, or at least mine in 2008. The problem was its complete disregard of bisexuality. It instills so many negative stereotypes. Now as a 22 year old, I can differentiate where she is joking, but as a 12 year old I could not. This song implies that Katy of 2008 is making out with a girl because of how "fun" she is and implies that she is in a relationship while she is doing it. She's just making out with girls because its the fun thing to do. This song got a lot of press staying at number 1 for many weeks, so it gave a lot of people a skewed vision of bisexuality and homosexuality. When I was 17, discovering myself, I was delayed because of this song. This songs negative stereotypes of bisexuality is just for fun and hope no one finds out I made out with a girl definitely negatively affected me and if I could go back to 2008, I would tell 12 year old Jimmy to delete this song and listen to Taylor, who I didn't really discover until 2012 Waking Up In Vegas. This song has a bad message on lgBt youths and should be stopped at all costs! So it got my zero.

yall okay it literally took me years to realize what the message in the song was. for maybe like five years i thot the song was about a girl getting kidnapped and britney looking for her but no its secret message was revealed to me by my parents who called it white trash brainwashing music. this is actually probably my favorite circus song

**twat\_brained** (10): And people have the nerve to say Britney isn't clever; she finessed radio stations all across the world into playing a song with a dirty hidden meaning to it. I realized the F.U.C.K part early on but it took me until like summer 2009 to realize it was more than that. In any case I get my absolute jush to this slutbop. Bonus points for having a melody that's somewhat circus-themed, unlike much of the remainder of the album.

---

**original\_doll** (11): Britney at her best - trashy, but clever and fun. I was in 5th grade when this song came out, and people would ask each other if they understood the wordplay in the chorus as a measure of who was 'cool' or not in my class.

**frogaranaman** (10): I don’t know who Amy is, but thank you for doing whatever the fuck your dumbass did so we could get this song.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is an iconic and kind of clever song and I will not tolerate any slander for it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ugh her mind

**itsnotrelevantt** (10): This is that clever play on if/F u/U seek/CK right?

**JunkyGS** (10): One of the cleverest songs in pop music history that blew every middle schooler & high schoolers mind.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): someone fuck me

**piccprincess** (10): I wanna get if yu seek amy-ed

**rickikardashian** (10): I'm ashamed of how long it took me to understand what If You Seek Amy meant

**tapdancingpig** (10): If you had any doubt that Max Martin and Britney are the dream team, here you go. The catchy hook(s), the naughty lyrics, the perfect bridge, they all come together to form a perfect pop tune. And while she may be one of the worst singers in the industry, no one could have delivered this better than Britney.



**jimmy345960** (9.4): FUCK ME

**BearlyEvenAPun** (9): I wonder if the thought process writing this was anything more than 'lol let's put fuck in the title, but you know, all sneaky-like'

**ulikejazz** (9): Queen of hidden messages.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Queen of teaching us how to spell vulgar words.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): It may not be not as cemented in the pop classic canon as I'm a Slave 4 U or Gimmie More, but If U Seek Amy is a strong contender for the most controversial song Britney's ever released, all thanks to that gem of a title. I wonder what Britney's chuckle was like when she read the lyrics on this one for the first time (which don't really make sense when you read them on their own, to be honest) and realized the pun. Because of all the infamy surrounding If U Seek Amy, it's a little top easy to dismiss the song as an excuse to make sure Britney stayed relevant by making parents shake their fists in rage. Still, even if you've managed to forget the hilarity that ensued after If U Seek Amy was sent to radio, it's still the trashy, catchy bop that you can't help but hum along the chorus to. An excellent experiment in linguistic fuckery.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): "all the boys and all the girls are begging to if you seek amy" makes NO sense but I don't care. Bold.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): If U Seek Capitalism

**TheKneesOfOurBees** (8): controversial queen who everyone wants to fuck

**tooshorttoofast** (8): still looking for someone to if u seek amy :(

**followingfreeways** (7): im low-key upset that I didnt know this song when I was like 10 because I know for a fact I would have thought it was the coolest song ever

**MissyBee37** (7): I don't enjoy listening to this song all that much (it gets old), but I have to give mad props to the idea behind it. It's clever af.

**Pearl Louise** (7): It’s a banger, but I can’t stand

**perfumevee** (7): Pretty cheesy.

**PuggleMaster** (7): Honestly i was never able to hear the FUCK me thing until this rate. Kinda sad that the song relies on the gag though.

**AnimationJava** (5): We love a bisexual queen!

**lilacsweetener** (2): She sounds ridiculous.
