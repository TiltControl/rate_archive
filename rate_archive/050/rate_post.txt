Good evening! I'm your host, /u/blue_heart_, also known as Remy, and today I have the honor to welcome you to this rate. Thank you mods, and last but not least, thank you god. 

This rate is about 3 British ladies and the expectations they met and surpassed on their second albums. Some artists fell into the trap of the "sophomore slump", but not these. Our esteemed competitors are:

 * The impossibly popular [Adele](https://media1.tenor.com/images/8c7cb25090caad8cd5c57ca1dde6ecf3/tenor.gif?itemid=4964855)

 * The legendary [Amy Winehouse](https://twitter.com/repeattofade/status/884873253155721216?lang=en)  
 
 * The irreverent [Lily Allen](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/236918780129705985/427740165302124545/l5chXvi.png)
 
What do these people have in common, besides being female, British, musical artists, with an inclination to soul or RnB? 
Why, it's the fact that they knocked it out of the park with their second albums, of course. Adele attained huge fame with *21*, where *Rolling in the Deep* or *Someone Like You* attained huge success all over the world.
Amy Winehouse's *Back to Black*, and its lead single *Rehab* almost earned her a clean sweep of the Big Four at the Grammys. Lily Allen won awards in Britain and the US for *It's Not Me, It's You* and its first few singles, namely *The Fear* and *Not Fair*, and her hilariously upfront coverage of some issues that people rather not talk about was admired.
These are the albums we're pitting against one another, and these are the songs. I stole the descriptions from Wikipedia. Sue me.

#Albums

##Back to Black

Back to Black is the second and final studio album by English singer and songwriter Amy Winehouse, released on 27 October 2006 by Island Records. The album spawned five singles: "Rehab", "You Know I'm No Good", "Back to Black", "Tears Dry on Their Own" and "Love Is a Losing Game". Back to Black was acclaimed by music critics, who praised Winehouse’s songwriting and emotive singing style as well as Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson's production.

At the 50th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, Back to Black won Best Pop Vocal Album and was also nominated for Album of the Year. At the same ceremony, Winehouse won four additional awards meaning that she ties with five other artists as the second-most awarded female in a single ceremony. The album was also nominated at the 2007 Brit Awards for MasterCard British Album and was shortlisted for the 2007 Mercury Prize. Back to Black sold 3.58 million copies in the UK alone, becoming the UK's second best-selling album of the 21st century. By 2018, the album had sold over 20 million copies worldwide.

##21

21 is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele. It was released on 24 January 2011 in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008–09 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.

Adele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.

##It's Not Me, It's You

It's Not Me, It's You is the second studio album by English singer and songwriter Lily Allen. It was released on 4 February 2009 by Regal Recordings and Parlophone. It was produced and co-written by Greg Kurstin, with whom Allen had previously worked on her debut studio album, Alright, Still (2006). The album represents a departure from the ska and reggae influences of its predecessor, incorporating electropop with elements of jazz and country.

Upon release, It's Not Me, It's You received positive reviews from critics, praising Allen's "sharp tongue" and calling the album "wonderful". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the charts in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. It was later certified triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and has sold 1,016,169 copies in the UK alone. It was also certified four times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of over 280,000 copies in Australia. The album has sold over two million copies worldwide.

It involves a lot less work for me, which is my favourite kind of work!**

[Here](https://open.spotify.com/user/thepopheads/playlist/3atMSbFKAfs9xZf3UiM3zO?si=15oxYm9DR_iIudJcQL3gFg) is a playlist with all available songs on Spotify on it.

###And now for some rules. I copy pasted those from another rate, like everyone does. Sue me.

* Listen to each song and assign each a score **between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots. This means that giving a 7 is fine! Giving a 7.5 is fine! Giving a 7.55 is **absolutely out of the question!**

* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. By one, we mean that this is one song total, not one song per album. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results and is very annoying! **YOU CANNOT GIVE A 0 OR 11 TO A BONUS TRACK.**

* You have to listen to and rank each song! (Except the bonus tracks, but please do those anyway.)

* Your scores are not confidential! 

* If I suspect you from intentionally giving certain songs or artists low scores for the sake of sabotage, I will not hesitate to tell you to clarify or change your scores!

* Your scores can be changed at any time! Just PM the corrections to me!

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Like this:

Acceptable:

> Rehab: 0 This song already won a rate!

ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE:

> Rolling in the Deep: This song already won a rate! 0

> Rehab: 0 - This song already won a rate!

> Rolling in the Deep: 0 (This song already won a rate!)

> Rehab: This song already won a rate, so I'm giving it a 0!

* You can give a comment to an album by placing a colon after the album name and writing your comment after that, like so:

> Album: Back to Black: Talented brilliant incredible amazing showstopping spectacular never-the-same totally unique completely not ever been done before unafraid to reference or not reference put it in a blender shit on it vomit on it eat it give birth to it

**If you do not follow these simple formatting rules, I will probably still accept your scores, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you for your illiteracy.**

Thank you for reading, be fair, have fun, and thank everyone for participating!
