A fun, ska/reggae cover that I have no idea what it's even about, but popheads hates fun so I guess this is last in the bonus rate. Amy's vocals suited this style very well, though.

---
**tapdancingpig** (8): More 70‚Äôs and Caribbean influences here, and it‚Äôs a fun one. She plays with her vocals here in interesting ways.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): what the fuck [2]

**MrSwearword** (1): I am so not here for this MadTV skit of No Doubt of a song. NO.

#Most interesting comment of the rate. Give it up, guys, it's peaked.

**vayyiqra** (5): First of all, what a weird title. Did you know there was an incident of mass hysteria in India over an alleged monkey man roaming the streets of New Delhi in 2001? It was certainly bullshit, but very amusing to think about. Anyway, this song kind of sucks, sorry.

Another ska cover, this one not even really as good as Monkey Man, but man. It sounds like she's really having fun with this, which kind of lacked on the album proper (probably besides Addicted).

---
**perfumevee** (9): I'm loving all these ska covers! The style really suited her.

**tapdancingpig** (6): This one is kind of just boring. It‚Äôs not a good fit for her voice, and it‚Äôs just too repetitive.

**vayyiqra** (6): "I'm finding Amy Winehouse very monotonous after listening to all these bonus tracks, most of which haven't grabbed me. Why does she get literally half of all the tracks in the bonus rate anyway? That's not very fair.    
 **The answer is that the B-sides were originally in the actual rate but it was decided to push them out because it was too long. Amount of songs doesn't really matter, anyway, since they're not very good.**

**MrSwearword** (1): No, I'm not wondering why this was a B-side/not on the album proper. It sucks

Taking a break from reggae/ska for... this.

Oh wow.

**mudkip1** (10): uh iconic!!

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): So... that happened. I can‚Äôt tell if this is a celebration or mockery of f*g hags.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): wow Lily truly is the Queen of the gays. Carly, Gaga, Taylor etc. found dead in a ditch

**MrSwearword** (7): it's like Marina and the Diamonds as done by MadTV. Less Katy with Ur So Gay and more Simone Battle with He Likes Boys

**vayyiqra** (6): What is this? The lyrics to this jumped out a lot more than the lyrics to Kabul Shit, which I expected would be a lot edgier than it was. I think (I hope) that she's being ironic with this song, because otherwise it's very ... questionable. If you want someone to be your platonic friend, Lily, their sexual orientation is not an important qualification. Musically it's alright, but lyrically it's bizarre.

Here we go, with the worst of the worst clocking in at barely over a 7.0 average. The greatest crime of this song could really just be the fact that it's not as exciting as the others. Adele's lyricism and voice are great as always, but those alone can apparently only carry a song so far. It still says a lot that the lowest scoring is still so gently treated; it didn't get any 0s (only two songs in this rate did) and the scores could largely be described as "mediocre." For comparison, in the Pop Girl Prophecy rate this song would've placed at #26, just around So Good.

---

#Taking it all

 **akanewasright** (8): This one is really wrenching. I feel like this would hit me harder if I had been in a relationship (the teenager jumps OUT), but even still.

**vhqv1997** (8): As far as sad piano-backed ballads go, this song is pretty standard. It's still good, but clearly doesn't stand out from the rest of her discography

#Keep it

**Leixander** (7.5): i'd rather not but she still sounds pleasant

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Imagine writing this as the first song of your new album, playing it for your boyfriend of 18 months, resulting in a huge fight, the end of your 18 month relationship, creating the catalyst for the rest of the album, which becomes the best selling album of this decade, and solidifying you as one of the greatest living vocalists..... Anyway, the song's alright.

**A\_Zucchini** (7.2): Tired concept, but executed as well as Adele could. I wish that she would do that head voice that she does here more, it's very different from her normal singing voice and I feel like it could be pulled off in other songs. Couple of velvet-smooth runs that really redeem the track.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.2): Go on and go, see if I care - but don't turn around!

**MrSwearword** (7): above average but not that special

 **vayyiqra** (7): Slow piano ballads aren't my thing. I have limited patience for them, but this isn't bad.

 **patronsaintofaspies** (6): Adele strips things down even further in this song, but does it come off well? Maybe to some people, but I'm not really hear for it. I get what the track is going for, but even if I enjoy songs where Adele's vocals aren't super astronomical, a chorus like that probably doesn't really belong here.

 **qetaz** (6): It‚Äôs okay, but there‚Äôs nothing special about it for me. Maybe this is suffering from being in the second half of the track list when I‚Äôve already heard several ballads though.

 **WhatAYagTwist** (6): man this piano thing is getting old

 **twat\_brained** (5.3): Am I just unempathetic or is this really just a disinteresting song? It's not memorable, unlike much of the front half of the album.

I'm surprised this song didn't end up in dead last. I at least expected it to get slapped with a 0. It's a cute song... I guess? With other songs in this rate, learning the meaning really strengthened my love for them, but I can't really see this one as anything but boring. She doesn't really have the vocal chops that Adele can show off on a song like Take It All.

---
**akanewasright** (9): The perfect ending. The retro instrumental is everything, and the lyrics (about Lily reuniting with her distant dad) kind of hit hard.

**Leixander** (8.5): big reputation big reputation ooo you and me we got some big reputations aaahhhh

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I still cannot to this day completely tell if she's ever being sarcastic or not in this song. Still, what a bop.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): The album goes out with a bit of a whimper, but it‚Äôs a good whimper. The retro production is absolutely perfect, and the lyrics are really affecting.


**awryj** (8): cute, i love the sample used here

**vhqv1997** (8): I'm still not sure if this song is supposed to be sarcastic or earnest but speaking as someone whose relationship with his father is somewhat rough, I am glad that Lily has not many hard feelings toward her own dad and feels confident enough to write a song about it

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Kudos to Lily for transcending time with making such a lovely song using quite an old timey instrumental

**Albert\_Cole** (7.6): I don't get it lol

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I'm sure a lot of people think that this is a boring closing track, and, sure, I'm not big on the acoustic vibes, but I actually really like the story this tells. It's about Lily's father and despite how harsh the girl's sounded on the entire album, the fact that she actually reconciles and forgives him ends up being pretty adorable. I'm glad I know the story behind this, because otherwise, I'd have given it a much lower score.

#So baby pull me....

**1998tweety** (8.3): A decent closer.

**A\_Zucchini** (7.1): Good closing track, I like what they went for with the production here. I wasn't too convinced that I was taken back like what the track was trying to do but I get it lol

**MrSwearword** (7): well damn, that closer has impact but mostly a #CHOICE

**vayyiqra** (7): This isn't amazing but it's a nice little closer. I might stan Lily Allen if all her albums are this good. I don't care that she's messy, I like her songwriting and voice she is so cute.

**qetaz** (6): It‚Äôs sort of cute but also sort of underwhelming? I‚Äôm a bit disappointed that this closed the album TBH.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): this is a really out of place closer, feels completely different tonally and almost like a bonus track

**gannade** (5): an odd way to end the album... not really a fan of this

 The first song to get not just one but 2 0s, and if not for that it might've placed higher. It got rather decent scores otherwise. It's quite a mean song, but that's Lily's whole gig, plus, who can't relate to calling up some asshole you haven't spoken to in a month because he's a nice lay and you're desperate? This is why Lily is a gay icon. But, evidently, even the gays don't fuck with accordions.

---

#Accordi-oh she better do!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why am i stanning a song with an accordion

**MrSwearword** (10): there's the sardonic Lily I like. Nice circus/fairground style production to say "BYE BITCH"

**RandomHypnotica** (9): wow lily invented polka music how inspiring

**tapdancingpig** (9): This one is very Alright Still, but there‚Äôs definitely more maturity here (even if this is one of the more childish sounding songs on the record). I love the accordion on this song way more than I should, and I LOVE the melodic choice to have the chorus and verse be so different.

**1998tweety** (8.3): I like the accordion on this but I'm not a big fan of the chorus.

**akanewasright** (8): A little bit cloying, but her lyrics are on point, as is her delivery.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): this was cute, but it feels filler-ish since it doesn‚Äôt reach the highs of the other songs

**nooodisaster** (8): The little spring sound effect that happens once bumps this up to an 8.

**A\_Zucchini** (7.8): The instrumentation hoooooolllla good here, loving the Weird Al treatment of the keys here, as well as the whistle SFX.

**Leixander** (7): i love how much of a mess this is

**vayyiqra** (7): Lily Allen can make as many sassy reggae-influenced bops as she wants and I will listen to and like them all.

#Stop trying to make this song happen

**vhqv1997** (7): This song should be really good but then it is followed immediately by Fuck You and I completely forget about it

**stardustanddinos** (6.5): Started off really promising, but it gets monotonous slowly tbh.

**mudkip1** (6): the chorus is gay perfection but what the gays DON'T need is an ugly ass accordion

**qetaz** (6): I don‚Äôt find the production really interesting which is unusual for this album, and I find the lyrics really immature. Still bops though.

**Albert\_Cole** (5.5): Yep "using" is the right word

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): The album starts dipping a little into unoriginality here-I can't pick out any memorable lyrics from this song, which is a bad sign if I'm listening to Lily Allen, and the way it goes is pretty annoying. It sounds like a pastiche of Lily's style rather than an actual song from her.

**twat\_brained** (0): Accordion to me, this isn't a musical style that gels well with Lily's voice, and it shows. If she thinks she'll be able to pull off a whole era with this kind of sound, I can assure you the following: it's never gonna happen.

#I felt the need to single out this comment

In my opinion, another really underrated song (but I will be saying this for every Amy song, so take a grain of salt with my opinion). Amy's at her best when she's doing an understated song. Just Friends is about how hard it is to just be friends. And when you know a person intimately, it can be hard to keep your distance from them, especially if you still have feelings for them. This song beautifully illustrates this with its withdrawn, almost shy instrumental, as if it's afraid of affection, just like Amy shows in the lyrics.

---

#Best Friends

**mtachi** (9): One of the more understated moments on the album, but so damn brilliant.

**tapdancingpig** (9): This one is a little overlong, but it‚Äôs brilliant. The story of the song is illustrated so well, you feel like you‚Äôre in it as much as Amy.

**WhatAYagTwist** (9): the first two notes on this song are my "G note in Welcome to the Black Parade"

**twat\_brained** (8.9): Loving the funky throwback undertones here! It works excellent with Amy's voice

**akanewasright** (8.5): This one is a little long, but it‚Äôs great, and I LOVE her jazzy side coming out.

**1998tweety** (8.3): While I prefer the more upbeat energetic songs, the slow ones are still good in their own right.

**A\_Zucchini** (8.1): Mellow production overlapping some sombre lyrics, what more could you ask for from our resident Goddess? Wish it was a little longer instead of having the last 10 seconds repeated over and over, but that's just my opinion.

**awryj** (8): ahh finally vibing

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is a very subdued and quiet song, which used to be a little distracting to listen to after the first three tracks on Back to Black, but I actually like it a lot now. Despite the turmoil present in the situation described it actually sounds pretty cute, and I love Amy's vocal performance.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): is this reggae

#...Right?

**Albert\_Cole** (7.1): I like "I'll never love you like her" as a concept but otherwise this song just seems kind of confusing overall. It's just... a bit jaunty?

**Leixander** (7): my least favorite on the album but still nice

**vayyiqra** (7): I completely spaced out during this and had to relisten to it goddamn ADHD anyway this is a nice little bop.

**vhqv1997** (7): This song had killer verses but just never went anywhere

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I feel like her enunciation isn‚Äôt that great in this song and it just kind of goes nowhere.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Kinda catchy, but mostly just happens.

**MrSwearword** (6): more like just taciturn but werk

**qetaz** (6): This is kind of boring unfortunately.

**mudkip1** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZvWvfCSZ8M

 Now here's the first song where I can really say that it placed way too low. Fair, the transition between the verses and the chorus is kinda jarring, but when the chorus hits it hits *hard*. And this song is actually very relatable to me, at least, having siblings I kind of resent for being better at most things than me. It would be hard to offer an apology like this upfront to my siblings, because you admit to so much history and personal emotion. In conclusion: robbed.

---
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i wish i could write my little sister a song like this, too, lol

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): invented sibling relationships

**nooodisaster** (9): The snapage of this song!! Lily said she wrote this to have more bangers to perform live, and what a banger this is.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): a little bit repetitive but still a bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): This reminds me of a Britney Spears song.

**Leixander** (8.5): has great production and an amazing fast-sung chorus but verses misses some vocal commitment from lily

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): A pop rock song on this album was unexpected, but in hindsight it's not such a surprise. The melody goes perfectly with Lily's harsh tone and lyrics, and in an album full of pastiches this is one of the only tracks that truly and traditionally goes off.

**tapdancingpig** (8): I love the verses, and as someone who has a difficult relationship with some family members, the lyrics hit home. I don‚Äôt love the chorus, but it‚Äôs effective.

**vayyiqra** (8): That intro is fire don't @ me. This album's upbeat sound is refreshing after two albums full of downer piano ballads about drugs and lost loves. There is nothing wrong with those, but I needed a change.

**vhqv1997** (8): Just a tip: if you ever want to apologize to someone that you deeply regret mistreating, please speak more slowly so that they can actually hear your apology

**WhatAYagTwist** (8): holy shit that distortion beauty

**akanewasright** (7.5): This one is kind of messy. The lyrics are solid, but the melody (especially the chorus) is kind of all over the place.

**Albert\_Cole** (7): This just sounds robotic. The apology sounds pretty genuine, but the thumping and the synths just sounds completely at odds with what she's saying. I wasn't expecting a ballad but still

**awryj** (7): This feels almost as frantic as a My Teenage Dream Ended song... Her mind... Vocally not really there though, Farrah outsang

**MrSwearword** (7): the energy and vocal delivery is fine and all, but Lily acting like she fucked up is so not on brand.

**qetaz** (7): I really like the vulnerability she shows here, and I especially like that it‚Äôs not about a romantic situation. Reminds me (thematically) of Florence and the Machine‚Äôs song Grace.

**A\_Zucchini** (6.8): I'm ...pretty sure I like this track? Idunno this is weird

**gannade** (2): omg the chorus lily no what are you doing. i love white girl rap but this aint it!

**ImADudeDuh** (2): oh i do NOT like this intro or this chorus or this production, ok but she did snap at 3:01 so this will not be my 0 then

**twat\_brained** (2): That intro is, um‚Ä¶ a choice. I'm also rather unimpressed at how Lily feels the need to sing at a different tempo than the chorus, and quite breathily too. I wasn't thinking of giving a 0 in this rate but color me surprised.

This is admittedly one of my least favourite songs on Back to Black (I much prefer the down-tempo version), but it surprisingly has a little lyrical depth to offer, which I only found while doing this rate. I never associated the use of "blow" with cocaine, for example, and there's a few lines that are chilling given the context of her relationship, especially in the second part. Looking at Amy Winehouse in hindsight, it might've been an illustration of their doomed relationship.

---
**Leixander** (9.5): me to my future one and only one that will never come

**twat\_brained** (9): Popheads trying to stream artists who are neither hip-hop nor Ed Sheeran to get their faves up the charts

**tapdancingpig** (8): This one is probably the weakest on the album, but Amy really lets the jazz singer in her loose on this one.

**vhqv1997** (8): No get the fuck away from him Amy, he doesn't deserve you

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I enjoy this well enough, even if it doesn't quite have the impact as the rest of the record for me-it's a nice song to put in the background, and I promise that I'm not saying that in a shady way. I also really like the title.

**A\_Zucchini** (7.3): Literally feel the same way about this track as I do with Wake Up Alone. Not blown away, but some interesting stuff there.

**Albert\_Cole** (7): Unholy wars are a losing game

**MrSwearword** (7): it doesn't have a lot to offer but at least it's cohesive on the album

**qetaz** (7): It‚Äôs nice, but it feels like much less of a moment than a lot of her other songs.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): thissounds a lot like ‚ÄúYou Know I‚Äôm No Good‚Äù

This is an... interesting song. It's in this because it was a Japanese bonus track on Back to Black. The production on this is so different from the rest of the album or the bonus tracks, even, but the lyrics are pretty cool.

Still, it hardly sounds like Amy.

---
**MrSwearword** (10): Amy Winehouse sang about fucking her best friend's ex with no shame. DUH this gets full marks.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Definitely the most interesting way to say ‚Äòanalyze‚Äô that I‚Äôve heard

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This really doesn't even sound like Amy Winehouse

**vayyiqra** (7): This song got off to a very weird start. I was wondering what the fuck the infernal noise coming out of my headphones was and thinking my computer had been possessed by demons. This is a weird song, and I find it very unsettling. I like it though, except some of those background vocals are absolutely cursed which drags it down.

**tapdancingpig** (4): I don‚Äôt think this song was formally released, and that‚Äôs a good thing. The production is terrible (and seems really unfinished), and the chorus is horrible. The lyrics are decent, but they‚Äôre weak by Amy‚Äôs standards, so they don‚Äôt redeem the song of its atrocities (ok, I‚Äôm being melodramatic, but still).

I was going to make a joke about that Joan Osborn song that's basically this song with 100% fewer references to late-60s American rock bands, but a few commenters beat me to it. Either way, this is a good song. Taking the perspective of a higher being is obviously a classic device, even before One of Us, and Lily applies it... semi-gracefully, depending on how you feel about that 9/11 reference in the chorus. It's, in my opinion, one of the clearest examples of Lily's lyrical style, with her irreverence and her political themes.

---

#Goddess


**Leixander** (10): yes lily spill the tea


**nooodisaster** (10): She snapped!!! The verses are clever and kinda funny, but lead into a whammy of a chorus. "Ever since He can remember, people have died in His great name" sends chills down my entire body. Lily is an expert at critiquing society, and this is one of her best.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): As a Christian... honestly I think He'd kind of like this song

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Sorry, everybody, I'm not doing a theological breakdown of the lyrics. I actually find the verses quite funny, NGL. It's really good satire on the poorly defined theism most middle class white religious people have. The chorus, while really catchy, is a little less enjoyable, if only for the 9/11 reference-it doesn't really fit in, and it makes her point a little more obnoxious than it actually is, if I'm being honest. Other than that, I actually think this is a huge earworm, and I'm not really that offended by it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): the sheezus jumped out


**awryj** (8.8): can you imagine carly had to put up with people dying in her name since 33 ce

**1998tweety** (8.2): I feel as though context is very important to fully get this album. There are many politically charged songs on this album that I don't completely get because I'm not familiar with the time period and circumstances they were written around. The reference to 9/11 is very smooth though, I did not notice it at first.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): rhyming suicidal with Creedence Clearwater Revival is very appropriate

**static\_int\_husp** (8): The symbolism is pretty overt, but it makes for an... interesting song

**ImADudeDuh** (7): is this about trump

**qetaz** (7): Clever lens for social commentary and some very poignant lines. Some lines make me uncomfortable, probably partly because I am quite religious. But it‚Äôs classic Lily and as befits the album the production is great.

#Blasphemy

**A\_Zucchini** (6.5): Look I get the sentiment and I understand what she's going for... I just... don't think that this song is that good...?

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): I forgot about this one. I don‚Äôt know why this doesn‚Äôt click with me, but there‚Äôs something here that really puts me off. Greg Kurstin is still killing it, though.

**letsallpoo** (6): the original woke queen. move over katy

#Has anyone ever heard of Joan Osborn?

**MrSwearword** (10): Lily Allen making a sardonic, acerbic One Of Us and using it to basically say white Jesus is a lie? GODDAMN I LIVE

**vhqv1997** (9): This song is exactly how One of Us by Joan Osborne would sound like if it were written in the 21st century and with more cynicism

**vayyiqra** (7): Lily Allen revisits that perennial question first posed by that 90s alt-rock song, "what if God was one of us?" and the lyrics are very of their time but I like it anyway. P.s. God would definitely stan a wholesome band like CCR.

#Misunderstood the assignment?

**twat\_brained** (7.4): My God just go on a few dates and see for yourself! Or check his Facebook likes or ask his parents or something

I started liking this song way more when I learned what it was about: I heard it was written about a woman refusing to abandon her partner as he went through his drug habit. In a way it's kind of ironic that this comes right after Some Unholy War, which is about the same topic. Even then it's not exactly the most exciting song on the album, so its placement could be forgiven. The repetition and the changes in words as the song goes on really drive home that point.

---

#Stay, Stay, Stay

**gannade** (10): this is gonna get unfairly trashed

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i love that simple change from I to He in the last chorus that completely changes the song from being about a woman who‚Äôs trying desperately to make her relationship work because she‚Äôs afraid of being alone, to a love song about a couple who want to work through a tough time because they want to be together.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): omg those harps at the bridge are amazing and the little piano part at the end too is cool. I love the chorus and the way she says I won‚Äôt go.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): this is poppier and nice

**Albert\_Cole** (8.6): Is somebody jingling a purse of coins in the background? Seriously though - Adele's insecurity is palpable and raw

**1998tweety** (8.5): I'm glad the last chorus went a bit harder than the ones before but I still feel like a little something was missing. Maybe belting a bit at the end could've added that one thing missing.

**Leixander** (8): this sounds like something you would hear at a classy small cafe with a piano that has a random but talented person playing it, which is nice but not really special

**MrSwearword** (8): not exceptional but very good

**nooodisaster** (8): hewontgobuthegoes

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Definitely one of the most simple songs on 21, but it's a welcome track since the past three ones have been relied a bit on Adele's range. There's some nice lyrics here, and I definitely enjoy the lowkey rhythm.

**vayyiqra** (8): Unexpected bop.

**tapdancingpig** (7.7): Probably the weakest song on the track list, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to rate it lower. It‚Äôs a little too repetitive for this style of song, and the melody is less special than the others, but I still come back to this one. This is a weird thing to say about an Adele song, but the production holds this song together. Those drums... the piano... the strings... the fucking harp... Urgh Rick Rubin‚Äôs mind.

**A\_Zucchini** (7): The first few seconds sounds like Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst lmfao I think this song is underrated, but obviously not as bombastic and emotional as the other tracks. Adele feels like she's being held back by the instrumentation here, which maybe why it isn't as much of a standout performance. I do like the groovy guitar licks sprinkled throughout the song.

**akanewasright** (7): About as fillery as the album gets. Which says how fucking AWESOME this album is.

**awryj** (7): almost funky... i like it

#Leaving

**qetaz** (7): I really like the meaning behind this song, but it‚Äôs just not as interesting to listen to as some of the other songs on the album.

**vhqv1997** (7): Everytime I listen to the album I forget that this song existed. Good, but really forgettable

**WhatAYagTwist** (7): i like the intro, can a song be just an intro? thanks

**twat\_brained** (5.6): Well you won't go anywhere with this song so can I blame him?

I'll freely admit that I didn't really *get* this song, until I listened to it closely and I read the comments and I found this song was quite relatable to me. Getting over an ex doesn't happen with anger, it really happens when you stop caring and realise how much better off you are anyway. And that's what this song is, the moment Lily stopped caring.

---

#Boy bye

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a motherfucking bop for such a sad song. wish it had a different title, though.

**MrSwearword** (10): it's like a bitchier Since U Been Gone and I am here for it

**1998tweety** (9.1): A nice ballad, the production is still fitting with the rest of the album despite being a slower and softer song. Her vocals fit this song really well too.

**akanewasright** (9): Sometimes I would forget that Lily Allen was a person and not just sarcasm machine. This song kind of hit me hard because of that. She‚Äôs still not holding any punches, but this song is a lot more.. real than the others leading up to this point.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): This is somehow both cathartic and really chill. Lily's not even particularly angry, she just sounds... free

**tapdancingpig** (9): I forgot how much I loved this song. She‚Äôs being 100% unfiltered about a breakup that 100% benefited her, but she‚Äôs not being (overly) bitchy about it. She‚Äôs just being rational. She‚Äôs still the Lily Allen we saw on her debut, but she‚Äôs matured

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): I really like the story she's telling here

**awryj** (8): this is giving me major Cosmic/No More Rain vibes so I'm sure it will also end up with a 6.5 average :( deserves better than that!!

**vayyiqra** (8): This would be the most generic electropop single in 2009 but I like it as a throwback to that time. Idk, it's really nice.

**vhqv1997** (8): For a break-up song essentially telling the ex to git gone, this song could have definitely been more savage

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Probably the most "bland" track on the album, but the airy chorus is just divine.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): This is a nice example of Lily's subverted lyricism that I don't think gets mentioned enough. It's not rare for pop songs to celebrate getting over a bad ex, but Lily makes this song so subdued, relaxed, and gentle-sounding to the point where I dare say it seems like she's espousing actual maturity.

#Bad breakup

**A\_Zucchini** (7.2): Wasn't blown away, had some reservations with the weird production choice on the piano accompaniment. I really dig the tonal shifts going on in the track though.

**qetaz** (7): Not her finest moment lyrically but still nice to listen too. The producers on this album did a great job.

**twat\_brained** (6.2): I'm sorry, I got distracted because I saw Billie Eilish was invited to react to the Teens React episode featuring her. Let's give this another listen. EDIT: Okay it's cute but it doesn't sound convincing that she's happy to be single again

After a series of downtempo tracks since Tears Dry, there's an attempt to end the album on a lighthearted note, I suppose? The US version does not have this track, I believe, and maybe it's better for it. It feels weird. At the same time, it feels totally Amy, and her voice carries songs like this one, and some songs from Frank. And, living in Amsterdam, she's totally right; buy your own fucking weed, people.

---

#Dude weed lmao

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck it "more than any dick did" is kinda juvenile but i love it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): as someone from a town of stoners this one a mood

**WhatAYagTwist** (10): the only song not about men in this album i think? amazing nonetheless

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): I think of this one as a B-side or bonus track, because Spotify only had the fucking stupid US edition with remixes at the end for a long time. But Addicted is delightful. The lyrics are a LOT lighter than the rest of the album, with the topic just being about someone stealing her weed. It‚Äôs an odd amount of fun, and ‚Äúso I can get mine, and you get yours‚Äù gets stuck in my head way more than you‚Äôd expect.

**twat\_brained** (9.3): That title has really not aged well. That being said I'm gonna check out Frank because I loved this album!

**Leixander** (9): prolly the most joyful song in this album, i love how silly it is

**vhqv1997** (9): What I take away from this song is that none of Amy's boyfriends had a good enough dick game for her to quit weed

**1998tweety** (8.5): A good closer, at times the mixing sounds a bit off though.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This is...a morbid ending to the album, hahaha...anyway, I'm not a fan of the lyrics, except for the novelty of hearing an old-timey soul song about weed, but I actually really like how the music sounds-it's familiar, in a good way, like what you hear at the end of an old movie.

**A\_Zucchini** (8): Solid closer, liking her nasally range, it really complements her vocal stylings. Approve highly of the smoke all of my weed line that shit is shady asf

**akanewasright** (8): This wasn‚Äôt available in the US for YEARS, so around 2015, I got a MAJOR shock with this one. It‚Äôs so different from the rest of the album. I usually stop at He Can Only Hold Her, because it‚Äôs just so odd in the context of the album. It‚Äôs really fun though!

**MrSwearword** (8): I think there's some camp value here which is fine but umm yeah...she's singing a soul tune about weed.

#Some Unholy War On Drugs

**nooodisaster** (7.5): "No Scrubs", but suffering depression.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.4): The rush is worth the price I pay

**vayyiqra** (7): The word edgy has lost all meaning to me now, but whatever I'm glad I listened to this album finally.

**awryj** (4): don't do drugs kids

**qetaz** (4): I am not into this song and I‚Äôm so upset that it closes this phenomenal album. Not only do I dislike it, It‚Äôs thematically different and it seems like it‚Äôs trying to end the album light heartedly, almost comically. The rest of the album is soul-bearing stuff and I feel like it cheapens it to have this at the end.

There isn't much to say about a rather generic ballad, except again that Adele's voice is (depending on your taste) exceptionally able to carry a boring song. And I mean. If you've had a bad breakup, or lost a friend or something for no reason, it's still so easy to relate to this. That aside, personally this song isn't really a deep cut to me; maybe a result of listening to 21 in the car constantly and knowing it back to front.

#Remember remember

**akanewasright** (10): THAT KEY CHANGE THOUGH!

**awryj** (10): Adele going from Turning Tables to this made a point

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is just so sad oh my gosh

**tapdancingpig** (10): The Song that REALLY shows the influence American bluegrass music had on her. Her vocal just hits you HARD, and that key change is everything.

**vhqv1997** (10): I was starting to cry to this song then I remembered that I don't have an ex

**1998tweety** (9.3): Adele's vocals and lyrics are great regardless of what the instrumentals are.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): this is borderline mom music from the 90's but I don't caaaare

**A\_Zucchini** (8.6): First instance of acoustic steel string in the album and back-to-back ballads, could your fav pull it off like this hoe could? Another song that really let's Adele flex her vocal range - I'm noticing that she really has control over her opened vowels and not letting them reach into that super nasally territory that other singers like Ellie Goulding, or Rihanna often do. Subtle key change also works great, I am a big fan of this one! The ending to the track, like with a few others seems a little awkward but maybe that's the best that you can do with a song like that.

**Leixander** (8.5): :kimbryell: in real life

#Would rather forget

**nooodisaster** (7.5): The first song on the album that's not instantly a classic. It's a bit average, but average on this album is still a tour de force.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.4): You changed, or he changed, or the reason he loved you was eclipsed by other personality traits of yours. I don't think it can be much more complex than that

**twat\_brained** (7.3): the key change seems little more than a novelty; doesn't addmuch to this already unhappening song

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Not the biggest fan of the slight country-ness of it. Adele sounds great as usual, and the bridge is great, but it just has a slightly awkward rhythm and it feels a little off to me.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Typical ballad in the middle of 21, something that soccer moms probably love discovering once they use their credit card purchase this album. It's not too bad, though; it's fairly memorable and it definitely doesn't deserve to be skipped most of the time.

**qetaz** (7): I think this would be a better song if it was three minutes rather than four minutes long.

**vayyiqra** (7): This is an Adele song, I guess. :/

**WhatAYagTwist** (6): i was hearing this song but uh i think a fly passed me

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): no, I don‚Äôt remember this forgettable production and average lyricism

**gannade** (3): Adele found the Xtina button in the recording studio

**MrSwearword** (1): no bitch; I don't remember that nor do I remember you sounding like a fucking adaptation of a Nicolas Sparks book.

I like this song, though it could be more interesting. It's soft, picks up just enough for the chorus as it goes along. One of the best covers in this rate. Also, comparing this song to certain other songs in this rate (Wake Up Alone, Just Friends to a lesser extent) the use of the word *alone* is very interesting in contrast. The lit major jumped out

I'm kinda shook this lasted so long, though. I thought we hated slow songs

---
**ImADudeDuh** (10): :sadhug:

**mudkip1** (10): so beautiful and smooth

**NuneEtsuko** (9.6): Flawless cover tbh

**akanewasright** (9): Probably the single most relaxed song on the album. I play this to go to sleep sometimes.

**nooodisaster** (9): Me loving this song is how I know deep down I'm a secret-emo gay.

**qetaz** (9): A beautiful cover of a beautiful song.

**tapdancingpig** (9): Great cover of a classic. She really made it her own.

**vhqv1997** (9): I didn't even know this was a cover so it's probably hers now

**1998tweety** (8.6): As the second to last song, this feels well placed.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): candice glover did it better tbh

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Another slow one but makes more of a compelling case to keep attentive than some of the other cuts here

**gannade** (8): A good cover but it's not really my thing

**vayyiqra** (8): Generic title and acousticness aside, this is surprisingly nice.

**WhatAYagTwist** (8): the guitar keeps it interesting ok ok

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): too long

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I never knew this was a Cure song until now, or that the original wasn't apparently as bossa nova...anyway, Adele may not be the type of singer you'd expect to be in such a genre, but I still enjoy this. It's not as good as some of the other tracks here, but it's still sweet and it manages to stand out as musically unique.

**A\_Zucchini** (6.9): Very deliberately emphasising the minor key that this is written in, which isn't a bad thing to do per se, but there isn't enough bite in Adele's delivery here to justify the instrumentation choice. Not a bad song, but largely forgettable considering the songs surrounding it.

**Leixander** (6): however far away, i will always love you is a cliche line but it still sounds so good from her, the song overstays its welcome though. prolly the only song that really bored me in this album.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): The slowest song on the album, and it just drags on forever.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): wow this is really a front-loaded album where it starts with a good streak of songs that are absolute 10‚Äôs, then we enter a ballad-streak territory. thank god she left ‚ÄúSomeone Like You‚Äù as the album closer, though

**MrSwearword** (5): normally I read singers in their 20s telling their lovers for making them "feel young again" but the production is just atmospheric enough to have me refrain from reading this bitch for blood

**perfumevee** (5): Not a big fan of this cover.
