**vayyiqra** (5): This really did nothing for me either way, I am completely neutral on it so I guess I should give it a 5. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

This is... a cover, I guess. It's kind of a bop and it suits her voice a lot. I don't have a lot to say about these bonus tracks (like a dozen people did the bonus rate lol), so let's get to it soon.

---
**MrSwearword** (10): a really cute cover and Lily retains her style. Apparently this cover is "hated" but as with "American Pie" by Madonna, all fans of the original version are trash and jaded snobs.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a bop! The lyrics are rather childish, but then she didn't write it. The production is very dated, but I can still fuck with this. It makes me happy.

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): It’s ot of fun, but wouldn’t listen to it a hundred times.

I used to think this was a good cover, but it's... rather bleh. It shouldn't be acoustic, and it always throws me off when the distorted *womanizer* before the chorus isn't there. However, I can hear the lyrics in this, so maybe it has some points over the original.

---
**ignitethephoenix** (9): This is a really great cover of the song; her voice just suits the song really well.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Not quite as great as the Britney version, but still pretty good nonetheless

**NuneEtsuko** (7.8): Great cover but I can't get over the greatness of the original to fully appreciate this

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): the lyrics are on brand for her

**tapdancingpig** (6): Hot take: Womanizer may be iconic, but it’s also one of Britney’s weakest singles. Part of what made it work (to the extent that it worked) was the production, which can’t save Lily here. I love the sound of the band, but for this song, you need someone digitally fucking with the vocals.

**vayyiqra** (6): I don't love this and the lyrical theme has been done better. Fuckboys won, I guess.

**MrSwearword** (1): NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS. Leave a good Britney song alone

An anthem for personal growth? You don't really see songs like this often, a song where both people have to improve themselves to be ready for a relationship. Plus, this song is instrumentally one of the most underrated bangers on 21, with a lot of influences that people more knowledgeable than me show off in the comments.

Until my last score, this song was barely in day 1, which would've made it funnier to point at /u/awryj's comment, but it's still kinda funny this way.

---
**Albert\_Cole** (10): I can't relate personally but I do know someone in this sort of situation. Also this is a banger

**awryj** (9): okay this is a bop, see you on day 2

**nooodisaster** (9): And we're back to icon-town! This song is just pure fun, joyous, blind optimism, and it's always been a favorite of mine. Also the older sis to 25's future best song, "Water Under the Bridge."

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This is definitely the best deep cut I've discovered from this rate. I really, really, like this. It's a mix of gospel and Billy Joel sounds, and it's a great way to show off Adele's vocal chops without inserting another typical ballad into the tracklist. I'd love to hear more songs from her that resemble this one.

**PuggleMaster** (9): Kinda serving European truck simulator sound track

**vhqv1997** (9): Queen of pre-emptively apologizing to her ex for writing mean songs about him. Taylor can't relate

**1998tweety** (8.8): This song could've easily been the opener or closer, it fits both roles well but I can see why RITD and SLY get those spots instead.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Low key a bop

**tapdancingpig** (8.4): I always forget that this song is on the album, because it’s so sonically different than the rest of it. It gets stuck in my head a lot more than the other deep cuts. It goes on a little too long, but it’s still a great track.

**akanewasright** (8): Probably the oddest moment in the album, sonically. It’s great though.

**qetaz** (8): The most fun on the album. It reminds me of a Gospel song. Love the harmonies in the chorus.

**vayyiqra** (8): Now we're bopping again.

**A\_Zucchini** (7.8): Really big Elton John vibes here, especially with the trumpet runs at the start. The drummer could be doing a little more at the higher points of the track, and really emphasize the more climactic points. This low-key, middle-key and high-key bops, but it just needs that little bit more extra you feel

**twat\_brained** (7.3): 🤠🤠🤠Also it sounds different from how I remember it. Not sure I can see Adele continuing in this direction though. A one-off every now and then works to her advantage.

#Already gone

**Leixander** (7): He Won't Go part two with a random sax but even less special

**WhatAYagTwist** (7): why does the beat just cut oooofff at least the horns save this song

**MrSwearword** (0): this shit is bland in a way that pisses me off enough to nuke this to hell

If this wasn't the song you played when you thought about your first straight crush you might've been doing the whole gay thing wrong. I mean honestly. The fact that this ballad went far beyond her other ones in this ranking says enough. Some of her best lyrics on a non-single and her vocals never ever disappoint.

---
#The One (By Kylie Minogue)

**akanewasright** (10): Honestly, this have been my 11. It’s such traditional SOUL, and that bridge (with that key change) is so perfect and captivating and UGH.

**gannade** (10): Beautiful

**mtachi** (10): This was one of my favourite songs when I was younger and going through first love pains.

**tapdancingpig** (10): Easily my favorite of the non-singles. It’s such a traditional soup song. Adele kills it, and that bridge is probably my favorite moment on the album. Such an weird, perfect direction to take the song.

**vhqv1997** (10): Such an amazing deep cut. I stand by my belief that this is the best ballad by Adele

**Albert\_Cole** (9.5): I want to say these words to someone but I won't

**NapsAndNetflix** (9): can't wait for this to be dragged for being too long!

**PuggleMaster** (9): good filler

**1998tweety** (8.6): The longest song on the album, while its not my favourite it also doesn't drag on for too long.

**A\_Zucchini** (8.6): Is it just me or am I hearing a little bit of Sara Barrongles at the start here? It might just be the modulated chords going on in the background. The latter part of the song is where it really shines, that organ is placed perfectly, props to the songwriter there. Adele really did old-school soul some fucking justice in this song. PS: I WOULD RAAAAATHER BE BLIIIIIIIND

**nooodisaster** (8.5): If this wasn't 6 minutes long I would fuck with it. EDIT: WTF, I still fuck with it?!! 21-era Adele was so powerful, omg.

#This ain't it

**awryj** (7): a reminder to get this one on my potential wedding slowdance playlist

**Leixander** (7): that beat switch or whatever that was didn't interest me at all oop

**qetaz** (7): For the first minute or two I was thinking that this was really worked for me, and I really love the bridge/harmony part, but it definitely does not need to be as long as it is.

**vayyiqra** (7): This is good but it really doesn't need to be this long, and I fuck with long songs.

**twat\_brained** (6.4): The way she's singing this, it's not hard to make a distinction between this and the injuries she suffered to her throat shortly thereafter. Also, this would've worked better if there were about 2 minutes removed from it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5.7): i cry for Adele’s vocal cords whenever she belts out those big notes

**MrSwearword** (5): if I give it a mediocre song/rating, will it go away?

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): On an album that manages to avert being a collection of overly similar ballads, this is the only song to completely fall into the stereotype of albums by singers with huge vocal ranges having filler songs left and right. It's nowhere near tragic, but this doesn't have the perfect melodies of almost all the tracks on 21. It's essentially just Adele belting into the microphone. Some people may like that, hut I don't.

**WhatAYagTwist** (5): uhhhh

Entering the top 20 and we see the first 11 fall. You guys made it a long way, all things considered, but this song should've made it higher. I talked about Amy's subdued songs way back when Just Friends was cut out, and I would just repeat all of that. This song is about one of the feelings everyone might've experienced, but is still kind of niche: the feeling you get when you lie in bed and everything you don't want to think about catches up with you. A few people in the comments made the connection with alcohol that this song also could be about, and that just makes it even more sad.

---
#:emofishhug:

**tapdancingpig** (10): I remembered this song being one of the weaker ones (which would still be a highlight on someone else’s album), but listening to it again, it hit me a lot harder than it did then. The lyrics here are top notch and the title line has a really effective use of text painting. Edit: Someone theorized about this song being about sobriety, and I went back and listened to it again with that lens and cried. I boosted my score to a 10 as a result.

**WhatAYagTwist** (10): the underrated queenie of this album

**qetaz** (9): Some of her most gorgeous vocals, and also some great lyrics. “Run around so I don’t have to think about thinking.” I cind this incredibly relatable to some tough times I’ve been going through.

**1998tweety** (8.9): Personally this song does a better job than the slower songs previous. The lyrics feel more emotional and they hit me harder.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): I thought this would be relatable content - it isn't quite but it's still good

**akanewasright** (8.5): Not my favorite, but it’s just wrenching.

**Leixander** (8.5): :emofish:

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Ugh, these lyrics are destroying my soul. In a good way, but still, DAMN. ;_;

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Wait I was browsing Tumblr I wasn't paying attention to the lyrics. Then again, I wasn't compelled to change it so it's good enough for me then

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I think this is one of the most underrated songs on the album. It's just as heartbreaking as Love Is A Losing Game or Back to Black, and the fact that it sounds so mundane makes it all the more depressing. Listening it makes me feel that it's very autobiographical, even more than some of the other tracks.

**vhqv1997** (8): I feel like this song ended too short, the moment I thought it would reach a climax, the entire song dissipated

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.6): another drinking referenced song :’(

#At least I'm not drinking?

**A\_Zucchini** (7.3): Didn't really blow me away, but there was some cool stuff going on with the guitar and the backing vocals. Maybe I just need to listen to this track more, but yeah wasn't a huge standout.

**vayyiqra** (7): I lowkey kind of like the doo-wop style out of nostalgia, but nothing more than that.

**MrSwearword** (5): this is boring and doesn't really go anywhere

This song is cute, and not the "cute" where you mean it's kinda bad but you don't wanna say that; it's just a cute song about Lily's mom, and daily life and missing someone. It's such a comfortable song, one that you can always escape to and listen to with a smile on your face, but kind of in a very aesthetically sad way. Get me?

---
#Loves their mom

**awryj** (10): My favorite deep-cut from this album. It's just the sweetest and the saddest thing ever. It makes me feel like laying on a couch, wrapping my sad ass in multiple layers of blankets and [pretending to be Witness-era Katy](https://i.gyazo.com/85d533f32f3dd37b40f17a5e980e54a4.gif).

**Leixander** (10): cutest song ever? probably. kinda leaves me teary eyed sometimes for personal reasons hehe

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): another filler, but a mega bop, so…

**nooodisaster** (10): I fricking love my Mom, okay? This song is such a beautiful depiction of a love that's rarely represented in songs. The lyrics felt so personal to my experience, from getting Chinese takeout to walking the dog together. I'm sure tons of people feel the same way, and that just makes this song more impressive.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): when i first saw the title of this song i was afraid it was going to be racist somehow but then it was just a cute bop about getting chinese food

**mtachi** (9.5): This sounds like a cosy night in.

**akanewasright** (9): Sweet Lily is as amazing as mean Lily.

**vhqv1997** (9): Another gorgeously sweet bop. Invented the People's Republic of China. I love how the relationship depicted in this song could either be platonic, familial or romantic. What's important is the intimate connection between two people who are comfortable doing mundane things with each other.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): Queen of having low expectations

**twat\_brained** (8.6): I'll be honest, the title left a LOT to the imagination for me. And I was pleasantly surprised, and with quite an adorable song too!

**A\_Zucchini** (8.5): Nice wholsom Lilly Allen is my aesthetic I've realised, this was very sweet and lovely and beautiful

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): This song is just so wholesome and sweet and loveable

**1998tweety** (8): Chinese is such a weird title for a song.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Alison Gold outpeaked Little Mix by about 20 spots on the hot 100.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I've seen a few people call this the most British song on the album, and I'm not completely sure what that means, but I'll agree just for the heck of it. That label makes sense, somehow. I appreciate Lily giving our cuisine a shoutout, at any rate. Nice, simple song that's sad when you think about it.

**qetaz** (8): This is so sweet. I love songs like this which celebrate the mundane everyday events that make up life.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Feelings Lily continues to slay other pop girls. This one is about spending time with her mom after touring, and it’s just lovely.

**vayyiqra** (8): Because of the "Lily Allen is racist!!" thing I was primed to think this song would be offensive but it's just a cute little song about domesticity and I cannot get enough of them, idk why.

**mudkip1** (7): this is really corny but also really cute and charming

#Would rather get Thai, I guess

**MrSwearword** (6): the only misstep because this is essentially a precursor to Folding Clothes by J. Cole #ALMONDMilk #JColeRuinsLivesSTAYWOKE

**ExtraEater** (5): title vs. lyrics

**WhatAYagTwist** (5): she doesn't get tired of the arpeggiated melodies

Amazing trumpets, first of all. I believe the Dap-King Horns (known for their feature on Kesha's *Woman*, buy Rainbow on iTunes) did the horns on this album. She also gets to show her vocals a bit, and they're amazing, because of course they are. The final song on the US version of the album, this is maybe a more suitable ending. Signing off with "So he tries to pacify her/But what's inside her never dies" is just a little bit morbid, though.

---
**twat\_brained** (10): Amy was an absolute master at making upbeat songs with such a somber undertone to her. That's what I've decided I miss most about her

**vhqv1997** (10): I give this a 10 for that trumpet. Such an underappreciated song.

**WhatAYagTwist** (10): those melodies are to die for fsocpojpoap

**awryj** (9): a bop

**Leixander** (9): classy

**1998tweety** (8.8): A lot of albums start off good and go downhill or the opposite, so I appreciate that this album is fairly consistent.

**A\_Zucchini** (8.7): This instrumentation is SO good lol. Amy can do some really impressive runs, shame she never really gets the chance to show off what she can really do, and this song proves she has the talent.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): This one is kind of a secret gut punch. The production is very typical upbeat Mark Ronson, but the lyrics are so dark. This was the end of the version I listened to for about a year, and I sometimes stop here, just because I think this is a more appropriate ending to the album.

**akanewasright** (8): This is one of those songs that you think is fun until you really listen to the lyrics. Then it gets really dark (still good though).

**nooodisaster** (8): Quite catchy. I'm not usually a huge fan of singers talking about themselves in the 3rd person in songs. Still, this album is DEPRESSING.

**qetaz** (8): So nice to listen to. I think the instruments really stand out here- love the brass, love the drums.

**vayyiqra** (8): Melanie Martinez is shook by this bop

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I love the parts where she goes 'he tries to pacify her', though this is only about the same quality as Some Unholy War for me.

**MrSwearword** (7): boring but her singing is cute here

Just a really sad song about trying your hardest and still failing. How'd you get here? No one knows, but sometimes you just feel lost. Anyway, anyone care to talk about Taylor Swift?

---
#Taylor Swift?

**awryj** (10): I'm sure 99% of the comments will compare this song to Taytay's 22 but... honestly, what a drop in quality it is. Taylor's 22 is a bop but bopping and having an existential crisis >>> bopping and dressing up like heepstuuurrrs

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): insert taylor swift joke

**vhqv1997** (9): I don't know about you, but I can't wait to read all the petty comments about Taylor Swift

**1998tweety** (8.7): This sounds so different from Taylor's 22; Taylor is a party bop, while Lily's is introspective reflection.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): So i guess if you title your song 22, it just won't be a good song then.

#22

**Leixander** (10): i am not even 22 but mood


**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9.5): i’m currently 22, I currently have a nice viewpoint in my life at my current state, and i’m terrified i'll end up like the person in this song when i’m almost 30

**qetaz** (9): Lily knocks it out of the park again. I love the piano breakdown bit.

**A\_Zucchini** (8.6): Love love LOVE this track. The sentiment and the positive reception reaffirms the Second Truth: Society is trash.

**akanewasright** (8): Such a sad takedown of misogyny.

**nooodisaster** (8): "cuz all she wants is a boyfriend; she gets one night stands." Every gay boy's face just cracked.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This had a hard trouble standing out on the album too me until recently, when I realised that I liked the chorus quite a lot. Ageism is rarely tackled in songs as a societal problem, so I find Lily bringing this up quite worthy of appreciation. It's a bit sad that the issues she mentions here ended up affecting her career.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): kind of depressing

**vayyiqra** (8): This bops, Lily Allen you have won my heart, marry me you messy British ladette. Did this invent feminism and anti-ageism? No, but it's still relevant. Wtf Lily Allen is woke.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.7): From the first line I thought "oh no" and it just got sadder from there. It goes o f f tho

#30

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I’m 22 and I can’t relate to this song lol but I guess that’s a good thing though?

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I don't know about you, but I feel like I'm on a comedown from the first few tracks. I guess it's good to hook listeners in before easing them into the album in a sense

**MrSwearword** (7): It's a case of production and the theme of the song overshadowing vocals and the fact two absolute bangers played right before.

**tapdancingpig** (7): Probably my least favorite on the album. It’s still got its message and it’s mocking of standards, but it’s... kind of boring and it feels dated.

**WhatAYagTwist** (7): actually kind of entertaining

The lesser demo of the bonus tracks. It's gorgeous and all, but the album version is better, and Some Unholy War (Down Tempo) is better, and it's just not very great.

**perfumevee** (9): Wow, beautiful.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): One of my favorites tracks on the album in its early stages. This demo is literally just Amy singing and playing the guitar. Chord changes are late and the melody isn’t as polished, but the song is as affecting as ever, and it’s always interesting to see how a song evolves.

**vayyiqra** (7): I normally can't fuck with acoustic music, but it's refreshing to hear this since it's not her usual style.

Invented climate activism. Al Gore is shook.

But really this is a second-rate version of The Fear, which is why it was its b-side. There's a reason it's a bonus track, which is that it's just not the same quality.

---
**letsallpoo** (10): ended global warming

**vayyiqra** (8): I expected something a lot edgier or just plain awful from what I had heard about this song. Lyrically it just seems like a generic protest song about 2000s neoconservatives, and musically I really like it. The title was definitely a choice though. (Although I'm not sure if she is claiming Islam is a terrorist religion because if she is, yikes.)

This album should've opened with The Fear, this is kinda... kinda not good. It's *fine*, it does its job, but it doesn't really stand out at all. And it's also where Lily's style goes past parody into preachy. It's just not a good intro.

#Putting their hands up

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Ms. Allen snapped.

**PuggleMaster** (10): I wasn't expecting to love the first so on this. Consider me shook

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of calling us all drug addicts

**vhqv1997** (10): Don't do drugs, kids

**1998tweety** (9.5): I went into this rate knowing that Amy and Adele are amazing, but I hadn't heard Lily before. I was pleasantly surprised with this first song. The production is very good.

**Leixander** (9.5): such a great intro to this classic pop album

**vayyiqra** (9): This album is more my style and I can tell right from the outset. It's more upbeat and electro sounding and this is a catchy little bop with relatable lyrics. Wtf I love Lily Allen now.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Is that dubstep or something? Also isn't this just the plot of Skins? Or Tove Lo's debut single for that matter? (btw that should be the shitpost)

**A\_Zucchini** (8.2): Vibe hard with the production, but it can be really muddy at times, especially when the crash drum gets violated at the end of the chorus. Lotsa voice modulation, but it all works so I can't complain about that too much. Nice catchy intro chune for the headtop

**MrSwearword** (8): a great opener, even if it's not that great outside of its album position.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is a weird opener. It's a great song and a perfect introdution to Lily's lyricism, but unlike the nursery rhyme melodies the rest of the album contains, this is an angry electropop song. Lily goes really hard here, and while I think some of the lines kind of play a little too much into big pharma conspiracies, I still appreciate what she's trying to say.

**WhatAYagTwist** (8): that's a strong intro for sure, too many synths tho, overwhelming a bit

#I already made a war on drugs joke in this rate

**awryj** (7.5): do drugs kids. kind of a weird way to start an album but it goes off

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Don’t do drugs kids cause Lily Allen said you shouldn’t and it’s problem.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Almost immediately, this album becomes gets the title of most depressing in a rate that is not necesarily happy

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): This one is probably one of the weaker tracks from the album, but it still hooks you in for the rest of the album. Greg Kurstin is a large part of that: the man is production genius. The lyrics are a touch preachy, but they’re blunt and cutting in typical Lily fashion.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.4): I hate to sound snooty but... I'm not at it. Not due to morals or a good upbringing or anything, you understand - I've just never come across any

**akanewasright** (7): This one doesn’t do much for me, but it’s a half decent tone setter, I guess.

**qetaz** (7): Lily immediately sets the tone for the album with some social commentary and electro pop. Cool production and some great lyrics, but there are few places where they do fall down.

**nooodisaster** (6): Unfortunately, the album opens with perhaps its weakest song. This felt preachy and blunt when I was a middle schooler, and definitely hasn't gotten better with maturity. Lines like "The kids are in danger" are sooo cliche to the point of feeling like self-parody. We stan forever that they didn't go through with using this as the lead single.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): man i really hope the rest of the album isnt like this

And here we finally cross into the 8 average, with this song (Originally called "Fuckery", as some commenters note), about Nas. Who she may or may not have had an affair with, but she definitely had two collabs with, which are... okay. I digress. It's a bop. Just a funny, sassy, lighthearted bop, which is tough to find on an album like this, but a welcome change.

---

**letsallpoo** (8): this reminds me of a PE teacher i had who was called mr jones who i really wanted to fuck

---

**akanewasright** (10): This will probably get screwed out of what it deserves, but “what kind of fuckery” is one of the best opening lines to a verse ever.

**Leixander** (10): it is just me and.. MR JOOONESSS

**MrSwearword** (10): a great song but FUN FACT, this has a messy mythos behind it because this is allegedly about her tryst with NAS. The one with Kelis tattooed on his arm...THAT Nas.

**tapdancingpig** (10): Probably the most retro song of the bunch. The girl group harmonies and backing vocals are the best, especially when they’re harmonizing in words like “dick to me.” Probably the most fun song on the record, because anger is easier to bop to than heart wrenching sadness.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): omg the way she said fuckery literally cracked me the fuck up fdGHGHFS

**vhqv1997** (9): Wasn't this song initially named "Fuckery"?

**WhatAYagTwist** (9): WHAT KINDAAA FUCKERY IS THIS

**1998tweety** (8.6): Amy emulates this retro style so well I constantly forget that she's from this time period.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Did u/mrswearword ghostwrite this? It makes clear and extensive use of one of his favorite words

**ExtraEater** (8): just me now sadly

**nooodisaster** (8): "what kind of fuckery" YAAAAAAAAASSS

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): If there's anything this song's made me realise, it's that 'fuckery' is an inherently funny word. I mean, it's even the song's subtitle. The best thing about it in general is that I expected it to be some sort of classy lovers' track from the title and the opening lines and it becomes what it is. Still a great song.

**A\_Zucchini** (7.4): Sass levels off the chart yeesh. WhAt SorT oF fuCkeRy iS tHIs? I wish this was a little more re-listenable though, gets a bit boring the first few times through.

**Albert\_Cole** (7.3): More than usual she sounds messy and/or drunk - to deliberate effect, of course. It sounds like she's stumbled into the room to shout confusingly at Mr Jones

**ignitethephoenix** (7): This song kind of ends abruptly to me? It’s alright other than that.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): lets be honest, still won't be as iconic as the song the title is based on

**qetaz** (7): Amy’s voice always shines, and as usual the production is also great, but the song itself isn’t doing that much for me.

**vayyiqra** (7): So this album so far feels like the soundtrack to a 50s diner but with edgier lyrics and I'm not mad.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): “what kind of fuckery is this?” is a great lyric

**PuggleMaster** (5): I didn't realize this song ended until halfway through the next song

**akanewasright** (9): I would have given this a 10 if it didn’t remind me of that fucking T-Pain song. IT’S SO SWEET THOUGH.

**A\_Zucchini** (8.7): You know what... I'm going to say it... the T-Pain remix improved this song...

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): reminder that 5 O'Clock is her highest peaking song

**twat\_brained** (8.1): It's okay but it would've been better if T-Pain left it alone

**MrSwearword** (8): it's fine, but the only reason people care about this in the first place is that T-Pain can take an unexpected sample source and turn it into the base for a pretty good song for him.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I actually only knew this song from the T-Pain sample, for some reason, and I like the actual vibe the original track has better compared to that one. A genuine heartfelt song from Lily is not what I was waiting for on this record, but the way she describes a relationship blossoming is honestly adorable. Her voice here is also super cute.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): t-pain's mind

#People who aren't talking about T-Pain

**awryj** (10): 2008, the year before It’s Not Me, It’s You came out, Allen posted the song on her MySpace and added “I ripped off the chorus from Take That and can’t be bothered with the paperwork”, referencing its similarities to Take That’s “Shine”. aaah legend



**mtachi** (10): The sample is brilliant, and I think that Lily Allen’s lyrics speak to me now more than ever. My love only grows.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): honestly one of the most beautiful songs ever and very aesthetic to put on in the morning

**1998tweety** (9.8): I actually remember this song from my childhood, brings back nice memories.


**PuggleMaster** (9): I didn't know this was a actual song i'm shook

**tapdancingpig** (9): This one is just so sweet. I like Lily having feelings other than disgust and anger. Who’s have known?

**vhqv1997** (9): What a cute song. Even though the chorus was copied from another song, this is still an adorable bop.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.9): This is more than the legally sanctioned amount of sweetness, Lily is officially not allowed to be British any more. Maybe the Take That sample meant the police let her off


**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This song is really cute, and this type of music really suites her voice.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): she's soft.


**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): that's cute



**vayyiqra** (8): This instrumental was reminding me of 2000s adult alternative like Dido but then she adds a fucking harpsichord, her mind. Also the lyrics are kind of weird but really cute? This reminds me of a good Beatles song.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): “watching telly, drinking wine” lily is this an attack on me


**qetaz** (6): It’s kinda cute but it doesn’t really grab me.

Who can make a song about mocking your partner for impotence and still make it sound amazing? Lily Allen, that's who. And man, is it biting. I would've expected this to make top 10, and it did for a while when the top 10 was more even, but then a lot of people gave it average scores and it sank down to here. I heard this in a gay club once and you best believe I gay screamed

Also, fun fact; this is the first 11 to be out since Wake Up Alone. We should start seeing more of them now.

---

#People who can relate (woo)

**awryj** (10): Ok, I'll be honest - 90% of songs on Golden are worse than Not Fair. Queen of unsatisfying sex.

**didney-worl** (10): One of Lily’s best and most brutal songs.

**gannade** (10): A bop but it always rubbed me the wrong way that she says he's a great guy in the first verse and then in the post chorus says he's "really mean."

**Leixander** (10): wot in tarnation

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i can’t believe that this was a controversial song at some point. IMO, it was lighthearted and fun, really

**MrSwearword** (10): of course Lily Allen can shame a no good man with premature ejaculation and have us on her side.

**nooodisaster** (10): Invented country. Tim McGraw WISHES he could tell a story this rich, emotionally resonant, and socially important. E A T P U S S Y.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): joanne wishes it could pull off a country influenced sex anthem like this

**A\_Zucchini** (9.8): Another hard hitting Y E E T E R of a track. This track and its popularity reaffirms the One Truth: all men are trash.

**twat\_brained** (9.6): Remember to stream "Golden Hour". Also do the 1971 rate

**akanewasright** (9.5): Another song featuring a bright, happy instrumental and dark, biting lyrics.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this sounds like it's a pop verison of a country song

**rotating3Dtext** (9): tell it how it this!

**tapdancingpig** (9): Again, a great continuation of the style that made her a star. Her juxtaposition of really serious lyrics over bright(er) production is a combination that never fails to delight me.

**vhqv1997** (9): Damn girl you know what's really mean? Exposing your perfectly nice boyfriend with a song like this. Not saying you ain't deserve good sex, but you know, how about you talk to him about it first

**1998tweety** (8.6): A more laid-back song compared to the previous two, I like the little twang the banjo(?) or guitar is adding.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I think this is the first Lily Allen song I heard back when I was innocent and didn’t know what this song meant lol. Also RIP this guy who sucks in bed. You tried I suppose.

**PuggleMaster** (8): Joanne is SHAKING

**qetaz** (8): A definite bop, and typically unflinching lyrics from Lily. Will likely be stuck in my head for the rest of the day.

#Not Fair

**vayyiqra** (7): It's ... country-influenced? and I don't hate it? That is a rare gift.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Meh, I'm not a huge fan of this. I really liked how catchy this was on my first few listens but now I think it's a little annoying. The very explicit lyrics are pretty damn jarring, and not in a good way. Also, unlike the other songs on the album, Lily actually sounds mean-spirited here instead of us heavily sarcastic.

**Albert\_Cole** (4.5): This song sounds pretty good musically but the lyrics are weirdly belittling

I've listened to the the Royal Albert Hall concert a couple of times (parents owned it on CD) and it always cracks me up when Adele says that this song is inspired by these revolving tables at Chinese restaurants (Lily Allen who). 

Adele's second best ballad in this rate is a tour de force of vocals and a soft piano backed up by subtle violins. It's quintessential Adele, and it's no surprise it got so close to top 10.

---

#Getting Chinese

**awryj** (10): one of my most favorite Adele songs ever

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love the piano in this song and the drama. Definitely I think one of the more underrated Adele songs (It should have been a hit too!)

**Leixander** (10): one of her best, gives me goosebumps every single time

**mtachi** (10): Turning Tables has always been one of my favourites on the album - so beautiful.

**PuggleMaster** (10): My second favorite song in the rate

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The orchestral instrumentation makes this song such an orgasmic experience

**vhqv1997** (10): Is it bad that I learned of this song through the Gwyneth Paltrow cover?

**nooodisaster** (9.5): There are "Turning Tables" gays and there are "Set Fire to the Rain" gays. Only one is right.

**1998tweety** (9): I like this, it doesn't take me to the levels Someone Like You does, but it at least sounds like its own song instead of a budget version of SLY.

**tapdancingpig** (9): Another underrated single that cuts me to my core.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): omg. i'm having flashbacks to my 2012

**A\_Zucchini** (8.3): Oooooh it's the first ballad and it sounds like The Fray's 'You Found Me', good strategic move there Brain-dele... lmao jokes aside this is an amazing song and I'm loving the introduction of strings to the album here. I'm actually very impressed with her vocal range in this song, even if she doesn't really reach into her belting voice. I just wish that the bridge/refrain was a little more interesting, it feels like it's just transitioning into the last chorus for the sake of having the bridge.

**akanewasright** (8): I love this song, but I performed a cover of it, so every time I hear it, I think of everything that went wrong during that performance. Still holds up though.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): After the two very angry songs that start off the album, this is a more subdued ballad that you may have heard on the radio once or twice; I didn't like it, at first, but over time I've grown to regard its relative simplicity as refreshing. It's the first recognisably intimate song here and it pays off.

**qetaz** (8): Her voice and the instrumental are obviously stunning, however Adele rarely really impresses me with her lyrics and that often stops me giving her perfect scores.

#Would rather watch TV

**twat\_brained** (7.7): I like the piano riff but I never understood the lyrics

**vayyiqra** (7): This has a nice chorus but I forgot it existed until now. :/

**WhatAYagTwist** (7): not a big fan of ballads, but the violins here are energic as fug and her performance gets me

**Albert\_Cole** (6.6): I feel like I understand the gist of this song without actually understanding any of the lyrics. What does "turning tables" mean, is it like flipping the table when you're mad? "I won't ask you to just desert me" - why not? "Where love is lost, your ghost is found" what does that mean? Are these all London expressions that I'm too Northern to get?

**gannade** (6.5): the chorus is pretty but the song is a little too long

**MrSwearword** (5): boring, overwrought and damn near maudlin as shit but at least her vocals are cute.

This song briefly made it into the top 10 (an Amy song fell out), and it would've deserved it. Adele at her sassiest, her banger-iest, her most biting, except Rolling in the Deep. I suppose that Turning Tables (a counterpart to Someone Like You) and this going out back to back is very fitting, but this was still kinda robbed.

---

#:tea:

**akanewasright** (10): Underrated as FUCK! The fact that this didn’t hit #1 makes me more sad than I have any right to be.

**gannade** (10): Love the production. Ryan Tedder snappt on this

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Love the funk and sass behind the song. I love it when Adele does stuff that isn’t ballads. (Also side note the Glee version of this song mashed up with Someone Like You is iconic and one of the best covers from the show).

**ImADudeDuh** (10): adele fucking dragged this bitch

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Also a really good song. I think it's a little more fun than RITD, but nowhere near as iconic.

**tapdancingpig** (10): I feel like this is underrated? Like, how did this not hit #1?

**WhatAYagTwist** (10): i solely stan this song because of a mashup i heard once but it's still damn amazing, the glee version is cute too

**NuneEtsuko** (9.7): Doesn't get old. I always feel badass when singing along to this absolute bop lol.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Hard for me to hate this; tbh I'm not sure how anyone can

**Leixander** (9): spill the tea adele

**nooodisaster** (9): Wow, she really didn't let us breath for this album. "She is half your age/But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed." BIIIIIITTTTCCCCHHH.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I first heard this on the radio when I was thirteen or so and I took a liking to it instantly, probably because of how savage it was. Adele was right; she really is spilling tea everywhere. Aside from the lyrics, which resemble something you'd see in a gossip column, Adele's delivery is the best thing about this; she hardly belts here, except for the bridge, possibly, but but her sassy tone is incredible and the way she rolls her Rs in the chorus is just plain campy in the right way.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): sassy bop

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a massive bop and every time it comes on I feel its power. Side note: the ending is among the top ten anime plot twists.

**vhqv1997** (9): DRAG HIM

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): "rumour has it he's the one i'm leaving you for" woof

**1998tweety** (8.7): The first time I heard it was on an episode of Glee and I always preferred the mashup over the original so whenever I listen to this version sometimes sounds off. I do like the weird structure though.

**Albert\_Cole** (8.7): Ryan Tedder bringing us another banger

**awryj** (8): i know some people love this song and while i appreciate it, i don't really adore it - still, a good song

**qetaz** (8): Her voice shines in the bridge particularly, which is my favourite part of the song. However the actual refrain of “Rumour Has It” is a bit one-note and repeated a few too many times, especially at the end.

**A\_Zucchini** (7.5): Just doesn't compare to the opener, but loving the unexpected backhanded sass our girl is showing here. HERE the backing vocals fit perfectly though, and there's some really lovely textures especially after the first verse (ex: clapping replacing the snare round the 1:30 mark). Good, bordering great, but not quite loved unfortunately.

#:coffee:

**RandomHypnotica** (7): The claps in the pre-chorus are pretty hot, everything else is kind of like a half-warmed burrito. Disappointing but it’ll do

**MrSwearword** (6): "RUMOUR HAS IT...RUMER WILLIS...GOT A BIG JAW" - Willam. I mean that bit is more interesting than this goddamn mediocrity.
