Adele has two country songs in this bonus rate and she does it so incredibly well she could put out a country album and the gays would stan. Joanne who?

**tapdancingpig** (9): I did not expect this one to bop so hard! This one is a very traditional country-soul hybrid and I love it.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I can dig this country version of Adele

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Adele covering a bluegrass song with an acoustic guitar is not something I thought would work but it totally does

**vayyiqra** (6): Lol the first version of this was blocked in my country, why are you so oppressive Canada? Smh. Anyway this doesn't do much for me.

**MrSwearword** (1): what the fuck is this British chick talking about taking transport to "loosianna". iCannot, iWillnot, iRefuse, iShant

deleted: So I'm predicting we'll lose set fire to the rain and fuck you early, and then have a whole run of Amy songs. I predict the fear will be #4, and the top 3 will be someone like you, rehab, and rolling in the deep.

Fingers crossed and preparing for blood because these songs are all giants.

Soft, pleasant, but not very exciting, I suppose. This made it slightly too far, which I attribute to MrSwearword giving this a 10 and all the other ones like, a 2. <3

---
**MrSwearword** (10): WOW SOMETHING LISTENABLE AND ENJOYABLE FROM THIS FAKAKTA ERA. PUT THIS ON THE ALBUM PROPER

**mudkip1** (10): one of my favorite adele songs

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): This kind of reminds me of Someone Like You. It’s not as effective or memorable, but it would have worked as a closer, and it’s just as simple, albeit with guitars instead of a piano.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): A little slow

**vayyiqra** (7): Getting a bit of a Jeff Buckley vibe from this guitar.

This instrumental is just incredible. I love this way more than I do the actual version, and it's not close. The slow background marching drums make this song sound like inevitability, not urgency.

---
**NuneEtsuko** (10): Dang son, this song just does something to me, I physically react to the perfection of it, especially after I watched "Amy" the movie, my heart just sinks thinking of Amy singing it to that fucker she was in love with.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I think I like this version more than the original

**MrSwearword** (8): better than the album version but umm this is too downtrodden even for Amy standards.

**tapdancingpig** (8): This one is really interesting. The slower tempo and instrumental kind of remove the urgency of the piece, but the vibe that’s left is rather creepy (those backing vocals help with this).

**vayyiqra** (8): I was certain from the title this would be an edgy Lily Allen song where she drags neoconservatives about the invasion of Iraq, and I was here for it. Instead I got this very unexpected, spooky and atmospheric song. Stream The Good War by Kimbra on Spotify!

This song got surprisingly far. I never expected it to make top 10, let alone knock out Not Fair, Rumour Has It and Turning Tables. It's a slow song, with fairly repetitive lyrics, and yet here it is. Amy's power. It's incredible how perfect this song sounds. It's as long as it has to be, as slow as it needs to be, and its lyrics are just on point. I said on day 1 that Amy was at her best with slow songs; this is the real proof.

---
#Onto a winner

**akanewasright** (10): Short, but perfect.

**gannade** (10): Loving the vibe

**MrSwearword** (10): damn, she doesn't miss a note and sounds so clear.

**tapdancingpig** (10): I almost gave my 11 to this. It’s deceptively simple, but the pure sadness of lyrics and everything around it is just so effective. The strings make me lose it every time.

**vhqv1997** (10): Poetry.

**WhatAYagTwist** (10): this is the song that introduced me to amy SHOUTOUT TO TROYE SIVAN listen to his cover and the song he deditaced to amy's passing (June Haverly)

**mtachi** (9): We listened to this song in one of my English Literature classes and the pain just hits me right in the chest.

**nooodisaster** (9): Many songs on this album feel like timeless classics from the 50s just discovered in 2006, and none exemplifies that more than this song. This is a song that will always be timeless, and one I think will be covered decades from now.

**qetaz** (9): When I first heard this song years ago, I thought it was boring, but I was so wrong. It’s so smooth and pretty, but also so perfectly encapsulates how hopeless and just plain sad she was feeling.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Another slower song, the lyrics are nice too.

**A\_Zucchini** (8.3): Getting huge Burt Bacharach nods in this one, which I stan. Feeling some sort of way after sitting through this one, so it's gotta be doing something right.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I'm not a huge fan of this like some people are, but I can see why the lyrics of this song were used in a Cambridge University examination (I'm not joking, that actually happened). It's an example of excellent, heartbreaking songwriting, and it's amazing that such a simple song ended up being one of Amy's most well-known ones.

#Losing the game

**Albert\_Cole** (7.8): It's femme fatale-y and lush but eh

**twat\_brained** (7.6): If it's such a losing game why does every song tell me being in love will be the best thing ever?

**vayyiqra** (7): Not memorable.

One of the former rate winners in this rate, the winner of the Song of the Year rate falls at #9 this time. It got slightly less points this time around; had it matched its average in that rate, it would've placed at #6.

This is a song that only gained more impact in hindsight. It's not my favourite Amy song; I don't really think it represents the album well. However, it was well received even at the time, and won 3 Grammys in the 2006 ceremony. If you mention Amy Winehouse to anyone, this would be the song they think about. Whichever way you cut it, this is her signature song, for better or worse.

---

#We miss you, Amy.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): God, this song is so fucking iconic and with her death, it only gets even sadder in retrospect

**1998tweety** (10): This song is so groovy it's hard to not want to dance to it. The juxtaposition between the haunting lyrics and the carefree instrumentals really elevate this song to another level.

**gannade** (10): Doesn't really deserve to win this rate but a bop nonetheless.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love the sass and spunk that Amy has, but after what happened to her this song is kind of heartbreaking. The production on this song is super fun and I like be the jazzy feel of it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): we wish you’ve actually gone to rehab, Amy ☹️

**perfumevee** (10): Classic, I've heard it a million times but it still sounds good.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): it's sad

**static\_int\_husp** (10): There's so many things you could talk about with this song, but I think the horns deserve some of the biggest praise. They really make the song big and grand.

**twat\_brained** (10): It was a 10 in the SOTY rate, it's a 10 in this rate, it's a 10 no matter how you slice it.

**vhqv1997** (10): This song makes me feel really guilty whenever I find myself enjoying it because as much as I wish that Amy had never even taken drugs in the first place, songs like this would have never been written. Some of the best works of art are made by some of the most tortured artists, but given the choice, I would much rather they live a long and healthy life, free from all mental health issues and continuously cranking out amazing uplifting songs.

**A\_Zucchini** (9.5): Fun fact, Mark Ronson was part of the production on this fuego. The best part about this song in my (shitty) opinion is the breakdown before the chorus, I love that horn buildup. Coincidentally, I also enjoy a horn buildup in other parts of my life DM me lol

**Leixander** (9): i used to say this song was overrated but you know what, it grew on me this past month so much. this is supposed to be a "joyful" song but her voice breaking on the verses hurt me so much

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): The second previous rate winner isn't quite as earth-shattering as Rolling In The Deep, but it's nearly almost as good. While part of the allure people have towards this song is admittedly the dramatic irony, it's a deserved Song of the Year in itself; it has very memorable lyrics you wouldn't expect to hear in the mid-00s, and Amy's voice is perfect for the job.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): rip

**tapdancingpig** (8.8): This song is iconic, but it’s too long, too uncomfortable (considering what happened to her), too overplayed, and weaker than most of the tracks on this half of the album. It is a great opener, though, and establishes the tone for the album incredibly well.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): #JusticeForSmooth

**MrSwearword** (8): overplay factor aside, people act like this is Amy's best song. That simply isn't true, however, this is a good song.

**qetaz** (8): A bop, but with hindsight, one of the most heartbreaking songs ever. “I just need a friend”. How I wish you had one, Amy.

**vayyiqra** (8): Not trying to be edgy, but I feel like it will get a lot of high ratings partly because her drug addiction and death gives it a different subtext. It still bops though and I always like personal lyrics.

**WhatAYagTwist** (8): while i adore this album and amy in general, i really can't adore the message of this song. still a classic tho, that mark ronson production is iconic.

**akanewasright** (7.5): I wish this song wasn’t her breakout. First of all, it got REAL annoying/sad after she died. But half of the other songs on the album are some of the best songs of the past 20 years, don’t @ me, and this one, while still being GOOD, should have been edited a little more (a lot of the best tracks on the album deserve to be their exact length, but this one goes on just a little too long).

**nooodisaster** (6.5): It bops, but I never was attached to this song when there's so many stronger songs on Back to Black. Listening to it now, it's just sad and all the fun feels stripped away by Amy's tragic death.

#i'm

**mudkip1** (3): And you're a f*ggot, so you're not even allowed in a church. Mind your business.

Speaking of signature songs. If there was any song (besides maybe The Fear) that would tell you what Lily Allen is all about, this would be it. Irreverent, political, sarcastic, and without any shame or hesitation, she cusses out George Bush in this bop. My only hope is, just as with Thatcher's death and a Wizard of Oz song, this will shoot onto the charts when Trump leaves office.

---

#Bush quaking

**vayyiqra** (11): This could have become dated so badly but it still goes off. We stan a foul-mouthed songstress. I don't even like the song that much (although it bops) but it's so cathartic. Reactionaries are over.

**A\_Zucchini** (10): Cee Lo quaking rn

**akanewasright** (10): A fucking (heh) ANTHEM!

**awryj** (10): thanks lily i love you

**gannade** (10): iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is gonna be the winner or 2nd place, mark my words.

**Leixander** (10): her signature song, i love the censored version with strange voices even more tbh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i'm screaming the instrumental sounds like a children’s rhyme, and she managed to make it a hate track containing profanity

**MrSwearword** (10): taking a cue from Pink [and Eminem], Lily decides to make a diss track about George W. Bush. Aside from that, an entire track with Lily Allen cursing up a storm? YES PLEASE

**nooodisaster** (10): Ended Bush.

**NuneEtsuko** (10): The ultimate bop and Lily's signature song along with Smile IMO, I just cannot listen to it without singing along and raising both middle fingers while imitating all voices used in the track, such a fun song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Yes! I'm finally listening to this song after hearing about it for such a long time, and I'm living for her roasting of George Bush. It's just sad almost all of this applies even more to a lot of current political situations, but that only means the song remains relevant year after year, which is a rarity for political songs. Quite disappointing objectively, but at least that means it still bangs just as hard.

**PuggleMaster** (10): ended BUSH

**tapdancingpig** (10): Who doesn’t love this song? (Besides homophobes, racists, and George Bushes) I’ve been to more than one party featuring people singing along and flipping off the world to this song, and it may be the best thing in the world.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): fuck me

**twat\_brained** (10): Dear Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Theresa May, Nigel Farage, Piers Morgan, Tomi Lahren, Candace Owens, Brett Kavanaugh, Lil Pump, 6ix9ine, and literally anyone more than 50% right of center/anyone who has committed a violent crime, I would like offer a special heartfelt performance of this song dedicated to each and every one of you.

**vhqv1997** (10): Remember when all of us would send this song to our friends to annoy them?

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Lily ended homophobes and racists, we stan.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): Ended homophobia, ended racism, ended misogyny - but most importantly, ended sensible use of censorship for the word "fuck"

**qetaz** (9): I love how unapologetic Lily is, on the whole album but particularly on this song. There’s NO subtlety here, but this time that’s just what’s called for. Also that piano.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This song is just kinda fun

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): iconic tbh

**1998tweety** (7.5): I feel very conflicted with this song; I like how carefree the chorus sounds but I'm not a big fan of everything else.

Probably my second favourite Amy song overall. This song also got me a date/"it's complicated" status on Facebook, so thanks, Amy. I mean, you'd think it'd be a red flag seeing this on someone's Tinder profile, but I digress. 

The Dap-King Horns (yep, those same Dap-King Horns) deliver a stunning instrumental and Amy *owns* it. It's the track where her vocal style is most prominent, as well as her lyrical style. She tells a story with this track, and it's not an easy story, but it's heart-rending with the emotion that she delivers it with.

---
#You know this song is good

**WhatAYagTwist** (11): god fucking fuck why is this song so wonderful who gave this woman the right to be so good at making music im dying this is amazgonzignzingiad

**akanewasright** (10): I can’t name many other songs that are such a BOP, yet are so wrenching.

**didney-worl** (10): Timeless.

**gannade** (10): ugh. the final chorus SLAYS

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I think this is my favourite song from Amy.

**MrSwearword** (10): well crafted jams earn high scores. Enough said.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): "I cheated myself like I knew I would" is too real

**tapdancingpig** (10): I wish America let this song chart well. It’s a bop, but it’s also really sad and self aware.

**twat\_brained** (10): I know this song is really good, though. That's the difference

**vhqv1997** (10): It's so painful listening to this song and knowing how foreboding it is

**1998tweety** (9): A good follow up song. This sounds similar to “Papa's Got” but that's probably just be not being familiar with the genre and the music at the time period.

**Albert\_Cole** (9): I swear this samples something, but I can't seem to find what

**Leixander** (8.5): me to every friend of mine but in a different way

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I wasn't even aware this was released as a single, but now I find it to be quite the underrated track. The chorus is exactly something you'd expect to see in a classic soul record, but the rest of the song has jazzy elements to it that end up summing to something great to listen to.

**A\_Zucchini** (8.4): This shit is genius, but the baritone sax in the background takes the cake here. Provides so much meat underneath the rest of the track, love it.

**qetaz** (8): Great jazzy production, and what a voice. So rich and soulful. I love that she could be understated and knew that she didn’t always need to have big belts or runs to shine.

#No good

**nooodisaster** (7): Feels slightly like it's trying too hard to be commercial, but overall not bad.

**vayyiqra** (7): Edgy lyrics.

**awryj** (5): the bananies kinda jumped out but i guess she invented them so she gets a pass

I love this song so much. The lyrics are poetic (it's a cover, so it's not all her) and her vocals just add so much to it. A worthy 3rd place in this bonus rate.

The absolute pinnacle of covers. Adele and Darius Rucker stole Lady Antebellum's song right under their noses. The vocals, the harmonies, the emotion. A worthy second place, but the #1 is unstoppable.

---
**MrSwearword** (10): Luke Bryan is fucking terrible as a presenter. That aside, how dare she and Darius Rucker snatch Lady A's wigs with such blended harmonic savagery.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): this is almost on par with the original omg

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song is a PERFECT fit for her voice. She and Darius Rucker harmonize pretty well, too.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Honestly, if I didn't know this was an Adele cover, I would have thought it was the original song. It's that similar. Fortunately for her, it's a good song.

**vayyiqra** (7): Even though it might seem basic and I dislike country on the whole, I have lowkey always liked this song. It's just a well-written and relatable song and deserved to be a hit. This would be better with a studio recording but I think she did it justice.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): The original is way better, something seems off in this performance for me...

One of Amy Winehouse's most iconic songs, and it's a cover. It proves her distinctive voice, if anything. Does anyone know who sung the original? I doubt it. Everyone knows Amy did this. And she did THAT. By all means the deserving winner of all the bonus tracks. Despite Amy getting slaughtered in the early stages of the bonus rate, she pulled it out.

---
**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love this version of the song so much, Amy really makes it her own here.

**tapdancingpig** (10): Amy could cover a song like nobody’s business (see also: Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow), but this is by far her most iconic.

**MrSwearword** (8): the live vocals are fabulous. However, there is only one good version of Valerie and that's the Bruno Mars tribute to Amy performance.

**vayyiqra** (6): I feel almost nothing about this. It's pleasant, but I'm tired by now of literally everything being retro with her, and yes I know that is the whole point of Amy Winehouse. It's a very love it or hate thing, I guess.

And here's the second former rate winner, voted out just before top 5. This song did actually make it up to second place at one time, before being hit by a few low scores (I filtered out a few because I believed they were sabotaging; I believe the 2 0s to be genuine as far as I can verify). In the end, it didn't mark its second win, but mark my words, if there's an All Stars 2 rate, I will make sure this song gets in for its 5th time around the block.

I'm kinda shook Set Fire to the Rain placed higher than this.

---
#Could've had it AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLL

**gannade** (11): This has been in like 4 rates so far and I gave it my 11 to it each time, and I will do it again. It really is THAT bitch.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Such an iconic song. Everything about this song is so good; the vocals, the pounding drums, that build up to the chorus and how you just feel like belting the song out along with Adele. This has been one of my favorite songs for a long time, and it’s what made me love Adele.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): A powerhouse of a song to start off an album. Sets an icredibly high bar for the rest of the album, which it suprisingly meets.

**1998tweety** (10): This song is incredible, the chorus is explosive and I love how it has a third verse and then a bridge.

**akanewasright** (10): This was one of the first pop songs my parents let me listen to, and I think that may affect my score a little.

**ExtraEater** (10): i'm so used to receiving and now i get to give

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): im still mad at this song for beating out “Lights” in the Billboard 2012 Rate

**nooodisaster** (10): A rate winner, we stan. I remember watching the music video for the first time right before this song blew up and being so excited about this artist. Eight years later and it's still just as exciting. That anger, the thumping drums, that VOICE.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The Radar of r/popheads rates appears for a fourth time, and it's the first one on the ballot, at that. Despite the fact that it's impossible to go six months without giving it a score, the song still doesn't get old for me; part of what makes Adele enjoyable is that she shows actual emotion in her songs despite the heavy belting, and the anger in her vocals here display that perfectly.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): what a classic

**stardustanddinos** (10): Will be difficult to top this song honestly, for how instantly recognizable, catchy and well loved it is. Adele’s strength as a vocalist as well as a songwriter are showcased brilliantly here.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): wbk

**twat\_brained** (10): She may not have had it all with her ex, but she sure as hell has had it all with what, in all likelihood, is the song of the 2010s.

**vhqv1997** (10): I swear this song has shown up in 10 different r/popheads rates already and it still sounds amazing

**Albert\_Cole** (9.5): This is like the third time we've rated this song right? Well, it holds up. Better not win again though

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): I docked half a point because it was overplayed enough that I’m still a little sick of it, but honestly, if Adele didn’t break out like she did, this would probably be my 11. The track that made me fall in love with her.

**A\_Zucchini** (9): Great single, great opener, whoever did the percussion on this song deserves a pat on the mother-thiccin back cause that bitch is MEATY; Adele also showing off some great lyrical chops throughout this bop. Also: the bridge is a work of art bless the guitar thank you for coming to my TED talk. Points lost for the slightly out-of-place backing vocals

**mtachi** (9): This song still holds up so well, even after hearing it so many times. No wonder it was such a hit.

**NuneEtsuko** (9): This song was the shit when it was first released, a "bit" overplayed but otherwise, absolute gold.

**qetaz** (9): An iconic bop. What a great way to open the album.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): #2: ellie goulding - lights

**Leixander** (8.5): we could've had it AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL, okay seriously i love this song but she was way better ones in the album that deserve better

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): THE iconic Adele song, it’s certainly easy to see why this got Adele’s name in the public eye, but it’s also not one of her most powerful tracks in my opinion.

**awryj** (8): It's weird listening to this song and not seeing 2011 in your calendar. RitD is nothing short of an anthem and honestly Adele's best superhit song imo... Truth be told, it's really difficult to give this song a fair score after months and months of overplay

**vayyiqra** (8): This song makes me sad because it reminds me of my friend who first showed it to me and a year later we fought and never talked again, I miss you Julia :( but this is still a good song.

**WhatAYagTwist** (8): this song has been haunting me since i was a kid but it's still iconic as fuck so who cares

#In which Swearword talks about that show only he watched

**MrSwearword** (5): There are better Adele songs in existence and the GRAMMYs performance after the vocal surgery is the one good rendition of this. Bonus points for being used on The Switch 2 as a lipsync song in a Duelo de Imitacion.

A legendary use of a sample, great lyrics and a vocal delivery for the GODS all conspire to make this my favourite Amy tracks ever. Clocking in at just below the 9 average, it leads us into the top 5. It's one of Amy's more upbeat songs, but with her trademark dark lyrics. The demo of this song is on her postmortem album, but it's not nearly as good; whoever thought of the sample should get a Nobel prize.

---
**patronsaintofaspies** (11): The only song here that can unquestionably classified as upbeat is terrific, and it deserves the same level of praise that Rehab and Back to Black have, even if it hasn't quite gotten it by the general public. The lyrics may be a little more depressing than the melody lets in on, but it's still one of the best ones Amy ever wrote; an instant perfect score for me.

**vhqv1997** (11): This is the song that introduced me to Amy. No depressing metaphor, no mention of drugs and booze, barely any undeserved self-depreciation. This is what I want Amy to keep sounding like had there been more of her music.

**Leixander** (10): should be on top of every "uptempo but depressing lyrically" playlist on earth

**MrSwearword** (10): AMY WINEHOUSE'S BEST SONG AND YOU WILL ALL DEAL ACCORDINGLY

**qetaz** (10): “Should’ve been my own best friend”- the story of her life. It’s such a bop, and one of the very few Amy songs that doesn’t make me sad to listen to. I feel like she wrote this one when she really felt like it was all going to be okay.

**tapdancingpig** (10): One of the most upbeat moments on the album, but deceptively so. The lyrics are pretty dark, but you can still bop to Salaam Remi’s production (that Ain’t No Mountain High Enough sample... urgh his mind).

**twat\_brained** (10): Dua Lipa does a sensational cover of this, I'm surprised it wasn't in the Pop Girl Prophecy bonus rate. It's also really refreshing to hear Amy sing a bit of a chipper post-breakup song. At least, that's how it sounds.

**WhatAYagTwist** (10): the boppiest bop on this album, but it's still meaningful as fuck and just awesome god god

**ExtraEater** (9.5): m a r k r o n s o n

**Albert\_Cole** (9.3): I love it - it's a great use of sampling (although tbh it's still not quite as good as Ain't No Mountain)

**akanewasright** (9): THIS IS HOW YOU USE A SAMPLE, KIDS

**gannade** (9): Catchy

**1998tweety** (8.7): I love how this song builds up towards the end, Amy's vocals do a very good job at adding towards that build-up.

**A\_Zucchini** (8.7): What a title. This song bumps heavy in the whip, I can tell you from first hand experience. Amy delivering some hearty chops like a brain-dead butcher, can't get enough of this track.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): The songs a bit repetitive, but I still love the sound of it.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The interpolation adds to the sense that I've heard this song before, but it's still really excellent and an instant classic.

**vayyiqra** (8): This bops pretty hard. Wtf I love Amy Winehouse now.

It's a surprise that this song is the one that crosses the 9 average, since it's the only song in the top 9 to not get any 11s. However, you can't deny that it's a massive song, with a dramatic instrumental and some of Adele's best vocals (which is saying something!), which why its lowest score is just a 4. The third #1 of 21, and the most overlooked one, besides two cultural behemoths like Rolling in the Deep and Someone Like You, it's still incredible to see performed live, or even to listen to her studio version.

---
**1998tweety** (10): A contender for my 11, I remember discovering this song months before it got huge. I love the rock edge to this song.

**didney-worl** (10): It’s so melodramatic. I love it.

**Leixander** (10): i can be rain and adele can set me on fire anytime she wants

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): set my wig on fire Ms. Adkins

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Adele is angry again, and I'm one hundred percent here for it. I'm quite happy that this is slowly inching towards the status of Rolling in the Deep and Someone Like You, because it totally deserves it; conveniently placed near the middle of the album, it's a thrill to behold. The title gives it good imagery, too.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): "I set fire to the rain, watched it pour as I touched your face" is such an iconic line even though I'm not sure what it means

**stardustanddinos** (10): Understated but brilliant really.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): she could kill me to this song and i would be ok with it

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a great song, nobody @ me.

**A\_Zucchini** (9.5): :thinking: If rain puts out fire then how can it be set alight? :thinking: This shit bops that's all she wrote

**twat\_brained** (9.4): If not for the outro being at least a quatrain long, this would be a 10.

**Albert\_Cole** (9.1): Actually I don't understand these lyrics either, but it's a great song

**akanewasright** (9): I feel like this song is underrated. Well, as underrated as you get while hitting #1.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I love how over dramatic and grand this chorus is. Definitely understood why this was a hit. It may be a touch too dramatic though, but it still a great performance from her.

**qetaz** (9): Her voice shines, the production really works and gives the whole thing a huge epic feeling.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Lyrics are little wierd tbh. But Adele is a damn vocal powerhouse so I'm not sure how much that matters.

**tapdancingpig** (9): This is probably my least favorite of the singles, but it has a lot of momentum and tension, and Adele belts it all to hell and back.

**vhqv1997** (9): The logistics of igniting waterdrops are still lost on me but it's okay because I fully support Adele practicing witchcraft as revenge on her ex

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I really hated this song bc it was so commercial sounding... but this is catchy lmfao. https://i.imgur.com/Trpp1My.png

**ImADudeDuh** (8): kinda impossible but go off a bit

**MrSwearword** (8): her vocals get a challenge for the first time on this fucking album but live versions kind of make this look like nothing.

**gannade** (7.5): A catchy song but way overblown

**RandomHypnotica** (7): There are some really noticeable digital reverb artifacts in the chorus that really takes me out of the song

**WhatAYagTwist** (7): think i heard it in some ad in the past idk

**TragicKingdom1** (6): extremely overrated, this is one of my least favorite #1s by a main pop girl

**awryj** (4): this song makes me of a 38-year-old white American woman listening to this song in her Toyota Yaris while driving back home after discovering that her husband is having a romance with that bitch Karen from accounting

And here it is. She kept it up until the end, but Lily's last song goes out first of the 3. The Fear is everything Lily Allen is in one song. Critique of society, mixed with disillusion, mixed with irreverence, and a little bit of politics. It's both synthy, and with a soft acoustic opening that you can still somewhat hear through the verses. I couldn't have wished for a better contestant. And I'm going to draw attention to its scores for a second: This song got no scores lower than 6. In the vast majority of rates, a 9.222 would have won handily. Being up against two legends is what did Lily in, but did she put up a fight? Of course she did.

---
**awryj** (11): This song threw shade on everyone involved in show-business and made them cry themselves to sleep. The "The Sun and The Mirror" line is absolutely genius and I can't get over how quotable this song is: "I'm not a saint, but I'm not a sinner and everything's cool as long as I'm getting thinner", "It doesn't matter cause I'm packing plastic and that's what makes my life so fucking fantastic", "I'll take my clothes off and it will be shameless"... And the instrumentation? I'm in love with the ambienty guitar and the strings combined with that heavy electro claps. This song defines late 2000s-early 2010s pop. An easy 11.

**MrSwearword** (11): AMONG THE BEST SONGS IN THE HISTORY OF RECORDED MUSIC. Lily's vocal delivery, the lyrics, the fabulous music video and the overall sardonic as fuck but pop packaged goodness of it all...YAS GAWD, SLAY

**qetaz** (11): I was so blown away the first time I heard this. It’s just so unapologetic and lyrically brilliant. “I am a weapon of massive consumption/It’s not my fault, it’s how I’m programmed to function”. Great production as always and great expression in the vocals- “I heard people die while they’re trying to find them.”

**RandomHypnotica** (11): an absolutely iconic song, worthy of it's praise. From smart, snarky lyrics and catchy, light and bright instrumentation, this is an all-time classic of lily's

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): this is absolutely deserving of being said to be her best song, her songwriting was at its peak here and her execution nails it home

**akanewasright** (10): This damn well could be the peak of Lily’s social criticism.

**gannade** (10): Deserves to win. WOCC

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One thing I really like about Lily is her lyrics and how cutting they are. This song definitely a great take on consumption and celebrity culture, while being catchy.

**Leixander** (10): Lily sounds really cold and distant in this compared to other songs in the album and I kinda wish she did that for some of her other songs as well.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the first time I heard this in 2008, I was so shook.

**nooodisaster** (10): THIS IS EVERYTHING. The production was catchy, commercial, and still aged well. The lyrics are some of Lily's best, blending parody, satire, and (accidental?) self-reflection about celebrity culture. "I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds" = instant 10.

**tapdancingpig** (10): A great continuation of the tone from Alright, Still. This nearly snatched my 11. The satire of pop stars is incredibly sharp. Lily’s voice has never been her selling point, but no one else could deliver this song like she can.

**twat\_brained** (10): This is a really good song; I'm not sure why I didn't stick around for this Lily era after Alright Still.

**vhqv1997** (10): I haven't really listened to Lily before, only some of her more popular songs, but thanks to this I have come to realize that she basically invented Marina And The Diamonds

**A\_Zucchini** (9.9): Literally the only thing I can take away from this track is that the weird high-pitched synth in the chorus needs to be quieter. That's it the song hits that hard Y E E T

**1998tweety** (9.3): Two great songs in a row. Lily's vocals aren't a highlight but I really like the lyrics and the production.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ok good it isn't

**Albert\_Cole** (8.8): How come this didn't make The Fame?

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is the one song from the album that everybody seems to completely and utterly adore, and I admittedly don't get some of the hype-the chorus is a little bit forgettable to me. Still, the lyrics are great here-not too off-putting for me to give up on the song, but still tinged with the heavy sarcasm we all expect and love from Lily.

**vayyiqra** (8): I stan Greg Kurstin's production discography I don't even care that he's seen as -that- mom-pop producer. Everything that man touches is gold to me.

**WhatAYagTwist** (8): there are the synths again oh man

blue_heart_: # It's Not Me, It's You

I don't think anyone expected this album to stand up against the two giants it competed against, but I myself was surprised by how even it ended up being. 7.9 is a very respectable average, and only about .3 below the highest averaging album. I would've loved to see Lily Slumber Party her way to the top, but alas, it wasn't meant to be. 

---

**Overall average**: 7.897

---

**tapdancingpig**: The fact that this is the weakest album in the rate says a LOT about how amazing this set really is. (thank you u/blue_heart_!) There are a couple of tracks that don’t hold up well, or could have used another set of ears (Lily and Greg Kurstin were the only people involved in the creative process). But this also features some of Ms. Allen’s best work, both as a satirist and as a personal singer songwriter.

**TragicKingdom1**: This album was good but slightly forgettable. It was very by the numbers: you have your bops, your ballads and your filler. I think Sheezus and No Shame are much more interesting bodies of work overall but this isn't bad whatsoever. [Grade: B]

**MrSwearword**: A very well done album. Enough said.

**A\_Zucchini**: I can see why people think this album is a classic, but I guess there just wasn't enough for me to completely fall in love with this album like everybody else did. No shade though

**Leixander**: lily at her prime! her best album, other three can't get near it, also one of my most favorite albums of all time.

**ImADudeDuh**: Honestly, I was going into this album 100% expecting to hate all of it, but Lily is such a snappy performer, that her personality just always shines through every song, and if you want to listen to any album from this rate @ThePeopleWhoAreBoredSoTheyKeepUpWithTheRevealOfARateTheyDidn'tDo, PLEASE listen to this one.

**stardustanddinos**: This was the most pleasant surprise of all the three albums for me. With influences of hip hop, reggae and electropop combined with the wry British humour and pessimism of the lyrics, it was quite an enjoyable listen. I was surprised by how good the vocals are on this album. And as someone who is left-leaning, her “fuck the system” songs were very fun. Solid album! My only problem is that it gets quite monotonous after a while, and could’ve used 1 track less to make it feel less monotone.

**vayyiqra**: This album made me mad I've slept on Lily Allen all this time. It's really good?? I know Adele and Amy Winehouse's singles will dominate but Lily is the underdog here and I want her to win.

**mudkip1**: the weird part about this album is that it feels very mid 2000s but also parts of it feel very modern and almost timeless. lily has quite a childish style of production that i feel only works about 60% of the time.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: this rat made me realise this is my favourite Lily Allen record, and I think it’s her best. Her latest effort is too new for me to judge, but it’s a close second. This album’s lyricism was ahead of its time as well as Greg Kurstin’s production efforts. I wish Lily can work with him to produce more albums like this in the future as well as Lily recapturing this magnitude of success in her future endeavors.

**nooodisaster**: I have to stan this album because no one else will.

**ExtraEater**: very good title

**gannade**: This entire album sounds like a soundtrack to some 50s style, pastel-tinted dystopia, which is pretty cool.

Probably Adele's most well known song, but its value is its simplicity. A simple piano riff, and then it's just her voice. She lets it speak for itself, and speak it does. Adele captures emotion in her voice in a way very few other artists could. It brings her far enough to #2 with a good margin over The Fear, but it couldn't bring it all the way.

---
**1998tweety** (11): This song has everything I love about Adele. Emotional lyrics on top of suiting production, along with Adele's powerful vocals. I like that this song has a short instrumental outro, it suits the song well and fits well as the closer.

**ExtraEater** (11): i agree https://redd.it/48q255

**mudkip1** (11): i think this might be the best ballad ever created?? like not even exaggerating

**PuggleMaster** (11): One of the best song of all time

**twat\_brained** (11): This video literally ended Francois Truffaut all over again. I also really admire the long take! Also, am I weird for literally never having cried to this song? I think it's sweet; it's not exactly spiteful like Rolling in the Deep or cathartic like Set Fire to the Rain. It's a breath of fresh air from the rest of 21, and the fact that it's the album's conclusory song sends listeners on to something

**A\_Zucchini** (10): THE standout track. THE magnum opus. THE sad bop. What a fucking sendoff to an album jesus. The instrumentation is just there to complement Adele's vocals, which are just un-fucking-believable in this song. Fuck. Wow.

**didney-worl** (10): In my opinion, the memes show that Adele excels at quotable, aphoristic lyrics.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): That piano part will be always be remembered. This song also makes me yearn for the non-existent relationships that I’ve had.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When you were 14 and this song came on the radio and you looked out the window of your mom's car in the rain and had a single tear run down your cheek thinking about the man you never had

**letsallpoo** (10): Dalshabet outsold

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): im crying wine mom tears rn

**MrSwearword** (10): ADELE'S GREATEST SONG. The live rendition on Later Live with Jools Holland is superior, but this still slays [and considering this fucking album is a breath of fresh fucking air]

**nooodisaster** (10): When you realize Adele wrote, performed, and produced this song. The talent jumped OUT of this one.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Closing the perfect trifecta of hits on this album is Someone Like You, which has been appropriately labelled as one of the saddest songs of this decade. The lyrics may have been memed and the song may have been overplayed, but the original impact of it still hasn't been obscures-an excellent testimony to how great this song is.

**qetaz** (10): So stunning. I love that the instrumental is pared back to allow the emotion in her voice to shine. A perfect album closer. A perfect song.

**stardustanddinos** (10): Moving on is hard. Being the bigger person and not letting resentment build is harder. The conflict in this is difficult to bottle into a song but Adele somehow managed it. I can’t describe much more, but this is a phenomenal song, really.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): I hate to turn up out of the bluuue uninvited but III couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it, I uuh whatever neVERMIND I'LL FIIIND SOMEOooNE LIKE YOUuuu

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): So overblown, so overplayed, but so DESERVING of everything it got. This kind of make me think for a hot second that America’s charts can have nice things (I was wrong, of course, but those moments are nice).

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): :pensive:

**Albert\_Cole** (9.2): sobs

**akanewasright** (9): I docked a point for being overplayed, but yeah. This song deserves everything it got.

**Leixander** (9): i know i said this album is "screaming" comment in real life but i will reiterate it here

**vhqv1997** (9): I hate to say it but the overplay has definitely diminished the emotional impact of this song.

**NuneEtsuko** (8.9): There's a reason why this song was/is so popular and it's obvious when I hear it now again.

**vayyiqra** (8): Adele Laurie Blue Adkins ends our saga on a sappy excuse to show off her trademark belting-out vocals, and yet it's great.

**WhatAYagTwist** (7): my mom listened to this song so many times i have ptsd

**awryj** (2): I listen exclusively to underground genres, like soccermomwave or xfactorcore

**gannade** (2): OK so I know some people really adore this song but I find it soooooo boring. The lyrics are fine but they have been done way better by other artists, and the melody goes nowhere. It's a drag to get through and doesn't make me feel anything.

Is it too early to say that this is one of the most legendary albums of all time? It's been on the Billboard 200 since its release, certified diamond in 8 countries (some multiple times), spawned 3 number ones, two of which went on to become cultural staples. Hell, it's still on the Billboard 200 year-end. Adele became a superstar with this album, and now everybody knows her name. 

---

**Overall average**: 8.152

---

**tapdancingpig**: This album was one of the first ones that I actually enjoyed in its entirety. Before this, I bought albums and skipped half the tracks and thought that was normal. Adele taught me a little something about quality.

**TragicKingdom1**: I have always appreciated Adele's place in the pop world despite the negative "mom pop" label being applied to her. Her talent is undeniable and her authentic sound really stood out in an era of club bangers. But honestly, this album doesn't really live up to that promise; yes, Rolling In The Deep and Someone Like You are excellent, but otherwise the majority of the songs are kind of boring and mediocre. This isn't helped by all of those songs being in a row in the middle of the album. I understand the appeal but I think 25 is where Adele really came into her own. 21 still gets a good grade based on the strength of its highs, however. [Grade: B+]

**MrSwearword**: Someone Like You is great; yet this album's blandness is special in that this is LOWER THAN MY SCORE FOR ANTi & I detested that poorly produced barrel of noise.

**A\_Zucchini**: What did your dusty ass do for your sweet 21st? That's right general population shook from this masterpiece

**Leixander**: safe to say she deserves every inch of success she got, a great album with some low-key filler songs that still sound awesome thanks to her vocals and nice production

**stardustanddinos**: This album, without doubt, has the makings of a true classic. Strong, contemplative song writing, soul-infused instrumentals coupled with Adele’s bombastic vocals make for a killer combination. Channelling heartbreak and depression into potent universal anthems, Adele has earned the spot of this century’s most acclaimed as well as commercially successful performers and rightfully so. The highs in this album are incredible – to say that some of the songs here are among the crowning jewels of 21st century pop is no understatement. I don’t have detailed descriptions for many songs here – they’re just so good, and such classics that they don’t need an introduction. It’s amazing is all.

**vayyiqra**: Let's go, pop mom. No really, I don't get the Adele = music for soccer moms joke. I found millennials loved Adele when this came out, and I didn't myself, but I thought she was alright and appreciated that she was doing her own thing. I had only heard her singles for most of her career though and never thought to listen to an album of hers. I lowkey bopped to Rumour Has It though and one night a couple of years ago, I was in a cafe that always plays good music and they put on 21. I liked it then and it was good to revisit it even though Adele isn't my kind of pop. She is talented though and if the mood strikes me I'm sure I will play this again someday.

**mudkip1**: this album is my EVERYTHING my mom and i spent like two years exclusively listening to just this album and 19. i have such a vivid connection to so many of these songs

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: this was the first time I heard this album in full and wow i am certainly a wine mom now

**nooodisaster**: Almost certainly in the top 5 albums of this decade.

**patronsaintofaspies**: The rollout for this album was probably one of the first ever huge album eras that most of us here were aware of, and as common as it is for you to hear songs from it in your mom's office or in your school bookstore, it's wasn't such a bad introduction to music. I feared that this would be a collection of ballads that didn't live up to the hype, but a lot of songs here have genuine passion and energy in them, and the album as a whole is very enjoyable and perfect for things like studying or working or just crying your heart out to.

**twat\_brained**: Feels a lot slower than 25 and less well-rounded. I haven't heard 19 but I'm not sure how that compares either. In all honesty though I'm gonna bite and say Gaga deserved AOTY more.

And here we are, and in the end, it was never even close. This song did not leave #1 for a moment. In fact, in the earliest scores of the rate, it got so many 11s its average stayed higher than 10 until my 24th ballot. It had a solid chance at beating the record for highest rated song, if not for a low score that I added last-minute, but it's still a very, very impressive score to get. This song is a masterpiece. Amy's voice delivers its most heartbreaking performance (and that's saying something!) and her lyrics are immaculate. The pipe metaphor, which could've been weird in any other song, flows flawlessly. The beat carries the song somberly towards its conclusion: "He goes back to her... and I go back to black."

---
**A\_Zucchini** (11): yup

**akanewasright** (11): Perfection

**Leixander** (11): heartbreaking, it hurts me to watch the video so much

**mtachi** (11): This is hands down one of the best songs ever written.

**NuneEtsuko** (11): How can I give anything less than a perfect 11 to this absolute masterpiece.

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): Back to Black is a sonically stunning masterpiece. The soulful lyrics, tinged with the perfect mix of melancholy and bitterness, manage to be both personal to Amy yet also universally accessible. Her vocals -- rich with grit and gravitas -- combined with the velvety, vintage production, makes this undoubtedly her magnum opus and one of the most iconic songs of the decade.

**tapdancingpig** (11): For about a year and a half, I played this song over and over again. The intro is my ringtone. I listened to every version I could find. I was obsessed. Usually all this climaxes in me getting utterly sick of a song, but no. This song is perfect. The absolute gut punch of the lyrics, the mournful vocal performance, the catchy, girl group-like melody, the ritardando of bridge, it’s all perfect. The fact that Rehab is remembered more than this song is an actual fucking tragedy.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i remember my mom being obsessed with this song back in like 2008 and i've come to accept that nowadays i love most of those kinds of songs

**1998tweety** (10): This and Rehab were the only songs I heard before going into this album. Call it single bias but I believe both of those songs deserve 10s. The lyrics are the highlight of this songs, but the way her haunting vocals match the production is what makes the song so good.

**gannade** (10): UGH. Deserves to win this rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Me every fall and i can wear dark hoodies again

**nooodisaster** (10): THE DEFINITION OF A SNAP. The lyrics are biting and pull no punches, the production is dark, classy, and yet still insanely catchy, and the vocals are beyond. How am I supposed to decide which song to give my 11?

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): One of my favourite songs of the 00s in general, and it's only gotten better since I realised that it's really a girl group throwback by an iconic solo singer. True enough to its title, the song is pretty dark, but that only adds to the appeal its catchiness brings. It's a masterpiece and a modern soul classic, and I hope we'll even

**qetaz** (10): Everything shines: the dark, jazzy production, the lyrics, Amy’s iconic voice. A perfect mission statement for the album.

**twat\_brained** (10): I will never stop trying to get top 10 in the world at this on SingStar. And seeing the RIP frame at the end of the music video just jars me so much. Especially since Amy is but a black ashpile now.

**vhqv1997** (10): This is still the best Amy song that explores the themes of depression and break-up. It is her signature song and it grabbed the world's attention. Half of my favs wouldn't have even been given a record deal if Amy didn't pave the way for them first with this song and this album.

**WhatAYagTwist** (10): god god god god godggodogodogdogdogdogdogodgkdoskgodgksfdksdpkpoajocijzocjzoj

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song is a mood.

**awryj** (8): her best big song imo

**MrSwearword** (8): another case of video kind of outshining/outlasting the song. Essentially, Amy's "Bad Romance".

**vayyiqra** (8): The edginess is working for me now. This is epic.

blue_heart_: # Back to Black

---

This could well be my favourite album of all time. Along with two geniuses of production -- Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi -- Amy Winehouse put out a record that does everything right. It hits all the beats, it never falters (except maybe with its final track) and it provokes so much emotion. It made Amy a living legend; won her 5 Grammys in 2006, and put her name out there for the world. Maybe the saddest thing about it, and maybe the most beautiful, is how it seems to predict the end of her life as much as it reflected the feelings she had during the production of this album. This album is a classic in every sense of the word. I hope Amy rests in peace, knowing that she changed the world with her music.

**Overall average**: 8.235

**tapdancingpig**: This was the first album I streamed when I got Spotify (I was YEARS late to the Winehouse party), and I’m proud of my choices. This is the perfect marriage of voice, lyrics, and production. This is by far and away my favorite in the rate, and that says a LOT.

**TragicKingdom1**: This album is exactly what I expected it to be. Amy is a gem and shows both talent and charisma. I liked how it was a bit more variable than just big band stuff and soulful ballads. The only problem I had with this album is that none of the album cuts really blow me away: I can recognize their musical merit but I wasn't itching to repeat them. Overall this is a very good album though. [Grade: A-]

**MrSwearword**: A cohesive album with a sort of balanced mix of banging singles, vocal ability and great soundscapes. Slay.

**A\_Zucchini**: SLAPS in the whip. Bet. You ever cried snotty tears while driving? This bitch took me to that PLACE

**stardustanddinos**: This is a phenomenal album by any measure, but what makes it amazing is the mythos behind Amy Winehouse herself. Hassled by media, dealing with abusive relationships and problems with addiction, she was troubled, lonely and tired. These songs could’ve been sung by anyone; but Amy pours a life mired by pain and depression into every song – making it downright eerie and sad. She’s a brilliant songstress, with sultry vocals and an impeccable flair for good melody and it shows. I love the soul and RnB influences, which complement her vocals well. Truly a British modern classic.

**vayyiqra**: Back in black, I hit the sack, it's been too long I'm glad to be back. No really, I've never listened to Amy Winehouse before. At her peak, I was in high school and still had a rockist attitude, and was uninterested in newer music. Media discussion of her was dominated by her personal life and drug problems and in hindsight, I realize how fucked up it was how she was constantly attacked and portrayed as just messy and a bad person when she was seriously ill. I'm still not that into her retro thing, but I have gained an appreciation for her as a person and her talent. Rest in peace Amy.

**NuneEtsuko**: Can I just say this is literally perfection in an album? So beautiful and tragic, lyrics, melody and Amy's voice combined to create magic, my ears are blessed hearing this album. And Amy we miss you so much you and your gorgeous, irreplaceable voice

**mudkip1**: just kinda average imo i don't see the appeal

**nooodisaster**: Yeah I suppose this is my least favorite of the 3, but it's still a classic, isn't it?

**patronsaintofaspies**: I actually don't recall hearing about Amy Winehouse's death much in 2011, even though I recognised her name when I tried getting into music for the first time. Now that i've listened to Back to Black with full attention for the first time in my life I can truly understand why she's so mixed. This is a really great mix of soul and jazz, with emphasis on the former, and every song on here is full of richness and quality. Rest in peace.

**ExtraEater**: mark ronson

MrSwearword: *sees Hung Up at #7* **TRIGGERED**

JunkyGS: If it makes you feel better I think it will do super well at the Winners Rate. I know Creep is going to get a lot of sabotage votes, so I have very little faith in its performance :/

EDIT: Oooooo this song peaked at #7 on the Hot 100. That makes more sense. The song was the most successful dance song of the decade and sold like 9 million copies WW. I would rather take that then a Top 5 song that only sold a million copies :p
