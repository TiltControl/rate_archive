Hello and welcome to the first (but definitely not last) r/popheads [new wave rate](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/396894460128133130/992629937381060648/NewWaveGiants.png?width=670&height=670)!! (credit to the amazing u/whoisvalensi for the rate cover art!) 

I'm so excited to be hosting this alongside my cohost u/shipperondeck (aka Rina) and hope you all enjoy these albums, which are four of my favourites ever!

**But what is new wave music?**

New wave is a term that originated in the mid-to-late 70s to describe music coming out of punk scenes which had a distinctively pop bent to it, the most prominent of which was associated with the now legendary New York club CBGB where two of this rate's acts, Blondie and Talking Heads, were regular performers. Its music often draws inspiration from the light pop of the 60s while maintaining punk's countercultural posture and is also notable for its novel incorporation of synths into rock music. The name is a reference to the French New Wave movement in film because of its similar anti-corporate and experimental sentiments. The genre covers a wide range of styles as represented in this rate from rawer music that hews closer to the genre's origins in punk as written by the Go-Go's or the more straightforward rock by Blondie to the B-52's and their campy dance music to Talking Heads' dense art funk. Being a diverse genre, hopefully there's something here for everyone to enjoy so let's introduce the albums you'll be rating!

If you already know the drill because you're a regular rater, here are the important links for you but I'd still encourage you to read through the writeups of the albums, especially if you're unfamiliar with any of them.

# Blondie - Parallel Lines (1978)

Blondie are widely recognised as some of the first pioneers of new wave and one of the genre’s biggest names. Formed in New York in 1974 by frontwoman Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein, they became regular performers at CBGB.  They released a generally overlooked self-titled debut and the moderately successful Plastic Letters as a four piece with Clem Burke on drums and Jimmy Destri on keys. They then recruited two more members – guitarist Frank Infante and bassist Nigel Harrison – settling them with a stable lineup until their disbandment in 1982. On a tour through California in support of their second album, they met who would become the last important contributor to their third album, producer Mike Chapman. Harry was skeptical when their label proposed the band work with Chapman, claiming "they were New York. [He] was L.A." (to check their New York cred, try the chorus of Just Go Away) while Chapman later recalled thinking that “musically, Blondie were hopelessly horrible”. Luckily, after he was impressed by early versions of "Heart of Glass" and "Sunday Girl", both parties were convinced they could make a great album together. 

And they did, Parallel Lines trades in the punkier edge and "cartoonish postmodernist referencing" of their first two albums for strong pop hooks and polished performances coached out of them by Chapman, resulting in some of the most recognisable singles of the era including "One Way Or Another" and the aforementioned "Sunday Girl". They don't slack on the rest of the songs either from the insistent drive of "Will Anything Happen" to the spacious, noirish "Fade Away and Radiate" to their rollicking cover of Buddy Holly's "I'm Gonna Love You Too". But the crown jewel of the album is obviously the Giorgio Moroder inspired disco classic "Heart of Glass" which propelled them to mainstream stardom, at the cost of accusations of selling out from fans at the time. However the band always stood by the pop direction they took and the album has gone on to be called “the perfect pop-rock record”. It is one of new wave’s definitive albums, often considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time.

In 1976, Fred Schneider, Kate Pierson, Keith Strickland, and siblings Cindy and Ricky Wilson decided (over a shared fishbowl cocktail) to hold an impromptu jam session. This led to the formation of new wave band The B-52's. Their self titled album, The B-52's, was released in 1979 as their first studio record. The vibrant cover art by "Sue Ab Surd" (artist Tony Wright) shows off the band's thrift-store chic, beehive hairdos they named themselves after, and their camp aesthetic which set them apart from the start. The music itself combines Ricky Wilson's unique guitar tunings with stream-of-consciousness lyrics and often sing-shouty deliveries from Schneider, Pierson, and Cindy Wilson (with Strickland doing pretty much everything else). The record contains one cover, "Downtown," and generated danceable hits such as "Dance This Mess Around" and the unforgettable "Rock Lobster." The B-52s would find greater chart success in hits such as the "Love Shack" off the Nile Rodgers-assisted "Cosmic Thing," but their first record presented the band's out-of-this-world soundscape as instrumental to the new wave genre.

Notably, four of the five members of the B-52s identify as LGBTQ+: Schneider, Strickland, and Ricky Wilson (who tragically passed away from AIDS in 1985) as gay men, while Kate Pierson is now married to a woman. Although the band did not set out to write queer anthems, the band never hid their sexuality. "We were just trying to be ourselves," once said Strickland. "Being gay was just a part of it... Some people got it, some people didn’t, but we certainly never tried to hide it at all. Our music and our image kind of stood for itself—that was the statement—and we weren’t really self-aware enough to think that we needed to say anything else about it. We were saying it was OK to be different by just living it.” This joyful, celebratory tone found in their debut album helped The B-52s make a name for themselves in the post-punk scene. Overall, this album is an incredibly entertaining listen, which is exactly what the band was going for - and they want you to dance, too!

# Talking Heads - Remain In Light (1980)

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3AQgdwMNCiN7awXch5fAaG?si=rFAGi-ZURLKx9tDcab7tlQ) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/remain-in-light-deluxe-version/124922154) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m75gpT_AF7DHrMsvSMTHpd1prnYEIF8iE)

\- *Once in a Lifetime*

&nbsp;

Remain in Light is considered by many to be the magnum opus of the new wave alt rock art pop funk rock vomit on it eat it give birth to it band Talking Heads, comprised of bassist Tina Weymouth, bassist Chris Frantz, guitarist/keyboardist Jerry Harrison, and frontman David Byrne. The fourth studio album of the band's discography and the third and final to be produced by Brian Eno was the band's most experimental work yet. By taking influence from the Afrobeat music of Fela Kuti while implementing new technological advancements similar to modern looping and sampling, then combining that with Eno's production skills and Byrne's signature erraticism, created a truly unique record that is a cornerstone not only of the new wave genre, but of rock music in general.

When beginning development for their fourth album, the band aimed to prove that Talking Heads was not merely David Byrne and Friends. As a result, they essentially reversed the creative process they had been using for their previous albums: instead of writing music to accompany Byrne's lyrics, the band began with jam sessions before Byrne then wrote singing parts. This allowed Byrne to deal with his writer's block while providing Frantz and Weymouth more creative control (although friction between the couple and Byrne persisted throughout the creation of this album and subsequent ones). In this way, all listeners could see that every member of the band played a crucial part in Talking Heads. If any member of the band were removed or replaced, this musical masterpiece would not exist. And where would new wave have gone without it?

# The Go-Go's - Beauty and the Beat (1981)

Hailing from the LA punk scene of the late 70s, the Go-Go’s remain the only girl group with a #1 album to have written and played all the music themselves, which you are about to rate! They formed in 1978 with an initial lineup of Belinda Carlisle (vocals), Jane Wiedlin (guitar), Margot Olavarria (bass), and Elissa Bello (drums) without really knowing how to play their instruments and performed dissing Valley girls and Los Angeles Times music critic Robert Hilburn while [wearing cinched garbage bags](https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Belinda-Terry-bb14-go-go-fea-2016-billboard-1240.jpg). Classically trained pianist Charlotte Caffey was then recruited as “member who knew how to plug a guitar into an amplifier” covering lead guitarist and main songwriter duties. Bello and Olavarria were replaced by drummer Gina Schock, who imposed a proper work ethic on the band so they could meet the potential she had seen in them before joining, and Kathy Valentine, a guitarist who learned the bass in four days to join, completing the band as heard on their debut.

As an all-female rock band, they struggled to find a label, before settling on I.R.S., a small label that was home to the Buzzcocks. Through their label they were matched with Richard Gottehrer, the producer of Blondie’s first two albums, who helped refine the girls’ raucous takes on teenage heartbreak and fatalism into a series of irresistible bangers. While they had punk roots, when it came to writing songs the band had strong pop sensibilities, inspired by 60s American girl groups and beach boys and 70s British rock which positioned them perfectly to ride the cresting New Wave to stardom. When they heard the finished record, the band claims they cried for fear they would be disrespected for selling out and making a pop album but were soon able to dry their eyes on the piles of money it made them as it rose up the charts, holding #1 for six weeks in the spring of 1982. Over the years, the album has been credited as pioneering the pop punk genre as well as inspiring women in rock music from the Bangles to Hole to Bikini Kill to Sleater-Kinney ([RATE]??).
