**bulforster** (8): The first to fall of what I would consider the most iconic Parallel Lines singles (along with One Way or Another and Heart of Glass), the songs that are so everpresent and enduring that you’ve (or at least I had) heard them without even realising they were all from this one album. This is definitely my least favourite of the three, I don’t revisit it that often because it’s so sugary but when I do listen I’m reminded it does still have a bit of an edge. This song actually had the longest climb to day 3 but it’s such a classic it should have been obvious it would make it.

**shipperondeck** (7.8): Sad song I hope no participants can relate to something like this :pensive:

---

**thedoctordances1940** (11): I just love this song, part of it is definitely just that I grew up listening to this a lot but it's just so good idk

**AHSWeeknd** (10): omg I know her

**babadork** (10): After much consideration, I think this is the best version of Sunday Girl and not ones with French.

**bbfan132** (10): i love how sugary this is!! one of my favorites

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (10): this is like top 10 song of all time

**freav** (10): one of those melodies that are so good that they feel like they shouldn't be legal

**homestarguy** (10): A song written about a cat deserves to be this sweet and sublime.

**MrSwearword** (10): the soda jerk or fifties doo-wop adjacent meets teen beach movie tackiness of the song makes me love it.

**plastichaxan** (10): this surprised me greatly and i listened on a sunday like whoa

**qazz23** (10): really catchy and great melody

**vayyiqra** (10): "Written for Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry’s runaway cat, Sunday Man" wait I did not know this lore. I hope the cat was okay : (

**duracell93** (9.9): this song is just delightful! Love the version with the French verse too!

**camerinian** (9): why does this sound like it would slot perfectly into the indieheads bubblegrunge rate that’s also happening right now

**daretheghost** (9): French version outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is awakening my latent theatre kid genes

**Stryxen** (9): it’s tuesday rn… :/

**pig-serpent** (8.5): I love this song when it’s on then when it’s about to come on my playlist I always skip it.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): if this is anywhere but Day 3 this title will be very unfortunate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is so pleasant. It’s almost too pleasant…but not quite.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): a thing about me is i LOVE a song i can clap along to

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Kind of biting Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex’s flow so yes I do like it

**ImADudeDuh** (8): imagine your cat running away so you write a song about a church girl getting cheated on to cope

**MassiveThief** (8): hand claps good for the soul

**seanderlust** (8): queerbaiting myself by interpreting these lyrics as debbie pining for sunday girl despite that not being at all the point of the song

**whoisValensi** (8): I want a Sunday Girl who go to ... This song is about a cat that ran away???????? What in the fuck.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): on Sundays we go to Church and sing hymns such as Into You

**starla\_** (7.5): a cute bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this is so cute sounding it almost makes me forget its about cheating

**frogaranaman** (7): I'm more of a Wednesday girl myself

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s cute I guess

**1998tweety** (6.5): the horse's name was Friday

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): stream Church Girl by Beyoncé instead!

**DaHumanTorch** (6): drop it like a thotty drop it like a thotty sunday girls actin loose bad girls actin snotty

**flavasavavandal** (6): I don’t think Debbie Harry has the sweetness in her voice to pull this off

**NewWaneLietoc** (5): don't believe in 'em

**fadedblue09** (4): A bit too saccharine-sounding, and some vocals teeter on annoying

**bulforster** (10): My favourite song on the album, I really like the interplay between the guitars but my love is mostly based off of the strength of that fantastic chorus which is probably the moment where the Go-Go’s let loose the most on the record. I was really happy to see this song maintain day 3 the whole rate, unfortunately just dropping out of the top 10 with the last few ballots. With so many classic songs above it however, I can’t be too mad at this placement for a deep cut.

**shipperondeck** (8): There are better songs on this album imo but I predict top 10! Let's see how you all do!

---

**nt96** (11): Was gonna 11 Once in a Lifetime but The Go Gos put their entire puss puss onto to the mic and went WAYYYYY too hard for me to ignore. Bless.

**2dina3dworld** (10): if I was alive in the 80s I would be blasting this in my boyfriends car while we drive down the highway with the windows down

**AHSWeeknd** (10): queens of spelling tonight the quirky way

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We got a bop buffet on our hands with this album.

**fadedblue09** (10): The vocals here were a serve. The album standout for me

**flavasavavandal** (10): move aside Doja, Belinda and her Beats are the new queens of the streets

**MrSwearword** (10): another instance of correctness being brought

**plastichaxan** (10): before the rate is over and this album is robbed… anybody wants to rule the streets tonight? sounds very slay to me

**qazz23** (10): good deep cut, love the bassline and backing vocals

**welcome2thejam** (10): What a chorus hook, don't have much to say outside of this song rocks. Think it's my favorite on the record.

**NewWaneLietoc** (9.4): so true besties

**pahc** (9): proto girls aloud lmao

**starla\_** (9): Toniiiiiiiiiight

**vayyiqra** (9): I like how many songs in this rate are about normal things like going downtown for a night out, and then also there are songs about a lobster, Debbie Harry's cat, and David Byrne talking about his shoes.

**bbfan132** (8.5): i love belinda’s voice

**duracell93** (8.5): Like the darker feel! Fitting for a song called tonite lol

**homestarguy** (8.5): Tasteful use of some “ohhhs” on this one. Another bop!

**1998tweety** (8): we are young

**Stryxen** (8): this is very cool, not particularly outstanding on the album but a good punk singalong

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): oh i remember this one! i had to learn how to play it for a school of rock course i took one summer, good times

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKXWj1Pe8Fk

**CrimsonROSET** (7): that’s not how you spell that word

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The repeating “Tonite”s in the verses get annoying but the chorus is pretty satisfying

**whoisValensi** (7): I think I just realized that The Bangles and The Go-Go's share the same space in my mind despite them being a bit different... whoops.

**bulforster** (9): I really like the choice to pick up the pace after Our Lips Are Sealed, keeping really strong momentum through the opening run of the album. This was consistently early day 3 for the whole rate, but just like Tonite hit a bit of a ceiling due to being a B-side competing with some truly classic singles.

**shipperondeck** (9): Drive down a not very crowded highway in the summer to this song! Very effective for the vibes!

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): queer coded

**2dina3dworld** (10): I could take a lot more of this album if it kept this up (spoiler alert: it nearly does)

**camerinian** (10): I finally appreciate how influential The Go-Gos were in the early 2000's rom com trailer core genre

**flavasavavandal** (10): how much more of this ridiculously catchy guitar playing can i take before i go crazy

**MrSwearword** (10): I am impressed at how frenetic yet polished this track is, you better werk Go-Go's.

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): perfect drum sound, especially in the lil' pre-chorus.

**nt96** (10): idk but yall ate this up enough, leave some for the rest of the New Wave Girlies

**welcome2thejam** (10): The Go Gos went back in time, developed a great 60s girl group tune, then came back and power pop'd it up for that extra oomph

**homestarguy** (9.5): Another absolute delight. I’m a sucker for a good 3-minute jangle pop bop!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Me when I’m listening to the Overload by the Talking Heads.

**frogaranaman** (9): just a bit more

**MassiveThief** (9): vocal harmonies have me screaming without the s

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): This is what Teen Beach Movie would sound like in the 80s

**DirtyRat583** (8.9): 🕺🕺🕺🕺

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is super cute - i saw someone mention alvvays as possibly being inspired by them and i can kind of hear it here

**starla\_** (8.5): This is like a Beach Boys throwback, so good

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): me doing a 100 song long rate

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I wonder what unit of measurement they’d use to determine how much more

**fadedblue09** (8): I like the touches of surf rock here

**pig-serpent** (8): This song reminds me of the Primatives’ album Lovely, which I don’t see talked about much. If you like this song it’s well worth checking out.

**qazz23** (8): decently catchy

**vayyiqra** (8): I like how guitar go strum on this album

**CrimsonROSET** (7): we love edging

**Stryxen** (7): red dress woman dance emoji !!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): cute deepcut

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): go crazy oh yeah crazy oh yeah crazy oh yeah crazy oh yeah cra

**whoisValensi** (7): I don't think I can take much more honestly but if you can Go-Go's, more power to ya.

**seanderlust** (6): i'll be honest, so far i'm not really digging their lyrics

**shipperondeck** (10): This song is so... girlboss-y and relatable omg

**bulforster** (8): I’m a bit surprised this is the highest placing Go-Go’s deep cut, especially as the only day 3 song with no 11s so cracking the top ten is no mean feat. Still, I can definitely see the appeal of the dramatic intro along with the slightly darker tone of the song in contrast to the songs that precede it and it doesn’t let up with the momentum of the album (which This Town arguably does a bit as the next track). All that’s left to see now is how much further this album’s two singles can push.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): how do you manage to have such an effortless yet brilliant vocal delivery

**akanewasright** (10): shout out to that one lyric video for being impressively horrible

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That dussy got her going crazy!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh hell yes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): when the drums kick in I suddenly have a new lease on life

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is the fun i was expecting more of this rate

**MrSwearword** (10): OK werk. I haven't been snatched this hard four times in a row. Also the guitar work had me think of "Lovers in the Parking Lot" which is a form of high praise.

**plastichaxan** (10): maybe i am high but god i’ve been thinking so much about the way i view lust and love as concepts and like wow i feel seen

**welcome2thejam** (10): Those harmonies! Those drums! That swagger and attitude!

**whoisValensi** (10): Oh I think this may be one of my favorite tracks in the rate even if this is my first time hearing it.

**bbfan132** (9.5): better than lana and iggy pop

**daretheghost** (9.5): I dig moody Go-Gos.

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): just love the electric guitar giving the song enough grit, but not being overbearing, beautiful balance

**seanderlust** (9.5): "wake up babe, new plot trope dropped!" i say to my boyfriend, before he tells me that that's just how dating usually works and to go back to bed.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): mom's spaghetti

**NewWaneLietoc** (9.4): rock on!

**duracell93** (9): Love the reverby drums, darker, and more sparse atmosphere!

**homestarguy** (9): Lust?? I’m a good Catholic boy, I don’t dare partake in such sins!

**own-photograph-4642** (9): Really great song with a equally great chorus

**1998tweety** (8.5): ENDED lana

**frogaranaman** (8): why do so many artists use this album as song title inspiration

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Meanders a bit in the middle but is very strong

**qazz23** (8): the vocals/harmonies carry this one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this song has such a killer opening i wish the rest of the song lived up to its potential

**vayyiqra** (7): I want to like this more because the backing vocals are nice but the guitar is kind of bland idk

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I wish this were hornier

**starla\_** (5.5): decent

**fadedblue09** (5): Sounds really soulless and generic

**pig-serpent** (4): I like that they’re attempting a darker atmosphere but the chorus is fairly boring.

**bulforster** (10): I’ve been talking up the opening run of Beauty and the Beat but Remain in Light’s side A beats it out, building from the skeletal opener to the driving Crosseyed and Painless before ending with this deservedly triumphant song. It’s the longest on the album but you barely notice with how much is going on from the grooving polyrhythms to the stellar backing vocalists’ chants to the awesomely warped guitar solo to end. About halfway through the rate, this song kind of swapped places with Crosseyed and Painless and I’m glad we still got day 3 representation for the groovy side A cuts.

**shipperondeck** (9.2): This song is right. The world moves on a woman's hips.

---

**camerinian** (11): very few songs make me want to throw my whole fucking body into a dance, but this flawless track with its perfect rhythm section, its relentlessly exciting pace, the percussive nature of David Byrne’s voice through much of the track, and the way it just always keeps you on your toes and never once gets dull in its six and a half minutes makes me want to thrash around like I’m purging a demon. The hooks that are here are an excellent garnish to the impeccable energy, the song just keeps developing new ideas but never loses sight of its core appeal, and by the end of the song when it’s just throwing like a dozen melodies at you, you’d think it would be too busy and overblown, but all of them are so developed and thought out that throwing them all into the soup at once is just an auditory feast. I feel like this gets overshadowed a bit in the conversation around the album, and that saddens me because it’s one of the most thrilling songs I’ve had the pleasure of listening to

**2dina3dworld** (10): the choir in the background is what makes this song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): i have no idea what this song means but i don't care because it's a massive bop

**bbfan132** (10): :puggofastx100:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The real great curve is the quality of this album going down after Once in a Lifetime.

**daretheghost** (10): banger

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): a HUGE leap in terms of a song that interests me.

**frogaranaman** (10): why don't you say so? didn't even notice,

**homestarguy** (10): Like the world, this song DOES swivel and bop!! Adrian Belew is an absolute guitar god. The intertwining vocal lines on this are otherworldly.

**MassiveThief** (10): what an EPIC. the lead up to the "world of light" part is so cool, and all the different voices going at once is masterfully put together

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): where is the 1 hr club miX? where is the slowed and reverb'd mix? I NEED IT FOR DAYS BAYBEE YOU DONT UDNERSTADN I DANCED TO THIS WHEILE DRUNK IN A SWEATY GARAGE ITS FUCKING ACE. LES GO FOR HOURS

**nt96** (10): omg is this drum and bass

**own-photograph-4642** (10): The world moves on a women's hips! The world moves and it swivels and hops!

**qazz23** (10): the harmonies and solos are very good, this is one of their best songs

**RandomHypnotica** (10): slut anthem???

**vayyiqra** (10): I like the fast guitar strumming on this album it rules and shows their funk influences well. Also note how Talking Heads have male backing vocals that are good @ Blondie

**welcome2thejam** (10): Getting up and moving to this right now. Builds and builds so perfectly and ends on a ripper of a guitar solo

**whoisValensi** (10): The live version of this from the American Utopia Live on Broadway Recordings is a fucking treasure to me (as is that entire thing, in both audio and visual forms too).

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9.9): what

**1998tweety** (9): when my prof curves my 27% up to a 51%

**akanewasright** (9): there are like 5 jokes I could make but I hate them all so I will leave you too imagine them

**bigbigbee** (9): I bet this RIPS live (2)

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is noise soup, but like, in a good way. Like a thick soup, like a stew really. Like a nice gumbo. Jambalayaaaaaaaaaaaa

**sarcasticsobs** (9): BONGOS! The sucker for good percussion has logged on (me)

**celladonn** (8.5): The rhythms and harmonies here are so good

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): anti-flat earther anthem

**seanderlust** (8.4): the polyrhythms!!! girl i have to lie down

**AHSWeeknd** (8): the only Say So I claim

**MrSwearword** (8): production wise, I have faith in this album. Lyrically...well...

**slimboyfriend** (8): David Byrne’s way of singing about sex or feminist enlightment or maybe both

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this song makes me wanna surf into the ocean never to be seen again

bulforster: **Roxieloxie** (7): im kinda not enjoying that all of these songs are like 8 minutes long but my ass is shaking nevertheless so

**starla\_** (7): this is like what B52s were trying to do on some of their songs

**thedoctordances1940** (7): like there's a lot going on that's clearly musically interesting but i'm just not really vibing with it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Okay, this is what I’m not getting about this album. The vague hard-to-hear lyrics layered under the complicated instruments make me think a song is one way, and then I look at the Genius page and no, it’s totally different. I thought “The Great Curve” was some sort of nerdy description of I don’t know, the passage of time? The Earth? But no. It’s about badonkadonks.

**DirtyRat583** (6.3): the instrumental of this is very galloping. i kinda wish i was a horse so i could listen to this and be like "omg me"

**CrimsonROSET** (6): maybe this is about sharks

**Stryxen** (5.5): okay i was originally going to 0 but it clicked for me a little, if this had any chance of winning i would still 0 it tho

**fadedblue09** (5): This is tiring

**pig-serpent** (2): The third song in a row that’s a chaotically funky and upbeat post punk groove played for way too long, and with all 3 songs in a row this makes up the first 17 minutes of the album and by the time this song is over I kind of want to enter a drug induced coma.

**shipperondeck** (10): If it weren't for a certain funny song in this album, I'd think this is a rate winner contender...

**bulforster** (9.5): And there goes the last song on side A. Bleeps and bloops for days but what I love most about this song is how theatrical David’s delivery is from “TAKE A LOOK AT THESE HANDS” to “I’M NOT A BURNING BUILDING”, honestly just as quotable as Once in a Lifetime. A deserving winner of the title of highest placing deep cut.

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): and it goes on and on and on and on… STREETLIGHTS, PEOPLE!!

**akanewasright** (10): “TAKE A LOOK AT THIS HANDS” me when I’m about to punch a man idk

**homestarguy** (10): Rejected D*n*ld Tr*mp campaign song.

**MrSwearword** (10): now this is an opener but I'm worried that this album is going to be really dense and not my speed from here on out. Still, I can dig crazy done right.

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): I like when I can hear sounds from the future and the sound of a dial up modem from 2002 fucken rules.

**qazz23** (10): super funky and nice bassline, love that glitchy solo too

**vayyiqra** (10): I am also neurotic and am too thin so I feel seen right now. (Not a government man though surely not :detective:)

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh, you don't like this song? Well take a look at these hands 👊 👊

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i just love when music is so unapologetically weird like this

**Stryxen** (7.5): did you know they’re spelling yass in morse code

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Starts off with a bang (well, an “AAAHHH!”) but is a touch too long

**plastichaxan** (7): it’s nice but the song really goes on too…

**DirtyRat583** (6.4): sounds like a funk song gone terribly wrong

**CrimsonROSET** (6): … ok!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): woops yeah I don’t connect with this at all really. It’s tight and very driving but nothing here grabs me.

**fadedblue09** (6): On second listen, I appreciate the unconventional instrumentation but it's not something I'd revisit often

**pig-serpent** (5): This type of funky post punk beat is fun for a few minutes but this is a six minute song with very little variation and after four minutes I’m ready to skip to the next song.

**ImADudeDuh** (4.5): i got it

**shipperondeck** (9.8): I used to not like this song for some strange reason but it's so good actually!

**bulforster** (9.5): A cover that Blondie completely make their own. The variation in Debbie’s desperate delivery even across this short runtime is great and it has a fantastic climax. Even though this is a classic Blondie single, it’s definitely a tier below the songs left and you can definitely see it hit a ceiling in the rank graph.

---

**babadork** (11): I knew that a Blondie song was going to end up getting my 11, and this ended up being my final choice. The great Debbie Harry vocal performance with hints of punk and nods to 60s pop, the gimmick of the ringing phone, and the classic power pop drums make this one of my favorite Blondie songs.

**DirtyRat583** (11): SEXY PEOPLE GIVE THIS PERFECT SONG AN 11

**RandomHypnotica** (11): me to gaga after leaving us on a cliffhanger for 12 years

**AHSWeeknd** (10): One hell of an opener, also Debbie Harry’s voice here is insane

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): gotta say this song grew on me quite a bit, at first I wasn't super impressed by it but that hook is just too strong

**bbfan132** (10): i love how frenetic this song is energy-wise

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yassified on hold music.

**camerinian** (10): OK I’d never heard the full album before this rate, only the big singles, so when I say this hook has been lodged in my brain for most of the submission cycle please know that’s a huge compliment and a hell of a way to draw you in.

**daretheghost** (10): I’m always surprised when I remember this is a cover because it sounds like SUCH a Blondie song lyrically.

**flavasavavandal** (10): Zara didn’t sound this down bad last month

**pig-serpent** (10): Classic Blondie single that should be better remembered than it is.

**vayyiqra** (10): Can't find it but I saw this tweet that said "crying to Blondie's cover of Hanging on the Telephone" and lol

**welcome2thejam** (10): Starts off with an absolute smasha of a cover. Great drums, blistering pace, it just rips

**celladonn** (9.5): what a banger

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): when you're in a Discord call and everyone deafens themselves

**1998tweety** (9): me @ Telephone pt. 2

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Really like this one, the growl in Debbie Harry’s voice is to die for.

**homestarguy** (9): Rob Thomas stole this guitar hook for “Real World.”

**skargardin** (9): me whenever my friends take longer than 5 minutes to answer my texts

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): thinking about living in the generation where if you wanted to know where your bf was, you just had to call him or who you thought he was with and just hoped someone would answer. If they went anywhere without a phone, you just had to wait.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): Riffs

**CrimsonROSET** (8): diddle the dial

**fadedblue09** (8): Feels like it would play in the intro of an 80s romcom

**jsonphile** (8): a solid album opener

**MrSwearword** (8): a cute way to open the album

**NewWaneLietoc** (8): fine

**plastichaxan** (8): i was gonna make a joke about hanging up on someone but realized it says hanging on and i-

**qazz23** (8): catchy and good guitar work throughout, didn't know it was a cover at first

**TiltControls** (8): A fun way to start the album

**starla\_** (7.5): this is one of those songs that I always think is a cover of a Motown song but isn't

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I don’t love her voice on this song but boppy i guess

**own-photograph-4642** (7): Like the part where Debbie sings "I can't control myself!"

**Stryxen** (7): bop! Maybe too short but very catchy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): artists will be like “yeah this is the best song we’ve ever created. make it 2 minutes long”

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Aww yeah rock n’ roll 😎

**whoisValensi** (7): Not the best opener I've heard nor the worst, but certainly does set the tone for the album.

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): so i run to you clown noises

**frogaranaman** (6): girl I've been on a plane, I have nothing else to DO but hang on The phone

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): don’t call me I’ll call you

**shipperondeck** (9): Glittery song, what's not to love here?

**bulforster** (8.5): And here the Go-Go’s lose their debut single and album opener, which is a bit more of a lowkey cut compared to the rest of the album. For a long time this was actually the highest ranking Go-Go’s song, making it as far as #3 without any 11s for much of the rate. Eventually though, it couldn’t stand up to the more upbeat songs to come.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don’t know what it is about that bridge but it’s so mesmerizing

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): 🤐🤐🤐

**bbfan132** (10): i feel like this is a classic but their music also seems kind of underrated? i hope this does well in the rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): More like my ears are healed after listening to The Overload.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): almost as good as the Mary Kate & Ashley movie with the same name

**frogaranaman** (10): me regarding [REDACTED]

**homestarguy** (10): My word, what an opening track to a discography. Well-crafted, sweetly performed, an absolute delight.

**MrSwearword** (10): an underrated classique

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): im swoonin

**plastichaxan** (10): i love it it gives me that buzz

**qazz23** (10): one of the best pop songs - it's fun, catchy, and has a really strong melody

**slimboyfriend** (10): makes me feel like a girly girl with a secret!

**TiltControls** (10): The midsection point is heavenly

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is inextricably linked to a memory of being about 15 and my brother was in the kitchen singing it and given his music taste is normally The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, it was the funniest shit I've ever seen. He's a funny guy! dudes rock. Good song and one of the catchiest hooks ever

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The amount of times I heard this on the radio and it never got old

**welcome2thejam** (10): That bridge is the special sauce, perfect switch-up before it explodes back to life

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): 🤐🤐🤐

**seanderlust** (9.5): shoutout to when ally mcbeal was on TV and i would hear this song on the radio and sing "ally mcbeal!" instead of the title. peak comedy from like 6 year old me i've literally gotten less funny over time from that

**camerinian** (9): this has clearly aged not the best in the production but God damn the resolution on the chorus is all-time legendary

**celladonn** (9): One of those bops that I recognised immediately but never before knew the artist or name of the song

**flavasavavandal** (9): I just love propulsive little sweet jams that bop

**jsonphile** (9): I swear if I see some comments about “Duff sisters outsold”-

**own-photograph-4642** (9): Can't help but think of Life Without Buildings' Juno.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I apparently know this song, but did not know beforehand that I knew it

**Stryxen** (9): time to DANCE <3

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the original gaslight gatekeep girlboss anthem

**daretheghost** (8.5): ‘scute

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): When I was a kid I thought that this song was called “Alice Cecile” and I was like who tf is she

**starla\_** (8.5): Alex the seal

**2dina3dworld** (8): too bad we’re not rating Fear of Music because then I could draw parallels between the title of this song and the “my lips are sealed” line from Life of Wartime

**CrimsonROSET** (8): finally some fucking fun in new wave

**fadedblue09** (8): Rate hosts when they see the results clash with the echo chamber's expectations

**whoisValensi** (8): You can tell I'm a 00s kid because for some reason my brain always jumps to the Duff sisters' version of this first before the original version.

**duracell93** (7.6): Classic!

**1998tweety** (7.5): me when I see someone shoplift

**ImADudeDuh** (7): overrated a bit tbh

**bulforster** (10): And the Go-Go’s are the first to bow out of the rate, but what a song to do it with! All the songs from here on out never left the top ten and it’s easy to see why. Right from the opening drums this song hits like a truck, the group chorus is defiant and fun in all the right ways. The Go-Go’s might be the first to leave us but they arguably put in the strongest showing this rate and I’m so glad I added them to the lineup so I could see how much you all enjoyed this trailblazing album and band!

**shipperondeck** (9.2): Timeless bop only outdone by miss radio rebel herself

---

**1998tweety** (11): i mean come on now, what a BOP. Not surprised to see myself giving the poppiest boppiest song in the rate my 11

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): I’m glad someone has the beat because my uncoordinated ass certainly does not. But I’m gonna dance to this anyway and the world is gonna suffer.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): one of the most iconic drum openers ever. Peak bright and catchy music

**Stryxen** (11): i’m obsessed (read: I realised i already knew this from glee)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a classic

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): i love the growl in belinda's voice when she sings "JUMPIIIIIIIIIIN", it's the cherry on top of this power pop masterpiece

**bbfan132** (10): another classic

**cremeebrulee** (10): what's more embarassing than knowing this from glee?? maybe knowing it from jimmy neutron 😭

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i mean they do what can i say

**fadedblue09** (10): Definitely memorable, probably has one of the most well-produced instrumentals in the rate

**frogaranaman** (10): me in the kitchen when the chef asks what my friend and I have

**homestarguy** (10): More like “We Won’t Get Beat” because this song is going to win this rate, and rightly so.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): it’s a good thing they have it, cause *slightly louder so The B-52s can hear* Some People did NOT have the beat.

**MrSwearword** (10): NOW we're back to being snatched in a ruthlessly efficient soundtrack pop piece of gold.

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): I love meta-ditties about songwriting and entering trance states. this song is about the POLITICS of writing good slappers. crucial.

**nt96** (10): See you at top 5 luv

**plastichaxan** (10): classic

**Roxieloxie** (10): slay

**sarcasticsobs** (10): god damn

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): but does POPHEADS got the beat? we shall find out when the reveal comes

**vayyiqra** (10): I need to hear Got the Beat do a cover of this song produced by Dem Jointz with his trademark bizarre style (jk it'd be awful)

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Quick someone play that video of Donald and Daisy dancing to this they’d always show on Disney Channel!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Wow, I guess the real Beat was inside of us all along

**whoisValensi** (10): I always have been entertained by the line "Go-Go music really makes us dance". It's actually a really brilliant triple play of a line. Cause not only does it reference themselves, but also a style of music, and go-go dancing.

**xxipil0ts** (10): im sorry i had to give my 11 to heart of glass

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): Infectiously fun

**qazz23** (9): good surf guitar riff, but not quite as good as Our Lips Are Sealed

**RandomHypnotica** (9): music that plays in the end credits of a cheerleading movie core

**camerinian** (8.5): Belinda's growl on the bridge is the most punk moment of this rate fuck yeah

**2dina3dworld** (8): this is fine but it sounds like it was mixed in a cave

**duracell93** (7.8): Classic

**starla\_** (7.5): very 60s, very fun

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): *Head Over Heels* deserved better (theatre kids will understand this)

**flavasavavandal** (6): kinda lame ngl

**akanewasright** (5): I fear I don’t enjoy this like most of the rest of the album… I blame Debby Ryan in Radio Rebel

**pig-serpent** (2.5): Great guitar riff but I find this song super annoying and it’s overused in every animated movie ever so it’s super played out.

**NewWaneLietoc** (9.673): the yassification of the post-punk spartan sound has never been more clear. even they were surprised when they heard it and realized they hadn't made a punk album, but a legit slab of New West Coast Guitar Pop. great work.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.545): This album is beyond amazing, The Go-Go’s were truly masters of this genre.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.500): This is a masterclass in infectious, carefree pop. Catchy, sweet and with attitude. Only two songs fall a bit short for me. Otherwise, each song is tight and packs a punch. Gina Schock just a beast on the drums, especially on Lust of Love and of course the iconic opening to We Got the Beat. A great fusion of punk sensibilities of Motown-era melodies and harmonies, couldn’t ask for a more “up my alley” album done very well.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.091): Came in expecting this to be my favorite, and I was right. God, I am so smart. Hooks, baybeee!

**flavasavavandal** (8.955): queen shit

**nt96** (8.773): 8.77 I mean it’s the freakin Go Go's, what more can I say? I love em and so will Popheads.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.682): top tier power pop with some of the best hooks of the 80s

**frogaranaman** (8.636): we're rating Justin Bieber and Nicki Minaj ???

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.591): Wait, am I The GoGos stan?

**welcome2thejam** (8.545): Classic power pop album, of course this is in my wheelhouse lol. Think if I was getting into music back then, it'd be one of my absolute favorites.

**2dina3dworld** (8.545): this is 80s high school movie soundtrack core but that doesn’t mean it’s bad - it’s pretty good but at some points is a bit too immature and childish which drags it down

**xxipil0ts** (8.282): ppl say remain in light is the gaslight album but it is clearly this one

**qazz23** (8.182): love the new wave sound of this. there's catchy songs all around with plenty of harmonies, and most of the deep cuts are as good as the singles

**own-photograph-4642** (8.045): It was pretty good for a solid half before somewhat straying from the path. That doesn't mean it's all bad, there are great moments sprinkled throughout. No wonder it reached the summit when it did. 7/10

**babadork** (8.018): My average for this album is a little higher than what I would score the album itself. It has some great songs. Overall, it could use some more variety, but I don’t think that any of the songs are worse than just okay.

=====

bulforster: **duracell93** (7.991): I had only heard the Go-Go’s hits before listening to this album for this rate and I really liked it! Gonna have to add it to the rotation. Thanks for including it!

**jsonphile** (7.818): probably my least favorite of the four artists here, but still a pretty fun album. Still wish The Cars debut self titled was on here instead

**DirtyRat583** (7.764): if this album wasnt here i think i would actually combust

**thedoctordances1940** (7.691): I don't really have much to say about this, it's good at what it's going for and what it's going for is good but it doesn't really go beyond that for me so it just ends up being enjoyable

**MassiveThief** (7.682): fun, easy to listen to, summery, awesome singing + drumming. lots to love!

**fadedblue09** (7.636): Among the four, this album is the most straightforward and easiest to listen to, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This album leans on the pop side than rock, making it a more digestible experience, and still has the bright, colorful aesthetic I associate new wave with.

**vayyiqra** (7.545): The only album I didn't know well before going into this rate, this one I made sure to listen to about 10 times to make sure I was fair to it. It's still my least favourite, and its biggest problem is that it's short yet feels kind of samey. More variety would've be good. But it does have some highlights and is a pretty enjoyable power-pop kind of album [citation may be needed I am not sure I fully understand what power-pop is but you get the idea]. It's very good for a debut. Glad I heard this one! Underrated band.

**celladonn** (7.409): I wasn't familiar with them before this rate so it's definitely been fun to learn more about them! Can't believe this is still the only album written and played by an all female band to top the billboard chart. It's a fun album but I'm not really blown away by anything on it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.182): a cute debut album, some of these songs are generic but its an enjoyable listening experience all the way through

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.000): Oh… why are the not-famous tracks so… plain?

**starla\_** (6.636): Average 6.6. Obligatory 'gotta watch out for Selener' comment. This album was decent, but very front-loaded. The back half definitely has some filler songs.

**pig-serpent** (5.955): I expected to dislike this album because I don’t like the big song, but I found most of the upbeat songs to at least bop even if the darker songs aren’t in their wheelhouse. I don’t know why the audio levels are so inconsistent on Deezer though.

**bulforster** (10): And that in the biz is what we call pulling a Snail Mail! (no seriously the placements match and everything lol) This song is just a tour de force, invented surf rock, marine biology and camp etc, etc. Despite what you guys did to the rest of this album I can at least be proud of you for recognising this for the stone cold classic it is. It even managed to maintain a perfect 10 average for the first five ballots before looking dangerously close to falling out of the top ten. Luckily it recovered and even though it lost a top 3 placement at the last minute, this part of the top ten was very close so I’m all good with this.

**shipperondeck** (10): Yes, Ricky Wilson was right when he said this was the stupidest guitar riff of all time. IT'S STUPID COOL THAT'S WHAT

---

**freav** (11): the pinnacle of music

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Scary Godmother had a greater impact on pop culture than your faves.

**plastichaxan** (11): happy to announce i’ve learned to do most of the weird sounds the girl does but i haven’t had a positive reaction to that yet

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I love lobsters

**seanderlust** (11): "boys in bikinis, girls on surfboards" the gender role fuckery harry styles WISHES

**1998tweety** (10): Crawdaunt teas. Speaking of that was such a weird addition to Ash's team. Like I get you want to showcase the Pokemon of the region but this was a bit of an odd choice if you ask me!

**2dina3dworld** (10): real ones know this song from Just Dance

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the word has been overused and continues to be overused but this is camp

**akanewasright** (10): oh look the best song ever

**bbfan132** (10): a classic and if it gets tanked, i will be devastated

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Looking camp right in the brain stem.

**celladonn** (10): can't believe i used to hate this...

**daretheghost** (10): this fucking bangs idc idc

**duracell93** (10): There are so many amazing part of this song! My third contender for my 11, even though Parallel Lines is my favorite album of the bunch. It is truly a tour de force of whatever exactly the B-52's is (which I love)! Also, you can find the isolated vocals on YouTube and they are a great time!

**flavasavavandal** (10): this isn’t a song, it’s a rock lobster

**frogaranaman** (10): dancing like a Peanuts character to this song

**homestarguy** (10): This guitar riff has and will continue to outlive us all.

**jsonphile** (10): see they just don’t make music like this anymore. So delightfully goofy and weird and an absolute banger

**MrSwearword** (10): a certified classique and proof that being full on batshit insane can benefit a musical effort.

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): camp classic to dance central classic. the kids in athens just wanted to do something really crazy with their nights. what a bawpper.

**own-photograph-4642** (10): Absolute classic

**pig-serpent** (10): So much better than the rest of the album it’s just sad.

**qazz23** (10): really fun and those synth lines are crazy good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok now THIS is the type of camp classic i love

**slimboyfriend** (10): This is one of the greatest songs of the 20th century but so is Heart of Glass, which I sadly gave my 11 to :/

**Stryxen** (10): You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with. You know what I mean, anybody. Children were singing the song at graduations. At weddings. At funerals.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): what more do you want in a song? this song invented camp and invented gay rights

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): A rock lobster is an excellent choice

**vayyiqra** (10): Another throwback to my aforementioned ex who's a B-52s stan: The riff from this song was her ringtone and every time she got a text it would play, so now it is seared in my mind, and I'm happy with that because this song rules

**welcome2thejam** (10): Yeaaaah lmao I never realized how long this song actually is. I'd say it could use a minute trimmed, but I'd also have no idea where to cut it, so maybe it really is perfect as-is. An all-timer riff, some of the funnest vocals ever recorded, and climaxes just when it needs it.

**whoisValensi** (10): Brendon Urie you will not ruin this one for me you shit. Anyways... I like the idea of picking up a rock and thinking it's a rock and going "MY GOODNESS IT'S A LOBSTER".

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9.9): my understanding is fred schneider is the same person as david byrne just gayer

**krusso1105** (9.5): took off 0.5 for overly long weird bit at end

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): was this song always this long wth

**ignitethephoenix** (9): my love of this comes from Just Dance and nothing else

**nt96** (9): they rocked

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): this goes on for so long and it feels like it should get boring but it doesn't that's how much it slays

**camerinian** (8.5): Love how he says "but it wasn't a ROCK" like I'm the idiot in this situation and not the group freaking out over a lobster

**starla\_** (8.5): we were at the beach, everybody had matching towels

**MassiveThief** (8): camp at its best

=====

bulforster: **b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): can't explain why but this sounds like it could be a black midi song

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): ok fine this is camp enough for me to not give it a low score

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Sorry, does not much too for me, except the end is fun and gets it some bonus points

**fadedblue09** (6.5): The ominous synth arrangements are contrasting with the upbeat nature of the song and the last few sections of the song teeter on grating. I guess it's okay but if this is supposed to be their frontrunner then I'm afraid to say I'm quite unimpressed.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I can promise you typing this out feels just as gross as reading it, but I’m glad Brendon Urie took that bassline and gave it the respect it deserves cause this song is flat-out WHACK. The “eeeewww”s, the screams, the whole concept, the fucking fish noises… that was not weed we ate popheads

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i don’t think i see the vision

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Gets points for the wacky iconic factor but if I’m being honest this song has always grated on me… it’s just too damn long! I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the album actually gets a lot better once this song is out of the way, this is the hump we have to get over to get to the good stuff.

**Roxieloxie** (4): i dont think i hate this as much as some people do but it goes on for so much longer than it needs to my god

**TiltControls** (3): I enjoy listening to this song in 30 second bursts. Almost 7 minutes is a bit much for me

**DirtyRat583** (0): wow u r so quirky The B-52's 🤪🤪🤪🤪

**NewWaneLietoc** (10.000): Can pop be revolutionary like this for another queer haven? Cool Town does a fantastic job encapsulating the specialness of this album and the path it paved forward for what was just a group of 5 fellas doing drag and camp and lack of music know how into something beautiful. I don't think a lot of people who did this rate have actually spent years with a 2x1 tape of the two b-52 albums trying to realize they're perfect. they just are its really not hard to overthink this I don't need to hear or read a bunch of people binching they didn't like it or it didn't hit their camp-zone. be fucking thankful these albums existed and inspired a generation. we'll all regret not seeing 'em on tour like we could have.

**2dina3dworld** (9.444): invented camp, invented rock, invented lobsters. The epitome of quirky, campy fun in rock music in one fast paced, artsy and wonderful album. I hate that this will probably be robbed

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.389): Even with all their beloved camp, there’s a lot of energy and grit to this album. Cindy Wilson is a great, freewheeling singer for me. A lot of the songs have a madcap, noodly groove to them that’s so infectious, rock on you “party band”. Really inventive and colorful album I’m glad I finally properly listened to.

**qazz23** (9.000): love the new wave and surf rock sound of this, the musicianship is excellent with the multiple vocalists and it is dancey, the deep cuts are all good too

**AHSWeeknd** (9.000): pair this with a John Waters movie and you’ve got yourself a campy party

**own-photograph-4642** (9.000): From start to finish, an overall blast of energy that doesn't overstay its welcome. If they only made this album and strode into the sunset, they would still be legends. Not only did they bring John and Yoko back, they also gave the Athens, GA scene a huge boost that would define the remainder of the 20th Century. A classic album. 8.5/10

**jsonphile** (8.722): the B-52s are just a delightfully weird band I love them so much. If Love Shack were here it would’ve been my 11 no question that’s seriously one of my favorite songs of all time

**nt96** (8.667): 9.67 I adore the B-52s and couldn't be any more elated to finally rate them (peep the score). Now when can we finally get our lazy, chronically online virgin asses and rate Love Shack already?

**slimboyfriend** (8.556): I’m going to compare the way in which this new wave album parodies and queers the conservative late 50s/early 60s to the way in which hyperpop sometimes revels in and critiques the excess capitalism of the early 20002.This album is queer and new wave and punk and camp and indie and comedy and actually really good.

**welcome2thejam** (8.111): Outside of the album closer, very much enjoyed it. Front four were all fantastic, correctly leaned on killer riffs & grooves and the charisma of their leads. Next four couldn't quite hit those high marks but didn't overstay its welcome either.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.089): I was kinda worried coming into this rate that I wouldn't really like this album but really like the other stuff. Yeah, I was wrong

**frogaranaman** (8.000): isn't that the poisonous red food coloring dye
[/r/popheads/comments/wu5zle/new_wave_giants_rate_reveal_day_3_who_will_be/il8h4ah/]

=====

bulforster: **vayyiqra** (7.889): Yes it's quirky. It's wacky, zany, and goofy. This is why it's fun! I'm kind of baffled by the hate this got from some users; I thought Popheads would eat this album up. Do we like camp here or not? (Don't answer that.) Anyway, a pretty strong debut even though Wild Planet is better

**sarcasticsobs** (7.689): I don’t think this is the type of camp for me to return to much, but I had fun nonetheless

**flavasavavandal** (7.611): this really does sound like a group of queer friends with no varying levels of musical skill bought a bunch of instruments and then made the camp version of post-punk

**celladonn** (7.444): Honestly hard to believe this album was as successful as it was, it's so campy and weird and occasionally exhausting. But it is a lot of fun

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.444): i just don’t understand how anyone can dislike this album, its not the best album of all time but its pure mindless fun, you can’t be sad listening to it. and to think people claim to enjoy camp while disliking this…

**babadork** (7.433): I’m a big fan of this sort of kitsch. If listening to this doesn’t make you want to get into costume and join the band, we probably can’t be friends.

**daretheghost** (7.389): I keep meaning to check out the B-52’s because I’ve had a few friends who were really into them but their music has never quite clicked with me-I tend to think it’s a little too kooky, a little too meandering. It’s great music to sort of groove along to.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.444): i don't dislike this album, but it just feels a little too sparse and empty, and the hooks could be a bit stronger imo. the kitschy, campy sound is really fun though

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.333): I like two B-52’s songs and neither of them are here so… yeah

**starla\_** (6.278): Average 6.3. I expected to like this album overall more than I did. It's a fun first album and meant to be silly but there wasn't much variety and the mixing is not very good which made it less enjoyable to listen to. Stream Cindy Wilson's solo music

**TiltControls** (5.444): I like Love Shack at least

**fadedblue09** (5.167): I feel rude for doing this considering they're about to disband, but I did not enjoy this album at all. Between the grating vocals, the absurd lyrics, and the left-field but occasionally annoying production, this album was one painful slog to get through.

**MassiveThief** (4.889): The more focused songs are good (aka Rock Lobster) but others just sound like the singers are riffing random shit over an instrumental. I have a lot of nostalgia with this band, but the deep cuts ain't hittin

**pig-serpent** (4.556): Most of this album is aimless, devoid of energy, annoying, and feels like it’s using random annoying sounds as a replacement for good songwriting, and yet their style is able to come together for one perfect song that avoids all of the bands pitfalls while leaning hardcore into the style that failed all of the other songs. It’s an enigma to me.

**DirtyRat583** (2.500): they recorded this in the kitchen with 40 minutes and a dream (but it was a nightmare)

**shipperondeck** (10): I first heard this song in Aquamarine and it irrevocably changed the course of my life

**bulforster** (9.5): With two zeroes as well! This is the only song to ever break the hold on the top 2 the last songs had ever so briefly and here emerges as the top song of a second tier of the competition for #6 to #3. Debbie's growl is so good that it overcame years of being overused in commercials and movies, unfortunately it couldn't overcome the clear top 2 in this rate.

---

**akanewasright** (11): thinking about when they did this song on Sabrina the Teenage Witch… that was my main experience with the song I wasn’t prepared for how hard it would slay tbh

**apatel27** (11): classic

**CrimsonROSET** (11): why do artists always make their stalker songs like insanely good

**flavasavavandal** (11): a staple of classic rock that holds up a lot better than the other big single from Parallel Lines with its jagged guitar and sense of neverending determination. Also contains the best hook on the album

**TiltControls** (11): Debbie Harry just absolutely slays this song. Everything about it is so much fun (even if the background for the song is super creepy)

**1998tweety** (10): this is good but this song is lowkey ruined for me cause I prefer the Glee version by a lot

**2dina3dworld** (10): some people would say this song is about me

**AHSWeeknd** (10): no amount of late-2000s commercials that have overused this iconic bop will stop me from giving it a 10

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): of course i find out that debbie harry was supposedly almost kidnapped by ted bundy through the genius lyrics page for this song

**bbfan132** (10): that guitar solo is s-tier

**bigbigbee** (10): Sometimes I encounter a true Mother like Debbie harry and I feel ashamed about all the 20-somethings I’ve called Mother

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): …gonna get that rate win?? Probably not but slaaaaayyy.

**celladonn** (10): Her aggressive vocals are such a slay

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): yes she’s timeless

**DirtyRat583** (10): outsold 1d (i expect to be put in another section along with 30 of the same comment)

**frogaranaman** (10): this is one of those songs you learn by heart without even realizing

**homestarguy** (10): Angelica from Rugrats gettin’ flashbacks listening to this.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): stalker ANTHEM

**MrSwearword** (10): a certified classique that has been immortalized thanks to Lady Camden in Freddie Mercury geish werking it out on Drag Race.

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): swiffer anthem I was seven and it made me wanna swiffer

**pig-serpent** (10): Debbie Harry’s going goblin mode on these vocals. One of the songs that got me into music.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): stalker anthem <3

**sarcasticsobs** (10): All-timer vocal performance

**slimboyfriend** (10): As much as this song is played all the time, It’s still really interesting to me. From the guitar solo to the bridge in half-time to the way Debbie Harry’s voice changes characters with every sentence.

**Stryxen** (10): i was talking to my friend about what we were listening to before we met up and this song was paused on my phone so i mentioned it and she, at the age of twenty one, thought it was a one direction original. anyway. I love the bridge it sounds like circus music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): stalking has never sounded so good!

**vayyiqra** (10): Putting aside how this song is inextricably linked to Swiffer brooms in my head, I have to wonder how many raters will misunderstand what this song is about and write cursed comments (really hope it's none)

**whoisValensi** (10): Oh god this absolute classic. For no cover will ever hold a candle to the original, tho I will always think of those fucking Swiffer ads...

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9.9): getchagetchagetchagetcha

**duracell93** (9.9): I mean it’s a classic for a reason! The grit in Debbie Harry’s voice really takes this song to another level

**babadork** (9.7): I never thought about it before, but it’s kind of weird that such a popular song would have sirens in it.

**jsonphile** (9.5): stalking has never sounded so fun

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): The only stalker song Blondie needed

**seanderlust** (9.2): ok i was going to drag these lyrics for being really creepy but apparently they were actually based on an encounter debbie had with an ex-stalker so way to take that awful experience and put it in a bop!

**letsallpoo** (9): i will forever associate this with swiffer commercials

**qazz23** (9): really like the main guitar riff and the outro, also: http://i.imgur.com/BlwdUH3.png

**static\_int\_husp** (9): probably the biggest bop about a stalker (aside: Jesus why are there so many of these)

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you till you love me

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): You’ll never see me reference Glee in any of my rate comments ever, but I have to admit… I did in fact sing the Glee version of this in high school…

bulforster: **cremeebrulee** (8.8): i hate glee so much

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): great song but is a tad overrated i fear

**daretheghost** (8.5): A huge hit and that’s great but it’s one that I’m kind of tired of at this point, especially with such a great discography.

**starla\_** (8.5): stream one direction

**xxipil0ts** (8.5): ppl knew this bc of one direction, but i knew it bc of rugrats and it shows im too old for this sub

**plastichaxan** (8.4): classic just not that much of a classic to me sorry

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): Harry Styles and Santana Lopez outsold

**own-photograph-4642** (8): The soundtrack to Swiffer commercials everywhere.

**pahc** (8): she came on this PISSED as hell

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): not to be that person but i genuinely cant disassociate this song away from 1D no matter what I do, which means I genuinely cant hear this song in my head anymore not mashed up with teenage kicks so hearing it in its pure mother form is highkey jarring to me like i've never heard the bridge of this song until right now and I dont know how i feel

**thedoctordances1940** (7): i feel like the one direction association leave both a negative and positive association to this song in my mind but like idk, the song is good but I also find it slightly annoying at time

**welcome2thejam** (7): This is a 9-10 in a vacuum that gets dinged for overuse dulling my love for it. Am adding a point back because I forgot how dope the bridge and Debbie's voice right as it comes back afterwards are since that's never the part they use in commercials/media

**camerinian** (5): This song’s fine, I wouldn’t like turn it off in the wild or anything, but it’s actually kind of annoying compared to the rest of this album? Idk maybe I’m just not wild on Debbie Harry doing the classic punk nasal repetition shit

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): A friend described this as “not a real song. it’s like, a song that’s only supposed to be played in movies” and he was so right

**fadedblue09** (0): A song that gets progressively grating with every minute

**nt96** (0): Out of all the classic songs throughout the 70s and 80s, this one's not it for me, which is unfortunate because it's not a bad song per se, it's just that I've heard this song so much on advertisements and other things to the point where I've become numb to the song. Perhaps I'll come around and love it all over again, but that day is not today.

**bulforster** (10): This song didn’t even get a score below 10 for the first twelve ballots. But after a while it couldn’t stand up at all to the sheer number of 11s Once in a Lifetime had and it looked completely shut out of the race. In the last few days of the rate it received the majority of its elevens and got back in the competition, managing to take #1 for a decent number of ballots. A leaderboard-worthy number of 11s is still hard to beat, even if you are one of the definitive singles of the late 70s, but settling for our 24th highest rated song is a pretty decent consolation prize.

**shipperondeck** (9.9): Yes, I am joining the hivemind here. Let's see this get second place.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): D I S C O

**bigbigbee** (11): fart of ass shart of ass heart of bad etc etc etc

**celladonn** (11): heart of yass

**daretheghost** (11): Giving this anything less than a 10 is tanking i m o

**ignitethephoenix** (11): definitely my favorite Blondie song, just pure new wave bliss

**MrSwearword** (11): easiest score of eleven I've given in a rate. One of the best songs in the herstory of recorded music.

**qazz23** (11): amazing rhythm section and vocals, love the disco feel

**slimboyfriend** (11): Proof that more bands should sell out!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): If you asked me what my favorite song is, I'd brush it off as a silly question. Now if you asked the same question with a gun pointed at my head, I could see myself answering Heart of Glass. It's not a guaranteed answer, but even the possibility speaks volumes on how much I love this song. Blondie take my basic energy

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I’ll never forgive myself for not doing the Disco rate so I guess I have to capture that feeling somehow

**xxipil0ts** (11): how could u not feel good with this song now come on

**1998tweety** (10): ended that fad Miley

**2dina3dworld** (10): pretend we’re rating the special mix, otherwise I’d probably tank it purely because it’s not the special mix

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): yass we love a sellout queen /s

**bbfan132** (10): nothing to say here, obviously a classic

**camerinian** (10): i underrated this in the disco classics rate cos it felt so wrong to let a white band take out a rate comparing classics of a black-originated genre, but here? yeah, perfect song and also ideal winner, inscribe the part where the instrumental goes into ⅞ on my tombstone somehow

**cremeebrulee** (10): this deserved better in the disco rate too idc!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): yea sorry it’s a 10 and it’s a bigger 10 inside this album

**DirtyRat583** (10): iconic, amazing, changed the world, essence of pussy poppery comment etc.

**duracell93** (10): my first introduction to Blondie was listening to this song on a compilation cd I had as a kid called Pure Disco Vol 3 and I fell in love immediately lol

**fadedblue09** (10): Easily the album standout, sounds closest to the bright, colorful synth-heavy arrangements I associate new wave with.

**frogaranaman** (10): bulforster and shipperondeck are probably gonna receive psychic damage every time Miley Cyrus' cover is referenced and preferred in this rate like when Roxieloxie and TiltControls got psychic damage from every time Glee's version was referenced and preferred in 60s Pop Soul

**homestarguy** (10): I hope no one scored this one 7/4 as a clever joke for the music nerds out there.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I think what people don’t appreciate enough about this song is just how over it Debbie is. Like she’s just like “yeah he was an asshole. Oh well, im over it” and doesn’t even muster the energy to feel sad about it. The lack of apathy is why the Miley cover is garbage btw.

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): great undefeatable ditty

**nt96** (10): I feel so dumb for finding out the Pain in the ass line wasn't something Miley adlibed in order to be edgy lol

**own-photograph-4642** (10): Personally, it doesn't hold a candle to the Once I Had a Love demo but it's still a classic nonetheless.

**pig-serpent** (10): It’s amazing how much I didn’t care about this song when I first heard it 10 years ago and now I’m all “Holy shittttt, Heart of Glass!!!!” then sing it to myself for 3 days every time I hear it.

**starla\_** (10): this song reminds me of Brad from Bon Appetit but that's alright cos it's a banger

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Timeless banger

**vayyiqra** (10): This is the first Blondie song I ever heard, because we had just figured out how to download music and my dad wanted to show me it. (Shoutout to boomer dads liking Blondie by the way, dudes rock.) Ironically I didn't like it at the time and thought it was cheesy! Today I love Giorgio Moroder-produced disco songs. I think that's growth. also I was about 12 so my taste was bad

**welcome2thejam** (10): Are you gonna be the one to low score this all-time bop? Cause I'm not sure not

**whoisValensi** (10): This is probably gonna win the rate and I'm not helping by giving it a 10 but it's a fucking classic!

bulforster: **Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9.9): this is like disco from minions rise of gru

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): This is a slay but sadly it’s not quite THE slay.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): it's just a classic innit

**akanewasright** (9): this is the most basic winner ever… but basic bitches can make a good point or two

**CrimsonROSET** (9): to think this will be rate villain in two different rates… iconic kinda

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): [Out of curiosity I looked up what happened last time we rated this song and it placed #7 in the Classic Disco Singles rate!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/j0ujj4/classic_disco_singles_rate_reveal_day_3_my_11/g6vjde1/) Maybe it’ll fare even better this time around?

**plastichaxan** (9): hmm maybe not a 10 but still a classic

**sarcasticsobs** (9): So glad that no one has ever tried to cover this, that’d be a shame!

**TiltControls** (8): I'd be much happier with this doing well here instead of the Disco rate

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): this is such a great song, I just wish I connected to it more on a more personal level

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): I'll be honest, this song has always been one of my least favourite Blondie hits, its just kinda there

**Stryxen** (7): heart of yas (not quite yass)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): im gonna regret not tanking this when this ends up in the top 2 in the reveal aren’t i

**bulforster** (10): And we have our winner! Rina can attest to my annoyance towards the beginning of the rate when this stormed into the lead, at one point hitting a 10.75 average. However once Heart of Glass caught up and we had a real competition I realised I was definitely rooting for this song and once again with my rates we had a photo finish of the winner flipping at the very last minute. This song is just so beautiful and timeless and most importantly fun, a deserving winner!

**shipperondeck** (7): Lowering this bc my dad who introduced me to new wave music does not really vibe with this song. Sorry for ruining ur average popheads

---

**2dina3dworld** (11): me after this comes second: “this is not my beautiful popheads!”

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): THIS IS NOT MY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE!

**bbfan132** (11): easiest 11 ever

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (11): is this the best song? Also i'm fairly confident the video was done by Toni Basil of “Oh Mickey, you're so fine. You're so fine, you blow my mind, hey Mickey” fame

**fadedblue09** (11): this literally has "classic" written all over it. I hate not being able to contribute to the 11 spread, but sadly this was the clear standout of the rate for me

**frogaranaman** (11): David Byrne really said "let me make a song for both those loved and not loved by their dad" with this one

**Gonza\_90** (11): A song ahead of it's time, simply wonderful

**homestarguy** (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCY0aeUx-Ns

**jsonphile** (11): if I had a nickel for every time I gave this song an 11 I’d have two nickels. This song and its music video are just so great. So delightfully weird

**MassiveThief** (11): it was unfortunately never a competition for me. the lyrics, the manic delivery, the triumphant chorus - all as if this song comes from another world.

**nootnoot781** (11): it deserved to win the indieheads rate too, but i guess it can only win once in a lifet-[GUNSHOT]

**own-photograph-4642** (11): Same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was, same as it ever was....

**pig-serpent** (11): Nothing needs to be said about how obviously great this song is. Same as it ever was (Same as it ever was)

**Roxieloxie** (11): I think i've mentioned that my first exposure to this was the kermit clip when i 11ed this in Indieheads but i dont think I mentioned there that when i first saw the clip I didnt realize that this was a real song, I simply thought the joke was that kermit was in this suit with giant shoulder pads and was singing this 'lol random xD song ' where he kept shouting, and ill be honest and saw that I didnt realize there was a real song behind it until maybe 3 or so years ago. Anyway [2] whatever I said last time, I still really love this,, same as it ever was

**skargardin** (11): This is just so insanely trippy and simply fun

**starla\_** (11): this song is so ridiculous but it makes me really emotional. It really taps into feelings of insignificance and smallness and makes you realise that those feelings are just a normal part of life and time passing. Same as it ever was.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I almost gave this my 11 in the indieheads exchange rate, but am truly glad to give it here instead. Yes, it's nonsense. But it's spouted in such a way that it almost seems profound. I truly think it's a shining example of David Byrne's absurdity and how it can be crafted to create timeless art.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i know i say this on every single song i give an 11 to in rates but this is genuinely one of my favorite songs of all time. ever since i was a kid i’ve loved this song and it only gets better with age. there was no other option for what my 11 could be its just too nostalgic

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): Kermit's version does slay this one though

**vayyiqra** (11): Going to have to be basic and 11 this because it really is a great song, very catchy, fun, memeable, and relatable. I too wish I had a wife, house and automobile. But I don't :pensive: maybe someday. For now I must ask myself ... where IS that large automobile? Truly.

**welcome2thejam** (11): Just an all-timer, a true blue classic, what else can you say that hasn't been said? Wasn't gonna be my 11 coming in, but it absolutely took my breath away relistening for the rate

=====

bulforster: **akanewasright** (10): this is the most fun midlife crisis sermon I’ve ever heard

**bigbigbee** (10): I will never forget the euphoria that I felt when this started playing in the Charity 3 (?) reveal to signify that the Indieheads Exchange rate had been chosen for the mini rate in early 2021! (By the way I stand by the thought that that rate was great, and I’m glad it happened, despite the mess.) That was my introduction to this song, but I soon learned that my dad and mom are both huge Talking Heads fans, and that this is by the same band that did the fun little Guitar Hero song, Psycho Killer. I also learned that it’s great!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I was gonna give this my 11 but my suppressed misandry kicked in just a little bit at the last second and let it get snatched away.

**camerinian** (10): That relatable moment when you’ve listened to this song hundreds of times but never thought about decoding the lyrical metaphor and then you go on Genius and find out it's a reflection on the futility of capitalism and how the pursuit of the American dream will eventually leave you unfulfilled and burnt out and somehow you end up more in love with the song than ever

**celladonn** (10): me giving this a 10 again... same as it ever was

**daretheghost** (10): this 10 is for you, kermit

**ImADudeDuh** (10): yeah its good because

**MrSwearword** (10): oh fuck me up, this track slaps

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): In SPITE of this song being so engrained in culture and the lowest fucking hanging fruit of a meme and whatnot (the kermit bit rules. bill & mandy quoting it SUCKS; do a bit on Found a Job instead), an undeniable, powerful ten/11 (not giving it an 11 I know what talking heads I like best and they need those points). ANYWAYS, let's go to my Best of Talking Heads CD liner book for some choice excerpts regarding OIAL's prowess from El-P and Seymour Stein. El-P: "this is a hip-hop song. I went to school in Brooklyn. After school sometimes kids would form breakdancing scircles and battle each other. One day some kid brought in a tape of the first 8 bars of OIAL, which he had looped in his cassette deck so that it repeated over and over. They formed a circle and battled each other over the same loop FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR." Eno didn't get the song at first, and I don't think the Heads realized they were making hip-hop tbh. Seymour Stein: "On 12/8/80 I was in India. Soon after takeoff I looked at the front page of the Times of India and saw the headline: JOHN LENNON SHOT DEAD. I was shaken beyond belief. I was carrying an early Sony Walkman and had a tape of the new THs LP. Playing the album--particularly the track OIAL--over and over helped calm me down. I was staying at the lake palace. the setting of the hotel in the middle of the lake, accessible only by boat, and the lyrics of the song seemed significant Lennon and I were neighbors. I lived right across from the Dakota in the Majestic Apartments on Central Park West. I used to see John and Yoko in the neighborhood. I'll never gorget where I was the day I learned of his death and the song that helped me chill out...OIAL." Again, had Lennon heard Remain in Light? what could have happened? something about the guy who signed the Talking Heads losing a neighbor and contemplating that over this song as we push forward into a scary new decade of austerity where Lennon will no longer produce a novum or novelty (regardless of how shitty that bro was tbh)...idk its very bittersweet and I love reading that dispatch. music is wild sometimes like that and this is one of the most important songs out there. remember those stories if you hate this song for some reason.

**nt96** (10): We love existentially dreadful kings (and queen)

**qazz23** (10): the insanely catchy verses and chorus plus the funky and danceable sound really make this, it's a definite classic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): deserved winner

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Looking at the Spotify plays, how the hell is this the only song I’ve heard on this record? What were my parents doing when I grew up? Is it basic to give it a 10? Don’t care! Maybe it shouldn’t be this good!

**seanderlust** (10): i mean of course i'm going to give this a 10. songs to have a full-blown existential crisis to

**slimboyfriend** (10): tell me why this song sounds religious to me

**thedoctordances1940** (10): something actually happening on this album omg. but yeah this is a classic

**whoisValensi** (10): This is not my 11 because I don't play my 11s strategically for wins like some people do but my god I need this to win the rate. The power this song fucking HAS. It's a classic, the video is a classic, it actually got me to bond with my mother which is something that doesn't really happen, THERE ARE MEMES. COME ON GUYS YOU DON'T GET A SONG THAT PRESENTS THIS MUCH GOODNESS MORE THAN ONCE IN A LIFETIME. And I am glad to say that in my lifetime I've found this song and this album and this band. Basically what I'm saying is I just think Talking Heads...

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.9): My god! What have I done!

**TiltControls** (8.5): Kermit's version would be a 10

**1998tweety** (8): there are some campy elements to this

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Are we sure this song is about consumerism and existentialism and it’s not just a very lengthy and roundabout lesson on the water cycle?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): there are good elements of this but I hope this doesn’t win cause the verses are annoying

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): i don't really get the overwhelming acclaim for this song, it would be an ok winner but i wouldn't be thrilled with it

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): https://imgur.com/a/6ErMRzQ

**CrimsonROSET** (7): to be brave for a moment this is……. fine. not bad, not crazy good. Perfectly fine.

**plastichaxan** (7): i don’t get why this is the favorite but i also do idk i just remember liking it better on ih exchange for some reason

**DirtyRat583** (6.5): AND YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF 👺

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I have no personal vendetta against this song anymore, and the person who gave this an 11 can thank David Byrne for me not sinking this song

**Stryxen** (6): iconic chorus. disappointing everything else … but I think i like it overall

**AHSWeeknd** (10.083): An honest classic. This is the sort of album that influenced 80s rock. The band was such a gem and honestly made unforgettable music. Though I am happy Debbie Harry went her way and further explored her talent as an actor, I would’ve loved to see/hear how this band would be influenced by 80s rock. Which would be some sort of influenception but still. Also this album cover is so pleasing.

**MrSwearword** (9.083): I have this on CD so I'm perhaps biased.

**vayyiqra** (8.667): One of the best new wave albums of the 70s. I think of new wave as an 80s genre, but it began in the late 70s, and all the elements are here: rock, pop, punk, disco, it's full of jams. It's both retro and forward-thinking at the same time. Have to love the simplicity of the cover too; it is definitely Blondie standing in front of a bunch of parallel lines, because that is the name of the album. Side note: I keep thinking this is their debut and it's not, but that's my fault for not listening to the rest of their discography! Should do that

**qazz23** (8.667): nice variety of sounds on this album, from punk to disco to new wave

**slimboyfriend** (8.583): Please understand that idk what I mean when I say this, but the playing on this album is SO GOOD. Like yeah Debbie Harry is an icon but like, the drumming?? Yeah.

**DirtyRat583** (8.575): the talent this album showcases... debbie [idk her surname] forever an icon

**daretheghost** (8.458): Blondie is one of my very favorite bands (my username comes from “Angels on the Balcony”) and I’m so excited that Popheads is finally rating an album by them-and I hope people like it! It’s not necessarily my favorite–that might be Plastic Letters–but it’s definitely one of their strongest.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.292): this one's just really good

**babadork** (8.267): Doing this rate has convinced Spotify that the only music I want to listen to is Blondie and the occasional song from The English Beat, and I’m okay with that.

**2dina3dworld** (8.142): this was fine but kinda bland. Very in one ear but out the other. I don’t have any strong feelings, it’s just very radio and that isn’t inherently bad but when you try to appeal to most people than that’s where things get boring
[/r/popheads/comments/wu5zle/new_wave_giants_rate_reveal_day_3_who_will_be/il8l3nd/]

=====

bulforster: **jsonphile** (7.917): It’s a really good album. It’s a shame that Blondie’s best song, Call Me, isn’t on here though.

**pig-serpent** (7.917): I love bands that bring punk energy to pop music and I do not have enough of this album in my rotation.

**flavasavavandal** (7.917): Blondie opens up the album with hit after hit and then just slowly forget how to make the songs connect on visceral levels. There is also a feminist streak that runs through this album I really appreciate, especially with the way it plays and flips gender roles like on Hanging on the Telephone or One Way Or Another. Pretty great shit!

**nt96** (7.875): 7.875 What an album honestly, despite them unfortunately getting my 0, they still rocked and deserve their flowers.

**welcome2thejam** (7.750): Unfortunately remains on my "thought I'd like this better than I did" list. Has some absolute classics of course, and this is still a mighty good score, but my expectations were super high and just too much in the "good but..." territory

**thedoctordances1940** (7.592): I don't think this album has aged all that well for me, a lot of it feels like it should be better but it just sounds a bit underwhelming

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.583): Love how this album is just rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock rock ✨✨ DISCO ✨✨ 🥳🕺😩💃 rock rock

**own-photograph-4642** (7.458): Parallel Lines seems apt for an album title given how indecisive Blondie were when it came to who they want to be. Do they want to be punk rockers? Or do they want to be pop stars? The back and forth seemed frustrating throughout the listen. Still a high point in their career and this is a good album. 7/10

**NewWaneLietoc** (7.425): in spite of being the only group here to achieve a numero reissue (for some fucking reason), it's not as good as DIIV's oshin. now THAT's a NYC classic. anyways blondie's cool and i like when she raps on rapture (next album i think?). this album meant something important and novel and super cool in 1979. it's been heavily outclassed in the 40 years since by a series of reissues from pylon to bush tetras, new pop second-movers and outclassers like Grace Jones and Lizzy mercier descloux, and unfortunately, anyone who put a release out on ROIR. also the go-gos just yass and slay harder in this rate. still a fine release but we didn't need it.

**frogaranaman** (7.417): Blondie was and always will be so fucking cool

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.833): this was definitely a lot worse than i remember it being, so many of the deep cuts here are completely unmemorable and even some of the singles don’t hold up that well.

**fadedblue09** (6.250): Considering how much I despised One Way or Another, this album was not as bad as I was expecting. The highlights are definitely memorable, but there are too many unremarkable (and sometimes outright terrible) filler tracks which make the whole experience quite uneven.

**starla\_** (6.208): Average score 6.2. Honestly I've never been a huge Blondie fan and this album really solidifies why. I'm not a big fan of the retro pastiche they have going on here and there isn't much variety, especially at the album's back end.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.333): I’m surprised how much of this I disliked. Maybe I came to this album too late, I’ve heard way too many new wave and/or post-punk albums that do what they’re doing better. Outside of the iconic songs I’m overly-familiar with, the album cuts feel weirdly non-committall and half-assed. This sentiment is even stronger against this particular rate lineup where the other albums have the artists really going for it. I get that “not trying” can be a whole “New York City band vibe”, but I even think other NYC bands do this better lkasdkfl like the effortless cool of The Velvet Underground, cuz underneath the hood they were brimming with a lot of far-reaching ideas. On this album a lot of the album cuts feel undercooked, so it’s a miss for me. Songs are saved from utter tanking cuz shout out to their guitarist who’s very good. Not sure how it happened but I’m not really feeling Debbie Harry here, though I respect her influence. It sounds like she’s singing the words without either cool irreverence or passionate meaning. A “New York band” I was grasping for some focus and commitment from beyond the style.

**whoisValensi** (10.125): Little did I know how much I actually adore this album.

**2dina3dworld** (10.125): okay, so this is one of my favourite albums so it kinda justifies the high average. It’s just so fun, so dynamic and so maximalist but with a lot of cute individual details to pick apart. There’s not one wasted minute on this record, every single song packs a punch and brings something new to the table.

**frogaranaman** (10.125): struggling not to put this entire album into my new wave playlist rn

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10.000): one of the most beloved albums of all time and for good reason, it's just so wonderfully vibrant and colorful and they nail the funky sound they were going for. a perfect album imo, every song here knocks it out of the park

**own-photograph-4642** (9.813): THE Album of the Rate for me, but also an oddball. The most approachable and experimental of the Talking Heads album, Remain in Light showcased that it was possible for Afrobeat to gain a foothold in the fabric of American music (it would have gotten there anyway) and it further accelerated Byrne and co. as some of the most inventive musicians of their day. Indisputable masterpiece. 10/10

**vayyiqra** (9.625): My favourite album in the rate, I was skeptical for a long time this was as great as it's hyped up to be. It seems like the kind of album that's hyped up by idk, music critics, record stores, things like that. Turns out that's because this album simply rules. Yes all of it! I could say more but will cut myself off here and just add that if you like this, please also listen to the funk and Afrobeat artists who inspired it (signal-boosting /u/darjeelingdarkroast who recommends Funkadelic and Fela Kuti). Also listen to Discipline by King Crimson since it's like this album (and even has Adrian Belew on guitar as well) but it's even zanier and just as good

**welcome2thejam** (9.625): One of my favorite albums ever. A fantastic front five run capable of stacking up against anything else in music. Wouldn't be surprised if this is my highest album average in a rate, or just in general even

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.188): Wait, am I Talking Heads stan?

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.988): I had already listened to this album before the rate but it's still my favorite discovery like how

**daretheghost** (8.938): I’m only recently-within the last 2-3 years or so–Talking Headspilled but I am so happy for it.

**nt96** (8.875): 7.89 As an unapologetic Radiohead fan, Talking Heads have always been those bands that I constantly hear about, but never get around to actually listen to their music, until now. Overall, the album is very decent and quite groovy at times! Almost got my 11, but not close enough.

**NewWaneLietoc** (8.813): the platonic idea of a perfect album. would never rank in my top 500 lol--i know the talking heads I like best (laurie anderson's big science and the david byrne/eno collab my life in a bush of ghosts, and more songs about buildings). incredible group of songs collected and grooved out.

**jsonphile** (8.688): I surprisingly didn’t like the album as much as I thought I would, but it’s still really good. Talking Heads are always fun to listen to

**flavasavavandal** (8.688): this album’s tracks do not follow the same quality pattern as GOT

**qazz23** (8.500): I like the new wave post-punk sound of this, the rhythm section is very good, but didn't care for the last two tracks

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.500): anyone who gave Remain in Light a 9+ average please listen to a Fela Kuti album and PM me your book report https://open.spotify.com/album/7325GfKum2hDK231i3LqA7?si=F2U4UhwMRaS8yI-4Fp3EtQ and let’s add Maggot Brain and The Meters self-titled album in here for good measure, also shout out if you’ve heard these already but I’ve checked chuubot in some servers and it’s looking dire here besties Anyway, yes this album has so many great songs on it! Got a lot of 10s from me! Sadly it starts off in a way I don’t really connect with but picks up rapidly by the time The Great Curve hits. Not sure why, but I’m way more into experimental Talking Heads than pop Talking Heads. There could be a “Seinfeld is unfunny” effect where their influence on indie music is everywhere so the source material doesn’t sound as special. Regardless, I really clicked with the out-there spoken word and ambient-trolling shit they had here haha. A great album overall with highlights, though I may never get into the flawless GOAT reputation it has for some earlier cuts falling flat for me.

bulforster: **AHSWeeknd** (8.375): David Byrne was a creative force. His film True Stories exemplifies his storytelling ability, that being said, I’m not saying I’m a fan of it.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.287): Can’t believe a popheads rate is what finally got me to listen to a full Talking Heads album. Not that I was even avoiding it, I’m just lazy. This shit sounds fantastic, I get the Hype

**slimboyfriend** (8.063): I know I don’t enjoy this album as much as most people, but I do think this album is a classic just because it doesn’t sound like anything that came before it. Some of the earlier Talking Heads albums did sound like this, but Remain In Light is like a scaled-up version of everything they’d done before it.

**celladonn** (8.063): Really cool album, the afrobeat influences and intriguing lyrics give it such an interesting flavour

**starla\_** (7.813): Average 7.8. This is a challenging album with lots of unusual instrumentation, sound layering and of course David Byrne's voice. It's a rewarding listen though and I really enjoyed it overall. Once In a Lifetime is a really special song to me, but it was good to hear it in the context of the album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.463): one of the greatest albums of all time according to critics, and although my scores may seem to differ i have to agree! the talking heads really put everything they had into this and the result is one of the most unique sounding albums a rock band has ever produced. this could’ve been released today and it would still be just as acclaimed

**fadedblue09** (7.375): Considering how revered this album is, I'm quite whelmed. There are some memorable tunes here, but for the most part, its attempts at grappling for a more artistic direction seems to be hit or miss, leading to a somewhat inconsistent experience.

**MassiveThief** (7.313): The back half is super weak compared to the first, but that that first four track run is legendary

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.750): This album is giving me big “in desperate need of therapy” energy

**thedoctordances1940** (6.700): There's a lot of interesting ideas but I just don't find it a particularly enjoyable listen and so like eh it just ends up being fine

**pig-serpent** (6.563): Post punk songwriting is super hit or miss for me, and while I completely understand why people who like that style love this album, it’s not really made for me and I think I’ll stick to their poppier works.

**babadork** (6.400): I did not know that I hated the second half of this album until I was rating it. I guess I never really sat down and listened to the whole thing before. Every song before Houses in Motion is amazing, but every song after it is horrible.

**DirtyRat583** (6.163): hounds of love for annoying people

**ImADudeDuh** (5.625): I feel bad because this makes me realize that they really were ahead of their time but I still just don’t care for these songs :sob:

**Stryxen** (5.125): i have tried getting into this album at least 5 times over the years, NOT for me, after all these listens i have only managed to click with one and a half songs and the rest are just vaguely competent to me. Talking heads 77 and speaking in tongues YOU will always be famous

TiltControls: Thanks Bul and Rina for hosting an amazing rate! Much closer than I expected, and it was fantastic getting to listen to these classics.

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

## Songs

Congrats to Talking Heads for pulling off the rate win! I honestly thought it was a given for them so also congrats to Blondie for getting Heart of Glass so close!

* Both songs make the top 25 highest song averages leaderboard. **Once in a Lifetime** takes 16th overall and **Heart of Glass** is right behind in 24th.

* With 25 11's **Once in a Lifetime** also takes a spot on the most 11's for a song leaderboard. It sits in 16th place in a tie with Jessie Ware's Spotlight
 
 * Due to the new addition, View, Psycho, and Immaterial all fall off this list (at 20 11's each)

* With 32.50% of all the 11's in the rate, **Once in a Lifetime** also takes a spot on the 11 Mangets top 10! It knocks off Mr. Brightside from the list which had 31.00%

Besides the top 2 there were no other 9+ ratings, though it seems like most of the songs near the top couldn't get out of that 8.8-8.9 section.

## Artists

No new artist leaderboard records, but averages are listed below. While this is the first time for any of these artists on the board keep in mind that Talking Heads have one prior rating (for Once in a Lifetime in IH Exchange) and Blondie has 3 (Call Me twice and Heart of Glass once).

Own-Photograph-4642: LETTING THE DAYS GO BY! 

This is one of the best rates I've done. Thanks to the organizers who set this together and to the artists who made these records that deserve their classic statuses. This was fun!

welcome2thejam: Sad I couldn't follow the reveal live since I was so busy w/ Bubblegrunge, I'll def have to look at those playlists as this was the rate I was most anticipating of those picked

That said, *you might find yourself a rate winner!* So happy that it won such a close battle.

Edit: And also congrats hosts!
