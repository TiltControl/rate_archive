**bulforster** (4.5): I like the story behind this song a lot more than the actual song, unfortunately knockoff Joy Division just doesn't really do it for me. This is by far my least favourite closer of the rate and fair first elimination.

**shipperondeck** (0): Sorry this song makes me feel like shit

---

# Joy Division stans

**2dina3dworld** (10): I remember the story behind this as being an attempt at recreating Joy Division but due to a lack of distribution in the US, they didn‚Äôt have the greatest of reference points so they just went with what they thought Joy Division was. And thus, we got the Overload, which sounds like Closer Joy Division

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A masterpiece of a closer. This beat is insanity.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): they did it, they out joy divisioned joy division

**bbfan132** (10): this is a completely different sound from the previous tracks ‚Ä¶ now i want to hear more of this from them

**whoisValensi** (10): Despite the fact this is my least favorite track from this album, it's still a 10. That's right, it's one of *those* albums, where every track is great. This song geuinely beats down on the listener for 6 minutes and you know what, that's fucking FANTASTIC. I love that.

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9): joy division sonic fanfic

**own-photograph-4642** (9): Perhaps the best Joy Division pastiche.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Damn the grooves are over, you can't shake ass to this... or can I...?

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): I love proto-slowcore

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this will be called sleepy but idc, the goth vibes get several points from me

**starla\_** (8.5): is this song about climate change?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): ambient but camp

**MrSwearword** (8): at least I get why this track closes off the album.

**pig-serpent** (8): The dark atmosphere is fantastic and more than makes up for a lack of ‚Äúexcitement.‚Äù

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah I know it's 6 minutes long of droning. It's still an enjoyable song and the backstory behind it is hilarious. It DOES sound like a song Joy Division could have plausibly made! But it's also the worst track on the album and took a while to like it lol

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): yeah ok this is cool

**Roxieloxie** (7.1): hes prob saying some real shit but my ass is falling asleep

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): shout out to this song for having the funniest genius annotation of all time: ‚Äú‚ÄòThe Overload‚Äô is Talking Heads' attempt to create a song in the signature style of Joy Division. The catch? None of the band had ever actually heard Joy Division; the song was written based entirely on descriptions in the music press.‚Äù

**seanderlust** (6.5): hmm. kind of a strange concluding track given the rest of the album. it's kind of nice but still
[/r/popheads/comments/wskjyy/new_wave_giants_rate_reveal_day_1_you_cant_lose/ikyyzw4/]

=====

bulforster: # Over it

**1998tweety** (6): im over this album at this point

**camerinian** (6): I have no idea if Genius is telling the truth that these guys wanted to make a Joy Division song without ever having heard Joy Division, but if that‚Äôs the case this is the funniest way they could have ended this album, and also only a bit off the mark

**CrimsonROSET** (6): what a weird way to end the album

**daretheghost** (6): I can‚Äôt throw ass to this (I recognize what they‚Äôre trying to do but it-like Joy Division‚Äìjust doesn‚Äôt do it for me)

**slimboyfriend** (6): Okay yeah it‚Äôs spooky and stuff but I got a lil bored :////

**duracell93** (5.5): Vibey in a way I like less than Listening Wind

**DirtyRat583** (5): if u gave this song an 8 or above you are insufferable

**pahc** (5): this just drags on infinitely long. not a huge fan of drone and this was just so boring

**RandomHypnotica** (5): ok this was just really long, meandering and uncomfortable

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): ‚ÄúTalking Head‚Äôs attempt to create a song in the signature style of Joy Division. The catch? None of the band had ever actually heard Joy Division‚Äù holy fucking shit that‚Äôs the most hilarious thing I‚Äôve ever heard alkajksakljsal This is like one of those activities aspiring songwriters should do to hone their craft. Now if you‚Äôll excuse me I‚Äôm going to go try and write an Ethel Cain song

**akanewasright** (4.5): maybe I‚Äôll get something out of this one day‚Ä¶ not really today though sorry

**fadedblue09** (4): A very ominous closer to the album‚Ä¶.not sure if it worked though

**ignitethephoenix** (4): this was very sleep

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): wow that was ass

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This reminds me of going on long car trips with my dad and we‚Äôd be driving through the middle of nowhere at night and he would start playing music like this and I‚Äôd start getting scared and my siblings would have to yell at him to play something else.

**Stryxen** (2): edging anthem

**babadork** (1): I‚Äôve usually had enough of this before it reaches minute three.

**a-man-with-a-perm** (0): leave Ian Curtis alone

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Listen I don‚Äôt care what the RYM/Indieheads/Popheads music nerd elites say about this being one of the best albums of all time, this song is straight up boring and bad.

**homestarguy** (0): More like ‚ÄúNo Joy‚Äù Division

**ImADudeDuh** (0): you know how people like In Da Gadda Da Vida but mainly for the chorus and like 2 instrumental solos? This is all of the other stuff in between all of that

**NewWaneLietoc** (0): irrational hate 0 bestowed to the overload. no, no not feeling this droner that ppl be saying "is their attempt at joy division". like yeah ha ha funny track and this is what bands prolly did when music was about ACTUALLY OWNING SHIT TO HEAR AND KNOW AND UNDERSTAND IT. Anyways, this isn't why I listen to the talking heads, and it sorta becomes a chief reason I don't quite go for it. not even hassell's horns and the cool production can make me go awooga mode. sorry chaps.

**bulforster** (9): Aaaand I'm already mad, I can see why people don't like Cindy pushing her voice like this but I love it and it brings so much life to this cover in contrast to the much glossier original. I also really like how they end the album on a much more grounded note after the more out there songs in the middle but still in conversation with it, since this functions almost as the Earth version of There's A Moon's depiction of a queer haven. At least it avoided last place and this matches my ranking of it as the third-best closer.

**shipperondeck** (8): Great song for walking downtown with your homies at night. You will not get beat up. You will sparkle.

---

# Downtown Girls

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is grunge

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): I WNAAA GO DOWNTOWN

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Petula Clark ain‚Äôt got nothin on them!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I don‚Äôt always enjoy the shrieking vocals on this album but when I do‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs a good time.

**camerinian** (8.5): ok I chuckled at this cover, this kinda does slap

**own-photograph-4642** (8.5): The synth sounds like a precursor to Van Halen's Jump.

**bbfan132** (8): fun outro! the vocals can get annoying but i still enjoyed it

**duracell93** (8): I really love the B-52s 60s influences!

**nt96** (8): How far is downtown from the Love Shack?

**Stryxen** (8): their vocal cords were shredded from impersonating imaginary sea creatures, they couldn‚Äôt hit a note to save their life. They had ONE chance to save their legacy, they went into that studio with a crowd chatter sample and a DREAM.

**vayyiqra** (8): I like songs about going downtown and having fun I want to go downtown and have fun

**TiltControls** (7.5): I think I appreciate the camp factor of this more than enjoy the track

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this song just makes me think of this now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrSHcFxDPD8

**MrSwearword** (7): how was this the closer? Surely this could've been sandwiched in the middle.

**pahc** (7): finally a non-camp song. thank GOD

**qazz23** (7): decent cover

**sarcasticsobs** (7): She sounds like Eliza Doolittle on this, I‚Äôm cackling

**1998tweety** (6.5): ended Macklemore

# Uptown Girls

**plastichaxan** (6.5): Anya Taylor-Joy outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I don‚Äôt like this song but the cover is decent

**whoisValensi** (6): Will the Downtown vs. Uptown wars ever end? Or did "Uptown Funk" finish the fight???

**daretheghost** (5): I do not love this interpretation

**homestarguy** (5): Petula Clark, I‚Äôm so sorry sweetie.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): stream the downton abbey theme song instead of this

**pig-serpent** (5): Was I the only person forced to watch Girl Interrupted 3 times in High school?

**starla\_** (4.5): boring

**CrimsonROSET** (4): vegas baby

**fadedblue09** (4): And ending this mess of an album with yet another shriekfest

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): Kind of a downer for them

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): at least they waited til the very end of the album to put the bad song

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): This feels like one of those demos artists tack onto the end of their deluxe albums‚Ä¶ except it‚Äôs, you know, the actual album

**welcome2thejam** (3): Shame they ended the album by boring me enough to leave me open to get jump scared by the Talking Heads scream in the next song

**MassiveThief** (1): Downtown [Unlistenable Version]

**RandomHypnotica** (0): petula clark sweetie... you don't deserve this

**shipperondeck** (8): I actually love the guitar work in this one

**bulforster** (6): The album's only miss for me and forcing Debbie to share the vocal spotlight is its biggest crime (along with a general awkwardness from the lack of any sort of groove to the meandering lyrics that don't really sell the disaffection I think they're going for). You all seem to agree and this song has the dubious honour of being one of only two songs in the rate to never escape day 1.

---

# Know

**AHSWeeknd** (10): invented confusion

**flavasavavandal** (10): so glad the person who decide to let the other members of Blondie harmonise with Debbie was banned from entering the studio after they recorded this travesty

**bbfan132** (9): this is very fun, i like it

**MrSwearword** (9): the drums go motherfucking hard on this song in particular.

**whoisValensi** (9): This has "One Hit Wonder who is Big in Japan" vibes and I cannot elaborate on why.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): me when someone's trying to explain something to me and they ask me if i understand what they're saying

**jsonphile** (8): me when I see exactly where my code is crashing but it seems to crash for no reason whatsoever

**own-photograph-4642** (8): I know (that I don't hate this song) but I don't know (if I can't not like this song)

**pig-serpent** (8): The guitar is the big highlight on this one.

**qazz23** (8): this has a prog feel to it

**slimboyfriend** (8): Ok ok, a little more glam and punky

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): that line about being a ‚Äúdog but not a pet‚Äù followed by a howl was just pure furry energy

**camerinian** (7.5): really loved this instrumental intro, really not crazy about the way that was the best bit of the song

**NewWaneLietoc** (7.5): its just not as yass or slay as go-gos

**seanderlust** (7.5): this title is me at work every day all the time

**homestarguy** (7): This song answers the question ‚ÄúWho is singing lead vocals on this song?‚Äù

**nt96** (7): If you get it, you get it. If you don‚Äôt, you don‚Äôt. If you know, you know and if you don‚Äôt know then I honestly feel bad for you like, I just I cannot explain it, I don't have the vocabulary to sit here and explain it like, either you get the vibe or you don't get the vibe

**TiltControls** (7): But do you know?

**duracell93** (6.6): it‚Äôs a fun song but probably my least favorite from the album

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): fully thought the line was "i'm not your bitch" lmao

**frogaranaman** (6): this would work in Undertale

# Don't Know

**1998tweety** (5.5): Lady Gaga's ability to speak German

**akanewasright** (5.5): this is kinda lazy, but the opening kicks enough ass for me to boost it a little

**babadork** (5.2): All the points are for ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your dog but not your pet‚Äù

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I hate to be misandrist but get the man out of here.

**celladonn** (5): It's nice that they let the guitarist sing one but I don't really like his voice and this is a bit repetitive

**CrimsonROSET** (5): tame impala

**daretheghost** (5): Sorry to Frank Infante.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): A small bump for trying something out there. But I don‚Äôt think Blondie are good at all at experimental music, many post-punk bands were going for bigger swings with better precision.

**Stryxen** (5): forgot to rate this on first listen and i see why, it‚Äôs pretty forgettable, but it‚Äôs still pleasant

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Who invited Greg Universe

**starla\_** (4.5): I'm starting to be bored by this album

**ImADudeDuh** (4): so many words and none of them said anything

**vayyiqra** (4): Something about this is kind of weird and doesn't work and it's not just the backing vocals (which are bad). The whole way this song is constructed and its melody are just off somehow. The only song I would ever skip on the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): this is kinda bad?? the singing is so monotonous and these lyrics are so amateur. i definitely don‚Äôt remember the deep tracks on this album being so forgettable

**fadedblue09** (3): I guess lyrics were just not important for this genre

**MassiveThief** (3): just weird and offputting, guitar riff is cool but not a fan of the vocals

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): why is this here

**bulforster** (9.5): A pretty strange ode to Brooke Shields that for some reason I really enjoy. I think the constant instrumental switchups matching Debbie's (and the backing vocals) theatrical and varied delivery keep me engaged and alongside the somewhat fantastical lyrics, give the song a mystique and almost an air of tragedy to me at some points. I wouldn't have predicted this for the bottom five before the rate but reading your comments made me realise the off-putting elements so I do at least understand this placement.

**shipperondeck** (4): Terrible backstory aside, the Christmas-like chorus singing the title does not do anything for me

---

# Brooke Shields fans

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I love it whenever they say the titular line, the delivery is perfect.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ‚ÄúPretty baby, you look so heavenly‚Äù my mom lying to my ugly ass after I came out of the womb.

**vayyiqra** (10): Feels like one of the most retro songs on the album. Me, who barely listens to 50s music: getting kind of a 50s vibe from this

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This sounds so magical to me

**bbfan132** (9.5): i feel like every song on this album could‚Äôve been a single

**frogaranaman** (8): guitar riff was referenced in Nathaniel Ratliff & The Night Sweats' "I Need Never Get Old", I think (this greatly improves my enjoyment of both songs)

**homestarguy** (8): Those 50‚Äôs harmonies are so divine, even if it‚Äôs not the best on the album.

**MrSwearword** (8): I almost said a seven but remembered that the production is indeed worth the listen.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): i'm slightly conflicted about this, cause on one hand it sounds lovely but on the other hand it's about a twelve year old girl and that concerns me

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Yass girl, practice your poetry! The song itself sounds throwback to me, and it‚Äôs a good touch.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this is so corny and lame and yet i can‚Äôt help but love it

**1998tweety** (7): can't relate

**CrimsonROSET** (7): do the 60s soul rate

**welcome2thejam** (7): Hey you dropped a smidge of your Brill building in my new wave

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I like the riff in the beginning, wish that was more prominent throughout the song

**starla\_** (6.5): very like, 50s pastiche? Idk reminds me of Grease

# Child free

**NewWaneLietoc** (6.4): yeah sure I think the go-gos did this better. more yassing and slaying there :/

**daretheghost** (6): Points for Blondie weirdness but it doesn‚Äôt do a whole lot for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): if you like this song, I recommend you do not read the genius annotations for it

**bigbigbee** (5): It‚Äôs interesting to me how elements of what I associate with 60s pop/soul music crops up in this album (even though it‚Äôs clearly a modernized take on it). It‚Äôs funny to watch the nostalgia cycle play out in past works. Would I like this more if someone told me it came out in 1962? Who knows.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Starts strong but kinda becomes a slog halfway through, which is strange given that it‚Äôs one of the shorter songs in the rate.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): sorry if this is camp it's just too cutesy for me

**whoisValensi** (4.5): Sorry title of the song got my mind thinking of things and stuff... ANYWAYS CAN SOMEONE JUST TELL ME TO GET OFF MY ASS AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO "BEST DAY EVER" FROM 'POLLINATOR' ALREADY?!?!?! I KNOW IT'S GONNA PROBABLY SUCK BUT BLAME SIA DON'T BLAME MY MAN. Anyways title yeah mood, song itself, not as much.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): I find the chorus very annoying and structure-wise this song feels like a meandering mess

**Stryxen** (0): this starts so promising and then i absolutely HATE the chorus

**shipperondeck** (8.2): How many of yall thought the song ended when they paused for a REALLY long time

**bulforster** (5.5): And with that no one escapes the bottom 5! I definitely agree with our first Go-Go's song to be eliminated, unfortunately the one slow burner of this album proves that their strengths lie elsewhere so this song joining I Know But I Don't Know as the only songs to never leave day 1 is unsurprising.

---

# Automatically in love

**AHSWeeknd** (10): whoever was on the lead guitar snapped

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): KMFDM did that guitar stretchy thing with pedal steel about 13 years later and GOD DO I LOVE IT

**plastichaxan** (10): they can even do music too this is so unfair

**seanderlust** (9.2): i love that hypnotic arpeggiated guitar

**bbfan132** (9): i like the moodier/more contemplative sound here

**starla\_** (9): I can't drive

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): gonna payola the hosts to play Automatic by The Pointer Sisters as an interlude

**frogaranaman** (8): me when people ask me how I edited my scrobbles so quick

**pahc** (8): Time STOP!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Great timing for a change of pace

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended EXO

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Elon Musk when you ask him why his self driving cars keep hitting people.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I know it‚Äôs a cliche to have a song stop on the word ‚Äústop‚Äù but ngl it kinda gagged me here

**2dina3dworld** (7): this sounds like a yassified Pink Panther theme

**fadedblue09** (7): A bit left-field within the album, but I appreciate the buildup

**MrSwearword** (7): slow burn isn't anyone's speed on manual or...automatic.

# Manual drivers

**homestarguy** (6.5): Kind of a cool change of sound but this song doesn‚Äôt really do too much for me.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): utada hikaru interlude incoming i just know it

**qazz23** (6): kind of drags at this point

**vayyiqra** (6): no thoughts head empty

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): :/

**nt96** (5): Utada outsold sorry girls

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i commend them for trying something different but unfortunately this is also kinda bad

**camerinian** (4): I know the lines between post-punk and new wave weren't huge in the early 80s, but surely someone in the band must have pointed out that this dirge is not using their skills properly

**Stryxen** (4): yeah it‚Äôs okay, a little too unyassified for this slalbum (slay album) so i‚Äôm rating it a bit harsh

**whoisValensi** (4): Hmmmmm yeah not really feeling this one. While it has some interesting ideas for sure, for me it really goes just nowhere.

**whoisValensi** (10): donotcallmeoutlikethisb52siveknownyoufor5minutesandyouhavetheconnectionsandallbutdontdothistomepls

**own-photograph-4642** (9.5): Probably the third best song of the 70s that's named Hero.

**homestarguy** (9): Cindy sounds so delightfully unhinged on this one, I love it.

**qazz23** (9): really good vocals, love the scream towards the end

**xxipil0ts** (8.7): wait this song is such a bop wtf

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This one has got a great groove to it, and actually feels like it has a compelling through line of energy (unlike some other B-52‚Äôs songs, which kinda stagnate). One of the standouts.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The B-52‚Äôs version of One Way Or Another

**flavasavavandal** (8): invented screaming vocals

**MrSwearword** (8): the vocal delivery on here is lively but nothing says "I will snatch you".

**nt96** (8): suddenly my throat hurts

**welcome2thejam** (8): Saw a couple of youtube comments saying like "delicious screams" my man she's definitely not gonna Hero Worship you talking creepy like that

**seanderlust** (7): oh this is kind of h-word isn't it

**Stryxen** (7): me mindlessly 10-ing the gogos

# Avoid their heroes

**bigbigbee** (6.5): She sounds like me trying to do a Christopher Walken impression on this song

**1998tweety** (6): Deku to All Might

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Damn shawty okay.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i don‚Äôt want to assume everything in this album is horny but ‚Äòi was on my knees and took out his belt and worshiped the hero‚Äô paints a very vivid picture

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Okay ma‚Äôam

**starla\_** (5.5): cute bop

**DaHumanTorch** (5.3): girlie sounding like a beverly hills chihuahua extra at the end

**ImADudeDuh** (5): they‚Äôre just yellin‚Äô

**Roxieloxie** (5): why did she just scream

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): not really sure how i feel about this one‚Ä¶i think the screaming is a little too much

**vayyiqra** (5): This song is weird because we listen to the B-52s for wacky songs about lava and stuff, and this song seems to be about watching a guy die, so I don't get it

**camerinian** (4): this song left my memory the second it finished

**fadedblue09** (4): has a relatively polished instrumental but wtf is happening with the vocals in the end. She sounds like she's being pinched

**pig-serpent** (3): Is she trying to be the most annoying singer of all time because if so she‚Äôs succeeding.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): these may be the worse vocals I‚Äôve heard in a song ever

**bulforster** (9): Ricky's guitar is definitely the highlight of this track for me. I'm kind of suprised how turned off by Cindy and Kate's voices a lot of you were (especially when this is a somewhat subdued performance from them lol). This got a 0 fairly early on and never recovered, I'm not too torn up though since I do agree this is one of the slightly lesser tracks on the album.

**shipperondeck** (8.7): "But they don't even list 52 girls" after listing the girls they say these are the girls of the USA. Clearly there are other girls around the world that they just didn't have time to get to, ok?

---

# Can name every girl

**2dina3dworld** (10): one girl for every state is what I‚Äôm getting here

**bbfan132** (10): god this is perfect, i love kate‚Äôs voice so so much and the riff is great as well

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): mlg

**qazz23** (10): love the surf rock vibe even if there aren't quite 52

**welcome2thejam** (10): Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo no. 52

**homestarguy** (9): Naming a girl? Is that possible as as user of reddit dot com??

**krusso1105** (9): I don't know why I like this

**nt96** (9): they forgot about Britney, shame on them

**Stryxen** (9): me describing wjsn

**vayyiqra** (9): The guy who noted in the Genius comments why this song doesn't name the other 28 girls was so right. Why won't the B-52s release the data? What are they trying to hide? anyway a bop

**own-photograph-4642** (8.5): That's far too many girls.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I‚Äôm obsessed with the fact that they just made a song that‚Äôs just a bunch of

**starla\_** (8.5): that's a lot of girls

**AHSWeeknd** (8): for a dollar, name a woman.

**MrSwearword** (8): the guitar is sick, but I'm not quite snatched as I would like to be.

**pahc** (8): only 24 girls noted gonna deduct half a point unfortunately

**bigbigbee** (7): Ironically, this is hurt in my mind by being one of the less weird B52s songs

**daretheghost** (7): only 24 girls named

**flavasavavandal** (7): it‚Äôs pretty camp of this band to try and make us think they have 52 girls when I only see 2 girls on the album cover

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i feel lied to, they only named 24 girls in this song

**whoisValensi** (7): And they didn't even name 52 girls. I'm disappointed. (They only name 24.)

**ImADudeDuh** (6.9): i just know someone‚Äôs gonna count the girl names in this song so I will just comment to look at their comment

# Misogynists

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): i need 52 bad bitches acting like they single

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): why are you so proud of being from the USA

**seanderlust** (6.1): well that's just too many girls

**akanewasright** (6): that‚Äôs a lot of girls

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): oh you like women? name three of them

**MassiveThief** (6): this song is just "oh you like girls? name every woman ever"

**pig-serpent** (6): Nice dancing energy but nothing about this song stands out in any way.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): i was busy thinking bout girls

**Roxieloxie** (6): jimmy neutron theme song music

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I just wanna know what possessed them to write a song like this

**babadork** (5.5): I do think it‚Äôs missing a little pizzazz for a song that might be about pornographic decks of cards.

**celladonn** (5): I'm waiting on the names of the other 28 girls

**TiltControls** (4): I was promised 52 and now I feel cheated out of like 30 more names

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I think it‚Äôs actually only two girls.

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Decent but gets stale at some point (Edit: Nvm this is actually annoying)

**CrimsonROSET** (0): if my name was on this list calling me a b52 girl i‚Äôd sue

**static\_int\_husp** (0): so one problem I definitely have with the B-52s, this rate is showing me, is that I hate the female voice a lot more than the male voice in the band. And this song really showcases the register I don't like

**bulforster** (10): I like how musically this is just such a straightforwardly upbeat bop while the hint of a growl in Debbie's voice and maintaining the genders of the original Buddy Holly lyrics makes this feel like One Way or Another's lighter sister to me.

**shipperondeck** (8.9): Points up for that little scream thing bc same girl! Wow I love new wave!

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the way the world has come full circle into having more 2 minute 10 second songs

**MrSwearword** (10): sarcastic, frenetic Blondie is exceptional Blondie, period.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): We love consensuality!

**qazz23** (9): good cover

**slimboyfriend** (9): I love this song but lol at it being the lead single in the US and failing to chart

**homestarguy** (8.5): Get in, bop a little bit, then get out!

**bbfan132** (8): short and sweet

**camerinian** (8): absolutely steaming that we‚Äôre not rating Devo here. Nothing to do with this song, I just remembered it‚Äôs not here and I‚Äôm livid.

**vayyiqra** (8): Arguably too many "ah"s but otherwise a good song

**babadork** (7.5): At one point, I was going to give this a 10. I guess all I need is for someone to cover my favorite Buddy Holly song, and I‚Äôll just throw all the points at them.

**MassiveThief** (7.5): love everything except the AH AH AH AH AH's

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this has a weird children show vibe??? I cant quite explain it

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

**pig-serpent** (7): I love clapping along to the staccato words at the end of each line. They‚Äôre a fun choice that is also incredibly annoying (not to mention the ah ah ah ah bridge). I think this would make for a fantastic children‚Äôs song and think in the long run this song could be insufferable, but right now I haven‚Äôt been able to make myself hate it so I think it‚Äôs good overall.

**whoisValensi** (7): Loved themselves right into a short as could be song... It was good but it could have used a lil more to it.

**daretheghost** (6): Honestly a little annoying but Debbie Harry‚Äôs brattiness is sort of endearing.

**fadedblue09** (6): not awful, but obviously filler

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Ugh, I hate what the streaming has done to music, everyone is dropping songs TikTok bait songs that sound like nursery rhymes and barely crack the two minute mark.

**NewWaneLietoc** (6): sounds like an arby's jingle

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ehhh a tad too obnoxious

**starla\_** (5.5): ok

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this song is hanging on for dear life cuz the guitarist rules. The chanting throughout the song however don‚Äôt work for me. Not a poppy album cut from them I care for

**welcome2thejam** (5): Ooh, I am not jiving with this hook

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): girl what is this‚Ä¶this sounds like that one song they used in spongebob that was just a really annoying loop of people laughing

**flavasavavandal** (0): this wouldn‚Äôt even be that bad of a score in normal circumstance, but coming right after Heart of Glass is such a tragic choice i can‚Äôt help but bully this song

# weezer

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9.9): oo wee oo i sound just like buddy holly

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): outsold weezer

**2dina3dworld** (7.6): wee woo I look just like Buddy Holly

**bulforster** (10): Okay yes, ending your album by telling your audience quite emphatically to leave could be seen as a weird choice but Debbie's delivery once again completely sells the song to me. With this the popheads ranking of these album closers also ends up completely matching mine, good job guys!

**shipperondeck** (7.1): Chorus gives sesame street vibes... sorry I don't know how to comment like a host

# Will do anything for Debbie

**AHSWeeknd** (10): anti-colonization anthem

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me wishing [redacted] on every godawful politician in this country.

**nt96** (10): me listening to your average Pophead

**Stryxen** (10): i 10d this on first listen. not entirely sure why but i‚Äôll keep it it‚Äôs great. GyOW AWEIGH

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Okay they went off with this one, you‚Äôre so right queen I WILL leave

**homestarguy** (9): What I am not saying to Debbie and co. after finishing this album.

**MrSwearword** (9): if only because the closing track literally tells you to just go away LMAO.

**bbfan132** (8.5): nice closing track! it works well as an outro to the album

**jsonphile** (8.5): me to Tucker Carlson every time he‚Äôs trending for saying something stupid

**whoisValensi** (8.5): Using pre-fab as an insult brings a tear to my eye, that's beautiful. Great closer tbh.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): love that blondie basically ends their record by telling us to fuck off

**CrimsonROSET** (8): rhyming legends

**daretheghost** (8): Do you think when Debbie wrote ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lose your medicaid cool‚Äù that some 40-plus years later American healthcare would still be an embarrassment?

**duracell93** (8): is it just me or does the backing vocals sometimes sound like muppets? Fun!

**plastichaxan** (8): i yassed what can i say

**qazz23** (8): some cool backing vocals

**slimboyfriend** (8): I think the album could‚Äôve ended with the last song, but this is cool too.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Fun backup vocals on the "Go Away!" part, sounds like she's getting backed up by the Muppets

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): this reminds me of fleetwood mac

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): a fine song but definitely a weak note to end the album on

**frogaranaman** (7): okay I will

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): Yes, flip on him!

# Were leaving anyway

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): that‚Äôs one way to title the closer to your album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): well that‚Äôs an underwhelming closer

**ImADudeDuh** (6): me when [redacted]

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I mean shit okay

**1998tweety** (5.5): the popular girls when I walk by them in the hall

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Forgettable, very underwhelming for a final track

**starla\_** (5.5): I'm ready for this album to Just Go Away

**pig-serpent** (5): Mean spirited and annoying with funny muppet voices, but it still slaps, so that‚Äôs an accomplishment.

**vayyiqra** (5): Not to be a basic misandrist Pophead but the members of Blondie who are not Debbie Harry should not sing because they aren't good at it and it almost ruins the song. Kind of a weak closer to a good album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): the feeling is mutual you stale blondie bars

**camerinian** (2.5): no it‚Äôs fine it‚Äôs not like your presence ruins the entire stellar run that side two of this album had, it‚Äôs fool cool you can be here

**MassiveThief** (2.5): the guitar riff that plays throughout is nails-on-chalkboard level annoying

**seanderlust** (0): i'm sorry these are some of the worst lyrics in the rate

**shipperondeck** (8.7): Love Blondie but sorry, you will never be Roxy Music.

**bulforster** (8.5): And following The Overload and Automatic, Blondie's slow burner falls. This is the closest thing to a ballad in the rate so I suppose balladphobia has to manifest somewhere, even though I appreciate the change of pace this song adds to Parallel Lines.

---

# Dreams on the screen

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this is how you do a damn rock ballad. Is it a rock ballad? I‚Äôm not sure, let‚Äôs just call it a new-wave ballad.

**bbfan132** (10): i love the atmosphere here, it‚Äôs a different sound for them in a good way

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wait the vibes in this‚Ä¶ perhaps i like this

**flavasavavandal** (10): ugh slow-burn vibe that ends with a tinge of reggae, how did you know this is what I needed Blondie

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Really cool song, something so hypnotic about it. It just melts my brain.

**qazz23** (10): a good deep cut - love the dreamy, haunting feel of this

**seanderlust** (10): i am discovering in this rate that i really love debbie harry's lyricism

**1998tweety** (9.5): ascending a bit

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Damn, these are some gorgeous vocals. Wasn't expecting much considering how terrible they were in One Way or Another

**celladonn** (9): I really like the hazy analog imagery of this

**daretheghost** (9): I‚Äôve always loved this song idc idc

**vayyiqra** (9): Hope this isn't robbed just because it's slow (it will be)

**2dina3dworld** (8): can‚Äôt wait to see this tank so I can comment ‚Äúpopheads hate experimental music!‚Äù like that hypothesis hasn‚Äôt been proven wrong several times

**homestarguy** (8): Pretty crazy Blondie foretold Katy Perry‚Äôs career with this one.

**MrSwearword** (8): cute, really cute but the magic does take almost a minute and twenty seconds to kick in.

**slimboyfriend** (8): This is like some kind of late 50s homage in the late 70s

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ahh that guitar solo‚Ä¶so deliciously crunchy

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Creepy AND pretty

**welcome2thejam** (8): I was gonna ask why the intro was haunted house music, but if the song's about wasting away watching television it's actually clever to use music that sounds like the soundtracks of those black & white monster movies

**frogaranaman** (7): what in the Half Life

**NewWaneLietoc** (7): yeah okay i'll be yr dream

# Grass touchers

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): wow what a buzzkill

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): has some cute melodies but not all that interesting

**MassiveThief** (5): kinda torn, there are good parts but I'm not a fan of their slower songs. the weird spacey intro with just drums isn't it

**pig-serpent** (5): There are some cool sounds here but sadly I‚Äôm balladphobic.

**Roxieloxie** (5): ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ( i accidentally left my deodorant on the keyboard for 30 seconds and i just looked up and saw this here but its camp so im gonna leave it as my comment)

**starla\_** (5): meh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): ‚ÄúI love all my Parallel Lines songs equally‚Äù one day later ‚ÄùI don‚Äôt really care for Fade Away and Radiate.‚Äù

**freav** (4): nah sorry debbie

**whoisValensi** (4): While this song is interesting sonically, what the fuck is going on with Debbie's voice??????

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): They must love this lyric because it‚Äôs referenced again in a Blondie song I actually love, ‚ÄúDreaming‚Äù. That does not work here. I‚Äôm bumping up the score (not by much, sob) because the guitarist is doing great. The reggae groove towards the end has my Jamaican ass cackling laughing, would rather be listening to an early Police album lmao

**Stryxen** (3): the intro is weird in a bad way and it doesn‚Äôt get good at all until the very last minute at the outro

# Having a very nice time

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the story of trying to get rid of a creepy guy, love it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): like the interplay of the two vocalists

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): yup uh huh

**nt96** (10): Try 867-5309

**qazz23** (10): Jenny, I got your number! oh wait...

**homestarguy** (9.5): Hehehe, more like 6969-420 hehehe

**akanewasright** (9): the way everything in this song besides the barebones plot is now incredibly dated. Like‚Ä¶ the lack of cell phones??? Talking to an operator??? Dimes being useful??? It‚Äôs like this song was made in the 70s or something‚Ä¶

**bbfan132** (9): this is super fun, i want this record on vinyl

**fadedblue09** (9): The most straightforward song here, I quite enjoyed this. Lemme give them charity points ig

**RandomHypnotica** (9): doxing is never cool

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Ended Jenny with ease.

**MrSwearword** (8): it's cute, but Tommy Tutone will always beat you with a phone number song.

**Stryxen** (8): the title on spotify (maybe other places) is ‚Äú6060-842 (6060 842)‚Äù which ties this for funniest title in the rate with ‚ÄúThere's A Moon In The Sky (Called The Moon)‚Äù for me

**whoisValensi** (8): When I call from the number 867-5309, then what.

**babadork** (7.7): I feel like thematically this is an album that needs a song that heavily features bongos, but I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm that into the bongos.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): outsold that flop jenny

**frogaranaman** (7): this is how they doxxed people in 1979

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I enjoy the more story driven aspect to this one, which I kinda wish they‚Äôd taken further. Like I wanted a full on conversation in there lol that would have been cute.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): tbh if you try to call a random person‚Äôs number you see written on a wall you deserve to be embarrassed like this

**TiltControls** (7): 5218

**vayyiqra** (7): This is the better song about a phone number being disconnected out of the two that we have rated so far this year ("Don't Call Me" by Shinee was the other)

**welcome2thejam** (7): I cheered the bongo use

# Disconnected

**ImADudeDuh** (6.7): this is a song about a girl who wanted some phone sex but the graffiti was so old that the number was disconnected

**cremeebrulee** (6.4): 877 393 4448

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (6): is this that logic song?

**flavasavavandal** (6): you can only give one song in a rate a 0, silly B-52‚Äôs

**Roxieloxie** (5): they want to be soulja boy so bad

**starla\_** (5): who can relate? WOO!

**CrimsonROSET** (4): is phone sex that hard to find

**pig-serpent** (4): How did the B-52s get my phone number and why are they telling everyone to call it for a good time?

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This song‚Äôs storyline is so badly written. She finds a sexy number and tries to call but it‚Äôs disconnected? Where are the stakes? The drama? The satisfying ending? The story that plays out in this track takes less time than the actual track!

**bulforster** (11): B-52's my poor meow meows I'm so sorry for putting you through this. This is one of my favourite songs ever and it couldn't even crack day 2? I love how this is the song on the album that most lets all three vocalists shine as opposed to the girls playing a more supporting role to Fred on a lot of the others. Cindy especially sells the desperation that sets this song apart emotionally on the album while her and Fred's back and forth brings its trademark unbridled fun. This was the most controversial song in the rate for about half of the ballots thanks to my 11 and the two 0s until The Overload overtook it. Before the extensions it looked poised to break into day 2 but the scores in this section of the rate were very bunched together and twas not to be. Ultimately I'm so happy to see this get other 11s (joint most outside of day 3!) and comments that get it, even if I do understand those that don't.

# Limber girls

**DefaultPophead** (11): Thank you, Discord.

**duracell93** (11): I am truly obsessed with this song! The Stop in the Name of Love interpolation! The vocal deliver of the chorus! Everything!

**bbfan132** (10): i love the back and forth between the man/woman here - their music is so zany and fun

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Rock Lobster is camp but this is straight-up great, searing and weird post-punk. Those twinkling effects, and then Cindy Wilson just being a total force on the vocals. Unrestrained and passionate, it‚Äôs so refreshing to hear this looseness and passion. And Fred‚Äôs backing vocals are hilarious (affectionate), and then naming all the different dance moves just works. It feels like the strangest party music of all time (compliment). And the punchy SHAKE! just slappin me in the face yasss

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): yes so true

**own-photograph-4642** (10): üéµ Oh say, why don't you dance with me? üéµ

**plastichaxan** (10): i do dance this mess around they‚Äôre so right

**qazz23** (10): you can do 16 dances to this

**slimboyfriend** (10): A perfect lip sync song

**welcome2thejam** (10): Vocals turn this into an absolute delight to listen to, hits that perfect note between funny and sadly desperate

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I bet this RIPS live

**babadork** (9.2): I want to be invited to this party and learn the Shy Tuna and Hip O Crit.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Yeah okay I can strut to this, their style is working here.

**MrSwearword** (9): the energy is great but no full marks because it feels slightly and I mean ever so slightly laborious.

**seanderlust** (8.2): some of these songs sound like they were written for an episode of bob's burgers. i can fully see tina saying "i'm not no limburger, just a limber girl"

**2dina3dworld** (8): the B-52s said ‚ÄúSTAN THE SUPREMES‚Äù

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Why‚Äôs she yelling at me omg

**akanewasright** (8): all 16 dances??? Damn, that‚Äôs ambitious

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this reminds me of those songs we‚Äôd sing for sunday school that have really dumb dance moves and the kids keep repeating them to you in any social event and make you feel awkward because the adults are now just staring like ‚Äòwtf is the twisty twist‚Äô

**frogaranaman** (8): outro is a predecessor to Kendrick Lamar's "We Cry Together"

**homestarguy** (8): Those freaking zoomers on TikTok better take notes during this one!!!!

**Stryxen** (8): idk what the fuck they are saying but girl i am living

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): chaotic good

**vayyiqra** (8): Why don't you dance with ME ?! :kimbryell:

**pahc** (7.5): peak camp actually

**daretheghost** (7): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not no Limburger / Just a limber girl‚Äù

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Okay so first they claim there are 52 girls but can only name 25 of them, now they say there are 16 dances but they only mention 8? I‚Äôm starting to think no one in the B-52‚Äôs can count

**1998tweety** (6): ended TWICE

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this started good but then went downhill

**whoisValensi** (5.5): This is a very strange one huh. DAMNIT THEY DON'T EVEN NAME 16 DANCES!!!!!

**starla\_** (5): this is ok but the riff is so similar to Rock Lobster it just makes me want to listen to Rock Lobster instead

**static\_int\_husp** (5): there is one point when the lyrics are kinda screamed in this where it gets to an ear splitting register so I'm not a huge fan

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3.5): ‚Ä¶..this went on for a long time.

**camerinian** (3): Thought this would be a lot better by the time the groove kicked in, but the singers decided that was also the time to get very annoying so uhhhh

**Roxieloxie** (3): Do you think when this dropped it was like hyperpop but 80s, like just sitting there listening to the weirdest shit you've ever heard

**pig-serpent** (2): WHAT ARE THE OTHER 8 DANCES THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!?

**fadedblue09** (1): From those beep-beep effects, the shrieking vocals and the aimless noises towards the end, this was indeed‚Ä¶ quite a mess

**MassiveThief** (0): i'm fine with never hearing this again

**bulforster** (9.5): The most wholesome song on the album and was catnip for my gay, space-obsessed child self. This flitted back and forth between days 1 and 2 for most of the rate and unfortunately was knocked down into today by the very last ballot.

**shipperondeck** (8.5): As someone who pays attention to song titles, the B-52s certainly take the crown in this rate in that regard. They're the winners in my heart.

**2dina3dworld** (10): there‚Äôs a good song in here called There‚Äôs A Moon In the Sky (Called The Moon) and it‚Äôs a good song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When the moon hits your eye like a big lobster pie, that‚Äôs a-New Wave!

**frogaranaman** (10): people keep asking for camp in music when it's literally been right here this whole time???

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): its about a queer haven that's so sweet.

**Stryxen** (10): source?

**whoisValensi** (10): My brain saw moon and it zoomed, my brain heard the song it zoomed.

**own-photograph-4642** (9.5): I didn't know the gray circle in the sky had a name, thanks B-52s.

**seanderlust** (9.5): fuck yeah buddy there sure is!

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Saturn‚Äôs the popular planet ofc

**akanewasright** (9): tbh us calling our moon just ‚Äúthe moon‚Äù when other planets have moons named ‚ÄúIo‚Äù or ‚ÄúEuropa‚Äù feels a bit like naming a dog ‚Äúdog‚Äù when you think about it‚Ä¶

**bbfan132** (9): every song on here could be a single‚Ä¶ i said this for parallel lines, and it‚Äôs true here as well

**celladonn** (9): it's silly but it's also so joyous and affirming

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song is actually just a bunch of words strung together but they‚Äôre words that I find appealing so it‚Äôs a serve actually

**nt96** (9): Pluto you will always be a planet in my heart, screw you NASA

**plastichaxan** (9): minds of masterminds

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): space exploration BOP!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I like this weird-ass thing more than I thought I would

**jsonphile** (8): well they‚Äôre not wrong

**qazz23** (8): whoa I never knew that! // love the synthy bit at the end

**sarcasticsobs** (8): I can‚Äôt stop laughing at the title and how its really the first line, breaking my brain

**homestarguy** (7.5): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kKFjkBtcg8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkM1k5aWPIg)

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): it is at this point that I am beginning to accept that I have no idea what is going on in this album

**flavasavavandal** (7): a song made for me at 9 years old when I was obsessed with space and the solar system

**MrSwearword** (7): a bit too many cooks for the level of weirdness I thought was needed.

**vayyiqra** (7): \[Small Shiba Inu dog\] "There's a moon in the sky" \[Muscular Shiba Inu dog\] "There is WATER at the bottom of the OCEAN"

**welcome2thejam** (7): Want to think the B-52s picked up a copy of National Geographic, picked the first three articles, and just riffed for three straight songs about the oceans, volcanos, and space respectively

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): there‚Äôs a score for this song (it‚Äôs a 6.7)

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Gets points for awakening my inner astronomy nerd‚Ä¶.I guess

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): most unintentionally funny song title of all time

**camerinian** (6): maybe some of us should just stay away from whistle tones

**bigbigbee** (5.5): That tweet that was like ‚ÄúI thought that Girls Like You by Maroon 5 was a statement‚Äù, but for real this time

**starla\_** (5.5): queer anthem

**TiltControls** (5.5): True facts, presented by the B-52's

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this song is camp but also not good at the same time

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the song peaks at the title because that is camp af

**CrimsonROSET** (4): a moon shaped moon called moon

**Roxieloxie** (4): the more this album goes on the more i know bul/rina are regretting letting me have this extension

**pig-serpent** (3): There‚Äôs a Song on this Album (And It‚Äôs Bad)

**DirtyRat583** (1.5): these lyrics are terrible (which is a lot coming from an ava max stan)

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is Talking Head‚Äôs fitter happier

**AHSWeeknd** (10): David Byrne‚Äôs talking voice is calming, I don‚Äôt know why though

**bbfan132** (10): the band is supremely talented and david‚Äôs delivery is excellent as well - i love how he can be quirky while still giving us hooks and beautiful melodies

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (10): mommy what is the scary man talking about

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Weird Talking Heads is where it‚Äôs at for me idk. I like songs that feel a bit unsettling and have a good interplay of tension.

**frogaranaman** (10): David Byrne could make the iPhone alarm tone but Steve Jobs couldn't make Remain In Light

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The best song on the album is also the shortest one? Maybe the streaming era made some points‚Ä¶

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): aching shit. we all wonder too if we made that similar mistake :,)

**nt96** (10): me playing as Sombra on Overwatch

**Stryxen** (10): he sounds so whiny and pathetic. I love it!

**TiltControls** (10): Feels a bit like listening to an audiobook at times, but something about this I really enjoy

**whoisValensi** (10): I feel called out once more. Make that 2 times in this rate I have felt called out. As someone who's struggled back and forth w/ their identity and appearance and how I am perceived oof owie stop calling me out. I'm thankful to have been able to pull together some parts of my identity but some parts still feel like a mystery to me. Like I know myself to me but not how others perceive me and if I match together in their mind. It can all be a big mind fuck but it is what it is I suppose.

**own-photograph-4642** (9.5): Quite an underrated Talking Heads song, it's more like Genius of Love's seedy counterpart.

**starla\_** (9.5): the hand claps! the funky guitar!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): pretty weird even for this album but i do love the spoken word

**celladonn** (9): this spoken word slay

**qazz23** (9): the background vocalists really make this, good rhythm section too

**fadedblue09** (8.5): This is almost spoken-word, but I love the layers of sound here

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): bro literally tried to manifest a new face, i appreciate the hustle

**vayyiqra** (8): The lyrics to this song fascinate me because they're so bizarre (and also make me think of body dysmorphic disorder even though I don't think it was intended). Most of the lyrics on this album are cryptic but this one is especially hard to understand

**welcome2thejam** (8): Interrupting the groove sesh for a spoken word poetry sesh

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): I want more vocal fun for how much I enjoyed the musicality here

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): It feels like an interlude stretched out into the length of a full song, but I love the lyrics and listening to it makes me feel like I‚Äôm in an intergalactic rainforest

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): in my headcanon David Byrne is reciting the FitnessGramPacerTest copypadta

**camerinian** (7): Is‚Ä¶ is this the blueprint for Genius of Love?

**MrSwearword** (7): I guess the flatness of the vocal delivery makes sense for this song. It is giving "trying to read a report in front of the class slowly so you fill time successfully".

**pig-serpent** (7): Reminds me a lot of sanctimonious songs about Africa, only good.

**seanderlust** (7): @ whoever commented on genius "this song hits different if you hate yourself" uhhh....would you like to talk about anything, buddy?
