New Wave Giants Rate Reveal Day 2: Born Under Punches (The Reveal Goes On)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/wtakii/new_wave_giants_rate_reveal_day_2_born_under/

Hello and welcome back to the New Wave Giants rate reveal featuring Blondie's Parallel Lines, The B-52's self-titled debut, Talking Heads' Remain in Light and The Go-Go's Beauty and the Beat!

Yesterday popheads proved (unsurprisingly) they don't actually know what camp means and massacred the B-52's but kept some in the tank to off half of Parallel Lines as well. Will the B-52's even make it to day 3? Will side B of Remain in Light become the next target? Are The Go-Go's even in the rate? Find out **starting at 1PM EST** (about an hour from when this is posted) when we'll be revealing **#26-#14** of the rate!

**Join the [Queup room](https://www.queup.net/join/the-moon-in-the-sky-called-the-moon)** to watch the song reveals in real time along with intermissions and shitposts!

**Keep this thread open as well** as we reveal your scores and comments for the songs as well as rank graphs and banners!

**shipperondeck** (6.8): I think I have heard this at a record store before. Pretty cool of said record store.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): still wondering if anything will happen

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): You know it’s a great album when you keep thinking “Wait this wasn’t a single??” song after song.

**whoisValensi** (10): This riff is gonna buzz around my head all day tomorrow/today at work (It's a Monday btw, I don't have work like tomorrow [read: Tuesday] but also my internal clock is so fucky that my brain has decided that Monday [today] is also still tomorrow lol, I've always done this...)

**daretheghost** (9.5): I always liked the urgency in this song.

**homestarguy** (9): Those “will I see you again” harmonies some of the best three seconds on the record.

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a good example of how this album invented pop-punk [citation needed]

**welcome2thejam** (9): Enjoy a return to a nice harder rock sound than the last few tracks

**camerinian** (8.5): get me into CBGBs with this track on the setlist and I fear I may start throwing elbows

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): idk ask ellie goulding

**bbfan132** (8): that riff is awesome, i like the surf-y feel of this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): THE FIRST ALBUM CUT I LIKED JESUS. This was much tighter and a simpler song structure that does them wonderrs

**MrSwearword** (8): the frenetic energy of this one is almost mismatched with the lyrics, but I've never been that mad about it.

**plastichaxan** (8): will it

**fadedblue09** (7.5): it's fine, very proto-pop punk even if it's not super impressive

**2dina3dworld** (7): I genuinely thought this was gonna segue into the “WOOOOOAAAAAAH OH OH OH UHHHHH” Tik tok sound at the start

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this song has big puts fingers together energy

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Me when I’ve been listening to “Rock Lobster” for four minutes and the song is still going

**NewWaneLietoc** (7): what happened during this song

**ImADudeDuh** (6): when song titles set themselves up to be dragged, you can’t help but laugh

**seanderlust** (6): me watching a baseball game

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): me listening to this song waiting for it to get interesting

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This songwriting seems kinda lazy

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I found the filler

**starla\_** (4.5): Will Anything Happen to make this album more interesting?

**Stryxen** (4): i would really like this song but the do-do-do-do-do-do- guitar parts every other line are really frustratingly underwhelming and ruin it for me

**bulforster** (8): Towards the end of the rate there were about five songs vying for the last two spots, a bit disappointed this managed to take one but it's still one of the many great bops on this album.

**shipperondeck** (6): This one's just okay, and outdone in title by There's A Moon In The Sky (Called The Moon)

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): spilled

**frogaranaman** (10): this title is so true, I really can't walk in my sleep if I can't sleep

**MrSwearword** (10): now we're back back back back again to the frenetic polish, yay.

**Roxieloxie** (10): love this

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9.2): You cant walk in your sleep if you cant sleep? Whats next? Water at the bottom of the ocean?

**flavasavavandal** (9): I know it was the 80’s but this is some garbage advice

**qazz23** (9): another good deep cut, their catchy pop sound is as good as ever

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): Insomnia was robbed in Kpop, will it succeed here?

**celladonn** (8.5): an exciting new addition to my songs about insomnia playlist

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Very fun straightforward bop

**homestarguy** (8.5): An anthem for all my fellow Sleep Apnea Warriors!

**2dina3dworld** (8): If you can’t sleep then feel free to join me in my bed (this offer is only redeemable for [REDACTED])

**bbfan132** (8): today i learned…

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Why did I eat a whole block of cheese at 11:00 PM?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): insomnia anthem

**nt96** (8): cue Roll Safe

**whoisValensi** (8): This is NOT helping my brain with trying to separate The Go-Go's from The Bangles. Also wait did they just say smth about talking in your sleep??? Like the song from The Romantics??? Iconic.

**plastichaxan** (7.8): minds of masterminds

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): i mean... sure, i guess...  but why?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): kinda seems like they should see a professional about this

**TiltControls** (7.5): These bands really love just having statements as their titles huh

**seanderlust** (7.2): this title needs that eddie murphy pointing at his brain meme

**1998tweety** (7): i agree

**akanewasright** (7): the title is just giving this

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Finally back to the upbeat bops!

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): title is giving post tiktok-virality rebranding

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): No fuckin way!!! Next you’re gonna tell me that the Moon in the sky is called the Moon!!!

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): you can’t talk if you can’t be in your sleep when you walk and you talk in your sleep if you can’t sleep

**starla\_** (5.5): you should see a doctor about that

**Stryxen** (5): kinda fun but doesn’t really go anywhere so its a relative flop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): wow real eye opening information the go-go’s thanks for sharing that tidbit of information

**vayyiqra** (4): This song's lyrics irrationally annoy me for reasons I cannot put into words

**shipperondeck** (7.2): A bit quirkier than the song before it, but also kind of boring, right? I don't know. Sorry popheads! Your host is here to disappoint<3

**bulforster** (4): This song just kind of makes me uncomfortable, which I get is the point but it just makes me not want to listen to it. I'm glad other people enjoy it though.

---

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): This feels like a more haunting sequel to Peter Gabriel’s Games Without Frontiers

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): love the somber atmosphere of this song

**bbfan132** (10): i love the moodier atmosphere here, such a gorgeous track

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (10): Mojique hitting that slay button

**frogaranaman** (10): Link on the waker or whatever the fuck happened that video game

**plastichaxan** (10): this stuck with me idk

**vayyiqra** (10): I almost 11ed this song before deciding it was a waste since it won't win. I don't think anyone else likes this song as much as I do. "David Byrne sings about how a young African man becomes radicalized into terrorism" is a hard sell and also sounds questionable maybe, but I think they made it work. This song is really beautiful and heartbreaking idk I really like it and feel like no one else will the same way oh well

**whoisValensi** (10): I never put together that this is uhhhh about a terrorist bombing holy shit. More specifically one done from the perspective of someone who is angry over American Colonialism. I need to sit down for about 30 minutes and process this...

**NewWaneLietoc** (9.5): cyberpunk

**daretheghost** (9): Mojique did nothing wrong

**flavasavavandal** (9): maybe not the song that aged the best off this album, and maybe it was never the band’s place to speak on from this perspective. But I think there is still value to this song even forty years later. For one the song is written from a place of empathy and I can’t feel any ill-intent in the lyrics or tone. It’s a deeply uncomfortable listen that doesn’t leave anyone looking good. But it never dehumanises Mojique or the people that America has colonised. I don’t know if I agree with every lyrical choice, something about the framing of “Mojique’s people” doesn’t sit right with me but I feel like I’m being nitpicky there

**own-photograph-4642** (9): The wind in my heart! The dust in my head!

**pig-serpent** (9): I didn’t remember liking the dark songs at the end of the album so much before, but the one really clicked for me and I just get everything about the vibe.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): this is kinda freaky but I’m vibing with it

**AHSWeeknd** (8): the way he says “mojique” is so nice

**camerinian** (8): this would be so hypnotic if not for those buzzer sounds

**MrSwearword** (8): a sort of return to...well not form but better sounding songs.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.7): this is so ominous but i enjoy it a lot, it really does sound like it could be the main theme to an 80’s horror movie

**duracell93** (7.5): Vibey I like it!

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Sonically intriguing but also a bit repetitive

**starla\_** (7.5): this song tells an interesting story, but as a song it's not my favourite

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Maybe one day we’ll have a mainstream-enough actual Native American singer to tell their own story

**seanderlust** (6.7): i'm....really not sure how to feel about this one

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): cool. i guess?

**DirtyRat583** (6.2): jungle music

**homestarguy** (5): Look, the sentiment of this song is pretty cool but…let’s just say I’m glad they put out “Speaking In Tongues” after this album lol.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): dust in the song as well

**CrimsonROSET** (4): oh no

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): About as exciting as listening to actual wind.

**Stryxen** (1): tried to dance to this, and i couldn’t!! Maybe that’s my fault. No it must be david byrne’s

**bulforster** (10): One of my favs on the album, the drums especially are so good.

**shipperondeck** (8): Their hooks are so good. So rarely do they miss. I love them

---

**bbfan132** (10): this title is kind of interesting but the song itself is perfect

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): He’s like a skidmark, that’s all on your heart! Cause once he puts that love on you it never comes off!

**flavasavavandal** (10): drums *heart emoji*

**MrSwearword** (10): I am in disbelief as to how hard this group went in on this album and how many fucking tens I've given them.

**fadedblue09** (9): Love the 80s summery vibe enhanced by that guitar solo

**pahc** (9): i love my car!!!

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): and skidmarks in my…

**whoisValensi** (8.5): I'm just gonna pretend that the "Her" in this is actually a car. Just because I think taking this in the very literal sense of the words would be VERY funny.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): yeahh this is really good

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I enjoy the motorized vehicle references in this

**camerinian** (8): This is such a bop that it almost distracts my brain from thinking they're singing about the other kind of skidmark

**homestarguy** (8): I have a gut feeling this song isn’t actually about cars!!!

**Stryxen** (8): tbh… just gorgest, that guitar around 1:50. I died

**welcome2thejam** (8): Super fun surf rock riff

**amr** (7.7): points off for the title be serious for one second

**slimboyfriend** (7): ok some of these metaphors are a little forced

**seanderlust** (6.5): i think it's the other association with the term skid marks that makes me feel like this is a parody of a go-gos song. 3OH!3 making a song called Skid Marks about the other kind of skid mark really ruined my brain, huh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i am choosing to believe this is about the road

**ImADudeDuh** (6): please be about cars please be about cars please be about cars

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): if you have skidmarks on your heart you should probably get that checked out

**vayyiqra** (6): Weird metaphor idk

**starla\_** (5.5): that is a very unpleasant song title

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (5): this is where I stop caring about this album

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): maybe they left you because you sound like this

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The fact that if you asked me “Which of these 4 bands have a song about fucking a car?” The Go-Go’s would be the LAST group I’d guess. And of course they do it way more boringly than any of the other three bands would

**bulforster** (8.5): Cracking up a bit (while dying inside) at this mostly instrumental song being top 3 on the album, I didn't realise how much of a turnoff the vocalists would be.

**shipperondeck** (8.3): From its instrumental beginning, you can tell this album is going to be a journey, in the best way possible. Dear listeners, get ready for the intergalatic slay of your life.

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): I’d rather be on Planet Claire than Planet Her

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I enjoy that they explored the lore of Planet Claire

**babadork** (10): Everyone should be constantly interpolating and sampling Henry Mancini.

**bbfan132** (10): i can see why the guy’s voice is grating but come on, this production is perfect

**jsonphile** (10): what the hell is this song? What is Planet Claire? Where is it? Who is she who came from it? I don’t know and I don’t care it’s a bop. Weird songs like this are my jam

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): this is magic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): so ominous sounding but so silly at the same time, i cant imagine a more perfect way to start this album

**vayyiqra** (10): This is just the Peter Gunn theme which I know from the 1983 video game Spy Hunter for the Commodore 64! but also it's good. (Fun game too, even though it's impossible to beat it.) Side note: my girlfriend's screen name on MSN in 2010 was "Planet Claire". She had good music taste and was a B-52s stan and would not like these rate results

**welcome2thejam** (10): Intro theme song to a 70s TV show about a space age noir detective

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): the instrumental is giving pink panther 60s spy movie, living for it

**homestarguy** (9): Yassified Peter Gunn

**slimboyfriend** (9): I’m entering a low budget late 50s sci fi B movie

**thedoctordances1940** (9): this is very yass and slay and then the vocals come in and it's like they do not sound great but then it quickly becomes very yass and slay again

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): Why is this so OMINOUS?

**daretheghost** (8.5): Groovy spy film type beat

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): going to get lobotomized at Planet Claire’s

**starla\_** (8.5): delightful

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Boys are from Jupiter. Girls are from Venus. Claires are from Planet Claire. Makes sense.

**camerinian** (8): was not expecting an "Oh THIS song" moment in this rate but wow I definitely know that riff, God knows where from though

**frogaranaman** (8): scooby doo ass

**MrSwearword** (8): a good opener and rather cinematic to me.

**nt96** (8): omg Claire's has a planet?? Wow! Is it near Planet Hollywood or Planet Fitness by any chance???

**qazz23** (8): neat synth lines

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Planet Her outsold

**whoisValensi** (8): This plays in the opening of a campy spy movie, change my mind.

**1998tweety** (7.5): where teenage girls go to get their ears pierced

**celladonn** (7.5): pink air, red trees, no one ever dies AND no one has a head? Sign me up!

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): but can you get your ears pierced there

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): why does this remind me of the jimmy neutron theme

**own-photograph-4642** (7): Pretty solid opener

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sci-fi rock? Okay

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): cool instrumental

**seanderlust** (6.7): i'm not against an extended intro, especially to kick off an album, but something about the mixing here i really don't like. please do not send me nerd emoji yes i know "the mixing ooooh the mixing" is a meme please i am just a mere rate score farmer trying to earn an honest living

**pahc** (6.5): that well she isnt line is such a flop actually

**DaHumanTorch** (6.3): chromatica would fuck planet claire up in an intergalactic war

**Roxieloxie** (6): but did she get her ears pierced on planet claire

**fadedblue09** (5): Interesting….don't see the need for the ominous vibe though

**RandomHypnotica** (4): oh no... what is this mess... i am beginning to worry this album is not as fun as i thought it was

**CrimsonROSET** (3): this feels like the song that plays at the start of one of those campy 70s batman movies. edit: oh this isn’t just an instrumental? unfortunate

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): When we were kids my younger sister was friends with a girl named Claire and so my dad would always call her “Planet Claire” and I’m just now learning that it was a reference to this song! She peed in our car once, I hope she’s doing okay.

**amr** (2): getting my tubes tied at planet claires

**pig-serpent** (0): This song has a great bass riff but it never changes and it’s the only redeeming quality of this annoying and overlong monstrosity that sets this album off on the wrong foot it only briefly recovers from.

**shipperondeck** (9.8): Who else here loves that this album is slay after slay??? Who's with me????????

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): God take me to the yassified municipality.

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): this is a cowboy anthem about reclaiming the town (really just the whiskey a -go-go!)

**AHSWeeknd** (9): “litter the streets of this town” climate change liked that. Does it have to do with climate change? I’m not sure I’m not a biologist.

**bbfan132** (9): i feel like i should be at a fair at night while listening to this

**duracell93** (9): Similar vibe to Lust to Love, but I really like that vibe!

**homestarguy** (9): Very funny imagining the Go-Go’s being from like, I dunno, Pocatello, ID and writing this song about it.

**nt96** (9): they really out here making us look like peasants, as if we don’t do that ourselves

**vayyiqra** (9): They really sell me on the premise of their town being awesome

**plastichaxan** (8.8): omfg this album is making me feel so seen and nostalgic and a lot like whoa

**ImADudeDuh** (8): when they said we’re all whores, I really felt tha

**MrSwearword** (8): well at least the mood is consistent but damn this track not being a five for five in a row snatching is kind of a let down

**qazz23** (8): nice harmonies in the chorus and a good solo

**starla\_** (8): where is your boy tonight I hope he is a gentleman, maybe he won't find out what I know, you were the last good thing about this part of town

**whoisValensi** (8): I hate to say it, but this song is kinda brought down by the delivery of some of the lines... Maybe I'm just really nitpick-y.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): Alright, first one I did not love, but still good

**seanderlust** (7.5): the answer to the question "what is the antagonist of every pop punk song ever made?"

**camerinian** (7): Would appreciate if they told me about the amenities of This Town before convincing me to move there. Not a single line about the public transport infrastructure smh

**CrimsonROSET** (7): hivemind anthem

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Really catchy chorus actually but it uses it a few too many times

**welcome2thejam** (7): If I look this up and this song is about LA I'm gonna yell

**Stryxen** (6.4): this section of the album starts to blend into each other a bit, until the biggest SLAY “we got the beat” interrupts the trend and actually changed the world irreversibly permanently forever

**fadedblue09** (6): I like the guitar riffs but otherwise not very memorable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this sounds like a cult trying to get you to join

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Not 4 Sounds like a boring town

**pig-serpent** (3.5): A monster trying to lure you into their sinister town so they can eat you but they’ve been doing it for 1000 years so they’re really bored of the grift and kind of just want to die already.

**1998tweety** (10): ascending

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I appreciate that this song ends in a fade out, may not be fast but it’s still a fade out

**NewWaneLietoc** (9.4): i ain't fading fast this is well paced!

**TiltControls** (9): This one has really grown on me over the past few months

**whoisValensi** (9): I'm gonna make a really weird comment but you know what, this album as a whole thus far is very uhhh TV & Movie ready. And I don't mean like it sounds like it's specifically made for TV Shows or Movies, no it just sounds like stuff you could throw on any soundtrack and it would just fit. Like I'm listening to this and this just plays in a coming of age film in my mind.

**akanewasright** (8.5): the drama…

**bbfan132** (8.5): sonically (in terms of atmosphere), this almost reminds me of… rem?

**MrSwearword** (8): another not quite snatching track that's basically scored due to the outstanding consistency thus far.

**Stryxen** (8): hopefully like talking heads during the reveal :praying:

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): my attention span with every song on this album sounding so similar

**homestarguy** (7.5): A nice song, but unfortunately I think this album is, well, you know

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It’s not bad but after four 10/11s in a row…ehhhh.

**vayyiqra** (7): Me when I'm doing this ballot and want to go to bed

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s okay enough

**fadedblue09** (6.5): title describes my interest on this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): like this if you cri everytime :(

**CrimsonROSET** (6): allen walker OVER

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Pleasant but one of the less memorable songs on the album

**pig-serpent** (6): Another song with decent sounding verses then drops all energy in the chorus.

**starla\_** (6): this is alright

**welcome2thejam** (6): Hits a lot of the same beats (heh-heh) as previous songs but is a bit of a pale imitator

**shipperondeck** (11): "I'm gonna jump into a crater. See ya later" is just such a slay I actually cannot NOT express enough how much this song and these lines have formulated my personality the last few months

**bulforster** (5.5): I'm a bit annoyed that my least favourite B-52's made it this far after how disastrous yesterday was for them but I'm glad they at least got multiple songs into day 2 which wasn't a given at a lot of points in the rate! This just drags a little to me whereas most other songs on this album breeze by while still being around the same length.

**akanewasright** (9): idk what that beep is, but it serves, I need to add obnoxious beeps to keep the rhythm in more songs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Throw me into the volcano and sacrifice me to the Goddess of Camp.

**qazz23** (9): this is sooooo hot

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is for the hotties

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): kate pierson i have a crush on you .

**duracell93** (8.2): A nice come-down after Rock Lobster!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): my god this is horny

**camerinian** (8): this feels camp even for B-52's standards

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): revisiting a recess classic I see

**fadedblue09** (8): Gets points for awakening my inner geography nerd

**frogaranaman** (8): me in Minecraft caves

**ImADudeDuh** (8): im gonna jump in a crater 🙄 see you later 😒😒

**MrSwearword** (8): having to follow up Rock Lobster is a massive task and while this isn't up to the challenge, it's still tacky and cute.

**nt96** (8): Moana's been real quiet ever since this dropped

**pig-serpent** (8): The most focused song on the album with great atmosphere and theming, just a tad long.

**plastichaxan** (8): their lyrics just feel like the way i ramble in my mind when i’m high and i think that’s genius

**RandomHypnotica** (8): ava max

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): too much volcano

**welcome2thejam** (8): How'd they manage to pull five minutes out of a single pun?

**whoisValensi** (8): I want a lava lamp... I need a lava lamp...

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): realizing I would enjoy the music more if they could sing

**1998tweety** (7): the floor

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I’m still pissed off about that short film they played before *Moana*, like, why was there a sexy lady volcano? They were wrong to do that. This song is nice though.

**Stryxen** (7): whatever that means

**vayyiqra** (7): They said "turn on your lava lamp" but I've found those are disappointing. They're cool for a while but don't last long before the wax settles on the bottom and they stop working. Also note: I believe this is the second time in the past year we have rated a song that mentions Vesuvius and/or Pompeii and third time overall that I can remember

**daretheghost** (6.5): I would also like to jump into a crater

**TiltControls** (6): I do not lava this album so far

**starla\_** (5.5): cute but mid

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this is about cum right

**pahc** (4.5): you know the camp's definitely starting to wear out

**shipperondeck** (9.5): "Ohhh now we're flying away" is a car meme but I always think about it when I listen to this song

**bulforster** (8.5): These horns are crazy, I love them.

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): gonna bop to this during the next earthquake i experience

**NewWaneLietoc** (11): Saintly 11 dispatched to the bleakest anthem in the rate. Hassell's horn solo fucking ace and captures a snapshot of downtown debris slides and metro rides with ample prowess. just an ace effort from some of the best to do it.

**whoisValensi** (11): Idek how I'm gonna begin to put this one into words but I'll for sure try. This song uhhh it moves. That probably sounds weird on the surface but follow me here... It almost feels to me like as a listener I am also walking said line. And sonically that plays out. Also I've always felt lyrically this hits some sorta nerve in me, almost too much relatability for me. My pessimistic nerve hits a head too with the entire thing, it speaks to me. But I have to say... What does it mean for a house to be in motion? I still don't know but I feel like deep down I know, somewhere in my subconscious, I know what a house in motion is, I just cannot get the words out. Honestly all my words here seem futile to how this song genuinely makes me feel (I mean look I’ve cut myself off like 4 times now) and how I comprehend it deep down but I did say I didn't know how I was gonna put it into words.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Honestly they did the damn thing here

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): he has no style, he has no grace

**bbfan132** (10): i thought david said “i’m thinking about emotion” and i was like “so he’s a fellow pophead…”

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): like the house from Up?

**fadedblue09** (10): Very fun, love the instrumentals used

**frogaranaman** (10): sir I think this is an acid trip

**homestarguy** (10): Enjoy this last of a run of 10’s, David, Tina, Chris, and Jerry….it’s about to get rough after this track lol.

**jsonphile** (10): IM WALKING a line

**own-photograph-4642** (10): What a song, what a groove.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I debated giving my 11 to this for a long time, it truly does hit personally and it’s funky as hell

**vayyiqra** (10): They said they'd give us more songs about buildings and food and then they gave us yet another song about buildings. No one can say they don't deliver what they promise. Side note: the Genius comments about how this song is about the housing market being inflated and making housing unaffordable is 1. funny because it's a wacky Talking Heads song 2. sad because it's unfortunately very true : ' )

**welcome2thejam** (10): Genius annotation: "This song is about the realization of dread and corruption under capitalism" Genius user comment: "I always thought it was about being with two girls at the same time"

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9.9): how the fuck do you write a song like this?

**bigbigbee** (9.5): This is just as good as Stevie Wonder’s Superstition, which this mildly reminds me of (guitar riff - nothing else) and which we should rate with great haste

**CrimsonROSET** (9): see this is insanely better than once in a lifetime why does that get all the credit

**daretheghost** (9): hypnotic funky fresh

**qazz23** (8): horn section good 🎺

**seanderlust** (7.8): i love a funk guitar-opening monologue moment

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Pour one out for the last banger on the album.

**1998tweety** (6.5): they are in fact, in motion

**pahc** (6.5): me when i drag a chair

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This feels like… negative space funk

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): maybe i dont like experimental music as much as i thought i did

**MrSwearword** (5): oh hell no, I do not like the delivery of this track. Not only is it Digiorno, but they forgot how to cook.

**starla\_** (5): this is cool but a bit annoying

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): i was saur bored

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): The houses are in motion, but my ass isn’t.

**Stryxen** (4): ~~this reminds me of somebody else by the 1975 don't ask me to explain I won't~~ people on discord told me this was OFFENSIVE and i was asked to delete… the 1975 more like 1984

**pig-serpent** (3.5): A slower groove than those on the first half of the album, and while the change of pace is nice for a while I get tired of this song well before it’s over.

**bulforster** (10): My favourite closer of the rate, makes me feel invincible. And shoutout Gina Schock for being the MVP of this album, her drumming here is stellar as always.

**shipperondeck** (7.5): Song for running around a field with your arms raised over your head and stuff. Hell yeah!

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is the second best closer in the rate

**AHSWeeknd** (10): another song where they spilled. The Go-Go’s knew exactly what to do

**MrSwearword** (10): I have had it but want to thank The Go-Go's for one of the most pleasant first-time album listening experiences I've ever had.

**NewWaneLietoc** (9.4): great closer. lol my tape accidentally includes a quick snippet of side b opener we got the beat closing the tape.

**bbfan132** (9): fun outro!! i enjoyed this album quite a bit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): We can’t stop it but humans will make sure to fuck it up as much as possible on our way out!

**homestarguy** (9): All respect in the world to Gina Schock for going ham on the drums for yet another track.

**pig-serpent** (9): Easily the best song on the album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): sometimes the only thing you can say about a song is “slay!”

**welcome2thejam** (9): Second straight song with great riff bridges bringing up the score

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): DRUMS

**1998tweety** (8.5): i agree

**camerinian** (8.5): This feels like the alpha build version of Kids In America and that's not at all a drag. I also don't know how the timeline pans out on that take so don't ask me to rethink it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): honestly they have a point

**plastichaxan** (8): honestly after this album i think you can besties

**qazz23** (8): good solo and closer

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): A solid ending track!

**vayyiqra** (7): An alright closer to a solid album

**whoisValensi** (6.5): But what if I wanna stop the world cause I wanna get off with someone... Go-Go's can you please answer this very burning question for not only my sanity but for the sanity of Alex Turner.

**fadedblue09** (6): quite generic, there's something intriguing about the drum arrangements though

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is not as good as I remember

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (5): can’t stop this song from being boring

**starla\_** (0): this song really annoys me, I can't describe why

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i also want 2020 vision

**frogaranaman** (9): "I want a room with a view" that is at least $3500/mo in Greenpoint

**MassiveThief** (9): her vocals just make me smile instantly

**pig-serpent** (9): You know kids, I’ve done a lot of admirable things in my life, but the thing that’s truly going to get me into heaven is this one time I watched a dude shower.

**qazz23** (9): good vocals and transition to the solo

**Stryxen** (9): and when are we rating bonito generation

**vayyiqra** (9): Love the hilariously dated "pocket computer" line. It sends me every time idk why

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This lady is horny……. relatable

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): that guitar saved my life

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): All I want is the clock upon the wall. All I want is the story of us all. All I want is the first sound of a newborn child before he starts to crawl.

**fadedblue09** (8): kind of a mild bop, but still fits my ideal new wave sound

**MrSwearword** (8): Despite it coming across as creepy, new wave dictates sarcasm down boots, so if anything this is just Debbie Harry being camp.

**NewWaneLietoc** (8): pleasant

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Damn, two stalking songs in a row huh

**homestarguy** (7.5): This is good but KKB outsold, I’m afraid.

**shipperondeck** (7.7): I'm not sure how this album as a whole is going to fly here tbh.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “it’s 11:59 and I wanna stay alive.” Everyone when the Y2K panic was happening

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): 11:59 is such a slay time like I’m either cozy in bed or one minute from lunch break.

**duracell93** (10): this was almost my 11 it is one of my favorite songs period. I can’t really explain what about it I love, but the first time I heard it years ago I just fell in love!

**homestarguy** (10): If you start playing this song at 11:58:08, Debbie will sing “it’s 11:59” at 11:59:00.

**MrSwearword** (10): this feels like it hits that much harder being in my early thirties listening to this on the Fourth of July in the middle of this fuckery

**seanderlust** (10): COME ON PIPE ORGAN!!!

**vayyiqra** (10): Me when I have to submit a rate ballot before the extension-upon-the-extension that the host gave me (note: I waited until 11:59 to send my ballot even though it was done already, for the sake of the bit)

**whoisValensi** (10): I should have started this rate at 11:59pm but instead it's almost 5am... This is what happens when you have a job that makes you very tired and sometimes even fucks you up physically weeeeeeeeeee

**daretheghost** (9.5): Jimmy Destri writes all my favorite Blondie songs and I am SAD he is no longer in the group.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): popheads turning in a rate ballot on the last day of submissions

**camerinian** (9): ugh this high-tempo sound is what my brain jumps straight to when it hears the words “new wave” and it has never let me down. Directly into my veins for the rest of time, thank u

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9): me submitting this rate on extension day:

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is really cute actually! I love the message and the organ (I think) solo is a nice touch.

**Stryxen** (9): i like how subtly this song builds up throughout even with so much happening

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i made sure i waited until it was 11:59 pm to rate this one, just the way debbie harry intended

**1998tweety** (8.5): the time I submit my assignments at

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like the idea of this song lyrically; it’s not the standout song, but it’s still enjoyable for sure

**own-photograph-4642** (8.5): "I wanna stay alive!" is a highlight.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Love the rockier intro here

**flavasavavandal** (8): so glad you wanna stay alive at 11:59 but you won’t be saying the same thing when it hits 01:59 because of a rate reveal and your 11 leaves

**frogaranaman** (8): the time I turned in all of my assignments in college

**pig-serpent** (8): I love the overly dramatic opening into a breezy summer song transition. Both moods fit the song very well, as it’s about urgently trying to make a pleasant moment last forever. Sadly, I think it’s a little better in concept than execution.

**qazz23** (8): love the organ in this

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): fuck i literally listened to this at 12:01

**nt96** (7.5): insert comment about sending in ballots 1 min before the deadline

**NewWaneLietoc** (7.2): yeah okay why's it gotta sound like a coney island carnival

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): is this about the doomsday clock

**bigbigbee** (7): hey it’s the exact time that I submit rates (EDIT: nope ended up having to ask for an extension…embarrassing)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): me at new years

**fadedblue09** (7): Quite typical, but still has some enjoyable elements

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’m not entirely sure what “candidate for wax” is supposed to mean but I like the way it sounds

**welcome2thejam** (7): "It's ten to ten," "it's 11:59" so which is it, Blondie?

**plastichaxan** (6.8): aaa there’s something missing to make it good good but like

**bulforster** (10): I think this is my favourite song on the album, the Stop Making Sense version of this especially might be one of my favourite performances ever.

**shipperondeck** (9.8): The spoken part of this song that I am sure many critics have compared to rapping is my favorite part of this song :)

---

**akanewasright** (10): I heard this chorus and had a ratatouille flashback moment… my dad was a fan of the band Phish and apparently they covered this song? Bc I knew their version from him playing it in the car, and I honestly didn’t even know it was a cover? Wow…

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): never knew a critique of objectivity could be so funky

**bbfan132** (10): i love how groovy and odd this is

**daretheghost** (10): FACTSARESIMPLEANDFACTSARESTRAIGHT

**frogaranaman** (10): what a timeless melody

**homestarguy** (10): David Byrne with the absolute BARS on this one.

**MrSwearword** (10): OK maybe it becomes dense after this track. I did not expect anything funky to come after the opener.

**NewWaneLietoc** (10): gamer anthem

**own-photograph-4642** (10): The Stop Making Sense version really reinforces how awesome this song is.

**qazz23** (10): love the funky sound and different vocal styles used

**vayyiqra** (10): The whole A-side of this album goes so hard and I don't have much to say about this song but it rules and I love the electric organ

**welcome2thejam** (10): Love my philosophy professor Big Suit David Byrne

**whoisValensi** (10): It's moments like these were I think about how like... every song on this album is so fucking good... I may have gotten this on CD last year for my borthday but I need it on vinyl I really do. (Also because my copies of 'Fear of Music' and 'Little Creatures' are fucking fantastic on vinyl. Even if 'Little Creatures' has a chunk taken out of it because it was used & $5 lol...)

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): facts are nothing is not something i wanna hear someone say in 2022, so good thing this is from the 80s

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The grooves on the first half of this album are just unstoppable!

**seanderlust** (8.8): i literally feel too dumb to understand what david is saying about facts towards the end of this track so i'm just going to say "bop" and move on

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): The narrator of every talking heads song is just grooving through the edge of a mental breakdown huh?

**plastichaxan** (8): been there

**nt96** (7.5): The chorus is straight up identical to Rainbo Conversation by Stereolab.

**pahc** (7.5): so i listened to this in a listening party, had to pause for a bit bc i thought i heard someone breaking in lmao

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this feels so much longer than 5 minutes

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I wonder if they’re still waiting

**fadedblue09** (7): Fun, a bit repetitive at times

**pig-serpent** (7): The best (and shortest) song on this album that’s just an unchanging funky beat with nonsense yelled over it. I really wish it was the only one. Even then, it could stand to be at least a minute shorter.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): So I think for most of this album I’m gonna give it a high score on the music alone, it’s very funky and satisfying, but the lyrics are just incomprehensible to me sometimes. Maybe I’m not on enough levels of irony yet

**DirtyRat583** (6.7): omg a normal song. you did it talking heads! i knew you could do it

**CrimsonROSET** (6): facts don’t care abou- wait this whole album is that isn’t it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): The same issue I’m having with the earlier track. Groovy and funky but I hosted a whole-ass 70s Soul Classics rate so idk I can listen to funk music somewhere else idk alkdflkslks

**starla\_** (5.5): a lot going on

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): instrumental on this one is really interesting (especially the guitars) but the vocals grate on me and drag it down

**Stryxen** (5): tried to remember anything about this but it evacuates my memory as soon as the song ends. so no comment from me this time girls

WaneLietoc: well congrats team on killing side B of go-gos, failing to keep planet claire in contention, and getting rid of the scary talking head song (that was my 11)!

if you aren't a scaredy cat and fancy yourself more a macho fella, well then my "off-the-books but very valid" ambient head 2 rate (featuring Jon Hassell of Houses in Motion fame) will be right up your alley.
