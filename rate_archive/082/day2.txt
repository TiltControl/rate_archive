**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): My hot take back when Frozen was as popular as all hell was “FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER IS WAY BETTER THAN LET IT GO! EAT A COCK LOSERS UWU!’ and looking back I...do not exactly see how I came to that conclusion. This is still pretty entertaining, though! I honestly think every other song on Frozen’s soundtrack is eclipsed by the dramatic tension of Let It Go, but the binaries between Anna and Elsa that For the First Time Ever illustrates with a charming melody accompanied by lyrics that are both endearing yet carefully lain with subtext; maybe that’s why I used to love this song so much. As a finishing touch, Elsa belting out ‘TELL THE GUARDS TO OPEN UP THE GATES!’ is an amazing moment; truly, we do not deserve Indina Menzel.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bopt, vocals jumped.

**jess\_22** (10): the only Frozen song worth listening to

**jexan13** (10): I'm a sucker for songs that interpolate other songs from the same "album". That Let It Go glimpse elevates an already great song. Because it's a great song, totally overshadowed by Let It Go. Bombastic and emotional. Just lovely.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Feels like a true 90s era Disney song, also tells us everything we need to know about Anna and Elsa's personalities.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a dramatic opening

**J\_Toe** (9): thank goodness disney abandoned guitar pop. This is a true return to form!

**slimboyfriend** (9): If you overlook some of the #relatable lyrics, you can see that this is the best song Disney's put out in like 20 years

**FluffyNobody** (8): I am just in awe of how different Kristen Bell's singing voice sounds from her regular voice

**silentev** (8): I love the funny lyrics woven into this bouncy song.

**junobeekeeper** (7.1): Love the enthusiasm here.

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (7): The reprise is better but it’s still cute.

**nowqueenofpop** (7): This is such a fun song and Kristen is so good but I’m using this as an opportunity to promote For The First Time in Forever (Reprise) which is superior and will remain so

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): I remembered the songs in this movie being a lot better than they actually are

**vayyiqra** (6): i'm not sure this song needs to be here it's okay i guess

**pearllouise** (5): “Why have a ballroom with no balls” Most feminist line in music history

**SFbby** (5): How did they even survive by themselves in the castle

**NotWith10000Men** (4): the reprise is 100x better

**Steelstepladder** (4): Outside off the trolls song this is probably the most forgettable song from Frozen

**bespectacIed** (3): I hate this song!!! So cheesy and corny and bland and clunky, both anna and elsa's verses

**yourhostandpatron** (10): It’s almost as if Alan Menken took one look at Poor, Unfortunate Souls, decided that he could do even better (which is a crazy concept in itself), and made Be Prepared for the world to see. It’s easy to understand what a fantastically terrifying scene to is when you’re still a kid and you’re scared as shit of hyenas, but it becomes even better when you’re older and you begin to notice all the fascistic imagery in it alongside the fact that Scar is a classic Shakespearean villain. There’s just too much in that hammy performance of his not to love. Also, when Scar’s voice basically fucking breaks after he raises it in the climax and the entire song becomes fucking ballistic? That actually rendered Jeremy Irons unable to sing another note, so you could forgive people for having the impression that Be Prepared is kind of an intense number. I just adore this one a little too much.

**vhqv1997** (9): Scar was also a gay-coded villain so the fact that this ranked so low means each one of you had internalized homophobia and you need to work on yourselves and your own beliefs.

---

# PREPARED

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bopt, Scar is a king. Third best villain song periodt. The vocals on here jumped and the chorus slaps.

**CarlieScion** (10): disney villains > disney heroes

**DanMcMissile** (10): taught me all my vocab tbh

**fortyfive33** (10): Scar is hella intimidating, low-key.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Greatest villain song from Disney

**rickikardashian** (10): I dont remember if Scar had a darker song or something, but it actually shocked me that his villain song was this bop, because this easily could just be the goofy comedic relief song with other lyrics

**SFbby** (10): A masterpiece villian song that's dark, has a backing choir, extensive vocabulary, and humor.

**silentev** (10): If we are going by the power that is Jeremy Irons then yes tens all around!

**skargardin** (10): BE PREPAAAAAAARED to be fuming when this song flops and is out day 1

**Steelstepladder** (10): Be prepared for this song to do well in the rate

**waluigiest** (10): one of the top villain themes, without a doubt

**J\_Toe** (9): watch Lindsay Ellis' video on Disney marketing through the aesthetics of fascism: The Ideology of the First Order https://youtu.be/XAVeyXwy3BE?t=94

**Tolk1en** (9): what a bop

**junobeekeeper** (8.2): Again I really love villain songs so this does a lot for me.

**agentofscranton** (8): we love blatant references to nazi imagery don’t we girls?

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (8): It’s evil as fuck, that’s for sure.

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Yet again, villain song is superior

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): what a slapper

**hikkaru** (7): I love this scene in the movie but it's actually kinda mediocre without it lmao

# NOT PREPARED

**vayyiqra** (6): this scene frightened me as a kid and that was before knowing it was supposed to be like a hyena nazi rally which doesn't help. i don't really like villain songs as a rule but this is one of the better ones. still it's not one of my favourite from this movie and i say that as a lion king stan (either it or aladdin is my favourite disney movie at least from the renaissance)

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): the lemur brings it down a point and why are there so many damn songs from this movie? it's not that good.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): boys scouts outpeaked

**slimboyfriend** (5): This song isn't underrated, y'all Disney twinks are just horny for Scar

**FluffyNobody** (4): I had no memory of this song, and I long to go back to that state

**anothertown** (3): i think i'm just not into this goth shit

**bespectacIed** (2): hurr durr i'm a villain

**pearllouise** (2): Scar is a piece of shit

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): What better way is there to introduce folklore to a modern day audience than the power of music? I think this is the best character-defining Disney ditty to grace the silver screen ever since Friend Like Me back in 1992; I wasn’t expecting The Rock to do such a fantastic job doing singing work for an animated movie, but put together with his charisma, You’re Welcome’s fantastical and literally legendary lyrics are colorful and dazzling enough to make Howard Ashman proud. An underrated revival classic.

**vhqv1997** (8): That clip of Maui’s dancing pecs still haunts me.

---

# ROCK

**CarlieScion** (10): https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/e4yk1k/what_killed_rocks_mainstream_presence/f9g1al6/

**rickikardashian** (10): homeboi really tried dto fucking murder Moana and people just kept watching the movie ignoring the fact that he really was ready to leave her to starve in a cave

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): The Rock outsold all your favs

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): okay mr. the rock snapped

**agentofscranton** (8.5): i hate the rock so much and i don't know why. why is he so successful. i don't get it.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): The Rock is main pop girl!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the rock can like barely sing, but this still bops

**Steelstepladder** (8): I want a biopic about The Rock... but make it a musical

**1998tweety** (7.5): It's ok...I mean it's not bad but I don't stan it.

**junobeekeeper** (7.1): To quote this song, it's okay!

**J\_Toe** (7): prefer the songs Where You Are, Shiny, and I Am Moana

**SFbby** (7): Unfortunately, the Rock's voice doesn't quite work for this song

**jexan13** (6.5): this song doesn't think it is superior to you... it knows it. I hate it but at the same time I like it, I mean, it's very catchy and it ain't bad.

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (6): The bridge is the best part.

**FluffyNobody** (6): I think I need more context for this

**vayyiqra** (6): this is okay i like dwayne johnson he seems like a fairly pure guy

**silentev** (5.5): Is Dwayne Johnson even singing? I guess this is enhanced by the music and lyrics.

# PAPER

**bespectacIed** (5): It's fun but meh

**nowqueenofpop** (5): A wrestler turned actor does not a singer make. Fun when you watch the movie but not as a standalone song!

**skargardin** (5): eh I've never really gotten the love for this song

**anothertown** (1): have we ever rated lin manuel miranda on here? glad to be one of the first to rate him a 1 if not.

**pearllouise** (0): Have I gone noseblind? I just don’t smell what The Rock is cooking

**vhqv1997** (9.5): You thought Let It Go was overplayed to death? My sister, who is 6 years older than me, put this song on loop an entire holiday season and forced every single member of my family to listen to it for an entire week and nothing else. And yet, I could still give it a good score because I’m an adult capable of rating things professionally, unlike some of y’alls.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I used to be more critical of this in the past due to the acoustic pop guitar setup that I was obviously no fan of; luckily for Mandy Moore, though, I've been able to relate and to bop to this a lot more often as of late, no thanks to what I find to be her unexpectedly beautiful voice. It reminds me of my state of my mind just before the school year started for me back in August; I was finally becoming productive for the first time due to my ADHD finally being medicated, and I really was ready to try and become a functional social being in an academic setting I would absolutely love, but I was stuck at home doing things related to my hyperfixations and wishing the friends I had met in online freshman groups would already come together and meet me in real life. There's a convincing mix of boredom, frustration, and a persistent optimism here that makes me and Rapunzel's lives parallel perfectly, and it's also what makes this song worth its place on Tangled.

---

# THOSE WHO HAVE A LIFE

**1998tweety** (10): Bopt

**bespectacIed** (10): I unabashedly love this hannah montana song, the movie scene for this is so brilliantly done, like the rest of the movie. Tangled is definitively the best Disney animated film, EVER.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me singing about being bored af while choosing not to do anything productive in my that day

**rickikardashian** (9.5): The English version sounds adorable🥺🥺🥺 ^(also this song benefitted with being rated in englishz because had we done it in Spanish I would have gone insane because my little cousins made me watch this movie a thousand times)

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): I fucking kill this song when it comes on my Disney playlist in my car on my way to Disneyland... god I want to go back again! Road trip anyone??

**hikkaru** (9): how does she sweep twice, polish, wax, do laundry, and mop all within 15 minutes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): maybe rapunzel’s hair’s true powers weren’t the ability to reverse aging but to let her work fast enough to finish her chores in only 15 minutes

**nowqueenofpop** (8): When Mandy said “and basically just wonder when will my life begin”… yeah. Also, how in the world does she do all of those chores between 7 and 715 like please tell me.

**Steelstepladder** (8): How does this song go again? I haven't seen Tangled in so long that I forge- SEVEN A.M. THE USUAL MORNING LINEUP

**FluffyNobody** (7): Cute I guess?

**slimboyfriend** (7): We wanted another album, but Mandy Moore said, "Here's a PERFORMANCE."

**vayyiqra** (7): honestly same

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): a little too pop-rocky for me but the last verse is amazing

**thegolding** (6): Tbh this is really good but it gets so overshadowed with so many wonderful I want songs. Mandy Moore is a queen tho

# THOSE WHO ARE STILL TRAPPED IN THE TOWER

**junobeekeeper** (5.4): I've seen this movie way too many times… the songs cute but not great

**J\_Toe** (5): Disney going Broadway was a good idea. The 89-98 Disney songs are timeless, they still hold up today. Disney going pop was not so wise. This subgenre of guitar pop is too dated to stand the test of time. (though, tbh, the theme hit hard for me in that space between graduating uni and landing a proper job)

**jexan13** (5): this feels like a filler track of a 2000's single artists

**pearllouise** (5): Never

**silentev** (5): Not the best exposition song but still fun, enhanced by Mandy Moore.

**vhqv1997** (10): The first Disney movie to leave an impression on my mind was Tarzan, and I loved its portrayal of familial love and acceptance. Of course, telling a story about apes accepting a human baby can’t be as resonant as, well, a father accepting a daughter, so nobody was gonna love this as much as Mulan’s songs. Nevertheless, these songs held a special place in my heart, and at one point I was willing to fight people to get all the Tarzan songs in here, but I refrained, and you did this dirty anyway, so I guess I made the right choice in the end.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Can I confess something? I haven't watched Tarzan since I was a child and I've never persuaded myself to revisit it even in my moments of hyperfixation towards Disney movies, thanks to my disinterest in the thought of a non-musical (well, maybe you could call it a quasi-musical) taking place in a setting as unappealing to me as the depths of the jungle. Looking back, I'm glad I have the decency to admit that I was a complete idiot. Everything about this film looks gorgeous. I should watch it again over my holiday break. Two Worlds is a song that just makes me realize what a blind I made in ignoring Tarzan even further; yes, you can laugh at Phil Collins all you want here, but next to Bells of Notre Dame there's no other Disney song that introduce plot and conflict here quite as stunningly. I just had to watch this in conjunction with its animation, and coming back from it, I really regret my former attitude.

---

# BEST OF BOTH WORLDS

**agentofscranton** (10): the Two Worlds sequence should be up there with the Up opening in terms of saddest moments in film - an entire baby gorilla and tarzan’s mom and dad get fucking eaten and everything, ellie just got old and decided to dip from the mortal plane smh

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): For whatever reason I was so resistant to liking this movie or its songs as a kid... but this song I could never hide that I truly did love it.

**FluffyNobody** (10): This is great, but WHO DECIDED THAT THE GREATEST SONG IN THE TARZAN DISCOGRAPHY AKA SON OF MAN DID NOT BELONG HERE????

**junobeekeeper** (10): Phil really went off here. The moment you hear those drums it's like. Fuck yeah.

**sailormunelune** (10): Phil Collins did that

**tomservo88** (10): (but the radio version)

**skargardin** (9): Tarzan underrated as frick and that's on periodt

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): The percussion is great in the song but otherwise lyrically I’m kind of meh on it

**CarlieScion** (8): stan phil collins

**rickikardashian** (8): the start of the song was getting me hyped up, and then it just brought me down real quick

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): i don't think this soundtrack is gonna get the love it deserves and that hurts my heart

**silentev** (7.5): I mean it’s a Phil Collins song with drums, what did you think was going to happen?

**pearllouise** (7): Will the real world please stand up?

**vayyiqra** (7): phil collins is a wiener and i've never liked tarzan but goddammit i love cheesy 80s-sounding crap like this so i'm mad

# NO WORLD

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This song is so average that I wouldn't listen to it if it weren't in a movie. But it is, and that opening scene HURTS

**1998tweety** (6): No thanks

**fortyfive33** (6): Eight points for the opening minute, two points docked for the second Phil starts singing

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why did phil collins make some of the most boring disney songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): yeah this is definitely a phil collins song

**J\_Toe** (4): tbh a disney musical w/o characters singing is just not gonna do it for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if you give this song anything less than an 8 you have no taste

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the sherman brothers are main pop girls

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (8): No one can deny how catchy this song is.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): long ass bitch

**silentev** (7): Not the best song to show off Julie Andrews’ singing, but still a fun and delightful song and makes you think about those weird dancing penguins.

**SFbby** (6): Too long of a title

**junobeekeeper** (4.5): eh it's not the worst.

**vayyiqra** (4): this is often cited as the longest word in the english language and it is NOT and also it's a made-up word but aside from that this song is too chaotic and overwhelming and it's really weird and short so i don't like it

**bespectacIed** (1): iconic song but mary poppins was right, this is something quite atrocious

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Everybody looks at this as the most annoying part of the Lion King, and I kind of get them, but, guys, Hakuna Matata is right there. Your childhood nostalgia is just tricking you into thinking this is a worse song! Okay, no, I’m just kidding, you can have any kind of opinion on the Lion King sountrack you want (I don’t really care because they’re fucking Disney songs) but I just find this number to be so...fun? Sure, Simba is basically a huge ass of a brat here, but this is another way to show how colorful the Lion King’s savannah setting is without being as gravitious or imposing as Circle of Life (and Circle of Life is amazing, but, hey, we all need to get a bit less serious sometimes!) The pitty you feel for Zazu during this song is also hilarious. I don’t find it to be a blight on the movie in the least.

**vhqv1997** (9): Let’s not forget that kingship is passed down when the previous king dies so in reality Simba was singing about his father fucking off the mortal coil.

# KINGS

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): That ending though.

**J\_Toe** (10): omg I learned how to do this song in sign language as part of my primary school's compulsory sign language choir! I was so good I got to perform the song at an old-peoples' home!

**SFbby** (10): Wildly infectious and happy

**FluffyNobody** (9.5): The intro weirdly reminds me of Under the sea? Anyway, a bop

**rickikardashian** (8.5): no one explained to Simba the events that would need to happen for him to be king, did they?

**1998tweety** (8): You can't wait for your dad to be dead....ok

**fortyfive33** (8): This song's mix is kinda screwed, but the base instrumentation and performance carry the day.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): best song from the movie.

**pearllouise** (8): Is this what Donald Trump sang before he got elected?

**vayyiqra** (8): my god zasu is a whiner. otherwise this song is really cute and pure. it's about a fucking lion cub, lion cubs are cute

**Steelstepladder** (7): Another Lion King song I think is pretty overrated. It's good but it's not one of the best of the movie.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Fuck, I want to give this a low score for how it (along with Pocahontas in general) implictly associates the start of the brutal colonization of America with some sort of romantic whitewashed shit about finding something new for love, but....Judy Khun’s voice here is just so good! It’s highs and lows fit in so well with this scene’s waterfall setting and there’s something technical about the singing here that’s just so gorgeous and hard to hate. Something as beautiful as this really didn’t deserve to be associated with one of the only bad 90s Disney movies at all.

---

**fortyfive33** (10): This has some of the best lyrics of any Disney song. I mean, it's basically Something's Coming, but that song is also a jam.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Pocahontas might be one of the weaker 90s Disney movies but the music has always been my favorite

**waluigiest** (10): so gorgeous this one hits so right

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): the melody is so interesting and i love the way she hits "the riverbeEeEeEend"

**1998tweety** (9): Cute

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): Pocahontas is UNDERRATED. PERIODT.

**bespectacIed** (9): dangerous, genocidal, white colonizers are what's around the riverbend, pocahontas

**ImADudeDuh** (9): bopping a bit, even though i hate the outside

**pearllouise** (9): This song is gay culture

**junobeekeeper** (8.5): Ok look, Pocahontas is a bad movie, but this is a beautiful song. Shame it's for this movie!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): whoever sings as Pocahontas has a fantastic voice

**J\_Toe** (8): this song sounds like it's tripping over itself in a way. Not like it's out of step, but that's it's just a step ahead of itself, which I guess fits the symbol of the river bend

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): My dad’s friend died while canoeing I don’t recommend this

**silentev** (7.5): I love the fast pace of the song but sometimes it loses me.

**FluffyNobody** (6): The song is fine I guess?

**SFbby** (5): The tempo feels too rushed for a song just about going down a river

**skargardin** (5): Might be my least favorite on the entire Pocahontas soundtrack, it's just.. painfully average

**vayyiqra** (5): i do not remember this song and it's not having any impact on me either way so it gets a 5 i guess

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Okay, I know we’re all going to talk about Hellfire here first and foremost and just ignore poor little Quasimodo, but I have to say that I’ve grown to love Heaven’s Light over the years. I’m not going to reveal my thoughts on how I feel about the entire “Quasimodo has a crush on Esmeralda” plot point here because that would make my comment super long, but it’s as sweet and wholesome as any song on this movie is ever going to get. I wanna hug this guy. Now, about Hellfire itself...I could do my stereotypical long pretentious description of what a fucking masterpiece this song is, despite how atypical it is for a Disney villain song, or even a Disney song, in general, but I think I’m just going to list down all the elements that make this *the* song where Alan Menken shows how much he’s mastered the drama required from musical theatre. The Latin chants, the deep register of Tony Jay, the sinister perspective here that just gets down to the heart of how evil Frollo is for the movie’s audience to shake at, the terrifying animation that accompanies the scene, the summarization of most of this movie’s themes when you couple it with Heaven’s Light...there’s just so much to love here, so much admire every time you listen to it. It’s uncomfortable, it’s rage-inducing, it’s teeth-clenching, and it’s absolutely perfect. The brilliance of this song is what got me into Disney movies, as well as musicals, in general. God bless the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

**vhqv1997** (9): The Hunchback of Notre Dame was an incredibly nuanced and complex film, which is far darker than some of  the grittiest fairy tales retelllings, and this song was the hardest proof there ever is. Claude Frollo was a deeply disturbing villain and this song, a dive into his mind’s inner workings, was just horrifying. Too bad that on streaming sites Heaven’s Light is always paired with Hellfire, because I feel like Hellfire by itself is such an amazing song that deserved to go higher but the fact it’s got accompanied by another power ballad makes it much harder to give it a good score.

# REACHING HEAVEN

**1998tweety** (11): Lit rally the best Disney villain song ever and we are not debating that. There is so much substance in this song ugh, the other girlies just can't relate. First of all we get vocals, and these vocals are GOOD. The production sis...she snapped and she snapped HARD. The choir in the background ugh we love her too.

**Steelstepladder** (11): Hellfire is the single greatest moment any Disney villain has ever had and no this is not debatable

**agentofscranton** (10): i’m just going to link the writeup from the popjustice disney rate that explains why this is an amazing song because I’m not nearly smart enough to put my feelings about this song into words nearly as well: https://forum.popjustice.com/threads/the-disney-classics-rate-the-end.63441/page-87#post-5432758

**bambamhenny** (10): ngl if not for HRCR this would get my 11, the catholic guilt, the latin lyrics, my gay ass still stans catholic aesthetics, the religious fvgs went off with this kind of music, the song is so horny 🤣 im- but the DRAMA 😭

**hikkaru** (10): best villain song !!!

**ManofOranges** (10): this is a 10 solely because of hellfire

**thegolding** (10): The song of a creepy kinky priest telling how horny he is, MADE by Disney? Ofc is a 10

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): It’s not my fault, I’m not to blame. It is the gypsy girl, the witch, who set this flame.... okay Trump.

**brenda\_official** (9): song about christian sexual repression in disney movie

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is such an underrated song. Quasimodo’s voice is so good and I like the drama of hellfire.

**junobeekeeper** (9): I know, I know. My takes are terrible. But this is a very good and powerful sounding villain song. It's so creepy, which was definitely intended. I do not personally endorse Catholicism, even though the aesthetics do slap.

**silentev** (9): Angry old man sings epic ballad about how a woman’s sexiness is her own fault and not his own, results in the most amazing song from one of the most underrated Disney films.

**skargardin** (9): Plays like a miniature symphony and i LOVE it

**jexan13** (8.5): if you change "gipsy girl" for Shawn Mendes, Hellfire could as well be sung by /r/popheads

**vayyiqra** (8): i am a catholic and choirs just hit different for me ok not to mention pipe organs

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): hellfire a 10 but heaven's light a 5 so...

**fortyfive33** (7): Literally leveraging Catholic guilt for a showtune. Nicely done.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i really want to watch this movie now

**yourhostandpatron** (7): There’s still enough charm in this song to make me like it, but its simplicity honestly gives me the impression that Alan Menken was more than a little worn out on writing so many “I Want” songs after the other for most of the Renaissance (fuck, didn’t he take a break from Disney soundtracks after this movie?! Like, a break that lasted more than a decade?! I knew it!) The melody here is nice, but it suffers from being too much of a model for what you’d expect a 90s Disney protagonist song to typically sound like. It’s a nice little segment, but it’s not as memorable as so many other canon songs from this decade.

# GOING THE DISTANCE

**agentofscranton** (10): i always have a lot of time for this song - the instrumental never fails to get me feeling some kinda way

**AvatarKanol** (10): Such an inspiring song.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this song is so fucking beautiful. i love the trumpets? in the background

**thegolding** (10): Tbh I don't really remember this one that much, I grew up with the Spanish version which was made by Ricky Martin so my score goes to him

**rickikardashian** (9.5): listening to this song not sang by Ricky Martin hurts me a little ngl

**J\_Toe** (9): tbh this is the only male-led disney movie to properly do the Princess story-line, complete with music such as this banger of an I want song

**junobeekeeper** (8.4): The instrumental bits are too long but it's still a good song.

**silentev** (8): I am a fan of the Disney songs that slowly build and end on a huge crescendo finish, ya know.

**skargardin** (8): We love a motivational anthem

**1998tweety** (7): Mariah Carey is not shook

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (7): It’s a sweet little song about overcoming adversity.

**pearllouise** (7): I’d go the distance too but i’m lazy

**vayyiqra** (7): i have never seen this movie but i like this

# STAYING AT HOME TO SLEEP

**ImADudeDuh** (5): one of the weakest inspirational ballads disney has had

**yourhostandpatron** (9): So, you know how Hunchback is my favourite Disney movie? There have been a lot of comparisons in between Rapunzel and Quasimodo before because of the whole being stuck in a tower by an abusive guardian plot point that the both of them have to endure, and seeing the parallels between Mother Knows Best and Out There and my own personal life makes me want to watch Tangled again...and cry. But I’m not going to get into that. Putting my personal life aside, this is my favourite song on Tangled; call me a boomer, but it’s the least poppy of the numbers in the movie, and the classical whimsy Menken exhibits here makes me feel as if we’re back in the renaissance again. It’s not the best villain song, but it’s still great.

# HAVING A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR MOTHER

**1998tweety** (10): WOW A mega bopt. This slays hard but I know y'all will do it dirty

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): This (and the reprise) is top notch villain music. Passive aggressive reprimanding for the win. And her subtle snarl at the end when telling Rapunzel to never ask to leave the tower again... brava Dr. Rosie Octavius, Brava!

**bespectacIed** (10): Idk why I have such affinity for female villains, they are always so cunty. This is such a cruel song but Mother Gothel IS queen shit, IDC, IDC!!! Donna Murphy slayed this, the movie animators slayed this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of the best villain songs, periodt! One of the creepiest songs if you dig deep enough into the psychology of the lyrics

**Steelstepladder** (10): Tangled is so much better than Frozen it's not even funny

**rickikardashian** (9.6): Honestly, mother gothel is one of the most real villains Disney has, because she isn't a witch, or a demon, instead she's the reality many people deal with, just a manipulative mother that only cares about herself and nothing else. This song, once you're old enough to understand how fucked up she truly is, gets 100 times creepier

**CarlieScion** (9): disney villains > disney heroes [2]

**nowqueenofpop** (9): THE DRAMATICS. The Broadway experience jumped out.

**SFbby** (9): Too catchy for a gaslighting song

**silentev** (9): This is the most terrifying, gaslighting song Disney has ever written masqueraded with lovely singing.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): This song used to scare me as a kid

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): def one of my fave villain songs

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This song and performance is BROADWAY caliber.

**junobeekeeper** (7.6): The theatrics of being a terrible, narcissistic guardian to your child.

**agentofscranton** (7.5): the other disney villains wish they could step up to Mother Gothel

**FluffyNobody** (7.5): Emotional manipulation 101

**jexan13** (7.5): "go ahead, fall for som f*ckboi who won't text you back"

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it’s well made but it makes me irrationally angry due to personal reasons

**vhqv1997** (8): The remake’s version of this was truly disatrous, but can we please appreciate that the original version was really great with wonderful harmony and production?

**yourhostandpatron** (6): I enjoyed this song a thousand times better in the stage play, since it takes place in front of a live audience and gives the performers’ voices the opportunity to fucking emote; within the actual film, however, I’m incredibly indifferent to its existence. The original version is just coated in so much disappointing blandness that I can’t form an attatchment to it even if the actual scene where it’s featured in is unquestionably iconic; yes, it’s beautiful, but can you really listen to this and deny that it was made for adult contemporary radio? One undeniably good thing I can say about it is that it marks the transition from the Lion King’s mediocre middle act to its fantastic ending, so that’s something to look forward to whenever I watch the movie and have to slog through the song again. Sorry, y’all.

# BEYONCE SWEETIE I'M SO SORRY

**bespectacIed** (10): beyoncé minus weakass donald glover vocals outsold. Iconic song but also birthed furry culture so it's a double edged sword

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): A song so perfect that Beyoncé actually made it worse

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): shout out to the live action remake that set this song during the fucking day how do fuck up that badly

# I LOVE WATCHING LIONS GET IT ON

**FluffyNobody** (10): The video is ~weird~, but the song? Nothing short of iconic

**napsandnetflix** (10): i saw elton john in vegas and this was the encore song and UGH the POWER this song has a KING

**pearllouise** (10): Oh yes, I do feel it

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): The last chorus is where it really picks up but damn does the song paint the most beautiful picture.

**Steelstepladder** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6zy51mvSD4

**vayyiqra** (9): i never noticed how weird the intro and outro are to this song but the chorus hits and the rest is so pretty i can't fault it too much

**rickikardashian** (8.5): There's some songs that would've benefitted from us rating the single versions of them, because as much as I love Timon and Pumba in the movie, I kinda am not enjoying this slow ballad with them sobbing in the background

**agentofscranton** (8): we love lion sex don't we girls?

**silentev** (7.5): Can you believe this was supposed to be sung completely by Timon and Pumba? I’m glad it wasn’t.

**1998tweety** (7): It's cute I guess

**jexan13** (7): i'm gonna pretend the shenanigans at the end of the song wasn't there. The song's cute

# NO THANKS I'M FINE WITH HUMAN SEX

**Tolk1en** (6): so boring

**anothertown** (5): timon is out here to oppress straights and eat bugs and nothing else

**J\_Toe** (5): tbh the most boring song from The Lion King. It's cool in the Boradway version though because the plants are people

**ManofOranges** (5): no i cannot

**NotWith10000Men** (5): the lemur brings it down a point

**skargardin** (5): Highkey Timon, Pumbaa and the backing vocalists did a better job here than Nala and Simba

**ImADudeDuh** (4): boring!

**vhqv1997** (11): I must confess. I always cry listening to this song or watching this scene. My mom is the person I admire and love most in the world, and any song about a mother-child relationship makes me emotional, but since this song has stuck with me for most of my childhood, I will always be biased toward it. This was day 3 at multiple points too, but sadly the more popular songs swooped in at the last minute and ruined it. Damn you all!!!

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Right now we're getting disappointingly low scores for this song and I don't even know why. Do you guys really hate Genesis that much? What did they ever do to you? Phil Collins is as good as dad rock can ever possibly get, guys. Just enjoy him already. I heard Another Day In Paradise on the radio the other day, and it was some great shit! Sorry, I don't actually know anything about Phil Collins. I just wanted to vent. This is too good of a song to be as low as it is as of writing! From what I can remember about the emotional and drama conflict of Tarzan, this encapsulates the themes of the movie perfectly; not only that, but it's deliberately written to make you feel as nostalgic as shit when you hear it without appealing too much to award show sensibilities. Just too good of a masterpiece to end the renaissance with. Everybody bow down to Phil.

# THOSE WITH A HEART

**junobeekeeper** (11): I can't believe that I'm giving Phil Collins my 11 but here we are. It's just such a beautiful song. I cannot express my love for it in any form except heart eye emojis so 😍😍😍

**tomservo88** (11): !

**agentofscranton** (10): tug at my heartstrings phil collins king

**bespectacIed** (10): phil collins' voice just wanna make you fall in love

**jexan13** (10): Not what I would expect from a Disney OST. It really feels like a great pop song, independent of any movie. The rock-like production and the unique vocals come together to form a great song and one of the best of this rate.

**pearllouise** (10): The Disney ballad Neyo wish he wrote

**SFbby** (10): Sweet song

**skargardin** (10): The implications that this song has, ugh

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): kala might be the GOAT disney mom

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): My mom loves this song... I think I’ll cry for a little bit and maybe call her after.

**FluffyNobody** (9): I did not remember this song and now I'm crying at work, good job Phil Collins

**rickikardashian** (8.5): My sister used to be obsessed with Tarzan, like, she would watch it multiple times a day, every single day, so the soundtrack is kinda engraved in my brain, and i feel like till the day I die, Phil Collins voice will take me back at me being 7 years old, having to watch Tarzan for the 3rd time a day with my sister

**silentev** (8): I’m not crying you’re crying!

**slimboyfriend** (7): Ok I know it's cheesy, but that doesn't stop me from shedding a single tear

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is also definitely a phil collins song

# HEARTLESS BASTARDS

**1998tweety** (6.5): This was a flop movie and we can tell why

**anothertown** (6): okay but......usher's version outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (4): yawn!

**vayyiqra** (4): nvm phil collins is back on his bullshit i really do not like his voice it's so nasal he is really just off-brand peter gabriel

**Steelstepladder** (3): The Phil Collins soundtrack to Tarzan is incredibly of its time and that's rare for Disney

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Poor Unfortunate Souls isn’t Disney’s first villain song, strictly speaking (justice for the World’s Greatest Criminal Mind, you rats) but it’s what exemplified the idea for audiences back in 1989, and it still makes some other villain songs tremble in its shadow today. I don’t use the word *tremble* lightly - Pat Caroll’s delightfully drag queen inspired performance here is fucking terrifying, which many people who participated in this rate no doubt commented on. It’s equal parts scary and campy, and that’s what makes it such a fantastic song. There are hardly any more brilliant examples of musical and lyrical dramatic tension in all of film and theatre than what Menken and Ashman created in this gem.

**vhqv1997** (9): I can’t wait for The Little Mermaid live-action movie to come out, along with Melissa McCarthy’s kickass rendition of this song to make everybody forget we used to be up in arms about this.

---

# PAT CARROLL STANS

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this is so damn good we stan, the vocals the story the production. The 2nd best villain song ever periodt (Hellfire wins and y'all know it). 3:50 serving Shallow

**bambamhenny** (10): i'm just biased towards villain songs but this honestly slaps, werq it you fat sea ho

**CarlieScion** (10): tbh ursula was 100% in the right here

**hikkaru** (10): ursula is a fucking QUEEN

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We want ginger minj to be her in the live action movie

**ManofOranges** (10): ursula did that

**rickikardashian** (10): Sometimes songs from musicals that leave the talking in the middle tend to be a bit boring because you need the visual elements to get a better experience, but damn, the voice acting and singing here is expressive enough that I can picture perfectly everything that is happening here. Ursula is a drag queen legend and is only fair for her to have one of the most extra and theatrical villain songs Disney has created

**skargardin** (10): This song is high camp done RIGHT, it's so incredibly theatrical

**Steelstepladder** (10): BO-DY LANG-AUGE

**bespectacIed** (9.5): ursula is the definition of queen shit!

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): without a doubt one of the best villain songs in the archive.

**nowqueenofpop** (9): Disney villains are literally legends like Ursula was the main attraction to The Little Mermaid for me… Much like Mother Gothel, I really adore how Disney villains use different tones and inflections and it elevates it from song to Performance! Let’s talk about the deeper societal meaning of this song…

**pearllouise** (9): Ursula and JLO have something in common: using other women’s voices as their own.

**anothertown** (8.5): pat carroll the legend, the god. my favorite disney villain song imo.. body language.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Ursula is the only one in this movie who knows how to have fun

**AvatarKanol** (8): The best song from The Little Mermaid. Villan songs always win.

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (8): One of the best villain songs, but not THE best

**junobeekeeper** (7.2): Is this the first villain banger we're rating? Ursula is my queen.

**jexan13** (7): This whole section is creepy and scary AF, and you can feel it in the song: "Yeah, keep singing". The chorus is iconic, too bad that the rest is too distracting, hurting its replaybility.

**SFbby** (7): Me

# MELISSA MCCARTHY STANS

**agentofscranton** (6.5): i wish i liked this more considering ursula is one of the great disney divas, but i’ve just never connected with it

**silentev** (6): She legitimately says laryngitis during the spell, doesn’t she?

**FluffyNobody** (5): Objectively I know it's great, but it's too creepy for me to like it

**NotWith10000Men** (5): it takes so long for ursula to really start singing

**sailormunelune** (5): The worst Disney villain song

**vayyiqra** (4): i do not remember this song at all and it's creepy and i am uneasy. it's good at being a creepy villainous song and musically it's not awful but i don't like it

**napsandnetflix** (3): usually disney songs take breaks for talking and it's like erm can you not - but this is literally talking with small breaks for singing so yeah this aint it chief

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): is this really a song or is it just ursula saying things really loudly

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I read recently that Howard Ashman was hesitant to work on Beauty and the Beast because he wanted to focus on Aladdin, which time unfortunately cut him short for. ...honestly, I think that shows in his work for Beauty and the Beast. The movie’s soundtrack is still...good, I guess? Looking past my nostalgia for it, though, I just don’t find the songs in the film to be as eloquent as they were in the Little Mermaid or as witty as they would be in Aladdin. Belle is a great example of this. I used to love it, and I can still sing along to it if I’m in the mood, but now I just find its length and numerous interruptions to be annoying if I’m listening to it without watching Beauty and the Beast in itself. I’m going to have to tag it as a tad bit overrated...but, with that being said, it still has its charms if I listen hard enough. Bonjour? Bonjour! Bonjour!

**vhqv1997** (7): This song made no sense without the visual context. I truly don’t understand how it made it this far, but I guess it wasn’t right to ask people to rate songs objectively anyway.

---

**DanMcMissile** (11): The pinnacle of Disney songs, a perfect marriage of orchestration and Paige O'Hara and Richard White's soaring vocals amidst all the hustle and bustle of the townfolk.

**1998tweety** (10): Lit rally one of the best opening actual songs in a Disney OST. Vocals jumped and the instrumentation is a 10.

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): I’m pretty obsessed with this song, not gonna lie. You remember that viral video where that dude did this song perfectly including all of the weird villager voices? Yeah that’s me every time I hear this song.

**CarlieScion** (10): my favorite disney film as a kid

**pearllouise** (10): Emma Watson? I don’t know her.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): If the town thinks Belle is weird now bc she reads books wait til they find out she’s a furry too

**thegolding** (10): Oh honey I think WE ALL want more than this provintial life

**jexan13** (9.5): what do u have against the baker, belle?

**brenda\_official** (9): I NEED SIX EGGS

**skargardin** (9): My connection with the beauty and the beast movie is next to non-existent, I honestly dont know why I never watched it as as kid, but this does slap

**rickikardashian** (8.5): I've always found kinda funny how usually princesses have this solo song for them to belt, and besides the little reprise of this song, Belle has to sing this song with the company of the entire village. [Also I can't hear this song without thinking of this tweet](https://twitter.com/DanaSchwartzzz/status/875524942053466112?s=20)

**ignitethephoenix** (8): belle drags shallow and uneducated people: the song

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the amount of shade thrown in this song lmao

**slimboyfriend** (8): Disney made an entire song about how Belle isn't like other girls because she reads books. Bonjour Bitch!

**vayyiqra** (8): k this is just pure and wholesome wtf i love belle now (not you though gaston)

**silentev** (7): Great job at exposition and character study for the big players.

**Steelstepladder** (7): Sets the scene for the movie perfectly well

**anothertown** (6.5): i like the "oh isn't this amazing" part where she is reading the book with the sheep

**NotWith10000Men** (6): when she said "every day like the one before" i fucking felt that

**junobeekeeper** (4.8): hhhhh it's just so… bland

**vhqv1997** (9.5): At one point before the most last-minute of last-minute ballots rushed in, this song and Let It Go tied at the #17 spots, and I laughed my ass off because for all the discourse around Frozen and Tangled, their most iconic songs respectively ended up in the same spot anyway, but welp, Frozen won, folk.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Okay, I used to make fun of this for resembling A Whole New World throughout my entire childhood, but in hindsight I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I See The Light is way too pretty to be an act of laziness on Alan Menken’s part; despite the obvious resemblance between certain lines, most especially both songs’ uses of the phrase ‘crystal clear’, this feels original and genuine enough to be just as good as the other Disney duet between a prince and a princess in a comedic movie that everybody knows and loves. This is just yet another confirmation that by the time Tangled was released, Disney was ushering in a new golden age again; that age has probably ended by now, judging by preliminary reviews of Frozen 2, but that revival sure is a nice sentiment.

---

# SAW THE LIGHT

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): I’m not even exaggerating I sobbed while relistening to this song for the rate. This song is just a masterpiece and one of the many reasons why Tangled is my favorite Disney movie

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): Anybody else cry behind their 3D glasses watching this in theaters a decade ago or was it just me? All right, then....

**bespectacIed** (10): I am a classic Disney kid but I think this is favorite my Disney song and scene ever. The catharsis of this scene, the lights, the heartbreaking lyrics, mandy moore and zach levi's voices, everything makes me so emotional. This is Disney animation and music at their finest: creating not just movie scenes or songs, but MOMENTS.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): might be my favorite disney duet honestly

**pearllouise** (10): Mandy Moore has really improved since her debut. Only if Liam Payne could do the same.

**SFbby** (10): Uhhh 2romantic4me

**FluffyNobody** (9): Teenage me was obsessed with this

**silentev** (9): A superior Disney romance song with amazing lyrics and emotion.

**Steelstepladder** (9): One of my favorite Disney ballads and deserves to be up there with the classics

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Mandy Moore has the perfect disney princess voice. Zachary Levi is pretty good too.

**1998tweety** (8): Sorry to ballads but this kinda is a snooze, it never hit me.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Tangled said "A Whole New World... 2!" https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e90a3f354d94d9d3c128e21787d7d14/tumblr_inline_pbbd6fURZ01r2vvqk_540.gif

**J\_Toe** (8): needs to be remastered with Broadway instrumentals. It could stand up against the music from Disney's Renaissance if that were the case.

**nowqueenofpop** (8): The beauty of protagonist-love interest duets continues!

**thegolding** (8): So cute. Don't forget to stream Mandy's new music

# BLIND

**jexan13** (6.5): it's cute but it's one of the worst "main" movie tracks.

**agentofscranton** (6): such a damp tissue of a song. the soundtrack is the only criticism I have of tangled as a film - otherwise it would easily be my number one disney film.

**CarlieScion** (6): cute i guess

**junobeekeeper** (5.8): It's a nice ballad, but not a great one. Still, I need to say that I adore Mandy Moore regardless because I have a soul.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): A snooze of a ballad. The 90s has A Whole New World, and the 2010s has..... this.

**vayyiqra** (5): maybe it's because i've been rating all these songs i've never heard before (well i have once but i forget it) but i am finding it hard to rate anything accurately right now but this is nothing special i feel it's like a whole new world but mediocre

**vhqv1997** (10): Any woke film buff would stan Amy Adams for her dedication to the art of acting and the constant snubberies by the Academy. But while everyone else would stan her for Nocturnal Animals, Arrival, The Master, or Junebug, only the gays would stan her for Enchanted, which is the FIRST exptectations-subverting Disney movie. This movie laid itself on barbed wires for Tangled, Frozen and the others to be made. And you can trust that Anna would still be frolicking with Hans in a straight-to-DVD Frozen sequel had it not been for Enchanted’s underappreciated progressiveness.

---

**ManofOranges** (10): amy adams gets paid dust way too often

**rickikardashian** (10): enchanted feels like a fever dream I had where I dreamt a Disney movie, but turns out it is real, it just happens that Disney never acknowledges it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I thought this movie was a weird fever dream I had until now

**junobeekeeper** (9.2): Enchanted is one of the best romcoms. I said what I said.

**SFbby** (9): Watching Amy Adams portray an innocent yet independent princess advocating for love is a delight

**ImADudeDuh** (8): cute

**silentev** (7.5): The whole idea of this song as a parody of other Disney romance songs is great but becomes very busy as it progresses.

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (7): They truly pulled off the perfect catchy parody of Disney love songs with this.

**vayyiqra** (7): this is weird but kind of a bop and amy adams can sing?? shook. i'm rating this highly mainly because she's really cute in this scene probably because otherwise i would find it really annoying

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Prince Ali is the catchiest, the greatest, and unfortunately the last example of Howard Ashman’s tendency to make use of bizarre lyrical comparisons, cram them all into one Alan Menken-penned song, and still manage to create a masterpiece. When you couple that pair together with Robin Williams, there’s just so much you can do, and all of it pays off just so wonderfully in this number that it’s not very hard to see why people see it as one of the most insidious Disney songs by pure virtue of the fact that it’s incredibly difficult not to sing along to it. A perfect symbiosis of melodical craziness and fantastical animation.

**1998tweety** (10): BOPT

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): I used to never make it past this scene. I’d rewind the shiiit out of the vhs to see this part for well over an hour... hell I just put the song back on while I’m writing this. Also anybody who thinks the live action version compares to this is just wrong.

**fortyfive33** (10): They really pulled off the a joke about TV anchors in a movie set in roughly medieval Arabia. Only here.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favourite songs from my childhood. It’s just super fun.

**ManofOranges** (10): there has never been a more iconic line than "don't they look lovely june" or "fabulous harry I love the feathers"

**rickikardashian** (10): This is so amazing, but no matter how many times I listen to this, in the final lines I still hear ["Cuz Bush was crazy, Obama's lazy, Al Qaeda is not in this country, set free my prince Ali"](https://youtu.be/diU70KshcjA)

**silentev** (10): Robin is the reason this song is perfection.

**vayyiqra** (10): MAKE WAAAAAY for this hot take on this song. this rating might seem absurd but i just find this song hilarious; literally all of the lyrics are making up random stuff and shitposting about how awesome prince ali is, when prince ali doesn't even exist, and it's trying to puff him up as this awesome suitor and ironically it makes jasmine think he's a fuckboy and like him even less, which only makes it funnier. it's a catchy song too (i love how dramatic the intro is and the sudden tonal shift to the much goofier verses) and it has this wild chaotic energy so i am embodying that a bit by making the chaotic decision to give it a 10

**hikkaru** (9): me trying to hit the notes after the key change

**Krogan\_Whisperer** (9): The superior Genie song

**pearllouise** (9): Still better than Will Smith.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): "He's got the monkeys! LET'S SEE THE MONKEYS!!"

**ImADudeDuh** (8): down with imperialism

**NotWith10000Men** (8): tag yourself i'm jasmine's visible disgust

**Steelstepladder** (8): A bop and a half

**napsandnetflix** (7): this song bops but it reminds me too much of playing an aladdin medley in high school band so I can't enjoy it I get PTSD over it like I was in fucking Whiplash even though it was overall an enjoyable experience I just hated band lol but stayed in it for the Cuba trip it was worth it tho

**junobeekeeper** (6.2): I prefer One Jump Ahead

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): me pretending to be a princess with my imaginary friends

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I mean, I’m not gonna lie, there are some times when I listen to this and it doesn’t hit just as well as it should, which may or may not loop me into thinking it’s overrated, but as of now I’m going to have to pick one of the two wolves inside me and say that, yes, it’s one of Disney’s most entertaining big assemble songs, along with perhaps being the most joyous moment of the Little Mermaid. It also...it also makes me...close read...the movie’s binary opposition of sea and myth against land and humanity...and it makes me wonder...what are the implications of that binary? Sebastian says that ‘under the sun, they slave away’...are the humans in the Little Mermaid supposed to stand for labour under modern day liberalism? Are the mermaids and the sea creatures supposed to stand for a magical and medieval past that Ariel chooses to reject at the end of the movie? Look, there’s textual evidence for this, in Part of Your World she associates humans with learning and progressivism in the lines...yes, I know this comment is getting too long, just allow me to be a literature student here, okay?

**1998tweety** (10): Another 10, this truly is the best out of the early Disney princess movies.

**agentofscranton** (10): invented calypso

**J\_Toe** (10): I loved playing this on Kingdom Hearts!

**pearllouise** (10): Sean Paul outsold

**skargardin** (10): A bop to end all other bops

**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): Not going to lie, I really wanted to move under the sea after this song.

**FluffyNobody** (9): The melody is so infectious

**rickikardashian** (9): Growing up listening to the Spanish version of this song, I never had heard this version truly, and all I got to say is that Disney truly made sure to make Sebastian's accent as thick as possible, to the point that I low-key feel like it's mocking

**slimboyfriend** (9): Spitting straight fire like "under the sea we off the hook"

**bespectacIed** (8.5): iconic song but that's one horrible jamaican french hybrid accent

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Catchy af, whew

**Lyd\_euh** (8): my friend and I used to sing this in highschool all the time. Drove my teacher insane

**silentev** (8): One of the more fun, unique sounding Disney songs.

**jexan13** (6.5): Kingdom Hearts got the damn instrumental of this drilled into my brain. Sadly, the addition of vocals does not work in favor of the song, despite the amazing tune.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): a fun little song. i love listening for all the background instruments

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): sebastian’s right the human world is a mess

**Steelstepladder** (5): Swim this way we'll dance and we'll play

**vayyiqra** (5): i am giving this a 5 because i can't tell how i feel about it. it's very catchy, but it's also too meme-y for me to take it seriously, and that dude's vocals get annoying before long; but it is fun for what it is
