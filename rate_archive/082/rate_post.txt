Good morning, everyone! I am currently writing this rate post on Google Docs in Comic Sans font with under four hours of sleep, because college has made me lose all control of my life. Fortunately for me, along with everybody else stuck in the same throughs of adult existence, we’ll be taking a magic carpet ride back to our childhoods in this month’s Disney Animated Classics rate! Ask yourself these questions: Have you ever wanted to give an 11 to your favourite song from the Aladdin soundtrack? Have you ever wondered whether the twinks on this subreddit prefer which gay-coded villain anthem between Be Prepared or Poor Unfortunate Souls? Have you ever harboured the deep desire to rant about how overplayed Let It Go was back in 2014 and seal the deal by giving it a 0? 

Have no fear; bring your nostalgia meters up, because this rate is going to give you the opportunity to do just that. Have I caught your interest? Are you getting flashbacks to ye olde innocent days finding Hidden Mickeys now? If so, we have a solid lineup of the most memorable classics from Disney’s official list of movies ready to compete for the title of the best song in the canon, so let’s get down to business and start this rate!

**The Songs**:

First, before y’all start raising your pitchforks, we’re going to have to explain how we picked all of the songs you’ll see below. During the process of preparing for this rate, we decided to only pick songs from the Disney Animated Canon, which is a range of predominantly animated feature films released in cinema that spans from Snow White And The Seven Dwarves to Wreck-it-Ralph 2 (with Frozen 2 being the next in line). It’s often split into several eras, although we’re not getting into that complex history here. For this, we picked the most iconic songs from the most iconic films, which include:

1. Someday My Prince Will Come - Adriana Caselotti (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) \[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLQ2sYxktMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLQ2sYxktMQ)\]

These are the fifty plus songs that we’ll be rating; no more, and no less. Cast your ballots in, and we’ll eventually see which ones come out on top around the holiday season! Will Colors of the Wind have the highest controversy score? Will a song released before 1990 actually do well in the rankings? Only you, dear raters, can steer the course of fate.

**Bonus Rate**:

‘Hold up,’ you, a man, woman, or nonbinary person of culture say, grumbling, ‘Where’s Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious? Where’s You’ve Got A Friend In Me? Where’s Jack’s Lament? Where’s the song Rascal Flatts sang in Cars? You can’t just eliminate songs because Disney determined the movies they came from to not be profitable enough to be in the canon! Bootlicker!’

Calm down, calm down. While it’s true that the main rate is only based on animated features from Disney’s official canon for the sake of formality, we do agree that the songs you just mentioned should be given the chance to shine! Except for the Rascal Flatts song. That one sucks. What are you into, Cars erotica? Anyway, we’ve come up with ten additional songs for an optional rate below:

1. I 2 I - Tevin Campbell (A Goofy Movie) 
 
2. Jack's Lament - Danny Elfman (The Nightmare Before Christmas)  

3. Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious - Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke (Mary Poppins)  

4. You've Got A Friend In Me - Randy Newman (Toy Story)  

5. When She Loved Me - Sarah McLachlan (Toy Story 2)  

6. If I Didn't Have You - John Goodman, Billy Crystal (Monsters, Inc.)  

7. That's How You Know - Amy Adams (Enchanted)  

8. Immortals - Fall Out Boy (Big Hero 6)  

9. Remember Me - Benjamin Bratt (Coco)  

10. Touch The Sky - Julie Fowlis (Brave)

Yes, we couldn’t include everything here, which sucks, but unlike Wordpress blogs from 2011 made by nerds, none of us have the time to rate anything broader of a scope. Maybe you can post your own thoughts on your favourite piece of music from obscure Disney movies such as Herbie’s Wild Ride some other time!

Naturally, the bonus rate isn’t required, but you might get...an additional prize if you do it. Haha, just kidding...unless? 

**The Rules**:

- Please listen to every song listed (excluding the bonus rate, which is optional) and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). You can use up to one decimal place, although I recommend only using integers and multiples of 0.5, because Aristotle did not invent the Principle of the Golden Mean just for you to giggle and give some random song a 6.9. We won’t stop you, though. 

- You may give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11). These should be reserved for your least favourite track and favourite track, respectively. You are NOT required to leave a comment for these songs, but 0s and 11s are very powerful and very infamous, so don’t say we didn’t warn you if a bunch of people start calling you out for dropping a 0 bomb on Circle of Life. 

- You must use the prepared link to send in your scores.

- Feel free to PM me or my cohost (u/vhqv1997) on Reddit if you'd like to change any of your scores. We also sometimes frequent the official Popheads Discord under the names of Patron and Henry.

- If the hosts determine a ballot to be obvious sabotage, then we reserve the right to reject your scores or make fun of you. 

- You can also add comments to any song! The following format is the only acceptable format for song comments:

> I’ll Make A Man Of You: 11 I’ll make a man out of anybody else who gives this song a high score hahaha ;)

Any of the following formats are INCORRECT, and must be CORRECTED/ Otherwise, your ballot will be REJECTED just like how your crush rejected YOU back in high school, back when you hated Disney movies and you thought they were lame. 

> Let It Go: 1 - Why can’t we as a society let this song go

> When Will My Life Begin?: One day I was shopping at Target and Mandy Moore walked up to me and asked me to stream Candy before flicking my vagina, which is why I’m giving this a 1.

> I Won’t Say (I’m In Love): I’m a classics historian from Cambridge and I detest the way Hercules butchers Greek mythology 1

> Can You Feel the Love Tonight?: (1) My grandfather died the day after I watched the Lion King show I did not feel the love that night

> God Help The Outcasts: 1: In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god's blessing, but because I am enlightened by my intelligence. 

The due date is as of yet undetermined, but due to one host having rather torturous finals up ahead of him, and the other host having a tight work schedule, the rate will most likely be revealed around mid-to-late December; please try submitting before them. 

Thanks to everybody doing this rate! This is our first time hosting, so we hope it’ll be really fun.
