**yourhostandpatron** (10): I'll tell you all a secret; this is a song that I admire so much for its beauty to the point where I'd have to call it a serious contender for my favourite Disney number of all time. Everything here is incredibly gorgeous, from Tiana's wonderful singing to the amazing art style that accompanies it within the movie itself, and although Princess and the Frog may have its flaws, gems in it that are as good as this entire song make me lost in nostalgia for the glories and the wonders of traditional animation, and make me feel sad inside for pretty much just the same reasons. But even looking past that, Almost There is yet another song in the canon that appeals to me; in recent years, I've begun to relate to Tiana to any other Disney Princess bar none except Mulan. The excitement she expressed over nearly achieving the goal of her dreams after a floodful of hard work and perseverance not only stops at stirring up emotions deep within me, but also gives me bursts of inspirations that remind me to always keep the possibility of my own happy ending in mind whenever I feel too tired to go on, too. All things considered, I have a hard time making a song (or a princess) more underappreciated.
 
---
 
**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this is so damn good, the vocals the story we fucking stan.
 
**bambamhenny** (10): Amazing, the scene from the movie is one of my favorite parts and the song just encourages me to work harder
 
**bespectacIed** (10): *whitney houston voice* i like to listen to gospel
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): And people say Millenials are lazy
 
**J\_Toe** (10): as much as all I Want songs are about what the hero doesn't yet have, this song hits a little harder.
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Tiana is an icon, love the way the animation style changes here too
 
**nowqueenofpop** (10): The Princess and the Frog soundtrack is criminally underrated with hit after hit after hit and 2020 will be the year that we appreciate it for what it is. Of all the princesses, Tiana’s actress gave one of top 3 performances!
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Yeah the song is good but what I’m REALLY giving this 10 to is the animation during this sequence it’s so beautiful! Probably the prettiest animation in any Disney movie and I would kill for them to make an entire movie in that style
 
**waluigiest** (10): I hadn’t seen this movie until a month ago but it’s really Disney excellence
 
**agentofscranton** (9.5): this song almost makes me want to make something of myself. Almost.
 
**rickikardashian** (9.3): Honestly, Tiana has been my favorite Disney princess since the movie came out. I love that Disney encourages to follow your dreams and wish for the better, but I don't think they ever made so much emphasis on the fact that you need to put in the work to make your own dreams happen, and that's one of the best messages you can give young kids. Also, I really loved her relationship with Lottie. I'm so used to having rich, ditzy characters be the assholes of the story, so seeing her being so supportive of Tiana warmed up my heart
 
**FluffyNobody** (9): Aaaaaah the jazzy tone of this chef's kiss
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (8): it’s no ‘When We’re Human’ but man is it a good time.
 
**pearllouise** (8): Tiana is the first black Disney princess. Ariana could never.
 
**SFbby** (8): This song is almost there
 
**junobeekeeper** (7.8): Good song, even better movie.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): i love her voice
 
**silentev** (7): The singing here is so quaint and lovely, I wish the music was a little stronger to back it up.
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): Disney instilling a Capitalist work ethic into children
 
**anothertown** (6): deserved better smh
 
**skargardin** (6): Made some points, some
 
**vayyiqra** (6): i have never heard this in my life but it's alright
 
**Steelstepladder** (4): Sadly forgettable

**yourhostandpatron** (7): I want to analyze (™) the lyrics here where Lumiere sings about the enchanted objects’ need to serve as members of the Beast’s castle, because there are some obvious implications to nitpick in there, but I’m trying not to make my comments for this rate as political as I possibly can, so let’s just ignore that. I do love this song’s hook/chorus thanks to our favourite candlestick’s voice being positively lovely, but its the parts in between are...eh, not as great. Again, this isn’t as good as it normally would be without the benefit of the film’s imagery (which is supposed to be expected for a movie soundtrack, but I believe that songs like Friend Like Me and Prince Ali are snazzy enough to stand on their own and this...isn’t).

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic shit, that's all I'm gonna say on that.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): julia child wishes she could do it like lumiere does it, literally invented french cuisine
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): I still want to try the grey stuff and see how fucking delicious it is.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): iconique
 
**FluffyNobody** (10): I don't even like the French accent but this is tres jolie
 
**fortyfive33** (10): Is this song technically great? Who knows, but it makes me smile every time I hear it.
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): the peak of the Disney Renaissance
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): be our bop fuck this song pops the fuck off
 
**rickikardashian** (10): During my exchange year, I made a French friend, and everytime I saw her I serenaded her with the French version of this song. Problem is, I don't know a word of French, and have no fucking clue how to even pronounce anything, so this song will always remind me of her laughing her ass off because I couldn't understand the complicated and fucking nonsensical rules of French
 
**pearllouise** (9): Lumiere can light my wussy on fire anytime
 
**skargardin** (9): Slapper
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This one is too fun for me to ever dislike
 
**anothertown** (8): WHAT a bop. they really decided to make a spectacle for gay people and they did, rip howard ashman.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): why does this slap when its just a lesser version of the tipton commercial song from Suite Life of Zack and Cody?
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8): it gets kinda frenetic at the end and i love it. big les mis vibes.
 
**Steelstepladder** (8): See my vest, see my vest, made from real gorilla
 
**vayyiqra** (8): i'm having a hard time being unbiased after the absurd parody it got on the simpsons but it's definitely catchy and a classic so fuck it
 
**nowqueenofpop** (7): In addition to the Disney villains, the sidekicks give great performances to. As Lumière says, they live to serve!
 
**silentev** (6.5): This song is upbeat and fun but that’s just about it.
 
**SFbby** (6): I wish I had dishes that cleaned themselves
 
**junobeekeeper** (5.6): No, absolutely not. It's probably the best Beauty and the Beast song though, which doesn't say much.
 
**bespectacIed** (5): this anthropomorphic furniture slavery nightmare of a song has no business being this upbeat
 
**J\_Toe** (5): does this sample/interpolate the same song as See My Vest from the Simpsons?
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): would you guys kill me if i said i like the remake version of this song better than the original? bc the original sounds too flat too me to be enjoyable

**vhqv1997** (10): A truly dark horse contestant. I personally would have wanted it to go even further to flex on everyone, but this position is enough to cement that r/popheads actually has taste sometimes
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): A lot of people only remember the music of Lilo and Stitch from the duo's fondness of Elvis, but instead of remembering creepy white men today, I think we ought to remember what a joy Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride was to us children. Even past the simple fact that surfboarding in itself is really, really awesome, can we just appreciate the fact that this is pretty much the first Disney song on the soundtrack of a film about a cultural minority that's actually performed by that cultural minority? Of course, we should refrain from praising mega corporations for playing into identity politics, but in the context of the films in the canon alone that's already such a big relief. Finally, as somebody who also lives on an island in the Pacific, even if this song is a bit too repetitive for me, there's something about it that I can't help but loving. It's so peaceful in it's celebration of the wind and waves. Just more confirmation that out of all Disney's 00s work pre-PatF, Lilo and Stitch is, by far and away, the most iconic.

**bambamhenny** (11): GIVE HRCR YOUR 11s. I REPEAT. GIVE 11. A masterpiece. Mozart WISHES 😫 he could make a bop this good. The ICONIQUE opening 👀, the choir 👌, the call-response 🕺, the iressistible jammability 🤯, y'all other girlies could NEVAH 🤧

**silentev** (8): This song exudes happiness!

**fortyfive33** (7): the seven is purely for nostalgia
 
**skargardin** (7): Whenever i think of lilo and stitch my mind doesnt really go to the music but this is a bop
 
**vayyiqra** (7): why does lilo & stitch have only one song in this rate this is a bop even though the lyrics are weird (the ones that i can understand anyway) but then lilo & stitch was a weird movie so it fits
 
**jexan13** (5): i already forgot how this sound like
 
**Lyd\_euh** (5): Lilo and Stitch is underrated, but I don't love this song

**vhqv1997** (9): Thankfully not that many people brought up Ariana’s and John Legend’s duet of this. The faster we forget about it, the better.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (7): It’s a beautiful song in its own right; my mind immediately associates it with the ballroom dancing scene from the movie where Belle wears that iconic yellow dress, which is a huge boon for this number, since it only really works for people who don’t obsessively listen to adult contemporary radio if you remember the beautiful 2D CGI that accompanies it in the film. Sadly, this is...just...not...hitting right now. I’m not sure why. It’s probably because Beauty and the Beast has gone from being one of my favourite Disney movies to just disappointing me, in general. Perhaps my days of dreaming of Belle’s life are now over.

# HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (11): This is it. This is the song that keeps me believing love can happen to anyone.
 
**1998tweety** (10): Popheads hates ballads but you can stay.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): ariana grande and john legend wish they had the range that the lady from murder she wrote has
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): The power angela lansbury has..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... we have to stan
 
**jexan13** (10): I'm literally shaking
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): god what a BEAUTIFUL song imagine thinking this is less than like an 8 like the meth crisis must be out of control because this is unreal ugh when they're dancing around the ballroom i can NOT
 
**thegolding** (10): Angela Lansburry and Celine sang this at first, what makes John Legend think he can come any close to that. Ariana was kinda cool tho
 
**Tolk1en** (10): its a 11 in my heart
 
**SFbby** (9): Someone rich please kidnap me
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): God I fucking love this movie
 
**silentev** (8.5): A classic Disney romance song and Angela Lansbury is perfection.
 
**pearllouise** (8): Two points deducted for bestiality
 
**rickikardashian** (7.6): I don't know if I'm thinking of another version of this song, but I honestly remembered it bigger and more powerful, like, I remember an orchestra, high notes, a male voice, and a full extra minute to this. This version isn't bad, but compared to whatever I'm thinking of, this felt underwhelming
 
**bespectacIed** (7): All the legendaric-ness of this song stems from celine and peabo's ethereal vocals, sorry to this woman (legendary angela lansbury)
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): Covers of this song are way better than the original
 
**J\_Toe** (7): this is so random but once I saw a story on reddit about a woman who went to a pet shop in tears because her eel jumped out of its fishbowl and rather than tossing it back in she tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (? with a being that lives underwater) and it died, and the story was dubbed "The Dipshit and the Eel". That's what I always think of when I hear this song.
 
**selegend** (7): this teapot has pipes
 
**skargardin** (7): There are better disney ballads than this, personally i've never connected much with it at all even though it is good
 
**Steelstepladder** (7): I hate just giving this a seven cause BatB is one of my favorite Disney movies but there are better ballads from the renaissance
 
**vayyiqra** (7): i remember playing this in music class and it's very melodic and pleasant but i am on popheads so i am contractually obligated to not vote too high for a ballad (this is a joke)
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): angela can sing but... stockholm syndrome....
 
# STOCKHOLM'S SYNDROME + BEASTIALITY
 
**nowqueenofpop** (6): This would be an 8 easily if it was sung by someone else
 
**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I must not have a heart because this song does almost nothing for me
 
**junobeekeeper** (5.1): It's a sweet sentiment but I could live without it.

**yourhostandpatron** (10): How incredibly timely this rate is! By the time we reveal this one’s position in late December and y’all get mad, Frozen 2 should have reached its peak of popularity. I think all of us got caught up in a cycle of loving this, hating it due to oversaturation, and then loving it all over again in between 2013 and the present; I definitely did, but when I hear how deliciously similar to Defying Gravity this song is yet realize what much of a fucking spectacle is at the same time, I find it incredibly hard to, well, let it go. It’s a brilliant song that might deserve to be called one of the best of the decade in general. It also hits really hard for me lyrically, again; people have seen Elsa’s ice powers as a metaphor for being queer before, and I can totally see the validity of that interpretation, but personally? I always saw Elsa as somebody who was neurodivergent, especially since her backstory of being locked up in a room and her fear of messing up in front of everybody and revealing her true self literally happened to me, too. The way she proceeds to give no more fucks at the end and make an ice castle of her own away from everybody else is just...empowering. I wish I could do that.
 
**vhqv1997** (9.5): Lmao this song’s placements throughout the rate were hilariously chaotic. I mean, look at this [GRAPH]( https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/601740430098300949/657854108522512384/unknown.png), and it was just the first 37 ballots, we have 55 participants. Thankfully, there was more circlejerk than anti-circlejerk, and this song made it to top 15, as it deserves. For all the overplay shit, this song is still a gigantic masterpiece. And you know what, you wouldn’t be able to fawn over Show Yourself for long either when the video is released on YouTube and every single kid is screaming it on the plane.

# IDINA MENZEL IS A GODDESS
 
**jexan13** (11): I remember listening to this song for the first time and getting so obsessed, listening it on other languages and all that. This song is amazing and breathtaking. Lyrically and musically. I swear that if POPheads destroy this song because it was popular...
 
**Tolk1en** (11): Best thing Disney has ever done; talent, vocals, great melody, lyrics, amazing video. A 11 and I don't want to hear anything else.
 
**1998tweety** (10): I feel like this is gonna be the most controversial song here, but it's genuinely a bop. Not to mention a gay coded BOP. The reason why everyone stans it is cause it slaps hard. Wish I had another 11 to give this.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): this - and the other frozen songs - are totally gonna get tanked for overexposure, but that doesn't change what a MOMENT this song is. it captures the old-school disney magic in a way that Tangled and the Princess and the Frog just couldn't. Adele Dazeem absolutely killed this.
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): I don’t care what y’all say or how overplayed it got, this songs a modern classic and deserved the following it received.
 
**bespectacIed** (10): It's so hard to objectively score a song that has become so much larger than life. Do I rate the song removed from its cultural phenomenon status? Or do I rate with the dread and disgust that accompanies hearing this song the 8937272nd time??? I don't even know if this score's right, I don't even know if I like this song, or if I ever liked this song in the first place. BUT FUCK IT, IT'S ICONIC.
 
**DanMcMissile** (10): I will not tolerate any Frozen slander whatsoever, this song is the best thing that ever happened and y'all know it.
 
**hikkaru** (10): all the frozen songs included here absolutely slap and I hope they're not sabotaged bc the movie was so enormous and let it go was a legitimate hit
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): yes, kids annoyed you with this, but this has ltierally been a 10 the entire time.
 
**J\_Toe** (10): deserves it's cultural impact and every replay it ever got
 
**ManofOranges** (10): despite the overplay when frozen came out i must recognize that this song is very good
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): tbh i'll be annoyed if this wins but also it's so good i can't give it less than a 10 but do your thing contrarians i'm counting on you
 
**rickikardashian** (10): Idina has terrorized my life with this and Defying Gravity. Both are amazing songs and she sings like no one else, but I swear to God I'll kill someone if I have to hear another one of my cousins sing Let it Go, or watch another theater kid try to scream Elphaba's last notes
 
**SFbby** (10): Has this song been overplayed a gazillion times? Yes. Does it still make you want to let it go and sing at the top of your lungs? YES.
 
**skargardin** (10): Will probably get sabotaged even though it's absolutely exquisite but oh well
 
**thegolding** (10): Idina Menzel can use me as her rug and jump and I'd say thanks. We stan a Jewish Broadway diva. Frozen is the only soundtrack from Disney's new era that I can admit is almost as good as the classics
 
**TragicKingdom1** (10): The runner-up for my 11. Despite its immense commercial success I still think this one is underrated. It has the most dramatic swell of any other song of this rate, and I think that quality allows it to greatly stand alone without the help of the film from which it originates.
 
**waluigiest** (10): frozen has its issues but this song is excellent. Idina killed it!!!
 
**vayyiqra** (9): yes this is a basic take i don't care this is a great song end of comment
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Overplayed but iconic. Adele Dazeem killed it for sure!
 
**junobeekeeper** (8): Admittedly this song was soooo overplayed and all that but it's very good. Adele Dazeem snapped!
 
**nowqueenofpop** (8): This is actually not Idina’s best vocal performance (please see the reprise) but it has definitely grown on me after watching Frozen 25 times this summer. It needed 3 years between the overexposure and now to be really appreciated
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): Huh. Defying Gravity sure sounds different than what I remember
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Is it over played to all hell? Absolutely. But does it still bop? Also absolutely
 
**silentev** (7.5): I have never seen Frozen but I have had to hear this song over and over again to the point I can’t judge it objectively anymore.
 
**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7.5): demi's version is so much better tbh
 
**Steelstepladder** (7): Absolutely fine as a centerpiece for the movie
 
# ADELE DAZEEM
 
**brenda\_official** (6): couldnt name a more annoying song but its ok i guess
 
**Lyd\_euh** (6): I'm sorry, I know this is a good song objectively but it's an ear worm and I HATE those. It was way overhyped.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5): there is an argument for 0. and an argument for 10. so let's go with 5 and skip this song.
 
**jess\_22** (4): the fact that this was inescapable for three years has made it unlistenable
 
**pearllouise** (3): I’d give this a higher rating if I wasn’t babysitting two young girls through 2014
 
**letsallpoo** (0): this song inspired me to support capital punishment

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I have a slight problem with Robin Williams’ enunciation here (I am aware that this is probably a heretical opinion, so feel free to murder me now, I know that I deserve it) but everything else about this is such a glorious full-blast display of omnipotence and absolute insanity made suitably fun for the whole family that I’ve had it stuck in my head all the time ever since I began doing this rate. Fuck, I’d even go as far as to say that it represents Aladdin just as well as A Whole New World. An absolutely gobsmacking, wonderous masterpiece.
 
---
 
**fortyfive33** (11): They straight up out-Broadway'd Broadway. Forget going from 0-60. This starts at 60 and doesn't stop. Robin Williams was the perfect outsize personality and voice for an absolutely bonkers song and sequence.
 
**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Saving the possible exception of Let It Go (and what a tight race that is indeed), this is, without any other contest, the best Disney song of the 2010s. It’s almost as ambitious in lyrical content as Almost There is, but thanks to Moana’s personality, there’s an aura of curiosity here that’s incredibly hard not to get affected by; nothing else wants to make me go out ahead and achieve everything in life AND see the world at the same time than the way Moana sings the last chorus. Will I actually do that? No, but either way, this song is gold!
 
---
 
**letsallpoo** (11): this is the greatest song of all time
 
**NotWith10000Men** (11): i can't overstate how much i love this fucking song. the melody. the rhyme scheme. the lyrics. i'm gonna go watch the movie again.
 
**1998tweety** (10): Ugh queen, we love the vocals on this we love the lyrics.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): let it go walked so how far i'll go could become the flash. absolutely the greatest disney song post-renaissance. auli'i cravalho deserves so much success.
 
**bespectacIed** (10): this is just Let it Go 2.0 but I've always thought this was a bit better. Also I'm gonna complain because that's just how I am: why tf didn't we rate We Know The Way???? It's the best disney imposition song since Circle of Life
 
**hikkaru** (10): toad ate his cover of this
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): deserved the oscar over that shit whitey Bla Bla Bland movie
 
**jexan13** (10): The voice of this song. I suspect they wanted another viral Let It Go moment, but failed. But we still got this gem.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): this is a 10 but the reprise with I am Moana is a 100
 
**SFbby** (10): How far will Moana go to become the main Disney pop princess? With this song, very, very far
 
**thegolding** (10): Another song from Disney's new films that I don't hate go get real far gurl
 
**waluigiest** (10): another beautiful song from a beautiful movie
 
**junobeekeeper** (9.5): Docking a half point because they played this song at my old job and I heard it 5 times during one shift.
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): Fuck City Of Stars.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): The part where she says on this island 3 times in one verse bugs me but other than that it’s good
 
**rickikardashian** (9): Honestly, when the movie version of the song is this good, there really isn't any need to try and push a single version with another celebrity
 
**silentev** (9): The beat and pacing of the lyrics (yes, yes, we all know who wrote this) is perfection.
 
**FluffyNobody** (8): I've never seen Moana, but the song is nice
 
**J\_Toe** (8): Generic but good. When concept art for Moana was first leaked, I didn't know the water was her friend. I though she was, like, a water bender. Or tropical Elsa. And this song's angst about being a perfect daughter is certainly Let It Go lite.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): This is the only Disney song my dad likes
 
**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): Auli’i is consistent and I think we all should stan
 
**Steelstepladder** (7): You'll go right into the B tier of Disney Movies

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Yes, the Little Mermaid is a product of its time that could be torn apart for Ariel’s character arc today, but holy fuck, if it isn’t a gorgeous film for a queer reading thanks to the ghost of Hans Christian Andersen astounding lyricism of Howard Ashman. Funnily enough, Part of Your World is more or less an actual ripoff of a song from Little Shop of Horrors that he and Menken wrote a few years prior, but while the song in question is good for a bunch of laughs, this one is just an exquisite expression of longing and desire for something you can’t have because of the destiny you’ve been thrusted under, which is going to be a recurring theme for a lot of Disney movies from this point on in the canon, and...agghhh, it’s just all so fucking gay, isn’t it? Few classics in the canon deserve their acclaim more than this. And, by the way, we didn’t include reprises in this rate, but the one for this is fucking beautiful.
 
**vhqv1997** (9): This song didn’t even make day 2 at one point, but thankfully the people with good taste showed up and brought it up to the top 10. This song, with its movie, marked the start of the renaissance of Disney movies, which lead to the Disney global take-over today. All hail the Mouse Supreme!
 
---
 
**ImADudeDuh** (11): YAS!!!!!!!!
 
**sailormunelune** (11): pure magic
 
**stripyounaked** (11): Not only is this the best disney song, it's one of the greatest songs of all time. Circle of Life may be the most epic. Reflection may have the support of the LGBT community. I'll Make a Man Out of You may be the most fun. But this song describes a universal human condition with such perfection and it still fits seamlessly into story of the movie that it's in. It's perfect.
 
**thegolding** (11): There is so much behind these lyrics, but I just going to say I relate to them (not for the original reasons nor I'm a mermaid) but I understand the need to escape from a place that's not for you. Stream Jessica Simpson's version hoes
 
**1998tweety** (10): 90% of the gay guys you meet will tell you The Little Mermaid was their fave Disney princess movie I guarantee it. We stan a bop made for the gays.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): the entire reprise scene is top 10 animated movie scenes ever and no one on this planet, this galaxy, this universe, can tell me otherwise
 
**anothertown** (10): INVENTED "i want" songs. jodi benson acts the hell out of this, she explores so many different emotions within one song. the range of loud vs. quiet within the song is amazing - the music builds and retreats and it ends on a quiet note instead of a big belt which is perfect. UGH their minds
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): Such a beautiful song. I can’t believe that idiot wanted to cut it from the movie!
 
**J\_Toe** (10): Going broadway was one of the best choices disney ever made
 
**jexan13** (10): When a princess goes hard, she goes hard. It's the saddest of the "i want more" songs, despite the hopeful lyrics. I mean, I can feel you Ariel, we have worlds we desperately need to be part of.
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Dawn of a new era
 
**ManofOranges** (10): so beautiful and so melodious ariel cemented
 
**pearllouise** (10): Get yourself a girl like Ariel that can sing to you every morning. I remember being so obsessed with Ariel that I used to pretend my couch was a rock and I would copy the little high note pose she does in the movie.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): I've always hated how many people are always like "Ariel left behind her life as a princess just for some dick", because literally it takes just this 3mimites song to debunk that thought. Ariel's main motivation to go to earth was never Eric, but instead getting to know the human world, in fact, the only moment makes any mention to a certain someone is on the final line where she sings "I want to be part of **your** world", but even then, her wish is more about being on earth than being with Eric. People purposefully ignore that Ariel's main trait was her fascination in the human world, just to pretend that she was just looking for some dick
 
**skargardin** (10): One of the best Dinsey ballads, point blank periodt
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): If I were a mermaid and I saw all the shit going on in the world I would simply not want to be part of that world. RIP to Ariel but Im different
 
**bespectacIed** (9.5): This song sounds gorgeous and I know I should direct the blame to misogynistic Disney writers, but damn ariel truly a dumb bih
 
**slimboyfriend** (9.5): B-I-C-T-H. A gay anthem for all children
 
**brenda\_official** (9): girl you know what feet are called dont play dumb
 
**silentev** (9): The way this song quiets and crescendos always gets to me.
 
**Steelstepladder** (9): The second best four word song in the rate with the fourth word being world
 
**waluigiest** (9): I love that this is simultaneously dramatic broadway gold and completely 90’s
 
**FluffyNobody** (8.5): This gives me such Wicked vibes
 
**hikkaru** (8.5): the first song in the rate i actually like
 
**CarlieScion** (8): not to be very [HOT TAKE] but little mermaid 2 > little mermaid
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8): i'm a sucker for an I Want song
 
**junobeekeeper** (7.9): There's a lot that can be said against The Little Mermaid. Ariel was kinda dumb but her enthusiasm here is so powerful. It's a lovely song.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): ariel is a main pop girl but this song isn’t as exciting as I remember it being
 
**SFbby** (7): Living on land is overrated
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): unironically the music for The Little Mermaid is the first movie from this rate that sounds like it's mixed to modern standards
 
**vayyiqra** (6): there is definitely a TvTropes page on the "i want to be [X]" and this song is probably a large part of the reason why. i guess it's pretty enough but i have no real attachment to it
 
**nowqueenofpop** (5): I fully admit bias because Ariel was always my least favorite princess because she annoyed me so much but maybe this song paved the way for the better, more emotional solo princess songs. Does anyone else remember it moving slower, though?
 
**fortyfive33** (2): A preface: I really don't like the Little Mermaid. Of the four songs here, this is the worst. Bite me.
 
**AvatarKanol** (0): I have extreme dislike for this song and I really want to give it a 0 I literally can't stand listening to it. The Little Mermaid is very overrated.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I won’t have the time to note my disappointment with Lea Salonga in my Reflection comment for multiple reasons, so here it goes: Lea, honey, why in the name of all the traffic in Metro Manila do you support the Marcoses?! Sobrang nakakalungkot ang pagkakaibigan mo sa pamilya na yan, sa totoo lang. Masyadong disappointed in you ako ma’am. Gay icon ka pa tapos ganyan ang attitude mo. Sayang na sayang. Sigh...okay, my ranting in Tagalog about how Lea let me down is over. Let’s just ignore that and move on...the next half of this comment was originally something about how I found this song to be a tad bit overrated, but I just watched Aladdin again last Saturday, and you know what? The entire magic carpet scene slapped hard, and so did the song! I’ve seen the light! (Haha, get it? I’ve Seen the Light? Wouldn’t it be wild if Alan Menken recycled this-)
 
---
 
**waluigiest** (11): yes this is my favorite Disney movie yes this sequence is animated musical perfection
 
**1998tweety** (10): This soundtrack slapped so hard ugh, we love a good duet.
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): It’s just so wonderful.
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Gorgeous, iconic song, the only song in this movie that matters, a song that will last forever. Also, Lea Salonga represent!!! :philippineflag: (even though she has problematic political views)
 
**FluffyNobody** (10): For Lea's voice alone
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): the original outsold any other versions
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh we have to fucking love the whole world.
 
**J\_Toe** (10): Lea Salonga is a gift!
 
**pearllouise** (10): They probably went back to Jasmine’s place and had some erotic kinky sex after the ride
 
**sailormunelune** (10): This makes me feel indescribable feelings
 
**Steelstepladder** (10): Probably one of the standouts from this rate and I would not be angry at all if it won
 
**thegolding** (10): Extremely beautiful. Once again... STREAM JESSICA SIMPSON'S VERSION
 
**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): ngl if we rated the live-action remake version this song would have gotten my 11
 
**nowqueenofpop** (9): Give Lea Salonga her AWARDS… this vocal LEGEND. What a gorgeous duet… the way it sweeps and builds and soars.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Was never a big fan of Aladdin but damn it this one bops
 
**vayyiqra** (9): i am a shameless aladdin stan and love the scene this song is from but as pretty as it is, hearing it without the film i can now definitely hear that the singing is not by the voice actors and it's detracting a bit. however it's still one of the best songs in this rate and iconic scene so i have to rate it high
 
**SFbby** (8): Makes me want to fly on a magic carpet around the world
 
**skargardin** (8): The song is exquisite but this version doesnt really hit full marks
 
**silentev** (7.5): Weird undertones aside, this is one of the better Disney romance songs.
 
**slimboyfriend** (7.5): "DON'T YOU DARE CLOSE YOUR EYES!!"
 
**CarlieScion** (7): i get flashbacks to the ps1 aladdin game when i hear this
 
**fortyfive33** (7): Lea Salonga's great, but everything else is "eh."
 
**jexan13** (7): I know it's a classic and it's very cute but... it doesn't provoke too much in me.
 
**anothertown** (6): let's all listen to how beautiful lea salonga sounds here, wow, a beautiful icon of stage and screen
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6): i really don't like aladdin's voice

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Girl, they used to play this in the commercial sections of the Disney DVDs that I always watched at home, and even if I had never watched Hercules, I thought that the opening chords fucking snapped. True enough, it has a reputation as that one Disney song that everybody just cannot help but sing along to now. It deserves that prestige, but something about how the Muses’ voice are processed here doesn’t feel right to me, unfortunately. It’s as if they’re too soft for this song to really hit on me. I’m sorry. Please don’t kill me.
 
---
 
**agentofscranton** (11): Hercules is far and away my favourite Disney film, and a big reason for that is the Muses. Spice Girls what? Little Mix whomst? They all wish they could release a song HALF as good as this.
 
**napsandnetflix** (11): god what a BOP we have to love the absolute best disney song from the absolute best disney movie
 
**1998tweety** (10): Mega bopt
 
**anothertown** (10): really goes to show how good your soundtrack can be when you cast black women.
 
**AvatarKanol** (10): Hercules needs more recognition.
 
**bambamhenny** (10): Muses stay winning, best part of the movie honestly
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): Now this is the real shit!
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Lie to me and tell me The Muses aren't the best part of this white man's whore film.
 
**brenda\_official** (10): his perfect package packed a pair of pretty pecs omg literally poetry
 
**hikkaru** (10): the muses are main pop girls
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): that video comparing the animated version with the real life actresses that were the models to help the animators is so good. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCoJvu8PF7Q
 
**J\_Toe** (10): so one thing I do when I'm bored is make playlists with one song for each letter of the alphabet, without picking the same artist twice. And, like, Z is impossible. My picks are this, Zero (by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs), Ziggy Stardust, and Zheng yi zhi yan by Jolin Tsai. Please tell me if you have any good options.
 
**junobeekeeper** (10): What is there to be said about this song that hasn't been said. It's sassy, fun, and overall a very good time.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): the muses are true pop girls
 
**NotWith10000Men** (10): do i need to explain this score?
 
**pearllouise** (10): Sorry u/soundheim2011, Li Shang made me do it
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): Check out the side by side video with the live action story board. Disney used to be unbelievable
 
**waluigiest** (10): absolute massive banger
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Another favourite of mine! It’s just fun and catchy in every way. Hercules is my favourite flavour too!
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (9): I can never not sing the entire thing
 
**skargardin** (9): Absolute banger
 
**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): we should've seen ari's blackface era coming after she covered this
 
**Steelstepladder** (8): I lift to this
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ok but isn’t there supposed to be nine muses? where are the other four
 
**silentev** (7): I would kill for more Muse songs, even if it’s just a glorified montage song.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): well that was a totally bizarre tonal shift from the last song and i am not sure how well soul music fits into a movie about ancient greece but whatever it kind of bops

**vhqv1997** (8): I didn’t like Coco that much, nor this song, but I know that for a lot of you, this movie and this song were an incredibly emotional and personal moment for you in the theaters, and I’m glad that everyone made such a non-conventional choice to make this win the bonus rate. Absolutely deserves.
 
---
 
**bambamhenny** (10): the spanish version slaps harder but yeah this is the shit RECUERDAME 🗣
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Recuérdame outsold in all levels, but still a great song. Coco is such a well-made film. Also, gael garcia bernal's voice and face and everything ... solo soy un agujero
 
**FluffyNobody** (10): I watched Coco on my way to Japan for a two-month internship AND I watched it after Three billboards which had already wrecked me; I spent the entire movie crying and the day after as well
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): we love Mexico
 
**jexan13** (10): No la oiría en público. like dis if u cry evrytime.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): the Spanish version is way better
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I’m crying
 
**sailormunelune** (9.5): This would be a 10 but I can't listen without crying
 
**silentev** (8.5): This is such a simple but beautiful song for what it needs to convey in the story of the movie.
 
**anothertown** (8): it's still fuck ernesto de la cruz!!!!!!
 
**Tolk1en** (7): I would have given 9/10 to a lot of other songs from Coco
 
**junobeekeeper** (6.8): Book of Life outsold
 
**vayyiqra** (6): what the hell was coco about anyway i kind of like miguel he was good on that song he did with dua lipa and kimbra likes him so i can't hate him. natalia lafourcade is good too and a big qt which is also probably biasing my answer but i don't really like this song that much. it's okay i guess. i feel like every time we rate a latin pop song or even a song in spanish i hate it and that makes me feel as if i'm racist but really i just hate reggaeton; this song is a totally different genre though so it's exempt from that. i wouldn't miss it if it hadn't been included though
 
**slimboyfriend** (5): WHY COULDN'T WE RATE THE VERSION THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD or even the one by Miguel
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (4): I don’t really know which version we’re rating so I’ll assume it’s Ernesto’s and give a four because FUCK HIM.

**vhqv1997** (10): Just want to talk about the fact that John Smith was an all-around decent love interest who took a bullet to save Pocahontas’ father, only for the sequel to arrive and Pocahontas to dump him like a hot potato and got around with an even whiter, blander dude.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): This is...still a good song, but, it, er, just doesn’t hit as hard for me as it does for some people? Maybe it’s because there are still Native stereotypes overflowing in the lyrics, but it’s not as bad as it is in Savages, I suppose...by the way, if you want to hear a weird story, I once saw a girl sing this at my university for a set of performances about the environment that I decided to attend for my biology class. She changed some of the lyrics to be more Filipino-specific, so stuff like “how high does the sycamore grow?” became “how high does the narra tree grow?”. It was kind of strange, but at least it was well-intentioned...
 
---
 
**selegend** (11): best song that ever graced the earth
 
**skargardin** (11): QUEEEN of combating racism and colonialism I STAN. It will be a travesty if this doesn't win the rate
 
**vayyiqra** (11): yes this song is probably kind of racist (even though this movie is supposed to be the opposite, but it was the 90s and hamfisted "can't we all just get along we're all the same whether white black yellow or blue" narratives were in at the time) and yes pocahontas was 12 at the time. however pocahontas is still a beautifully made movie and this song is beautiful and hearing it in the trailer alone made me want to watch the the movie. i think the movie is just mid but damn i love this song i don't care how basic that is
 
**1998tweety** (10): Vocals JUMPED, where was Savages tho? That's a mega bopt
 
**agentofscranton** (10): absolutely stunning song. the sequence in the film is also absolutely gorgeous. shame it had to be from Pocahontas, but this isn’t a film rate. it’s a soundtrack rate, and colours of the wind is absolutely a 10 of a song.
 
**bambamhenny** (10): YAAAASSS NATURE, WE STAN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS KWEEN
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): This song will be the song I play when discrimination and racism and sexism and homophobia and hate finally die. (Projected time: November 23rd, 2089)
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Vanessa Williams outsang. Super gorgeous iconic song but this movie's so problematic, I can't
 
**CarlieScion** (10): call them out queen
 
**DanMcMissile** (10): Pocahontas is gold also where the hell is Savages Part 1 and 2.
 
**hikkaru** (10): a problematic movie but this is a BOP
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): ended white conquerors
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yes, we love a white people call out song. If you are white, fuck you
 
**jexan13** (10): There's so few songs in the world that make me feel like this one. The first line of the chorus disconnects my soul from my body, despite having basically no meaning; it just has that power. My 11 almost went with this song... But Let It Go won
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Another god-tier Pocahontas number justice for Mine, Mine, Mine and Steady as the Beating Drum
 
**pearllouise** (10): We stan a woman of color. Zara Larsson could never.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): I don't know how well this will be received by popheads, but this is considered to be one of the best Disney sings, and rightfully so, it's straight up a journey to listen to. This is one of those songs where you need to close your eyes, put on headphones, and appreciate the music, because there's always some little detail that you'll discover doing so
 
**sailormunelune** (10): “You’ll learn things you never knew you never knew” instant classic
 
**silentev** (10): This is still the most beautiful song with the most powerful lyrics and powerful message.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ROAST that bitch Pocahontas!
 
**thegolding** (10): Probably one of the best Disney songs ever. The way you can feel, taste and smell everything she's narrating through her belts. Iconic af
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): fun fact: my bff hates this song so my other bff and i used to always play it when we were hooked up to the aux in her car
 
**SFbby** (9): Ended racism
 
**junobeekeeper** (7.9): This song has the right idea but again, Pocahontas is such a flawed movie that I can't rate it higher. Like… casting Mel Gibson? What's a blue corn moon? So many questions!
 
**FluffyNobody** (7): Fun fact, once I sang a random song in elementary school and a friend of mine called me Pocahontas to make fun of me. I've hated her since

**vhqv1997** (10): A BOP AND A HALF. Meg has always been underrated by the general public as a Disney character, but I’m so glad she is reverred by the gay community because I guess we all know for a fact she would be a huge ally and kick homophobes in the teeth. This song had quite a few shots at going #1, but sadly it just couldn’t cut it as well the top 3.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (10): Another universally beloved Disney song from this film. At the time of writing, no single person has given this a bad score. I knew it was good from the first time I heard it, but I seriously didn’t get what a great gospel arrangement it was until now! The symbiosis between Meg’s voices and dramatic persona here and that of the Muses just makes way too good of a roadshow, alongside being the perfect song for any of us gays to freak out about. Meg is way too relatable, sisters. An easy 10 if I ever saw one.
 
---
 
**J\_Toe** (11): dare I say... gay anthem? Like, so many I want songs are generic enough to fit that mantle. But this song, with it's sass and despair and joy all in one specifically fits that niche of gay experiences as voiced by Disney
 
**rickikardashian** (11): Disney is amazing when it comes to making music for its films, they're able to create catchy pop songs to heartfelt ballads that hook the viewer and leave its print in pop culture. They've mastered the craft of making music to accompany their films to almost perfection, and it can be seen by how pretty much every single song in this rate is at least a 7+. I have give out more 10s than I think I've ever done in a part rate, and even with decades worth of incredible songs, from the second I saw the rate, I knew this would be my 11. This song is perfection the entire way. Having Meg sing her heart out as she does her best to deny any feelings she has, while the Muses do the best job any group of backup singers ever have done, sarcastically mocking Megaras refusal of her feelings make for one of the funnest experience one can get while listening to a Disney song. The only issue the track has it's its length, considering that it goes way too fast and before you realize, it's over, but this is easily solved by just playing it over, and over, and over again, trapping you in an endless loop that never gets old because each time, the song feels as fresh as the first time. Truly one of the best musical works Disney has created, and it doesn't get nearly the recognition it deserves
 
**slimboyfriend** (11): Suppressing emotions. Who can relate? Woo!!
 
**1998tweety** (10): This is cute and groovy, we love it.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): Megara is my favourite Disney heroine, with Moana and Mulan next to her (big fan of my M girls clearly)
 
**AvatarKanol** (10): Hercules has an amazing soundtrack and this song is one of the examples of how good it is. Just an amazing song.
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): Ugh, me with literally every guy who won’t even give me a second look.
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Carly Rae Jepsen - Happy Not Knowing (1997)
 
**brenda\_official** (10): youre gonna have to do more than just SAY IT
 
**FluffyNobody** (10): This was a close call for my 11, just saying. Absolutely flawless. Also Megara was my bi awakening
 
**fortyfive33** (10): The harmonies! Oh my heavens the harmonies here!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t t tsundere
 
**jexan13** (10): So sassy and dramatic. The superior Hercules song and among the best on this rate. Also what I sang when I got my clown dress and fell for that straight f*ckboi
 
**ManofOranges** (10): possibly my favorite disney song of all time meg really serves here the only reason this isn't my 11 is because i know everybody is going to pay this song dust
 
**SFbby** (10): RELATABLE QUEEN
 
**skargardin** (10): QUEEN
 
**thegolding** (10): Almost my 11. My second favorite song from Disney all time. It was my song with my ex-bff and it brings me back to better times
 
**junobeekeeper** (9.6): We stan repressing our feelings!
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9): having a choir in the background all the time is such a nice touch to this soundtrack
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Is this supposed to sound like It’s In His Kiss by Cher or am I just hearing things
 
**anothertown** (8): rose quartz ate that up
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song is shorter than I remember
 
**silentev** (7.5): Meg and the Muses’ contrasting back-up has always been the stuff of dreams.
 
**Steelstepladder** (7): This song is an eternal mood but it's a shame that it's kinda uninteresting musically

**vhqv1997** (10): I once thought the opening lines of this song were keysmashes.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (10): Before I start writing my comments for Lion King songs, here’s a big disclaimer: I’m going to be referencing the stage adaption for pretty much every one of my takes on all five of them, and that’s because that musical was the last bit of theatre I ever watched before my grandfather died the next day. What, did you think that was a joke? Haha! No! Watching the scene where Mufasa died with my extended family was super fucking stressful! Untold childhood traumas aside, the adaption is pretty special for me, so it’s always going to affect my view on the movie and its soundtrack. Anyway, onto Circle of Life itself...this is obviously the most iconic opening to a Disney movie, period, and I think anybody would find it hard to ignore that every little bit of it is musically and vocally gorgeous, even if songs like this just aren’t their cup of tea. This gets even better in the stage play, because the giant animal puppets and/or actors in the scene actually start marching in the audience aisles as the song goes on, and the procession becomes such an absolute marvel to watch. I think I’m ultimately going to refrain from giving this my 11, but there’s hardly more regal a song in all of the canon.
 
---
 
**anothertown** (11): off top, it feels corny to give this my 11, but it sounds so incredible lol. it is everything you want a disney song to sound like, huge and rich and layered. anyway this soundtrack is the only thing hans zimmer has ever done that i respect.
 
**bespectacIed** (11): Don't be a camila antiblack and disgrace the most gorgeous, culturally relevant, important, iconic song in the rate! Best and most iconic intro of any disney movie, perhaps any movie, ever. The film, audio, and musical performance of this song are all equally goosebumps-inducing. A song that will stand the test of time.
 
**TiltControls** (11): One of the best intros of all time and the music is the primary reason why. Iconic and wonderful.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): what Disney does best imo is the absolutely sTUNNING opening songs / sequences of their animated films - this, Tarzan, Up (which I know is Pixar but that’s a disney company so it counts shut up), Frozen, etc. - and of those Circle of Life is absolutely the greatest, not just of Disney, but maybe the greatest opening sequence of any film ever. fight me.
 
**FluffyNobody** (10): Name a more iconic opening line, I'll wait
 
**fortyfive33** (10): One of the best songs ever and arguably the greatest animated sequence ever.
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): One of the most iconic openings in cinematic history.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): A bunch of animals singing about how we all fucking die while bowing for the new king that will be able to devour absolutely all of them
 
**SFbby** (10): ICONIC opening
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): What a fucking iconic intro
 
**thegolding** (10): Disney Channel Stars version brings me to tears
 
**waluigiest** (10): I saw this on broadway and I shed real tears
 
**1998tweety** (9.5): This definitely is iconic but the opening bit has been memed so much it's lost some of it's impact.
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): Until we find our plaaaaace.... on the paaath unwiiindiiiiiiing!
 
**CarlieScion** (9): beautiful
 
**ManofOranges** (9): one of the most iconic openers of all time
 
**pearllouise** (9): NAAAAAAAH SAVENYAAAAH MUMMA NIECE PUMMA DA
 
**slimboyfriend** (9): Idk who she is, but this woman's voice is so beautiful she brought me to tears
 
**vayyiqra** (9): what an opening, what a movie. i don't care if it's a meme this scene is great and that opening line in isiZulu still hits. the only problem is it's too short
 
**J\_Toe** (8): Can I point out how un-American the Lion King is? It supports primogeniture, making it the moral antithesis to Hamlet.
 
**jexan13** (8): An iconic intro, incredible instrumentals and cinematic feeling. Would be perfect if the vocals didn't feel so weak.
 
**nowqueenofpop** (8): This gets a high score purely because of how iconic it is
 
**silentev** (8): Must resist the urge to hold my cat high above my head.
 
**skargardin** (8): Boppy
 
**Steelstepladder** (8): The single best opening shot from a Disney film
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): the animation? iconic. the whole opening? legendary. the song itself? eeehhhhhh.....
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6): it really builds i guess?
 
**junobeekeeper** (5.4): It's fine but the overplayedness of it detracts from the song itself.

**yourhostandpatron** (11): Hunchback of Notre Dame is my favourite movie of all time, so I could have easily given my 11 to one of the songs in this rate from it, but I chose not to. I chose to give my 11 to Reflection, a song that I would have given a 9 otherwise. And that’s because it hits too close to fucking home. Let me put it this way: Lea Salonga is Filipino. Mulan is Chinese. I’m an ethnically Chinese person who’s a third-generation immigrant from the Philippines and who considers myself as belonging to a hybrid of both cultures. Now, what you have to understand is due to the doubt and resentment towards trying to be somebody you’re not within Reflection’s lyrics, the song obviously gets queer people feeling emotions, in general, regardless of their nationality or race. This connection is only stronger if you’re queer AND Filipino; we’ve kind of cancelled Lea over here because she supports the family of an infamous dictator, Ferdinand Marcos (ewwww), but her lasting status as a local icon only makes Reflection feel more personal, and more powerful. Couple that in with it being sung by a Chinese character who suffers from that age-old Asian struggle of being a disappointment towards your family that’s especially prevalent within Chinese culture, and, haha, yeah! I’m going to break down and cry! Amazing! Yet another factor that makes listening to Reflection such an emotional experience for me is my status as a trans man. It’s true that white people automatically thinking Mulan is transmasculine is super problematic, but I believe that as long as you acknowledge that the myth is supposed to be a feminist narrative first and foremost, you can create queer readings of it, as long as you’re extremely careful. Personally, I don’t see Mulan as trans, but independent of the rest of the movie, I do see Reflection’s lyrics as especially heartbreaking if you’re not cis. So there you have it; I’m a Chinese-Filipino trans guy with a unsupportive and shitty family, and it goes without saying that Reflection is basically my fucking theme song. I will never pass for a perfect daughter. Will my reflection ever show who I am inside? Probably not, because my parents are going to kick me out before I ever inherit the money to transition, but it’s nice to loop this song over and over to cope with my depression regarding that. I’m such a mess. Stan Mulan.
 
**vhqv1997** (10): I was going to talk a lot about how this song deserved to go #1 over I’ll Make a Man Out of You, but what my co-host has written is already so beautiful, please read theirs.

# SHOW YOUR PRIDE
 
**pearllouise** (10): Transgender bop
 
**Steelstepladder** (10): Big trans mood
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): Mulan is inherently queer. The movie and the woman.
 
**J\_Toe** (10): Lea Salonga returns! Another perfect gay anthem! So good it made me want to wipe off half a face of make up with a hanfu. Watch the extended version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQR898rb1k8
 
**junobeekeeper** (10): This song hits different when you're gay
 
**rickikardashian** (10): I'll be real, back when I was still in the closet this song resonated way too much with me, and listening to it still makes me emotional
 
**waluigiest** (10): TRANS ANTHEM
 
# I JUST LIKE LEA SALONGA
 
**nowqueenofpop** (11): Quite literally the best Disney animated song, the best Disney song, the best song ever. There is no changing my mind because all other opinions are wrong. First of all, the beautiful vocals of Lea Salonga. Second, the instrumentation. Third, there is no other song on this list that beats this song and that is that! You can really feel the pain, the heartache, the desire to belong somewhere and be accepted by the ones you love, the fear that they don’t love you for who you are, wishing you could fit that mold,
 
**1998tweety** (10): Ugh iconic af, we love a good ballad.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): i'm a bad filipino if i don't give my girl lea salonga the 10 she deserves
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): Twenty years later and I still don’t like my reflection.... wish I did something special like Mulan.
 
**bespectacIed** (10): Mulan the animated version highkey the best disney princess ever, we don't know Liu Yifiei! Also Lea Salonga's voice is just perfection
 
**CarlieScion** (10): this is the best disney ballad. fight me.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is a top tier Disney song.
 
**ManofOranges** (10): this song really hits close to home for me for no reason in particular
 
**sailormunelune** (10): Nothing but greatness from the best Disney princess
 
**SFbby** (10): I'd recommend looking in the mirror for a better reflection
 
**thegolding** (10): Almost my 11 too. I know this song by heart. The lyrics, the vocals, the feelings just wow. I wanted to say GO STREAM CHRISTINA AGUILERA, but Lea Salonga is also a queen
 
**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): there are so many fucking tens in this rate what am i gonna do?? how do i pick an eleven????
 
**bambamhenny** (9): Lea Salonga I'm still disappointed that you won't renounce the dictators, the marcoses but props to ya
 
**jexan13** (9): It's good but maybe too short or downtempo? Also, there's the superior Mulan song out there.
 
**fortyfive33** (8): why is lea salonga so good
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): overrated a bit but whew it still slaps. when this hits, it definitely hits.
 
**silentev** (8): Did you know that Christina Aguilera’s cover of this is what launched her career?
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): r/2meirl4meirl
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (7): Its amazing but I wish it was longer
 
**skargardin** (6): Bonus points for the closing recorder notes but it's just so incredibly short that i can't score it higher. Like, there's potential but it does not take OFF the way it needs to
 
# A TAKE THAT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO ASSESS
 
**vayyiqra** (6): k i know mulan is canonically a crossdresser and not trans which are not at all the same thing but if she (in that case he?) were, this song would really hit different js. like, it would be perfect for that

**yourhostandpatron** (10): This is definitely the one Disney song that everybody just straight up loves, if we're being honest with ourselves. I think nobody has given it a low score yet as of the time of writing, although by the time this is posted all of you will be doubtless complaining about some brave soul who decided to give it a 3 in lieu of actually reading this comment. And, in fairness, I can't blame you! I can't think of a musical number as awesome as how hard Captain Li Shang is flexing in this number; it does everything it possibly can to remind you that Mulan is a movie involving a war raged against an imperial army, and what's great about that is that the film's overall story avoids the risk of you accidentally seeing taking its lyrics in the light of toxic masculinity. In conclusion: BE A MAN!!!
 
**vhqv1997** (9): Welp, we have our supreme winner. Personally I never understood the fanfare around this song, I just simply thought it was a decent fun inspiring song, but apparently a lot of y’alls loved it this much. Aside from a stray 4, everybody gave it at least a 7 and almost everybody gave it 10s and 11s. Just about 10 ballots into this rate, it has already cemented itself as the winning song and never let up once. Halfway through it, I even told Patron that there’s literally no way for Reflection to overtake this song, because the score discrepancy was way too high, unless everybody decided to sabotage this from there on.

**hikkaru** (11): stan main pop boy li shang, a bicon king! this is one of the easiest 11 decisions I've ever had
 
**ignitethephoenix** (11): Honestly one of the best Disney songs of all time. Iconic in every way. Donny Osmond is a main pop girl.
 
**jess\_22** (11): The most iconic song from the most iconic disney movie. Y'all better not do this song dirty. Fun fact: this was my fourth most listened to song this year according to Spotify Wrapped lol
 
**Lyd\_euh** (11): this song is the absolute best and gets me pumped no matter the circumstances
 
**ManofOranges** (11): in my mind this is one of the most iconic disney songs of all time. there have been a lot of contenders for my 11 for this rate but ultimately I chose this one because to me it just made sense. also seeing mulan climb that damn pole with those weights was, is, and forever will be one of the most satisfying moments in a movie period
 
**pearllouise** (11): Li Shang can despunk my balls anytime
 
**SFbby** (11): From the moment it starts "LETS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS" it's a full three minutes of fist-pumping, karaoke worthy quotable lyrics, and by the end, you better be down to defeat the Huns.
 
**silentev** (11): LETS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS this is the best song Disney ever produced don’t @ me
 
**static\_int\_husp** (11): This was in the playlist I made for when I ran a marathon. It works well in that kind of context, and just bangs in general, too.
 
**1998tweety** (10): This would win the rate if all of reddit did it, we love it though.
 
**agentofscranton** (10): bisexual icon Li Shang is absolutely the greatest pop boy of our time. please throw out any ballots that gave this certified BOP any lower than a 10
 
**bambamhenny** (10): a karaoke favorite, love it
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (10): They really went for it on this soundtrack.
 
**CarlieScion** (10): li shang bisexual KING
 
**FluffyNobody** (10): Feat. Bisexual icon Li Shang
 
**fortyfive33** (10): The drums. The guitar. The EVERYTHING.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): A men's right activist anthem. we stan.
 
**J\_Toe** (10): masc4masc gay anthem? Actually, no, let's not view the song through that lens otherwise it would have too many implications.
 
**jexan13** (10): too late bish
 
**junobeekeeper** (10): Disney's official workout song.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (10): one of the mouse's most iconic songs
 
**rickikardashian** (10): I work out to this song and it motivates me well, because the thought of me letting Li Shang down is enough fuel for me to finish the last set of push-ups I have left
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): THE most iconic Disney song, almost got my 11 for how fun and memorable it is
 
**thegolding** (10): who in this subreddit doesn't want Captaing Shang to make a man out of them
 
**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i want mulan to make a man out of me
 
**bespectacIed** (9.5): Captain daddy li shang could make anything out of me, imma be completely honest. A man, a friend, a maid, a bitch, a doormat, anything he needs
 
**Steelstepladder** (9): I think the verses are a little too underwhelming to give it a perfect ten but it gets close
 
**waluigiest** (9): I can’t listen to this because it reminds me of a cringey cover I recorded for pre-calculus in high school.......... but I can’t deny it slaps
 
**skargardin** (8): Bop
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): This is the only rate that Donny Osmond has a chance of winning
 
**vayyiqra** (8): to continue my previous train of thought, in the alternative timeline in which trans mulan is canon, if this were set in the present day this would be sung by the endocrinologist when prescribing HRT. also wtf did the huns do in this movie to make the chinese hate them anyway what was their deal is this based in history now i need to go on a wikipedia binge and find out because i really like chinese history just a random fact about me
 
**anothertown** (6): in 2010 darren criss auditioned for glee with this song
