**vhqv1997** (7): Okay, let me just say this: in the process of choosing songs for this rate, we had to use a multitude of different criteria because the Disney catalogue is extremely vast, and somehow this song managed to hit all the criteria to be chosen. It was in a mainstream Disney movie, it was promoted the most from the movie, and it was also used in the movie itself (granted it was for the credits). Yes, we know, nobody wants to acknowledge it, but as hosts, we just want to display some sort of integrity you know? And we totally didn’t include it just so that it would attract all the 0s and prevent some of the messier takes. Either way, it totally worked out, and it’s hilarious to see that this modern song is considered more outdated than all the songs from the golden age era.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (4): Lots of you demanded an explanation as to why we included this random Ne-Yo song that nobody remembered, probably because it wasn't even in the movie. You expressed confusion as to why we didn't include this movie's acclaimed villain song, Friends on the Other Side, instead. Those were very good concerns! We...we don't actually know why we did that. Haha! We're so random, right? I don't think this is as bad as some of y'all think it is, but its place in this rate is admittedly strange...at its core, it's essentially a bland wedding song, and even if I have nothing against Ne-Yo's music or voice, I legitimately cannot understand why anybody would listen to it at all. Heck, our rate may be giving this song the most traffic it's gotten in years! That's one upside to including it in, right? ...we're sorry.

# WHy DiDN't wE RatE AnoTHEr SoNG
 
**rickikardashian** (8.5): We had space for this single that I honestly can't remember even being in the film, but we couldn't make space for Friends on the Other Side, and the ultimate best song from the film, Dig A Little Deeper? aight
 
**1998tweety** (8): Ne-Yo is a king but this feels a little out of place for a Disney movie.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8): I mean it’s a decent song but does not really fit as a Disney song
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): I still don’t know why we’re rating this instead of Friends On The Other Side but this song is kinda a bop so
 
**hikkaru** (5.5): Friends On The Other Side SWEETIE
 
**agentofscranton** (4.5): love that in the middle of these bona fide classics we got a boring ne-yo song
 
**slimboyfriend** (4.5): Wtf, was this even in the movie?
 
**J\_Toe** (4): don't remember this. Was this in the credits? It certainly sounds... of it's time
 
**ManofOranges** (4): why is this song here
 
**silentev** (4): Who let Ne-Yo in here? I mean he can sing but this song seems out of place and the production seems messy.
 
**CarlieScion** (3): this is. so out of the blue in this rate lmao.
 
**DanMcMissile** (3): ummm this isn't even in the actual movie
 
**selegend** (3): friends on the other side deserved to be here
 
**SFbby** (3): This is by far the least Disney-like song on this list
 
**skargardin** (3): Now I haven't watched the princess and the frog but this is a true outlier in this rate and for all the wrong reasons
 
**Steelstepladder** (2): This feels so out of place in the Disney lexicon
 
**NotWith10000Men** (1): ne-yo? the fuck? i want disney tunes
 
 
**bambamhenny** (0): i give it a zero cause we all KNOW friends on the other side should be here 🙄 and cause this shit unmemorable sorry ne-yo still love yah
 
 
#THE VERY FEW WHO DIDN'T TALK ABOUT RATING ANOTHER SONG
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): king of not knowing
 
**jexan13** (7.5): such a bop
 
**bespectacIed** (5): The first black disney princess and brown disney prince deserved a better main song :/
 
**nowqueenofpop** (5): This does not fit the soundtrack at all?
 
**vayyiqra** (5): this is kind of mid i don't like the singer's voice but the instrumental is alright
 
**pearllouise** (1): I “never knew I needed” to turn this song off. This is a very shitty song.
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (0): This was it. This was the song that ended Ne-Yo’s hype.
 
**FluffyNobody** (0): I don't really like Ne-yo or RnB or this style of singing that sounds like they're complaining, never have, never will
 
**junobeekeeper** (0): Feels like Pitbull is about to start rapping here.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (0): very uncharming production and ne-yo is not a strong or memorable enough vocalist to do a disney song justice

**vhqv1997** (8): This song spent the entirety of the rate at the bottom of the rankings, and I guess for good reason. Everything about it is outdated, the character, the songwriting, the quality. Personally, I still enjoy it for what it is in its own time period, but it’s easy to see why almost all of you can’t stand it.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (5): This is one of the lesser known songs in the entire canon, and despite its historical significance, that obscurity for a good reason. I actually really like the hook where Snow White sings the title, and the opening monologue is charming in its own cheesy 1930s light, but everything else is...well, not unbearable, per se...let's just say that people must have been desperate enough to take any kind of romantic singing during the Great Depression. Adriana Caselloti deserves credit for giving life to the first Disney Princess, but she can't go a second without sounding as shrill as hell. The rest of the song doesn't also melodically live up to the potential that its first lines provide, so...I'm unfortunately going to have to file this under mediocrity. Disney songs evidently had a long way to go. All things considered, however? We could have gotten a worse start!
 
---
 
# BOOMERS
 
**DanMcMissile** (10): Snow White gets paid dust nowadays and this song is pure and beautiful.
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): The first Disney Princess signature song, we stan history
 
**skargardin** (9): It fits the thematics of a classic disney princess movie perfectly i LOVE it
 
**pearllouise** (8): Does Snow White sing this in bed too?
 
**thegolding** (8): Invented Mariah. (Barbra's version is gold btw)
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): relatable
 
**1998tweety** (6): It's kind of alright, vocals jumped tho
 
**anothertown** (6): i would die for this 1930s warbly soprano - also just learned that Walt Disney didn't credit her for the film and it ruined her career which is fucking criminal
 
**AvatarKanol** (6): Just okay.
 
**bambamhenny** (6): eh nothing special and nostalgia aint' gon be clouding my judgement
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (6): It’s a classic but a little too old fashioned for my taste.
 
**FluffyNobody** (6): It's a cute song, but a bit too old school for me. Also, I don't think I ever watched Snow White, so this has no emotional value for me
 
**J\_Toe** (6): I prefer the wishing well song
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Too pretty to give a low score too, but too short to give a high score to
 
# MILLENNIALS
 
**vayyiqra** (6): i used to be a miles davis stan (my cat is named after him), my first girlfriend looked like snow white and one time kimbra cosplayed as snow white so i have a lot of reasons to like snow white and yet i feel very little for this it's classic but it's just so short and a capella songs tend to be weak to me
 
**waluigiest** (6): why is her vibrato SO extreme
 
**SFbby** (5): I thought Somewhere Over the Rainbow was playing for a sec
 
**static\_int\_husp** (4.5): very generic "story song" that is kind of lacking in the song part. Caselotti has a decent voice, but it needs to be fleshed out more.
 
**hikkaru** (4): I already know these real old songs aren't for me... :waiting: to get to the renaissance songs
 
**junobeekeeper** (4): There's something to be said for Snow White, being one of the earliest full length animated films. However, this song just does nothing for me. Still, I'm glad it exists, even just for the bops it gave us later.
 
**nowqueenofpop** (4): Gorgeous voice, but I can only think of Ashley Tisdale singing it
 
**bespectacIed** (3): can't stand that vibrato
 
**NotWith10000Men** (3): if i remember this movie right, didn't she just scream at him by a well???
 
**CarlieScion** (2): im so sorry ik this is a classic but i just dont like the vocals or the instrumental.
 
**napsandnetflix** (2): sorry I know this is iconic but I can't imagine actively seeking this out and listening to this like imagine just driving down the road and having the aux and playing this? It's just not realistic i cant do it
 
**ImADudeDuh** (1): bitch was still oversinging as fuck and was shrill af, this bitch flopped!
 
**Steelstepladder** (1): Yeah he's gonna come far too early and it's going to be really disappointing because it's only two minutes and half of it was just talking if you catch my drift
 
**silentev** (0): Holy grating eardrums; I get this is a classic but did everybody in the thirties have to hit this high of an octave?

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): We have only one song from Disney’s dark age of animation thanks to the sound quality for all recordings of Cruella DeVill being absolutely awful, and, well, here it is. It’s about everybody wanting to be a cat. Thrilling. Definitely appeals to certain members of this subreddit’s demographic, although I’m not judging anybody for that. Of course, it’s not a patch compared to the swing of the Bare Necessities or the latter-day jazz of Princess and the Frog, but this is an entertaining number in what is otherwise a cute, but astonishingly mediocre movie. Also, the part where everybody (or, as the ballot wants you to spell, ev’rybody) and their trumpets gets super loud is pretty painful.
 
**vhqv1997** (7): This song aged like milk. Thanks a lot, Tom Hooper.
 
---
 
# CATS IS A MASTERPIECE AND DESERVES ALL THE OSCARS
 
**FluffyNobody** (11): This song is the reason why I liked jazz as a kid and I learned how to play the saxophone (well, that was also because of Lisa Simpson - I mean, I was 8). The Italian version slaps harder though, my 11 is mostly for that (and for Romeo's song which is not here and in Italian is ICONIC, your faves could never)
 
**1998tweety** (10): CLASSIC
 
**SFbby** (10): I want to be a cat
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Aristocats is the most underrated Disney movie and that's a fact
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): Probably one of the first Disney songs I was obsessed with. I used to rewind the vhs tape back to this scene and dance like a little fool to it.
 
**fortyfive33** (9): Disney should REALLY be trying swing more because they're really good at it
 
**agentofscranton** (8.5): furry anthem
 
**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): when the cats break it down... i just smile.
 
**silentev** (8): I’d also like to be a cat, please.
 
**pearllouise** (7): I love pussy
 
**rickikardashian** (7): I hope they make a remake of this movie, but all the cats look like the Cats movie:)))
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): like the jazz element but don’t care much otherwise
 
**jexan13** (6): Truly a jazzy bop, whose length works against it
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (6): Gets lost for me amongst other jazzy singing animals numbers
 
**nowqueenofpop** (6): Definitely the precursor to the Sebastian/Genie/etc type character songs
 
**thegolding** (6): I grew up listening to the Spanish version of this song and it was insanely good, however the original version almost put me to sleep
 
# CATS IS AN EVIL MOVIE AND TAYLOR SWIFT IS A SATAN'S SPAWN
 
**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I have no idea what this song is about and also that baby kitten voice sounds evil
 
**CarlieScion** (5): very average
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): Well, you are what you eat.
 
**skargardin** (3): Just like the movie, this is a hot mess
 
**Steelstepladder** (3): I care about this song about as much as the world cares about the Aristocats.
 
**vayyiqra** (3): i want to be a cat. i too have an irregular sleep-wake cycle and enjoying laying in the sun and i can kill small vertebrate animals if need be but only if it's for what i think are ethical reasons like food, overpopulation or research. anyway this song sucks, but i like cats a lot so i can't hate it too much
 
**bespectacIed** (2): i don't
 
**napsandnetflix** (2): thurl ravenscroft snapped many times (stream you're a mean one mr grinch) but this ain't it chief
 
**AvatarKanol** (1): Well never coming back to this.
 
**brenda\_official** (1): whos idea was it to have the baby sing along
 
**selegend** (0): ew

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Oh...oh, no. I forgot that the Pocahontas songs in this rate aren’t going to be the only ones that are likely enough to stir up some arguments about race. Okay, here’s the thing...yes, I Wan’na Be Like You is essentially just a monkey singing about how much he wants to be human, which would be a completely innocent concept on its own (aside from the fact that humans suck), but basing a monkey on a popular African-American jazz singer and making his defining character trait a desire to ‘evolve’ into something ‘superior’ has...er...questionable implications, I guess? Again, I doubt the animators consciously had anything in mind other than wanting to make a reference to Louis Prima (reading it as white supremacy alone doesn’t even work since Mowgli is Indian), but I really doubt the unfortunate undertones of it all are completely coincidental. As a song in itself? This is fun and everything, even if it’s not as good as the Bare Necessities, but context dampers its merit down a bit.
 
---
 
**1998tweety** (10): MEGA bop, the vocals are a bit meh but everything else slaps
 
**napsandnetflix** (10): We love a song they wrote about me. Also watch the olly murs/robbie williams cover of this on graham norton cause it was a lot of fun and good
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (8): This is a bop, hands down.
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (8): Overshadowed by Bare Necessities but still good, shoutout to those time traveler Tik Toks for reminding me it exists.
 
**skargardin** (8): Dance Monkey is quaking
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): I like the part where they invented simlish
 
**Steelstepladder** (8): There's some great Tik Tok memes out there
 
**jexan13** (7): the instrumental on this is a 10. The vocals are a 5.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): i love the sinister vibe of this song. it doesn't sound exactly like a villain song but it's still kinda uncomfortable
 
**silentev** (7): What a fun, unconventional villain song and jazzy to boot!
 
**rickikardashian** (6.7): The word "man-cub" feels honestly like the best way to insult a small child. imma start using it more often
 
**J\_Toe** (6): musically (lyrics aside) really fun. Contextually, really awkward

**bespectacIed** (2): i hate pre-disney rennaisance music, period
 
**vayyiqra** (0): this is really dull and trying too hard to LARP as louis armstrong. i do not see anything to like about it and the scat vocals are downright annoying. lastly the biology stan in me is a bit infuriated at the implication that humans are not apes THE GENUS HOMO IS PART OF THE HOMINIDAE ALSO KNOWN AS THE GREAT APES this song is trash

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Man, I have to watch the Jungle Book again. I have biases against anything Ruyard Kipling ever wrote for obvious reasons, but Disney’s adaptation of it comes off as a touch more charming than I’d expect from the book it’s based on. The whimsy and wonder of the canon’s first film composed of a cast of mostly animals (no, I’m not going to acknowledge the package films today) is perfectly encapsulated in Baloo’s loveable singing voice; this might be a hot take, but Hakuna Matata is pretty much just an inferior version of this, both lyrically and musically. Take that, Matthew Boderick.
 
**vhqv1997** (7): My opinion on this movie: Tarzan, but make it cringey (not like Tarzan wasn’t already cringey at times).

**CarlieScion** (10): iconique classique
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Another god-tier song in the Disney canon
 
**skargardin** (10): Points were MADE!! Couch potato anthem
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): lowkey sounds like political commentary
 
**1998tweety** (8): bopt
 
**ImADudeDuh** (8): the way this song completely overshadows the entire movie
 
**Steelstepladder** (8): GET IT... CAUSE HE'S A BEAR... AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
 
**thegolding** (8): This song reminds so much of my dad. He says I used to compare him to Baloo
 
**FluffyNobody** (7.5): A bop, drags for a bit too long though
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (7): It definitely gets stuck in your head whether you want it to or not.
 
**DanMcMissile** (7): Most people don't remember that most of this song is random jazz breaks and a trumpet solo that blares soooo loud that you have to lower the volume before your ears bleed out. Cute melody tho.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): we love a bear pun
 
**rickikardashian** (7): this sounds like communist propaganda but ok
 
**waluigiest** (7): added a point for the tuba solo omg
 
**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I like the actual song, but this man's soulless sing-talking is really pushing it
 
**napsandnetflix** (6): tbh i remember this popping the fuck off but it's kinda boring?
 
**silentev** (6): This song is super difficult to sing along to but is still fun and jazzy.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): remember: when you pick a pear, try to use the claw. also, damn i didn't realize this song was five minutes long
 
**ManofOranges** (5): i hate to say it but i don't like the jungle book
 
**pearllouise** (5): The Jungle Book wasn’t my jush, sorry
 
**Tolk1en** (5): too long and boring
 
**nowqueenofpop** (3): Such a beautiful intro for one of the most annoying songs to ever be made in a cartoon movie ever
 
**bespectacIed** (2): yt guys from this era who play jazz are racist, I just know, also this song is bad
 
**vayyiqra** (1): in fact life does not provide the bare necessities, which is why i think that unless we have a culture of mutual aid and altruism, a state will still be needed to (among other functions) provide welfare to the people living under it. anyway i've never liked this song and it does not need to be this long either (and i like longer songs)

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Nobody had the sense to separate characters' singing and acting voices in animated movies in the 1930s, and that's why this song's original rendition takes a big blow. Jiminy Cricket is one of the best parts of Pinnochio, but with all due respect to whoever his actor was, he just can't do justice to this song’s wonderful string arrangement. I’m really disappointed that I can’t give this a better score; musically, this is an absolute classic, and it’s as close to Disney’s original vision as you can get these days.
 
---
 
# TRUTHERS
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): I've never liked Pinocchio that much but this song is iconic and inescapable when it comes to the Disney "brand" so it gets a boost for its status.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): The epitome of Classic Disney. It has a dreamy majestic feel. I'm all of the sudden in a apatel colored forrest, surrounded by animals and fairies, looking into the sky as I fall asleep
 
**CarlieScion** (8): its really weird for me to listen to all of these in english bc im so used to the norwegian versions lmao
 
**pearllouise** (8): I once wished upon a star hoping Charli would release Taxi
 
**skargardin** (8): It's got some expert classical production
 
**waluigiest** (8): this is a classic for a reason. The orchestration is beautiful and it’s a little reminiscent of old broadway.
 
**1998tweety** (7): CLassic but I don't really like the choir parts
 
**fortyfive33** (7): there is a reason Disney uses this song as its general theme 80 years after its release. It's an incredibly simple and memorable motif. Cliff Edwards is great as Jiminy Cricket, but he just cannot sing.
 
**silentev** (7): Like I get this is the OG Disney song but I only really like the strings arrangement.
 
**jexan13** (6.5): is the intro El Chavo OST?
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): It’s an old Disney song about dreams what more can I say
 
**FluffyNobody** (6): Fun fact: my older sister cried while watching Pinocchio (for the whale scene specifically), so no one was ever allowed to watch it ever again. I know the story because of books/that hideous adaptation made by Benigni. Still, the song is cute I guess? Too slow for me though
 
**slimboyfriend** (6): yas hit that head voice
 
**Steelstepladder** (6): I kind of just wish the whole song was the main melody.
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (5): I used to get annoyed with this song but it’s grown on me a lot.
 
# LIARS
 
**ImADudeDuh** (5): cute movie intro but the song itself is meh.
 
**napsandnetflix** (5): iconic but imagine actively seeking this song out and listening to it lol
 
**nowqueenofpop** (5): instrumental preferred
 
**AvatarKanol** (4): Boring.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (4): i know it's very much in the style of the time but it's just too slow for me. plus i've never seen pinocchio sooooo
 
**vayyiqra** (4): it's iconic but why did older film music always try to be so ... lush with all the strings and so on? it's too much, it's like drinking syrup (i am canadian so i know syrup don't even try to talk to me about syrup). it's pretty but i can't fuck with it
 
**junobeekeeper** (3.5): For the song Disney basically made their theme, it's really not that great.
 
**bespectacIed** (2): wish we rated f(x) - Pinocchio instead
 
**ignitethephoenix** (0): boring and pitchy. I prefer the instrumental version they play at the beginning of Disney movies

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Not so fun fact: I cry to this sometimes because I used heavily relate to Cinderella's situation of being trapped inside a hostile household and only having dreams to rely on. It's not so bad now, because I have friends and outside support thanks to going off to college, but dear God, do I wish some charming man could come and get me out of here, too! Ahem...movie on...the only reason why I didn't give this a higher score is because the birds and mice singing in the middle are honestly a fucking curse, but this is a beautiful song, regardless. Strangely enough, I also believe it carries a peculiarly melancholic undertone to it; another sad thing I associate with A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes is that apparently Cinderella's voice actress, Illene Woods, used to be played it over and over in her nursing home after she started being unable to live on her own. Reports are that she grew happy whenever she heard it, but she didn't know why. That's some sad shit right there, isn't it?
 
**vhqv1997** (3): I don’t understand how this song fared better than When You Wish Upon A Star, considering they’re practically the same song but this did everything worse.

# LOUBOUTIN SLIPPERS
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (10): Another iconic song that you probably know even if you've never seen the movie
 
**NotWith10000Men** (10): cindy is my favorite princess and i love her and her DRESS IS FUCKING SILVER. NOT. FUCKING. BLUE.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): A frustrating case of a song being criminally short. The title is so beautifully clever, and the entire song has the type of message that can only work in a musical with a lead female that wishes for a better tomorrow. This is "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" sister that is just as beautiful, but shorter
 
**1998tweety** (8): This is like the Snow White song but good
 
**pearllouise** (8): Then how come my dreams of Charli releasing Taxi aren’t coming true?
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (7): I still sing this song when I’m doing household chores, pretending that someday I’ll get invited to a ball and marry a handsome prince. Siiiigh.
 
**J\_Toe** (7): but what about that 10 minute long song that's just rats making a dress?
 
**thegolding** (7): I still hear Disney Channel Stars while listening to it
 
**junobeekeeper** (6.7): I just noticed the first four songs are just about wishing and dreaming. Anyway, this is cute. Rats are fun.
 
# WALMART CROCS
 
**FluffyNobody** (6.5): This song is really a snooze, gets half a point more for the mice chorus tbh
 
**anothertown** (6): i like the part with the lil girl mice
 
**AvatarKanol** (6): Meh.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6): all these old songs just have really similar melodies which bugs me
 
**ImADudeDuh** (6): "If you need to get a better life, just keep dreaming. Remove yourslef from a toxic situation, take some time off for you, go cruise the caribbean, quit your job, and focus on you :)"
 
**slimboyfriend** (6): Now if this were the disney channel stars cover.....HUH.
 
**vayyiqra** (6): was every classic disney song about wishing or hoping for something? is there a TvTropes page about this? anyway this is so short i can barely rate it but it's okay i guess
 
**agentofscranton** (5): disney channel circle of stars outsold
 
**silentev** (5): This is a soothing song but kind of boring despite being a classic.
 
**CarlieScion** (4): this sounds old, therefore it is bad
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i had an alarm clock when i was 5 that played this song and i have such bad memories of it that it tainted my enjoyment of this song

**vhqv1997** (8): This song was at the risk of being rock-bottom at multiple points, but I guess the Cats fiasco made everybody see the animals in this movie in a more positive light.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Zootopia never got a wide release in my country, so I’ve never really watched it...therefore, I’m not exactly sure what the context of what Shakira’s singing about here is. It apparently plays during the credits, so maybe the lyrics make more sense if you’ve watched the movie? I dunno. Judging from people’s reactions to this one, that doesn’t really help. Try Everything is fine, and all, but...eh, it seems like the kind of credits song that I would enjoy after being incredibly satisfied with a movie experience, try listening to on its own the day after I went to the theatre, and end up being disappointed by after a film high. In short, it’s just okay. Kudos to Shakira for being the only main pop girl that made it in, though.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic furry shit. Shakira queen.
 
**jexan13** (10): mood
 
**junobeekeeper** (10): Main pop girl Gazelle.
 
**skargardin** (10): Maybe Sia and Stargate for once struck gold with an actual great motivational anthem. BOP
 
**bespectacIed** (9): Shakira Gazelle Knowles-Mebarak Ripoll main pop girl
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (8): Every time I took someone to see Zootopia, there was always some heavy bopping in the theater to this song.
 
**J\_Toe** (8): We need a Latina Princess movie. (I used to consider Yzma Disney's first Latina princess because I'm Australian and it took me a while to understand that Latina is not an ethnicity and is a socio-historic phenomenon. Basically, Yzma would be first nation Peruvian, or purple cat, whichever you prefer)
 
**agentofscranton** (7.5): shakira's fursona should collab with ashley o and robin sparkles for the don't call me angel cover we deserve
 
**hikkaru** (7.5): shakira's fursona is a main pop girl AND a political activist, taylor could never
 
**vayyiqra** (7): this movie looked like weird bait for furries so i didn't watch it but this is a bop and i am aware i am rating it highly mainly because it's the only electropop song in the rate i know my biases
 
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this is generic af sorry Shakira
 
**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): this song is actually really cute, just a huge change from the rest of the rate (minus ne-yo)

**pearllouise** (6): But she won’t try to pay her taxes
 
**silentev** (5): Shakira is super talented but in the end this is a super manufactured uplifting pop song for a Disney movie where she plays a giraffe pop star, right?
 
**CarlieScion** (4): i find this song so annoying
 
**slimboyfriend** (4): What........ was the point of this song
 
**Steelstepladder** (4): Who needs a real ending to your movie when you can just have a DANCE PARTY?????

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Out of all the songs in the canon that are supposed to be comedic but absolutely fail at it *cough* Hakuna Matata *cough* A Guy Like You, I think this is as far as Disney gets towards being funny without being as gut-bustingly wonderful as, say, Prince Ali. I don’t really have any especially strong memories of it as I do with other Tangled songs, but revisiting and rewatching this song and its scene again...yeah, this is pretty entertaining, despite the overabundance of singing men. I’ll give it a pass. It must be said that Rapunzel’s part is by far and away the most charming, though.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): While I definitely like all the songs on Tangled better than Love Is An Open Door, I think the latter features a better take on the idea of a poppy Disney song, simply because the way Anna and Hans duet here is intentionally unrealistic; this is a parody of the trope of two Disney protagonists falling in love in the shortest span of time imaginable, so of course the way they would be singing in this song would be clean and bubbly. Also, the production here is much clearer and less dated. It’s not a song that leaves an incredibly powerful impression on you or anything, but it definitely is a guilty pleasure; honestly, I may or may not like this better than Do You Want To Build A Snowman?

(shitpost aside i don't really like this song that much but i do love big hero 6 it was everything i have ever wanted in an animated movie so that's probably why i'm rating it higher than average)
 
**silentev** (6): Hey I love FOB and this is a strong rock song but lacks the lyricism that I usually admire from them.
 
**anothertown** (5): this falls in the category of newer fob songs that are "Annoying"
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (5): So out of place for a Disney song but BH6 is definitely one of Disney’s most out there flicks...
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): Fall Out Boy is one of my all time favorite bands and I will defend their post hiatus work til I die but honestly this song isn’t that good. The imooOooooortals part sounds so off key and the song is pretty lazily made overall. Now their cover of I Wan’na Be Like You on the other hand…

**vhqv1997** (8): I suppose we were all too woke for this. Sad too because it is quite a groovy bop.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Excluding Les Possions, which we did not include in this rate as there is no single human being on this Earth who wants to judge, comment, or even remember the existence of Les Possions, this is the least revolutionary and exciting part of the Little Mermaid’s soundtrack. It’s not that Kiss the Girl is a bad song (it can be charming sometimes if you’re in the right mood) but compared to the dramatic tension and the musical arrangements of everything else in the movie this is just...bland. It’s also heterosexual. And that’s BORING.

**FluffyNobody** (8.5): We all know Ashley Tisdale's version is superior though
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (8): Such a mood. It’s so funny to watch Prince Eric Be hella shy around Ariel while you’re judging him for not going for it yet when you see a hot guy in real life, you can’t even find the courage to go say hi.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Prince Eric is a pussy and a coward for not kissing Ariel she deserves so much better
 
**thegolding** (8): Queen Ashley Tisdale outsold Sebastian's ass
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Sebastian is the ultimate wing man/lobster
 
**silentev** (7.5): As a child I always wondered if Eric actually could hear Sebastian or not.
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (7): Weakest of the songs from Little Mermaid but still good
 
**nowqueenofpop** (7): Samuel E. Wright carried
 
**pearllouise** (7): Not gay enough.
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): Still good, but the weakest song in the movie and the one that's aged the most poorly
 
**waluigiest** (7): well arranged, but kind of uninspiring
 
**anothertown** (6): lesbian culture
 
**bespectacIed** (6): problematic but a huge bop
 
**vayyiqra** (6): as i'm sure some other comment will point out, this song hasn't aged well in the era of the hyper-woke 2010s. i am a firm believer in the importance of consent before any kind of physical contact, but i'm not sure it needs to be explicit and verbal literally every time (that's a subject which i'm not trying to start a debate over though). having said that, at least get some kind of non-verbal affirmation that it's okay first and don't just kiss someone out of nowhere. anyway this song is mid

**NotWith10000Men** (5): this song is a lot more boring than i remember

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Randy Newman has an...extremely mixed status as a composer within the Disney fandom, doesn't he? I'm not musically sharp enough to identify just what exactly makes some of his works not appeal as naturally to the ear as Alan Menken's, but I agree that his composition don't make me quite as enthusiastic. There are still some real gems he's written, though! Within the Princess and the Frog, the obvious standout is Almost There, but Down In New Orleans is also a welcome addition to the movie. Sure, it's arrangement ends up being kind of choppy and weird, but strangely enough I'm able to ignore that in favor of what an enjoyably jazzy introduction is to the film's fictional conception of 1920s New Orleans. With all that being said, Tiana's reprise at the end, is, however, even better.

**FluffyNobody** (6): If only this was sped up a bit, that would be my jam, but like this is a bit bland
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (5): It’s cute enough but there’s so many better songs in the movie (Hell I think I’d rate ‘Gonna Take You There’ higher)
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (5): There are a lot better songs in Princess and the Frog
 
**Steelstepladder** (5): When I first started this rate I thought to myself "I hope people don't do Princess and the Frog dirty" but here I am doing Princess and the Frog extremely dirty

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I don’t really hold any resentment towards Frozen anymore, like I did when I was an immature teenager, but I’m still not an extreme fan of its soundtrack. The music in it is...good, just like the movie itself, but it has a lot of middle of the road songs, and I dunno if Do You Want to Build a Snowman? Is way better than that standard or if it has just a bit more quality to it. The melody here is a little too...childish for me, I guess? With that being said, the reprise at the end is absolutely heartbreaking and another great moment in the film, so I’ll give it a plus.

# YES, PLEASE, I LOVE FUN WINTER ACTIVITIES
 
**bespectacIed** (10): How did these two silly white girls make me cry so much?? That storytelling from childhood to youth to adulthood, and especially the final verse from Anna with the final, desperate "do you wanna build a snowman?" always breaks me. Intimate, emotional moments like this are often overshadowed by the overratedness of Let it Go and the movie itself, but they are present, and they are what has always made Frozen a great movie.
 
**FluffyNobody** (10): I've sung this to whoever has been around me while snowing, and this is me saying sorry not sorry
 
**hikkaru** (10): a crying tonight...
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): cutesy exposition bop
 
**jexan13** (10): The way it transitions from a childish tune to a depressing song is amazing. And the emotion on that last "Do you want to build a snowman?" is overwhelming and makes me cry like no other song on this rate.
 
**rickikardashian** (10): fucking hate how Disney pulled a fast one on us and started this song cute af, and in the middle of all this we have to deal with the death of Anna and Elsa's parents and their lonely grieving, ducking brilliant but damn bitch I wasn't ready for the tears
 
**Steelstepladder** (10): I started listening to this song thinking I was going to probably low ball the Frozen songs but as soon as I started listening to it I realized for as many of Frozen's faults this song is a high point in the movie. I'm actually kind of floored at how good this is.
 
**thegolding** (10): Months ago I was waiting for a bus and there was a kid's party nearby and this song was playing and it made think about my best friend who now lives somewhere else and I basically started crying. I feel you Anna
 
**CarlieScion** (9): better than let it go
 
**waluigiest** (9): wonderful motifs and storytelling, a superior song
 
**agentofscranton** (8): i remember weeping at this the first time I watched frozen
 
**slimboyfriend** (8): The end of this song DESTROYS me, even if it makes zero sense outside of the movie
 
**vayyiqra** (8): shit now i'm thinking about my fucked-up relationship with my older brother and fucking frozen has got me feeling sad on a monday afternoon
 
**1998tweety** (7): Well.... It's a little annoying tbh
 
**J\_Toe** (7): The Mmm Bop of Disney songs (until the third chapter, which hits hard)
 
**nowqueenofpop** (7): The first half of this song is childish fun but like it can get annoying because I’m just waiting for the last third of it with Kristen Bell’s emotional performance. The subtle change in how Anna knocks… her hesitation and the emotional need for her sister…
 
**SFbby** (7): Never built a snowman before :(

**vhqv1997** (9): There’s no heterosexual explanation for this.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (8): One of the biggest memes from the entire canon, in general. It’s not something I’d listen to in my spare time, because I don’t like dwelling on the arrogance of men, but it really does deserve it. No, it’s not up to par with the scariest and most sinister Disney songs, but at least this one is filled with absolute joy; Ashman’s technique towards making songs memorable by listing down a bunch of curiously wonderful descriptions, exaggerations, and innuendos is shown better here than any other place in the movie, which makes the song an absolutely delightful distraction from what’s happening over at the Beast’s castle.

# NO ONE MAKES A SONG AS SUBTEXTUALLY HOMOEROTIC AS GASTON
 
**1998tweety** (10): King can raw me
 
**rickikardashian** (10): I'm glad the remake acknowledged how fucking gay this song is. A small dude that follows I'm admiration a bigger guy everywhere he goes, trying to cheer him up after getting rejected by a girl by singing him a song about how amazing he is? This might as well be called "gay guy tries to flirt with his straight friend that he secretly has a crush on"
 
**Steelstepladder** (10): Has there ever been a bad villain song

**vayyiqra** (5): i barely remember this movie so i am out of the loop but as i understand there are gaston/belle shippers who stan him and argue he's better for her than the beast is but also he was sounding awfully entitled in "belle" and he's not very sympathetic here either. the thought "is gaston an incel" occured to me and my childhood is really dead huh. anyway this song is nothing special and it's really weird
 
**junobeekeeper** (4.3): No song bores like Gaston, goes overboard like Gaston, makes me lie down and snore like Gaston.

**yourhostandpatron** (5): Literally nobody denies that this is the worst song on the entire Lion King soundtrack. Though the actual phrase in itself has become iconic, the annoyance Hakuna Matata thrusts upon me makes me, along with many other people, wish that other foreign language quotes from other Disney plays (yes, Ohana means family, and family means no-one gets left behind) attracted the attention of white people more than this bother of a song. I don’t really have anything against Timon and Pumba’s characters in general, but their voices here are not something to look forward to, and the flatulence joke is just shoehorned out of nowhere, and...ugh, this is just one of my least favourite Disney songs, in general. The only good memory I associate with it is that this is the end, where Adult!Simba emerges in front of the audience. Now, I’m no furry, but in the stage play that scene is...mmmm. Mmmmm. That’s all I’ll say.

**pearllouise** (10): No worries, I’ll give you my ten
 
**rickikardashian** (9.3): Someone called The Bsre Necessities, Under the Sea and this "the songs where the side-kicks sing to the protagonist that they need to chill and be happy with the things they already have" and I hate how accurate this actually is. I'm guessing they stopped releasing songs like this because they knew they wouldn't be able to beat the cultural phenomenon that "Hakuna Matata" would end up becoming

**jexan13** (5): For some reason this song has always made me cringe. Always skipped it when I was a kid

**anothertown** (4): sexy adult simba jumping out and going IT MEANS NO WORRIES made me cringe so much as a child i think that's why i became a lesbian
 
**Steelstepladder** (4): I always feel like people aren't being honest with themselves with how mediocre this is
 
**vayyiqra** (4): i am a very type A person who prefers to either go hard and do something right or not do it at all (as you can see from the effort i put into my comments here) and this song is glorifying a type B, not-giving-a-fuck attitude and it bugs me. as well some of the lyrics are just dumb. there is a whole verse about pumbaa's bowel movements and did we really need that? the instrumental is catchy and kind of fun but i don't really like this song overall and never have
 
**brenda\_official** (3): not great but i enjoy the fart comedy
 
**ImADudeDuh** (3): This song is good for literally 2 measures and thats it, it helps that they repeat it a lot.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (3): this song past the first verse is annoying as shit
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): Yeah I know I’m gonna get a lot of hate for giving this a 0 but I honestly can’t stand this song. There’s an entire fucking verse of this song that’s about fart jokes and y’all listen to this and think “ah yes this is the peak of disney music” are you kidding me?

**yourhostandpatron** (10): I’m giving every song on Hunchback of Notre Dame a 10 and I’m not ashamed to admit it. I know why people’s criticisms of that film exist, but it’s a movie about religious hypocrisy and faith and oppression and disability; I can’t avoid reading myself into it, soundtrack included, and I’d honestly unironically call it not just my favourite movie that Disney’s ever released, but also my favourite movie of all time. (To be fair, I hardly watch films, but you’ve got to assign that distinction to something.) I love it for the same reasons as Les Miserables; Hunchback is a way more inaccurate adaption of a Victor Hugo novel, but I’d be damned if it hit doesn’t hit just as hard. If I really wanted to summarize my love of Hunchback, God Help The Outcasts would serve my purpose; I actually fucking love the premise of a Romani woman (no, I’m not using the g-slur, that’s the only problem I have with the film) who isn’t religious making an appeal to God as she exposes how Christianity was historically whitewashed in medieval Europe, working out the true meaning of the Gospel at the same time: “Were you once an outcast too?” is such a powerful line that exemplifies just how good of a statement Esmeralda is making. There’s so much beauty and lamentation and anger and regret in this song at the same time; musically, it’s a stunning cry for justice that will never fail to get through me when I hear it.
 
**vhqv1997** (9): God help the people who gave this song a low score. This was truly a robbery.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): it’s not as immediately arresting a ballad as most of the other songs but I guess that’s the point with it being the antithesis to the more dramatic hellfire in that though both songs are the characters singing about their opposing relationships with religion.
 
**pearllouise** (8): God doing charity work for outcasts? Ava Max could never.
 
**1998tweety** (7): It's alright

**vhqv1997** (8): I only listened to this song once as a kid, and my juvenile mindest combined with cultural sexism completely clouded my judgment of it, so I couldn’t understand why everybody was adamant on rating it low. But then I read *that* line, and welp, this deserves it. I’d wanted to say that it was a product of its time, but I doubt the situation actually improved that much/at all in China, so uhhh, yeah.
 
**yourhostandpatron** (5): I don’t want to say “Hey, maybe Mulan shouldn’t have been a musical” because Reflection and I’ll Make A Man Out Of You are too amazing to pass out on, but the other two songs on its soundtrack are filler if I’ve ever heard it. I haven’t watched the movie in awhile, but I don’t think I can remember any purpose for this song existing other than it being yet another reminder that everybody in Ancient China was really sexist and thus an obvious obstacle to Mulan’s character arc. Her own part is ironically funny, but other than that I’m giving this a big old ‘nahhhhh’; hearing men as stereotypical as these sing is gross.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): In spite of how dated its narrative is, Sleeping Beauty is just too attractive a film for a sucker like me to hate it; aside from the animation being absolutely gorgeous for its time, and Maleficent being a fantastic villain, there’s Once Upon A Dream; this is pretty much the peak of scores in classic Disney movies, thanks to its operatic qualities syncing incredibly well with the fantastical images of love and romance it stirs up in its audience. You might as well consider this song a turning point for Disney soundtracks thanks to how well its execution still holds up today.
 
**vhqv1997** (8): Let’s be real, if it weren’t for Miss Elizabeth Woolridge Grant, this song would be somewhere at the bottom of the pile. The way this song was hilariously cut in by the prince, thereby reducing Aurora’s screentime and lines even further than they already were, always stands out to me, but I suppose half of us just decided to rate this song as if Lana was the original singer.

# NORMAN FUCKING ROCKWELL IS THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR
 
**agentofscranton** (10): emily osment did a cover of this that is imo one of the greatest cover versions of all time - lana could never
 
**rickikardashian** (10): Honestly at this point, I don't know what it is about these orchestral songs with lyrics about dreaming/wishing/longing for the future that hits me in the right spot. Probably they just remind me of better times where life didn't feel like an obligated chore I was given after being brought to the world without my consent, but they always get me. Also the Lana cover of this song is one of the best reinventions I've heard of a Disney song and deserves more recognition
 
**CarlieScion** (8): [insert comment about lana here]
 
**SFbby** (8): Is it bad that I had never heard of this song until Lana's version
 
**pearllouise** (6): Lana did it better
 
# COMMENTS THAT DIDN'T MENTION LANA
 
**Krogan\_Whisperer** (11): This is pure, peak early Disney. The rotoscoped dancing in a forest, the animal friends reacting to everything, the falling in love with someone you just met. Even the title "Once Upon A Dream" basically screams fairy tale. Its a shame this gets overlooked because Aurora is barely the star of her own movie, but this to me is embodies everything about the early Disney era.
 
**TragicKingdom1** (11): I think of all the songs in the rate this is the one that provokes the biggest feeling of nostalgia and "magic," which is ultimately the main appeal of listening to Disney music for me. Despite considering myself a big Disney fan, I'm not quite so obsessed with the music because there's a certain brand to it that doesn't satisfy me without the right context. So when I am in that Disney mood, this is what hits the hardest, so it's getting my 11.
 
**fortyfive33** (10): This song is actually incredible. Mary Costa and Bill Shirley are perfect as Aurora and Philip and the every single aspect of the song gets its time in the sun.
 
**NotWith10000Men** (10): those high notes. my God. i love phillip's voice and the choir at the end. and the reaction shot from that damn owl lmaooooo
 
**thegolding** (10): Y'ALL SHOULD LISTEN TO THE ARABIC AND THE HEBREW VERSION I MEAN IT
 
**1998tweety** (9): Iconic duet between 2 hot legends
 
**AvatarKanol** (9): Iconic.
 
**FluffyNobody** (9): This has such a sentimental value for me, plus the Tchaikovsky interpolations in Sleeping Beauty? Invented remixes
 
**J\_Toe** (9): best song of the pre-Ariel princesses. I like the owl that shrugs in the movie sequence
 
**jexan13** (8.5): Those notes, goddamn. It's so sad that Aurora didn't sing more... or talk... or do anything but exist and breathe.
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): god i wish that were me
 
**waluigiest** (8): this melody is SO SMOOTH I love it
 
**anothertown** (7): the straights made their point!
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): Snow White vocals, but make it work
 
**silentev** (7): This is one of my favorite duets, but man classic high singing voices haven’t aged very well on the ears.
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (6): It’s cute enough.
 
**junobeekeeper** (5.1): Look I can't give this a high score even though the Lana version is good. I've realized why I dislike a lot of these earlier songs. The singers just sound too much like birds to me.
 
**vayyiqra** (5): i am not sure if i have ever heard this before and it's nothing special
 
**Steelstepladder** (4): the older Disney songs just bore me and I feel bad because the movies are classics but I just don't care about the music

**yourhostandpatron** (10): Tom Hulce and Tony Jay are just such fucking good singers. I’ve hardly seen more of a perfect representation of dramatic conflict between two opposing forces in a musical narrative than the contrast and transition in between Frollo’s to Quasimodo’s singing within the song; Frollo’s shutdown of his adopted son’s desire to go outside into the world is a haunting echo of people’s demands that disabled people hide themselves away from society that non-ironically sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it, but the way Quasimodo gradually begins to reveal his personality through his voice and starts belting out his longing to see the reality of living for what it truly is a glorious counter to that display of wickedness. And *then* Hulce moves up and down through all those magnificent high and low notes like he’s singing for his life. I can’t just help but love what a wonderful song Out There is after I hear that. From my objective perspective, this is the best song Disney’s ever released; I connect to one song in the canon even more, but the beauty of Out There has made a permanent impression on my soul. I’m not exaggerating when I say that I can’t let it go.

# QUASIMODO IS A PRECIOUS CINNAMON ROLL, TOO GOOD, TOO PURE
 
**rickikardashian** (10): The Hunchback of Notre Dame is honestly such a masterpiece that feels so different from other Disney movies. It feels so much more mature than any other animated musical of them, and the soundtrack is complete gold. This one in specific hits you so damn hard it physically hurts
 
**Steelstepladder** (10): My love for Hunchback is never ending
 
**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): This gets a 10 based on the vocals only holy SHIT
 
**Belle- Et-La-Bete** (9): That note at the end.
 
**SFbby** (9): Truly sounds like a disney 'want' song
 
**junobeekeeper** (8.7): Disney repeats themes. Dreaming, wanting to see the world, being a villain. But I'm fine with that as long as they're well executed, which this song is.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): good but depressing and infuriating. Quasimodo deserves rights!
 
**1998tweety** (8): Bopt
 
**bespectacIed** (8): "i am deformed and I am ugly" okay drag me
 
**nowqueenofpop** (8): Catholic dramatics
 
**hikkaru** (7): the first verse is me looking at myself in the mirror
 
**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok
 
**NotWith10000Men** (7): it's interesting that both movies set in france have BIG les mis vibes....
 
**pearllouise** (7): I always thought Hunchback Of Notre Dame was about college football
 
**silentev** (7): Hauntingly beautiful but the music seems to outpower the lyrics and singing at times.
 
# CLAUDE FROLLO DID NOTHING WRONG
 
**FluffyNobody** (6): God the Hunchback's soundtrack is a snooze
 
**vayyiqra** (6): oh great another creepy villain song wait no nvm now it's another "i want" song and it's not bad
 
**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): luke combs outsold
 
**brenda\_official** (2): the worst of the i want songs
