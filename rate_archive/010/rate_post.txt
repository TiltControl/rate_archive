https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5lg43f/rate_the_emo_rate_the_black_parade_v_a_fever_you/

howdy y’all, and **welcome to the first rate thread of the New Year: the *Emo Rate*!!** this is one of the few times you will see me write with proper grammar and punctuation so enjoy it:

---------------------------

time to bring it back to the mid-2000's, everyone. the time of manic panic^tm, an uptick in eyeliner sales, and especially scene screen names on myspace. the main thing propelling these trends to the forefront, however? an emerging teen-pandering trend of singer-songwriter pop punk, with song titles as long as full sentences and emotional lyrics straight out of a diary full of poems (looking at you, pete wentz). this genre of music, over time, came to be dubbed "EMO", short for "emotional", and took teenage hearts by storm. today, we will be discussing four of, if not the, biggest albums of this trend:


## **The Black Parade** vs. **A Fever You Can't Sweat Out** vs. **From Under The Cork Tree** vs. **RIOT!**

#[My Chemical Romance - *The Black Parade*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Parade)

Released in 2006 (and considered by many to be the pinnacle of all emo albums), ***The Black Parade* by My Chemical Romance** is a concept album about a character called "The Patient", as he dies and passes into the afterlife. The third album from the New Jersey-based band is an almost complete departure from their previous albums; their debut *I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love* (2002), and the critically acclaimed *Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge* (2004) both are more punk and post-hardcore based - for example, one of their biggest hits ["Helena"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCCyoocDxBA) is a prime example of mid-2000's almost-punk MTV sound. The band's five members - brothers Gerard and Mikey Way, Frank Iero, Ray Toro, and Bob Bryar - worked together cohesively to deliver their most polished and creatively ambitious output, until Bryar left the group in 2010 and the band broke up for good in 2013.


Contrary to their first two albums, the rock opera takes a different direction and shifts through many genres, from acoustic ballads like "Disenchanted" to unconvential, symphonic prog songs like "Mama" - complete with a Liza Minelli interlude. Influences from Queen to David Bowie are present, giving some of the songs on the album the aesthetic of a glam rock opera, in the vein of *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* or *Ziggy Stardust*. This album is what shot MCR into full public consciousness; previous singles ["I'm Not Okay (I Promise)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhZTNgAs4Fc) and "Helena" had peaked at 86 and 33 respectively on the Billboard Hot 100, but the lead single from this album, "Welcome to the Black Parade", shot up to reach the top 10 (#9, to be exact), and even reached #1 in the UK. The album itself peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200.

*For this rate, we will not be counting the hidden track #14, "Blood", for the sake of having even track lists.*

#[Panic! at the Disco - *A Fever You Can't Sweat Out*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fever_You_Can%27t_Sweat_Out)

There is no band that capitalized on the young, burgeoning modern emo genre as well at Panic! at the Disco, and their debut album ***A Fever You Can't Sweat Out*** proves it. The youngest of all of the bands in this rate, drummer Spencer Smith and guitarist Ryan Ross began to make music with singer Brendon Urie at fourteen years old, before they were discovered by Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz (more on him later) in 2004. The band is known for their ability to cross genres effectively from album to album, reinventing themselves with ease; their sophomore album *Pretty. Odd.* (2008) is primarily folk-based, and their latter albums *Vices & Virtues* (2011) and *Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die!* (2013) jump from dark pop to Depeche Mode-esque electronica, respectively. On the other hand, they are also known for their continued lineup changes: after the *Pretty. Odd.* era was over, Ross, the primary songwriter, left the band, as did bassist Jon Walker, leaving just Urie and Smith, until Smith's departure in 2015.


AFYCSO debuted at #13 on the Billboard 200, but it is the group's best selling record, becoming double platinum in 2015. The single "I Write Sins, Not Tragedies" was a top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100, and today, has become [their most iconic hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LedFwisxLeo), and [something of a meme](https://vine.co/v/iU3D9ZYBZep). The album, as a whole, however, bridges the gap between pop punk and something of higher artistic ambition: rather than being a straightforward "emo" album, elements of electronica ("Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks"), cabaret ("There's A Good Reason These Tables Are Numbered Honey..."), and gothic baroque pop (whatever "Build God, Then We'll Talk" is) are all present, separated into two halves. A wholly unique experience is created from lyrics heavily inspired by Chuck Palahniuk, songs with intricate vocabulary and interpolation, and instrumentation incorporating everything from autotune to accordion, creating something that Billboard once labeled "one of the most polarizing albums of our time". 

*For this rate, we will be counting both "Introduction" (#1) and "Intermission" (#8), for the sake of having even track lists.*

#[Fall Out Boy - *From Under the Cork Tree*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Under_the_Cork_Tree)

***From Under the Cork Tree* by Fall Out Boy** is, by a large margin, the most pure pop-punk album on this list. One can not even begin to mention emo without mentioning the band that is, truly, at it's core: Fall Out Boy. Their sophomore album, released in 2005, bridges the gap between the pop-punk sound encapsulated on their debut *Take This To Your Grave* (2003) and the pop elements of their future albums, like *Folie á Deux* (2008), and does this by implementing strong hooks with the quick riffs of their previous works. This album was the one that made Fall Out Boy famous, made bassist/frontman Pete Wentz an A-list celebrity, and put them in a position to impact the rock scene for years to come. Future singles ["This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNm5drtAQXs) and ["Thnks fr th Mmrs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onzL0EM1pKY) from their third album *Infinity on High* (2007) cemented their place in rock, with the former peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the latter eventually becoming triple platinum. Members Wentz, Patrick Stump, Joe Trohman, and Andy Hurley took a "hiatus" in 2009 after the release of *Folie*, but after four years, the band got back together and released *Save Rock and Roll* (2013), their 'comeback album', followed by a [punk EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_xVBQS-pn4) the same year, and the #1 album *American Beauty/American Psycho* in 2015.


Though not their most popular album when it first debuted, it is their most successful, with over three million copies sold worldwide. Cited as an influence for modern pop-punk bands like Knuckle Puck and Real Friends, the album's long-lasting sound is one to not be ignored. Singles like "Dance, Dance" make their music accessible to the people in almost a bare-boned way, contrary to the overarching artistry of My Chemical Romance or Panic! at the Disco. The purity of their sound is almost refreshing, as their hooks sound familiar yet insanely catchy, and allow for everybody from guitar purists to young teenagers to find something to like, whether it be Trohman's guitar solos or Patrick Stump's unique voice. Because of this, this album can be accredited with bringing the scene to the forefront of pop culture, and making it more than a blip in the radar of mid-2000s rock.

#[Paramore - *RIOT!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot!)

There weren't many female fronted emo bands, but of the ones that were there, none of them did it as well as Paramore. Their 2007 album ***RIOT!*** brought them to popularity, and put Hayley Williams on the same level as other pop-punk princesses like Avril Lavigne and Kelly Clarkson. This album is their sophomore effort, following *All We Know Is Falling* (2005), an album that didn't even make the Billboard 200. Williams, singer and frontwoman of the band, was originally signed as a solo artist under Atlantic Records; however, she wanted to be an alternative music artist in a band rather than a pop princess, and teamed up with brothers Josh and Zac Farro, as well as Jeremy Davis to form Paramore. At the time of *Riot!*, Taylor York was added to the band as a multi-instrumentalist. Their career skyrocketed, and has taken them to headlining tours and high-charting pop hits like ["Still Into You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblL026SvD4) and ["Ain't It Fun"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFEmTsfFL5A). Hayley has also made her presence known as an iconic alt-female vocalist, even in the pop atmosphere (["Airplanes", anyone?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn6-c223DUU))


Because of the vocals and the production, the album has a slightly more polished touch. This album is the least immediately commercially successful of the bunch, debuting at #20 and peaking at #15 on the Billboard 200. It takes into consideration a number of different styles, from power pop to uptempo emotional songs, but still has overarching sounds. The appeal to some is the fact that the album feels simplistic: it takes all the complicated song titles and layers away in favor for solid, catchy pop punk. Singles "Misery Business" and "crushcrushcrush" have some of the catchiest melodies in the genre, and Hayley's powerhouse vocals make for an interesting and enticing listen.

*For this rate, we will be counting "Misery Business - Acoustic Version", for the sake of attempting to have even track lists.*
