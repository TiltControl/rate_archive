let's be real: even i don't know why this is in the rate. i guess i kinda just wanted to see what the wave would be with memes. it's a weird intro, with random noises, followed by radio-sounding waves and part of "there's a good reason these tables are numbered...". a bad choice to lead in the album? sure. it's a minute and a half of my life wasted

---

**skiddos** puts it simply: "What the fuck" as does **123choji**: "bad song nothing to hear". **VerdantShade** also aligns with skiddos, saying "What the fuck is the point of this track…". **letsallpoo** also makes a valid point "I would question this inclusion but I made y'all give scores to Goodnight Gotham and shit so I can't complain". 

there were positive commenters though: **MrSwearword** calls it a "Deliciously weird intro.", and Nerdy_boy_chris quotes Lady Gaga, "Talented, Brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular." 

and **gannade** throws some shade: "lol still better than some songs in this rate"

everyone slandered this song for the most part, and rightfully so. it's, in my opinion, the only terrible non-intro song in the entire rate, with all of the bad parts of this era. cringey lyrics, absolutely terrible autotune, and instrumentation that, to quote **raicicle**, is reminiscent of "a 00s Europop club song".

also. this song is lower than the *intermission*. what the hell guys

---

not everyone hates it though! **kirby31200** praises it: "This song is genius. The lyrics are personal and ooze with AFYCSO P!TAD's trademark cynicism. The lyrics are personally and uncaringly describe the father of guitarist Ryan Ross. This is the first track on the album where singer Brendon Urie gives a particularly good vocal performance. Autotune is used on Urie's voice further perpetuating the sense of going numb to caring, sense by both the narrator and the subject.". and a backhanded compliment was given by **Awhile2**: "Im sure this song is at least in part responsible for the creation of Brokencyde but I dont care, i love it anyways". **Raykel** enjoys it too, getting #deep for a minute: "This song reminds me of why I liked emo/punk music and still have a fondness for it. I used to hate how music was always about love because I couldn't relate to it at the time. I loved when these bands sang about something new and more honest."

the majority of people disliked it, though. naturally. **danmacs109** hated it: "the autotune was really cringy. I think it would have been a much better song without it. idk it feels like they're just trying to force this dual "theme" thing here but it didn't work for me at all, especially in most of the first half of this album." **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** makes fun of the autotune, saying "The shitty autotune makes this sound like a 3OH!3 throwaway, when there’s no autotune it’s just kinda forgettable". #ouch

**OTHER AUTOTUNE COMMENTS**

- **eribertknows**: This is a bad use of autotune. God no. The hook is alright.
- **estreindre**: i kinda like the chorus to this song, but.. normally i'm a SUCKER for voice modulation, so it means something when i say that the autotune on parts of this song sounds Really Bad^^^tm.
- **Nerdy_boy_chris**: That auto tune ruins it I swear to god.
- **superr_rad**: OK Brendon has a beautiful voice, that autotune was a choice.
- **omgcow**: The autotune is hurting me
- **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: I get that it’s autotuned on purpose but that doesn’t make it any better

i can't believe you guys. this track is my second favorite on this album, and you put it lower than the intermission. wow. this track is extremely messy, but still amazing: you have the dueling patrick and pete vocals in the middle, killer vocals in the chorus, and, to cap it all off, pete wentz's emo poetry at the end which is straight out of your middle school diary. 

---

people had issues with everything about the song. **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** found the bright side, commenting "I like the vocal melodies, it’s a little more unique then other songs. I almost took the score down for the end thing though", but people had issues with the beginning, - **ImADudeDuh**: "The beginning was the worst, but it never really got good" - the bridge, - **mother_rucker**: "The spoken word/kind of singing parts in the bridge that kind of devolve into screaming are just really weird lmao. It sounds so dramatic and bizarre and I laugh every time it comes on." - and the end - **Verdantshade**: "Yo Patrick on this song is amazing but............. that outro..... what was Pete thinking ??????????????? holy fuck I cringe so hard listening to it". especially the end. **VioletChutzkee** comments on the full song, calling it "a cringefest from beginning to end."

the fact that this is above two actual songs is appalling. i'm shocked. people gave this song good scores for the meme, i suppose. there isn't anything much to comment on about this track, it splits the album into two parts: the rock/electronic part of the first half, and the cabaret sounds of the second half.

**calltehshots** comments on their 10: "fuck it"

on a more negative note, the comments were mostly just asking why they had to rate this. some people had actual comments, though: **MrSwearword**: "Such soundclash. From knockoff Darude “Sandstorm” to a decent piano number." **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "If I wanted to listen to nyan cat and then the Someone Like You instrumental in the middle of an album then I would have went and done that". **raicicle**: The Berlin techno rave was lowkey more enjoyable than the old-timey piano. But this was fun front to back.

some savagery was also dealt. **timothy444** states: "Man, I'd rather listen to this 13 times than listen to this entire album ever again". wow

this was my 11. i will try to be unbiased. this song is different from the rest of the album, in it's use of downtempo chords and patrick's low tone of voice. however, it does this at the risk of being bland. this song feels like it should be on a different album. personally, i absolutely adore it, and i knew it was gonna get wrecked so i gave it the 11 lol

---

people took issue with the basic-ness of it. **kirby31200** says "This song is forgettable and boring. There's nothing that stands out about the instrumentation. Patrick Stump's vocals are alright during the chorus, but his singing in the beginning is not as good. The lyrics are actually pretty nice.", and **MaySecretlyBeALlama** says that "the entire middle portion of this album really leaves something to be desired in my opinion, which is a shame because it starts off really well". **skiddos** agrees, "It's hard to make comments for the songs on this album - they don't have much substance"

the lyrics were also an object of ridicule. **Awhile2** yelled at the song, "“I'm hopelessly hopeful, that you're just hopeless enough” - SHUT UP PETE WENTZ JESUS CHRSIT", but **estreindre** had a positive thing to contribute: "i like this one a lot! i appreciate how it's slower and more stripped down compared to most of the songs on the album, it sounds really pretty and is a nice contrast to the rest of the album, especially since this song is about at the half way point."

i can't say much about this song, but i will say this: i have listened to so much fall out boy in my life, and yet, i can not recall a single thing about this song. what is up with that? is it the blandness of it, or the fact that it sounds like six other songs on this album? why? i also find it hilarious that no one gave it above an 8. and *this* got able my 11.

there weren't many comments for this one, mostly because it sounds the same as the rest of the album. **superr_rad** puts it how i think of it: "I always forget this exists, so I guess that says something." **estreindre** agrees: "mildly good, but the song just sounds really generic imho.". **Verdantshade** comes in with the retrospective as to *why* it's bad, though, saying it's "A glimpse into overindulgence that does not work well that mars their later music (honestly who thought the da dadadadas were necessary) and anyway the song is BORING AF".

from someone that's seen fall out boy, let me say: this song is amazing live. on tape? not so much. it seems cheesy, and even though the chorus is the most punk they've been post-TTTYG, it seems contrived. there is also a weird screamo part idk

---

**Verdantshade** defends the screaming by saying "I actually really like Chad and Pete's screamo parts and I listen to the song just for it". weirdo. everyone else did Not like it! **estreindre**: "okay, i really love the first like 2/3 of the song and love how rock they are and think that on its own would be good enough to get this song an 8/10. however... that part where they're trying to turn into a heavy metal band when singing before the final chorus sounds so fucking bad lmao". **Nerdy_boy_chris**: "It was pretty good until they did those metal screams". **danmacs109**: "the cringy screaming and his whiny voice really made me hate this song. I'm giving this my 0 and I expect to see this go on day 1.". you were right.

weirdest comment goes to **skiddos**: "I'd like to sleep with Pete Wentz :meghan:". beth, and shadiest comment goes to **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "I really have to commend them for shading Taylor with a song title before Taylor even existed in the music industry"

**calltehshots** tells a story: "Storytime: I once non-ironically moshed to this (in a non-ironic moshpit) at a $15 FOB show for MTV2. I thank Godney everyday I cannot find any of MTV's footage of this online. Also fun fact: like any true teen badass rebel, my mother brought me to that show. She liked it btw."

this song was very slow, and one of the ballads on RIOT!. i remember crying to this song in middle school, but as i grew up i just....wonder why. it sounds strange and odd, almost like it's very contrived. people compared it to christian rock. i agree.

---

**Awhile2** praises it though: "My main complaint with this album (and many other emo albums coming out around the same time), and the main reason why i rank it beneath Paramore’s S/T is the mixing on the distorted guitar just sounds so flat and it honestly gets a little annoying to listen to. This song is a really nice break from that sound", as does **superr_rad**: "Great song!! Something I needed to hear.". **camerinian** draws attention to the flaws, stating "is this christian rock". yikes.

i am very disappointed in all of you! mcr's first song is out, and it's one of my favorites on the album. it is eerie and foreboding, but also grandiose and large sounding. it's thoroughly excellent, with interesting key changes and vocal techniques. i love this song and can't look at it objectively, someone feel free to say the bad things about this song because i can't

---

the length was an issue. **sweetnsoursauce1** states the problem: "idk I don’t like 5 minute songs followed by another 5 minute song". and **Verdantshade** echoes the notion: "I like the idea behind the song and the meaning behind it is really sad and creepy but the song goes on for way too long and I just get bored every time I listen to it". **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** praises it however and is on the right side of history: "An incredible ballad, one of MCR’s best songs tbh, I love the way the song progresses and gives the album kind of a second climax, the chorus feels GIGANTIC, the production on this song is really good too". agreed.

people also naturally made sleep jokes. **Nerdy_boy_chris:** "not making the obvious joke. It's just boring filler". **superr_rad**: "Well the song accurately describes how I feel when I listen to it…on such a high energy album this really sticks out, even though cancer is much slower, it works better."

the comment with the most :tea: goes to **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "maybe I’m just in a shitty mood but what the fuck did I just listen to; getting put asleep and then maniacal screaming just before it's all over? it's like a dramatization of someone listening to a Lana album"

ARE WE GROWING UP, OR JUST GOING DOWN? this song is one of my favorite fall out boy songs, but it comes at the cost of it being generic. some of my favorite lyrics from them are in this song, and patrick seems very genuine. however, it is repetitive, and some people may have found flaw in the fact that this was in the middle of the album, among like six tracks that all sound the same.

---

people made fun of the lyrics *a lot*. **Awhile2**: "“The best part of "Believe" is the "Lie" I hope you sing along and you steal a line” Like did wentz see the irony in this?!?! Hes following up one of his most trash lines (and it has plenty of competition) by saying he hopes someone will steal one of his lines". **Verdantshade**: "are we growing up or just going down ?????? holy shit i hate this lyric". **kirby31200** is the sole lyric supporter: "Second best track on the album. My favorite lyrics on the album.". 

**eribertknows** delivers honest facts that a lot of people probably agree with: "None of these songs are particularly bad, but they’re all too similar and they all scream “I am a 12 year old who listens to good music and hates my parents” and I’m not a big fan of that.", and **superr_rad** jokes "This rate is putting the EMO in EMOTION". tru

this song begins the trend of the blander songs on the album, according to many. i appreciate what they were trying to do on this song, and i especially appreciate the changes in tempo and syncopation through the chorus, as well as the prominent basslines throughout the song. the band really delivers on this one, with lyrics about love and great instrumentation all around

---

**kirby31200** definitely mentions why this album has consistently gotten 7s: "These next 3 songs are truly a sophomore slump, far from comeback of the year unfortunately. This song's speed and energy is fun, but it ends up making the song more forgettable." people were getting angsty, though! **camerinian**: "I’ve never wanted to jump into a moshpit so desperately in my life". **Nerdy_boy_chris**: Man, I'm turning angstier by the second. And I love it.

lyrics were, again, an issue. @ pete wentz. **MrSwearword** has an issue with the chorus: "“Keep quiet/Nothing comes as easy as you” EWW". musically, however, it was also a mess. **estreindre** comes in with the production flaws: "the audio mixing on this song is TERRIBLE. for half of the song i literally can't hear a single thing that patrick is singing because of how loud the guitars are, it's ridiculous and i have no idea how this song got past production. the song sounds solid when i can actually hear him, but i can't really justify giving this song a good score with that huge glaring problem."

this song, instrumentally, is amazing. you have killer basslines, catchy drum beats, and the overall vibe. definitely the most real-sounding song on the album, which is saying something. however, this song is just....strange. there is no real purpose in this song, it sounds mostly like a parody of what one would think a panic! song would sound like.

- **Nerdy_boy_chris**: Did Mr. Mosbey make this song? But I love the Latin instruments

now that that's over, some people gave it high praise! **kirby31200:** "One Urie's strongest performances on this album. The piano and drums especially shine. The religious/church imagery is a plus for the vocals. This song is perfectly angry and defiant.". **spacebabe27**: "The beginning of this song shows off a softer more understated side of Brendon Urie’s vocals and it’s honestly so good for him."

others just called it boring, though. **estreindre** says its forgettable: "okay, first off, the intro to this song before brendon starts actually singing sounds SOOOO good. i really really love the verses for it too, and the little bit after the chorus where he says "DOUSE THE LIGHTS!", even if the chorus itself falls a bit flat for me. i will say, though: even though this song is overall pretty great, it's a bit forgettable compared to the rest of the album imho." and **mother_rucker** says "I used to listen to this album religiously, and this is the only song I couldn’t remember at all." yikes

**Lowest scores:** 3 (x1): THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD. 4 (x3): nijomemo, JoshuaReddit, ImADudeDuh

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAgbZdrWiN4)**

extremely fitting album opener. right from the get go, we are thrown into fall out boy and their sound as artists, maturing from their debut album "take this to your grave" to a more polished, pop punk sound. the melodies are strong, and the riffs are excellent. the lyrics speak straight to us, as listeners: "brothers and sisters, put this record down", yet they can be cringe-y at times. just like the band!

---

everyone appreciated it as an opener. **calltehshots**, the highest scorer and resident fob stan, says it is "Everything Panic's "London Beckoned..." wanted to be but couldn't. A bop. An iconic opener.", while **123choji** is more simple: "good opener!". others were bothered by it, like **ImADudeDuh** who said it was "Forgettable and I hate that "open until christmas line,""

lots of people called out the titles. **Awhile2**: "Maybe If We Mask Our Music In Weird Title Aesthetics No One Will Realize How Mediocre It Is", **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Aside from the extra song title, this is pretty good", and **raicicle**: "A truly #edgy title." all mention it. **skiddos**: "There isn't anything special about this song and these titles are so extra" too. and **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "too bad they didn’t make you change it to something FUCKING SHORTER".

the only difference between martyrdom and suicide part 2, basically. this song goes *in* right from the start, showing all the electronic sounds that will be used with force. it takes influence from novels, as does much of the album - referencing chuck palahniuk books. it is interesting, but also falls flat coming after a track like the only difference. i will say that i've stanned this album for years now and i still don't know all the lyrics cause i don't know what he says very well on this. it's a diss to the critics!

---

**eribertknows** sums it up: "This should just be called "The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage Part 2 But Not As Good As The First One and With a Weird Switch-Up Near The End In An Attempt To Give The Song Identity”".

the whole energy of this song is based on sarcasm, and people noticed that! **MaySecretlyBeALlama** says: "this song is dripping with satire of scene culture and it's great". **MrSwearword:** "Disinterest in what the critics say, but this song is a diss track against them…seems legit.". **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** doesn't like it, though: "I apperciate what the band is trying to say in this song but it's not doing things for me." oh well.

also: the wet dream lyric. **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "“wet dream for the webzine” gives J. Cole teas but even dumber and more awkward"

i realize in my original post i titled this "misery business - acoustic business" as a joke, but people actually thought that was the song title so this is my formal apology. anyway, why would paramore think it's a good idea to take a song that is already on the same album, one that is praised for the punchiness, and water it down by doing an acoustic version? i don't understand. this is misery business for white mothers.

---

the acoustic definitely lost the punch of the song. **Verdantshade**: "Half as punchy and half as enjoyable as the original song and therefore gets half the score". **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "It’s not bad in acoustic form but it feels like it’s missing something". **mother_rucker**: "The lyrics are problematic, plus the acoustic version sucks out the energy that the original had.". 

people called attention to hayley's voice, too. **Raykel** praises her: "The acoustic doesn't add much to the original except that it proves what an amazing voice Hayley Williams has." and **superr_rad** falls in love: "Hayley’s voice is sooooo good shit.". the people praising it loved it, though. **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** acts like they just went to heaven: ".I mean this is just acoustic perfection? Perfection is perfection." and **calltehshots** takes a more modern approach: "I’m dabbing tbh"

this song sounds more like something you'd hear over the loudspeaker at a cabaret than a song. maybe that's the vibe they were going for. who knows. this song, though messy and strange and all around odd, has some of the most iconic panic! moments: the way brendon says *nitroglycerine* never leaves your head. its also one of their best examples of in-song storytelling that they tend to implement. 

---

**estreindre** goes off: "okay, confession time: this used to be my all-time favorite song. listening to it again, it's a lot rougher than i remembered, but you know what?? i'm still gonna defend this song until i DIE. does this song have problems?? yes, definitely: the chorus is pretty lame, especially the lyric "haven't you heard that i'm the new cancer?" which has always been one of my least favorite lyrics of all time. however, the melody in this song-- especially the trumpets-- are ON POINT. the verses are really great, the first verse especially, and i love the little story this song tells. brendon's voice mostly sounds pretty great on this song, the way he alternates between singing and sing-talking. the part where he sings "when you're in black slacks with accentuating off-white pinstripes, whoa" is probably my single favorite part on the entire album. now, normally, all of this would only get this song an 8 for me, because of how lame the chorus is. but the last thirty seconds where he's all "so of course i'll be distracted when i spike the punch" sounds SO INCREDIBLE, especially the third time around where it's really slowed down. i absolutely LOOOOVE that part and it's my second-favorite part on the entire album. i still can't justify giving this song a ten, but it gets pretty darn close for me!"

the influences were...interesting. **camerinian** says: "Okay now we’re doing swing music? This rate is full of goddamn surprises" and **spacebabe27** mentions the other musical stylings: "Maybe these vaudevillian influences are 2vintage4me but this song is so stagnant the whole time and kind of boring. Also TUL the line “I’m the new cancer, never looked better” was ghostwritten by Halsey". speaking of that line, **MrSwearword** would like to add: "“I’m the new Cancer” is a really fucking bad line." yeaaaaah
