melodically, this song is the best on the album. it is extremely catchy and gets itself lodged in your head with ease. in the scope of the album, it is one of the most emo, while also fitting in with the theatrical aesthetic. intense and driving, this bop has headbanging riffs on guitar and great vocals by gerard. also: lyrics about vampires, for some reason.

---

some thought it sounded dated and generic. **calltehshots**: "A good song but kiiiinda generic and blah for what's going on thematically in this album. "omg my life sucks i drink too much woe is me wah wah #relateableemo". **kirby31200**: "This song, like many MCR songs, suffers from having instrumentation that isn't too special, especially in comparison to the lyrics and Gerard Way's unique voice.". **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "this and This Is How I Disappear probably sound super different but it feels like I just listened to the same exact song twice? like what the fuck I remember nothing about the track from 4 minutes ago". **Verdantshade**: "It's catchy but probably the one song that hasn't stood the test of time......". **Awhile2** expressed his anger: "nothing i love more in a song than some obnoxious panning whispering vocals", and **eribertknows** agrees: "The catchy hook doesn’t do enough to save the song from that whispering shit in the beginning. That’s too emo even for emos. The lyrics are quite interesting again."

some people stanned this song though! **estreindre**: i fucking loooove gerard's voice during the first verse of the song. i'm also a huge fan of the half-second pause during "why don't you blow me a kiss before she goes?", because even though it's a bit immature it also says a lot about the singer imo, bc of how he starts saying "screw you" to her before changing his mind at the least second. and, once again, the chorus to this song is FANTASTIC and absolutely makes me want to rock the fuck out." **Raykel:** "That one line in the second verse that meant you were a devoted stan if you sang it loudly with passion, "Juilet loves the beat and the lust it commands. Drop the dagger aND LATHER THE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS, ROMEO!"". **skiddos**: "I think we need some MCR in 2017"

this is one of the slowest songs in the rate, but one of the most sentimental. at the end of the album, it acts as a closer, looking back on the Patient's life in retrospective, and his memories along the way. famous last words is more of an epilogue, if this is looked at as the end of the album, it is very very sentimental, and the inflection in gerard's voice is one of true pain. 

---

**estreindre** stanned it: "okay i know i said on cancer that gerard's voice doesn't really work for ballads, but when it's a ballad with a more rock twinge like this, it is AMAZING. even aside from how fantastic the song sounds, this song has maybe my favorite concept from the whole album, where he realizes on his death bed how meaningless his whole life has been. add onto this a REALLY great guitar riff in the background, and this song is absolutely fantastic." **Raykel** agrees: "I love it when a singer is almost breaking down when singing the lyrics. You can say what you want about Gerard's voice, but his passion is out of this world.". **Verdantshade**: "I Don't Love You was the song that got me into MCR but this was the song that got me hooked - it's definitely the saddest song on the album and obviously came at a time when I was starting to grow up and be a teen, and at the time I was beginning to be disillusioned with a lot of things and as such is the most relatable song on the album for me".

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** thought it was vampire-y: "Not a bad ballad, but it kinda feels like it should be on the OST for a vampire teen drama and that bugs me a little". **VioletChutzkee**: "This song addresses some of the personal worries I have about dying. A fun and light listening experience!" **danmacs109**: "this song is basically me_IRL".

**ImADudeDuh**'s mind goes elsewhere: "There was a good mashup with this and Broccoli and it was all I could think about while listening"

ffourthofjuly: #18: Panic! at the Disco - The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage

Average: **7.364**

**Lowest scores:** 1 (x1): ThereIsNoSantaClaus. 3 (x1): ImADudeDuh. 4 (x2): imnoteventhatfunny, danmacs109.

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16cEEM6oRAA)**

they swore to shake it up, and we swore to listen. acting as the true opener for this album, we are thrust into the sound of panic! at the disco, and are effectively introduced to all the themes they cover. we get cabaret, we get pop punk. we get circus vibes, and also strip club vibes. it's mainstream emo music with an electronic twist, and we can hear it as the audience.

---

for a song that got so high, people were lukewarm about it. **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The mixing of this song feels very weird and I really don't like the lyrics and the message it's trying to send. The song got slighty better at the end but eh, my first impression on this album is not good. :/". **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** titled this song "The Only Difference Between Extra Ass Song Titles and Normal song titles is like 17 words like these" and elaborated: "Boring pop punk song, but i’m grading harsher for that shitty long title. I hate the way he sings trophy wihiveees and there are a bunch of other little annoying moments that make me not like it at all". **Awhile2** was similar: "The Only Difference Between Brendon Urie and Pete Wentz is Slightly Less Edge and Slightly More Artistic Merit".

there were supporters. **estreindre**: "this used to be one of my least fave songs on the album so i was expecting to rate it a lot lower but... MAN, that breakdown in this song is so good?? wayyy better than i remembered it being. the chorus is also super good and catchy, but my biggest problem with it is how unnecessary verse 2 feels (like it lasts for, what, ten seconds??)". **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "A BANGER. They swore to shake it up and I'm shook.". **superr_rad**: "Holy shit I love this band and this song so much, this is a great opener. “Desperate for attention” me_irl". **eribertknows** just kept it simple: "So fucking catchy."

ffourthofjuly: #17: Paramore - Let The Flames Begin

---
Average: **7.460**
Controversy score: **1.545**

---
**Highest scores:** 10 (x4): spacebabe27, MrSwearword, omgcow, misguidedzombie.

**Lowest scores:** 5 (x5): calltehshots, CandlePrince, letsallpoo, MaySecretlyBeALlama, ImADudeDuh, danmacs109.

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W__2HgWjLg)**

---

with the lowest score being just a five, you would think this song would get higher. like the fall out boy songs before it, it wasn't that anybody hated it, but rather, nobody felt enough about it to warrant a higher/less average score. this song has good melodies, but comes down to being just another paramore song - and the scores suffered because of that.

---

**camerinian** summed up a lot of people's opinions: "This is basically, from what I can ascertain, a middle-of-the-road Paramore song. Like it’s still good because Paramore have a fairly high bar of quality, but it just isn’t too distinct". **estreindre** agrees: "it's not a bad song but it just sounds... so generic, honestly? it feels like i've heard this song a billion times already. hayley's voice also doesn't sound that great here either, it sounds a bit strained.". **danmacs109**: "decent song but i liked part 2 from their self-titled more.". **skiddos**: "This is very much of a filler track"

**Verdantshade** likens it to another: "Like When It Rains, the melodies in the song are so good. It kind of drifts about though and if the song lasted any longer it'd be pretty bad, but as it is it is fantastic. BUT PART II IS BETTER (THAT BREAKDOWN >>>>)". **123choji** ponders his existence: "gosh why did i do this rate in the first place".
and **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** acknowledges the chorus: "So Nice of Hayley to promote Britney's new album in this song!".

when these rates were coming in, this song's placement fluctuated for a while. for a point, it was #1. at another, it was #20. for a song with 12 tens, it is so surprising that it didn't even make the top 10, and wasn't even going to make day 2 had i revealed 20 songs yesterday. it's one of the most iconic mid-2000's emo songs: who doesn't know that opening verse? brendon's voice is low but full of energy, and you're thrown right into the heat of the moment. i remember first hearing this song driving around in saints row 2.

**estreindre** gives an analysis: "y'all. this song is AMAZING. brendon's voice sounds beautiful during the verses (and negl, the way he sings "is it still me that makes you sweat?" used to make me have a huge crush on him haha), and the chorus is EXPLOSIVE and a really great contrast to the rest of the song. i also really love how chaotic the song gets for a few seconds after the first chorus before the verse starts again. the lyrics to this song, while nothing super deep, sound GREAT just phonetically whenever he sings them (esp. "so testostorone boys and harliquen girls"), which is a running theme throughout the album but sounds especially great here. unlike a lot of songs on this album this never really suffers from repetitiveness to me either, i've probably listened to this song over thirty times throughout my life and it's never once gotten old to me. i'm REALLY hoping this is the top song from a fever you can't sweat out, even though the winner is obvs gonna be i write sins not tragedies." sorry girl. **camerinian** agrees: "My pussy is drenched". **Nerdy_boy_chris**: "His voice on the verses gives me feelings I've rarely felt before. And that chorus is awesome."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** did not like it: "This Song Title Can Eat My Ass (aka Lying is the Most Fun…) I wanna say that this is entirely from the title but I don’t like the song either". **superr_rad** gave a backhanded compliment: "kings of slut shaming" and **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** throws shade: "Mr. Brightside did it better tbh" as does **letsallpoo**: "is this shawn mendes". **mother_rucker**: "This song just creeps me out. I can’t really put my finger on why. I guess it just seems unhealthy to be that fixated on your ex-girlfriend’s sex life. And hearing Brandon sing that he’s got a better fuck just sounds really off to me. Idk."

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dWYflkZhC8)**

right from the get-go, we are introduced to the punchiness of hayley williams and the sound of paramore. for an opener, this song is excellent. hayley's vocals come in with force and strength, hitting you right from the start. this opener is one of the best of the mid-2000s, and one of my favorite paramore songs. well done.

---

**MrSwearword** agrees with me: "Damn strong opener" as does **Nerdy_boy_chris**: "a great and energetic album opener.". **sweetnsoursauce1** has a hot take: "best intro of the four, song title describes my teenage years". **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** offers insight: "basically I Knew You Were Trouble if Taylor went emo instead of pop. fun to imagine screaming this in the face of that one friend that backstabbed you or the stan who sabotaged your fave in the pop girl rate". **estreindre** explains just exactly *why* this song is so good: "i really how this song opens up immediately with a really good guitar riff! hayley's voice also sounds REALLY great on this track, and the pre-chorus is fantastic. the chorus is a bit too screamy for me honestly, and the song overall sounds a tad generic, but it's really strong overall!". 

there were nearly no negative comments! **kirby31200**: "An energetic and angry opener. Sets the tone for album really well." **camerinian**: "God knows why, but I always liked the syncopated rhythm the instrumentation takes in the opening, sets up the album really well".

personally, this is one of my favorite panic! songs. it tells the story of a strip club, and the instrumental echoes that. it is jumpy and propelled by an excellent piano riff. it's easy to get lost in the melody, and the way brendon says "daquiri". the syncopated rhythm in the chorus is one of the most inventive in the rate, and the way the song segues into i write sins not tragedies is amazing.

---

**COMMENTS ABOUT THE FADE INTO IWSNT**: 

- **spacebabe27**: That fade to the intro of I Write Sins… added about a point to my rate of this song.
- eribertknows**: This song gained 1 point for that effortless transition to I Write Sins Not Tragedies
- **skiddos**: THIS TRANSITIONING INTO I WRITE SINS I'M SHOOK
- **mother_rucker**: I live for the ending when it segues into the superior “I Write Sins Not Tragedies”

**Reifiui** loves it: "Right after Intermission this album takes a huge spike up in quality holy shit". **MrSwearword**: "GOD HAVE MERCY the way he pronounces naivete.". **camerinian**: "Fuck me that piano line is good, the hook is good, the groove is good, all that adds up damn well". **kirby31200**: "This song perfectly captures AFYCSO's aesthetic. The piano and Urie's voice on this song are excellent. The stutter definitely adds to the narration.". **VioletChutzkee**: "This song is so much fun. It captures that cabaret atmosphere really well and I'm a big fan of Brendon's vocal theatrics. Definitely my favorite on the album.". 

**raicicle** brings up a flaw: "Song’s not that bad, but this song did make me realise that I don’t actually like Brendon Urie’s voice on this record at points even if the songs are quite good. It’s mixed kinda strange, and brings out a lot of weird qualities.", but *Awhile2* counters that by discussing the bassline: "this is like the first song on this rate so far where the bass has had a crucial part in a song and as a bass player i appreciate that". **superr_rad** goes abstract though? random comment from her: "Fuck the police" ??????

this, by far, is fall out boy's catchiest song. it's cute, fun, and poppy, and everything adds up for a great pop-punk song. every element works, and even though it is the least famous of the three fall out boy singles left, it's probably the most poppy, and the most suited for radio.

---

those that loved it, *loved* it. **estreindre**: "i remember this used to be my favorite fall out boy song! and honestly, when it comes to this album at least, i wasn't wrong. it's easily the song that makes me want to dance the most, especially with that fantastic pre-chorus. it's hard for me to really explain what it is about this song that works for me, but everything about it just sounds REALLY fantastic imho.". **raicicle** agrees: "Pretty much a distillation of that classic pop punk sound."

**Verdantshade** tells a story: "I read a post on reddit about someone who lost their virginity while listening to this song.... wtf ?? also it should have been the lead single bc it's the catchiest song on the album". and both **bluehxrizon** and **Awhile2** are on the same wavelength: "into you is shook" and "id much rather have a little less conversations and a little more touch my body tbh"

i don't like this song. but i know a lot of people do so i will try to be impartial. gerard is at his most emotional here, singing from the Patient's perspective as he deals with his cancer before his death.

---

alright, lets get this out of the way:

- **Verdantshade**: I can't hear this without thinking of how Twenty one pilots bastardised this and utterly RUINED it
- **calltehshots**: twenty one pilots could literally never
- **camerinian**: This honestly gets an extra point because it isn’t the fucking dumpster fire of the Twenty One Pilots version.
- **Nerdy_boy_chris**: 21 piløts ruin everything øøøøøø
- **123choji**: giving this 8 bc 21P covered it
- **MaySecretlyBeALlama**: I didn't like this song before but then TOP fucking butchered it and literally gave me cancer and I appreciate it a lot more now
- **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: Hey, wouldn’t it be nice if another band decided to record a shitty cover of this song even though they highkey don’t have half the talent of MCR? That would be something, especially if most of their fanbase probably didn’t even realize it was a cover and were wondering when they started writing lyrics that weren’t trash or were surprised there wasn’t embarrassing white guy rapping on it for no reason

ok now that that's over: **spacebabe27**: "This song makes me so emotional for a multitude of reasons, one of them being that it is so well made. This song in particular seems to really display Bowie and Queen influence but in a very original way. Honestly the magnum opus of the truly sad emo kid songs". **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Grab your tissues and try not to cry when listening to this song.". **skiddos**: "Short and sweet". **raicicle**: "Despite the fast songs being the core of this album, this song is genuinely brilliantly sad and heartfelt.".

coming after the end, the energy of this song is absolutely **INSANE**. gerard starts the song off right a scream, following by an amazing guitar solo, throwing right into the controlled chorus. throughout the song, the bounciness is real, and every element stays perfect as the song goes on, especially with the breakdown in the bridge. what's a my chemical romance song without impassioned screaming from gerard?

---

the local mcr stan **ThereIsNoSantaClaus** talks about how good this song is: "This was my SHIT in like 9th grade and I fucking love this song still, I love how energetic this album can be with such depressing subject matter, those horns and harmonies on the bridge give me life seriously, LA L AL AL ALALALAL LALALALA". **superr_rad** loves it: "Omg this song is amazing!! It’s catchy af and clearly conveys the aesthetic they’re going for, im literally dead!/dying/screaming". **camerinian** also describes it accurately: "After re-listening to this album, I realised I’m gonna have a really hard time rating much of it lower than a 9. Those fucking howls at the start of the track kick off an insane rollercoaster of a track.". **estreindre**: "how tf was this song not a single?? it's SUCH a fantastic bop, the guitars on this song are fantastic and the chorus is KILLER. i also really love the lyrics to it, the tongue-in-cheek nature to the patient finding out he's going to die makes this a really fun "real "start to the album imo!! personally, i feel like it speaks to how amazing this album is when this is only like the third best song from it.".

in the negatives: **eribertknows**: The overly repetitive ending kinda ruined this for me. **letsallpoo**: "These songs are so extra and dramatic, I'm not sure if I like it or not. Also he started screaming again so that wasn't pleasant".
**mother_rucker**: "The mixing just sounds really off to me. The instrumentals sound reallyyy grating and not in a good way, and Gerard’s vocals are too quiet."

okay, i will take this opportunity to defend my zero. i truly hate this song. i hate the way it sounds, i hate gerard's voice, i hate the basic ass melody, i hate the chorus, i hate the fact that it does not fit on the album whatsoever. it's annoying and i hate it so much. but, it got fifteen tens, so it must be doing something right i guess. i don't know. feel free to tell me why it's good because i don't know.

---

**camerinian** discusses their 11: "Ok, real talk, I got into most of these albums a good 3-4 years after they came out, but I heard Teenagers at release, and it blew my little fucking 10-year old mind. Such wild passion and reckless abandon in every single element of this track, this sparked a genuine love affair with music that has branched out into so many differing paths. I have listened to this song repeatedly for over a decade now and I’m not remotely sick of it, it’s probably in my top 5 songs of all time. If I could give this more than an 11 I would do so in a heartbeat". **estreindre**: "okay, when i was actually a teenager i thought this song was super embarrassing and tried way too hard to be "edgy." i HATED it. but listening to it again now... holy shit is it a BANGER. i still agree to an extent that the lyrics are a bit *eyeroll emoji*, but GOD it is such a fucking bop, i can't help but give it a super high score. also "so darken your clothes or strike a violent pose / maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me" is the most middle school emo lyric ever and i love it??". 

others discuss their memories: **mother_rucker**: "Lol I remember in middle school when everyone loved this song because they got to sing along and say the word “shit” in the chorus and feel badass." **mirandacrocsgrove**: "I’m not a teenager anymore yet I still feel the same way I did when I first heard this song more than a decade ago. I hope this does well in the rate.". and others call out the flaws: **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Really overplayed and kind of overrated, also doesn’t really fit the album much either, but still a good song. I kinda wish it was a bonus track cause it doesn’t fit here sonically or thematically. Rip". **omgcow**: "This entire song is cringe, I could barely get through it". **MaySecretlyBeALlama** appreciates the angst though!: "fuck yeah angst"

when i first began this rate, i absolutely *hated* this song. however, listening to it more and more for the purpose of rating it, i began to weirdly appreciate it. the instrumentals in the verses are creative and take influence from spanish guitar music. the bassline is also strong and, as a bass player, i admire that. it's inventive and unlike anything else on RIOT!, which is a good thing. who would've guessed this would make top ten?

---

the only negative comments come from **123choji**: "ahhh this is torture", and **calltehshots**: "the "dyiiiing dyiiiiing" part is unbearable and maybe it’s because this comes right after We Are Flopping but I'm bopping tbh"

everyone else adored it. **estreindre**: "this song is so good!!! the guitar is KILLER, both the electric guitar and the acoustic one being strum in the background. this song feels like it has a ton of energy put into it, and the part after the chorus with them snapping after hayley sings "and you'll go out in style" sounds SOOOO good.". **kirby31200**: "Legit if I didn't give my 11 to Dance, Dance I would've given it to this song. Great energy, drums are great on this track. The lyrics are awesome,: cheery, demeaning, sarcastic". **skiddos** makes a statement: "I wanna shimmy to this". accurate. **camerinian**: "Wow the groove on this thing, it’s like surf rock/jazz/idk but I dig it".

**letsallpoo** goes on a trip down memory lane: "DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THIS NEOPETS YOUTUBE VIDEO OR SOMETHING FROM A LONG TIME AGO THAT USED THIS AS THE BACKGROUND MUSIC??? I'M SHOOK THIS SONG JUST REAWAKENED THIS RANDOM-ASS MEMORY FOR ME". and **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** delivers some emojipasta tea: "YEAH YEAH WELL YOU'RE JUST A MESS 👌😫 💯💯💯"

acting as the epilogue to this epic album, famous last words serves to close the concepts of death and the afterlife. it does this with theatrics, as gerard growls over a guitar riff that just keeps pushing forward. it's like a catharsis: after going through this entire album, you need something like this, with a big, wall-of-sound-esque chorus, and a catchy hook. it also serves as a motivational plea, giving the album purpose, and the song message.

---

**estreindre** delivers a research paper on their 11: "here we go: my favorite song on this masterpiece of an album. usually i'm not a big fan of an album's ending songs, but this song is too good-- especially in the context of the album-- not to get my 11. first off, the story this song tells as a closer to the rest of the album is absolutely beautiful and hands down the best out of any of the songs on the album. the patient singing to his lover for one last time while he's on his deathbed, asking them to please just stay with him until his bitter end. the fact that he's accepted the fact that he's going to die and knows there's nothing either of them can do to stop it, followed up by the bridge where he sees the light and is finally dying, and the second chorus right afterwards with him seeing his lover on his death bed with him so he tells her for the last time how much he loves her is just... heartbreaking to me. and i absolutely LOVE how at the end, everything except for the main vocals of the song fade out and for a few seconds the tune of a organ playing a funeral song starts fading in instead. everything about this song conveys a beautiful message and lyrics that i absolutely adore and give this song so much depth that i feel it doesn't get appreciated enough for. on top of that, this is a really optimistic track overall to end an otherwise pretty down and depressing album, and on its own terms the chorus makes this song a pretty incredible "you can do it!" anthem. if all that wasn't enough, this song is a BANGER, the melody on this is so fucking good, gerard's voice sounds incredible and super emotive (especially on the first fifteen seconds), and the climax to this song at the chorus always pumps me up super hard. i don't know how coherent i sound here but just... this is an absolutely fantastic song, and i hope it does as well as it deserves on the rate."

other supporters: **Verdantshade**: "Honestly a perfect song - the guitars are incredible and it rocks and the last minute of the song has some of the best vocals I've ever heard". **imnoteventhatfunny**: "when i was thirteen this was like the greatest song ever made and it's still fucking incredible". **calltehshots**: "The best song on the album, I'm lowkey #emo-tional". **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This was pretty much always my favorite song from this album. It’s such an epic, unhinged finale for this story and I love it so much. Gerald Way’s vocals are at some of their BEST on this song, and the whole thing just feels weary and desperate. I love the guitar solo and the buildup to one final epic chorus to close everything out, just like WTTBP its this huge sounding story, pretty much bringing together all the best elements from the album around it to create an enormous moment. I’m kinda babbling about my love for this song and I’m sorry but its pretty much my favorite MCR song and it’s amazing". **mother_rucker**: "Really fantastic closer. Very dramatic in all the right ways.". **Awhile2** hates it but justifies giving his score: "this song probably deserves lower than a 6 but im just so happy that im finally done with this album i’ll give it a 6 anyways" #yikes

listening to this song brings back so much memories. it's virtually perfect, and paramore's best. it toes the line between sentimental and punchy, giving a punk tone to the romanticism of the chorus. it's basically emo in a nutshell. it also serves as a bridge between hayley's emotions and her outward personality, with the lyrics being full of love but the instrumental saying otherwise, giving another deeper perspective on the song.

---

**superr_rad** throws it back to my first experience with this song: "I PLAYED THE SHIT OUT OF THIS ON GUITAR HERO DS". **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** loves it: "Man, if I could give two 11's, this would totally get it. This and Misery Business take me way the fuck back. Even with nostalgia factor, this goes fucking H A R D.". **estreindre**: "HERE IT IS, the best paramore song bar none. i have NO idea why this wasn't the most famous song from this album, it's so fucking bad-ass. this song feels like the darkest (instrumentally) from the album and it sounds GREAT with hayley's voice. the pre-chorus where she whispers "crush, crush, crush" makes the chorus where hayley is practically yelling sound even better. negl the chorus is actually like the only reason i love this song so much, but because the rest of the song serves mainly as build up to the chorus and is also all pretty darn good in its own right, i'm okay with that.". **Verdantshade**: "The song and video are so hot and I think this song single handedly developed my crush on Hayley Williams" AGREED.

some people hated it for some reason? **calltehshots**: "corny as hell even for emo music". **MrSwearword**: "Kinda boring as fuck to be honest.". **eribertknows**: "No thanks". ??????

ffourthofjuly: #6: Paramore - That's What You Get

---
Average: **8.641**
Controversy score: **1.504**

---
**Highest scores:** 11 (x3): spacebabe27, bluehxrizon, CandlePrince. 10 (x12): Verdantshade, Nerdy_boy_chris, skiddos, mirandacrocsgrove, sweetnsoursauce1, alternativeoxygen, danmacs109, misguidedzombie, Mudkip1, camerinian, JoshuaReddit.

**Lowest scores:** 5 (x1): Reifiui. 6 (x4): eribertknows, FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, letsallpoo, BearlyEvenAPun. 

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNyKDI9pn0Q)**

---

the second best paramore song. much like crushcrushcrush, this song succeeds in the juxtaposition of heavy riffs and guitars and hayley's sweet lyrics. the lyrical prowess here is amazing: her voice in the chorus is one of the best hooks in all of emo music. she expresses herself with regret, and the emotion in her voice is very telling. i would've pegged this to be top 5. 

---

**Verdantshade** puts it simply: "LITERALLY. POP. PERFECTION. Guitars are incredible and Hayley's voice literally soars". everyone loved it: **raicicle**: "A pretty straightforward pop song at its heart, and it’s aged incredibly well. The shifting time signature is really clever too, and adds a lot of depth.". **camerinian**: "A decade later and this is still the best song Paramore has ever made. So cathartic, so much punch, damn I love this song.". **spacebabe27**: "Amazing song, catchy melody, great instrumental there just isnt enough good i can say about this song. Honestly one of if not the best song to come out of this entire music scene". **sweetnsoursauce1**: "THIS DESERVED BETTER ON THE CHARTS and it made me fall in love with bright red hair". **superr_rad**: "Her voice is so damn good."

**estreindre** takes a break from the in depth analyses to deliver a story: "okay i want to do a good write up about this song but. all i can think about whenever this song plays is how. okay, so when i was twelve, i left a total drama roleplay website. on the post where i announced i was leaving my (also like 12 years old) best friend on this website said nothing but posted a link to this song as a reply to the post, then never talked to me again (even when i tried talking to her on skype), and i still have no idea what the fuck she meant by that. twelve year old drama is weird. good song, though."

this is the pinnacle of emo. fall out boy could never top this (well, they have in the rate, but otherwise? nope.). the iconic-ness of this emo bop stands the test of time: what other emo song gets people to still dance in the clubs or at parties? it's so stunningly teenager-like, and defines a generation of kids who felt like they were outcasts. fall out boy harnessed those emotions, and put them into one of the best songs of the 2000's, period.

---

people, naturally, called out patrick's slurred speech: **spacebabe27**: "Took off like .5 because i have known this song for years and still only know like 60% of the words". **omgcow**: "Despite half the chorus being intelligible, I love this song.". **kirby31200**: "I swear I've misheard the lyrics to this song more than any other. The guitar and lyrics are truly iconic.". **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "I KNOW YOU GOT CORNFLAKES COCK IT AND PULL IT"; while others weren't big fans: **estreindre**: "honestly, i reaaally wish i had more to say about this song since it's the most famous from the album but... i just think it's good. not great, just... good. i don't have a whole lot to add other than that." **camerinian**: "I’m not wild about this song like so many people are but it’s gonna do well so I’ll shut up". **danmacs109**: "4 songs in and his voice is starting to get annoying. this was way too whiny even for an MCR fan.".

for the fans: **eribertknows**: "I think this is my favorite song in the album and I still like it less than any of the songs in American Beauty/American Psycho. So when people say they miss the old FOB, do they mean the angry, less talented, all-of-our-songs-are-actually-the-same-song FOB?". **poppinmmolly**: "I still hear this on rotation on my local radio stations. It's timeless.". **calltehshots**: "You haven't lived until you've screamed this song at the top of your lungs with your friends drunk off your ass at 4AM. An iconic bop.". **ImADudeDuh**: "A perfectly aged classic 👌"

this song introduced the world to hayley williams. for many many girls, this was their anthem, calling out that bitch that's stealing your boyfriend. it's full of anger and overall, is insanely catchy and easy to sing along to. it's a revenge fantasy that just goes hard, the only issue being the slut-shaming lyrics. it's probably the only reason why this didn't take number one.

---

people love this song! **kirby31200**: "Perfect. Catty, bitchy, unforgiving. The solo rocks.". **VioletChutzkee**: "I wasn't a fan of this song back when it was first released, but I enjoy it a lot more now. I'm not sure if I like the talk-singing in the verses, but the chorus just EXPLODES with energy and it's extremely satisfying.". **Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Iconic. Hayley Williams sounds like Kelly Clarkson here. And I'm living.". **Verdantshade**: "Taylor wishes Better than Revenge was half as good as this song tbh.". **spacebabe27**: "I C O N I C also my mom likes this song so it needs to do well". **letsallpoo**: "problematic BOP". **MaySecretlyBeALlama**: "Easy 10.

of the dissenters, **estreindre** was the only zero, and they justify it: "okay, have to be honest: i HATE how this song is paramore's most popular. i mean, is the melody really catchy? yeah! but god, i just... even though this song is objectively probably like an 8 or 9 for me, i cannot justify giving this song a good score with how gross i think the slut-shaming lyrics are. i know hayley was like seventeen when she wrote this, and i'm glad she's changed her views now, but the song is still so gross with how it's talking about how horrible a girl is for... having sex with a guy she was dating whom hayley had a crush on? but she doesn't get mad at the guy at ALL for having sex with her, because he was just seduced by her ~evil, wily ways~ and men can't help themselves, it's the GIRL who was the evil seductress. and seriously, "once you're a whore you're nothing more" is such a disgusting lyric that i legitimately can't believe this song doesn't get more shit for it. i hate to have to bring up social justice kinda stuff in a rate thread that's supposed to be fun but... i'm pretty sure this song is going to be #1 for paramore (and probably in the top 3 overall) and i just really, really don't want that to happen because i think there's much better and much less Problematictm songs on the album. anyways, that's my very long-winded explanation for why i'm giving misery business a 0/10". **camerinian** also agrees: "Can I level with you guys? I never really liked this song. I always thought this song was way too bitchy for its own good, like Hayley does not come off well here, it could have scored lower too if it weren’t for that killer guitar riff.", as does **mother_rucker**: "I really liked this song when I was in middle school. But listening back to it now, the lyrics are not cute. I have a serious problem with calling other women “whores.” And I also have a problem with hating on other women because they dated a guy you liked, especially since she’s clearly not mad at the guy. It’s so petty, and not in a fun way. The whole second verse where Hayley trashes the girl is just super problematic."

deleted: I'm reading yours, and while I agree, I'm wondering if the whore line is a bit tongue in cheek at the same time being rude. 

In society, it is kinda true that if you're deemed a slut or a whore, you're forever tagged that way. Look at Taylor, to many, she will just be the girl who dates tons of guys so she can write songs and make money off them. 

Sure, it probably isn't a positive line, but in the line itself, you can't help but understand the truth in it. (Not trying to defend the line, just acknowledging that what she is singing about is generally true in life).

deleted: if the lyric was in any other context, i'd agree! however, everything else about the song is all slamming on this girl for having sex with hayley's crush and hayley's since admitted that lyric was awful, so i don't think she was meaning it in a societal way. plus, even though a lot of people think that way, it doesn't make it any less awful-- we should be working on changing people's point of view on that, not supporting it just becaus "it's the norm." i get what you mean though! :\^) i just strongly disagree, haha

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Ch7ISl3G0)**

the most iconic bassline of this whole rate? definitely. the best breakdown of this whole rate? certainly. the biggest #bop of this whole rate? without a doubt. how do i explain how good this song is? every element comes together, patrick's vocals, pete's bassline, andy's powerful drum beats. you can't talk about emo music, or even rock music in general, in the 2000's without mentioning this song. its truly, thoroughly, and beautifully #iconic

---

**mother_rucker** tells the truth: "Patrick Stump once tweeted that “Dance, Dance” is the best thing he’s ever done, and I agree.". **kirby31200** elaborates: "Perfect. The quintessential FUTCT track. Every instrument shines and Patrick Stump's vocals are spectacular. Each part is the best. The lyrics are as punk-pop as they can get. The music video captures the song perfectly.". **estreindre**: "this song has SUCH a killer energy to it! i love the verses where patrick is talking-singing (even if verse 2 is wayyy too short), and the chorus is such a great, powerful counterpoint to the tame verses. the outro to this is great too! the lyrics are fucking dumb but that's a running theme for this album so w.e.". **camerinian**: "This gets a high score just for that prechorus, never fails to get everyone so hype, what a massive tune". **omgcow**: "Iconic, I listen to this all the time tbh it’s a staple in my early 2000s pop playlists". **superr_rad**: "IM DACING CRAZY". **skiddos**: "a BOP when will the other emo bands" when will paramore ever

the bass is, obviously, a talking point: **VioletChutzkee**: "dat bassline". **poppinmmolly**: "The bass line could wake me from a coma.". **Verdantshade** throws some, well, shade: "The bass in this song is the best thing that came out of Pete Wentz (tbf that's not much)" damn ma

this is the song that introduced the world to panic! at the disco. this song takes their sound and cranks it up to 11: complete with theatrics, crazy instrumentals, and brendon urie's amazing vocals on the bridge. this song is still thoroughly iconic even today - when your song reaches meme status, you know that you've made it in pop culture. every element comes together to give a truly cohesive portrait of the band that continues to have influence over the younger generation, even over a decade later, in 2017.  haven't you people ever heard of closing the god damn door? 

---

people remember this song well. "iconic" was the word of choice: **kirby31200**: "What is there to say but I C O N I C. An anthem for 'teens whose parents keep leaving the door open' everywhere.". **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "is there anyone alive that doesn't get turnt the fuck up to this". **superr_rad**: "Iconic, truly, certainly, honestly." **123choji**: "classic P!ATD still sounds great after a long time".  **sweetnsoursauce1**: "GOAT song that propelled me into emo-dem". **Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Iconic song. Top pop-punk song of all time." **skiddos**: "Amazing, timeless song". **MrSwearword**: "Their GOAT & I am not hearing otherwise." **Awhile2**: "this song is so great on its own and in the context of the album its even better. It has one of those chorusses that you just cant help but sing as loudly as possible to".

the weirdest thing? not everyone loved this song, which is *crazy* for making it top 2. **Verdantshade**: "At this point the phrase "goddamn door" triggers me". **spacebabe27**: "Truly not the best from this album but obviously i c o n i c and a really good song". **camerinian**: "How does one even rate a meme". **calltehshots**: "A liiiiiiitttle overrated but it still holds up". **estreindre**: "okay, first off: between this and misery business, what tf was the deal with super popular punk-pop songs calling people whores back in the 2000's?? but anyways, even though this song is undoubtedly gonna be in the top 5, i've never gotten why it's so popular. the chorus is lame, the song is super repetitive, and even though the first verses is pretty good i feel like the second verse has too much going on in it. tbh i'm probably giving it a lower score than it deserves because of how absolutely sick i am of this song by this point, but still, i'm giving it a 5/10". **Raykel:** "I love the instrumentals during the verses but that's it, I don't know why this song became so big." **VioletChutzkee**: "So iconic in its catchiness and theatricality. This used to be my absolute favorite song from the emo/scene era, but listening to it now, I realize how repetitive it is and that bothers me."

**imnoteventhatfunny** puts it simply when they say: "it's just a classic in every way. you can't talk about emo music without mentioning this song"

this song ignited the emo fire in the hearts of teenagers across america. right from that sweet, sweet G note, we are treated to a magnum opus of grandiose proportions. gerard sings sweetly, then screams, then follows it with the most memorable breakdown of the 2000's. nobody can resist not singing this song, or immediately thinking back to middle school when you hear that opening note. it inspired people to reach for that tube of eyeliner, their nearest pair of black skinny jeans, and possibly a guitar. it defined a generation, and no other song in this rate has accomplished that. well done, my chemical romance. you deserve it.

---

**those that loved it**: 

- **estreindre**: you know, there's no doubt in my mind that this song is going to win. before i listened to this album i was thinking to myself "i'm gonna try to give welcome to the black parade a low-ish score"-- not anything outrageously low, but like a 7 or an 8, just to give some other songs a fighting chance and because i've never loved this song as much as other people do. but after listening to this song in the context of the entire album... god, i just can't. there is no way i can give this song anything other than the ten it deserves. the intro is absolutely beautiful and probably my favorite part of the entire album. the black parade representing the journey from life into death is absolutely fantastic imagery, and i really love some of the lyrics here (ie: everthing his dad says and "so paint it black and take it back / let's shout it loud and clear / defiant to the end we hear the call"), and it's all topped off with that great outro with the marching band drums. this all forms together to make an incredible powerful and surprisingly optimistic song about the patient imagining death coming for him, and like i said for dead!, it says something about how absolutely fantastic this album is when this masterpiece of a song isn't my favorite song from it.
- **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: I wish I could be a contrarian but holy shit this song is incredible and it holds up after a decade, it’s pretty much an emo rock epic in like 18 parts and all of them are great, the hook is great, the instruments are great, the subject matter is honestly really touching and gives some real humanity to the album. It feels real and I know it’s just a song but it really brings me back to a different, kinda cringey time of my life where this album was my favorite.
- **Verdantshade**: It's a really good song despite how often I've heard it
- **Poppinmmolly**: Iconic. A fabulous song.
- **spacebabe27**: I couldn’t even sum up how amazingly crafted this entire song is in a reasonable amount of words so i’m just gonna say GOAT
- **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: suddenly eyeliner I didn't even put on is streaming down my face and smudging my tears how did this get here I don't know
- **superr_rad**: FUCKING QUEENS. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE EMO SONG EVER TO BE EVER. TO THE DRUMS, THE CHANTS, THE CHORUS, IM CRYING MCR WHY’D YOU HAVE TO BREAK UP
- **sweetnsoursauce1**: ICONIC
- **misguidedzombie**: Most iconic G note of all time and the Official Emo Anthem
- **danmacs109**: my third favorite key change ever. i still feel chills every time I listen to this. this is the best song on this rate and this better be at LEAST top 2.
- **skiddos**: Solid and iconic song - I nut when the song transitions

**those that hated it**:

- **Awhile2**: If i were to make a list of my 10 least favorite songs of all time, this would be on it. Like i wish i could give this song a negative score. its funny that for a sub that likes to hate on TOP so much (not that theres anything wrong with hating on TOP) this song is guaranteed to be at least a top 10, possibly even a top 5 spot on this rate because im 100% certain this song mustve inspired the TOP boys to try and make the most messiest combination of corny production tropes and faux deep lyricism ever, yet even TOP have not been able to top this yet
- **bluehxrizon**: i feel like i should explain myself for this: i have terrible memories associated with this song and now that opening piano is one of my most hated melodies
- **MrSwearword**: AS A LANA FAN I ASK HOW THE FUCK THIS IS 5 MINUTES LONG.
- **ProphecyPizza**: I didn’t like the opening

**all the comments about bohemian rhapsody**: 

- **Raykel**: An emo's Bohemian Rhapsody.
- **raicicle**: The guitars are very Queen in the first section of the song. It feels incredibly classic. It’s not hard to see why it’s considered such an iconic song.
- **camerinian**: The modern day Bohemian Rhapsody. I don’t know if anything more needs to be said.
- **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: I would go as far calling this song "The Modern Bohemian Rhapsody" due to its theatrical element but I would be lynch by /r/music I guess.
- **ImADudeDuh**: An astounding track. This sounds like what would happen if Bohemian Rhapsody was an emo song

mother_rucker: Everyone called you out on your 0 but nobody said anything about my 2 lmao (although I should have given it a 1).

But yeah, people were justifying it and it was weird. I expected it to get a high placement, but I didn't expect people to get upset at the completely valid criticism about the lyrics.

VioletChutzkee: I think your and estreindre's criticisms were totally valid and I actually docked half a point from my own rating of the song because I think the message that it sends isn't a nice one. I think it's important to consider context, though. First, Hayley was 17 at the time and no shade but most of us are pretty stupid at that age. Second, I feel like during peak emo/scene era the words "slut" and "whore" were thrown around really loosely as insults, which is completely awful, but it's just a sign of the times even though it's absolutely jarring to hear today. What I do love about the song and what I think lends it a sort of timelessness is how honest and raw it feels. Her emotions are super petty and she's definitely in the wrong for trashing this girl so much, but emotions are just ugly and messy and irrational sometimes. Plus, the fact that she KNOWS that she's not responding in the most appropriate way but can't help but feel happy anyway (*I never meant to brag...it was never my intention to brag...but God it just feels so good*) is really compelling to me. And she's right - schadenfreude can be delicious sometimes! I can't think of any pop songs that gets that feeling across as powerfully as Misery Business. Problematic though it is, that song just makes you FEEL, which I think is the mark of a fantastic song and if I would've thought this out sooner I probably would've given it my 11 oops

mother_rucker: I don't blame Hayley for writing the song, because I also had shitty opinions towards other women when I was 17. I just feel supremely uncomfortable with the message it sends, especially knowing that when I was younger it confirmed for me that "whore" is an okay word to say to describe another woman. But I agree that it's a powerful and fun song musically.

VioletChutzkee: Yeah I was unfortunately like that too. I personally didn't think too much of the song when I was younger, which might be part of why I have an easier time letting it off the hook, but your experience is a good example of how lyrics that send antagonistic messages about women can and do have a negative influence.
