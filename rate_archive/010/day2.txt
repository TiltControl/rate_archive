ffourthofjuly: some random facts: 

- paramore had the highest album average with 7.580. panic's was the lowest with 6.845.

- the song with the highest controversy score will go out today

Really?! I feel like Paramore had the least memorable album out of all of them.

VioletChutzkee: I'm a little surprised but not too much. Both RIOT! and The Black Parade are consistently solid, but the former is a bit more accessible. I imagine that a fair amount of people are turned off by MCR's overeager theater kid style haha. I'm mostly okay with it, but at any given moment I'm more likely to want to listen to Paramore, they're just good, fun, straightforward pop-punk!

i just had to listen to this song again because i didn't recall any of it. that should say something. it sounds generic - the fault of a number of songs in this rate - and isn't anything exceptional, both vocally and instrumentally. there really isn't much i can say about this song

---

most people just called it generic, generally. **skiddos** and **123choji** make some puns: the former said "I was waiting for a miracle that this song would be interesting", and the latter agrees: "it's a miracle this was even a song". others like **estreindre** also call out the bland-ness: "another good, but generic song. wish i had more to say about these songs negl". **sweetandsoursauce1** says the same but with more tea: "good song but I feel like it’s a downgrade from the first 6 lol"

some enjoyed it: **Verdantshade**: "Most underrated Paramore song ever (apart from One of Those Crazy Girls). I really wanted to give this my 11 because it's such a hopeful song (like Looking Up) and one of their strongest lyrically on the album "it's not faith if you're using your eyes" is just so TRUE". **MrSwearword**: "Pretty solid song.". **camerinian**: "THIS IS THE FIRE I WAS HOPING I WOULD DISCOVER IN THIS RATE WOW WHAT A TUNE"

honestly, truly, this is one of my favorite mcr songs. i don't remember the first time i heard this song, but i wish i could, because holy shit. this song is definitely the most inventive and avant garde song on the black parade, covering many different facets, like noise pop and cabaret, all grounded by an insanely catchy and bouncy guitar riff. it's definitely the *weirdest*: deep and nasal background vocals on the second verse, a feature by liza minelli of all people, a whiny bridge where gerard is just screaming "MAMA", an apocalyptic sing-along ending: everything coming together in a truly messy performance piece. 

---

this was probably the most divided song of the rate, in terms of public opinion. on the good side of things: **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This song is completely insane and I don’t 100% get it but its kind of a beautiful mess??? It kinda reminds me of Pink Floyd’s The Wall tbh". **calltehshots**: "One of my favorite songs off this album. The "You should've been-I COULD'VE BEEN A BETTER SON" and the Liza cameo. A masterpiece.". **VioletChutzkee**: "This song tells a really compelling story and I absolutely love how it sounds like something that could be out of a Tim Burton film. Also: L I Z A M I N N E L L I". **superr_rad**: "I love the way he says mama…say it again daddy gerry :tongue: also that beat switch im shook." and the most confusing way of describing this song, **ImADudeDuh**: "This is fucking terrifying, in a good way".

others blasted it. **camerinian**: "13-year old me would hate current me for saying this, but …  Panic At The Disco do the whole vaudeville thing better". **omgcow**: "This song feels super disjointed and it’s tiring to listen to". **MaySecretlyBeALlama**: "literally the only song I don't like on this record". and i assume this is not a compliment from **sweetnsoursauce1**: "wow doesn’t this speak to my angsty 14-year-old self"

*shadiest comment of day 2 comes from* **spacebabe27**: "More extra than Demi Lovato but i’m here for it"

this song definitely falls victim to the "middle of the album curse". it's amazing that the two lowest scores were *one* three and *one* five, and yet it's still so low. i really like the intro of this song, the verses and chorus however aren't too memorable. i think the reason why this got so high is that some people loved it, but those who didn't did not necessarily *hate* it. it falls victim to not being able to elicit an opinion. feel free to explain why you love it though lol

---

**COMMENTS ABOUT THE SONG TITLE**:

- **imnoteventhatfunny**: "one of the best song titles ever"
- **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "sorry FOB Marina is the established queen of champagne puns"
- **ImADudeDuh**: "I like calling this song "Shampoo for My Real Friends, Real Poo for My Sham Friends""
- **camerinian**: "God I really want to give this song points for that smart-ass title, but there’s like nothing here"
- **Nerdy_boy_chris**: "What are these song titles, jfc."
- **MaySecretlyBeALlama**: "ok I admit this title is pretty good"
- **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Title makes me wanna listen to Kanye but this was better then the few songs before it"

okay, aside from that. literally every comment mentioned the title, and talked about how bland it was. **eribertknows** has deja vu: "One of the worst titles of a song I’ve ever seen, also I could have sworn I already listened to this a few minutes ago. Still not a terrible song though." and **Reifiui** explains their frustration: "Why is this album so 7 worthy please stop this fall out boy I want to give different scores". **123choji** laments as well: "they all sound the saaame "

ffourthofjuly: #32: Panic! at the Disco - Build God, Then We'll Talk

---
Average: **7.052**
Controversy score: **2.219**

---
**Highest scores:** 10 (x6): ffourthofjuly, Verdantshade, spacebabe27, calltehshots, alternativeoxygen, kirby31200. 9.5 (x1): mother_rucker. 

**Lowest scores:** 0 (x1): berober04. 2 (x2): imnoteventhatfunny, mirandacrocsgrove.

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwTphY_QMUo)**

---

my earliest panic! at the disco memories include singing this with my best friend at the time in the back of the car, dueting with one another on each lines. the song effectively tells a story of a hotel and those patrons. the song closes out the album, encapsulating the different styles throughout the album, from electronic sounds to intense pop punk, to cabaret and baroque influences, ending with an interpolation of "my favorite things" and a cello solo. it's definitely strange.

**calltehshots** sums it up: "This should be cheesy garbage but it's SO good??? The circus-y melodies against all the crazy shit lyrically happening in the song and then the cello part? My wig just got arrested for illegally flying". 

others mostly commented on how strange the song was overall. some mentioned the cello (**mother_rucker**: "I used to play the cello, so I get really psyched whenever a cello is featured in a song."), others mentioned the vocal stylings (**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The thing they do where they tell a pointless story in a sing songy flow on the verses really gets on my nerves for some reason"), and the general vibe of the track: **Nerdy_boy_chris** mentions the album's concept: "I like the twisted circus vibe, but it's not a great album closer." and **camerinian** focuses on the theatrics of it all: "I really like how this song sounds straight out of a Broadway musical in its structure, I just wish they didn’t blast the loud/soft dynamic so very much."

**COMMENTS ABOUT THE MUSIC VIDEO**:

- **superr_rad**: I never wanted to fuck a mime before that video
- **ImADudeDuh**: The video added a point, ngl
- **Verdantshade**: The music video scarred my soul.........
- **estreindre**: negl, everytime i try to think of something to say about this song, all i can think of is porno mime. the song is pretty solid though, and one of my favorites on the album lyrically! i'm not sure how i feel about it as a closer to the album though? i don't know, it feels like a weird choice to have an intro and intermission on the album, but not an ending track (or at least having the last track be something like camisado, which would feel more fitting)

ffourthofjuly: #31: Panic! at the Disco - Time To Dance

---
**Highest scores:** 10 (x5): ffourthofjuly, Verdantshade, spacebabe27, MaySecretlyBeALlama, kirby31200

**Lowest scores:** 2 (x1): imnoteventhatfunny. 4 (x2): timothy444, mirandacrocsgrove.

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlrAcJ4LFns)**

---

fun fact: this song is basically all of "invisible monsters" the novel by chuck palahniuk. nerds. aside from that, this is definitely the most electronic track on the album, propelled by a synth delivering notes throughout the whole track. the song has a sense of urgency to it, with brendon urie delivering his vocals with force, all with a chorus that makes you scream "WEDDING" when brendon yells "SHOTGUN".

---

those that loved it, absolutely *loved* it. **kirby31200**: "I was originally set on making this my 11. It was narrowly beaten by Dance, Dance because it's a bit more relatable and accessible for the GP, while this is about a book with no mainstream screen adaptations so it's hard to understand without reading/researching the book. Understandable or not, it's ridiculously catchy and quite quotable. Every line in this song is ICONIC. Brendon Urie is just fabulous.". people called attention to the call and response part of the song, with **skiddos** loving it: "SHOTGUN WEDDING SHOTGUN WEDDING", as well as the intro: **MaySecretlyBeALlama**: "that intro alone does it for me; if I didn't give my 11 to TODBMASIPC then it would be to this song". the only bad comment? **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Ehhhhh"

two exceptionally funny comments:

- **raicicle**: Seriously, there are a lot of songs on this album that use those 00s dance synths that wouldn’t sound of place in a German gay club. It does make for great fun.
- **superr_rad**: So funny story about this song, when I (((illegally))) downloaded this song from 4shared, it was actually some sort of Bollywood-esque music track, and I didn’t notice it wasn’t the actual song for like a solid year. Wish I could find the song but it was years ago lol it wasn’t bad.

ffourthofjuly: #30: My Chemical Romance - The End

---
Average: **7.090**
Controversy score: **1.635**

---
**Highest scores:** 10 (x2): spacebabe27, strawberryswing1. 9.3 (x1): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy. 9 (x4): imnoteventhatfunny, calltehshots, Reifiui, alternative oxygen.

**Lowest scores:** 1 (x1): Awhile2. 4 (x2): berober04, omgcow

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IKboP7JhA0)**

---

this is the song that introduced people to my chemical romance. it introduces the concepts of the album effectively, welcoming us all to the tale of the Patient, leading in with "come one, come all to this tragic affair". and it truly is: a theatric production of an album only deserves to lead off with a truly theatric song. it acts as some sort of prologue, and a catchy one at that. 

---

the consensus was: decent to strong opener. a lot of people mentioned that. **spacebabe27**: "Opens this album so perfectly and displays Gerard’s vocal abilities in a very organic manner. Also makes my gay ass sad.". **raicicle**: "Strong Queen influences. Super melodramatic, works as a great album opener.". **kirby31200**: "This song serves as a good intro, but with some adjustments could have possibly been a better outro. Gerard Way's delivery is excellent and the lyrics are the right amount of defiant and bitter and weird."

others started being brought back to their teenage years, like **superr_rad:** "Omg I’m literally screaming this brings me tf back, this will be sooooo good", and **123choji**: "damn memories". the main complaint was that it was boring, and **mother_rucker** blasted it for being too blatant: "I know that this is a concept album about cancer, but naming the first song on the album "The End" seems really uninventive to me. It's like an attempt at being creative but it's too obvious."

one of fall out boy's catchiest. this is one of their more hook-oriented songs, with the "oh"'s never seeming to leave your head. this is one of my favorite fall out boy songs, as it sounds so innocent and pure. being the second track on the album, it definitely shows the sounds present through the rest of the record.

---

resident fall out boy stan **calltehshots** explains her sole 11: "Okay I know there are better songs technically on here that I could give my 11 to but this song...omg. I can imagine being 50 and listening to this and immediately being brought back to feeling like I was 14. My life is replaying back to me like a coming of age film rn and I'm shook. The memories I have with this song outranks anything any band could do in this rate. Lowkey one of my favorite songs of all time and I'm fully expecting it to flop in this rate :(" hey, it made it to day 2!

on the other side of the spectrum: **estreindre**: "this represents the biggest problem in the album, imo: it has a lot of GREAT tracks on it, but all of the other tracks are just... okay. not ever bad, just a little above mediocre. i don't really have anything to say about this song, it just sounds like a boring, generic pop-punk song." **sweetnsoursauce1** agrees: "not bad but forgettable". from a producer's standpoint, **camerinian** responds: "Is it weird to criticise the guitars for being too loud? Like that’s a consistent thing across all of these, but I noticed how much they drowned out the rest of the mix on this one".

if i could pick a paramore song that best exemplified pop punk, this would be it. this is the most stereotypical paramore song, it's their sound in a nutshell. the guitars are strong, as is hayley's voice. the downtempo tone contrasts with the instrumental, and delivers a powerful and pushing chorus, with her hitting amazing notes in the chorus.

---

**MrSwearword** calls out the lyrics: "“If only time flew like a dove”. Should be deep but it’s not.". on the other end of the spectrum is **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: ""Will God make it fly faster than i'm falling in love?" Amazing lyric". people also obviously compared it to the superior cohen version: **superr_rad**: "Leonard Cohen could never". **THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "I prefer the Shrek version myself, but this is chill."

the consensus was boring, though. **eribertknows**: "Her voice is nice, but I am going to have a hard time getting through this without hating myself even more than I already do.". **skiddos**: "Boring. I'm Bored". **kirby31200**: "It's alright, the chorus is solid but the rest is just okay.". **calltehshots**: "Corny as all hell"

i am absolutely baffled as to why this song is so high? i'm sure something about the catchiness is enticing, but generally it sounds like people just became bored, and got a high score due to the number of 7s this received. it's nice, but ? 

---

on the good side: **calltehshots**: "A religious experience tbh", **skiddos**: "This is very good - a great way of closing the album", **raicicle**: "Is it a coincidence that one of the shortest song titles is one of the better written songs? Truly lessons to be learnt here.", **Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A wonderful album closer" and **estreindre**: "really good song!! i LOVE how high-energy it is. the part near the end where it slows down a bit is kinda lame, but otherwise a really solid song!" all support it, contrary to those who called it mediocre, like **Verdantshade**: "It's that song on the album that's nice but forgettable, like you don't remember what the song is like unless you're listening to it I guess"

**BEYONCE COMMENTS**:

- **ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: Beyonce cover was better!!!1 Kind of a weaker version of Dance Dance

definitely one of the darker songs on this album. if i were to describe to someone the "emo" genre, i would show them this. it's very heavy and violent-sounding, with lyrics that hit you, all the while still sounding grandiose and theatric. 

---

people thought it was okay. **MrSwearword**: "It did feel a little dragged out by the 3-minute mark.". **skiddos**: "Nothing really special about this song, the production tends to drown out the vocals on these songs". **ImADudeDuh:** "Something just sounds off with this". **superr_rad**: "This one’s a little less exciting compared to the openers, but my pussy is still popping". **123choji**: "i don't get this song". the only dissenter was **Awhile2**, resident mcr hater, saying: "this is the only good song on the album". **Verdantshade** can agree: "I love how the guitar parts are so heavy but the verses contrast it so much and "can you hear me crying out to you" right before the breakdown and imo its one of the most emotional songs on the album. also as usual its not a complete MCR song without Gerard screaming fuck at one point"

**spacebabe27**: "Once a hot guy i knew in middle school really liked this song so I bought it on iTunes so i could have it on my iPod nano so he would maybe have a reason to want to talk to me, but unfortunately it didn’t work. I did end up really liking this song though and it became one of my favorites and he got my friend pregnant, so who is the true winner of this situation" wowza

this song sounds very...polished. it's probably the most pop-ish non-single in the rate, and sounds straight from a YA soundtrack (thanks for this mrswearword). it's very very different from everything else on the album, and definitely gave many 13-year-olds misty eyes after breaking up with their first boyfriend.

---

people agreed that it was bland. **ImADudeDuh**: "Kinda boring tbh". **123choji**: "ehh don't feel it". **kirby31200**: "A forgettable, but sweet song, Hayley William's vocals save the song from being a 5". **camerinian**: "Eh, they’re better on more uptempo, fiery tracks. This doesn’t do a lot for me.". **mother_rucker**: "Probably the blandest song on this album". **Raykel**: "I like slow-tempo songs, but that doesn't mean I like boring songs."

people vouched for it though! **Verdantshade:** "Something about the guitar and vocal melodies is simply perfect and I don't know how to explain it. "And you'll sleep till May and you'll say that you don't want to see the sun anymore" is my favourite lyric on the album - it's so specific that it feels personal yet completely detached as it's about shutting yourself out. It's the perfect non-acoustic rainy day song" and **estreindre** both explained their reasoning: "that fucking opening of the song with just the single guitar string being plucked is SO GOOD and probably my favorite single moment off this album. hayley's voice also sounds a lot better here than it did on hallelujah, the only other slower song on the album so far. the song has a great tune to it, due to how mellow and stripped back they are compared to the rest of the album (esp. misery business)."

this pained me to write. guitarist ryan ross wrote the song about his father, and because of that it's deeply personal. it's also deeply personal that it's going out before day three! when i first started this, i thought it would make top 10. i was wrong. it's the perfect panic! song, the instrumentals create a very specific atmosphere that couples with the lyrics to create a definite electronic sound, and possibly the best panic song.

---

**calltehshots** agrees with me: "Panic's masterpiece. Possibly the best song they've ever made. The dark story of Ryan's alcoholic father and what he had to deal with growing up put against this poppy, upbeat melody shouldn't work so well but it's borderline perfect. I was shook when I first heard this and I'm still shook now.". the lyrics were also mentioned: **estreindre**: "probably my favorite album on the song lyrically! there's some really great lines in here, like "just sit back and relax / just sit back and relapse." it's really catchy too, and i dig the instrumentation on this song. my main problem with it is just that it has the same problem a lot of p!atd songs suffer from where it starts getting kinda repetitive near the end, because of how much their songs repeat verses and choruses. still a solid song though!!". 

**kirby31200** considers both perspectives: "On one level, this song can be considered a less catchy version of the previous song, but the lyrics and electronic techno beats help differentiate it and make it uniquely and weirdly its own. It's extremely hard to resist the urge to sing along with the "Bum bum ba-dum". The bridge is particularly scathing, and makes the listener more empathetic to the narrator and want to see the subject suffer." urie's voice is a highlight, as noted by **superr_rad**: "THAT’S HOW YOU FALSETTO, ZAYN. I love the bubbly synth sounds, this is so good." and **MrSwearword**: "Really good showcase of Urie’s vocals."

Weird. I was thrown off by this song when I was listening to the rating, because it was so much worse than all the other songs -- I find the chorus and the "just sit back just sit back!!!" so annoying. I don't know if it's the pitch of his tone or what. I actually felt bad at first for giving it a 5.5 and considered raising my score, but I realized that would mean I ranked it higher than introduction, so I didn't.

i don't like paramore. i can assume that's obvious by now, but this is one of the songs i actually enjoy of theirs! it's probably their most pop-punk sounding tune, as it shows all the signs of a good emo song: a call and response, pounding drums, energy, and punchy guitar riffs. this song has all of that, and then some.

---

**estreindre** digs it a lot: "a super strong to the end!! (i'm pretending acoustic business doesn't exist.) the parts in the chorus where a crowd chants the lyrics sounds SOOOO good, and so does the pre-chorus and basically hayley in general. even though a lot of this song sounds generic (the chorus especially), it has enough really cool, unique moments in it that i'm able to forgive the genericness a lot more than i normally would.". as does **kirby31200**: "This song has the energy, anger, and pride that makes it the perfect Paramore fan call to arms.". **calltehshots** puts things a little less eloquently: "Best song on the album don't @ me im 2 busy headbanging \m/"

**eribertknows** was truly 100% savage: "I just think it’s funny how the name of the song is Born For This and yet I wanted to die while listening to it."

the first time i heard this song i cried. yes i was twelve but still, this song showcases some of mcr, and especially gerard way's, more emotional side. the screaming on this song is truly heartfelt, and is reminiscent of someone who just realized their life is changed. gerard's voice feels pain and depth and true emotion, something that many emo songs lack. no shade no tea but this is also the best slow song in the entire rate.

---

the opinions varied in the comments. people adored it: **Verdantshade**: "This is THE song that got me into MCR. I was too young for Three Cheers but holy shit is this brilliant and the guitar solo makes me cry every time". **poppinmmolly**: "The only reason this doesn't get an 11 is because I'm only allowed one.". **calltehshots**: "I think Gerard's vocal performance here is something special. It makes a pretty simple song something really interesting."

but on the same level, people also really disliked it. **superr_rad**: "Wow the beginning of this sounds like Yellow by Coldplay don’t @ me. Also uhhhhhhh if they released that video today, it would not go over well.". **danmacs109**: "as much as I love MCR, i think this song is very mediocre. its boring and drags a bit. I like the lyrics, though.". **Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Sounds so miserable. Like Love Yourself but not good.". **raicicle**: "I think this album is ultimately better when it’s being loud and fast, rather than in its more tender moments.". **MaySecretlyBeALlama** explains their rating process: "basically fuck all the slow songs is what my ratings come out to".

**estreindre** delivers #analysis: "this is the first album where i'm not huge on the actual song itself, when it comes to the melody and everything. however, it gains a LOT of points in my book because of some incredible lyrics. him telling his lover to leave (reluctantly, as shown from the "better get out while you can" lyric) but also begging her to admit to him that she doesn't love him anymore is just... an incredibly depressing thought and concept that hits oddly close to him to me (even though i've never been in a situation like this??) i was originally gonna give this song only a 7.5, but uh. i legit had tears come to my eyes when i was writing this description of the song, so the song is definitely doing something right."

deleted: WHY DO I KEEP SAYING "ALBUM" INSTEAD OF "SONG" FML my analysis on this is still great though. give me five stars on my music critique blog, thanks

(also, i want to say that i'm sad this song is out-- and i am-- but tbh putting my MCR bias aside, it's probably about time for it to go. still wish it at least made top 20 though)

ffourthofjuly: #21: My Chemical Romance - House of Wolves

---
Average: **7.287**
Controversy score: **1.721**

---
**Highest scores:** 10 (x1): yatcho. 9.5 (x2): estreindre, camerinian. 9 (x4): Verdantshade, strawberryswing1, imnoteventhatfunny, Reifiui, nijomemo, MaySecretlyBeALlama. 

**Lowest scores:** 3 (x2): eribertknows, ImADudeDuh. 4 (x1): THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD

**[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25EYLtqiyTo)**

this used to be my favorite my chemical romance song! looking back on it, it's.... interesting. one of the more intense songs of the rate, everything from the vocal techniques to the song structure is interesting and creative. this song also has the best bridge mcr has ever done, creating a frenzy of notes that give off the impression of chaos. this song is insanity through and through. it's what "this is how i disappear" wanted to be.

---

**estreindre** loved most of it: "the first like fifteen seconds of this song is fucking SIIIIICK, i really wish the rest of the song was more like that. even then, though, the verses and bridges are both fucking GREAT and i literally can't help but jiggle in my seat along to them. at first i really didn't like to the chorus to this song either, but while writing this chorus it suddenly CLICKED for me and now i'm SUPER into the chorus too! i will say though, even while i really dig the concept for this song (him deciding whether he's going to go to heaven or hell), something about the lyrics in this one don't really click for me. i feel kinda guilty for giving so much songs on this album such high scores because i try to be more conservative in my ratings but... GOD this album is so fucking good." retweet my guy

different elements about it were appreciated: **MrSwearword** liked how it was produced: "The production goes the fuck in and I approve.", **superr_rad** appreciated the drum line: "That kickdrum, I’m fucked up", and **kirby31200** appreciated the good ass guitar solo: "The beginning of the song is great and has promise, but the rest of the song isn't as good, with the exception of the solo towards the end."
