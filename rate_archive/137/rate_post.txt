Finally, it’s here, the [yassification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeXuco8kN8E) of popheads!

/u/static_int_husp and me would like to welcome you to the Trans Women of Experimental rate, getting a heads up from Arca releasing 3 albums in a single day (stream all the kicks tomorrow). We’re very excited to co-host and see you not only rate these amazing artists, but also discover some more in our bonus rate!

Trans women have been pioneering music for a long time, this is not something new, [this read](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/the-secret-history-of-women-in-electronic-music-is-just-beginning-to-be-told/) on the Sisters with Transistors documentary and the exploration of other groundbreaking trans women in music from pitchfork is a great read on some history about the trans women who not only inspired a lot of the artists we will be rating, but also changed the course of music. In this rate, we will be rating 4 amazing women that have pioneered and experimented in music in different ways throughout the last decade: Anohni, Arca, Quay Dash and SOPHIE.

For the regular rater besties, who want to get into it and enjoy the music, here are the important links, however, we encourage you to read our writeups on these albums, especially if you’re unfamiliar with them.

# ANOHNI - HOPELESSNESS

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6zrFK6ltxpZZ0HmMgfOwbw?si=A2qEgy4CQwaukch3l99yYw) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/hopelessness/1084753880) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMltA_kFY4p0ty-EsL682A1kCdSv_xFtp)

&nbsp;

>The rotten bodies threaded gold, the pitch of hair and sticky meat

>The sea life cut with plastic, a white cross gilded gold

>A case of white doves laying in the boiling snow

>A sharp knife of concrete, the blue line of tuna's throat

\- *Why did you separate me from the earth?*

&nbsp;

Anhoni first got her start in music in her band Antony and the Johnsons. She mostly made chamber pop and art pop, and contributed to works of high profile artists like Bjork and Lou Reed. In 2015, she came out publicly as a trans woman alongside the announcement of her debut solo album, Hopelessness.

&nbsp;

Hopelessness is the darkest and most political album in this rate. Co-produced by Hudson Mohawke and Oneohtrix Point Never, the experimental synths of this album are a far cry from the chamber pop Anohni made on her previous projects. The album itself is a collection of modern protest songs. Four Degrees is a fatalist, driving song about the destruction of climate change, Drone Bomb Me is a brutal song about a young girl who’s family has been killed by drone warfare and wishes to join them, and Obama is a lamentation on the titular president’s disappointing legacy. Juxtaposed with the dark lyrics are clean, loud synth instrumentals that would be at home on a more optimistic album. Yet these sounds don’t distract. Rather, they work to focus Anhoni’s lyricism, underscoring her every thoughtful word.

&nbsp;

The album garnered much acclaim. It was named in the top 10 albums of 2016 by multiple outlets, including Pitchfork and The New York Times, and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Drone Bomb Me was also named the #77 best song by a female artist in the 21st century.

# Arca - KiCk i

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6fumIfDEAppI5NCGHQEBSr?si=eBbg9dNGSdOy57hU2kqLGw) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/kick-i/1511122250) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJDoxNQDbPu1jSj8UgV6ipwV4Gx7XGy06)

&nbsp;

>Cast the first stone

>If you wanna be a puppet

>Better yet—

>Speak for your self-states

\- *Nonbinary*

&nbsp;

Arca’s trajectory in music can be traced back to her Nuuro era aroud 2007-8, and as Arca herself since 2012 with the Baron Libre EP; after this she has achieved a lot of success not only as a sólo artist, earning a Grammy nomination, but also as a producer, producing for names like Björk and Kanye West among others. 
  
&nbsp;

KiCk i is Arca’s fourth studio album and the one that started off the KiCk craze we’ve been seeing these days with the release of KiCk ii and KiCk iii. She released the album mid 2020 and seeing such a departure from her previous work was extremely exciting, the album has such a high energy at moments like Mequetrefe, Riquiquí and KLK which have a lot of influence in genres like reggaeton, some more deconstructed club moments with tracks like Watch and even ballads like Calor and No Queda Nada. Without a doubt Arca experimented here through genres, through her different inspirations in music, as we can see in Afterwards with Björk, and her venezuelan roots are very present throughout as we can see in Riquiquí and Machote, which is a cover of a famous song that probably the latinas here recognize: Quiero una Chica by Latín Dreams; the pronouns in the song are changed and her own twist in the song is very noticeable. KiCk i tackles on many things that Arca herself has gone through, like her gender identity on Nonbinary, Mequetrefe being inspired by that time these men were catcalling her and yelling things to her in the street and her relationship with her now ex, Carlos Saez. KiCk i groups a lot of her talents, showcases not only her rapping, singing but also her production and her amazing versatility with a wide range of collaborators.

# Quay Dash - TRANSPHOBIC

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7hURJEWypT0eFZyoNYrkzR?si=4a91de59d606418b) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/quay/pl.u-RRbV0XVFmqPeN6b) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMltA_kFY4p3p0ddfrspfnkjL-Sij7WQQ)

&nbsp;

>These hoes can’t compete cause I’m fly

>Mad as fuck everytime I walk by

>But they can’t fuck with the Q-U-A-Y

>D-A-S-H Queen of NY

\- *Queen of NY*

&nbsp;

Note: *All 3 streaming platforms are missing Shades On Top Down, it’s linked down below directly from her SoundCloud. The Apple Music link also does not include the two loose singles we will be rating along with the EP.* 

&nbsp;

Quay Dash, as the EP suggests is the Queen of NY, she grew up and has built her career as a rapper in New York, where she has faced a lot of challenges; not only being screwed over by her label which scammed some people and stole some money from Queen of This Shit being licensed for a reality TV show; she also had a GoFundMe open through a friend recently to secure housing for her after some threats, harassment and other conditions in her apartment which collected $75k and has since closed. All this has earned her a lot of support from a lot of us that hope she comes back to making music, especially after her collaboration in Dorian Electra’s F The World. 

&nbsp;

Transphobic EP was released in 2016, putting her into the scene as an artist to look out for, from the strong delivery of her lyrics and the lyrical content putting her experience as a black trans woman, showing her pride and empowerment with every bar and every beat; her dive into music, with the EP especifically also comes from her being uninspired by a lot of female rappers at the moment other than artists like Foxy Brown and Lil Kim, who she has looked up to for a while (and happens to be in the other December rate, 2000s Legendary Female MCs). Even in her interviews about the EP and her music in general, she’s mentioned this need to show something that is rarely shown in rap music and hip hop music and overtime she has proven she has what it takes to fill that void.

# SOPHIE - Oil Of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides

### [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/23lnmHhZwyercCJhmyPXYN?si=vTemqXp5RKi2gf4JHcqpKw) │ [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/oil-of-every-pearls-un-insides/1481727075) │ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJc9GisSQjehamAZiNDTv7g_8qKWoT9vY)

&nbsp;

>I can see the truth through all the lies

>And even after all this time

>Just know you've got nothing to hide

>It's okay to cry

\- *It's Okay To Cry*

&nbsp;

In 2017, Sophie was one of the most exciting up and coming artists in the pop sphere. A frequent collaborator of the PC music label, Sophie gained critical acclaim through collaborations with artists like Charli XCX, Vince Staples, and Madonna, and her debut album Product. In October 2017, Sophie released It’s Okay To Cry, the first single from Oil and the first song to use her voice and face. Alongside this release, she also came out in the press as a trans woman.

&nbsp;

Oil Of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides is an album that showcases all facets of Sophie’s unique style. From the plastic, sugary synthpop of Immaterial to the more abrasive, industrial sounds of Faceshopping, Sophie’s music feels purposely and deliberately constructed. This production and the lyrics of the album both speak to deep themes of gender transition and finding one’s true sense of self. It’s Okay To Cry speaks to the strong feelings of gender euphoria when one is able to finally see themselves as they are. Meanwhile, Is It Cold In The Water? And Pretending deal with the anxiety and fear that comes with these changes. Even the title of the album (which could be read as “I Love Every Person’s Insides”) is purposefully strange, yet unique and memorable. 

&nbsp;

The album was met with widespread critical acclaim. In 2018, Sophie became the first trans artist to be nominated for the Best Dance/Electronic Album Grammy, and the third trans woman to ever be nominated for a Grammy.

- **We'd encourage you to leave comments** of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, **they must be in this format**, simply leaving one space after your score:
>Afterwards: 7 The Hispanic Art Pop girlies have been really quiet since this dropped.

    Any other format such as:
    >Queen of This Shit: Love how she just replaced NY with this shit! Almost didn’t notice they had different titles (10)

    >Is It Cold in the Water?: 8: It is!!

    will get your ballot rejected.

- If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole they must be formatted like this, leaving colon then a space after the album title:
>Album: HOPELESSNESS: We love easy albums to get through with no heavy topics at all
