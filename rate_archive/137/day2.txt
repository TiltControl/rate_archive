**plastichaxan** (10): my god this is so powerful, every “how did i become a virus” just gets deep into my head and this song always sticks with me on every listen

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): I genuinely don’t know how to best describe how I feel about this song. This is accentuated by the incredibly weird music video. On the other hand I can definitely say this beat goes hard.

---

**kappyko** (10): TRUE!!!!!!!!!

**Leixander** (10): pov - you're corona beer in early 2020

**Stryxen** (10): HOW DID I BECOME A VIRUS?? Is such an amazing lyric you can feel her despair like she’s looking at hands covered in blood. Everyone cried

**akanewasright** (9): this might be controversial given some opinions I’ve seen on her voice - but the choir of her vocals here is fucking gorgeous

**fairytalehigh** (9): maybe the most challenging pop song ever. it's a song about the weight of realizing how fucked it is and how fucked we all are, with no escape. i see this getting devastated in the rate because it's not pleasant but that does not speak to the truth it spills.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Ugh, this one hurts... A lot.

**pig-serpent** (8.5): Another one that starts slow but once it gets going it goes crazy.

**seedub192** (8.2): the back half is gd divine

**1998tweety** (8): 2nd half is really nice

**bbfan132** (8): the arrangements/vocals on this album are gorgeous

**lady\_sable** (8): listenining to this in 2022 is...interesting

**thedoctordances1940** (8): this song wasn't doing much for me at first but then it just started to become fucking amazing

**waluigiest** (8): how did she predict COVID like this fr

**welcome2thejam** (8): The back half is probably hitting a lot harder since I'm doing this while stuck in my room sick

**jman457** (7.4): We are the VIRUS!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): A bit too on the nose honestly, a lot of the other songs on the album are also straightforward with their ideas but they have stronger music/lyrics/emotion to push them away from pedestrian.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): mood

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Covid-19 who???

**roseisonlineagain** (7): feels a lil compositionally off kilter for the first half but when the climax kicks in it's just stellar

**BaconShoes** (6): I think this was explored better in other songs too

**CrimsonROSET** (6): :dkminecart:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the buildup to the final chorus is nice. doesn’t really do much up until that point though

**vayyiqra** (6): Yeah idk, I'm of two minds here: this song is way too doomerish, but also that is the point. She's just expressing these feelings to get them out, which is okay. I still don't like the "humanity is a virus" trope, but let's put that aside. Otherwise, the song is alright but I still don't like the lyrics very much.

**wavingwolves** (5): some of the production moments in this are quite nice

**Awkward\_King** (2): omg i just found out anohni is british now i dont feel bad abt being mean to her

**MoonlightByWindow** (1.5): i like the production but not much else

**plastichaxan** (10): sophie’s production is just impeccable in everything she does, this is one of the robberies of the rate tbh

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This beat is so quintessentially SOPHIE that you feel her presence on the track right away. And while the track is fairly low key, I think it’s a pretty good braggadocio track

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Quay step on my face with a high heeled boot

**dondurmaya** (10): FUCKING BOP

**jman457** (9.3): Shake your ass popheads

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): the only song of hers i'd heard before this rate and tbh while it still slaps, i'm kinda glad it ended up not being my favorite one on this project!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Um okay werk, this is such a 180 from everything on the playlist and it’s kinda funny but I’m also kinda living for it. Another strong opening track.

**iniekcja\_** (9): i love how recognizable the production is here

**seanderlust** (9): this kinda reminds me of vince staples "yeah right"...i think it's in the instrumental. which makes sense since they're both SOPHIE productions. i think i like the vince track a little better than this, but i do really love her flow here

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): ASMR at the "b-b-b-b" vocal clip + the initial beat drop, when SOPHIE's rubber squeak noise starts. it's perfect

**bbfan132** (8.5): v nice intro!!!

**BaconShoes** (8): a bop but could be better

**wavingwolves** (8): super catchy

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): cool i just want more of it

**1998tweety** (7.5): omg the UNO line

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): me when im bossed up

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Ok, but the beat didn't have to go that hard.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): this is the strongest new york accent I think I've ever heard in a song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what the fuck happened at the end of the song

**frogaranaman** (7): lmfao that chorus sounds so British. "bohsed uhp" lol is a chune innit

**whizzer0** (7): nice to have a less intense intro tbh

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): the intro misleads me into thinking that it's the icy girl remix

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): good but the weakest quay song here imo

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh I thought "this sounds like it was produced by Sophie" and it literally was, how about that

**zenits** (6): perhaps the only sophie-produced song that i just don't like

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I miss playing Uno

**UselessTacooo** (4): the production is cool but “bossed up” no longer feels like a word, but instead just jumbled sounds

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this has got to be one of sophie’s weakest production credits ever. barely indistinguishable from any other generic trap beat that gives quay almost nothing to work with as a result

**pig-serpent** (0): So I hate rap songs that are all bass, and while the production choices are more interesting than most other songs in this style, the rapping is the same level of mediocrity I'd expect from this type of beat. So there's basically nothing about this song I enjoy.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): im not sure what to say about this but the last minute or so really hits

**static\_int\_husp** (7): A continuation of Drone Bomb Me, with somewhat more subdued production. The lyrics are a little more simple, but truly sometimes it’s hard to say anything more than “I’m sorry” in a situation like this

---

**sycorus** (11): the song and music video make me bawl every time

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I feel where she’s coming from here… like what else is there to say but sorry? Words could never be enough so we have to leave it at that.

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): wow

**lady\_sable** (10): it's incredible how much she can convey with so little

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): this whole album is so emotionally harrowing but this is one of the most direct songs which gives it additional gravitas idk

**1998tweety** (9): chilling

**IIIHenryIII** (9): This one deserves all the praise it gets! WTF. It's so simple yet so profound.

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): love how she returns to the narrative from "drone bomb me" from the POV of the bomber. she's complicit, we all are. it's frightening to think about, but it's equally important. i was into ODESZA when this album dropped and i remember thinking the production could pass for one of their instrumentals, which is a mindfuck to think about now.

**jman457** (8.6): I like how it brings it back to the original track

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): a good counterweight to Drone Bomb me

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Woah. This is deep.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): crunchypoohascend

**bbfan132** (8): very 2016 but still good!

**hikkaru** (8): the outro eats

**kappyko** (8): This kinda rehashes drone bomb me's concept

**Uberpigeon** (8): i feel like this is a lesser drone bomb me. then again maybe that was the intention, as like a counterpart song

**vayyiqra** (8): I guess we're kind of retreading "Drone Bomb Me". One thing that strikes me is that Anohni seems to write a lot on this album as if she feels guilty for things that she didn't even do, though maybe that's not the reading she meant. Anyway this is still a moving song though.

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): This is like Drone Bomb Me pt. 2. It’s heartbreaking

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): okay actually liking this one

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): something tells me we aren’t gonna get many funny banners for this album

**BaconShoes** (6): I feel like these themes were explored better in other songs

**seedub192** (5.8): nice lyrics but instrumental is so boring until the last minute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): nothing really of interest in this one until the last minute comes in

**Awkward\_King** (4): i thot she said rice is 💀

**zenits** (4): i feel like i've said the exact same thing like 5 times before but being correct doesn't make the music any better. if anything, it makes it worse since i want to like it

**2dina3dworld** (0): it’s the English major in me,,, but like,,, these lyrics have no sense of art or imagery. They’re just like “I don’t like war crimes” and like cool! I don’t like war crimes either! But the thing is, it comes off as slam poetry done by a high schooler and that makes the message so much harder to take seriously. A picture says a thousand words, and you can paint a picture that’s made up of a hundred words that says a thousand with some good metaphors and imagery. But this song just goes straight to “war? Knock it off” territory, and it cheapens the message.

**wavingwolves** (0): i really felt like i had many different 0 contenders in this album, but this one takes the cake for being so incredibly superficial about its own subject that it ends up feeling like it was a half formed thought about something you can't EVER be half-assed about

**plastichaxan** (8): i hear the video game comparisons and that’s good

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): It kinda bops but also I keep waiting for something new to happen, and aside the outro that kinda slows down, it doesn’t.

---

**throwaway-7650** (10): animal crossing but make it hyperpop

**rotating3Dtext** (9): when something sounds like video game music, i like that.

**TiltControls** (9): not about the song - but this cover art is gorgeous

**lady\_sable** (8.5): animal crossing vocals

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): the chipmunk babble + rubber beat + chimes, i love it

**pig-serpent** (8): Love to see Galen Tipton getting some love here. This song is pretty dope too.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this sounds like if you made a hyperpop remix of a kk slider song

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this is fun it feels like if i yassified the chipmunks

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I keep saying “DESKPOP vibes” but Galen Tipton is literally on DESKPOP I think… stream “Whisper”

**bbfan132** (7): fun production

**roseisonlineagain** (7): same situation as cortisol but this one at least kinda lands in the pool of "i like it"

**celladonn** (6): Galen makes a lot of great stuff, though this isn't a personal favorite of mine. Stream recovery girl & friends!

**welcome2thejam** (6): DJ K.K. Slider productions

**Stryxen** (5): it drags but it bops slightly

**IIIHenryIII** (4): it's listenable

**vayyiqra** (4): Uh I guess Animal Crossing-core is a genre now so whatever I'm too tired for clever comments also this feels like it's 20 minutes long for some reason

**BaconShoes** (3): this was not for me sorry

**seanderlust** (2.9): plus one point for this coming up while I was playing ghost of tsushima and I was chasing a pig that I missed with one of my arrows around while this song played which was very fun. otherwise, no sorry the instrumentals are fun but confusing and the pitched up fast forwarded vocals are not it

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Definitely like how this keeps building and layering on top of itself. Not sure if I like how it kinda just repeats in the middle, but booths halves, even if samey, are good

**plastichaxan** (7): cute bop

---

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): wait this is actually so good

**whizzer0** (9): fun

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): the vocal reminds me of first wave EDM and porter robinson

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Ugh, it's relatable and I hate it, but I love it.

**BaconShoes** (8): this was a vibe

**welcome2thejam** (8): Just me, or do the verses on this and The Weeknd's Starboy have similar flows

**bbfan132** (7.5): kind of one note but a good one note

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I won't say anything, cuz I think you've already said 2much

**Lach#6922** (7): where is the drop? Jk but yeah it just feels like the whole song is just buildup with not much payoff

**pig-serpent** (7): A little longer than it needs to be.

**throwaway-7650** (7): is this T(ikTok)WOE (bedroom pop ver.)? [derogatory]

**vayyiqra** (7): bleepbloop

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): honestly listening to so many of these artists in a row I think we’re starting to develop cliches for this subgenre

**jman457** (6): cute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): hahaha get it bc its called 2much and im giving it a 2 im so original. anyway this is kinda boring

**plastichaxan** (10): as a latine who grew up listening to the song this samples, seeing it turn to something so beautiful and queer made me stan this song more and more, and I WANT A MACHOTE TOO!!! tf

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): All I will say about this is that it led to me writing the dumbest thing I have ever written so please enjoy the Sufjan x Arca fanfic shitpost: https://www.wattpad.com/1182348656-quiero-un-machote

**fadedblue09** (10): Very slick! My favorite on this project by far

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): i feel so sexy when i listen to this

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): poohascend [2]

**nicolas<3** (10): talented brilliant incredible amazing showstopping spectacular never the same totally unique completely not ever been done before

**throwaway-7650** (10): "I'm looking for a quiet guy / Who has good feelings / Who is a nice pussycat" ik this is quite thee self-expose but I feel personally attacked

**wavingwolves** (10): incredibly infectious

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): the intro sound really familiar but i just can't pinpoint where did i hear it from

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.3): We love a trip-hop moment

**seedub192** (9.1): arca x drain gang when

**CrimsonROSET** (9): on one hand, this is nowhere near as experimental as the rest of the album, on the other, i fucking love this

**waluigiest** (9): my knee jerk reaction was to be offput by this song, but I immediately came around to it. It’s sensual with just a taste of industrial that really works. I wish it was twice as long.

**whizzer0** (9): idk what's going on but that was really cool

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): this is like an alternate timeline version of a radio R&B song

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): the dreamy synth makes me lose my mind. Beautiful song

**bbfan132** (8): great production

**ignitethephoenix** (8): wait I’m vibing with this alot

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I love her more slowed down song. They're so beautiful! This is definitely one of my favs.

**Uberpigeon** (8): idk why this is named after a pokemon but its a bop!

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah we're back to that ~ethereal stuff and: good.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Legit thought this said Machoke and was thinking Yes Arca I agree Quiero un Machoke too

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): so this references the song Quiero una Chica which was also sampled/interpolated by a Sebastian Yatra hit that was goddamn inescapable in 2020. This puts a spin on the original straight cis man chorus, and that’s cool.

**BaconShoes** (7): Less interesting than the rest of the songs to me

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Weird disconnect between the first and second half, if they were a bit more cohesive this would have more points.

**jman457** (7): Like the production, dont like the vocals

**pig-serpent** (7): This one has a fun beat.

**slimboyfriend** (7): I like it but idk this sounds like the normie cut of the bunch. I could definitely see straight Lanye fans vibing to this at a sweaty sticky frat house party or something

**1998tweety** (6): bops a bit

**akanewasright** (6): I think I’d like this a lot… with different mixing

**IIIHenryIII** (4): good 4 u

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): im balladphobic

**plastichaxan** (9.5): her flow is just too good and this beat hits just right, this has definitely always been one of my standouts of the EP

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This feels like Quay's most lyrical track. It works pretty well imo. The production’s pretty unique too. As an aside, since it came up in other comments I wanna comment on the use of the f slur in the song. As a trans woman, this is something we get called by bigots fairly frequently. Many of us are confused for or lumped in with gay men by people who call us slurs. Because this word is weaponized against us, reclaiming it here is valid, though I understand why it may make some feel uncomfortable.

---

**fadedblue09** (11): Love those sinister beats and her flow here. Definitely a standout of the rate for me

**Awkward\_King** (10): quay's flow is so good, i think this might be my fave example from the album of her blend between classic east coast rap and the more experimental flourishy showy production she features throughout

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): HER PUSSY WASHED UP STOVE TOP BEEF STEW

**iniekcja\_** (10): lord I've been missing out

**BaconShoes** (9): this was pretty slay

**bbfan132** (9): :listening:

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): wait, am I a slut?

**zenits** (9): this kicks ass

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): [THE F-SLUR?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ESexSa5J8Q)

**seanderlust** (8.3): beef stew............

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): i had my rate playlist on shuffle at one point and mistook this for an arca song before remembering it was quay. i'm not 100% sure what genre of rap this constitutes but damn it's nasty

**CrimsonROSET** (8): we love a month with two rates that use slurs but this time they’re reclaimed so work

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Holy shit! This beat is addicting

**vayyiqra** (8): I'm finding I don't have much to say about this album's lyrics but uh she has a good flow someone said that in #rates and I agree

**welcome2thejam** (8): And I'm willing to give Wilin' a great score for going hard as hell

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): lemme say that both the Smurf and the school skirt lyric both made my brain go :poohascend: but not in a good way, just in a “what am I hearing” way

**pig-serpent** (7.5): The only song from this ep I ever want to hear again. It's proof Quay Dash can make her style fun and chooses not to.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): the f slur doesnt rhyme with magic

**sirpancakeXI** (7.5): really enjoy the production not so much for the verse on its own.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Wait, this is so good! The only thing I don't like is the whispering.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): loveee this beat

**rotating3Dtext** (7): ‘I look bad but you look worse’ I-

**1998tweety** (6.5): bops a bit

**jman457** (6.4): kind of wish there was more to this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): is she allowed to use the f slur

**UselessTacooo** (3): the production is just not hitting for me.

**plastichaxan** (9): i dont have much to say about this brain off just bopping

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Quays flow here is great. I continue to see the Nicki influence, and her bars are pretty vicious too. I really feel like she excels at making this kind of track.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**BaconShoes** (10): ooh this is great this had me twerkin a lil

**frogaranaman** (10): gonna go message random Tinder matches from three months ago and then unmatch them after they get the notification because of this song now

**iniekcja\_** (10): yes queen know your worth

**sirpancakeXI** (10): "they soft like vagina" just cracks me up for some reason

**throwaway-7650** (10): this NEEDS a cupcaKKe remix (most songs in TWOE do tbh)

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): "hardest dude up in your crew? talk shit, he gets slutted out" makes me SCREAM. also quay's flow on this is incredible.

**bbfan132** (8.5): these lyrics <3

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): the hook is so good

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I will

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I thought this sounded very nicki and then she name dropped Pink Friday and well

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): This beat is sick

**nt96** (8.5): Blocked

**Stryxen** (8.4): this feels like being in a tunnel

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): okay she found it again, she found it again

**waluigiest** (8): “nosey like a nosebleed” so bad it’s good

**jman457** (7.7): “Slut it out” line was a serve

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): wow this is a banger

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Not the Nicki reference...

**vayyiqra** (7): Kind of weirdly violent lyrics but I like the beat

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): "i'm punching bitches in they mouth watching hoes bleed" bars

**CrimsonROSET** (6): say no! I believe in you!

**rickikardashian** (6): i like her flow a lot but the beat is whatever

**pig-serpent** (5): This song makes me wonder if increasing the tempo on all the songs I don't like from this project would make them listenable. That said, I think it mostly only sounds good in comparison to her other songs.

**Uberpigeon** (5): i find this production really boring im sorry!!

**wavingwolves** (5): this was a bit misplaced in the tracklist between two MUCH better songs but it's still kinda cute

**whizzer0** (5): I don't like this

**plastichaxan** (10): possibly the biggest robbery in the rate for me, like??? when this got a 0 i was so shook and then it got more and i was just so confused this started out so well and i thought it was a top 10 lock lol

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This is absolutely chaotic in the best way. Sophie’s presence definitely helps escalate the chaos. It feels like the song is being distorted and pulled apart in every direction, which makes it really fun

---

**nt96** (11): Not even the gays are ready for this. Asses will be disintegrated in a kaleidoscopic manner.

**2dina3dworld** (10): the voice at the start sounds like a cartoon character, and that’s a good thing! In this essay, I will…

**BaconShoes** (10): This song goes so hard. Legends only

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Peak :jointslay:

**hikkaru** (10): this is so yass and slay

**iniekcja\_** (10): chaotic neutral

**jman457** (10): This would go off in Euphoria

**kappyko** (10): Clenching cheeks to this

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): it's sad that we're never getting a song with both of these legends again...but at least we have this eternal banger

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): holy fucking shit

**throwaway-7650** (10): both SOPHIE prod. for the other girls in this rate are saur good

**UselessTacooo** (10): Chaos is the way. Somehow it’s the most scattered thing ever, but stays on track and doesn’t get convoluted. Definite 11 contender

**wavingwolves** (9.4): bonita yup yup

**sarcasticsobs** (9.1): what a 4-song run, jesus

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this kinda feels like a panic attack tbh

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): my third eye opened when I realized this is basically Shake It (Arca's Version)

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): when SOPHIE said "weed is my best friend," i felt that

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): wait i forgor how much of a banger this is

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): #FREEPOPPY

**bbfan132** (8): kind of gives me a headache but i don’t mind

**whizzer0** (8): 💜️

**celladonn** (7): Yeah this is as bananas as I would expect a collab between these two to be

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Something just isn't clicking, but I just don't know what. The production is good though.

**seanderlust** (6.2): that's why it's experimental music - some experiments don't work and that's ok! but really, I think there's just too many ideas going on here

**IIIHenryIII** (6): this is what the Avengers would sound like if they ever assembled to make music

**1998tweety** (5.5): doing too much

**vayyiqra** (5): Alright after "Rip the Slit", I'm over the "repetitive for the sake of repetitiveness" thing, but otherwise I like this. This is one of her weird songs where the weirdness works. If she didn't also say "menéalo" eight billion times I'd like it more.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i’m gonna be nicer to sophie on their album, he lies

**welcome2thejam** (4): What is this, a crossover episode?

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): That moment when Arca, a rate participant, comes across SOPHIE, another rate participant, and discusses how best to maximize their joint slay, but then fails and just creates a track that annoys reddit user /u/Ghost-Quartet

**frogaranaman** (0): not to be "old man yells at cloud" but this literally just gives me a headache

**ignitethephoenix** (0): when two powerful people combine and instead of making something mind blowing, their powers cancel each other out and they make something shit.

**nicolas<3** (0): literally traumatizing

**plastichaxan** (9.5): scary banger

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This is very abrasive and get why some people are turned off by that for sure. To me I think it skates that very very thin line where I enjoy it.

---

**BaconShoes** (10): this whole album is excellent omg this song goes so hard

**celladonn** (10): Oh fuck yes

**pig-serpent** (10): My favorite type of rappers are the ones who are basically just screaming and Rook lays down a hell of a hook. Expecting a 3+ controversy score on this one for obvious reasons.

**roseisonlineagain** (10): hell yeah go rook

**seanderlust** (10): i'm afraid this is a little too screamy for popheads so it's gonna be rated lowly (please prove me wrong here raters!) but if this appealed to you, please check out this LP. it was one of my favorite albums of 2021.

**Stryxen** (10): how are the vocals so satisfying

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): im glad this isnt in the main rate bc id honestly have to consider giving this an 11 im genuinely in awe with this one

**xavieryes** (10): I was not expecting a rap metal artist here but this is incredible

**zenits** (10): should've been in the main rate tbh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): More Backxwash in popheads rates. Plz collab with Denzel Curry omg

**fairytalehigh** (9.3): i was talking to my roommate when this song came on, he gave me a weird stare and that qualifies as a win

**Awkward\_King** (9): im going to hell

**iniekcja\_** (9): h-how did i never realize it was Rook on the chorus

**thedoctordances1940** (9): absolute fucking banger but unfortunately there's no way most of ph is gonna like trap metal, let's just hope those people didn't do the bonus rate

**welcome2thejam** (9): Not usually my scene but I can appreciate how hard this goes

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): i do NOT see this doing well but maybe popheads won’t disappoint me for once

**akanewasright** (8): This is really good but I can only take it in small doses

**lady\_sable** (8): very compelling

**whizzer0** (8): I think "STIGMATA" is my favourite of hers, this one was almost too intense for me? But Backxwash is so good in general.

**slimboyfriend** (7.3): is this rage against the machine

**bbfan132** (6): i liked backxwash’s parts but ada’s parts were admittedly very hard for me to listen to :/ i definitely respect this though

**cremeebrulee** (5): i feel like . i could like this in a few more listens but i’m not there yet

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I think about Backxwash a lot because there’s a fabric at the store I work at that looks like the cover of *GOD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS LEAVE THEM OUT OF IT* but I can’t say I love listening to their music.

**nt96** (5): anyway >.>

**seedub192** (4.2): first verse starts with the lin manuel miranda flow

**rickikardashian** (3.5): i could hate this more

**DaHumanTorch** (3): sorry this is just not for me

**fadedblue09** (3): kinda unsettling I'm sorry

**jman457** (2.5): mom pick me up, im scared. Sounds like Eminem honestly.

**TiltControls** (2.5): I'm sorry, but I can't enjoy a song fully with the vocal stuff like this one uses at the start/during the chorus

**1998tweety** (2): mom come pick me up im scared

**IIIHenryIII** (1): stay there

**throwaway-7650** (1): erm...

**vayyiqra** (1): Uh everything about this is unpleasant, the vocals are hideous, even the artwork is nightmarish, and yeah I like nothing about this! I wish I could 0 it. This is way worse than "Obama". I had to skip this. I see she won a Polaris Prize (which is like a Canadian Grammy kind of) in 2020 and I don't get it.

**plastichaxan** (10): this was what got me into arca, she shared a snippet of the rap part at the end, which took like a year to materialize but god i was obsessed with that snippet and i started listening to her, going on a journey to find out about myself, which i did, i owe arca and this song finding my nonbinary identity and a lot about what this meant for myself

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is a great album opener. Very assertive, lots of bragging, and the breakdown in the beat in the second half of the song is one of the cooler parts of this album.

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): hell yeah, Nonbinary representation! Fuck it up, Arca!

**BaconShoes** (10): I love both the lyrics and the production

**bbfan132** (10): underrated by some!!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): tee hee hee bitch!

**iniekcja\_** (10): made me want to get french tips

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "what a treat it is to be nonbinary my cherie tee hee hee bitch" is the best piece of lyricism in this rate

**throwaway-7650** (10): lowkey a better rapping performance than any quay dash song

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm nonbinary so i can't really give this song any other score it's like the law

**zenits** (10): this goes HARD

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): thank you for teaching me what french tips are, Mx Arca!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.3): I’m getting ethered

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I hated this when I first listened to it so I’m glad I gave it a second chance and paid closer attention to the lyrics because she’s serving it. A killer introduction to the album.

**lady\_sable** (9): fuck gender all my homies hate gender

**waluigiest** (9): unafraid to be lucky or unlucky

**iAmNotKateBush** (8.5): french tips wrapped round a-

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Wow, that was an intro!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): help i’m still stuck on “French tips wrapped ‘round a dick”

**UselessTacooo** (8.2): It would be a blah track, if it wasn’t for that incredible second half.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): work

**IIIHenryIII** (8): destroyed every single bitch

**nt96** (8): cocks glock BOOM

**slimboyfriend** (8): I love her speaking voice. And the imagery of French tips wrapped around a dick… she’s a visionary

**vayyiqra** (8): That was short but cool. How to make a statement in two minutes.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.4): this was such a weird choice for a lead single but also totally the only choice? great intro even if it's not something i go back to very often

**Awkward\_King** (7): pussy

**Leixander** (7): love some parts of this but honestly the weakest track on the album

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): slowflabster then flabster...queen of duality

**1998tweety** (6.5): this feels very empty

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why is this slam poetry but if it happened in a dystopian uprising

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this feels like three unfinished songs crammed into one. the “speak for yourself” part is so much better than the beginning and the ending i wish she just made the whole song sound like that

**rickikardashian** (6): the dings at the end were giving drivers license

**jman457** (5): a bit underwhelming as an opening track

**nicolas<3** (5): her rapping is the only good thing about this song

**pig-serpent** (4): The first half of this song is baby's first slam poetry but the 2nd half has a decent beat.

**roseisonlineagain** (4): nope sorry

**seedub192** (4): sets the stage but not really worth revisiting tbh

**plastichaxan** (10): another rate where we rob shygirl i’m scared for AS5

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Shygirl has never not made me want to shake my ass, and this song is no exception. This is also probably the most unique beat she’s ever been on. The staccato abrasiveness on the verses match Shy well, and the breakdowns in between verses along with the refrain are kind of an innovative chorus. Overall, unique and refreshing.

---

**UselessTacooo** (11): when Shygirl is on the song, you immediately know it’s going to slap, and slap it does. I feel like I’m going to explode every time I hear it

**BaconShoes** (10): yas such a vibe

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): if you give this anything less than a 10 reevaluate your life tbh

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream cleo (not the edit) pls, it hasn't even hit a million on spotify

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): I believe in Shygirl supremacy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Shygirl makes me feel like I’m the villain of the club

**iniekcja\_** (9): after thorough examination I conclude that this has a bit of an Amnesia Scanner vibe to it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): easily some of the most insane production on the album so far. it almost sounds like two completely unrelated songs playing at the same time but it oddly works

**slimboyfriend** (8.8): this bitch is short circuiting

**seedub192** (8.6): bangs

**Stryxen** (8.3): yass we love an asexual anthem

**Awkward\_King** (8): That moment when you, a Queen, come across another Queen, and discuss how best to maximize your joint #SLAY

**bbfan132** (8): not the most memorable song but still enjoyable

**jman457** (8): Inject this industrial EDM shit in my vains

**pig-serpent** (8): Shygirl features always slap and it's easily the best beat on the album.

**waluigiest** (8): it’s good and I wanted much more of it

**whizzer0** (8): oh I'm glad I wrote that on the previous track because I quite like this one. I'm long overdue listening to more Shygirl...

**seanderlust** (7.7): i wish i liked this more since i love both of these artists. i guess what i'm saying is arca and shygirl another collab when (like i would love to see shy on something more like the instrumental used for nonbinary, or arca's take on her track with sega bodega or something. i think shy has a great personality - to put her sonically more in the background feels like a waste of a good shygirl feature)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): The Production! The flow! Everything is amazing!

**fairytalehigh** (7.3): this song has always struck me as more of a sketch than a song, which is disappointing. i hoped to shake this feeling while relistening to the album for the rate but alas.

**1998tweety** (7): shygirl eats but wbk

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): this is honestly... so disappointing for a collab between these two tbh

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Sorry I thought you were transphobic at one point SHYGIRL! Anyways this song is a cute little collab but SHYGIRL’s solo music is better, I really wish they’d just gone in on the club sound without all the pointless electronic breakdowns that don’t do anything other than distort a potentially good track. Idk why hyperpop producers feel the need to do this, it’s like crumpling up the Mona Lisa.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): c-o-n-f-i-d-e-n-t vibes

**CrimsonROSET** (5): https://i.imgur.com/yhpKNqN.png

**vayyiqra** (5): shygirl jumpscare (this is a joke)

**iAmNotKateBush** (4): its ok

**nicolas<3** (1): this actually gave me a headache not even lying here

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I will say, as a trans woman who works in technology, I definitely enjoy Katie Dey’s shtick. On the other hand though, I’m not sure how much I vibe with her in the context of this rate. Something about the softer and cleaner sounds is slightly less appealing than the warped abrasiveness around it. It’s nice though.

---

**iniekcja\_** (10): okay this is great

**roseisonlineagain** (10): run for cover records you are whole-ass cowards for dropping katie from your roster

**throwaway-7650** (10): just me or production-wise this is 2 you (queer ver.)

**welcome2thejam** (10): Wow, the build on this is incredible

**zenits** (10): i know i've called a lot of music in this rate 'one of the greatest of all time', but there is just a lot of amazing stuff in here -- including this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): This is so raw and beautiful

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): you and me both bitch

**lady\_sable** (9): beautiful

**pig-serpent** (9): Just a magical song.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): mixed feelings

**plastichaxan** (10): every. line. hits. this is my go to karaoke song cause it just has everything i love and more, there is not one second of this song where i’m not just screaming along or dancing and just ugh i love it it gives me that buzz

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): The bonus rate should have just been all the Riquiquí Bronze Instances tbh. But seriously, there’s so many changes in this song that it's hard to keep track of and slightly disorienting, but it’s done very well.

---

**letsallpoo** (11): i want my casket to be lowered to this song

**iniekcja\_** (10): where do I submit Riquiquí;Bronze Instances(1-100) for a rate

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): lord the production on this entire album is so good

**nicolas<3** (10): the outro single-handedly carried this

**nt96** (10): meow

**seanderlust** (10): these are probably my favorite lyrics thus far on the album

**throwaway-7650** (10): LOVE IN THE FACE OF FEAR / FEAR IN THE FACE OF GOD YASS

**UselessTacooo** (10): I have absolutely no clue what’s happening but I AM living.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): There’s like a beat switch every 3 measures and honestly? Exactly!

**BaconShoes** (9): She snapped

**CrimsonROSET** (9): on first listen this sucked but then I replayed it and loved it? What the fuck

**fairytalehigh** (9): LOVE IN THE FACE OF FEAR, FEAR IN THE FACE OF GOD

**lady\_sable** (9): you can just tell she's having fun here i love it

**uncreativivity** (9): I love how rubbery the song feels, everything just kinda bounces back

**waluigiest** (9): this gets me amped!!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Her voice shows off so much personality in this one. Nonstop energy

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): EN CAMARA LENTA

**bbfan132** (8.5): kind of messy but in a good way

**Awkward\_King** (8): arca

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i appreciate the absolute breakdown of the song at the end

**Uberpigeon** (8): riquiquikardashian

**jman457** (7.6): like the vocals

**wavingwolves** (7.1): experimental music to shake your ass to

**hikkaru** (7): but when are we rating Riquiquí;Bronze Instances(1-100)

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I kinda dig it

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): The flow of this song is so good! Can barely even hear what she's saying, but tbh I Don't care cause this bops.

**vayyiqra** (7): This is kind of a banger but I'm trying to translate the lyrics to this album myself and my Spanish is not that fluent and would anyone like to explain why she is talking about mayonnaise in the same song where she talks about the fear of God

**whizzer0** (7): production on this one reminds me of the artist Grove who I recommend if you like this sort of thing

**1998tweety** (6): idk about this one

**pig-serpent** (6): I like the dark energy on this one

**slimboyfriend** (6): I tried to plug my earbud Jack into my ear

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): It sounds like this is about something really personal to Arca so I feel kinda bad giving it a bad score… and yet here we are.

**ignitethephoenix** (4): it’s cool but a struggle to listen too, just a bit too claustrophobic. I could only really bear it for a minute or so

**vayyiqra** (9): Ngl this song reminds me very strongly of early Grimes and that's why I like it, but also the lyrics are nice. A good reminder that it's okay to take time for yourself and for self-care! I need that rn!

**zenits** (9): as a song on its own, it would deserve a much lower rating (like a 6-7), but in the context of the album? great shit

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): Mx Arca coming for Enya's bag and i'm here for it

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): stunning synths

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): It sounds much better in its own song than it did on the Rain On Me remix.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): started out as a banger but it became uncomfortable after a while

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I have nothing against acting like a slut or looking like a bitch (or doing both at once) but I didn’t need to hear about it this much

**lady\_sable** (7.5): oh this is absolutely getting stuck in my head at 2am

**plastichaxan** (8): i usually dont like songs where the mixing is off but i think it just really works here, this has a lot of elements from early 90s rap that i just love how much she was inspired by it and has given her own twist to that

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This beat is probably one of the better non-Sophie ones for Quay. Super menacing, and fits very well with her rap persona.

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): god this is just so smooth, quay is such a good rapper and it rly shows on this which sounds so reminiscent of like a classic 90s rap track. one of my fav discoveries from a rate in recent memory its so yass slay

**2dina3dworld** (10): https://youtu.be/nVmXsBNfwHY

**akanewasright** (10): the mixing is a bit weird but I can overlook it bc I’m just screaming the lyrics with it

**bbfan132** (10): i love this <3

**dondurmaya** (10): girlboss YUP!

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): D-A-S-H

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): she literally ate so much here...reminds me of a 90s rap song

**nt96** (10): Nas is shaking in his timberland boots.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): huge fan of the flow here

**seanderlust** (10): banger of an instrumental that sounds like something off Madvillainy. 60s cartoon batman villain vibes

**UselessTacooo** (10): you can hear how much fun she’s having here, and it makes the song that much better

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): I love how old-school the beat sounds

**wavingwolves** (9.5): feels oldschool in a really cool way

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): weirdly enough the stilted, almost annoying sample works soooo well with this

**BaconShoes** (9): this had more of an old school vibe, i liked it

**CrimsonROSET** (9): This is me coming from a ‘don’t know shit about rap’ moment, is the region war still that big of a thing? I thought it was more of a 90s thing.

**lady\_sable** (9): her voice kind of reminds me of cupcakke a bit

**Stryxen** (9): this is HORRID (9)

**welcome2thejam** (9): I mean, if you're gonna make a track called Queen of NY with a strong East coast type beat, you better deliver, and she does

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): those horns sound so dissonant and kinda unsettling, but it really works so well with this track, it makes it all feel so intense

**seedub192** (8.2): nasty

**fairytalehigh** (8): love the way quay flexes while the beat is so anxious

**frogaranaman** (8): giving Beastie Boys a bit

**hikkaru** (8): cmon accordion (?)

**throwaway-7650** (8): the instrumental gets old but I love her verses in this song so

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I love her flow on this. Her delivery is so good too!

**vayyiqra** (8): What a weird sample but she makes it work well

**whizzer0** (8): I like the beat

**jman457** (7.7): Move over Nicki

**celladonn** (7.5): A bit of a vibe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): “got him hard like a number 2 pencil” LMAO some of these lyrics are actually kinda hilarious

**waluigiest** (7): there’s this dissonant train horn kinda sound in the background and at first I liked it but it’s also distracting.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): yeah it's fine innit

**1998tweety** (6.5): King of New York, lookin' for the Queen. Uh, you got the right one, hmm

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I was expecting something more intimidating, but I'm not disappointed

**sirpancakeXI** (6): it is slowly growing on me but it is still the weakest quay song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): okay wait this schtick wore thin fast, three tracks in a row was too much

**pig-serpent** (3.5): This song would be a neat, smooth cut if it didn't have the obnoxious detuned "BWUMP BWA BWAAaaAAAaa" loop making the song basically unlistenable.

**plastichaxan** (10): this song is like buried deep into my thoughts, whenever i just need to do some introspection i come back to making myself these questions in the form of this song i don’t know it just helps me reach that clarity

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Personally, I feel this is a bit of a lull in the middle of the album. The vibe here is pretty nice though. In a different context maybe I’d like it more? The guitar-y synths through the second half are pretty cool though.

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): This is an unexpected 11 for me, but honestly it's so gorgeous? The small pitched up voice is so emotive and vulnerable, and then the payoff at the end is stunning.

**Islands** (11): so many tracks on this album are reasonable 11s but this whole song feels like that floating hedgehog gif

**akanewasright** (10): This was uh… actually one of the songs that I only really clicked with after Sophie passed. I 100% considered this a weaker track before that, but I found this really sweet and comforting in the face of that. It’s just so sweet and kinda… gross? In a way? Sorta like hearing the inside of a kiss. Either way, this song is so lovely, so pink, so… perfect, I can’t help but love it. I’ll be sad when this leaves day 1

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): okay this is gonna get robbed but it's so tender and sweet

**daybed** (10): SLAYTUATIONNNNNN :sob:

**dondurmaya** (10): THIS SONG IS A JOURNEY

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Xtina outsold, not because this is bad or anything just because “Infatuation” by Christina Aguilera is a banger and we all need to appreciate it more. This is one of my favorite SOPHIE tracks actually, I love the emotions and the journey the production takes. I know SOPHIE was kinda more recognizable for the insane off-the-wall stuff but this softer side really suits her, like, it BUILDS to the noise and it feels so earned.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): just gorgeous

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the delicate piano mixed with the glitching snyths is so fucking divine like holy shit wow

**roseisonlineagain** (10): the first time i heard this song in twenty-eighteen while i was still deep in the closet my reaction was just "what the fuck is this" and after enough time and embarrassing crushes i finally just hear this and go "yeah i get the vibe"

**whizzer0** (10): I want to make a TV show with this as the theme song

**BaconShoes** (9): gorgeous, stunning

**fairytalehigh** (9): i LOVE the way how this song progresses from something cute/curious to pained/existential, just in how SOPHIE tweaks the production and cecile believe's vocals grow more intense.

**pig-serpent** (9): This song reminds me a lot of Aquatic Ambience. SOPHIE's not quite as good as the Donkey Kong soundtrack but she's pretty close.

**Uberpigeon** (9): i wanna know

**waluigiest** (9): the melody on “infatuation” is everything :’)

**sirpancakeXI** (8.2): not the biggest fan for the vocals in the intro but the other parts are very solid

**1998tweety** (8): pretty [2]

**Awkward\_King** (8): i love the buildup on this song it feels worth it

**bbfan132** (8): the second half brings this song up for sure, the first half is a bit messy

**Stryxen** (8): that guitar (?) is a genuine collapse

**vayyiqra** (8): I like this a lot but have to admit it doesn't really go anywhere

**welcome2thejam** (7): God that high-pitched voice had me really hovering my finger above the lower scores, but it thankfully pulls together by the end

**jman457** (6.9): Production crisp as always but the vocals are giving me vocaloid and I dont like that

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I love how it feels like a reprise of the previous song but on it's own it doesn't do too much for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): im not gonna lie the baby voice is kinda annoying especially in the beginning of the song but the ending is good enough for me to most not care about it

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the baby voice part is so unnecessary … I really like most of the production on here (except towards the end) but I’m not feeling the vocals fully

**throwaway-7650** (6): the baby voice is even harder to get into here vs. the last song

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): I'm sorry, but I'm not a big fans of songs that just repeat themselves over and over.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): same

**CrimsonROSET** (4): this sounds like my computer is having an error

**2dina3dworld** (3.5): this is one of the songs that’s meant to be deep, and I get and appreciate the sentiment, but really, it sounds a bit too much like a musical interpretative dance and it throws me off.

**iAmNotKateBush** (0): the only OOEPUI song that never really did it for me, plus 'drone bomb me' deserved an 11

**plastichaxan** (10): this is the closest to a bop i can find in this album and i’ll treat it as one thanks

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Anprim anthem. But seriously, you can really hear the devastation in her voice on this song. Probably one of Anohni’s most emotional performances on this album, and kinda makes me more empathetic with her lyrics.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I love the ambiguity of this song, like there’s the obvious political angle that permeates the album but it kinda feels like ANOHNI is calling out to something even larger than that, it’s like she’s asking what god had the audacity to sculpt us out of clay if this is where we were going to end up. I think this one is the most cutting in the rate for me because it’s kind of like… yeah, why the *fuck* have we been born into a world that doesn’t belong to us? What was the point? You should have left us where we were instead of bringing us here just to be miserable and doomed.

**2dina3dworld** (10): this rectifies most of the mistakes of the past few songs in the album (read: boring enough that you begin to really notice the amateur lyrics) by being pretty interesting and using slightly more language features than say… Obama.

**Awkward\_King** (10): pretending the things i dont like abt this song arent there bc the things i do like are really cool

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Sometimes, you gain nothing. You only lose.

**frogaranaman** (10): please take me out violently and quickly

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): its late at night oh my god i am so lonely

**kappyko** (10): TRUEEEEEEEEEEEEE

**lady\_sable** (10): existential angst time baby!!

**mudkip1** (10): fuck this was really good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this feels like the closest this album comes to a straight up bop… which is saying something with how heavy the lyrics are

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this sounds so bright and euphoric for such a doomery sentiment, which is a juxtaposition Ahnohni uses to heartbreaking effect throughout this album

**Stryxen** (10): me but the earth is my bed

**welcome2thejam** (10): Absolutely killer production. So much of this album plays with contrasting of beautiful sounds and dark lyricism, and I think it works especially well here. The instrumental has the all the feel of a soundtrack to stunning clips of the Earth's beauty, and she comes in lamenting that she's living through the destruction of it.

**jman457** (9.5): Really appreciate the metaphor and production on here

**seedub192** (9.5): whew

**TiltControls** (9.5): frogs whenever they get picked up

**pig-serpent** (9): The more conventional aspects of this song are much needed after the previous few songs, and I think she's doing all of them really well.

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): leave it to anohni to perform an elegy about ecocide over sunburst synths and twinkling marimba. it hurts me to listen to, which is precisely the point. a perfect example of beautiful imagery poisoned by the reality of the violence that anohni voices all over the album.

**1998tweety** (8.5): beautiful

**seanderlust** (8.3): shoutout to whoever on genius commented on the "blue line of tuna's throat" with just a pic of a fish. thanks for clearing that up

**bbfan132** (8): really pretty sonically

**nt96** (8): The ground and rocks when Earthbenders are fighting

**sirpancakeXI** (7.5): this sounds very different than the last two tracks and i really prefer this style better.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this one sounds nice actually. i can enjoy listening to this if i ignore the weird antinatalism thats in the lyrics

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This is song about animals going extinct right? Or am I just crazy?

**BaconShoes** (7): I guess when she called this “Hopelessness” she really wasn’t kidding

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Most relatable track

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): so true civilisation was a mistake we should all be grubbing around in the mud hunting mammoths eating berries and chilling out... instead we have to have rent and passports... less fun imo

**vayyiqra** (6): This seems to be another environmentalist song which is more straightforward, like "pollution is bad", the kind of stuff that was big in the 90s when I was a kid. Idk if I like the underlying idea here being "return to nature" because I'm not sure there is such a strict divide between natural and artificial but that's way beyond the scope of this rate! Getting deep.

**cremeebrulee** (5.6): she gets it, like i didn't ask to be born either!!!

**rickikardashian** (3.5): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/626601739835015181/928479022088867840/gayassjudge.png
