**static\_int\_husp** (8): Yeah I knew before the rate even started that this was gonna be the most controversial song in the rate. It is maybe a little heavy handed, and I think a lot of the criticisms of the album really stand out in this song. On the other hand, I feel like it sounds very foreboding, which is kinda neat

**plastichaxan** (7): ngl seeing how much disc whores this sparked in the discord server i wanted this to be even more controversial for our leaderboard but oh well, i‚Äôll take it

---

**thedoctordances1940** (11): Ok yeah I'll have to justify this won't I, especially when it's up against some phenomenal songs like Faceshopping, I could have just 11ed instead. Yet here we are. I'm assuming this is going out first or if somehow not, incredibly soon after, which is just incredibly wrong but I also can't say I'll be too disappointed about that because it's not something I'd expect to be to the sub's taste anyway, this has way more in common with Swans than Carly Rae Jepsen. Structurally and vocally Obama is essentially a post-rock song, with shorter verses in quick succession followed by a chorus that just repeats one word over and over again. It makes for a pretty characteristic post-rock song structure, and on top of that Anohni's vocals also feel like they would fit perfectly, their droning quality works perfectly here. The main thing that makes this not a post-rock song though, is obviously the instrumental, which is a lot more electronic than rock, but even then it still creates that same overwhelming atmosphere of impending doom and that‚Äôs exactly what I love about post-rock and why I love this song so much. Obama‚Äôs instrumental is also essentially flawless, every single sound feels like it was carefully picked to aid in the build-up of the crushing atmosphere; the grainy background noise, the loud and booming bass, the tense keyboard that comes in right after the dark backing bass-synth, with those two especially combining to give me goosebumps for the rest of the song, but the one moment that really stands out is the little quick set of bass triplets followed by that first snare hit, it‚Äôs a moment that is nothing short of orgasmic. The overall structure of this song is just incredible as well, the slow rise throughout the verses increases the tension to perfection and when it finally reaches the climax, it‚Äôs a moment of pure bliss.

**iniekcja\_** (10): why does every album here have like three 11 contenders, i physically cannot make a decision

**Leixander** (10): where was this one on your favorite songs of that year's list obama????

**letsallpoo** (10): FUCK HIM!

**lady\_sable** (9): get his ass

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): i'm not sure if the world wept for joy when obama was elected, but i get anohni's disillusionment with him. i've always thought of her singing his name like an incantation; a curse, even. i love how it blooms in the second half.

**bbfan132** (8): i get why people dislike this but the production sounds jarring in a compelling way to me and the lyrics‚Ä¶ i mean, she isn‚Äôt wrong even if it‚Äôs very on the nose/kind of eyeroll worthy to some

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Call it out. People have such a complicated relationship with the Obamas and personally I think that that‚Äôs valid, I don‚Äôt think anyone who was around in ‚Äô08 will remember the *hope* that ran through America as we rallied around his election... he represented a lot to us and I can understand why people struggle to reconcile that with the reality of what the US government and the office of the presidency actually represents. Perhaps that hope poisoned the left tbh because it feels like there‚Äôs still far too many people who are obsessed with surface level pop politics and‚Äì wait none of this is about the song. It‚Äôs alright I guess.

**iAmNotKateBush** (8): drag him

**kappyko** (8): Obama

**nt96** (8): Thanks Obama

**xxipil0ts** (8): - Lingua Ignota vibes on this one!

**celladonn** (7.5): get his ass

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Oh this is a callout track...

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): something about this always gave me Medulla vibes

**slimboyfriend** (7): Anohni dragging Obama BEFORE it was cool‚Äîshe‚Äôs a revolutionary

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): tbh i kinda vibe with the type of singing she does here

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): Obama looking for songs to put on his next playlist and coming across this: üßçüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I gave this a higher score than I expected because the lyrics, while heavy handed, at least aren‚Äôt Commander in Chief and the production is pretty cool

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**BaconShoes** (6): The lyrics spilled but I wasn‚Äôt crazy about this

**cremeebrulee** (6): go off but hood politics washed as far as obama diss tracks go

**frogaranaman** (5): https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/266031283795275776

**hikkaru** (5): i like the production but these vocal melodies are ahh hmm....

**pig-serpent** (5): The instrumental has some awesome spectral beeping and choral passages but I'm not really into the bassy warbling Anohni's doing and it's dragging it down a lot.

**Stryxen** (5): the lack of subtlety in the lyrics relative to the rest of the album doesn‚Äôt do this song any justice, but the instrumental is pretty cool - it sounds like anohni putting him on trial and forcing him to accept his wrongs. Overall it doesn‚Äôt do anything for me but i don‚Äôt mind it

**akanewasright** (4): something something ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pissing on the moon‚Äù

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): While I‚Äôm into the sentiments about being critical with our former president, the execution of the song is such a flop here. It‚Äôs very heavy-handed yet also weirdly amateurish like it should be at an open mic night.

**seedub192** (4): maybe this is gonna grow on me but yeah no not at all rn

**UselessTacooo** (4): Personally, I think it‚Äôs way too on the nose. I like what she aimed to achieve, but I think it missed the mark. Also there seems to a some effect on her voice and it‚Äôs throwing me off

**waluigiest** (4): I admire the nerve to pointedly blame obama for his wrongdoings in 2016. I just think the lyrics and melodies are really bad.

**welcome2thejam** (4): Not liking the voice effect here, but do like the organs(?) coming in partway through. Hearing the complaints over this album's lyrics being way too simple and on-the-nose, I'm gonna guess that this is one of the bigger culprits

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Too on the nose and discomforting sorry

**CrimsonROSET** (3): i wonder who this is about

**IIIHenryIII** (3): For her bravery (really don't like the way she sings it)

**roseisonlineagain** (3): sorry. there's an argument to be made here that this one is pretty good just on the basis of being a solid critique of neoliberalism but also this is just a bad song. i like the part where she says obama

**Uberpigeon** (3): i originally gave this a much higher score but i was dreading having to relisten to it so much that i think it deserved lower!

**2dina3dworld** (1): This is giving ‚Äúwritten by someone who‚Äôs failing a college songwriting class‚Äù teas

**Awkward\_King** (1): WHAT IS THIS JKADSJKDKAS

**ignitethephoenix** (1): based I guess, but like the production here is just too claustrophobic and I don‚Äôt love her voice on here. It‚Äôs giving Gregorian chants. The piano at the end is nice though

**wavingwolves** (1): i don't have any positive feelings about this at all

static_int_husp: 
**DaHumanTorch** (0): this is genuinely one of the worst songs i've ever heard doing a popheads rate and maybe in general

**dondurmaya** (0): i hate obama too but this song is grating x

**jman457** (0): I Like the sentiment behind it but it just sounds amature

**rickikardashian** (0): i think there are some political undertones in this

**seanderlust** (0): i have no problem with what she's saying - actually, i agree with a lot of it. that said...it still has to sound good bestie

**sirpancakeXI** (0): really do not enjoy this song at all. the spoken-word style delivery and the way she repeated obama for a solid minute is not it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i originally had this as a 2 but honestly even that was too kind for this song. some of the worst lyrics i‚Äôve ever heard and the chorus is absolutely dreadful.

**vayyiqra** (0): Yeah okay on this song I see the complaints about this album. This song is a mess, it has no structure, it's way too dissonant, her vocals are weird, the lyrics are way too blunt. I agree with the sentiment here, yeah Obama was disappointing, fair take, but this song is deeply unpleasant to listen and fills me with anxiety. Which I guess was the point, but I still don't enjoy it, you know?

**zenits** (0): i am literally a commie who thinks that neoliberal warmongers like obama deserve to go to hell but if i hear "oooooooh oooooh ooooooobaaaaaaama" ever again i'll become joe fucking biden

**plastichaxan** (10): this placement makes me so fucking angry fr this is one of the best songs in this album

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This is probably the track with the most eerie sounding production on Hopelessness, which is impressive. It‚Äôs a little flat on lyrics compared to the rest of the album, however, which is why my score for it isn‚Äôt higher.

---

**dondurmaya** (10): finally a great song üò≥

**jman457** (10): A shorty but a goody. Feels like a strong statement. Also the production slaps hard

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): is this a witch house vibe? I say it is

**BaconShoes** (9): I love the production here

**lady\_sable** (8.5): the juxtoposition of literal vs metaphorical "birth" is interesting

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I love this beat, it's so good! No clue what she's talking about though...

**fairytalehigh** (8.1): this song takes a bit to get going, but the concept of anohni's vocal as a part of the clipped/chipmunk soul trend keeps me intrigued.

**whizzer0** (8): I think this appeals to me by sounding a bit like early C418

**celladonn** (7.5): This feels like more of an interlude but the glitchy production is cool

**uncreativivity** (7.3): synths are too high ear hurty

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): ok I was really vibing until the part where my headphone jack got disconnected and the music got all fucked up‚Ä¶ it didn't quite have the intended effect on me that I think anohni wanted, it just sounds annoying

**bbfan132** (7): i enjoyed this even if it felt kind of like an interlude

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): almost feels like an interlude tbh

**IIIHenryIII** (7): See? You can say so much more when speaking less

**UselessTacooo** (7): nice interlude, but not much more than that

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): oh this one kinda just happened

**Stryxen** (6.7): this was not as good on relisten lol, a bit interludey and i think it could take its concept further

**1998tweety** (6): not really a fan of this

**CrimsonROSET** (6): A bit forgettable, I‚Äôm afraid.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I‚Äôm sorry it sounds like someone‚Äôs squeaking a rubber ducky

**kappyko** (6): eh

**vayyiqra** (6): Yet another "good message, meh song" track from Anohni. Yeah of course she is right, patriarchy is bad, toxic masculinity is bad, men have a lot of work to do on ourselves, a lot of things have to change. That's objectively true to me. I don't see how anyone here can disagreet. But does that make the song good? ehh it's okay. The lyrics are underwritten is the main problem; she just repeats the chorus over and over. Still she's not wrong though.

**welcome2thejam** (6): There's a lot of song moments that make me feel like it's time to ascend. Much rarer are moments like the low ass noise about halfway through that makes me want to D. E. S. C. E. N. D.

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): the switchup in this midway through kinda devours

**sirpancakeXI** (4): the random glitches in the middle of the songs really scared me on my first listen, i thought my earphone was broken.

**ignitethephoenix** (3): not the static part in the middle‚Ä¶ ouch my ears.

**pig-serpent** (3): The annoyance of this song isn't worth what it does well.

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): my god what even happens in this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): this sounds like a song that would play in the credits for a horror movie about a child that gets possessed by the devil

**mudkip1** (1): i really didn't enjoy this one

**throwaway-7650** (1): really don't like this but I feel bad so I'm not going to give it a 0

**zenits** (1): ...at least it's not obama i guess

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Definitely major Nicki / Lil Kim vibes on this flow. The beat though‚Ä¶ leaves a lot to be desired

**plastichaxan** (7): i can see why this is the lowest rated quay track, but even with this being the weakest in the EP i just really like it, there‚Äôs something so special about her rapping and her lyrics idk

---

**fadedblue09** (10): The intriguing combination of that minor-key piano instrumentation and hip hop beats give this an ominous vibe

**sirpancakeXI** (9.3): it isn't really that experimental but it does bop

**iniekcja\_** (9): what type of leather

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): vibe immaculate

**jman457** (8.7): The piano/production is really good on this

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): wtf she really went off with the instrumentals on this whole album

**seanderlust** (8.5): MAJOR kim vibes on this one

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): i can't tell if her vocal is double-tracked on this song but it always struck me as a group of quays going off at the same time.

**Awkward\_King** (8): this sounds shady but i think the crunchy audio quality actually adds to the aesthetic of the record for me

**CrimsonROSET** (8): heeeey where the bitches at, where my bitches at

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Love the way it sounds

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): don't get tired of this instrumental somehow

**wavingwolves** (7.5): super fun omfg

**BaconShoes** (7): this was decent

**Roxieloxie** (7): :citythots:

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I love this except the piano. It feels like a strange choice for the song.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): her rapping is great here but the production makes me want more

**bbfan132** (6.5): kind of sounds off in terms of the production and doesn‚Äôt really draw me in, not bad though

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): another just fine track

**akanewasright** (6): She‚Äôs giving me everything, but this production is giving me :|

**celladonn** (6): A bit slow and the beat is a bit too empty for me to get into this much

**vayyiqra** (6): Uh this piano loop is making me a little uneasy but the rap goes hard

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): the instrumental is giving depressing kingdom hearts amv

**1998tweety** (5): this is...meh

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Some fun lines in here but this just feels‚Ä¶ mean? And not in a fun way

**Uberpigeon** (4): the piano feels like... a riff that would play for a villain but then it just keeps going and going

**waluigiest** (4): good bars but the beat sounds soooo cheap like what in the world

**seedub192** (3.2): mid2000s type beat

**pig-serpent** (3): Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake, All my life, man, fuck's sake, If I did I menage with 'em, And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake, My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape, Yeah, that was a set up for a punchline on duct tape

**Stryxen** (3): this does nothing this gives nothing

**cremeebrulee** (2): a very nothing song unfortunately

**nicolas<3** (2): why is this giving silent hill soundtrack

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): not this midi piano beat‚Ä¶this sounds like the first draft of a song put together in 5 minutes everything about it sounds so incomplete

**sycorus** (0): doesn't really even sound finished

**vayyiqra** (6): kind of interesting experiment in minimalism

**seanderlust** (4.7): i'm gonna need this song to give me a little more of...something. message is great, she sounds beautiful, the instrumental is uh...charlie do something

**BaconShoes** (4): this came and went

**cremeebrulee** (4): isn't this that bitch from game of thrones

**DaHumanTorch** (3.3): was there even a budget

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): i too need a bag

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This sounds like if Bretman Rock tried to make rap music...

**roseisonlineagain** (7.2): i threw a decimal on this one to keep things interesting, don't really have comments on this album it's just pretty good

**2dina3dworld** (7): same bitch!

**bbfan132** (7): doesn‚Äôt really stand out to me but it‚Äôs fine

**celladonn** (7): Me to the cashier when I forget to bring my reusable bags to the supermarket

**ignitethephoenix** (7): me when the cashier ask me if I want a bag

**Leixander** (7): she really loves Pluto huh

**throwaway-7650** (7): [F- ? [2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ESexSa5J8Q)

**vayyiqra** (7): oh it's about drugs

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): one of the weaker songs here but still good

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): me when i order too much at the restaurant

**1998tweety** (6): meh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): buy one

**fadedblue09** (6): a bit generic compared to the other songs

**wavingwolves** (6): i don't have a bag but i have a PURSE... here it is üëõ. do you like it?

**whizzer0** (6): decidedly not really my thing

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this ones kinda a snoozefest but she's been serving us bops she can have a flop here and there

**seanderlust** (5.5): the interviewer: so what makes you interested in this position? me:

**IIIHenryIII** (5): First, this, and now "Who's Got The Bag", did you all not listen to Gucci Mane and Migos? One of them got the bag

**Stryxen** (5): and she cut shades on top down for this

**Uberpigeon** (5): me when i go shopping and i cant carry it all

**jman457** (4.8): Sounds like filler, which is a problem when there is only 6 songs on the EP

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Don‚Äôt do drugs kids!

**rickikardashian** (4): zzz

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): the chorus sounds like it could be a tiktok sound trend

**waluigiest** (4): it never does it for me

**RandomHypnotica** (2): that super low rumbling bass througout this track is EXCEPTIONALLY grating and made me actually feel nauseous, it's distracting to the point that I can't enjoy the track honestly, each time I listened to the track I found myself holding my breath until the rumble stopped a few seconds before the end, it's genuinely stressful and painful for me to listen to, which is weird since I'm normally fine with all sorts of stuff in hyperpop, but this is just too much :(

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This is both very much a Bjork song and very much an Arca song. Personally, I think that‚Äôs sounds pretty cool, but it definitely makes it a little harder to gain traction for people who don't like one of them.

**plastichaxan** (7): bj√∂rk‚Äôs spanish is certainly‚Ä¶ interesting, but i can overlook it cause this is a pairing made in music heaven, they don‚Äôt have a single bad song together and i stand by it

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): Arca really said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna collab with Bj√∂rk? Great! I‚Äôll rewrite Hyperballad for her to sing!‚Äù

**lady\_sable** (10): i love bjork's voice so much

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): beat song on the album for me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Bjork and Arca is like a match made in heaven, absolutely incredible

**seanderlust** (10): you mean to tell me bjork, arca AND rosalia collabed on this in a way? i need to lie down.

**throwaway-7650** (10): bork is now fluent in another language in addition to gibberish

**UselessTacooo** (10): yasss bjonk slay the down boots house or whatever that thing says

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): inflated bc bjork but also this is just beautiful

**Leixander** (9): bj√∂rk release the damn album challenge

**nicolas<3** (9): day 3 of cleaning my room: when will the end be in sight? all i know is suffering, pain and unending torment. hey google, play afterwards by arca feat. bj√∂rk

**rotating3Dtext** (9): me listening to this: is that bjork

**waluigiest** (9): this sounds like a classic bj√∂rk-arca collab and that‚Äôs not a bad thing

**bbfan132** (8.5): i love how‚Ä¶ fragile? this sounds

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.4): We love the bj√§rbs getting fed

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): when i first heard bjork on this record, i GASPED. then i got to "papi i'm your mami, come let's trade milk" and i fucking expired

**BaconShoes** (8): Bjork thee legend

**roseisonlineagain** (8): bork

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): i can't believe arca solved bjork's riddle

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I really don't understand why Bj√∂rk is taking about honey when Arca wants to trade milk

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Wow, thia is stunning!!! Absolutely gorgeous! I feel like I'm in a cathedral.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): hi hag

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): bj√∂rk singing in spanish is the true jumpscare on this album

**vayyiqra** (7): Yes I too fell victim to the wild Bj√∂rk appearance and was going to make a joke about this sounding like a Bj√∂rk song, and then I realized "oh, this is that song that literally has her on it". :zany_face: And in Spanish! Wild. Uh I want to like this more because I'm a Bj√§rb but it's not that great sadly.

**whizzer0** (7): I really would like to give one of these something other than seven but all of them I'm kind of like "the production is cool but it doesn't really grab me", like I don't think I could see myself listening to these tracks a whole lot

**jman457** (6.9): Its giving Hyperballad remix

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): Bjork on an Arca song, an nightmare for me I‚Äôm afraid.. although it‚Äôs not my least favorite song I‚Äôve heard in this rate so far so props for that

**1998tweety** (6.5): bjork works well on this

**akanewasright** (6.5): I‚Äôm sorry, I see these two together and think about one of the many other songs they did together, Notget. It‚Äôs a better song than this one, but I only know it bc of this one shitpost where it‚Äôs like ‚Äúbjork eating the BTS meal‚Äù and it‚Äôs the audio of her singing ‚ÄúIIIEEEE WIIIHHLLL NOHT FOURGEHHHT, THIIIIES NUUUUGEEET‚Äù

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Bjork was robbed in the Alt-Girls Debuts rate but unfortunately this track reminds me why I don‚Äôt like her, she really is just wailing huh? She‚Äôs at her best when she has, like, a tune to sing, but if you let her go wild with the random electronic noise it just turns into a mess.

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): i thought arca sounds different here then i realised its bjork

**celladonn** (6): A little boring, and I don't know if I love or hate "let's trade milk"

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): it‚Äôs Bj√∂rk, but you know‚Ä¶.. it‚Äôs also the only song on the album I wouldn‚Äôt look forward to listening to again

**wavingwolves** (5.5): arca got the riddle right so she won a feature on her album

**fadedblue09** (5): It's pretty but I feel like it interrupted the flow of the album

**nt96** (5): I was with my best friend Arca :hearts: and we touched dog pee pee :dog:. It was very :sparkles: beautiful experience :sparkles:

**Awkward\_King** (4): this being my favourite bjork song i just know im wrong i should rebuke

**rickikardashian** (4): [bjork after recording this](https://c.tenor.com/rZ_CWQhsHo4AAAAM/selena-spanish.gif)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): tiffany pollard voice BJ√ñRK???

**sirpancakeXI** (3.5): i really try to get into bjork's music i really did but i just can't stand her voice.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): I‚Äôll use this comment as my shield for this whole rate: I‚Äôm not a big fan of experimental music. Like, this song half sounds like an episode of Chopped with so many knives going against one another, and I‚Äôm just asking: and for what

**pig-serpent** (3): Oh cool weird moaning

**Stryxen** (3): i love bjork but her vocals here are not good

**RandomHypnotica** (5): fuck songs that put notification noises in them

**vayyiqra** (5): Feel bad not giving this a higher score because it's not that bad given it was made by a 15 year old

**roseisonlineagain** (3): once again the fifty fifty rule applies here, this is the fifty i don't like

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): appropriating straight culture

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i never liked this one

**1998tweety** (5): not a fan

**rickikardashian** (3): this is giving liz phair - funstyle

**fadedblue09** (2): Ngl this feels like a chore to finish

**vayyiqra** (1): Uh yeah sorry I like this album but hate this. I get this album has a theme of about tearing down barriers and so on and that's based, but the phrase in this song's name just brings to mind a lot of unpleasant imagery and also it's way too repetitive. The pitched-up vocals aren't working for me either, and the end product is unpleasant. Better than "Obama" though. Maybe.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs good for your health. Both ripping the slit and this song.

**flavasavavandal** (0): Purely for the vocal production

**plastichaxan** (8): this hits so hard i love the production and her voice in here quite a lot

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This feels a lot more personal than the rest of the songs on this album. And maybe because of that, the beat feels a lot more subdued than other songs on the album too. Still it‚Äôs decent for a ballad.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is going to get robbed but the drama in this deserves day 3

**CrimsonROSET** (10): very toy story 1

**fadedblue09** (10): A hauntingly intimate moment of the album. The explicit but simple nature of her songwriting really shines in more personal, anectodal themes like this, and I wished she used this as the template for the rest of the album.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is what some would describe as a "big oof"

**nt96** (10): Olive Garden when she caught Bassett Hound with that blonde bitch at Traitor Joe's.

**UselessTacooo** (10): I can‚Äôt get over how incredible her vocals are. The song is perfect all around. It builds perfectly, and is the perfect length

**Stryxen** (9.5): this does seem like just a breakup song at first, singing to someone she no longer loves, but I think it applies to systems of oppression as a whole, which just give up on those that fall behind. The ‚Äúyou left me lying in the street‚Äù lyric suggests this may reference homelessness which is likely to affect transgender people at a higher rate, so the concept of this song comes together really tightly for me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): An album highlight, I love the fire in Anohni‚Äôs singing

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I feel like everyone probably has a different story when they hear this one, it just hits. The funereal organ in the background, the thundering drum machine, ANOHNI‚Äôs wailing voice, it just pushes you to the edge of that grief you‚Äôve been avoiding.

**kappyko** (9): TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**wavingwolves** (9): oh i really appreciate the emotional vulnerability of this one

**lady\_sable** (8.5): an effective portrayal of loss, and the ambiguity as to who (or what) she's singing to really works in the song's favor

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Wait that didn't even feel like 5 minutes. I didn't even mind the repetitive melody that much! It's just so good!

**bbfan132** (8): these lyrics :/// her voice sounds beautiful here

**fairytalehigh** (8): pretty sure this song is going to get the boot Day 1, which is a shame, because it features one of anohni's loveliest performances on the record and one of its most subtly gorgeous productions.

**iniekcja\_** (8): it feels weird to be listening to it sitting in a cafe with very loud cherry music in the background

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): she kinda slayed this one

**vayyiqra** (8): Taking a break for a less political song (or is it? maybe it's about Society and so on) is a good move on this album. It lets the melodies and Anohni's voice speak for themselves.

**whizzer0** (8): I think I would like this more another time

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): at first I was like oh this is a breakup song on a politically album, but then I read the Genius page and how this could be about her falling out of love with the system / institutions as a trans woman. And I love that interpretation of that. I think in that case, it not being so on the nose makes it the best song lyrically so far

**pig-serpent** (7.5): A slow start, but this song goes cool places and the vocals do a great job of keeping the song on track.

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**BaconShoes** (7): Not my favorite sound here but it‚Äôs good

**seanderlust** (7): i know this sounds like a song about a past love but given how politically charged the rest of the lyrics are, i wonder if she is taking the perspective of someone shot by the police. given this album came out a year after the murder of michael brown and the references to the subject leaving her in the street and later walking free, i wonder if maybe she's singing about the exhaustion with the idea that America is a great country in light of repeated murders carried out by police with few officers seeing any real repercussions. or maybe it's about the cruel way undocumented immigrants are treated here? the fact that it could be about the mistreatment of multiple groups is really neat. thank you america very cool :woozy-face:

**celladonn** (6): The least interesting track on the album to me, both musically and lyrically

**jman457** (4.6): drags a bit

**cremeebrulee** (4): i love the interpretation that she's singing towards a political/economic structure and not an ex, but unfortunately the track feels very one-note for its entire runtime

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I'd just tell you to go fuck yourself

**rickikardashian** (4): [zzzzzzz](https://i.redd.it/qsm6r0t75jy61.jpg)

**Uberpigeon** (4): me to this album after this point

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): this one just kinda exists

**2dina3dworld** (3): was that a motherfuckin‚Äô Smashing Pumpkins reference?!?!?!?!

**zenits** (2): i don't love this album anymore either. well, i never did but anyway

**Awkward\_King** (1): this just makes me want to listen to the tyler song

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I‚Äôm writing my comments as a host about a month after I gave my scores and I genuinely do not remember scoring this. Anyways, super glitchy, in a good way, so that‚Äôs cool.

**plastichaxan** (8): very bop yass

---

**lady\_sable** (8.5): idk what she's saying but i agree

**bbfan132** (8): this production is awesome

**fairytalehigh** (8): as a slut for staticky instrumentals with odd time signatures, this stuck with me

**pig-serpent** (8): This is doing the sparse but super loud hyperpop a lot better than most other acts I've seen.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): dog show records proving once again that theyre the greatest hyperpop label out there. stream food house‚Äôs self titled album btw

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): omg more DESKPOP vibes

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): sounds like a 100gecs reject

**seanderlust** (5.7): ykw i don't think i'd recommend 100 gecs as the band to listen to after a panic attack bestie. i mean, do you, but like...

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): blaming HAP for making me hear "cortisol" as "coraz√≥n"

**BaconShoes** (5): yeah idk i don‚Äôt have any desire to listen to this again

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I like a lot of the details here but it feels like it goes nowhere and there‚Äôs little intent with the choices.

**vayyiqra** (5): Idk what this is but it's alright? It's about having an anxiety attack but also a bop so that's cool

**jman457** (4.3): a bit repetitive

**roseisonlineagain** (4): eh i have like a fifty fifty chance of liking this kinda hyperpop adjacent stuff and this landed on the bad fifty

**plastichaxan** (8.5): tbf it‚Äôs pretty easy to bop to this when you don‚Äôt understand english (but i don‚Äôt mind the lyrics that much as some of yall sfd√±ksdk)

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I think it‚Äôs neat that this is one of the most happy, upbeat instrumentals on the album, while the lyrics are about the death penalty. Obviously that dissonance happens a lot on this album, but it‚Äôs still interesting so see it executed so well by someone.

---

**kappyko** (10): TRUE!!!!!!!!!

**nt96** (9.5): ELECTRIC CHAIR

**seanderlust** (9.5): shoutout to Oneohtrix Point Never for the killer keyboard work here. also her lyrics are on point, as they are with most of the rest of this album

**Awkward\_King** (9): i rly like the lyrical themes on this even if it gets kinda clunky sjdjsd and the little keyboard synths in the back are so cute yass 9/10

**lady\_sable** (9): vibing hard with the assertion that the american dream is fundamentally based in violence

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): i approach this record with the juxtaposition of anohni with the production. this song has one of the most striking. it's a gently bouncing sunshine blast of a song, and yet anohni is skewering state-sponsored execution, probably the least sunny topic there is. "please don't have mercy on me," "sometimes a feeling is reason enough," "it's an american dream!" like DAMN.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): something about this feels like a companion piece to Drone Bomb Me but less bombastic, and instead it's a bit more biting? idk how to explain it but it's gorgeous

**seedub192** (8.6): hnng

**bbfan132** (8.5): was bopping and then i paid attention to the lyrics‚Ä¶ oof, definitely an interesting dichotomy

**BaconShoes** (8): inject me baby I‚Äôm a free bitch

**IIIHenryIII** (8): "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted."

**skargardin~~~~** (8): Oh so this album really is dark compared to the other albums in the rate, I'm enjoying it so far, but it's definitely a heavy listen

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I was legit gonna start typing up my thought on the death penalty in this comment but then was like hm‚Ä¶ better not‚Ä¶ song is just okay, not bad but not enough of a bop for me to get into #discourse over.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I love this production, but I have absolutely no idea what she's talking about... Am I dumb?

**jman457** (7.3): Aint she British? Maybe she should mind her damn business

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): it's a good song but I'm not too keen on her vocals here

**1998tweety** (7): a bit of a miss compared to the prior songs but its still decent

**pig-serpent** (7): The beeps really open this song up, and there's a cool expansive ending. Unfortunately, I don't love the vocals on this song and I feel like they take away a lot of the momentum the song builds.

**Stryxen** (7): i don‚Äôt like the sections where she just lists countries like i feel there‚Äôs better commentary to make than comparing america to nigeria, i‚Äôd say the rest slays but that‚Äôs probably not the right word to use for this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I love the synths here but the lyrics again are something I agree with but feel heavy-handed and self-satisfied.

**vayyiqra** (6): Going to use this space to rant a bit: One gripe of mine about the present-day left (and you get used to having them; I have been a leftist for ~20 years, so I know) is how widespread it's become to talk about fantasies of violent revenge and killing of enemies. I've always believed that capital punishment is fucked up and don't think it's justified for any reason, and it seems like a lot of millennials and zoomers are weirdly bloodthirsty, which doesn't fit with that ethic. Even if it's meant to be ironic or a joke or whatever, I still find this attitude of trivializing death to be idk, edgy and offputting. Can we not do that anymore? I just think it's tired. Anyway rant over just had to get that out. Uhh this song is okay I guess. I like the message more than I like the song itself, you know? But it's okay.

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): this is too whispery and ASMR-like for me tbh.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): don‚Äôt let the tankies hear the line about china and north korea lmao

**frogaranaman** (5): hello these lyrics??

**CrimsonROSET** (4): I‚Äôm afraid people aren‚Äôt gonna have mercy on you either, m‚Äôam.

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): if you say you remember what this song sounds like as soon as it ends then i just gotta assume you're lying to me

**wavingwolves** (1): sarah brand did a better job of criticizing the ideals of the "american dream" in american gap rap and i mean this completely unironically

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I honestly think this is one of the most interesting songs on the album. It was created by taking a demo, slowing it down, and otherwise manipulating it. In a way, it‚Äôs a very abstract piece of art. Based on the placement it got, most people in this rate don‚Äôt really connect with it, which is fine. I really like it though. It reminds me a lot of the general anxiety and unease that comes with dysphoria and the revving at the end seems to me to indicate some concrete transformation

**plastichaxan** (7): oh god, well i think this is clearly the weakest track on the album, but maybe i‚Äôm just bad with ambient, of course, this has a lot of elements i really like, but i can‚Äôt go back to it too much, i love the concept, i can put it on as background but i get too impatient listening on its own

---

**Alumineous** (10): This is internal turmoil. Anxiety. When I first heard it, it sounded like what I think death would feel like, or at the very least, at the brink of dying. Maybe that's what pretending feels like.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): holy shit the build-up on this

**daybed** (10): dreamlike, out of this world experience

**hikkaru** (10): in no way am i an ambient listener ever but this track is an ass shaker. it's what i picture the end of the world to sound like and i just think that's so neat

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): underrated as fuck, this is an EXPERIENCE

**jman457** (10): Since we havent rated Sigur ros yet this is the next best thing

**rickikardashian** (10): [the THX sound effect turned into song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWkJ86JqlPA)

**throwaway-7650** (10): almost 6:00 of *ambience* preceded by 1:30 of pots and pans

**xavieryes** (10): this song is a fucking experience. it's simply fascinating. i hope it's not done dirty for being long and instrumental.

**xxipil0ts** (10): - Everywhere At The End of Every Pearl's Un-Insides

**wavingwolves** (9.2): strangely enticing

**BaconShoes** (9): i‚Äôm ascending!!! Idk how she made a motorcycle (i assume?) sound this good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): I think Sophie would have made amazing film soundtracks

**skargardin~~~~** (9): The way this is oddly comforting and incredibly haunting at the same time

**Stryxen** (9): i‚Äôve just never heard anything like it.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): just awesome production even if it is one of the less memorable tracks on the album

**lady\_sable** (8.5): girl help im being abducted by aliens

**bbfan132** (8): gorgeous but will be robbed

**cremeebrulee** (8): this track sounds haunted i love that

**fairytalehigh** (8): we STAN an epic dark ambient interlude featuring a gurgling baby

**Leixander** (8): yassified minecraft cave music

**nt96** (8): It feels like everything around you could collapse within itself at any moment.

**welcome2thejam** (8): An incredible soundscape, absolutely does its job of evoking the kind of fear and dread that makes me want to barricade my door and grab a shotgun

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): this is going to do bad but it's a perfect track within the album. on it's own i have to give it a bit lower than the rest though since this is a rate after all

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This is absolutely beautiful.

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**akanewasright** (7): This is kinda the one song I don‚Äôt adore. It‚Äôs growing on me I think, but it‚Äôs the one song on here I don‚Äôt get excited at the prospect of hearing. Like I start the album and am actively like ‚Äúoh my god faceshopping is coming up! Then not okay and immaterial‚Äù and every other song but this one. But it‚Äôs very well done, and obviously bits of it coming back in pretend world is cool as hell

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I feel like this should be the soundtrack of some NASA video where they show a spaceship landing on Mars and aliens pop out of no where

**RandomHypnotica** (7): this is definitely leaning more into the experimental side of this rate. It's interesting, but ultimately not a track I will revisit much

**rotating3Dtext** (7): scary

**whizzer0** (7): thanks to SOPHIE every time I hear a motorbike slowing down I expect to hear Immaterial next

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): this has very big interlude energy but that does not mean it‚Äôs bad!

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): this is what drowning sounds like i think

**slimboyfriend** (6): I‚Äôm just too dumb to listen to ambient music but it‚Äôs a nice edge into Immaterial

**Uberpigeon** (6): love like a sunset but with blue hair and pronouns

**vayyiqra** (6): Okay here is an ambient piece that is, in fact, ambient. Forget what I said about "Is It Cold in the Water?", it's not really ambient. This is. Ironically this also gives me way more of an underwater (or just around water in some way idk) feeling than that song does. It goes on about two minutes longer than I want it to and gets weird and creepy, but up to then I like it fine.

**seanderlust** (5.3): this is a mashup of one of those "24/7 sleep music" youtube streams with a Fred video and that electric pick the dentist uses to clean your teeth

**celladonn** (5): When I say I love every track on this album I'm pretending I don't skip this

**pig-serpent** (5): I like some ambient (not a lot tbh) and this song just doesn't do anything for me.

**sirpancakeXI** (5): quite tempting to give a lower score to ambient music but it is not really that bad i guess.

**UselessTacooo** (5): your daily reminder that ethereal doesn‚Äôt always mean good

**Awkward\_King** (4): idk how to describe this but the first two thirds of this feels like poohascend but in a way that is not necessarily good or bad it just feels like im ascending but im kinda :/ about it, i like when she starts bringing in the goofy noises at the end but overall i just find it to drag

**IIIHenryIII** (4): yeah, the title is perfect, I always pretend this track doesn't exist

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): girl i am not listening to 6 minutes of glorified white noise

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): sufjan's convocations what are you doing here?!

**fadedblue09** (0): If you're gonna give me a 5-minute long instrumental track, it needs to be more interesting than this

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): I literally restarted this song because I was like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way this song starts with a minute and a half of ambient noise‚Äù and I guess I was technically correct because that‚Äôs just the whole song? In the same charity rate we rated ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Okay To Cry‚Äù we also rated John Cage‚Äôs ‚Äú4:33‚Äù and I gave that a 0 so I guess I should do the same to this because it‚Äôs kinda the same thing.

**plastichaxan** (10): so bjork vibes

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This is definitely very ~vibey~ though honestly I could stand for it to be shorter

---

**iniekcja\_** (10): stream Lotic's last album!!!! Top 5 of last year

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I‚Äôve been meaning to check out Lotic and this is so good! Love all the textures. Will listen to more.

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): it's been a while since i've listened to lotic and i was pleased to see her here!

**jman457** (8.3): a bit long but the production and vocals are really good

**BaconShoes** (8): this was pretty interesting, i kinda want to hear their other stuff now

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): wait I think I‚Äôm hearing something

**lady\_sable** (8): ooh gives me bjork vibes

**pig-serpent** (8): This starts like it's going to be a total banger but then it's actually a lot more chill but still as good as I was expecting.

**throwaway-7650** (8): if this was 2 shorter songs I might have given both 10s

**bbfan132** (6.5): not sure how to feel, it‚Äôs ok but doesn‚Äôt totally come together for me

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): there are definitely some interesting ideas here but like the album of hers i listened to i just don't really care for it

**Leixander** (6): drags on a bit

**Stryxen** (6): served cunt for 3 minutes then served tables for the rest

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): it sounds like its gonna build up to something but then nothing really comes

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): Her voice is so witchy. I like it.

**IIIHenryIII** (2): WTF did I just hear? (derogatory version). The vocals are solid though.

**vayyiqra** (2): uh it's kind of dissonant and creepy and the longer this goes on the more I keep lowering the score sorry I do not like this

**plastichaxan** (10): okay, let‚Äôs address it finally, one of the biggest complaints of this album y‚Äôall had was lyricism, and this is one of the few songs here where i don‚Äôt really understand this criticism, but now thanks to someone i can‚Äôt unhear the animaniacs song and i hate it here

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Definitely feel like the last 4 songs on this album (except for Crisis) are very intimately connected. Building up on the Earth artificially, becoming the virus that kills it, and then the chemotherapy to cure it just makes matters worse. It‚Äôs a bleak picture, but I think the album does a fairly good job of painting it in the final tracks.

---

**Leixander** (10): yakko's world but it is 2016

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is the best closer in the rate imo, it's beautiful, perfectly succinct and to the point, and really drives home the message of the album

**Stryxen** (10): yes the song comparing the earth to a dying woman and humanity to a tumor and simultaneously the overused cure that is killing her faster IS a bop and a twerk moment

**kappyko** (9.5): SOOOO TRUE!!!!!!!!!

**fadedblue09** (9): Album ends on a satisfyingly pleasant note. Also she loves Borneo a lot huh

**iniekcja\_** (9): this is like the evolution of Matangi

**lady\_sable** (9): anohni really is incredible at invoking imagery

**throwaway-7650** (9): "we are all americans now" me when I'm an american on reddit /hj

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): "we are all americans now," ugh

**1998tweety** (8): good closer

**bbfan132** (8): v pretty and effective outro

**jman457** (8): I really like the metaphor in this, but it feels weak as a closing track

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8): liked this more upon second listen

**seanderlust** (7.8): i put this playlist on shuffle and it's quite the experience going from "humanity is a cancer on mother earth" directly into "acting like a slut, looking like a bitch"

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Love the concept, just wish she took more time to develop it more. Had so much potential.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): nice closer

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I like this song, but not as a closer.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): invest in green energy initiatives, so true!

**vayyiqra** (7): Idk I have no comment since this song is saying "exploitation is bad" and what can I even say about that? "No it's awesome"? lol

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): a rather lackluster closer for this album really

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): this song is the symbolic representation of why there‚Äôs so many groups about Americans forgetting that other countries don‚Äôt care about them as much as they care about themselves

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): St. Vincent outsold i fear

**CrimsonROSET** (6): amarrowcan

**frogaranaman** (6): ain't that the bone shit

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Maybe it‚Äôs just that the rest of this album has worn me out so much but I don‚Äôt really connect with this one, it feels like the album has already said everything it needs to and this is just kinda the scraps. It lacks novelty.

**pig-serpent** (6): It's fine, but it doesn't compare to the best this album has to offer and I have no idea why she closed with this.

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i think i want to like this entire album much more than i do but i fear forcing myself would only make me hate it more

**BaconShoes** (5): hm

**wavingwolves** (5): the concept of what she's trying to imply here doesn't work for me at all but it's nice sounding enough, i guess?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i really dislike the way she sings the lyrics in this one. the way she repeats the first words of every line just sounds so off to me

**zenits** (2): if i had to listen to someone list random parts of the world, i'd rather just go with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x88Z5txBc7w

**plastichaxan** (8): i hate y‚Äôall for making me think about the daddy watch me twirl video every time i hear this

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This song honestly made me uncomfortable the first time I heard it. Now that I‚Äôve read the lyrics and annotations for it, I think I like it a little more. But the lines about child molesters were very hard for me, which is maybe part of the point.

---

**fairytalehigh** (10): my personal favorite on the record. likening government surveillance to a loving parent and/or sugar daddy relationship is fucking brilliant. whether it's anohni mumbling "daddy, mmmm" or that slowly warping beat, the song is insidious in how outwardly comforting it can sound.

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): this album is insane

**kappyko** (10): SO TRUE!!!!!!!!!

**xavieryes** (10): One of the most beautifully sarcastic songs ever. We stan ANOWHDEN.

**seanderlust** (9.2): an absolutely brilliant critique of surveillance and the rationale the government gives for it. phew, we are really going IN on the US government huh

**1998tweety** (9): Okay I actually didn't make the connection that this song is about the NSA at first but wow it really does add a lot to the song (and makes up for the a bit on the nose lyric of child m0lesters)

**akanewasright** (9): This is the most seductive way I‚Äôve ever heard anyone say the phrase ‚Äúchild molesters‚Äù

**bbfan132** (9): anohni‚Äôs delivery here is excellent, her voice works perfectly in this song

**celladonn** (9): üëÅÔ∏è

**Leixander** (9): daddy america?? üò≥üò≥

**Stryxen** (9): the big brother parallel mixed with sexualisation of herself and her faceless watcher, it‚Äôs like comparing her assigned fbi agent to an obsessive stalker / fan which satirises the concept of constant surveillance perfectly so so so so cool

**UselessTacooo** (9): Vocal performance is stunning. I still don‚Äôt get why she is calling the guy Daddy but that‚Äôs a topic for another day

**waluigiest** (9): the switch from ‚Äúprotecting me from evil‚Äù to ‚Äúcause I‚Äôm involved in evil‚Äù is INSPIRED

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): "watch me play my silly little shitposts in my silly little rates" - rate hosts

**lady\_sable** (8.5): asserting dominance over daddy fbi agent rn

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): Daddy daddy! Watch me twirl! Daddy watch me twirl!

**BaconShoes** (8): Daddy watch me twirl

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): think the concept of this song is cool about her talking to the NSA person sent to watch her. I like what the commentary about intimacy and state surveillance is saying.

**nt96** (8): Zaddyüòçüò©üò´üí•watch üëÅüëÖüëÅ üëÄ me üòóüòâüòè

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): we need the hosts to play Jill Scott‚Äôs Watching Me after this

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Her voice is so smooth! The production on this one is so good too!

**vayyiqra** (8): On this song Anohni's satire works better and is even kind of funny. Remember how outraged everyone was about mass surveillance and the NSA's spying program in the 2010s and everyone now just accepts it? Pretty screwy! And worst of all, it's only because we have so many other problems. What a time to be alive. anyway mass surveillance still sucks Orwell was right

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): the thing is‚Ä¶ this song is so on the nose but I cannot tell what the hell it‚Äôs about anyway. I know it‚Äôs something about the government monitoring our internet but I don‚Äôt get some of the finer points.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like the idea of this one but the music and lyrics leave something to be desired

**welcome2thejam** (7): Bringing the FBI Agent Watching Through Your Webcam meme to its logical next step

**rickikardashian** (6.5): ‚Äúmy fbi agent‚Äù memes turned into song

**Awkward\_King** (6): she sounds like if u put the stereotypical indie girl voice in like an inverter

**jman457** (5.1): can appreciate the daddy but feels a little shallow in its political commentary

**CrimsonROSET** (5): is this song about the big daddy in the sky

**sirpancakeXI** (5): i knows what she is trying to say but the lyrics really sounds like those corny "haha the FBI agent is watching me" jokes which i absolutely despise. the production is neat tho

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): was daddy really the best word choice she could‚Äôve used in this

**DaHumanTorch** (4): kat in euphoria if she was a conservative:

**pig-serpent** (4): Her cool sound is the only thing holding this song together.

**zenits** (3): congratulations on writing a song about the surveillance state that's bad enough to make me feel sympathetic for the nsa

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): gia gunn i was so bored jpg

**wavingwolves** (2): some of the worst lyrics i've ever seen in a song... just baffling

**IIIHenryIII** (1): She really received critical acclaim for writing these lyrics? I saw critics calling the songwriting accessible, but it's just bad and sounds very amateurish.

**whizzer0** (9): probably shouldn't be longer, but should be longer... I'm predicting underrated?

**throwaway-7650** (8.8): this was a jumpscare the first time I heard it... but then it grew

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this sounds like another song and it‚Äôs really throwing me off

**hikkaru** (8.5): me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): its not okay, its great!

**celladonn** (8): Oh I'm just realizing that Kota Banks did the vocals here, stream True North by her and Ninajirachi

**iniekcja\_** (8): when i think of not okay i think about the remix, that's just how it is

**lady\_sable** (8): girl me neither

**mudkip1** (8): the Alone Mix on her remix album is so good

**nt96** (8): Aren't we all?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Honestly I'm not okay either...

**uncreativivity** (8): good and fun song, but it kinda jolts the aura a bit

**UselessTacooo** (8): a great way to make a full song in under 2min

**pig-serpent** (7.5): The most forgettable song on the album but it's actually pretty nice.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): nice transitional moment but also not something i ever listen to on its own

**frogaranaman** (7): me

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): Charli Charli Charli Charli Charli Charli Charli

**wavingwolves** (6.5): my least favourite by far but it's not bad by any means

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not going for it, at least?

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): when I see an interlude, I floor it

**Stryxen** (5.5): no it actually is okay

**vayyiqra** (5): Uhh I can't tell if I like this. I like the synths but that ridiculously distorted bass is too much and then there's another of my pet peeves (very repetitive vocals).so this is just kind of annoying in the end. Thankfully it's short or otherwise I would tank it a lot more.

**jman457** (4.2): Feels a bit random and scattered

**1998tweety** (3): kind of all over the place

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): me when i hit send on a text too quickly girl what is this

**seanderlust** (2.5): I would say this is suffering from interludephobia but i'm not entirely sure if it is an interlude

**ignitethephoenix** (2): this is very unnecessary and I hate the wet fart noises!!

---

**plastichaxan** (10): i don‚Äôt cry to that many songs and this is part of those few, sometimes these songs just make me want to go and get into a relationship just to relate to them damn

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This is decent, fairly calm. Unfortunately, it definitely does suffer because of balladphobia, as expected in most popheads rates (especially this one)

---

**Alumineous** (10): Not gonna lie, I just love the "calmer" atmosphere of this one in comparison to the rest of the album. And I honestly love the vocals.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): what an ender holy shit

**Stryxen** (10): yass queda todo :yasspastillas::yasstillas:

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Ugh, it's just so good! This might just replace KLK as my favorite. Yeah, it does! Definitely!

**waluigiest** (10): it‚Äôs beautiful and poetic in a way that just washes over you

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): probably my 2nd favorite song on the record. it's disarming for her to be stripped back here. a haunting performance and such a comforting production.

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): this has massive lido pimienta energy (stream *nada*)

**seanderlust** (9.2): again what a cute ballad. i stan carlos and alejandra

**bbfan132** (9): such a pretty outro

**fadedblue09** (9): Reminds me of her productions for Twigs

**TiltControls** (9): absolutely love the dreamy-ness of this track

**UselessTacooo** (9): I actually had a 6 in this place for a while, but after a bit I realized just how great this song is. It works amazingly as a closer. Is it perfect? No, but it‚Äôs close

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): i love the more subdued on this album a lot

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The note from Arca that‚Äôs included in the Genius annotations for this one is really cute and elevated the song for me, I hope this relationship stays happy.

**jman457** (8.5): A good cerebral ending

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.3): balladphobia gonna get this too soon

**1998tweety** (8): this was actually really nice

**BaconShoes** (8): Arca kinda served with the vocals here

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): sounds like something straight off of s/t and what a great closer

**slimboyfriend** (8): someone please call me out because I think this is better than the Bj√∂rk ballad on this album

**vayyiqra** (8): :hanawinsCries: This is so beautiful. I didn't know she had a boyfriend and I'm happy for them. :uwu:

**whizzer0** (8): yeah definitely a nice change-up in the second half, I ended up enjoying this album after all!

**wavingwolves** (7.8): it does its job as a closing track but still not nearly as good as the opening one

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): alright closer, cute moment, nothing special though imo

**rickikardashian** (6.5): kinda boring but i appreciate it after this album

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this needed a kick

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): downer ending for the album tbh

**pig-serpent** (3): Snooze

**Awkward\_King** (1): this sounds like anohni (derogatory)

**nicolas<3** (1): ..... much to think about

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i dont know if id consider this song bad or if id even call it the worst in the rate, but in terms of enjoyment and interest, this song bores me like no other song in the rate does, and sometimes, being boring is worst than being outright terrible. i see no reason to ever listen to this song ever again

**plastichaxan** (8): no cause this song made me have such a crush on Carlos like that man had such a hold over her omg i thought he was just hot

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This feels also a little Bjork-y without Bjork. Not sure if this and Afterwards should be right next to each other on the album tbh. It is very pretty though.

---

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): this is unbelievably gorgeous

**Leixander** (10): pete davidson interlude who??? jokes aside this is fantastic

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): poohascend

**throwaway-7650** (10): um... shoutout to a cute guy in my major whose name is also carlos

**waluigiest** (10): it‚Äôs really a beautiful, honest, romantic song

**zenits** (10): i shouldn't like having this on a hyperpop album but it's just so good

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.6): We love cavernous glitchy chamber pop torch songs. Yea it sounds like I threw a bunch of words together, oh well!

**seanderlust** (9.6): this is so cute omfg

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): v biased because her self-titled is still my favorite album of hers, so hearing a bit of a throwback to the vibes of that was so nice without feeling like a retread

**wavingwolves** (9.4): hedgehog floating gif

**bbfan132** (9): the vocals here are beautiful!!

**celladonn** (9): This is so sweet

**iniekcja\_** (9): unmatched versatility, unmatched!!

**jman457** (9): Sad bop

**UselessTacooo** (8.9): This is what kick iiiii was aiming for, but exponentially better

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this is forgettable, but like it‚Äôs a pretty good song anyway. It just doesn‚Äôt quite ‚Äústick‚Äù. If it did it‚Äôd be a 10.

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): such a pretty interlude, i wish i spoke spanish :(

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): this sounds like one of the minecraft songs thats not a joke it does

**BaconShoes** (8): Beautiful

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Sounds like a Remi Wolf song put through a slowed + reverb filter but like, that‚Äôs a compliment.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): futuristic ballads are free of balladphobia in popheads, right?

**pig-serpent** (8): The high pitched synths sound like a jungle to me. Very pretty.

**skargardin~~~~** (8): can this conquer balladphobia and survive day 1? I would like to think it can **[hosts note: well‚Ä¶]**

**vayyiqra** (8): This is good because it has the ~ethereal vibes I like and is hitting this late at night.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Wow, her singing voice is so beautiful! Her lower register is stunning. Ooh the little twinkle sounds in the background!

**nt96** (7): Its giving Grimes, but a bit better

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**frogaranaman** (6): man I cannot read song titles for shit I'm so fucking dyslexic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): it almost sounds like music that would play during the game over screen of a video game

**Stryxen** (5): en mi tiempo libre y cuando hace calor me gusta jugar al f√∫tbol en la playa

**CrimsonROSET** (4): like this is good technically but i don‚Äôt like it and it‚Äôs also giving me a headache so i‚Äôm conflicted

**nicolas<3** (3): i dont like her singing here im sorry

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): she's the ugly sister

iAmNotKateBush: The only one I‚Äôm kinda sad about is Watch Me. I love Calor & No Queda Nada, but they were the final reveals so I‚Äôll live. Pretending is also GORGEOUS, but I won‚Äôt lose sleep over it. Honestly thought ANOHNI & Quay Dash would be massacred

fairytalehigh: ‚ÄúWatch me‚Äù is my fave from HOPELESSNESS, the beat is so gorgeous and her vocals are so amazing regardless of how ham-fisted the lyrics could seem to be, I‚Äôm crushed to see her go this early. Sad she was out before the rest of the second half (except ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù)
