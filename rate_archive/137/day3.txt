**plastichaxan** (10): the inspiration for this song being on video, and being such a scary moment that a lot of trans women and gender non-conforming people can relate to, and inspiring such a bad bitch song is too iconic for me, this was top 10 for a while and those were the happiest days of being the TWOE cohostie

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Arca I want to shake my ass to this song but the beat makes it hard at times.

---

**akanewasright** (10): I think this is my favorite like… hyperpop sounding song on the record. It’s just so… :flabster:

**Awkward\_King** (10): god this song makes me feel like im made of fire and sexual desire is a currency

**BaconShoes** (10): A bop a smash

**bbfan132** (10): this production…. ugh so good

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this song is who up experimentaling their trans women

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’m short-circuiting in the club and I love it

**IIIHenryIII** (10): le da, le da, le da

**iniekcja\_** (10): it never fails to impress me how emotional this song can make me

**lady\_sable** (10): bad bitch arca is my faaave

**Leixander** (10): re-invented .magik

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SPEAK ON IT.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): it’s so easy to please me with a “latin” beat. but then glitch it out? hell ya

**sirpancakeXI** (10): iconic song and iconic mv

**Stryxen** (10): twerk

**throwaway-7650** (10): the way I flipped the scores for this and time... anna ou that's-

**zenits** (10): this is leagues ahead of the vast majority of music that has ever been released, and it would be an 11 in almost any other rate, but it's not even in the top 3 in this one

**seedub192** (9.5): sounds like speedrunning an advent calendar or something

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): yass we love music that sounds like it was dipped in a mcdonalds sprite

**jman457** (8.6): Lizzie Maguarie entering her hyperpop hera

**celladonn** (8.5): When it gets all distorted and dark... I felt that

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): this song made me discover the dormant gay aspect of my hispanic heritage i never knew

**seanderlust** (8.2): a very interesting song concept - building in feelings of confidence, contrasting them with doubt, and having it all be laid over a positive and loving chord progression! loses just a bit because it feels a little repetitive

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): yeah I guess my ass is kinda shaking to this one

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a lot better after reading what the lyrics are about and how it explains why it randomly becomes so anxious and weird halfway through the song before going back to normal.

**welcome2thejam** (8): There's a warmth to the first and third sections that are wonderful, makes the midsection's chaos all the more interesting

**fadedblue09** (7.5): First fully formed song, but it got repetitive towards the end

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.1): i feel like she's done the experimental reggaetton better even on this album, but it's cute

**pig-serpent** (7): Finally bringing an energy to the sound design that makes this one pretty enjoyable.

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**nicolas<3** (6.5): lots of mixed feelings about this one

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): Wow I didn't expect her to sing in a different language but ok. Production is good, but the vocals are...

**plastichaxan** (10): Sega Bodega is an incredible producer i hope they work together again cause this just keeps getting better with every listen

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Sega Bodega produced the hell outta this one. Add Quay on top, and you have a failsafe recipe to feel like a bad bitch.

---

**sirpancakeXI** (11): this make me feel like a bad bitch even though im most certainly not lol

**BaconShoes** (10): god, Sega is so good

**dondurmaya** (10): sega bodega put his whole salvussy int to this fr

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I just said that “Queen of This Shit” had Quay Dash’s best beat/flow combination in the rate but just because I forgot this was here, it had to snap my neck to remind me and tbh it deserved to.

**iniekcja\_** (10): sega bodega hot

**jman457** (10): Production slaps hard

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): everything sega bodega touches...chef's kiss

**nt96** (10): Azealia Bankrupt found dead in a ditch with all her chickens

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is poppy - don't go outside (quay dash's version)... IYKYK

**waluigiest** (10): NOW THIS is tasty. I feel like a lot of her album tracks were held back by uninspired beats and poor production. This has energy and life and backs up her words. It’s stunning.

**welcome2thejam** (10): She said "give me your Mortal Kombat 2 on the Sega Genesis beat"

**fairytalehigh** (9.8): it's impossible to listen to this song and not feel like you could conquer the world. quay is so good at voicing that.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): all the ppl saying quay's album wasnt experimental all :person_standing: now she brought the bing bong noises in

**bbfan132** (9): great song, production is excellent

**celladonn** (9): Slaps, love Sega Bodega's production

**wavingwolves** (8.9): production is a slay and i love the lyrical rhythm

**hikkaru** (8.5): im going crazy i think this sounds like something from super metroid to my brain but idk what

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): love the beat

**Stryxen** (8): if i were a villain this would be my theme song it’s kinda camp and pussy enough for a villain

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the last minute of this song really brings it all together

**vayyiqra** (8): you know what I'm just going to take her word for it; I wouldn't try to fuck with her either

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This is good, but I feel like I've heard this from her before.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this is like queen of this shit except more but also less at the same time? I’m confused

**pig-serpent** (7): The deconstructed, metallic bassline instantly makes me like this song more than the rest of Quay Dash's songs built over uninteresting sub-basses, but I still think this song is underwritten.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I.D.F.W.T.S.

**plastichaxan** (10): Cecile Believe is an amazing vocalist but the way she shines on SOPHIE’s production is next level, i can’t lie, as much as i love this i think it’s in its right place, just to leave room for more variety in the top 10, but god this song is just perfect

**static\_int\_husp** (7): It’s interesting to have a Sophie song that I like less than everyone else. I just don’t think Cecile’s vocal runs do for me as much as they does for other people.

---

**starla\_** (11): Had to give it to this one. Sophie and Cecile fucked me up with this song and I will never recover. Euphoric as fuck.

**2dina3dworld** (10): me when I go to the beach

**akanewasright** (10): floating

**BaconShoes** (10): her music just has this way of taking you to another realm like this is so stunning

**bbfan132** (10): the vocals…. :poohascend:

**daybed** (10): the vocals, the prodcution, the atmosphere yeah.

**iniekcja\_** (10): everybody say THANK YOU CECILE BELIEVE

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): listening to this at 2am and trying to work out if i'm getting goosebumps from the music or just cold...it's a 10 anyway

**roseisonlineagain** (10): yet another song i am SKIPPING like i have done for the entirety of the last year because it will make me ugly sob

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Björk wondering what the objects she throw off a cliff are feeling:

**TiltControls** (10): me anytime I'm about to go into a pool/lake/ocean/bathtub

**UselessTacooo** (10): no it’s actually lukewarm thanks for asking

**celladonn** (9.5): This has really started to resonate with me more after her passing

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): my theory is that this is an allusion to kate bush's the 9th wave, i.e. the speaker is confronted by a crisis with the same metaphor. it is hammered home by cecile believe's performance, the cooed "cold" sounds just like KB.

**jman457** (9.3): This is giving me heavy Kate Bush vibes

**lady\_sable** (9): she wasn't lying that water really is cold!!

**nt96** (9): It's giving Tekken vibes. Like I'm prepped to fight someone

**Stryxen** (9): it’s only 4 degrees it’s only 4 degrees

**Uberpigeon** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2KAaXPwlVc

**wavingwolves** (8.1): so beautiful

**1998tweety** (8): pretty

**hikkaru** (8): me when i go to the beach

**pig-serpent** (8): Crazy good synth work but it doesn't quite have the same impact other songs on here have.

**vayyiqra** (8): I like this song but get that it won't do well, since it's more uh ... ambient isn't right but it's 5 in the morning so that will have to do. Abstract. idk i'm tired you get the idea

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): is it breathes in coooOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOOoOoOoOoooOoOooOoOooOoOoOooOoOoOoOoOold in the waaaater

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): me as a toddler trying to avoid going in the pool

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I don't know, I'm not the one in the water...

**ignitethephoenix** (7): okay?

**IIIHenryIII** (7): you tell me, aren't your feet in it?

**cremeebrulee** (6.8): the buildup just stopping in the middle and then restarting is a major pet peeve, which sucks because this track is so gorgeous otherwise

**seanderlust** (6.2): this feels like it could be a bjork track. but like, an abrasive, unpleasant one.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): honestly cold water is really good, especially for a pool in a hot day? Good shit

**frogaranaman** (6): that Flume and Eprom remix of this give it a whole new life

**Awkward\_King** (4): i think i am not a fan of how breathy her vocals are here

**plastichaxan** (10): if i had a nickel for every song in this rate that was in euphoria etc.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Obviously, it’s very gec-y. The chorus falls towards the side of that I don’t like, but the rest of the song I vibe with a lot.

---

**IIIHenryIII** (10): you can't spell "haunted" without "ten"

**iniekcja\_** (10): it makes me wanna pick up running and I definitely don't like running

**lady\_sable** (10): would absolutely be my 11 if it were in the main rate

**RandomHypnotica** (10): god dammit laura why is this so short

**seanderlust** (10): this goes so hard goddamn. laura les really killed it with this one

**Stryxen** (10): this is the worst song i’ve ever heard in my life

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i wouldnt be a true 100 gecs simp if i didnt shill for laura’s solo music too

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): honestly I like this more than just about any 100 gecs song i've heard

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): i massively underrated this in the past this is such a fucking banger

**Leixander** (9): outbopped her own band 100gecs with her one solo single tbh

**uncreativivity** (8.8): hell yeah energy

**bbfan132** (8.5): i didn’t get this at first but the chorus feels like a huge burst of energy that you don’t need to comprehend and i enjoy that

**pig-serpent** (8): A little standard for her, which is to say it's still great, I just wish u x me was getting the same love.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): it’s camp bye

**waluigiest** (8): yup I know a gec when I hear one

**zenits** (8): gecgecgec

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.6): gec

**BaconShoes** (7): this was fun

**frogaranaman** (7): my first exposure to this song was a furry Tiktok

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): she better not win just because she’s in 100 gecs, this is not the best song in the bonus rate

**welcome2thejam** (6): Why does this sound like it actively wants to kill me

**jman457** (5.9): isnt this the 100 gecs girl

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (5.5): What the...... It's good, but not for me.

**throwaway-7650** (5): kind of the most #MID song I've ever heard in my #life

**roseisonlineagain** (3): listen, before i get yelled at, i love the gecs, especially the more laura forward songs like ringtone. however, i do not get this song. sorry

**vayyiqra** (3): Uh I know I'm a 100 Gecs hater but that's of their music, not the band themselves. I support them, they seem cool. However this song just isn't good.

**ignitethephoenix** (2): someone stop the Gecs I beg

**plastichaxan** (10): this was always highlighted as the best song in the album and while i agree for the most part, i slightly agree with this being the second highest we see from Anohni, and sooo happy to see this at top 10 as it should be

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Love this as an opener for the album. Anohni calls this a love song from the perspective of a girl whose family was killed by a drone. It’s really bleak but also beautifully produced. This record starts off heavy, and certainly does not get lighter.

---

**Alumineous** (11): The fact that this song is in the perspective of an Afghan girl who lost her parents in a drone attack is just devastating. And it's so hopeless that she now wants to die in the same way. It's like all her hopes and dreams were taken away from her because she knows the inevitability of the same fate.

**iAmNotKateBush** (11): devastating.

**jman457** (11): A fantastic song thats somber with a strong message

**uncreativivity** (11): The song genuinely is terror and synth ascension, absolutely enveloping

**1998tweety** (10): Wow the imagery of this song paired with these vocals and the gorgeous deep production, I'm ascending.

**bbfan132** (10): god this is stunning, wow

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the contrast between the ethereal production and the harrowing lyrics... magical

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Honestly, this song is just- really gorgeous. It’s somewhat stripped back vocally, but it doesn’t need anything big.

**fairytalehigh** (10): if the song's heartbreaking narrative doesn't set the tone for the album, let naomi campbell lip-syncing in the music video--a dark flip of RPDR--do it instead. it's flawless EDM-pop, packed with glittering details and stomach-flipping bass drops. a masterpiece.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I think we all process and respond to the collective trauma of the world differently and so while it’s kinda *weird* to write a song from this perspective, I get where she’s coming from. She abstracts the message such that it’s relatable to all of us, we’re transfixed and almost seduced by the death that’s constantly all around the world and we all find ourselves under the knife eventually.  It’s almost like ANOHNI is trying to rescue this character by transforming an act of terror into an act of love, reframing the situation to dull the crushing ache of it because there’s nothing she can do to actually change it. Maybe I’d feel differently if I were in the country being bombed rather than the one doing the bombing (sorry about that by the way) but I do think it’s a very beautiful song.

**lady\_sable** (10): utterly visceral and heartbreaking

**RandomHypnotica** (10): In any other rate, this would be an easy 11, this song is so perfectly haunting, the description of such a violent, sickening, horrifying murder as something almost beautiful is incredibly unique, and it's captured so perfectly between anonhi's voice, the delicateness of the instrumental, and it's just so perfect, i desperately want this to get the Top 3 it deserves

**seanderlust** (10): gory and bleak lyrics against a shimmering synthy backdrop with lyrics that touch on survivor's guilt, wanting to die and more complex feelings? oh we are in for it with this album, huh

**Stryxen** (10): so ominous, the violent lyrics with the casual vocals and peaceful instrumental, how the character even has a moment where she (a literal child in the middle of a bombing) cracks an “i’m not so innocent” joke. this character has dissociated to a point of not caring, she’s so detached from this situation and anohni shows that by singing to this bomb like a romantic partner - it’s so absurd, so heartbreaking and so brilliant

**TiltControls** (10): close to the 11 and a great way to start the album

**UselessTacooo** (10): I listened to this a few times to rate it, but it’s so heavy that I don’t know if I can ever listen again.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Very seductive. War crimes of passion

**BaconShoes** (9): Powerful lyrics

**kappyko** (9): Kind of a disaster of a song to think about

**pig-serpent** (9): Very cool song and a strong opener.

**whizzer0** (9): my therapist recommended this artist to me before

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): really cool opener

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I love her voice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): for as horrifying as the subject matter of this song is, it’s also oddly beautiful sounding in a way. the music video for this one seems a little…misguided though? i dont think having people doing an interpretive dance is the best video to make for a song about warfare in afgahnistan

**vayyiqra** (8): These lyrics are fucked up, of course, and brutal and bleak, but it makes me extra sad because this song weirdly reminds me of former Popheads mod Jenny, who seemed to like it and used to quote it now and then. I really liked her and miss her. I hope she's doing well.

**zenits** (8): i am not sure if i like this song because it's the first song on the album and it gets grating after one, or because it is actually a standout, but either way, it is much better than the rest that the record has to offer

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I did take a look at the genius page it’s interesting that this is supposed to be from the perspective of someone who has lost their family to a drone strike, and I feel like this does make it a more haunting piece. However I think there was that bit insight missing from the song that could have made it more impactful. But I guess you won’t get that insight from a white woman who hasn’t lived through all that, so instead you’ll get the most broad strokes of the idea. it really just comes off as a dancey piece about being drone bombed and nothing else.

**rickikardashian** (7): [do the kpop girl group smackdown rate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SK6cvkK4c0)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I don't get it... am I missing something? I don't get the hype around this song.

**waluigiest** (7): This song is really unsettling, which I suppose is the point. It’s dark and entrancing. But I also feel major discomfort in projecting a very western guilt onto the victims of imperialism. I just feel there was a way to make this song without roleplaying so hard.

**xxipil0ts** (7): - This is my theme supporting Biden and Harris while living in a third world country

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it's good but could be greatly improved by adding a few elements i think

**wavingwolves** (5): weirdly heavy handed in a way that's not pleasant but musically it's pretty innocuous

**IIIHenryIII** (3): After learning the concept of the song, I just couldn't enjoy it anymore. She might have gotten praise for it, but it just doesn't sit right with me the way she chose to talk about other people's trauma. The instrumental sounds kinda nice though.

**Awkward\_King** (0): this put me off starting the rate and this album specifically for a while ngl i literally just couldn't get past it

**plastichaxan** (10): now this, this i had hope to see go the furthest of her songs, there’s something so grand about it, the lyrics are just heavy but god i feel this song with every bit of me and it’s just heartbreaking but also so nice to listen to for me

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This was the Anohni track that hooked me into the rest of the album. The production is bombastic and epic, but the lyrics are really what hooked me here. The pessimistic, accelerationist perspective of the climate crisis is not really something I’ve heard before, but it does really paint a vivid picture of how things could fall apart.

---

**Uberpigeon** (11): mood i hate rhinos

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is very operatic, it’s comparable to the music playing over a climatic scene in a movie. I like it.

**BaconShoes** (10): She spilled here again and I really enjoy the production

**celladonn** (10): Absolutely love this, the desolate lyrics contrasted with the anthemic sound make it such a gut punch

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I thought 4 degrees was cold, both in Celsius and Fahrenheit? Unless we’re talking about freezerburn.

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): this song is gonna make me have a panic attack

**iniekcja\_** (10): shocking how a song like this can be so catchy

**kappyko** (10): TRUE!!!!!!!!!

**nt96** (10): More like 10 degrees cuz this shit is fire 😩🔥

**RandomHypnotica** (10): yasss slay girlboss let's go queen! pollute the earth! slay those fishies!

**roseisonlineagain** (10): "The bad times they will begin, and from that point everything moves very quickly. You know, this social structure can't bear the stress of multiple crises. Opportunistic diseases, anarchy, martial law, the tipping point. And this isn't in some like distant future. You will live to see this."

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this is what Grimes thought she was doing with the Miss Anthropocene concept

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this album really peaked at the first two songs...

**Stryxen** (10): bop twerk arnedance

**waluigiest** (10): This hits it out of the park as a dark, beautiful song about overwhelming feelings of guilt and complicity.

**akanewasright** (9.5): I feel like I’m making a mistake in writing a long comment against this song while giving it a good score but like… ugh. Looking up the meaning for this was a mistake. Not because the lyrics are bad - on the contrary, this is the most lyrically interesting on the album I think. It’s just… reading about the intent behind it made me realize how much I preferred my interpretation of it, like it’s coming from the perspective of the powers that downplay the climate crisis for personal gain or something about the abstract negative spirit of humanity, not as if it’s one person being like “I did this to the earth so I will take responsibility and play the villain”. Like that’s counterproductive. Blaming individuals, even as one person blaming yourself, is counterproductive. Capitalism is at fault for the climate crisis - most emissions are completely outside of the control of any one person. There are things we can do to help, but your personal carbon footprint doesn’t compare to that of factories, farms, and other institutions that cannot be changed without action from people who are motivated to not act by capitalism. Realizing that attempting to personally take responsibility for climate change was the intent dropped this score from a perfect 10. If you let the writing speak for itself, it’s damn good, possibly the best on the album, it’s just… the directly stated intent is not what I had pegged for the song, and that honestly cheapens it for me. Anyway.

**bbfan132** (9.5): the lyrics are a bit on the nose but 100% agree with her - sonically, i enjoy how epic this sounds

**lady\_sable** (9.5): i've known for almost my entire life that i wanted, desperately, to work in conversation. so yeah this hits hard. i think anohni captures the feeling of helplessness well, with those fucking apocalyptic synths. that being said, i do find turning the responsibility of climate change onto the individual to be frustrating (albeit understandable ig)

**seanderlust** (9.4): songs to play for your climate change denying grandpa while pretending at first to agree with him just to watch him grow increasingly uncomfortable as the song goes on

**thedoctordances1940** (9.1): actually saur crunchypoohascend

**1998tweety** (9): In Celsius or Fahrenheit....or Kelvin?

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): queen of climate change

**fadedblue09** (9): Love the cinematic and menacing vibe, and her vocals make up for the otherwise lacking lyrics

**fairytalehigh** (9): i remember thinking this song was heavy-handed, but relistening today i got chills. the booming drums recall kate bush's "hounds of love," and that song's animal metaphor is a striking contrast to the very real ecocide anohni speaks to here. if you don't listen to the lyrics it's DANCEY, in the most disturbing way.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): utterly terrifying, thanks

**hikkaru** (9): i love how grand this sounds

**Leixander** (9): oil/cement tycoon anthem

**whizzer0** (9): well I am blown away, idk why it took me so long to listen

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): ok this one is kind of a smasha

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): very much enjoyed the percussion on this

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I love the song, but my only gripe is the constant repetition of the chorus. I understand it’s done on purpose, but it drags on. The synth and drum work is amazing though, and really boosts my score.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.2): I feel like trash cuz this kinda reminds me of Sia’s music, sob. However I love the song tbh!

**jman457** (8.1): A little repetitive but also feels euphoric

**TiltControls** (8): the temperature where i am rn

**wavingwolves** (8): this is a bit of a yass

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Don’t Look Up but make it slap

**rickikardashian** (7.8): ill be honest im not sure what she was going for with the lyrics, like i get what she’s trying to do, but i dont know what message she wants me to retain from the song

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This song is overdoing it a little bit; the horns are cool but they sound a little out of place. It's too Hans Zimmer epic trailer music.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): She has to be talking from the view of a politician or something right? She doesn't actually want those things... right?

**frogaranaman** (7): are we suddenly in Antarctica or

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): pretty good

**vayyiqra** (7): Anohni seems to feel guilty about climate change, and I feel like copypasting my comment from HCP about this one song on Plastic Beach where I said that this is counterproductive, because it's a systemic problem caused by a handful of megacorporations, not any one person. But this song, even though it was inspired by Anohni feeling that way, seems more like just ironically claiming to love climate change and that it's awesome. (Which has already been done, by Grimes, and better; but I'm biased there of course.)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i was gonna write a big paragraph talking about the issues i have with the lyrics to this one but i cant exactly find the right words to express my problems with it. im glad she made a song condemning global warming but this isn’t the best way to go around it in my opinion

**zenits** (6): one point for each degree, plus two more because it actually deserves a six

**IIIHenryIII** (0): I had to look up on genius what was her intention with such dark lyrics, and I get where she's coming from; however, it sounds like a failed attempt to me. The lyrics just bring horrifying imagery, "I wanna hear the dogs crying for water". There's no way I can sing along to this. It just evokes depressing feelings and doesn't actually make me reflect upon my behavior. It just comes off as a hollow commentary or something a villain who's planning on destroying the world would say in a cartoon.

**Alumineous** (10.091): Just a phenomenal album. I honestly never heard of this artist before this rate so this was a very pleasant surprise. On my first listen, I just gave everything a 10 because it was just so impressive sonically and obviously lyrically. It is the most political in the entire rate but I think many people mirror the same sentiments.

**xavieryes** (9.364): Fantastic album with lyrics about so many important political topics that you rarely find songs about, and production-wise it's flawless as well.

**iniekcja\_** (9.091): I don't listen to this album often, but every time I do I appreciate it even more. Anohni managed to create a great, cohesive and immersive musical landscape that manages to highlight important problems in a way that never feels forced. It won't be an easy listen for many but in this day and age it's impossible to remain apolitical and works like this are direly needed.

**Stryxen** (8.836): i’ve listened to this quite a few times through now and this is just an incredible work of art - an amazing accomplishment - i doubt i will ever listen to this regularly

**fairytalehigh** (8.809): this album is as dangerously beautiful as an oil slick, a combination of ancient power bloodlet from the earth and swirling rainbow artifice. it is a challenging listen, but it is fascinating how captivating/catchy these songs can be despite being so confrontational. i can't help but feel like this is the album miss anthropocene wanted to be. on that note, shout-out to anohni reading her and elon for filth at the beginning of the NFT trend.

**iAmNotKateBush** (8.773): STREAM 'BIRD GERHL'

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.727): One of the few records of the last couple of years that accurately describes the harrowing unease that permeated the world.

**roseisonlineagain** (8.182): i have no particular opinions on anonhi's solo work since i haven't listened to it extensively before this rate but all of you should listen to hercules and love affair's "raise me up" which remains one of the greatest songs of all time

**thedoctordances1940** (8.064): pretty cool album overall

**skargardin~~~~** (8.000): This is one of the most thought-provoking albums I've heard in a long while. Love the contrast between the productions and the heavy focus on lyrics.

**fadedblue09** (7.409): I can see what she tries to do, but I feel like her songwriting is not strong enough to grasp some of the more complex subjects, and ends up being too on the nose. For what it’s worth I think she has a nice, emotive voice and I love the subtle instrumentation of this album.

**waluigiest** (7.364): I often see Glee described as a show that “covers every social issue possible, but covers all of them poorly.” I feel that this album approaches that point. It ambitiously tackles huge national and global political issues, and is not always successful. The album approaches them all from this lens of guilt that clumsily reduces issues to offensive caricatures at times. That said, I do really admire that it goes beyond “wow things are bad out there” to directly calling out the systemic violent issues. And some of the tracks work well both as songs and critiques. Beyond some of the substantive issues, the production is dark and shimmery in a really excellent way.

**jman457** (7.236): There are tracks that I love, but honestly the lyrics and metaphors are a little too obvious. Which sucks because I love her earlier work with Anthony and The Johnstons

**cremeebrulee** (7.209): there's political breadth to this album that most artists will never even come close to and i really appreciate that. i'm actually really surprised to see the subject matter in songs like drone bomb me and obama, i feel like a lot of westerners are even scared to /talk/ about stuff like that, let alone sing about it. but as much i like the content here, i feel like sometimes the lyrics/vocals and production are competing against each other, so i don't really love this as a project as a whole.

**starla\_** (7.155): Average score 7.2. I've been familiar with Anohni since Antony and the Johnsons. I listened to this album when it first came out and I wasn't able to get into it. I still can't really get into her vocals, but I have to give it to her for these powerful songs.

**welcome2thejam** (7.091): I adore her voice, finding out she was a part of that one great Hercules & Love Affair album set me up to like this from the get-go. I like how it plays with contrasts. Writing holds it back a bit, I'd love to see her with similar sounds but better material.

**pig-serpent** (6.591): I'm probably underrating this one, I think a lot of what I'm not huge on will probably grow on me with more listens and I just didn't give myself enough time with this one before the rate deadline.

**vayyiqra** (6.364): This album was much better than the #rates channel echo chamber led me to believe. I thought it would be strange, dark, abrasive, anxiety-provoking, and all-around just unpleasant and that it would fuck me up to listen to it. For that reason I put off listening to it for a long time. (Also the cover is unpleasant because of my weird phobia of distorted faces but that's a me thing; I can ignore it.) Uhh it turns out this album is kind of pretty and moreso just sad; it's like protest songs for doomers. I like the lyrical themes she went for here and that she was unabashedly political, but I agree that her lyrics are often way too blunt and also repetitive. The songwriting isn't always that strong here and I think some critics overhyped it, but it was an ambitious concept that she mostly pulled off. Not a bad album! Just rather, idk, blunt.

**2dina3dworld** (5.364): this album really suffers from its inability to be subtle about anything. The sounds are interesting, a good framework is there, but half of the lyrics give “assignment where you were asked to write about something important to you” energy.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.136): I'm not one to care much about lyrics when it comes to music, but let's just say I couldn't ignore what I heard throughout the album. For the first time, I couldn't separate the lyrics from the actual music (even with the instruments sounding so good). The songwriting is just too simplistic? It works in some of the tracks, but you can't make it work in a wholeass album. Overall, I like the themes and appreciate the fact that she chose to address such important issues, even when not being successful, imho. It doesn't help that I'm not a big fan of her vocals. Her voice sounds very constrained in some tracks.

**dondurmaya** (4.909): boring overall

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.773): i don’t exactly consider myself an “optimistic” person, and usually when music touches on depressing themes and issues with the world i’m all for it. but even for me, this album is too much to put with at times. for 11 tracks straight, you get nothing but lyrics talking about how much the world sucks, and how humans are awful creatures and we all deserve whatever happens to us because of our actions. it’d be one thing if there was at least one track somewhat happier in tone to break up the depression that plagues this album, but theres nothing there. i tried my best to be kind to these songs but with an album that places this much emphasis on its lyrics, it’s hard for me to be kind to an album where the singer at times directly blames you, the listener, for everything wrong with the world. and as an aside from the actual music of this album for a minute, can i just say the album art for this one really does not sit with me right? maybe this is just because i never heard of anohni before doing this rate, but when i saw the cover for this album, i genuinely thought she was a black woman. so finding out that she is, in fact, white and just layered a black woman’s face on top of her own for the album art…i just think that’s kinda weird

**rickikardashian** (4.736): very pretty production, took me a few listens to appreciate it, but she just doesn't have a good way with words. everything is so heavy-handed, and at times even in bad taste, and i could just ignore them if the songs sounded good, but anohni’s vocals leave a lot to desire and really bring down many of these tracks.

static_int_husp: **MoonlightByWindow** (4.409): hmm...idk how to explain this but part of the problem i have with this album is how the political themes in the lyrics seem both half-baked and convoluted. i feel like it's a very liberal thing to just be like "o yeah america is bad, this country sucks, and we're all gonna die thanks to the world burning shrug emoji", obviously i doubt you could get away with "COMRADES WE MUST FIGHT A VIOLENT REVOLUTION" (not everyone can be sarah brand) but i still think anohni could have done better with expressing the ideas and opinions here. it's weird because actually i agree with everything she's singing about but sometimes it's shoehorned in so awkwardly i'm just like...why. maybe a better songwriter would have been able to actually dissect things fully in a way where you don't kinda roll your eyes (basic example but kendrick's tpab). people are probably reading this thinking it's not that deep but if you're gonna do a political album then do it properly! and imo the best song on this album is the non-political one so maybe that's a sign she should stay away from the political anthems. also even when ignoring the lyrics i find this album very boring musically LOL

**zenits** (4.000): in a rate with 3 great albums, this sticks out as by far the worst. there is very little about this that is there to like. thanks pitchfork for somehow conning people into thinking that this doesn't suck

**wavingwolves** (3.955): this album features some of the worst lyrics i've ever seen. they're both weirdly clunky/awkward-sounding and too on the nose/not well developed. and i'll say, i can ignore lyrics if they're either dumb fun and not very serious or when the production overpowers it enough that i don't pay attention. now, if you're going to touch heavy subjects i do expect them to be handled with more care than what this showcases and the production doesn't really seem make up for any of it, since it's just some nice (at times quite boring sounding) electropop with the vocals always being at the forefront of the mixing making it impossible for me to put the lyrical content aside. i also don't want to sound like the type of person who thinks artists shouldn't express themselves politically at all, cause i'm not like that!, but i think it needs to be done well and with more clear intent and purpose when it comes to the message you're trying to get across. in my country protest music has been incredibly important, especially during our military dictatorship, and i can really understand how meaningful that can be, but i do think that it's also important that it gets done in a less undeveloped and seemly careless way.

**plastichaxan** (10): love the switchup

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): To be honest, I had not heard any Black Dresses music before this rate. I expected this to be way more abrasive from what I knew about them. In fact, I’m almost disappointed that it isn’t.

---

**celladonn** (10): Peaceful As Hell was the best album of 2020 and that's that on that!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I don’t love all of Black Dresses’s music because they can be a bit much but when they hit, boy do they hit! The lyrics of this song are so #relatable and the way they play with sound is incredible. Also Devi has one of my favorite voices in music right now

**IIIHenryIII** (10): WTF did I just hear??? Why have I never heard this before???

**jman457** (10): This fucks hard

**lady\_sable** (10): hnngg the way that the bass works with the glitchy beep boop shit...yeah

**roseisonlineagain** (10): i love rock and roll music with guitars

**Stryxen** (10): yassified radiohead song (positive)

**throwaway-7650** (10): the song title made me think the MV was in mc

**uncreativivity** (10): this song just feels so well portioned and sequenced, the huge noise walls just slide right through

**waluigiest** (10): the bridge is so beautiful omg

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh, isn't that the unofficial Radiohead music school?

**whizzer0** (10): I've heard this plenty of times before but it's too much of a classic to skip

**zenits** (10): black dresses is essential music

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): that collapse at the end :woeperish:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I’m a creep, I’m a weirdo

**BaconShoes** (8): i was going to rate this lower, but then it got a lot more interesting

**bbfan132** (8): good song! (i’m getting lazy w/ comments i know)

**fadedblue09** (8): kinda unsettling, but this time it's a compliment

**fairytalehigh** (8): not huge into black dresses but i LOVE this song.

**iniekcja\_** (8): I'm just happy they're back

**pig-serpent** (8): Remember how hype us Black Dresses stans were when Rook kept posting pictures of her guitar on Twitter and then this song dropped and it was mostly guitar focused and how excited we all were for the Black Dresses rock era?

**slimboyfriend** (8): what is this glitched out 90s girl rock fantasy

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): this is nice but it shouldnt have been like 5 minutes long

**Leixander** (7.5): the last few minutes are great and terrible at the same time i'm so confused

**sarcasticsobs** (6.9): never really got black dresses. ending was cool though

**DaHumanTorch** (5.3): the vocals were giving the millionaires if anyone remembers them 💀

**nt96** (4): It's giving Indieheads (derogatory)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): the only thing that creeps me out is trying to understand how anyone can listen to this and enjoy it

**vayyiqra** (3): Well then. I hate almost everything I've ever heard by this band and was fully prepared to give it a 1, but this is at least listenable. I would never listen to this on its own but it's not the worst thing ever. It's just a meh indie-sounding song. Wait nvm the last minute of it is unbearable but everything up until then was okay.

**plastichaxan** (10): im glad we defeated longsongphobia enough, this song is truly outstanding and i love how much it means, closing the album, the last note we’re left on the entire rate and the entire album, it just makes me teary eyed

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Longsongphobia has been defeated with this entering the top 10. A fun fact is that Pretend World is based on the same sample Pretending comes from, but at full speed. The drops in the first half go hard, and the second half is just a great, spacey outro to this whole journey.

---

**bbfan132** (11): this song…. wow

**daybed** (11): best song of all time.

**iniekcja\_** (11): this is like a premonition scene from a Final Destination movie but 9 minutes long. It just keeps going, endless destruction, no survivors, on the news for the next 2 weeks. In a good way

**skargardin~~~~** (11): this really encapsualtes sophie's vision and artistry so perfectly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): this is literally one of the greatest songs of all time

**2dina3dworld** (10): SOPHIE goes breakbeat: the song

**akanewasright** (10): Perfection? Perfection.

**BaconShoes** (10): it really is like she creates a whole new world here like wtf it sounds insane

**dondurmaya** (10): YASSSSSS!!!!

**fairytalehigh** (10): when i hear this song, i see a primordial landscape, with a roiling sky and volcanoes, cecile as the voice of GOD, exploding from the sky, the blast beats as lightning bolts. welcome to the new world, thanks SOPHIE.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): WHOLE NEW WORLD. [EPIC CUNTY BEAT DROP] and then the saddest outro ever which you will cry to

**mudkip1** (10): the first half is chefs kiss

**nt96** (10): Best believe I'll be bumping to this at the club.

**pig-serpent** (10): I love how the whole song is built on a single riff with crazy amounts of variation to keep the song interesting for almost 10 minutes.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): beyond in love with the first half of this

**sirpancakeXI** (10): praying that it will not suffer from longsongphobia

**throwaway-7650** (10): whole new world > pretend world I'm js

**UselessTacooo** (10): nine minutes of chaotic heaven

**vayyiqra** (10): Can this song defeat longsongphobia! Doubtful! However it does go extremely hard, and I love multipart songs, so fuck it I'm 10ing it. The second part is kind of weird, but also I love ambient stuff, so whatever. It's surreal and psychedelic. What is it about? Idk! Maybe no one does. But it sure is cool.

**zenits** (10): i s2g if you all eliminate this early

**thedoctordances1940** (9.9): insane actually

**seanderlust** (9.7): a jock jam on bad psychadelics. yes this is a compliment.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): the yassification of autechre

**DaHumanTorch** (9.3): an OUTRO! a masterful end to a masterful project

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): this track does NOT feel like 9 minutes wtf, there's so much going on, such a sense of progression it's incredible

**Awkward\_King** (9): this pronoun shit gettin outta hand

**celladonn** (9): What a journey

**hikkaru** (9): aladdin could never

**lady\_sable** (9): nooo r/popheads don't do the 9min song dirty you're so sexy aha

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): bold, no other word for it

**frogaranaman** (8): kinda epic how she jsut Did this shit

**Lach#6922** (8): The song is great but it starts to drags on at around the 5 minute mark for me

**waluigiest** (8): this is one where I love individual pieces and love the idea of it, but im not always fully captivated by it

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): That felt like 9 minutes in the best way possible.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): there's so much going on, I can't even decide whether I like it or don't

**Uberpigeon** (7): i have a pretend world where the album stops after immaterial

**jman457** (6.8): could be like 3 mins shorter

**rickikardashian** (6.8): a little too corrosive for me but still beautifully produced

**1998tweety** (6): theres a LOT going on here, some bits I like and some I don't so I'm giving it a middle score

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I kinda started to tune this out in the middle and you know what? It got better.

**CrimsonROSET** (2): this is just a wall of noise like 70% of the time

**TiltControls** (2): I imagine this'll end up being my most negative take for sure, but I really am not enjoying the song at all. I had hoped giving some time before making my first scores and sending the ballot might've fixed it, but it's still just as jarring now as it was then. I can recognize why people like this and there are parts that are enjoyable enough - which is why I won't give it a 1 or a 0. But it is just... not a good match for me

**ignitethephoenix** (1): this is not Aladdin. Maybe if it was shorter I wouldn’t hate it as much but like 9 minutes of this, is too much hyperpop for me

**TragicKingdom1** (0): wall of noise...and not good noise!

**plastichaxan** (11): after being top 3 for so long, seeing my 11 go out of top 5 in the last few ballots hurt i can’t lie sfksdlfjk, this song means so much to me, idk why it just opened up so many new possibilities to me music wise and the fact that is my most listened song ever felt like the right choice for my 11 even if i had like 20 choices in this rate

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I genuinely hated this song the first time I heard it. But, like a lot of hyperpop-adjacent things, I grew to like it a lot more as I heard it more. Is that Stockholm Syndrome? Maybe. But it’s also just a sexy bop.

---

**Lach#6922** (11): Amazing production

**pheromenos** (11): yass

**roseisonlineagain** (11): this song is a feat just for the fact it manages to follow one of the most tender and sincere tunes on the planet with cartoonish levels of horniness. really good to headbang to in your car

**sarcasticsobs** (11): like Regina Spektor said, the chords and synth make you feel like you're gonna die while clubbing during a horror movie

**seanderlust** (11): the fucking 180 that this absolute banger of a single was immediately following the soft and sweet it's okay to cry ajdskjfls

**akanewasright** (10): I often kinda just… listen to faceshopping and accidentally stream the whole album, so I wind up overlooking this track. But it’s pretty much perfect in what it sets out to do, which is create the atmosphere of some kind of BDSM sexy horror? Which is of course, a massive slay

**BaconShoes** (10): TURN THIS SHIT UP!!!

**bbfan132** (10): i didn’t notice the lyrics for months, whoops

**celladonn** (10): Turn this the FUCK up

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): omg i cant believe i trashed this in the original jukebox when this came out... glad i saw the light and embraced the abrasiveness!

**cremeebrulee** (10): if only i has a second 11

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): YEEHAWRUNNING https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/850825109601386506.gif?size=128&quality=lossless

**daybed** (10): .....this song....one of the most fun beats to ever be made

**dondurmaya** (10): prince philip died because this was played on buckingham palace speakers with a subwoofer

**fairytalehigh** (10): SOPHIE really was like "it's still okay to cry but now it's time to drop ass"

**frogaranaman** (10): I think I became permanently manic after listening to this song the first time

**hikkaru** (10): the duality between this and it's okay to cry as the first two tracks... we love versatility

**iniekcja\_** (10): makes all your friends become whores in just a little over 3 minutes!! stream now!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i remember i showed this to my (at the time) 12yo brother in 2019 and he was like "what the hell do people actually listen to this" and then a couple of days later he asked to listen to it again and now he still streams this song so!

**nt96** (10): Going from emotional to downright horny. Take notes Ms. Jackson, if you're nasty.

**pig-serpent** (10): I remember how in awe I was the first time I heard this song. It's wild and different and I knew immediately that I had found a new favorite artist.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): imagine if THIS was what brony music sounded like

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I remember innocent me watching fantano's year end list and thinking wow ponyboy what a weird name for a song lemme stream it. This is literally my first ever hyperpop song and i think i'm not the same anymore after listening this track.

**Stryxen** (10): she said actually it’s not okay to cry and called us sluts and whores

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): sophie is a horse girl confirmed

**UselessTacooo** (10): while you could argue it gets repetitive, it’s still so unique that the sounds feel new even after 3 minutes

**vayyiqra** (10): And then of course lol @ the whiplash going into this song. I remember finding out what a ponyboy (well a ponygirl, but whatever) was at the tender age of about 14 when I randomly saw one of those vaguely exploitative reality shows with a concept like "my strange addiction", and the episode was about a woman who roleplays as one 24/7. Not many things faze me at my age, so when I saw the title of this for the first time I just kind of lolled. Anyway it does go pretty hard. I have no clue why it's here or what it has to do with the rest of the album but it is one of the best-produced tracks.

**waluigiest** (10): YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE TO CRY NOW SHAKE SOME ASS!!!!

**zenits** (10): this song proves that you can do anything if you are fearless

**thedoctordances1940** (9.7): Absolute banger

**slimboyfriend** (9.1): this song honestly changed my life—I was a different queer before this came out

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the beat goes hard

**skargardin~~~~** (9): name a more ferocious track

**jman457** (8.8): A collapse

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): I like to scare my friends with this song

**wavingwolves** (8.2): wonder if there's any fancams of my little pony characters to this but i hope to never find out

**throwaway-7650** (7.7): personally I prefer the name curtis myself (and stream superfly)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I have no clue what she's singing, but I don't care cause this bops.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I feel like this song low-key changed the entire trajectory of the sub and kinda the “poptimist” scene in general, which is interesting because when it came out [people kinda hated it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7nsoov/the_popheads_jukebox_week_47_its_uyoooooouuuuuuuu/ds4887p/) A lot can change in four years though, maybe we just didn’t “get it” at the time. I still can’t say it’s one of my favorites but I respect it for what it is and I have sought it out on my own a few times.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is a worse version of Faceshopping I’m afraid

**welcome2thejam** (7): Me never actually reading The Outsiders and just making shit up for the book report:

**Awkward\_King** (6): is this what being pegged feels like

**TiltControls** (6): this still isn't a great score, but compared to when I first listened to it it's grown on me quite a bit

**2dina3dworld** (4): this starts off very one note, and by the time it gets somewhere and starts doing interesting things it’s nearly over…

**CrimsonROSET** (2): I’m sorry, this is just- extremely overstimulating.

**1998tweety** (0): this just hurts my ears and there are other songs on the album that do it's job better

**plastichaxan** (10): the true nail biter was this almost not making top 5 it kept going in and out and honestly idk how yall could fuck it up so bad to only have this as the arca song in top 10 but hey at least it’s top 5

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The crossover of HAP and TWoE we all needed. Adding a bit of Roaslia’s sound definitely compliments Arca super well. They build off each other to create a massively appealing crossover sound.

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): it just gives me that buzz

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): WHO SAID RATE WINNER?!

**Roxieloxie** (11): idk why this is the one experimental song in this rate that works for me,,, but it goes off

**2dina3dworld** (10): could put this on at a party and people would go nuts to it!

**akanewasright** (10): is this a true smasha or like a 9? Lemme ponder Edit: yeah it’s a 10

**BaconShoes** (10): ICONIC SMASH, PEOPLE DIED

**bbfan132** (10): chaotic as hell but i love it

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ROSALIA DIDNT ASK TO BE BORN LATINA... NOMAS TUVO SUERTE

**DaHumanTorch** (10): new genre unlocked: regayton

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is an extremely strong 11 contender for me. This song soundtracked my quarantine summer 2020 going for long walks bopping to this. Deconstructed reggaeton perfection!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): easily the best song on the album, no competition

**hikkaru** (10): banger

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): bendecía'

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is a banger

**iniekcja\_** (10): the way this beautifully transitions to Chun-Li by N*cki

**jman457** (10): Does this count as a win for Rosalia

**Leixander** (10): madre mia rosalia bajale

**nicolas<3** (10): not to be controversial or anything but this is her best song

**nt96** (10): This is reggaeton but yassified

**roseisonlineagain** (10): this is the one right here

**rotating3Dtext** (10): me listening to this: is that rosalia

**seanderlust** (10): this goes OFF. maybe my favorite ROSALIA track and that's saying something since i really liked el mal querer. hyperreggaeton BANGER

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i dont know what the fuck she's saying but girl I am living

**throwaway-7650** (10): this outserving most of el mal querer... maybe the colonizer did that

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): This is Amazing!!! The Rosalía part is so good! Didn't expect to like this one that much, but it's definitely one of my favs.

**UselessTacooo** (10): can someone get me a pole dancing routine to this okay thanks

**wavingwolves** (10): maybe rosalía served here

**zenits** (10): almost as iconic as mequetrefe

**celladonn** (9.5): Noisy and chaotic in a pretty great way, and Rosalía sounds really good here

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): Does anyone remember that bit from *Jackass* where they had a roller disco in the back of a moving truck? This has that energy but more fabulously.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): ANOTHER glitchy latin beat, fuck me UP

**seedub192** (9.4): bangs x2

**welcome2thejam** (9): Oh fuck it's an earthquake!

**whizzer0** (9): oh this is good too

**thedoctordances1940** (8.9): just an absolute banger

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): in a just world, i could go out to the club on any given friday and throw ass to this song. but this is not a just world

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this isn’t my type of music at all, but this slaps I’ll admit. I wish there was a bit more Rosalia but like it’s still good

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I feel like a cyborg with a bbl

**xxipil0ts** (8.5): - The yassification of Reggaeton!

**fadedblue09** (8): The Spotify vertical video for this kinda sends

**Islands** (8): latina queens

**vayyiqra** (8): banger

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): bop!

**pig-serpent** (7.5): A little undercooked and stocked with potential.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i can’t believe poppy is gonna get to use the video of the jet flying over rosalia as a shitpost two times in a year

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**rickikardashian** (5): this could fuck so hard but some parts are just so ugly to listen to. rosalia is unlistenable here, and it’s not even her fault i just dont like the vocal effect

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): not sure why this is considered the stand out track on the album. its pretty monotonous and doesn’t really go anywhere. rosalía is helping me from scoring this any lower

**mudkip1** (2): it felt like this song was never gonna end

**xavieryes** (9.750): LGBT+ LATIN AMERICAN SUPREMACY

**iniekcja\_** (9.417): It might be recency bias but I feel like it might be the weakest of all kicks. However, it's still an amazing, almost immaculate project displaying Arca's versatility and her evolution as an artist.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.417): one of my fave albums of 2020 sorry she slayed down so bad here...and it's not even her best album!

**dondurmaya** (9.000): great piece of art with iconic features

**fairytalehigh** (8.783): Arca's progression from experimental weirdo to cyborg diva has been thrilling, to say the least. not my favorite of the series but a fascinating document that rewards repeats.

**zenits** (8.750): not only is this an absolute fucking 10/10, but somehow iii is even better. just holy shit

**2dina3dworld** (8.558): some moments where things start sounding like Arca daycored her own songs. Other than that, the party songs really knock it out of the park and are signs of a producer with great potential to hit it big.

**starla\_** (8.508): Average 8.5. I really enjoy Arca but this is the first time I've actually sat and listened to this album in full. An amazing album with deep cuts I will definitely come back to.

**waluigiest** (8.500): okay I really liked this album. Kinda wish there were 4 more similar albums I could listen to right now :/

**cremeebrulee** (8.333): i've only heard klk/mequetrefe before this rate and while i enjoyed both, i never thought to listen to the whole album but fuck!!! i guess i was sleeping on this!!! i'm gonna go check out all those other kicks now

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.083): Having been aware of Arca early in the 2010s, this is a nice reintroduction to who she has become in this decade. Cannot wait to dive into the other KiCks.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.858): idk I don't really have that much to say about this album, it's not the best in the kick series but it's also not the worst and while I don't think it's highs are very frequent or often, it also doesn't really have much in terms of lows, it's just a very consistently good album imo, not much more not much less

**jman457** (7.808): Has some great songs on here but not my fav here

**Stryxen** (7.683): i still read it as kicky

**skargardin~~~~** (7.500): There are both some songs that I absolutely love and ones that I don't care that strongly for on this album. Out of the albums I've heard from the KiCk series, this is unfortunately my least favourite.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.125): This just gets better the more I listen to. Back in 2020, I didn't like it at first, but it has grown on me since (it ended up being one of my favorites of that year).

**vayyiqra** (6.833): Arca, kind of the final boss of Popheads-core taste. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I have tried for a long time to get into her music, and didn't like any of her work before this (and I listened to most of it). Now I am happy to say I have found an Arca album I like (well, only one song I don't, but otherwise yes). I do also like her work as a producer, like on Yeezus, and some of her stuff with Björk. Someday I will listen to all the other KiCk projects, I swear. As for now this isn't an album I listen to a whole lot but it does have a lot of good moments. Also, it has a cover that is not terrifying like some of her other ones! That's a plus. Idk why she is a cyborg with claws but whatever it looks cool

**roseisonlineagain** (6.750): i think arca used to be pretty good but i think i largely started tuning out of her work around the time her press releases started reading like lines from the architect scene in the matrix reloaded, this album has some good ones i guess

**welcome2thejam** (6.750): All over the place, in a fun way. It rips the slit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.375): there’s undeniably great production in this album, and the highs are some of the highest in the entire rate for me, but this album is heavily dragged down by its ballads and slower songs. arca is at her best when shes making abrasive, loud, in-your-face music that can barely even be classified under a genre and i wish there was more of that and less of the slower songs.

**fadedblue09** (6.333): I'm afraid her music is too wild for my tastes. I appreciate what she's going for but sometimes it just gets too chaotic and the music just doesn't connect. But on a grander scale, I can see the atmosphere this project is going for.

**pig-serpent** (5.708): This album's in a weird limbo where the experimental elements hold back the pop elements but the experimental parts can be pretty weak so few of these songs really work for me.

**frogaranaman** (5.583): kinda crazy how much &&&&& blows this entire series out of the water for me

**rickikardashian** (4.542): i really wish i liked arca more, and maybe one day i will get it, there’s a  chance that in her many albums, there are some stuff that i’ll love, but sadly, i dont think they’re here. the production sounds amazing, arca is undeniably a very gifted producer and is able to create some very beautiful and interesting sounds, but i all the songs feel like they're just wandering and messing around, which might be the intention, but i simply dont like it, i feel like im never going anywhere coherent with the songs.

**plastichaxan** (10): this song makes me feel such a warm embrace and just the need to cry out all the bottled up feelings i have and it has a whole new meaning since her passing im just… god i have too many feelings im so happy to see this finally being appreciated after the original average

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This was so close to being my 11. After Sophie’s passing, which was also the period of time before I came out as trans, where I was close to my breaking point with dysphoria, this was the only song that could actually make me cry. My emotions we’re dammed up, and the passing of a trans icon and total inspiration to me, along with this song being used in so many tributes just caused the dam to break. I am fortunately much more in touch with myself now, but also wish Sophie was still here to keep building her legacy beyond the highs it already reaches.

---

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I remember exactly where I was when I learned of Sophie’s passing. This song always made me emotional but now even more so.

**throwaway-7650** (11): ignoring the fact that I changed my 11 to this to not get dragged, the last 25 seconds... chills. the lyrics *hit*, okay I admit it... I cried

**TiltControls** (11): I think I gave this a 6 or a 7 the last time we rated it, and even by the reveal I fully regretted it. Hits even more now

**vayyiqra** (11): :hanawinsCries: One of the easiest 11s I've had in a while, this song is so moving and beautiful. Both the context behind the song being that it's about Sophie opening up and showing herself to the world with this album (which is why she uses her real voice for the first time, a great touch) and then also the message of the song being very important to me. Repressing your emotions is bad! yet I do it all the time anyway despite knowing it's bad because you know gender roles and stuff, it's dumb. So I love that Sophie made this song telling all her listeners that no, it's okay to feel stuff, and also telling that to herself. I know there are other songs on this album that are more fun but this is the most beautiful. Rest in peace Sophie, you were one of a kind.

**whizzer0** (11): I can't convince myself

**2dina3dworld** (10): highkey this song makes me cry, and I’m sure that will be a really popular opinion. Beautiful, a bit cheesy but sometimes a bit of cheese can be really good.

**akanewasright** (10): I mean… how can I not? This is literally stunning

**Awkward\_King** (10): i cannot compete with the stories other people will have connected to this song, so all i can say is that this feels like a hug and i adore this song

**BaconShoes** (10): omg when this video came out…and listening to this now that Sophie has passed omg 😭😭😭

**bbfan132** (10): the outro is what you hear when entering heaven

**celladonn** (10): Just beautiful, and a very strong 11 contender. This song (and video) means so much to me

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): :( but also :)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A flawless, vulnerable and gorgeous song. SOPHIE was a gorgeous ray of light.

**daybed** (10): best intro ever, any other artist wishes

**fadedblue09** (10): This is like Futile Devices where it acts more of a calm preface to an otherwise eclectic album, but I like it and it's probably my favorite from this album.

**fairytalehigh** (10): gonna take this moment to highlight SOPHIE's vocal. i remember an article describing the close-mic'd performance as sounding like "someone cupping a hand to your ear to whisper" and that's exactly what i get here. a secret message from a loved one. it's so comforting.

**iniekcja\_** (10): it feels weird to say that, but I remember this song didn't capture my attention at first. Back when i fist heard it my music taste was much different and i didn't really appreciate the softness. However, years passed and I consider this to be one of the most essential tracks of what I would call the soundtrack to my evolution as a person.

**jman457** (10): Cathartic, life-affirming, talent, brilliant, totally unique, never the same

**lady\_sable** (10): oof this hits differently now. i miss sophie so much & wish she was still here.

**pig-serpent** (10): So majestic, open, and caring. It's a song that hits in ways no other song does.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it just hits so different now…

**roseisonlineagain** (10): i am not listening to this one again for this rate because i already know if i do, it will make me violently upset. this song is perfect, the universe is cruel, t4t luv forever

**seanderlust** (10): this makes me so emotional. it's so sweet and sincere.

**skargardin~~~~** (10): and cry I most definitely will

**thedoctordances1940** (10): one of my go to sad songs, so often makes me cry

**UselessTacooo** (10): The tenderness in her vocals, matched with the beautiful production is just song creation 101

**waluigiest** (10): this song got me through February 2021.

**wavingwolves** (10): i put this song on a playlist i made for my best friend last year and i didn't hear a single comment on it so i hope it means she liked it?

**welcome2thejam** (10): Very lovely, and I would also use that to describe the explosive last twenty-five seconds

**xavieryes** (10): Heart-wrenching track that showcases SOPHIE's versatility as an artist, being somewhat of a change from her usual hyperactive vibe, but still having an experimental flair to it. Such a beautiful and incredible track.

**zenits** (10): yeah i actually want to cry tbh

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): the ending percussion cacophony is utterly euphoric

**1998tweety** (9): honestly pretty

**hikkaru** (9): :catcry:

**nt96** (9): A song that's taken a new, bittersweet meaning.

**starla\_** (9): I still can't listen to this song without tearing up.

**Uberpigeon** (9): I never really had any strong emotional attachment to this song, nor any great love for it, but with Sophie's passing this song has such a significance to it. It's the song that represents her legacy and I can't not appreciate it.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.7): truly beautiful

**rickikardashian** (8.5): it’s aurkay to cry<3. i fully expect this to win and while it wouldn’t be my top pick, i cant get mad at that result. beautifully produced and will probably remain as the defining SOPHIE song

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I remember when this came out and I was SO disappointed because I thought Sophie was going to start making mainstream music (and then the next single was Ponyboy LOL) but this song is like a masterclass in sound design if you listen with good headphones AND it makes complete sense as the first song on such an introspective album

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I really like this. The lyrics are so good. Like I actually wanna cry listening to this.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this song is just gorgeous, man

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I think the lyrics are truly something special but as a whole for Sophie, the production isn’t as grasping as I want

**Leixander** (7): love the lyrics but i wish this was musically different

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i sorry but the lyrics to this one are just so absolutely corny to me. swap the beat out for a more generic and safer instrumental and itd be almost indistinguishable from your average “inspirational” anthem

**frogaranaman** (4): poignant song lyrically but the mixing on this is REALLY bad and takes me out of it each time I listen :/

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): unfortunately never really been the biggest fan of this song for some reason...i usually start the album from ponyboy tbh

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I’m gonna repeat what I said four years ago when we rated this in a charity rate: “This makes me… uncomfortable. They say that, in animation, even if you want to give a character “doll-like charm” not making them blink is a bad idea because even though it conveys that they’re a doll it’s weird to watch. This song is like that, whispering gives you the aesthetic you’re looking for but it also makes it sound weird and creepy. I’ve never quite gotten the appeal of SOPHIE, either their avant-garde noise concoctions or their pop production, and this does nothing to change my mind.” I’ve come around on SOPHIE more since then but this song is still bad.

**plastichaxan** (10): huge banger iconic line after iconic line

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Chase heard Michete say “I am not like other girls, I have a dick!” and responded “speak 4 urself”

---

**akanewasright** (10): I hear “supersonic pussy dripping juicy” and give a 10. If you don’t do the same I don’t know if I trust you

**Awkward\_King** (10): shes so cunt

**BaconShoes** (10): SUPERSONIC PUSSY DRIPPIN JUICY

**DaHumanTorch** (10): literally every line in this song is iconic. also the lady gaga reference in the opening monologue we had to stan....THIS is how you do a debut single

**Leixander** (10): she's an icon and she's the moment, come on now

**RandomHypnotica** (10): how i wish i could give this song an 11, the absolute power this song serves

**throwaway-7650** (10): the winner. I can't believe I used to think this wasn't a 10

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): so fucking funny, I stan

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Icon is right.

**lady\_sable** (9): she put crack in this

**vayyiqra** (9): This song is kind of amazing. I don't like that weird noise breakdown but that's it. Ridiculous and fun song.

**waluigiest** (9): starting with the Gaga quote….. phenomenal

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): i remember this song getting into the breakdown and staring down at this bitch's face on my phone and laughing my ass off, THEN the beat picked back up

**seedub192** (8.2): it bangs

**zenits** (8): this is really good but it immediately loses points for being a song that i would never ever ever EVER show to another human being

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): yaaaaas Gaga!! If there’s one thing we need it’s definitely more little monster representation in pop music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): let me just say every single one of these points is going to the beat drop halfway through

**1998tweety** (7): boppy

**bbfan132** (7): i was not expecting that noisy part lmao

**iniekcja\_** (7): the rapping gave me arrhythmia

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): it's cool enough but i still just don't love it, i'm sorry

**jman457** (6.6): alright

**frogaranaman** (6): sexually repressed socialite? edit: nvm I get it

**pig-serpent** (6): 2022 is the year I get big titties. I'm chasing my icons.

**IIIHenryIII** (2): for the laugh

**plastichaxan** (10): my god this song has so much power over me, the sophie production, Quay’s incredible flow, i need Quay to get with great producers and release stuff on this level again my god

**static\_int\_husp** (10): We love an absolutely bombastic Sophie beat. Quay’s flow here is also absolutely incredible. It’s no wonder that this is the song of hers that got the most mainstream attention.

---

**fairytalehigh** (11): quite frankly there is nothing that sounds like this song, be it the static shock from a balloon beat, the creepy synths in the bridge, or quay's flow. GOD, quay's flow on this is fucking perfect. there are few feelings as pure as dancing around to "BITCH FUCK THAT FUCK THAT." had we an entire release of SOPHIE/quay collabs, this would be its crown jewel. it FUCKS.

**flavasavavandal** (11): I’m thankful for this rate for putting me onto Quay

**frogaranaman** (11): it's actually unreal how this song created a whole new monarchy system

**kappyko** (11): oh fuck yes

**Stryxen** (11): it's a staple in every playlist people are playing it at funerals it’s perfect for weddings and graduations it has cosigns from the industry and the labels. everybody wants to buy Queen of This Shit on itunes and stream it on spotify apple music and other streaming services

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (11): Get me in the club NOW!!!!!

**2dina3dworld** (10): I love dancey, bad bitch Quay Dash

**akanewasright** (10): It’s hard to talk about this and not Sophie, bc she gave us everything here. It’s like the best production Quay has ever gotten, and she milks it for everything it’s worth

**Awkward\_King** (10): me when im out in london with my london guy looking hella fancy with my london ride but my london ride is just the bakerloo line

**celladonn** (10): This goes off

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean she said it herself

**DaHumanTorch** (10): an easy 11 contender and hopefully will get top 5

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): An 11 contender, a lifesaver, and anthem, an era, a tax refund, a cancelled student loan announcement, a universal basic income check, a rave, a ball, a SMASHAAAA

**fadedblue09** (10): Oh wow a banger. Another 11 contender

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): best beat/flow combination she has in the rate

**hikkaru** (10): the production AHH YASS

**iAmNotKateBush** (10): no other song gets me hyped up like this one

**lady\_sable** (10): sophie never misses

**mudkip1** (10): sophie knew how to elevate everything she touched. she was on a whole other level

**nicolas<3** (10): one of the greatest songs to ever exist

**roseisonlineagain** (10): this better be top five tbh

**seanderlust** (10): FLOW

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Oh she went HARD

**skargardin~~~~** (10): mega bop alert

**throwaway-7650** (10): if I was told this was prod. by SOPHIE I'd believe it tbh

**UselessTacooo** (10): of my god this is so good. The production is slaying

**wavingwolves** (10): oh fawk this beat is so yass

**zenits** (10): i normally hate the idea of including loose singles in album rates, but this song is so good that i'm glad it's here

**seedub192** (9.6): jfc the beat is tickling my brain

**slimboyfriend** (9.1): “got a heavy flow that these hoes can swallow” followed by that slurping sound needs to be immortalized somehow

**BaconShoes** (9): yas i love the production and her flow

**bbfan132** (9): how have i not heard this yet? it’s really good!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (9): she ate

**vayyiqra** (9): banger

**waluigiest** (9): the momentum here is stunning. It’s bouncy and powerful

**welcome2thejam** (9): Hot fuckin track

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): banger

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I live in a country where we don't speak English, but some of us do our best to learn the language (even though we take English classes at school, no one here actually learns how to speak the language). Anyway… I met a dude once who pronounced "crepe" as "crap". Now whenever someone mentions eating crepes, I just cannot imagine them eating crap (oh no, she just licked her lips 🤢 )

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): all of my comments for this album are just "flabster" but really quay is the one to blame for making such flabsterific songs

**rickikardashian** (8): :kiss::lipstick::high_heel:

**jman457** (7.5): I wish sophie put more into this beat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): the queen of new york AND of shit! is there anything she cant do?

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): production is fun but it kinda feels like her on autopilot? idk how to explain

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Ooh, the bass on this song tickles, but it overstays its welcome.

 i was scared to put Quay up for popheads to rate i can’t lie, but seeing the positive reaction for the most part made me feel like she was the right pick, i love a lot about her music and it pains me that it’s probably not the easiest thing for her to do but god i want to see more of it happening soon, she has so much potential and i hope people in the industry put some respect in her name!

**iniekcja\_** (9.667): I have no idea why I've never heard this project in full before. I knew some Quay Dash tracks and they never really grabbed my attention but after giving it a listen I started appreciating them much, much more.

**xavieryes** (9.333): Fucking SLAYS

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.067): Quay Dash is a motherfuckin STAR

**fairytalehigh** (9.044): quay is MAD underrated and one of my favorites of the past few years. there's an effortless confidence she exudes, listening to this EP makes me feel unfuckwithable. so glad for people to be introduced to her via this rate!

**roseisonlineagain** (9.022): only one of these i don't have any previous experience with, still pretty sick

**xxipil0ts** (8.878): - I was so surprised that I have a lot of 10's in this album! How did I not know about her till now?!

**2dina3dworld** (8.778): there’s not a lot I can say about this one. It’s very much a “boss bitch energy” song without being “girlboss, gaslight, gatekeep” and I like that stuff, but like sometimes things aren’t that deep. Sometimes they bop and that’s it.

**uncreativivity** (8.700): gonna be honest the scores here might be a bit lower because I probably haven’t listened through these as much as I have the rest

**akanewasright** (8.667): Quay is gonna get positively screwed this rate and I’m NOT here for it

**fadedblue09** (8.611): Probably the least experimental of the four projects, but it's still easily my favorite. She exudes personality on every track while striking a balance between accessibility and left-fieldness.

**skargardin~~~~** (8.222): This is such a solid body of work, I would be curious to hear what Quay could do on a full-length project, hopefully we get some new music from her soon, let this rate manifest it!

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.111): As unfortunate as the other songs not being on streaming, that shouldn't dissuade those from listening to this. Solid rapping from beginning to end.

**jman457** (8.011): This had bops even if it wasnt that “expiremental” but it got my ass shaking

**welcome2thejam** (8.000): Some real queen shit! Not as experimental as the others, but that's not a negative in any way. Solid beats, a consistently good listen

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.833): pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed this as i'd never heard of quay before this rate

**zenits** (7.556): ngl i didn't realise this album has gotten so popular. good for her, there is definitely some good bangers on here

**waluigiest** (7.556): She is a talented and meticulous rapper, which is why it’s such a shame the production on Transphobic can’t keep up with her. I’m really optimistic for her future because of the loose singles. They are INCREDIBLE and show off astronomical potential.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.411): for an ep this has a lot of filler and none of the tracks actually on the ep really even stand out, all the best things here are the loosies

**vayyiqra** (7.333): Well, whatever I was expecting from this album, it wasn't this. I thought it'd be a lot more experimental as the least well-known (I think?) artist in the rate, and more electronic and less hip-hop. Still though a good project, not really my kind of music but I have gained a lot of respect for Quay after reading about her difficult early life and she has talent for sure. I didn't mind this, it's kind of a fun listen.

**starla\_** (7.044): Average 7. Love her flow but some of the songs suffer from bad production choices. Shades on Top Down absolutely goes off.

**cremeebrulee** (7.022): it's really funny to go from some of the songs on hopelessness to these tracks i'm ngl dkfjskdf

**IIIHenryIII** (6.444): It has some really good beats.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.833): im gonna be completely honest with you. this ep sounds so cheaply produced. im not gonna put the blame on quay dash for this because it’s obvious beyond her control but as a result it doesnt give her much to work with and as such theres almost nothing in this thats worth going back to. the fact that every single song that isnt part if the ep is miles better than the ep itself and the best song in her discography is a song that isnt even on streaming is a real kick in the head as well. can’t say ill be revisiting any song from her in the future, which is a shame, i was honestly expecting to enjoy her music more

**pig-serpent** (4.722): The production is very good and it's a shame that it was wasted on a project this in need of interesting song writing.

**plastichaxan** (10): this song i got obsessed with as soon as i heard it, i just had never heard something quite like it and literally was the stepping point to make my music taste what it is nowadays, i owe sophie and this song so much not only as a music fan but as a person in general

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Genuinely did not expect a song about facial feminization surgery (among other things) to ever get to #2 in a popheads rate. Congrats y’all for putting an extremely fucking trans song so high.

---

**2dina3dworld** (11): I know I should have some great comment about this,,, but like it scratches a nice itch in the brain and that’s why I like it. No deep attachment or whatever, just brain off, bop on.

**akanewasright** (11): So this song and Ponyboy are innately tied together for me, because they’re both like… this kind of abrasive. But I think I prefer this one, because like… hmm… I feel like more is done in this song to express the message of it. Like I hear this and I viscerally feel what’s being sung about, even if I’m not trans and don’t even plan on ever getting plastic surgery of any kind. Plus… that bridge is just chefs kiss

**dondurmaya** (11): One of the my favourite songs, a perfect piece of poetry.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Yeah this is one of her best songs. If I somehow like this song, you did something right

**pig-serpent** (11): I don't think there will ever be another song like this.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): I joined popheads a few months before this released, and I had just gotten into Pop 2 not long before, so I was vageuly aware that Sophie was involved with that project, and when I saw the fresh thread I'd figure I'd check out this song. I was not prepared for what i was about to see and hear. The video with the face being squashed, inflated, chopped up etc. was incredibly captivating yet disturbing, the song was so much harsher, brutal and intense than anything I'd ever heard before. I couldn't really tell you I was enjoying it, but I was intrigued. Then... then the bridge came... and it was one of the most beautiful things I'd ever heard. The gently twinkling sparkly synth in the background, cecile's killer vocals and the absolutely devastating lyrics "reduce me to nothingness". It felt magical, tragic and haunting all at once, i knew then and there i loved that section. However... there was the rest of the track to contend with. I didn't really like it, but i was so obssessed with the bridge that I looped the song anyway. At first I was just manually rewinding to the bridge when it was over and looping that bit each time for a while, but eventually i got to lazy and just let the whole track loop. And with each loop, i began to appreciate the harshness of the song more and more, it was becoming cathartic, powerful and even catchy. Cut to many many many streams later, this is one of my favourite songs of all time, it introduced me to the world of hyperpop and so many of my favourite songs and artists, and still stands as one of the most truly innovative and important songs of the decade, it's a no brainer for my 11

**wavingwolves** (11): i'm obsessed with this i can't explain but there's something about the concept of this song that is so intensely appealing like... yes i want a new face right now

**BaconShoes** (10): who is doing it like this????? A legendary song

**bbfan132** (10): this production is a+++++++ tier

**celladonn** (10): I'm disintegrating

**cremeebrulee** (10): if only i had a third 11

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ok but is her face the front of shop i didn't catch that?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Vanity the most yaass sin tbh!

**daybed** (10): so glad this is somewhat trending on tiktok

**fairytalehigh** (10): i use this song to introduce SOPHIE to friends. it's an unforgettable statement, from its music video to its terrifying beats. on the right sound system it's like reality ripping at the seams.

**hikkaru** (10): i remember this was one of the first sophie tracks i heard and definitely was a bit out of my wheelhouse at the time of my ~musical journey~, but it really struck me then how incredibly catchy this song is despite the hook being made up of those grating synths, clanging sounds, and hard-to-discern low vocals

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the truest song ever

**iniekcja\_** (10): now this was probably the track that made me fall down the pcmusichyperpopbubblegumbassaltelectronic rabbit hole

**jman457** (10): Music video alone makes this score deserving

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): was almost gonna give this my 11 but...

**mudkip1** (10): this is one of the best songs in her discography. it's genius and i've still never heard anything like it before

**seanderlust** (10): this song goes hard but can the mv please not be uh....Like That

**seedub192** (10): that one meme with the orangutan on the tricycle

**sirpancakeXI** (10): MY FACE IS THE FRONT OF SHOP

**Stryxen** (10): she enunciates the p. in shop. so clearly we love clear and confident presentation skills

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): you never do forget your first sophie song

**thedoctordances1940** (10): There's just no better demonstration of her production than this

**throwaway-7650** (10): mozart could NEVER (his sister ~~outlived~~ ended him)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Twitter ruined me because now I can't think of this song without thinking of that one tweet of Kathy Griffin.

**UselessTacooo** (10): the rightful face of yassification

**vayyiqra** (10): Great song! Horrifying video! I have a deep-seated fear of warped faces! But great song! Love it!

**waluigiest** (10): I have the feral need to be drunk off my ass dancing to this at a basement party

**zenits** (10): this is the song that made me first love sophie. i would legitimately call this an 11/10 if the rate allowed me to say that about two songs

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): me every few months deciding i need a new nose eventually

**lady\_sable** (9.5): ideal mental breakdown song

**Awkward\_King** (9): omg her face is the front of shop

**Uberpigeon** (9): i will be controversial yet brave and say that faceshopping and ponyboy too similar.. like they are bangers for sure but i feel it detracts to have two songs with the same "gimmick" right after one another

**welcome2thejam** (9): Shoutout the Plastic Love/Faceshopping mashup for getting this an extra point

**whizzer0** (9): thanks to that one ContraPoints video this was the song that convinced me to listen to SOPHIE's solo album (I knew her via Let's Eat Grandma but I wasn't sure at first)

**flavasavavandal** (8): I’d score it higher but I’m 99% sure I’ve been Stockholmed into liking this by people on Beatsense more than I actually do

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Damn I’m looking back at old Jukebox comments about these songs and [wow SOPHIE was really polarizing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/82m07d/the_popheads_jukebox_week_56_maybe_janelle_will/dvb49r0/) Who can blame us though because this shit is really out there. I feel like this is a bit less pop-friendly than “Ponyboy” was but is a bit more successful at accomplishing what it wants, so your mileage just kinda varies on how much you’re into what that is. I think I’m on the side of liking it, the harsh industrial sound coupled with the sardonic lyrics that tackle beauty and gender works for me.

**skargardin~~~~** (8): It took me a real while to fully get into this track, but then again this was one of my first exposures to SOPHIE or anything remotely hyperpop

**TiltControls** (8): some of the production gets a little grating by the end imo, but still a great track overall

**frogaranaman** (7): how many people are gonna comment something about "yassification"

**CrimsonROSET** (5): shoutouts to that one contrapoints video

**1998tweety** (3): its grown on me a bit but still not the biggest fan

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This winning was basically never in doubt as results came in. And it’s a great winner! It might be one of my favorite pop songs ever. I think it’s actually helped by how synthetic, artificial, and plasticy it is. Sometimes, when more mainstream pop stars try to make emotional songs, it ends up sounding hollow. But by intentionally making this bubblegum and kitsch, it actually heightens the contents of the song. The verse feels like a very straightforward explanation of dysphoria, and the bridge delivers the biggest lesson of transitioning - you *can* be anything you want. Nothing has to stop you. And that’s a great thing to remind us of in the middle of a fucking bop.

**plastichaxan** (10): this really never moved from the #1 spot once it hit it omg, i love to see it, yes, maybe it is a predictable winner, and i can see why, especially since it’s the most popheads friendly song in the entire rate, but god does this deserve its high average and all the praise, this is just happiness in song form i can’t describe it otherwise

---

**1998tweety** (11): BOP there are a few odd bits but besides that this song (especially the chorus) goes OFF

**BaconShoes** (11): this song also took on a different context for me after her passing. It makes me a bit emotional sometimes, but it’s also so euphoric and makes me want to throw ass

**celladonn** (11): What can I even say, this song is lifechanging. Absolutely euphoric.

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): despite loving a lot of other songs in this rate, the second it was announced there was no other option. this song is like, the most musically pure form of catharsis and euphoria - a total celebration of the self. it's so bittersweet listening to it now when Sophie herself no longer shares this world with us, but it serves as a reminder to embrace every part of me while im here. after all, i can be anything i want and that's something i'll cherish until the day i'm immaterial as well.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): I talked about before how I’m not much into experimental, I don’t usually go much out of my comfort zone. This? This is perfect for me. It’s still much more than normal songs, but it doesn’t throw anything that shouldn’t be there- it looks like every element is thought about fully.

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this song gets me hyped like no other i've almost committed vehicular theyslaughter multiple times because of this chorus. when the beat kicks in is honestly one of the most euphoric moments ever in pop music. this is the definition of pop perfection

**hikkaru** (11): the most basic 11 choice for sure but sophie's style of saccharine pop is something i'll never be able to get enough of. those synth stabs ahh

**IIIHenryIII** (11): if happiness had a voice, I believe it'd sound like this

**lady\_sable** (11): songs to transcend your mortal form to

**mudkip1** (11): BOP BOP BOPPITY GIRLS BOP BOP BOPPITY BOYS

**rickikardashian** (11): stil thinking about the person that called this yassified gospel, they hit the nail in the head

**seedub192** (11): this song dominates my internal monologue

**slimboyfriend** (11): this is the sound of queer trauma morphing into queer freedom, celebration, irreverence, liberation, and joy and I’m so happy that it’s the song that Sophie and her art will most be remembered by

**waluigiest** (11): This song is pure euphoria. There’s something so infectious about the joy that fuels it. It takes a more traditional pop sound than a lot of the album and exaggerates it close to parody.

**welcome2thejam** (11): Everyone said this was probably gonna win, and yeah, this is definitely catnip to the popheads (and to me)

**xavieryes** (11): Choosing an 11 in this rate was extremely hard because of the raw amount of talent involved but this song is just... I don't know, it's inexplicable.

**zenits** (11): in a large set of incredible music that means a lot to me, the boppiest of bops still wins out in the end

**akanewasright** (10): oh look it’s the smasha

**Awkward\_King** (10): she deserves the world

**bbfan132** (10): love how sugary this song is

**cremeebrulee** (10): if only i had a fourth 11

**daybed** (10): invented boys and girls

**dondurmaya** (10): timeless bussy bopper x 😳

**fairytalehigh** (10): in 2018, SOPHIE appeared in a random bar in my town, for reasons i don't understand. she had her titty out, she played some CRAZY ass tunes, including green velvet's "la la land," "girls night out," a bonkers rap song i've yet to ID, and "immaterial." being introduced to "immaterial" in that setting was life-changing. what else is there to say.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop what else can I say

**iniekcja\_** (10): gay

**Leixander** (10): instant serotonin boost

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of the most life-affirming pieces of music ever teabh

**nt96** (10): Did she just yassify gospel?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): a very predictable, but correct winner. It's immaculate.

**roseisonlineagain** (10): we are all we've got left for ourselves in the world

**sarcasticsobs** (10): IDM (immaculate dance music)

**seanderlust** (10): a full philosophical take on what it means to exist in a bright bubblegummy bop

**sirpancakeXI** (10): it will probably win the rate and im fine with it

**skargardin~~~~** (10): it's the smasha

**Uberpigeon** (10): this song makes me what to snap my spine in half to the beat of it and it would be worth it

**UselessTacooo** (10): tbh this is probably the objective best song in the rate, but I couldn’t rob my personal favourite from my 11. Nonetheless when this wins I won’t complain

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah I know, basic take, fun uptempo bop good. But this is a very good song idc! Gets you pumped and makes you think about how gender binaries are constructed! Pretty awesome.

**wavingwolves** (10): if this wins i won't be mad at all!

**whizzer0** (10): I can't really listen to this without crying anymore, not that I could before

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): The crown jewel of pop music

**fadedblue09** (9): There are parts that I couldn't vibe with, but otherwise a stellar song

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The yassification of the Freddie Fish soundtrack

**pig-serpent** (9): This is the obvious rate winner right?

**TiltControls** (9): the anti-madonna

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this is cute,,, but I don’t see myself coming back to it but I did bop to it so…

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Is it just me or does this sound like it could be a k-pop song? But it's such a bop though.

**Stryxen** (8.4): not my fav on ooepui and there are many songs i would rather win but its not even worth wasting breath arguing - this is an amazing song. just there’s a couple things that stop me from loving this like a lot of people (all) do

**jman457** (8.2): Catchy AF but wish there was more here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i’ve never understood why this one is so hyped up by others. yeah the chorus is really fun and catchy but the verses are so mediocre, especially the second one that has an absolutely AWFUL autotune effect on sophie’s voice and the production is among her most generic and boring. if this was by a different less experimental artist i mightve enjoyed it more

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): i1\/1material (pretend 1\/1 = m)? more like 1/2-i1\/1material

 i can’t begin to explain how much this album changed my life in a lot of ways, every song just has a special place in my heart for different reasons and occasions and it fills my heart to have made it possible to rate this and see that other people had such a good experience with this album. i miss SOPHIE every single day and i believe there will not be a day where i don’t miss such a talent, such a bright and beautiful person

**zenits** (10.111): in 10-20-50 years, this will be in the conversation for one of the most important works of art ever been released. if i ever learn how to write about music well, i want to write a several thousand word essay about just how fucking much this album means to me

**dondurmaya** (10.111): This album changed my life forever and have been a dear friend of mine that's always there when I'm in need.

**xavieryes** (10.000): A masterpiece made by one of the most innovative and revolutionary musicians to ever live.

**roseisonlineagain** (10.000): perfect record that now just makes me cry a lot, even moreso than i used to

**xxipil0ts** (9.878): - God I miss her so fucking much. What an incredible album!

**pheromenos** (9.789): favorite album of all time

**akanewasright** (9.778): this is basically what I consider a perfect album. There is one song here I don’t wholeheartedly adore with all my being, and I still like it and consider it an essential part of the album. Every other song here? Perfect. May Sophie Rest In Peace

**Alumineous** (9.556): I was surprised to like this album because I dislike hyperpop. Sophie is like one of the figureheads of the whole thing and I didn't know if I was gonna be able to get through it. I'm just so surprised, I love this album. I now understand. We really lost an icon, a pioneer, a legend.

**iniekcja\_** (9.556): where do I even fucking begin. Sophie was a trailblazer, she opened doors for so many new artists to come through and transformed electronic music in a way that hadn't happened in many years. On a more personal note, this "realm" created with this album feels to me like a physical place that I did pass through and came out as a different, better person. Sophie remains one of the two artists that were the most important in my journey through life so far. Rest in peace angel

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.533): SOPHIE was a treasure, her influence is beyond comprehension. Rest well angel~

**fairytalehigh** (9.444): a goddamn masterpiece. in the past 12 months a day has not gone by that i haven't thought about SOPHIE or this album. rest easy, SOPHIE.

**starla\_** (9.433): Average 9.4. I didn't discover this album until 2 years after it came out and holy fuck was I missing out. SOPHIE was a once in a generation talent. I still can't quite believe she's gone.

**Leixander** (9.056): when i first rated this album in 2018 i gave it a 6.5... my taste changed since then

**sarcasticsobs** (9.033): I get insanely sad if I think too much about SOPHIE and what a loss it was. There was so much she was going to do and it was going to be so special.

**celladonn** (9.000): You know, I think this might be the most important album of the past five years, SOPHIE really changed the game here. I miss her so much.

**waluigiest** (8.889): I don’t have anything new to say about how incredible this album is. I came into this rate with an open mind (and liked the other projects!) but this is just in a league of its own.

**pig-serpent** (8.833): Instant classic when it was released. I really hoped the other albums here I hadn't heard before would compete with it but this album is truly a whole other level.

**skargardin~~~~** (8.778): It's pretty much impossible for me to not think about what SOPHIE's future work would have brought while listening to this album.

**vayyiqra** (8.667): I'm so glad that at last I get this album. For the longest time I thought it was overhyped and just kind of okay, a little too abrasive, maybe a bit pretentious. Wrong! It is the opposite of pretentious, because it is incredibly sincere. Sophie just wanted to show us her true self, and that's what she did. I won't write any essays here because I think that's more for her bigger stans to say, who she meant more to on a personal level. But I do like the themes on this album of self-expression and authenticity and the futuristic, almost cyberpunk vibes as well. Sophie was an incredibly talented musician and we're lucky we got to hear her music. Now that she's gone, it's sad of course, but I try to think about how much she did with her life and how important she was. Idk I'm rambling and I'll stop but the point is I understand now why so many here loved her.

**cremeebrulee** (8.478): gone way, way too soon. rest in peace sophie.

**jman457** (8.244): The quintessential hyperpop artist and project. Truly a trailblazer for pop music

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.222): just so so good...i've always liked this album and yet still wasn't expecting to give majority of the songs 10s. but here we are!

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.222): It's a good album until the last two songs, songs I feel saved the record from being just good. This could have been something SOPHIE would have improved upon had she not passed and she was just getting there. May she rest.

**welcome2thejam** (8.111): I believe the hype

**2dina3dworld** (8.000): it’s hard to say anything that wouldn’t have been said before. But like,,, this is a nice album. I can see why it’s the blueprint, and there’s a sense of unbridled optimism present in this album that is now bittersweet to listen to. Rest in love, SOPHIE

**IIIHenryIII** (7.578): It truly is a remarkable and innovative piece of art.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.556): i know my score for this album may seem relatively low, but i do truly think this is an amazing record and is far more then the sum of its parts. even though there are tracks on this that i dont really like and would never listen to on their own, when listening to them with the rest of the album, everything fits in to place and makes perfect sense. you can’t just listen to one track without wanting to hear the rest of them, they just don’t sound right without each other. rest in peace sophie, i wish i would’ve appreciated your work more while you were still with us.

**fadedblue09** (7.278): I like the themes presented in this album and the most songs are memorable enough while sounding unique. Overall, I think the album has a consistent atmosphere and vibe but some tracks are underwhelming on their own.

**TiltControls** (6.611): Almost every song I either really enjoyed or could not stand. Still - when Sophie's on point she blows it out of the water quality-wise

#**Albums**

- OOEPUI becomes the 5th highest rated album on the sub! It's only beaten by TPAB, Hounds of Love, MBDTF, and WYP

- OOEPUI  also takes 2nd place for highest 11 dominance across albums. It took 61.0% of the 11s in the rate. (Only Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is ahead of it)

#**Rate**

~~No new records for today~~, but overall TWOE becomes the rate with the 20th highest average.

Ignore that! TWOE actually takes a record for becoming the 4th rate where everyone used their 11! It shares this distinction with Charity 1, Pet Sounds vs. Abbey Road vs. Rumours, and She's So Unusual vs. Madonna vs. Forever Your Girl vs. Whitney Houston
