Unreleased Songs Rate Reveal - Nothing On (But This Reveal)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ztptfv/unreleased_songs_rate_reveal_nothing_on_but_this/

Let's dive right in:

* [78](https://pastebin.com/PSgGNWi4) people braved the inconsistent YouTube links to send in their ballots!
* The average score was a **6.823!** Pretty decent for songs that that their own artists largely disliked for one reason or another!
* The average controversy score (standard deviation) was a **2.506,** making this the second most controversial rate of all time! Oh no!
* a MAJOR record is broken by a song in this rate! tune in to see what!

I feel like after the Watch Me Work fiasco of 2016 that any random Tinashe song was labeled a Rih-ject but after listening to this yeah it absolutely was lmfao. It's very much in the Major Lazer lane of the mid-2010s, and I could've seen it as a later single from Anti; that said, I don't think the hook and drop are quite strong enough for it to have been a hit. And clearly y'all agreed by rating it last for the duration of the rate!

---

**throwaway-7650** (10): this would be such a good CLC song... like

**TiltControls** (9): We're that much closer to having the full 24 hour rate

**1998tweety** (8): more like 8am

**CrimsonROSET** (8): vote for 333caprimami for better tinashe songs

**CritneySpearz** (8): a bop except the chorus beat is awful D:

**plastichaxan** (7.8): Cling clang scratches my brain

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): The hook to this is actually super catchy imo, but Calvin’s production isn’t his greatest so I see why this got passed on even if I actually enjoy it more than I maybe should

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Tinashe is great here but Calvin kind of flopped here with his production

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): there’s definitely a demo intended for rihanna of this somewhere

**pig-serpent** (7): This drop is so unlike Calvin Harris (ie it's good)

**indie\_fan\_** (6.8): not bad, but i feel like there's definitely quite a bit of nashe unreleased songs better than this

**seanderlust** (6.5): this reminds me of that one cirque du soleil song from the cyberpunk 2077 soundtrack (and the VGV rate) but like...not as good

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): maybe we do need the charli/tinashe EAPR-style leak rate, because the songs we picked for the two of them are really not their best…

**bespectacIed** (6): That limp af chorus doesn't deserve that BANGER of a pre-chorus. I still wanna hear a polished official version though, this has potential

**imbaby122** (6): that beat drop is horrifically 2012

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): With a bit of modern reworking, this could actually be a decent smash

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): the bass in the drop is doing the Ankha dance

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): This song is really reminding me that Calvin Harris adopted his stage name because he thought it sounded more “racially ambiguous” and wanted people to be unsure if he was black or not.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I thought this was pitched up Rihanna until like halfway through the song

**akanewasright** (5): I’d call the drop dated, but I don’t think this ever would’ve been received well

**frogaranaman** (5): that drop went nowhere

**oscarbrierley1** (5): of all the hundreds of leaked tinashe songs we had to pick the badly aged tropical edm song of course. She has so many other leaked songs that I prefer.

**shipperondeck** (5): help she looks so young in that promo image

**wasian-invasion** (5): isnt she from kentucky

**welcome2thejam** (5): I fear I set my expectations too high for this

**Awkward\_King** (4): of all the tinashe leaks....

**bogo** (4): what is this phone ringtone drop

**celladonn** (4): don't really love the drop here

**DaHumanTorch** (4): tinashe has over 200 unreleased songs and 95% are better than this, what on earth were y'all on when voting

**daythreeinmiami** (4): Tinashe slayed the verse but holy shit that drop is NOT IT. What ever that freaking noise is, it's going to be ringing in my damn ears in my sleep. This song went in a direction that was so bad. It was so good up until the drop. This song had so much potential. I'm mad.

**jordannimz** (4): I love both Calvin and Tinashe, and while her vocals sound great, this song just isn’t that good imo. The lyrics are kinda cringy and this might be one of the most underwhelming EDM drops I’ve heard.

**ricki** (4): i was gonna say this sounds unpolished and too rough to ever have been released, and then i remembered it wasnt

**vayyiqra** (4): This isn't as bad as you all made it seem but also I'm not predisposed to like Calvin Harris for several reasons and this is also not good either.

**blanketbaker** (3.5): sounds pretty unpolished ngl, like a fruityloops default backing track "5am and I want you babe" hook sounds like it's badly translated, kind of shoved in there

**AHSWeeknd** (3): Any relation to Halsey’s 3AM?

**apatel27** (3): This would mildly hype up a festival crowd

**FlavaSavaVandal** (3): it’s the kind of song someone would tell me to slut drop to, to get it

**iadoreyouranus** (3): not really a drop, more of a plop

**impla77** (3): This is quite tepid

**RandomHypnotica** (3): what the fuck is this disgustingly cheap drop

**Stryxen** (3): the drop i'm crying. i can't be too mean it's a little funny and i had fun

**MassiveThief** (2): that drop is incredibly annoying

**MrSwearword** (2): it's five o'clock and it's boring, the production and vocals are snoring

**fadedblue09** (1.5): god awful beat drop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): this has to be a joke right??? i refuse to believe that even in an unreleased state like this a song can sound THIS cheap and incomplete, one of the worst choruses ive ever heard good grief

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Thank you Tinashe. For releasing so many bops, making one of the best albums of 2021, and not releasing this.

**bloodjet** (0): i hate the drop so fucking much

**hikk** (0): doesn't tinashe have like an actual treasure trove of unreleased tracks

**musical\_pyn** (0): this is tolerable up until the chorus and then it just completely falls part

**runaway3212** (0): Calvin Harris should go back to getting taylor swift cowrites

**sufjancaesar** (0): Why does this sound so unimaginably dated

**wavingwolves** (0): this is certainly from a certain period in time and it shows in a way that isn't very pleasant to me to say the least

I'm pretty sure a released version would have more bombast but I think it works well enough as is! The guitar sound gives me a heavy Eyes Open vibe which is one of my favorite Taylor songs. Unsurprisingly, however, the Swifties did NOT bother to turn out for this rate to support it, and as such it bombs even harder than most expected. Hopefully Midnights gets the same treatment next year!

---

**1998tweety** (10): BOP we need this on SN TV

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Oh heck off Taylor this a beautiful song. It does have similarities to 'You're not Sorry' and I also love that song. I wonder what era this is from because I need a damn vault version of this. Taylor pls.

**MrSwearword** (10): I didn't expect to like this, but how the shit did god awful trash like "ME!", You Need to Slag Off and all but the three Aaron Dessner songs on Midnights see release?

**throwaway-7650** (10): WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD, IN YOUR HEAD, Z-

**SweetSummerAir** (9): I really wish she makes an album full of songs like this, only better. Think of an album with this along with Eyes Open

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this would be the end credit music for a very mid video game

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Let's Go (Battle) is way too extreme for what this song is. The song itself is good but it's disappointing that this is just another Taylor Swift song instead of an epic Pokemon battle song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): she really has been writing songs about being the victim her whole career, huh

**imbaby122** (7): this is so disney channel original movie core

**jordannimz** (7): The chorus harmonies are heavenly!

**welcome2thejam** (7): Screw this, I wanted an actual Taylor Swift fighting theme. That title had me wanting some intense Street Fighter theme song type shit

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): Looking forward to this song’s two-week stay in the top 40 on billboard amid an album bomb during a future rerecord

**impla77** (6.3): I’m confused what arena they’re fighting in

**bloodjet** (6): teen me would've ate this up i think. present day me, not so much

**CrimsonROSET** (6): pokemon

**LesApfels** (6): I kinda gaslighted myself into thinking this was better while in the throngs of my initial swiftie fandom

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): This is very clearly a rough demo but again, if this had some beefed up production it could've definitely worked as an Avril Lavigne track or something.

**Roxieloxie** (6): i dont super care for this but i've hated so much of this rate that i cannot give it anything less than a 6

**slimboyfriend** (6): That chorus is so GOOD but everything is so NOT!

**akanewasright** (5.7): This deserved to not get released, but it’s not horrible. The vocals are rough and there’s nothing too special about the lyrics but it’s okay

**FlavaSavaVandal** (5.5): me when i'm cheering for one of the characters in wrong turn 2

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): taylor does the cranberries??? Its not her worst song, but it doesn't stand out and is kinda boring.

**wavingwolves** (5.5): i would've loved this if i heard it when i was 13 for sure. but i didn't. so

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Oh this was during her country days

**cremeebrulee** (5): tilt mentioning that this is the only taylor eligible for all stars FLOORED me... have we rly not rated any new taylor since folklore lmao

**fadedblue09** (5): she was in her Pokemon OST bag

**iadoreyouranus** (5): it's cute

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I once played an ATRL game called Diversity and the point was to show how diverse your chosen artist was by choosing a song to fit a certain category each round. The worse 3 songs would have to go into an extra round where they choose another song for a different category and the best of the 3 moves on and the other two are eliminated. Anyways, my artist was Taylor Swift and the category for round 2 was “unreleased songs” and I sent this song because i honestly couldn’t be bothered to actually look up unreleased taylor songs. I was promptly put in the bottom 3 with Carrie Underwood and Demi Lovato. The category to survive was “Best Live Performance” so basically this game was RIGGED for me to lose from the beginning! But Carrie didn’t submit in time luckily and I chose Taylor’s All Too Well performance (you know the one) and Demi sent in some performance at I believe the latin grammy’s? and I still got eliminated, so again I was SET UP TO FAIL BY PRODUCTION but also this song is kinda ass.

**TiltControls** (5): why does the title sound like it's a track for a Pokemon game

**MassiveThief** (4.5): pretty boring. also the opening guitar part is literally The Cranberries - Zombie

**blanketbaker** (4): it's a song

**musical\_pyn** (4): I can see a world where this works but that is not this world

**runaway3212** (4): this is better than I remembered

**vayyiqra** (4): Not to be reflexively :fucktaylor: but I do not like early Taylor much and found this kind of dull

**just\_thonking** (3.5): this sounds like one of those original songs performed at a high school talent show

**celladonn** (3): the way the guitar sounds here is pretty grating on my ears

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): "listenable" barely

**apatel27** (2): Taylor used Fly. It's super effective!

**RandomHypnotica** (2): i feel like this is such a strange title even before the Let’s Go games were announced

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): Come on now. She HAS to have a better unreleased song than this…

**frogaranaman** (1): this song title is upsetting to me as a survivor of the great ticketmaster wars of 2022

**Stryxen** (1): are you gonna go or what why is this still playing omfg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): the title made me expect a pokemon song but instead i got one of the worst songs ive ever heard

**bespectacIed** (0): awful vocals fighting for her life, bland instrumentation and lyrics, song is a big ball of nothing. why was this shoehorned in this rate, she doesn't need to be everywhereeee, g-zuz criesdt

**bogo** (0): did we really need taylor in this rate, this sounds like shit

**DaHumanTorch** (0): why is she strumming that guitar so violently what did it do to her???

**plastichaxan** (0): At least she made the 0 easier to choose

**shipperondeck** (0): ma'am that is a pokemon theme title

**static\_int\_husp** (0): this one should stay in the vault bestie

**wasian-invasion** (0): I physically cannot listen to this

Windows Down was already a huge guilty pleasure for its early 2010s electrotrash, and this version just makes it even electrotrashier. I can see why she didn't release this because it's a bit basic even by her standards, but I'd take this over her lesser singles like Blow anyday.

---

**hikk** (10): warrior is such a good album and this would fit so well on it idgaf.. big time rush also ate this up a bit why lie

**throwaway-7650** (10): the bridge is camp, y'all wouldn't get it. ahead of its time

**turtle-thief** (10): Before charli, Ke$ha was the og party pop girl with banger unreleasead tracks. Meet Me in Space is amazing as well.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this is big time rush’s vengeance for what you did to them in the disney/nick rate

**wavingwolves** (9): i haven't raised anyone yet actually so it must be other wolves

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): still great but no one beats Logan's one part

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): This would've been a SMASH if it was actually released as a single. I'm assuming the Blur guys refused to clear the sample or something?

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): the prechorus belongs on a totally different song but this is classic Kesha, gotta love it. Also want to appreciate the 2011 lyric video for this

**1998tweety** (8): she ate this

**celladonn** (8): it pains me to say this but I think the chorus in the big time rush version goes a little harder

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): you’ll never be Big Time Rush but fortunately you are Kesha

**jordannimz** (8): The verses and chorus go hard af but I just can’t get behind that pre chorus and ESPECIALLY that bridge. Would be a 10 if not for those bits :/

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Why do I feel like Damien Albarran blocked this from being released because he was disgusted by it 💀

**CrimsonROSET** (7): why are there just random halellujahs thrown in there

**ImADudeDuh** (7): giving this +2 because the idea of this actually being released as a single would make 2010s music bros spontaneously combust and I support that

**slimboyfriend** (7): could also be a Miley Cyrus Bangerz-era cut

**SweetSummerAir** (7): It's a decent song but far from one of her best unreleased material. Shots on the Hood of My Car or Run Devil Run would have been amazing here

**welcome2thejam** (7): Help wait I know I've heard electropop Song 2 from somewhere EDIT: Big Time Rush!?

**imbaby122** (6.7): ke$ha you’re not gonna get anywhere trying to tag team bert and ernie. they are NOT interested.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): this song is terrible, but very fun. I like it slightly less every time I listen to it. Her accent throughout is confusing, she sounds like jenna marbles' impression of her dogs in parts. The sample is very chaotic. The hallelujah bridge was a choice.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): parts of this are great but other parts... oof

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): damn there needs to be a german word for being oddly nostalgic for extremely abrasive & crazy music from the early 2010s

**bespectacIed** (6): fun chorus but limp verses

**plastichaxan** (6): Ate BTR up

**seanderlust** (6): okay besides the VERY dated drop (and even for the time the drop would have sucked) this slaps...but boy that drop is hard to ignore

**akanewasright** (5.9): I can’t lie I was gonna give this a 10 after the first verse, but the the parts of the song that aren’t the verses or the drop are kinda lame

**blanketbaker** (5.5): Lots of good pieces here, the quieter bridge instrumentation and build up of synths at the end fuck. Sounds unfinished in that the pieces don't really mesh.

**iadoreyouranus** (5): a perfect musical time capsule

**MrSwearword** (5): if the only issue with a Kesha song of this time is a misguided sample usage over something badly written, that was progress.

**runaway3212** (5): this is actually not even that bad

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): big time rush ended

**DaHumanTorch** (4): this sample is so annoying

**just\_thonking** (4): Song 2 sweetie I'm so sorry

**LesApfels** (4): Stream Elevate by Big Time Rush

**pig-serpent** (4): Um, excuse me, Bert and Ernie would never! They're too busy being gay!

**jackisboredtoday** (3.9): the way there’s basically no transition into the hook the parts just slam into each other with no cohesion

**bloodjet** (3): what in the song 2 abomination is this

**bogo** (3): never put the image of kesha having a threesome with bert and ernie into my mind ever again

**daythreeinmiami** (3): THIS ISN'T BIG TIME RUSH I AM SHOOKETH. The production is exactly the same with even some of the same adlibs that even sounds like Logan. WAIT HANG ON WAIT THIS WHOLE TIME, that IS NOT Logan Henderson going 'PARTY PEOPLE'? Any who the Big Time Rush version is better lel.

**shipperondeck** (3): bert and ernie...

**Awkward\_King** (2): quality was so low in 2010 ultimate this wouldve made day 2

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): PLEASE I know voting this in was sabotage to lower Kesha’s average. So twisted.

**AHSWeeknd** (1): I’m sure she has better unreleased material, why did y’all put this here??

**frogaranaman** (1): this is.. bad

**Roxieloxie** (1): disgusting

**Stryxen** (1): and FUCK blur the only good damon albarn sample here is on pop culture

**TiltControls** (1): the first song to get banned from sims radio for being too sexually explicit

**vayyiqra** (1): I am old enough to remember the video for "Song 2" being played on TV and this is incredibly bizarre and sounds like a fan-made YouTube mashup. What am I supposed to even do with this. Nvm it's a really cheap use of a sample as a ready-made hook (à la Ava Max) and it's bad. What the hell was that Hallelujah chorus doing there. This is dogshit.

**impla77** (0): This does make me feel like I do at parties.. violently uncomfortable

**RandomHypnotica** (0): how many times are we going to have to teach you this lesson old man.jpg

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): drop. hallelujah. that's when I ascended to heaven. by that I meant I died. Let alone Blur, the Big Time Rush version was better.

PrimaryCrusaders: Somehow I thought the song would stay unreleased but after reading these comments I was very surprised to find out that BTR picked it up (I probably shouldn't be that surprised really - it definitely fits their sound).

The only song in the rate we've rated before, thanks to an old Charity Rate submission. Anything from the Born to Die era is incredibly refreshing compared to whatever she's been putting out recently, and this almost feels like a greatest hits mashup of that album with its hi-hats, cherry cola references, and jumpy background vocals.

---

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m surprised Taylor Swift hasn’t taken this yet

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is seriously one of her best songs how did she not release this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): look i submitted this to charity 2 and 11’d it once i can’t do it again

**throwaway-7650** (10): me after I deal with all the lana 0s

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): unfortunately good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I know this is gonna get like four thousand zeros but I’m sorry it does kinda slay.

**imbaby122** (9): where would lana be today if cherry coke never existed?

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.3): god would I have eaten this up in like 2014

**jordannimz** (8): I really love Lana’s voice over a hip-hop-inspired instrumental!

**plastichaxan** (8): I’m sorry besties I hope you all do what I couldn’t (tank her songs)

**wasian-invasion** (8): yep this sure is a song by lana del rey

**wavingwolves** (7.1): this is fine but she has much better unreleased outtakes...

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): How is this a better Lorde song than the actual Lorde song in this rate /hj

**TiltControls** (7): I know this rate was asking to have 2 lana songs, but I kind of wish it wasn't one we already rated before - even if it is solid

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this is also cringe but I’m bopping a bit more

**bespectacIed** (6): It's a bop kinda. Off to The Races' less pretty sibling

**bloodjet** (6): insert jughead i'm a weirdo speech

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I miss when Lana would do dolphin impressions in the background of her songs.

**iadoreyouranus** (6): i actually like her hip-hop inspired sound sometimes

**just\_thonking** (6): this would've fit right in on Born to Die (not a compliment)

**impla77** (5.6): female manipulator gone wrong

**blanketbaker** (5.5): chill slow dance pop song

**oscarbrierley1** (5): I've never really understood the hype for this song. The production is so boring and sounded dated even when it first got leaked.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.7): then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt

**bogo** (4): god i forgot how unbearably bananies and avocadies lana's vocals were early in her career

**pig-serpent** (4): This reeks of someone writing a song, then a producer saying it won't be a hit with the kids unless they add an unfitting, dancey drumbeat over it that ruins everything that the song was trying to do in the first place.

**slimboyfriend** (4): I think BTD Lana should stay dead

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): that cola had its own story arc huh

**welcome2thejam** (4): We let gaslight gatekeep girlboss go too far

**ImADudeDuh** (3): shoutout to the lyric video that spelled ignite “Ignight”

**daythreeinmiami** (2.5): This song is confused. She's trying to find herself. It's the awkward phase. It's Tumblr overdone. It just does not need that heavy 808 beat at all.

**runaway3212** (2): live or die deserved

**shipperondeck** (2): this is straight up unfinished

**Awkward\_King** (1): can we rerate born to die so i can be horrible to it

**MrSwearword** (1): simply put, no

**vayyiqra** (1): One time years ago I listened to all of Lana's unreleased material in one evening and this song was one of the things that convinced me it wasn't worth bothering with it again. This is a mess of a song that's trying to do way too many things at once (it somehow sounds like a Born to Die, Paradise, Ultraviolence and Lust for Life reject at the same time) with awful lyrics and it's just aggravating.

**akanewasright** (0): thank God this sucks JDJDBHE

**CrimsonROSET** (0): its understandable he never released this, i wouldn’t either

**frogaranaman** (0): true crime podcast listeners

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): no ❤️

I've almost never been impressed by Twigs' music and this is not an exception. The "[something something] hurt like this" hook is decent but the rest is just generic minimalist trap pop. And even then my favorite Twigs song is Holy Terrain so I know she can do good with that sound anyways!

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): Who’d 🤔 hurt me 😵 in a 🫦 world 🌍 like this?!??! 😫😫 YOOOUUU!! 👈👈👈😜😜😜 Hurt me 🤕in a world 🌍 like this!!!! 🌒🤠 You’re dead 💀🤕😵when I 🙋‍♀️ Say So (feat. Nicki Minaj) 💃🕺.

**nootnoot781** (10): so she can put a 30 second outro on pamplemousse of a fan talking about this song but she can’t release it in full… okay

**plastichaxan** (10): She was so annoyed at gays asking her to release this song she put it in a song but like this is the one time I understand those annoying gays

**RandomHypnotica** (10): stream pamplemousse

**akanewasright** (9.5): yeah this rules, needs to be a bit longer but I see why the twink on pamplemousse was so upset

**wavingwolves** (9.5): the world wasn't ready

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): i love pamplemousse

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): This sounds a bit unfinished but I still like it!

**1998tweety** (8): girl where was this on Caprisongs

**Awkward\_King** (8): did twigs write this about matty healy bc he's more in love with himself than anyone else

**imbaby122** (8): bro i need both of them carnally but why was this recorded in 1920

**jordannimz** (8): Their voices sound really beautiful together and I love the drumbeat.

**Stryxen** (8): her making the fan complaining about this not being released on pamplemousse a man with a lisp, she knew what she was doing

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is interesting?? It feels incomplete though which is understandable

**seanderlust** (7.5): this is the song that one bottom was freaking out over on CAPRISONGS? :/

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): i didn't notice dua help

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): the whole studio 2054 virtual tour thing was such a specific covid-era adaptation it feels so uniquely 2020

**DaHumanTorch** (7): the random gay in pamplemousse spilled this deserved to be finished and released the 10 potential is there

**ImADudeDuh** (7): dua definitely did not need to be here

**runaway3212** (7): this is fine I guess

**bespectacIed** (6): Aww, they'll never be Beyoncé, and that's ok. I was gagged for like a second, but then calmed down, cus this was mid as hell. These bri'ish royalties deserved a better collab, try again!

**blanketbaker** (6): The whispery vocals are memorable. The beat is about as cookie cutter as it gets. The range on the vocals keeps the song interesting, contrasted with the dull beat. Ending is a miss, the switch-up was impactful the first time and tired by the second.

**MrSwearword** (6): it tried something but I ended up being underwhelmed if not merely whelmed.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Not as strong of a pairing as I'd hoped

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): well it’s definitely unfinished

**frogaranaman** (5): this is 100% a demo

**vayyiqra** (5): How many unreleased songs with Dua are there that I've never heard of before. anyway this was good until the last ~40 seconds.

**pig-serpent** (4.5): The sultry vibe is good at the begging, but I don't think the yelling at the end fits, and the beat gets boring over the course of the 2 minute song. Great start, pretty bad ending.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): ‘All this aron piper commotion.. this is definitely coming out soon ✅’ hope you’re doing well xox

**impla77** (4): because you keep whispering at me!

**LesApfels** (4): The ending sounds like a seizure

**MassiveThief** (4): idk why twigs is singin like that but I do not enjoy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): i don't get why people were hyping this up as a legendary collab, it doesn't sound good to my ears sorry

**Roxieloxie** (4): i really wished i liked this more than i ended up

**TiltControls** (4): this title almost feels accusatory with the score I'm giving it

**shipperondeck** (3.9): oh how i wish this was good

**iadoreyouranus** (3): not for me but i see the appeal ig

**oscarbrierley1** (3): it sounds really low budget, like a royalty free song someone would play in a youtube video

**daythreeinmiami** (2): I was NOT ready for the sudden ASMR I hate ASMR no thank you I'm okay.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): its bad enough i had to go on soundcloud to listen to this but the fact that its also bad? are you TRYING to mock me

**bogo** (1): because you sound terrible

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I wish you all could have seen my face while this was playing because it said more than I could ever type

**throwaway-7650** (1): this just doesn't work at all

Her vocals and enunciation are weird on this but I think the electronic power ballad production works really well with Gaga. Nothing here is radically different for her but I think if it were on Born This Way or Artpop it would've made day 2 in their respective rates.

---

**MrSwearword** (11): this should've been on ARTPOP instead of Gypsy and I'm still delulu enough to wish this becomes the lead single of ARTPOP Act II as an official release. I love the song that much.

**1998tweety** (10): MOTHER, we needed this near the end of Artpop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the only reason I watched Rocky 4 was because I was obsessed with this song. Rocky 1 and 2 still remain superior.

**centralsouthsnack** (10): Mother behavior with this song. Almost on par with Addison Rae’s music.

**jordannimz** (10): Honestly of the prettiest Gaga songs ever :’) ARTPOP Act II when???

**runaway3212** (10): maybe gaga's unreleased vault is worth the hype

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): God this song makes me cry about my old friends even though I hate them now

**plastichaxan** (9.5): She never released ARTPOP ACT 2 because it would’ve been the most powerful thing in the world and we didn’t deserve that much

**bloodjet** (9): damn this song feels so nostalgic even tho i've never heard it before

**imbaby122** (9): justice for artpop i say, shaking in fear, with a little monster holding a gun to my head

**seanderlust** (9): That bridge…that was fighting for gay rights…people were killed

**TiltControls** (8.5): why wasnt ronnie included in clat

**MassiveThief** (7): I wish the quality were better, but still good. The dubsteppy parts did not age well but the writing hits.

**shipperondeck** (6.7): could be an early 2010s english vocaloid song

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): glad this didn’t make ARTPOP it doesn’t fit and it’s very mid

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): that chorus SLAPS and then the verses are like…..

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): BUT I'M A CREEP... I'M A WEIRDO... WHAT T-

**DaHumanTorch** (6.3): cake like lady gaga sweetie i'm so sorry

**iadoreyouranus** (6): a beautiful song but a bit overrated for me

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): I really assumed I was gonna like this more since Gaga does have a ton of classics, but this is shockingly forgettable

**wasian-invasion** (5.5): thank gaga this didn’t make it onto artpop

**akanewasright** (5): …huh! We voted this in over the better version of nothing on huh!

**CrimsonROSET** (5): she’s fine

**frogaranaman** (5): this production is aggressively 2013

**bespectacIed** (4): not interesting enough, not mad this was scrapped

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Oh god there is some Hold My Hand DNA in this. Not a good thing.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Maybe it’s just the upload but something is up with the pacing of this one, it sounds weirdly slow. It’s like the song is trying to move through syrup.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): is this supposed to sound like it was made on garageband

**welcome2thejam** (4): A few fun quirks like a Rocky IV reference, but IDK feels a bit generic otherwise, like sure it's a Gaga song but anyone could've made this

**wavingwolves** (3.5): was this a moment? yeah... was i there? yeah... do i care for this? no...

**bogo** (3): my god this is so fucking boring

**fadedblue09** (3): oh this totally fits on ARTPOP alright, a poorly produced mess like most of that album

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Brooke Lynn Nytes?

**vayyiqra** (3): As a longtime Artpop fan and apologist, this really isn't good and if this is the most hyped track from its outtakes, we don't need them. So boring, can't believe this almost replaced "Mary Jane Holland".

**blanketbaker** (2.5): feels like it was put together by an AI

**cremeebrulee** (2): i was so bored 2

**pig-serpent** (2): Gaga's singing is nice, but this is one of the worst ballads I've heard in a while. Given how bad the ballads that get released are, it doesn't surprise me that this is how bad one has to be to get cut.

**RandomHypnotica** (2): why does gaga sound so phoned in and unenthusiastic on this track

**Stryxen** (2): lame

**daythreeinmiami** (1): I'm bored. So I want to use this moment to start a petition or a PSA for Confessions of a Shopaholic album to be put back on to Spotify as I would very much like to listen to 'Fashion' by Lady Gaga again. Please and Thankyou and Happy Holidays.

I feel like the central metaphor here works on paper but it feels awkward when put into song like this. It bops mildly regardless but I don't know why so many Marina stans clamor for its release when I feel like she's done this type of song so many times before on her first three albums.

**imbaby122** (11): very much biased bc i heard her play this live in 2019 but this song changed every molecule in my body, every fiber of my being, every chemical in my brain. i am who i am today because of this song (mentally ill synth-pop enjoyer).

**indie\_fan\_** (11): me after eating most of the enchiladas for Christmas

**rotating3Dtext** (11): bruh this straight up makes me sad for the new marina, I miss the froot era

**1998tweety** (10): not hungry anymore after how hard she ate this up

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ah yes one of the “I’m going to release it” unreleased songs

**runaway3212** (10): Me when I eat

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): "that FROOT looks familiar!" - EXID

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): me after i eat one piece of white bread

**bloodjet** (8): marina no longer poor

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The track clearly needs some polishing and the verses could be sharpened but I’m into the vibe already.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): me after sza gave us a 23 song album

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): yeah cause she just ATE (a little)

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): Marina…marina… is not Po-[GUNSHOT NOISES]

**impla77** (7.3): Fear I haven’t scored this highly enough to make a ‘bc she ate’ comment

**iadoreyouranus** (7): beautiful song, prefer the acoustic version

**MrSwearword** (7): cute, but not gorgeous

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): this is why you shouldn’t fill up on FROOT before dinner

**MassiveThief** (6.5): it's good... but like the most generic amalgamation of froot

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Ironically I don’t feel very fed.

**jordannimz** (6): It’s cute but not my fav MARINA song either.

**TiltControls** (6): you're not yourself when you're hungry

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): a lot of this era of marina just doesn’t click with me and listening to this one…. yeah it doesn’t work for me either. The lyrics feel blunt and I really don’t care for Marina’s vocal delivery throughout most of Froot era

**wavingwolves** (5.8): well you should be because you did not eat with this at all

**bogo** (5): the title is accurate because she did not eat here

**CrimsonROSET** (5): something something she fed idk this song isnt great

**frogaranaman** (5): marina after finally being able to afford a quarter pounder:

**musical\_pyn** (5): the more I listened to this the more I grew off it unfortunately

**welcome2thejam** (5): Kinda just there tbh

**DaHumanTorch** (4.5): surprised she isn't hungry since she didn't eat much here

**akanewasright** (4): damn… this sounds like a froot outtake (which it is)… But I love froot… I should like this….

**blanketbaker** (4): the two notes in the background get a bit annoying. combined with the vocal style it's just rather flat

**daythreeinmiami** (4): Well I am so I'm gonna make some food cause this song bored me.

**pig-serpent** (4): I kind of hate this, but it has a lot of potential and I've definitely caught myself singing along to it once or twice, so rating this lower would feel dishonest, even though I want to.

**Stryxen** (4): hmm you should probably eat

**apatel27** (3): You can't convince me this isn't a debut cut. It's so juvenile

**cremeebrulee** (3): i was so bored 3

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): wait this is not the interlude on Paramore's self-titled. Anyways the production on this sounds like a CRT TV orgasming

**vayyiqra** (3): Another "the cult around this one baffles me" song, kind of boring, will never get what's interesting about it. It's like an AI wrote an autogenerated Froot song so why listen to this instead of that album? When I saw Marina in 2019 she played this song and made a joke about how everyone knew the lyrics. Most of the crowd sang along and me and my friend just stood there awkwardly because neither of us knew it.

**bespectacIed** (2): marina after her shift in McD and eating the employee 50% discounted meal.... (yes this is a tired classist marina poor joke, sorry not sorry, also this song is meh)

**fadedblue09** (1): Marina's music is truly the embodiment of first world problems

**Awkward\_King** (0): other people are though marina, world hunger is still rampant, have you thought about that

This is fairly redundant with Kiwi and Only Angel but I still really like that sound from Harry. The queer discourse surrounding this is exhausting though, like I don't think the lyrics point to anything other than bicuriosity which I don't think Harry has tried to hide.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): i stand with roxie and creme and all the other depressed bisexual women i know

**cremeebrulee** (10): we are never rating fine line or HH so i almost thought about 11ing this

**frogaranaman** (10): I think it’s neat

**Roxieloxie** (10): listen if i dont support him no one will. Ill be honest im in the 2% of people who like anna over medicine but It dropping was such a moment and had a hold on us in 2018 fandom that i have to give it respect

**throwaway-7650** (10): when this has a better average than harry's house

**iadoreyouranus** (9): holy fuck nobody talk to me

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): good but it definitely has deep cut vibes

**imbaby122** (8.2): is this the most interesting harry styles has ever been? scratch that. this is the most interesting harry styles has ever been.

**1998tweety** (8): queer ICON

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Harry Styles stans would’ve been part of the “disco sucks” movement back in the late 70s

**just\_thonking** (8): this is a much more compelling sound from him tbh

**runaway3212** (8): a bop? from harry styles? It's more likely than you think

**Stryxen** (8): he slayed idgaf he earned a little queerbaiting rights

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): This sounds like classic Arctic Monkeys. I like it. Because I miss classic Arctic Monkeys. Alex come back. In all seriousness I could see this popping off in Australia.

**TiltControls** (7.5): i don't have a comment for this song, but it was the only one on my ballot without one and i need to fill space. it's solid

**akanewasright** (7): This is solid but I think it would go off more live

**CrimsonROSET** (7): you know how much queerbaiting discourse there'd be if this was released

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ......don’t hate it

**seanderlust** (7): harry i am trying my best to ignore the queerbaiting discourse and this is not helping

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): most interesting he's ever been

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): he doesn't sound like Harry Styles

**welcome2thejam** (7): Kinda here for Harry Styles doing solid alt rock radio filler

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): so this is what all the discourse stems from?? is it really worth it

**wavingwolves** (6.1): is the medicine he's talking about the gay cure

**hikk** (6): fishingrodemoji

**LesApfels** (6): Did they cut the bi line out?

**DaHumanTorch** (5.3): mediocre song by a mediocre artist

**bogo** (5): this is somehow the straightest song in the rate and it literally has a line about fucking men in it

**impla77** (5): I know some Harry stans will go feral for this and that makes me so confused

**jordannimz** (5): omg a bicon

**shipperondeck** (4.9): the lyrics are pretty weird (unsurprising coming from him) but otherwise it sounds nice. edit: nvm this is boring as hell

**blanketbaker** (4): Oh, men? Jazzy beginning gave me hope for something that wound up as a guitar metronome. Could do without it being recorded in a warehouse.

**oscarbrierley1** (4): something about the whispered "taste" makes me extremely uncomfortable. The rest of the song sounds like a million other songs.

**vayyiqra** (4): For a guy who is a font of so much Discourse this is quite a boring song.

**wasian-invasion** (4): i was so close to hitting skip on his "waaasted" falsetto but i stayed strong for the rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this is bad but its not any particularly worse than any of his other songs i guess

**apatel27** (2): Bad Indie Landfill

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Sorry but this is creepy, he skeeves me out so hard whenever he tries to be sexy. I feel like if you actually tried to have sex with him he’d say the weirdest stuff the whole time and you’d just have to smile and nod because if you told him you weren’t in the mood anymore he’d start crying.

**bespectacIed** (1): There's not even anything funny to say, I just hate this man's whole schtick so much, too bad my 0 is predetermined. Hate his springsteen dylan cosplay. You'll never be interesting or anything remotely remarkable, Harold

**MassiveThief** (1): I tried so hard to put my harry hate aside, but I could not. This sucks. Trying so hard for some REAL ROCK BABY and it does not go well.

**MrSwearword** (1): Harry makes me sick in general so this medicine is about as effective as Ivermectin.

**pig-serpent** (0): This is giving me PTSD to when my car didn't have an aux in the mid 2010s so I'd have to listen to alt radio and they'd be playing some mid song with no personalty from a band no one would ever hear from again that sounds exactly like this, but hey, at least it was better than listening to Fancy for the 600th time that week. I'm never going back.

I'm not surprised she went in a different direction for Solar Power because this just sounds like leftover elements from Melodrama mashed into a new song. Granted, Melodrama's excellence means this can only be so bad, but I did not find myself actively seeking this out even in the drolls of the Lorde drought. I was even prepared to make a joke about how she forgot to play this at my Melodrama tour stop but then I looked it up and she did play it, I just forgot about it completely.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Oh my God, I finally get why the Lorde-inatiors were obsessed with this song

**Awkward\_King** (10): lorde please never go back to making pussy music i cant handle having a single popular opinion

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Coming to be a beloved deep cut on Melodrama Act II.

**frogaranaman** (10): I am starving for this to be released officially

**RandomHypnotica** (10): lorde just needs to drop this and the gays will forgive solar power

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I love this song but it wouldn't really fit in with any of her albums, wish she'd just drop it as a loose single

**rotating3Dtext** (9): one more song in this style lorde pls

**seanderlust** (9): this would have been a standout from pure heroine, which is saying something because that album is already so great

**welcome2thejam** (9): I don't know if this is a song that would usually grab a 9, but in this rate boy is it a standout

**TiltControls** (8.5): the vocals are eh (though I imagine on a proper release they'd be much better), but that piano line is seriously hypnotic

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): I’m being kinder to this because I did see her play it on tour and that was a great moment

**ImADudeDuh** (8): and yet she chose to release Solar Power?

**musical\_pyn** (8): sway is the better unreleased lorde track from this period but I will take anything from the melodrama era

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Clearly unfinished, especially with the song not going anywhere, but there's a lot of wasted potential here. I could see a reworked and finished version of this song being an easy 10.

**impla77** (7.3): I guess she has seen a diamond in the flesh?

**blanketbaker** (7): just digging it

**bogo** (7): lorde dances like i do when i'm all alone in my room listening to music

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she’s cute

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The harmonising in this was enough to elevate me, see the light and fall back down. Very nice.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): would have been a middling track for Melodrama but that was such a strong album so that’s still pretty high praise

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it’s so rude when an artist performs a song they never released

**jordannimz** (7): This feels like a mix of the Pure Heroine and Melodrama sounds, and I really enjoy the chorus melody.

**bloodjet** (6.5): pretty good, feels unfinished tho

**akanewasright** (6): I kept waiting for this to explode and then it didn’t… i might’ve liked it more if I heard it in better quality, but this seemed like it was almost there but not quite

**bespectacIed** (6): Fun song. I would have scored higher if there was a studio version cuz lorde is such a mediocre live vocalist lmao. BTW, she should release the melodrama side B so we'll forget power failure ever happened

**iadoreyouranus** (6): it's cute

**wasian-invasion** (6): solar power didn’t get gold certified no need to worry about any precious metals

**MassiveThief** (5.5): egh. didn't think I could dislike a non-SP lorde song but this isn't hittin. her released catalog pre-2021 is still flawless tbh

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): interesting within the context of Melodrama, but not a good standalone song

**hikk** (5): melodrama is my fave album ever but if this would have been on a deluxe... i'm glad she kept it

**imbaby122** (5): this is royals but like 50% more tolerable and 100% more boring

**LesApfels** (5): Lyrical queen rhyming "fool" with "fool"

**ricki** (5): caribeña

**runaway3212** (5): her singing did not help

**vayyiqra** (5): Would like if we had a studio recording but sure it's okay! An overly repetitive but at least competently written song unlike the last few.

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): you got me looking for attentiooooooooooooon

**DaHumanTorch** (4): some things were scrapped for a reason !

**wavingwolves** (3.5): i saw lorde live recently and it was the best concert of my life... with that said she didn't play this during that concert so i'm sorry i can't care for it... as a youtube video it falls flat..

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): boring

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): is this hip hop

**fadedblue09** (2.5): why would you send a live vocal track from Lorde of all people

**apatel27** (2): This is so boring

**oscarbrierley1** (2): very boring

**MrSwearword** (1): this is "Royals" if the people that hated it were right

**Stryxen** (0): this is so boring and i have a strong irrational hatred for this i wish this never surfaced

This would be an above average Britney deep cut but it isn't quite distinctive enough to be single material. It certainly fits in with her image for the era and is mildly catchy but that's about it. 

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I wonder if the pope has ever heard this song

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Ohh this chorus goes HARD. This whole song goes hard! I'm so mad this was cut from this album and it took me 21 years to hear this. This is Y2K captured perfectly in a song.

**plastichaxan** (10): My biggest regret is not being a bigger Britney stan as a kid I would’ve been a much happier person

**shipperondeck** (10): i love songs with this vibe in the verses pls give recommendations

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): if the hook was a bit more polished this would be perfect

**1998tweety** (9): if making bops is a sin then yes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Yes: Thou shalt not withhold bops!

**imbaby122** (9): britney having a sexy christian guilt song is so ethel cain of her

**jordannimz** (9): I love the production on this track, and the chorus is super catchy.

**runaway3212** (9): britney always slays

**throwaway-7650** (9): Yes (Sincerely, Selenators)

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECbhhcDVAAAWOdC.jpg

**akanewasright** (8): yeah this is better than at least two or three cuts on the album this was made for lol

**seanderlust** (8): me at ten years old in confession when i said "crap"

**impla77** (7.9): I don’t think enough info is given to ascertain that

**DaHumanTorch** (7.8): this is good but of all the britney songs...

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): brinty

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): love the hook here. the rest of the song's nice too, but also feels kind of unfinished

**just\_thonking** (7.5): it's got that classic Britney sound

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): 10 year old me after searching boys kissing on google images

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): idk but you’re boring af

**CrimsonROSET** (6): idk it’s kinda boring? Dont know why this was picked over so much else

**TiltControls** (6): It started out strong, but then it just didn't really go anywhere interesting

**bogo** (5): give sinnerman your 11s in indieheads charity rate

**frogaranaman** (5): this song was written with the chorus in mind ONLY

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Chorus is great, she should have plucked it out and used it in a different song.

**iadoreyouranus** (5): serviceable but a bit corny for my taste

**Stryxen** (5): her vocals are so awkward dkfjdjh she sounds like she's in a play or something

**vayyiqra** (5): Googled if Britney is Catholic (doubtful) and finding out she was a Baptist (unsurprising) but converted to Catholicism in 2021 (?!) and then said she was an atheist a year later so she really speedran that huh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): some of the least interesting verses ive ever heard in a song

**blanketbaker** (4): catholic-pilled

**FlavaSavaVandal** (4): you did the sin of bad music

**MrSwearword** (3): out of all the unreleased Britney material to rate...anyway this song isn't good but has a concept.

**fadedblue09** (2.5): yes, and your sin is making me listen to this mess

**pig-serpent** (2.5): This is close to working but it's not coming together for me. I think a lot of it is because it's a demo, but I'm thinking maybe there was a reason this was cut.

**cremeebrulee** (1): i was so bored

This is definitely the type of boss bitch beat I like the most from SOPHIE, but I do think it's slightly underdeveloped as is. I think if the first segment of the song ran longer and brought in even more instrumental elements it would work perfectly as an album opener for this type of sound.

---

**seanderlust** (11): Bonito Generation sends its regards

**AHSWeeknd** (10): SOPHIE’s music will always be next level

**akanewasright** (10): the 0s for this are going to hell btw. Yes half of you are people I’d call friends, and what about it?

**bespectacIed** (10): The dissonance of pairing sarah's sweet voice with the brash production and lyrics, I love it so much. What a manic, epileptic, electrifying song. Queens of wealth distribution while not caring about air pollution and health hazards

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Sarah coming to be a two time rate winner? I would like to see it.

**cremeebrulee** (10): anti-kkb-speedrun people are valid but don’t act like this isn’t excellent

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this song is seriously so good inject this beat into my veins right now

**pig-serpent** (10): Dirty, gritty dance music that doesn't just throw together a bassline and some drums and call it a day. SOPHIE completely nailed the vibe of speeding away from the police and it's amazing that this was never released, along with tons of other great material she's said she had in her vault that will probably never see the light of day.

**plastichaxan** (10): God I miss her everyday there’s no song she ever did that I have ever disliked and it blows me away

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh god 2 different popheads tank magnets coming together on a banger time is limited i fear

**Stryxen** (10): when two queens crash cars into each other to maximise their joint slay

**wavingwolves** (10): oh yes. real music.

**shipperondeck** (9.5): I just wanna rob all the banks and burn rubber :D black leather gloves on the wheel i burn rubber :D

**imbaby122** (9.3): i’m convinced every pc music affiliated artist has an extensive record of speeding tickets, car crashes, and duis that have been hidden from the public with a lot of hush money.

**bloodjet** (9): b gay do crime

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): Sarah saying Burn Rubber is really weird. Still better than anything on Icarus

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): Ohhh this gives my big VYZEE energy

**Awkward\_King** (8): kkb x sophie is literally a wet dream

**jordannimz** (8): vroom vroom baby

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): Kero Kero in their crime era

**bogo** (7): sorry but hearing sarah say "i just wanna rob all the banks and burn rubber" in her cheery voice cracks me up i can't help it

**wasian-invasion** (7): I can respect it from a distance

**welcome2thejam** (7): I need photographic evidence if you want to convince me Sarah Bonito can drive

**daythreeinmiami** (6.5): I loved SOPHIE and her presence in the pop world is really missed. Her death is still one that hurts me.

**impla77** (6.2): I can’t say I buy into the Sarah committing grand theft auto storyline

**1998tweety** (6): this is not for me

**vayyiqra** (6): You cannot escape KKB evangelism. "Wait, it's all KKB?" "Always has been." No but while it'd be really funny for KKB to win with this and get restitution for how they kind of bombed in Cyberpop, there is a problem with this song which is that it's kind of annoying.

**CritneySpearz** (5): umm…

**frogaranaman** (5): it's just kinda there

**blanketbaker** (4.5): really basic for hyperpop, which isn't a bad thing in itself. the samples are interesting, but the song as a whole never really evolves into something interesting enough to match them. refrain doesn't make me want to overdose so it's not hard enough

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): if i have to hear sarah bonito’s voice in one more song this year i’ll snap

**throwaway-7650** (4): I need OOEPUI with sarah over cecile

**CrimsonROSET** (3): damn it whenever i think i’ve settled my opinion on kkb things come along and change it, they were bad for vgi then good for electropop then bad for 2018 indie then good for cyberpop and now i think they’re bad again!

**iadoreyouranus** (3): very underwhelming for sophie

**runaway3212** (2.2): poor man's vroom vroom

**MrSwearword** (1): how is this "Vroom Vroom" but somehow even worse?

**FlavaSavaVandal** (0): no more kkb in rates,im begging y’all

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): This song is less than two and a half minutes long yet I still can’t bring myself to finish it

**ignitethephoenix** (0): hyperpop production and KKB … my personal hell

**indie\_fan\_** (0): I'm very sorry, but no. this is just not at all my taste

**oscarbrierley1** (0): so grating, so repetitive. I think it's the repetitive synth line that turns me off

**ricki** (0): i never know what im in for anytime i play a sophie song

**TiltControls** (0): i'm not even going to do proper stats on who was the most common artist in rates this all stars cycle. i'm just going to write down sarah bonito and call it at that (also I just don't really like this track)

The mystery behind this song is more interesting that the song itself. It's pretty standard new wave fare but without a good hook and with this very sharp synth interspersed throughout that bothers my ears.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it’s just a-ha, chill.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Giving this a 10 for the mystique alone.

**MrSwearword** (10): it's nonsensical new-wave which slaps.

**shipperondeck** (10): the bohemian rhapsody youtube comment is killing me

**sufjancaesar** (10): 10d just for the lore tbh

**SweetSummerAir** (10): Giving it a 10 out of respect

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i still cant believe this song actually made the rate, i didn’t think popheads would be familiar with the story behind this legendary piece of lost media but i’m glad to see that others are just as intrigued by it as me! even without all the mystique behind it i just love how it sounds, im a big fan of post rock bands like depeche mode and this slots in so perfectly with the rest of the scene, i can’t wait for the day when the band and song title officially get uncovered and we can praise the people behind it for one of the most interesting stories in music history

**frogaranaman** (9): my favorite band is so indie that nobody in the world has ever been able to identify who they are

**just\_thonking** (9): it kinda sounds like a classic tbh

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): this makes me think of the HIMYM opening

**impla77** (8.3): The OG

**iadoreyouranus** (8): we need a chart reversal for this band once we find out who they are

**jordannimz** (8): m y s t e r i o u s j a m

**slimboyfriend** (8): for some reason I thought this song would sound spookier

**welcome2thejam** (8): Story reminds me of that Reply All episode about a guy trying to find a long lost song stuck in his head. Have to imagine there's thousands of songs like this forgotten in time

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the story is interesting behind this but like the song itself is meh

**runaway3212** (7): hope at the reveal we'll get like a video explaining what the deal with this song is

**Stryxen** (7): good song . better lore

**TiltControls** (7): I feel like the actual most mysterious song on the internet is probably some forum attachment named 86ad17feaac4290aba1.mp3 or something

**wasian-invasion** (7): it kind of bops but points off cause the synths in the back half feel like an alarm clock drilling its way into my skull

**wavingwolves** (6.8): even here oldheads appear... i have to give it to y'all... it's a cockroaches situation...

**LesApfels** (6.5): It's a vibe

**MassiveThief** (6.5): I need the lore... what is this...

**bloodjet** (6): ai generated 80s music

**DaHumanTorch** (6): +1 point for the lore

**pig-serpent** (6): Mid song mostly carried by being mysterious and decaying.

**vayyiqra** (6): The lore around this song kind of fascinates me and I've read about it but somehow have never heard it before. It's definitely "any song one might hear on the radio in the early 1980s" so we can see why it's been so hard to figure out what it is.

**akanewasright** (5): sure

**blanketbaker** (5): it's giving soviet anthem dad rock vibes. kind of generic despite the hype around it. it's a song I guess, but also features the only unintelligible vocals I've ever enjoyed

**celladonn** (5): the second this finished playing my laptop crashed

**CrimsonROSET** (5): is there a ? score i can give out

**daythreeinmiami** (5): Sure, pop off, we love a good mystery song. Kinda sounds like that song that goes 'Oh, I just died in your arms tonight, must have been something you said' etc. Ngl, it's a little spooky, I have spooky vibes from this song.

**throwaway-7650** (5): ?

**bogo** (4): should've stayed lost

**oscarbrierley1** (4): sounds like every other mid 80s rock song. There's probably hundreds of other songs with the same story, this one only became a thing because people were talking about it

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): Ngl, a little bit miffed that this made it in but none of my submissions did.

**Awkward\_King** (3): i think i like this but in a very repressed way

**ImADudeDuh** (3): indieheads coded

**imbaby122** (3): i love the lore but this genre is a jumpscare

**RandomHypnotica** (3): is this really unreleased if it played on the radio, like, this is released just uncredited

**bespectacIed** (1): i'm not in on the loop with this meme or reference or lore or whatever, so i simply don't care if this has any significance

**cremeebrulee** (0): ok

This is basically just the Disclosure/Initial Talk remix of any number of Kim songs but I think the sound works for her. It bops as is but a campier moment like a spoken word bridge or something would really elevate it.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Her label lets her release Slut Pop but not this…

**hikk** (10): french house my beloved

**iadoreyouranus** (10): pure 00's disco pop perfection

**MrSwearword** (10): this could've been a standalone single release instead of scrapped. It honest to god slaps.

**seanderlust** (10): .....sigh yeah no i can't in good faith tank this. yes i know the producer, yes i know paris' history i just....this bops so hard.

**SweetSummerAir** (10): RIP Problematique

**throwaway-7650** (10): ugh why does kim have to be so

**turtle-thief** (10): I hate that i love this. it's like a better Sweet Spot.

**welcome2thejam** (10): A true lesson in never judging a book by its cover: some of the strongest songs in this rate are coming from Kim Petras & Addison Rae

**1998tweety** (9): i must admit this bops

**DaHumanTorch** (9): this is unfortunately amazing

**jordannimz** (9): All she wants is to be out of popstar jail

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): unironically good idc

**RandomHypnotica** (9): i hate that this is actually great

**Stryxen** (9): why do the annoying rich white girl socialite unreleased discographies always slay, it's like a prophecy

**wavingwolves** (8.6): this sounds like a rupaul song

**LesApfels** (8.5): She could've cut Problématique and just used this as the title track to avoid all the (rightful) criticism

**cremeebrulee** (8): ugh it’s bopping a little

**daythreeinmiami** (8): this was the collab I needed. Just icons.

**just\_thonking** (8): wow kim petras really loves to name brands

**MassiveThief** (8): just what I want from Kim.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This one is sooooo cool. I love the french house vibes of this one. This would've smashed in the clubs!

**wasian-invasion** (8): lol listening to this song right after the thread about her unholy verse being so lazy and just listing brands, cant argue but its still a banger

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I can’t make this not bop and cater to my tastes I’m afraid. It is generic though but this style does suit her

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): bad people can make good music sometimes

**shipperondeck** (7): kinda sounds like a mashup but it's fun

**vayyiqra** (7): It is somehow cursed this combination of artists exists, yet also somehow unsurprising; and even more cursed is that I kind of like this

**blanketbaker** (6.5): pleasant and bubbly

**plastichaxan** (6.5): Paris release new music challenge

**ricki** (6.5): the best part of this is the outro where it sounds exactly like madeon - pop culture

**pig-serpent** (6): I could see Desired making this exact song except in Japanese.

**impla77** (5.5): Sounds like a nice girl :)

**Awkward\_King** (5): on a graph of "cunty yass song" and "problematic artists" im afraid this falls on the side of not being worth listening to

**fadedblue09** (5): the jokes truly write themselves wow

**imbaby122** (5): this is so dull. can we get ayesha x paris? they’re both weird republicans ayesha would get the vibe immediately

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): what an unnecessary outro

**TiltControls** (5): this is certainly a combo of artists

**jackisboredtoday** (4.1): this is lightweight even for kim. at least when she was first making trashy generic pop it came with indelible hooks. Good on her for collabing with her idol but this offers a passable (if generic) beat and essentially nothing else

**bogo** (4): both of these girls are awful people and i'm glad this never came out

**ImADudeDuh** (4): meh

**runaway3212** (3.5): two girlbosses maximizing their gaslight

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): it is 2022 can we please stop acting like paris hilton was a misunderstood gay icon

**frogaranaman** (3): algorithmically generated gay music

**bespectacIed** (2): dead wrong for the kesha and redacted back to back songs. Screw these two awful people too

**CrimsonROSET** (2): i don’t want it

**FlavaSavaVandal** (2): putting kim petras right after kesha is sick

**centralsouthsnack** (1): I’m ethically opposed to Kim Petra’s I’m sorry.

Her Lily Allen moment? It's easy to see why this went TikTok viral with its infectious hook, but it's also easy to see why Lana didn't release it: she feels a bit out of her element keeping up with something this high tempo, despite it sharing the same dreaminess as the rest of Lana's work.

---

**turtle-thief** (11): These verses are like crack to me, her voice is so sexy. It's only fair this gets my 11, this song has been with me for years and it still hits.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m glad she started screaming in songs again

**Awkward\_King** (10): i hate her i fucking hate her die die die

**celladonn** (10): one of her best songs honestly

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is children’s music, which unfortunately is my vibe.

**MrSwearword** (10): as much as this slaps, this is way too doo-wop positive and not textured and rich enough for Lana and I fully understand why this was never released properly.

**runaway3212** (10): the disaster is her never releasing this

**Stryxen** (10): she really is, a 10 just for the gift of prophecy she had in the studio that day

**throwaway-7650** (10): queen of tiktok

**wasian-invasion** (10): not ashamed to admit ive only ever heard this before from the tiktok audio with roman holiday

**1998tweety** (9): viral hit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Nearly 30 million views on this upload holy moly.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): its insane she never released this

**jordannimz** (9): This is so upbeat compared to her released songs???? But this is really fun

**musical\_pyn** (9): I totally get that this doesn't fit what lana does anymore but I would love an entire album of this

**ricki** (9): what would you know about feeling gangster lana?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): i get why Lana never released this, it doesn’t really fit into any of her projects, but I think it’s fine staying as an unreleased treat

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): the way this would've gone #1 if she released it when it went viral she truly does not give a fuck 😭

**impla77** (8): bet they’re a really obnoxious couple

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): the gangster line is cringe but we move on

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): She's cute! We love it. I wonder why Lana didn't release this? It had me bopping in my seat.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): this couldve been worse honestly

**akanewasright** (7): mad that I kinda like this

**iadoreyouranus** (7): tiktok overplayed this for me but i still love it

**MassiveThief** (7): It's pretty good, Lana was talented in this pop lane but it's not as impactful as what she would go on to do

**oscarbrierley1** (7): I like the verses much more than the chorus. I think it's just a little too cheery and almost nursery rhyme vibe.

**pig-serpent** (7): One of the catchier songs on the playlist but that instrumental is obnoxiously cheesey. What's with the fairy bells???

**welcome2thejam** (7): This sounds solid, but feels like a Lana wannabe, like a TikTok artist trying really hard for her aesthetic. Immediate points deducted for feeling gangsta

**shipperondeck** (6.8): this is still catchy but i dont know i just dont really like this era of lana anymore

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): trying to figure out if this chorus melody feels like i've heard it a million times because its from a different song or i just didn't know i had heard this before. either way it’s on par with early lana’s non-singles so it’s fine

**bogo** (6): lana should be banned from using the word "gangsta"

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i fear the tiktok sound from this is actually good and I thought it was a marina song

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): me when I first hit play: oh this is a fine song. me when it got to the chorus: oh no this is that i'm spinning song from tiktok aaaaaaahhhhhhh

**seanderlust** (6): oh man I forgot the pain of the era where lana insisted on making "gangsta" a part of her brand/aesthetic. it was a hard time to be a lana fan which is sort of like every other time to be a lana fan tbh

**indie\_fan\_** (5.8): why does the melody sound like it's meant for a nursery rhyme

**wavingwolves** (5.5): this is kinda bad but it's catchy and pleasant enough? i guess? who am i even asking? anyway...

**blanketbaker** (5): instrumentation is uncomfortably similar to royalty free how to music. Love Lana's voice, but it's completely dissonant with the backing track. I like what they tried to do with a music box like instrumental, but the drums kind of nix that

**rotating3Dtext** (5): gangsta...

**frogaranaman** (4): god this is annoying

**imbaby122** (4): i wanted to tank this bc something about lana del rey saying “gansta” makes me want to tear my hair out, but then she screamed at the end and that’s my weakness.

**TiltControls** (4): spinnin' like a ballerina

**apatel27** (3): all this melodrama and thirsting for some generic white dude

**ignitethephoenix** (3): well glad this wasn’t released! It’s very cringe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): wait help i didnt know that spinning like a ballerina part that went viral on tiktok was from this song, begrudgingly giving a couple points for that part but otherwise this is still a lana song so i will give no sympathy towards it

**vayyiqra** (2): Awful lyrics (we don't need to be reminded of her "gangster Nancy Sinatra" era) and it feels like she went for "Born to Die meets doo-wop" which is a cursed combo, and the ending makes my skin crawl.

**bespectacIed** (1): boring as shit and why the holiday production

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): this city pop ass music video is sending me

**slimboyfriend** (0): I’m so excited to hear Lana fans defend this one. I will say she does have quite the range to write something as bad as this and then something as incredible as NFR years later

There's been a lot of comments about this song's TikTok impact but, despite having an FYP that I'm afraid to open around my parents, I've never heard this on the app? As for the song itself, it leans more into the Crazy Frog side of hyperpop than I expected but you really can't go wrong with a Poison sample.

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): if ayesha erotica asked to do a line of coke off my dick and then shoot me out back i would acquire the gun for her and put my fingerprints all over it

**blanketbaker** (11): Punchy lyrics and an absolute bop. Never thought I'd break it down to "Everybody knows I shit."

**celladonn** (11): oh it's one of the best songs ever

**CrimsonROSET** (11): this would get me addicted to crack

**plastichaxan** (11): Lives were ruined lives were created lives were transformed the entire world shifted after this for better or worse

**RandomHypnotica** (11): https://rave.dj/0wXKwe_7zPmZ9A

**runaway3212** (11): LISTEN HONEY YOU'RE OVER

**shipperondeck** (11): i've heard every bit of this song through various tik toks

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): CUNT!

**akanewasright** (10): god this unhinged as fuck

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Lol at this being uploaded on a channel called “Dream Vibe Music.”

**centralsouthsnack** (10): Icon

**DaHumanTorch** (10): I COULD GIVE YOU BJORK BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'D UNDERSTAND IT

**musical\_pyn** (10): this >>>> bohemian rhapsody

**nootnoot781** (10): i’m giving this a 10 in the same way i’d give 1991 by azealia banks a 10

**Stryxen** (10): we need the hole janet bjork lindsay lohan rate

**SweetSummerAir** (10): A reset from an artist who was already "retired" by the time it blew up. An icon, a literal legend.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this song is like a 100 but she can't say Björk. That brings it down to an 11. Unfortunately I can't have two of those.

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'd 11 this if it had any chance of winning

**wasian-invasion** (10): every morning when I wake up I whisper to myself "everyone knows I shit bitch" and every night before I go to sleep i whisper "icon icon icon icon CUNT"

**bloodjet** (9): pop music as sonic weapon, we love to see it

**LesApfels** (9): "I could give you Björk but I don't think you'd understand it" is savant-level lyricism

**MassiveThief** (9): "I could give you Bjork but I don't think you'd understand it" is the serve of the century

**seanderlust** (9): a song built for a frenetic drag performance

**wavingwolves** (8.8): the impact this had... incomprehensible to all...

**imbaby122** (8.2): i could give you riddle but i don’t think you’d understand it - literal legend ft. björk

**cremeebrulee** (8.1): thinking about how having “ayesha erotica” in the all stars 4 edible songs pastebin made it contain “offensive content” and therefore unpublishable

**CritneySpearz** (8): queen of litter

**frogaranaman** (8): the way this song is like seven Tiktok trends

**ricki** (8): slayyyter has been trying her entire career to recreate the magic of this song

**slimboyfriend** (8): ok but she kinda is a literal legend in the way she just released a bunch of bangers and disappeared

**TiltControls** (8): took a bit to grow on me. I still don't really care for the production tbh but it's got so many fun lyrics that it's hard not to enjoy it

**welcome2thejam** (8): I sure messed up doing this rate with a headache huh

**1998tweety** (7.5): she has her moments

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the drag race tiktok edit makers are thanking god that katya did bjork on snatch game

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Holy fuck this is insane, the production is almost giving me M.I.A. vibes

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): this song is so obnoxious, I almost love it but something about it doesn't quite click for me.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): it’s so bad but it’s so good?? (Which basically defines TikTok music)

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): I mixed this up with That’s Hot when I was only seeing the titles before I listened and honestly That’s Hot is so much more iconic so realizing Literal Legend was this made it a letdown. Anyway I can acknowledge this is important to art and influential but also is really really hard-carried by the one bjork line

**bespectacIed** (5): Don't know why this was the ayesha song that semi-blew up. STAR, YUMMY, and HARDCORE ANAL BANGING were right there. This is too grating and basic for such an edgy artist

**ignitethephoenix** (5): why is the outro song on this YouTube video a bop

**jordannimz** (5): This one’s just ok imo, but I do really like the beat in the second verse.

**TheQueenofVultures** (5): The thanks for watching music caught me off guard

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): oh so this is the comedy queen of the season

**impla77** (2): Got an extra point for the Bjork line but I’m pretty sure everyone shits bitch

**bogo** (1): this sounds like a youtube poop

**FlavaSavaVandal** (1): it’s the type of song i would give a 1 before the due date and then regret it

**indie\_fan\_** (1): the Poison sample is humorous, but outside of that, I was in hell for a good 2+ minutes

**MrSwearword** (1): Legendary? Sounds more like legs and dairy

**apatel27** (0): There are two sides to hyperpop. One that pushes musical boundries and one that aims to be as loud and annoying as possible under the pretense of being experimental. This fits squarely into the latter.

**daythreeinmiami** (0): um...what in the bell biv devo posion is this?

**iadoreyouranus** (0): interrogation type beat

**just\_thonking** (0): shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up

**Roxieloxie** (0): i hated that so much

**vayyiqra** (0): Wish I could say it's a meme or post-good or camp or whatever other buzzword we're using today to justify liking garbage, but also it's really, really annoying. "Let them pee on me" ??? We didn't need that!

It's a bit on the nose for an artist on the slutty side of hyperpop to cover Gimme More, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't work. I'm not sure it really offers anything over the original (especially considering it sounds like it was just recorded over the original instrumental) but I bop everytime I listen to I can't give it a lower score than this.

---

**daythreeinmiami** (11): I'm going to say something so controversial but I actually love this a little bit more than the original. I can't help it. This is so well done. Slayyyter just fucking ATE this up. The lyrics are so iconic, her delivery is so sassy I just fucking love it. I think even Ms Britney Jean Herself would approve.

**akanewasright** (10): literally not a bar of this is wasted, SUCH a fun flip on the song

**Awkward\_King** (10): reparations for not rating troubled paradise

**DaHumanTorch** (10): OH ME OH MY! I'M THE SKINNIEST BITCH ALIVE

**hikk** (10): OH ME OH MY I'M THE SKINNIEST BITCH ALIVE IF I WANT IT I GET IIIIIIIIIIIT

**musical\_pyn** (10): yes the gimme more instrumental is doing a lot here but slayyyter is genuinely matching the energy of the song which is not at all easy

**oscarbrierley1** (10): there are so many bad britney covers that lose the spark that britney brings to them (see lewis capaldi cover of everytime). This is not one of them, she keeps the original spirit of the song but gives it a slayyyter twist

**seanderlust** (10): this song is singlehandedly driving the spike in consumer demand that is causing inflation and it is entirely worth it. gas is $6/gallon but i'm the skinniest bitch alive so i don't care

**Stryxen** (10): this file on the rate having a youtube outro in the recording i'm dying , when someone tanks it for that

**throwaway-7650** (10): (shocking not a PopCrave reply) ended lil' kim

**turtle-thief** (10): The lyric video with edits from Scream Queens and Anime is top tier.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Props to her for actually doing something with the original, like it’s not too different but the verses give me a reason to listen to this rather than just the Britney version.

**jordannimz** (9): I love Slayyyter’s backing vocals in the last chorus so much!

**MassiveThief** (9): she ATE. her music is so indebted to Britney that it's no suprise she can devour a Britney remix.

**runaway3212** (9): the orginal is perfect and this isn't but who cares about perfect when you can slay like this

**shipperondeck** (9): wait whaaaat i didn't know the existed. slay

**imbaby122** (8.8): slayyyter is a genius and i’m not afraid to say it!!!

**sufjancaesar** (8.5): nogues

**1998tweety** (8): this bops but britney sweetie....

**ignitethephoenix** (8): don’t care for slayyyter’s part but like gimme more production is such a bop I can’t even hate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): yeah sure whatever its a pussy popper

**TiltControls** (7.5): the biggest problem with this song is in the back of mind i'm thinking 'i could just be listening to britney's gimme more right now'

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): was this not released because she couldn’t get britneys signoff lol

**wavingwolves** (7.2): looking camp in the eye

**AHSWeeknd** (7): why is this good

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this is less a remix and more just a cover

**ricki** (7): YOU WILL NEVER BE AYESHA

**welcome2thejam** (7): The immediate "Oh no" I just did from hearing the intro

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): I mean it’s boppy but how much of that is the song being good vs how much is it that even an inferior version of something as good as Gimme More is still boppy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I mean the base song is of course so good but this is just kind of a remix?

**bloodjet** (6.5): this isn't bad but the og is too iconic i fear

**bespectacIed** (6): you know what... i'm not mad. it's silly, it's camp, it's lighthearted. it's an unserious homage, fan to idol. You alright weird girl

**frogaranaman** (6): the fact that there's a St Louis rep line in this is sending me. toasted ravs REPRESENT

**bogo** (5): all she did was make the song worse

**iadoreyouranus** (5): her new lyrics go off but i'll always prefer the original

**nootnoot781** (5): is it a good song or is it just the gimme more production?

**RandomHypnotica** (5): i am probably one of the biggest slayyyter defenders here, but this remix has always fell flat for me, it feels excessively on the nose, her voice doesn’t feel like it gels nicely with the instrumental, and the verses flow just feels so… off

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): why are all the comments fatphobic like what did I miss

**vayyiqra** (5): When I saw Slayyyter live, my friend kind of lost her mind over her and how accurate her 90s Britney pastiche was. While we must respect her commitment to the bit, this is kind of "a little too on the nose", don't you think? Like Weezer's cover of "Africa", which is really pretty alright, but also why listen to it when the original is right there.

**blanketbaker** (3): Dissonance added to the song is interesting, chorus instrumentation sounds a bit dental commercial ambient, vocals and ghostly supporting vocals sounds like they were ripped from a halloween track and pasted on as a match up. definitely unpolished

**CrimsonROSET** (3): the only things i enjoyed were the original

**pig-serpent** (1.5): "Oh Me Oh My?" is this what Rina meant when she said "Gimme more?"

**FlavaSavaVandal** (1): a song that makes me question whether slayyyter actually likes Britney Spears’ music

**MrSwearword** (1): "All around the world, shitty girls...trashy tracks can't sing a note...crappy raps I doubt she wrote...they're just so 'Brinty'. All these wannabes, wanna piece of me. Try to dance, fall on the floor. That's enough DON'T Gimme More. They're just so shitty!"

**fadedblue09** (0): If I had a nickel for everytime I gave Gimme More a 0 in a rate hosted by u/TragicKingdom1, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice

the way he had MJ ambitions from the start and then backed up to the House of Balloons sound for fun. This would probably fit as a later track on Starboy but I don't imagine it becomes a fan favorite ahead of the other upbeat songs from the back half of that album.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Noise EP is proof he’s always been a main Pop boy.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this absolutely fucks

**CrimsonROSET** (10): see this is how yo do it

**jordannimz** (10): Such a classic early Abel sound, with such a fun groove. Love the harmonies in the post-chorus!

**imbaby122** (9.7): how about we just leave the throwbacks to the weeknd he just always does it better.

**indie\_fan\_** (9.7): It's funny to me how people say that they prefer old r&b weekend and don't like the new pop stuff when he been doing pop since before House Of Balloons. Anyway, the only gripe I have with this song is that autotuned part during the bridge, but everything else I love. The Noise EP is made of a bunch of lackluster or below average leaked songs, but this is definitely one of the better tracks for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): wouldn’t be mad if this won

**runaway3212** (9): yass abel

**TiltControls** (9): Abel sounds good as always, but shoutout to the stellar production and guitarwork on the track

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): did not realize this is what pre-HOB abel sounded like … feels like something he would drop now

**wavingwolves** (8.7): so you're telling me they want you to do IT? the clown? damn

**shipperondeck** (8.6): now where was the magic of the last 30 seconds throughout the rest of the song

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this has good quality

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the autotune is so unnecessary but this does bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Cannot believe this is what he sounded like in 2009, this sounds so fresh to this day

**RandomHypnotica** (8): ok chloe x halle

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): this is like proto Starboy title track

**wasian-invasion** (8): how does abel sound like 3 different alternate dimension versions of his current self on this

**welcome2thejam** (8): Not liking how much his voice is in my ear at the end

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is cute, you can tell it’s not him at his best, but there’s some fun stuff here

**frogaranaman** (7): Chloe x Halle????

**impla77** (6.8): I guess many artists go through their MJ impersonation era

**MassiveThief** (6.5): feels like an AI generated trilogy song

**oscarbrierley1** (6): it's missing the edge that all of his actually releases have had. It sounds just kind of regular

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i think he wants us to do it

**vayyiqra** (6): Ladies and gentlemen, the Weeknd, I guess

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): I like The Weeknd a LOT, he’s one of my most listened artists of all time, but its very obvious that this was made before he’d figured out his sound. It’s real generic compared to his early material and the autotune late in the song is SO bad

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): he really did do it why is this production so busy

**LesApfels** (5.5): I wish more of the song was like the last 30 seconds

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): yeah I see why this never got released. those vocals...

**blanketbaker** (5): almost a good club song, ending after the "little cousin rap breakdown" is vibes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This definitely sounds like a Trilogy C Side.

**daythreeinmiami** (5): It was groovy I guess. I don't really follow Abel that much so I'm neither here nor there on it.

**iadoreyouranus** (5): fun throwback song but i can't get over the production

**MrSwearword** (5): a fabulous production but his vocals are shit on this.

**bespectacIed** (4): justin timberlake-coded production and delivery. Not good enough sorry, abel u are above this

**pig-serpent** (4): I like how weird a bright and fun song sounds in The Weeknd's early style. I liked this a lot at first, but the more I listen to it the more I find it annoying.

**bogo** (2): why does the weeknd sound so awful on this

**Stryxen** (2): there's so much happening and i'm so MAD at this point in the playlist im crying

**seanderlust** (0): do you want me to do it? do you want me to do it? do you want me to do it? do you want me to do it? do you want me to do it? do you want me to do it? d

Whoever is doing the accounting at Addison's label needs to be fired because why would you pay for a top tier Lady Gaga demo and shelve it like this? Anyways, I think this is better than the Gaga version because it feels less ironic coming from Addison, and you really need to lean into a song with this cheeky of a title.

---

**FlavaSavaVandal** (11): imagine how powerful she is to make the greatest song of all time and then just not release it

**1998tweety** (10): wtf is this pop perfection [2]

**AHSWeeknd** (10): So happy to know that Little Monsters may never see Gaga release this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Gaga’s leftovers take better than some of her main course…

**centralsouthsnack** (10): Ended Fadga for real for real. A BOP.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this kinda washed gaga's version sorry gay people

**hikk** (10): no bc she's a GENIUS for buying this off of gaga, it's literally such terminally online gay pophead bait for her yass & slay half-ironic princess of pop image, but she's absolutely evil for not releasing it and also just not continuing her music career at all despite the hype

**jordannimz** (10): Gaga's version is literally my fav unreleased song and if it was her version it would be my 11. I don't love the few lyrical changes, but let's be real, Addison still bodied this track!

**MassiveThief** (10): main pop girl

**plastichaxan** (10): FADga is over Addison is MOTHER now purrr

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if only your SONGS were released and on the radio addison

**ricki** (10): In every way possible, I think Gaga’s version is superior, but the move to snatch this demo for Addison is genuinely one of the best executive decision any management team has ever taken and for that I have to give props

**Stryxen** (10): genuinely genius how many layers of performance art she's serving here

**SweetSummerAir** (10): Gaga should be proud

**runaway3212** (9.5): she really gagged the gays with this one

**wavingwolves** (9.1): as someone who has been a fan of gaga's (paws up) for more than half of their life i have to say... this version still gives and everyone else who says it doesn't is a liar sorry

**oscarbrierley1** (9): she kinda ate gaga up ngl

**fadedblue09** (8.5): why does this random tiktoker have the best songs in the rate

**imbaby122** (8.5): i’m gonna go back in time and tell gaga about this and see how she reacts

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): I do think there’s something funny about Addison getting this into the rate as a second song when there’s only one Gaga song that made the cut

**akanewasright** (8): This should be Gaga’s version but I’ll take it

**daythreeinmiami** (8): How is this not an actual single released by Miss Rae? I love this! The production is so nostalgic to me and has a real y2K vibe to it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like the bones of this but her limits as a vocalist hold it back, plus it’s too short

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I feel like this definitely works better with her than it would have with Gaga, like it seems just too light and simple for Gaga

**ImADudeDuh** (8): wait, NOTHING on? But that means... she and this boy are... oh my god. Thank god this filth wasn’t released to the public

**vayyiqra** (8): Being basic again as a "vaguely 80s synthpop enjoyer" and you can't stop me.

**wasian-invasion** (8): im calling cause im a jew

**bespectacIed** (7): this on the other hand.... i hear something!!! cute. very mid 2000s slut pop

**CrimsonROSET** (7): yeah this is a gaga cut

**iadoreyouranus** (7): fierce camp fun but i am a little monster

**throwaway-7650** (7): damn. (넌 뭐가 그리 잘나서/내-)

**welcome2thejam** (7): Obsessed was like fumbling the football 80+ yards backwards on first down so her next play was 2nd & 93, but these past two songs are tossing up two solid long passes to just get back into field goal range and come away with a respectable yet miraculous three points on the board

**impla77** (6.8): Feel like the radio could kill the mood when the ads come on

**shipperondeck** (6.5): kinda boring but totally release-able

**Awkward\_King** (6): release her she's been in purgatory for over a decade LET HER OUT

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): Gaga outsold, changing it to "and my heart is playing a song that you like" is nonsense

**TiltControls** (6): this could've been a good song if it was better

**indie\_fan\_** (5.5): I see why Gaga never dropped this. Neither version is particularly good - especially with how poorly the production aged IMO - but I suppose I do prefer the way Addison's vocals are handled here even if she doesn't have any noticeable vocal talent

**bogo** (5): yeah this is influencer music all right

**Paggers** (5): This track falls flat on its face without Gaga’s theatrical delivery. Addison’s voice is devoid of any emotion here. Do yourself a favour and listen to Kylie’s FAR superior ‘Fever’, from which this melody is lifted.

**pig-serpent** (5): Who voted for this over the obviously and vastly superior Gaga version?

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): guess what the radio is playing? not this, it wasn't released

**seanderlust** (4): not to be a stan but gaga's version outsold. "my hands in the back pockets of your pants" VASTLY outsold. let addison feel ass!!!!!

**blanketbaker** (3.5): so dull it made me forget it was a lady gaga song, sounds v clearly unfinished

**nootnoot781** (3): should’ve submitted the lady gaga version instead 😶‍🌫️

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): look at everything i said about i got it bad but without the me liking the song part

**frogaranaman** (1): sounds like a song you'd hear on a Disney channel sitcom

**letsallpoo** (0): she really cannot sing

**MrSwearword** (0): absolutely fucking not

The most important Mariah song this December. This provides a good amount of drama and soul for Mariah to work with but it gives more beloved deluxe track than single energy to me.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Put her in White Lotus

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ………I’ve asked “why was this not released??” several times throughout this playlist but I’m REALLY asking it here.

**MrSwearword** (10): this should've been released instead of "We Belong in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch". Also, prayer circles for "Skydiving" to be released.

**turtle-thief** (10): I feel it!

**indie\_fan\_** (9.9): will forever frustrate me that this did not make the cut anywhere on TEOM.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): sexy crazy cool

**imbaby122** (9.2): very mother of her

**bogo** (9): so is this

**CrimsonROSET** (9): mariah carey everyone

**oscarbrierley1** (9): I love this mid 2000s soul revival sound. It's a shame she couldn't get the sample cleared to release it.

**TiltControls** (8.5): i fear the comments on this song might need a nsfw section

**1998tweety** (8): bops

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Mother ate what can I say. That whistle at the end is all you need to know.

**frogaranaman** (8): that bassline ugh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): oh hey i forgot that there were good songs in this rate

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): i do too

**wasian-invasion** (8): from the first few seconds this was so obviously from emancipation of mimi

**welcome2thejam** (8): Very, very solid, feels practically fully formed which is a major plus in its favor

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): oh this is good

**akanewasright** (7.5): This would be solid filler on Emancipation, it was apparently meant to be on that album in the place of joy ride and… yeah I would’ve preferred that I think

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): voice of all time

**blanketbaker** (7): slow evolving plucky backing track with silky vocals

**fadedblue09** (7): oh this is definitely a serviceable Emancipation bside

**iadoreyouranus** (7): i'm obsessed with this throwback soul sound

**jordannimz** (7): The groove is really fun and of course Mariah’s vocals sound incredible!

**vayyiqra** (7): A song in this rate that isn't unfinished, badly made or totally bizarre? Could it be? A song that's just normal? I forgot songs like that existed by this point in the rate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): If this were on the album it would have been a skip.

**runaway3212** (6.5): I like this but im a little bored

**Awkward\_King** (6): me when i reach inside the drain

**bespectacIed** (6): not a huge loss for emancipation. But It's fine cuz it's mimi

**DaHumanTorch** (6): this was cute but nothing great. vocals were amazing though, per usual for her

**ImADudeDuh** (6): carole king about the earth that is moving under her feet

**Stryxen** (4): her vocals are amazing but the track is so like... erratic and things happen at the weirdest times... not feeling her

This instrumental is kinda 2009 Akon-y which works given the vibe, which I find weirdly nostalgic. Side note, I went to a Catholic K-8 school growing up and VBS was officially for 1st through 5th graders but when you were in 6th through 8th grade you were expected to be an unpaid counselor?? It was only a week every summer but I feel like there had to be a labor violation in there somewhere

---

**musical\_pyn** (11): ayesha erotica is charli xcx for people whose taylor swift is ethel cain

**SweetSummerAir** (11): The mix of raunchy lyrics with heartfelt moments during the latter parts of the song, combine that with sublime production from Ayesha chef's kiss

**wavingwolves** (11): ayesha is a songwriter first and everything else second because she knows how to construct a narrative in a way that not a single other artist is able to do

**akanewasright** (10): WELL IT’S FINE BECAUSE I’M A WHORE AND I SLEEP WITH GUYS JUST FOR FUN AND DRUGS

**Awkward\_King** (10): somehow i think the chorus of this song isnt the only scat ayesha has done

**bespectacIed** (10): Tied with Star, this is her best song and indeed one the greatest unreleased urban legends in the history of music. Ayesha lived, breathed, ate, shat, snorted, McBling with this one. The lyricism is singularly hers, equal parts genius and pearls-clutching. Wherever ayesha is, i hope she's thriving

**bloodjet** (10): now it's fine because i'm a whore :(

**DaHumanTorch** (10): WELL IT'S FINE BECAUSE I'M A WHORE

**RandomHypnotica** (10): catholic schools/summer camps are really the raunchiest places imaginable

**runaway3212** (10): this song has nothing to do with the bible and also i dont know why you would want to sing about this ever

**Stryxen** (10): this can't be the same vbs lucy dacus was talking about

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): fuck me in the ass cuz I love jesus-core

**1998tweety** (9): BOP

**daythreeinmiami** (9): Now this I fuck with. I do need a proper produced version of this song asap.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (9): if i was straight, this would’ve made me want to go bible school but im gay

**jordannimz** (9): I knew that Slayyyter worked with and was heavily inspired by Ayesha on her earlier tracks, but I didn’t realize just how similar their sounds were. Even their voices are extremely similar! This is undeniably a bop and I love the production.

**pig-serpent** (9): You see guys! Sluts have feelings too!!!

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): finally some christian hyperpop!

**imbaby122** (8.7): so pink feminine y2k quirky

**shipperondeck** (8.6): i initially underrated this

**MassiveThief** (8.5): I went to VBS and don't remember it being like this

**plastichaxan** (8.5): The only relatable part of this song for me is being a whore that sleeps with guys for fun and drugs maybe I skipped a few chapters here and there

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): NOW ITS FINE BECAUSE IM A WHORE

**impla77** (8): #Gospel #GospelMusic #ChristianSong #Praise #WorshipSongs #ChristianVideos #Motivation

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): invented Slayyter

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): a softer suppler side of Ms. Erotica I see

**AHSWeeknd** (7): this is where Kim Petras gets her inspiration from

**CrimsonROSET** (7): a song versatile enough where lucy dacus and ayesha erotica can make equally good songs to

**indie\_fan\_** (7): I have never heard someone use the word 'fornicate' in a song until now

**jackisboredtoday** (7): TK please choose which succession fancam to this song you find funnier and leave that for this song:  https://twitter.com/DILFBAlT/status/1490482508986732544?s=20&t=fqGvI7ji2XI2yHLnQ5diJg https://twitter.com/sapphicpatel/status/1462425065132199936?s=20&t=tGBqKIuL_lEEvIRS5SmT8A

**TiltControls** (7): this is like someone smashed the kkb and charli albums from cyberpop together

**wasian-invasion** (7): this song is 5 minutes?? Sometimes I wish the tiktokification of music was more of a thing (or was this pre-tik tok idk)

**welcome2thejam** (7): The dream of the late 00s/early 10s is alive and well and not for consumption by the general public

**iadoreyouranus** (6): she kinda ate with this one

**throwaway-7650** (6): not gagging... lucy dacus out-VBS'd

**vayyiqra** (6): Wait this isn't Sufjan Stevens the title was misleading

**ImADudeDuh** (5): listening to this makes the “listen to Vacation Bible School by Ayesha! My favorite christian song 🙏” videos on tiktok less funny tbh

**apatel27** (4): This isn't Lucy Dacus

**blanketbaker** (4): pop potpourri

**bogo** (3): tacky and long as hell

**just\_thonking** (2.5): this is making me question whether music should even exist

**frogaranaman** (1): any song that uses the word "fornicate" should stay unreleased

**MrSwearword** (1): hell

Completely understandable that Doja's label doesn't want her to release this considering it would be polarizing at best and widely mocked at worst but I'm glad it exists to show more of her personality. I'm not a fan by any means but it would be very disappointing if she was pushed further and further into the generic pop lane (with the occasional Roman-esque rap verse).

---

**vayyiqra** (11): See now this is unironically good as well as stupid and it makes me laugh and have a good time. And that's what music is supposed to do. Sometimes. idk.

**wasian-invasion** (11): a laudatory ode to all our sanitation worker kings keeping our streets clean our homes pest-free and our pussies wet

**akanewasright** (10): The best song ever made

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck i was meant to put the bins out

**daythreeinmiami** (10): a real mastermind of our generation. your fave could never. it fucking slaps, does it not? don't tell me it doesn't because it does.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (10): if you give this less than a 10 then you hate fun

**jackisboredtoday** (10): She’s spitting!!! He do what he can, can’t do what he can’t

**musical\_pyn** (10): the fukcing owl sound at the beginning like this is just another planet her track lmaoooo

**imbaby122** (5): it was real to me!!! stop laughing guys the beat is so good!!! it’s not a joke!!!

**MrSwearword** (5): a good beat wasted with Doja Cat's attempt at singing. Oh about "Trash Man" you say? Yeah my point stands.

**pig-serpent** (5): The second verse is funny and all, but as a song I don't particularly enjoy listening to this.

**bloodjet** (4): the sonic equivalent of doja's twitter post

I am notoriously mixed on Ariana's work from Sweetener onwards (aka I'm the delusional twink who unironically enjoys Yours Truly the most of her albums) and I also think TLC's Waterfalls is a pretty overrated song but this works nonetheless? It feels much more casual than Ariana's other pop&B output, which leads to it being more lively as well.

---

**akanewasright** (11): …Jesus fuck this is good. Was totally gonna 11 charli but this is where my heart is pulling me

**Roxieloxie** (11): oh now this is a song that made me mad i did the rate cause this is so so good and now im gonna be mad its not on streaming. Easily the best discovery here

**sufjancaesar** (11): One of my fave Ariana songs. The TLC sample is used so well and it’s just a warm, groovy bop!

**Awkward\_King** (10): im sorry this song is perfect, its such a brilliant use of a sample while also being great as its own song. i love sweetener but if it all sounded like this id actually feel comfortable telling people i love it

**bespectacIed** (10): Literal r&b perfection. The way I've played this more times than some songs on sweetner lol yeah she was sniffing farts for scrapping this. imagine having a missy collab and a tlc sample in ONE album. further legitimizing her main R&B girl status.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): we should rate this album

**MrSwearword** (10): Something that could've been on Sweetener that could've given that horrific album two listenable tracks besides "R.E.M."

**throwaway-7650** (10): wow this was a massive grower, how did I give it a 6

**turtle-thief** (10): This hook cured my depression yuh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This is so cute! …It could have replaced a few songs on Sweetener.

**plastichaxan** (9): Rating this before sweetener kinda funny especially because it’s kinda better than a lot of it

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): interviewer: what's your favorite netflix show? ariana:

**impla77** (8.4): more like yuh amirite?

**1998tweety** (8): she ate a bit

**iadoreyouranus** (8): wow the waterfalls of it all

**ignitethephoenix** (8): oh this is cute it definitely could have made Sweetener

**jordannimz** (8): I love the groove of this song and while it's not my fav Ari track, it's still pretty fun and catchy.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I love this, I wish this was actually included on sweetener.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): why is this better than 90% of the songs that actually ended up on sweetener

**TiltControls** (7.5): there's not really a single standout moment from this track, but it's solid

**shipperondeck** (7.1): "white like caillou??"

**bogo** (7): me?

**daythreeinmiami** (7): It's cute yuh. Sounds like a deep cut from Yours Truly a lil bit though. I can understand why she cut this from Sweetener.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Don’t sample an iconic song if you aren’t able to do it justice!

**imbaby122** (7): this is lofi hiphop beats to study/relax to as a pop song

**oscarbrierley1** (7): the chorus and first verse are really good, but the second verse and bridge sound really clunky and unpolished. It sounds like they stopped working on it when they realised how much it was going to cost to clear the waterfalls sample.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): i can see why it was cut, it’s pleasant but not particularly memorable

**seanderlust** (7): i'm trying to decide how this would have done had it been included with sweetener. i think it could be a fan favorite that the GP generally didn't know about

**AHSWeeknd** (6): oof, you just know that some people were like “this could’ve replaced the light is coming.” It really couldn’t.

**blanketbaker** (6): mellow and pleasant to listen to

**pig-serpent** (6): Ari's cute on this track, but the instrumental is nothing. The horns are a nice touch though.

**Stryxen** (6): her default mode is just so music that could pass on a christmas playlist

**vayyiqra** (6): Ariana Grande - Yuh

**fadedblue09** (5): did this really deserve a spot over Be Alright (feat. Migos)

**frogaranaman** (5): I get why this was cut

**ImADudeDuh** (5): isnt this that netflix show about murderers or something

**welcome2thejam** (5): Pleasant listen but ultimately forgettable

**musical\_pyn** (4): this is just such a nothing of a song

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): I mean it's got a groove. But I'm not groovin :(

**runaway3212** (3): cut off two seperate albums for a reason

The only Charli song with the Vroom Vroom sound that I think lives up to the highs of that song. It has the same manic energy and beat switches but with a bit more brightness that I think differentiates it just enough. idk why Jimmy Kimmel's audience panned this so hard it's a bop!!!

---

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this fucking classic the global implications this would've had if it released...

**pig-serpent** (11): SO HOT!

**akanewasright** (10): it was a horrible idea to vote this in instead of one of charli’s more pop songs… but yes this is one of my favorite songs

**bespectacIed** (10): I imagine the perfect death is being smothered by a mountain of perky bouncing silicone-filled boobs and asses while this is played in the background

**bogo** (10): not sure how i'm supposed to bounce in my bed but i'll try my hardest

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is just a love letter to PC music

**hikk** (10): the iconic performance of this ...

**nootnoot781** (10): the kyary pamyu pamyu version >>>>

**plastichaxan** (10): This is the best song I’ve ever heard I don’t get how the people in that talk show weren’t trying to get their poppers listening to this???

**RandomHypnotica** (10): bigtittycharli.jpg

**runaway3212** (10): Absolutely amazing

**shipperondeck** (10): i dont care. this is fun

**Stryxen** (10): oh its bouncing

**SweetSummerAir** (10): A song that almost cost her career and yet is now celebrated. Iconique

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Shout out to the confused Jimmy Kimmel audience

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): if you're on a trampoline by kkb:

**imbaby122** (9.7): i’m doing wonders for charli xcx fans in academia i just mentioned the jimmy kimmel bounce performance in a paper i wrote. this is a 10 but where is kyary pamyu pamyu?

**LesApfels** (9): Gagged Jimmy Kimmel a bit

**AHSWeeknd** (8): why doesn’t she pronounce “sauna” like a normal person?

**bloodjet** (8): kinda repetitive but the texture is so slay

**frogaranaman** (8): that Jimmy Kimmel performance of this song lives rent free in my head

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I was so pissed off when they took that late night show performance of this off of YouTube, I was so into that.

**seanderlust** (8): "here's some places!" - my partner, about the second verse

**turtle-thief** (8): Love this song but there's such a lack of presence, it feels empty at times.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): iconic performance

**jordannimz** (7): Not my fav Charli verses, but Sophie’s production absolutely SLAPS and the drop is so fun!

**oscarbrierley1** (7): I love half of this song, but I hate the beat drop.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): gay people when the worst beat drop of all time comes on

**vayyiqra** (7): In truth this was disappointing for a collab between two artists I like a lot, but I wanted to like it enough that I convinced myself that it's kind of good.

**wasian-invasion** (7): but charli im not in the club/car/bed/sauna/gym/going to work/paris/london/new york/beijing/la/ghana and my name is none of klas/sophie/ag/charli/noonie/kyary can I still bounce bounce bounce?

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I can’t help but think about how I would rather listen to Work Bitch which is a very similar style song

**blanketbaker** (6.5): slide flute / theremin kazoo solo I dig, bubbly sound effects, def has charli sound to it, kind of repetetive without building much

**1998tweety** (6): this was ok

**apatel27** (6): God what an ugly drop

**iadoreyouranus** (6): the vibes are correct but she can do better

**wavingwolves** (6): what if i DON'T particularly want to bounce...

**welcome2thejam** (6): Uggggh hate when a song is otherwise great but fumbles the drop

**just\_thonking** (5.5): kind of annoying but also kind of fun

**sufjancaesar** (5): Did she mean to group Ghana with a bunch of cities? The capital city is Accra sweetie…

**ImADudeDuh** (4): even Charli’s unreleased stuff sucks damn

**ricki** (4): right on the edge of hyperpop, but still firmly standing on mid 10s drop-instead-of-a-chorus edm territory

**Awkward\_King** (3): no bc i understand why xcx world was scrapped after this

**TiltControls** (3): i'm not in any of those 6 places and i don't have any of those names so maybe that's why i'm not bouncing

**fadedblue09** (2): whats with the rubber balloon noises

**throwaway-7650** (2): we wanted TKO in over this shit

**daythreeinmiami** (1): Did she she freaking sample a Nintendo DS sound? Anyway, this type of drop with the heavy saw synth just gives me the shivers of a time long past thank god. It's a no from me.

**FlavaSavaVandal** (1): girl does it look like I live on a trampoline????

**MrSwearword** (1): has me channeling Spongebob in the "aight imma head out" pic.

SZA's other known foray into the nu-disco space after The Other Side (the JT collab that dropped alongside COVID.) This is definitely a song that I could see being improved by an official release, as in its current form it feels more like an improvised jam session with the spoken word bits and running about two minutes too long. It's an excellent groove that could be perfected by reigning in those elements.

---

**CritneySpearz** (11): ojkasdlasl this song is so fucking good omg?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I can understand SZA not releasing this but Kevin Parker how could you??

**frogaranaman** (10): I will cackle if cremee is right and this is included in S.O.S on Friday (reveal note: I submitted this on 12/4)

**MrSwearword** (10): this is gonna be released in like a year and a half but this slaps.

**TiltControls** (10): oh this is everything. SZA + Tame isn't an collab I would've expected to happen, but it works perfectly

**cremeebrulee** (9): can’t wait for this to appear on the SOS deluxe in 2028 🙏

**CrimsonROSET** (9): but why is the bath tub so dirty

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is such a slay how dare we have a Tame Impala song from her in the vaults 😭

**jordannimz** (9): I know SZA is mostly known for her slow jams, but I love her voice on a groovy track like this!

**oscarbrierley1** (9): obviously unfinished but the chorus is so catchy. I also kinda like some of the spoken parts. Something about the speech patterns reminds me of cynthia bailey

**welcome2thejam** (9): FT. TAME IMPALA!?

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): This has so much potential & shows a sound I would KILL to hear SZA dive deeper into. It does feel a bit unfinished, so it would need some polish to be ready for release or to get an even higher score from me, but this does a solid job of living up to my hopes for such a dream team of collaborators.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): between this and F2F I need more rock/alt SZA

**akanewasright** (8): This would’ve been a summer smash… Maybe could still be one

**RandomHypnotica** (8): the vocals are clearly a rough demo, but there is still time to master this and get it on SOS Deluxe

**runaway3212** (8): SZA slays but "im a little bored" was right

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): TAME IMPALA????

**throwaway-7650** (8): not SZA late to the nu-disco trend (unsurprising tbh)

**imbaby122** (7.8): we need a disco diva sza era! maybe in 2028 :/

**impla77** (7.7): This song is too long

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Was this an outtake from the Trolls movie soundtrack?

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): NOT sza working with my enemy omg

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): There's obviously some rough things that needed to be worked on (she just kinda mumbles her way through the second verse and gives up halfway through) but other than that, it's a decent tune. I like it. Big up Kevin.

**seanderlust** (7.5): god this collab would have slayed. that said, this song went on forever lord

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): funkyy but it's also in the "we didn'y really finish this track" uncanny valley that some of these other songs were also in

**shipperondeck** (7.2): i expected to like this more :/

**Stryxen** (7): she munched a little but then she choked and kept trying to eat when she couldn't. (it lasted a little too long)

**turtle-thief** (7): This is so not SZA and so SZA at the same time.

**vayyiqra** (7): Guess it's time to stop putting off listening to that SZA album

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): this was cute i guess

**pig-serpent** (6.5): This is pretty but it's very easy to confuse it with a Youtube advertisement.

**wavingwolves** (6.2): this sounds like a mashup and not a particularly great one

**iadoreyouranus** (6): sza and tame impala are such an unconsidered match made in heaven

**LesApfels** (6): The bones are there

**Awkward\_King** (5): id literally die for this compulsive liar why do i not like this

**bespectacIed** (5): Such a generic and soulless collab from two artists who are anything but!!! I'm probably being mean cuz this is cute, but these two don't just do cute!

**FlavaSavaVandal** (5): using sza as a trojan horse to get tame impala in the rate is sick and twisted

**daythreeinmiami** (3.5): Okay. So there is this song called 'The Look of Love, Pt 1' by a band ABC and her delivery and the overall vibe of this song reminds me of that song. Although, unlike that song the spoken delivery goes on for WAY too long with the same bars playing over and over. I was kinda excited for Tame Impala's influence but damn, that was boring. I wonder if this was the finished product, cause if it was, yeah...

**bogo** (3): i do not understand the hype for this song, the backing track sounds like a cheap say so ripoff and the song is weirdly empty sounding at times

**apatel27** (2): Wonder why they scrapped this track that wastes both artists

**blanketbaker** (0): autotune fucks her voice up come on queen, the highschool auditorium you're singing in isn't helping. so unpolished it hurts.

This is kinda boring sorry! Bey elevates it with her superior vocals but I don't think this understated R&B sound does her (or Ariana, for that matter) any favors. That said, even without seeing the results from the upcoming Sweetener rate, it's easy to see how well this did considering it's an almost objectively better version of a song from a beloved album.

---

**1998tweety** (10): if I was Ariana I would never sing this song again, the way Beyonce absolutely devoured her on this

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The child crying at the end… you know damn well that was Beyoncé’s idea.

**bespectacIed** (10): Being the self-proclaimed biggest stan of both Bey and Ari on popheads, I can admit Ari ate her up... slightly lol. This is beautiful and technically flawless, but I prefer Ari's dreamy take (duh) over her sultry delivery. Also, I can't see this belonging on any of her album so I don't mind it scrapped, whereas R.E.M is an integral part of sweetener.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): by the way beyonce is great in case you didn’t know

**indie\_fan\_** (10): It took me Bey's version to warm up to Ariana's. I just like her delivery here more

**MrSwearword** (10): you mean to tell me Beyonce turned this song down for the likes of "XO"? Disgusting, this song is great.

**pig-serpent** (10): As someone who doesn't listen to much Beyonce, I'm more familiar with the songs where she uses her voice as a bulldozer and it's easy for me to forget that she makes really good quiet songs too.

**SweetSummerAir** (10): Much better than Ari's version tbh

**throwaway-7650** (10): finally on the other side of the ghostwriter allegations

**turtle-thief** (10): This song is unbeatable, and baby Blue Ivy in the back is just precious.

**seanderlust** (9.5): wait this is so good omg WHY was this scrapped. i mean this album getting scrapped gave us beyonce s/t but at what cost

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): I can't believe blue ruined the take, no wonder she couldn't release it

**blanketbaker** (9): it's a fucking holiday to listen to this

**bogo** (9): no offense to ariana but beyonce should've kept this for herself

**impla77** (9): o god baby jumpscare at end

**plastichaxan** (9): Putting this before we rate sweetener was kind of a set up for Ari

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): it’s nice, but i wish the production matched bey’s vocals more. like if this was more akin to rocket or no angel? whewww

**imbaby122** (8.5): i’ve never heard the ari version but please tell me she doesn’t say “whew chile”

**TiltControls** (8.5): me every weekday morning

**fadedblue09** (8): if I was Ariana, I would've deleted R.E.M from my catalog after this because this puts her to shame

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I really like how she has her own Beyoncé spin on this (and it’s not just like the Ariana version) but I do prefer the Ariana version probably cause I’ve heard it so much at this point and I love that song.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the ari & bey beef in the comments is killing me because I never heard the ari version. Well it's like a preview of ex-acts rate ig

**shipperondeck** (7.7): the ending :( <3

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): beyonce is trying her damnedest to make this song but unfortunately regardless of which version i am listening to i find the production on this annoying and distracting. however i will give her points for trying and for this being miles better than the ariana version

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I love Bey but R.E.M. is not my favorite from Sweetener so there’s only so much that can be done about that

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The vocal runs she does and Blue in the end is cute. But if this was for self titled and can totally understand why she cut it.

**frogaranaman** (7): why is Beyoncé so aggressively match making people on this song

**iadoreyouranus** (7): amazing song but i prefer ari's version

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The grunt she does in this song is so funny

**slimboyfriend** (7): Her consonants are a little too PLOSIVE

**vayyiqra** (7): Oh it's literally "R.E.M." with Bey on it which is kind of surreal but it's alright

**welcome2thejam** (7): Dreams of main pop girl Michael Stipe have once again been denied to me

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): what I never knew about this

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): idk maybe im biased from hearing ariana's version first but that felt like a lullaby slowly drifting me off to sleep and this (especially the WAKE UPs) feel like someone trying to shake me out of a coma. beyonce's performance does not fit the dreamy production at all

**akanewasright** (6): the Ariana version is on my anxiety playlist, and while this is good, it doesn’t serve that purpose at all and it makes me irrationally mad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): It’s still a good song but man it was just made for Ariana’s voice.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I prefer Ariana’s softer take on this, Beyoncé attacking this with her characteristic swagger gives it a different vibe. Like the way she just snaps “wake up” makes me feel like I’m being reprimanded.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i can see how this became an ariana grande album cut (derogatory)

**jordannimz** (6): I prefer Ariana’s soft and breathy version, but I love Beyoncé’s harmonies in this version too :)

**Stryxen** (6): i see the vision. i do not hear the execution

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): ariana absolutely stomped on her oh wow-

**MassiveThief** (5): Pretty glad Ariana got this in the end - I don't even LOVE her version, but I definitely prefer it to this

**RandomHypnotica** (5): i am sorry but this version doesn’t work for me, i think ari took this track where it needed to go

**LesApfels** (4): Let's be honest here, Ariana ate her up

**runaway3212** (4): ari's version is worse but this isnt good either

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): the sweetener rate manifested too much i think

Definitely better than the solo version that was actually released but I think that's mainly because any sort of anything going on would be additive. It's fine but not mind blowing; I don't think this would've done any better on the charts than Love Again/We're Good/whatever other single it was supposed to replace.

---

**bespectacIed** (11): probably won't win but I have such a fond memory of this. Future Nostalgia will always be my quarantine mania album, the bridge between the old life and the new life we didn't know yet. This song is a huge part of that core memory. I even removed GIB and BWBB on spotify, imported this leak, and pretended this was part of the standard version instead lmao. Such a perfect pop song. This version never being released is classified as a war crime by the Geneva conventions, fuck naurmoney's team

**ignitethephoenix** (11): both versions of this are great, going to blame Normani’s team for not letting this onto the deluxe

**1998tweety** (10): now why wasn't this the official version, the adlibs in that last chorus really brings this song to a 10

**hikk** (10): i like the version that was released a lot so this is a 10 too, i can go with or without normani idc tbh

**impla77** (10): Haven’t heard the other version but I’m willing to bet this outsold

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I added this to my copy of Future Nostalgia upon the leak and its honestly a highlight of the album for me. Highly recommend putting it in place of Good In Bed/BWBB and you suddenly have a classic album

**jordannimz** (10): I like the versions with and without Normani about equally, but either way this song is one of Dua’s best imo. I really am obsessed with Normani’s harmonies on “wicked love’s creeping up”, as well as her ad libs in the final chorus!

**nootnoot781** (10): normani’s label are never seeing heaven

**oscarbrierley1** (10): I understand why normanis team probably didn't want this released at the time because it's a bit similar to dancing with a stranger, but this is such a bop and without her its just not the same

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I believe if they released this that Normani would no be the biggest artist

**throwaway-7650** (10): me tagging this incorrectly for months

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): it will always anger me that this never saw a release its just better than the solo version in every way... all because normani's label didnt want her to go the pop route even though clearly whatever she does it'll be a flop. like let the girl flop making all kinds of music!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): This has got to be the least unreleased out of all the songs here, right? Maybe I should knock it for that. I won’t.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): was going to point out how funny it is that this is the first normani song we’re rating but i really forgot diamonds existed lol

**imbaby122** (9.5): i always forget normani can really sing but i guess being in hibernation for a year does good things for your voice

**bogo** (9): idk why normani is allergic to releasing music this could've been a moment but oh well

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is good but am I the only one who can’t really tell the difference between Normani and Dua on this track? Their voices are processed to sound basically identical. Production is fierce though.

**seanderlust** (9): did normani just get snow on the beached?

**wasian-invasion** (9): great song but idk after getting used to the solo version I don’t really think normani adds much

**iadoreyouranus** (8): this song deserved to be a single, especially for normani

**MrSwearword** (8): Normani is a non-presence, I can hear why this version was scrapped for the solo.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): better than almost any song on future nostalgia

**shipperondeck** (7.5): why tf was she removed?? she only adds to the track no downsides

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): again I ask myself the same question I've been asking since 2019: does Normani still exist

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): i can’t believe this is the first normani song we’re rating

**wavingwolves** (7.1): a bit of a smash if i say so myself

**ricki** (7): normani and her team working overtime to make sure her career never takes off

**TiltControls** (7): speedrun normani's discography except motivation challenge

**vayyiqra** (7): Surprised Popheads doesn't talk about this more since it seems like the exact kind of thing they'd eat up.

**daythreeinmiami** (6.5): It's aight. I zoned out a little and completely missed Normani's part though at least I think I did? Was she in the background? I don't know and I'm not listening to it again. This is a fast paced environment.

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Oh hey, it's the only good song from the Moonlight edition, now "And Normani?" Tbh I barely notice her.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): the way stans acted like the song lost something after Normani wasn’t featured on the official version 💀 I’m sorry but she adds nothing to it. The released version is so much better.

**DaHumanTorch** (6): absolutely obsessed with how normani doesn't add a single thing to this

**just\_thonking** (6): kind of unfair to include this since it's basically an actually released song, so my score is a reflection of how much it improves on the official version, which is not a lot

**Stryxen** (6): the source of the unreleased plague is her... quarantine her neowww

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): this isn't kygo and selena gomez

**akanewasright** (5.3): This version of the song shows promise, if it was a bit more fleshed out… and then the version that got released was just as limp, without normani there to add any variation

**CrimsonROSET** (5): future nostalgia was so tight because the bad songs were dropped!

**frogaranaman** (5): very average

**ImADudeDuh** (4): honestly Normani, be happy that you weren’t apart of deluxe tracks of Future Nostalgia

**LesApfels** (3.5): The official is a snoozefest and this is only slightly better

**blanketbaker** (3): it's a decent metronome. consistent memory hole throughout the rate.

**runaway3212** (3): I find FN's sound has dated so quickly for me

damn,,,,this is a perfect pop song. A true graduations/weddings/funerals/etc song. Originally recorded by Poppy and containing the best chorus ever written by Charli XCX, this is the definition of a Pop What Could Have Been. I've never heard another song that's begged this hard for a Dave Meyers video and full promotional blitz, and yet, it will likely never happen because Addison's team (allegedly) does not believe she should pursue a music career anymore. Anyways I will blame the slight underperformance of this on the fact that the hype gave it sky high expectations

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): The faves that were ended by this. So great in number…

**centralsouthsnack** (11): THE GREATEST POP SONG OF ALL TIME. FULL STOP. MOTHER.

**LesApfels** (11): This was my 3rd most streamed song of the year ok

**oscarbrierley1** (11): this probably had the biggest potential to change the artists career in the rate. Would it have been a huge hit? Probably not. But the gays wouldve eaten it up and she'd be playing Prides for the rest of her life.

**ricki** (11): yassss

**throwaway-7650** (11): the cyberpop hosts scanning my pop 2 scores:

**1998tweety** (10): wtf is this pop perfection

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is what locals what expect Addison Rae to make, but this isn’t what stans expect Addison Rae to make.

**akanewasright** (10): idk something takes over me when I hear this… the white gay just jumps out

**Awkward\_King** (10): i want to hate this so so badly, but addison rae makes amazing music

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this existing is still insane to me, like especially being so good? what

**DaHumanTorch** (10): DAMN! I GOT IT BAD!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I know nothing about who this woman is except that she’s a YouTuber and was in a Netflix film but this is so good… like I get shivers when she goes “take off every piece of me / until it’s only skin on my body.” It is kinda clear that she can’t sing but in this unreleased rate where the songs are all in 240p that doesn’t really matter.

**hikk** (10): damn! we got it bad: you'll never guess what happens next

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this should not be this good like

**ImADudeDuh** (10): beyonce was so scared of this overshadowing Renaissance so she told her to not release this or else

**jordannimz** (10): Pls I need this on streaming—this is pop perfection, and I love the alternate chorus after the bridge (à la Britney's first hits)!

**musical\_pyn** (10): I love my unreleased rate winner AND my 2023 ultimate rate winner

**nootnoot781** (10): i feel like if someone like slayyyter released this i would like it significantly less, but the fact that addison rae made this just adds a sprinkle of cvnt to it that cannot be ignored.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song turned me into a f- fan that only says yass mama slay cunty pussy mother and I thank it for that every day

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if this rate was merely a vessel to get this into AS6 i approve

**shipperondeck** (10): on several playlists

**Stryxen** (10): DAMN! I GOT IT BAD

**just\_thonking** (9): yeah ok addison rae can have a little praise, as a treat

**Paggers** (9): Charli continues her streak of handing over smash hits on a silver platter to far less deserving artists. One point deducted for Miss Rae’s tragic attempt at sustaining a note in the bridge.

**vayyiqra** (9): I still don't know who exactly this girl is but this unexpectedly rules; I cannot help loving overly dramatic synthpop.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Almost 2017 Puthian levels of "damn didn't know they had it in em"

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Dissapointed she never got far with her music career outside of one single. This is an absolute smasher.

**sufjancaesar** (8.5): Whoever’s amazing vocals were dubbed into this you can come forward now

**TiltControls** (8.5): me as i slowly racked up phoebe bridgers plays in 2020

**bogo** (8): the three people who gave i got it a 0 in cyberpop:

**celladonn** (8): i'm so mad that this is good

**iadoreyouranus** (8): every main pop girl was shaking when this leaked

**imbaby122** (8): now WHAT did addison just call charli xcx’s career highlight “i got it (ft. brooke candy, cupcakke, and pabllo vittar)”?!?!?!

**slimboyfriend** (8): so glad this was never released because then I’d have to stan Addison Rae :/

**wavingwolves** (7.9): damn! we got "i got it bad:" you'll never guess what happened next — oh, it was put on a popheads rate... and the rest is herstory.

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I remember the day this leaked. It really made me begin to notice Addison Rae. And honestly, she's adorable and she has a sweet voice. Her voice is nothing special but this song is a cute little bop that really reminds me of something that would have been a deep cut from an album in 2010. Can't help but stan.

**runaway3212** (7): me doing this rate at 1 am

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): it's like I Got It, but bad. jk this is some pop goodness

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): god this fucking song, i can’t tank it because i do actually think its good but im so fucking tired of addison rae as a person, i can’t believe you guys actually hyped up this mediocre white girl trump voter whos only claim to fame is stealing dances on tiktok from much more talented creators, get real for once

**frogaranaman** (6): this would have an official release if y'all cooled your jets

**pig-serpent** (6): The instrumental has some pretty parts in the chorus but overall this song is just fine.

**wasian-invasion** (6): the way she says damn is so funny I teehee everytime (same with the bridge lol)

**cremeebrulee** (5.1): serviceable

**bloodjet** (5): dont get the hype srry. very well produced tho. the chorus reminds of rina's imagining (which is the better song of the 2)

**MrSwearword** (5): if she's referring to her brand of aggressive mediocrity, she's telling the truth.

**apatel27** (4): Pastiche 80s revival pop. No wonder popheads cream themselves over this

**indie\_fan\_** (4): there's potential with the production, but these elementary ass lyrics are a choice

**blanketbaker** (3): forgot I listened to it

**bespectacIed** (2): I don't see the hype, this is so generic? gays will drop their knees for any white girl with reverbed vocals and a synth line, good grief

**Roxieloxie** (2): u will not get me to support the addison agenda

Carly is the first ever queercoded person to ever dance to Cheek to Cheek (2014). This is the type of track that Carly excels at, but it's hard to rate this higher than an 8 because I feel like she's done it better so many times by now.

---

**bloodjet** (11): i think my dreams will come true if u release this song carly

**impla77** (11): obligatory carly 11

**just\_thonking** (11): Releasing this would have prevented Covid

**MassiveThief** (11): Kind of getting the same feeling as when I heard RAWM for the first time... also probably the biggest robbery here as far as release status. WE NEED IT CARLY

**Paggers** (11): Even queen Carly’s unreleased tracks are pop perfection.

**slimboyfriend** (11): She released tracks 9-12 on Dedicated (and Window on Dedicated side b) over THIS???

**1998tweety** (10): girl where was this on Dedicated Side B

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The way this song isn’t disco even a little bit…we’ll call it camp.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): she's so so sick for not releasing this, the EXCELLENCE

**frogaranaman** (10): she put her discussy into this

**imbaby122** (10): carly makes music for night drives with the windows open after a long night of clubbing (obv not behind the wheel)

**nootnoot781** (10): i can understand why most of the songs stayed unreleased because they either got released early (charli), they forget they made the song (SZA), they’re indecisive (ayesha) or too poor to afford the sample (slayyyter) but i genuinely cannot wrap my head around why carly shelved this 😭

**runaway3212** (10): if she released this my depression would be cured and summer would last forever

**SweetSummerAir** (10): One of Carly's most romantic songs. This would have fit well in Dedicated.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Carly leaving this off Dedicated Side B is my 9/11

**throwaway-7650** (10): MOTHER

**TiltControls** (10): Carly you can't hide this masterpiece forever

**wasian-invasion** (10): it made me irrationally happy when I heard the part that ended up in window. Queen of reduce reuse recycle!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): like there were multiple B sides on dedicated worse than this

**daythreeinmiami** (9): This song is beautiful. I'm annoyed at Carly cause this chorus is iconic. I got the goose bumps. The Carly goose bumps that only a Carly chorus can provide.

**jordannimz** (9): That chorus! Pop perfection! Carly really is a master at euphoric pop.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): wow a good song by Carly Bae, shocker

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): i feel like if this had been released we wouldn’t have gotten Loneliest Time

**wavingwolves** (8.1): i wish this was on the snooziest time

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The word “disco” is in the title but I hear no four-on-the-floor

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is a dedicated carly cut what do you want me to say i eat that shit up with a spoon

**iadoreyouranus** (8): miss jepsen never misses

**ImADudeDuh** (8): sounds good but the bridge sucks a bit

**LesApfels** (8): The production . . . my god

**shipperondeck** (8): not disco but very good

**Stryxen** (8): the excellence release her

**turtle-thief** (8): it's good but i see why she scrapped it and just kept Julien.

**bogo** (7.5): girl this sounds nothing like disco but it's good so i'm willing to let you off the hook just this once

**akanewasright** (7): oh that one part got reworked into window… tbh serve, that reminds me of how Beyoncé works and puts bits of songs into other songs. I enjoy window (and many other Carly songs) more than this though - it’s nice but the hook doesn’t really land

**musical\_pyn** (7): I love listening to leaked crj songs because she reuses so much in other songs that it's like playing I Spy

**Roxieloxie** (7): oh did window come from this?

**welcome2thejam** (7): Must be one of those Side C cuts

**bespectacIed** (6): I have never been as hyped about this as most of yall, sorry. It's a cute song but this didn't make me excited for the lost (dissolved?) disco album cuz DUH, this doesn't sound disco at all. Window ate her up

**FlavaSavaVandal** (6): no one wants to hear this but this is 99% of the way to being a taylor song

**oscarbrierley1** (6): it's not disco at all so kinda disappointed. Im not really a fan of much of her dedicated ers stuff. It's kinda boring.

**ricki** (6): im at peace with this not being released ngl

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this brand of extremely-polished-until-it-has-no-personality-anymore pop just reminds me why i dont care for carly’s music at all

**vayyiqra** (6): Thinking of how in 2018 or so, r/popheads convinced themselves the next CRJ album would be a 70s throwback called Disco Sweat and that definitely happened. anyway it's very funny how this is not even close to a disco song

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): is this what everyone has been going crazy over all this time...... i like it but this does just sound like a dedicated cut. and its not even disco!!!!!!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): Only the faintest bit of disco here, still it's okay

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I feel like people voted for this just because it has the word “disco” in the title, surely Carly has better songs than this buried in her backyard? This song has like half of a good chorus and then the rest of it is unremarkable.

**pig-serpent** (5): This is it? This is the song the gays have been hyping up for half a decade? Far from the worst song from the dedicated era, but many songs from this era feel very bland and colorless to me and this isn't any different.

**blanketbaker** (4.5): sounds like a pop song made for free skate filler.

**MrSwearword** (1): oh god no, thank christ this got scrapped.

**xophrys** (0): too taylor swifty (derogatory) and sugary

This one is a lot of fun but I don't think it's particularly groundbreaking. I get why the fans clamored for a release though because I could easily see a TikTok trend with this one, and it certainly deserves its legendary leak status just for the faint potential of giving Charli a real pop hit in her hyperpop era.

---

**bogo** (11): yeah no i get why this is hyped up

**Brendangrub** (11): the Taxi hype is completely justified

**hikk** (11): basic bitch alert

**nootnoot781** (11): reasons why i’m giving this my 11: gender inclusive, the shania reference (clock the flair), charli’s acknowledgement and absolute refusal to ever release it, the fact that the sped up pitched version adds a whole new layer of excellence to the song, sophie’s production, “The demo of "Taxi" was leaked on SoundCloud during September 2018, to celebrate the 2 year anniversary of the "After the Afterparty" release.” and the fact that come to my party isn’t in the rate.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): I mean, come on now

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): the lore of this song, has any unreleased song developed this level of reverance

**akanewasright** (10): TK sabotaging this song by putting a shitty version of the song in the YouTube playlist

**bespectacIed** (10): Hyperpop No Scrubs right here, like it's so serious. One of her best songs ever. Queen of honest communication and not leading on incompatible dates

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I can recognize the slay, and I can look past the assbooty quality of this upload.

**bloodjet** (10): need this song on spotify so bad

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the fucking discord notif

**iadoreyouranus** (10): gays all around the world rise up

**imbaby122** (10): bro taxi was set up bc how is anyone giving this version a good score 😭 i’m rating this as if it was the hq version.

**MassiveThief** (10): chorli sophie PERFECTION

**pig-serpent** (10): When I first heard this song it was half speed because I didn't know that I needed to speed up the youtube video to listen to it properly. Despite this, I listened to it over and over at half speed trying to get it to grow on me and... it worked eventually. My mind was blown when I heard it at regular speed a few months later.

**plastichaxan** (10): I want to party with her so bad I feel like I’d die or be near it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): tbh there are literally dozens of better unreleased charli songs than Taxi, idk why the fanbase latched onto this one, but it’s still a banger and i wouldn’t complain about a charli rate win

**Stryxen** (10): it really just is that good . not sorry

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I'm more of a public transport guy myself

**shipperondeck** (9.5): not overrated actually this song is fun af

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): I kinda got used to the sped up youtube version so I’m a little partial to that one

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): dumb question but is the audio quality a musical decision or just a result of google drive file compression

**Awkward\_King** (9): yeah i have to give it to her

**impla77** (9): Feel like this gets so much hype and its pretty good!

**jordannimz** (9): Do you think Charli was thinking about the black London taxis or the yellow New York taxis when she wrote this song?

**ricki** (9): whatever the right speed and pitch for this song is remains one of the greatest mysteries in history

**welcome2thejam** (9): RIP to the people who heard this on youtube, shame you're probably gonna tank this when you heard a version put through the Auditorium Echo filter

**celladonn** (8.5): so this is the fabled taxi... i wish the recording was higher quality but you can still tell this is a major bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): i have no idea whether i should be rating the youtube upload linked in this rate, which is a 7, or the higher quality, non-pitched up version thats on soundcloud, which is a 10, so i will be giving this score out to compromise on both

**1998tweety** (8): this is def overrated but its still good

**DaHumanTorch** (8): a tad overrated but still a great bop

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Oh this is a bop. I do wonder what this era of Charli's would have been like. I guess we will always have the leaks.

**just\_thonking** (8): ah so this is the taxi the gays are always talking about... I see the appeal tbh

**runaway3212** (8): Yeah it's iconic but it's really not THAT great

**vayyiqra** (8): This is one of the most overhyped unreleased songs of all time, but it is good I guess? Not enough to justify the cult around it but yeah sure it does kind of slap

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): it’s good but honestly in the canon of Charleaks the circlejerk around this one has made it get SO overrated compared to how good it really is

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): its fine, i just understand the cult this song has somehow amassed

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): it's cute, but I don't really understand why it became such a thing.

**wavingwolves** (7.3): the legend status that comes with this song is not understandable to me but she's a cute girl

**AHSWeeknd** (7): It’s good to know that taxis exist on XCX World

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I still have no idea what tempo should I use for this to finally "click"

**frogaranaman** (6): are the Discord noises in this song intentional

**TiltControls** (6): why are there bubbles is she calling the taxi from atlantis or something

**MrSwearword** (5): the production is fine for what it is, but honestly in my best Naomi Smalls voice, "Life's not fare".

**blanketbaker** (4): the notification theme to the instrumentation is neat. kind of basic otherwise

**Roxieloxie** (4): okay so im now realizing that this is not what i thought this song was and i guess i heard another unreleased charli song??

**FlavaSavaVandal** (3.5): someone has entered the voice call

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I’m not hearing what everyone else is I guess… this chorus is making me cringe

**ImADudeDuh** (0): there’s no way the most annoying people on the planet hyped up this song for literal YEARS and harassed Charli so much to release this and the song was just.. This?

**throwaway-7650** (0): why am I hearing windows XP and ppl joining a discord vc

This is enjoyable enough but it's a better TikTok sound than song imo. For me personally I need mashups to have a main vocal line to latch onto and this does not deliver in that regard so it's not something I will revisit.

---

**1998tweety** (11): i mean come on now. absolutely iconic and nostalgic

**cremeebrulee** (11): thank u to whoever submitted this 🙏 haven’t heard this in like 10 years but what a welcome wave of nostalgia it brought back

**frogaranaman** (11): this went triple platinum on the childhood frog charts

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): The second I heard “Wow” by Kylie Minogue it was OVER!

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this winning would be fucking ICONIC!

**jordannimz** (11): Such an incredible mashup of nostalgic hits. Madeon is a genius.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): this is one of the best remixes like this I have heard tbh

**Stryxen** (11): im gagging seriously i did not know this was a real track. i can't stop listening

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): how do you even make this. this is insane. i'm actually kinda mad and very jealous

**TiltControls** (11): Mashup rate for redemption-rateideas-mas

**welcome2thejam** (11): As someone who had been still scratching the surface level of music in 2011, this broke my tiny little brain back then and it's still a damn good time now

**bogo** (10): ok now this is just showing off

**celladonn** (10): this is just pure joy

**CrimsonROSET** (10): there is a universe where this wins the rate and honestly kinda wish i was in it

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is so good??? how have i never heard this

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Holy shit this amazing! He used Kylie's WOW! from her hit 2007 song, Wow! so I honestly have to give this what it deserves. The use of Viva La Vida as well. ugh. I loved every second of this. THIS is why I love doing rates.

**hikk** (10): 🕯️ ADVENTURE RATE MANIFESTATION 🕯️ like listen to the samples in this it's gay pop as hell he's so popheadscore fr

**musical\_pyn** (10): oh this is THIS?? This was one of the first things I remember making me feel like pop music can actually be really good and interesting so it's nice to see it again

**pig-serpent** (10): This video made me extremely temped to buy a launchpad in high school.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): it's madeon I have to give it a ten

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): absolutely based pick

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we want mashup rate!!!

**seanderlust** (10): unironically can we have a mini rate of all the songs sampled here. (no this is not just a way to allow me to campaign for take it off by kesha don't worry about it)

**shipperondeck** (10): how did he do this AND how did i not know about this during my massive porter/madeon phase in high school!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): oh my god i loved this mashup so much as a kid i had no idea madeon was behind it, what a blast to the past

**wavingwolves** (10): i forgot all about this but it remains so good whew

**imbaby122** (9.5): my ears were on alert the entire time it’s like an audio word search

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): random story: madeon performed for our freshman year welcome week and when my school teased his performance with a zoomed in picture of his lips everyone thought it was gonna be ariana grande

**akanewasright** (9): :o

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This rules and also it’s nice to hear an actual high quality recording of something.

**bloodjet** (9): this is how you do a mashup

**iadoreyouranus** (9): genius

**MassiveThief** (9): such a fun listen

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): nostalgia the song and I’m eating it up

**blanketbaker** (8): a classic for a reason. Punchy and fun

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): very cool but in the exact sort of way where i will never revisit it after this rate

**impla77** (7): This is so early 2010s I can’t be mad

**vayyiqra** (7): The drums at the beginning made me think "SHOOTING STARS ?!" and I wish, because that song rules, but this one is more like "uh it's fine". It's just "what if Porter Robinson was mid" x Daft Punk, and you could do a lot worse in this rate. I could say "why is it sampling Madonna though" but also "why not".

**LesApfels** (6): Pop Danthology please come back :'(

**MrSwearword** (4): sure it serves rave dj realness, but DJ Earworm washes this.

**oscarbrierley1** (3): it's just a mash up, I don't get why this counts as an unreleased song.

**plastichaxan** (3): I hate pop

**throwaway-7650** (3): as someone pro-hung up, not the madge jumpscare

**AHSWeeknd** (2): Do people still like these 2010 produced beats??

**bespectacIed** (2): this is jobless basement dwelling incel that FBI secretly tracks white boy-core

**runaway3212** (2): it's like we get it you can mash up different songs

TiltControls: Fantastic work TK for both the rate itself and getting everything for it set up! Now give mashup rate

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

OMFG I'm so pumped that Madeon pulled off the rate win. I didn't think it would have a huge shot when submitting it, but even if it's way back in the hall of winners I'm glad it at least made it there!

* Across all 7878 songs, **Pop Culture** ranks in at 1580th in a 3-way tie with Vince Staples - BagBak and Gorillaz - Rhinestone Eyes.
 * Right above it is another 3-way tie of M83 - Midnight City, The 1975 - Girls, and Kacey Musgraves - Golden Hour. 
 * Right below it in the rankings is (you guessed it) another 3-way tie; this time between The Go-Go's - Lust to Love, Ariana Grande - Dangerous Woman (Rerate), and Taylor Swift - All Too Well.

* As TK mentioned **Pop Culture** becomes the lowest average rate winner on Popheads. It takes the record that was set by TWICE - The Feels earlier in the year which had a 8.471.
* **Pop Culture**'s 2.519 controversy also means it's our most controversial winner ever too! The previous record was held by Alessia Cara's Here at 2.455. Surprisingly, it is the only song in the top 5 controversy for winners **not** to have a 0.

**Other song stats**

* **Literal Legend** becomes the sub's 8th most controversial song ever rated! On the leaderboard it sits between Katy Perry's Ur So Gay and Fifth Harmony's Work From Home.

## Artists

Since many of these artists are subreddit faves and have had multiple other songs rated, these additions will probably be no more than a drop in the bucket for their averages. However, some of the middle spots are so close together that every point counts. For anyone curious the shifts are below

**Featured artist changes:**
(sorted by their original rankings)

* Lorde (44th -> 49th)
* Mariah Carey (91st -> 94th)
* SOPHIE (106th -> 125th)
* FKA twigs (110th -> 126th)
* Dua Lipa (122nd -> 128th)
* Carly Rae Jepsen (125th -> 121st)
* Tinashe (128th -> 159th)
* The Weeknd (130th -> 133rd)
* SZA (138th -> 141st)
* Harry Styles (160th -> 184th)
* Beyoncé (162nd -> 161st)
* Charli XCX (166th -> 164th)
* Lana Del Rey (172nd -> 174th)
* Calvin Harris (179th -> 205th)
* Marina (185th -> 190th)
* Slayyyter (186th -> 193rd)
* Lady Gaga (200th -> 202nd)
* Kesha (213th -> 219th)
* Britney Spears (220th -> 222nd)
* Ariana Grande (223rd -> 223rd)
* Kim Petras (225th -> 232nd)
* Taylor Swift (232nd -> 234th)
* Doja Cat (249th -> 249th)

(Charli XCX and Carly were the only tracked artists to have a positive average changes, Ariana Grande was the only other artist not to have a decrease as hers did not change)

**Other Artist Stats**

* The four way tie for the artist with the most rate appearance has now been (kind of) broken! With this rate both **Ariana Grande** and **The Weeknd** have now appeared in 21 rates! They surpass Nicki Minaj and Rihanna who are both still stuck at 20. Though now they've moved from a 4 way tie to a 5 way tie as **Beyoncé**, **Charli XCX**, and **Taylor Swift** all hit their 20th rate appearance sending them into a massive tie for 3rd. Another 5 way tie forms for 8th place with 17 rate appearances as Katy Perry is now joined by **Carly Rae Jepsen**, **Lana Del Rey**, **Kesha**, and **Britney Spears**
* Unfortunately **Charli's** new leaderboard spot comes with some drawbacks. She now takes the lead for the longest streak of rates without winning at 21. She was previously tied with Nicki Minaj at 20.
* The Taylor vs Carly race to 11's grows ever closer as Carly picks up another 9 11's and closes the gap even more! Now Taylor only has a slight lead of 125!
* Taylor still holds her lead on the most 0's list high though, gaining an additional 7. She now has 173 more 0's than the 2nd place Katy Perry (for context Katy has 144 zeroes across her rate career). Though Katy Perry put up a valiant attempt to catch-up by releasing Smile, it won't do any good if we don't end up rating it! 
 * Despite the deadlock at the top, there is some movement on this chart as Lana picks up enough 0's here to enter the top 10! She comes in at 9th, knocking Britney off the board.

## Rates

* **Unreleased** becomes the rate with the 2nd highest controversy! The only other rate higher than it is Meme Rate with a staggering 2.726. It knocks Redemption Rate off the controversy leaderboard as apparently there can only be so many TK rates on there at once
* With 60% of the rate picking up at least one zero, **Unreleased** also manages to score 6th on the highest zero spread leaderboard. It sits between the Artpop / Prism / Beyonce rate and the Billboard Year End #1s rate. It also knocks Winners I off the board, breaking the collection of all three Winners rates being on the board
* If you're wondering whether this is the rate that has the least amount of songs crack the 8 range, it's close - but still can't beat the current leader. Actually no one has for almost 6 years. Revival vs. Bangerz vs. Confident had a record low 8+ scores with only the top 2 of the rate (Cool For The Summer and Wrecking Ball) managing to break into that range. Sorry Selena
