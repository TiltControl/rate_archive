Unreleased Songs Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/yy3avl/unreleased_songs_rate/

Hello everyone and welcome to the Unreleased Songs mini rate! As a result of your charitable monetary donations earlier this year and charitable upvotes last week, we have settled on a list of 30 of your favorite songs that never saw the light of day for one reason or another, and it's time to determine which of them were alternate universe smashas by assigning numerical values to them. Without further adieu, your list of songs:

And here are the rules copy pasted from a dozen other rates, with a few rate-specific additions:

* **If you are brand new to rates, I highly recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ1SDlLZcpM) to get acclimated.**
* You must listen to and submit a score for every song. If you send a ballot that's missing a score, I will message you as soon as I notice to finish your ballot.
* Each song must be scored between a 1 and 10, with the exception of one 0 and one 11, reserved for your least favorite and favorite songs in the rate respectively. One decimal place (e.g. 9.2) is acceptable, any more and I will have to round your scores. You are not required to use your 0 or 11 if you do not want to.
* Everyone's scores and comments for every song will be revealed at the end of the rate, so do not think of them as confidential!
* Scores may be changed and comments may be added up to the official due date.
* Here is the correct format for scores and comments on each line of the ballot linked [here](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=TragicKingdom1&subject=Unreleased%20Songs%20Rate&message=Username%3A%0A%20%0AAddison%20Rae%20-%20I%20Got%20It%20Bad%3A%0A%20%0AAddison%20Rae%20-%20Nothing%20On%20%28But%20the%20Radio%29%3A%0A%20%0AAriana%20Grande%20-%20You%3A%0A%20%0AAyesha%20Erotica%20-%20Literal%20Legend%3A%0A%20%0AAyesha%20Erotica%20-%20Vacation%20Bible%20School%3A%0A%20%0ABeyonce%CC%81%20-%20Wake%20Up%3A%0A%20%0ABritney%20Spears%20-%20Tell%20Me%20%28Am%20I%20A%20Sinner%29%3A%0A%20%0ACalvin%20Harris%20%26%20Tinashe%20-%205AM%3A%0A%20%0ACarly%20Rae%20Jepsen%20-%20Disco%20Darling%3A%0A%20%0ACharli%20XCX%20-%20Bounce%3A%0A%20%0ACharli%20XCX%20-%20Taxi%3A%0A%20%0ADoja%20Cat%20-%20Trash%20Man%3A%0A%20%0ADua%20Lipa%20%26%20Normani%20-%20If%20It%20Ain't%20Me%3A%0A%20%0AFKA%20twigs%20%26%20Dua%20Lipa%20-%20Why%20Don't%20You%20Love%20Me%3A%0A%20%0AHarry%20Styles%20-%20Medicine%3A%0A%20%0AKesha%20-%20WooHoo%3A%0A%20%0AKim%20Petras%20%26%20Paris%20Hilton%20-%20All%20She%20Wants%3A%0A%20%0ALady%20Gaga%20-%20Brooklyn%20Nights%3A%0A%20%0ALana%20Del%20Rey%20-%20Queen%20of%20Disaster%3A%0A%20%0ALana%20Del%20Rey%20-%20Serial%20Killer%3A%0A%20%0ALorde%20-%20Precious%20Metals%3A%0A%20%0AMadeon%20-%20Pop%20Culture%3A%0A%20%0AMariah%20Carey%20-%20I%20Feel%20It%3A%0A%20%0AMarina%20-%20I'm%20Not%20Hungry%20Anymore%3A%0A%20%0ASOPHIE%20%26%20Sarah%20Bonito%20-%20Burn%20Rubber%3A%0A%20%0ASlayyyter%20-%20Gimme%20More%3A%0A%20%0ASZA%20-%20Back%20Together%3A%0A%20%0ATaylor%20Swift%20-%20Let's%20Go%20%28Battle%29%3A%0A%20%0AThe%20Weeknd%20-%20Do%20It%3A%0A%20%0AUnknown%20Band%20-%20The%20Most%20Mysterious%20Song%20on%20the%20Internet%3A%0A%20%0AEND) and also below:

> Addison Rae - Nothing On (But The Radio): 11 ended fadga

* The following formats, or any format that does not match the above, will cause me headaches to correct, please do not use them:

> Kesha - WooHoo: (0) big time rush outsold

> Marina - I'm Not Hungry Anymore: 5/10. marina after finally being able to afford a quarter pounder:

> Taylor Swift - Let's Go (Battle): 1 - this song title is upsetting to me as a survivor of the great ticketmaster wars of 2022

* **All of the above songs are widely available on YouTube and SoundCloud, so I am anticipating this rate will remain fairly accessible despite its premise. That being said, if any of the above links get taken down for whatever reason over the course of this rate being open, please message me ASAP!!!**

This rate will be due on **DECEMBER 23, 2022 AT NOON EASTERN TIME** and will reveal IN FULL later that day. There will be no extensions considering this due date is almost as late as physically possible.

Once again, thank you all for voting this rate into existence, and best of luck to our contenders!
