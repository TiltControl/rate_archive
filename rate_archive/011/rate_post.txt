**Edit: Your scores are due at the end of the month!**

Ah, 2016. I remember it like it was yesterday. While the year will largely be remembered for what we lost (a shitload of celebrities, our faith in democracy, Mariah Carey's career, etc.), we're here to celebrate some amazing things we receieved, namely four solid albums from some of the biggest pop stars in the current zeitgeist. And what better way to do that than with a petty, dramatic subreddit game in which we pit all of them against each other? I've seen some complains about how it's problematiqué to compare successful women against each other, but I think the ultimate goal of these rates is to celebrate these albums, not to trash them in the sake of competition. We're here on this sub to have fun and appreciate the music, and these rates should reflect that. But on that note, let's introduce our competitors...

*Lemonade*: It was an April night. Beyonce had announced that she would be premiering ~something~ on HBO, and like any proper homosexual, I was perched on a shady streaming site as I waited for it to begin. A thread on /r/popheads was made (in which I have the most upvoted comment (#legendsonly)). And then...the stream was shortly taken down. For some furtive 30 minutes I tried to find another stream, from Periscope to Twitch, to no avail. I gave up and took a nap. And when I woke up, a Beyonce album had just been released, one that was both shockingly personal, sonically experimental, and damn catchy. Much has been written about *Lemonade*; go on virtually any review site, and you can read a lovely summation of its significance for the music industry/black women/life in general. The underlying narrative might all be bullshit (it wouldn't even be this year's [best story of infidelity](https://twitter.com/NatGeoChannel/status/794645411919065088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)), and it wouldn’t matter. *Lemonade* remains a masterpiece.

*Joanne*: Gaga’s comeback. The lead single may have flopped faster than you can say Ferrari, but *Joanne* was still a solid album that successfully obliterated the (toxic) ARTPOP-era Gaga image. To the critics, *Joanne* was a decent album whose main flaw was its exploitation of country music as a means of signifying authenticity while largely failing to engage with the genre in any meaningful way. To the general public, it was a surprise (since the last time Gaga was around was when she had a meat dress on) that a decent number of them would buy . To the little monsters, it was all **YAAAASS GAGA SLAY ME WITH THIS COUNTRY MUSIC YAAAAAASSSSSSSS**, with their only reference for country music being that copy of “Before He Cheats” rotting in their iTunes playlist. It’s not quite the Gaga we remember, but the album still feels uniquely hers. It’s a testament to her versatility as an artist that she transforms the concept of what “Gaga” sounds like with every release while still remaining true to herself.

*Anti*: After releasing three promotional singles, releasing a new fragrance, starring in an animated movie, making a soundtrack for said animated movie, releasing a designer sock line, going on multiple vacations, causing the mental breakdown of one of the producers, appearing on The Voice, dating Travis Scott, breaking up with Travis Scott, releasing the AntiDairy (a bizarre promotion campaign for the album that largely frustrated fans with its multiple delays and cryptic messages), announcing a world tour for an album not yet out, cancelling a Victoria’s Secret performance, and cancelling a Grammy’s performance, Rihanna released *Anti*, which was accidentally leaked early on Tidal and purchased 460 times, leading to a hilariously low debut, which was then followed by the release of one million free digital copies. The album’s pretty good.

*Glory*: For all intents and purposes, this album should have sucked. “Make Me,” a decent lead single with a tragic feature, aside, there was minimal promotion, the album cover was literally a screenshot from a video, and it was following the disasters that were *Britney Jean* and “Pretty Girls.” The Army was right to expect the worst from this album. Yet somehow, magically, inexplicably, unpredictably, it didn’t suck. In fact, it was quite good and generally considered to be one of Britney’s best. No, it wasn’t Britney’s *Lemonade*, but it was a solid, cohesive pop album that sounded fresh and very Britney-esque. And if you disagree...well, out of these four albums, it’s not the one with the lowest Metacritic score!

Because I'm petty, I'm also including ten bonus tracks of sorts that are optional to rate. These won't be a part of the actual rate, but most are tangentially related to these albums despite not appearing on their tracklists. The two other ones are by artists who were supposed to release an album this year, but didn't. Once again, these are OPTIONAL. You do not have to send in scores for these. Also, you can't use your 0 or 11 for these, so don't bother.

**Rules - PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS BEFORE SENDING ME YOUR SCORES!**

**SERIOUSLY, PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS, EVEN IF YOU'VE PARTICIPATED IN RATES BEFORE**

**PLEASE**

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two demical spots**: giving a 7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache. This is because I'm using a computer program to parse the votes and print everything out (more on that later).
* Yes, you have to listen to every song. I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program (more on that later). Every album besides Lemonade is on Spotify, and I've also provided a ton of Youtube links to help you. No excuses!
* If you're having trouble listening to Lemonade, PM me and I can hook you up with something.
* Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.
* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is ONE song total, **NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM**. You can't give these to the bonus tracks. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results.
* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.
* I am using a computer program that I designed in order to parse these votes! You can see it [here](https://github.com/jnlu/popheads/blob/master/popheads.py). While this will make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link at the bottom of this post. PLEASE USE THAT.** You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
* If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.
* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!


This is correct:

> Perfect Illusion: 1 What is this garbage!

These are INCORRECT:

> Perfect Illusion: 1: What is this garbage!

> Perfect Illusion: What is this garbage! 1

> Perfect Illusion: I'm giving this a 1 because it's garbage!

> Perfect Illusion: 1-What is this garbage!

> Perfect Illusion: 1 (What is this garbage!)

> Perfect Illusion: 1 - What is this garbage!

Whew, that was a lot. But we're done now. Have fun, and happy rating!
