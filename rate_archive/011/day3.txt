The 2016 Ultimate Album Rate, Day 3: Okay /r/popheads Now Let's Get In Formation
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5s8ilj/the_2016_ultimate_album_rate_day_3_okay_rpopheads/

The finale is here! Copying and pasting the notes once again:

* Follow along in the plug.dj! The link is [here](https://plug.dj/popheads/) if you've never been there. I'll be revealing songs there shortly before I post them here.

* I will start revealing songs at around 1:30pm EST. We'll begin with some bonus tracks before going on to the actual songs. I'm going from #10 to #1 today.

* I've included nearly everyone's comments, and I did my best to go through them and add cheeky responses and whatnot (please don't take them seriously). I wasn't able to do it for all of them though, and for that I apologize, but in my defense I didn't have much time to do the writeups.

* Controversy is a measure of how much voters disagreed. Think of it as an average of the differences between all of the scores. The average controversy was a 2.2, so anything above a 2.4 should be considered controversial.

* The average overall score was 7.1.

* I'll also be revealing the total points each song got. This is just a sum of everyone's scores (so it's equal to the average multiplied by the number of participants). I think this will be a good way of seeing how close some of these songs were.

* I'll also be revealing everyone's scores for every song, so none of you are safe from being exposed hihi.

And here's a recap of what's left:

Bey:

1. Hold Up
1. Sorry
1. 6 Inch ft. The Weeknd
1. Freedom ft. Kendrick Lamar
1. All Night
1. Formation

Rih:

1. Kiss It Better
1. Love on the Brain

Brit:

1. Slumber Party

Gags:

1. John Wayne

7. Love On The Brain - 9.137
8. Thinking Bout You - 8.824
9. Needed Me - 8.809
10. Slumber Party - 8.799

But if you take out Ariana, their top 10 was this:

1. Kiss It Better - 9.673
2. Formation - 9.637
3. All Night - 9.263
4. Sorry - 9.237
5. Love On The Brain - 9.137

7. Slumber Party - 8.799

Singing this on stage with the Dixie Chicks, one of the most wronged country acts in history? Adding in the part in "Long Time Gone" where the narrator bemoans the direction mainstream country music is going? This was a bit of shade, ladies. I think the CMAs were actively trying to seem more progressive and whatnot with this choice of a closing act. I mean, it pissed off their base, but they gave "Follow Your Arrow," a song explicitly in defense of smoking weed and being gay, their song of the year award not too long ago, so I think there was something of an agenda in this. But besides all of that, this remix is great. It's long as hell, but the four of them sound great together, like they're having the time of their lives as they sing about shooting men and whatnot. One of the best things to come out of 2016, imo.

While this isn't that bad, I'm glad this wasn't the direction Rih took with Anti. It sounds too folksy and the mixing is aggravating. Who is shrieking in the background during Kanye's part? It's so weird and not enjoyable.

**JoeThaMo**: "2 of my favorite artists collaborating with some no-name hobo who's probably just a huge fan of theirs, really warms my heart tbh"

**VodkaInsipido**: "THE LEFT OUT. I can't see all the backlash it got for being 'boring' for both Kanye and Rihanna and why it was left out by both artists. It could've worked as a bonus in ANTI or as post-Wolves track in TLOP."

**skiddos**: "vastly different song from Kanye and Rih, which I very much appreciate"

**Macubass**: "shouldve been a bigger hit"

**Rourke_**: "what's a black beatle anyway?"

**MrSwearword**: "Some of Rihanna’s best singing to date."

**dirdbub**: "this is honestly extremely mediocre, but it's kind of catchy. so there's at least SOMETHING to this song"

**omgcow**: "God damn this is boring"

**calltehshots**: "One of the best songs of that year and she should’ve at least put it as a bonus track on ANTI"

**eribertknows**: "Anything with Kanye and Rihanna is an immediate 10 don't argue with me on this."

**havanabrown**: "So many annoying sounds and vocals in this song"

**superr_rad**: "Kanye, Rihanna, Paul Mccartney, THEY FUCKIN DID THAT. ICONIC."

**soeri**: "this is the shit you show to your one snobby friend that's like NO ONE MAKES REAL MUSIC ANYMORE. bitch rihanna invented country."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Beautiful song and collab, Rihanna slays her vocals, Kanye is a surprisingly good duet partner, and Paul is a legend. It’s so perfectly world weary and emotional and I kinda wish she had done more in this kind of sound."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Rihanna does minimalism amazing, but as good as this track is, I don't really see a place for it on the final edition of ANTI"

**bliamc**: "Mostly good because it is the strangest trio the pop world could have imagined"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "It's a very bizarre collabration but I thought this song worked well. We get to hear the best of Rihanna's and Kanye's vocals here in track."

**Death_Soup**: "Decent song but forgettable imo"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Out of all the possible outcomes for a Rihanna feat. Paul McCartney and Kanye track, this isn't so bad. The first Kanye verse is pretty unneeded, but I do like the second one. It's kind of a weird song to chart so high, but it's Rihanna so it's not all surprising."

**SkyBlade79**: "I think that this song is entirely overrated. It’s boring, her voice is kind of grating, and even though Kanye shines, the flaws in this song outweigh everything else. It was nice of them to give this “paul mccartney” guy a chance, but he’s obviously never going to amount to much at this rate."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Not the best song, but Riri's vocals are good."

**alternativeoxygen**: "underappreciated track from when rihanna was torturing us."

**JohnnyToby**: "actually this is the worst song ever"

**eklxtreme**: "rihanna's bridge is the best part, i like the intricate folky guitar strumming from paul"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "No idea what the fuck that weird screeching is in the back of Kanye's verse, (the same dying dog sound from Work From Home?) but other than that it's fine."

Yes, this bop. The first reminder we received as a society that Rihanna wasn't losing her touch after the Unapologetic era. The ending is also some of the most strangely beautiful stuff I've ever heard, and the fact that's it's coming from the most unlikely source makes it all the better. Also this was the #1 rated song overall for forever which was kind of funny.

---

**VodkaInsipido**: "This should have been in ANTI, even as a bonus track. The production is good, the lyrics are good and it's pretty cool too."

**skiddos**: "this deserved to be on Anti smh"

**Macubass**: "yayo"

**MrSwearword**: "I’ve loved this since release."

**jackcs903**: "Not really sure why this wasn't included on ANTI tbh"

**mgglite**: "if this was on anti i'd like it a lot more"

**dirdbub**: "now THIS is a quality, certified banger. the music video is fucking glorious as well"

**omgcow**: "This is AMAZING and I wanted this to be on the album so bad, and I wish the album had more of this bad bitch sound"

**calltehshots**: "Garbage but garbage that warms my heart. (i ~calltehshotshotshots~)"

**havanabrown**: "I never really thought much of this song but it’s kinda catchy"

**soeri**: "iconic mv iconic lyrics iconic boss ass bitch anthem"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This is a BANGER. Rihanna has never sounded harder on a song and the beat is fire. It’s so quotable too. Would have been my 11 if it was in the rate."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "This track is hard hitting, gritty, a freaking banger, it definitely could have fit on the main album somewhere, or even as one of the deluxe tracks"

**bliamc**: "Even if it’s dumb, BBHMM is a lot of fun"

**Awhile2**: "this would get my 11 if I could give it to it. Theres just so many things to love about it. The outro reminds me of Death Grips. The production is so rich (which of course itll be when you have Travis, Ye, Wondagurl all helping out). The kick and subbass are so satisfying. Rihanna is at her baddest here. “your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car” like goddamn. This is tied with Shut Up and Drive for my favorite Rihanna song"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I am really sad this song wasn't even part of the ANTI bonus tracks because fucking damn, this song is just iconic thanks to Kanye's production and Riri's sassiness. Needed Me fills in the missing BBHMM void in ANTI and the song makes more sense within the album's context though so it's fine."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Man, I wish there was a way this could've been on the album. It's a truly fierce track, one that manages to use some of the strong trap-influenced drums to compliment Rihanna's fervor, and it's fantastic. Paired with an accompanying music video that really sets the stage for the track, and you have a hell of a loose single."

**SkyBlade79**: "She sounds like someone that you NEVER want to mess with. This song is a bit of a mess but it’s a great mess, and should’ve been on Anti."

**chihuahuazero**: "It’s a shame that this single didn’t make Anti, as it would’ve fit well."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Another guilty pleasure. I don't know if it's good, per sem but Rihanna kicks so much ass."

**eklxtreme**: "the instrumental is great stuff but her verses and the chorus kinda annoy me"

**-dolantello-**: "One of the best songs of 2015. BEAT SWITCH AT THE END IS GODLIKE"

**ImADudeDuh**: "I really don't like this at all."

My favorite track from last year. I'mma get really into it so buckle up babes. This section of the film where Sorry comes in is called Apathy, and as the song begins it seems to be representing that idea, as Beyonce sings about clubbing and enjoying herself and whatnot. Yet the more she says 'I ain't thinkin bout you,' the less believable her words are, and it becomes clear that her husband's infidelity is still gnawing at the back of her head. Then she starts singing about sucking on her balls and saying boy bye and all those catchy lines, which further disproves the idea that she's apathetic, but as the song ends she steadily grows more vulnerable. She's hurt. She regrets her marriage. She's trying to get revenge and run away, but it no longer sounds joyful and cathartic. Her heart is broken, and her attempt to be apathetic and carefree and to have fun was all for naught. Of course there's also great meme potential in the song, namely Serena Williams dropping it low like rent is due in the music video, as well as the #iconic #BeckyWithTheGoodHair. Poor Rachael Ray, she just wanted to cook us those 30 minute meals.

---

**JoeThaMo**: "I really liked this one when I first heard, but it got old old very quickly..."

**VodkaInsipido**: "Congratulations Jay, you played yourself. Also, this is my most played track this year and you should know why: it's mad catchy, has shock value in the first listen, it's enjoyable and has a lot of replay value. ps: 'suck on my balls'"

**skiddos**: "the instrumental starts off well, then the actual song starts…"

**Macubass**: "didnt get the hype about this song"

**mokitsu**: "The production here is insane, the breakdown at the end is one of my favorite musical moments of the year!!!!"

**MrSwearword**: "Beyonce throws away her vocal talent and that fucking enrages me. Even worse, the beat change which barely worked for the Black Eyed Peas. Also worth noting, this is the song about Jay cheating on her with Rih…I mean “Rachel Roy” [like Solange didn’t already Chun-Li his ass in the elevator for that.]"

**JunkyGS**: "STOP INTERRUPTING MY GRINDING (of getting this rate done and typing 9k letters worth of words / 1,500 words so far )"

**MihaMijat**: "Revived Jay just to slay him again"

**enecks**: "This song may not be the best song in Lemonade, but is the one that sums up what I like about it the most. It manages to capture the anger as well as the sadness that come with a breakup. Yet, even though Beyoncé is feeling all these emotions, she still is absolutely in control. A modern masterpiece."

**estreindre**: "still good, but feels really repetitive imo, i wish the song did more to shake up the production instead of a simple beat."

**omgcow**: "I just don’t love this one, it feels meh to me."

**calltehshots**: "Yes, give Wynter Gordon a hit!!!"

**Palutzel**: "it's messy, nope, maybe i'm too white 4 beyonce (jk)"

**TonyRealm**: "The lyrics themselves are quite harsh (“suck on my balls” is line of the year), but the bouncy synth sequences, faint drum beats, and laid-back vocal delivery (esp. the verses and the backing vocals) make the track sound peppy and upbeat. The whole untroubled “you don’t faze me” vibe, I mean how badass is that."

**banananaise**: "Okay the song was whatever but black and white Egyptian Pharaoness Bey gives me life"

**havanabrown**: "Fun song, solid beat, enjoyable to listen to"

**spacebabe27**: "Never thought Beyonce would tell me to suck her balls but I will oblige in the only manner I know how."

**superr_rad**: "This is like Boy Problems 2.0 to me. Boy, bye."

**soeri**: "i love this song but im white so i cant sing it"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "You know that thing Drake does where he says these corny, quotable lines that are obviously trying to create memes? Beyonce does the same thing here and it’s just as corny imo. The beat sounds unfinished too."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I AINT SAH"

**bliamc**: "BECKY WITH THE GOOD HAIR. MIDDLE FINGERS IN THE AIR. ICONIC ALL THE WAY AROUND. YONCÉ IS TAKING NO PRISONERS"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "lmao remember when the beyhive was trying to figure out who becky was and some of them went after rachael ray"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Nah"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "If I am going to break up with someone and want to be a THOT, this would be my theme song."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "yeah you better apologise"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Best kiss off song. Also sad as fuck."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "what a fantastic fucking song. So beautiful and smart and sad. Her voice when she says “I'll fly away” makes me so wistful."

**mother_rucker**: "This song was actually a conspiracy to get deluded stans to drag Rachel Ray on Instagram."

**Wailordfan**: "Kinda a very meh song until the last 45 seconds or so."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Iconic track. Drums are on point. Vocals are great. My only issue with it is it doesn't feel like it's as different from the stuff on her self-titled, outside of the subject matter."

**femaleghostbuster**: "'Suck my balls' -Beyonce Knowles"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Bad Bitch Banger. Beckies Better Beware."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "singing this to my mum next time she yells at me for not making my bed"

**SkyBlade79**: "Certainly an interesting song. It’s like so carefree, but then it has such harsh lyrics, such as that one ball sucking line. The production is really nice, and the spoken word parts are also interesting."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "This is the catchiest song on the album, and a real fun one. Although maybe it’s not so fun, the song is about her boyfriend (husband in real life) going back to her after cheating. But maybe it's fun because she's gotten over him. I dunno."

**Therokinrolla**: "Ugh this song really is so good. “Becky with the good hair” is a whore, whoever she is because there is so much pain behind it when she says it the final time like goddamn."

**huntyphobic**: "This song gets tired if you listen to it too many times, but the Becky with the good hair line still leaves me snatched, gagged, discomposed, dragged, de-wigged, bamboozled, and shook after every listen."

**SpanKKy1**: "Copied Bieber"

**leviOHsa**: "“Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicks.” Are you fucking kidding me? SLAY BITCH. This song bangs and everyone knows it."

**seferre2**: "SUCK MY BALLS but also i don't understand how this charted so high it's not that great"

**blue_charles**: "A solid track, but I'm not super wild about it. It feels like it overstays it's welcome just a little bit, and it never really clicks entirely for me in the first place"

**eklxtreme**: "production is pretty nice"

**joshually**: "Ah the infamous 'good hair' song. Sorry is literally one giant quiltbag of hashtags, twitter character limits, memes and tumblr urls mushed together. Boy bye."

**snidelaughter**: "The breakdown in the middle is one of the best moments to happen in pop music in a while. It's hard to establish command with softness, but Beyoncé pulls it off with ease. As for the rest of the song? Catch me at my funeral, middle fingers up. I ain't sorry."

**Yatcho**: "The closest thing to her previous discography, this song completely bops and is the centerpiece to this album. Becky with the Good Hair is completely iconic"

**veryunfinished**: "second most iconic song of 2016!"

**Willybae00**: "A highlight of Lemonade. I’d give it an 8 if it didn’t have the iconic becky with the good hair lyrics tbh"

**twat_brained**: "Say what you will about 'Sorry', but you can't deny its cultural impact in 2016. #notbecky"

Yay, it’s my first starter! (yes I did start in Johto). Despite that, it didn’t get my 11 because Snivy’s just too… perfect. Ngl Cynd is actually my real **favorite starter**, but I think the nostalgia might be a big factor. Also, all of its evolutionary line looks SO cute, but colorfully it looks kinda uninteresting. Still, Cyndaquil deserves to be in Top 5 and be the only Fire-type that’s in the Top 10 lmao.


letsallpoo, says “it got so ugly when it evolved” and estreindre: “soooo booooring”. Like, a cute-ass mouse thing with a volcano thingy on its back? boring? huh?


But on the contrary to every user comment above, TeamAwesome4 describes Cyndaquil as “the only starter where I really adore all 3 evolutions, and all in different ways.” Therokinrolla says “this thing is so cute idc if it sets my house on fire gd”. I can relate tbh.


Finally, BearlyEvenAPun says there was “a lot of tough competition for the 11, but ultimately it would have to go to cyndiquil. it was my go to for the first two mystery dungeon games so I've grown attached to it.”

Taking a description typically used to empower (for lack of a better word) men, but flipping it so it's a signifier for female strength instead. It's a good song, and The Weeknd fucking kills it, but it just seems kind of pointless in the context of the album. (And I'm lowkey pressed it made it this far.) Like, Sorry already did what this song did and better imo. I thought she mostly included it because it would obviously go top 10, but then she never released it. C'mon, Bey, you know this would probably smash. Or at least do better than half of your other flop singles.

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Honestly, I think Abel completely overshadows Bey in this track, which is unfortunate."

**BionicFunhouse**: "Meh"

**VodkaInsipido**: "The beat reminds me of Hell of a Life, and that must be good. The Weeknd kills it once again."

**Macubass**: "its decent"

**mokitsu**: "The only flaw about this song is The Weeknd's verse. The 'come back's are the end are chilling"

**MrSwearword**: "That Isaac Hayes sample does wonders as does The Weeknd’s vocals. Beyonce herself? Well, she’s getting better with her lower register on the chorus."

**mgglite**: "i thought i finished listening to anti"

**holly_foxxy**: "this song is pretty good... I just get bored..."

**ProphecyPizza**: "QUEEN OF STRIPPING im sorry this song is so good"

**dirdbub**: "hollyyy FUCKKKKKKK BEY AND ABEL JUST FUCK ME UP EVERY TIME THIS COMES ON, THIS IS SOO GOOOOOOOODDDDD"

**JunkyGS**: "Clear highlight for me and one of her best songs. It's sultry, catchy, powerful, hype and vocals are great."

**enecks**: "Most underrated track on the album. This could’ve easily been a top 10 hit if IT WAS A FUCKING SINGLE WHAT THE FUCK IT EVEN HAS THE WEEKND."

**omgcow**: "Super sexy, one of the highlights of the album for me."

**calltehshots**: "This makes me feel like an high class international escort and that’s an instant 10"

**eribertknows**: "Thank Abel for this."

**Palutzel**: "'it's R&B, yaas' never have i ever said that"

**TonyRealm**: "From the start to the finish, this song is phenomenal. Female badass-style lyrics are pretty standard for Beyoncé, but she also shows a vulnerable side, delicately repeating “come back”. Her vocals range from those soaring, tender moments in the outro to the chorus, where they’re low and processed but ooze attitude. Add that rumbling beat and Abel’s smooth feature and you’ve got my favorite song in this rate."

**havanabrown**: "The mixture of the almost grandiose sound with the simple beats was an interesting and effective combination"

**spacebabe27**: "God bless this combination."

**superr_rad**: "Def thought 6 inch was gonna reference penis size. This bops"

**soeri**: "deserved that single"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Abel is the best part, which is terrible cause he gets like 20 seconds and it ends up being kind of a pointless feature. Guess Bey didn’t wanna get shown up on her own song 👀 Seriously though I’d give this an 8 at least if it was a Weeknd ft. Beyonce song, especially since it sounds more in his style, which makes sense since he wrote it"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Really with the two artists on this track, it should've been a lot more than it actually was"

**bliamc**: "This song would have been a lot better without The Weeknd, he brings nothing to this track. I mostly love the end to this track, the third verse and final chorus and outro are emotional and heartbreaking and beautiful. When Bey sings “Comeback, Comeback, Comeback” in a whisper, it just hurts your soul."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Nah"

**Awhile2**: "as much as i love the weeknd, i feel like the first half of this song drags the second half of it down"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The horror-inspired production of this song and Weeknd's vocals are amazing. And that's basically it sadly. Also gave this song a 6 for the memes lol xD"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i expected this song to be about dick, gravely disappointed"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "The Weeknd completely ruins everything I swear"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "i'd love for abel to feature my 6 inches . Thought there was a miyazaki reference in this song, disappointed."

**mother_rucker**: "You’re lying if you say this song doesn’t make you feel like a badass bitch. Like I just want to put on some Louboutins and kick a fuccboi in the face."

**Wailordfan**: "I don't love Abel's voice in general all that much, but I actually didn't mind it here. Plus, Beyonce's parts were top notch (I mean, they almost always are, but DAYUM)."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I know the reception on this song is that it's filler, but I love it. The Weeknd may do his normal thing, but it's more than welcome. What makes 6 Inch for me is the second half of the song, which heavily samples Animal Collective's My Girls. It's both a perfect interpolation of the lyrics as well as its own spin on them that make the something damn good."

**Reifiui**: "She may have murdered everybody with her album but she could have also murdered THE CHARTS HAD SHE RELEASED THIS AS A SINGLE COME ON IT HAS THE WEEKND THIS IS SUCH AN OBVIOUS CHOICE"

**berober04**: "Abel isn't the one to put me in the worst mood about this song."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "The album's lowest point, for sure. kind of sad that this collab didn't create something better."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "slay me with this energy"

**SkyBlade79**: "The Weeknd is an absolute god in this song. Everything about it is really great; the tone, that HARD production, the lyrics, and both of their voices. Beyonce’s “I’m tired of this shit” voice is amazing."

**chihuahuazero**: "Those Janelle Monae vibes in the outro. (Praise our mod /u/janellemonae!)"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Big Weeknd fan here, but I don’t really like this song as much as others."

**Zugtris**: "goat middle-eight"

**misguidedzombie**: "Love her use of her lower range."

**Therokinrolla**: "The Weeknd was a great addition here, the chorus is stupid sexy, and I LOVE that this is dedicated to strippers basically."

**huntyphobic**: "Should’ve had another verse imo, still great tho."

**SpanKKy1**: "Half the size of my penis"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This song sounds really slick and really sexy."

**JohnnyToby**: "deserves the Grammy"

**seferre2**: "this song has always confused me"

**blue_charles**: "I would pay Beyonce to step on my face. And oh yeah, the Weeknd is here too"

**VioletChutzkee**: "I'm not buying what Bey's selling here. The beat bangs tho"

**eklxtreme**: "pretty epic sounding, the hip-hop production works well here"

**joshually**: "The most Weeknd song the Weeknd never released. Beyonce is basically covering this song."

**snidelaughter**: "An unstoppable force meets an immovable object. This is the end result."

**veryunfinished**: "this song is probably my favorite part of lemonade the film because i'm a sucker for red lighting. the song is far from my favorite but i still think the beat is good. i like the weeknd and i'm not going to pretend i understand why he's commercially successful. he sounds good on this."

**Willybae00**: "The arrangement sounds like maybe it would fit Rihanna or Tinashe’s voice better but even then, the song is OK"

**twat_brained**: "Bey coming in with them low notes!"

**ImADudeDuh**: "I didn't really like this at first, but after a few listens, this is fucking awesome"

Ah yes, the weird moment in the album where you fully realize that all of this is about forgiveness and not about stabbing your husband and burning your bedroom down. A beautiful track for sure, but it's a bit long winded for me. I'll never understand why she released this a single. Or why this is in the top 10 tbh.

---

**JoeThaMo**: "KISS UP AND RUB UP AND FEEL UP ON YA"

**VodkaInsipido**: "This is it. It's a ballad, but it's raw. It's about coming back to her old love disappointed, but wishing to get better. The final exorsice in LEMONADE it's about forgiving and having mercy."

**skiddos**: "those TRUMPETS!! :weary: :weary:"

**Macubass**: "meh"

**mokitsu**: "The perfect album closer (kinda), this song is so smooth and always puts me in a great mood."

**Rourke_**: "L U S H"

**MrSwearword**: "Beyonce half asses the chorus so much and it pisses me off. The thudding drum and overall production work salvages this like you wouldn’t believe."

**gannade**: "cathartic, euphoric, divine. always makes me happy :)"

**mgglite**: "ok we're back to singing songs that belong at funerals again"

**dirdbub**: "this is my least favorite Lemonade song :( I mean it's still a 7, but this is not something I ever listen to on the regular"

**JunkyGS**: "Most avg / eh song on the album. Like it makes me feel nothing positive or negative."

**enecks**: "Some songs take me to a magical and relaxing place. This is one of them. also the lyrics are good I guess"

**estreindre**: "drags on a little bit, but overall pretty great!"

**Palutzel**: "yeah, it's good, but no more than that"

**TonyRealm**: "It’s not the most fiery or moving, but it’s a happy track with a killer horn sample."

**havanabrown**: "Those high notes are angelic"

**spacebabe27**: "WHY THE FUCK WASNT THIS A SINGLE, BECAUSE ITS SO GOOD."

**superr_rad**: "GOD THE HORNS!!! I LOVE HORNS!!!!!!"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I wouldn’t mind if the album ended at this song, it’s such a perfect climax of everything coming before it, great soaring vocals from Bey and some really nice instrumentation and production."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Yeah remember how I mentioned the easy 10? This is it"

**bliamc**: "Uplifting and emotional, the song that tells you that there’s strength in reconciliation"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Yah"

**Awhile2**: "this might sound weird af but i always imagined this as being the nighttime companion of Hold Up which was like the daytime song or something i dont know"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is a very underwhelming closer to an otherwise excellent album."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "at first i considered it a bit of an anticlimax but then the fast flow lines hit and it snatched me"

**Bannerww**: "if I could I would give it a 10 I would, the best song on Lemonade"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "God her album is so good."

**mother_rucker**: "This song is the perfect end to the emotional journey Beyoncé just took us on. She ends it with redemption and love and forgiveness."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Sounds like heaven. Honestly. All Night is a beautiful beautiful track and there's not much to say here besides that Diplo goes in."

**Reifiui**: "I almost wish that Formation wasn't on the album because this is an amazing closer, it's majestic, soaring, uplifing and fucking incredible"

**femaleghostbuster**: "So beautiful, without being cheesy or melodramatic."

**Raykel**: "Those horns; what an amazing use of a sample. This song is full of hope and healing. Whether her story of Jay Z cheating is real or not, it's a brilliant closure to it because I think a lot of people can pull from this song and learn how to heal from their story too."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Overshadowed by the songs that envelop it, All Night is still a nice song. But the placement within the album is pretty shit for a just nice song."

**SkyBlade79**: "A great song of redemption, and a fitting closer."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "I’m curious does somebody want to find out how many times the word “lie” or “lies” has been said in all four of these albums because I imagine it’s a lot."

**Therokinrolla**: "she good"

**huntyphobic**: "Too long but v sweet. It’s like the 1+1 of this album, slightly generic but the message of unconditional love is cute."

**SpanKKy1**: "How long I would fuck Shawn for"

**JohnnyToby**: "her writers are kings of bass (and songwriting in generallll)"

**ExtraEater**: "My favorite song and music video on Lemonade. I'm on time constraints so I can't fully explain why all you just need to know is is that it's GOOD"

**blue_charles**: "Meh."

**VioletChutzkee**: "The Spottieottiedopalicious sample makes my heart soar."

**eklxtreme**: "the instrumentation gives it a nice mellow vibe, trumpets are nice, catchy melody"

**joshually**: "The title is how long it felt to get through listening to this song."

**snidelaughter**: "This is the second best song Beyoncé has ever made. Guess the best. Hint: not on this album. Honestly, I can't say anything else about this song. It's just amazing."

**-dolantello-**: "Favourite song on Lemonade. Love the summery vibes, love the Outkast sample, love the lyrics, love Bey's vocals"

**veryunfinished**: "this song is so beautiful. it reminds me a lot of 4, which makes sense i guess because this is about forgiveness and 4 was about falling in love. i love the instrumentation on this, the horns especially."

**twat_brained**: "It is rather good for the penultimate song of the album. It feels like a purer 'Drunk in Love'."

**ImADudeDuh**: "There's something hypnotic about the static-ish 'all night, all night' in the chorus"

One of the catchiest songs on Joanne, and the intro is great. It goes a bit overboard with the whole western cowboy thing, but I think that's part of the fun of the song. This was the first song that I really loved when the album came out, but even still I'm surprised y'all voted this as the best song on the album. Ah well, a bop's a bop.

--- 

**JoeThaMo**: "Underappreciated bop, this goes even harder than both A-Yo and Dancin' In Circles imo"

**melisanyans**: "slutty cowgirl realness! This should have been more of the album."

**Macubass**: "bop"

**mokitsu**: "Although it's cringy to hear Lady Gaga sing 'Too lit tonight' it's still a good pop song and one of the only tracks that didn't age like bread."

**MrSwearword**: "So if the FarmersOnly demographic wanted a song just for them? UGH; also, what the fuck does “Strung out on John Wayne” mean? This is bad."

**chubs4life**: "I know a John and he's hot and all I wanna do is ask if he could go 'A LITTLE BIT FASTER!?' In a crazy af tone. Maybe one day."

**JamesTheGent**: "I want to drive a car at 150 mph when I listen to this."

**dirdbub**: "this is one of the best songs on the album. so fucking GOOD"

**JunkyGS**: "Only song Gaga doesn't take herself too seriously & really lets herself have fun on the record."

**enecks**: "This is really enjoyable. It has a nice momentum to it."

**estreindre**: "WHY AREN'T PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THIS SONG MORE IT'S SO FUCKING GOOD HOLY SHIT. THIS is the huge bop on the album, not A-YO. this song is absolutely incredible."

**omgcow**: "This is pretty sexy, I like it"

**MariahGr8rThnJesus**: "hey um gaga its like ino its bad but like um like can u just stfu"

**Palutzel**: "EARGASM, this is real pop"

**TonyRealm**: "Stylistically, this is A-YO’s cousin. The pace is slower but more volatile, and that outro solo is just so cool."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Literally everything about this is inventive, flawless."

**havanabrown**: "It's like, I just love this song you know, I'm just like, I just I know it's good, but I'm like can I just give this song my 11 and can it win the RATE??"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "only good song so far"

**spacebabe27**: "Such a sleazy sounding club track and I love it. This doesn't have much of a country influence sonically, but it has that dirty, gritty spirit that country is supposed to embody."

**superr_rad**: "This is super funky!!"

**soeri**: "so baby pull me closer in the backseat of your horse"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "One of four tracks that I liked INSTANTLY"

**bliamc**: "That guitar solo make this song worth it"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "too short tbh"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I don’t love the opening, but after that it’s fun."

**Awhile2**: "This hook and bridge is the most Josh Homme sounding thing on this album and i love it"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I love this song but the 'I am sick of their city games' is quite ironic considering Gaga is a very city girl. If I were to sing this song, the song would be re-worked on being about Chris Pratt cause argh, I am such a thristy hoe."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "CAN YOU GO A LITTLE FASTER?!?!?!"

**Bannerww**: "can we go a little FASTER!?"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "Everything I love about Gaga."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "not bad at all"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "awful. Holy shit i hate this song so much."

**mother_rucker**: "“I need it to be obvious that this is a country-inspired album, let me name a song after a Western movie hero so people understand” – Lady Gaga, probably"

**Wailordfan**: "Imagine if this was done during the ARTPOP era? I imagine her literally riding a mechanical bull with some kind of dildos for horns or something, cause A R T P O P."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Really strong song, with the intro, chorus, pre-chorus, and bridge all managing to be pretty great. 'I'm strung out on John Wayne' is a perfect compliment to that country instrumental."

**qetaz**: "Bop. Can you go a little FASTER!?"

**Reifiui**: "I listened to this song too many times and now I'm sexually attracted to John Wayne help"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Can this rate gO A LITTLE FASTER?"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "I could see a good superbowl performance with this tbh"

**SkyBlade79**: "The pitched and cut vocals in the chorus frames Gaga's plea of 'Baby let's get high/ John Wayne!'. Ronson and BloodPop really go all out in the production on this track to make it sound like something that you might hear on a jukebox at a western bar, other than the hook; it's certainly not a bad sound. Since I first heard this, it’s grown on me so much, and I love it now."

**chihuahuazero**: "The beat can be iffy, but it’s one of those songs that make the middle of an album solid."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Interesting one."

**Therokinrolla**: "I will sit down and argue that this is one of Gaga’s best songs ever. Definitely top 10, probably top 5, this song features one of the catchiest choruses I’ve ever heard that is impossible to sing. Only complaint is that it is too short."

**huntyphobic**: "I have to glue down my wig before listening to this song bc Gaga always snatches it when she speeds up that horse smh 😤😤😤"

**SpanKKy1**: "Who?"

**leviOHsa**: "Absolute favourite on the album. This song is like a religious experience, and if we had a few more songs that went this direction I think it would be a more exciting album."

**JohnnyToby**: "this is like the opposite of Joanne where the verses are amazing but the chorus is missing something to make it a great song"

**seferre2**: "i'm sorry this song sucks"

**blue_charles**: "Yes. YES. YES THIS SONG THO. Ngl, ever since the Victoria's Secret show my gay ass struts the motherfucking house down to this song."

**eklxtreme**: "the vocal sample is cool, slide guitar is on point (bless Josh Homme!)"

**joshually**: "The most unsexy song about a Sex icon since Mariah sang 'Here Comes Santa Claus'."

**snidelaughter**: "Alejandro, but not as good."

**Yatcho**: "Finally some good energy. If she insists on doing the Americana, soft rock thing at least make it fun.Make this the next single Gaga!!"

**veryunfinished**: "the production in the chorus is good but it feels kinda weird, since she's really Singing and the production is not that energetic."

**Willybae00**: "This was my favorite song off the album but I don't think it was up to Gaga's standards"

**twat_brained**: "I never knew I needed another Teeth in my life until now."

**ImADudeDuh**: "I would've like this more if it weren't for the intro"

**ExtraEater**: "Serious Comment/Writeup; And as we barrel off of the wonderful ballad that was Joanne (which was probably already revealed so you saw my serious, adoring writeup for it), we find that Joanne still has it in her to create some bops. Now lyrically and structurally, this is generally already a good, catchy track. But in terms of style, I think this song is nothing short of genius. It definitely has the Joanne-style western aesthetic but it wonderfully mixes it with the same pop electric style we've originally been waiting for from Joanne. Also, like I mentioned in the beginning, this came after the emotional title track to remind us that Gaga still has it in her to make a bop (if A-YO didn't already do that for you)"

One of my earliest memories related to Lemonade is hearing it being blasted at some party as I sat in my dorm room trying to do homework. It was on repeat for like 30 minutes, but even though it was kind of annoying, I was still bopping along tbh. It's been done to death what a Frankenstein of a track this is, being made up of parts coming from Soulja Boy, Father John Misty, Diplo, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, on and on and on. For all I know I probably have a writing credit on this track as well. But nothing about it sounds like it was spliced together; it flows beautifully, if sinisterly. Truly more than the sum of its parts.

---

**VodkaInsipido**: "B O P. The horns strangely remind me to MLG parodies. Also I need a remix with Countdown like the one in the VMAs."

**melisanyans**: "This song could have charted if she tried to make it. But she didn't."

**Macubass**: "meh"

**mokitsu**: "Okay so PYCM hadn't quite made me shook, Hold Up changed it! Beyoncé served the hottest rap verse of the year right here!"

**Rourke_**: "I like how happy the music sounds while Beyonce threatens to fuck her up a bitch."

**MrSwearword**: "BEST. TRACK. FROM. LEMONADE."

**chubs4life**: "What should've been her 6th number 1."

**mgglite**: "if there were no airhorns i'd probably give it an 8, also there's some very questionable lyrics in there"

**ProphecyPizza**: "truly iconic"

**dirdbub**: "she is just COMING AT JAY for this shit. 'imagine if you never made a name for yourself' gurl go FUCKING AT HIM LET'S GOOO"

**JunkyGS**: "Really fresh sounding and carries over that emotional weight that PYCM dropped on us."

**MihaMijat**: "Ended Jay-Z"

**enecks**: "A song that grew on me immensely, thanks to some well-crafted lyrics and an excellent hook. Even the airhorns are good."

**estreindre**: "A FUCKING BOP this song is sooooo good and i'm surprised it's not getting more attention on the album. also the airhorns in the background make me giggle everytime i start the song."

**omgcow**: "There’s something about this that really bothers me, I think it’s the tropical-ish production but I can’t put my finger on it. The chorus kinda bugs me too. Lyrically tho it’s a slay"

**calltehshots**: "Too iconic, I'm again shook"

**Joebiekong**: "Hate the horn and her singing here"

**Palutzel**: "it's catchy and it sounds nice, but the beat is too repetitive for me"

**TonyRealm**: "Bey what the flying fuck is that outro."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Insanely catchy, literally impossible not to sing along to it. -1 because a song with air horns can never get a ten."

**havanabrown**: "“I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'm a fuck me up a bitch” ICONIC"

**spacebabe27**: "An absolute, understated banger that I am 100% here for. The second best song about an angry woman confronting a man that cheated on her."

**superr_rad**: "This song is so perfectly mixed it’s beautiful. Like how does that air horn fit in so perfectly? Perfect."

**soeri**: "the lyrics are amazing but holy shit i hate this song"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "BOP. The bouncy, kinda dancehall-ish beat actually kinda reminds me of the Famous outro but slowed down, and the song is soooo quotable. The real MVP though isn’t Bey, it’s Soulja Boy."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Should've been the song of the summer, hopefully Beyoncé can focus a little more on single marketing again soon"

**bliamc**: "THEY DON’T LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE YOU It’s such a simple song"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "im coming @ everyone who scores this low with a bat tbh"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Nah"

**Awhile2**: "this is about as perfect as a song can get. So many iconic lines (i dont wanna lose my pride but imma fuck me up a bitch), the smash mouth sounding production, the airhorn, the incorporation of the soulja boy and yeah yeah yeahs songs. Just so many elements coming together to make an amazing track."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "There is something very unique about this song, especially the chrous itself in which is written by Ezra Koenig and Diplo. I feel like the chrous perfectly sums up the themes of the song (and the album actually.)"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i had to go back in the video because i couldn't believe there were airhorns. the worst vandalism in this video was that of my eardrums."

**Death_Soup**: "I love the instrumental to this. Very nice song, one of the best on the album."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Invented turning swag on"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "beyonce singing that hook"

**Wailordfan**: "Baseball bat and yellow dress is my forever aesthetic"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oh man, here's my 11. One of my favorite tracks of 2016, this was the standout of Lemonade for me. The track was produced by Diplo and Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig, and written in part by Father John Misty. It shows, and though the chorus is simple, there's so much weight behind 'What's worse? looking jealous or crazy, jealous and crazy?/Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately/I'd rather be crazy'. And with the perfect bridge, the song manages to be the perfect blend of absolutely batshit insane samples (Andy Williams, Soulja Boy, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Beyoncé's own style. It's conventional but unique, and I just can't get enough of it."

**qetaz**: "I can't help but bop to this"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Great song with GOAT mv."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "I was a bit iffy on this to begin with then I heard it so much on AUS radio and now hold up they don’t love u like I love u"

**SkyBlade79**: "I can’t hear this without thinking of Kermit the Frog singing it. Regardless, it’s a pretty great song. The lyrics are really great as well."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "AAAIIIRRRHHOOOORRRNNNNSSS"

**Therokinrolla**: "invented explosions entirely unconnected to what you are actually hitting with a baseball bat"

**huntyphobic**: "meme horns"

**SpanKKy1**: "I'm gonna hold up Beyonce at gunpoint until she puts Lemonade on Spotify"

**seferre2**: "this song is so bouncy? and fun"

**ExtraEater**: "I just love the music video for this. Beyonce just doesn't care and the production on the mv is just so clean everything feels so HIGH QUALITY"

**blue_charles**: "YAAAASSSSS"

**VioletChutzkee**: "Ezra's tweet's impact! A really cute song."

**eklxtreme**: "the combination of subtle reggae and trap production, yeah yeah yeahs, and soulja boy doesn't really work for me"

**joshually**: "This song is so sassy I can't hardly stand it I swear. The sample is genius and the bullhorn gives me life. Her deep range is jarring, much like being hit over the head with a baseball bat powered by the force of passionate hate."

**snidelaughter**: "This subdued anger is missing from pop and I wish this song did so much better than it did. Although, now that I remember the VMA performance, I so wish this faded into Countdown like it did then, but I digress."

**veryunfinished**: "i love this song. if there was ever a beyonce song tailor made to me, it’s this one: the soulja boy interpolation, the ezra koenig credits, carribbean influence that isn’t stifling. she sampled the drums from countdown in this which is such an iconic move."

**Willybae00**: "My favorite song from the album, mainly because “Hold up!..” gets stuck in my head out of nowhere while I am minding my own business. It’s just a great song to sing along to."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "if you ever feel like hating yourself you should watch the gnash cover of this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuCkE3tGG-w"

**twat_brained**: "Only Beyoncé can make a song referencing both the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Soulja Boy sound this good."

**ImADudeDuh**: "It'd be a 10 without those damn air horns"

Yes, Rihanna, screech into that mic! I remember in this Mitski video she described an artist (I think it was Young Thug?) as not singing like he wanted to please the listener, but rather just singing like how he thought it should be sung. While that sounds like shade, I think that same idea is applicable here, because honestly while some of her raw screechs aren't objectively pleasent, they *sound* right, like that's how the song is supposed to go. The song's just so gritty but also so catchy, and also responsible for some of her best performances of all time. Of course, we're getting a music video, right Rih?

[/r/popheads/comments/5s8ilj/the_2016_ultimate_album_rate_day_3_okay_rpopheads/ddd9b17/]

=====

letsallpoo: 
**JoeThaMo**: "Every time this track comes on I just want to belt the lyrics alongside Rih, it's great. Some of her live performances of this song are amazing as well!"

**BionicFunhouse**: "RIRI WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE"

**VodkaInsipido**: "This song has it all to be a Rihanna classic: the male voices, the cat voice, the orchestration, that abrupt ending. I hate to say this, but Rihanna did a better Superpower than Beyoncé."

**melisanyans**: "this song should be just the chorus, the rest is kinda trash"

**skiddos**: "Rih really serves vocals on this!"

**Macubass**: "fucking amazing"

**mokitsu**: "Grew on me after being a single, Rihanna's vocal delivery is very good and truly showcases her evolution!"

**Rourke_**: "BOP"

**MrSwearword**: "This did give her the BBMAs live performance. Other than that, from the 2:13 mark on has these really awful sounding “I-I-I-I-I” vocals that really made me cringe."

**gannade** lies about the score he gave it: "its not that bad but i have to give it a 0 because it's so VEXING and IRKSOME. first of all, it should be love on my mind not love on my brain. who says they have anything 'on my brain'? second, rihanna's falsetto/high notes/whatever it's called is just not good, sounds like a cat dying AKA zayn. and finally, beyonce's all night is the superior version of this song and it makes me mad that this gets more recognition."

**mgglite**: "oh gr8 we're back to that shtick of every song sounding like all the others again. rihanna's vocals are horrible on this for some reason, did she blow her voice out at the karaoke prior to recording it?"

**holly_foxxy**: "another song that i want to like more than i do :/"

**dirdbub**: "uuuuuuuggggggghhhhh this song. it is not a good song at all, how was this one of the songs that got popular on Anti??"

**JunkyGS**: "Rihanna just flexes her vocals on this ballad. It's incredibly solid all around and will be a go to song for future people trying out on The Voice or X Factor."

**MihaMijat**: "The unofficial 11"

**enecks**: "BOM BOMBOM"

**calltehshots**: "A comprehensive list of things Rihanna did: that."

**Wtucker4**: "Please reach no.1 on Billboard"

**eribertknows**: "Almost as good as Stay."

**Palutzel**: "it's one of the better songs, but it's far from being great"

**TonyRealm**: "Classic."

**havanabrown**: "This song is pretty special considering it's one of the few that shows off her vocal talents properly. However the fact that they played it on the radio all the time in NZ has made me sick to death of it"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this almost sounds like a song from the great gatsby soundtrack, also this sounds like Superpower from Beyoncé"

**spacebabe27**: "Rihanna's vocals have never stood out for me, but this track is such a high point in her showing her vocal prowess."

**superr_rad**: "Wow Riri sounds amazing in this, i love the call back to 50's doo-wop but its still 100% a Rihanna's song."

**soeri**: "the remix is better"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This song is like such a cool moment, it slays me"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Torch songs have never been my favourite but as always Rih Rih makes me love it to pieces."

**jamesfog**: "Only Rihanna can make a song straight out of the 50's chart in the Top 20!"

**bliamc**: "Like a Motown ballad with a little indie rock bridge thrown in there. It’s big, it’s dirty, it’s sexy and it’s great. I love it all."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "certified bop™"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I was expecting a banger. The song is okay but a bit overrated. The lyrics could have been better imo."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i don't like this style but at least i can sing along to this"

**Death_Soup**: "It's pretty much impossible not to sing along to this throwback jam."

**tiltheendoftheline**: "Best song Rihanna made in years, imo."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "My Girl's got pipes yass"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "she does not have the range."

**mother_rucker**: "Makes me want to slow dance at a 1956 high school prom with my man, then get fucked in the backseat of his Chevy at Makeout Point"

**Wailordfan**: "Doo wop mixes well with Rih. Super solid song, and the drop from the oh's to the 'and babe' is just really smooth and almost sounds like two different artists."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Iconic at this point. This song is really a sign of Rihanna maturing, and it's arguable the best on the album. Vocals are just divine. That instrumental is just timeless, and this is one of songs that makes me consider Anti to be my favorite Rihanna album."

**qetaz**: "I LOVE THIS SONG"

**femaleghostbuster**: "Rihanna can sing!"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Gave this a ten, the Don Diablo remix would have gotten an eleven."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "LOOOOOOOVE vocals on point"

**SkyBlade79**: "The production is wholly uninteresting and I really don’t enjoy her voice very much on this track. She actually sounds like a warbling bird at some points on this track, which really isn’t a good thing."

**chihuahuazero**: "According to musicnotes.com, this song has a 12/8 time signature. Does that make Rihanna queen of compound quadruple time? Anyways, the radically different groove is just one factor that make “Love on the Brain” a standout. I’d also include Rihanna’s vocal delivery in the verses, which is unique and almost unrecognizable. More of this, please."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Nice interesting rnb song. I like it."

**misguidedzombie**: "Her voice suits this style of music so well."

**Therokinrolla**: "its decent but i really feel like it drags on quite a bit"

**SpanKKy1**: "I loved Pinky and the Brain!"

**leviOHsa**: "Love this. It sounds like a Paloma Faith song. Her voice sounds sickening though, so props to you mama."

**ExtraEater**: "Work, Women & The City; A woman seamlessly travels in and out through inner city shadows, conceding her 'mighty' crown as she slaves away to the bustling traffic. Rather unkempt by her work, she returns home with nothing but a purse and a few morsels of a forgotten snack. Robin, her name naked and engraved on her purse, was in the middle of a decision. She took into consideration her options. Her career was nothing but a cycle. She dreamed of becoming a pop star. Yet somehow, in the landscape of 2017, it was certainly a bigger dream than ever. In fact, by the end of this overall story, she won't be famous. She sits on the bed patiently awaiting someone. In her mind, she waits for an opportunity, but all she really wants is her lover, who has been swallowed in the ubiquitous routine of working and working. She waits in the shadows, doing nothing but daydreaming."

**blue_charles**: "I don't really like this. Rihanna serves some pretty solid vocals, some embarrassing lyrics aside, but the production and instrumentation don't come through for me. The organ in the chorus, while I know what they were shooting for, doesn't work for me."

**VioletChutzkee**: "It probably deserves better tbh. A 10 might be merited, but I just don't fuck with doo-wop much."

**eklxtreme**: "best vocals on the whole album (maybe her career), very heartfelt and well-produced"

**joshually**: "Is this an autobiographical tale of her drama-filled relationship with Chris brown? She news teasing us because on the one hand she releases songs like this, cursing the day she met him, lamenting him leaving her black and blue and admitting to the hopelessness of the situation, but on the other hand, she's probably on a secret cocaine-fueled booty call with him right now as I listen to this song."

**snidelaughter**: "Ballad Rihanna, though? That's some good shit if I do say so myself, and I say so."

**Yatcho**: "RiRi is serving VOCALS here, one of the best ballads on the whole rate and she carries it soley through an amazing vocal performance"

**veryunfinished**: "i kind of wish she had stayed in her regular register for this. the theatrics weren’t really necessary. this song is good though. the way that organ flares up in the chorus is nice."

**Willybae00**: "While this song is perfectly great by itself, it also does a great job at setting the tone for Higher. It’s like if Rihanna has had a few drinks and is starting to let out her insecurities in a relationship while contrasting them to the reason she wants to stay with this person."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "this is actually my first time listening to LOTB (lmao don't kill me) + I dig it. can't be the only one who hears the similarities to JoJo's Mad Love, right?"

**twat_brained**: "Rihanna needs to stay out of her head voice. Simple as that."

**ImADudeDuh**: "That AMA performance of this song is still in my head!"

ExtraEater: WHAT EVEN IS THE MAIN RATE ANYMORE.

anyway, i have pokemon to eliminate.....

#3 - Popplio

Average: 8.595
Controversy: 1.9331
My Rating: 10

Highest Scores: (11 x5): My friend, (and) Cryomatic, whatsapilot, JunkyGS, enecks (10 x6): ExtraEater, skiddos, bluehxrizon, NapsAndNetflix, Therokinrolla (9 x2): letsallpoo, cabblue

Lowest Scores: (0 x1): /u/BearlyEvenAPun

This got the most 11's btw

In five words, Naps sums up the basis around this high placement: “holy shit this is cute”

**For the longest time Popplio was #1**, but then a single 0 by the 15th submitter, BearlyEvenAPun, dragged it to 2nd, and all scores afterward did nothing bc nobody hated the Rowlet or Piplup enough lol. To explain their 0, Bearly says, “well something had to get it. Maybe the family will grow on me over the next couple years but for now [it’s] pretty far behind the other starters”.

I think we were all lowkey thinking of Popplio’s final evolution Primarina when Marina was at her last legs in the Electra Heart/BTD/PH war. And let’s be honest, Primarina is just a significantly better Milotic.

enecks is screaming: “A PURE CINAMMON BUN OF CUTE AND I WANT TO PROTECT YOU YOU SAD TRANS CLOWN DOG SEAL”. TeamAwesome4 compares Popp to other seal pokemon, calling Popplio “Better than Spheal, worse than Seel. Decent enough starter.” batmanji, at the risk of their gay card, says “primarina is gayer than I am”. Therokinrolla says, “no joke i l0ve seals and im crying irl right now i might buy the game just to have a seal”. Seel from Gen 1 is shook. And so are the 5 people who gave this an 11. Popplio got the most 11’s lmao.

SO NOW WHO WILL WIN:

#PIPLUP?

or...

#ROWLET?

or do you not know either of these pokemon bc you only played gen 1 & 2???

tell me in the comnts

i'm finishing this up right after poo reveals #4 btw

edit: Really I find the humanoidish pokemon to be a hit or miss. Some of them end up looking really cool while others land in uncanny valley territory. Primarina (and Brionne) land in the second category imo. Usually I can get past this, but it usually takes a while to get used to them (I'm only now starting to appreciate Jynx and Machamp after nearly 20 years)

ExtraEater: #THE POKEMON RATE ENDS HERE

#.

#.

#.

#.

#.

#1 - Rowlet

Average: 8.782
Controversy: 1.2322
My Rating: 9

Highest Scores: (11 x1): ImADudeDuh (10 x7): Mudkip1, letsallpoo, bluehxrizon, Cryomatic, cabblue, gannade, Therokinrolla (9.5 x1): BearlyEvenAPun (9 x3): ExtraEater, skiddos, whatsapilot, alternativeoxygen (8 x2): NapsAndNetflix, Reifui

Lowest Scores: (5 x2): My friend, (and) SkyBlade79

“So this guy can turn his head entirely around. Fuckin dope.” ~TeamAwesome4

Sure, Popplio’s final evolution may look the prettiest, but I still stand by Decidueye as the coolest-looking Alola starter.

“What is it recently with stupid looking grass type middle forms” ~BearlyEvenAPun. Seriously, Dartrix just looks bad. It’s such a shame considering how cool Decidueye looks.

Naps, with his interesting rate standards, says “it wasn't the first thing to come up when I googled it so I docked points for that, but then the picture that does show up has it eating a ratatta and fuck those things.” might wanna update that comment there [beth](https://www.google.com/search?q=rowlet&rlz=1CAACAJ_enUS696US696&biw=1366&bih=631&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjcofTi4PvQAhWK0YMKHRy1AsYQ_AUIBygA&dpr=1)

Therokinrolla draws from their first impressions “!!!!!!! was my emotion when i saw it for the first time”. estreindre, who’s probably already played the game by the time this writeup has been revealed to the public, “feel[s] like it might become my all-time fave starter once i get to play the game.” lowkey struggling with this comment by enecks, “The kind of Pokemon that stans Dr. Who and is kind of annoying but is cute.”

#2 - Piplup

Average: 8.627
Controversy: 1.1339
My Rating: 7

Highest Scores: (10 x7): Mudkip1, cabblue, whatsapilot, ImADudeDuh, gannade, enecks, SkyBlade79 (9 x2): My friend, (and) Therokinrolla

Lowest Scores: (6.5 x1): BearlyEvenAPun (6.8 x1): estreindre

BearlyEvenAPun kinda sorta describes why I have unsure feelings about it: “Love the idea of penguin pokemon, but something about the later evolutions seems... off”

Naps apparently “expect[ed] this to look like a dog wtf”

estreindre says “it gets pretty ugly after it evolves, but it has an interesting type at least”, which is def valid bc Water/Steel is a pretty cool typing tbh.

“I don't think it's possible to dislike this little fluffbutt” ~TeamAwesome4

full score pics and recaps comin at ya soon

Welp, here we are. This never managed to reach #1 in the rate, and it kept flipping between #2 and #3 for a while. I'm fairly sure everyone expected this to win, if not just because it's an incredible song that manages to be a huge bop, be stuffed with memorable and wacky one-liners, and also manage to be explicitly political by way of lyrics and music video. There's a ton to unpack in 'Formation,' the most critically acclaimed pop song of yesteryear, that I don't feel like getting into rn (I'm currently typing this in one of my classes nnnn) but so much has been written on the track already that if you really wanted to learn about it, you're just a Google search away. It's a tad questionable how you can decide this is your least favorite track while still knowing all this stuff about it, but I'm not here to be the taste police I suppose. This makes for a more interesting finale anyway hihi.

---


**JoeThaMo**: "Easily the best track on Lemonade. That beat goes hard and even if the lyrics are corny and repetitive, Bey just makes it WORK."

**VodkaInsipido**: "The beat is recognizable at the first second, Mike definitely made it."

**TaylordSwiftsus**: "This is the best song of 2016. LEGENDARY, flawless, iconic, a B-O-P, etc..."

**skiddos**: "she saved the BOP for last!"

**Macubass**: "good message, not that great tho"

**mokitsu**: "Although I've been judging these songs by personal preference, even if I didn't like Formation I'd give it a ten! It's just that important and great. Every line is empowering, thought provoking, controversial and outrageous, the production is out of this world."

**Rourke_**: "the opening chords? sounds? beepy things? are amazing. Plus dat red lobster promo"

**MrSwearword**: "“7/11” with socio-political commentary. The lyric “I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils” won me over instantaneously."

**mgglite**: "everything about this is horrible. the out of tune trumpets in the background, the weird twinkly synths, her overprocessed vocals, the outdated lyrics, whatever that twanging thing is that never stops, the water dripping sound...i had never heard of beyonce before 2015 but if she kept releasing trash like this before then i'm not surprised"

**holly_foxxy**: "this song GOES but it just feels so out of place on the album? idk still good af tho"

**dirdbub**: "R E D L O B S T E R"

**JunkyGS**: "Wish I had 2 11s."

**MihaMijat**: "If you didn't give this a 10 you are racist bye"

**enecks**: "ICONIC MASTERPIECE POWERFUL ONLY REASON I DIDN’T GIVE THIS AN 11 IS BECAUSE FREEDOM IS GOAT"

**estreindre**: "honestly, i have..... no idea why this was the most successful song off of lemonade. this song feels really messy and the production and beyonce feel like they're clashing with each other on a lot of parts of the song. prooobably the worst song off of lemonade."

**omgcow**: "I hated this at first but now I love it, “Hot sauce in my bag/swag” still kinda makes me cringe tho"

**calltehshots**: "White America is SHOOK"

**eribertknows**: "This song is ok in itself I guess, but the rest of the album is just... different, and better."

**Palutzel**: "just like Sorry, it's messy and loud, i know, everyone says that it's just brilliant, but for me it's just ok"

**TonyRealm**: "I’m sorry but the amount of times Bey says “slay” is an abomination."

**marcryan**: "If Beyonce knew how to release songs across multiple platforms this could have topped the Hot 100. Simply Iconic"

**havanabrown**: "There’s so much going on in this song it’s epic. Also, slaaay chick or get eliminated"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "in case you missed it, i really don't like Lemonade at all"

**spacebabe27**: "This is how you do minimalistic production and get a banger out of it. Also the message of this song and why it's so important to the black community adds a point even though this song is already a 10 to me."

**superr_rad**: "Probably the most important pop song of 2016, no competition. I asked my friend who’s a huge Bey stan how she feels about this song and she said “It set a new standard for music production in today’s age. Not only did it set a new standard, it created one that is hard to meet. It will go down as a classic."

**soeri**: "most iconic song of 2016 hands down tbh"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Shoutout to Rae Sremmurd, shh I don’t want this to win"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Would've gotten a better score if its inclusion on the album didn't feel like an afterthought"

**bliamc**: "BEST SONG OF THE YEAR NO QUESTION STOP DRAGGING YOUR HEELS AND EMBRACE THE MOST POLITICAL AND CATCHIEST POP SONG OF 2016 WHEN WILL YOUR FAVE EVER CHANNEL MALCOM X AT THE SUPERBOWL, JUST, WHEN WILL THEY EVER??"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "POWERFUL song and video AND a bop!"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Nah. Also use this video in some form for this song https://vimeo.com/155287084 (it’s hard to find on youtube because SNL)"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "only reason it didn't get my 11 is because it never climaxed properly so bey blue balled me. she's right though, she slays, YAAAAS."

**Death_Soup**: "SLAY"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Best song of 2016. Best video. Best everything. This is fantastic."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "holy fuck this song is so good."

letsallpoo: 
**mirandacrocsgrove**: "#goodmorning"

**mother_rucker**: "Okay, so everyone knows that this song is empowering and genius and iconic and meaningful for a ton of reasons. I just want to talk about the beauty of one line: 'When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster.' This line is amazing because A) I now have a great line to say to my boyfriend before sex, B) It flips the script on gender roles, because typically men are portrayed to demand sexual satisfaction and reward their woman when it is met, and C) It basically saved Red Lobster, one of the best restaurant chains the South has to offer, from bankruptcy. Even if the rest of the song wasn't perfect, I would love it for this lyric alone. But the rest of the song is perfect, so it's just one tiny part of a masterpiece."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "In my mind, this song is an epilogue. All Night serves as a closer, a sort of bliss after the doubt and jealousy. And after a moment of blackness comes a new moment of profound blackness. Beyoncé uses the concept of black women being forced to stay in line, by telling her sisters to get in formation and fight back against the forces holding them back. And with the strongest lyricism on the album, from 'You mix that negro with that Creole, make a Texas bama/I like my baby hair with baby hair and afros/I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils' and 'You know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation/Always stay gracious, best revenge is your paper'. And when her fierce delivery is over the intimidating, bombastic instrumental that Formation has, this song was a strong contender for my 11."

**angusaditus**: "I would like it so much more if the 'cause I slay (hey)' x100 part was deleted."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "A political song? from beyonce? if you would have told me that ten years ago I would have been like 'what' but now it just makes sense."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "I didn’t like this song when I first heard but it goddamn did it grow on me, one of my top songs of 2016 and I FEEL SO FIERCE SINGING TO IT IN THE CAR"

**SkyBlade79**: "A real bop. She does an amazing job at empowering her race, the video is legendary, and this is such an amazing track."

**chihuahuazero**: "Remember the day when Béyonce dressed like a Black Panther at the Superbowl and became black."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "This one’s all catchy too and has a powerful statement and everything. It’s good"

**Zugtris**: "greatest event in music during 2016."

**Therokinrolla**: "Listen: The wub wub wubs at the beginning and the lyrics basically give this song 7 of the points I’ve given to it. ITs just… I don’t feel like listening to it again. Its interesting, and I HIGHLY appreciate it. But I just don’t care for it. I’m so sorry."

**huntyphobic**: "I have no idea what else to say other than, ‘When will you fave ever?’."

**SpanKKy1**: "More like menstruation"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I like the empowerment anthem, and it's very catchy, but it's far from the best song in the album, and it's not going to age well."

**leviOHsa**: "Come on. This songs slays from the first beat to the end, if anyone gives this a 0 they’re only lying to themselves. You can’t deny the impact this song had from release, and it wasn’t even released as a single and the video was private for months! Queen Bee motherfuckers."

**seferre2**: "don't harass me but this song mediocre and overrated"

**blue_charles**: "Whenever I, a reject white boy twink, try to do the dance to this I lowkey feel like I'm appropriating black culture. But it bops tho so it's fine, right?"

**VioletChutzkee**: "Y'all haters corny with that Formation isn't the best song of 2016 mess! Every single line of this song is iconic. Every single frame of the video is iconic. This is the song that made me see the light and realize that Beyoncé is the real deal. She is that bitch."

**eklxtreme**: "production goes pretty hard, some lyrics are really good"

**joshually**: "My friend has always had hot sauce in her bag. Like no lie, she carried a little squirt bottle of sriracha or tapatio wherever we went. It exploded in her purse once and it was not pretty."

**snidelaughter**: "This album still ends on a high note, however."

**veryunfinished**: "most culturally iconic song of 2016! that beat is incredible."

**Willybae00**: "The lyrics are everything! Now, I’m not an expert but I would prefer the song a lot more if she changed the vocal arrangement here and there"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "it may be overrated but overrated can be good 👀"

**twat_brained**: "I can appreciate and enjoy this song and get behind its message, but I don't think it's all that and a bag of chips. It's far overrated."

**ImADudeDuh**: "I mean, I'm glad it got so big for the message, but it's still just ok"

**ExtraEater**: "You don't know me, but my name's Sie, I'm just the O'Hare, delivery guy. But it seems like trees might be worth a try, So I say, let it grow. My name's Dan; And my name's Rose. Our son Wesley kinda glows, And that's not good so we suppose, We should let it grow. Let it grow, let it grow, You can't reap what you don't sew! Plant the seed inside the earth, Just one way, to know it's worth. Celebrate the world's rebirth, We say let it grow. My name's Marie, And I am three! And I would like to see a tree, La la la la la lala lee, I say let it grow. I'm Grammy Norma - I'm old and I've got gray hair, But I remember when trees were everywhere, And no one had to pay for air! So I say, let it grow! Let it grow, let it grow, Like it did so long ago. It is just one tiny seed, But it's all we really need, Time to change your life with deed, Time to let it grow. My name's O'Hare, I'm one of you. I live here in Thneedville, too. The things you say just might be true. It could be time, to start anew. Maybe change my point of view! Nah! I say let it die! Let it die, let it die, Let it shrivel up and - Come on, who's with me? No body. YOU GREEDY DIRTBAG! Let it grow, let it grow, Let the love inside you show! Plant the seed inside the earth, Just one way, to know it's worth! Celebrate the world's rebirth, We say let it grow!"

This was absolutely one of my favorite tracks from last year, and for a while it was the only track on Anti that I would regularly listen to. That guitar - it's just so infectious, and the way it glides along with Rih's voice makes me want to cream. Shoudl be higher, honestly, but the fact that it was outside the top 10 for a large part of the rate, yet managed to climb all the way up makes me content with its position. It also by far holds the record for most 10s/11s.

[/r/popheads/comments/5s8ilj/the_2016_ultimate_album_rate_day_3_okay_rpopheads/ddda8zy/]

=====

letsallpoo: 
**JoeThaMo**: "The guitar riff slays me every time tbh"

**VodkaInsipido**: "THOSE GUITARS, THAT DISTORTION, THAT PRE-CHORUS AAAAAAAAAHHH"

**skiddos**: "the guitars make me whet"

**Macubass**: "invented rnb"

**mokitsu**: "An immediate classic! Love the way the notes in the 'what are you willing to do?'s match the guitar riff, the bridge + pre-chorus with the layered vocals is heaven!"

**Rourke_**: "This is smooth af, one of rihannas best songs by far"

**MrSwearword**: "She tries here, but the beat gets way too monotonous by the halfway mark."

**Bingcrusher**: "Holy fuck that song went on like a minute too long."

**chubs4life**: "GOAT song. Literally makes everything I do when it plays sexy. Eating? Becomes sexy. Sleeping? Seductive af. Showering? Steamy af. Sitting on the toilet? Sexiest dump ever."

**mgglite**: "this sounds like someone took the sonic adventure soundtrack, slowed it down 300% and got rihanna to sing over it"

**holly_foxxy**: "meh."

**ProphecyPizza**: "A decent bop, but it doesnt't do THAT."

**dirdbub**: "damn, this song is boring"

**JunkyGS**: "The guitar rift, production & rihanna's vocals are just hypnotic on this song. It gave me some prince flash backs and is such a solid slow jam."

**MihaMijat**: "DESERVED BETTER"

**enecks**: "The guitar is so cheesy but so fun"

**estreindre**: "god DAMN this is a good song, rihanna's voice on this is fantastic. the chorus especially is fantastic."

**omgcow**: "Deserved far better treatment by the charts, this is such a great song."

**calltehshots**: "Justice for this song!!! Peaking at 62 smh - I hate Americans, I hate America!!!"

**Wtucker4**: "Best thing Rihanna's ever done, her peak"

**Palutzel**: "it's good, but I don't get the praise tho"

**TonyRealm**: "Luxurious production, catchy af, nice ad-libs in the final chorus, and whenever Rihanna sings “fuck yo pride” I flinch."

**potrap**: "A masterpiece."

**havanabrown**: "I mean it's ok but I don't get the immense praise it's received"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "I know y'all are gonna hate me but i don't get why you all like this???"

**spacebabe27**: "Best song from ANTI and deserved so much better than it got. The synths in this create a sound that just kind of envelops you and makes you feel oddly nostalgic."

**superr_rad**: "God the guitars on this are fucking beautiful, i can't believe this song didn't perform better."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I fucking love this song, the guitar solo and the instruments and the notes Rih hits, oh my lord. One of her best songs ever, MAN FUCK YO PRIDE"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "One of the trifecta of perfection on this album in my opinion"

**jamesfog**: "Slay a bit Riri!"

**bliamc**: "KISS IT KISS IT BETTER BABY, MAN FUCK YOUR PRIDE, TAKE IT ON BACK BOY TAKE IT ON BACK. THIS SONG IS A GEM. AN 80s SLOW JAM THAT NEEDS TO BE SUNG AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS. IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU WOULD EVER NEED. SO GOOD"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "LITERALLY RIHANNA'S BEST SONG! the second that guitar comes in, my wig flies off!"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "This song is fine but I don’t go out of my way to listen to it."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Apparently this song was supposed to be the lead single for ANTI but Rihanna eventually chose Bitch Better Have My Money instead after her ex Travis Scott convinced her. As much as I love BBHMM, this would have been a better lead single. About the song itself, the guitars and Rihann's vocals are heaven. One of the best songs on the album so far."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Slightly better than Consideration but jesus Riri wft is this slow shit hit me with the bangers"

**Death_Soup**: "Guitar riff is so infectious and her echoey vocals are fucking awesome. Amazing video too. #JusticeForKissItBetter"

**Bannerww**: "okay lets be honest guys this is the song you've loved after listening to ANTI for the first time amirite"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "Such a catchy song, love at first listen."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN BIGGER WTF"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "The weakest, worst song on the album. The cheesy riffs and lazy lyrics make me cringe. It makes me think if Prince was drunkenly asked to write a song on the spot to try and seduce the woman sitting across the bar."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "one of my immediate favorites upon first album listen and I'm not sure who to blame for this flopping so hard; the GP, or Rihanna’s management for simultaneously releasing this with “Needed Me”."

**Wailordfan**: "First single in the rate. It is solid, but not my favorite from the album. I love the guitar in it, and guitar solos in 2016 have been my guilty pleasure."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Underrated bop, at least when people talk about this album. It has a weird beat that actually does a good job contrasting Rihanna's vocals. Again, like a lot of the songs on Anti, the drums are just amazing."

**qetaz**: "it just misses my playlist, but if it came on the radio I'd definitely be jamming along!"

**Reifiui**: "Who let Rihanna make an air-metal ballad and why is it in the top 3 songs of her career and WHY WAS IT THE ONLY FLOP FROM ANTI?!"

**femaleghostbuster**: "This is so Prince!"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Rihanna has a lot of sex songs, but I really like the fact that this is taking it to a more intimate place than to this aggressive spot that her sex songs usually end up in."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "LOVE I wish it performed better bc that guitar just everything love love love"

**SkyBlade79**: "Pretty dang good. I do enjoy how fierce and sensual she sounds on this track, and the chorus is great."

**chihuahuazero**: "The “second verse, same as the first” structure should’ve killed the deal for me, but everything else about this song made this one of my 2016 SOTYs. The stadium-rock guitars, Rihanna’s vocal edging, the darker subtext that comes from Rihanna being the one to sing this... her label did “Kiss It Better” injustice by promoting it alongside “Needed Me”. I hope the sub gave this song justice in this rate."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "This is a top tier Rihanna bop"

**Zugtris**: "AAAAAHHHHHH this was such a fucking moment during the anti world tour, legit felt like i was making out with music. fuck me up rih"

**Therokinrolla**: "Yesss slay with those beginning horns or whatever those are, they are kinda what make this track for me, a la RAWM. But the rest of the song is great too, and RiRi sounds super powerful and I like it."

**huntyphobic**: "I love this song even though the guitar is generic af."

**SpanKKy1** is perhaps talking about one of his beards: "She can kiss it much better than this snoozefest"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "PERFECTION. This is an excellent throwback to the 80s. Nice synths, nice lyrics, nice vocals, nice production, nice everything."

**youknwnothingjonsnow**: "shame the video wasn't better"

**leviOHsa**: "This song is just pure sex. Which is expected from Rihanna, but she does it so well."

**JohnnyToby**: "there’s so much that’s perfect with this like I know im wasting my 11 on Sandcastles bc it’s bad apparently but if that wasn’t here this would take my 11"

**seferre2**: "this is one of the least boring tracks on anti that doesn't make me feel uncomfortable lol"

**ExtraEater**: "Work, Women & The City; At last, Robin's man has come home. But of course, he is once again tattered and symbolized by nothing but a suitcase and a face that would rather work its ass off. But every night, she knows what happens. They argue a bit, but they eventually kiss despite their broken relationship because to both of them, it brings nothing but fever and ecstasy to their young minds and hearts. It was only 10:00 PM, and it usually happened very late. She napped and she dreamed..... (ok this one is kinda typical and filler but it's a good setup for needed me and work. regardless i just wanted to say that I like this song over Work, but I still love the lyrical themes of Work over it, even if KIB also has great lyrics)"

**blue_charles**: "That electric guitar really completes this song, adding an element that is hypnotically moody and that really sells the whole song."

**eklxtreme**: "the harmonies and guitar in the chorus work well, her vocals and the whole melody are great here"

**joshually**: "Unlike all of popheads but much like most of the world, I basically ignored this for the more vibrant Needed Me, but upon relisten, it's not a bad song. The electric guitar, pacing and melody and even the plot content reminds me of TLC's Red Light Special, which is never a bad thing."

**snidelaughter**: "Prince vibes here. I wish this was the single that went number one instead of Work, but whatever. 'Man, fuck your pride!' is the arrogance I've wanted from Rihanna that she hasn't hit since Rated R, so I'm shook. Even the drums feel right. I don't know Rihanna, what am I willing to do?"

**veryunfinished**: "that intro is perfect. that guitar! the reverb actually sounds good on her voice in this song. i love the melody to the prechorus."

**Willybae00**: "This is where the album picks up and boy does it pick up. It’s sexy, and the song is overall perfectly balanced between simple yet creative lyrics"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "the visuals for this though... nothing quite says sexy like juggling some dice in your vag"

**twat_brained**: "This has some PRODUCTION and Rih is SERVING VOCALS! This deserved to chart higher"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Don't get the hype behind this song"

What is so appealing about Britney? She literally doesn't sing, ever, live. She can dance, so what? She only has a writing credit on 5 of her songs on the standard edition of the album. 

This is like stanning Kim Kardashian because you like Jam (Turn it Up). You know she can't write or sing, but like the persona. Britney is that. She is a reality star, who happens to put her edited vocals out for people to buy and dances to said music for people instead of singing it.

superr_rad: she has starpower. you can sing, dance, write, whatever, but if you don't have the star power to perform like she does, you cannot be a pop artist. lana del rey does not have this starpower for example. her performances make me really uncomfortable, but even britney's bad performances are still intriguing, interesting, and capture peoples attention. honestly, taylor is quite talented and has star power, but most of it comes from her investment in her songs. i find her popstar performances to fall flat more than often, she has to rely on her "cute, relatable, dorky" image to sell herself still. 
[/r/popheads/comments/5s8ilj/the_2016_ultimate_album_rate_day_3_okay_rpopheads/dddyr7n/]

=====

deleted: sigh

I would explain my reasoning as to why I think Britney is talented and there has been a ton of different factors as to why she never got to shake off that manufactured pop star stigma. She has always wanted to write and produce her own music, but her label was so controlling of everything she did and just wanted her to produce safe pop music and make money for them, rather than let her spread her creative wings. As far as singing talent goes, yeah she's not the best, I'll admit that, but her earlier music showcased her real voice instead of her "baby" voice that she uses now. She had a much deeper register comparable to Christina Aguleira, but her label made her change her voice because it didn't fit her image. Her being so controlled by them was something that led to her breakdown in 2007, then her being put under a conservatorship limited her creative control even further, she only just started getting it back with Glory.

It's something I'll always bring up to defend her, but non-stans never seem to agree or understand.

So you take Kendrick's Alright, take Kendrick himself, then craft a song about the same ideals yet implicitly about black women instead and how they're often forgotten in this fight for justice? And on top of that, make the song a huge bop and get Kendrick to deliver a guest verse that isn't complete shit? When will Maroon 5? When will Taylor? When will anyone? I didn't expect this to make it this far, but it could have won with an average of 10 and I wouldn't have complained.

**BionicFunhouse**: "So explosive and powerful, one of my favorite songs of the year."

**VodkaInsipido**: "Beyoncé is finally explicit in what she wants to say, so is Kendrick. The bass is perfect, the sample is perfect, the verses are perfect, the distortion on Kendrick's voice at the end is perfect. That's it."

**Rourke_**: "not sure Kendrick is necessary"

**MrSwearword**: "What “Superpower” did for self-titled, this song does for Lemonade [even if the visual omits Kendrick’s verse for no good goddamn reason.]"

**mgglite**: "good god the production on this one is janky at the start and it's not even in a cool way. however it has some life in it, which there is not a lot of in this album"

**ProphecyPizza**: "a BOP"

**dirdbub**: "Beyonce and Kendrick. easy reason for this 10"

**JunkyGS**: "Inspiring and really captures that fed up / angst feeling."

**MihaMijat**: "This is so anthemic. Just amazing."

**enecks**: "DAMN THIS SONG IS POWERFUL. BEST BEYONCE SONG. BEST SONG OF 2016. IT EVEN HAS KENDRICK LAMAR DOING HIS BEST GUEST VERSE IN ANY SONG. BEST ORGAN. THIS SONG MADE LEMONADE."

**estreindre**: "HERE WE GO this song is a return to glory since it is SO GREAT. beyonce is fucking fantastic on this, and for once, kendrick lamar's guest verse is really good too!!"

**omgcow**: "I love this one, it’s my favorite on the album. The chorus gives me goosebumps, the whole song is so powerful."

**soeri**: "kendrick usually sucks at features but this is might be better than his solo work tbh"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Great beat, fantastic hook, and Kendrick murders his verse, I wish all his pop features were this good looking at you Maroon 5"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "It would probably be an easy 10 on this album if I didn't feel so disappointed with Kendricks verse"

**bliamc**: "A tiny bit heavy handed, but really good"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "inspirational and very very relevant"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Yah"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is probably one of the most radio-friendly tracks on Lemonade. Kinda ironic considering its theme could trigger Middle America. And among all of the Kendrick features that I have listened so far, this is his best one."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "THIS IS THE KIND OF THING I WANT TO SEE FROM BEY SLAAAAAY"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is anthemic in the best possible ways"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "kendrick's part is boring but I BREAK CHAINS ALL BY MYSELF"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "A triumphant song with a surprising Kendrick feature, Freedom somehow exceeds my expectations. The bass and general production on the track is just insane, and Beyoncé's vocal performance is commendable. King Kendrick comes in with a simple verse, but the countdown is a nice aside, and I think for what it is, it doesn't overshadow the song and adds as a really nice compliment to it."

**qetaz**: "Not really my thing"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "terrific and a great song to rally people up."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "ok so they used this song in the nrl (Australian football) and it was really weird bc it doesn’t relate to aus football in the slightest"

**SkyBlade79**: "This one is great. One of the most empowering songs on the album, and just great overall. Kdot does a good job."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Okay song, Kendrick verse didn’t do much and I love Kendrick."

**Therokinrolla**: "Holy hell fuck me up"

**huntyphobic**: "A BANGER"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The rap part is badass. Pretty generic song when you think about it, but it's still pretty awesome."

**blue_charles**: "Remember when people said Beyonce didn't make enough music about race? Yeah, she changed that."

**eklxtreme**: "very intense, subtle gospel instrumentation is nice, Kendrick killed it"

**snidelaughter**: "And we back. Everything about this song is demanding and fantastic. I can't overstate that enough."

**veryunfinished**: "that organ. that drumbeat. it's all so powerful! everything about this song is perfect. kendrick's verse is the best guest verse i've heard from him ever probably."

**twat_brained**: "If this song is not in your top 3 on Lemonade, you're not listening to it right."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Best thing Kendrick did in 2016"

So here we are. I remember when I had like 10 votes in this was #1 and I was cackling because I never expected Britney to actually win (did anyone?) so I shared the wacky top 10 in the plug with the belief that it would get switched up soon enough. And it did. John Wayne plummeted, Don't Hurt Yourself dropped out, A-YO dipped its head in and out, Formation even dropped some spots. But Slumber Party never moved. It was literally #1 since the beginning of the rate. I think its success is largely because almost nobody hated it. It's a good song, and even Britney's staunchest haters threw it a good score. So now it's the winner. It's a bop, it's one of Britney's best ever, the horns in the chorus that come out of nowhere are amazing, and Tinashe's inclusion (even though it doesn't really change the song) gives the song and video a sapphic and sexier tinge. I've long come to terms with this winning (lmao) but I'm sure this will...be a bit of a shock to y'all. I suppose this is my revenge for seeing so many 'omg britney's gonna get destroyed!' comments ever since I announced this rate. If anything, this is evidence that she can still compete with the big leagues. NO I DID NOT RIG THIS

---

In which we violently beat this joke to death:

**Wailordfan**: "Having a different voice there is nice for a change, also, TINASHA I C O N I C. Can't wait to get lumped with literally everyone else who said the same thing." Well, let's see?

**BionicFunhouse**: "I actually dig this a bit. Tinasha sounds great."

**SkyBlade79**: "Tinasha is pretty pointless in this, but I really like the chorus. Sure, the first verse is just cringy and obvious metaphors, it seems fake edgy, but it’s still an undeniable bop."

**VodkaInsipido**: "T I N A S H A"

**joshually**: "Tinashas new signature song, thank you Godney for sharing your blessing with the less fortunate."

**chubs4life**: "I love Tinasha's work!"

**JunkyGS**: "GIVE IT UP FOR TINASHA"

**MihaMijat**: "Tinasha remix is better but still great"

**calltehshots**: "A BOP that invented Tinasha? Legendary."

**arandomgiraffe**: "excuse me you accidentally misspelled Tinasha with an e"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I like the synths and how low-key the song can be, I could bop to it and I kept imagining Troy and Abed’s pillow fort from Community listening to it so that can’t be bad. Also Tinasha jokes aren’t funny"

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Yas Mama Britney, give Baenash>E< that well deserved promo! BUY NIGHTRIDE ON ITUNES"

**skiddos**: "I just want TinashE to finally get a number one hit."

**Macubass**: "I C O N I C"

**mokitsu**: "This is the best song in the album! It's pure pop perfection, a super sexy song that sounds fresher every listen. I love how it builds up and I love R&B princess Tinashe's verses!"

**MrSwearword**: "This “Hotline Bling” beat and Tennis Shoe and that weird deep voice towards the end of the song detract heavily from the song."

**jackcs903**: "not sure if this is feat. tinashe or not but either way it's a great song"


**mgglite**: "i thought beyonce would get my eleven and britney my zero just going by what others had said about the albums but as it turns out it was the other way around"

**holly_foxxy**: "finally a bop! the kind of britney i'm here for."

**ProphecyPizza**: "This album has so many bops??help??"

**dirdbub**: "now THIS is an awesome song. Tinashe kills her part as well"

**enecks**: "This is to Glory what Hotline Bling is to Views- easily the best song, but still suffers from many of its problems"

**estreindre**: "the production on this is pretty nice and i love me some tinashe but... god, is it embarassing to listen to a fourty year old women to use slumber parties as a metaphor for sleep lmao."

**omgcow**: "This song is so fucking SEXY I liiiive for Britney dropping F bombs and “we use our bodies to make our own videos” is a great line."

**Joebiekong**: "It would have been a 9 if it wasn't for the milk licking"

**Palutzel**: "sounds great, not amazing, but it's solid pop"

**TonyRealm**: "The Tinashe remix elevates it to a whole new level, but the album version is quite good already."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "The ooh -ooh ooh -oooh elevates this song; the rest is middle of the road"

**havanabrown**: "I fuc with this song"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "YASSS COME THROUGH SLAY ME MOM I'M DEAD R.I.P. DEAD DEAD DEAD YAS i swear i'm not a britney stan guys"

**spacebabe27**: "Yas."

**superr_rad**: "TINASHE"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Easily the best track on the album, points docked because with or without the Tinashe the track sounds indistinguishable, which shouldn't be the case"

**bliamc**: "Best song on the normal edition, still shouldn’t have been the second single."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I wanted to drag this because it’s going to be top 5 and honestly it doesn’t deserve it but also I can’t lie it’s good and the video is better"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I listened to both the original and the Tinashe version of the song while listening to the album for the rate. Tinashe adds more life to this already great song!"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "as a gay dude i would slumber party with britney and tinashe if this song was included"

**Death_Soup**: "Bop. Though tbh it would have been considerably lower if not for my bae Tinashe."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This the song y'all were excited about? 🤔🤔🤔"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "the video kicks it up a notch"

**mother_rucker**: "My only critique is that Queen Tinashe is underutilized"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "The Spotify version of this song has Tinashe on it, so I'm reviewing that. I hope that's fine. Anyway, this is probably my favorite on the album. I'm already a big Tinashe fan, but I think Britney holds her own so honestly this song would probably get a 10 anyway. The beat is super smooth and the drum fill to the chorus is just insanely good. Chorus is definitely my favorite on the album too."

**qetaz**: "this is better. Maybe more interesting because there's two voices, giving it a bit more tone? But it also feels more danceable, I wasn't feeling any of the other songs but I was bopping along to this"

**Reifiui**: "And another pretty damn good song so far the album is going better than I expected!"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Hump me. Fuck me. My tunnel loves to deepthroat (it do)."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "the extra .5 is coming from that ICONIC music video"

**chihuahuazero**: "Nicki already did the “potion/overdosin” rhyme a few years ago, and even then it was cheesy. Sorry, Nicki."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Now this is some GODNEY right here. Incredible song."

**Therokinrolla**: "I’ve been told this song is good, but /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy?"

**huntyphobic**: "I like the song but I feel like Britney isn’t being original and is just jumping on the dark trop-pop bandwagon"

**SpanKKy1**: "There would be no sleeping at a Shawn Mendes slumber party"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "It gave us the best Britney video in years, and it had Tinashe in it. What's not to love?"

**leviOHsa**: "Now this is a fucking pop song. This is what I don’t understand, how can Britney (and her puppet masters) make a song this good, but not replicate this level? Honestly I think it’s a perfect pop song. I genuinely believe if this was the lead single and had decent promotion it would have charted very well."

**JohnnyToby**: "FINALLY A POP SONG jk but finally a GOOD song"

**blue_charles**: "If I had myself a hot boi this would be our make-out playlist just this one song on repeat that's it. Also that harmony/ad-lib from Britney at 2:50(ish) is the reason I wake up every morning."

**eklxtreme**: "amazing from the very first synth note, this production got me goin crazy"

**snidelaughter**: "This is really good."

**Yatcho**: "Took me until the music video to really come around to the sing but its one of my favorite Britney songs ever now."

**veryunfinished**: "i love tinashe!"

**Willybae00**: "I’d be lying if I said I don’t jump and scream whenever I hear this song come on. The intro is everything, the chorus is great, and I just love the way she says fortress."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "if the GP isn't going to be here for it then I sure as fuck am"

**twat_brained**: "The song + the sultry vocals + the video, esp. l i c c = a true return to form. I’m so proud I think I’m gonna cry."

**ImADudeDuh**: "One of the least memorable songs I have ever heard. I heard it 3 times before listening to it to judge it and I had no memory of it whatsoever." Welp, poor you!

This was one of my lowest scores. The only other lowest scores were Hard To Forget Ya (4) and Same Ol' Mistakes (0). In hindsight, those two were weight down by novelty, and I could've summoned a lot more ire if I was the one person to 0 "Slumber Party".

Unfortunately, it takes a lot for a professionally released song to go under 3 for me. If I didn't give Rihanna my 0, "Same Ol Mistakes" might've been a 4.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Gonna turn off my petty, dramatic hoe self off since this rate is officially over.

I just want to say that these albums on rate are equally great. I am impressed by Britney after the flop that is Britney Jean. I am surprised by how ANTI is not a messy album as I thought it would be. I am surprised how I would love Lemonade because I am not a Beyonce stan at all. And of course, I am happy that Queen Gaga was able to do something new for a change yet she was able to slay me.

Thank you /u/letsallpoo for hosting the messiest rate so far. QUEEN TBH.

Can't wait for the Emo Rate results hosted by /u/ffourthofjuly ! TEAM MCR. And also expect me to drag Panic! so much.

AND DON'T FORGET, MOTHER MONSTERS IS PERFORMING THE SUPERBOWL TODAY! YASS GAGA.
