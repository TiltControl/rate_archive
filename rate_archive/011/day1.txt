The 2016 Ultimate Album Rate, Day 1: Heeere We Go!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5rwrth/the_2016_ultimate_album_rate_day_1_heeere_we_go/

Hello my friends. I'm excited to get this started. Some notes:


* Follow along in the plug.dj! The link is [here](https://plug.dj/popheads/) if you've never been there. I'll be revealing songs there shortly before I post them here.

* I will start revealing songs at around 6pm. We'll begin with some bonus tracks before going on to the actual songs. I'm going from #59 to #31 today.

* I've included nearly everyone's comments, and I did my best to go through them and add cheeky responses and whatnot (please don't take them seriously). I wasn't able to do it for all of them though, and for that I apologize, but in my defense I didn't have much time to do the writeups.

* Controversy is a measure of how much voters disagreed. Think of it as an average of the differences between all of the scores. The average controversy was a 2.2, so anything above a 2.4 should be considered controversial.

* The average overall score was 7.1.

* I'll also be revealing the total points each song got. This is just a sum of everyone's scores (so it's equal to the average multiplied by the number of participants). I think this will be a good way of seeing how close some of these songs were.

* I'll also be revealing everyone's scores for every song, so none of you are safe from being exposed hihi.

That's it. Good luck to all of you. Also if anyone manages to guess the top 10 before I start I'll give you gold or something idk

Glorythra - an album by famous lip syncer and umbrella enthusiast Britney bitch

Bland-ti - an album with the bpm  of a rock

Lemonade - a pretty good album Tbh no complaints here

QUEEN JOANNE - an album by a fantastic and legendary singer songwriter that invented love, aunts, ferraris, masturbation, and the west

=====

potrap: *Glory* is excellent, but there are extreme highs and lows. The lows will affect its performance, considering the other three albums are more consistent.

The last rate I participated in was the first one (EMOTION v 1989 v DW) and the sabotage accusations really took the shine off of it. This is a pop music forum - the community may endorse the traditionally pop stylings of *Joanne* or *Glory*, or the more edgy experimental music of *Lemonade* or *ANTI*, or any combination thereof. It doesn't mean there was a hate campaign, it's just how these things go.

Ngl I just gave this a 10 because I wanted it to be higher than Taylor. It's a bit of a bop, and "LIKE BEEZ TO THE HONEY" is a fun line, even if it doesn't make any sense. I remember when this was released and I had to listen to it on Tumblr and I would just keep repeating it in the hopes that I would be brainwashed into loving it but it never quite worked. Now it's just great to meme with and play in the plug when we're shitposting.

(Note: The "Total Points" thing won't be that useful for the bonus tracks since they were optional and not everyone rated them all.)

Bye. This song just sounds really half-assed. Like the production is so basic and barely there. Zayn sounds so awkward and his falsetto comes out at really weird times, as if he can't stop prematurely ejaculating. Taylor sounds as sexy as a septic tank. Of course it'd be a hit, but I've lost faith in the GP long ago, so whatever.

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Oh my God, please just STOP it you moldy-ass piece of stale white bread. One of the most boring and generic songs released by a big artist this year, Rise sounds like a masterpiece compared to this... thing. If it wasn't by Taylor no one would even give this one a second listen, I guarantee it"

**BionicFunhouse**: "I just listened to the song and I don‚Äôt remember any of it."

**VodkaInsipido**: "Zayn is decent, üêç is not."

**skiddos**: "Terrible pop songs make me glad that I don't listen to the radio anymore"

**Macubass**: "invented sex"

**MrSwearword**: "Unpleasant but popular just like 50 Shades of Grey."

**gannade**: "if this is the zayn/taylor track this gets a 1, otherwise it gets a 5"

**ProphecyPizza**: "keep it"

**dirdbub**: "this song doesn‚Äôt make me want to live at all"

**JunkyGS**: "Blander then uncooked white rice sandwiched between a piece of wonder bread classic white and an unsalted cracker."

**omgcow**: "Zayn sounds awful on this, like a 99 cent store version of Usher or JT. Taylor is always grating."

**calltehshots**: "I wish I could give this a -100000"

**eribertknows**: "Snek deserves 0s for life but this song is ok."

**banananaise**: "Who wanted this???"

**Dracyoshi**: "I love Taylor, but if this is a taste of what her rumored "urban" album is going to sound like then I'm not going to be happy. IDWLF is incredibly forgettable and boring."

**havanabrown**: "I actually really like this song. The harmony at ‚Äúuntil you come back home‚Äù in the second chorus is so great"

**arandomgiraffe**: "Half the song sounds like hissing to me????"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "taylor i expected more from you"

**superr_rad**: "Okay, Taylor sounds amazing in this. If she had the song all to herself it would've ended up so much better. Zayn was trying a bit too hard."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The most bland, inoffensive song to come from a movie about hardcore sex, it‚Äôs so boring"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Closer but worse, at least the Chainsmokers and Halsey have some chemistry"

**bliamc**: "Boring, although I like Zayn‚Äôs falsetto"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "True fans lie to themselves about the quality of their newer releases"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I feel guility giving queen Taylor a bad score especially this is her only song on the rate but my god, I don't like this song. The production is‚Ä¶.not good. Zayn's vocals are so irritating. Taylor's vocals are actually okay but the moment she sings the pre-chrous, I am like "Gurlll, stop." Maybe the pre-chorus is just bad because Zayn sounded bad singing this part too. And those "Oh oh oh oh"s? Very cringey to hear."

**Death_Soup**: "why is this on here lmao"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "I love Taylor's "baby baby, I feel crazy", it makes the song to me."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "zayn's falsetto taught me how to feel aroused"

**Wailordfan**: "It is a grower, but Zayn still fucking sucks on the track, and the production is kinda messy. Taylor's bridge fucking slays, and the lyrics are amazing for a song made for a movie."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "You would think Zayn and T Swift would make a better song than this. Granted, they could collaborate and just make the song silent for 3 minutes (a la Pootie Tang), and hit #1. In fact, I might've preferred it over this snorefest. At least the chorus is somewhat catchy."

**Reifiui**: "After listening to this song I don't want to live at all"

**SkyBlade79**: "Taylor‚Äôs voice is pretty nice on this song, and I usually enjoy Zayn, but his falsetto is unbearable. The entire song is ruined by it, and it‚Äôs kind of really a shame."

**alternativeoxygen**: "i get a chills when taylor swift sings about wondering if she lost the love of her life but the rest of the song is average and i deducted a point for the dumb music video."

**JohnnyToby**: "honestly idk if this or rise is worse like kati I adored u bc u made catchy music not whatever rise is"

**ExtraEater**: "i've been thinking, we as humans have realized that it is a bad idea to live forever, and that we should live forever through our legacies. when taylor swift dies, people will remember her, but will it always be forever? when zayn dies, people might remember him, but will it always be forever? whatever idek i just expected more when i first discovered the title of this fucking song only to be disappointed by the damn lyrics"

**Willybae00**: "I honestly think this is one of the most boring singles by a major artist out there"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Zayn's falsetto is honestly annoying as shit but other than that it's okay."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Just awful, 2 people with no chemistry and voices that just don't work with the song."

**ExtraEater**: "Rise Beyond; Katy Perry was tightly strapped in her astronaut suit. As the first lucky anchor to report it had said, "This may sound absolutely absurd and impossible, but Katy Perry will be the first person, and first woman, to go to Mars." Katy remembers it all like it was just yesterday. After releasing Prism, she decided her next album would have a nice, spacey (+authentic) feel to it. And she thought just one lazy day, "Wow, what if I like, went to space to promote it." Somehow, this originally lighthearted idea came to fruition, and she actually contacted NASA about it. She underwent several years of education and training, but intentionally kept it a big secret from the public. During this time, she also managed to maintain her public appearance, release Rise, and craft KP4, to be released on the day she was to go to space. After the training was over, on August 24, 2017, NASA had fully tested and developed the technology to reach Mars. Of all the possible candidates, Katy was the one. Was it for publicity? Perry would probably report yes. Flash forward to now, this day October 28, 2017, just three days after her 33rd birthday. The rocket was set to rise. She could practically hear the news livecast playing Rise over the stream. This was it. To the final frontier..... "What? Ugh... Um, they wanted to me to report one more thing. Do I really have to--okay, fine! BUY KP4 ON ITUNES" The crowd cheered and Katy's billboard-topping lead single blared loudly in the background while his co-host was practically shitting herself with excitement. "oh she better meet some nice aliens up there", grumbled the almost apathetic old reporter."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "just when you thought we couldn't stoop any lower than Roar, well... we're here now."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Wow, Katy! Another self inspiring song, only this time with more generic lyrics and a very boring beat? How could this have possibly flopped?!"

A cute little track for an animated movie, but not much more to me. Rihanna's voice sounds kind of weird. Also I just included this because /u/PuggleMaster wanted me to and I wanted an even 10 bonus tracks lmao

**bliamc**: "It‚Äôs actually pretty catchy, but not anything memorable"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "A very interesting song choice to promote an animated movie. This song is not doing things for me but Rihanna's vocals should be noted."

**Death_Soup**: "Home had a really good soundtrack. Cannonball by Kiesza would've gotten a 10 from me."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "As bad as the movie it is attached to."

**SkyBlade79**: "This song does seem a bit long, but I really do like her voice during the chorus and pre-chorus. Its‚Äô great."

Sorry Awhile2 but I just can't stand this one. The guitars at the beginning immediately make me want to hit skip. Please don't kill me or nuke the sub. Also I meant to take out the "ft. Travis Scott" since he's not officially featured but people already sent in the scores so I just decided to leave it there. This song isn't worth the effort. 

---

Well, we might as well start with the song's sole 11-giver, **Awhile2**: "im gonna cry when this song gets cut on day one. I love the distorted guitar production and Rihanna‚Äôs aggressiveness ughhhhhhh". I hope your tears are short-lived cause we've got a long way to go. 

**JoeThaMo** seems to like it as well: "I don't get why so many people hate this song, it sounds great and fits the album's mood super well imo". 

**calltehshots** also praises it: "I feel like this would playing during a murder scene in a serial killer movie and I‚Äôm here for it." Imagine this being the last thing you hear before you die. #Yikes.

There were some other people who enjoyed the track as well. **superr_rad** is ready to fight half the sub: "I like this. The music is interesting and it's vibey. I think Travis Scott is great on it. Fight me." 

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** has her back, though: "I love that crunching guitar and the production in general, it‚Äôs probably the grittiest song on the album and gives me BBHMM teas which is always a good thing. I kinda wish Travis Scott had a full verse instead of doing Woos but Rihanna slays it. Wish more songs on this album were like it", as well as **BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "One of my favourites. I fucking love when she is a bad bitch." And I think **eklxtreme** also approves: "very interesting trap production that pretty much carries the song, major Travis Scott vibes (oh shit i didn‚Äôt look at the features and i was right". Well, at least she has the mods on her side. Oh, and **MrSwearword**: "Deliciously fucked up and evil. I love it."

**-dolantello-** is confused yet bopping: "I dont know what the fuck this is but it goes so hard every time". 

**JohnnyToby** seems to agree: "goes hard". **LuigiEatsPopcorn** praises a part of the song nobody else did: "I just love the chords to this song." Whatever you say, sis!

---

On the other side of things, the song had plentiful haters:

**skiddos**, who willingly listens to Demi Lovato: "I want my hearing back"

**Macubass**: "fucking trash"

**mokitsu**: "This song is messy and all over the place but I love the production and Rih's vocal delivery! This grew on me a lot!"

**Rourke_**: "It overstays its welcome, should either be shortened or it should develop more"

**mgglite**: "sounds like some high school kid fucking around with a synthesizer at the back of a music store"

**holly_foxxy**: "i want to like this song So Bad but i just get so bored"

**ProphecyPizza**: "starts off good, but it gets boring REAL quick."

**MihaMijat** just looked at his flair again: "Ew" 

**enecks**: "This song sounds janky and unpleasant"

**estreindre**: "tbh i feel like i should hate this song but it works in a really weird way for me??"

**SpanKKy1** has diagnosed the sympton, but perhaps not the cause: "This production gave me an aneurysm". Are you sure that's not because of the other music you enjoy listening to?

**omgcow**: "I feel like there‚Äôs just a lil bit too much being done to the vocals. Kinda sounds like a demo tbh"

**Palutzel** is not here for Rih's ARTPOP: "what. is. this. experimental? no, just plain bad."

**Death_Soup**: "wtf is this? Love you Rih, but this is awful."

**soeri**, who used this comment for way too many songs so I'm going to be shady with these now on: "trash"

**Itsafudgingstick** brings up one of Britney's best for some reason: "Be happy that Private Show exists". But that's a 10/10?

**dirdbub** is just confused: "what is this? literally what is going on"

**NapsAndNetflix** echoes what calltehshots says: "the instrumental sounds like the score to a horror movie and I mean that in a bad way"

---

Also, some people just drag Travis, who I should have left out of the title but whatever:

**JunkyGS**: "Travis & the chorus ruin the song, but I love the production, the lyrics (listen to that opening line!) and Rihanna serves vocals per usual."

**TonyRealm**: "This sounds cheap, like they made it 5 minutes. It‚Äôs really repetitive, Travis is meh, the effects on Rihanna‚Äôs voice are somewhat intriguing but nowhere near enough to save this."

**blue_charles**: "I both love and hate the beat, which is big, plodding and sometimes to the detriment to the song overshadows Rihanna. Not as wild about Travis' adlibs either, they feel super tacked on and the song does seem to overstay it's welcome at nearly 4 minutes."

I can't tell if **snidelaughter** is praising or dragging Travis, but I'm throwing his comment in this section anyway: "This is actually really worse than I remember it being. Rihanna's the saving grace on the song, but Travi$ Scott is a bad influence on this song. The vocal effects are kinda annoying because Rihanna really doesn't need them. It might work if Travi$ were the vocalist, but Rihanna doesn't have the edge he has in his voice, even if she has the better voice."

**ImADudeDuh**: "NGL, I was waiting for Travis the show up the whole time..."

**SkyBlade79**: "The production is jarring and frankly bad, Travis adds nothing, but I do like her vocals on this song. They‚Äôre nice and varied."

**veryunfinished**: "weeoooweeooow. the verses aren‚Äôt bad but something about the chorus is really grating."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Can I get paid to just go 'woooooo' on a Rihanna track too?"

**seferre2**: "this song is so gritty...... i never knew this was travis but that woooooo is creepy"

**huntyphobic**: "The wooing makes me want to die but i appreciate the rest of the song."

And some people were mostly ambivalent:

**Therokinrolla**: "Apparently not many people like this one but its not bad tbh"

**havanabrown**: "The beat is pretty intense. Makes me wanna punch a wall or something"

**BlasiFeelsSwift** is very descriptive: "this isn't that bad"

**Willybae00**: "also feels like a filler to me"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this song isn't bad but it doesn't really go anywhere"

**jamesfog**: "This is usually a song I skip"

**bliamc**: "The autotune is pretty awful on here."

**tiltheendoftheline**: "I quite like this but it gets boring fast."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I love the way this sounds."

**Wailordfan**: "Eh. Super forgettable. Don't like the production here."

Anyway, fuck this song. Here's other comments.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** is too nice, which will be a recurring theme once again: "This song is not that bad as some people would say. But I can understand why this song may not be generally well-liked. The guitar hook was nice as an intro but the fact that the hook is in the enitre song makes this song hard to listen to on replay. Also, Rihanna sounds like she recorded her vocals on a tin can. This song has potenital to be great but the end result is just mediocre at best."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Almost halfway through, decided already that I don't like Rihanna's slow tunes. Thank god it's such a short album."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "One of my personal favorites. I was concerned going in, because I didn't know how Travi$' style would translate to Rihanna's. However, the song is fantastic. In fact, she does the druggy distorted guitars just as well as Travi$ does, and it would be dope to see more collars like this."

**qetaz**: "I'm not into the synths, or the distortion of her voice. Again, the style is not really my thing. Oddly though, I can imagine this working really well in certain movies. Actually it's begging for a place on a dark soundtrack!!"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Q:What even is this song? A:A mess."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "that last minute boosted it half a point for me"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** has perhaps the strangest comparison in the entire rate: "Is this a worse 6 inch knockoff? Yes. Did it come out before 6 inch? Yes. Do I care? No."

**ExtraEater**: "I highkey just gave this a 1 because of raicicle." Poor /u/raicicle. He didn't even give this his 0!

**VioletChutzkee**: "I don't think this sub likes this song very much, but I think it's dope."

**joshually**: "I took the Strength Finders test a few years ago and found one of my 'strengths' to be Woo. This basically means I am persuasive and am good at getting others to see my POV and/or do my bidding. This song is not that. It's not strong, persuasive or like any good at all."

And let's conclude with **twat_brained**: "This track is messy. End of discussion." Agreed. Let's move on to better songs now.

How could I not give this a 10? Honestly a huge bop that perfectly shows off Britney's quirky personality without descending into that weird cabaret hell like on Glory's actual bad tracks. Her voice never bothered me that much either. Like there are annoying tracks on this album but this isn't one of them to me. I know a lot of y'all vehemently disagree with me though, so that's all I'll say on that.

edit: There were too many comments so they're in a reply to this.

letsallpoo: 
I lovingly call this first section, "People Making Fun of Britney's Voice":

**cloudbustingmp3**: "she sounds like a slutty chipmunk trying to yodel and it doesn't work, oh at all"

**JoeThaMo**: "I know that this song is a mess and that Britney sounds like Kermit the frog, but it's just so damn catchy... WERK IT WERK IT"

**BionicFunhouse**: "What is wrong with her voice?? LMAO ‚Äúwerkit werkit‚Äù"

**twat_brained**: "'AI POOT OWN UH PRAaAaAVIT SHAOW' You might as well make this song private because anyone who listens to this song and enjoys it needs a hearing check. Especially with that tragic rap at the bridge. ‚ÄúCan we do it again?‚Äù Let‚Äôs NEVER do it again, Brit boo."

**melisanyans**: "This is gonna do so poorly in the rate but come on!! I seriously love the helium vocals. They work. The production is TRYING, and in my opinion is WORKING. It's supposed to be silly!" Dddd at "helium vocals".

**skiddos** has accidentally played a Selena track: "Why they gotta make Britney sound like a chicken". (**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** somehow also did?: "What is this weaksauce hands to myself rip off?")

**MrSwearword**: "SICK fucking beat but sick vocals in that Britney sounds like Elmo with a head cold on the chorus."

**holly_foxxy**: "idk if it's the vocal production but this track makes me feel so uncomfortable"

**marcryan**: "Serving Chicken Realness"

**joshually**: "This song is as laborious to listen to as I'm sure it was for Britney to record the vocals. It just feels like you are constantly being punched in the side of your head by her voice and the beat. I'd love a stripped down acoustic cover of this song for one of her shows. That'll show them!" I cannot for the life of me imagine Britney singing anything acoustic but I guess I'd be here for it?

**Yatcho**: "Something is... off with her voice and she just can't carry this simple production. The song is honestly just annoying"

**enecks**: "Sounds like a parody of a nightcore version of a glee version of itself"

**omgcow**: "There was SO much potential here but the rubber duck chipmunk vocals ruin it. Britney is my fave but she deserves to get dragged for this one. If Perfect Illusion wasn‚Äôt such horse shit this would be in the running for a zero."

**TonyRealm**: "This track has fun written all over it, and I feel the ‚Äúchipmunk‚Äù vocals, although odd, are part of that package (and I got used to them quickly). The part that actually annoys me is the bridge; those spoken parts are really jarring. (I also don‚Äôt like apple pie.)"

**havanabrown** has the meanest comment: "wow those Lana influences are strong"

Or does **spacebabe27**?: "Sounds like a rejected Fergie track from her 'experimental' EP."

Nevermind, **Palutzel** does: "booored, this one sounds like a meghan trainor song and it‚Äôs not really a good thing". **Nerdy_boy_chris** adds to the insults: "Britney‚Ä¶what is this Meghan Trainor ripoff? This sounds like You Gotta Not TBH"

**Willybae00**: "I personally like this song a lot but I can understand why people hate on the chipmunk vocals. I think the song could be far better if her voice was softer, not because of the high pitch but because its supposed to be a sensual song and she sounds a little too aggressive on it. I would also get rid of the ‚Äúwatch me spin it and twerk it‚Äù part because it makes me think of a high school girl losing her virginity and trying to act sexy with a few hits and misses. At the end of the day I give it a solid 6 because it‚Äôs a fun song, I don‚Äôt skip it, but I would definitely make some changes if I had the opportunity."

**SkyBlade79** took AP Chemistry: "Oh god‚Ä¶ where do I even start. This is the biggest mess I‚Äôve seen all year. The production is a complete shitfest, her voice sounds like she‚Äôs a 12 year old messing with sulfur hexafluoride. Her saying that she‚Äôll twerk it is so horrible, and ‚Äúpull my curtains until they close‚Äù‚Ä¶ what the fuck. This better be out first."

**eklxtreme**: "brtiney‚Äôs voice is weird here and that‚Äôs what kinda throws me off, i don‚Äôt know what mood she‚Äôs trying to go for here cus it feels messy"

**arandomgiraffe**: "so much screeching"

**blue_charles**: "When this was released as a promo, I was actually terrified for what Glory was going to be. Decapitated chicken vocal realness."

**eribertknows**: "What the fuck is this? She sounds like she's being forced to sing."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "she sounds like a deflating balloon and i love it!"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "This was one track that didn't need a replay because the ribbiting hook is still burned into my auditory nerve"

**mother_rucker**: "It‚Äôs a cute-sounding song, but her vocals are not good here"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "Her voice is REALLY annoying here."

**seferre2**: "could've been so much better if britney would just stop holding her nose while singing :/"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I didn't hate this song as much as everyone else on popheads. However, Britney's vocals sounded really weird so it's understanable why they would be so off-guard by it but I apperciate Britney's ambition with this song."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I hope this sub doesn't skin me alive, but I've never been a Britney fan, and I never really loved her voice. This song is kinda grating to me, and the lyrics don't do the instrumental any justice. This song also goes on a minute too long."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I could bop to the beat a little but the vocals and hook are both really bad, she sounds like she‚Äôs sucking helium, as the song goes on even the beat just becomes annoying and repetitive"

**veryunfinished**: "what‚Äôs wrong with her voice‚Ä¶ this song isn‚Äôt bad necessarily. the melody and the production are actually pretty nice, but she really sounds like she‚Äôs squawking. this is also like two minutes longer than it needs to be, and it‚Äôs only four minutes long."

**Reifiui**: "Good god she sounds like an autotuned witch and / or a frog this is so bad"

**leviOHsa**: "Okay I can get into this. I wish she got rid of the baby voice though, it doesn‚Äôt fit the song." IT'S HER NATURAL VOICE.

Kay so this is over the character limit so I have to remove some comments but these were my faves of what's left:

11-giver **Lopes14** has something to say: "masterpiece tbh no song is like this". His accomplice in crime **SpanKKy1** is also TEMPTING me: "I'll give you a private show poo üòâ, if you rig the rate and get this #1"

**VodkaInsipido**: "Not even Shakespeare could compare a pussy to an apple pie."

**JunkyGS**: "Britney sounds so confident, comfortable and having fun. Listen to the conviction in her voice, she is really getting into the song and owning it compared to other songs where you can tell she is just going through the motions." Yes, defend your fave!

**Macubass** has a shocking confession: "i actually like this"

**MihaMijat**: "How is this on the album but Mood Ring isn't?"

**calltehshots**: "I'm cackling. This song is an actual mess but it's such campy fun I'm not mad at it."

**mokitsu** has lost faith in humanity: "Does anyone like this song? Is that possible? It's a fun song but kills the memento real quick real soon."

**Awhile2**: "this song is gross and i hate you poo for making me listen to it again". I bet you hate me even more since your 0 beat your 11.

I'm not sure if **a_rain_of_tears** likes this song or not: "i'm shaking to it"

**Wailordfan**: "I actually don't hate this despite how it got pretty below average reaction from the sub. It doesn't sound like she is trying to be as seductive as she is trying to go for a raspy sound instead of her typical nasal. I actually love the production too. Honestly the best of the three I've heard so far."

**Raykel**: "This song is so polarizing. Half of it is amazing and gives me classic vibes, but then the werk it part comes on and goes into that weird bridge. I love the rest though."

**chihuahuazero**: "This is the most ‚Äúmom‚Äù song of the album, which is unfortunate. I should be appalled at how she managed to make the 3/4 time signature trashy. I haven‚Äôt seen that from a Top 40 act in a while. However, the line ‚Äúslide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it‚Äù establishes this as an occasional guilty pleasure." I'm not sure how a song about pole dancing is a mom song but I'm not here to judge people's families. 
**JohnnyToby** agrees though: "Like it‚Äôs not a bad song but the lyrics are really extra. The only people that would ‚Äútwerk‚Äù to this would be suburban white moms (and 2 popheads users)". Is that shade towards the 11-givers?

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Okay what the hell is this Britney I was just about to say this album was good"

**Therokinrolla**: "this song needed to remain private". Bitch.

**huntyphobic** sums up their music taste: "This is trash but I love it." **patronsaintofaspies** as well: "This is a massive guilty pleasure. It's not a good song by any means, but Britney sounds so cute here."

**-dolantello-**: "delet this"

Here's the first of **ExtraEater**'s stories they may or may have not written while high: "The Modern-Day Greek Hero; There existed a man that saved even the worst from the pits of hellfire. In the modern day, he knew that even those who did nothing wrong did not deserve to burn forever. Deep within the flaming fires of the underworld, there lied a disc deep within the ices of the ninth circle of hell. It was an album. 'Glory' by Britney Spears. This hero went into the cold ice just to save it. Thanks to this man, Glory was restored to its true glory. This man's name? SpanKky1. 'I just didn't think Private Show was that bad' ~Actual quote by him"

Finally, **superr_rad** is one of the 5 people on this sub who listened to Glory Days: "Little Mix who?" I'm sure half this sub asks this whenever their music gets posted here.

You don't know my family. An open-minded approach to sexuality is the key to nurturing healthy relationships.

...Nah, I just called it a "mom song" since Britney was trying to act like the kids by channeling today's pop artists, only to come off as totally radical.

Yeah I love James Blake but when this song is just on its own it's kinda pointless lmao. And even in the context of the visual film I didn't fully understand its purpose besides sending a generic message of moving forward (but I'm probably missing something). The downsides to this track are obvious; Beyonce literally has like one line, James doesn't have that many either, and it's not even two minutes long. The visuals from the movie that accompany this song though? Sent chills down my spine. If we were rating that, this would be a 10.

---

Blah blah blah James Blake blah blah blah.

**chubs4life** is a true pophead: "Who tf is James Blake?" **VodkaInsipido** answers them: "FUCK Y'ALL WHO THINK THIS SONG DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE IN THE ALBUM BECAUSE BEYONC√â HAS JUST A LINE. My boy James kills it on his features, as always, and he has made it to I-collab-with-Bey status. The only but you can say about this song is that it's just 78 seconds of pure gold."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Another track that I love more than others, Forward is my favorite interlude in this rate. James Blake brings his own flair to this glitchy, dissonant track, and the seamless transition from Sandcastles makes this a really impactful interlude. I honestly like the sound better than some of the songs on The Colour of Anything."

**dirdbub**: "this deserves to be longer than a minute. James killed it with Bey"

**skiddos**: "I don't really like James Blake nor do I like this noise"

**mokitsu**: "Yes this is one of the best songs of the album because the line 'I love you more than this job/Please don't work for me' cuts deep! Also James Blake's voice fits perfectly with Bey's. I'm tempted to say it has the best lyrics in the album!"

**MrSwearword**: "She doesn‚Äôt do a damn thing on this track. She lets James Blake have this AND condenses this to an interlude length. ARGH. NO."

**estreindre** is being a tad blasphemous: "i feel like james blake is a lot better at doing ballads than beyonce is, but i don't really like the end of the album very much." **TonyRealm** as well: "I wish this was longer (so I can hear more James Blake heh)."

**Wailordfan**: "I love James' voice, so this was very nice to me." **tiltheendoftheline**: "I hate James' voice."

**eklxtreme**: "James Blake is great"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** wishes he were rating The Colour in Anything: "I fucking love James Blake and he kills this, I wish he made a full version without Bey"

**snidelaughter**: "I like James Blake, but this is okay. Not bad, just okay."

**veryunfinished** is communicating with us from the depths of James Blake's anus: "i‚Äôm so far up james blake‚Äôs ass... it's a problem. i feel weird giving it such a high score for an interlude but i know it'll probably be an outlier and also this song gives me chills because i can't disassociate it from the film."

**twat_brained** has constructive criticism: "James is so predominantly featured on this song, you'd be forgiven if you thought he was the main artist. Also, that ending is really out of place. All this for a 1:19 song? She should've Partition'd it with Sandcastles." **enecks** lowkey agrees: "It bleeds so well into Sandcastles that I can‚Äôt listen to one without the other. That having been said, this is the better part."

We'll finish this with the worst one, courtesy of **banananaise**: "I only JUST realised James Blake is different to James Blunt". Sis. **SpanKKy1**, of course, steals a joke I made in the plug.dj: "I love James Blunt". Unoriginal.

---

**JunkyGS**: "FORWARD". Yes that is indeed the name of the song, good job!

**MihaMijat** basically explains my thought process when rating this: "This is waaay to short to justify giving it a better score"

**mgglite**: "i closed sandcastles and opened this one and i had to check i hadn't opened sandcastles again by mistake. was whoever produced this album scared that if any of the songs had a bpm of over 110 anyone listening would have a heart attack and die?"

**angusaditus**: "I'd love it more it was longer and if Beyonce was more priminent, but I still think it's a great song that plays such an important role in the narrative. I especially love the line 'I love you more than this job please don't walk from me' UGH it gets me every time"

**holly_foxxy**: "ugh if bey had sung the whole thing my score would probably be much higher but... nah... boring..."

**JamesTheGent**: "Why is this on the album?"

**ProphecyPizza**: "....yikes"

**blue_charles**: "An effective and haunting, if kinda bland transition track. Nothing special, aside from some of the interesting effects put on the voices near the end."

**omgcow**: "Seems really out of place"

**calltehshots**: "And this is what I had to listen to after Trashcastles? SMH Beyonce, wyd?"

**Palutzel**: "i really don't understand these 1 minute songs.. and this is also boring and creepy"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** commands us: "skip"

**havanabrown**: "I don‚Äôt really know what to make of it cus of how short it was"

**spacebabe27**: "It's an interlude, and not a very striking one at that."

**soeri** needs a lesson on how to score properly: "i hate this song but i wanna be a contrarian"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "It's a simple interlude, and does what it's meant to do"

**jamesfog**: "Not a fun listening experience". Something something "it's not supposed to be fun, it's supposed to make you feel things!" something something.

**bliamc**: "It‚Äôs so overlooked but so good."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "great transition, but should've just been tacked on to Sandcastles because then i'd have a reason to listen to Sandcastles"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I won't be quite harsh to this song unlike Sandcastles because in the context of the album, it makes sense. But the song itself, boring."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Bey isn't suited to slow songs but still better than anti"

**Death_Soup**: "Boringggg. Glad it's only 1:20"

**Bannerww**: "ugh delete this form citronade and we can talk"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Worst song on the album, but still fantastic."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "wtf is this interlude girl goodnight"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "would've given it a nine had it been a full song."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "legit these past three songs ruin the album for me"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "I like how the meh songs on this album are much much better than the meh songs on the rest of the albums in this rate."

**Zugtris**: "i'm partly biased as a james blake stan, and this is a bit out of his field but still love it. also i cant stress the importance of this to the cohesiveness of the album, both topically and sonically."

**Therokinrolla**: "I can‚Äôt say much more other than this bored me." Didn't your parents teach you to not say anything if you don't have anything nice to say?

**huntyphobic**'s scores just got removed: "it‚Äôs an interlude so I‚Äôm ok with letting this flop so the other Lemonade songs can rise (just kidding pls do not remove my scores from the rate)."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Where did Beyonce go?"

**joshually**: "What is this song even?"

**Willybae00**: "It serves a purpose as a part of the album, but it contributes nothing to me as a stand alone."

potrap: > Yeah I love James Blake but when this song is just on its own it's kinda pointless lmao. And even in the context of the visual film I didn't fully understand its purpose besides sending a generic message of moving forward (but I'm probably missing something).

I think it's meant to represent an external "voice of reason" that cuts through Beyonc√©'s haze of emotions and investment in Jay and reminds her of the love and domesticity of their life before he cheated.

Then "Freedom" represents her new sense of focus, and "All Night" is the resolution to the narrative based on what she has realised.

Did that make any sense?

I seriously debated leaving this one out because, like, what is this doing on the album? I guess it was just meant to divide the standard and the deluxe tracks or something? But Rihanna I'm pretty sure did nothing with this besides use it to advertise shoes, so like, what? Florence is great, yes, but Only If For a Night isn't even close to the best from Ceremonials. Everything about this perplexes me.

---

In which people ask for a full length track as if the original Florence song doesn't already exist:

**JamesTheGent**: "Again, would have been perfect if it was longer."

**dirdbub**: "GODDAMN THIS SONG. should have been a longer song tho :("

**JoeThaMo**: "I still think this deserves to be a full-length track tbh"

**calltehshots**: "This slays idc I wish it was a full song"

**eribertknows**: "This should be a full song too!"

---

And here's people just being confused:

**huntyphobic**: "like ok????? Im into it tbh"

**MihaMijat**: "What is this doing here"

**omgcow**: "Why"

**qetaz**: "what the hell is this"

**DrunkHurricane**: "What the fuck is this"

**Palutzel**: "y is this even considered a song? the beat is nice, but it feels unnecessary"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "??Ok?? Gets some points for reminding me of Lost in the World."

**havanabrown**: "What ok not sure what the point in that was"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "wtf is this?"

**snidelaughter**: "I haven't heard the deluxe before this rate. Um, that was kinda pointless."

**superr_rad**: "this is...what? is this? what was the point? i dont get it?"

**eklxtreme**: "starts out interesting but it's weird and I'm lost"

**bliamc**: "I didn‚Äôt even know how to rate this?? I‚Äôm not sure what is going here?? Why is this on Anti?? Why does this exist at all??"

---

Florence Florence Florence Florence:

**Macubass**: "florence welch's is better, really boring tbh" Florence's what? Album? If so, agreed. 

**jackcs903**: "Cool production, but its literally just a repeated sample of a fatm song and kinda unnecessary"

**VodkaInsipido**: "ADELE IS SHOOK THAT SHE WASN'T CHOSEN"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "this is only so high because of the f+tm sample"

**mother_rucker**: "Perfectly acceptable interlude, very average ‚ÄúOnly If For A Night‚Äù remix"

**skiddos**: "Remember when we all thought Rih was gonna collaborate with Florence, and then Rih released this contraption? So sad."

**mokitsu**: "Sadly they got the rights to use one the best Florence songs and turned it into a GarageBand remix!"

**gannade**: "wow ok well riri destroyed flo's song so it's a 0, but flo's song is a 10 so i'll just average it out"

**JunkyGS**: "Florence sample is dope, but not really a song? lol"

**banananaise**: "Florence made her way into both Rih and Gags' albums - your fave could never". **chihuahuazero**: "Best Florence appearance in the thread. Sorry, ‚ÄúHey Girl‚Äù."

**spacebabe27**: "The Florence sample is really well used, but this song is obviously not meant to be a full-length track." Is it still a sample if like...it's all they used?

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "this is what you get if you tie up Only If For A Night in the studio and torture it"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is amazing but the song loses a .5 point for basically being 'Only If For A Night (Rihanna Remix)'. I wished this becomes a full song instead of being a shameless sample with Rihanna's vocals."

**holly_foxxy**: "this just sounds like music for a really long fan edit... like, a good fan edit, but still a fan edit."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "i love Only If For A Night but this is so lazy lmao"

**Zugtris**: "uhhh, you have no idea how excited i was when rumors were going around that rih was covering a f+tm-song, then we ended up with this. still like it tho lmao"

**Therokinrolla**: "A sample from Florence, so plus 10 points. However, distorted and ruined, so minus 4"

---

...Batman?

**ExtraEater**: "Gotham, Batman. Batman, Catwoman. Catwoman, Halle Berry. The Catwoman movie with Halle Berry flopped. Conclusion, Rihanna is calling herself a flop."

**SpanKKy1**: "Batman is shook"

**leviOHsa**: "Delete it Batman." Automod is shook. 

---

And the rest:

**joshually**: "If you put a gun to my head and forced me to describe to you what this song was about, you'd have to blow my brains out."

**MrSwearword**: "Gurl bye, not even bothering to record your own fucking vocals over this."

**Bingcrusher**: "You ain't the dark NIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHTNIGHT"

**mgglite** goes too far: "half of this album is aspiring to be this song"

**TonyRealm** goes even farther: "This is like if Carly took Halsey‚Äôs ‚ÄúColors Pt. II‚Äù and put it on her E‚Ä¢MO‚Ä¢TION album‚Ä¶why is it there, because it‚Äôs better than her own stuff? (I‚Äôm just playin‚Äô /r/popheads don‚Äôt kill me) I get that Rihanna used the song for some fashion ad she was in, but I‚Äôm surprised it made it on the album. Must be the lyrics."

**enecks**: "I don‚Äôt like how the goodnights in this sound"

**ImADudeDuh**: "'Goodnight Gotham?' More like 'unlistenablemess.mp3'"

**estreindre**: "fucking weird and i LOVE that, but it does get a bit repetitive."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I know this is basically pointless to the album but It‚Äôs a fire instrumental and sample flip"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I should love this but aside from a looping background this is just the same sample played over and over with no edition by Rihanna, Pass."

**Awhile2**: "I love rihanna so much for putting all this experimental music on ANTI"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "it's not my type of banger but i'm taking what i can get at this point"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is how you do chopped up vocals Kiiara!"

**blue_charles**: "Great way to pick the energy back up after Close to You, and the slow but amazing build throughout works so so good. I think this could have been an awesome album opener, tbh." You want everyone to fall asleep before Rihanna actually sings a note?

**Wailordfan**: "Actually not terrible, as it kinda set a weird tone after the long blank space. Just weird. Not really needed."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's just a little interlude, and it's cool, but I wish Rihanna had some vocals on this. Instrumental is good, though."

**femaleghostbuster**: "This song is constantly stuck in my head and I don't even like it"

**Raykel**: "I'm such a sucker for experimental interludes. They never fail to be interesting."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "The Cyber-raga of this album." I gave that an 8 and I don't get the hate for that song tbh.

**SkyBlade79**: "I really enjoy this. Doesn‚Äôt even have lyrics but her producers get to shine. This would‚Äôve been a great intro track imo, but at least we get it now."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Pointless but okay"

**alternativeoxygen**: "This song manages to be more disappointing than James Joint." Yikes!

**JohnnyToby**: "interesting I guess"

**seferre2**: "not bad i guess but i'm not a fan of interludes"

**veryunfinished**: "i don't hate this? i wouldn't be able to tolerate an entire album like this from rihanna but a minute is fine."

**twat_brained**: "The instrumental is pretty cool, but I listened to this album to hear Rihanna sing, not some instrumental interludes. What a waste of a deluxe track."

A trashy bop, but perhaps a little too trashy for the userbase's tastes. It screams 'bonus track,' and it would fit well on Unapologetic I guess, but not really here.

---

Apologies for not reacting to the comments but I ran out of time :(

**VodkaInsipido**: "Although is good, it's way better as a bonus track. It doesn't fit into the album. Also when Hit Boy is good he is really good."

**skiddos**: "This is hot trash, slay me muva"

**Macubass**: "yaaasss left me shook"

**mokitsu**: "Yes!!!! The production here is INSANE. A fucking club banger!!"

**MrSwearword**: "Her vocals are all over the place like a motherfucker but this beat bangs hard as fuck."

**Bingcrusher**: "We get it, your hardcore.."

**mgglite**: "i don't know why i like it but i do"

**holly_foxxy**: "yassssss bitch"

**JamesTheGent**: "Just...no."

**ProphecyPizza**: "This was my most listened to song of 2016, idk what that says about me"

**dirdbub**: "yaassssss bitch"

**JunkyGS**: "Production I don't like and find obnoxious, but this is the most light hearted song on the album. Maybe I could twerk to this if I was really drunk?"

**MihaMijat**: "What is this doing here"

**enecks**: "This is what haters of Work think it sounds like"

**omgcow**: "At first listen I was like ‚Äúthis is awful‚Äù but by the end I was bopping and now I love it"

**calltehshots**: "lol wtf is this"

**Wtucker4**: "Album Ruiner"

**eribertknows**: "Why?"

**MariahGr8rThnJesus**: "sounds like mashing random chords on a Casio‚Ñ¢ keyboard"

**Palutzel**: "if it's unique, it doesn't mean that it's good"

**TonyRealm**: "Oh God no. This track is so stunningly sloppy and devoid of hype that I actually feel bad."

**Dracyoshi**: "At least it's only two minutes of torture."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "What is this unapologetic reject doing on this album?"

**havanabrown**: "This song makes me wanna bite a chain for a photo"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "god is dead and rihanna killed him"

**spacebabe27**: "I love this so much, the only thing is having Rihanna be so high-pitched and nasally the entire song."

**superr_rad**: "well this was obv produced around the time of BBHMM lmao"

**soeri**: "youd think for someone whose nipples are more famous than she is making a good hoe anthem would be easy"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Trashy bop, YAAAAAAAAAAAS BITCH"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Trashy as fuck but I will always jam to this"

**bliamc**: "I hate myself for kinda liking this. It‚Äôs awful but also kind of good‚Ä¶"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "This sounds like she‚Äôs on a cheap keyboard and is just fucking around with the pre-inserted sounds, and then put vocals over it like her and her friends are in middle school and just learned how to swear and want to be sexual like the Pussycat Dolls"

**Awhile2**: "Another track that clearly resulted from Travis Scott‚Äôs influence"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song is good but this song low-key gives me BBHMM teas. BBHMM should have replaced this song as a bonus track tbh."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "rihanna sings about how rich she is but i don't have a clue how if her entire discography is like this"

**Death_Soup**: "http://imgur.com/XPn6ycm"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "I hate these bonus tracks."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "giving me Loud vibes I live."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Why do I hear the iPhone message sent confirmation tone?"

**mother_rucker**: "The perfect song for pussy popping."

**Wailordfan**: "If Ke$ha met Avril Lavigne I think and made a song for RIH. I don't know. This is just so odd. Not in a good way."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "A very BBHMM-esque track. My issue with it is that Rihanna's vocals and lyrics are much weaker on this than BBHMM. However, theres a good amount of points here for that crazy unorthodox beat. Seriously, listen to it, it's super weird."

**qetaz**: "this has no redeeming qualities at all. The album was going so well but these bonus tracks are TRASH."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "My ADHD ass can't with this song."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt fucking with no broke bitch‚Äù there goes my chances with rihanna"

**SkyBlade79**: "Sassy, kind of Beyonce - esque, and the production is really bizarre but good. This could totally be a Miley song without the n-bombs."

**chihuahuazero**: "One of my cross-country teammates really loved the word ‚Äúflaccid‚Äù. This song reminds me of him. Side note: he graduated early and didn‚Äôt stay for indoor track. That‚Äôs alright; I‚Äôm not doing indoor track either."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Meh"

**Therokinrolla**: "For a Rihanna bonus track, it isn‚Äôt the worst. However its a mess of a track and I feel like little effort was put into it"

**huntyphobic**: "YASSSSS BITCH!!!! When Rih says ‚ÄúPOSE BITCH‚Äù YASSS GAWD my bussy is POSING and POPPING"

**SpanKKy1**: "What a fucking messy pose"

**leviOHsa**: "I she trying to be a poor man‚Äôs MIA. I felt like I was having a stroke. Who let this happen?"

**alternativeoxygen**: "Also, which one of you wrote the genius.com description for this song LOL"

**JohnnyToby**: "damn I didn‚Äôt know she made music too"

**blue_charles**: "I want to like it, but it's just a little too atonal and all over the place for me."

**VioletChutzkee**: "obnoxious tbh"

**eklxtreme**: "this slaps but it gets boring at the end"

**joshually**: "Much like Diana Ross sings in the love theme to her movie Mahogany, I ask this song: Do you know where you're going to? Seriously. Where is this song going? It went nowhere and too many places all at once."

**snidelaughter**: "Interesting production. Not-so-interesting lyrics, and her bravado is weirdly not strong enough to carry it, which is odd considering her bravado was the highlight for the rest of the album."

What we need, maybe, but is this what we want? For me, I'm not sure if the former or latter apply. Britney tries this weird cabaret thing which just accenuates her...**unique** studio voice and everything quickly just becomes unpleasent. I can't believe this was the closer on the standard edition.

---

Once again, Britney's vocals are the main talking point:

**skiddos**: "She's not exactly a powerhouse vocalist but this is still pretty good"

**Macubass** drags Xtina: "omg christina aguilera teas". **spacebabe27** sort of does as well: "This sounds like a nightcore Xtina song."

**MihaMijat** DRAGS BRITNEY TO THE PITS YAS SLAY: "Vocals". WOO, SIPPING ON THE TRUTH TEA, HUNTY!

**Palutzel**: "great vocals, but i'm bored :("

**ImADudeDuh**: "Britney woke up"

**TonyRealm**: "Britney makes an admirable attempt to channel Duffy here."

**Dracyoshi**: "By far the worst track on Glory. There is nothing to like about this song. Her vocals are grating, the production is bland, the lyrics are terrible and the song is ridiculously repetitive. Brit, I know you could do better than this."

**Zugtris**: "duffy/joanne/??? could never?" How do so many people remember Duffy?

**misguidedzombie**: "Best she's ever sounded."

**Therokinrolla**: "Y I K E"

**Death_Soup**: "What I need is to never listen to this again."

**tiltheendoftheline**: "This is everything I hate about Britney's voice."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Sis, your vocals are not there."

**dirdbub** has lost his marbles: "literally what the fuck is this shit. like. this.. literally what the fuck was she on when she made this? what? I.. what?? I don‚Äôt think you have what I want right now?? which is a good song?? Britney, what the fuck is this?????"

**Yatcho**: "Hun this is beyond your talents, leave this kind of song to Fergie and Christina they could do it in their sleep." But would anyone listen to it?

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Stop screaming Britney. Also stop reapeating yourself. Stop screaming."

**joshually**: "This is like Andy Grammar channeling a giant hairy drag queen tottering around in 7' heels. It ain't pretty, but it's at least memorable..." Yikes, not Andy Grammar.

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is a great example of what Britney's alto vocals can do. It's not a powerhouse ballad, but her voice sounds very energetic here and very into the song."

**leviOHsa**: "Started off the song sounding like a shit Duffy tribute act. The song didn‚Äôt get better from there."

**JohnnyToby**: "SHE‚ÄôS ACTUALLY TRYINGGGGGGGGG"

**blue_charles** has a Demi Lovato flair, fyi: "I feel like Britney is yelling at me on this and it‚Äôs a bit much, The 'that was fun' at the end lowkey saves it." I thought you would like being yelled at in songs.

**estreindre** is trying their darndest to be nice: "her voice just... does NOT work for this song, but i appreciate her trying to bring energy to an otherwise really toned down album."

**Willybae00**: "She sounds great but this is clearly not where she shines the best, but she needed to include this song in the album just to say that vocally she‚Äôs more than just a one trick pony (which her fans already know)"

**SkyBlade79**: "She‚Äôs trying to be a bad dolly parton wtf". Well that's a comparison I didn't expect.

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this would be so much better without that chipmunk voice she goes into, but she at least sounds like she's having fun"

**MrSwearword**: "Her vocals have some major projection/enthusiasm but her range cannot handle such cadence like this. Also, the beat takes way too long to build to anything."

**JunkyGS**: "Meghan Trainer's best song. For real though Brit really sells this song. She sounds so into it, gives us great vocals (by Britney standards), production is good and that chorus is so fucking catchy & singable that you can't help but scream it in the car."

---

**calltehshots**: "That was fun." **jamesfog**: "That was fun!" **VodkaInsipido**: "that was fun i suppose"

**mokitsu**: "Well someone pointed out the intro to this song is similar to Beyonc√©'s Freedom so now I can't listen to it. It doesn't really go anywhere anyway!" Who the heck pointed that out? What in the world?

**enecks**: "Hey this is kinda fun and navigates more around Britney‚Äôs failings as an artist. Shame it is so repetitive"

**omgcow**: "This is fun but I skip it a lot, I love the jazzy vibe sometimes but other times not so much."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "A diet version of her I love rock and roll cover, but still good." People remember that?

**havanabrown**: "I feel like I could line dance to this"

**superr_rad**: "The instrumental is amazing"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I like the organ and horns on this, a nice change of pace on the album, and even though I don‚Äôt really like when she slips into the high pitched voice when she isn‚Äôt doing it this song is a bop." Of all the songs I would expect you to praise, this was certainly not one of them. 

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I'm sorry but I can't get into Britney doing soul"

**bliamc**: "This and Hard to Forget Ya cancel each other out because they sound so similar". Because they're both bad?

**Awhile2**: "britney stop this isnt what i want and it definitely isnt what i need". **a_rain_of_tears**: "like the beat. very shakable. totally what i need"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "holy fuck this banger!!! its everything i love about clumsy again!"

**Wailordfan**: "This is a refreshingly different sound after a couple of forgettable songs." Different != good.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "HORNS HORNS HORNS also Britney goes in that is all. Also the percussion as a whole is just ridiculous, wonderful closer."

**qetaz**: "feisty and fun, but a bit too repetitive"

**Reifiui**: "If the production didn't sound as cheap I would like this song more but it just kinda falls flat for me in the end"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn** commands us: "skip"

**SpanKKy1** is repressed sexually: "What I need is Shawn Mendes inside of me"

**eklxtreme**: "it‚Äôs sorta catchy but just really repetitive to the point where i got bored"

**veryunfinished**: "this sounds like a bad imitation of a showtune with those horns. the outro is so annoying! wow! i‚Äôm glad she had fun though."

**twat_brained**: "To me, this sounds like a big band version of A-YO. And it makes me want to pop my nonexistent pussy like nobody‚Äôs business!" Oh yeah, Lady Gaga. Is she in this rate?

I'm boring and I don't smoke weed, so this would never really click with me. Although it reminds me of those hilarious pictures of Rihanna smoking weed in Barbados and looking baked out of her mind, so that's one plus. I also think it's kind of strangely placed in the tracklist. It reminds of when on Talk That Talk they stuck the Birthday Cake interlude thing right before the really sappy and emotional song We All Want Love. It just didn't fit and while the interlude itself was fine it just felt really half-assed conceptually.

---

More like /r/potheads HAHAHAHA:

**skiddos**: "love weed but this song feels long despite being 1 minute long"

**Rourke_**: "queen of green". **enecks**: "Queen of weed". But_what_is_the_truth.gif


**calltehshots**: "Instant 10 for 'I‚Äôd rather be smoking weed whenever we breathe, every time you kiss me'"


**spacebabe27**: "This sounds like PSA music from the 80s, where Rihanna promotes marijuana use outside of a shitty arcade."

**soeri**: "ive never smoked weed in my life and even i relate to this song". 

**joshually**: "The melody leads me to believe this should be a romantical song about heart and love and joy and butterflies, but the lyrical content is about breathing weed smoke into each other's mouths and like probably fisting and other nasty things. Imagine if it was longer than a minute. Or maybe don't."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "‚ÄúYeah I smoke pot, yeah I love peace/But I don't give a fuck, I ain't no hippie‚Äù Barely a nothing of a song. I guess her voice is kinda good?" I'm tempted to link that video but I don't want to throw up. 

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I wanna get high and have sex to this tbh. But it's too short."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "Fuck, I wish I still smoked."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "A ballad about weed? A cool concept, even though the end result is definitely mediocre. loses one point for being super short, and another one for not being 4:20. smh"

**dirdbub**: "ok."

---

Random comments on interludes and how they're short and whether or not they belong in the album and stuff:

**mokitsu**: "Cute interlude, doesn't do much but fits the album perfectly"

**seferre2**: "im not a fan of skits and a boring one at best?"

**JunkyGS**: "I am still waiting & wanting this to be full track. I feel weird giving it such a high score since it is so short, but in my defense what little I hear I love."

**ProphecyPizza**: "Amazing, honestly one of my faves on the album. It would be a 10 if it was longer."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's a short interlude, but a good one. Love those synths."

**MihaMijat**: "This is way too short"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Pointless song IMO"

**Therokinrolla**: "??? but whats the point of this???"

**huntyphobic**: "Would‚Äôve been better if it was a full song."

**Yatcho**: "This doesn't count as an interlude? Okay...."

**Palutzel**: "what even is this? it sounds nice, but cheap as hell and really makes no sense in the context of the album"

**havanabrown**: "Sounds like something from Good Girl Gone Bad. Would've been nice if it was longer tho"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "This feels weird after the previous track"

**superr_rad**: "I mean, this is so short and leaves more to be desired but it sounds alright!"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Smooth interlude, not bad"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Great interlude but I wish it was longer"

**bliamc**: "Short and nice, but not a whole to here to grab onto"

**chubs4life**: "If only this was longer, it would stop wars worldwide."

**holly_foxxy**: "it's good but it just sounds... half finished?"

**estreindre**: "a nice intermission but it feels... oddly placed as the second song on the album?"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "I don't think the album needed an interlude tbh."

---

**raicicle**: "the anthem of mod and resident cabbage-man /u/eklxtreme". **eklxtreme** suspiciously says nothing about his cabbage: "pretty and romantic"

**ExtraEater**: "This is imho one of my favorite songs on ANTI, if not my favorite, even. With the instrumentals, it creates a late night, weed-infused aesthetic which greatly compliments the lyrics. It's also super chill, it's a shame Rih didn't extend it. I hope this gets far." Why am I not surprised that this is one of your favorites?

**Macubass**: "something new to the table"

**MrSwearword**: "Credit for something legitimately bold, but this shit is still more unrealized than a lot of Rihanna fans will ever admit."

**banananaise**: "Yes Rih slaughter me with your smooth beach bass"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "nice instrumental but tbh it deserved to be a full song"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I sneezed and missed half the ‚Äúsong‚Äù tbh."

**Awhile2**: "when will your fave drop a killer neo-soul track?"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I am glad this song is not longer or else I would have given this song a lower score."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Points over Consideration because it wasn't as boring. Also, it didn't last as long."

**Wailordfan**: "Can't connect to the lyrics at all, which makes it a bit difficult to get into, that and how short it is, but the instrumental in the background is really amazing and almost a bit gospel-choir-y with an organ sounding instrument near the end."

**SkyBlade79**: "It‚Äôs chill, but completely forgettable and cliche. n‚Äôt like some of the lyrics, but her voice is powerful and the emotion is palpable." n't?

**SpanKKy1**: "I'd rather be, listening to Glory". You make me question my music taste. 

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Rihanna's voice is good, the production is good. It's just too short to get anything more than an OK score."

**alternativeoxygen**: "I remember in the early days of Rihanna trolling us about ANTI that she was releasing a song on her website on 4/20. And it turned out to be this interlude. I was so upset so I'm giving this a 1."

**JohnnyToby**: "lawd yasssss"

**Willybae00**: "It‚Äôs really boring"

**twat_brained**: "I guess if the 'We Found Love' video and 'Man Down' had a kid, it would be 'James Joint'" Two great songs make an average interlude? Yikes!

It's okay. I kind of like the world-weary traveller thing she's doing here. Also her belts in the final chorus are amazing. I can't wait to see the Little Monsters desperately try to pop their bussies to this at the Joanne Ball.

---

**BionicFunhouse**: "Was a favorite immediately. I only heard one verse and I was hooked on this song."

**melisanyans**: "Downward spiral in the second half of the album continues."

**Macubass**: "keep it"

**mokitsu**: "This is so horribly boring, she didn't even try to make it sound less like filler and more like a good song!"

**Rourke_**: "forgettable"

**MrSwearword**: "The vibe gets weird on the chorus when it should be as ‚Äúdark‚Äù as the rest of the song. Even the dark vibe can‚Äôt save this ‚Äúwestern‚Äù bullshit."

**JunkyGS**: "The most country song on the album and pretty meh."

**enecks**: "A song that balances the more restrained and energetic parts of the album very nicely."

**estreindre**: "tbh this song SHOULD bore me, but something about it just CLICKS for me. i like it a lot more than i have any rational reason to."

**omgcow**: "This is mind numbing. I hate Gaga‚Äôs country voice, which has been present throughout this album, but holy fuck it‚Äôs strong here. I feel like I just got a lobotomy."

**Palutzel**: "a bit too country for my taste, but it sounds nice"

**marcryan**: "Can you imagine a Western, Cowboy Gaga video for this song?"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "We didn‚Äôt need this and million reasons"

**havanabrown**: "Kinda dull and when she sings ‚Äúprayer‚Äù it bugs me not sure why"

**spacebabe27**: "Takes the country influence into the realm of Wild West and I'm so here for it."

**superr_rad**: "generic af"

**soeri**: "trash but still better than glory"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I love the vibe of this song, the beat is really good and some of Gaga‚Äôs better vocals on the album"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "At this point I'm even more burned out by country, it's okay as a standalone but as part of the project that is Joanne, I'm too over it to appreciate it fully"

**bliamc**: "FATHER JOHN MISTY WROTE THE BEST SONG ON JOANNE FIGHT ME IT‚ÄôS LIKE A 70s WESTERN FOLK SONG AND I LOVE IT"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "queen of sinners"

**Death_Soup**: "Catchy."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I don't like country"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "i honestly forgot about this one"

**mother_rucker**: "The chorus melody low-key sounds like an early 2000s Christian worship song."

**Wailordfan**: "George Strait who? Tim McGraw who? I swear her album should be put in for review for major country awards, because this shit would dominate."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Another case of a track being overshadowed by some of the other tracks. I completely forgot about this one, but upon another listen, it's pretty good, if only unremarkable."

**angusaditus**: "definition of filler"

**Raykel**: "The bass in the beginning sounds so promising then the song takes a boring turn."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Man I wish this song would have gone to an actual country singer. It would have probably been a good song then."

**SkyBlade79**: "This is a slightly religious song that sounds VERY much like a lot of Madonna tracks; it's that kind of gospel/pop mix. The rugged production is nice, and though this track may appeal to those that grew up with gospel and country, I just can't enjoy it."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "bad"

**Therokinrolla**: "Full of rural sounding dipthongs, SP is the only song on this album I would classify as country. If the entirety of Joanne was like SP, then we would have a problem. But as a one-off country thing, it kinda works. It sounds a little misplaced in the album, but it sounds okay."

**huntyphobic**: "One time I saw a twink on Grindr with the lyrics of this song in his bio lmao"

**SpanKKy1**: "Gaga better be praying to the billboard gods for a spot in the top 80"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This probably has the best vocals on the entire album."

**leviOHsa**: "Forgettable."

**JohnnyToby**: "nothing special"

**blue_charles**: "I just.... really don't like this. Like all of it is bad"

**eklxtreme**: "i like the old country vibe, there's not much of a dynamic though"

**joshually**: "This is like C-level country folk music people. We cannot allow her to get a pass for this."

**snidelaughter**: "Eh, it's okay."

**Yatcho**: "This starts the second half of the album and its decline. Completely boring, slow songs that just feel completely inauthentic."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Judas did it better."

**twat_brained**: "Good? Yes. As gold? I wouldn‚Äôt go THAT far."

This song is so stupid but I can't help but love it. Like honestly I can't imagine anyone seriously pitching this song to Britney and her going, 'Yes, this is a good choice for my album. I can totally speak French.' Thankfully I don't actually know the language very well, so I can pretend like she's not completely embarrassing herself here. Also the bass is amazing on this. Play it in the car sometime, y'all. You'll like it a bit more.

My FRENCHPOP could mean anything:

**BionicFunhouse**: "¬øDONDE ESTA LA BIBLIOTECA? I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHY I‚ÄôM LAUGHING SO HARD RIGHT NOW I JUST AM. I DIE A LITTLE EVERY TIME SHE SAYS ‚ÄúELECTRIQUE.‚Äù"

**melisanyans**: "queen of not hiring a legit translator"

**Macubass**: "invented french, queen of foreign languages"

**mokitsu**: "The production on this track is the best of the album, after such a good but generic album this song was a blessing. I have no idea what she's saying, but I love it!"

**JoeThaMo**: "Ngl, Britney's french is pretty cute"

**MrSwearword**: "Merde. Absolument MERDE."

**Yatcho**: "I'm not really sure what this is. First off who's idea was it for Brit to do a whole song in French? I don't speak French but I'm pretty sure her accent is terrible. Second, this song doesn't get anywhere interesting until the second chorus when the mood really kicks in but they then I was bored to death. This might've worked as a short interlude but it fails as a full length bonus track."

**omgcow**: "Sexy as hell even if I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs saying. My Trilingual queen!"

**calltehshots**: "When will your fave invent a language of French gibberish and bless the world with a complete slapper? France is quivering"

**Joebiekong**: "2 mins of pure french fire"

**havanabrown**: "I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening but I like it. I later looked up this means Blackout in French so that‚Äôs cool I guess"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "even i know that pronunciation of electrique sucks and i only studied french 3 years"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "mostly because of her terrible french"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "what"

**SpanKKy1**: "What"

**mother_rucker**: "Invented the French language."

**soeri**: "/u/Kaphox's favorite song probably". I played this once in the plug and he meh'd it because her pronounciation was too terrible lmao

**Tipttt284**: "This is some of the worst French accent I ever heard and the song doesn't make up for it at all."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Literally invetned French. When will Stromae, Yelle and Christine and the Queens ever???? Smh /u/raicicle you should have added this song to your French pop rate."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Sorry Britney the French rate is next month". At least /u/raicicle is getting promo!

And speaking of **raicicle**: "oui oui baguette fromage, also please anticipate the frenchpop rate thanks"

**SkyBlade79**: "No idea why she‚Äôs singing in bad French. Just leave, please, Britney."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "This hurts me because I should love this track with its nice Blackout style production, but I can't get past the butchering of french; iconic in all the wrong ways"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "this song literally only got a lower score than 8 because it reminds me of french class and my french teacher was a total b-word"

**chihuahuazero**: "Even though I‚Äôm a proud student of learning French, I won‚Äôt throw a bone for this one."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "interesting french Britney"

**Zugtris**: "QUEEN OF ROMANIC LANGUAGES"

**Therokinrolla**: "Do te amor mi francois broken?"

**Bingcrusher**: "Hon Hon Hon Baguette Hon Hon Hon Eiffel Tower Hon Hon Hon"

**JunkyGS**: "Queen of being multi lingual. This gets a higher score then it should because I'm assuming she is speaking some shakespeare level shit"

**bliamc**: "Even when she‚Äôs singing in French, she sounds like Britney. Kind of a slow burn of a song, but still good."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "omelette du fromage realness"

**huntyphobic**: "this song is actually a paid sponsorship from duolingo #staywoke"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I‚Äôm Canadian so I know French and Coupure Electrique directly translates to not good you don‚Äôt even have to look it up you can trust me you‚Äôre welcome popheads for making you learn while having fun it‚Äôs possible guys God bless have a nice rate". [editor's note: it means "blackout". Naps is a Liar.mp3]

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "10 for the production, 2 for the lyrics and britney not being able to pronounce a single syllable correctly." She's trying her best!!!! Leave her alone!!!

**TonyRealm**: "Although her pronunciation is bad, French is a tricky language to get right, and I applaud her for singing the whole thing in an unfamiliar language. Unfortunately, the production overpowers her soft vocals and the whole track is lethargic."

**marcryan**: "Je ne comprends pas? Stick to english sweety."

**veryunfinished**: "i'm sorry but What is this accent."

**VioletChutzkee**: "Britney's pronunciation is probably abysmal, but I'm a hoe for French words no matter what."

**Willybae00**: "it‚Äôs a cute filler as a song, but it would be easily forgettable if it wasn‚Äôt in French, and if the title didn‚Äôt mean blackout"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Can't wait to give this my 11 in the French Pop rate!"

**twat_brained**: "Oublier ce que j‚Äôai dit pour ‚ÄúSex With Me‚Äù ; CETTE CHANSON EST UNE PARFAITE EXEMPLE SUR COMMENT VOUS CONCLURE VOTRE ALBUM! (yes i speak french)"

**qetaz**: "I like the style of the song, this kind of thing is my jam. But why is she speaking French? It sounds really uncomfortable"

**enecks**: "What is French for ‚Äúgood song but too late to make me like the album‚Äù?"

**superr_rad**: "Do I like this? Qui"

**estreindre**: "jesus this song is so fucking boring. i'm probably being overly harsh on it bc i like the two songs before it a lot but GOD. who thought it would be a good idea to put this song on the album. i know i'm sounding harsh but GOD, this one legitimately baffles me. did they think it being in french would magically make it better??"

**JohnnyToby**: "take a French class hunny"

**seferre2**: "ok boring but +1 because french is sexy as hell"

**blue_charles**: "This only avoids the much lower score it probably deserves because of how funny Britney's broken ass French is. That, and bass in the chorus that Did That. Fuck me up tbh."

---

**MihaMijat** triggers Automod: "Remove it chubby"

**dirdbub**: "okay, whoa. that did not go the direction I expected it to go, and it‚Äôs fucking BADASS"

**holly_foxxy**: "lmao this song is trying so hard but i'm here for it"

**eribertknows**: "Nice beat but she sounds awful."

**Palutzel**: "what a boring way to end the deluxe version"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "WHy include this as a bonus? I could just listen to one of the 6 other versions of this song you put on the album."

**spacebabe27**: "lmao." Agreed.

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Holy fuck this is a boring song on a boring album."

**Wailordfan**: "I'm sorry, but I can't love or enjoy a song if I can't understand what is being said. I don't know if that is judged, but the production on here isn't even that great either." So you can't enjoy songs in other languages? A bit extra. You can just google it if it bothers you that much.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Not even in English but dope. Upon reading a translation, the concept is actually pretty interesting, and the beat is minimal but very good. Very Cashmere Cat-esque."

**Reifiui**: "I barely noticed I was listening to this song for most of it"

**leviOHsa**: "Weak. Pointless. Bland. Delete it."

**eklxtreme**: "this instrumental started off kinda cool but it didn't get interesting"

**joshually**: "A very Baz Luhrmann meets perfume ad tune, this song smells like seduction - with top notes of fresh lotus, mouthwatering pear and magnolia. The intensive floral heart is composed of tuberose, jasmine and pink cyclamen. The sensual base is composed of musk, vanilla and precious woods. Work bitch!!!"

**-dolantello-**: "damn i love this. i wish there was more of this kind of stuff on the rest of the album". More FRENCHPOP? Oh boy, does rai have the the rate for you!

The infamous random song that critics somehow lauded when they were reviewing the album (and giving it a metacritic score about 70; did you know not every album in this rate has that?). It's not very pleasant though, and that drop in the chorus is definitely one of the most uninspiring things on Glory. It ruins an amazing streak of songs at the beginning too.

---

This section features people making fun of the title:

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I was thinking Britney had a song named Clumsy and was like huh that‚Äôs dumb to have a new song with a different name you stupid flop but then I realized that was Fergie and I felt dumb so I rated this higher to apologize to Britney"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "this song describes itself. also feels awfully straight to me". I don't think any Britney song can be described as "straight".

**havanabrown**: "so far the only clumsy thing is this album"

**Bingcrusher**: "What is this song even about..? Regardless, this would've been a much more apt name for this album."

**enecks**: "Appropriate title given this song is a mess."

**MihaMijat**: "Perfectly described itself"

**TonyRealm**: "What an apt name for this song. The verses and pre-chorus are barely tolerable, but that chorus is horrid, and the breakdown is the stuff of nightmares. Thankfully it's only 3 minutes."

**snidelaughter**: "This production is."

---

HEY GUYS DID YOU KNOW FERGIE MADE A SONG CALLED CLUMSY:

**MrSwearword**: "Fergie song title + Dangerous Woman leftover beat and half-hearted delivery."

**raicicle**: "tbh no song called clumsy actually beats fergie‚Äôs, so rip britney"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Fergie did this better."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Fergie did Clumsy better"

**Yatcho**: "I like to think that Fergie made this song for The Dutchess 10 years ago then came to her senses and cut it for a way better Clumsy."

---

Oops!

**melisanyans**: "oops!" **JamesTheGent**: "The 'OOoops' makes this" **Itsafudgingstick**: "OOPS" **superr_rad**: "That ‚Äúoops‚Äù right before the drop is the cutest thing ever don‚Äôt lie." **patronsaintofaspies**: "Oops!" 

**blue_charles**: "I don't know why y'all are haters of this song. The cute little 'oops' where you can practically hear the knowing little wink that she gives and oh my GOD that drop I live for that drop. I will crash my car bopping to that drop one of these days, it is inevitable." 

**twat_brained**: "I REALLY like the production on this song, and the little ‚Äúoops‚Äù before the beat drop is SUCH a good throwback to classic Britney! Easily top 5 on the whole album."

**chihuahuazero**: "I actually like ‚ÄúClumsy‚Äù. That Western build-up, that ‚Äúoops‚Äù, and that drop makes this track fun. It‚Äôs a shame it isn‚Äôt enough for me to keep this on rotation after a few weeks after its single release."

...

**Bannerww**: "WOOPS" (???)

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Again - I know this song is a total mess, but it gets stuck in my head every time and I love every second of it. Cluuuumsy, bangin' all oooover this bedroom"

**VodkaInsipido**: "Oh my god. This could have been an amazing song but it's just a meh. The beat is good and the beat drop is pretty good, but there's so much time wasted on it and it's bad mixed. It had a lot of potential."

**skiddos**: "Whoever did this drop fucked up badly"

**Macubass**: "left me shook"

**mokitsu**: "Another misstep! Her vocals sound especially weird in this song and the EDM drop isn't fresh."

**mgglite**: "i really like everything before the chorus and then that sucking synth kind of...ruins it"

**holly_foxxy**: "ughhh it's trying so hard to be some club banger but just...no. leave 'clumsy' to fergie."

**ProphecyPizza**: "This B O P cannot be missed!!! My pussy POPS"

**dirdbub**: "okay, now the album is starting to get interesting. the production on this is INCREDIBLE - only improvement I can think of is maybe trying to switch up the melody on the drop in one of the drops. still a banger"

**JunkyGS**: "BOP! Incredibly catchy & fun."

**estreindre**: "one of like three songs on this album that i actually like! her voice works a lot better on a country song than you'd think. still nothing spectacular though."

**omgcow**: "Ok this one is cute but I don‚Äôt love it, it‚Äôs fun but the drop is weird."

**calltehshots**: "heyyy clumsy, whooaaaa clumssy...bye."

**eribertknows**: "Just no."

**Palutzel**: "daaamn that beat thoo, i didn‚Äôt really love the song at first, but now I do, such a banger"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Again and again and again and again!"

**BlasiFeelsSwift** really hates G-Eazy: "this should have been the first single"

**soeri** really wants to eat some eggs: "ill eat an egg if this doesn't get eliminated in the first day. mark my words"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The rest of the song isn‚Äôt that bad but the drop is highkey terrible and sounds like it was randomly dropped in from a different song from 2011"

**bliamc**: "This song is headache-y, intense, fast and a lot of fun"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "sis do u need a mucinex?"

**Awhile2**: "this sounds like a femme fatale leftover"

**Death_Soup**: "pls no"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "bop city, bop bop city bitch"

**Wailordfan**: "I give it a decently high score just because of how catchy that damn production is. Holy shit I love it. And the background vocals kinda save my dislike for her vocals. HOLY SHIT THE DROP HIT ME AND FUUUUUUCK THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. I HAD AN 8 DOWN BUT THIS SHIT IS A THUMPING 10 EASY. THIS COULD BE A HUGE RADIO HIT WHAT THE HELL BRIT RELEASE THIS PIECE OF HOT HEAVENLY GOODNESS."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Wow, I didn't think I would enjoy a 2012-era drop so much, but this song truly benefits from it. The production would solely carry the song if it wasn't for Britney bringing the hype. I love the 'oops' that leads into a drop that's not too aggressive and not too obnoxious."

**qetaz**: "slightly more interesting than the preceding songs, but still not really my cup of tea"

**Reifiui**: "The production is probably the worst from any tracks in the album (except MAYBE Private Show) but Britney redeems it so hard you deserved better work from your producers"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "THE CHORUS THO"

**SkyBlade79**: "Production carried, annoying, and lame."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "oh god"

**Therokinrolla**: "Shit this song ‚Äúmake my booty work like clockwork‚Äù - Drake(probably)"

**SpanKKy1**: "Me around Shawn Mendes". That poor twink.

**leviOHsa**: "There‚Äôs like 20 versions of Britney‚Äôs voice throughout this, but this a pretty fun song."

**eklxtreme**: "sounds kinda dated and messy, i‚Äôm not a fan of the chorus"

**joshually**: "A trance anthem for klutzes everywhere like myself, this song is for all those who don't know where their center of gravity is, don't know how to control their limbs, and can't go more than 2 mph without tripping all over theyselves! Thank you for speaking for us silent minority, Queen Britney."

**veryunfinished**: "what the fuck is the bridge to this song? why did the vocals pitch up like that? is it 2003? who made these stylistic choices? the production on this is so generic too."

**Willybae00**: "Swap this song with any of the few gems that Britney Jean had"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "It‚Äôs a clusterfuck but it‚Äôs a clusterfuck I can bop to and isn‚Äôt that what we‚Äôre all here for in the end??"

This is definitely a song by Rihanna on her album Anti. It's like 8 in the morning and I don't have the energy to think of something to write about this random song so take it away, commentators!

---

**Wailordfan**: "The phrase 'camera phone' is just so irrelevant in 2016/2017. Stop using it in songs." Leave "Drop That Kitty" alone!

**VodkaInsipido**: "Why isn't this any longer, Rihanna?"

**mokitsu**: "The production reminds me of Looooooove Song, one of her best tracks! This song is pure sex."

**MrSwearword**: "Subtle sex appeal from Rihanna? If only the vocals were just amped up a touch. Not a lot, but just a touch."

**chubs4life**: "GOAT line 'I want you to homicide it.' Would make a nun shutter with pleasure." I'm shuttering.

**mgglite**: "why do all the songs on this album sound the goddamn same"

**holly_foxxy**: "lmao the first time i heard this song was in a sarah baska video and know it just makes me laugh. but uh other than that it ok"

**ProphecyPizza**: "What did she say??? T H A T"

**dirdbub**: "it took me abt 20 seconds of the song to remember what it‚Äôs like, and when I did, I didn‚Äôt like what I remembered. my memory served me right"

**JunkyGS**: "Very flirty, but sort of forgettable."

**MihaMijat**: "Forgettable"

**mother_rucker**: "I actually forgot what this sounded like immediately after listening to it."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "forgettable". I would throw shade but I don't remember what this sounds like either.

**enecks**: "An effective lowkey song"

**omgcow**: "Yeah, she said it"

**Macubass** describes his commentary: "repetitive"

**calltehshots** is floating: "I‚Äôm floating"

**Palutzel**: "yawn"

**TonyRealm**: "I‚Äôm a sucker for these chill, sensual tracks. The contrast between Rihanna‚Äôs low and high notes is ludicrously sexy. It‚Äôs a bit short but hey life is short, we got shit to do."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Bland and Dull"

**havanabrown**: "I like the techno-esque sounds but other than that most of the song is kinda boring. Not sure what else one would expect that is mostly comprised of the lyric 'Yeah I said it.' 15 times to be precise but who's counting"

**spacebabe27**: "This makes me feel like That ThotHoe‚Ñ¢."

**superr_rad**: "This is a pretty boring track."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Most underrated song on the whole album, it‚Äôs such a chill groove"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "It's a bland chill song, nothing else to say because I already forgot how it sounded."

**bliamc**: "Not what I was expecting but still a pretty great song"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "this was nice. Bad bitch Rihanna but in a soothing way"

**Awhile2**: "I would love a full album of Rihanna just doing these short interlude type tracks"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I miss Timbaland. But I don't like this song very much."

Awhile2 is about to murder **a_rain_of_tears**: "yeah, i said it: slow again. tfw you're trying not to get your scores cancelled because you hate this album so much you're dragging yourself through it"

**Death_Soup**: "Sexy."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Queen of sex jams tbh."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "I love the chill songs on this album."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's kinda a non-memorable track after a whole bunch of memorable tracks. I do like the chill background instrumental of the song, however, so it gets some points for that."

**qetaz**: "I am really liking the slow jam!!"

**joshually**: "Why she so proud to proclaim 'Yeah I said it!'? In the context of all the extremism found within ANTI amongst all the other songs, the things she's stating in this song sound so tame in comparison. She's all 'let's make love boyeeee' and like 'have sex with me plz'.... but just ten minutes ago she was talking about jamming a lit doobie up her V and punching a guy in the Adam's apple for a laugh, so in the scheme of things, this song is so commonplace."

**veryunfinished**: "i‚Äôm in the habit of forwarding this immediately, since it‚Äôs right after needed me but isn‚Äôt needed me. this could‚Äôve been an instrumental tbh." You want *more* useless interludes?

**twat_brained**: "This is probably a great song just to lay in bed with someone at night and smoke. (whole pack like Marlboros) There's too little lyrical content for me to give it artistic value, though."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Wish it was longer, with a more bold production. It's more of an interlude than a song, really."

**SkyBlade79**: "I enjoy the production on this one and her toned back vocals are really nice."

**Therokinrolla**: "its not good‚Ñ¢ - Stanthony theMantano"

**huntyphobic**: "Thank god this song is only 2 minutes long, I didn‚Äôt need any more of my time wasted on this boring ass song lmao."

**SpanKKy1**: "This is garbage, yeah I said it"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Really underrated song. Rihanna sounds very sexy here."

**JohnnyToby**: "too short"

**blue_charles**: "The aggressive, almost overbearing beats of the past few songs are absent here, which is a break I didn't even realize I needed. It never really seems to get going though, and stays pretty downtempo and slow throughout, something that doesn't entirely work."

**eklxtreme**: "nice smooth vibes"

I didn't know this song was that disliked! I always thought it was compelling in its crypticness, like who is this woman who looks like Britney and what exactly are they doing? It's sort of like Glory's take on Perfume, just with a weird acoustic guitar instead of Sia.

---

**mokitsu**: "Verses are good, pre-chorus+chorus is unlistenable!!"

**MrSwearword**: "Someone went to the Meghan Trainor school of ‚ÄúWrite & record under 3:00‚Äù"

**Bingcrusher**: "This song, just like the rest of the album, is so generic and uninspired its painful."

**holly_foxxy**: "its not Awful but it's So Cheesy and tbh i'm not convinced this wasn't made in 2004"

**ProphecyPizza**: "Britney, how are you gonna take us from a licking-milk-off-tables bop to this TRASH????? eliminate it obese"

**dirdbub**: "this song isn't as good as the others. not to mention that I reaaaally thought it was going to be a good guitar ballad :("

**JunkyGS**: "this song sounds a bit like a balloon deflating and is lazily simple. Definitely a filler track one of the deluxe songs / mood ring could have replaced."

**VioletChutzkee**: "'She looks...just like me!' lmaooo the gag of the century". IT'S A GOOD LINE OKAY BRITNEY'S DOING HER BEST TO BE MELODRAMATIC LEAV HER ALONE!!!

**joshually**: "When the vocals first kick in, you wouldn't even know it was Britney by the power and uniqueness behind it, proving that Brit can blow if she wanted. This song is full of tension in a compelling story arc, so much drama."

**Yatcho**: "Production is kind of all over the place with the guitar into the excellent build up in the prechorus and then loses it all again in that weird hook which honestly I can't tell who 'she' is. Wtf is this song about tbh"

**MihaMijat**: "The chorus is anticlimatic but the rest is pretty good"

**enecks**: "The title is appropriate given this song is just like a million better songs"

**omgcow**: "This song is like a much improved sequel to Perfume to me, I love that it tells a story and I love the production with the guitar, it seems more stripped down than some of the other songs on the album. I loooooooooove the prechorus too."

**calltehshots**: "Joanne Jean". Can you imagine Britney doing a country album? I can and it's terrifying. Basically I'd agree with **LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Britney leave the disappointing country pop to Gaga"

**eribertknows**: "This sounds like a song Ed Sheeran threw in the trash, and then Britney picked it up and made it more upbeat and even more trash, and then decided to put it in the album."

**Palutzel**: "brit delivers vocals and the song is nice, the guitar riffs are amazing"

**TonyRealm**: "Why would you have ‚ÄúJust Luv Me‚Äù and ‚ÄúJust Like Me‚Äù on the same album, come on Britney. It‚Äôs more upbeat than ‚ÄúLuv‚Äù but just as dull, with a lousy bridge and (importantly) a distinct lack of moaning."

**banananaise**: "Is it just me or does Britney sound like she has a blocked nose here". That's her natural voice.

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "zzzz"

**Macubass**: "keep it"

**eklxtreme**: "catchy instrumental but that‚Äôs all i can say about it"

**havanabrown**: "I kept hoping it would like pick up somewhere and just give...something..but it never happened"

**superr_rad**: "Okay even if this is ‚Äúfiller‚Äù it‚Äôs really great filler."

**soeri**: "i heard this song 5 minutes ago and i don't remember it that should tell you enough"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The acoustic and electronic sections don‚Äôt fit together perfect but it‚Äôs an ok song"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Britney's take on Madonna's She's Not Me"

**bliamc**: "Boring"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "the guitar intro doesn't suit her and the chorus is kinda repetitive and what is this song even about"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Sounds like A weird mashup of a The Fame Momster reject and a Random trap song."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "the first real mistep in a while"

**Wailordfan**: "It is a different sound. The super wide range of sounds make the album what it is, the big thing is that anyone could sing these and make them successful for the thing. That aside, this is actually a really nice song."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Idk, I'm just not the biggest fan of the delivery of anything but the verses on this song. The beat is nice, but the whole song just feels a little disjointed. The guitar is a welcome addition."

**veryunfinished**: "nice but forgettable. the guitar in the bridge is nice." I really like the guitar too! I think it fits the song!

**Willybae00**: "The intro sets high expectations for the rest of the song. The only issue I have is that it gets a little too repetitive which can be a good thing on some songs."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "I thought it was Just Luv Me??? Make up your fucking mind, Britney."

**twat_brained**: "Britney should do more minimal non-ballad stuff. This is wonderful!"

In your fantasy / Dream about **qetaz**: "I like this too. It injects a bit of emotion into the album"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Why process the vocals so much? It kinda loses all of the lyrical weight and becomes this bland dance song."

**SkyBlade79**: "the ones that drive you clazy". You drive me clazy / I just can't sleep.

**chihuahuazero**: "Is the idea of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre having sex with a girl that looks like me‚Äù cliche? Probably, but it‚Äôs still interesting enough to put this song above average."

**Therokinrolla**: "I don‚Äôt have much to say other than this is my favorite standard edition track. Its one of the few tracks that grabbed me with a genuinely emotional chorus, and Britney Bitch‚Äôs signature vocals really compliment the track."

**leviOHsa**: "I‚Äôm being generous, but compared to some of the other songs on this album, this is good. Sounds somewhat Kylie-esque." Noah fence but wut

**JohnnyToby**: "boring but at least it was short and btw most white moms look like you"

**blue_charles**: "Beyonce wishes her song about cheating was this GOAT. Honestly, Britney's lyrics here do a great job painting a picture of the scene, and for once she changes up her vocals to really add to that scandalized tone of the song.

This track is really cute, and Gaga apparently wrote it herself, so that's neat. Serving kazoo realness as well. I'm glad this isn't the first track from Joanne to leave, even if it's a bit obnoxiously sing-songy at some parts. Also that Brian Newman shoutout makes me laugh. It's just so random, like why would you leave that in, Gaga?

---

**melisanyans** also digs the squelching kazoo: "Probably under-rated. However, I think it's really cute! I love the kazoo realness. It's a truly soothing song, and makes me simply very happy. Should replace Come to Mama on the standard edition."

**Macubass** doesn't seem to: "my ears bleed"

And **SkyBlade79** just can't tell what's going on: "It's certainly not bad at all! I appreciate the big city vibes I get from this song, and the kazoo-trumpet combo is actually really nice addition to the song. I also like how she shows off her voice more than the other songs on Joanne. (is that a kazoo???)"

**gannade**: "when artists put their best bops as deluxe tracks :|" Yes, I love Britney too.

**mokitsu**: "This is a soccer grandmother song, are Little Monsters still pretending to like this album? :(" Ruthless.

**Rourke_**: "YES GAGA"

**MrSwearword**: "This is just so fun. Even though it clocks under 3 minutes, it‚Äôs just so much fun."

**holly_foxxy**: "this is some old school gaga and it is a Certified Bop"

**JunkyGS**: "The production is really weak on this song and ruins it."

**enecks**: "The synth does not work at all for me, and what happens after it is just one of the album‚Äôs more bland songs."

**estreindre**: "lady gaga's voice on this is noooot good imho, but i dig the instrumentation so it balances out. kind of a disappointing end to the album though."

**omgcow**: "Good god, so sing-songy. This feels very Playhouse Disney and not in a good way."

**calltehshots**: "This made me so happy wat is this"

**Palutzel**: "gaga goes back to her roots with this and it's pretty good"

**TonyRealm**: "Wholeheartedly uninspiring."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "This sounds like a broadway showtune in all the worst ways. Good thing I like broadway or this would be truly insufferable."

**havanabrown**: "I feel if different lyrics were used this could be used in a kids‚Äô show"

**spacebabe27**: "Kinda corny but really cute and well made. I love the synth line and the little 'Come on Mark' right before it. You can tell she had herself a good time making this track."

**superr_rad**: "This makes me happy, I like it. A really good ending to a really decent album"

**soeri**: "YALL ARE SO HATEFUL TOWARDS THIS SONG WHY DO YOU HATE HAVING FUN!!!"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I hope we get more of glam rock Gaga because I really like this"

**bliamc**: "I like it, it‚Äôs very throwback. It‚Äôs nice to hear a little positivity once in a while."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is probably one of the happiest songs Gaga ever wrote. I am just so happy whenever I hear this."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Okay once more I said I didn't like slow country but this is so melodic it's perfection"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A shitty album closer thanks Gaga."

**Wailordfan**: "Gaga wrote the song herself completely, and I always appreciate that about an artist."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I kinda wish this was on the album too. It would add another layer of variety to the country style on the album, and I really like that guitar (?) solo near the end."

**femaleghostbuster**: "Gaga goes dadrock"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Just Another Song."

**chihuahuazero**: "And this is another track."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Has a nice groove, I can bop to this, I feel heavy Paul McCartney influence and I like that"

**Therokinrolla**: "As a throwback, it is pretty good. But otherwise its kinda meh"

**huntyphobic**: "Gaga shouting out the other peoples names during the song is a bit cringe, but it‚Äôs still a bop."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This song is so...bland. Not what I was expecting from Gaga."

---

Who the fuck are The Beatles?

**veryunfinished**: "lmao beatles influence. it's not offensive. the band callouts are cute."

**SpanKKy1**: "The Beatles impact"

**raicicle**: "This is basically just Lady Gaga trying out a Beatles song."

**ImADudeDuh**: "What the fuck is this rejected spongebob song doing here?" I threw this in here to be shady but now that I look back it's not that funny but I'm too lazy to move it out so here you go. 

**leviOHsa**: "Just Another Song. The Beatles did it better. Bye."

---

**JohnnyToby**: "just another flop ÔÅå" Idk what that character is. Maybe the poop emojiÔÅå

**seferre2** is in the backseat of your rover: "i think it's a nice closer and a song with a good mood but it sounds like it should be in the muppets"

**ExtraEater**: "If this song was a TV show it would be a slice of life show, except it's just a really boring one that does absolutely nothing unique. This song feels like a discount version of Summerboy tbh"

**blue_charles**: "Decent closer. The multiple solos are cute, but don't do much for me."

**eklxtreme**: "so bright and feel-good, love the melody and the instrumentation"

**joshually**: "I'm sorry, I'm trying really hard to give this album a chance, but it's just not for me. It's like she's trying so hard to be hokey and downhome, but it's not coming across as genuine, effective or ... great."

**snidelaughter**: "That brassy ending tho."

**Yatcho**: "Cute little jingle, inoffensive but not memorable in any way"

**twat_brained**: "This shouldn‚Äôt have made the final cut."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "w". Insightful comment. Thank you for sending it in.

This was one of my favorites when the album came out. I love Father John Misty, even if he's kinda weird, and I think his songwriting really meshes well with Gaga and her particular style. The whole song feels welcoming and comforting, as well as quintessentially Gaga in nature. I know she ruined this for some of y'all when she performed this at a Hillary rally a couple days before America elected Trump, but I avoided watching that performance, so it's still fine to me!

---

**MrSwearword**: "Proof the ‚ÄúMother Monster‚Äù persona was still in this creatively neutered album." Yeah, this is the main reason why I like the song. I don't get why it's so low!

**mokitsu**: "I like the horns..."

**joshually** shades half the sub: "Imagine being a little monster listening to this song and reading the lyrics for the first time and you just know in your stanning little heart that Mother Monster is singing this song directly to you. She wants to nestle you in her milky white tattooed bosom and run her lacquered fingers through you hair. And you close your eyes and dream of the stark possibility of that scenario. You want to believe. So you buy 80 copies of Joanne, and set up bots on your, your parents, and your little sisters computers to stream Joanne 24/7 to help inflate her album numbers, hoping against hope that she'd notice and acknowledge and figure out it was you and then finally, maybe, you can have your dream fulfilled and come to mama."

**Therokinrolla** is a HYPOCRITE: "In the last fourth of the album, Gaga gets quasi-political, which is interesting and I love it. This isn‚Äôt really political per se, but mostly her singing about how we should stop being sluts to each other and be lovely sluts to each other an love each other. Its such a wholesome and comforting song, if a little condescending at times. I love the flow and instrumental of this track. This was definitely the track that took the longest to get into, but its a lovely anthem about being nice and it warms my insides :)" Okay but you say this and then SHADE BRITNEY ALL THE TIME

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "The chorus sounds perfect for a Huggies diaper ad." I hate this

**mgglite**: "sounds like something you'd hear as the ending credits to a christmas movie, but only after the first, better song has already finished and they're just doing the black screen with names in white text"

**JamesTheGent**: "Iconic anthem by Mama Monster"

**JunkyGS**: "I feel a weird guilty pleasure when listening to this song. It is so stupidly cheesy / corny, but makes me smile when I listen to it. I just imagine a giant gaga opening her arms with humanity running into them when she sings the chorus. For whatever reason it works for me."

**enecks**: "Title is appropriate given that this song kind of feels like mom music. Gets better tho"

**estreindre**: "i'm not huge on this song's first verse, but once it hits that chorus this song gets MUUUUCH better. i love how well the intrumentals and lady gaga's vocals work together in this song."

**Macubass**: "so comforting"

**omgcow**: "This is fun, feels super retro. I read a youtube comment that said this sounded like Rihanna‚Äôs ‚ÄúStay‚Äù and now I can‚Äôt unhear the similarity"

**eribertknows**: "If you look up 'skippable' in the dictionary, you get an MP3 file for this song."

**Palutzel**: "not one of my favs from the album, but it sounds pretty good and it has some great lyrics and it's gaga after all little monster spotted"

**TonyRealm**: "The buildups to each chorus are really well done, and the outro is just an awe-inspiring explosion of sound."

**havanabrown**: "Such an infectious beat, I feel like this is one of the more timeless sounding songs on the album"

**spacebabe27**: "I love this, but the main thing keeping it from sounding like some Beatles-esque, social awareness song is the filtered guitar that Bloodpop so gracefully uses throughout this album."

**superr_rad**: "This could be so good but it's just uninteresting and bland??"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This sounds like a Christmas song but I like it". I remember the NYT said something similar and it made me pressed.

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Okay I was getting serious Beatles vibes from this song and there are times where I'm home alone and just find myself full on belting the chorus"

**bliamc**: "Lyrically boring, melodically bland"

**Awhile2**: "this is fine but id much rather be listening to an actual Bowie song instead of this off brand nonsense"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I apologize for sounding cheesy and nerdy but re-listening to this song for the rate, the song just reminds me so much of Carrie Fisher. She sounds like a grandmother you like to visit every weekend and have tea with because she knows she has a lot of tea to spill and she'll welcome you with open arms. May the force be with you Princess Leia."

**a_rain_of_tears** continues to anger Awhile2: "slow but not in the anti way, but a lovely message"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Is this album over yet?"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "would be better in a disney film"

**mother_rucker**: "‚ÄúTell me who hurt ya‚Äù The Artpop era is what hurt me, though"

**qetaz**: "I'm just a sucker for this big, brassy sort of sound"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "I don't get why it is in the album. Makes no sense lyrically with the rest, but it's a cute song nonetheless."

**SkyBlade79**: "This is kind of bizarre, but child's play compared to some of the songs that Gaga has created in the past. It promotes peace and love to each other, set over a jazz instrumental that just seems out of place. Though this song may be average at best, it's simply too preachy and boring to drive me to listen to it more than once." 

**chihuahuazero**: "How is this live? This sounds like a song Gaga made to do live."

**Wailordfan**: "Cried to this song election night when she posted vids of it. Not because Clinton lost, but because of how this really should be a much more heard song, especially now." I would have cried to both of those things happening.

**twat_brained** listens to Joanne a lot: "I had a low score planned, but listening to it for maybe the 10th time, I realized that it‚Äôs actually pretty catchy + cute :)"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Definitely a bop. Loving the vibe, and all I gotta say is 'come to mama'."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "okay no I don‚Äôt like Gaga anymore"

**Zugtris**: "sometimes i put this song on just the hear the goat delivery at the start and then press next lol"

**huntyphobic**: "Nice song but if Gaga makes this her next single I‚Äôm unstanning". Sis I don't think she's that delusional. 

**SpanKKy1** had this song on his top 100 Spotify tracks last year: "Yaaaaaaaaaaas Gaga invented being a mother"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I wonder if this is a throwback to the political songs you found on pop albums in the 80s and the early 90s, like Madonna's 'Love Makes The World Go Round' or Mariah Carey's 'There's Got To Be A Way'."

**JohnnyToby**: "ok actually the only thing that killed it was the mild cheesiness in a verse but wow unexpected"

**seferre2**: "it's a very fun song with awesome production but nothing spectacular is going on"

**blue_charles**: "Could be worse, but damn is it cheesy in all the wrong ways."

**VioletChutzkee**: "embarrassing tbh"

**eklxtreme**: "i love the 80s type glam rock melody, bruce springsteen vibes"

**snidelaughter** is excited for Commas' indie rate: "I fucking love Father John Misty."

**veryunfinished**: "i didn't care for the spoken bits but the backing vocals were cute."

The chorus really aggravates me, and nothing else really manages to redeem that. I don't see how y'all can say Private Show is so annoying and then give this better scores tbh.

**dirdbub**: "this song is extremely forgettable, which is very ironic"

**VodkaInsipido**: "OKAY BRITNEY STOP THE TIGHT BEAT DROP"

**melisanyans**: "'there's just something aboutcha!' is how she should have delivered Do You Wanna Come Over." And ruin the song?

**Macubass**: "love this"

**mokitsu**: "This is a fun song that sometimes gets a skip and sometimes doesn't!"

**MrSwearword**: "I kept getting vibe-clash. Is it supposed to be workout music, dance music, sex music, or is it a really muddled version of all those things? Singing & beat wise, it‚Äôs decent."

**JunkyGS**: "a lil basic but is redeemed by being a bop with good production."

**MihaMijat**: "The YA on the chorus is annoying af"

**Joebiekong**: "Hate the chorus"

**eribertknows**: "'We're stuck here forever'. That's how I felt listening to this album."

**Palutzel**: "'it's great, but it's too generic' this song and this album, but really this song is lit"

**Awhile2**: "some part of this song remind me of grimes for some reason but thats probably just me"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "the chorus was kinda meh but the flow in the verses saves it"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I swear she stole the melody from the prechorus from a Phineas and Ferb Song". I'm cackling, what kind of comparison?

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Beautiful pre-chorus, really reminds me of old Britney. This one has another drop, but I don't like it as much. I don't think the song really benefits from the aggressive drop it has, because everything else is so sugary."

**qetaz**: "not feeling it"

**Reifiui**: "This is like an inverted Do You Wanna Come Over?, the chorus saves this (somewhat)"

**Raykel**: "The pre-chorus is the definition of sensational."

**SkyBlade79**: "It tries so hard to be good, but it‚Äôs ultimately so boring and production carried, and Britney‚Äôs voice just seems even more wrong than normal."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "meh"

**Zugtris**: "GOd what a buildup from the second it started, but idk it kinda fell apart when the chorus came?? i'm loving the verses tho, get someone to remix this thing"

**Therokinrolla**: "Repetitive repetition of the title is repetitive"

**leviOHsa**: "I felt like I was listening to a Hilary Duff song without the nostalgia."

**JohnnyToby**: "more disappointed most of these songs have this same feeling idk how to explain it"

**blue_charles**: "The verses are real let down considering how high energy the chorus is."

**eklxtreme**: "catchy and nice production"

**joshually**: "Ok this song is seriously Build-Up perfection and I hate that this deserves to be higher than it'll probably end up and that makes me sad."

**veryunfinished**: "that chorus sounds wrong. wrong and annoying."

**ImADudeDuh**: "The background percussion sounds like someone shaking a box, and I couldn't get it out of my head the whole song"

Another really cute track. It does what a lot of Gaga tracks fail to do, which is give a look into her personal life and reveal a lot about the singer imo. Even if the details and imagery seem a bit pointless, I think it's fun to imagine Gaga drinking wine with her friends and pretending to be the Spice Girls or whatever. Could do with more interesting production, though.

---

**Macubass**: "mediocre"

**mokitsu**: "By the time we enter the bonus tracks my head already hurts from Gaga's fake southern accent but I like the production on this one!"

**Rourke_**: "kind of cute I guess"

**MrSwearword**: "I know this has a way deeper meaning, but this made me think ‚ÄúIf Kacey Musgraves ever went pop/country, this is what she‚Äôd sound like.‚Äù"

**ProphecyPizza**: "Wig destroyed, sewn back together, and dyed red"

**dirdbub**: "this is so good"

**JunkyGS**: "Story behind this song definitely influenced my vote and made me understand / appreciate the song more."

**MihaMijat**: "I called this song gringo girls"

**enecks**: "Another effective song, but a bit unremarkable."

**estreindre**: "the most country the album gets and the closet country fan LOVES that. however, 'this texas girl real strong / taught me this strong song' is legit one of the worst lyrics of 2016, sooooo."

**omgcow**: "This was cute, the chorus feels kinda Lana to me but idk why really"

**calltehshots**: "That Spice Girls reference omg"

**eribertknows**: "Meh"

**Palutzel**: "such a sweet and beautiful song"

**TonyRealm**: "Better than the other bonus track but it‚Äôs boring and the sparse production sounds empty and unfinished."

**marcryan**: "I can support anything that includes drinking and watching the Bachelorette."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Watch the Batchelor monday nights on ABC"

**havanabrown**: "I hated this song when I first listened to Joanne for some reason. It‚Äôs slowly growing on me but it‚Äôs still not anything special to me"

**spacebabe27**: "This is such a fun song for a really emotionally taxing album and I love it."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I know people gave this track a lot of praise when the album was released but idk, I wasn't really feeling it, I'm not sure if I'm missing something or what"

**bliamc**: "The lyrics are pretty bad here"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "A BOP! an uplifting bop! her mentioning her friend Sonja tugs at my heartstrings tbh"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Almost my 11 but also that‚Äôs basically throwing it away and I‚Äôve had enough of that since this sub has trash taste"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is so sweet of Gaga to dedicate this song to her friend who has cancer. This is probably one of the best songs on the album. Also, 'Spice Girls in this bitch' is an iconic line."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "I know I said I didn't like slow country songs but I'm bald for some reason"

**triptoyourheart**: "Wondering why this was a bonus track while some really middling songs made the standard album."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "STOP WITH THE COUNTRY"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "i cheer for this every time"

**mother_rucker**: "The story behind this is sweet and personal. Why did she have to turn it into the most boring-sounding song possible?"

**Wailordfan**: "The song is ok, but something about it is just not enjoyable for multiple listens. The ending is also a bit grating with the laughing/talking 5-7 second clip."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Hot damn, I wish this were on the album. It's my favorite track off of the deluxe, because the beat is insane, and the lyrics are monumental. 'Spice girl in this bitch' is the best line on the album by a wide margin."

**qetaz**: "I like the story of the friendship, but the production is a bit uninteresting"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "This album ends on a sour note. Not lyrically, the album is quite hopeful, but the album gets worse and worse in quality as the end gets closer."

**SkyBlade79**: "I really do get how important this song is about her and her friend with cancer, but I‚Äôm not a big fan. Also, ‚Äútexas girl real strong/ taught me this strong song‚Äù is really horrible."

**chihuahuazero**: "Another girl-power jam, and it‚Äôs a cute one."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "boring"

**Therokinrolla**: "This song deserves to be on the standard edition. Yet another incredible emotional track from Godga, the chorus really picks up after the slower verses. This guitar in this song is also excellently done. What a track."

**huntyphobic**: "this song is unbearably white"

**SpanKKy1**: "California Girls > Grigio Girls"

**leviOHsa**: "This is such a soccer mom anthem, and I kinda live for it. YOLO."

**JohnnyToby**: "adds nothing to the album"

**seferre2**: "this one was debatable for my zero but god her voice is screechy and unstable the lyrics are dumb as hell it should've never been put on this album"

**blue_charles**: "purely for the line '5th spice girl up in this bitch' The whole song has this vibe of happiness in the face of a world that isn't always that happy"

**VioletChutzkee**: "A little forgettable, but very sweet. I would've liked to have seen more personal stories like this one on this album instead of Gaga trying to get political and giving me major secondhand embarrassment in the process."

**eklxtreme**: "love the melody and the bittersweet lyrics"

**joshually**: "The chorus is pretty and melodic, but the verses leave so much to be desired, akin to Japanese porn with its inconsiderate pixelation of the genitals."

**snidelaughter**: "Beginning of the deluxe. It's okay."

**Yatcho**: "Who snuck a Rachel Platten song onto this album rate?"

**twat_brained**: "THIS is what the album needs! Gaga just having fun being herself while also keeping in tune with the album‚Äôs sound!"

**[All scores](http://pastebin.com/RaXT2AmP)**

Sounds ethereal, sure, but I can't tell if this wants to be a full-fledged song or just a cute intro. The song length would suggest the former, but the way it actually plays out, with that weird chorus thing that keeps looping and the mystical ambience it builds that never fully delivers anything, kind of implies that it's just an introduction. It doesn't do either job that well to justify this weird mix, imo.

---

**spacebabe27** has the best comment: "If this was an actual invitation I would say maybe just to leave my options open but then throw hints that I'm not coming. Then the day of whatever event I would send a text like 5 minutes before it starts that says 'Hey girlie, sorry but I don't think I can make it. Got a lot going on, but give everyone my best!! :-)'." Sounds like me avoiding my friends to do this rate on a Friday night.

**BionicFunhouse**: "Is this Britney Spears? People like this?"

**skiddos**: "The vocal producers for this one should be fired"

**Macubass**: "that bridge kills me"

**mokitsu**: "Would be much more enjoyable without Alvin and The Chipmunks in the chorus! Who lied and told poor Knee it was good? The production on this track is amazing tho. Fits 50SOG better than that Zayn song!"

**MrSwearword**: "Even by processed Britney studio standards, the vocals are almost a waste. The beat barely saves it from a lower score."

**mgglite**: "filler? right at the start? ok"

**holly_foxxy**: "the chorus is so weird in a bad way?? which is too bad because the rest of the song is great"

**dirdbub**: "well this seems more like an invitation to a boring album then an invitation to a good one"

**JunkyGS**: "I like the mood & atmosphere of the song but it is so damn skippable and should have just been an interlude or something."

**MihaMijat**: "A decent opening"

**enecks**: "The vocals drag this hardcore. I find them hard to listen. Shame, as everything else is solid"

**estreindre**: "sets a really good tone for the album, in that it's fucking boring."

**omgcow**: "This is such a great album opener. So sexy and smooth. This song alone is better than anything on Britney Jean."

**calltehshots**: "I'm astral projecting into space and seeing God!!!"

**eribertknows**: "The beat is nice but that hook is forgettable as fuck."

**Palutzel**: "it's ok, but it made me sleepy and britney doesn‚Äôt even sound like britney"

**TonyRealm**: "As an album opener, it sets the tone well, but it‚Äôs not a song I come back to."

**havanabrown**: "The airy feeling made me wanna fly"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "yasss queen"

**superr_rad**: "I love how dreamy this sounds, I like to listen to it when I‚Äôm smoking relaxing"

**soeri**: "it got lost in the mail sorry britney"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I liked how the song started but her vocals as it go on sound really overdone, the song‚Äôs not bad but that bugged me"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I'll be straight up and say Glory is my least favourite of the 4 albums here, however, Invitation is a nice pleasant opening and is one of the best tracks on the album"

**bliamc**: "I listened to this once when I listened through the whole album and then never again"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "i love revival too brit"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "mess"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "A good opener with an interesting production."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "weak, but better than most of anti"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "Her voice on the chorus is what doesn't make this a 9"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I love slow jams TBH"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "boring"

**Wailordfan**: "The first verse is really good. This is the first Britney album I'm listening to, and the chorus just ruined it. Too all over the place."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's a very chill, spacey song. Reminds me a little of chillwave, and I like it a lot for that. It is a bit repetitive, unfortunately."

**qetaz**: "It's fine, but really nothing special"

**Reifiui**: "Those vocal effects sound REALLY bad, not a good start for the album"

**angusaditus**: "This song perfectly sets the scene for what's to come, such a great opener"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Britney should really experiment more."

**SkyBlade79**: "Her voice is so weird, the production is bizzare, and the lyrics are cheesy. The chorus is a complete mess."

**chihuahuazero**: "On second thought, I think I was too harsh on the self-titled track for Selena Gomez‚Äôs ‚ÄúRevival‚Äù."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "This is my first listen to of Glory, and wow this isn‚Äôt what I was expecting. In that I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be not horrible."

**Zugtris**: "okay so i was considering just skimming through these songs quickly instead of having to endure a britney album, but i'm on the first song and what the fuck this is actually good lMAO. guess i'll listen to the entire thing after all"

**Therokinrolla**: "I hated this song at first but the way she sings this track is so delicate and beautiful."

**huntyphobic**: "that chorus is so bad lmao yikes"

**SpanKKy1**: "Keep that invitation beth"

**leviOHsa**: "I didn‚Äôt enjoy this, but I‚Äôm not scoring lower because I think if production had been better this could have been cool. I appreciate what they were aiming for."

**JohnnyToby**: "cute"

**blue_charles**: "While not exactly remarkable in any way, this is still a strong opener for the album and firmly establishes the tone that Britney's shooting for on this album."

**eklxtreme**: "tfti britney, i like the layered vocals and the moody feel to the song, off to a good start"

**joshually**: "You think this song is about sex, but I propose to you that this is an invitation into her private life, one she's had to closely guard in the last several years for her own life's sake. She's older, stronger and she's ready to slowly start letting us in. When she's talking about 'put your love all over me' she's not speaking sexaphorically, but she really means it. I'm open now, for love, for your love. 10"

**snidelaughter**: "This is boring."

**-dolantello-**: "Britney really does not sound good on that hook with the effects and stuff, but the production is nice"

**Willybae00**: "This is the type of song I would play first when having a hook up over, plus it works great as an intro song. Kudos for including lyrics about consent"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "sorry Britney I'm gonna have to decline"

**twat_brained**: "This is all the invitation I need to get swept up in this masterpiece of an album üòç"

LA-LA-LA-LOVE ME DOWN! That section is divine, if a bit basic, but the rest of the song is pretty forgettable. I always enjoy it whenever I listen to it, but I can never remember it afterwards.

---

**BionicFunhouse**: "A lot of the songs on this album are just mediocre"

**VodkaInsipido**: "This beat drop thing is getting out of hand. Still, really enjoyable."

**skiddos**: "I wanna slut drop to this"

**Macubass**: "invented pop"

**mokitsu**: "This is how you do a drop! Love the sass in the verses."

**MrSwearword**: "This post chorus of ‚ÄúLa la la‚Äù has me thinking this is merely ‚Äúless shitty LA Love La La‚Äù by Fergie."

**holly_foxxy**: "why wasn't this a single???"

**dirdbub**: "wow, that trap beat is not good at all. especially that drop. doesn't really seem like the chops were meant to work as well. this song is a certified mess, man"

**JunkyGS**: "sort of Bops but the chorus is really bad & track is filler and should have been replaced with mood ring / deluxe tracks."

**enecks**: "Terrible start, but it gets better and then so much worse aaa."

**omgcow**: "I want this for the 3rd single tbh it‚Äôs so good"

**calltehshots**'s ass is quaking: "My ass is quaking."

**Palutzel**: "nice beat, but very generic, sounds like 100 other songs"

**TonyRealm**: "Now this is the kind of Britney banger I want to hear! Super catchy, exciting production, and a fun drop, that‚Äôs all you really need in a bop like this."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Has a bit more energy. Don‚Äôt like the lalalala love me."

**havanabrown**: "the chorus had that oomph and it felt so right"

**spacebabe27**: "The beat drop in this actually isn't awful so I can give this song props for that. Also the verses are really good and get my ass moving."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "A nice album cut banger, not necessarily single material but good replay value"

**bliamc**: "this song is sOO GREAT. I LOVE LUH LUH LUH LOVE ME DOWN DOWN"

**Awhile2**: "best song on the album. The drop on here is one of my favorite moments in music this year, especially the last one with the higher vocals layered on, like it honestly gives me shivers"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "intro was weak and again a fairly repetitive chorus, but otherwise catchy"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "G E N E R I C"

**Wailordfan**: "It isn't bad, but I already can't remember the song now going into the next one."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This should be a single, it's insanely catchy. I personally don't enjoy the post-chorus all that much, but it is nicer when the beat hits. Still a bit repetitive for me."

**qetaz**: "I'm a bit unsure what to rate this because I quite like the verses but I REALLY don't appreciate the breakdown/chorus-y bit"

**Reifiui**: "Just when I thought the rest of the album would go well... Then they put this mess in"

**femaleghostbuster**: "Embarrassing."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "A banger."

**SkyBlade79**: "totally great message: ‚Äúlets not discuss things or actually have a healthy relationship, lets just have sex‚Äù. go away britney. Your drop is trashy and your voice is crap."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "This is a very low effort attempt at every current synth/drop pop song."

**SpanKKy1**: "I want Shawn to love me down"

**leviOHsa**: "Yes. This is a bop! This is Britney bitch!"

**JohnnyToby**: "she sounds like she‚Äôs not even trying in the chorus >:("

**joshually**: "Trop Pop verses into Drop Pop into Raggae Lite, this song is all about the sounds dominating 2016."

**snidelaughter**: "WHY DOES NOBODY TALK ABOUT THIS SONG IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD"

**veryunfinished**: "i like the beat i guess; it‚Äôs generic but it works. this sounds so familiar though."

**Willybae00**: "This is a perfect Britney type of song, it reminds me of 3, If You Seek Amy, and Radar, but it also feels current. It‚Äôd also make a great single just because it‚Äôs so club friendly. I can picture myself half drunk grinding on some random stranger while singing along to this song."

**twat_brained**: "The song isn‚Äôt that bad per se, but the sing-talk verses are just somewhat off-putting to me."

It's okay. I do like the production, which sort of echoes tropical house but not really. I don't know, there's not much to say about this one. Let's talk about Meghan's song Better instead. Especially how badly it did. Like seriously, why did that flop so badly? Her previous two singles did decently, and then that just tanked. I guess that's what happens when you try to become a Serious Artist too quickly?

**skiddos**: "Eh"

**Macubass**: "trop pop done well"

**mokitsu**: "Another well executed pop jam! Love the drop but gets repitive!"

**MrSwearword**: "‚ÄúLet's undo all the distance/From your guards down to your buttons‚Äù makes no fucking sense and is just a really bad opening lyric. Also, I can‚Äôt tell if this beat is ripping off ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù by Justin Bieber or ‚ÄúOne Dance‚Äù by Drake OR something by Kiiara."

**ProphecyPizza**: "this song is honestly such garbage like why is this here"

**dirdbub**: "why is this necessary"

**JunkyGS**: "this song is so much Better(HAHAHAHAHAH) then some of the normal album songs."

**MihaMijat**: "The drop could've been better but yeah I like this"

**enecks**: "PH 14"

**estreindre**: "i like the production on this song a lot! however, the beat drop on this song is... laughably bad"

**omgcow**: "This is SO GOOD and I love the bridge."

**calltehshots**: "I'm dancing on your man to this bop"

**Palutzel**: "LAME POP, I'M TIRED OF IT, IT‚ÄôS ALL OVER BILLBOARD HOT 100"

**TonyRealm**: "That post-chorus drop is messy and the bridge is dreadful, but the rest is pretty good."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "A tiny bit more interesting than the rest of the passable synth pillowtalk wannabes on this album. But not enough,"

**havanabrown**: "a decent beat but it fell short"

**spacebabe27**: "Bland but not awful."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Decent tropical house song, which is surprising"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "A decent deluxe track"

**bliamc**: "Bloodpop came through and gave us a laid-back banger"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "This could be better (if used please make italics thank you god bless)"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "the title is probably referring to the comparison with anti, that's the only way it'd apply"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Boring Trop Pop"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "kinda boring"

**mother_rucker**: "The instrumentals are so weird, but I love them"

**Wailordfan**: "Meh?"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Britney does trop pop, and it's good. And those drums that kick in before the chorus? Goddamn. And the chorus? Goddamn. Should've been on the album, honestly."

**Reifiui**: "What even is this drop, I can't even describe it, it's like both really hilarious but really trash I can't make up my mind"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "How many people just responded 'Worse'? I want a number."

**SkyBlade79**: "even meghan trainor‚Äôs better is superior to this, so that‚Äôs really something. I‚Äôm just tired of her relying on her producers to make her career"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "better than half these songs"

**Therokinrolla**: "Mmmhmm yea you tell yourself that britney bitch"

**huntyphobic**: "Buy ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Better‚Äô by Missy Elliott on iTunes"

**SpanKKy1**: "Nothing is better than sex with Shawn Mendes"

**raicicle**: "This is a Chainsmoker song."

**JohnnyToby**: "I don‚Äôt wanna know know know‚Ä¶."

**seferre2**: "could've used a feature"

**blue_charles**: "No bad, but could be better. (I'm sorry)"

**eklxtreme**: "I mostly like this for the production and the interesting vocal sampling"

**joshually**: "This song basically sums up her life now. She's better, better than before, better than when the world absolutely reviled in her downfall. This is a song about victory, and she deserves it."

**snidelaughter**: "If the deluxe tracks are better than the standard I'm going to cry."

**Yatcho**: "They couldn't afford Sia so we get a great TropPop song with the most boring lyrics I could imagine"

**veryunfinished**: "i don‚Äôt really like the drop on this."

**Willybae00**: "I would give this song a 10 if it weren‚Äôt for the tropical house beat thing going on. Her voice sounds great tho"

**twat_brained**: "I like the beat, and Britney‚Äôs vocals are on point as ever in this album!"

Lmao I legitimately didn't know this song was that disliked until I saw the scores come in and saw this get punched out early in the Popjustice rate. I remember falling asleep to this on a flight back home last year, and no that's not meant to be shady. It's a strangely relaxing track, but Bey also isn't afraid to show her raw, gutteral pain. Could've gone further, tbh.

---

Ah yes it's the infamous Song Doc Hates So Its Average Drops A Bunch Because He Gives Everything Else A High Score. What does **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** have to say about his 0?: "And........this is how you kill the momentum of the album. This is the biggest dud of the entire album and the only filler track in this album. It would have been fine if it was a song on earlier Beyonce's albums but considering the progress that Beyonce made with her sound over the years? I don't think so. Also, Robin Sparkles did it better."

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Oh god, the shrieking on this track... it's probably supposed to sound super emotional and shit, but it's just straight up grating... 'WhAaAaaAAAT is it ABOuT YuHOuhOUOUuOU!?!?'" **skiddos** gave it an 8: "don't tell Joe"

**Macubass** has the hottest of takes: "best track on the album"

**mokitsu**: "Queen showing her softer, vulnerable side. I love the voice crack, this song is perfect for shower singing"

**MrSwearword**: "There are some times where Bey‚Äôs vocals sound‚Ä¶throaty or dry [think like, she didn‚Äôt clear her throat before recording]. However, this is a vulnerable, introspective sounding track."

**mgglite**: "oh good another slow song"

**holly_foxxy**: "I feel like this song is going to get panned sadly but imo this song is SO good. bey just gives SUCH a raw emotional delivery ugh its so good..."

**dirdbub**: "what the fuck did Jay do holy fuck"

**JunkyGS**: "Very pretty production, heart breaking lyrics and B gives some of her best vocals."

**MihaMijat**: "Just doesn't do it for me"

**enecks**: "The most stylistically safe song of the album; yet also one of the emotionally impactful."

**calltehshots**: "Beyonce, wyd?"

**eribertknows**: "One of my favorite Beyonc√© songs ever, which doesn't really say all that much."

**Palutzel**: "great voice, but the song.. yawn"

**TonyRealm**: "It‚Äôs really difficult to craft a pure piano ballad that sounds full and complete, but this is as close as it gets. Bey sounds talented as ever, I like how there's no true chorus, and the backing vocals in the final verse are a nice flourish."

**havanabrown**: ":‚Äô("

**superr_rad**: "Really weak song for such a powerful album"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "More like snorecastles"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "One of the standouts on this album for sure"

**jamesfog**: "I was feeling it until THOSE vocals happened... tragic"

**bliamc**: "Some of the lyrics kind of suck but it‚Äôs so emotional and beautiful that I don‚Äôt really care"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Yah"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "I think she's better suited to songs like Formation"

**Death_Soup**: "Gorgeous song but way too slow and boring."

**Bannerww**: "I have a weakness for this song. So raw emotional and good!"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A VOCALIST TBH"

**mother_rucker**: "I absolutely love the emotion she puts into this song. That slight voice crack in ‚Äúwhat is it about you‚Äù kills me every time."

**Wailordfan**: "Yawn."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I didn't think a ballad would end up being one of my favorites on the album, but it is. Sandcastles is powerful stuff, both lyrically, and vocally. The pained delivery of 'Pictures snatched out the frame/Bitch, I scratched out your name and your face' makes it my favorite line on the album. It's simple, but painfully so."

**qetaz**: "the vocal, the emotion... This is pretty much perfection"

**angusaditus**: "idk why people hate this; I teared up first time I heard it and I still love it for it's vulnerability."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Robin Sparkles did it better."

**SkyBlade79**: "I don‚Äôt get why you guys drag this song so much. It‚Äôs a good ballad."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Sandcastles in the Sand"

**Zugtris**: "people bash on this song but y'all just have bad taste (watch as the britney fans will give this low scores). you can honestly feel her sincerity and emotion rip right through the song."

**Therokinrolla**: "Compared to the ballads on Joanne, isa dud. But its a powerful ballad that is a nice detour from the rest of the album"

**huntyphobic**: "I usually don‚Äôt give a fuck about ballads but Bey expresses more emotion in this song than she has in her whole life tbh."

**alternativeoxygen**: "this is a really tender ballad...I literally feel like Beyonce is ripping her heart out in this song. If only Adele's album were as good as this song."

**JohnnyToby**: "chills every time. thanks bey"

**ExtraEater**: "Rumour has it that Chris Martin collaborated with Beyonce Knowles to create a music video for Sandcastles and make it some sort of sequel for Viva La Vida. Beyonce then realized during filming that the Coldplay members were pretty annoying people. They were british, but not in a good way. buy a head full of dreams on itunes"

**blue_charles**: "I've got a soft spot for this song, I'll admit it. Really, I'm just here for how Beyonce delivers the line 'and your face / what is it about you?‚Äù"

**eklxtreme**: "very strong emotion in her vocals"

**joshually**: "This song is more basic than the lesson plan for the first week of kindergarten and her overwrought voice is beyond necessary and cringey."

**snidelaughter**: "Raw, stripped down, broken, passionate, Beyonc√©."

**Yatcho**: "Really slows down the pacing of the album, makes this whole middle section drag"

**veryunfinished**: "cheesy and lyrically kind of cliche (sandcastle metaphors aren‚Äôt exactly rare), but beyonce plays it so straight here that it‚Äôs emotionally evocative. maybe it's just really easy for beyonce to emotionally manipulate me but my heart breaks when she sings 'what is it about you that i can't erase?'"

**twat_brained**: "Beyonc√©'s raw vocals are amazing in this song but the mellow music doesn't save it from being a bit of a snoozer."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Spectrum Pulse is shook"

I gave it a middling score, and I've written shit defending it in the past, so I think what would be more interesting is reading everyone's jumbled up remarks on this song (and I'm lazy and I don't want to wade through like a billion comments lmao). So, presented without commentary, here's what /r/popheads thinks of Perfect Illusion.

---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I remember being excited for this soon to come out and everyone on popheads was so excited for the return of Gaga. As soon as the song came out, it came out to be the most divisive songs on popheads. I honestly think the wait was worth It and I can't help but get high whenever I listen to this song. I know this song will not make it to Day 3 because I am not #delusional but I am really glad I gave this song an 11. [Also, throwback to that time I wrote a piece on Perfect Illusion on /u/raicicle's Best Songs of 2016 list.](https://medium.com/@itsrai/the-top-100-tracks-of-2016-according-to-r-popheads-25-1-4706389ae520#.q366hxic5)"

**JoeThaMo**: "I don't care what anyone says, I still absolutely love this track. It's still my most scrobbled song on lastfm and never fails to get me hyped up."

**VodkaInsipido**: "It still wins a lot with the video. And the mixing change at 0:30 still ends giving me a headache. But it's fun, enjoyable, and overall Gaga can touch whatever genre she wants and makes it at least decent."

**melisanyans**: "Raw, electric, real, all over the place, not what people wanted."

**skiddos**: "The lead single being the song I want to skip the most is kinda sad"

**Macubass**: "trash"

**mokitsu**: "Okay this song sounds super unfinished and repetitive and NOT like it was produced by BloodPop and Kevin Parker (!!) but it's still a bop."

**Rourke_**: "feels both undercooked and overwrought at the same time"

**MrSwearword**: "I‚Äôve had to warm up to the song just by itself, Robin Skouteris mashup and Scream Queens premiere video notwithstanding. It took a while for this subtle shit to be forgiven just as an album cut."

**Bingcrusher**: "Whoever picked this as the lead single should be fired."

**gannade**: "what is this garbage!"

**angusaditus**: "What is this garbage!"

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "hot garbage"

**SpanKKy1**: "What is this garbage!"

**chubs4life**: "I feel so basic giving this song a 0 but I guess it really wasn't...LAAAVE."

**mgglite**: "yeah everyone likes to hate on this song but at least i can listen to it without almost falling asleep, which i can't do for half of anti and lemonade"

**JamesTheGent**: "Sure, it's repetitive, but it makes you want to shout IT WASN'T LAAAHV everytime."

**dirdbub**: "..I actually like this song. a lot. don‚Äôt drag me popheads, but this is by far one of the best songs on the album. it honestly and realistically conveys the emotion of the song PERFECTLY with it‚Äôs strained, forced atmosphere. one of the reasons why I love the song so much"

**JunkyGS**: "This song was surprisingly my 3rd most listened to of the year. I live for the key change and was definitely a huge risk for her, which are saved mostly due her vocals cause the production is just okay."

**MihaMijat**: "This grew on me so much. It's a great song tbh"

**enecks**: "This song is a hot mess in production, but god damn it I love it. Is it Stockholm Syndrome? Is my love for this song a PERFECT ILLUSION?"

**omgcow**: "This is just terrible. There‚Äôs really nothing I can say here that hasn‚Äôt already been said. This song physically hurts me to listen to. The keychange gave me a migraine. The way she pronounces LAAAHHVVV gave me gastrointestinal distress. I hate this fucking song"

**Joebiekong**: "Why is this 10 doing here? No it isnt‚Ä¶ Its a Perfect Illusion"

**eribertknows**: "Sometimes I love this, sometimes I hate it, so I'll give it an average rating."

**Palutzel**: "f the haters, it's a good song, clearly not as good as her past singles, but it's a banger"

**marcryan**: "/u/Automod What‚Äôs Good?"

**Dracyoshi**: "Perfect Illusion has the best bridge that I've ever heard! The chorus is somewhat grating and repetitive, but the bridge more than makes up for it. I'll listen to the song a hundred times for the bridge alone. Oh wait, I already did!"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "IT WASN‚ÄôT LAHVVVV"

**havanabrown**: "I first heard this on the radio the day it was released and was not expecting a rock song to be her 3 year comeback and was bitterly disappointed at first. Now this song is everything and that KEY CHANGE tho oh man that key change"

**arandomgiraffe**: "Flop"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "MA MA PA PA PA PERFECT FLOPLUSION"

**spacebabe27**: "A punchy, fun introduction to the Joanne era and not at all deserving of the hate it receives."

**superr_rad**: "henny. This isn't bad, but is it really lead single worthy?"

**soeri**: "I hated this song on my first listen, but now its one of my favorite songs of 2016. The guitar riff, the noisy ass build up, Gaga's vocals... it gets me super hype and I love it iconic 10/10 deserves a grammy"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I really wish Kevin Parker was on more songs on this album cause this is a BOP. I know not everyone likes this song but I‚Äôm really into the production and Gaga‚Äôs vocals on the chorus. Make all the memes you want but I love this flop"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I'm so up and down on this track depending on how I'm feeling so I'm gonna give it a score that reflects that"

**bliamc**: "Perfect Illusion is really good y‚Äôall, stop sleeping on it and get with it"

**Awhile2**: "I love that the Gaga stans have collectively decided to give all their 11‚Äôs to a song that literally has 0 chance of being top 10"

**Tipttt284**: "Just takes a tad too long to fade to black."

**DrunkHurricane**: "This song had a lot of potential but oh my god that vocal production is awful"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "IT WAS LAAAAHVE"

**Death_Soup**: "Second best song on the album. #JusticeForPerfectIllusion"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "Even if it got better with time... I'm still disappointed."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "this is so aggressively meh"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "thank u based kevin"

**mother_rucker**: "Okay I hated this when I first heard it, but now I‚Äôm into it. The chorus is fun to sing along to."

**Wailordfan**: "It is a FUCKING BOP you h8rs."

**qetaz**: "meh"

**Reifiui**: "This would have been AWESOME if only the guitars had more presence in the mix like what the intro presented, too bad because I feel that's all the song needs in order to really click with me if it had that extra fire"

**femaleghostbuster**: "Look, I liked it..."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Oof. Why would you choose this as a lead single?"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "how do you go from releasing a lead single like bad romance to releasing this crap as a lead single 6 years later"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Still the catchiest song on the album."

**Zugtris**: "overrated? perfect delusion?? flopga is back??? shut the fuck up"

**misguidedzombie**: "Verses are good but the chorus could be better. Not even the key change could make me love this song."

**huntyphobic**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RScN-IqUaOY"

**raicicle**: "In all honesty, this song has grown on me a lot. I do think that the key change is a vital part of the song, mostly because the song‚Äôs energy only really picks up after it."

**youknwnothingjonsnow**: "probably the worst and messiest first single ever released by a top level popstar"

**leviOHsa**: "I don‚Äôt understand why this song is so decisive, whenever I hear it I want to jump on a mechanical bull, screaming the lyrics into a microphone and living my whore fantasy. What more do you want?"

**JohnnyToby**: "lyrics can be nice I guess but flop"

**seferre2**: "okay yeah not the most fun song or catchy but i like listening to it it's a very unique song at the very least"

**VioletChutzkee**: "I don't hate this as much as I used to. It's not THAT bad. But the chorus is ugly and the pitch shift is tragic."

**eklxtreme**: "the instrumentation is still the best part and i still think it sounds like the beginning of the pokemon theme song"

**joshually**: "The theme song to the riveting documentary telling the story of Gaga's deep downward descent from the top... to the lower dredges of the pop world."

**snidelaughter**: "Key changes are automatically good unless you're Meghan Trainor. #AutoModDidNothingWrong"

**Yatcho**: "RIP Lady Gaga (2006-2016)"

**veryunfinished**: "this grew on me but she still sounds really bad on the chorus."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "honestly I might have a mental breakdown and several seizures in the desert too if I had to listen to this enough times. just once & it's okay though."

letsallpoo: 
**twat_brained**: "I would never have chosen this as the lead single, but it‚Äôs definitely grown on me within the past several months :)"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Don't understand why this was so hated or adored, it's just ok."

**TonyRealm**: "It‚Äôs unfortunate that this howler of a song was the lead single, as the rest of ‚ÄòJoanne‚Äô is way better than this. The lyrics are vacuous, Gaga oversings everything, and the key change is embarrassingly forced. Production-wise it‚Äôs not totally awful as I do like some of the guitar work, but it all clashes horribly whenever the vocals come in."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Man, I really wanted to like this track. Initially, I did, but I tempered my expectations and realized it's really a less interesting take on a Let It Happen-esque Kevin Parker produced track. And unfortunately, as repetitive as the drums on the track are, they're arguably the strongest part of the track. Gaga's vocals are one-toned and the chorus isn't clever enough to justify how many times I hear the phrase 'it was a perfect illusion'. The bridge is pretty great though, and saves the song from being a 4 or 5, because the instrumental gets interesting, and the background vocals add some well-needed layering."

**Therokinrolla**: "üçµ, the song. Perhaps the worst choice for a lead single I‚Äôve ever seen, not only did it set the expectations for the album low, but it took up a single spot that could‚Äôve been filled by Dancin‚Äô In Circles, A-YO, John Wayne, or Diamond Heart. Perfect Illusions has all he wrong things going for it, but when i look past those things, I see an okay song. I find the way she vocalizes this song as unique and catchy. And yet, I will never get over how quickly this song is over. One minute and twenty second in, the first two verses and choruses are already over, and we get a minute of decent bridge, then the amazing key change, then an outtro that drags on for too long. It is covered it flaws, not even the alluring kind that make ARTPOP my favorite album of all time, but the kind that really bring down a song that is supposed to sell your album. I still love the theme she is tackling, and I love the chorus, but damn Gaga. Why?"

**blue_charles**: "People loathe this track. They loathe it. This was supposed to be Gaga's big comeback single, but it turned out to be such a flop that only automod stanned it in the end. That is automod and me. I love Perfect Illusion. Like, I love love love Perfect Illusion. Like every second of it is kinda perfect for me kinda love. The screaming synths that start the song and that reappear throughout the song. The simplistic, yet pounding glam rock production. The angry, almost deranged vocal performance from Gaga that flips from betrayal and sadness to anger and frustration on a dime and seems to just barely toe the line of sanity. The way you don't just hear the pain during the final chorus, you FEEL it. The bridge. That fucking bridge with the layered panicked, frantic vocals under Gaga just absolutely BELTING and then building into that key change that gives me LIFE. The way it fades out at the very end, Gaga's vocals echoing into silence for a few seconds before smoothly transitioning the reflective Million Reasons, the absolute perfect follow-up the frenzied, barely controlled insanity that is Perfect Illusion. This song is fucking brilliant, and I will actually fight you on that. I even liked the music video. So yeah, I might have thrown away my 11 but fight me, I love this song. Cash me outside how bout dat?"

**estreindre**: "i liked this song when it first came out but... honestly, it's so disappointing. not because it's bad, but because it had SOOO much potential it wasted. this song SHOULD have been great with how fucking killer the production on it is (seriously, the first few seconds of this song get me sooo hyped up) but gaga feels like she kinda wastes it."

**ExtraEater**: "The Wild & Wacky Misadventures of Stefani Germanotta; Ah yes, the iconic flop and song of /r/popheads. I don't think I want to write a story for this because the other raging comments for this and poo's writeup will already be good enough. *[editor's note: oops]* My opinion on this song? It's honestly amazing, and this opinion mainly came about from /r/popheads shoving the song in my face as bad so much. But lemme just write a real short piece: Lady Gaga dies, she reborn as a fish, she flops on the beach, a bird comes in and eats her, The End, buy emotion on itunes carly slay jepson /r/popheads being too extra with memes etc. etc. etc."

**calltehshots**: "I know this sub has a weird boner for this song but it really is THAT bad. If any pop girl dropped this as the lead single, ya'll would be dragging. She sounds like The Count from Sesame Street and the key change isn‚Äôt even that good?? I feel like I‚Äôm on crazy pills when I read the comments on this sub about this song. Thank god the rest of the album wasn‚Äôt like this song but just an awful awful single."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "the wailing vocals fit with the lyrics SO well like... it sounds like she's really feeling Some Shit. the key change also works because like, the way i see it it's like a representation of that moment when she actually had that discovery like 'OH! oh shit!' and i love it. also i'm calling that either this or Private ShitShow ends up with highest controversy score (most likely this)"

**SkyBlade79**: "When I first started hearing this song, I hated it, I would give it maybe a three, and I completely dragged it on my blog. Now, I think it‚Äôs pretty good, actually. I appreciate the strange song structure, the production is good, and even though ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt laaaahhhv‚Äù can get annoying, the rest of the song is really not that bad."

**Willybae00**: "This song looks great on paper, but sounds horrible in my ears - Fun fact: This is the only song I've blocked on my Daily Mix because no matter how many times I skip it immediately, it just kept popping up and I could not stand the chorus. I think Sia, Demi, or Rihanna could‚Äôve done a great job with this song. Alternatively, this could‚Äôve been one of those hit EDM songs with a lead female singer like Zara, Jess Glynne, Hailee, or Halsey. I think at the end of the day, Gaga just took a huge risk with the song, which is what you have to ultimately do as an artist if you want to last long in the industry. I'm certain she can bounce back from this track"

#19 - Chespin

Average: 5.805
Controversy: 2.3401
My Rating: 6

Highest Scores: (10 x1): BearlyEvenAPun (9 x2): bluehxrizon, Cryomatic (7.2 x1): estreindre (7 x3): skiddos, NapsAndNetflix, Reifui

Lowest Scores: (0 x2): My friend, (and) enecks (1 x1): cabblue

‚Äúa bit messy, but makes up for it with how‚Äù ~TeamAwesome4, the writer. Today, we‚Äôre still trying to find the end of the sentence.

‚ÄúLiterally why‚Äù ~enecks

Basing it on it‚Äôs ‚Äúcool‚Äù style, Naps says, ‚Äúoh shit a pokemon with a hat that's cool‚Äù. Apparently, it was batmanji‚Äôs ‚Äúfirst time...ever pick[ing] a grass starter and it's worth bc this guy is great, he has a hat and will fight you‚Äù. Also referencing Chespin‚Äôs hat, Therokinrolla says that Chespin is ‚Äúlike louise from bobs burgers but lame‚Äù. well I hope Chespin isn‚Äôt hiding a hideous rash under there.

For estreindre, ‚Äúit loses points for its awkard middle evolution, but i actually really dig its first and last evolutionary stages.‚Äù BearlyEvenAPun agrees, saying ‚ÄúChespin and Chesnaught are both amazing, but wtf happened to quilladin‚Äù.

Yeah, fuck G-Eazy, but honestly if this didn't flop I think it would be higher. Like I remember the sub collectively losing their shit when this first released. The production is really nice and Britney sounds great, and it's not some kiddie mess like Pretty Girls was. It's honestly a great introduction to the album and to the way Britney's presenting herself in this new pop zeitgeist. Let's just ignore the music video. And G-Eazy. Especially G-Eazy.

---

It's Gerald, bitch!

**huntyphobic**: "Gr-Easy poisoned /r/popheads water supply, burned our crops, and delivered a plague unto our houses!"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Go away G-Eazy"

**VodkaInsipido**: "I can't believe G-Eazy has a whole 45 seconds on this. And also all it's lazy. I hate this. Delete it Britney."

**skiddos**: "I can't hate this even if it has G-Cheazy on it"

**Yatcho**: "They really threw all their money at this song and you can tell, production is on another level compared to most of the songs on the album. Don't mind Greasy's verse either"

**-dolantello-**: "miss me with that bad Drake immitation of a G-Eazy verse but the rest is decent"

**veryunfinished**: "the chorus of this song is so good. everything else i don‚Äôt care about. g-eazy makes me want to die but like i said, the chorus is really good."

**mother_rucker**: "I thought Britney left obnoxious white rappers in her past, but clearly she didn‚Äôt."

**Wailordfan**: "I liked this as a lead single. The chorus/pre-chorus is really nice, but I still can't stand her voice in general in the verses. I'd rather have G-Eazy do the whole song tbh, I at least don't want to cut my ears off listening to him most of the time. Jk, his verse blows. Forgot how bad it is."

**seferre2**: "the production is amazing. the oohs are kinda annoying though and g eazy is weak"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I do like this beat a good amount, and Britney sings well, but holy fuck do I hate G-Lazy so much, and I really just want to rid his verse from existence. I also kinda wish the chorus was stronger, it doesn't totally stand out to me."

**blue_charles**: "I skip this when I sense G-Eazy's rap verse coming up. The last chorus isn't worth sitting through that."

**eklxtreme**: "never understood the hate for this because it‚Äôs a certified bop and that chorus kills me, i guess g-eazy is the worst part here"

**Willybae00**: "The song itself is good and all, but I just wish I could hear her better ‚Äì It‚Äôs a mixture of breathe on me and everytime in terms of sound, except I can understand what she‚Äôs saying in both those songs. It also doesn‚Äôt help that G-Eazy verse is subpar at best. The only reason I listen to the song in full is because I just love how she sings ‚Äúmake me ooh‚Äù at the very end"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "listening to G-Eazy‚Äôs part is like fucking someone ugly, you just have to put a paper bag over their head and pretend they‚Äôre not G-Eazy"

**dirdbub**: "this WAS a 7, but G-Eazy (somehow!) knocked this all the way down to a 4. impressive if you asked me, like how do you have *that* shit of a verse"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Damn I forgot about this song. I remember hearing it a few times on the radio but I thought it was shit but I was really sleeping on this one. Britney‚Äôs hook is great and catchy on this, as well as this great production. G-Eazy of course ruins it but still I really like Britney‚Äôs part. Dang I might be turning into a Britney fan whoops"

**JunkyGS**: "time has made me less harsh on the song but is still painfully average with G Eazy adding nothing of value."

**estreindre**: "i actually kinda like britney on this, but GOD does g-eazy fucking suck."

**omgcow**: "The absolute travesty of the music video kinda ruins this for me, as does G-Eazy, but it‚Äôs still super sexy. Britney sounds so great here."

**calltehshots**: "Even with G-Eazy's verse, this is still a SONG."

**qetaz**: "fine, nothing special, loses a point for the G Easy verse"

**arandomgiraffe**: "did G-reasy really try to rhyme ‚Äúwoman‚Äù with ‚Äúcome on‚Äù"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "i don't know why you don't like this, it's good and G-Eazy is not that bad, a true bop"

**spacebabe27**: "Was a solid track until G-Sleazy had to step in with a shitty rap verse that contributed nothing to the song itself."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The other parts of the song aren‚Äôt really my thing and I was kinda just bored, but G Eazy kills whats left of it"

**Palutzel**: "it's a good song, nothing exceptional about it and that g-eazy part is a big NOPE"

**TonyRealm**: "I don‚Äôt care for G-Eazy's part, but Britney sounds sensational. Production is sleek and that chorus is heavenly."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Even G-Eazy couldn‚Äôt save this song :("

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "it‚Äôd probably be a 9 or 10 without g-eazy tbh"

**chihuahuazero**: "It‚Äôs pretty but not much else. The guitar in the verses is interesting, but the post-chorus break is fuzzy. And I can excuse an unremarkable rap feature-- but only if the rest of the song is entertainment. While this was made all around to be a lead single, it fails to rise to its expectations."

**leviOHsa**: "This is an abortion of a song. Seriously can‚Äôt comprehend that people think this is even decent. G-Eazy might be the ‚Äúbest‚Äù thing about this song, and that‚Äôs not a compliment. In the immortal words of Alyssa Edwards, this is garbage mawma."

**Zugtris**: "i was bopping until i heard his voice."

**Therokinrolla**: "It took some time to get used to but the drop on this track is really good, but I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE DAY when good songs stop using unnecessary rap features"

**SpanKKy1**: "Make me poo with that laxational flow Eazy"

**JoeThaMo**: "On the one hand, I'm honestly not too fond of this guy, but on the other, I feel like the song kinda needed something to mix things up a bit - and even if he does look absolutely yucky in the MV, his verse on this track honestly isn't THAT bad imo..."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "greasy drags this down sooo sooo much, and it wasn't great to begin with"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "This is good and like the music video is fine and remember when Britney rejected G-Eazy on TV it gave us that so we should all be #blessed"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Despite G-Eazy's sort of cringey verse, this song is Britney's great comeback after the disasters that were Britney Jean and Pretty Girls. I think just this single alone makes me wish she released this album after Femme Fatale, not Britney Jean."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "this song would be higher if G-Eazy wasn't so boring."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "g-slutty ruins it"

---

**mokitsu** is Gerald's sole supporter: "Well I love this song, and it was a great choice for lead single! I love the vocal distortion on the 'Oooh's and G-Eazy's rap verse isn't half bad."

Nevermind, **SkyBlade79** seems to like him as well: "The pre-chorus isn‚Äôt bad at all, though the ‚Äúdrop‚Äù is mediocre. The lyrical content is also really weird. G-Eazy is the best part of the song (fight me), and I‚Äôm not even a fan, but his verse is good." You ready to fight the entire sub, scrawny boy?

**Macubass** gives us "Christina talking about Bionic" teas: "too ahead of its time, not appreciated enough"

**MrSwearword**: "BEST. TRACK. FROM. GLORY."

**chubs4life**: "I just wanna grind on everything when I hear this."

**mgglite**: "i mean its not bad but its also not very good"

**holly_foxxy**: "i'm not rushing to skip it but i am also entirely uninterested"

**MihaMijat**: "This song is great and sexy. Something a Britney song hasn't been in a long time"

**enecks**: "That guitar should do more. It‚Äôs like a musical Chekhov‚Äôs gun that never gets fired."

**havanabrown**: "Wow that feature is boring. The pre chorus gets me hyped tho"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Should not have been single material, OOOOOH AT ALL"

**bliamc**: "I like it, but it‚Äôs not ~that~ great"

Awhile2 is probably burying **a_rain_of_tears**'s body in his yard at this moment: "i feel like i have an obligation to rate this a seven because i like it better than literally all of anti"

**Death_Soup**: "So good. If not for the guy who proves that us whites can't rap it would have gotten at least .5 more."

Cause when **mirandacrocsgrove** is fistin' u my senses come alive: "this is a 10 and is worthy of its lead single status I will fist anyone who says otherwise!!¬°!"

**Reifiui**: "I can't even be mad and give it a lower score this song is just hilarious"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "It's cute. nothing more."

**JohnnyToby**: "ooh boi"

**joshually** is horny: "The much maligned music video hullaballoo did nothing to help this song's cause, but behind all of that, it's a pretty song, sweet and sexy, like how I like my men from time to time."

**snidelaughter**: "If you can tack on Me, Myself & I on top of a song and make it better, there's something deathly wrong with the song."

**twat_brained**: "I like this song but it never should‚Äôve been a single."

**ImADudeDuh** detects no queer imagery in this song: "I don't need to justify this"

And **raicicle** drags Britney to the pits: "Enjoy this song? Make me. hahahahahahahahahahaha"

It's cute, but sticks out like sore thumb on Anti imo. Like it sounds like it could fit on, I don't know, A Girl Like Me. That's not necessarily a bad thing though-SOS and Unfaithful are bops.

---

**Therokinrolla**: "I could make a joke about the title, saying I feel this way about the song or the album. But naw, I‚Äôll save that slayage for Britney Bitch". If you won't, let's see who did make fun of the title:

**leviOHsa**: "The name is apt. This song is so boring it felt never ending."

**omgcow**: "I would make a joke about this song being neverending but I‚Äôm sure somebody else can do it better."

**Palutzel**: "the title is the best description for ANTI (jk, don't kill me), the song is ok, but still boring"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "everything is never ending just like this damn song"

**Macubass**: "pls end"

---

People somehow remember who the fuck Dido is:

**Awhile2**: "this song gives me strong Dido White Flag vibes and i love it"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "This song sure feels like it‚Äôs Never Ending amirite????? nah jk this was really good rig this so it gets high"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Am I deaf or am I hearing huge similarities to Dido's Thank You?"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "does anyone else get dido vibes from this???"

**angusaditus**: "why does this sound like a Death Cab For Cutie song???"

---

I don't think **blue_charles** has ever listened to a folk album: "This is highkey folky, right? Rihanna's doing a folk song? Um, ok. werk."

**eklxtreme**: "her vocals are very sweet and beautiful here, I like the change of pace from the album"

**joshually**: "The title is how this song feels while I'm listening to it."

**snidelaughter**: "Eh, not really for acoustic guitar Rihanna."

**veryunfinished**: "this is cute i guess. i wouldn‚Äôt listen to it normally but it‚Äôs a nice song. rihanna acoustic isn‚Äôt a bad sound. the lyrics could be better."

**Willybae00**: "I like her voice in this song but the song doesn‚Äôt do anything for me, it just feels hard to listen to"

**twat_brained**: "It's rather soothing hearing Rihanna do easy listening. I could get used to this!"

**ImADudeDuh**: "I wanted to like this, but it's just too boring"

**BionicFunhouse**: "What the fuck this song is great, why doesn‚Äôt it receive more attention?"

**skiddos**: "Cute. Sounds like a song that would be played at the credits of an indie movie."

**mokitsu**: "Boring, filler, bad! Rihanna who told you to put this in the album!!!!!! Skip it every time"

**Rourke_**: "a little dull compared to the rest of ANTI"

**MrSwearword**: "I can‚Äôt with the sudden subtle guitar work after Same Ol‚Äô Mistakes. Fucks with the cohesion of the album [not the only thing, but that‚Äôs beside the point.]"

**mgglite**: "cheesy but at least the melody isn't completely boring, also it doesn't sound exactly like 4 other songs from the same album"

**dirdbub**: "I feel like I‚Äôve heard this song before, but not in a Rihanna song. weird"

**JunkyGS**: "This song definitely sticks out the most and is very delicate sounding. It is pleasant and sweet, but sorta out of place."

**enecks**: "Hey why didn‚Äôt people tell me this album had songs like this in it"


**TonyRealm**: "This ballad doesn‚Äôt do anything for me, it's generic and forgettable."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Who knew the Rihanna would make 2 soulful guitar ballads that make me cry?"

**havanabrown**: "I like the almost haunting vibe this song has"

**spacebabe27**: "Very different sound than I would expect from her but she manages to pull it off so effortlessly."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "This is actually a really sweet ballad and although pretty average, I love it."

**jamesfog**: "This always gives me Life Is Strange vibes"

**bliamc**: "kinda boring"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "only song i thought i recognised. Maybe that's because it's actually a good song for once"

**Death_Soup**: "Most boring song on the whole album, yet it's still pretty great"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Not really a an of acoustic Rihanna tbh"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "Nice, in the ‚Äúrejected LOTR instrumental‚Äù way."

**Wailordfan**: "It was really interesting to have the intro being a repeating part in the song, as kinda an interlude of sorts at the beginning and after the chorus."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's a more country oriented song for Rihanna, and it's more lo-fi than most of the songs on the album. It works, because the underlying melody is pretty great, but unfortunately, it's nothing unremarkable as some of the other tracks are."

**qetaz**: "her voice is really nice here ÔÅä" ÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅäÔÅä

**SkyBlade79**: "I love the guitar in this, I like how it‚Äôs toned back, and it has something for everyone to enjoy."

**chihuahuazero**: "This is a nice song to play while walking down a wintery street, and the streetlights illuminate the fog, which my Environmental Science teacher said wasn‚Äôt typical in the area. The fog, I mean."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "I like this"

**SpanKKy1**: "My love for /u/napsandnetflix is never ending". You're cheating on Shawn now?

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Sorry, Rihanna, I wanted to give my 0 to something and this was pretty mediocre to be honest. I don't like these types of songs."

**JohnnyToby**: "cute"

God, seeing the low scores for this keep pouring in was just painful. It was solidly top 30 for a while but then it just fell down and couldn't get back up. I was weeping as I was putting in scores. It's easily the strangest song on the album, but also one of the catchiest. There's so much weird shit going on in the production, and then Britney is singing about her chakras and shit. Like it's just so random and zany but also amazing. I don't understand why y'all didn't like it as much.

---


**Wailordfan**: "I actually like the seductive smoother sound on the chorus despite the huge busy backtrack. It actually makes me think of a movie where a girl meets a guy across the busy dance floor, and even though the song playing overhead is a legit 'Pop-Your-Pussy' jam, you only know this is fucking romantic and it sounds like wedding bells instead. I actually really like it."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "What the actual fuck is this beat this has me shook. Imagine if the whole album was with beats as experimental as these, this is game changing right here. On top of that Britney is all over the place in the best way. This song just goes in directions I would've never expected from the intro, and I love it so much."

**VodkaInsipido**: "My BOP detector must be not working because I didn't expect this MY GOD."

**skiddos** is about to summon Azealia: "What are those random chicken noises though". **LuigiEatsPopcorn** as well: "why does she sound like she‚Äôs a chicken at the beginning"

**Macubass**: "so artsy". Yas.

**mokitsu**: "This is the best song ever!!!!!!! I don't know what the writers were smoking but I want some of it!"

**MrSwearword**: "Alright, what the fuck does ‚ÄúYou and me fit a magic trick...‚Äù mean? Also, the beat is nearly soundclash ridden mess sounding like Aqua & The Vengaboys on off days."

**holly_foxxy**: "i only wish the chorus went harder"

**dirdbub**: "this beat is.. interesting, but I can‚Äôt dig anything else in the song"

**JunkyGS**: "actually have steam coming from my ears from the rage of how BOP after BOP after BOP are bonus tracks when trash like just luv me, love me down & just like me are normal album tracks"

**MihaMijat**: "Again with the bad chorus". Okay, Maroon 5 stan.

**enecks**: "Agressivelty unpleasant to listen to"

**estreindre**: "this song feels really unique! love that about it!"

**omgcow**: "This is so great and it has such a unique sound, I love it."

**calltehshots** is trembling because Britney is talking about her chakras on a fire beat: "Britney talking about her chakras on a fire beat? I‚Äôm trembling"

**eribertknows**: "I thought Liar almost saved the album but then this came on." I hope God saves you.

**Palutzel**: "yas this is gooood, the beat‚Äôs on fiyah"

**TonyRealm**: "This beat is fascinating, but I think it‚Äôs a bit too jumbled and overpowering."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "A weird synth kazoo will not make your boring song better."

**havanabrown**: "If I‚Äôm listening to this song again in the future I‚Äôll be dancing that‚Äôs for sure"

**arandomgiraffe**: "the dude screaming ‚Äústee‚Äù in the background ruins this song‚Ä¶"

**spacebabe27**: "I got way more into this as it progressed than I thought I would be initally."

**superr_rad**: "I gave this a 10 after 30 seconds of listening to it.."

**soeri** is projecting: "more trash i don't remember"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Not bad, but maybe it‚Äôs just the ‚Äòrun away with me‚Äô lyric, the vocal melodies are very nice I‚Äôll admit"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Again, nothing special"

**bliamc**: "This song is so weird and I love it. I was not expecting something this strange on a Britney album, but kudos to her"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Just by the first five seconds, I wanna be a hoe and twerk to this."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "there is no if here, i'm definitely dancing to this"

**Death_Soup**: "this is really bad"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "This is so gooooooood."

**Nerdy_boy_chris** is an Ed Sheeran stan: "Generic."

**qetaz**: "what is with that voice in the background randomly calling out ‚Äústick‚Äù?? This song could have been a totally average 5 like it's predecessors but that background vocal made me want to tear my hair out"

**Reifiui**: "I would be more into this song without that beeping thing that keeps coming out of nowhere and doesn't sound good at all"

**angusaditus**: "pop perfection"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "The only dance song on this album that is not terrifyingly bad. Kinda sad really."

**SkyBlade79**: "Completely 100% production carried." Does that make it bad? I don't understand criticism like this.

**Therokinrolla**: "Would be higher but I cannot get over those clucking sounds wtf britney bitch"

**leviOHsa**: "From the first beat I wanted it to stop. Then it just kept getting worse."

**JohnnyToby** wishes he were listening to Miranda: "Some parts of it remind me of a church song but other than that this was a religious experience. Also‚Ä¶..SMACK!"

**blue_charles**: "I really like the weird ass synth that starts the song and keeps popping up throughout it. It almost reminds me of something off the Vroom Vroom EP tbh. The rest of the song can leave, though, especially that chorus which is just... not good."

**VioletChutzkee**: "It kinda loses steam afyer a while, but I get super happy when this song starts playing! Issa bop."

**eklxtreme**: "besides wendy williams, why does this remind me of that vengaboys song"

**joshually**: "Literally the funnest song on this stellar album, If I'm Dohncing is so lite and joyful and easy breezy beautiful, and a true example of a perfect pop song."

**veryunfinished**: "this song is kind of a mess. the beat is way too cluttered (are there random noises in the beat or am i just hearing things). it‚Äôs not completely off-putting though."

**Willybae00**: "deserves to be a single! I don‚Äôt care if she has to include it on B10 as a bonus track called ‚ÄúI‚Äôf I‚Äôm Dancing 2.0‚Äù with the exact same everything, and then releases it as a single with a video that hypersexualizes some animal while Britney is walking around looking as fine as always and ever."

**twat_brained** has an accurate username: "The music is off-point and the vocals hardly do anything to save it."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Sounds like Britney singing over an SNES game". IS THAT A BAD THING? I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU PEOPLE. WHY DID YOU GIVE THIS A 2 ON THE LAST DAY? I SHOULD HAVE REJECTED YOUR SCORES

ExtraEater: #17 - Charmander

Average: 6.382
Controversy: 2.5289
My Rating: 9

Highest Scores: (11 x1): NapsAndNetflix (10 x2): BearlyEvenAPun, JunkyGS (9 x2): ExtraEater, enecks

Lowest Scores: (0 x2): TeamAwesome4, alternativeoxygen (2 x1): gannade

NapsAndNetflix lovingly calls it ‚ÄúCharjesus‚Äù, and estreindre ‚Äúloooove[s] how cute its first form is but it starts to lose points as it evolves for me‚Äù. Quite understandably, but dragons are cool, and cool > cute in this case tbh. BearlyEvenAPun believes ‚ÄúCharizard may be a bit overused at times (2 megas why), but it's not without good reason‚Äù. ImADudeDuh thinks ‚ÄúCharmeleon is hella ugly‚Äù

TeamAwesome4 slaps down a sharp 0, ‚Äúmostly because Charizard is the most overrated Pokemon in existence‚Äù and I sadly have to disagree there. Just wait ‚Äòtill you see some of the Top 10 here. gannade says he‚Äôs ‚Äúhighkey sabotaging this‚Äù, which is true because he gave high scores to nearly every other pokemon.

Therokinrolla gives a hypothetical story: ‚Äúok so imagine you dried picking this whore up and you got whipped by the tail and you died thats no fun this one was not thought through‚Äù. Let‚Äôs also remember that Charmander can literally die if his tail burns out so rip if he ever gets caught in the middle of rain (i didn‚Äôt watch that much pokemon so i never saw pokemon lore so i‚Äôm sorry if they addressed this in the show real stans)

rip /u/ImADudeDuh

This is such a dire track, I'm surprised that it comes at the end of a largely uplifting and regenerative album. It's my favorite ballad on the album, though, if not just for its backstory, but also for the imagery, especially that of someone getting shot by that church where she used to meet. It's a bit political, especially with the 'where are our leaders' bit, which just adds to the greatness for me.

---

The Meanest Comment Award goes to **SpanKKy1**: "Stay down". Ouch. 

The Most Insightful Comment Award goes to **Therokinrolla**: "The TRULY political track of the record, Gaga sings about Treyvon Martin and pissed off #BlueLivesMatter people everywhere. But yes, the excellent production from RedOne and vocals that really shine during the chorus, it is a perfect closer to the standard edition, as ,‚ÄùSave that angel Hear that angel Catch my angel‚Äù delicately fades into the background, marking the ending of an almost perfect album."

**blue_charles**: "Strong emotional core with strong emotional core and excellent delivery from Gaga. What's not to love? You can hear the pain and confusion in her voice when she almost screams 'where are our leaders?'"

**eklxtreme**: "the second half with the string section and harmonizing is beautiful, great lyrics although i think her vocals don't have as much emotion here as the other tracks"

**snidelaughter**: "All of the songs on each album have fitting outros, but none quite as fitting as Angel Down is with the narrative of the album. It may not be the best of the album enders, but it's the most consistent to the album as a whole."

**veryunfinished**: "i'm not sure i'd look to lady gaga of all people for a song about the murder of trayvon martin, but it's more tasteful than i would've thought from her. i guess." This is a criticism I've seen a lot but I think Gaga handles the tragedy well. I think it's not that preachy, but rather it just tries to instill this feeling of confusion, like you're lost in an unfamiliar place.

**skiddos**: "Beautiful lyricism"

**Macubass**: "trash"

**mokitsu**: "It's a cute song, I appreciate her support of BLM tho!"

**Rourke_**: "Lacks the rawness of the worktape, but I like the outro"

**MrSwearword**: "Simply put, she sells the shit out of this."

**mgglite**: "jesus this album really took a turn for the worse somewhere"

**JunkyGS**: "I like the story behind the song but I didn't like Gagas vocals as much on this song even though the lyrics are above average for a gaga song."

**MihaMijat**: "This was very close to 11, it's perfect"

**enecks**: "Another good song, but the intro promises buildup that never delivers as much as it should for me."

**estreindre**: "it's... okay. a little pretty but nothing incredible."

**omgcow**: "Mediocre but not offensive to my senses"

**calltehshots**: "I appreciate what she was trying with this but it's not really working"

**Palutzel**: "powerful, poignant and amazing song"

**TonyRealm**: "I think this song is trying a bit too hard, and I‚Äôm not quite feeling the emotion I think it wants me to feel. However, Gaga‚Äôs voice basically saves the track for me, especially when she belts the final chorus."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "I guess its sad?"

**havanabrown**: "This is the ballad that Gaga should‚Äôve released as a single over Million Reasons. Everything about it is perfect; the melody, the vocals, the emotion, I love it"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Very solid melancholy ballad, closes out the album well, I really like some of those background instruments"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Super duper emotional track from Gaga here and an amazing closer to the standard edition, the production is gorgeous and haunting, and Gagas vocals are raw in the best way"

**bliamc**: "So preachy, so heavy handed"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "she meant well but this is so heavy handed lmao"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I really apperciate the message that Gaga is trying to tell here. I feel like this song is very important, especially given to the context of the political climate right now."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "gaga is both queen of sinners and queen of angels, queen of judeochristian imagery"

**Death_Soup**: "Pretty but kinda boring."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is sweet."

**Wailordfan**: "Probably the best minimalistic production on the album. The chimey bell things in the choruses are so good. I even like the outro with the whispery voices. I think I just like this album because it is so much easier to belt out to, rather then, say the fame monster, I can't get into the lyrics so much (except bad romance, that shit pops y'all)."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Great closing track. Really impactful stuff, and it may be hard to follow Hey Girl, but damn, Angel Down really hits hard. You can hear the pain in her voice."

**Raykel**: "The quiet cry at the end really puts emphasis on the tragedy of the subject. It makes the song for me."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "She sounds really ingenuine here, which takes this would-have-been-a-tear-jerker-song and puts it in the trash."

**SkyBlade79**: "This is a fitting closer, a somber and chilling track about the modern world, her religious stance, and (according to her twitter) Trayvon Martin's untimely death. The orchestral instrumental is reminiscent of Lana Del Rey, but Gaga brings her own soulful vocals and style to the track. It's powerful and sad, and it ends the album on a very good note."

**chihuahuazero**: "If you excuse the first line, it‚Äôs affecting."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Boring."

**leviOHsa**: "It‚Äôs a really fresh ballad, with a strong message, powerful vocals, cool guitar arrangement. How can you dislike this song?"

**JohnnyToby**: "weird"

**seferre2**: "WEAK and not even that dramatic tbh"

**twat_brained**: "The song just feels to mellow and too downtrodden for me to feel an emotional connection to it."

**ImADudeDuh**: "kinda boring"

Yeah I always thought this song was annoying. Like the production, esp. the srings, is okay, but the way it comes together with her voice aggravates me. The critic circlejerking about this track when Anti was released made me like it less tbh (looking at you, Pitchfork).

---

Nobody listened to Kylie's "Higher" I suppose:

**melisanyans**: "carly did it better"

**arandomgiraffe**: "carly did it better dont ban me mods"

**superr_rad**: "I mean...Carly's Higher is definitely better. But I appreciate Rihanna reaching for those notes. She doesn't sound amazing but i love the rawness of the vocals"

---

Pretty much everyone talked about her vocals but fuck this song I'm running out of time on these writeups:

**mgglite**: "holy shit i know rihanna isn't the greatest at high notes but this is (was) 2016, surely whoever produced this could figure out how to make her vocals not sound like she's been smoking twenty packs of cigarettes a day"

**holly_foxxy**: "omg the vocals are so raw and real i only wish it were longer"

**JamesTheGent**: "It would be perfect if it was just a bit longer."

**ProphecyPizza**: "Rih is queen of iconic songs that are too short."

**dirdbub**: "completely forgettable"

**JunkyGS**: "Vocals for fucking days! Best vocals of her career and in the thread imo. Her voice is so desperate sounding as she progressively brakes down with such emotional rasp. The song really documents the feeling of you being lonely and at that breaking point some people reach, which results in them reaching out to their ex."

**enecks**: "Boy you got me feeling pretty"

**omgcow**: "Why does it sound like she strained her voice so much and why do I feel like I can hear her vocal chords begging for mercy"

**Willybae00**: "This is where she lets it all out. I‚Äôve heard a few people bash on her vocals on this song, but that doesn‚Äôt matter to me, because she‚Äôs not supposed to sound perfect in this. This isn‚Äôt the type of song I would want to sing along to, this is the type of song I would scream along to, because she‚Äôs broken and emotional. This is the type of song that you would want to dedicate to an ex who broke your heart unexpectedly."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "it's like she's serenading a joint"

**twat_brained**: "The novelty of LOTB is that it has a modern twist on an old-fashioned style, despite Rih‚Äôs head voice being out of place. This is just a horrible blend of off-key shrieking and straining. How this made the album I never will nor want to know."

**Joebiekong**: "Eek that voice crack"

**eribertknows**: "This song is a masterpiece and I wish it was longer :("

**Palutzel**: "Rihanna has a nice voice, but I just don't feel this song... or the album"

**TonyRealm**: "This is Rihanna‚Äôs ‚Äúdrunk voicemail‚Äù track, and it‚Äôs beautifully raw, passionate, and intensely relatable. It‚Äôs almost unsatisfyingly short, but I think that further reinforces the realism and emotions."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "I like the retro sound and the sia esque vocals, but it pales in comparison to Love on the Brain. Putting them next to each other was a mistake."

**havanabrown**: "The slight voice cracks on the high notes make it pretty emotional. And the instrumentals are pretty"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Rihanna‚Äôs best vocals on the whole album, perfectly produced, just perfect"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "WHY ARENT YOU LONGER GOD DAMMIT"

**jamesfog**: "This and Love On The Brain go hand in hand"

**bliamc**: "It‚Äôs emotional, it‚Äôs short, and it‚Äôs beautiful."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Rihanna's vocals sounds amazing here. Can she sing this live very well tho? That's the million dollar question."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i have no words anymore i haven't already said"

**Death_Soup**: "The violins are beautiful, but I'm just not feeling this one. Less than great vocals from Rihanna, she's capable of much better."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "SERVING VOCALS!"

**skiddos**: "She really strains in this, but it sounds quite nice."

**Macubass**: "best song on the album, unfortunately slumber party exists to steal the 11"

**mokitsu**: "Love the lyrics and the desperation in her voice but Rihanna keep doing these strained vocals and you'll end up losing them!"

**Rourke_**: "YES GIRL DRUNKENLY HIT THOSE NOTES WE KNOW YOU'LL NEVER REACH AGAIN, we are all Rihanna on this blessed new year's day"

**MrSwearword**: "OH DEAR GOD the noises made right at the 0:54 mark onward was just fucking awful. That shit was so Scratchy, Itchy just killed it in reruns of The Simpsons."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "its just boring tbh"

**mother_rucker**: "Oh my lawd, her vocals are killer on this. The instrumentals are killer on this. She didn‚Äôt drag out the length. PERFECT."

**Wailordfan**: "This is really refreshing and a fun conversational song, with a pretty bomb 'higher' note hit and having a really fun raspy sound, and a really great poem if you just read the lyrics. Super interesting."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Short, but sweet. If this was longer than two minutes, I probably wouldn't like it as much, but it's just about the right length."

**qetaz**: "I want to like this song, but her voice is too raw and strained IMO. I get that's what they were going for but it's too much"

**angusaditus**: "grating vocals tbh, SIA is shook"

**Raykel**: "She sounds drunk and heartbroken, and this makes her vocals the type of raspy I want to here more of from her."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "meh. The song itself is pretty bad, but Rihanna's raw voices really elevate this dead ass song to a non-terrible place. Still, meh."

**chihuahuazero**: "Why couldn‚Äôt she be higher for at least another verse?"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "not bad but not really notable"

**misguidedzombie**: "This sounds like she genuinely recorded it while drunk and/or high and I love everything about it."

**Therokinrolla**: "There is something so beautiful about this track, like, I can imagine an intoxicated Rihanna at a bar with her man and suddenly RiRi drunkenly waddles her way over to the karaoke microphone and slurs out this song to him bc shes crazily in love and shit idk i think its cute"

**huntyphobic**: "It hurts my vocal cords when I listen to this"

**leviOHsa**: "Have I got to the filler tracks at the end of the album. Why so many tracks. Why did this make the cut? Her voice sounds cool I guess."

**JohnnyToby**: "she can sing 0.0" Is that your score or a face?

**seferre2**: "i don't like the emotion the song gives but it's one of the ones on here that doesn't put me to sleep. but her screeches :/"

**ExtraEater**: "Extra x Rihanna Fanfic let's go; I met rihanna at a bar once. We made out and had sex!!! Then I woke up, it was just a dream. I was relieved. 'Oh thank goodness, for a moment there I thought I was actually straight.'"

**blue_charles**: "Rihanna is SERVING you those vocals"

**VioletChutzkee**: "painful tbh"

**eklxtreme**: "she sings with so much emotion here, very beautiful"

**joshually** paints us a lovely image: "Omg she is S T R A I N I N G to catch the top of those notes, like a coconut farmer exhaustedly shimmying up a 50 foot coconut tree to pick dem coconuts for Rihanna to promote Vitacoco in her What's My Name music video."

**snidelaughter**: "I think I'm going to enjoy screechy Rihanna instead of hating it. It's just easier that way."

**veryunfinished**: "i like the production on this, the fuzzy strings. it‚Äôs interesting. that being said i hate how she sounds on this. my vocal cords hurt when i hear this song. just stick to your register rihanna! don‚Äôt do this!"

**calltehshots** ends this by giving us a glimpse into her hobbies: "Yes, an alcoholic karaoke anthem."

‚ÄúTorchic and blaziken are great but seriously wtf is up with the penis bird in between‚Äù ~BearlyEvenAPun, the poet

Despite asking ‚Äúliterally who‚Äù (like he did for every non-Kanto/Johto starter), NapsAndHulu concedes that ‚Äúthis shit‚Äôs cute‚Äù. estreindre says it‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty great, and came before i got super bored of fire/fighting types‚Äù. AGREED with the last point. Don‚Äôt wanna push a minor agenda but imo Fire/Fighting types just seem like they‚Äôre there to appeal to the ‚Äúcool‚Äù pokemon lovers, aka the same kids who liked Charmander bc it‚Äôs a fire lizard. Therokinrolla feels similar. ‚Äúthe first two gen's where both fire dinosaurs and now we get a FUCKING FIRE CHICKEN??? THREE AND A UARTER THUMBS DOWN‚Äù

Rihanna's ballads have always been hit-or-miss with me, but usually miss. She doesn't really make them all that much, and the ones I can think of (Stay, Take a Bow...Farewell?) aren't all that good. Close to You is pretty decent, and I do love how Rihanna's voice works in a ballad like this. But I still get bored after a while.

---

Ballads?

**MihaMijat**: "Such a nice ballop". I love ballops. My favorite is Bjork - Hyperballop.

**skiddos**: "Rih does ballads really well."

**Death_Soup** hears a piano and jumps to the comparisons: "This sounds like an Adele song"

**calltehshots**: "This is gorgeous!!!! A ballad that would most likely be very boring in anyone else‚Äôs hands is completely carried by Rihanna."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch** explains their score: "It's a piano ballad. That's all you need to know about this song."

**havanabrown**: "Sometimes I feel like Rihanna's voice doesn't really suit slow ballads, just cus the way she sings almost seems detached at times and makes it a bit boring. But that's just my onion"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's a great closer. Slow piano ballads have a chance to be boring, but with some Fauntleroy production, it manages to be an engaging, heartfelt closing track."

**Therokinrolla**: "Its a generic ballad tbh that is really outshadowed by Higher"

**superr_rad**: "Not much can go wrong with Rihanna + a piano"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "minus points for making me realise there was more to this album than the standard stream on spotify showed. at least it's a decent ballad"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "It sounds like a YouTube cover of an old ballad (and I mean this in the best way possible)."

**Wailordfan**: "Solid piano ballad."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Just a nice ballad, good mellow closer to the album"

**bliamc**: "A nice ballad, but kinda boring"

**TonyRealm**: "One of Rihanna‚Äôs better ballads. Simple, but sweet."

**blue_charles**: "Downtempo ballad that works great as a standard edition closer, and the instrumental break just works"

**VioletChutzkee**: "Nice ballad, beautiful ballad. Kinda forgettable tho"

**eklxtreme**: "sweet ballad and sweet instrumentation"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this album is making me realize i really enjoy rihanna's ballads more than i thought i already did"

---

**Zugtris**: "one of my favorites. immaculate arrangement, and the lyrics always find their way of hitting the precise spots, no matter how many times i hear this song."

**huntyphobic**: "i jus dont care"

**SpanKKy1**: "More like close to poo"

**potrap**: "One of my favourites from the album. Hauntingly beautiful."

**mokitsu**: "This is not only very calm and soothing but also a tear jerker....One of my favourites from the album"

**Rourke_**: "ANTIclimactic"

**Macubass**: "mediocre"

**MrSwearword**: "The piano work has it score very high. Rihanna‚Äôs relatively subtle vocals add something to the song that just works. Boring compared to the best of this, but not bad."

**mgglite**: "perhaps the most obvious filler track on the album, but not the most obvious filler track in this rate"

**JunkyGS**: "Really sweet sounding, but maybe a bit too similar to Stay composition wise?"

**enecks**: "I feel so close to you right now this song is OK"

**omgcow**: "This feels really blah."

**Palutzel**: "it's nice, but not my style"

**spacebabe27**: "Good but snooze-inducing."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Sweet song that doesn't really stand on its own but does a great job closing out the standard edition"

**jamesfog**: "A great closing track to one of the best albums of 2016"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is a good closer as I feel like this song just ties the album together."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Very relaxing, I approve"

**angusaditus** is on Twitch: "residentsleeper"

**SkyBlade79**: "Just boring."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "good closer but then the deluxe edition happens"

**raicicle**: "The production on this is really gorgeous. Everything‚Äôs drenched in concert hall reverb, but the bass is super intimate and warm."

**leviOHsa**: "Snooze fest. Like it‚Äôs cute, but again, why is it here?"

**JohnnyToby**: "damn this is beautiful especially that bass in the end lord the ending too yep this better be top 5". Not quite, babe.

**seferre2**: "üò¥üò¥"

**joshually**: "That Intro to Piano Playing 101 flourish at the end is basically the story of my life."

**snidelaughter**: "End of the initial album. A fitting end: introspective to the album's bombast, gentle for the comedown of the album's literal and physical highs, and soothing for the energy Rihanna has consistently displayed throughout the entire album."

**veryunfinished**: "i like the piano fills on this. it‚Äôs a fine song, just not one i would listen to again. she sounds really nice on this, kinda understated."

**Willybae00**: "This is a really cute song that I would like to either dedicate to someone or have someone dedicate to me."

**twat_brained**: "The calmness of the piano helps me stay grounded when hearing this album. It‚Äôs a calm break in the action."

**ImADudeDuh**: "This song reminds me of the music from Pixar's UP, and it kinda works"

I'm separating this last comment because I want everyone to read it and reflect on life.

Eh, the opening synths are nice, but it's definitely in the lower tier of Lemonade tracks for me. Although I do think it would fit in beautifully on self-titled, it doesn't work that well here.

---


**JoeThaMo**: "I love listening to this song late at night while I'm lying in bed, it's so soothing"

**VodkaInsipido**: "THAT COSMIC PRODUCTION OH MY GOD, and the chorus is fantastical."

**skiddos**: "not bad but I also never want to listen to this again"

**Macubass** is really cool and very interesting: "cool"

**mokitsu**: "I LOVE the lyrics and the production and the way the song builds up. Another masterpiece."

**MrSwearword** is hating on one of Bey's best songs: "This ‚ÄúXO‚Äù homage style beat. I can‚Äôt. Just NO. Other than that, the song just goes nowhere for me."

**mgglite**: "i thought i finished listening to anti"

**JunkyGS**: "Song was written by one of Beyonce's writers about how much she hates Beyonce's label & that they lied about Beyonce accepting songs which I find funny and ruins the seriousness the song is trying to capture."

**MihaMijat**: "Not feeling the chorus"

**enecks**: "I would‚Äôve given this a 9, but GOD DAMN SOME OF IT SOUNDS LIKE FINAL FANTASY HOW COULD I NOT GIVE THIS A 10."

**estreindre**: "this is where i stop loving the album as much, personally. i'm not a huge fan of the slow songs on this album. still enjoyable though!"

Did you know Carly invented synths? **Joebiekong** does: "Poor man‚Äôs CRJ"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Boring, kind of a waste of what could have been a good instrumental if it didn‚Äôt also sound half finished"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Okay I love the production on this track, but it's kinda basic honestly to be quite honest"

**bliamc** isn't the best at math: "My least favorite song on Lemonade, also I can never remember the lyrics?? because of all the 10 times out of 9?? and 9?? times out?? of 10?? how am I supposed to remember that??"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "underrated gem! gorgeous production, and her vocal delivery is more genuinely vulnerable here than on Sandhuts. also invented improper fractions"

**NapsAndNetflix** sums up our responses to country music in the 2012 rate: "Nah"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The song isn't that good as I remembered when I watched the visual film. But the song is pleasing to listen on the background thanks to Beyonce's vocals as well as its production."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "a bit slow and ballad-y, doesn't quite fit the rest of the album."

**Death_Soup**: "What an absolutely beautiful song. So underrated"

**Nerdy_boy_chris** feels like he's flying: "I feel like I'm flying tbh"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Probably the most forgettable song on the album for me. It's good, but there's nothing about it that really jumps out at me. The lyrics are rather strong, I will say that."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Sounds like a song you would hear in a strip joint, in a good way."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "This one is interesting (and good)"

**Zugtris**: "this song will probably go out early but you'll see by all my other scores that i've rated this album very highly. this song however is the one thing stopping me from seeing this album as perfect. can someone who enjoys it pls do a writeup"

**eklxtreme**: "the subtleties with the keys in the production are really nice, I love her vocals here"

**joshually**: "This song is so boring it started raining really hard in California while I was listening to it because even Mother Nature was so over it."

**snidelaughter**: "Sounds like Beyonc√© doing a Solange cover, to moderate success."

**Yatcho**: "Really pretty song, the production is mindbogglingly good too"

**veryunfinished**: "this still fits in the narrative of the album and yet it feels kind of distant from the other songs? whatever it's still a good pop song."

**twat_brained**: "I like the ambience this song offers. Just further proof of Beyonc√©'s versatility."

**ImADudeDuh**: "God, this song feels like I'm floating ona beautiful cloud while being as petty as possible. It's so perfectly bitchy and rightfully so. It's amazing."

**Therokinrolla**: "A 2 minute song that feels more complete than half of glory."

**huntyphobic**: "When I first heard this song I thought it was whack, but it gets better when you listen to it more."

**SpanKKy1** says some gross shit about Shawn Mendes that I'm deleting.

**raicicle**: "While this is probably the most generic track on Lemonade, it does have one of the sweetest melodies as well. The synth line reminds me a lot of the 00s, so it feels kinda nostalgic."

**leviOHsa**: "It‚Äôs a nice chill moment in the album, but gets close to boring."

**JohnnyToby**: "tooooo short"

**blue_charles**: "I skip it every time. #SorryNotSorry."

**Palutzel** describes how good they are in bed: "it's ok.. but a bit boring"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Great once it gets going, but the intro is kinda too long"

**havanabrown**: "the airy feeling of the song just felt dull"

**spacebabe27**: "The first like 18 seconds of this song give me so much hope for the instrumental to build up but it never does and it's so disappointing."

**Wailordfan** closes things off with a strange description: "The production here is so fucking wet man."

**[All scores](http://pastebin.com/7mmraC5d)**

---

In general I always found this to be too sing-songy for me, but it sometimes really clicks. The chorus is divine, and the production works well for the song. In general, though it's not my kind of ballad, even though it is interesting to hear a song about the Germanotta family tragedy. No, I'm not talking about ARTPOP.

---

Let's start with **DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is probably one of the most beautiful songs Gaga has ever written. I fucking cried when I first listened to this song because Gaga is singing this song from the perspective of her father whom he lost his sister Joanne. It's such a sweet gesture of Gaga. Whoever gave this song bad scores are going to hell tbh." Oh, and who might those people be?

**TaylordSwiftsus**: "'Girl, where do you think you're going?' In the trash can. Where this belongs."

**MrSwearword**: "Intimate, but this campfire vibe irritated the shit out of me."

**holly_foxxy**: "i'm Sorry i'm just so bored"

**estreindre**: "you'd think that the title track of the album would be less mediocre but... ehhhhhh. her voice gets really pretty on this song, but it doesn't do it for me."

**bliamc**: "A nice ballad, but nothing too great"

**omgcow**: "I feel bad saying anything negative about a song dedicated to her dead aunt so I‚Äôll leave it at ‚Äúmeh‚Äù"

**eribertknows**: "I usually love minimalistic stuff but except 'girl, where do you think you're going, going, girl', this is pretty forgettable."

**mokitsu**: "The superior ballad of the album is still super boring. What is thisssss"

**JunkyGS**: "This song was done in one take and the first take, which sadly shows. It could be better with some additional production."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "'heaven's not ready for you' is this a metaphor about how literally nobody wanted Joanne? at least she's self aware."

**Bannerww**: "garbage"

**JohnnyToby**: "chorus really saved it from the boring as heck first verse"

**joshually**: "Gurl where u think u goin, she axxed. Goin straight to bed while listening to this boring azz song ho."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "emotionally appealing, but boring"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "boring af"

**SpanKKy1**: "More like Booanne"

---

And who's not going to hell?

**BionicFunhouse**: "I have already established personal connections to all of these songs, so it‚Äôs hard to assign a numerical value to them."

**VodkaInsipido**: "I didn't come here to cry." Do you know what I mean? If you know what I mean.

**skiddos**: "I think this is my favorite Gaga ballad; it's very sweet."

**Macubass** is really cool and very interesting: "cool song"

**Rourke_**: "gorgeous song, simple but effective"

**JamesTheGent**: "2016's best ballad"

**enecks**: "It‚Äôs nice, but a bit too slight at the start."

**Palutzel**: "that chorus breaks my heart, everything about this song is beautiful"

**TonyRealm**: "This song really tugs at my heartstrings and makes me feel something, which, in the end, is all I want music to do."

**marcryan**: "Seriously the best title track of all time"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "I cry every time"

**twat_brained**: "It‚Äôs cute of Gaga to strip down her music and just make something simple. I can appreciate this :)"

**potrap**: "A timeless classic in the making. The melody, lyrics and instrumentation are beautiful and the song is all that's needed to justify Gaga and Mark's partnership."

**havanabrown**: "The chorus is pretty but other than that it was pretty boring"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "her voice sounds really weird"

**spacebabe27**: "This is such a poignant ballad and an amazing title track. I love this song and I think it represents the theme of this entire album beautifully."

**superr_rad**: "I feel like this will rank low and it doesn't deserve to, but in the context of the other songs in this rate it just doesn't hold up heh"

**soeri**: "I think most people hate this song because its 'boring', but I disagree. It's a nice relaxing song between the high energy A-Yo and John Wayne, which I've come to appreciate"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Kind of a standard acoustic ballad, her vocals on the hook sound pitchy to me"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "The emotional centre of Joanne and the titular track, it was good, it was raw but sometimes Gagas drawl gets too much for me"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "A sweet ballad for Gaga's career"

**Yatcho**: "Actually really like this song. A really meaningful ballad given the background of the album, the one time she sounds authentic on this album."

**veryunfinished**: "this is so understated, even during the chorus when she's kind of belting."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "I thought the last line of the bridge was ‚ÄúCan't wait to see you sore‚Äù‚Äù sore‚Äù was actually ‚Äúsoar‚Äù I'm screaming #Britney‚ÄôsImpact"

**Wailordfan**: "The chorus is such a fucking earworm. I sang that song so many times the first time I heard it."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I know a lot of people love this track, but for me, as a title track, and sandwiched between two strong tracks, it falls a little flat."

**qetaz**: "It's a really touching song. The ‚Äúwhere do you think you‚Äôre going‚Äù lyric gives me goose bumps."

**Reifiui**: "I didn't remember this song from my first listen of the album and I'm wondering if I was deaf until today all this time now"

**femaleghostbuster**: "Gorgeous, heartbreaking lyrics"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Not particularly interesting, kind of cringe inducing at some parts. be less clich√©, please."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "getting an extra .5 bc feels"

**blue_charles**: "Kinda weak song with a strong emotional core that salvages it. Great delivery from Gaga, you can hear her struggling to keep her voice from breaking."

**eklxtreme**: "the folky americana instrumentation complements her flawless vocals, very sweet ballad"

**SkyBlade79**: "Even though I enjoy this song to a certain extent, it has that niche country/folk feel that some Gaga fans might not appreciate, and there really aren't any highs in this song, mostly lows."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "I like the hook, and that‚Äôs kinda it. Scratch that, I love the hook. I‚Äôve now converted into a Country Lady Gaga fan."

**Zugtris**: "impeccable"

**misguidedzombie**: "Beautiful song and easily some of her best vocals on the album."

**Therokinrolla**: "Is it the weakest ballad on the album? Yes. Is it an atmospheric track that features Gaga pleading and begging her aunt Joanne to not pass away, even though she knows, ‚ÄúThings don‚Äôt work out that way?‚Äù Yes. This is Gaga at her most vulnerable and this may be a side of Gaga we don‚Äôt see for a while. It‚Äôs beautiful and touching and always sounds like such a heartfelt from Gaga."

**huntyphobic**: "I know y‚Äôall will roast the shit out of this song but it‚Äôs actually so good and cute pls be kind to it"

**ExtraEater** has a "Serious Comment/Writeup": "This is by far my favorite song on Joanne. It is a raw, emotional ballad that works well to document her experience with her aunt's death. This song also comes off as an attempt by Lady Gaga to separate herself from her 'Lady Gaga' title for just a moment, both stylistically, structurally, and in name. I guess this will be eliminated early on a day I can't be here, so I really want to say how good this song is despite its difference to the rest of the album. It may be a boring ballad to everyone else, but this song is a wonderful departure from the rest of her style and a mark of Gaga/Joanne's growth personally. And I guess if you say 'Yes, I know it's an emotional ballad with a backstory, but she could have done it in a much better way', I can't argue with that, but just consider the meaning of the placement of this song in such a maximalist, electric (sometimes) album and discography. I couldn't give this my eleven, but I better see some up there when this gets revealed."

**snidelaughter** follows up with a deep and thorough analysis: "It's a sad song." Indeed.

Average: 6.755
Controversy: 2.2173
My Rating: 4

Highest Scores: (10 x2): ImADudeDuh, Therokinrolla (9 x4): skiddos, bluehxrizon, alternativeoxygen, enecks

Lowest Scores: (0 x2): cabblue, gannade (4 x2): ExtraEater, NapsAndNetflix

‚Äúi do NOOOOT like its final evolution, it's way less cute than it should be.‚Äù ~estreindre, with the truth

‚ÄúI'd like it more if it weren't for red fluff in the ears and the weird wizard evolution.‚Äù ~TeamAwesome4

‚Äúthat final evolution is absolute trash lmfao‚Äù ~gannade

‚Äúif you picked this one as your starter i'm sorry‚Äù ~batmanji, who gave it a 10, anyway

Naps finds the fox ‚Äúirrelevant and not worthy of a comment‚Äù. Well, you can say that again.

*No real writeup here bc Fennekin is irrelevant and boring*
