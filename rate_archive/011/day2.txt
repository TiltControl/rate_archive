The Ultimate 2016 Album Rate, Day 2: Take Your Seat Now...
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5s1rn8/the_ultimate_2016_album_rate_day_2_take_your_seat/

We're back! Yes I used a line from Private Show for the title. Here's the same notes from yesterday:

* Follow along in the plug.dj! The link is [here](https://plug.dj/popheads/) if you've never been there. I'll be revealing songs there shortly before I post them here.

* I will start revealing songs at around 1:30pm EST. We'll begin with some bonus tracks before going on to the actual songs. I'm going from #30 to #11 today.

* I've included nearly everyone's comments, and I did my best to go through them and add cheeky responses and whatnot (please don't take them seriously). I wasn't able to do it for all of them though, and for that I apologize, but in my defense I didn't have much time to do the writeups.

* Controversy is a measure of how much voters disagreed. Think of it as an average of the differences between all of the scores. The average controversy was a 2.2, so anything above a 2.4 should be considered controversial.

* The average overall score was 7.1.

* I'll also be revealing the total points each song got. This is just a sum of everyone's scores (so it's equal to the average multiplied by the number of participants). I think this will be a good way of seeing how close some of these songs were.

* I'll also be revealing everyone's scores for every song, so none of you are safe from being exposed hihi.

And here's a recap of what's left:

Too on the nose about nothing in particular. I know that's a bit of an oxymoron, but let me explain: I was always bothered by the fact that this is explicitly about America and obviously about hardships and racial injustice and stuff but it never really *says* that stuff explciitly. The music video helps in that department, but we're rating songs here. Also there's that weird washing machine noise that starts up after the opening chorus and I hate it.

**skiddos**: "a lil too long, but not too shabby"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this should have been in the album"

**superr_rad**: "I wish this was more controversial and had more radical statements but it'll do."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Pretty good and I can feel the emotion, but the song goes on a bit too long and the Alex da Kid dubstep elements are kind of a dated sound especially for a song that came out in 2015."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Don't have much to say here, just know this is a quality Rih Rih track"

**bliamc**: "I like the lyrical ideas, but the melody and instrumental is just so boring"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "OH MY GOD RIRI THIS IS SO BORING. Hot take: New Americana is better."

**Death_Soup**: "Actually a very pretty song"

**Wailordfan**: "Messy"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's understandable why this was cut, because it's less hip-hop heavy than some of the other tracks. It's still dark, and has a great instrumental, so it still marks a slight departure from Rihanna's earlier work. The lyrical subject matter manages to be depe, but not psuedo-intellectual most of the time, and it's nice to hear her sing about something different."

**SkyBlade79**: "Pretty good for a political song. It was a bit ahead of it’s time and I enjoy teh production."

Genuinely have no idea why she bothered to include this in the album. Like it can be cool to hear early demos of songs but this doesn't sound...that different from the current one imo. Oh well, at least we got bonus tracks this time around. Remember when ARTPOP didn't have any?

On a song that relishes in big choruses and loudness, this is a standout purely based on how subdued it is. It doesn't sound wholly sexual, even though the title definitely wants you to substitute 'Luv' with a different word. A bit forgettable, and I would gladly swap it with 'If I'm Dancing' in the top 30, but I can't be too mad.

---

**BionicFunhouse**: "It’s better than the others, I actually kind of like it."

**melisanyans**: "Eh"

**skiddos**: "Cashmere Cat and co. did a phenomenal job with this one. A+ production and execution"

**Macubass**: "great but could be better"

**mokitsu**: "AGAIN I loooove the production and Britney's vocal delivery, especially in the chorus, it gets so hazy and hypnotic, it's sexy without trying!"

**MrSwearword**: "Subtle Britney vocals that don’t demand that much work. The beat does get boring as fuck though."

**dirdbub**: "was this supposed to be a comeback album? why is it so boring?"

**JunkyGS**: "the vocals are nice & overall the song is pleasant sounding but the song is very simple."

**MihaMijat**: "It's a grower"

**enecks**: "Weak"

**estreindre**: "aaand here we go, right back to the mediocre sex songs."

**omgcow**: "I like this one, but it feels like a Selena Gomez song. But it picks up for me starting towards the end when she sings “Oh no I won’t/I promise I promise” so I listen to it all the way through just for that moment."

**calltehshots**: "One of the best songs of the album"

**eribertknows**: "I fuck with this but the lyrics are mediocre."

**Palutzel**: "such a generic pop song.. it's just unoriginal and boring, like every justin bieber song from Purpose"

**TonyRealm**: "It’s not bad, but it doesn't stand out. The beat (which reminds me of a subdued version of Justin Bieber’s “I’ll Show You”), Britney’s whispery vocal delivery, it’s all a bit dull. Although Britney’s moans, Lord have mercy."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "One of wayyy too many low key synth-y songs on this album."

**havanabrown**: "Yawn...if anyone knows how to feel detached and give no emotion in their singing it’s Britney. Normally the beat salvages the quality of her songs but clearly not in this case"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Kinda generic but far from bad"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Have I mentioned how much"

**bliamc**: "Boring, sounds like a cheap knockoff of Good for You."

**NapsAndNetflix**: "This was too long"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The song is nice but Britney's vocals are a bit boring here."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i like the whisper aesthetic, and the chorus hits gently but memorably"

**Death_Soup**: "All around a pretty decent song."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I would really love this song if like, Tove Lo sang it tbh"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "relatable queen"

**Wailordfan**: "Kinda boring."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Cashmere Cat! I've been loving this guy's pop production for a while, and his style really fits Britney. The vocals in particular are a bit subdued, which makes the song a little flat for me."

**qetaz**: "continuing the trend of the album... There's nothing in this song I'd really point to and say “that's bad” (except the stupid spelling of the title...) but I'm having an equally hard time finding anything that stands out as particularly good"

**Reifiui**: "The album would have been a lot better with more tracks like this one and Do You Wanna Come Over?"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Man I just wish she would actually sing on this track instead of selana-ing because the production is fire."

**SkyBlade79**: "Trop pop? Really? The whole song just feels like a buildup, but it never actually delivers on that."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "meh"

**Therokinrolla**: "Just a really bland pop song with a cliché title."

**SpanKKy1**: "My ode to Shawn Mendes"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is the best song in the album tied with the one above."

**leviOHsa**: "This is pretty cool, her voice sounds less processed on this, it’s nice."

**JohnnyToby**: "It’s like trying to be a Selena Godmez song but 10x more boring and not sexy"

**blue_charles**: "Good, but bland"

**eklxtreme**: "very catchy and nice fresh production"

**joshually**: "This is probably the sexiest song about vulnerability and opening up ever recorded and Britney shows us again that this album is more than meets the eye."

**snidelaughter**: "This is Weeknd influenced."

**Willybae00**: "This song perfectly combines vulnerability with sexiness, which is exactly what us Knee stans needed after Femme Fatale + BJ. I like listening to this song whenever I feel lonely or emotional because I can relate to it. I think this is a great song for an introvert (just) like me"

**twat_brained**: "I must say, Knee makes trop pop sound really good!"

I kind of just think of this song as a meme now (I love playing its absolutely terrible music video in the plug and insisting that it's eventually going to smash the charts lmao) but aside from all of that, it's honestly quite pleasent to listen to even if I think it's a bit boring. This was in the bottom 10 at first, and I was shook when it somehow made it to the top 30 tbh. Although all of the 0-givers pretty much came at the beginning, so it was going to start off much lower than expected.

---

I think the most interesting part of the comments were the ones that picked up on the religious themes and found them deeply relatable. Here they are:

**soeri**: "Okay, as a love song this is kinda boring. But if you see it from the perspective I do, which is Gaga struggling with her faith, begging her god to give her a reason to keep believing in him... you'll get why I adore this song. That especially resonates with me since I used to be super religious."

**Therokinrolla**: "Why does this song get my 11? A ballad? Its not very pop-y. Gaga gets super country this time around, but it so works. Its a flawless track, the repetition of Million Reasons sets the tone, the chorus explodes in a way not many ballads do, and I think the bridge is one of the more excellent bridges from any album this year. And what the song is about connects to me just more than just about any song. I like to believe this is Gaga singing about her religion, how she prays and hopes that somewhere out there there is a God, and that there is a heaven, and yet, with the way everything happens around her, death and poverty and hate, it is hard to “keep the faith.” Basically, the past few years of my life have placed me in a religious crisis, because the only reason I try to believe in God is because I want there to be, even if I know I’m being delusional. And Gaga is singing about sorta the same idea. She wants to believe all she can, but it doesn’t work. “When I Bow Down to pray, I try to make the worst seem better,” is saying that when tough shit happens, she will pray, like a lot of people, but the key word is try. It never works. And during the bridge, “Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith,” she is saying that through all the shit she’s been through in her own life, and then seeing stories on the news about children being kidnapped and tortured,- watching innocent people die everyday, how can she believe that there is a God? “But baby I just need one good one to stay.” She hasn’t found that one reason. As much as she wants it and needs it, that reason will never come. I’m so sorry this turned into a rant, I just wanted to explain my 11 and my favorite song of 2016."

**Joebiekong**: "But baby I just need one bad one to make it a 9.9"

**eribertknows**: "This showcases Gaga's vocals better than probably any other track and it's just beautiful and I never really skip it."

**Palutzel**: "beautiful AF, amazing vocals too, it would be nice for this to get a video... a real video"

**TonyRealm**: "This song came on the radio when I was with my dad. Before Gaga reached the chorus, he had switched the station. And you wonder why I prefer Mom."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Eh"

**potrap**: "'Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith... I've got a million reasons to walk away, but baby I just need one good one to stay.' This song's lyrics take on new meaning for me in light of last year. Here's to optimism."

**havanabrown**: "at first it made me wanna weep for the husband I never had that never left me but the effect has kinda worn off now. Still, her vocals are just wowie"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "am i the only one that thinks the lyric 'But baby, I just need one good one to stay' is weird? i feel like the last 'one' shouldn't be there"

**spacebabe27**: "Okay I know that the sub generally would say this song is boring and/or bad, but it has the sound of an instant classic ballad. I don't know about you guys but I can easily see this song being part of some Lady Gaga tribute years and years down the line after she has passed and her legacy is celebrated. I don't know what it is, but this is just a timeless sounding track and I'm surprised it didn't immediately solidify her status as one of THE pop greats of our generation."

**superr_rad**: "This is a great song, lesbihonest. But if it were less repetitive I think it would be much better."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "My favorite ballad on this album, the soaring hook gives me life which makes it more disappointing how shitty the video is"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Objectively I know I should love this song but I've never been able to get into it the way I did with Diamond Heart or Joanne, guess Gaga got too country for me here"

**bliamc**: "I BOW DOWN TO PRAY, TRY TO MAKE THE WORDS SEEM BETTER, what a slow jam, Gaga sounds beautiful, lyrically great and the melody is so uplifting"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "i've got a hundred million reasons to LOVE THIS SOOOOOONG! but baby i just need one good one to replaaaaaaay"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song may be dismissed and might have its fair share of haters. But I honestly think this is one of the finest songs Gaga wrote, even though this is just a fairly simple song. The only thing that bothers me about the song is how Gaga delivered the 'It's like I stopped breathing but I am completely aware.' lyric. I really don't know how to explain that sorry lol. That and its shitty music video. This song deserves a better music video tbh."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "I don't like this type of slow, at least not from gaga, but it's still better than anti"

**Death_Soup**: "Verses are really annoying but the chorus is great."

**tiltheendoftheline**: "It's nice but it gets old fast."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Trash"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "worst song of all of them on any album. Boring boring boring, terrible terrible terrible."

**mother_rucker**: "I am usually very okay with repetition in songs, but the phrase “million reasons” sounds very awkward when repeated over and over again."

**Wailordfan**: "For such a repetitive ballad, it actually isn't bad, but she needed a more redeeming second single."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I didn't really think this track would grow on me, but it certainly did. It's possibly the strongest ballad on the album, and everything from the lyrics to the slower instrumental really help the song to be as powerful as it is."

**qetaz**: "this is one of those songs I feel I should like more than I do"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE THIS A SINGLE it is worse than perfect floplusion."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "Would’ve given it an 8 but it always came on when I was running and it’s an anti-running song so let me be petty"

**SkyBlade79**: "This song seems less country than Joanne, for instance, but it still has those key influences that ties it into the rest of the album. Hillary Lindsey's songwriting is apparent and admirable on this song; 'Million Reasons' is just one of those songs that makes you sit back and think about life after listening to it in the right mood."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Bad."

**SpanKKy1**: "I only like this ironically because /u/gannade hopelessly promotes it"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I'm a gay Episcopalian, so I dig this song."

**leviOHsa**: "It’s okay. But like, pretty boring. But not the worst. Ya feel me?"

**JohnnyToby**: "beautiful"

**blue_charles**: "We know Gaga can do a ballad, and Million Reasons just stands as another testament to her skill, but other than that, it's pretty basic."

**VioletChutzkee**: "At first I thought this was really basic, but it's actually lovely in its simplicity. This would probably be a 9-10 for me if sung by someone (i.e. not Gaga) who can actually reach me emotionally."

**eklxtreme**: "the high notes in the chorus are the best part, the melody is beautiful"

**joshually**: "The only redemption of Joanne. The perfect union of Hillary Lindsay's whitebread woes, Mark Ronson's modern take on vintage, Bloodpop's trendy sensibilities, throupled with Piano Gaga at her best, and that mournful major key pop melody is what it's all about and she delivered."

**snidelaughter**: "This is the one good one to stay."

**Yatcho**: "A little on the generic side but its still a really strong vocal performance carrying this to a higher level"

**veryunfinished**: "this is a nice ballad."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "I could make a some sort of shady million ____s joke here but the song is already a huge joke in the first place so I think I’ll be okay"

**twat_brained**: "This shouldn’t have been a single, but it’s humbling to see gaga"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Slayed"

**ExtraEater** loves memes: "The Wild & Wacky Misadventures of Stefani Germanotta; Lady Gaga was in the studio, on break, listening to Million Reasons. 'aw yeah, you're givin' me a million reasons to let ya go--come on now guys!' Her coworkers groaned. 'It's not that good, girl.' Gaga pouted. 'I'll show you what's a good song!' She went back home and opened her magic book. 'Magic Book, take me to a place where Million Reasons is not a flop.' The magic book was like, 'Ugh, will I have to create another non-existent universe?' 'JUST DO IT!' The book went to work, and transported her to a world where Million Reasons wasn't a flop. It was a magical place with cupcakkes on trees and peace around the world. Lady gaga said, 'yay!' and she quickly searched up the billboard stats. Every song from Joanne was on the Hot 100! shoouk!!! and below that, every song from Artpop! but what was this??? below there was one song at #100, called Clores, by the Nonsneppeopww0ers ft. Chvrches. she set out on a journey to defeat the beast that was Nonsneppeopww0ers ft. Chvrches. but no, it was too powerful! it was a nice mix of trop pop and synthpop and gaga was almsot dead! and then ariana prande came in on a shining leona lewis. 'yes, i shall save you from this beast' she sang an extended 10-minute remix of Greedy in which she raises the key every cycle. The Nonsneppeopww0ers ft. Chvrches were defeated, not bc it killed them, but bc they decided to copy ari's style only for critics to call foul. riperoni....... anyway, gaga went back to her studio and found that her coworkers were crying. turns out million reasons finally broke through to them 'just another day' gaga said, and she jumped out the window in a cool fashion the end and this is lowkey a parody of popheads' fuckin oversneanolsnaization of everything i mean wtf we get it with the circeljerking ok buy eomtion and collar by The Nonsneppeopww0ers ft. chvrches on google play music bass makes asshole shiver EAT RAW EGGSE bye bethany xoxo"

deleted: In all seriousness, the very last line in the chorus makes the meaning very debatable. I love /u/rockinrolla's explanation, but I see the "reason to stay" line means she is still hopeful, and can take a good thing and give herself hope because of it. 

I am religious, and don't think Gaga is losing faith, and I like to imagine that having the priest in the music video seeing her kinda backs the idea that she is open and not in despair about religion, but is hopeful instead.

This. Fucking. BOP! Take me back to the 2000s Britney, both sonically and thematically, and release this as your big 'fuck you' anthem to JT. I'm just kind of joking, but really I love everything about this song and its throwback sound. Esp. that weird harmonica thing that pervades the entire song.

---


**BionicFunhouse** is making horrible comments again: "Aaaaaaaand she sounds horrible again."

**skiddos**: "YES EXPOSE HIM"

**Macubass**: "justin timberlake who?"

**mokitsu**: "This isn't a bad song but something about it doesn't sound right to me!"

**MrSwearword**: "I’m almost certain the first verse and the last 2 lines from the 2nd verse are scraps from a Rihanna album from Talk That Talk to Unapologetic. However, this is legitimately edgy for Britney."

**dirdbub**: "that was good. don’t know what else to say about it other than it was good"

**JunkyGS**: "at this point im forced to ask who the fuck picks which songs make deluxe & normal and how they have a job. Actually frustrating to know how much better this album could have done & been received if they traded some of the bonus tracks with normal album cuts."

**MihaMijat**: "This is such a good fuck you track, and I actually love JT"

**enecks**: "What the fuck is that grunting sound?" IT'S HER NATURAL VOICE

**estreindre**: "tbh this song isn't great, but i'm rating it higher than it deserves just because i love the fact that she actually sounds like she's trying in this song haha. plus i like the chorus, even if the pre-chorus is preeetty bad." You're pretty bad >:(

**omgcow**: "I love this so much, it feels like classic Britney and I love wild west vibe, I picture her walking into an old saloon ready to fuck a bitch up."

**calltehshots**: "Drag JT sis"

**Palutzel**: "this sounds very britney and it's a very good thing, this is quality pop"

**TonyRealm**: "Guttural backing vocals, dirty horn, deep bass, tribal-like drums, shade-filled lyrics, energetic vocals from Britney, danceable yet meaningful, this is easily one of my favourites. I’m gonna cry if this is eliminated early."

**banananaise**: "I would be a liar if I said that that country harmonica in a dance-pop song was acceptable"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "FInally, a song with impact."

**havanabrown**: "pretty good pretty good"

**spacebabe27**: "Kind of aggressive for a Britney song and I'm here for it."

**soeri** is looking in the mirror: "trash"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Kind of a nice groovy track, nothing special"

**bliamc**: "Sassy, loud and brash. There’s so much more attitude here than most other Britney songs"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "the production in the chorus is too grating for me"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "yas godney burn the haters"

**Nerdy_boy_chris** is still an Ed Sheeran stan: "Unremarkable"

**mother_rucker**: "Britney brings it with the chorus! The “cry, cry, cry” line was sung very similarly to her line in the “Lucky” chorus."

**Wailordfan**: "Not bad, but could've been better in retrospect, throwing a harmonica in there really doesn't mesh well with the song." This harmonicaphobia...

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Holy hell, this beat is wild. Wtf is with these bonus tracks so far, they should've all made the album. One of the strongest choruses on the whole project."

**Reifiui** just throws his album review here: "I don't have much to say for this track so I'm going to put my comment on the album here: It was better than I expected! Sure there's some pretty bad duds here and there but the decent tracks outnumbered them, the biggest issue I have with the album overall is the production, Britney could have gotten a great comeback if her producers gave her actually good material, you can see her try really hard to make some of these songs work sometimes even when she doesn't have much to work with, unfortunately"

**angusaditus**: "waited 15 years for this clap back and it was so worth it"

**femaleghostbuster**: "Dated, but in the best way"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Well I ain't calling you a truther!"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "I just love this song I love how relatable it is, I just wish her vocals were stronger when she sings LIARRRRRRRRRRRRR"

**chihuahuazero**: "Even I’ll acknowledge that this should’ve been on the main album."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "better one"

**Zugtris**: "bop"

**Therokinrolla**: "The best song on Glor by far. It sounds like something Britney bitch would make pre-2010 and its chorus is pure bliss, with a lovely prechorus leading into it. this would be the only Britney song i’d be okay with being #1"

**huntyphobic**: "If Britney was going to use a song as a clap-back towards Justin, did she not think to use a song that is actually good?"

**leviOHsa**: "Hated this. I can’t even comment further."

**JohnnyToby**: "generic". Like this comment?

**blue_charles**: "Ngl I live for songs that call out ex's, and the malice that runs under the surface of this song from the very first notes gives me LIFE. The build into the chorus makes me feel like a strong independent woman. There, I said it."

**eklxtreme** just wants to wild out: "why does this remind me of the teach me how to dougie instrumental"

**joshually**: "This could've been the first single, and then a remix with Carrie or Taylor or Shania or Faith (at this point I'm just naming whatever white country pop girl I know) would have literally killed the entire bible belt."

**snidelaughter**: "Whelp, the bonus tracks are better than half of the album."

**veryunfinished**: "the prechorus works, but then the chorus is kind of a letdown. she sounds kind of like she’s in a hair metal band when she sings liar."

**twat_brained** is a feminist: "Well, since Justin is too petty to leave their relationship in the past, what’s stopping Brit from doing the same?" #Equality

deleted: fine. it's the fact that her meltdown should have been the end of her career. not one single of hers since has been anything beyond total shit. at this point she's just the appointed queen of the gay and drag community, simply by default for some reason. that's her only relevance beyond 2005.

yes, she was incredible in her early days, and stronger is one of the best pop songs i've ever heard. but the fact that a pop star with little to no vocal talent who's barely able to move anymore still gets the love and devotion that she does is a blemish on the music industry.

Another trashy bop that somehow manages to out-trash Pose, and also be kind of good? Like those lines about being saucey or something are so good. I didn't expect this to make it so far since it's a Rihanna bonus track (and it got kicked out at the bottom in the popjustice rate) so this is neat. Whenever I hear this song I think about someone's post in the Rihanna roast thread going like "if you have to say sex with you is amazing it probably isn't" and I giggle. Also, do you remember when The Fader [claimed this was the #1 best song of 2016?](http://www.thefader.com/2016/12/13/best-songs-of-2016-playlist) Never forget.

**mgglite**: "riri comes off as a bit...desperate in this"

**JamesTheGent**: "This song is soo a-ma-zing."

**dirdbub** picks on Anti's best bonus track for whatever reason: "way to close out the Deluxe version with such a boring album :("

**JunkyGS**: "So happy whenever I hear this on the radio. It is classic Rihanna; catchy beat, confidence and is such a fun song to sing along with."

**MihaMijat**: "Kinda overrated but still a good song"

**enecks**: "I don’t like the beat, but everything else is OK."

**omgcow**: "This is the closest thing to the Bitch Better Have My Money vibe I desperately wanted from this album"

**calltehshots**: "YOU KNOW I GOT THE SAUCE YOU KNOW IM SAUCEEEEYYYYY"

**Palutzel**: "ugh, I really don't feel this album"

**TonyRealm**: "not to this song riri"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Better than title would suggest, but getting a headache from listening to the over-autotuned mess isn’t exactly sexy."

**havanabrown**: "Pretty solid closing track, the beat's good and the chorus is catchy"

**arandomgiraffe**: "yikes"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "is no an emotion bc i feel it"

**spacebabe27**: "Kind of a bop, kinda meh."

**superr_rad**: "could be better"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I love her vocals on this and the beat is like Hotline Bling but trappy, it’s cool"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "It actually has a nice chill rhythm to such a raunchy song, I love it"

**bliamc**: "Loud and dumb but still pretty fun"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "the opening makes me feel like a mermaid azealia is shook"

**Awhile2**: "Had Rihanna replaced the four weakest songs on the regular album and replaced them these bonus tracks and BBHM, itd be my AOTY for sure"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "It's so nice of Rihanna to do a homage to the Queen of Sex, CupcakKe!"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i'm convinced the only reason the deluxe edition isn't in the bonus tracks is to force me to rate it. surprisingly, this one song resonated with me. are we done now though?"

**Death_Soup**: "Definitely a grower. Not her best or worst"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**'s gay ass is thriving: "my gay ass is thriving."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "how the FUCK was this deluxe only?!"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "my 2016 thot anthem"

**Wailordfan**: "Ew. If you need to hype up your pussy you have other issues to deal with."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I'm not really a fan of the chorus, it just seems a little bold for the sake of being bold, and the vocal performance doesn't really justify the ridiculous lyrics. There's a nice little synth in the background that's pretty high-pitched that I like a lot."

**angusaditus**: "my anthem tbh"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "A fun song to end a really personal and generally not happy album? who would've thunk it."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "honestly wish she’d cut the last three songs and finished with close to you bc these ones are doing nothing for me, even though they’re not bad"

**SkyBlade79**: "Not feeling it. She’s trying too hard in this one, with the instagram line and all that."

**snidelaughter**: "Ah, the weird non-single that keeps randomly charting for some reason. Whelp, cocky Rihanna is always a good thing, so that's nice."

**Yatcho**: "Best bonus song, this couldve easily been on the album proper. Only Rihanna could pull off 'sex with me so amazing' as the chorus and have me fully believing it."

**veryunfinished**: "wow who'd've thought"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "@azealiabanks Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation #stayawayfromthechickens #iheartnuggets #saveourhens"

**twat_brained**: "This record straddles the razor-thin line between the right amount of pitch correction and brilliant production. While it sacrifices lyrical integrity, this is the perfect way to close out an album."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Eh"

**Therokinrolla**: "Feels like a standard edition track, an above average one at that. Also the idea of telling a dude “My sex is the best, hoe” is hilarious"

**huntyphobic**: "Rih continuing to make my bussy shook oh lawd"

**SpanKKy1** describes his relationship with Shawn: "This is sexual harassment"

**leviOHsa**: "At least she closed the album on a good note. This song is pretty cool."

**alternativeoxygen**: "throwback to that time when Rihanna was just a singles artist."

**JohnnyToby**: "ok great song but what exactly does 5 fingers on it mean ._. also Lia Marie’s impact"

**seferre2**: "ok ok guilty pleasure"

**blue_charles**: "I laughed the first time I heard that the very first line is 'Sex with me is so amazing.' It's... to the point, isn't it?"

**eklxtreme**: "this really slaps but I can't get over how simple the lyrics are"

**joshually** closes us off with some health care advice: "Shes all 'it's always wet' so I implore you, Robyn Fenty, get thee to a gyno appointment ASAP. You could have a yeast infection or ruptured ovarian cysts or a UTI. Safety first!"

so i guesssss you can blame me for anti not doing well if you want? i didn't give it my zero though, and it still had like a 7 average from me overall lmao

---

It's too underwhelming for me. Like, it's cute and #feminist and stuff, but I feel like a collaboration between Gaga and Florence should have more gravitas to it than this does. They do sound great together, and the message of the song is great, but as a song it just feels limp. 

---

Now, let's see which troll gave this a 0...wait, what? It's **superr_rad**?: "This is one of my biggest disappointments of the year. Two powerhouse pop stars that share feminist ideas and they produce this watered down boring shit. Yeah I'm salty about it". Harsh!

**VodkaInsipido**: "The harp is beautiful, the synths are on point, and none of both singers outshine the other. I wouldn't mind these two doing a Telephone-esque video tbh."

**melisanyans**: "A bright spot in an otherwise dire second half."

**joshually** is even meaner than superr_rad: "Literally the worst song out of the four albums. These two hussies sound like they have never in their lives experienced human connections, the chemistry is so lacking. Their enunciations of the world sound so false and forced. Atrocious. Unlistenable. Cringey in the worst possible way."

**snidelaughter**: "These singers sure are great gal pals! Nah but this is a genuinely great song with a great sample and a great message."

**Yatcho**: "I can see the appeal but this cheesy 70s empowerment duet is NOT for me at all"

**veryunfinished** identifies the singer on the album: "florence!"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD** has bad memories on Anti: "Thank god someone rescued Florence from the Goodnight Gotham torture session!"

**twat_brained**: "I understand what it’s going for, but I feel like the message of female empowerment falls a bit flat unfortunately."

**skiddos**: "Gaga and Florence have very different voices, but the song still works out pretty well."

**mokitsu**: "On the only song of the album that isn't downright bad Gaga sings about ~girl power!~ without sounding too cringy. The synths are incredible and Florence gives Gaga a run for her money!"

**Rourke_** has traumatic memories of Perfect Illusion: "Her vocals sound off on this. better than LAAAAAHV but that's beside the point."

**MrSwearword**: "I wish this was more “Sweet Nothing” and less this, but I’m not knocking Florence contributions at all."

**jackcs903**: "This needs to be released as a single and given proper promotion ffs"

**chubs4life**: "This needs to be performed at the Grammy's and it will give me so much life the cereal would be jealous."

**holly_foxxy**: "i LOVE this song i s2g it's so cinematic, it's out of a musical or something"

**dirdbub**: "I love Florence’s part on this"

**JunkyGS**: "Florence makes every song better. This song has a good message without being cliche."

**MihaMijat**: "I was not expecting Florence, I was shook once again"

**enecks**: "I would’ve given a 9, but it seems too similar to Bennie and the Jets. Florence was good in it though (it’s nice to see her doing something better than subpar Final Fantasy tracks)"

**estreindre**: "i don't know this song is just... kiiind of a snooze fest imho? i also don't like florence and the machine, so that may be why this song doesn't do it for me, but still."

**omgcow**: "This is so damn boring and it never picks up. I thought to myself, surely this is all building to something, right? Then it ended. Disappointing use of Florence."

**calltehshots**: "tbh thought this was really cheesy but then the verse about not being able to find a cab while being drunk down the Bowery on 4am hit and I’m like omg sis I’ve been there I feel you I get it"

**Palutzel**: "the synths are crazy good and their voices work so well together, but it's a bit too monotonous for me"

**TonyRealm**: "I thought this collab would be a disaster, but it’s actually pretty neat. They have really distinct voices, which works nicely on a song about supporting each other. The production might not be everyone’s cup of tea but I think they made some inventive choices (I mean, they even got a harp)."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Awesome duet, but the kinda screechy, draggy synths after the chorus knocks it down,"

**havanabrown**: "TBH would’ve preferred it if it was only Florence singing this tbh"

**spacebabe27**: "Their voices mesh so well together, this is one of the most effortless listens out of this entire rate."

**soeri**: "i didnt know you could fit a lesbian song on a christian album but bitch did"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The synths are nice but I don’t know how well the two voices fit together, it lowkey sounds like a mashup"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Another standout track, I hope Gaga doesn't let it fade into the background and actually promotes it, because this duet was KILLER"

**jamesfog**: "Elton John did it better"

**bliamc**: "I really like this, especially the synths, but they don’t really mesh well with Florence’s voice (I love her voice, just not for this song)"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "MY FAVORITE GAGA SONG TBH! THE RETRO PRODUCTION! FLORENCE! THE THEME OF SUPPORTING YOUR SIS! THE HEAVENLY BRIDGE!"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I originally heard there was a “Flo” collab on this album and I was like swerve a Flo Rida collab obvs this will be amazing since he puts out banger after banger so this was disappointing"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I am living for this 70s vibe of the song mixed with pro-feminism messages!!!! Queens of feminism!"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "sweet country duet, not my taste though"

**triptoyourheart**: "Florence alone makes this one a 10. A real highlight on Joanne."

**Death_Soup**: "Damn this is good. Reminds me of Benny and the Jets lol"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Honestly, I don't like Florence + The Machine, so this just irks my soul"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "For such a collaboration, I expected a better song but I just ended up being disappointed and Florence does not fit in this song vocally, she sounds uncomfortable."

**mother_rucker**: "I adore the message, but I’m not a fan of the instrumentals. It sounds like a washed out, boring “Bennie and the Jets”"

**Wailordfan**: "I don't love it. Their voices are great, but the song isn't great."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I had high hopes for a Florence x Gaga track, and this lived up to my expectations and surprised me. The synthy instrumental is reminiscent out of something that Sylvan Esso would make if they did something more 70s/80s styled. The duet is great as expected, and Florence has cemented herself as the chosen one. After all her dance features, it's obvious she could sing over anything."

**qetaz**: "I love Florence, so having her on the track is instant bonus points. I also like the girl power friendship described in the lyrics"

**Reifiui**: "That's the kind of collaboration that should be ORGASMIC... I don't know why it doesn't click with me that much"

**angusaditus**: "Florence is here to save the album, what a blessing"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "It's like a bad mix of good things. The pickle ice cream of pop music."

**SkyBlade79**: "This is a smooth and jazzy pop song about growing into early womanhood. It's the highly anticipated feature with Florence Welch that we heard about, and though I think that it could be better, I'm satisfied for the most part. Welch's voice seems to outshine Gaga's on this one; her voice is just more silky-smooth, like the instrumental. However, I think that it's fair to say that overall, Gaga and Welch have great chemistry and their two voices work better for the subject matter of this track"

**chihuahuazero**: "Even though I’m a F+TM fan, I can admit that Florence Welch can be overwrought with her vocals at times. This is one of those moments. However, the girl power duet is endearing."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Florence is the best."

I love the duet; that FloWelch is less of a “featured” artist and more so a critical piece of the track. The synths accompany this track so well, and the two just complement each other so well."

DAE TAME IMPALA??? The song's okay. I was surprised to see people guess that this would make the top 10.

---

Can someone tell me whose song this is?

**ExtraEater**: "Obligatory Tame Impala comment"

**BionicFunhouse**: "I’m a sucker for Tame Impala"

**jamesfog**: "Just as good as Tame Impala"

**dirdbub**: "such an awesome Tame Impala cover"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Not quite as good as the Tame Impala version but still a great cover. I really want more of this sound out of Rihanna now, full length Rih x Kevin collab now"

**Macubass**: "basically stole a tame impala song, lazy af"

**mokitsu**: "A cover/rip off! The production is insane but I seem to enjoy Rihanna's higher register in the bridge over Kevin Parker's."

**VodkaInsipido**: "Tame Impala who? On a more serious note, when you think the song just ended because it's Rihanna and she isn't used to long songs 'because she is a popstar' the best part comes."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "I like the Tame Impala version better, but I still like this one."

**twat_brained**: "Tame Impala who? Jk but I don't even care that it's 6:34; it's future funk meets alternative meets R&B… and I am here for it ALL"

**omgcow**: "I guess this is a cover? I don’t know what a Tame Impala is. Either way it’s too long"

**eribertknows**: "Not as good as Tame Impala but probably as close as one could get."

**potrap**: "I am impressed by the audacity of Rihanna to make her most artistic, personal album to date, and include a straight karaoke cover of an Australian rock band."

**Reifiui**: "Rihanna snatching the indie crowd by making a Tame Impala song better just by making her the singer"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "So Rihanna found the copy and paste button? Shook!!!!!! Joking aside, this is a good cover and it makes sense for Rihanna to add this in the context of ANTI."

**Death_Soup**: "Really dreamy and pretty. (it is Tame Impala lol)"

**snidelaughter**: "Tame Impala did it better. There, that sums up half of the discussion of this song."

**TonyRealm**: "I personally don’t mind covers that are similar to the original. The Tame Impala production is scintillating so it sounds just as good here. Rihanna’s version even plumps up the final chorus with some additional harmonies and emphasizes certain instrumental sections. But as a whole I felt her vocals just didn’t quite mesh with the instrumental, and that ethereal quality the beat evokes doesn’t last. It’s a cool experiment but with limited payoff."

**banananaise**: "It's amazing how even Tame Impala can't resist Rihanna's ability to make everything she touches boring"

**raicicle**: "Does Kevin Parker or Rihanna do this song better? Probably Kevin Parker at the end of the day, who suits the psychedelic vibe a bit better. That said, Rihanna does the track a lot of justice."

**veryunfinished**: "when anti came out i was madly in love the original version of this song, so when i heard this, i was so disappointed. i wish she had done something more to this, because this track is akin to karaoke. i think i like kevin parker’s vocals over this song more; they stand out a little more while rihanna’s kind of meld into the beat everywhere except the chorus." Isn't Kevin Parker the guy on Perfect Illusion? What's his name doing here?

letsallpoo: **melisanyans**: "Holy crap is this boring or what?"

**skiddos**: "This is my first time listening to this song in full, and hopefully my last time as well."

**Rourke_**: "weird in the best way"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "same boring stuff for 6:30 minutes does not a good song make." "Same Boring Stuff" doesn't quite have the same ring to it.

**MrSwearword**: "BEST. TRACK. FROM. ANTI."

**mgglite**: "the mix on this sounds horrible and airy but i guess it's a stylistic choice. a stylistic choice that sucks ass but still. the song isn't good enough to let me look past it anyway"

**holly_foxxy**: "i'm so conflicted cuz i love the orginal and rih's version just seems so unnecessary like there is basically nothing original/interesting added to the song in this cover"

**JamesTheGent**: "It's a great cover but it doesn't really add anything new to the original."

**JunkyGS**: "Terrific cover and was a very pleasant surprise!"

**MihaMijat**: "What is this doing here"

**enecks**: "Too long and indulgent, but it’s good"

**calltehshots**: "She made the song better sorry2say."

**Palutzel**: "soo looong and so booring, it sounds ok, but it doesn't stand out in any way"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "The one riff gets tired after 6 and a half minutes. Also rihanna's vocals are muddied."

**havanabrown**: "I was pleasantly surprised by this considering most of the previous songs had been pretty dull"

**arandomgiraffe**: "rihanna too lazy to even find people to write songs for her"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "i almost skipped this, 6 minutes is too long, also wtf @ 3:03????"

**spacebabe27**: "Her vocals actually fit this song really well so I can't even be upset that the instrumental is the same as the original. Usually I would never enjoy a song this long but there's something interesting about this that just makes it blend seamlessly into my surroundings as if it should just constantly be playing throughout my life."

**superr_rad**: "Queen of stuffing 80 different genres in one album lol its tight"

**Lopes14**: "why is this six minutes"

**joshually**: "Ms. Frizz takes us on a fantastic drug-addled hallucinatory voyage in her magic school bus in this six minute Bowie inspired interlude."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "By all means I should dock more points because of practically nothing being changed, yet Rihanna manages to make it work so well."

**bliamc**: "I mean … it’s a nice cover?? but why is it on the album?? i could not tell you…"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "not terrible, but it's essentially rih doing karaoke"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "This was a 5 then it basically changed to a new song and I was like oh I don’t like this anymore, 4. Then it went on for what felt like 15 more minutes and it’s like ok nah docking another mark so I guess you’re a 3 now"

**Awhile2**: "I love the original but i think i love this version more, especially when Rihanna hits those high notes. it is just a little too long though for especially for an album where most of the songs are under 4 minutes."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A bit too long for me, but I love the vibe"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "Once I played this song at a party and convinced a douche that Rihanna actually wrote this song for Tame Impala and he started bumping Anti at his work lol."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "#goodnight"

**Wailordfan**: "Jesus fuck an almost 7 minute long song after a 2 minute one? Christ. I didn't realize the intro technically stopped and the first verse started. The chorus is pretty lit though. I'm getting some pretty great vibes from the chorus. MMmmmffff that break between the second verse and chorus is FUCKING WET."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I have a hard time figuring out how I feel about this song. On one hand, it's a really cool cover, with Rihanna giving a shoutout to Tame Impala, one of my favorite bands. On the other hand, almost nothing about the song is changed, and in fact, some of Kevin's vocals can still be found on the track. So, I have to give this song a low rating, because while she is just as good as Kevin on the song, considering she doesn't really even change her vocal style for the song, it feels like the bare minimum of a cover."

**qetaz**: "I feel like I should be into this. It's on the slower side but still something you can move a bit too, vaguely experimental- things I appreciate, but this is just not doing anything for me"

**femaleghostbuster**: "Better than the original!"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "There is a reason why this was the first track to trend on Spotify when the album came out."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "would’ve given it a 6 but it got too long and boring"

**SkyBlade79**: "Pretty good. It really doesn’t feel like 6 minutes long, and it’s one of the most interesting songs on the album."

**chihuahuazero**: "Shame on the producers for just ripping the instrumentals from the original, to the point of retaining some of Kevin Parker’s back vocals. Just for that, I’m giving this track a zero in the small, minor hope that it would slightly discourage this practice in future hit albums."

**misguidedzombie**: "Wish she would have done a little more with this cover than just copy it exactly."

**Therokinrolla**: "Literally amazing except for the fact that it is 2 minutes TOO LONG"

**huntyphobic**: "cute song but it has no business being 6 minutes"

**SpanKKy1**: "This went 6 minutes too long". That's longer than you would last in bed with Shawn, though.

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Drags on for a bit, but otherwise good."

**eklxtreme**: "I love her subtle reverb-y vocals mixed with the vocal and synth harmonies, definitely a vocal highlight for her, the production is better than the original"

**Yatcho**: "Yeah it's a cover nearly identical to the original but I love the song and in my opinion its even more successful with her vocals"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "'So how will I know if it's right? (Stop thinking of the only option)' the only thing I can think of when I hear this is Friday where Rebecca is trying to figure out which seat to take"

**JoshuaReddit**: "If I wanted to listen to karaoke, I would have bought a Kidz Bop album."

**leviOHsa**: "This song is far long than it should be."

**JohnnyToby**: "reminds me of like childhood videogames ear the bridge so im biased af rn"

**blue_charles**: "Hate the octave jumps. Hate. And it really overstays it's welcome at 6:37. The longer it goes on, the more I sour on it, to the point where it usually ends up skipped"

The little Japanese bonus track that could! Apparently this was left off the standard edition because DJ Mustard or someone was taking too long to finish it, so they had to pump the album out in the states and just stuck this on when it was released in Japan. Big shout out to the random twink who made a Vimeo thing for this song so people could actually listen to this and I could justify making everyone rate it. You're the real MVP.

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Why isn't this on the Standard Edition of Glory???"

**skiddos**: "She's dumb for making this a Japan-exclusive bonus track out of all choices"

**Macubass**: "such a bop, pls be a single"

**mokitsu**: "It isn't on Apple Music so it's my first time listening to it, I love it! The intrumental reminds me of Needed Me. It's so chill almost sounds like a remix of an actual song."

**MrSwearword**: "Britney vocals over a Rihanna reject? Not bad."

**jackcs903**: "It's honestly such a crime that this wasn't released in the US it would've been an incredible single"

**JamesTheGent**: "Why is the best song on Glory in a Japanese Deluxe version?"

**ProphecyPizza**: "HOW have I never heard this before????? im legit shook wtf"

**dirdbub**: "HOLY FUCK, WHY WASN’T THIS ON THE MAIN ALBUM? IT’S SO GOOD WOW"

**JunkyGS**: "Definitely should have not been a Japanese exclusive song. This is very sultry, has great genre infusing production and really sounds like what a modern Britney Spears song should sound like. I felt like the chorus could have been better."

**MihaMijat**: "Why isn't this on the album and the lead single to it?"

**enecks**: "Queen of cheap dollar store gimmicks"

**omgcow**: "THIS IS SOO GOOD It’s a fucking CRIME that this was a Japan only track. I love this so much. It’s so smooth and sexy and DJ Mustard killed the production."

**calltehshots**: "A NATIONAL TRAGEDY that this was only a bonus track in Japan."

**eribertknows**: "This isn't on the album though?"

**Palutzel**: "really meh"

**TonyRealm**: "A nice gift for the one Britney stan in Japan."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Wow an even more boring version of the rest of this boring album"

**potrap**: "This track being relegated to a Japanese bonus track was the worst thing to happen in the year of hell that was 2016."

**havanabrown**: "a more heartfelt song from Britney, was a decent pick for a closing track since it stood out from the others imo"

**superr_rad**: "OKAY HOLD ON DJ MUSTARD? THIS IS SO GOOD HOLD ON WHO DECIDED TO MAKE IT A BONUS TRACK?"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "WHY WERE YOU NOT ON THE STANDARD EDITION"

**bliamc**: "honestly not surprised she didn’t put this on the album"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Why wasn’t this on spotify with the rest of the album that’s weird you flop"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "it wasn't on spotify, so i had to watch it on vimeo. there were shirtless guys in the video. 10/10"

**Bannerww**: "I can't find this song on the album however its the best song out of all on Glory"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "This should have been on the album."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Meh"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "boring"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "more like cock ring amirite no but this is worthy of the score I'm slapping it for simply hearing B's lower vocal register despite the somewhat lazy production."

**mother_rucker**: "Why is this only on the Japanese version??? It's so good."

**Wailordfan**: "It's decent, and nice production, and I like the 'change me now', but still just average."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Why the fuck is a DJ Mustard produced banger not even on the deluxe edition? Goddamn, this song deserves to be heard. I'm glad you put it on the rate because I wouldn't have bothered to listen to it otherwise."

**Reifiui**: "Britney absolutely KILLS IT in this song with her vocals and how well produced they are, there's not much else for me to come back to unfortunately"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "My mood is kind of bad after listening to this album, what color is the mood ring supposed to show?"

**SkyBlade79**: "The lyrics are so bad, the drop follows suit, and her voice is weirder than normal"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "THIS ISN’T ON SPOTIFY SO IT’S TRASH I’m not even gonna try and find it, it gets the average run of the mill 5"

**SpanKKy1** didn't read the OP and see that I linked a video where you could watch this: "This was so hard to find poo, I had to illegally download it, you made me break the law!"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "What do Britney Spears and Carly Rae Jepsen have in common? They only release good things in Japan."

**leviOHsa**: "The production is this is pretty decent, and the lyrics aren’t awful."

**JohnnyToby**: "Feels like the best song bc it wasn’t noisy like the most"

**blue_charles**: "Still bitter about this"

**eklxtreme**: "good production and lyrics and she sings with a lot of emotion, but the song isn’t too exciting though"

**joshually**: "Why was this not on the album? It fits perfectly with the theme of Glory, that of finding Britney's true self, getting that glimpse of her real spirit and soul."

**Yatcho**: "So many forgettable songs fill this track listing I'm shocked they left Single Material as a Japan bonus? Why is the promo for this era so messy..."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Why the fuck was this not included?"

**twat_brained**: "Someone please explain to me why/how this didn’t make the final tracklist for either the standard/deluxe album but “Private Show” did? Utter travesty."

This Grindr/Tinder-inspired bop honestly deserved top 10. I love the little details, like the weird soda can sound, and even though that guy on the chorus was weird at first I got used to it. The 'uh-huh's are also amazing. Why isn't this top 10? Why are you guys allergic to fun?

---

People answering the question:

**JoeThaMo**: "Yes I do"

**skiddos**: "Straight up bop, YES I wanna come over Godney"

**MihaMijat**: "I mean I could"



**Bingcrusher**: "No"

**gannade**: "lol"

**TonyRealm**: "not if this song is playing"

**snidelaughter**: "The answer is no. The verses are actually really good, but that hook is pretty bad."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "no."

---

**NapsAndNetflix** gives us an unwelcome glimpse into his social life: "omg this is a lot of fun give me more yelling release this at a single and play this at clubs and I’ll “dance” but more likely just kind of rock and then go get another drink but at least I’ll be waiting for a drink to a good song instead of something that is not good"

**VodkaInsipido**: "Clumsy's concept but well done."

**melisanyans**: "I really think this is a standout but I don't think many people agree with me. I feel like the aggressive male vocals should be aggressive Britney vocals. But she rarely sings in a tone that isn't brooding, so that sucks. But god, if Britney shout-sang 'whatever you want'??"

**Macubass**: "in the zone teas"

**mokitsu**: "The tempo change in the pre-chorus wasn't the best idea but the rest is perfect!"

**MrSwearword**: "Damn catchy beat, but whoever the male voice saying “Whatever you want”, “Whatever you need” and “I do it” can fuck off into the sea for real. That shit got on my fucking nerves."

**chubs4life**: "Best song on the album, hands down."

**holly_foxxy**: "this is just a mess..."

**dirdbub**: "damn, that small switch-up before the second drop is awesome. love it"

**JunkyGS**: "This is fresh sounding & Bops and is just a straight up fun song. It's very flirty and fun to jam out to."

**enecks**: "I hate some of the stupid sounds in this so much."

**omgcow**: "This one is kinda polarizing among Britney stans but tbh I think it’s really fun. The guys voice during the chorus gives me Focus teas and I could do without it."

**calltehshots**: "This suffers the same problem that Focus did where the hook is mess but the whole song is still a major bop."

**Palutzel**: "wow, a song that i actually like, finally something that feels alive in this album"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "The strongest hook on the album, subliminal can openings and all."

**havanabrown**: "Another forgettable song"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "thot anthem"

**spacebabe27**: "Sounds like an attempt at Toxic 2.0."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This is like right on the edge of being a bop and being trash at the same time somehow"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I actually love the production of this song and it would've been a great choice as lead single"

**bliamc**: "So much fun"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "honestly the 2nd best thing brit has done this decade after Perfume, this is just like all of the best elements of Blackout but updated"

**Awhile2**: "theres a few songs on this album that sound like the perfect updated version of britney’s classic sound, and this is one of them"

**DrunkHurricane**: "I like the verses but that breakdown is one of the worst things I've ever heard"

**tiltheendoftheline**: "I love the sound of a soda can opening. This is so fun."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Meh"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "me @ing hoes on grindr"

**mother_rucker**: "The chorus sounds so earnest, I love it."

**Wailordfan**: "Not bad. Not amazing, but definitely a nice addition to the album."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I wasn't sold until the chorus, which is an absolute monster. That background vocalist just screaming (whatever you want/whatever you need) is just perfect."

**Reifiui**: "Make the chorus better and it would have been the PERFECT single instead of the tragic Make Me seriously this deserved so much better"

**femaleghostbuster**: "This is so fun! very In The Zone."

**Raykel**: "There's this one guy who's trying to sound louder than the rest of the group that's shouting in the chorus. Why is there always that one person?"

**TheKneesOfOurBees** is about to get banned: "Hump me. Fuck me. Daddy better make me choke (you better)."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "I just love the breathy vocals in this"

**SkyBlade79**: "I really like the samples for some reason, and the production is an absolute banger. Britney’s voice is very manageable in this one; definitely an album highlight."

**chihuahuazero**: "Is that a discount 3OH!3 in the background?"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "get this filler outta here"

**misguidedzombie**: "Bass is my favorite thing about this song."

**Therokinrolla**: "this song was almost really good but the chorus does the “Focus” thing of inserting a male vocalist for no reason and it drags this track"

**huntyphobic**: "this song is such a mess"

**SpanKKy1** says more gross shit about Shawn that I'm once again deleting.

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I like being lonely :/"

**raicicle**: "This album is really carried by its production. Every element of this song is mixed flawlessly, and is super interesting. I especially like the little soda can pop tab sounds that function as weird hi-hats."

**leviOHsa**: "This song was is an absolute mess. What is going on?!?!?! I’m so confused. If they removed the guitar, it would have been 10x better (still not good though)."

**JohnnyToby**: "I see what this could’ve been but it’s just noise sometimes " 

**blue_charles**: "I liked this a lot more when it first came out, but I've seriously cooled on it since."

**eklxtreme**: "that guitar strumming works so well with the synthy production, i can jam to this"

**joshually**: "Such an innocent song about friendship, generosity and sharing. Britney is literally a Care Bear Cousin."

**Yatcho**: "This is like an good early Britney song updated with modern production. One of the most purely fun songs in this rate"

**veryunfinished**: "why does it sound like someone is opening a soda can in the beat? i like it though. the shouting in the chorus actually works."

**Willybae00**: "I have mixed feelings about this song, sometimes I want to jam to it but sometimes I straight out want to skip it"

**twat_brained**: "YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I MISSED THIS BRITNEY!!"

And **ImADudeDuh** has never used Tinder: "I've never had a song make me physically uncomfortable before"

I remember when this was first released and everyone was just kind of...confused. Like you gave us three singles years ago and this is your amazing comeback? It sounded so lowkey and not like a Big Rihanna Single like how we envisioned it should sound like. But whew is this song a grower; it's insansely catchy, and I honestly love the patios even though I have no idea what she's saying still (and honestly? I don't care about looking up the lyrics). Drake is decent and the two have great chemistry, as always. I was surprised this was so low, but I guess the 'why's she speaking gibberish!!!' crowd won in the end.

---

**JoeThaMo**: "I went from loving this track to feeling indifferent towards it and then back to absolutely loving it again. Rih and Drake have great chemistry, I enjoy pretty much all of their collabs even if their subject matter is always the same"

**BionicFunhouse**: "This song ridiculously catchy, I always find myself singing it."

**VodkaInsipido**: "The best dancehall song this year, period. And one of the best in general. Catchy, easy listening, relatively short, there's chemistry between Drake and Rihanna (until they broke up), everything made this a huge, deserved hit."

**Macubass**: "pretty lit"

**mokitsu**: "I love the glitchy production and the way her voice becomes so hypnotic/slurred on the hook."

**Rourke_**: "Drake feels unnecessary but the song doesn;t suffer too much from his presence"

**MrSwearword**: "Rihanna’s worst single. Terrible vocals, Drake’s corny ass line of “If you had a twin, I would still choose you” and had it not been for the TronicBox emo/polka/jazz version of the song, it would’ve gotten the 0."

**Bingcrusher**: "WORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORKKILLMEWORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORKWORK"

**chubs4life**: "So iconic, Camila Cabello and her ex band had to make a Walmart version of it."

**holly_foxxy**: "it's not... groundbreaking... but damn it a bop"

**ProphecyPizza**: "Does my ass clap? Yes. Do I have any idea what's happening? No."

**dirdbub**: "not sure how this was the most popular song off of Anti, but okay"

**JunkyGS**: "This song grows on me every time I listen to it and is so uniquely Rihanna. Nobody else could have as much success with this song imo. Drake sound good despite some corny lines."

**MihaMijat**: "Overplay killed it"

**enecks**: "A mocked song, but one that is still near perfect in my eyes. Drake stops it from being an 11. Fuck drake."

**estreindre**: "holy shit rihanna needs to learn to enunciate."

**omgcow**: "It was overplayed but I still like it."

**calltehshots**: "My ass is still shaking to this very day."

**Palutzel**: "it's one of the worst hit songs of 2016, the beat is ok, but the lyrics? MESS"

**TonyRealm**: "Doesn’t work work work work work for me. Bland vocals over a lifeless beat, Drake’s feature is interesting for a few seconds but doesn't really improve the song much."

**banananaise**: "Listening to this reminds me i have to look for a job and also that it's a bad song"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Literally average in every single way, except for the laughably bad lyrics in drake's verse. If this song had a twin, I wouldn’t listen to either of them."

**havanabrown**: "I used to hate this song when it first came out but it's grown on me. That being said the Drake feature added nothing but a bland ~2 minutes to the song"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "Overrated. Sorry gurl next. I know it's patois but this doesn't make any sense."

**superr_rad**: "Not Rihanna's best song for sure, but it's iconic and the perfect summer song. Drake doesn't do the song any favors IMO but I guess he helped with it's success?"

**soeri**: "i appreciate that rihanna's paying homage to her heritage but this song is trash"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Such a bop, the island flavor was before it was incredibly overused and both Rihanna and Drake bring the chemistry before they broke up, it was pretty perfectly timed in that way"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I would love this so much more if Rihanna's Patois weren't so damn exaggerated."

**bliamc**: "Eh. The verses are pretty bland and the chorus is so simple. I like the instrumental tho"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "honestly a doodoo Drake verse"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I too know how to mumble, but I don’t make a song about it. This didn’t get a 0 because Drake"

**Awhile2**: "best number one single of 2016 tbh and the fact that all the lewronggeneration types hated on it for the unintelligible chorus makes me like it even more"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Britney did it better"

**Bannerww**: "hated it and now I love it. boppp"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Drake's verse is everything and I love reggae Rihanna."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "This song D O M I N A T E D Canadian airplay for a year. Like, I cannot describe how inescapable it was in Toronto."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "It's nice to hear this song on the radio, and it is a fun listen, but that is it, unfortunately. Ultimately, it's kind of boring."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "I just love grinding to this"

**SkyBlade79**: "Maybe if she didn’t sound completely insane during the hook I would enjoy this. Maybe if Drake wasn’t on it I would enjoy it. Who knows?"

**chihuahuazero**: "The sample slays, Rihanna slides gracefully into the second verse, and while I didn’t see why this was the lead single when it dropped, now that it spent double-digit weeks at #1, I can see why. Remember, popheads, it’s dancehall, not tropical house."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Still a great song even after being overplayed."

**misguidedzombie**: "This song seems like it wouldn't be a hit since it's not conventional pop, but that's probably the reason why it was so popular. It's super catchy and stands out both on the album and on the charts."

**Therokinrolla**: "Never was a fan of this song; I can appreciate the slang at use within the track but it just sounds drawn out and repetitive. Also it was way overplayed."

**huntyphobic**: "If this song doesn’t make you want to get up and shake ya ass then get out of here tbh."

**SpanKKy1**: "H4RMONY ft. Camila did it better"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I know this was as overplayed as heck, but it's still a very enjoyable song."

**seferre2**: "i hate to be everyone else but this song is dumb and listening to the beat now makes me mad because it's not good"

**blue_charles**: "probably one of the better things to come out of the dancehall/trop-pop trend last year. Still, Drake's monotone verse just kills any momentum the song has for me"

**eklxtreme**: "I appreciate the dancehall production style but for me, I just can't get into the rest of the song and I'm not a fan of Drake's verse here"

**Yatcho**: "Suffers a little from being overplayed but fuck this song is dancehall pop perfected."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "not quite as good as the Emo Polka version but still a a banger"

**twat_brained**: "This song would never have gone #1 without Drake. Just saying."

**ImADudeDuh**: "2nd Worst collab between the two, but an ok song"

=====

letsallpoo: **leviOHsa**: "I LOVE a Drake X Rihanna collab, but this one got boring fast. Don’t get me wrong, I get turnt when this comes on in a club, but their past songs are still fire, and this one is more a dying ember in my basic bitch heart."

**alternativeoxygen**: "I had high expectations for this collaboration since Take Care and What's My Name were the most glorious tracks ever. This song pales. I think I'm being fair when comparing past collabs with this track because I know they can work magic... It's just not here for this record."

**JohnnyToby**: "took me a while to um respect this song but seriously kinda mad Work from Home prob wasn’t as successful as it could be bc this came out too f4fth harmony deserved bettEr"

**veryunfinished**: "when this song came out, i was ambivalent. two weeks later, i loved it. two weeks after that, i was ambivalent again. it is a good song though. rihanna can pull off caribbean influence in a pop song, which, you know, makes sense since she’s from barbados. i don't think drake can, and anyway his part is so boring."

**Willybae00**: "This is my song at the club! One of the few I get super excited when I hear it start because its just so danceable… I was so close to give it a 10 but I wish that either Drake would’ve came up with better lyrics, or that she would’ve chosen nicki or lil wayne instead"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "According to Genius, the song is about 'Rihanna seeks a deep, meaningful connection, however the male character she sings to (played by Drake) is only interested in sex.'. I find this kinda ironic and funny tbh."

**Wailordfan**: "As soon as she gets through her dar dar dar dar dar wa wa wa wa shit it actually turns into a pretty decent song, but the annoying af intro really kills it. It is unique enough to do well as a lead single and get stuck in your mind, but not in a good way."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Probably gonna be the most controversial rate of any song on this album. I personally love it. Rihanna and Drake combo is always fire, and this is no exception. Plus, dancehall at #1? Love it."

**qetaz**: "This song is... Just not my cup of tea. I don't like the extreme repetition. Dancehall isn't a genre I'd usually listen too anyway and increased exposure to it in the past year or so hasn't really done much to make it grow on me"

**Death_Soup**: "One of the hardest decisions of my life was choosing between Needed Me and Work for my 11, but I gave it to Work, because I think it deserves it being so misunderstood. This song is incredible. Nobody sees past the chorus, which everyone says is just gibberish. Everyone thinks it's just a twerking anthem, but it's so much more than that. The lyrics describe a complicated, more or less one-sided relationship. It's pretty much the lyrical opposite of Needed Me. But what wins me over are the fucking beautiful steelpans in the background and of course Rih and Drake's unmistakeable chemistry."

**joshually**: "A groundbreaking and scathing exposé about the underground world of illegal sex slave trading and its alarming ramifications, Work is dynamic journalism at its most harrowing and riveting. Bravo to Ms. Fenty for bringing this underreported tragedy to the light and setting it to a ragga-lite trap beat and getting it to #1."

**snidelaughter**: "It's not a bad song. Incomprehensible at points, but that's alright. Everything about this song feels like it's on autopilot except the production, which is probably one of the better dancehall-inspired beats this year. Kinda glad that PartyNextDoor gave this to her, actually. Honestly, the production on this album in general is really underrated. It's Rihanna's best album vocally, but the production really helps her shine too."

**spacebabe27**: "Fulfills its role of being an atmospheric club track but it sounds incomplete as opposed to minimalistic. This could easily be some rejected demo track and I wouldn't think twice about it. The Drake feature is honestly his best work of 2016 but that doesn't say much considering the sad excuses for bars he's put out recently. Rihanna's use of that Caribbean dialect (i don't know which specific one it is) really does add a lot to this song and keeps it from being the most boring song of the year, but it's close."

**ExtraEater**: "Work, Women & The City; It was finally happening, what she was waiting for the hard, livelong day. Quite simply, Robin and her boyfriend made out. No special circumstances or dreams about horse moms, but a simple makeout session. Throughout, they spoke whispered lies to each other. 'I will always love you' came on intermittently, and 'I will improve' came on in various, jagged synonyms. They could dream they were flying together, but neither conceded that it was out of a love for each other. A strong connection, like a drug, a tradeoff built to pleasure both of them for the span of an hour. An electric love could be felt in the air, sputtering and sputtering and neither could deny the power. With the battery set, they sang an unintelligible song for the millionth time in a month, a meaningful, but repetitive ballad full of notes, painted with direction but no cohesiveness to keep it together. But it was the work, the blazing work ethic that they had both put into the day that culminated and paid off into this session, their one mutual experience. Time danced around in their apartment, perhaps in their minds it was forever, yet the clock ticked with a constant rhythm into their heads, to mark a signal; 'a few more and this will be over'..... They slept in each other's arms. The sun waited deceptively in the distance, waiting to finally mark the coming of another hard, repeated day of work, work, work. [lmao this is a tryahrd poetic mess fucc me]"

MrSwearword: #YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

NOW LET ME DRAG THIS SONG TO HELL WITH MY FULL UNEDITED COMMENT.

FourFiveSeconds, Bitch Better Have My Money AND American Oxygen had to die for what is easily Rihanna’s worst single. Terrible vocals that sounds like she’s failing a breathalyzer in real time, Drake’s corny ass line of “If you had a twin, I would still choose you” and had it not been for the TronicBox emo/polka/jazz version of the song, it would’ve gotten the 0. Also, this is the song one of my favorite gogo boys REFUSES to dance to. If a dude PAID PENNIES TO THE QUARTER TO DANCE TO WHAT THE DJ PRESSES PLAY TO doesn’t want to dance to it, the shit sucks.

I actually didn't know this was considered the best bonus track until /u/raicicle's Top 100 tracks thing and this somehow snuck its way onto the list (I wrote the writeup for it too and I was surprised when he told me this track made it). It's definitely catchy though, with the hectic chorus clashing with the subdued yet still sexy verses, and Britney's trademark coquettishness makes everything better. I also love the Spanish part in the bridge, even if it's absolutely ridiculous and pointless, since it just adds to the overall fun. A minor victory as well: This has the distinction of being the highest-ranking bonus track in the rate.

**JoeThaMo**: "Probably my favorite off the album, why is this a Deluxe Track?"

**BionicFunhouse**: "Wow, she actually sounds pretty good here!"

**VodkaInsipido**: "AAANNNDDD BACK TO THE BEAT DROP"

**skiddos**: "Britney speaking Spanish fizzles my follicles"

**Macubass**: "invented spanish"

**mokitsu**: "Although the album sounds generic at points this is a exception! The chorus is everything."

**MrSwearword**: "The beat is fine, but what the hell possessed the team of a white chick from Louisiana to have her say anything let alone 3 words in Spanish?"

**holly_foxxy**: "wtf i thought i would hate this but i'm snatched"

**dirdbub**: "I can dig this. a lot"

**JunkyGS**: "Invented speaking Spanish in a pop song. Production, melody and everything are on point."

**MihaMijat**: "Bad chorus again"

**enecks**: "A solid song, but doesn’t change my mind on the album"

**calltehshots**: "A bop that invented Spanish and would’ve got an 11 if Tinasha didn’t come through."

**Palutzel**: "nice song, the latin sound is pretty goddamn great"

**TonyRealm**: "This is snazzy. Anyone know who’s speaking Spanish during the bridge?"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Once again the same boring song, just with a beat machin thrown in and some high pitch whines tacked on in the chorus."

**havanabrown**: "ehh"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "yasss, @selena this is how you use spanish in a song, it's even in the good verb tense, and she has good pronunciation. 10/10 britney"

**spacebabe27**: "Honestly take me back to when Spanish guitar was always in pop music."

**superr_rad**: "Why isn't this on the standard version? it's incredible"

**soeri**: "i gave it a 2 then lowered it to a 1 because it ruined my fucking language"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I feel like I heard this song already"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Not as clear cringy google translate usage as the other foreign language track, and with a nice Latin flair"

**bliamc**: "THERE ARE NO OTHER CONTENDERS FOR BEST SONG ON GLORY CHANGE YOUR MIND IS THE ULTIMATE JAM WHY WASN’T THIS ON THE ALBUM????"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "reina del español! the explosion in the chorus is so much fun!"

**Awhile2**: "It amazes me that Private Show made it on the album and this song is somehow a bonus track"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "catchy af and spanish makes me swoon"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Spanish doesn't make things interesting."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "oops, the first real flop."

**Wailordfan**: "I don't like the vocal-synthy thing playing loudly over-top the vocals. I do like the sudden output of the guitar in the Spanish interlude, but that's about it."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Another really good bonus track, somewhat similar to the last one, but with some cool Spanish and a less cool chorus."

**Reifiui**: "In comparaison to the previous song this drop (?) is really awesome, the verses aren't great but they're distinct enough to make me want to revist this song"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "I don't get why people stan this song. It's cute. Nothing special."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "I slept on this song for too long this is fucking amazing I’ll be dancing to this when I’m 110 years old (jks like I want to stay on this earth for that long)"

**SkyBlade79**: "Okay, that hook is actually really good, so I’m giving my score only based off of that. Still production carried."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "okay"

**Therokinrolla**: "Besides the fact that the word Cortes need an accent on the e, this song is further proof that the bonus tracks are the best on the record. I love the vibes this song gives off and the way she sings “Imma make you change you mind” is actually orgasmic"

**leviOHsa**: "This was cute, nothing special, but cute."

**alternativeoxygen**: "Bilingual is more fun."

**JohnnyToby**: "take a Spanish class hunny"

**seferre2**: "this song gave me a boner"

**blue_charles**: "Obligatory Queen of speaking Spanish. feels like uncomplicated filler, but at least it's vaguely interesting filler."

**eklxtreme**: "the weird Latin vibe actually works well with the pop production, why does she have to pander and pretend to speak Spanish though"

**joshually**: "The melody of this song throws me off, especially when the chorus kicks in. There's this weird lilt to it that is so unexpected, and then when she starts speaking in spanish, you're like why would Trump ever build a wall? So rude!"

**Yatcho**: "The dancefloor banger this album really needed. The spanish is kind of a wtf inclusion but im not mad about it either"

**veryunfinished**: "i can feel the chorus melody driving itself into my brain. this pulls off its influences"

**Willybae00**: "I love her voice, the background vocals, and the instrumental. The only reason I don’t give it a 10 is because it feels like a dance song I cant dance to"

**twat_brained**: "The vocals are everything, the Spanish fusion is 👌🏻👌🏻, and I fall more and more in love with this song every time I hear it! Easily an 11 in my book!"

JunkyGS: I can see that, but some people don't know how to judge songs with different mindsets. Like you shouldn't give a catchy brit song 2/10 cause "its mindless pop music", if its trying to be a catchy pop song I judge based on how well does it do that, If that makes sense.

One of the biggest bops on Joanne. I have no idea what she's talking about aside from the parts about masturbation, but I don't even care. This deserves to be a single and get a weird and sexy music video, so she'll probably ignore its existence completely. I love being a Gaga fan!

---

**SkyBlade79** has a very nice writeup so I moved it to the front: "This is the song most similar to any of Gaga's past work; the production, however, incorporates elements from both country and dancehall. It's this type of unique style that I expected from Beck, who helped make this song. In particular, the whisper-sung pre and post chorus reminds me of something off of 2010-era Gaga, and something about this song is particularly reminiscent of 'LoveGame'. The lyrics are lewd, as the song is about, uh, 'self-love', but in a rather endearing way, as Gaga doesn't try to use metaphor or subliminal messages to try to get the point across; she just goes right out and says it without hiding anything. The boppy production and the chorus of 'Baby don't cry/I'm singin' dancin' in circles, feels good to be lonely' actually make this song the most enjoyable song off of Joanne to listen to, at least for me. It certainly has the most replay value."

And then everyone else just talks about masturbating and whatnot:

**BionicFunhouse**: "Yess female masturbation."

**VodkaInsipido**: "Reggae and dance in a country album? Produced by Mark Ronson? About masturbation? You crazy for this one Joanne!"

**melisanyans**: "If the whole song was like the prechorus it would be so much better. Gaga's whispering is horrendous, and the production during the verses is especially trash and frankly makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm all for masturbation anthems (see: Body of My Own by Charli XCX (got the gun in my hand and I'm pointing it straight! To the target and I'm gonna blow my brains!)) but this is just kinda bad and worst of all, awkward."

**skiddos**: "I want to go to a hoedown"

**Macubass**: "overrated"

**mokitsu**: "I wish the dancehall/raggae sound hadn't taken over because it'd sound amazing with literally any other production!"

**Rourke_**: "Gaga's masturbation songs get worse each time"

**MrSwearword**: "Oh GOD this fucking wannabe ska shit. Masturbation conspiracies be damned, this is just Gaga throwing away her vocals on the chorus and that shit is unacceptable."

**FuckUpSomeCommasYeah**: "masturbation anthem"

**holly_foxxy**: "every part of this song is perfect."

**JamesTheGent**: "Invented masturbating."

**ProphecyPizza**: "YES MAMA MAKE MY PUSSY CLAP"

**dirdbub**: "great song about masturbation"

**JunkyGS**: "Hailee Steinfeld is shook."

**MihaMijat**: "I WAS SHOOK"

**enecks**: "I don’t like the vocals in this, and it seems a bit overproduced, with too many random noises."

**estreindre**: "the lyrics in this one are ehhhh, and i'm not huge on gaga's voice in it, but i actually really love the melody on it!"

**omgcow**: "This is really good, I wish there was more of this on the album."

**calltehshots**: "omg what is this masturbation bop!!"

**Joebiekong**: "Uuuh"

**Palutzel**: "i masturbate to this everyday"

**TonyRealm**: "Fun song, but did you know that if a group of army ants gets separated from the main party and loses the pheromone track, they will start following each other, forming a rotating circle. They keep going until they die of exhaustion."

**marcryan**: "Gaga’s 9th song about masterbation. Honestly goals"

**SG432**: "Completely unremarkable"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Im not even a girl but this song makes female masturbation sound fun af. Also that scream of “dancin’ in circles” before the final chorus."

**havanabrown**: "This song is pretty boring I don’t get why it’s popular"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "if there's ever a seeb remix of this i will probably like it"

**superr_rad**: "For a song about masturbation this is pretty boring"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Gaga’s most relatable subject matter, Taylor isn’t gonna make a song about jerking off. Seriously though I like the sorta dancehall vibe of the beat"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "My favourite off the album, Queen of Masturbation"

**bliamc**: "I didn’t know that I needed a masturbation anthem written by Lady Gaga and Beck"

**Tipttt284**: "How can you not love a song that loves masturbation so much?"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Queen of masturbation. Hailee Steinfield who?"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Gaga is the queen of female masturbation and the queen of gays and I'm sure she can hold both those titles simultaneously. Queen of being queen."

**Death_Soup**: "This sounds like it belongs on Glory more than Joanne."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "country is trash"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "relatable"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "sorry Gaga but Britney invented masturbation back in 2003 with “Touch of My Hand”"

**mother_rucker**: "Only slightly subtler than the iconic “I Touch Myself”"

**Wailordfan**: "I've said it before, but I feel like Hailey Steinfeld, literally did modern masturbation songs better, and I'll stick by that comment."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Best song about masturbating this generation."

**qetaz**: "I just really don't like this song"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Sex Gaga Best Gaga"

**chihuahuazero**: "I cited this song in a final essay about female masturbation in pop music. It was for a freshman tutorial class specializing in sexuality in media."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Gosh I’m liking this album more than I remember."

**Therokinrolla**: "Ah, this song could be infamous. If released as a single, I could see this masturbation anthem taking over the world, with moms getting angry at Gaga for being controversial. I think this song as a third single could work wonders, with another amazingly singable chorus. Yet, I think the prechorus and verses outshadow the chorus. The verses are expertly executed and sung to a tee."

**huntyphobic**: "this song is just ok, I’d rather have CupcakKe teach me about masturbation tbh"

**SpanKKy1**: "Step aside Hailee, this is the real masturbation anthem"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is the best song about jacking off every written."

**youknwnothingjonsnow**: "what is this"

**leviOHsa**: "Enjoyable bop. Flick ya bean, get ya life."

**JohnnyToby**: "another trop-flop"

**blue_charles**: "I have no idea what's she's talking about. Why's she doing a trick? I'm so very confused. I just don't see what this song has to do with dancing at all!"

**VioletChutzkee**: "It's too on the clitoris for me."

**eklxtreme**: "chorus drop with the percussion and guitar is amazing and her vocals are just incredible, i can imagine her singing this while dancing around a fire, 2nd wildest song of the year after Panda, i didn't stop dancing through the whole song"

**joshually**: "This song has no redeeming qualities. Why is she singing like the whitest white lady against a dancehall beat? Rihanna would like to have some words with her."

**snidelaughter**: "JOANNE THIS IS LEWD COME ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR AND RID YOURSELF OF THIS 'FUNK ME DOWNTOWN' SINNERGY"

**Yatcho**: "The fact that its a masturbation song is cute but... nothing is exceptional about this song. Not even a little bit catchy or memorable"

**veryunfinished**: "this song is actually catchy and not just lady gaga over-singing!"

**Willybae00**: "This sounds more like the Gaga I know and I like"

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Love Myself/Body Of My Own lowkey did it better, but this still bops."

**twat_brained**: "I wanna funk someone downtown to this"

A decent intro, but outside of the context of the album/film, it doesn't hold up. And speaking of Hold Up, a lot of times I think Bey was better off just using that as the first track. Like how epic would it be if the first thing you heard was that MLG airhorn and then this island beat as she nonchalantly sings about getting revenge on her dishonest husband? Ugh, instantly iconic. Basically what I'm saying is that I find this track a tad useless.

---

**TaylordSwiftsus**: "This is actual perfection"

**skiddos**: "LOVE the strings at the end"

**Macubass**: "so good"

**mokitsu**: "When the movie started and this song started I knew she wasn't playing! The production is minimal but great, the lyrics are amazing. Plus it transitions so smoothly into Hold Up."

**MrSwearword**: "Beat work is greater than her vocal output and for someone of her caliber to still be putting out ballads that do nothing for her is unacceptable SIX. ALBUMS. LATER."

**chubs4life**: "Maybe she should pray for a better song instead."

**mgglite**: "the very start of this song sounds like it should be in ahs/silent hill/horror movie when someone joins a cult"

**holly_foxxy**: "honestly... this song is so beautiful and opens up the album so perfectly."

**dirdbub**: "wow, she #didthat. this is the fucking WAY to start an infidelity album"

**JunkyGS**: "Very emotional opening that really sets the atmosphere and context for the rest of the album."

**enecks**: "It sounds beautiful, and immediately gets emotional investment. A bit simplistic compared to the album’s peaks, but still magnificent."

**estreindre**: "incredible song that helps set the tone for the album. the chorus is one of the best parts of the entire album, everything about it from her vocals to the production work to make it absolutely beautiful."

**calltehshots**: "Gorgeous I'm genuinely shook"

**Joebiekong**: "What is this trash?"

**Palutzel**: "i'm trying to find the brilliance in this critically acclaimed album, but the first song doesn't really help, it's just a basic slow song, nothing special"

**TonyRealm**: "I still don’t know if I like the murmured intro, but the rest is stellar and the strings are immaculate."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Pretty downbeat but it represents the disbelief and distrust, and sets up the rest of the album so well. Wouldn’t listen to it on its own."

**potrap**: "A perfect intro to a perfect album."

**havanabrown**: "Those violins at the end got me on the floor weeping"

**spacebabe27**: "An amazing opening track to this album and the instrumentation makes it sound so ethereal. This particular song has the best 'wall of sound' out of all 4 of these albums."

**superr_rad**: "This is the perfect opener. So much emotion is conveyed in the lyrics, production, and delivery. Add the “uhs” at the beginning and it’s so hauntingly beautiful."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The only good slow piano ballad on this album, really. I love how it just builds throughout, it’s a great intro to the sounds and themes of Lemonade. The minimal production works too, helps draw more power to Bey’s vocals instead of becoming distracting."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "This is such an amazing way to open up the album, chills the second Beyoncé begins to sing"

**bliamc**: "Sandcastles may overshadow it because of how emotional that song is, but Pray You Catch Me is the best ballad on Lemonade. Haunting and heartbreaking"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "gorgeous gorgeous album opener. my emotional ass has cried to this several times tbh"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Yah"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "It's a good opener and I love Beyonce's vocals but the song itself is a bit boring to listen itself."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "the opening turned me off a bit - seriously who thought it was a good idea to have humming and then a few seconds of silence - but queen bey pulls off the slower song better than a certain other artist on this rate. i didn't come here for monologues though."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I'm crying already wtf"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "seems like an odd start but im not here to judge"

**mother_rucker**: "Her voice sounds great, but overall this song is kind of boring. I skip it every time."

**Wailordfan**: "It is kinda the same thing over and over."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Damn, what a good intro. It doesn't pick up until the second half, but when it does, it's certainly worth it. Subtle instrumental, but when you listen to those lyrics, it manages to be something pretty special."

**qetaz**: "ethereal"

**Reifiui**: "This song ticks all the boxes on how to make a low key ballad like this work, well written lyrics with enough stakes to catch my attention, Beyoncé giving a strong & subtle performance and the intrumentation that evolves to go beyond a simple piano ballad to form a sublime intro for Lemonade"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Man I am sucker for a beyonce ballad."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "not bad but Ariana did the piano opener better with moonlight tbh pls don’t hurt me"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Here we go now this is some amazing pop music."

**Zugtris**: "gOD this takes me back to the release of lemonade, the second i heard those opening vocals i was PERCHED and knew we were in it for a timeless one (song & album)"

**Therokinrolla**: "Its not an excellent introduction to the album, the visuals in this section are on point, but the song feels a little unfinished."

**huntyphobic**: "Maybe I’m just a delusional stan but this song is so good. It has beautiful instrumentals and atmosphere, while setting up the story of Lemonade. This was a great way to start off the album imo."

**leviOHsa**: "This song gives me chills, it just conveys the emotion so well."

**seferre2**: "this song is fake deep and boring"

**ExtraEater**: "WHY THIS IS LITERALLY GENIUS AND BEYONCE IS JESUS, WHISPERING IS AN ONOMOTOPOEIA, IT IS A CONVENTION OF POETRY, BEYONCE WRITES POETRY CONFIRMED"

**blue_charles**: "This song is a slow, slow build, taking half of a minute for the lyrics to start, and from there it's slow, almost somber, and introduces the album's themes of cheating and infidelity perfectly. The way the harmonies and strings build together in the last minute, and then the quiet whisper of 'what are you doing, my love?' just works so so well. It's kind of iconic guys, deal with it."

**VioletChutzkee**: "This song makes me feel like I'm ascending to a higher plane of existence thank you Beysus"

**eklxtreme**: "nice intro to settle you in"

**snidelaughter**: "No modern pop artist has gripped me as much as Beyoncé has on an intro track. Haunting, iconic, and dangerous, all with a prayer and a whisper."

**Yatcho**: "Really good opener to this album and sets up the whole story of Lemonade"

**veryunfinished**: "honestly i don’t like the intro to this song that much, but when she starts singing… man. imo this song is so good at conveying that exact feeling of hoping someone will care that you care. beyonce can do a good ballad, and this is easily the best on the album since there are only two. the ending honestly sounds solange-esque, with the way the harmonies just sigh."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "can't wait for the remix (Pray You) Cash Me Ousside Howbout Dah" Sorry, Spankky did the joke first.

**twat_brained**: "Y'all better pray with this gospel sound!"

A great intro to the album, if a little short. SZA sounds great and the track goes pretty hard. I want my shit to be covered in glitter as well. (#FreeKesha.)

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Very unconventional yet fitting opener that sets the mood just right"

**VodkaInsipido**: "the only disappointment on here is that SZA hasn't released A yet."

**skiddos**: "I really really wish this song was longer because everything about this track is SOLID"

**Macubass**: "Meh"

**mokitsu**: "The best album opener of the year, the lyrics serve as a perfect introduction to what the album means to Rih! SZA's voice compliments Rih's so well and as a longtime fan it was nice to see her included in such a blockbuster album!"

**Rourke_**: "fantastic start to the album, confident and clearly stating this isn't your regular rihanna record"

**MrSwearword**: "SZA does the heavy lifting for Rihanna and the lyric, “Let me cover your shit in glitter/I could make it gold, gold” is just unforgivable."

**chubs4life**: "Perfect opening for a perfect album!"

**ProphecyPizza**: "What kind of iconic opening???????"

**dirdbub**: "this goes awf"

**JunkyGS**: "Perfect track to open the album with and really sets the mood for the rest of the album."

**MihaMijat**: "A great opening"

**enecks**: "I hate how the beat sounds so artificial. It cheapens Rihanna’s great performance."

**estreindre**: "really nice start to the album! love the production on it."

**omgcow**: "This is a GREAT opener. I love the energy and the vibe. Really sets the stage for the rest of the album."

**Joebiekong**: "Let me cover your shit in glitter, I can make it gold, gold."

**eribertknows**: "As soon as I heard this for the first time I knew Rihanna had given us something different and better. I wasn't wrong."

**Palutzel**: "ugh i'm bored"

**TonyRealm**: "Solid album opener: love the gritty instrumental, RiRi & SZA sound strong. I wish it had a more forceful ending rather the beat looping."

**banananaise**: "This is a decent filler track but there is literally nothing notable about it"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "FourFiveSeconds 2.0, every line is a hook that gets inside of your brain for days. -2 points for “Let me cover all your shit in glitter.”"

**havanabrown**: "Their voices compliment each other quite nicely but other than that it felt a bit bland"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "Not bad, i like the way she delivers the lyrics. Tbh the only part of this that I really like is SZA singing. The beat is sick tho"

**spacebabe27**: "Pretty boring to me but this beat slaps."

**superr_rad**: "Pretty good start to the album"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The drums are so hard, the bass is such a groove, and Rih and SZA both slay me with their vocals, I actually like this more then I remember"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "'I came fluttering in from Neverland' introduces us to perhaps Rihanna's most cohesive album ever, plus it's a banger"

**bliamc**: "Love the beat and strange vocal melodies here"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "nice chill vibe + it's a very smooth collaboration"

**Awhile2**: "I love these odd future drums and SZA x Rihanna is a god dream"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "A good opener to address her hiatus after the release of her previous album Unapolgetic. SZA's vocals are a nice touch."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "s l o w song. I kept waiting for the hook to hit and snatch me. No such thing happened. Tragic."

**triptoyourheart**: "Praying this makes Top 10 but pretty unlikely since it’s not a single. Still I can’t see how one can’t see how amazing this song is. This is undoubtedly Rihanna’s masterpiece."

**Death_Soup**: "This is a mess but it's a catchy af mess. nobody other than Rih could pull this off."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Reggae queens."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "A really boring song, but the glitter line pushed it up."

**Wailordfan**: "This is a super solid opener, with a fun beat that is just processed enough to give it an a e s t h e t i c. Also, cover your shit in glitter is a fun line and should get more recognition here."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "SZA slays. Drums are on point, and it's quite a way to start an album. Certified banger, and two singers have some serious chemistry."

**qetaz**: "it took me a few listens, but I'm into it now"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "It's just beatiful."

**SkyBlade79**: "Not the least bit interesting, it just drags on for a song less than 3 minutes, and her accent is off-putting."

**chihuahuazero**: "This is Rihanna’s best album intro since Rated R. The lyrical, freeform nature establishes that Anti won’t be like the last few records from her."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "YES this is an amazing catchy song."

**Therokinrolla**: "SUPER solid intro to the album that made me think it would be interesting"

**huntyphobic**: "Never thought I would hear experimental Rihanna, loves it. The vocals are holding it back tho."

**SpanKKy1**: "Literally what is a SZA"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The way this song flows is really interesting, and I like the accents here. Pretty decent song, even if it's not one of Rihanna's best."

**youknwnothingjonsnow**: "great opening track"

**leviOHsa**: "It’s okay. But what is it? Not a great album opener, doesn’t give me much hope for the rest of the album."

**alternativeoxygen**: "Cute song and I really like the budget beats. I don't see what everyone else sees in it tho. It's a good mood setter and I have high expectations for the rest of the album now ."

**JohnnyToby**: "hmm"

**seferre2**: "the best opener rih could've chosen imho, not totally attention grabbing but satisfying"

**eklxtreme**: "SZA's chorus is beautiful, great melodies and production all around"

**joshually**: "I thought SZA was one of the Wu Tangs but now I believe it's one of the other female voices in this subpar song, slightly elevating this from the level of dirty muddy water to just dirty undrinkable water."

**snidelaughter**: "SZA's hook is probably one of the most underrated hooks to come out of an album this year. Wavy song."

**Yatcho**: "The best album opener in the rate, bad bitch Rihanna is here to set the tone"

**veryunfinished**: "this song is such a good opener, and the beat is so good. i don't know if anyone other than rihanna could sing this. sza sounds really good on this as well."

**Willybae00**: "I would like this song more if it was shorter, I feel like it drags"

**twat_brained**: "Not a GREAT song, nor is it suitable for an album opener in Rihanna's case, but if I ever hit a bong or something I could see myself jamming to this."

Easily my fave nonsingle and one of the tracks I was gunning to make it to the top 10. Alas it never got that close, but at least it made it pretty far. This song sounds so effortlessly cool and dark, like a true Rihanna track, which is the main reason why I love it. The production is so immaculate and subdued. Apparently (as one commentator will get into in a bit) this also sampled Banks' 'Waiting Game,' a fact I did not realize even though that's one of my favorite Banks tracks. But can you blame me? It literally isn't said anywhere online that this officially samples that. Apparently it just mentions it in the album booklet, though.

---

And of course, it would be **SkyBlade79** who notices that this is sampling Banks: "This one was extremely hard for me to rate. On one hand, I like the song. Quite a bit, actually. On the other hand, there’s a huge issue with it. The instrumental is an almost complete ripoff of the instrumental for Waiting Game by Banks. I know the first thing you’re thinking: oh, that’s just a sample! Stupid sky! No, it’s not. It’s completely uncredited in every way, at least from what it said on the internet ( I don’t own the Anti album, so I can’t just check the booklet. I even looked on the official site and there’s no mention of a sample, unlike on work.) Therefore, it was most likely used without permission. Specifically, it’s the producer, Sohn, who was ripped off. So, I’m really left with no choice but to give it an extremely low score. It was originally a 1, but I weighed it because I actually do like the lyrics. It’s a good attempt over Sohn’s instrumental. If I’m wrong, feel free to prove it; I hope I am, but I’ve done so much research on this at this point that I don’t know."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** has a different theory: "Apparently this song has a lot of fans. I thought this is an okay song but Azealia Banks does Desperado much better (even though Azealia is a piece of shit)."

**skiddos**: "The coolest song on the rate"

**Macubass**: "boring"

**mokitsu**: "This is boring, really doesn't do anything. Could've been kept!"

**MrSwearword**: "There’s only 2 awkward “song is about to end moments” that have me griping, but this is some subtle vocal work I didn’t think Rihanna had in her."

**holly_foxxy**: "i'm not mad at it, but there's nothing here for me."

**JunkyGS**: "This song belongs in a Quentin Tarantino movie trailer or something. It is so haunting and cool."

**MihaMijat**: "Amazing"

**enecks**: "How haven’t I heard this before it’s good af."

**omgcow**: "Again with the amazing energy. Listening to this album again makes me think that I need to become a Rihanna stan."

**calltehshots**: "The Rihanna country western song I didn’t know I needed but I’m glad I have."

**eribertknows**: "What a bop! This should be the next single after Love on the Brain reaches #1 on the Billboard 100."

**Palutzel**: "it's actually great, only song that I really love from this album"

**TonyRealm**: "There's a piano two-note sequence (high F, low F) that appears right before each pre-chorus + chorus, and it sounds eerily similar to the “new Facebook message” alert, just reversed. It’s the stupidest thing but I get distracted every time. I also wish this song had a bit more punch to it, but lyrically it's a standout."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Rihanna invented 2016 country. Somehow this sounds like modern r&b and evokes country feelings perfectly. The humming in the back of the second verse tho."

**havanabrown**: "Pretty boring, seemed to drag on for ages"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "who would have guessed that a song that shares name with a lame brand of beer (http://imgur.com/a/yuZ0C) would be so bad? Hint: i would"

**spacebabe27**: "This instrumental has a lot of industrial elements which I can really appreciate but Rihanna's lulling vocals just don't match up well for me. Nonetheless a good song."

**soeri**: "like lana del rey but actually good"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "So slinky and mysterious and caps off a 5 song streak of awesomeness"

**bliamc**: "This sounds like it’s off the soundtrack to a western, starring Rihanna, with shootouts and bar fights. I want to see that movie."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "getting better, picking up with the beats"

**Death_Soup**: "Probably Rihanna's most meh song."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I love when she sings in this voice."

**Wailordfan**: "The production on this album is top notch, but this song is really forgettable. Parts of the chorus are nice, but I just don't love this."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Super underrated song, imo. Rihanna's fierce on this one, and it seems like a more subdued Rihanna than the one we see on BBHMM, but it's equally intimidating. If /r/popheads made Red Dead Redemption, this would be the trailer song."

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Invented Salma Hayek. When will your fav?"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Less of a bop."

**Therokinrolla**: "this word is the english translation of the word desperado. Cool!"

**seferre2**: "i completely disagree when people complain that rih did not release this as a single. it would never chart: too boring too slow"

**blue_charles**: "Solid production backs moody laid back vocals to come together into a song that is haunting and melodically if a little static."

**eklxtreme**: "I love the dark synthy droning production style even though Banks did this exact song before, lyrics are quite nice"

**joshually**: "The love theme to the HBO smash television event Westworld, Desperado weaves a sordid tale of the loneliness the extremely intelligent face as a result of their isolating gifts, leading them to create desire-fulfilling hosts and virtual worlds for escape, hedonism and complete abandon."

**snidelaughter**: "The hihats on the album are really well used. Like, better than most artists. The world needs more bad bitch Rihanna."

**Yatcho**: "Lyrically I really like this song but I cant help but feel like the production is way too mellow and even boring for Rihanna"

**veryunfinished**: "i know you won’t leave me because we share common interests! i love the production on this. it feels rich. those crashing drums in the chorus! this song is majestic and makes me feel like i should be riding a horse through a desert in like, arizona or something."

**Willybae00**: "it just feels like a filler"

**twat_brained**: "This is actually pretty good! I'm kinda liking this album so far"

This was my personal favorite on the album when it first came out, and I'm honestly fine with it being the highest nonsingle. I think /u/eklxtreme mentioned this, but it feels weirdly nostalgic in this strange unintentional way, like when Britney's daydreaming about her man on the moon, she's singing about this previous time when life was better and whatnot. Yet the song is still very peaceful, and even though her lover isn't with her, she still finds peace in the light he brings her at night. It's a beautiful track, and the lift-off countdown thing she does leading into the final chorus is a definite highlight of Glory.

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Very cute song and definitely in my Top 3 of the album"

**BionicFunhouse**: "It’s okay"

**VodkaInsipido**: "This is actually getting good wtf."

**melisanyans**: "This song slinks back and forth and it's beautiful. I remember when Glory leaked, this is the song that meant that this album wouldn't be trash."

**skiddos**: "I love everything about this song: the vocoder that starts off the song, the xylophone at the chorus, the general softness of Britney's vocals, the French and strings at the bridge, EVERYTHING!! This song gives me all types of feelings!!"

**Macubass**: "soooo good <3 the vocals"

**mokitsu**: "I get emotional listening to this song!!! I love the production and the gibberish at the end is funny."

**MrSwearword**: "“I can’t compete with the stars in the sky, I’m invisible” Did Shady Music Facts write this lyric? That aside, production is nice but the half-assed French? Absolument NON."

**JunkyGS**: "This song is just very solid. The production is very slick with great lyrics that flow very well."

**MihaMijat**: "Almost got my 11 it's amazing"

**enecks**: "I hate some of the lyrics, but the chorus is alright"

**estreindre**: "i actually really like this song! she sounds really pretty on this, and this actually has a pretty unique sound to it unlike every other song on this album."

**omgcow**: "Ok this song is so fucking BEAUTIFUL it makes me want to float in the ocean while looking up at the stars, or dance on the beach in a big flowy gown, it’s tropical and out of this world at the same time and I looooove the lyrics. PLUS can we just talk about how amazing the bridge is, idk if she’s speaking French or what but my GOD it’s so good."

**calltehshots**: "A beautiful bop. Queen of traveling to mars and the moon? NASA is shaken."

**Palutzel**: "it's lame"

**TonyRealm**: "Probably the last singer I expected to reference space travel, but okay! The production is really delicate, and I love the xylophone melody sprinkled in during the chorus. Britney’s vocals are gentle but earnest, and blend in seamlessly. She butchers some of the French but overall this is an oasis for your ears."

**havanabrown**: "Never knew I wanted a man on the moon until now"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "SLAY ME MOM!!!!"

**spacebabe27**: "I am so glad this was right after Private Show in the tracklist because I needed to repent for sins. They weren't my sins necessarily but someone down the line had made a mistake."

**superr_rad**: "Kid Cudi who?"

**soeri**: "queen of having 1 good song in her album"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "You don’t wanna hook up with Cudi, he’s an asshole. I actually thought this was pretty good though for real"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I think this was the first track on the album that really fully convinced me that we had exited the era of Britney Jean"

**bliamc**: "I like that she tried"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Are you wearing space pants? Because your ass is out of this world"

**Awhile2**: "the most overrated song on the album. Its not bad but its p boring and the bridge is corny"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I love the metaphor usage and the themes here, backed with an amazing production. It's probably one of the best songs on Glory."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "feels rather cheesy but at least it has a chorus unlike most of anti"

**Death_Soup**: "Same as Private Show: great verses, chorus is nothing special."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Really good Bubblegum"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "bookmark me if this isn't top 10 im aborting my firstborn"

**Wailordfan**: "This intro is legit so good. Zoo Tycoon called though and wanted their back track back (The chorus sounds like I'm making my zebra's a nice big cage). The orchestral build up is kinda super good too."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Spacey vibes continue, and as busy and odd as this beat is, it works really well. Britney does this thing where she continues the next line in the chorus from the previous one, and I've always been a fan of that. The bridge is also a highlight, with the switch to French unexpected but extremely fitting."

**Reifiui**: "This is pretty good but it was overhyped I think, maybe would have liked it more if it hadn't been"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Starts really cool, becomes really generic by the first chorus. Brit can and did do better."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "AMAZING"

**SkyBlade79**: "Okay, this caught me completely off guard. This is really great. Zella Day’s Man on the Moon is far superior (and very similar?), but this song is actually great. The chorus is really amazing, though the verses are lacking. Out of all the songs on the album, this is my favorite by far."

**chihuahuazero**: "I’m sorry. I gave this extra attention because people said it was an album highlight. I’ll throw in an extra half a point, but I can’t say much else."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "this is forgettable"

**Zugtris**: "i was expecting overbearing autotone the second i heard the 'moOOOOn''s but this is surprisingly good... fuck, are y'all making me into a moderate britney fan"

**Therokinrolla**: "In between two trashy pop songs lies this little gem that sounds like it could be from Circus. Luv it!"

**SpanKKy1**: "Neil Armstrong is shook!"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I almost gave this song my 11."

**leviOHsa**: "The verses were just meh, but the chorus made me cringe. I can’t."

**JohnnyToby**: "Really a highlight. Love the xylophones"

**seferre2**: "this is the best the production is amazing her voice is beautiful and the mood of the song is perfect and i don't understand all do the meaning behind this song as i never followed britney personally but i know it has a deeper meaning that just gives me this feeling.... i hate this term but man on the moon is literally pop perfection. also queen of astronauts"

**blue_charles**: "I'm surprised by the emotional ride that this song manages to take me on. werk tbh."

**eklxtreme**: "very catchy and sweet melody, pretty production and nostalgic vibe, i like the lyrics too, love it all"

**joshually**: "A fitting sequel to the incomparable Everytime, MOTM is a perfect song of plaintive hopefulness awash in the stark reality of loneliness. Caribbean steel drums, gentle whispers and a lilting beat all paint an atmosphere of wistfulness in this masterpiece."

**snidelaughter**: "This is boring."

**Yatcho**: "Cute chorus but the rest is nothing special, and that opening is pretty awful actually. Perfectly acceptable effort"

**Willybae00**: "Her voice, the lyrics, inventing moon language, Chateau Marriott. Britney is delivering everything you didn’t know you wanted in a song"

**twat_brained**: "Of all the times I’ve heard this, I’ve just realized… THIS IS A PERFECT LOVE LETTER TO THE VMAS."

**ImADudeDuh**: "This sounds like a Jon Bellion song, and it really is amazing"

Never really liked this one. The production sounds kind of weird and too poppy at parts, like it's some 1989 leftover, which would be okay in some contexts but really stands out on an album like this. Also Gaga's using her weird Dope voice too much and it's somehow even more aggravating when it's on an uptempo song. How did this get so far?

=====

letsallpoo: 
**BionicFunhouse**: "A very difficult decision, but my eleven was going to go to either this or Sinner’s Prayer. I chose this one because I feel that this song is very personal to Lady Gaga, and I appreciate it deeply."

**melisanyans**: "For some reason everyone says Dancin' in Circles or A-YO or John Wayne should be the next single. They're all wrong. It so, unequivocally should be this."

**skiddos**: "The chorus is a lot of fun to sing along to"

**Macubass**: "love this"

**mokitsu**: "The accent kills it! The production sounds unfinished on the chorus. The lyrics are good tho."

**Rourke_**: "feels like it's missing something, kind of like Marry the Night without the funky breakdown"

**MrSwearword**: "The chorus pacing is weird as fuck on “Young, wild, American/C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?” to the rest of the chorus. Still, helluva album opener."

**JamesTheGent**: "A great start and introduction to Joanne"

**dirdbub**: "I forgot how much this opening bangs. so fucking good"

**JunkyGS**: "Lyrically it the most open & confessional Gaga has ever been. I think it struck the best balance of her previous work & new Joanne sound."

**MihaMijat**: "Too loud for my taste"

**enecks**: "OK this is a mess but I enjoy it. I think the vocals and the instrumental don’t sound like they are in the same song at first. Still, this grew on me, and has a sense of fun that I appreciate."

**estreindre**: "a really strong start to this album, it helps show both the ballad parts of the album and how hard the rock on it can get. really really like this song."

**omgcow**: "I really hate how her voice sounds on this but it’s super upbeat and fun."

**calltehshots**: "Yas this trashy bar stripper anthem, I’m here for it."

**Palutzel**: "great, but I think that it had the potential to be even better"

**TonyRealm**: "I just listened to this, and can’t remember any of it."

**marcryan**: "The chorus brings up repressed memories of my mother asking if I have a girlfriend"

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Not a strong start, the switching from the pre chorus to the chorus the the second part of the chorus is way to jolting."

**havanabrown**: "The pre chorus and “YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNG wild American” are such great parts of the song. I hope she releases this as a single some time"

**spacebabe27**: "This song just feels so correct for a stadium. The production manages to make this track feel huge and anthemic without being overwhelming. The shining star from Joanne that is not getting the treatment it deserves."

**soeri**: "The perfect intro to the album, it lets you know exactly what you're getting into: messy, passionate and country inspired. The first few seconds of this song are more iconic than the entirety of Glory."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This song feels like too much buildup and it doesn’t feel like it pays off enough and the chorus feels like a prechorus. It not bad though, I like the instruments."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Really strong opening to a decent album, and kinda dispelled my fears of what Country!Gaga would be like"

**bliamc**: "fine… not particularly interesting"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "the YOOOOOOUNG WIIILD AMEERIIICAN is almost enough to make me not hate the USA"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I have grown to like this song much more than I did when I first heard of this. But I still think there were more outstanding tracks on this album for me."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Gaga might not be flawless but this song is <3"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Pretty decent, especially for country."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "Y O U N G WILD AMERICAN gets me"

**mother_rucker**: "I read somewhere that this is autobiographical, which is cool. I just hate her vocals on this and the lyrics sound cheesy."

**Wailordfan**: "Ah full, powerful vocals, how I've missed you. The kick drum is powerful, and the huge buildup is fun, and really helped people the first time listening to the album knowing that parts of her pop roots are still shining y'all. This song is really just pretty perfect, a bit of country, but a bit of 80s synths, and some rock influences, all with a bit of edm thrown in the pre-chorus. God Damn."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "What a way to start an album. The buildup here is insane, and in an album full of buildups, this one is super strong. 'Come on baby, do you have a girlfriend?' is such a damn good line and it makes the wait all worth it."

**Reifiui**: "I'm not giving this song my 11 because I think it's the best on in the rate (even though it's close) but because this song hypes me up SO MUCH, this is a killer intro for the album that left me listening to the rest of the album completely bald... Also because I'm sure it's going to be fucking robbed and I love torturing myself by giving my 11 to songs that won't get proper justice"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "I would rate this higher, but the song changes style like three times in the first minute and I can't."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "you and I did this genre better"

**SkyBlade79**: "The first verse is slow and almost boring, but the pre-chorus explodes into sound, as Gaga powerful shouts 'Young, wild American/ C'mon baby do you have a girlfriend?'. These lyrics suit the song perfectly; it's a song of empowerment and flirtatiousness, and at the same time it's distinctly American. Though the verses are lackluster on this track, it's a good start to the album and it really showcases the American feel that she's attempting to portray on Joanne."

**chihuahuazero**: "“Young, wild, American. C'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?” Why am I swooning?"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "I’m not a Gaga fan, haven’t listened to any album of her’s except this one. I don’t like it, too country. Also what is her voice on this hook? And the production doesn’t have a nice structure to it."

**Zugtris**: "talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it"

**Therokinrolla**: "Hell yes, an epic track to lead into an epic album. “Some asshole broke me in,” is a really sad lyric with Gaga shedding some light on her sexual abuse. This song is almost anthemic, and its amazing."

**Willybae00**: "I think this song serves as a great opening for the album because it lets you know what to expect overall. A lot of my comments on the songs on this album are the same so I left the fields blank - tracks sound too generic and while personal here and there, are missing an edge. I think Gaga is a talented and great artist with a lot of potential, but this time, she took going 'back to basics' a little too far."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "http://i.imgur.com/z1eNU4f.png"

**twat_brained**: "“Diamond Heart”? More like Diamond certification! THAT’S WHAT THIS SONG DESERVES!" Let's focus on getting a song to Gold first.

**huntyphobic**: "this song makes me want to shake my duct taped titties"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This would have been a great opener, but Gaga's vocals are honestly very mediocre here and so is some of the production. This album would have been so damn great if there wasn't a weird thing going on with Gaga's vocals."

**youknwnothingjonsnow**: "this just sounds so generic, not a fan of her new sound"

**leviOHsa**: "I’m not even American and this makes me feel patriotic af for you crazy eagle people. I mean, I then remember who your current President is, but we all make mistakes…"

**JohnnyToby**: "boring"

**seferre2**: "i'm not ready for gaga to be dragged but at least this song can give me hope"

**ExtraEater**: "Rihanna, Chris Martin, and Lady Gaga have a meeting. 'diamonds,' one said. they wrote about diamonds. pop perfection2012and2016!!!"

**blue_charles**: "Nails the tone that the album's going for, that weird mix of country and something that's distinctly gaga. If you don't get hype when you hear 'young wild American / c'mon baby, do you have a girlfriend?' then what are you doing with your life?"

**eklxtreme**: "love how rocky this is, the guitar and drums pull the tracks together"

**joshually**: "It's not a bad song but when she starts yelling and over articulating that prechorus into the chorus, I'm instantly turned off, like I'm in the middle of watching a porn and without warning, my mom's voice starts to narrate what's happening on screen."

**snidelaughter**: "This was a great pick for an intro. It might not be flawless, but you know its got a diamond heart."

**Yatcho**: "Everyone seems really excited by this song but all I hear is forgotten Kelly Clarkson filler?? This is beyond generic"

**veryunfinished**: "i like this song a lot even though she basically shouts throughout the pre-chorus and chorus. i think the production matches her voice better than it does on most of the album."

**skiddos**: "idk what that wub wub effect is called at the beginning but whatever it is, it rips off all of my hair"

**Macubass**: "so good"

**mokitsu**: "An anthem! Fuck your white horse and a carriage gotta be one of the best one liners of the year. The hum at the end is very anti climatic tho! Sounds like a seal dying!"

**MrSwearword**: "I still can’t stomach this. Even with seeing gogo boys dancing to this at my favorite club, I just can’t stomach this shit. Simply put, it’s an unpleasant listening experience."

**mgglite**: "didn't i just listen to this song like two tracks ago?"

**ProphecyPizza**: "YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS This song is literally EVERYTHING."

**dirdbub**: "best song off of Anti. no competition. so fucking good"

**JunkyGS**: "There is a reason this is her longest charting song! This song oozes confidence that is so contagious to the listener. Definitely a highlight on the album."

**MihaMijat**: "I have no idea why this works, but it does, and it's wonderful"

**enecks**: "Too much annoying effects"

**omgcow**: "I like everything except for the actual chorus. The drawn out “NeeeEEEEeeEEEded me” bothers me"

**calltehshots**: "One of DJ Mustard’s greatest productions and 3 minutes of RIhanna being a complete savage I’m shaking"

**Palutzel**: "meh"

**TonyRealm**: "One of Rih’s “bad bitch” anthems where she basically taunts the poor guy. Don’t like what she does with the ending, and the synths are just okay, but overall it sounds good and if Rihanna says I needed her, then I needed her."

**marcryan**: "It is one of the most unlikely, different songs that I ended up adoring."

**banananaise**: "You know those 'music videos without music' on youtube? This music video without the song would be a huge improvement"

**havanabrown**: "I feel like it's one of those songs that you have to be high to fully appreciate. For me anyway"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "the begininng reminds me of a song from iamamiwhoami"

**superr_rad**: "Um I don't like this song... the 'youuuu neeeeeeeeeeeeeedededed me' is super grating to me, and it's kinda boring, like how did this outperform kiss it better?"

**soeri**: "basic white chick anthem yasss kween (twerks hip bone)"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Kind of overplayed but it’s one of the more unique tracks I think to get big recently, especially from Rihanna. DJ Mustard’s beat is one of his most interesting."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I couldn't give my 11 to anything else when I was jamming out to this months before it was even released"

**bliamc**: "The attitude!! The headache-y synths!! The slinking beat!!"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "i dont need this song existing tbh it's Very Rihanna but the hook is so annoying"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I had never heard this song before and I zoned out halfway through because I was watching a video of a rabbit eating a cake but I don’t want to listen to it again so fuck it I guess it gets a 4 because that seems right"

**Awhile2**: "This songs outro is like a good 40 seconds and i still wish it was longer"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "GOD I LOVE SASSY BITCHY RIHANNA SO MUCH. RIRI ENDED FUCCBOIS."

**DrunkHurricane**: "This is one of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life. That 'woo woo woo woo' effect in the verses is awful, but the worst thing is the synths in the chorus. It's dark but not in an enjoyable way, just in a way that makes me want to never listen to this song again. It's genuinely unsettling."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "hell yess, it's picking up. the opening beats for this song left me hopeful for some fast stuff, but it fizzled out. oh well, better than Kiss It Better"

**Death_Soup**: "Such an incredible song. Rihanna slayed 2016."

**Bannerww**: "here comes the song of the year ladies and gentlemen, Rihanna God bless you"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Baddest Bitch in the game tbh. Don't fuck with her."

**mother_rucker**: "The vibe of this song is so good. A perfect bad bitch anthem."

**Wailordfan**: "Holy fuck slay me bitch. For real, this is amazing shit. The ... I don't know how to say it, those wubs in the opening that fade in and out are so good and the mustard on the beat is I C O N I C."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "You all know this song. Rihanna is back, and bolder than ever, with an electronic-heavy chorus. And it works better than most of the EDM in-and-out synthy instrumentals of a lot of Hot 100 tracks these days. the unrestrained cursing adds a nice element of IDGAF that this song greatly benefits from."

**qetaz**: "It's interesting enough to keep me listening... It's not going on my playlist but I'd totally jam to it at a party/in the club"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "When I first heard this song I was floored. Easily one of her best from her entire career, and a terrific song for this Bad Bitch Rihanna era we're having lately."

**SkyBlade79**: "Pretty great song. She’s emotional, her voice seems extra powerful, and she’s angry; the perfect combination."

**chihuahuazero**: "MOTHA. ON-DA. BEAT. HOE. This single grew on me the most of all the songs on “Anti”, and its run on radio contributes to that. Is the term “slow twerk anthem” appropriate?"

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Pretty catchy."

**misguidedzombie**: "Chorus is an earworm and fun as hell to sing along to."

**Therokinrolla**: "Literally the definition of an ANTIBOP™, the song is slow, goes nowhere, has bland production, and unimpressive vocals. Bye"

**JohnnyToby**: "overplay kinda killed it for me tho…"

**seferre2**: "i was gonna give this a 6 but i listened to it again and i started singing and swaying and i liked it"

**blue_charles**: "Lowkey iconic tbh. 'Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?' That beat makes me feel like a badass woman who don't need no man, and I'm a human disaster of a 17-year-old white wannabe twink, so that's an accomplishment."

**eklxtreme**: "the best part of this is how DJ Mustard synchronizes his producer tag with the synths, 'didn't they tell you that I was a savage' is an iconic quotable line and the way she delivers it makes you want to believe it, although the production is what mostly carries the song"

**joshually**: "The stoned out and almost lackadaisical manner in which she effectively sings this most vicious and scathing and emasculating of songs leads me to believe that Rihanna is basically the HBIC of the music world right now."

**snidelaughter**: "The person that's gonna give this a zero is going to say 'Didn't they tell you I was a savage?', aren't they? Rihanna picked really good singles from the album."

**Yatcho**: "Bad Bitch Rihanna fully realized by DJ Mustard at his best"

**veryunfinished**: "that beat is the best thing dj mustard has ever done, or at least has done in a really really long time. one time in march last year i listened to this song for 5 hours, so i can say for certain that this song is perfect mood music when the mood is “completely fucking out of it”. the way the beat breaks down in the chorus is so perfect. i think rhythmically the vocal melody and the beat are a little bit off but not enough to be annoying, just enough to make it interesting. also this is once again, Such a rihanna song."

**Willybae00**: "I can close my eyes and channel the feelings that this song embodies fairly easily, which makes it so relatable and enjoyable at the same time. It also has a great build up that resembles a real life conversation in which you go from trying to keep it together to letting your emotions out"

**twat_brained**: "The chilled out sound works pretty well with this track, and Rih's vocals complement it nicely. But it charted too high."

Also, I think **ExtraEater**'s is completely out of order now, but here you go: "Work, Women & The City; Robin was dreaming. Did she dream of experiences with a better man? Not quite. Rather, she dreamed of her mother. Her mother was a horse for some reason, but that's an absurd detail that we can hopefully ignore. She said, 'heuohwoehowyegowyge'. Okay, so her mother can't really say anything. Regardless, the point is she was a mighty brown horse and Robin eventually figured out this was a metaphor, but also that it could be greatly misinterpreted. She decided to go on a journey to restore her dream mother to a normal powerful woman instead of a badly executed analogy. She found a magic tree that belonged to a tree company. Of course, a man was probably behind this. She said fuck it, and she stole an apple and she restored her mother back to normal. But the company caught up with her. A lumberjack tried to kill her, but I guess we can skip that, because the dream ended. She woke up to her lover in front of her face. Robin forgot completely about the dream. It was time to work."

For some reason when the album first came out I didn't like this song, but then I listened to it randomly one day and my wig flew. Such a bop! It definitely takes a bit of inspiration from Uptown Funk, but it still feels very Gaga in nature. The production is zany and immaculate, and Gaga herself sounds like she's having the time of her life. Remember when she performed this on SNL and a bunch of people thought the song was called Mirror on the Ceiling? Good times. Is this a single yet?

**VodkaInsipido**: "A-YO? More like B-OP amirite?"

**skiddos**: "Yee haw!"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "giddyup!!!1!!1!"

**Macubass**: "best song tbh"

**mokitsu**: "This is a cute song that got boring after three plays, the lyrics make no sense"

**Rourke_**: "fuck the Chainsmokers (feat. Halsey)"

**MrSwearword**: "This is probably better live even with her vocals being on fire here."

**chubs4life**: "This should've been the lead single. Not the other one."

**dirdbub**: "http://i.imgur.com/Lwmfst9.png"

**JunkyGS**: "I find this song super catchy and love the instruments / production on it."

**MihaMijat**: "The AYO part kills it for me"

**enecks**: "I don’t like the AHOO sounds. Apart from that, it’s good, with some fun guitar."

**estreindre**: "somewhat of a bop but, imho, something about it doesn't feel quite right. it SHOULD be great, but it doesn't do it for me. plus, honestly, i'm a baby so songs so blatantly about marijuana like this make me mildly uncomfortable haha."

**omgcow**: "My dog threw up on my bed while I was listening to this song, and I concur"

**calltehshots**: "Miley's neverending impact"

**eribertknows**: "This ain't no Bad Romance, but it's Gaga nearly at her best. Deserves a video and radio airplay."

**MariahGr8rThnJesus**: "'Hannah Montana: The Movie' reject"

**Palutzel**: "YAAAASS GAGA SLAY ME WITH THIS COUNTRY MUSIC YAAAAAASSSSSSSS (not even ironic)"

**TonyRealm**: "Undeniably catchy, with a ton of funk thrown in for good measure. Some may say excessive, but I love this side of Gaga."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Fun, but sounds like it could belong on a high school musical soundtrack"

**havanabrown**: "If I was a cowboy this would be the song I shoot all the bad guys to"

**arandomgiraffe**: "#GagaEndedTheChainsmokersParty"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this is tolerable"

**spacebabe27**: "I didn't like this as much as everyone else did."

**superr_rad**: "I mean this should really be a single, it's super fun and catchy and she sounds amazing in this."

**soeri**: "MIRROR ON DA CEELENG"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "HEEEEERE WE GO, really was robbed of being the lead single and continues this rock/pop/country fusion that gaga was trying out with this album"

**bliamc**: "A great kiss off tune, a lot of fun"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "HERE WE FUCKIN GO! nonstop ride to fun that never fails to lift my spirits"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "[Queen for respecting the king of the gaming world, Mario!](http://i.imgur.com/Lwmfst9.png)"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Energetic but a bit generic for my tastes"

**triptoyourheart**: "Gaga would be crazy not make this the next single."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Meh"

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "best song on the album. Biggest mistake Gaga made was not releasing this as the lead single."

**Wailordfan**: "Despite people really liking this, I don't love it. Her live performances of it is great, but doesn't save an almost CONSTANT clapping rhythm in the back that just gets annoying tbh. However, guitar solo? Yes please ma'am, give me some more."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Possibly the best chorus on the album. I kinda wish the entire album had the energy and personality of this track, it's truly a bop. Not much more to say."

**qetaz**: "I don’t care what anyone says, it's a bop"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "A fun listen, nothing more. Not shook, not trying to hate it. Sorry gaga."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "nice that the best two songs are at the beginning of the album, after this I get so bored"

**SkyBlade79**: "This song is so infectiously catchy and singable, as Gaga chants 'A-yo, a-yo, we smokin' them all', I’m sure that you’ll want to sing along to it as well.. Gaga's voice in the verses is flirty and dangerously confident; this song can make the nerdiest city kid(me) feel like a cowboy."

**chihuahuazero**: "This is a delightful jam around. Embrace the gravel."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "It’s country pop, but on the better side of the spectrum on this album."

**Zugtris**: "i could not for the life of me stop playing this when it got released, even though i was in a terrible mood at that time. my love for it has subsided a bit since its release/i've overplayed it lol, but it still fucking slaps"

**Therokinrolla**: "I think this track easily had the best shot at being the lead single. The leading verses seem like they could easily be Iconic, blowin it in your face and all that. That leads into a hook that begins an easily chant-able chorus and the “A-YO, A-YO, we smokin’ em all!” that could’ve been heard around the world. But oh no PI was chosen."

**huntyphobic**: "Queen of lung cancer."

**SpanKKy1**: "More like A-NO"

**leviOHsa**: "Heeerreeeee we go. I slowly grew to love this song, and now I’m just kinda meh about it. I don’t know, I just don’t think it has longevity. Maybe if a MV was released I’d be hyped, but for now I’m kinda over it."

**JohnnyToby**: "more interesting?"

**ExtraEater**: "The Wild & Wacky Misadventures of Stefani Germanotta; [music video idea kinda] lush and James Dean, former priests (or side-priests, if that's what they're called) turned fugitives were cruising down a road in the middle of buttfuck desert nowhere, when they stopped by and found a hitchhiker, dressed in strangely clean pink clothes and a cowboy hat. they stopped the car to meet her. 'who are you and have you heard of god?' James Dean, a former priest turned kinda-fugitive he was, was obligated to ask so that god could cleanse her sins...? The woman, however, wasn't merciful on him. she smacked him outright. and lush, who was the driver, said 'what are you doing?!' 'i heard of you two. y'all were priests once, said y'knew god but was lying right through your teeth. i'm about to show you the truth.' suddenly, music came out of nowhere. she yelled 'woo!' and started singing. 'Oh no, this is that flop, Joanna was it?' James Dean said. 'i don't know her,' lush confessed. a bunch of backup dancers rose from the ground. the song continued, and joanne started to smash the car with her guitar. but like the car from the don't let me down music video, it wouldn't move. Lush and James Dean were helpeless like the chainsmokers. Mario came out of a pipe. Joanne said, 'Hit it Mario!' and mario, who sang AYO constantly, threw fireballs at the car and the millions of backup dancers continued to smack the ground with power while wild airplanes painted the sky. 'IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GOT WHAT YOU DESERVED, BOYS' the song had reached its climax, and joanne spun them around until they were dizzy, and she straight up destroyed the car with her psychic energy. Mario started to twerk as a bunch of other Nintendo characters rose up from the ground. It was in all an ultimate dance in the desert. Lady Gaga used her psychic powers to smash Lush and James onto the ground several times. Eventually, it seemed they were dead and the music stopped. The backup dancers and others sang in a choir like in that one Chance the rapper/crayon jesus song, almost as in mourning. Lady Gaga walked over to them, still dressed finely in her pink clothes and hat, and she spit on them. Finally, she summoned fire from her hands and burned them to ashes. TL;DR lady gaga has psychic powers and she uses them to summon nintendo characters and punish fugitive priests in the middle of the desert. and i think this should be the music video for a-yo"

**blue_charles**: "It's actually kinda great, but I'm not as wild as some people are about it."

**eklxtreme**: "her vocals are really great here, strong chorus, funky and danceable, almost reminds me of janelle monae, bluesy guitar and horn section are interesting"

**joshually**: "Is this supposed to be her 'beef' song? It's kind of weak, like biting into a slab of meat only to realize it's bland tofu in disguise. So rude when that happens."

**snidelaughter**: "CAN'T 👏 STOP 👏 SLUT👏DROPPING 👏 TO 👏 THIS 👏 SONG 👏 YIPPIE👏KAY👏YE 👏 MOTHER👏FUCKER 👏👏👏"

**Yatcho**: "Mediocre. Gaga if you want to have anything resembling a hit this era do NOT release this as the next single or the GP will laugh it off the charts"

**veryunfinished**: "somehow this song feels really long, even though it's only 3:30. i really like how foot-stompy the beat to this is."

**Willybae00**: "It reminds me of a filler song in a Carrie Underwood album."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of making The Chainsmokers think they're relevant enough to have a diss track about them"

@**twat_brained**: "This is the best country-influenced song to hit the charts this year alongside Daddy Lessons. Don’t you dare @ me."

This track just could have been that 3-second sound clip of Beyonce SCREAMING that line and it would still get a 10. Possibly the greatest one-liner of her career. Also yada yada it's a great song that perfectly exemplifies rage yet cleverly twists it as a threat or warning to her husband that she's not the only one going to get hurt yada yada. What's more important is that WHO DA FUQ DO U THINK I AM??!?!?!?!??! Ugh, so good.
[/r/popheads/comments/5s1rn8/the_ultimate_2016_album_rate_day_2_take_your_seat/ddbzzqg/]

=====

letsallpoo: 
**BionicFunhouse**: "The passion in this song gets me every time. This one will never get old."

**VodkaInsipido**: "If someone told me in the BEYONCÉ era that she was going to dive into rock, I would call him crazy. Also the 'WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I IS, I SMELL THAT FRAGANCE IN YOUR LOUIS KNIT BOY, JUST GIVE MY FAT ASS A BIG KISS BOY' line is amazing."

**melisanyans**: "Endlessly quotable, messy in a good way, makes me want to burn down the house and slash the tires of the cheating boyfriend I’ve never had."

**skiddos**: "we /r/rockheads now"

**Macubass**: "its ok"

**mokitsu**: "I love this ROCK song, it's so energetic and makes me so pumped, especially when Bey starts screaming in the third verse! The bad bitch anthem of the year."

**Rourke_**: "Beyonce is wounded and enraged and terrifying and I have been scalped, the best song on her best album"

**MrSwearword**: "It took me several listens to vibe with this at all. Jack White’s contributions at first dwarfed Bey’s by a MILE but then I realized, this is Beyonce legitimately exploring and adding her twist on “rock” music. Not like black women haven’t done rock before, but let’s face it, no one expected “Beyonce” and “rock music” to be uttered in the same sentence."

**mgglite**: "i thought i finished listening to anti"

**JamesTheGent**: "The pure anger coming from Bey on this is great."

**dirdbub**: "FUCK THIS GOES OFFF"

**JunkyGS**: "Invented rock music. The most fun song to sing a long to and pretend you are breaking up with your multi millionaire partner."

**enecks**: "Damn this song sounds good. Beyoncé absolutely sells the passionate rage in this song."

**estreindre**: "a reaaally good rock song with KILLER production on it. my only problem is that her voice sounds not great at parts of it."

**omgcow**: "This reminds me of Ring the Alarm, which coincidentally is my favorite Beyonce song."

**calltehshots**: "If it wasn’t for the sickening “If you try this shit again, you gon lose your wife” lines at the end, this would be completely unmemorable."

**Palutzel**: "it's an interesting song, but a bit strange"

**TonyRealm**: "This song really grew on me, it’s ferocious."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "Fine song, but it's just not as good as 6 inch heels. Plus it's hard to take you seriously when you sing “As I bounce to the next dick, boy”."

**havanabrown**: "The anger certainly came through loud and clear but it just felt messy"

**spacebabe27**: "As soon as she says 'WHO THE FUCK YOU THINK I IS' i feel as if the entirety of the gays just fell to their floors and remained there for and entire 3 minutes and 54 seconds."

**superr_rad**: "Yas queen flipping genres like they’re low income houses in a steadily growing metropolitan area."

**soeri**: "me @ anyone who gives britney their 11"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I gotta give this song credit, it’s one of the most unique songs on a major pop album this year. It’s kind of a genre mix with the most garage/blues rock Beyonce has ever sounded and some great instrumentation and vocals from Jack White. This song has SO MUCH energy, it’s great. When Bey yells WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I AM my weave gets snatched. Makes me miss the White Stripes tbh."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Bey does rock, and it works"

**bliamc**: "It’s so much to sing (scream) in the shower, and the ending is ICONIC. IF YOU TRY THIS SHIT AGAIN YOU GONNA LOSE YOUR WIFE"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "who the FUCK doesn't like this song???!!!!"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "Yah"

**Awhile2**: "sorry bey but alicia keys had the better jack white collab"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The rock-influnced production matches well with Beyonce's angry vocals."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "really don't like her vocals in this but that's no reason to rate it lower than anti"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "she better win the rock Grammy pls."

**BEARS_WILL_EAT_YOU**: "this reminds me of Woo"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "“Love god herself” I C O N I C"

**mother_rucker**: "The second verse is one of my favorite parts of this entire album. “I’m the dragon breathing fire” feels like she’s breathing fire into my soul."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Who knew Jack White and Beyoncé would make such a riveting duo? I was shook when I saw that the album dropped and even more shook when I saw the tracklist. Don't Hurt Yourself is one of the best songs on the album, and one of the best songs Yonce has ever done. It's angry, with a confidence that dances with some back and forth guitar riffs that not only feels genuine, but natural. This is versatility at her best, and even if there's too many cooks in the kitchen, the dish they presented me with punched me in the face and I'm all in more love with it that I should be."

**qetaz**: "Not into the heavy rock sound and the really high vocals"

**Reifiui**: "We know that Beyoncé is capable of sounding wild and dangerous, but this? Holy shit this song is almost terrifying with how she shows a kind of fury that she never reached with her music before, not to that extent at least, and that blues-rock instrumentation got me FUCKING BALD THIS SONG MY GOD"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "Maybe I'm just holding a grudge against this getting a nom in a rock category for the grammys. Maybe it is just a mediocre song."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "just cannot get into what they did to her vocals in this why wreck something already so good????????"

**SkyBlade79**: "This is pretty great. She’s like a dragon and it’s amazing. I feel sorry for anyone on the other side of her anger."

**chihuahuazero**: "On a personal scale, “Don’t Hurt Yourself” is a Lemonade highlight. It’s a refreshing fusion of rock and R&B that doesn’t come off as cheesy, as Beyonce is so raw and obscene with her delivery. “I smell that fragrance on your Louis knit, boy,” anyone? Remember, love God herself."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "Quite interesting and different production for a pop song."

**Zugtris**: "legit ripped out my vocal chords during the lemonade wt when i tried to belch the final 'toniGHT IM FUCKIN UP ALL YOUR SHIT BOII'"

**misguidedzombie**: "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and trust Beyoncé to make a great song out of it."

**Therokinrolla**: "Yes! This is what I came to this album for, its entirely unapologetic in tone and Yoncé’s voice slays. The first song to slay me on the album, actually."

**huntyphobic**: "WHO DA FUCK DO YOU THINK I IS?"

**SpanKKy1**: "This song makes me want to hurt myself"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The fact that Beyonce sampled a Led Zeppelin song with Jack White astounds me. The fact that it was actually good astounds me more."

**leviOHsa**: "This is one of my favourite Beyonce songs. So much passion, she kills it. “You ain’t married to no average bitch, boy” ICONIC."

**seferre2**: "cringey but i'm pumped now"

**ExtraEater**: "2004 TABLOID REPORT, IS JACK WHITE CHEATING ON MEG WITH BEYONCE????????"

**blue_charles**: "ok but no this song goes the fuck off. Like I will actually fucking punch a bitch if you get in my way during #thatpart. You know what part I'm talking about. #THATPART"

**VioletChutzkee**: "Werk @ Bey tackling a completely different genre and completely nailing it! Take notes, Joanne. Oh, and this song is hot. I wish I were sexy so that I could move my body to it in a compelling fashion."

**eklxtreme**: "nice instrumentation, her vocals get really good at the end"

**joshually**: "The vocals through a ham radio filter to represent analog and indieness is so tired, like me after doing two back to back Barry's Bootcamp classes."

**snidelaughter**: "I hurt Beyonce and I can't do anything about it and I'm so sorry and please end my life Queen B"

**-dolantello-**: "beyonce has never sounded more aggressive and i love it"

**veryunfinished**: "she really got a grammy nom for this. ugly foo fighters fans nationwide are shook!"

**Willybae00**: "This sounds more like early to mid 00s rock… I picture see Yellowcard, Third Eye Blind, or one of those other bands singing this track."

**THE_PE_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "'Dont Hurt Yourself?' girl, I just did the emo rate it's gonna be hard"

**twat_brained**: "The beat is pretty good but the vocals just feel too harsh. Also I don't consider Jack to be necessary on the vocals."

**ImADudeDuh**: "I have never been in a relationship, yet this makes me feel like slashing my ex's tires and shitting in the seats."

Somehow Bey released one of the greatest country songs last year, but I'm not complaining. I like to think that this is the most concrete evidence we have that the narrative of Lemonade is meant to be a fabrication, since this song really doesn't make sense in the context of her life. Namely the fact that her dad isn't dead. Like that's kind of a big thing to sing about when it's not true. But I think the essence of the song is still accurate to her life; the details in how her father raised her to be a strong woman, even though he himself preyed on weak women. He's her mentor, but he's also the kind of person she's supposed to avoid. It makes the narrative all the more tragic, since it means she failed her Daddy Lesson by getting deceived by her husband. An absolute 10/10 track. Also, I belive this notes the first time Naps didn't give his 11 to absolute garbage since 'Springsteen'.

---

**JoeThaMo**: "Stick to pop"

**BionicFunhouse**: "This song exceeded my expectations, my absolute favorite from the album."

**melisanyans**: "It's just... too long. Feels inauthentic."

**skiddos**: "Really love how this album has so many different genres"

**Macubass**: "i hate country music"

**mokitsu**: "Well I never cared about country music but I'm not gonna lie this made me look at the Country section of Apple Music to see what's in store. Obviously nothing is as good as this masterpiece about Bey's childhood and being trained since a child to be a musician."

**MrSwearword**: "I suppose the guitar work is cute, but for all the risk taking she did, country could have been left off the table. Keep in mind this is the same Beyonce who once sang on “Daddy”, “I want my husband/to be like my Daddy” so I’ll give Lessons credit for what I think is her shattering the “daddy” complex."

**Bingcrusher**: "Easily best song of the year."

**chubs4life**: "This song could make a child of a lesbian couple have daddy issues. Iconic."

**mgglite**: "why do all the songs on this album take so long to start properly"

**ProphecyPizza**: "....Joanne did country better tho"

**dirdbub**: "never thought that Bey would pull off the country song of the century, but then again, this IS Beyonce, soo......."

**JunkyGS**: "so out of place sonic-ally on the album. But invented country music."

**MihaMijat**: "Invented country"

**enecks**: "Did country better than Joanne. Granted, Joanne wasn’t entirely going for country, but still."

**estreindre**: "negl, i was REALLY shocked to listen to this song for the first time and find out it wasn't a sex song about beyonce and her 'daddy.' IT'S SOOOO GOOD THOUGH the production is fantastic and beyonce's voice is really suited to country."

**omgcow**: "Beyonce did country better than Gaga ever could, but that’s not exactly high praise."

**calltehshots**: "Joanne WISHES"

**Joebiekong**: "Joanne did it better"

**Palutzel**: "those vocals are wow, the song is pretty good too"

**TonyRealm**: "At this point, what genre can’t Bey do? (maybe metal lol) I love the loose, lively production and the brass instruments + sax solo are fire."

**CarlyRaeJepsensBitch**: "This was the most instantly catchy song, but wore out the fastest"

**havanabrown**: "holy shit this gave me literal chills it’s so good! I would kill for a country Bey album and I don’t even like country"

**spacebabe27**: "This is everything I needed Beyonce to release. As a little black, gay boy from Texas this song hits home, because the narrative of the advice her father is giving her is exactly how I grew up and I never thought Beyonce of all artists would put out something I could relate so heavily to."

**superr_rad**: "THE best country song released in years. Fight me."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Lana’s fave song from this album"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "See Don't Hurt Yourself, but replace rock with country, seriously though I love when artists pull off genre crossovers"

**bliamc**: "BEYOND MADE A COUNTRY SONG. THAT’S RIGHT. AND GUESS WHAT?? IT’S THE BEST COUNTRY SONG OF THE YEAR."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "joanne is shook"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I feel like I should give a reason why this is getting an 11 but I don’t really have one. It’s just a good song, and the first since from Beyonce that I’ve LOVED since Sasha Fierce. I mean, Yah."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Wow Beyonce queen of writing her own songs. When will Joanne ever??????? /s"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "love the guitar sound, grew on me big time"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Carrie Underwood has been snatched"

**mother_rucker**: "Joanne wishes"

**Wailordfan**: "I'm sorry, but the yee-haws is too 'try-hard' imo. I'm all for the variety of genres, but there is a point where it becomes a bit too... self-aware?"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "A great Louisiana-inspired country track. I almost wish she would make a full album of this, there's a potential she could out-Joanne Lady Gaga if she gave it a chance. Don't hurt me for that."

**qetaz**: "a great song, I love country Beyonce"

**Reifiui**: "This is the closest this sub is going to be to liking a country song isn't it? Eh considering the quality of it I'm not too mad"

**TheKneesOfOurBees**: "This>>>>>>>any song from Joanne"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "whenever I listen to this I imagine myself singing it to my ex bf from when I was 16 who used to go flirt with other girls to piss me off f u boy"

**SkyBlade79**: "As far as country goes, this is is pretty dang good."

**LuigiEatsPopcorn**: "AHAHAHAHA THIS IS A BETTER COUNTRY SONG THAN ALL OF JOANNE AND BEY ONLY DID IT FOR ONE SONG AND GAGA TRIED A WHOLE ALBUM"

**Therokinrolla**: "Can we rename this rate the country rate? Joanne and this song made me like a little more country than I did before and while thats criminal I love this song anyways."

**huntyphobic**: "Literally invented the country genre, Before He Cheats who?"

**SpanKKy1** makes his most creative joke yet: "Shawn Mendes lessons"

**JohnnyToby**: "couldn’t decide for a 6 or 8 so 6.8"

**seferre2**: "'this song makes me want to do a drive by on a horse' joanne who? but in all seriousness a contender for my 11"

**ExtraEater**: "⭐⭐💕💕⭐⭐DADDY⭐⭐⭐💕💕🐼🐼🐼 (if emojis crash the program you can just remove this)". They don't, for better or for worse.

**blue_charles**: "Better country than half of Joanne tbh"

**VioletChutzkee**: "Werk @ Bey tackling a completely different genre and nailing it, and all while not resorting to using an annoying vocal affectation to convey 'country'! Take notes, Joanne."

**eklxtreme**: "very new orleans, the country influence works well, great all around"

**joshually**: "She was really tryin to hit all the genres with lemonade wasn't she. This song is better country than all of Joanne which is sort of tragic yet fitting when you really think about it."

**snidelaughter** BREAKS THE SUB RULES: "👌👀👌🍋👌👀👌🍋👌👀 good shit go౦ԁ sHit👌 thats ✔ some good👌👌shit right👌👌there👌👌👌 right🍋there ✔🍋if i do ƽaү so my self 💯 i say so 💯 thats what im talking about right there right there (chorus: ʳᶦᵍʰᵗ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ) mMMMMᎷМ💯 👌👌 👌НO0ОଠOOOOOОଠଠOoooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒ👌 👌👌 👌 💯 👌 👀 🍋 👀 👌👌Good shit🍋🍋🍋". I thought emojipastas were banned.

**veryunfinished**: "beyonce saved country music. i always think i don't like this song that much and then i listen to it and i'm reborn. i love everything about this song but i love the trumpets on this especially."

**Willybae00**: "The vocals make me think of Carrie Underwood. I feel like Beyonce has established a sound for herself that suits her perfectly and this just doesn’t feel like Beyonce to me. Even if Carrie sang it, I wouldn’t listen to the song more than once"

**twat_brained**: "Beyoncé invented country music. Don't you dare try to tell me otherwise."
