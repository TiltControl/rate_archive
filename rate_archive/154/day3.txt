Songeniality Winner (voted "most robbed" of the rate) The Saturdays - All Fired Up
=================================================================================
=================================================================================
=================================================================================

vch01: We need some proper respect to this QUEENLY rate - user flair for all the groups involved. Think of it as the local equivalent of commemorative post stamps.

=====

fakeaf1: I’m still shaking at Gentlemen not being the lowest ranking song by The Saturdays in this rate
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipul8x2/]

=====

throwaway-7650: deserved to be the highest saturslays song
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipumug1/]

=====

fakeaf1: Me talking about Work if it was in the rate

=====

hoolytoledo: If only UP was included on this rate instead..

BleepBloopMusicFan: Speak that truth.

=====

throwaway-7650: my all saints scores were pretty ruthless but I hope pure shores can sneak into the top 10 at least
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipumxz2/]

=====

hoolytoledo: All I want from this rate is a Girls Aloud v Sugababes top 2 (Biology v About You Now preferably).  Have the two biggest UK girl groups of the noughties duke it out.
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipungzd/]

=====

throwaway-7650: I have bad news about... about you now. I wouldn't mind a biology win though!
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipuoasu/]

=====

vch01: Biology vs Pure Shores, perhaps
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipuosrw/]

=====

throwaway-7650: if pure shores is anywhere near the top 2 I will cheer so hard, it was one of my 11 contenders. given how early black coffee left yesterday though...
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipup86w/]

=====

hoolytoledo: I absolutely wouldn’t mind a Pure Shores win either !! There’s just so many good contenders in this rate. I even wouldn’t be surprised if Scandalous takes this since Mis-Teeq (surprisingly) have been doing so well on this rate.
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipupaia/]

=====

throwaway-7650: scandalous is seen as the favorite to win by some, I'm not as confident but it would be a really slayful winner tbh
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipupy9h/]

=====

hoolytoledo: Lol it’s fine if it doesn’t make the top 2, I’m fine with either Sugababes song that’s left really. Both groups have a really strong discography.
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipuoxwk/]

=====

throwaway-7650: I gave about you now a 10, however it has quite a few antis (see the performance of miranda cosgrove's version in the [disney/nick rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/xhqua3/comment/iozh4pl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) so I expect it to go out pretty early today. freak like me/push the button would be my ideal sugababes winners, though that's probably not an unpopular opinion. but when it's right it's right!
[/r/popheads/comments/xnpnhh/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_onerate/ipupldg/]

=====

hoolytoledo: I honestly wasn’t aware of Miranda’s version until I saw that rate!  So yes, you do have a point… ah that’s so unfortunate.

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Some of you are afraid of the avant-garde

**flavasavavandal** (1): hyperpop was a mistake if this makes day 3

---

**agentofscranton** (10): genuinely genuinely ahead of it's time

**BaconShoes** (10): The world wasn’t ready for this banger

**bbfan132** (10): excellence

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Putting this in my industrial bops playlist with Closure and Ice Cream.

**cherryices** (10): this album deserved SO much better.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): a camp classic, this deserves to win the bonus

**daretheghost** (10): AHEAD OF ITS TIME!!! STREAM CINDERELLA’S EYES!!!

**letsallpoo** (10): this aged both horribly and amazingly. i still think that if popheads existed when her album came out she would've been our carly

**Melody** (10): Nicola went out and created a classic nobody expected from ha, fans were confused.. the GP were angry.. yet this song only got stronger. I will be the beat of Nicolas drum if I was asked.

**moonagenightmares** (10): BANGERRRRRRR

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): The Normani of the UK

**plastichaxan** (10): this bonus is so camp thank you

**qazz23** (10): really catchy and energetic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the absolute smasha!!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): CAMP!!! Nicola would have been a Sub Fave if Popheads was around in 2011 tbh

**Stryxen** (10): it's just so slay

**thedoublebanana** (10): This entire album and the b-sides need recognition. Nicola really deserves so much more recognition and credit.

**thegolding** (10): Nicola is an amazing singer, songwriter and producer. She needs to release an album again

**throwaway-7650** (10): ...just increasing the controversy score

**welcome2thejam** (10): "Gentleman is the wildest song in this rate" Hold my mf drum

**celladonn** (9): this beat goes crazy actually

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): She’s like a long lost member of K/DA

**Marvelous2002** (9): She blossomed so much towards the end of Girls Aloud and with her solo, I wish the spotlight was shared more evenly in the group. Listened to her debut a couple of years ago and was impressed, she's a great songwriter. Also her vocals during Masked Singer? I need new material from her

**kappyko** (8): TUNE YARDS????????

**mysario** (8): I'm trying my best

**robincav** (7.5): High camp

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): the carly rae jepsen of uk girl group alumni but only for this song

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): fantastic chorus, shame the rest is just Diplo slumming it

**nt96** (7): this High School Musical ass soundscape

**TCHALLA1966** (7): well she did sumn

**bogo** (6): this sounds like a cher lloyd song

**criestotheclicking** (6): this is interesting. Nicola was always my favourite GA member but I don’t like it as much as I remember.

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): This is totally hyperpop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): Song's fine, but fuck Diplo

**Smuckles** (5): Nicola was unfairly bullied by the media and teenagers alike for being ginger. A pain I know all too well! This song is no more shit than anything the Ting Tings did.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this is like if you made a cishet person sing a sophie song

**starla\_** (3.5): the chorus is really annoying

**MrSwearword** (2): if it weren't for the two left feet in the video, I would've forgiven the song for the ambition alone

**TiltControls** (2): the voices in the background sound like they came right out of animal crossing

**indie\_fan\_** (1): one upon a time, I pressed “skip now”, three seconds in… idk what else to rhyme with “in”, point is this song caused permanent damage on my eardrums and I want to send Nicola the hospital bill for what she did to my hearing

**seanderlust** (1): i'm so sorry besties i truly cannot stand this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): The music video gives me Destiny’ Child vibes, somewhere between Bootylicious and Jumpin’ Jumpin. Also still dying that they performed this song at a Nickelodeon’s Choice award helppp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU4yHn8_5Zo

# Love that they give this a shoutout in Scandalous

**cancersgroove** (11): when you hear them violins play, shit’s about to get real

**MrSwearword** (10): the video added a certain...charm to the song that otherwise I wouldn't have cared about.

**Stryxen** (10): HIGH CLASS. NICE ASS. twerk

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): THEY'RE STARTING THE VIDEO WITH THEIR LAST SONG OMG YESS. and then they get all the guys at the end. rock on.

**stbrigidiscross** (9.5): This is when they really showed their ability, they got an actual budget for the video and the song is really good.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): this is great while not sounding like a nightcore edit

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): mv version SLAYED

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): this kinda makes the sound of a one night stand appealing ngl

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): this instrumental is so mischievous, like jerry would sneak (or strut because mis-teeq slays) out of his mouse to do whatever they do in the cartoon idk i havent watched it since i was literally 6 years old

**BaconShoes** (9): a bop

**BeauMeringue212** (9): ridiculously catchy chorus

**welcome2thejam** (9): Wait why are they telling me to grab a man?

**daretheghost** (8.5): This really hits that nostalgic sweet spot for me.

**StarSquash45** (8.5): i am a slut for slutty violins

**1998tweety** (8): cant relate

**akanewasright** (8): tbh this feels a bit “more of the same” with their last few singles, with less to make third stand out, but it’s still very good

**amr** (8): the love of the music is the powerhouse of the membrane

**Melody** (8): very sexy ladies.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): this song walked so scandelous could run

**qazz23** (8): neat synth runs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): they were so evil for not putting that music video remix on streaming

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I love the unique sound but definitely could've been more memorable

**bbfan132** (7): not my favorite from them but still pretty good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Okay apparently they’re not saying “full clit.”

**CrimsonROSET** (7): so many songs about one night stands in this rate

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The picky producer nerd in me wishes they used a better snare than that awful crossstick one (and they DID in the US version!) but other than that, great song. Excellent bridge from Sabrina and of course Alesha slays it with her verse.

**Smuckles** (7): The big epic strings. Remember when the entirety of 2000's mainstream hip-hop had these exact strings?

**TiltControls** (7): this sounds like a murder mystery film score

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Where is the beat switch that was in the music video?? >:(

# Loves that they reference this it in Scandalous as “not a one night stand” because they were so much better by that point

**Amazon4life** (6): Sounds kinda like Invitation by Blue (not sure which came first).

**criestotheclicking** (6): oooh the Y2K fits in the music video. Also the concept of different edits for different radio stations is really cool.

**Marvelous2002** (6): Have they lost a member??? I can't tell but I think so? Wait Alesha Dixon was in Mis-Teeq????? She has quite a few solo bops

**uberpigeon** (6): these have all kind of gone in one ear out the other... which is fine because at least its not an earlobe assult like some other artists!

**starla\_** (5.5): this is okay but a little all over the place

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5): Mis-Teeq at their worst sound like in-universe music from Girls5eva

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): this song is so theatrical and for what

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): if you were a young kid in the 2000s in the UK, this song and In The Middle were played at every birthday party you attended, sorry i don’t make the rules

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): Yeah this sounds just like Round Round (but not as good imo). Xenomania created the original demo track of Round Round so did they really just recycle this idea when they went to the studio to make Hole in the Head? 😭

---

# Misses this song like a Hole in the Head

**akanewasright** (10): These lyrics are dumb as hell but when it grooves like this, it doesn’t matter

**Amazon4life** (10): Still sounds so fresh!

**amr** (10): music to listen to while walking on a big bouncy ball in the middle of a lake and trying not to fall off

**oscarbrierley1** (10): a bop, but still has the sugababes vibe. The bassline in the bridge is so good.

**robincav** (10): One of my favourite songs ever, and my favourite on the list. The first 4 lines get me in such a unique headspace

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): I love when they find the sleazy backstage green room shenanigans of the underground venue. WHERE do these videos take place? what's our thematic vibe/aesthetic that each of these groups is occupying? like I seriously thought this was all stuff from 1999-2001 but it doesn't matter it mostly all just vibes no biggie.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I hate the phrase “hole in the head” but I’m boppin!

**bogo** (9): i'd rather die than give you control

**qazz23** (9): cool dancey sound with reggae influence

**Stryxen** (9): infectious hook unfortunately. something about all these groups is when they start ooo-ing in their choruses, it's about to be the catchiest song you've ever heard for the next 4 minutes

**nt96** (8.8): If a girl ever told me she'd rather sell her ass than think of me, I'd exile myself to Mars via SpaceX rocket

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): what the fuck does this mean

**BaconShoes** (8.5): bopping

**bbfan132** (8.5): dancing to this

**daretheghost** (8.5): Very yass & slay

**starla\_** (8.5): my friend made me a mix CD in primary school with this song on it

**stbrigidiscross** (8.5): I really like this "I'd sell my ass before I'd think of you" is a really bold lyric that I don't think anyone can deliver like Mutya.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I was middle of the road on this one until the rap verse, that took it to another level.

**Melody** (8): wouldn't you be dead if you had a hole in your head?

**MrSwearword** (8): the beefcakes in the video can't make up for the fact that the imaging and song do not match up.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Love the danciness of this one, excellent song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): never thought id ever listen to a song that sings hole in the head so catchy and beautiful

**1998tweety** (7.5): what it feels like sometimes

**CrimsonROSET** (7): but how did he hang up the telephone

**Marvelous2002** (7): Woah what is this? I like it quite a bit. That fashion though

**seanderlust** (7): (old man muppet voice) you know there's a difference between this and a hole in the head...if i had a hole in the head, i wouldn't have to listen to this! OOOOHOHOHOHOHO!

**Smuckles** (7): I mean it's still a great chorus, though does lose a point for being Round Round v2 a little.

**StarSquash45** (7): love it but i wish it had a bit more energy

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I’d really only listen to this for the chorus

**TiltControls** (6.5): It's alright, but I haven't been wowed by any of their previous songs yet

**fadedblue09** (6): A bit forgettable, but their vocals save it

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): you miss me like a hole in the head? what does that even mean

# Also misses this song like a Hole in the Head

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): yes there's a hole in my head called the mouth and I want to use it in multiple ways for the purposes o- [gunshots]

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): my boyfriend just compared the sugababes to frank ocean

**ImADudeDuh** (3): WHAT DOES THAT MEAN???

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): MY TIME! SHOW TIME! HOOK LINE! LET’S ROLL! LET’S RIDE!!! Happy to see that after my rate manifestation caused the B With Me Bump N Flex remix to finally get put on streaming. Thank you Grant Nelson for your iconic Bump N Flex remix with the added steel drums, spacey whooshing sounds and Alesha’s most ICONIC Twista-fast rap bridge! At this point I should be hosting the unreleased songs rate ~~tk I don’t want to host that I am just joking~~

**akanewasright** (10): MY TIME! SHOW TIME! HOOK LINE! LET’S GO LET’S RIDE

**amr** (10): "how many times have U led someone astray" jesus said this to judas BTW

**apatel27** (10): go on Alesha

**Awkward\_King** (10): alesha dixon you will always be famous

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this song is a proper trip i love it so much

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This kinda feels like a remix of “All I Want,” they reuse a lot of the same structures and production quirks… like it literally opens with the words “all I want.” Still good though!

**MrSwearword** (10): they did not have to go this fucking hard on this song

**nt96** (10): you changed the song into the remixed version and it slayed even harder?? How????

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): This goes HARD!

**plastichaxan** (10): how can they make collapse after collapse they’re not letting the other girl groups breathe

**RandomHypnotica** (10): THAT STEEL DRUM IS SO FUCKING SLAY OH MY GOD!!!!

**seanderlust** (10): this music video is so good but also so early 2000s i'm hollering

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i feel so sorry for everyone doing this rate who isnt watching the youtube videos

**throwaway-7650** (10): they didn't ask to be born latina. MI GENTE LATINO!

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): i was undervaluing this at a 9.7 bc i wasn't in the tipsy, "GIVE ME A RAGGAE FLOW DELIVERY" mindset. ugh i just fucking wish we got more pop music that went as apeshit as this.

**celladonn** (9.5): another huge bop

**robincav** (9.5): Best rap

**cancersgroove** (9): hated the remix at first but now it EATSSS

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): oh damn proto-dubstep

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Mis-Teeq - B with Me: 9 Alesha's rap in this is iconic, one of the best beat switches of all time. Also I LOVE the horns that pop up every so often! (This is for the Bump & Flex remix btw)

**qazz23** (9): cool horns in this

**stbrigidiscross** (9): The song isn't the strongest "when we cross round the corner at the photo booth" is wordy nonsense, but the girls elevate the material to the level that you don't care. Alesha's verse on this is her absolute best and the girls really deliver the choreo in the video. I love this one

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): is this like one of those internet acronyms

**DirtyRat583** (8.9): t his bops but why is this so much quicker than the original 😭 this is like the travelator edit or something idk

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): That freakin’ beat switch

**1998tweety** (8.5): MY TIME SHOW TIME HOOK LINE LETS ROLL LETS RIDE

**Stryxen** (8.5): this is awesome it sounds sped up but it works

**BaconShoes** (8): a sleek jam

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the thing about me is that i love a song with a good horn section

**daretheghost** (8): Okay while the music video mix DOES slap, I think I prefer the slower vibe of the Spotify version.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Adultery bop

**TiltControls** (7.5): love those steel drums in the background

**Luxaria** (7): The rap bit is a bit jarring but I bet the song would be boring without it

**Marvelous2002** (7): I didn't know anything about them before this,I would've put them in the same vein as All Saints but they're so much more interesting, All Saints I'm sorry but I might have to downgrade some of your scores

**Melody** (7): the garage vibes >>>>>>

**StarSquash45** (7): this sounds like a Rhythm Heaven song (well, Rhythm Paradise in the UK)

**bbfan132** (6.5): i don’t dislike this but it’s kind of boring compared to their other songs

**BeauMeringue212** (6.5): Alesha's verse carries tbh

**oscarbrierley1** (6): idk neither version of this song really works for me. They're fine, but not stand out.

# “Let Me Evict You” from the rate

**starla\_** (5.5): decent

**Amazon4life** (5): At this point all of their songs are blurring together. This one sounds like Destiny's Child.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): What I want is for Mis-Teeq to slow tf down on some of these songs.

**fadedblue09** (4): Other than the spitfire rap bridge, this is quite forgettable from their other songs here.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): they just put all of the percussion in this song huh

**MassiveThief** (2): i audibly laughed at the rap break

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): Sigh. I already explained myself in my LAND comment, but yes, I explicitly put this song here once I saw that the Miranda Cosgrave cover was in LAND and that SEVERAL popheads completely adored the song in general. I’m old as shit and I cannot relate!!! Look, L-ke notwithstanding, I think this song is just BAD in general. That awful, scratchy drum sound??? Did he sample a Dinosaur Jr. track (I would hope if that were the case it would be more slay). And a similarly awful sounding synth throughout. Even when the Sugababes are selling it throughout the song and Keisha at the very end, something about the vocal processing still sounds synthetic in a particularly unpleasant way here. It really feels inorganic to the Sugababes vision. Gonna just end this rant on a rude note to say I think y’all like this cuz you heard it when you were like 8.

**flavasavavandal** (0): this isn’t really a Sugababes song, of the original three only Keisha is left, and while Heidi was never my favourite, she was certainly more competent than the whoever they replaced Mutya with (the fact they re-recorded the later singles from Taller In More Ways to remove Mutya’s presence even further was already a petty move) but by this point the Sugababes were dead, just an engine used to generate flavourless hits. And this might be the worst. Featuring garbage and fucking incompetent production from a monster who doesn’t deserve to be named. The Sugababes’ presence and personality feels straight up removed. I just hate this song, And to the surprise of no one, including myself, it makes day 3 despite the 0. When darj was brainstorming this rate with British people she knows, I intentionally left this song out of any suggestions in hopes she either never knew it, forgot about it, or also didn’t want to include this song too. It dropped my entire average for the group by over 1. I won’t even forgive you About You Now

# “well” - flava

**agentofscranton** (11): is this kinda basic compared to their other songs? sure. but does it absolutely fuck hard harder than a nuclear bomb? absofuckinlutely.

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): im doing this rate in a library and its hard to resist the urge to shake some ass in front of a whole bunch of college students

**moooo566** (11): i was actually 12 when this came out but it feels like ive known it my whole life. always in the rotation too, because it owns.

**TCHALLA1966** (11): I saw tweets the other day that said Miranda Cosgrave version of this song was better than the original and this is why the world hate Americans cause what the actual fuck are y’all smoking I know the girls didn’t make it over there but let’s NOT LIE! Ugh anyway when this song dropped was the last good day in the UK gone downhill since

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): I can't believe they covered this iCarly song

**TiltControls** (11): It's not going to happen, but it'd be hilarious if the same song won twice in a month. Anyways this song just makes me feel joyous to the extreme which is why it gets the 11.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Definitely yass kweening with pride right now.

**DirtyRat583** (10): the first song i ever scrobbled 🫶

**hoolytoledo** (10): another contender that I would’ve given as my 11, but would be happy if this makes top 5 at least

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Why does Keisha look exactly like GGGB Rihanna in this video

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this sounds cheap af but it's still great idc

**robincav** (10): op perfection even with 1/3 of the original lineup and him as a producer

**StarSquash45** (10): i always thought this was by Kelly Clarkson omg

**uberpigeon** (10): 10 year old me crossing out the boys name in my hannah montana diary then throwing it across the room and crying rolling around on my bed. that never happened to me but its the alternate life i envision for myself when i hear this song

**1998tweety** (9): this sounds like an early Demi song

**Luxaria** (9): I don't think it's nostalgia, this really is that good.

**Melody** (9): A BANGERRR

**Stryxen** (9): put the sugababes in EE ER

**vivaforever597** (9): I really don't want to give a Dr. Puke song a good score, but it's so good, and co-written by my queen Cathy Dennis…

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): yeah another classic

**moonagenightmares** (8): why does this sound like debut 1d

**mysario** (8): thinking about how all the same people who gave Kiss Me More a low score because Dr Puke was on it will be giving this other Dr Puke song 10s and 11s (plus Miranda's version outsold which was produced by Benny Blanco who was heavily involved in Eastside basically what I'm saying is stream Halsey)

**BaconShoes** (7.5): y2k vibes for sure

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): a fun song, but it just doesn't feel like a sugababes song.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Good song, but fuck Dr. Luke.

**bogo** (7): kinda sounds familiar but i don't know why

**Marvelous2002** (7): London.

**MrSwearword** (7): lol at the shade of putting the most prominent Amelle song after "Ugly" on the ballot. The song itself is cute.

**qazz23** (7): decent electropop, has a bit of a distorted production

**stbrigidiscross** (6.5): no Sugababes edge

**kaanew** (6): this is a demi lovato song and you can’t convince me otherwise

**Smuckles** (6): Haha, I forgot that they did a landfill indie song. My people!

**apatel27** (5): This sounds like something The Saturdays would sing

**CrimsonROSET** (5): if I had a nickel for everytime we rated this song this month I’d have two nickels

# people who get it

**akanewasright** (4): I genuinely hate the way drums sound so much, I would probably like the song without them

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): I already forgot what I gave this in LAND

**Roxieloxie** (1): why was this recorded via a nintendo ds lite

**starla\_** (1): so annoying

**WaneY2UKtoc** (1): how the FUCK the sugababes brand could be tarnished by the worst fucking synth sounds, drums, and fart-ass noises. I have been informed by our hostesses that by this point, the sugababes were NOT the og 3 and now basically just stuck with the name is a postmodern anonymity flop era. christ almighty this is an evil evil evil ditty.

# People who did the LAND rate

**bbfan132** (10): this and the miranda cosgrove cover are both 10s

**criestotheclicking** (10): these girls need reparations for miranda cosgrove making a generation of Americans think she made this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Tbh I do like the more pop-punk sound of Miranda Cosgrove’s version but this song’s star will always shine.

**slimboyfriend** (10): Don’t worry, I also gave the Miranda Cosgrove version a 10 in the Disney/Nick Rate


**thegolding** (10): I kinda like Miranda's version the most but this still slaps

**throwaway-7650** (10): this definitely won't get #15 but will the sugababes even get to #4 (iCarly)? find out this weekend at the Y2UK reveal!

**Awkward\_King** (9): miranda cosgrove count your days

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): miranda did outsell [3472468]

**celladonn** (8): I never thought I'd say these words but Miranda Cosgrove outsold

**fadedblue09** (8): cute bop, but this sounds immature for a girl group of their age. They may have better vocals than Miranda, but this really is meant to be a teen pop song IMO.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ended mirfadna flopsgrove

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): I do think the song fits Miranda Cosgrove better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): if this does worse than the cover in the disney/nick rate…

**welcome2thejam** (7): Weird place where this is better in a lot of ways than Miranda's cover, but I also prefer the driving teeny bopper pop punk energy in LAND rate. Chorus is fun as hell, there's potential for a high scoring version of this, but neither quite make it there

**daretheghost** (6): Lurking the Discord taught me this song was eventually covered by Miranda Cosgrove which… is very fitting because this sounds extremely Disney/Nick-core.

**ismayoaninstrument9** (6): this track belongs to miranda cosgrove

**plastichaxan** (5): but Miranda Cosgrove outsold

**seanderlust** (3.5): if you had told me this was a song on iCarly I would have absolutely believed you and told you EDIT: apparently it actually is, and is in the LADN rate playlist. the fact that i heard both of these a few times and didn't realize they were the same song is really a testament to how unremarkable it is (or how bad my memory is idk). anyways miranda cosgrove outsold

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is my favorite Girls Aloud song. I can’t explain why. I often give popheads a hard time for liking well-executed but extremely dull and generic white girl synthpop. This is Girls Aloud delivering a standard-for-them white girl synthpop song, and I’ve been OBSESSED with it for years. Everything here just works for me, the subdued drama bursting at the seams of this moodier cut. All the lyrics interplay beautifully with each other. The synths? Sound amazing? Nicola on the bridge? Sublime. And the final chorus with the added descending synth that’s a quiet yet distinct detail just sends me over the edge, like I LOVE this song it’s just so perfect.

---

# SHOTSSHOTSSHOTSHOTSSHOTSHSOTS

**GlialUreterostenosis** (11): Yep, it's another youtube /r/popheads gay falling for a basic synthpop track. idc, that "tiii-I-i-I-ime, ooo-ooh" is the best 2 seconds in the rate.

**StarSquash45** (11): this song is crack to me in a way i am unable to explain. i hope the 11 says all that needs to be said

**thegolding** (11): This is my most played song ever on last fm. This is gorgeous. The lyrics, the irony, the production, the immaculate bridge with Nicola. I really adore Call The Shots

**agentofscranton** (10): nicola's bridge after the instrumental cuts out is capable of saving lives

**amr** (10): walked so brave by twice could soar and fly

**bbfan132** (10): i feel like popheads would’ve been all over this if it existed back in 2007

**daretheghost** (10): I think this is the first Girls Aloud song I ever heard and definitely among their very best, in my opinion.

**fadedblue09** (10): Finally a good song

**MrSwearword** (10): the one time the gherls match the production, plus the lyrics have bite to them.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): :arnedance:

**throwaway-7650** (10): calling all the monsters interlude for this pleek

**DirtyRat583** (9.6): i hold a small fondness for this song because it was on now 69 (very funny i know)

**stbrigidiscross** (9.5): Girls Aloud are great at upbeat fun songs but they're great at emotions too, the production on this is gorgeous. Nicola's part is particularly beautiful.

**BaconShoes** (9): JUST CUZ YOU’RE RAISIN THE BET AND CALL THE SHOTS NOWWWW ON MEEE OOOOH

**welcome2thejam** (9): Ooh, super close to being incredible. Think the climax needed a little more power or an extra new wrinkle or two

**Amazon4life** (8.5): Good, but slightly overrated imo.

**moooo566** (8.5): this is an odd one because while other the other songs here outright slap, this is more a vibes thing. it's still great though!

**starla\_** (8.5): disco

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): im sorry but literally the most interesting thing in this video was that rotating phone??? Like hello??? What is the purpose?!??!?!

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.1): great intro just stays banger

**1998tweety** (8): Rihanna in that one song

**criestotheclicking** (8): Nicola solo time! She was always my favourite member growing up (still is)

**Marvelous2002** (8): The melodies... the production... their vocals... their lack of emotions... pretty I guess

**Melody** (8): This song is perfect for those late Winter and early January walks, it's very comforting, and this the era where I think the Girls truly started to shine!

**Smuckles** (8): Not quite the soothing ambience of All Saints - Pure Shores but I enjoy it all the same.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): This one is really good!

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's a nice song and there are nice moments... but it's missing something more

**qazz23** (7): good chorus but a more ordinary sound otherwise

**TCHALLA1966** (7): twas a cute song from them

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I like this chorus but the verses are kinda forgettable.

# Call The Flops

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I guess this is the part of their career where they get boring and predictable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is so generic and especially coming from girls aloud who are supposed to be so innovative and experimental with their music? they can do better than this

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): can I just have more of that high energy Girls Aloud instead

**CrimsonROSET** (4): slowed down trailer music

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): The chorus is already repetitive but then they keep repeating it so it’s just repeating repeating repeating

**cremeebrulee** (0): how was this more boring than the entire all saints section

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): God what a cool track. The head of their label made the wise decision to put this out as Sugababes’ first single, and nothing else quite sounded like this at the time. The brilliant Cameron McVey at the helm brought out something special (who I am constantly stating the fun fact that he produced Massive Attack’s Blue Lines, is married to Neneh Cherry and Mabel’s dad-hope your bingo card is full now). Siobhan details in a Guardian article that Cameron took their girls’ lived experiences and took key phrases to create this song. The final cut we hear is from the girls recording a demo track on a handheld mic. She notes she’s notably pitchy on some parts but that’s what Cameron wanted to convey, the messy rush of adolescent infatuation. I’m definitely enamored with how unique and off-kilter this track is, while still having that honest throughline from young girls’ perspective.

---

# Overloaded their brain

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Indie classic! This is the song that anchored their uniqueness as a group - even after the lineup changed and their sound got more glossy, there was always that left-field alternative influence sprinkled in, and this was the blueprint. It was lively yet angsty, mature without sounding pretentious or inauthentic, and speaks to the messy hormonal emotions of being a teenager without being inappropriately provocative. They should still be proud of this song 20+ years later and it warms my heart to see the original members reunite.

**bbfan132** (10): yet another excellent debut single

**BeauMeringue212** (10): this has held up so well over time. And the fact they wrote it as teens?!

**kappyko** (10): Gonna be so disrespected it's UNREAL. While i dont begrudge the world for giving its attention to 2-step i wish this style of kitschy deee-lite esque pop would come back into fashion

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm still amazed this was their debut single and that they wrote the words to it. TALENT.

**plastichaxan** (10): the destination of the train was mother lake

**robincav** (10): Amazing stripped back pop with nonsense lyrics. Their raw talent >>>

**Smuckles** (10): It's not often that chart music has sounded as straight up cool as this. No vocal gymnastics, no pretence, it doesn't even feel like they're trying. They're just naturally cool.

**starla\_** (10): this was my runner-up 11 contender. It's such an unusual sounding pop song, but really works. The bridge??? So good.

**Stryxen** (10): experimentalists.. they were experimenting…

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): outsold Talking Heads

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): "It was released on 11 September 2000" di-did they know what was coming? is this also 9/11 core (like OK Computer and Kid A)?

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): being petty because some of the vocals sound off

**DirtyRat583** (9.7): oh the label STUFFED them with yass pills in the studio before they recorded this

**daretheghost** (9.5): What an interesting melody!

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): the original three have such good harmonies. Love the slowed down Bridge and the guitar solo.

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): This song and video are just so effortlessly cool

**stbrigidiscross** (9.5): I've heard this a million times but it's an absolute classic. I particularly enjoy if you ever hear it on a night out that everyone mistimes the situation adlib and shouts it at the wrong chorus. If I have to make a criticism, it would be that they could have given Keisha more to do.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): love indie music <3

**akanewasright** (9): I swear to god I’ve heard this a thousand times before but I have no idea how

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Forget what I said eariler about Sound of The Underground, THIS is how you do a debut single! I love this one so much.

**qazz23** (9): good vocal delivery and funky sound, love that solo

**BaconShoes** (8): Interesting production; I like the vibes

**CrimsonROSET** (8): that beat is insane

**Luxaria** (8): What a debut, I remember it going harder though

**Melody** (8): how was this a debut.. for a bunch of 15 year olds they ATEEE.

**nt96** (8): vocals are a bit iffy at times but a slay song nonetheless

**vivaforever597** (8): I never really appreciated this one until recently.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this song would be nothing without the second half

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Kinda weird for a debut track? But not without its charms.

**1998tweety** (7): i took a course overload last year

**a-man-with-a-perm** (7): this sounds nothing like Joy Division smh

**criestotheclicking** (7): I would have never thought to put a guitar solo there but it’s cool, and so is the half-time breakdown after.

**StarSquash45** (7): the vocals are so charming here

**apatel27** (6.5): Why are they singing over each other

**Marvelous2002** (6.5): Omg I remember watching this video for the first time fairly recently, after seeing Keisha's videos on her YT channel and her in Leigh-Anne's documentary. I like the song! not love but it's probably my fave debut on this list

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): ugh i really love the beat to this but the song as a whole isnt hitting!! so disappointed in myself

# Overhated

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This isn’t great but I will give it credit for being way better than the last song I heard with this title.

**fadedblue09** (5): Very intriguing instrumentally but they sound like they're about to faint

**TiltControls** (4.5): Maybe this can go out first like the other Overload we just rated

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): oh these lead vocals are rough

**indie\_fan\_** (0): I’m sorry but i really cannot stand the vocals or production here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I think Ghost describes this song perfectly by saying each member of the group gets a chance to shine, not to mention Sarah’s showstopping mid-section. There’s like 4 choruses and 2.5 bridges here, I really could not explain the structure of this song to you off the top of my head. But it’s a gorgeous number that seems to blend the best moments of 60’s girl group harmonies and a mellow disco groove. There’s also a quality that feels reminiscent of 90’s poppy R&B-lite (like Eternal? That group with the white girl in it? lol.) I think me trying to place an era for this song shows how beautifully timeless it all feels, a song that has a LOT in it and runs long but never want it to end.

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): you can feel the yearning on the tip of their tongues, the 60s pop/soul inspired bop just oozes love and fulfillment that may be falling apart but they aren’t ready to let go, not yet at least

---

# Everything this song does is extraordinary!

**criestotheclicking** (11): this is one of my favourite songs of all time that I now can’t listen to without crying considering Sarah (Rest in Peace) has the best part.

**agentofscranton** (10): this was absolutely everywhere when I was in year 6, god they really were IT for a while huh?

**akanewasright** (10): I feel like this could have been an instrumental video game song, but they decided to make it extra slay

**Amazon4life** (10): My favorite song by GA, perfection!

**bbfan132** (10): the harmonies, the throwback sound, everything just works

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The way she says “babe” I was like YAAAAASSSSSS.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): key change that moved mountains

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this makes me feel like a main character omg....

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I think this is the best line distribution I’ve ever heard for a girl group, the song is so chock full of catchy melodies (and surprisingly interesting lyrics) that every single member gets a phrase that’s so unique and memorable. But special mention must be given to “here I am! a walking primrose” because I haven’t been able to stop singing that since I heard it. If I had two 11s then this would get one of them but unfortunately something else narrowly snatched mine.

**Marvelous2002** (10): ONE TWO THREE FOUR best GA single? Probably, they do that concept so damn well it's not even fair. The nostalgia is strongest with this, I remember hearing this on the radio, which is definitely a formative memory for me

**MassiveThief** (10): this slays so hard

**nt96** (10): Never make promises, never make promises. Nothing ain't promised at all. Oh, when we rate, we fold!

**StarSquash45** (10): immaculate vibes here, i love how they all get their turn

**Stryxen** (10): this song just has it all. A billion bridges and a key change that adds absolutely nothing. And it somehow all works together and makes a FLAWLESS song with an ICONIC chorus

**TCHALLA1966** (10): excellence tbqh

**thegolding** (10): this was my first favorite song by Girls Aloud. The harmonies, the lyrics, the performances they did.... perfect

**welcome2thejam** (10): Gorgeous track

**BaconShoes** (9.5): heavenly

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): this is giving christmas

**amr** (9): the mixing on this is so kpop dance practice video vibes /pos

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): And people say Cheryl can’t sing! She sounded completely ok here! Anyways, this song musically reminds me of an era when people like me had 0 human rights but it’s still ridiculously good

**oscarbrierley1** (9): their performance of this at the brits is so camp.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): very pleasant and sweet

**fadedblue09** (8.5): that key change elevated this

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this makes me dance like Scarlett Johanson in that one scene of a marriage story

**stbrigidiscross** (8.5): I like it's different old school vibe but it's not my favourite song by the girls. They all get fabulous solos in this "get the energy to wire me close to you", "looking into windows" and of course "walking primrose" are particularly memorable

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.5): I know this one

**Luxaria** (8): This song was totally inescapable on TheHits/4music (throwback)

**Melody** (8): This being the song that got them their only Brit Award, we love ha for that!

**MrSwearword** (8): the video, gorge. The song? Well, at least they got the doo-wop realness down that time. Side note, RIP to Sarah who absolutely served in her solo moment in front of the screen for her "primrose" line.

**qazz23** (8): nice Motown feel to this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): it was a 7 before but that key change made me bump it up a point

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): its weird hearing this song without an act having just got four yes's on a uk talent show

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this feels like it’s a glee original

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Good choruses on this one. Also whoaah holy shit a key change!!!

**Smuckles** (7): As close to Stereolab as this rate will allow.

**celladonn** (6.5): it has a cool elegant sound but it's a little boring

**daretheghost** (6): I do not love this song and I hate the delivery of “Here I am / Walking Primrose.” Hot take!!!

# is starting to fade

**starla\_** (5): this has potential to be good but the oversinging is really irritating

**TiltControls** (4): The chorus feels 1/4th of the way there to being used in a Christmas commercial for a major retailer

**moonagenightmares** (3.4): i got bored and felt like skipping halfway through

**BeauMeringue212** (3): OK idk maybe I'm the outlier but I never liked this song. The vaguely showband sound doesn't really work for me

**throwaway-7650** (3): oh wow... this is the worst girls aloud song by far

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): The song that put these queens on the MAP! I do think the original song is pretty generic late 90s R&B, like they sound nice enough, but Matt “Jam” Lamont took them to a whole other level on this one. It’s just such a jam and Sabrina’s sped-up riffs sound so cool and fresh. And of course our introduction to thee iconic MC Alesha Dixon, being cool as ever here!

---

# Why?

**apatel27** (11): You just know this got a ton of reloads

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i wasn't ready for this utter collapse after being numb from enduring all saints

**MrSwearword** (10): Sabrina and Alesha coming correct in the name of the almighty

**nt96** (10): But you did this for what? Why not? Why? Why not? But why tho?

**plastichaxan** (10): they heard Yoko’s song and said you know what let me yassify and made something incredible

**qazz23** (10): vocal delivery and horns are sooo good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the best destiny's child song not by destiny's child

**sarcasticsobs** (10): slamming fists on desk in excitement: GARAGE! It is the remix!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the music video where the play the intro of the original song and then it switches to the remix version is so fucking iconic

**TCHALLA1966** (10): Alesha Dixon being the rap girl in this group then switching up to pop darling yeah she iconic for that

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): "This is the remix" is always a good start

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream the latino R&B mix, exclusively from the burger king kids meal CD back in whatever year it was

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): ca-can we bop to the remix in the club together? me and all the besties? anyways in the excahnge rate I gave this a 10.0 while declaring my (unfettered, sorta unknowledgeable, but earnest) love for UK garage. just

**indie\_fan\_** (9.7): the speedy gonzalez remix speed really worked in its favor.

**TiltControls** (9.5): Why not?

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): i forgot how hard garage goes

**1998tweety** (9): why? (is this such a bop)

**akanewasright** (9): The way the remixers of this just found every potential strength this group could have and put them on full display

**BaconShoes** (9): ok this goes off

**bbfan132** (9): apparently this is a remix, but it’s a really good one

**celladonn** (9): oh this uk garage sound is so fresh and fun

**frogaranaman** (9): y

**Melody** (9): Why is Mis-teeq so iconic.. melanin Queens indeed.

**Stryxen** (9): exactly

**welcome2thejam** (9): Oh hell yes, some good food

**daretheghost** (8.5): The first time I listened to this I thought it was kind of chaotic but I’ve since warmed up to it! The joys of familiarizing yourself with rates before getting into things.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Probably the best of the debut songs in the rate

**starla\_** (8.5): this is extremely early 2000s and very nostalgic

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): need more uk garage mc radio edits tbh, but like for songs by taylor swift or maybe even black country new road

**Awkward\_King** (8): god im such a slut for a good garage song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ghost pointed out there’s discord notifs in the mix and i cant unhear it

**Smuckles** (8): I always appreciate when I am told that the song I'm about to listen to is a remix, it helps me for categorization reasons.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): nightcore

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The instrumental makes this song more intriguing

**stbrigidiscross** (7.5): I first saw the video to this and couldn't understand why the director couldn't seem to have both Zena and Su-Elise in shot at the same time like they weren't expecting 4 people. The song is a nice garage track.

**Luxaria** (7): Strong start to their career bh

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): I feel like they might've made it a little bit too fast but it's still a pretty good remix.

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.5): this sounds like it’s going through nightcoreification

**seanderlust** (6.5): why does it sound like this is being played on youtube at 1.5x speed

**Amazon4life** (6): At first listen it's cute. Not sure I'd play it often, but it made me feel nostalgic for that time, which I appreciate.

**BeauMeringue212** (6): I prefer the original, remix gets a bit too Alvinesque

**uberpigeon** (6): yoko who

# Why!?!

**Marvelous2002** (5.5): Good but I only remember 2 members after that song

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): Not really a huge fan of UK garage

**StarSquash45** (5): i like the beat but really not a fan of the sped up vocals

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Girl slow down!!

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this sounds like hyperpop (derogatory)

**vch01** (3): probably the worst song from the whole bunch but I don't wanna give it a zero

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): As a few of these comments have pointed out, this is the song that got non-British popheads on board for this rate to happen. And I can see why! It’s dynamic as FUCK and just won’t quit once it starts. Plus the music video has the change-up of a different song in the bridge section, just keeping your senses fully engaged on these three ladies slaying.

---

# ..is for my 11 to win

**akanewasright** (11): This is everything I could have wanted from a Mis Teeq song and more - the fast garage beat, punchy steel drums, a killer hook, and of course Alesha Dixon’s insane rap verse. It hits the ground running and never slows down. Literally not a moment wasted

**celladonn** (11): are you kidding me this absolutely rules

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i have heard two sunship songs and they are both 11s

# …is for this song to do well

**amr** (10): music that turns all the chaos in the chao garden to GOOD and KIND HERO chaos

**apatel27** (10): Sunship is a legend. That's all

**cancersgroove** (10): THEY ATE SO HARD ON ALL THREE VERSIONS

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m convinced that darj playing this during listening parties is single handedly the thing that made this rate happen

**kappyko** (10): I like how part of the reason why this rate is happening is Darj playing this song and people being like "Oh Damn This Rate Has Bops"

**Melody** (10): AWAY WE GO??? MC Alesha will never stop being iconic, her riffs, the black british accent! Sabrinas has VOVCALS!! She's like honey and deserved a bigger career. Such a BANGER!!

**nt96** (10): All I want is for this song to make to day 3

**plastichaxan** (10): their section of the rate being the pussy part of the rate this is amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (10): all I want is mis-teeq world domination, is that too much to ask for?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i need to dance to this at a dance dance revolution machine at dave and busters RIGHT NOW

**throwaway-7650** (10): E TO THE X TO THE CEP TO TH-

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): GOD THIS VIDEO IS SO GOOD. SHE GETS WARPED INTO A MIRROR AND THEN NEXT THING WE KNOW EVERYONE IS BOPPING AND I AM LEARNING THEIR NAMES. THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME. MMM THIS SHIT NASTY!!!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Thumbs way up to that rap verse: perfect placement, love her voice, brings so much energy & swagger

**TiltControls** (9.5): The song feels like its on the 1.25x speed setting on Youtube (complimentary)

**1998tweety** (9): ENDED that fad Olivia

**Awkward\_King** (9): so true

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): And Aslay we go!

**fadedblue09** (9): very fun, bouncy instrumentation

**Luxaria** (9): Aleisha Dixon does not get enough credit does she?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): M WITH THE I WITH THE S-T-DOUBLE-E-Q!!

**qazz23** (9): i like the rapping in this

**bbfan132** (8): this bops!

**frogaranaman** (8): not the mariokart cheap cheap beach synths

**MrSwearword** (8): vibe wise, absolutely not but this is clearly when Alesha's star power was certified.

**slimboyfriend** (8): This is some darkchild production

**Smuckles** (8): It's just a ton of fun. Alesha Dixon putting a lot of MC's to shame with her delivery.

**stbrigidiscross** (8): I was surprised to see the girls getting a new single and there was suddenly only 3 of them. It's super catchy and I was so impressed by Sabrina gamely singing along live to the sped up and chopped vocals on Top of the Pops.

**BaconShoes** (7): a bit dated maybe but it’s fun

**criestotheclicking** (7): we need more rapping in UK girl groups.

**daretheghost** (7): ENTAH

**StarSquash45** (7): All I Want is for you to B WIth Me???

# … is for this song to flop

**cremeebrulee** (6): rosalia could kill this beat

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i think i’d have liked the not radio edit more

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): i'm sorry but i don't think UK garage is for me

**uberpigeon** (6): this kind of sounds like bizcochito

**Marvelous2002** (5): Why did both of their songs so far sound sped up? damn radios

**starla\_** (4): this leans into the garage/2 step sound that I love, but with really cheap sounding production

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): When crafting this rate, I knew from the beginning I would HAVE to place my second favorite Girls Aloud song “On the Metro” here. I didn’t even think of it as payola, as I’ve been into their music long enough to know this is a huge fan favorite that people feel was robbed of a singles release and music video. Nicola’s pen is top-notch here, as there a rhymes here that are both silly but lowkey clever (“his moves were so ridiculous/but he was so meticulous”) and the whole concept of the song-crying on the metro-makes this sound like an amazing tune cut from Robyn’s Body Talk. Taking inspiration from techno and J-Pop, no other Girls Aloud song really sounds like it, and it hinted on what could have been if they didn’t bitterly end right after their final 2013 reunion tour. Now I’m gonna cri thinking about it.

**flavasavavandal** (9): sometimes rate host payola is a good thing

---

# Why the fuck wasn’t this a single

**cherryices** (11): penned by nicola 🧡 god love her

**1998tweety** (10): me when I took my hour-long commute each morning

**agentofscranton** (10): that chorus is pure sugar

**akanewasright** (10): “his moves were so ridiculous but he was so meticulous” bruh was he doing his taxes in the club or something

**Amazon4life** (10): Should've been a single instead of Something New. Amazing song.

**amr** (10): meticulous such a hilarious song to describe anybody getting crazy on the dacefloor but they spilleded

**BaconShoes** (10): Nicola ate this up

**bbfan132** (10): imagine if they made an album that sounded like this….

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Nicola Roberts is a true ally for writing this, run her her check GLAAD

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Not the worst thing you could do on the Metro.

**daretheghost** (10): [stan twitter ravings]

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song grabbed me by the throat and slammed into the wall…. ON THE METRO!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is like if the Ally songs from A Star Is Born were actually good and not just gays trying to stan anything electropop gaga shat out since she didn’t do any of that since Artpop

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): flop singles deserve to be rated too!

**Roxieloxie** (10): i am convinced that if they knew about it, they would've made bella throne and zendaya cover this on shake it up

**stbrigidiscross** (10): I love the whole vibe of this and it really illustrates the flexibility and versatility of how they sing so well together and individually. It absolutely should have been a single.

**Stryxen** (10): gorgest verses and bridge and an ICONIC chorus. Everytime I go to London (as little as I possibly can) I romanticise getting the underground to this to make the trip bearable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): why is this kinda the best song ever

**thedoublebanana** (10): Nicola Roberts needs more credit for the bops that she has written for this group.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I've been there ladies, far too relatable

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'm a kesha stan and kpop fan so ofc I love this

**DirtyRat583** (9.9): i have this song blocked on spotify because i was obsessed with this song for like a week in march and spotify autoplay latched onto it for months until i had enough and i blocked it so it went away. still a good song tho

**Marvelous2002** (9.5): If the production wasn't so dated it would probably be my 11, could easily imagine a Kpop group covering this with a more modern production

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): such a missed opportunity that they never made this banger of a song the second single from ten. The girls (apart from Nadine) loved the boring slow song and made it a single, which killed the momentum of the era. At least we can thank queen Nadine for saying she wasn't doing the reunion if they made the slow song the first single. So we got one bop single in 'Something New'.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): ok wait this deep cut kinda kills it???

**CrimsonROSET** (9): queens of public transit

**DaHumanTorch** (9): whitegirlsdancingtooontsoontsattheclub.mp4

**Melody** (9): she's very 2012 and trashy! A cute b side ❤

**StarSquash45** (9): me when i'm on the metro idk

**welcome2thejam** (9): Popheads bait and they caught my ass

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): never cried at the metro can’t relate

**nt96** (8): you know this is a British song cuz I can't imagine an American crying on the metro given how crappy our systems are.

**qazz23** (8): love the buzzing synths and disco sound

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Redeemed mostly by the chorus

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): A little bit dated but it's still a banger.

**TiltControls** (7.5): There are some nice moments here, but it feels a bit clunky in other spots.

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): popheads bait

**frogaranaman** (7): they're so real for this

**indie\_fan\_** (7): docked off a point for whatever that intro was

**WaneY2UKtoc** (7): lil' more autopilot than usual on this one...sorta gets into that realm of 2010s top 40 pop that it isn't but randomly is blurring together for me.

**criestotheclicking** (6): wow an uncovered memory. This is so ridiculously 2012.

**slimboyfriend** (6): idk it sounds like everything else on the radio in 2012

# Guy who left them at the disco

**Luxaria** (5): Catchy chorus let down by meh verses (sorry)

**MrSwearword** (4): the "soda pop" line was enough for me to think "cute but aged during the first press of play".

**starla\_** (4): bad eurovision entry

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): they put the same sexy no no no juice into this one

**TCHALLA1966** (1): what the hell was this

# ok but Subway doesn’t have the same ring to it and Americans would be confused why they are crying on top of sandwich shop

**Smuckles** (6): Only classy countries call it a “metro”, I can assure you that we do not actually call it that in the UK.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This track is basically where indieheads and popheads collide! I hope you’ve all watched the fantastic Trash Theory video on this track, detailing Richard X’s bootleg mash-up background and how he pulled from Gary Numan and Adina Howard to create this raucous, electroclash banger. Adina’s original rapping is iconic, I have to state that; this one for me is its own distinct song that takes the assertive rapping and adds those awesomely dirty Numan synths to make it something that’s an excellent walking around and feeling like the shit song lol

**flavasavavandal** (10): why did I favourite this rate knowing how much pain picking my 11 would cause me. Seriously between this Pure Shores, Scandalous and my actual 11 I stressed my mind over which song to give it in my head before settling on my 11 due to childhood nostalgia and incredibly sexy surf guitars licks

---

# Adina and Sugababes are both bad bitches deserving of respect

**cremeebrulee** (11): they get me fr

**kappyko** (11): the forms of the cover song and the mashup are both given so little credit for the works they can produce so it's great that this song is basically the epitome of both. if only pop retrieved from the bits and pieces of other songs these days could sound just as daring and massive, though the drama of the original "Freak Like Me" should not go understated....

**moonagenightmares** (11): i will never get tired of this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): Excellent S-tier cover. If you haven't already, go watch the New British Canon video about this song and then read the FreakyTrigger article about it, they're both AMAZING.

**agentofscranton** (10): the instrumental is giving IT Crowd opening titles

**bbfan132** (10): brilliant mashup, absolutely love this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Lmao an iconic Halloween track apparently???

**cancersgroove** (10): changed British pop.. just wow…

**daretheghost** (10): THE Freak Like Me? The Adina Howard version was a STAPLE of my summers growing up.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): This was the best thing to come out of both electroclash and 2000s mashup culture, because it didn't have either movement's vibe of hipsters condescending to pop. There was this attitude among snobs that, like, Genie in a Bottle needed a Strokes mashup to be artistically credible. The Sugababes don't have that hangup, they don't play up the novelty of an Adina Howard cover sampling Gary Numan. They just hear two good songs.

**hoolytoledo** (10): you would never have convinced me that this was a (double) cover. They absolutely killed it on this one!

**Melody** (10): Freak Like Me changed the GAME for the Sugababes following Siobhans untimely departure from the group, it was the song the girls needed to fully break into the UK GPs hearts and TRULY achieved that.. everybody say thank you Richard X!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): It’s an insane take on the Adina Howard song. Also dead at Wren Kingston being in the video, Julian Morris it’s not too late to marry me

**qazz23** (10): great use of the Are Friends Electric sample, works well with the dancey sound

**robincav** (10): Revolutionary

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): yassified Gary Numan is my exact vibe

**Smuckles** (10): My prediction for rate winner (I should note that I have no idea what was or wasn't popular in America in this rate, but it feels right). It's just pretty undeniable as a song. Edgy yet accessible, as all good pop music should be.

**stbrigidiscross** (10): This is so great, it grabs your attention right away and doesn't let go. The video with Mutya and Keisha as creatures of the night who have recruited Heidi by the end of the song is so clever.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is the coolest song that has ever been made

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): wow I love sugababes can’t wait to give good scores to all their songs!

**throwaway-7650** (10): why did I only give this a 7 at first wtf... freak!

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): it's no freak on a leash, but the sound quality is tight!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Running it back while remembering it's a re-do of a mashup helped get me onboard with its sound. Absolute home run bomb. Oh wait this is Y2UK, it's an absolute goooaaal (?)

**akanewasright** (9): fine, this is good. I really like the original and get a bit mad when people praise this cover at the expense of Adina Howard’s version, but it is kinda that bitch

**BaconShoes** (9): relatable content

**Luxaria** (9): Urgh to hear this in a properly produced concert/club setting would probably take me out

**nt96** (9): these young girlies covering a 90s slut bop just sends me

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): slayed, but I prefer the original

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): love that chaotic mashups became number one songs in 2002. It shouldn't work, but it does.

**starla\_** (8.5): banger. the Gary Numan sample is excellent

**cherryices** (8.2): not quite sure this lives up to either song in this mashup……

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): Ok, here we go!

**fadedblue09** (8): a bit dated but still slaps

**moooo566** (8): i'll be honest im mostly rating this one up for the killer gary numan sample

**MrSwearword** (8): this is how you work your way around some sampling and clearance fuckery. Still, there's just better.

**StarSquash45** (8): "cause it's all about the dog in me" this song is for the pups

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): do you ever feel like a misfit?

**1998tweety** (7.5): ENDED Nicki Minaj

**criestotheclicking** (7): Mutya really got that dawg in her /s (also does this interpolate bootsy collins??)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i remember finding this and thinking it was dont cha which is the second time I confused sugababes for the pussycat dolls

**slimboyfriend** (7): who was like “yes, let’s give this girl group an industrial instrumental”

**celladonn** (6.5): this has a very unique sound but it also doesn't really keep my attention

**Stryxen** (6): this does like one thing and repeats it until it fades out why is that so funny to me

# Gary Numan outsold

**Marvelous2002** (5): Hmm some of the instrumentals clash with the vocals and it drags on a bit too much. Up scored cause Heidi vocals and I haven't seen her sing like that before

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this is so loud and for what?

**Awkward\_King** (4): there is no rise and fall (analysing sugababes songs like they are mozarts pieces)

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This is too loud, those synths are so grating!

**TiltControls** (3): Even ignoring this as a cover I don't really think it works as a song

**ImADudeDuh** (2.5): why did this girl group cover Freak Like Me while using a Nine Inch Nails remix backing track

**indie\_fan\_** (2): busier production does not always equal better song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I WOULD wanna be anywhere else but here! Because All Saints are gone now! The utter ambient pop classic of Pure Shores reaches #6 here in the rate. All Saints’ turn with William Orbit is so legendary. Their chill harmonies are a match made in heaven with Orbit’s textured, serene vibe made famous from producing Madonna’s Ray of Light album. If only we got a sublime music video as opposed to the weird tie-in with the Danny Boyle movie “The Beach” starring Leonardo Dicaprio. Stream Red Flag and Testament everyone!!!

**flavasavavandal** (10): just pure fucking bliss, there aren’t many songs that feel so magical. Seriously it’s hard to explain the sense of euphoria and ease that washes me over, like a tide to a beach.This would’ve been my 11 if it wasn’t for the rates’ biggest slay

---

# Leonardo Dicaprio stans

**bbfan132** (11): the bridge is heavenly, along with the entire song

**qazz23** (11): beautiful harmonies, has a trip hop feel and the trance-like synths really make this





**Smuckles** (11): This is it! This is why we're here people! I'm ONLY doing this rate because if I didn't I'd have to live with the fact that I did not give Pure Shores an 11. It is my civic duty to do this! Even if Black Coffee is equally as good! This is THE song to listen to if you want to hear that synth effect that sounds like a drop of water creating ripples in a larger body of water. This is THE song if you went to the Maldives one time and make a yearly Instagram post about it saying “take me back!”. This is THE song if you want to remember The Beach (2000, directed by Danny Boyle), a film I probably like more than most people although I would still recommend the book before it! I don't know anyone who has heard this song and said it was bad. Everyone rightly accepts this as the work of art it is. It will not win the rate, you'll probably pick Freak Like Me, but that's OK because I am listening to this song and I am being transported to my happy mental beach where nothing is wrong (not the one in The Beach (2000, directed by Danny Boyle), let me be clear, that beach sucks).

**thedoctordances1940** (11): i feel like i have a really nice memory of some sort associated with this song but it's from when i was a little kid and I don't at all remember what that association is, maybe it's just that this song makes me really happy

**agentofscranton** (10): only three more years until leo dicaprio has to stop being associated with this song

**Amazon4life** (10): Magic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song makes me want to dance in slow motion on an empty beach in a white dress.

**cancersgroove** (10): driving to this at night in GTA was better than therapy

**DirtyRat583** (10): me running over pedestrians in gta5 listening to this song on the radio

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I imagine heaven sounds something like this

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): they even sound like Madonna on the chorus

**kappyko** (10): DUHHHHHHHH

**Luxaria** (10): Now this? This is a certified Classic - nostalgia isn't even playing that much of factor here - it's just a good song (goes on for quite long though, lucky that the last minute picks up)

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): This is a dream-pop masterpiece from start to finish. William Orbit is one of the music industry’s greatest wizards with the amount of pure magic he produces. This song puts me on another plane of existence!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): :floating: :ascending:

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Finally some good fcking All Saints food. When it goes into overdrive at 3:11 (investigate 311) I gasped!!

**StarSquash45** (10): Solar Power - Lorde

**Stryxen** (10): pure joy and wonder

**TCHALLA1966** (10): a 11 if we being fr but I only get to pick one

**throwaway-7650** (10): what a great lead single, they won't top this, right?

**TiltControls** (10): Close call for the 11, but there's just one other track that I enjoy more. This one's so relaxing and vibey and it's so damn good.

**vivaforever597** (10): I only ever listen to the Beach Life Mix with a different melody in the chorus; the original is hard on my ears, but otherwise it's such a great song. William Orbit and Shaz were a great combination.

**akanewasright** (9.5): my one complaint with this song is that bc of its producer, I can’t help but mentally compare the song to Ray of Light songs, and I think Madonna would have been an even better fit for the song

**1998tweety** (9): ended Lana Del Rey - 13 Beaches

**slimboyfriend** (9): So this is what lorde thought she was doing

**starla\_** (9): basically perfect. the production is so good, the build-up sublime. Eliza Shaddad's cover is my favourite version but you gotta give it to the original

**nt96** (8.5): enrapture me in that 90s synth waves yasss

**daretheghost** (8): William Orbit! I will always love this early-aughts electronic sound.

**fadedblue09** (8): There are some alluring elements in the instrumentation. In particular, I like those gliding sonic vibes

**Melody** (8): this song feels tropical but at the same time futuristic, just like the year 1999

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Utter bliss.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Music video unexpectedly scary, they keep using the ghost harrassers type night vision camera with weird shots and legit jumpscared me with a sudden Leonardo DiCaprio almost halfway through

**WaneY2UKtoc** (7.8): one of the weaker cuts on non stop pop fm in GTA tbh. not rlly one I was cray about driving around Los Santos in my bugatti or the free rockstar car. I mean, like the synths and maverick class "WEEEE" production are fantastic, but it's also super bloody lowkey. need insane BANGER energy. also not quite anthemic? but ya know, lowkey is fine and tight

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/527346868544339970/1011756847365111858/all_saints.png

**thegolding** (7.5): it took me until this rate to finally appreciate this song (and probably the group as a whole)

**BaconShoes** (7): a bit of a vibe

**criestotheclicking** (7): TIL Leo DiCaprio was nominated for a Razzie (only beaten by John Travolta in Battlefield Earth).

**CrimsonROSET** (7): blair witch survivor project

**MrSwearword** (7): the video makes no goddamn sense but their harmonies are tight as fuck.

**stbrigidiscross** (7): This is their other huge hit but something about the chorus just doesn't work for me.

**Marvelous2002** (6.5): The last third of the song really saves it, the whale sounds (?) don't. Canp but not good (again). Music video is a 2 if I'm not high, but I don't do drugs so it's always a 2

# Over the age of 25

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): so this is supposed to be their best song huh…i can not differentiate it from the others

**Awkward\_King** (4): okay this is fine but a frontrunner i think not

**RandomHypnotica** (0): im sorry but this has always been one of the most boring hits songs I've known… it's such absolute nothingness I feel crushed by the void of emotion I feel listening to this

flavasavavandal: A group with high highs and mid mids and an atrocious end. Pure Shores and Black Coffee are simply magical though

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.813): all saint you don't entirely flop and there's some winners there. there's also some stinkers

**qazz23** (8.625): consistently good, has some of the strongest songs of the rate

**StarSquash45** (8.563): I really know nothing about this group. Before this rate, if you'd asked me I would have said they were an American group! But I loved so much of their music here, I really want to listen to more

**Amazon4life** (8.500): They're so underrated. A great group with a chill discography.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.500): Undoubtedly in the top 5 of best things to come from Britain

**Smuckles** (8.500): Ahhhh, a girl group with such class and style that Orson Wells would have no choice but to lean back and celebrate their excellence. I think what sets them apart from the other artists here is 1. There were cool. Like, effortlessly cool. They looked cool and they sounded cool. 2. You could tell they were real music fans interested in exploring genres and were dabbling in trip-hop, R&B, rock and rap. All of these influences are here and they all blend beautifully. They broke up after releasing their best songs (Pure Shores and Black Coffee) but I'm left wondering what could have been if they hadn't (they did get back together a couple of times but it was pretty meh, too much time had passed. Check out Rock Steady though if you like Santigold). It's been a joy listening to these songs again though, one of the best pop acts to do it.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.988): I feel like they're so different from the rest so it's kind of hard to rate them in comparison. The harmonies on their second album are amazing.

**nt96** (7.850): 7.85 I quite enjoyed this lineup!

**robincav** (7.688): One of the few groups here I didn't grow up on, but I loved their style

**daretheghost** (7.688): My sister had their debut album as part of a UK pop obsession-5ive, Billie Piper, Robbie Williams, etc–in the wake of the Spice Girls so I have a lot of nostalgia for All Saints and that album in particular. And I really dug their more hip-hoppy, r&b sound. I never really kept up with them aside from their comeback single “One Strike” which is GREAT.

**kaanew** (7.625): where has this 90s r&b uk girl group been all my life

**raggedy-princess** (7.375): not as consistent as some of the other groups here but when they hit they hit hard

**thedoctordances1940** (7.300): not the most consistent group here but they have two incredible songs

**plastichaxan** (7.263): Not sure if my issue is that it’s samey or that the samey is from some really boring elements, especially considering there are interesting ideas through the songs but I guess now typing it out it’s a mix of both

**DirtyRat583** (7.025): idk why they were included because their greatest hits album was released in 2001 (💀) but at least it allows me to 10 pure shores

**slimboyfriend** (6.875): These are like the chill cool girls you’d smoke with in the corner until they grow up and make something like Chick Fit

**letsallpoo** (6.625): why did the apple music playlist have their random cover of lady marmalade in it and why did it kind of go off

**welcome2thejam** (6.625): Never got bad, but not an interesting enough presence to reach the highest scores

**thegolding** (6.563): 5

**RandomHypnotica** (6.213): i rapidly alternated between being bored out of my mind, or wondering why tf they did something weird

**Luxaria** (6.125): Sorry to say I think I was too young for them

**criestotheclicking** (6.125): idk why, but to me this is as if the spice girls was just 4x sporty spice

**TiltControls** (6.125): Very hit and miss with their works. Sometimes you get a Pure Shores or All Hooked Up and sometimes you get an Under the Bridge or Bootie Call. Still, when they shine they can really kill it.

**sarcasticsobs** (6.100): Got worried with the first couple but I enjoyed the progression! The magical “10 immediately following the 0”! Powerful stuff!

**akanewasright** (6.063): these girls are at their best when they get to be *cool* and kinda float above it all, but often their songs are just… not there. A combination of boring songs (NOT pure shores) and baffling covers pull them down, but they’re a more than capable group who sometimes just didn’t have the songs to support them

**vayyiqra** (6.000): I have only the vaguest memories of this group from youth, that being their name and that they existed, but not any memory of their songs ... they're kind of polarizing to me, as my scores show, getting both a 10 and 0.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.938): Pretty good group tbh.

**cremeebrulee** (5.762): this whole section needed to be nightcore'd

**Marvelous2002** (5.650): Know a handful about them, before my time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.500): sigh i didnt want to be so mean to a group in this rate but these songs were not very good. theres nothing here that hasnt been done better by the other groups in this rate and the under the bridge cover is truly one of the most baffling pieces of music i’ve ever heard.

**Melody** (5.250): 4.2

**fadedblue09** (5.250): Half of their songs felt like a slog to me. They seem to be aiming for a chill, R&B vibe but sadly the vocals weren't there. The last few songs somewhat work ig.

**Olivier77777** (5.000): 5 never connected with them

**throwaway-7650** (4.638): 2 of the best songs in the rate and then... whatever that is

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is probably the best repetitive song ever, lo-fi hip hop studying girl found in shambles. Very clever use of the Whatever Lola Wants sample, I would never have picked on the sample if I didn’t read up on it. The chorus really is hypnotic, and the subtle ad-libs towards the end really send bits of dopamine in my brain lol. And shout out to the cool “thunderdome experiencing a tornado??” music video concept. Keisha looks beautiful in this video, love the blue eyeshadow look on her.

**flavasavavandal** (10): this is perfect head nodding music (complimentary)

---

# I’m sorry guys it’s really gone this time

**LogJumpy1450** (11): groundbreaking and revolutionary for pop music

**robincav** (11): My second favourite here, but probably the best and most important. Heidi's bridge is jaw-dropping. The definition of pop perfection

**Amazon4life** (10): Another song of my childhood.

**Awkward\_King** (10): so much pussy a cat sanctuary would be jealous

**BaconShoes** (10): THE SMASH

**cancersgroove** (10): they established their motherness here.

**cherryices** (10): i know heidi isn’t an ~original sugababe~ but i think she’s every bit as important to the group’s sound. i don’t want to imagine anyone else on this bridge!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the slow down slay section? love that for them

**DirtyRat583** (10): the first encounter of this song that i remember was on the Heat Summer Anthems compilation i bought on itunes in 2015

**kappyko** (10): honestly closer to like a 90s alt rock song than anything in the pop girl group universe

**Luxaria** (10): That last CHORUS and the BRIDGE

**nt96** (10): The fact that this introduced to me by Kangaroo Jack lol

**qazz23** (10): really catchy melody on this, and love the change-up on the bridge (11 candidate)

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): it's a simple set up: you go round round the circle in an underground tornardo simulation cage where men pay to watch you try and last as long as you can! rock on sugababes!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): kinda shocked that this isn't an interpolation of the dead or alive song???

**BeauMeringue212** (9): I have fond memories of singing this as a 5 year old and my mom telling me I was the man and the one who was gonna have to do the spending 😭

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Get his ass!

**luckyphase** (9): my tween self would have listened to this non stop but adult me has no time for joy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Incredible tune, each Sugababe has their own unique verse and I love the sudden beat switch when it gets to Heidi.

**StarSquash45** (9): how did i forget this song existed??

**stbrigidiscross** (9): This is an absolute banger that shows that Freak Like Me wasn't a fluke and the girls are a force to be reckoned with. It also established that the girls are more upbeat and fun than with Siobhán.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Second verse on got my attention, super interesting production

**daretheghost** (8.5): Music that would play at The Bronze.

**starla\_** (8.5): the production on this is so good

**bbfan132** (8): catchy and fun, not my favorite sugababes single but it’s still good

**criestotheclicking** (8): what an unexpected bridge.

**MrSwearword** (7): cute cannot compete against gorgeous

**TiltControls** (6): It just goes round and round and round and never really gets any better

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Selena Gomez & the Scene did it better

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is one big long prechorus

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Did you predict this winning? I did too! Lmao. Without a doubt Girls Aloud’s most adored song, it proved to have some detractors that kept it from entering the Top 3. It’s obviously a Xenomania masterclass, and Brian Higgins and Miranda Cooper had the girls sing various short 30 second to a minute clips of all types of songs, only to stitch them together into a patchwork earworm monstrosity. It’s one of the most well-known examples of a song with various genre switch-ups; starting with the bluesy opener that then switches to a sleek electropop verse and anthemic chorus. And gotta love the delightful nonsense lyrics of “so I got my cappuccino to go/and I’m headed for the hills again.” Turns out, the girls DID cause a controversy missing the Top 3!

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): A great song that somehow found itself as being one of the most celebrated pieces of British pop music (even earning itself a submission in a charity rate here a few years ago) And I get it, the sticky hooks are stacked on top of each other. But I always felt this song was always doing too much. Still a fun little ditty bop. Love the heavy piano.

---

# Can’t mistake this song’s slayology 

**babadork** (11): It’s a difficult choice between this and Love Machine.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1nd7lse2fw

**buddhacharm** (11): going 1 minute without saying mother challenge (EXTREME VERSION) (IMPOSSIBLE)

**CrimsonROSET** (11): camp video? slay song? Sign me up

**DaHumanTorch** (11): madonna spit out her soy latte in shock at the cappuccino endorsement

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Of course this is gonna be my 11. I paid 4 dollars (and 2.50 shipping) to buy the CD single of this song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): yeah i know im part of the problem

**vayyiqra** (11): [basic 11 comment] One time I heard this in a pharmacy and thought it was the greatest thing ever and had to look up this bold, original, captivating song. This is how I first heard Girls Aloud. In hindsight what an odd track to play in a Canadian pharmacy in 2015 or whenever that was but I'm glad it happened. Also I like biology I got a degree in it

**vch01** (11): a religious experience

**agentofscranton** (10): primary school disco staple

**akanewasright** (10): gender essentialism is bad, but this song is still cool

**Amazon4life** (10): Iconic.

**Awkward\_King** (10): the reason only girls are allowed is because men cant find it because this song is CLIT

**BaconShoes** (10): epic pop song of all time

**bbfan132** (10): this song goes in a million different directions and i love all of them

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I don’t believe in science

**hoolytoledo** (10): I will be floored if this doesn’t make top 3

**kaanew** (10): a modern masterpiece

**kappyko** (10): i think what makes this special is that unlike other "every part is a hook" songs it feels like every section is a genuine development from the previous one, building up to something rather than entertaining via the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink method. that said the structure isn't THAT crazy? it could definitely be sorted into verse/pre-chorus/chorus/post-chorus. love when catchy intro portions come back for the bridge - see also: fromis_9's love bomb

**Melody** (10): THE BASE.. THE CREATIVITY.. THE 3 SWITCHES.. RED VELVETS AND AESPAS MOTHERS. The music video tragic tho x

**nt96** (10): you cant mistake my biology (the way that I rate)!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this song is genius in indescribable ways

**RandomHypnotica** (10): THE WAY THAT WE TALK THE WAY THAT WE WALK

**robincav** (10): As expected

**Smuckles** (10): This song has aged WELL. Love the contrast between the foot-stompin' verses and the synthpop chorus. Like, this is a technically fantastic song. Rick Beato could have a lot of fun with this one if he would allow himself to!

**stbrigidiscross** (10): I love every crazy element that was crammed together to make this insane song. It works so well

**thegolding** (10): this is last decade's Bohemian Rhapsody

**throwaway-7650** (10): when this pulls a fancy (TWICE. NOT IGGY AZALEA.)

**TiltControls** (10): No I'm not biased cause I studied biology I promise

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): is this what feminism is? hanging out with your besties and butterflies and strutting around in platonically powerful dresses? god it looks so fun. also, shoutout to the top youtube comment that mentions "this is just 4 choruses, absolutely genius!" 10000% yes.

**cherryices** (9.5): bohemian rhapsody tried it!

**qazz23** (9): cool change-up at the midway point, but X-Ray Spex outsold on the cover!

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Will never get over the pronunciation of “controversy” in this

**TCHALLA1966** (9): one of the few songs I did like from them

**uberpigeon** (9): giving this terf anthem a good score because of the iconic teletubbies type dancing in the mv

**daretheghost** (8.5): A song that shouldn’t work on paper, but somehow kind of does?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): JK Rowling anthem! [Hearing this Russian girl group song also called “Biology” kinda took the wind out of this one’s sails for me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn22vE2YQXc)

**plastichaxan** (8.5): whatever that means

**BeauMeringue212** (8): do not let the terfs find this pls

**luckyphase** (8): biology rules evopsych drools

**slimboyfriend** (8): loving the diet choreo in the music video

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): this walked at a leisurely pace so i got a boy could run

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): one of the best choruses in the rate, but when a song is this disjointed it's hard for me to appreciate the entire track and not just skip to the "good parts". Also: single cover looks like micro fetish art

**Marvelous2002** (7.5): Nadine ate, maybe a little too much,that constant drive forward is sooo good. I'm noticing something about their choreos

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): fully two different songs, but kinda good for that.

**starla\_** (7.5): honky tonk gay club

**1998tweety** (7): the song being called Biology and the album Chemistry is camp

**criestotheclicking** (7): and now, wrist-ography. I just love how most choreographers never quite rise to the challenge of choreographing girl groups.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Takes a while for it to truly reach its' apex, but when it does, it's amazing. A couple of the transitions are a little wonky and it was very difficult to give this a reasonable rating but hopefully this should satisfy your needs.

**StarSquash45** (7): The novelty of this song has kinda worn out for me

**Stryxen** (7): that's my biological mothers getting a cappuccino to go and heading for the hills again

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): I have no idea why this is the frontrunner

**Luxaria** (6): I still have no idea what an alabama return could be...

**welcome2thejam** (6): "You can't mistake my biology" is something an alien would say when they're trying to pass as human

# Physics students

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Every now and then there is a poptimist classic that I don't get, and this is one of them. The multi-hook structure is intriguing, but at the same time feels like a long buildup to nothing.

**MrSwearword** (5): it's less "biology" and more...endothermic and potential rather than kinetic.

**MassiveThief** (3): why is the mix so bad?

**Roxieloxie** (1.8): this keeps feeling like its building to something and then it doesn’t and it makes me so mad

**amr** (0): this song's gimmick is so tired to me like I'll admit it sounded cool for what it was back then but after hearing songs after it going for the same thing and doing it 100x better I recognize this is just not interesting at all to me, and it being one of the first of its kind is a whatever excuse. I don't like it!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Hello number 3 song! And what a delightfully cheeky one we got. It’s labeled as electropop but there’s something airy and sweet about the track. But then a lot of the lyrics (and iconic music video) definitely belie a more suggestive subtext. Really great to see the Sugababes, an eclectic and forward-thinking group, end in the Top 3 in the rate here.

**flavasavavandal** (10): the beat was bought from Asda but Keisha and Mutya did what they had to make it a hit

# Pushed the slay button

**amr** (11): amazing

**daretheghost** (11): A classic that has been stuck in my head ever since I started pregaming this rate.

**fadedblue09** (11): I'm biased because this is the song I'm familiar with the most, but damn this is just irresistible. The verses being equally catchy as the chorus, mixed with their vocal delivery, it's hard not to sing along

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): The button in question? The slay button. This was one of the few songs that I knew going into the rate so I was already biased towards it and although a few songs put up a good fight, I think my gut instincts were right… this is the slapper! I think the best girl group music is *approachable*, it makes you feel like you can sing and dance along, and no song in this rate does that better. It’s not complicated, it’s just fun flirty and FIERCE!

**ismayoaninstrument9** (11): perfect song

**MrSwearword** (11): This is why I say I live for this group. Everything about this is correct. The vocals, the on the nose video with color story. Replay value down boots.

**nootnoot781** (11): they were talking about the slay button

**thedoublebanana** (11): The MV was part of my gay awakening.

**akanewasright** (10): This song just gives me such joy, like I think the edge and distinctiveness that a lot of people (myself included) loved about the group is fading a bit here, but it’s just an absolute delight of a song

**Awkward\_King** (10): every song thats come out since september 26th 2005 has been trying to reach the height this song achieved

**bbfan132** (10): this feels like a rate winner to me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is the kind of music that makes my toes go crazy underneath my desk at work.

**buddhacharm** (10): I don't know a better song (yes I gave my 11 to Biology but)

**celladonn** (10): they pushed the button here, the slay button

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): So my family and I were watching music videos on the tv when I was like 15 and we went from Hi, It’s Me to Stupid and my family were grossed out by Stupid so my stepdad goes “let’s put on something wholesome” and put the Push the Button mv on. He puts it on, we spend one minute flabbergasted, and then he turnt it off and music video night was over

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): wouldn't be mad if this won

**hoolytoledo** (10): Mutya’s Sexy Ass lead me into a new dimension 10/10 would recommend

**kaanew** (10): girl groups 🤝 songs about buttons

**kappyko** (10): best pre chorus of all time

**plastichaxan** (10): i can see why the gays like her

**raggedy-princess** (10): it physically pained me to not give this an 11, anything less then top 3 would be a robbery

**RandomHypnotica** (10): reddit that one april fools

**robincav** (10): Defined radio pop for years

**slimboyfriend** (10): well first he has to FIND the button…

**StarSquash45** (10): THIS is where that tiktok sound came from? it's embarrassing that i didn't know that 💀 anyway the prechorus is the best part of the song, love the instrumental and Keisha's voice there

**Stryxen** (10): SHE WAS ACTING

**TCHALLA1966** (10): a iconic moment in British history

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Coming into this rate this very much stood out to me just because of how much I loved it as a kid and for that I can't not give it a 10

**thegolding** (10): YAS PUSH THAT BOTTOM jk this song is amazing and it's extremely addictive. I listen to it once and I have to listen like 10 times more

**throwaway-7650** (10): future rate winner (see about you now q?)

**uberpigeon** (10): influential queens changed the way i push buttons forever

**vivaforever597** (10): The way I just about screamed when they started playing this at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.

**welcome2thejam** (10): I can't stop rewinding the music video for the white dude's reaction at 2:36

**stbrigidiscross** (9.9): I don't want to just give every song 10. This is so good. My teeny criticism is that dimension is rhymed with mission when tension was right there as a possibility. I love this, Keisha's "I've been dropping so many hints ..." is one of those spoken bits that lodges itself in your brain.

**Marvelous2002** (9.5): The blueprint. Idk for what but it was. I'm busy showing him 🫦 what he's been missing

**mysario** (9.5): the same score I give to the iconic Jackbox game of the same name

**WaneY2UKtoc** (9.1): Because cassettes flopped in the mid-00s and p4k's aoty list (but not singles!) was not exactly a vessel of telling you "this is a good pop album", I have to just sorta gut-feeling "boss baby" my way through identifying the pleasure and magic of this era's pop. its just gut feelings that this stuff is lowkey genius bliss. anyways jesus christ the sugarbabes were extremely into having a good time; everyone had fun dancing here tbh. like this DOESNT happen on an elevator but they make me believe it did for them! rock on sugababes!

**BaconShoes** (9): a classic

**CrimsonROSET** (9): don’t push the button, flip the station, change the channel

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): I would not be surprised if this won the rate

**oscarbrierley1** (9): theres something about this song that I want to dislike, but I can't. It's just so fun and catchy.

**Smuckles** (9): The music itself is stupidly simple and you wouldn't think much of it listening to it isolated, this is a great example of just how much good vocal melodies and performances can enhance a song.

**TiltControls** (9): my brain the second after being told not to push the button

**agentofscranton** (8.5): revolutionised the lift industry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): push the slay button!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): one of the best jackbox games

**Luxaria** (8): Would get my eleven if it was an M/V but the song is a bit too repetitive (The spoken word bit is poetry though)

**qazz23** (8): i'll push the like button for this song

**starla\_** (8): a great pop song. it doesn't have the interesting production of their earlier songs but no one can deny it's a banger

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): This one’s pretty good, probably the most well-known Sugababes song of my childhood.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): push the slay button etc etc

**Melody** (7): The music video is very cheeky x

# ok but why are these girls dancing in the elevator, and why have they started throwing away my stuff… i just wanted to go home after a long day of work

**nt96** (5.5): they tried hitting the slay button but they kept missing

**moonagenightmares** (2): always found this song really annoying

**TragicKingdom1** (0): sorry but this commits the cardinal sin of europop: the primary riff is not only annoying but repeats into the ether. i feel similarly about Can't Get You Out of My Head which I also gave a zero once xoxo

darjeelingdarkroast: Stream Mutya Buena and Siobhan Donaghy’s solo albums xo

flavasavavandal: The Sugababes gave their label 4 albums full of amazing singles and some incredible deep cuts. They deserved a lot better than what they got by the end which was replacement after replacement until the group collapsed in 2011. Luckily in 2019 Mutya, Keisha and Siobhan managed to reclaim the name and hopefully they put out more bops. I’m a huge fan of the group’s work up till 2005 and I hope they do well and maybe win (edited after being asked to help) well they didn’t win but they got over a song over Biology and Ill take that

**robincav** (9.444): I may seem biased here, and I am but I don't care. The Sugababes are genuinely amazing, not just for nostalgic reasons: they're peak Xenomania, peak British pop. Mutya, Keisha and Siobhan are true magicians. I could talk for hours. Stream Flatline

**DirtyRat583** (8.967): they have some of the best lead singles, but the other songs flopped :-(

**agentofscranton** (8.889): mutya keisha heidi > mutya keisha siobhan > amelle keisha heidi > amelle jade heidi

**au-hsoj** (8.889): 10

**RandomHypnotica** (8.800): i appreciate them having the most variety in their output of the groups here

**nootnoot781** (8.667): Overloaded was my first CD i ever owned (as a whole 6 year old) So a lot of these songs have i have loved for 15+ years <33

**thegolding** (8.556): 8

**raggedy-princess** (8.556): Mutya&Keisha&Siobhan&Heidi <3

**throwaway-7650** (8.500): surprised at how many songs I'm somehow nostalgic for

**akanewasright** (8.389): what holds a lot of groups together is some sense of unity or direction, and while the sugababes are a bit too tumultuous to have the bond that kept groups like Little Mix together for so long, the fact that the members were involved in the writing process if their songs is probably part of what gives them their signature edge and identity. I think that edge starts to wear off towards the end of their songs (arguably starting with push the button), but the first two iterations of the group are full of excellent songs and distinctive attitude

**Luxaria** (8.333): The true answer to the Ship of Theseus problem really played out over the course of the noughties with a 3 member girl group.

**daretheghost** (8.278): I only knew “Push the Button” before this and of all these groups (bar Girls Aloud) I think I’m most likely to check out the rest of their discography because I’m loving this selection.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.244): obviously we can only rate so many songs and this is a pretty good representation of their most popular songs, but I wish their first album was included more because it's their best imo.

**nt96** (8.122): 8.12 Of all the UK girlies on this list, The Sugababes and Mis-Teeq are the only ones I can recall crossing over to US radio growing up and unsurprisingly they're amongst my faves.

**Melody** (8.111): 8.1

**moooo566** (8.111): i dont have an actual joke but im worried you guys have only had to read one million ship of theseus comments so here you go

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.067): the horniest group in the rate. an absolute shame that by the end of the 2000s, the sugababe's timeless brand of being horny in exciting, kitsch ways, had been replaced by postmodern anonymity. wtf?!?! shoutout to the OG 3 who reclaimed the Sugababes legacy and honor.

**qazz23** (8.000): most tracks are memorable and they have a good dancey sound with creative uses of samples

**Amazon4life** (8.000): Another iconic group

**Olivier77777** (7.922): 8.5

**welcome2thejam** (7.889): Needed a bit more time to click, but the good stuff is absolutely worth it

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.889): Excellent group with excellent music, what more could I say?

**plastichaxan** (7.867): Kinda surprised by my average here but they slayed

**StarSquash45** (7.833): it's crazy listening to their discography and hearing the vocal journey these three girls have been through. their last songs sound nothing like their first! :)

**cremeebrulee** (7.744): maybe the most consistent group for me, mayhaps i will do a discography dive

**fadedblue09** (7.667): An okay listen, though I'm quite sad that none of their songs reached the heights of pop perfection Push the Button (admittedly a high bar to clear).

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.667): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/292042312958083075/1008418317243002900/unknown.png

**thedoctordances1940** (7.567): Push The Button is such a classic i can forgive them for their not so good songs, but tbh i was expecting to like them more than I did, I feel like they were omnipresent at their peak but the music doesn't really live up to that

**kaanew** (7.556): slay

**OliviaGodrigo** (7.556): I was always more of a Girls Aloud fan but Sugababes are still legends!

**Marvelous2002** (7.533): I need them at this point, the last few groups have been so underwhelming (probably cause I'm not old enough to get them).😭 I know around half of their songs on here, excited to find the rest out!

**Smuckles** (7.444): Credit (?) to Sugababes for pushing the concept of what an artist is to the absolute limit. None of the original members were present by the time they disbanded! Their management wasn't going to even attempt to apologise that the name Sugababes was a brand first and the group members second. And then despite all that.. they were great? This era, looking back, was such a great one for pop music and Sugababes were at the forefront of it in the UK at their peak. Some of the best songs in the rate easily. Such a shame their name sucked.

**cancersgroove** (7.111): I loveee them, in all seriousness they're a solid girl group.

**vayyiqra** (6.889): Haha I love the Sugarcubes I love Bjonk idk what to say about this group though

**TiltControls** (6.889): this is an unintentional reverse flava

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.833): YouTube when I search for the album Songs by Sugar Babe

**flavasavavandal** (11): the amount of times I put this on repeat from my Ipod classic and danced, jumped and pranced around my bedroom so many times that I have vivid memories of doing this, it just makes me lose control of my body, the adrenaline that pumps through this song from the surf rock guitar just bopping against the more drum n’ bass inspired electronics, that just sends adrenaline pulsating throughout my body. This wasn’t just an entrance or a slay, it was a statement.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): For anyone here that’s a longtime fan of these groups, this is CERTAINLY an upset! Girls Aloud arguably have the most sustained fanbase out of the groups here, and had a massive moment in their heyday. And they came into the pop scene with a bang, clearing One True Voice as they got the Christmas #1 single. And it’s easy to see why! The iconic surf guitar lick, and cool-girl delivery of Xenomania’s brand of camp nonsense lyrics (the chorus was literally inspired by “The Wheels on the Bus”) They might have gotten the Christmas #1, but they sadly got the Y2UK #2 here!

# Surf’s Up

**BaconShoes** (11): smash of the century

**mysario** (11): if this was REALLY the sound of the underground, I'd be way more pale and living with the moles

**oscarbrierley1** (11): talk about starting your career off with a bang. The garage inspired beat, the guitar, the slowed down Bridge. It's so fun.

**slimboyfriend** (11): I gave my 11 to the song that I was most excited to discover (I’m American) because this song is like……. Legitimately cool

**welcome2thejam** (11): Hold on, this is a reality talent show band that somehow got to have this dope ass track as their debut single? That alone is possibly the biggest win in TV music contest history

**akanewasright** (10): why are these girls allowed to use surf rock guitars, I know what England is like and they’re not surfing

**Amazon4life** (10): What to say - amazing debut, still sounds great.

**apatel27** (10): This is how you come out and make a statement

**Awkward\_King** (10): i wish this was the sound of the underground instead its just like.. train screeching and groaning

**bbfan132** (10): this was their first single?? perfect debut single for sure

**BeauMeringue212** (10): When I tell indie boys I like surf rock I'm actually talking about this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): So we’re not talking about a really fabulous subway system here?

**cancersgroove** (10): this sound is so distinct

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is what alexis michelle performs for subway dads

**DirtyRat583** (10): the girls serving kunt from the get go

**Luxaria** (10): One True Voice were done dirty being put up against this. The bassline truly does jump in the backstreet light.

**Melody** (10): pov: it was the dawn of 2003, the UK had to witness the FLOPS that were Hear'say, corny boy bands, S Club and Atomic Kitten dominated (destoryed) the airwaves, but a tele talent show reshaped UK Pop for the rest of the 00s and showed us that women do SELL. Thank you SOTU and happy 20 years x

**moonagenightmares** (10): modern classic

**moooo566** (10): this bassline bangs so much

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): the way they debuted with an instantly iconic classic is insane. that surf guitar changed music

**qazz23** (10): off to a great start - this genre combination is very good! The mix of dance pop, surf rock guitar, and drum & bass just work well together (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if this is what the underground sounds like call me moleman

**robincav** (10): Changed pop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This song goes so hard, I didn’t even process that it samples Wheels on the Bus

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Spy movie soundtrack-ass sounding song (complimentary)

**Smuckles** (10): That surf rock guitar is inspired. A bespoke touch that you could only get away with in the 00's. I'm not sure how aware Girls Aloud really were of the underground though, are they trying to tell me they listened to Mclusky?

**StarSquash45** (10): The moment I hear that guitar riff, the girls HAVE MY ATTENTION. I can't believe they debuted with pop perfection

**Stryxen** (10): when I hear the word cyberpunk this is the vibe I imagine idk what that says about me

**thegolding** (10): there was a before and after with this song

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): pulp fiction type beat

**throwaway-7650** (10): this deserves the 11s, not biology

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): better than mezzanine, like a good math equation. First you start by making a boyband and girl group. second you make sure that you manufacture a song just in time for christmas 2k2. So, you start cranking the bass and make the rock elements a seasoning, NOT the main attraction. then just layer those voices and put down a tempo of 163 beats per minute--uk hardcore continuum beat stuff. All together, this shit sorta just vibes itself out and quickly makes you go awooga. monster good time that prolly set us on a pop path forward.

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): i'm kinda impressed at how sunny/surf-y this sounds for a group out of the uk

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): its a surf rock song, how can i not love it

**TiltControls** (9.5): If this is the sound of the underground just bury me in the earth

**agentofscranton** (9): the first time I listened to this with headphones on and the guitars travelled from one ear to the other? my entire world view changed in that instant

**criestotheclicking** (9): none of the vocal performances here are all that stellar but the song bangs incredibly hard. Iconic mic choreo

**daretheghost** (9): A banger of a debut single.

**plastichaxan** (9): the underground sounds like a slay

**seanderlust** (9): early 2000s pop music did sonic tension so well

**stbrigidiscross** (9): What an impactful debut, I've heard it a million times and it still sounds great

**vivaforever597** (9): I've come to appreciate this a lot more over the past year or so.

**1998tweety** (8.5): me when I'm waiting for the train and I hear it coming

**amr** (8.5): bridge is flat but I love the surf guitars still have nostalgia for this one

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): QUEENS of indie music

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): What a way to kick off the group! THIS is how you do a debut single.

**TCHALLA1966** (8.5): Cheryl beating up that woman is ingrained in my head when I hear this song.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): love a good old surf rock moment

**celladonn** (8): the surf guitar is so unique and fun

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): misleading title. The sound of the underground is clearly Wet Leg.

**kaanew** (8): first listen… this is a little outdated. 3rd listen… WATERS RUNNING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION

**MassiveThief** (7.5): kinda corny but I dig it

**MrSwearword** (7): the production goes off but something that I'm just saying about GA right now...their voices blended way too much and I literally could not tell who was singing what.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I’m afraid I don’t get this, it sounds like something from those Disney Channel *Zombies* films

**fadedblue09** (6): is that surf rock i hear

**frogaranaman** (6): the beach guitar had me yelling

# sound of the flops aloud

**Marvelous2002** (5.5): Iconic debut but I've never been a huge fan of the grungy sound

**starla\_** (4.5): this is like a kylie minogue song but bad

**hoolytoledo** (2): it’s a GA staple but I was never into it, oops

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): #MIS-SWEEP IS HERE!!!!!!!!!! Truly insane to me that the iconic, all-black girl group that had to deal with England’s fuckshit and never got a #1 single, was told black girls don’t sell magazines, just OUTDID the mammoth songs of Girls Aloud and Sugababes!!! Who would have thought?! Well, Scandalous has *never* lost its footing as the #1 song of the Y2UK Rate. I’m ECSTATIC! And what an incredible number that just gets better with age. The pulsing violin strings, the siren, the driving beat; not a moment in wasted and the girls ATE this song up. Sabrina sings with so much confidence while Alesha’s rapping here talks a more singsong hypeman approach in the pre-chorus. This song is that bitch, and officially Top of the Pop[head]s!

**flavasavavandal** (10): I never expected this to win, I always expected this to go out at 4th with plenty of tens, a few tankers but barely any 11s. But I was proven wrong, not only did it first, it didn’t receive a single sub 5 score and gathered the most 11s in the rate with 15. Maybe I underestimated how big this song actually was in America or in drag races cliques, or was biased since this was my first time ever hearing this song or group so I thought the same was true for everyone else. But it deserves every single one of those 11s and 10s. I wasn’t as huge on Mis-Teeq as most of the rate, but right from the get go this song captured everything I could ever want. An electronic sound that just has such a fierce momentum, capturing your muscles and forcing you to dance to the rhythm. A chorus featuring several unstoppable and undeniable hooks. Their voices have never sounded more in place, the synths, the bleeps, even the siren sound so precise, this might actually be perfection. Very happy it won. The only group here without a No. 1 in the UK finally getting some recognition

# Saw Drag Race UK or smthn

**1998tweety** (11): Vanity Milan you will ALWAYS be famous

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): i want to put vanity’s lipsync in a museum

**kaanew** (11): so so so scanda11ous

**nt96** (11): the single greatest thing Catwoman ever gave us

**plastichaxan** (11): I knew this after that drag race incredible lip sync and have been obsessed since wow what a moment

**raggedy-princess** (11): this has had me in a chokehold since middle school

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this song is 100% pure sex appeal, it's everything, it's raunchy in all the right ways, it's absolutely perfect

**sarcasticsobs** (11): Don’t care if it’s one of the “basic” picks, it’s THE SMASHA!!

**seanderlust** (11): the slomo in this video makes it look like a fancam that would be tweeted in the replies of a tweet being thoroughly ratioed

**starla\_** (11): this brings me back to being 11 and learning music video choreography from watching music videos on TV. So nostalgic and so good. The chorus is so hype.

**Stryxen** (11): me committing multiple crimes and scandals to rig this into winners rate

**WaneY2UKtoc** (11): saintly 11 dispatched to Non Stop Pop FM bop Scandalous. you need to realize that out of any song here, more cis white dipshit teens inadvertently know this. anytime in GTA V Online you needed money, the smart move (besides glitching lol remember the money glitch?) was carjacking and selling the range rover car once ever 48 minutes. the range rover car is ALWAYS set to the Non Stop Pop FM station hosted by Cara Delevingne (arguably the most important playlist of pop music of the early 2010s; that station legit created a bunch of subconscious poptimists and sincerely went the distance in curating a god tier mix of music that never got boring). Anyways there was practically a 1 in 5 chance Scandalous would be playing as you drove down to the car shop to sell it for $9k gamer bucks and it fucking bopped. like anytime I was driving and I heard those sirens I'd put my controller down and bop my hands up n' down with a blank stare. always incredibly fun to play this ditty (or glamorous) while playing multiplayer with straight white high schoolers who clearly didn't get it or realize the simple pleasures of ingenious god tier pop. Scandalous just fucking "yass and slays" to a degree that is confident, swaggering, and a lil' devious. brilliant, brilliant ditty that hits the q-zone immaculately.

# No negative title, this is a very slay winner indeed

**agentofscranton** (10): duh

**apatel27** (10): This beat so god damn dirty

**Awkward\_King** (10): rate winner RATE WINNER

**cancersgroove** (10): , same deal with Pure Shores, but at night in the city.

**celladonn** (10): this beat is so good

**CrimsonROSET** (10): IT’S THE SMASHA

**daretheghost** (10): I will allow sirens in songs this one (1) time.

**DirtyRat583** (10): (not very) fun fact: the iraq war began 3 days after this song was released. how scandalous

**ImADudeDuh** (10): WOW!!!!!!!

**Luxaria** (10): A strong contender for the eleven, this better go FAR

**Melody** (10): Everything about this song??? The vocals, the rapping and the general vibe! The iconic infectious Chrous and Alesha herself??? Such a SLAY. Shocked this never went No.1, its so iconic.

**MrSwearword** (10): be it the U.S. single edit or the video which uses the best part of the Jazzwad remix for the end, this song is immaculate.

**nootnoot781** (10): obligatory vanity milan comment

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): a club ANTHEM that could deservingly win this rate

**oscarbrierley1** (10): such immaculate production, crazy that stargate did both this and it's ok! This song always sounded so cool to me as a child.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Banger with a capital B.

**qazz23** (10): really good beat and even a 🎻 (11 candidate)

**robincav** (10): Everybody are you feeling the vibe!!! Legendary song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): worldwide smasha!!! still impactful and badass

**StarSquash45** (10): 🚨🚨🚨🚨‼️

**stbrigidiscross** (10): This is their biggest hit for a reason, it's really fantastic from the sirens to Su-Elise's "So so so Scandalous"

**TCHALLA1966** (10): this song is every bit of amazing it’s just so good from the beginning to the end.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): No lip sync song has entered my rotation so quickly

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): smashalous

**throwaway-7650** (10): ppl predicting this wins... when it goes out at #6

**welcome2thejam** (10): Fantastic chorus build. Just that damn good in near every area.

**bbfan132** (9.5): an absolute hit

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9.5): this and Home Tonight should have smashed in America

**akanewasright** (9): This is really good, but I wish one of their more garage based songs got the big hype. I really prefer that energetic, distinctive sound from them, but this is still a serve

**BaconShoes** (9): bop

**criestotheclicking** (9): sounds kind of like Family Affair

**fadedblue09** (9): Doesn't quite hit the full marks for me but I see the appeal

**thegolding** (9): this is such a boppppp this was the only I know from Mis-Teeq before this rate tho

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): honestly i don't get the hype for this fully, but it is the best of the frontrunners

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): smash

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Kinda funny that they say “a one night stand just ain’t enough” considering they have another song called “One Night Stand” that sounds pretty similar. This is a banger but I had to dock it a few points once I realized that it sounds like a computer is farting in the intro.

**MassiveThief** (8): some real good flows

**Smuckles** (8): All the Americans are just going to make Recess comments :(

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is probably gonna be their highest ranked song in this rate and i totally get the appeal, but i cant help but feel like just doesnt stand up to some of mis teeq’s other songs in this rate. if this wins though i absolutely cant object

**TiltControls** (7): I know this is their big breakout... but I think most of their other songs are much stronger than this (and much more entertaining!)

**Marvelous2002** (6.5): This one's exciting!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): The song behind this is good but there’s just some… really questionable production choices.

**DirtyRat583** (9.733): nobody can do it like they can. had my bussy shaking when i could barely walk

**thegolding** (9.667): 10

**Amazon4life** (9.611): Best girl group ever. Their discography is amazing.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.300): I knew that they made quite a few bops but i didn't realise it was THIS many

**agentofscranton** (9.278): nawt two of my favourite singles being excluded from the rate - stream The Loving Kind and Untouchable!

**apatel27** (9.167): Talk about timeless music

**vayyiqra** (9.111): The only group I knew well going into this rate, and what a group! Their ~~quirky approach to songwriting sets them apart from other pop girl groups of their time and also they have an album cover that's purple so I like them.

**robincav** (9.111): Pretty amazing and revolutionary

**OliviaGodrigo** (9.111): They mothered me

**StarSquash45** (9.056): Their lyrics never make any sense, they work on vibes alone, and I appreciate that as someone who can never make out any lyrics ever

**Melody** (8.889): 8.9

**qazz23** (8.889): a good mix of sounds and no weak tracks, they do the dancey and catchy stuff really well

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.878): sarah idk we never met but im glad I got to hear your voice on these cuts RIP. girls aloud you all had ideas. i know the pop machine was brutal and somehow y'all never made it to the US imagination but these are rewarding cuts.

**throwaway-7650** (8.667): it took me an embarrassingly long time to listen to a song of theirs outside of biology but I'm so glad I did this rate. so many fun BOPS!

**daretheghost** (8.667): Girls Aloud is the group I’m most familiar with going into this rate and while I wouldn’t necessarily call myself a huge fan of theirs I do like quite a bit of their material, largely due to Xenomania’s production. Some of their songs take some wild twists & turns and there’s usually something kinetic about them that makes their discography a blast to listen to.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.611): the most acclaimed group in the rate and for good reason! they manage to be so experimental and forward thinking while still being radio friendly at the same time, its kinda surprising that they never really picked up a large fanbase outside of the uk

**Olivier77777** (8.556): 9

**sarcasticsobs** (8.511): GO GIRLS G-G-GO GO GO

**nt96** (8.500): 8.5 great way to start this rate!

**oscarbrierley1** (8.478): I love girls aloud, they were my 3rd most played artist last year. They have so many other bops that weren't made singles. so if anyone likes these songs and haven't listened to their other songs they should.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.356): they just have so many classics, yeah they'll probably dominate this rate for the most part but for good reason

**welcome2thejam** (8.333): Great way to start the rate, honestly had middling expectations for my scores coming in, but hopefully this is a sign of things to come and not an instant peak

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.222): slay pun and slay music

**plastichaxan** (8.222): They just ate I don’t know what to tell you, though I think my average is a bit higher than what I think I can’t see myself lowering any of these scores

**raggedy-princess** (8.111): Favorite discovery of the rate!

**kappyko** (7.889): unfortunately the best songs here are ones i knew already

**akanewasright** (7.889): I have a lot of thoughts most of these other groups so much, but honestly I just think Girls Aloud are neat, they just get great songs and have a good time

**Marvelous2002** (7.611): ICONIC. HIGHEST OF GIRL GROUP ROYALTY. (sometimes complemented but sometimes carried by their writers and producer). Absolutely love them, if I was older during their reign I would probably stan, def my fave group from that era

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.389): Pretty much nothing under 5 for this group. RIP Sarah Harding.

**Luxaria** (7.333): There should be regular re-runs of their tour footage and the ghost hunting show they did tbh, messy icons

**slimboyfriend** (7.278): Bonkers is how I’d describe their niche

**TiltControls** (7.278): A couple duds, but some of the strongest and most iconic tracks in the rate besides those

**criestotheclicking** (7.222): I love the mismatched feel. The members feel like they work well in spite of the group’s composition

**Smuckles** (7.111): That's a strong list of songs you know! They brought their own personality to these tracks with a good mix of different sounds and homages. I can appreciate this in my old age! A strong argument for the best act to come out of a talent game show.

**kaanew** (6.889): pop perfection

**moonagenightmares** (6.400): i was surprised at how many of these songs i recognized. I only knew sound of the underground by name

**cancersgroove** (6.389): still getting into them, LOVE their version of "here we go".

**frogaranaman** (5.778): why can I so clearly picture the UK listening to this group

**fadedblue09** (5.778): Considering all the poptimist praise I've seen for this group, I'm….kinda whelmed with what I've heard. Maybe because I'm just not a production type of person, but a lot of these songs just felt typical girl group pop to me

**cremeebrulee** (5.678): they really had these girls singing just anything

darjeelingdarkroast: I am once again asking for a reunion and please collab with PinkPantheress, Bree Runway, Shygirl, FKA Twigs, Jade Thirlw-

flavasavavandal: I’m not familiar with Mis-Teeq despite growing up around the same time as they were releasing music. Probably because they never got the same level of exposure as Girls Aloud or the Sugababes or maybe it was for other reasons. Either way I’m glad to have discovered them now even if I don’t love them as much as others. Still a great group worthy of recognition and Scandalous slays so fucking hard.

**nt96** (10.125): 9.8 Me? A Mis-Teeq stan? A hoe for UK Garage?? What makes you say that? I remember when Scandalous was on the radio when Catwoman was still in theaters and while everyone was dragging the film, here was little old me enjoying the hell out of this track in the corner! Revisiting that song on GTA V only bolstered my love for them. Stan Mis-Teeq!

**WaneY2UKtoc** (9.950): mis-teeq is my (sonic) wives and all of them and I are in a beautiful relationship where they talk and I listen and nod accordingly bc Im so happy for them. I stay noided.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.762): the absolute fucking slays, every song is absolutely amazing and iconic and incredible, they have the talent and deserve THE WORLD!!!

**apatel27** (9.625): Understated British Icons

**Olivier77777** (9.375): 9

**throwaway-7650** (9.313): they deserve to have the highest average, no bad songs 💋

**sarcasticsobs** (9.313): I will protect them at all costs

**plastichaxan** (9.287): The amount of energy in their songs is incredible I believe their music could keep me awake for days bopping without a problem

**indie\_fan\_** (9.225): The only all-black girl group here, of course imma support them the most.

**cancersgroove** (9.188): there's just that certain blend of R&B, pop, garage, and dancehall that makes them stand out.

**akanewasright** (9.188): Brilliant talented incredible etc GOD I love this group. Alesha Dixon is my rate MVP, and I really love how *distinctive* the group is, like none of these songs could go to any other group in the rate

**DirtyRat583** (9.125): 'STOP DRINKING MY WATER!' the slay fountain exclaimed. But Mis-Teeq couldn’t stop…they just kept drinking and became mothers.

**welcome2thejam** (9.000): Would not be opposed to the Mis-Teeq #Mis-Sweep

**celladonn** (8.938): Outside of a few songs, I really wasn't very familiar with any of the groups in this rate. Mis-Teeq was one of the groups I was least familiar with, but they ended up being far and away my favourite, their sound is so good!

**DaHumanTorch** (8.825): i'd never even heard of this group before the rate so this was such a pleasant surprise, i absolutely adored them!! so many collapses and was so close to 11ing scandalous

**kaanew** (8.625): elite girl group that loves strings just as much as I do

**qazz23** (8.625): love the R&B dancey sound, "Scandalous" is a big standout

**Stryxen** (8.550): never knew they were so good, and this was a great excuse to listen to then and more of their discography thanks luv xxxx

**vayyiqra** (8.500): The best find of the rate, this group has lots of fun, upbeat, well-produced ditties. They're also very consistent, and their remixes all kick ass, so it's hard to not like them.

**Melody** (8.375): 8.4

**robincav** (8.313): The genre blending >>>>

**TiltControls** (8.250): Easily the strongest group in the rate (based on the representatives). Everyone else had a few misses but Mis-Teeq was good the whole way through

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.125): mis-teeq is just so fun to listen to, with the exception of home tonight all of these songs are absolute jams and it’s impossible to not want to get up and dance to them. glad this rate introduced me to them!

**daretheghost** (7.875): I had never heard of Mis-Teeq before this rate! (I have no recollection of RPDRUKS3.) They were highly-lauded by some friends so I was looking forward to this sampler, and I wasn’t disappointed. Their sound is a little of-the-time but it’s a time when I was really getting into their brand of funky r&b so I don’t mind it much.

**fadedblue09** (7.750): Pleasantly surprised by this group. Love their performances a lot and I really enjoyed their fusion of R&B with different genres.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.750): Mis-Teeq are the group I was least familiar with coming into this, but funnily enough I feel like Alesha Dixon is who I have seen the most on British telly of anybody in this rate. But like yeah they have some really good tracks especially when they were delving into genres like garage

**cremeebrulee** (7.662): we love a group with talented rappers, easily one of the more exciting part of the rate

**OliviaGodrigo** (7.625): Definitely the group I’m least familiar with, I only heard Scandalous before this rate

**oscarbrierley1** (7.588): severely underrated, apart from scandalous. If they'd released a couple more albums they would be in the same conversation as girls aloud and sugababes

**agentofscranton** (7.438): the difference between pre- and post-Strictly Come Dancing Alesha Dixon's careers is night and day

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.375): Is it no surprise that Alesha is my favourite member? I love the energy she always brings to these songs. I love the remixes the most, especially All I Want and Be With Me. (Ofc let's not forget Scandalous as well, that's a certified banger!)

**raggedy-princess** (7.375): wish they had a more extensive discography but Scandalous is great enough to establish a legacy on its own

**Smuckles** (7.375): Fuck yeah, most of this has aged well! Alesha Dixon probably scared the shit out of a number of elderly pensioners who accidentally turned on TOTP back in the day but her delivery sounds great looking back. There's a few slow-jam numbers in this song list that I don't remember hearing but they're real good, I might like them more than the big hits.

**StarSquash45** (7.125): queens of radio edits

**criestotheclicking** (7.125): garage music is just sooo good.

**slimboyfriend** (6.875): These are the fun girls who know how to dance

**thegolding** (6.625): 6

**Marvelous2002** (5.838): Before my time but excited to get cultured! Haven't heard anything from them before this

**uberpigeon** (5.500): 6 the strings kind of tire me

**Amazon4life** (4.875): Never listened to them, but I love Alesha Dixon.

# Songs

Congratulations to **Scandalous** for pulling off the win and being the only 9+ score in the rate! Across all songs Scandalous places **69th**. It scored slightly better than Michael Jackson's Beat It and slightly worse than Bleacher's Don't Take the Money.
