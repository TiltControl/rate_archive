Hello [gorgey huns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EB8rgZwjzo), and welcome to the Y2UK Girl Groups rate on popheads! We're your hosts, [darjeelingdarkroast and berober04](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201986/rs_634x1024-190906192246-634.Amber-Rose-Gill-Greg-OShea.ct.090619.jpg?fit=around%7C634:1024&output-quality=90&crop=634:1024;center,top). I'm so excited to share with you all a lineup of some of the UK's most exciting girl groups from the 2000s. [So girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUxrZ87CG9A), let's get into this!

In the 1990s, British music was flourishing and reaching global success with the "Cool Britannia" era of Britpop acts like Blur, Oasis and Pulp. With this came the record-breaking success of girl group the Spice Girls. Their brash brand of dance-pop gave way to more bubblegum pop acts. By the 2000s, the bright shiny pop of acts like S Club 7 left ample room for a new and inventive sound to take over. Various underground sounds of UK pop and alternative music in the 90s were brewing, and some keen producers and dynamic young women honed in on these sounds to make [2000s pop fresh and exciting.](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/bv8gp4/every-number-one-uk-hit-y2k-2000-chart-chaos)

The groups in this rate offered a variety of sounds as they climbed to the top of the UK Charts and captivated young hearts of TV shows like Top of the Pops. There's a variety of sounds here: the sophisticated All Saints coming forth in the mid-90s; the icy-cool of the Sugababes’ first song "Overload" in 2000; the joyous bubblegum pop of Atomic Kitten; the madcap energy of Girls Aloud; the fresh UK garage sound of Mis-Teeq; and the floor-filling EDM of The Saturdays rounding out the 2000s into the early 2010s. There's a lot of fun bops in the rate, plus a lot of cutting-edge sounds of pop music where young upstarts like producers Richard X and Brian Higgins (Xenomania) took pop music in exciting and bold directions.

**Song Selection:** I selected the following songs due to a variety of factors. First, I went through curating songs that had some of the groups' highest chart placements. That was just one factor, as I was then hoping to strike a balance of each group's eras and get some fan favorites in ~~me payola-ing in “On the Metro”~~. I worked with a handful of British popheads in the Daily Discussion and Discord to get their feedback on the list to make sure the songs chosen were best representative of each group. Hard cuts were made, but I hope the 8-9 songs of each group gives a great teaser of these fun girl groups!

# [Girls Aloud](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932371201676939285/974590081472036884/GirlsAloudCover.jpg)

Girls Aloud were formed in 2002 from a music competition reality show, *Pop Stars: The Rivals*. After the final 5 girls were chosen--Nadine Coyle, Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts, Sarah Harding and Kimberley Walsh–they competed with other prefab group One True Voice. Both groups were vying for the Christmas number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. Girls Aloud beat their rivals with the sleek, surf-guitar filled "Sound of the Underground". The Girls proved to be an unstoppable force in British pop music, nabbing four Number 1s on the Official UK Singles Chart. After a break in 2009 and comeback, Girls Aloud ended in 2013. Following the death of member Sarah Harding, remaining members regrouped for the first time in almost a decade for a charity run for her memory.

Their work with Brian Higgins and Miranda Cooper at Xenomania production company are considered some of the most zany and interesting takes of mainstream pop music. Xenomania often took a very patchwork approach to crafting pop songs. They would have the girls sing snippets of hundreds of songs and then piece those together into their hits. Look no further than what many consider their signature song, "Biology". It's a song that starts with a bluesy piano jaunt that abruptly transitions to giddy electropop. The lyrics like "so I got my cappuccino to go, and I'm headed for the hills again" are nonsensical and disjointed, and that's besides the point. It's campy and alluring pop music at its best, making Girls Aloud one of Britain's most beloved girl groups.

# [All Saints](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932371201676939285/974590081190989834/AllSaintsCover.jpg)

All Saints are the oldest group in this lineup. The earliest iteration of the group was in 1993 with All Saints 1.9.7.5, which comprised singers Shaznay Lewis, Melanie Blatt and Simone Rainford. The group wasn't finding any success, and Simone soon departed the group. By 1997, the group was reborn with sisters Natalie and Nicole Appleton and started working with pop producer Cameron McVey (who, fun fact, is married to Neneh Cherry and father to UK pop artist Mabel). Their first song as a quartet, "I Know Where It's At", went to #4 on the UK Singles Chart. They truly made a name for themselves with their subsequent single "Never Ever", which was their first #1 single on the charts. It also peaked at #4 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

Carving a niche as a sultrier answer to the bright and bubbly Spice Girls, All Saints incorporated pop, R&B and hip-hop influences into their music. Their second album was produced in part by William Orbit, who worked on Madonna’s *Ray of Light*. This can be heard in the blissful "Pure Shores" that smoothly sails with the girls' harmonies. "Pure Shores" and "Black Coffee" reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart. However, shortly after the next single "All Hooked Up" peaked at #7, All Saints announced they were going on a break with rumors of a falling out. After various solo records, All Saints reunited in 2006 but their comeback album *Studio 1* failed to match their prior success. An opener slot with the Backstreet Boys' UK Tour in 2014 led All Saints to reunite again and they've since put out two records.

# [Mis-Teeq](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932371201676939285/974590080368902174/MisteeqCover.jpg)

The iconic UK Garage and R&B group Mis-Teeq formed in South London in 1998. The initial group of Sabrina Washington and Alesha Dixon was formed, adding Tina Barrett. Tina would later join S Club 7 and was replaced with Su-Elise Nash and Zena McNally. Their first song, the R&B jam "Why?" was quickly remixed by Matt "Jam" Lamont into a [garage track](https://consequence.net/2022/03/uk-garage-explainer-genre-dance/) that was a hit in this underground, burgeoning scene. Zena then departed the band, and the trio went on to work with several producers to create their debut album, *Lickin on Both Sides*. Their subsequent singles like "All I Want" and "One Night Stand" continue this balance of alluring R&B and rambunctious garage, taking their music into the Top 10 UK Singles chart. Deemed the UK’s "answer to Destiny's Child or TLC", several songs featured Sabrina's velvety singing juxtaposed with Alesha's hard-hitting rap bridges. Other songs incorporated the group's Caribbean influences like the steel drum-inflected "B With Me (Bump & Flex Mix)"; not to mention Alesha Dixon rapping flow inspired by the dancehall artists like Shabba Ranks that she'd hear growing up at Notting Hill.

After a small break, the trio returned with their album *Eye Candy*. It included their biggest hit and signature song, "Scandalous". A sleek R&B midtempo number with jagged strings and blaring sirens, it peaked at #2 in the UK Charts and entered the US Top 40. Other singles followed, and with the shutting down of their label the group disbanded in 2005. An exciting trio, they proudly infused their garage and Caribbean roots into their music and left an indelible mark on UK pop music.

# [Atomic Kitten](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932371201676939285/974590080108888074/AtomicKittenCover.jpg)

A pop group hailing from Liverpool, Atomic Kitten began as the brainchild of former members of 80s synth pop group Orchestral Manouvres in the Dark, Andy McCluskey and Stuart Kershaw. Their first album *Right Now* produced five top ten singles, such as the jubilant title track with its [aggressively 2000s music video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Yynstc_bFRE/maxresdefault.jpg). Right before their hit single "Whole Again" came out, original member Kerry Katona quit and was replaced by Jenny Frost. "Whole Again" was their biggest single, staying at #1 for four weeks in the UK. The final trio (as another original member, Heidi Range, went on to form Sugababes v2) comprised Liz McClarnon, Natasha Hamilton and Jenny Frost. 

On their next album the group explored new sounds like the slinky, disco-tinged "Be With You", featuring an Electric Light Orchestra sample. With their eyes primed for a US takeover, the girls worked on the new single, "Love Doesn't Have to Hurt". However, with Natasha wanting to focus on her new family, the group slowly started to fade out of the limelight, petering into an eventual hiatus by 2006. Atomic Kitten briefly reunited in 2012 (with Kerry, Natasha and Liz) and appeared on a show where several pop groups made a comeback. However, the 2010s was a shaky time for their comeback as internal conflict in the group had caused a tour with All Saints to get canceled. Kerry left again, and in 2020 the group reformed with Jenny back in the saddle. Their reworking of their song "Whole Again" for England heading towards the European Football Championship had England falling in love all over again with the trio.

# [Sugababes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932371201676939285/974590080884826122/SugababesCover.jpg)

Sugababes formed in 1998 with childhood friends Keisha Buchanan and Mutya Buena, joined by Siobhán Donaghy. Working closely with the All Saints team, including producer Cameron McVey, Sugababes released their first single and Top 10 song "Overload" in September 2000. A sparse, bass-driven and hypnotic song, it stood out from their cheery contemporaries. Three singles followed before Siobhán left the group over "bullying" allegations of the other girls. The group then brought on former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, and their second album included the genre-defying mash-up song "Freak Like Me" (with a [great video by Trash Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na3VYQN5kEc) on this song). More singles and a third album had this Sugababes lineup on top of the UK Charts.

Eventually, Mutya left the group in 2005 and brought on further lineup changes that were often the punchline of the UK media. Mutya was replaced with Amelle Berrabah who was on their hit song "About You Now" (that also ended up on iCarly). Founding member Keisha left the group in 2009 and was replaced by 2009 Eurovision UK entrant Jade Ewan. Fans were missing the old group which now had no original members, and the group disbanded in 2011. The original three–Keisha, Mutya and Siobhán–worked to reclaim the Sugababes name, having a stint as MKS in the 2010s, and officially came back as the Sugababes in 2019. A beloved group with a variety of sounds and eras, their return signaled new music and unreleased songs for the public to enjoy.

# [The Saturdays](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/932371201676939285/974590080612184074/SaturdaysCover.jpg)

The newest group in our lineup, The Saturdays were formed in 2007 through Polydor records. They started off supporting Girls Aloud on tour, and were often offered their rejected songs. The Saturdays eventually forged their own path with bright, dynamic songs like "Issues" and the anthemic "Forever is Over". Songs such as the latter had a chorus belted out by youngest member Vanessa White, with other members Frankie Bridge, Rochelle Wiseman, Una Healy and Mollie King closely behind. Their first two albums entered the Top 10 UK Albums chart with several songs on the Top 10 UK Singles chart as well. 

The early 2010s marked pop music shifting into a blown-out, EDM-inspired electropop sound, and The Saturdays followed suit. After a running joke that rapper Flo Rida kept blocking them from the #1 spot, they eventually collaborated with him on the banger "Higher". Other hard-hitting dance-pop songs like "Notorious" and "All Fired Up" followed. Their first #1 was another collaboration, the reggae-meets-electropop "What About Us" with a Sean Paul feature. Soon the Saturdays were eyeing a US takeover, and nabbed an E! Television reality show about this attempt. "What About Us" entered the US Dance charts and peaked at 27, but failed to garner much success stateside. After a campy turn with "Gentleman" and other singles, The Saturdays went on hiatus in 2014.

# Bonus Rate - Solo Songs

If there are two things members of British girl groups love, it's trying to break into America and releasing solo material. When it comes to the latter, here are some solo songs from these members! Some are beloved classics and others are deep cuts from the girls trying to make it out on their own.

# Rules & Instructions

PLEASE READ THESE THOROUGHLY TO AVOID HAVING TO DEAL WITH ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR BALLOT LATER.

* **You must listen to and score every song in the main rate.** Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.
* **Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10** and can include one decimal place but no more. So 7.3 is fine but 7.31 is not.
* **You may give one song in the whole rate a score of 11 and one other a score of 0** so, if you want to award these scores, save them for your favourite and least favourite songs in the rate respectively.
* **We'd encourage you to leave comments** of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, **they must be in this format**, simply leaving one space after your score:

>Push the Button: 7 Salt n Pepa outsold

Any other format such as:

>Disco Love: This subreddit to anything Jessie Ware touches (10  
>  
>Black Coffee: 1: I'm more a latte person myself

will get your ballot rejected.

* Conversely, if you want to include comments for a **specific group**, you can do so like this:

>Group: All Saints: is this a canonized group

* **Your ballot must be formatted exactly like the template in the message link** so make sure you use it or the template in the backup pastebin for your scores to be accepted.
* **Your scores will not be confidential** and will be revealed, along with any comments, with your username attached.
* **DO NOT SABOTAGE** the rate by giving outrageously low/high scores for the sole purpose of skewing the results, we reserve the right to exclude any ballot we suspect of this. If you're worried your scores could be mistakenly perceived as such, all you need to do is leave comments explaining the reasoning behind them.
* **If you want to change any of your scores** or comments after you've already submitted your ballot, feel free to message me before the deadline either here on reddit, or my Discord username darjeelingdark#4047

In case you missed it

**DEADLINE FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 16th**
