https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/xm2zib/y2uk_girl_groups_rate_reveal_day_1_a_gentleman_is/

Hello everyone, and welcome to the first day of the Y2UK Girl Groups rate, where there will be a showdown between some of the UK's most beloved girl bands. Plus, I'd like to update you all on the official [new post-monarchy currency](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/984163964030169178/1022605220863295518/unknown.png) of the UK ❤️ (Credit to u/whoisValensi)

We are eliminating main rate songs **52-34**, and bonus rate songs **#8 and #7**.

u/berober04 can't make today, so I'm here with the iconic former 70's Soul co-hostie/Little Child Running Wild defender u/flavasavavandal, ready to see who flopped on the Popheads Rate Charts today!

The reveal will start at **2pm EST/7pm GMT**, so when this post is an hour.

**flavasavavandal** (7): “this can’t be a RHCP cover” - me 30 seconds before realising it was in fact a RHCP cover. More trip hop inspired, the man who wrote the song ended up calling the cover misguided since they changed some of the lyrics to make it less personally engaging. Definitely misdirected and they probably shouldn’t have done it, but they did, and it’s still pretty good (also I’m not really a fan of RHCP)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): well no surprise that this is last! It wasn’t always last, but its fair share of zeroes determined that. They chose this single as Natalie was a big Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. I think the trip-hop elements and xylophone throughout are cool. Still, it came from a good place but not the wisest decision. At first I had both this and it’s fellow A-Side a Lady Marmalade cover, but thought that would get crushed by the iconic 2001 version. Looks like this 90s Cali Alt Rock jam also met an unfortunate fate! Stream Jane’s Addiction Ritual de lo Habitual

---

#California Girls

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): These ladies were always all about VOCALS!

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): lol they did a cover of the RHCP classic. this is trip hop (whatever that term means)

**bbfan132** (9): it is a weird cover choice, but i admire the audacity of it and it turned out well! i like the trip hop sound with the rock undertones towards the end

**StarSquash45** (9): i don't know the original and frankly i don't need to, this is so good

**daretheghost** (8.5): I remember thinking this song was SO COOL when I was younger-and you can hardly go wrong with Nellee Hooper–though now I can see why Anthony Kiedis doesn’t care much for it because it does strip away most–it not all–of the original’s significance.

**kaanew** (8): petition to use this on the alt rock radio station playlists instead of the rhcp version

**RandomHypnotica** (8): when this first started I was really REALLY thrown… but honestly? It's kinda fun

**Smuckles** (8): All Saints confirmed subscribers at r/mainstreamrockheads

**amr** (7.7): a bit distasteful but I can't make it not hit SORRY...!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Excellent cover, but fuck Anthony Kledis.

**starla\_** (7.5): not as good as the original but decent

**MrSwearword** (7): it's not as bad as people are gonna say it is, but I'm guessing this is what inspired rave dj to become a thing.

**nt96** (7): omg is this 90s alt rock?

**oscarbrierley1** (7): this song was really controversial with the rock stans at the time. I don't mind it, but I prefer other songs.

**raggedy-princess** (7): was not expecting this crossover but I'm not mad at it

**Stryxen** (7): i 11d the original in the 90s rate for some reason

#Give It Away Now

**vivaforever597** (7): I liked it better when Diana Vickers recorded it and called it My Wicked Heart.

**throwaway-7650** (6.6): would be a 10 if a minute or 2 was cut down

**1998tweety** (6.5): Adele remains unbothered

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I thought this was mediocre and then I learned it was a Red Hot Chili Peppers song and it made sense

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i’m rating this as we’re talking about if they want to fuck god… it looks likely tbh

**Melody** (6): these drag on for very long

**stbrigidiscross** (6): I really liked it at the time and it's a nice use of the sample and they did really transform the song but I don't feel much of a desire to hear it ever again.

**seanderlust** (5.2): RHCP vastly outsold

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): why am i listening to rhcp in this rate

**akanewasright** (5): what a fucking unhinged choice of a song to cover

**celladonn** (5): a red hot chili peppers cover? how odd. i feel like this loses a lot of the meaning of the original

**frogaranaman** (5): ayo??

**hoolytoledo** (5): not sure how I feel about this cover. The concept is pretty cool, but idk. I’m indifferent with this one

**Marvelous2002** (5): We're going somewhere now!!! excited

**qazz23** (5): don't care for this cover, but it's not the worst thing ever

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): I am usually pro-pop covers of rock songs (see my Love Machine comment), and I would rather not be a RHCP gatekeeper or defender, but All Saints are putting me in a tough spot. It really does feel like they glossed over the difficult content of the original, and made a cover based off just vibes. There’s some trip-hop flavour keeping me from tanking this more, but yeah, not Nellee Hooper’s best work.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): so I wasn't paying attention when this start, went "are they interpolating RHCP?" and then looked and saw it was a cover. Anyways, this isn't great.

**BaconShoes** (4): now… i would not have chosen to do this with this song

**cherryices** (4): these verses are a mess :(

**kappyko** (4): This score's actually for the red hot chili peppers :/

**sarcasticsobs** (4): :irenenose: Chorus isn’t bad. Very unsure on the skritchy-scratchy over the riff. I wanna hear that riff! Lemme hear it!

**welcome2thejam** (4): Don't have it in me to be youtube comments level of upset, but also don't enjoy this either

**Amazon4life** (3): Can't stand this version of the song, so dull.

**BeauMeringue212** (3): just cos you can doesn't mean you should

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Indirect misandry is coming to tank this. Also it’s just not good.

**fadedblue09** (3): Another borefest. Are they not aware of the concept of radio edits

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): I didn't like it when the Red Hot Chili Peppers did it either

**uberpigeon** (3): they want to be in the Criminal mv so bad.....

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): yeah the trolls under the bridge maybe

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Yeah this is a really bad cover, I don’t even like the original but it’s clearly more effective. Reminds me of how The Cardigans used to do metal covers on their albums but at least they made them cute.

**moooo566** (2): maybe i'd like it more if i wasn't very familiar with the original, but basically every change they've made just makes it sound worse. it's only really any good in the chorus which is basically the same but with their voices, and i can't really credit them with that anyway.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): as a californian, am I allowed to feel offended?

**moonagenightmares** (1): snooze

**TiltControls** (1): I keep expecting to hear parts that should be there and they aren't and vice versa. It's weird and I don't like it

**babadork** (0): I don’t understand why there are so many covers, but I also don’t like to be reminded that the Red Hot Chili Peppers exist.

**MassiveThief** (0): someone other than RHCP doing this song is just not a good idea

**mysario** (0): men? in my gurls rate???

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): genuinely what were they thinking

#🫂
**vayyiqra** (0): [trauma dump comment feel free to ignore] Look, I can't do this. RHCP are my brother's favourite band. "Under the Bridge" is one of his favourite songs. Not long ago, my brother saw RHCP live and got a copy of the setlist and was thrilled. "Under the Bridge" was the encore. My brother is also a drug addict. The original is a heartbreaking song about drug addiction, and this cover changes the lyrics and erases that and misses the whole point. I know RHCP are not liked on Popheads and have a long history of being toxic creeps, but nevertheless, if I hear that song, I am going to want to cry. This may have had good intentions, but it's ... yeah I hate it. Also, every comment I see about how this "outsold the original" or whatever pains me. Anyway I need a hug now. :hugging:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Their fourth single after “Whole Again”, and yet another attempt at capturing that song’s mellow glory. Looking up the backstory of this song is as boring as the song itself

---

#OLL KORRECT HIVE!!!!

**Amazon4life** (10): I would've given it 11 if it wasn't for Black Coffee.

**TiltControls** (10): When they've got the right song for it, the group's vocals are actually really sweet and heartwarming

**Awkward\_King** (9): idk how to describe this better than like... it feels very la-di-da, but that can be a nice thing!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Love yourselves kitties.

**1998tweety** (8): not to be ok

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): I’m good and I’m feeling all right

**vivaforever597** (8): The remixes are better. A Shaniafied treatment would have been ideal.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): very Natasha Bedingfield

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Why the exclamation point?!

**StarSquash45** (7): who is Anna and why does she need so much reassurance

**BaconShoes** (6.5): catchy

#ok girls give us nothing

**WaneY2UKtoc** (6): the light uk garage/beat elements here are fine.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): who the fuck is anna

**Marvelous2002** (5.5): Kinda cute

**Melody** (5): boo!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB08nQOEMcA

**starla\_** (5): balladphobia

**bbfan132** (4.5): this sounds like a hoku outtake

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): This is so devastatingly boring

**oscarbrierley1** (0): stargate really has the range. They produced the iconic bop of scandalous and whatever this is. We didn't need the r&b/folk/country combo. There isnt even any interesting vocal moments to give it a point.


#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obgnr9pc820

**nt96** (6.5): accurate song description

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): [see song title but without the exclamation mark]

**celladonn** (6): me about this song

**criestotheclicking** (6): autological title there

**CrimsonROSET** (6): come on you’re making this too easy

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): it really is

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): you could say its... fine

**Stryxen** (6): you said it not me

**akanewasright** (5): I feel like this would have been better if it sampled Johann Pachelbel’s Canon in D

**daretheghost** (5): What was with that period of pop music where everyone went ever-so-slightly twangy?

**MrSwearword** (5): something tells me this was said during a lot of meetings AK had to sit through.

**qazz23** (5): omg these comments will write themselves

**Smuckles** (5): Can probably guess what the comments will look like on this one.

**stbrigidiscross** (5): see the title. It's part of the samey rut that they got stuck in where all their songs sounded really similar.

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): <insert song title here>

**welcome2thejam** (5): Don't make me say it

**ImADudeDuh** (4): love it when songs that set up their own banner comments

**plastichaxan** (4): is it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): more like it’s bad! haha gottem

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): More like "It's Crap". Also why do the strings sound like something straight out of a Flash animation from 2001.

**bogo** (1): it's bad

**cremeebrulee** (1): ok is a bit generous

**thedoctordances1940** (0): this isn't ok. dreadfully dull in fact

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): “A music video was produced to promote the single. It featured All Saints sitting and lying down in an open top car while singing the song. There was also clips of a group of people walking down the street wearing matching outfits, various people being silly with the phone”-- idk one of the dudes in this vid looks like he’s having a mental breakdown in the phone booth lmao. Another number 1 for All Saints! And a co-write from group member Shaznay Lewis. This is a vibe, what can I tell ya.  Anyway, the song this samples from Buster Williams The Hump is a vibe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGsHKPJXC1k

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): now who let people sputter all over the track

#Bumbags

**MrSwearword** (10): OK I was not expecting this group to be the "we have needs and we will have them met" ensemble.

**plastichaxan** (10): camp 10 because of all the 0s it’s getting i don’t understand (i’d give this like an 8 idk)

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the percussion man slayed

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.9): trash (complimentary)

**Amazon4life** (9): Love the lyrics, the video, everything.

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the whole sound aesthetic of this song really works for me.

**amr** (8.8): this pink panther ass instrumental

**daretheghost** (8.5): Love how sleazy this sounds.

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): STOP CALLIN STOP CALLIN I DON'T WANNA TALK ANYMORE

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.4): pop is mathematics and when you hit your flow state sending emails shit can really work wonders.

**bbfan132** (8): this is catchy as hell

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjzpOVtb1Cc

**qazz23** (8): more good use of samples, all around good track

**starla\_** (8): the chorus is a let down but the verses on this are great

**stbrigidiscross** (8): I've heard this so many times but I still like it, they distribute lines a bit more evenly on this one and it really works. They cleverly use car doors and her own legs to hide Mel's pregnancy in the video. The harmonies on It's a boo-tay-ay it's a bootie call are really good.

**DirtyRat583** (7.7): 👄 bring it on, bring it bring it on 👄

**1998tweety** (7): sex bop

**BaconShoes** (7): bopping a bit

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): why’s someone snoring in the background

**nt96** (7): Vivica A. Fox approves

**Smuckles** (7): Wait, is that how you spell Booty?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): idk why them singing bootie call so smooth and seductive is so funny to me

**vivaforever597** (7): Shouldn't that be 'Booty'? Isn't 'bootie' the thing babies wear?

#This is ass

**welcome2thejam** (7): I can feel this dude's mouth noises at my ear, having good headphones is a negative with this song

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): I see what they were going for… but it didn't work

**Awkward\_King** (6): i have a sudden strong urge to watch the bring it on films

**Marvelous2002** (6): Cool and sexy??? Elsa wishes

**Stryxen** (6): the outro is responsible for like 4 of these points

**slimboyfriend** (5): I can appreciate the production and the vibes, but the vocals are too subdued and unremarkable for me and the way they just repeat ‘bootie call” at the end is too much

**celladonn** (4.5): that's not how you spell booty

**StarSquash45** (4.5): stream bootycall by yoa, the superior booty call song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): The beat to this…are they hooking up in a haunted house?

**Luxaria** (4): I'm sorry but that "uh" sample has killed any enjoyment I could have in this songs

**DaHumanTorch** (3.5): that buzzing was literally so jarring it made me physically recoil everytime it happened

**kappyko** (3): oh its booty alright....

**Melody** (3): these weren't really good but this is a new LOW.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): Did they really just throw in a sound effect of some guy snoring in the background??

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): BOOTIE (call is) SO BAD... LAWD, HAVE MERCY

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I’m bootie calling the police, how about that?

**fadedblue09** (1): This is murmuring, not singing

**CrimsonROSET** (0): she done already brought it on

**hoolytoledo** (0): this was a hole ass mess I’m sorry

**sarcasticsobs** (0): NO horny zone!!

**seanderlust** (0): that synth that sounds like a pitched-down disgruntled donald duck is absolutely atrocious

**TiltControls** (0): Wow they're making this easy putting two 0 contenders in a row. Really though - what is that grunting in the background?? And the mouth noises???

**stbrigidiscross** (5.5): I liked this more than I remembered but it suffers from the sameyness.

**akanewasright** (5): they tried to make this un-boring and it only kinda worked

**fadedblue09** (5): eh this is forgettable

**Marvelous2002** (5): Cheesy but kinda good

**starla\_** (5): boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): gets extra points because i’ll never not be a sucker for a final chorus key change

**RandomHypnotica** (4.8): go off westlife

**WaneY2UKtoc** (4.5): isn't this like a streets song? like I swear there's a cut on A Grand Don't Come Easy that is literally this but not complete ass. sorta vibe to the asinine adult contemporary bullshit that envelops me like a cocoon.

**hoolytoledo** (4): so this exists idk

**MrSwearword** (4): what the fuck are they talking about "aim high, shoot low" for besides the expectations vs reality of listening to their music?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Oh come off it with that Mellotron flute preset, you are not The Beatles.

**oscarbrierley1** (3): please let it be the last Goodbye so I never have to hear this song again.

**uberpigeon** (3): this is so flavorless its like eating a plate of water

**Awkward\_King** (0): im a little obsessed with how this song has no emotion in it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Oops sorry!!!!! So I am an All Saints enjoyer, but I do admit their vibey TLC-inspired take on R&B can run very one-note. Once I removed Lady Marmalade, I was scouring for All Saints to have any semblance of an uptempo and chose their 2006 flop album second single (as Rock Steady sounded more of the same). Maybe I’d score this lower by now, but I think a factor of what I like about it is Shaznay sounding vaguely like Santigold over this goofy Pharrell-biting production. And nothing in the main rate goes past 2013 so I did NOT want to include their stuff from Red Flag and Testament, sorry!

**flavasavavandal** (2): Pharrell? Also All Saints do not sound good over this

---

#Fitter, Happier, more productive

**plastichaxan** (10): i’ve never given a camp 10 this fast in my life

**StarSquash45** (10): this sounds like a Splatoon song (the highest praise i can give)

**WaneY2UKtoc** (9.1): sometimes we just need to get a whole gaggle of guys to play those drums.

**qazz23** (9): strong chorus, cute, catchy and fun

**bbfan132** (8.5): this will definitely get trashed but i liked it a lot! it’s super fun

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this is electroclash/IPR bonus rate core

**TiltControls** (8): The chorus carries this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this one has a different vibe from the rest of their songs…i like it

**vivaforever597** (7.5): Am I pressed about Studio 1 being represented here and not Red Flag? Maybe so.

**1998tweety** (7): ended chick fil a

#not from Slovakia

**oscarbrierley1** (7): I hate the intro, but I like the rest. Kinda sounds like a Pharrell beat, but British

**nt96** (6.5): it's ok but I don't see it going pass day 2

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I did kind of like this, but it’s not really what I wanted from All Saints years later

**Amazon4life** (6): It's just ok, imo one of the weakest songs on that album. The vocals are kinda grating.

**BaconShoes** (6): not crazy about it, but it’s not bad idk

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i think it’s malnutrition like eat something

**fadedblue09** (6): Some vocals are serving but borderline annoying

**Marvelous2002** (6): Had a comment but had to pause the song after the first chorus and I don't remember it.

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Swing and a miss for ol’ sarcasticsobs

**starla\_** (6): this is decent but not something I want to listen to every day

**welcome2thejam** (6): All Saints finally go uptempo, but at what cost?

**amr** (5.5): evil amerie 1 thing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I mean this is kinda annoying but also just a little bit of a slay.

**cancersgroove** (5): okay pseudo Neptunes production!

**daretheghost** (5): Annoying :(

**Smuckles** (5): Not everybody needs a reunion.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Rock Steady was the superior single from Studio 1 imo (we should've rated that instead but whatever)

**BeauMeringue212** (3): production is a mess

**stbrigidiscross** (3): I don't understand why this was released, it sounds like messing around in the studio not a song that should be a single. I've never listened to the album this is from and if this is actually one of the best songs on it I don't want to.

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): what happened to All Saints between 2000 and 2006 that made people think it would be a good idea for them to release this?

**throwaway-7650** (2): "I haven't eaten all week" what an instant turn-off omg

**indie\_fan\_** (1.5): The verses are what make me wanna throw a fit

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I listened to one of the albums they released after they reunited and any song from it would have been a more graceful note to end this section on, wtf is this?

**moonagenightmares** (1): dollar store pharrell prod

**MrSwearword** (1): oh my god, who let this group slip with quality control this hard, this is fucking horrible.

**akanewasright** (0): I’m a charli xcx stan why am I having issues with someone being annoying and yelling

**Melody** (0): ENOUGHHHHHHHHH

**flavasavavandal** (5): ok this one is actually just boring, Atomic Kitten do not have the power that The Bangles did

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): As a popheads oldhead I barely know this original song and the winsome charm of the Bangles one is a cute moment. This Atomic Kitten cover marked the beginning of the end with their post-Whole Again mellow reign of terror. But they got the formula down to win over the hearts of Brits as this was their second number 1 immediately after Whole Again!

---

#Say my name, say my name~

**hoolytoledo** (10): honestly a guilty pleasure, love both this cover and the original

**moonagenightmares** (9.3): i was surprised they had a song this good then realized this wasnt the original lmao

**luckyphase** (9): that pre 2000s fade out 🫡

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): outsold Pitch Perfect

**nt96** (8.5): not a bad cover!

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this is a great cover idc

**DirtyRat583** (8.1): this is one of their biggest singles so it will probably do well in the rate and i just dont get it :(

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Really like the song. Don’t like being reminded of Pitch Perfect.

**MrSwearword** (8): this is the least shit thing they made. Also, "eternal" and Atomic Kitten...pick one.

**StarSquash45** (8): very sweet and soft

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): the original is one of the best songs ever and like yeah this is a fine cover but it's hard for covers to live up to the original when the original is that immaculate

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended Katy Perry

**bbfan132** (7.5): i love how corny this is

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): no it’s gonorrhea

**CrimsonROSET** (7): bangles sweeties

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): I feel like the Bangles did this better… but idk. I only listen to the problematic Bangles songs

**Melody** (7): a cute cover

#Bangles? More like u BUNGLED this cover ha ha ha got em

**throwaway-7650** (7): icb I'm saying this... but all saints did it better

**oscarbrierley1** (6.7): in order to force up my score, I'm rating the slower version that's not on streaming (was on the original release of the album, but was booted off for the radio mix). The song is sweet and their vocals are good. I hate the version that's on streaming.

**celladonn** (6.5): early 2000s uk girl groups loved releasing covers as singles huh

**seanderlust** (6.5): am i tripping or is the first verse's vocal line very, verrry similar to underneath your clothes by shakira

**fadedblue09** (6): Could've been worse

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I listened to the original just to compare and honestly both are just kinda fine. Like yeah, this sure is old school radio pop.

**Smuckles** (6): Absolutely no-where near as good as the original but it gets a bonus point because the song itself carries them.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): that was certainly a bangles cover

**WaneY2UKtoc** (5.5): man I thought we as a society learned after Love Deluxe how to make adult contemporary. this one saunters n' vibes without really hitting the q-zone. again, it is just immaculate postmodern anonymity. this isn't a real song its just an amalgamation of elements. anyways someone made this and it slaps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-r89wRWo28

**BaconShoes** (5): kinda forgettable idk

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is meh but only because the original song is also meh

**Marvelous2002** (5): Oh I know this one! I like their vocals sometimes, still not great

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): This cover doesn’t really work, can’t believe it went #1 in the UK lol

**raggedy-princess** (5): not a great idea to go head-to-head with The Bangles

**robincav** (5): Boring

**starla\_** (5): I'm sorry but this has nothing on the Bangles

**Stryxen** (5): good but also bad

**Luxaria** (4): As a person whose mum played the Bangles version to me... this falls flat

**qazz23** (4): nowhere as good as the original

**stbrigidiscross** (4): I don't think this cover was necessary and it kept Bootylicious from being number 1 in the UK charts. Jenny Frost's voice is weirdly lethargic, it seems to suck all energy from the track.

**uberpigeon** (4): snuff that flame out

**akanewasright** (3): I assumed that this song was ripping off a Shakira song I like a lot, Underneath Your Clothes. However… not only is this a cover of an old song that Shakira was accused of ripping off, the cover was released a few years before Underneath Your Clothes… but I don’t care, Shakira did it better

**criestotheclicking** (3): I cannot say they did a good job here.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): Mediocre cover, it's whatever.

**TiltControls** (3): technically fine, but it's missing any sort of warmth to the lyrics

**welcome2thejam** (3): I looked at the title, realized what was about to happen, and just sighed

**Awkward\_King** (2): what the fuck

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): did yall hear something? not sure there was a song in this one

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): this is like a cover for a Disney movie but there is actually no movie so I can’t even camp like it in some form of context

**daretheghost** (0): How to take a great song and cover it, retaining none of the charisma or yearning that made the original great in the first place.

**ismayoaninstrument9** (0): heinous cover

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): This one has really really grown on me!!! This one hit number 3 on the UK charts. Another mellow Atomic Kitten cut, but something about it being a touch more uptempo and the melody is so pretty to me. The writers for this one also wrote for Spice Girls and Dido, so I can see where the sweet and sunny 2000s radio pop comes in here. Funny when Atomic Kitten were interviewed about their album Ladies Night, they proudly mentioned how this song proved that Atomic Kitten were “sticking to their sound” and not changing up like a lot of bands do. Based on these results, maybe they should have reconsidered his position!

---

#Come on over, come on over baby~

**Amazon4life** (10): Another song that takes me right back! Still love it just as much.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh I really love this chorus.

**indie\_fan\_** (10): this the kinda cheesy shit that I’m into

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This sounds like a classic girl group song

**stbrigidiscross** (9): this is a lot like the samey songs but I love it. They even manage to make Jenny's voice sound good. The chorus is a little clumsy but the harmonies and general vibe more than make up for it.

**Stryxen** (9): this is boring and repetitive but I love it

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): this is just eternal flame 2.0 but better

**BaconShoes** (8): I was jamming

**hoolytoledo** (8): a cozy, familiar, mid tempo, mid-2000s, cute lil pop bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): who were their hairdressers for this mv someone help these poor women’s bangs omg

#Stay at Home

**bbfan132** (6.5): kind of cute but also sounds like most of their other songs

**starla\_** (6.5): this sounds like I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (but not as good)

**TiltControls** (6.5): It's sweet, but I know they can go full on tooth-decay, cavity-giving sweet based on their other tracks

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i won’t

**seanderlust** (6): "maybe if you turn around and show me that it's real" atomic kitten said let me peg you or i'm walking

**StarSquash45** (6): kinda bland but still enjoyable

**vivaforever597** (6): Part of the problem with AK is Virgin trying to make Whole Again happen over and over and over again when their midtempos were almost always their least appealing songs.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Picket fence pop for Brit moms

**Marvelous2002** (5.7): Video had £2 budget, the song is fine

**fadedblue09** (5.5): cute but not a standout

**WaneY2UKtoc** (5.4): yup thats a slapper

**akanewasright** (5): This is the most whatever song ever… like it’s too upbeat to be boring compared to their other songs but it’s telling that I nearly forgot to score this

**Awkward\_King** (5): ive defended them so far but god EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME

**daretheghost** (5): Some might say “mid”

**Melody** (5): as flavourless as british food.

**MrSwearword** (5): if only because the attempts at choreo in the video are just...what they are and don't go with the beige song they're trying to sell.

**oscarbrierley1** (5): I had the cd of the album this song is on as a child so its vaguely familiar, but its not that interesting.

**qazz23** (5): another ballad :(

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): come on disbandment song…

**bogo** (2): go girls give us nothing

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2): I'm not feeling this one either sorry.

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): they are capable of making bops and they choose not to which makes it worse.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Time and time again, popheads show they are NOT ready for camp! I don’t care that this was the uptempo, cheesy and zany era of Atomic Kitten (where they were almost dropped from their label for flopping) and it’s kind of cringe. I am LIVING! There are so many funny, peculiar things happening in this song! The Big Country insane strings sample! The music video inspired by David Bowie’s Space Oddity?! Almost sampling Indieheads Ambient Rate Kings KLF’s “Justified and Ancient?!” That’s also serving Crossroads and Coyote Ugly realness? The punching choreography and Gen Z-shitpost sound effects bridge? The unsettling moaning (that at least isn’t as bad as Lil Kim - Custom Made). There’s a version of this that shows clips of flop-movie Titan A.E. but I can’t find proof it was even featured in that movie?? Honestly even tho this only got up to #10 on the singles charts, it’s dorky ass fun and I love it. Robbed! Please listen to this and reflect on your mistakes: https://youtu.be/bWebqCRw7o4?t=01

**flavasavavandal** (3): this is hyperpop

---

#BOOM!

**amr** (10): world if atomic kitten were internationally famous [futuristic city with flying cars and no pollution]

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): When I heard those strings start to fade in I KNEW a slay was incoming! I’m sorry but I’m such a sucker for this brand of cheesy millennium bubblegum disco, some of these vocals are hilariously bad but I can overlook that because I’m having fun. (boom!)

**stbrigidiscross** (10): This song knows what it wants to do from the first Boom and it wholly delivers.

**BaconShoes** (9.5): ooh this is hype

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): Bit of an out there reference, but this sounds like the producer was an ex-MOD composer for the Amiga. The dopey public-domain melodies, the fake 303, the pan-genre "i built this sample library all by myself!"-ness of it all. Right up my alley. Also, love how the breakdown in the video is basically a vernonator6497 edit of itself

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this sounds like such a cover of a disco song and i knew how much the UK loved those so i was shocked that this was not one of them

**nt96** (9): I thought they were saying oh shit at first lol

**Stryxen** (9): so much is happening this is so maximalist nu disco camp and other buzzwords but I love it

**throwaway-7650** (9): I love disco [2]

**plastichaxan** (8.8): this is kinda eurobeat coded i love that

**1998tweety** (8): me @ Park Jimin

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i’d bust my ass to this sure

**robincav** (8): That part of the melody sounds like Mario and Sonic dream ice skating

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): S Club 7 core

**welcome2thejam** (8): Who decided this song should sound like a sci-fi western lmao. It's a "we got the idea via improv group prompt" idea

**StarSquash45** (7.5): thought they were saying "oh shit"

**WaneY2UKtoc** (7.5): is this an advert for moving to Mars? sorta feel like SpaceX would totally launch a y2uk girl group to get me to go to Mars. Sound effect bridge breakdown is an idea. would've loved a KLF variant.

**seanderlust** (7.3): that is my absolute favorite dance break in a music video i've ever seen

**moonagenightmares** (7.2): sounds like they keep saying oh shit

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): im almost certain there exists a low quality verssion of this that you could get as a ringtone if you texted the number on a tv commercial

**fadedblue09** (7): The strings elevate this song

#this is so Coyote-Ugly :(

**TiltControls** (7): What's with this Diddy Kong Racing winter level production during the chorus

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): I hate the "want your lovin baby" part, it just sounds so grating to me. I love how much moaning there is in a song that was marketed towards children.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): am i allowed to call this camp

**bbfan132** (6): this sonic formula is kind of getting boring but i still find it a bit enjoyable? not sure how to feel

**criestotheclicking** (6): am genuinely in awe of whoever made this beat and decided on that sample

**hoolytoledo** (6): kinda a bop, kinda a mess. Oh the 90s.

**Melody** (6): thinking about it.. their music really sounds like weekday morning breakfast theme songs.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): I went in expecting a Chic cover and came back with one of the most pointless dance breaks ever to be included in a music video.

**Smuckles** (5): The song samples the theme to the 1958 film The Big Country,[2 Initial copies of the singles also contained a sample of the KLF's 1991 hit single "Justified & Ancient", but later copies had the sample removed.[citation needed]

**Marvelous2002** (4.2): Why dies this sound all over the place. I have not clicked with them at all yet

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): She was like the 6th best singer in The Saturdays

**flavasavavandal** (2): why do I feel like this is a B-tier Zara Larsson song

---

**Marvelous2002** (10): I know the score is high but I can't bring myself to give it any lower, I replayed it so many times when it was released,not even gonna classify it as a guilty pleasure. I keep waiting for music from her, but I'm not getting my hopes up now that presenting has worked for her. Frankie and Mollie deserved more in the group.

**BaconShoes** (7.5): I was humming a long; I dig it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): Selena Gomez ate her up a bit I fear

**criestotheclicking** (7): pretty good if not generic. I could see her having an Ella Henderson-ish career on (better) EDM songs.

**MrSwearword** (7): it could be better, but alas.

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): I like Hair Down more

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Love the future bass/heaven trap vibes of this one

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): A song.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5): yep, that's a 2016 pop track

**nt96** (5): yeah this is 2016 alright

**starla\_** (5): decent

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i mean for a debut single i guess its devent

**robincav** (4.5): Yeesh

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Seeing “2016” when I clicked on the single helped me understand what was happening here.

**Melody** (4): Mollie we still remember this solo bestie!

**Smuckles** (4): One of those songs you don't realise is playing until you wake up and realise that you're participating in an online rating project and have to think of a number to give it.

**TiltControls** (3.5): this song has nothing to it. I wish I had more to say than that but it kind of just goes in one ear and out the other

**flavasavavandal** (9): Darj asked me what Una song to pick and I really screwed her over by choosing the country one. Unlike with her time in The Saturdays I really love her voice here as she sings about always loving her child. Beautiful lovely country song that gets *checks note* day 1 :(

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This sounds like it belong on the soundtrack of one of those direct to video *Tinkerbell* films

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): I wasn't expecting to cry in this rate

**raggedy-princess** (10): probably the prettiest song here

**nt96** (9): oh this is SCRUMPTIOUS

**thegolding** (9): this sounds so peacuful and celtic. We need a main pop celtic girl tbh

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): pastoral queen

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Since when did her voice sound like that omg

**robincav** (8): This was lovely

**Marvelous2002** (7.5): I loved her in The Saturdays but she does this style so well, I wish it could've been incorporated slightly more in the group's music

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I don’t know enough about Eurovision to make a reference to it in a comment but I’m going to anyway.

**criestotheclicking** (7): I was surprised to hear her accent, didn’t know she was born in Ireland… pretty song.

**TiltControls** (7): After 3ish hours of club pop and chill ballads I was not expecting something like this

**cherryices** (6.8): i think we all know what’s going to happen here

**indie\_fan\_** (6.5): this was cute and unexpected, but nothing more

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): it's a good ballad with some folky production

**Amazon4life** (6): Not what I'd usually listen to, but lovely!

**bbfan132** (6): this sounds like it was recorded for a disney film or something, but it’s not bad

**MrSwearword** (6): this is basically "tell me you're an Irish woman in music without telling me"

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): Jarring transition into the bonus rate

**welcome2thejam** (6): Shame Gentleman wasn't the last song for the Saturdays, missed opportunity for an all-time sonic whiplash

**agentofscranton** (5): i always forget that ireland is like obsessed with country music

**celladonn** (5): I like how Irish she sounds here but the song is a little boring

**moonagenightmares** (5): yeehaw? wrong country?

**Smuckles** (5): Well, fair to say I was not expecting that. Puts me in the mood for a Guinness.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.4): a little bit boring, feels like that type of song the UK would submit to Eurovision once every 7 years and then get nil points

**Melody** (4): her voice is beautiful but the song is too slow to me:/

**RandomHypnotica** (4): oh... i thought i was safe from boring music here

**TCHALLA1966** (4): well

**bogo** (3): christian music (derogatory)

**starla\_** (3): sorry I do not like this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this is…very boring

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): it’s corny, the main chorus line is literally from primary school. But idk there’s something pure and beautiful to this. Maybe people will trash it like So Am I or other empowerment ballads in this vein. But there are stakes here, there is a sense that something was overcome, mostly bullying and even some implications of racism. It’s a cute track, I like it a lot

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I chose this cuz I just thought the chorus “If I’m ugly then so are you” is really funny

---

#you ain't go no alibi

**bogo** (10): this is so fucking funny lol

**vivaforever597** (10): This was my 11 in the Sugababes rate on Popjustice. When I was really struggling with body dysphoria (gender and otherwise), I used to write "If I'm ugly then so are you" on my side with a Sharpie.

**fadedblue09** (9): Love the sudden vulnerable moment, even if some lyrics are too on the nose

**MrSwearword** (9): this does challenge what should constitute a self-confidence anthem down boots, however, the melody is a bit simple. This is again me being a bitch for wanting things to hit right.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I appreciate the more nuanced approach that they took here, it’s hard to write an inspirational pop song that doesn’t get clowned on for being shallow.

**luckyphase** (8.5): i guess thats true

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this song isn’t for me but i’m sure whoever it is for holds it dear and that’s enough

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): 2ne1 could never

**stbrigidiscross** (8): I don't love this as much of their other songs

**nt96** (7.8): the way you can mash this with the Zoey 101 theme song https://rave.dj/EOf3PUjIkv5Y4g

**amr** (7.7): stupid emo gay

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): that chorus is so clunky lmao "nuh uh!!! You are!!!"

**apatel27** (7.5): Little Mix did it better sorry

**Marvelous2002** (7.5): Having said that,this is my fave lineup I think. Their songs the way their voices work together are my faves. Quintessential girl group message

**1998tweety** (7): Ugly Heart >>

**akanewasright** (7): This is TLC’s unpretty from shien but it’s cute

**BeauMeringue212** (7): it's a bit cliche in 2022 yes, but I'm rating this as a 2000s track lol

**robincav** (7): Video camp as all hell

**slimboyfriend** (7): so her trauma is that she’s short

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): I know you are but what am I <3

**TiltControls** (7): can we watch the ugly barnicle episode in full when this goes out

**bbfan132** (6.5): definitely their weakest song in this rate - it’s not bad, though

#NOT crazy, NOT sexy, NOT cool

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): Unpretty outsold

**plastichaxan** (6.5): why is this song so funny to me sdklkjdfs if i’m ugly then so are you

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I don’t feel like Sugababes is necessarily the best group to produce a “we live in a society” song but it’s nice enough.

**celladonn** (6): even though it's an undeniably positive message i can't help but roll my eyes a bit at songs like this

**daretheghost** (6): A bit middle-of-the-road.

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): do you ever feel like a misfit?

**Melody** (6): this song is good but aged BADLY since everything since for the girlies has been ugly x

**oscarbrierley1** (6): I'm too cynical for this kinda self empowerment song. This is such an obvious tlc unpretty part 2 attempt, they have the same writer/producer, but it doesn't have the same magic as unpretty.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): As a self-empowerment song, iIt's fine for what it is.

**Smuckles** (6): Fuck the haters!

**Stryxen** (6): You called me a bitch? Well a bitch is a dog, bark is on trees and trees are apart of nature and nature is beautiful so thank you for calling me beautiful

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i get the point this song is trying to make but for some reason hearing the sugababes call you ugly is making me giggle

**welcome2thejam** (6): This is probably the ceiling for this kind of empowerment anthem

**cremeebrulee** (5.6): if this was delivered better it would've been a camp 10

**BaconShoes** (5): inspiring ballad vibe, but it is not inspiring me

**Luxaria** (5): The lyrics needed another round or two in the workshop

**seanderlust** (5): the genius.com description comparing this to MLK's I Have A Dream speech...I'm hollering

**starla\_** (5): this is like a bad rip-off of 'Unpretty' by TLC

**uberpigeon** (5): hot girls we have problems too, we're just like you, except we're hot

**WaneY2UKtoc** (4.2): funny as fuck video but god DAMN what a clusterfuck. lost my shit when it cut to the shot of the 3 non og sugababges clapping

**Amazon4life** (4): Should've picked Easy instead

**criestotheclicking** (4): as a fellow short queen I understand Keisha. Seriously though this is corny. peak 2000s inspo-pop.

**hoolytoledo** (4): this sounds like an infomercial

**throwaway-7650** (4): I'm sorry but I can't take this song seriously like... at all

**StarSquash45** (3): the lyrics to this song sound like they were ripped straight from an instagram influencer's captions i hate to say it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): The only group here where I did not include their debut song! Woops! I’ve grown to like “If This is Love” more, and I like this one more as well too. I’ve become obsessed with Una’s singing voice, who was always criminally underutilized in The Saturdays. Her raspy singing during the bridge always gets hyped. I think this is a sweet number, but not sweet enough to escape the Bottom 10. Also lol at having to change the lyrics because radio refused to play the song over the stabbing lyric 😭

---

#cuz I got issues but u got em 2

**MrSwearword** (10): FINALLY a good song called "Issues" with a good "my head and my heart" hook.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): so much better than that shit julia michaels song

**throwaway-7650** (10): julia michaels wishes she ever penned a lyric anywhere near as profound as "can't decide if I want to stab you or kiss you"

**TiltControls** (8): Straightforward, but well done. Much better handling than Julia Michaels

**1998tweety** (8): ended Julia

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): I hate that reading the word issues puts the julia michaels song in my head

**CrimsonROSET** (6): not the julia michaels

**MassiveThief** (11): this makes me so instantly happy

**hoolytoledo** (10): me and my heart we got his shoes (his shoes)

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): They don’t make them like this anymore… this song is such a time capsule of the sonic trends of this era of music in the best way possible. I don’t think I’ve ever heard this before but it’s making me nostalgic.

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): I was a Vanessa bias back then. That lady can SING!!

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): this song is so cute to me

**StarSquash45** (8.5): why does the bridge sound like Night Crawling by Miley Cyrus

**daretheghost** (8): I really love the chorus!

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is the most generic song ever lyrically but the melody showed up

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Ava Max outsold with My Head & My Hear11 but they tried and it’s cute.

**Melody** (7): babe if you got issues go to the therapist babe x

**qazz23** (7): decently catchy but kinda generic

**slimboyfriend** (7): I thought this was “Jack and Diane” by John Mellencamp when the guitar started

**seanderlust** (6.5): this really sounds like a late PCD B-cut. it's fine but that's all i feel about it

**bbfan132** (6): i kind of like parts of it but the final product sounds run-of-the-mill

**WaneY2UKtoc** (5.4): sonic terrorism

**Amazon4life** (5): The song would be ok if the lyrics weren't high-school level songwriting.

**BaconShoes** (5): kind of a snooze idk

**starla\_** (5): I got issues and you got them too

**vivaforever597** (5): I don't get why this was a single. Surely if they wanted a downtempo they should have gone with Keep Her.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.5): Me and this song, we’ve got issues (that means I’m not feeling this one)

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): this sure is a song

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): Lauren Jaelualigue or whatever her name is outsold this. "I'm tired of the melody" no like same

**welcome2thejam** (3): Bit too pristine honestly, solid voices but this is basic and safe to the point of boredom

**cremeebrulee** (2.6): omg what's happening spoken bridge print

**Awkward\_King** (2): girl this song has issues

#🤧

**criestotheclicking** (6): when my brother and I were younger we used to substitute issues with tissues and think it was comedy gold. I don’t even know what the punchline is there

**kaanew** (5): I was on the edge of my seat the whole song to see if they’d rhyme issues with tissues (they didn’t)

**uberpigeon** (5): i forgot about this song but in primary school we used to sing it but replace words so that it was about having a snotty nose and needing tissues, tissues, tissues

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I did my scores a month ago, and now that I’ve lived with some songs more, I’m puzzled over why this and Bootie Call are the same score for me. I think I’ve grown to like this one more, with a chorus with more pizzazz and the sultry yet dumb “I knowww you wanntt a piece of my azzz”. Another song with “????” moaning I fear, when will these British ladies give us peace. The moaning sample (lol) is from a pretty neat song tho, The Fatback Band - Put Your Love in My Tender Care.

**Amazon4life** (10): Why is this fool all up in my ass, doesn't he know I want class, not trash?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I was gonna give this a 9 but the phrase “up in my ass” just…makes me smile. 10 points for bringing me joy.

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): sometimes you just need the right sample and you can sorta lazily slam dunk this shit like you're steven segal just lazily taking down bros at a russian wrestling thing (https://youtu.be/1-ynfOMi0Jo?t=132). seriously, this track is cut in line with the neneh cherry/blue lines notion of pop mash-up; very vague spliff tempo energy coming through just brilliant hook-laden choruses. truly, we all be hooked up!

**StarSquash45** (9.5): the dialling tones in the first verse are brilliant lmao

**Awkward\_King** (9): i think all saints sound the most american of all the groups here

**kappyko** (9): duhhhhhhhh

**TiltControls** (9): Given how often All Saints does this style of chill pop I don't know what makes one song better than the other, but this is definitely on the amazing side of them

**BaconShoes** (8.5): help what is this

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I'm glad their later songs are finally letting their vocals shine

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): According to Wikipedia when this came out it was kinda dragged for being, like, cod hip-hop, which is fair I guess but I still think it sounds pretty underneath the mild cringe.

**celladonn** (8): why's this fool all up in my ass

**MassiveThief** (8): there's something very very clunky about "i know you want a piece of my ass" but song still bangs

**qazz23** (8): ass ass ass

**slimboyfriend** (8): Is this mid hookup? Or… why is he currently in her ass?

**Smuckles** (8): Blunt! You might take this for granted in an age of WAP's but I'm blushing at their liberal use of the word “ass”. My goodness!

**Marvelous2002** (5.5): The chorus feels so slow, huge shame cause the rest is so enjoyable, including the lyrics

**starla\_** (5.5): this has a lot going on, maybe a little too much

**BeauMeringue212** (5): the chorus is wild lmao

**criestotheclicking** (5): not a fan of the excessive moaning on the beat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): uhhhh…the moaning is making me extremely uncomfortable in this

**seanderlust** (4.5): this is too soon after the nu-metal rate for a song with "say what, say what" in the intro...i'm still traumatized from all in the family

**CrimsonROSET** (4): give it to me i’m worth it

**Melody** (4): flop Saints.

**plastichaxan** (4): how can they make the phrase “I know that you want a piece of my ass” sound so boring come on dfsjlsdfk

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is like the reverse no scrubs

**MrSwearword** (1): "why is this foo' all up in my ass" is basically the problem with All Saints. Quite frankly, how are you gonna have any member, let alone a white one sing this shit?

**moonagenightmares** (0): straight men should be banned from producing

**throwaway-7650** (0): they did try but this song is the opposite of sexy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): screw the haters, this song is a post-good SMASHA!!!! For the millionth time, I will DIE on the hill that this song was begging for a PSY feature, which would be era-appropriate and campy fun. This song is so gaudy and tacky early 2010s EDM I’m literally obsessed with it, it was a last-minute add and died a sad death here in the Y2UK rate, but I’m glad some girlies got it. You either get the vibe or you don’t!!!

**flavasavavandal** (3): The Saturdays were aware they could never pull this off right, or did they go into this with the same confidence that Jesy went in with Boyz

#Big Boss aka post-good appreciators

**apatel27** (10): ngl the reason I like this so much is how breathtaking Frankie looks in the MV

**hoolytoledo** (10): iconic

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): bad bitches don’t exist in the UK, but if they did, this would be their anthem

**qazz23** (10): catchy beats and synths!

**TCHALLA1966** (10): they are gangsta on the dance floor what more needs to be said

**thedoublebanana** (10): Justice for this song, because it's such a bop.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): i-i-i love this track

**Melody** (9): topshop called they want their suits back x

**cherryices** (8.7): kim woodburn voice if you want trouble, by CHRIST you’re gonna get it in spade loads.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): will.i.am.ney core (complimentary)

**Marvelous2002** (8): How did they manage to have so many bops. Might need to listen to their albums

**uberpigeon** (8): good girls die young bad girls do it well

**welcome2thejam** (8): hey i'm girlbossin over here

**agentofscranton** (7.5): give a pulitzer to whoever wrote my resume says i'm a bad girl

**daretheghost** (7.5): A banger but not particularly noteworthy.

**BaconShoes** (7): ok this one is fun at least

**CrimsonROSET** (7): sophie ellis baxtor watch out

#outlaws aka plebs who needs their music to "sound good" 🙄

**BeauMeringue212** (6.5): your millennial accountant aunt's get turnt anthem

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): if love island existed in 2012 this would be the theme song. Idk which one of them says outlaur, but its iconic.

**akanewasright** (6): they really went from the most boring ballads ever to bimbofied will.i.am ass music

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Descending beat is for “for me”. Ignoring lyrics. OH, wait, no, what are they doing with the vocal effects near the end?

**seanderlust** (6): ok but "i'm a gangster on the dancefloor" is one of the most white girl lines of all time...i truly hate it so much

**slimboyfriend** (6): It’s so refreshing how unapologetically trashy 2012 edm this song is

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i doubt that tbh

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Not fully vibing with the production here, but I'm a bit intrigued (that is, until the hideous outro showed up)

**starla\_** (4.5): everybody knows my name here, I'm the head of game here

**throwaway-7650** (4.4): I don't think this concept suits them very well.

**WaneY2UKtoc** (4.2): again, exactly what is the purpose of this absolute anti-atmospheric, pro-hedonist, very cis and straight vibe?

**criestotheclicking** (4): “gangster on the dancefloor” is killing me. Loving Molly’s belt though.

**Luxaria** (4): This is so of it's time it hurtsss

**TiltControls** (4): this sounds like a lady gaga reject, and not in a good way

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): White Women Won’t Believe This One Easy Life Hack: >!Don’t call yourself gangster!<

**bbfan132** (3): sorry but no lol

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): Yeah this is pretty terrible imo

**RandomHypnotica** (3): not a single one of these girls have gangster energy

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): this is notoriously awful

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): hmmm

**Amazon4life** (1): I l-l-love this track - said no one ever.

**MrSwearword** (1): I have never been so repulsed at opening words like "I'm an outlaw, I'm the big boss, I'm a gangster."

**Smuckles** (0): Mildly embarrassing, if anything. Another song I associate with uni but not with any sort of feeling of nostalgia or warmth. Obnoxious sound, bad lyrics and they completely forgot to add any sort of hook. My kingdom for a chorus. I yearn for those pure shores once again!

**flavasavavandal** (8): praying to s-club 7 to not let longsongphobia hit this too hard (edit after being asked to help out) oh no I’m so sorry Never Ever

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): The most successful song in our entire rate and it won’t even be seeing Day 2! ~~I keep saying my scores would change now but I am too lazy to fix them it’s like two days before reveal, anyway I would probably increase this by three points~~ I can see why it’s not a popheads favorite. I know the 90s were a time of R&B spoken intros and bridges, but this one feels odd to the ears if you didn’t grow up with it. The rest of the tune is very sweet though, but maybe too low energy for most popheads’ taste. Still, this Amazing Grace-inspired song is THE THIRD most successful girl group song EVER in the UK, staying in the top 10 for 15 weeks and getting crossover success throughout Europe, Australia and even the US. Keeping vibing, queens!

---

#Ever ❤️
**amr** (10): all their music, and this song in particular, is so falling-on-the-sidewalk-and-scraping-Ur-knees-core

**daretheghost** (10): My sister and I kept a LOT of VHS tapes on which we tried to record every single US TV appearance of the Spice Girls along with all their music videos. We were like little Spice Girls historians-we had stuff on those tapes that doesn’t exist on YouTube. I think we lost them all in various moves but the point of this is that I distinctly remember this music video making an appearance on one of the tapes because MTV played it before or after a Spice Girls video in some countdown. This song also taught me that some countries refer to the letter Z as “zed” so thank you All Saints for that bit of cosmopolitan knowledge.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): thank you for teaching us the alphabet so that Taylor could teach us to spell

**Stryxen** (10): the winner in a just subreddit where gorgeous songs win rates

**TCHALLA1966** (10): ugh that beginning I know it word for word just so iconic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): this is such a classic but i feel like it'll be robbed

**thedoublebanana** (10): One of the most iconic intros ever. The intro alone makes me want to give this my 11.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): A chill slay.

**nt96** (9): a platinum grade track that Popheads will certify polyethylene.

**qazz23** (9): beautiful harmonizing, this really goes from A to Zed!

**Smuckles** (9): The 2000's version of Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is?

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): beautiful harmonies but the intro is too long

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Feel like this is gonna get tanked for being too long but it’s such a vibe

**starla\_** (8.5): the spoken word intro is such a lip sync for your life moment

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.4): warm blanket white girl soul!

**BaconShoes** (8): i think i much prefer the Booker T Vocal Mix of this as that is more up my alley, but it’s pretty good and their vocals sound great

**bogo** (8): it's giving spongebob ripped pants

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): this directly inspired Marina

**Luxaria** (8): Intro goes on longer than I remember but a classic nonetheless

**MrSwearword** (8): I applaud the nerve and ambition to feature nearly a minute of a vocal range best described as "A to bold move on your part" introducing the song. Once the vocals kicked in, miss Shaznay delivered yet again.

**plastichaxan** (7.8): i thought a Shangri-La’s had made its way into my spotify queue for some reason at first

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i will be longsongphobic im not sorry

**moooo566** (7): i love spoken word bits in songs

**mysario** (7): this was on the first version of the US Now That's What I Call Music truly iconic

**oscarbrierley1** (7): looooong and repetitive. The first 4 minutes is good.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): it’s a snooze but a cute snooze

**bbfan132** (6.5): the intro reminds me of the shangri-la’s, and if it was inspired by them, i like the callback

#Never 💔

**stbrigidiscross** (6.5): I know its their biggest hit and its huge impact but I've heard it so much I can barely stand it. I think Shaznay is amazing but some of the lyrics are a bit silly. It's an automatic skip on Spotify

**TiltControls** (6.5): It's chill, but compared to Pure Shores which has the similar energy it misses the mark somewhere along the way

**1998tweety** (6): not the spoken intro...

**agentofscranton** (6): it's fine but like why is it a century long

**sarcasticsobs** (6): They said “zed”! Despite that and being the resident defender of long songs, I couldn’t get into it! Sad “yahoo”!

**welcome2thejam** (6): I see the streaming version is a minute & a half longer than the "US version" on youtube I used, and I can't help but feel that I dodged a bullet here. The intro probably made me rougher than I usually would though

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): this is the worst game of never have I ever… ever

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Too slow and too LONG! Pick just one!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): taking a point off for the intro

**Melody** (5): 🛏

**DaHumanTorch** (4.5): inb4 the "this song never ever would end" comments

**Marvelous2002** (4.5): That spoken verse is camp and I don't mean it as good. Gorgeous harmonies though. wait why are there 100s of them now? what did I miss lol

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.5): The spoken word intro is actually kinda iconic, the rest of the song is okay

**akanewasright** (4): I’m sorry, this intro is just so awful I can’t think about anything else during the song, an impressive feat considering how long it is! I’m pretty sure this song is boring anyway

**CrimsonROSET** (4): you did not earn 6 minutes of song

**static\_int\_husp** (4): This is too long I'm sorry

**celladonn** (3.5): pretty boring and why is this intro so long

**seanderlust** (3.5): this was on one of my favorite now that's what I call music CDs and it would get to this song and I'd hear "a few questions that I need to kn-" and hit skip, so cool to actually finally hear it in full! it is not good.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): longsongphobia strikes...

**hoolytoledo** (3): this song just never clicked with me 🤷‍♂️

**fadedblue09** (2): the definition of meandering

**kappyko** (2): i feel like ph's ranking of this will be terrifying to people more familiar with this song but this is ass

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): I've done my fair of complaining that songs are too short nowadays but christ they need to just snip off that whole opening monologue and come up with something better than that lame chorus

**uberpigeon** (2): why is this over 6 minutes long

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): this is long AND slow like sorry if you bop but i can’t

**throwaway-7650** (1): a knockoff TLC song that goes on for far too long

**DirtyRat583** (0): proud to be a fierce balladphobe

**ImADudeDuh** (0): its giving 10th grade talent show

**flavasavavandal** (8): omg Sean Paul, we love you, unfortunately no one else does and you’re getting robbed in day 1 when you deserve day 2

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): This song shrinks on me more and more. And it’s the Saturday’s ONLY #1, and it’s evident from the producers to the music video that this was their “hustling for a US crossover moment” (that tied into their E! Reality TV series about breaking into the states, lol) Really, I think a lot of it is a cute little reggae-tinged bop, but LORD those stale as fuck “na na nas” that are soooo flat. And sorry I am Jamaican and I am allowed to say this, but I’m kind of ambivalent about Sean Paul here on such an EDM-heavy track (also not huge on his feature in Hair). I’m and oldhead who loves his Dutty Rock era, what can I say! I don’t have much nostalgia for his EDM features era. Now stream “Get Busy”!

---
#https://youtu.be/FRNHfR24u64

**DirtyRat583** (10): somehow simultaneously boring and euphoric. how do they do it

**Marvelous2002** (10): Finally a song I remember the release of!!! this is how I found out about them, all those years ago. I loved this song at the time, didn't age amazingly but still a huge bop, and I can't disappoint young me. also not Sean Paul ☠️. The 10 is for the version without him

**TCHALLA1966** (10): Sean did what he had to do and in the end they served excellence

**thedoublebanana** (10): SEAN DE PAUL!

**cremeebrulee** (9): WHY AM I JUST LEARNING SEAN PAUL IS IN THIS RATE

**Luxaria** (9): I hate to admit how much I enjoy this song, Vanessa (?) truly carried

**mysario** (9): Sean Paul makes every song better

**robincav** (9): NA NA NA NA NA

**StarSquash45** (9): the girls really said balegdeh here

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended P!nk

**TiltControls** (8.5): I have object permanence issues with Sean Paul on this song until he pops another line in then I remember he's here. I think if he just had his verse and that's it, it'd be much better (since he does great on that part!)

**seanderlust** (8): welcome back to america's favorite game show "is this song actually good or are we just happy to see the featured artist?"

**plastichaxan** (7.5): one of them sounds a lot like xtina in forever is over and here

# They got the wrong temperature fi shelter your from the storm :(

**criestotheclicking** (7): their caribbean inflection in the introduction is painful but so funny looool

**welcome2thejam** (7): Fun first listen, liked the bridge, but shrinker potential is definitely evident

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): Too many of the Saturdays' songs sound like if America was a Eurovision contestant

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): (Tiffany Pollard voice): SEAN PAUL???

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I think this was on Target’s in-store playlist when I worked there and I just assumed it was from one random American woman

**Melody** (6): it's a fun song.. but it feels very dated now. I don't understand how this got them their 1st and only number 1 in the UK. Also the way they abandoned the US after dropping this making me kiiiii.

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): Generic but bop

**RandomHypnotica** (6): what about you?

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): i can never hate a Sean Paul feature

**throwaway-7650** (6): ...and I'm back to being a misandrist #yass

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Yet another dated sounding EDM track, but I must admit the chorus goes off

**BaconShoes** (5): Yeah idk the production in these Saturdays songs is kind of generic and the choruses are not hitting

**bbfan132** (5): this is a song

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i’m also tired of the saturdays

**daretheghost** (5): The Saturdays :handshake: Unnecessary features

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Was Pitbull not available?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): If there was any group that could perfectly encapsulate the sound of generic early-2010s dance-pop, it's this group. Song's fine.

**akanewasright** (4): how do you fuck up a song with a Sean Paul feature? This shouldn’t be possible, I’m honestly impressed

**apatel27** (4): This is an American song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I normally enjoy Sean Paul but…this is just very boring.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): any c-list pop girl collabing with a no name dj couldve made this

**Smuckles** (3): This feels VERY much of it's time.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): sean paul is adding about as much to this as i do to the popheads community

**BeauMeringue212** (2): Island gyals... but the island is Great Britain

**Roxieloxie** (2): how do you mess up a sean paul feature

**MrSwearword** (1): you mean to tell me the first chart topper for this group was their "third rate straight people club music that inexplicably gets played at gay clubs, ruining the mood"? Tragic.

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): noisy EDM pop songs are pophead’s equavilent to buttrock

**starla\_** (0): ah yes the Sean Paul comeback era

**WaneY2UKtoc** (0): they are literally in fucking LA. darj they're not even wearing designer flair jeans or like those y2k pants. this is just a terrorist class early 2010s anthemic pop shitter. irrational hate 0 bestowed to the saturdays (which dont look good to me!) for leaving their roots behind to the evil of LA. LA popheads will tell you "noooo LA is so good" and lowkey LA is fire, but you NEVA move there and glorify it unless you spent your childhood in the SFV like the Haim girlies and PTA. and lemme tell you, the satudays def didn't.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This song took MANY listens for it to grow on me. I think I got into my Atomic Kitten song curation really sporadically and this felt like more midtempo mush I couldn’t remember. But, reading up on them and how Whole Again was the single that saved them from being dropped and stayed #1 on the charts for 4 weeks, I do think their first big hit is really the best example of their eventual “signature sound”. Very sweet and delicate vocals, and ngl their take on “white girl R&B and lite gospel” is lowkey funny but I can’t help but smile when that final chorus with background vocals kicks in. Having been a pre-teen myself during this era, I get the sugary-sweet vibe! Sadly this song would also be the harbinger of Atomic Kitten doing the.same.song.over.and.over.again. Pain. But yes, the 9th most successful girl group song on the UK charts is out Day 1!

**flavasavavandal** (10): yeah this is pure nostalgia, a very simple little ballad that somehow just hits a very middle-of-the-road sweetspot, i love how playful and welcoming it is.

---

#[IT'S COMING HOME!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM)

**Amazon4life** (10): Very anthemic, gotta love it.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): this is gonna get paid dust b/c it's a ballad but it's a really, really well-constructed one. Why did "Never Had A Dream Come True" cross over and not this?

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): This needs to go top 5 I’m so serious like this is THE OliviaGodrigo shower anthem

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this is what Never Ever wanted to be

**TCHALLA1966** (10): this is the most British a song could get tbh y’all won’t get it

**thegolding** (10): I could give this song an 11 and it would be so deserving. Heartbreaking ballad and stunning vocals

**throwaway-7650** (10): 11 contender wow... I wasn't expecting this

**TiltControls** (10): this is so cute omg

**celladonn** (9): i wish there was more going on in the instrumental but that chorus is so good

**fadedblue09** (9): this is cute

**Luxaria** (9): It's a classic for a reason

**Melody** (9): a optimistic banger

**dream\_fighter2018** (8.5): don’t rely on a dude to fix you!!! Please go to therapy xx

**starla\_** (8.5): I heard this in the supermarket the other day

**bbfan132** (8): this was cute! it’s super cheesy but in an endearing way

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): If I’d heard this in 2017 when I was a gay teen going through his first breakup… it would have been GAME OVER.

**hoolytoledo** (8): while I’m not the biggest fan of this song, I’m giving it a generous score for nostalgic purposes

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**Awkward\_King** (7): this is mediocre but i fear i liked it nonetheless

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is so sweet I got a cavity.

#[England 0-4 Hungary, 2022](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/12633076/england-0-4-hungary-biggest-home-defeat-since-1928-as-gareth-southgates-side-are-humiliated-in-the-nations-league)

**stbrigidiscross** (7): I know it's the massive hit that saved the band but I've heard it too much to like it that much. Liz and Natasha sound really lovely on it.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): I could but I'm gonna give you a decimal point anyway

**BaconShoes** (6): not really my vibe

**ImADudeDuh** (6): you make me a hole again

**Stryxen** (6): production is so tinny its like a little metal time capsule

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): theres a version of this song where Kerry katona speaks all the verses. Something about that is iconic to me. Other than that the song is meh.

**akanewasright** (5): this song is fine but my lord is it a signal of bad things to come

**apatel27** (5): You know this was a karaoke hit for the 5pm pub regulars

**criestotheclicking** (5): several deep side-partings on show here

**CrimsonROSET** (5): zzz

**qazz23** (5): uh oh, it's a ballad

**seanderlust** (5): walks through the comments and sprays everyone who makes a "whole/hole" joke with a spray bottle

**Smuckles** (5): Trying to capture the feel of warmth and comfort that All Saints - Pure Shore brings but falling just short.

**StarSquash45** (5): not to be a puritan but i don't like it when nice cute love songs talk about being turned on

**vivaforever597** (5): The Atomic Kitten version of this is literally the worst one (cf. Play, No Secrets, OMD). It's really a pity that it was such a smash that Virgin literally was obsessed with recreating it with every original AK single, leading to both Andy McCluskey's forced departure and the destruction of the original energetic, singing-and-dancing, Steps-on-amphetamines format of the group, which was so much more interesting.

**Marvelous2002** (4): They rival 90s boy band acting. Wait is that Heidi? when did she get here??? the members have all blended into one tbh

**MrSwearword** (4): I'd rather bury this boring dreck in a hole, again.

**daretheghost** (3): Opening messages on Grindr be like

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): girl group ballads will never fail to bore more i apologize

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): that one verse that’s almost spoken word, i died

**WaneY2UKtoc** (3): this is postmodern anonymity in sonic form. this plays as the local tesco; the california pizza kitchen wine bar at the mall during halftime of sunday football; an auto-zone on the outskirts of town where neer-do-wheels do wheelies outside. this is a liminal space of a song (and it sucks).

**moonagenightmares** (1): balladphobia shall prevail

**Roxieloxie** (1): oh shes going for that whitewashed RnB vibe and shes not hitting the mark

**PrimaryCrusaders** (0): I was never into British football. Also it's just not a good song at all.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): It is simply the greatest song of all time [also side note but this was written by Priscilla Renea aka Muni Long?!?! I’ve known about her for years, the person who wrote “Timber” also writing this makes a lot more sense now lol] This is the one score I changed while typing out my comments week of reveal (and didn't affect its placement) because I NEEDED the history books to KNOW WHERE I STAND ❗️

**flavasavavandal** (1): How the fuck is this song not last, truly a horrendous piece of content that got too many camp 10s and even 2 camp 11s. But this song is just such a confusing mess, is it pro-feminist? Anti-feminist? Do i really care? Either way that bridge made me cry hard, it was that bad.

---

#Name a more iconic duo, I'll wait

**bogo** (11): the way this is both super hilarious and genuinely great

**throwaway-7650** (11): this is now my most camp 11 ever, IPR #OUT

#*fedora tipping intensifies*

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My ass is UP for this campery!

**cremeebrulee** (10): leave kanye out of this

**criestotheclicking** (10): Musically I like the song, but it’s not for The Saturdays! Someone else could make this song and actually make it work. Kanye got done dirty in that bridge and what a bridge that was. Robert Pattinson, Drake, Larry King, (RIP) Weezy????? 10 because it’s incomprehensibly camp.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the real housewives of the girls on tv

**fadedblue09** (10): Funny how their most dated song lyricially sounds the freshest sonically

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is atrocious but also it’s brought me so much joy that I can’t help but give it a good score. [“Boss X Gentleman” is iconic, deal with it.](https://rave.dj/81bQGR6-bIpQMg)

**mysario** (10): this song was ahead of its time

**plastichaxan** (10): lmao this was such a jumpscare when i first heard it ofc it’s a 10 for me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is the funniest song I've ever heard

**Stryxen** (10): I'm really into bad music right now

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): this one is actually genius. sorta like the "puddle of mudd - blurry" of y2uk. but its also feminist? love feminism love poker. (i do not) love evil producers.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.9): camp classic! the 90s fixation is hilarious from the least Y2K-core group in the rate

**Marvelous2002** (9): This is in the Girls Aloud direction and they do it so well. Rochelle ate this song up. Also the video is great. They deserved more

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): This is the definition of camp

**StarSquash45** (9): these lyrics are amazing lmao

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this is amazing idc what the haters have to say. that horrible rap verse at the end just adds to the song’s charm

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): Its so hard to choose if you want a Obama or a Jonas Brother

**welcome2thejam** (9): M'Saturdays

**DirtyRat583** (8.8): one of the girls sounds like iggy azalea in this

**agentofscranton** (8.5): Rochelle woke up and decided she wanted to be American that day

**moonagenightmares** (8.3): the namedropping sent me

**akanewasright** (8): This song is horrible and I hope others tank it, but I can’t stop laughing

**celladonn** (8): I don't really think of the 90s as a particulary gentlemanly era but this is fun and camp

**DaHumanTorch** (8): they're so real i too need a jonas brother

**ImADudeDuh** (8): [Rate] all the men mentioned in the bridg- I have been informed that Obama is in that list and the rate thread has been locked in advance

**nt96** (8): those are some specific years but spill

**sarcasticsobs** (8): oh hell ya

**thegolding** (8): they saying they want a Kanye feels a little weird but sure girls go find himm

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.8): slam poetry is so 1995

**amr** (7.7): "I need to find my obama" me when me when me when. imperialist

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended Psy

**Amazon4life** (7): Wow they actually have a listenable song? Very Pussycat Dolls.

**Awkward\_King** (7): a camp 7 for the absolutely insane lineup of men they list

**qazz23** (7): that rap is so silly

#misandrists

**BaconShoes** (6): the chorus is fun but these lyrics are so…

**oscarbrierley1** (6): laughing at how many of the men they call gentlemen are now problematic. Taste my rainbow as a euphemism is really awkward because I just think of the skittles adverts where everything the guy touches turns to skittles.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): I was hoping there'd be a proper chorus instead of just that rap verse being the main hook but eh, it's fine i guess

**Roxieloxie** (5.5): i have no idea how to feel about this

**MrSwearword** (5): watch this be the first out because of the first verse and a certain klaxon ringing off...think Stupid Girls and you get it...but honestly for all its doo-wop charm, the lyrics are clunky as fuck. However, the video with the poker scene is a serve.

**troubled-paradise69** (5): fun beat, weird lyrics

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): honestly i was expecting something more camp, this is just not that good

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): These songs are so much worse when the lyrics are actually trying to say something

**bbfan132** (4): not into this

**robincav** (4): Kind of awful but that bridge changed my life so giving it some credit for that power

**Smuckles** (4): One of the more baffling songs I've listened to recently, where did this idea that chivalry was a 90's thing come from? Who the fuck told them that!?

**starla\_** (4): I'll let you taste my rainbow

**daretheghost** (3): I…

**Melody** (3): this whole era.. the song, the music videos, THE PERFORMANCES??? the cheesy ass music, the terrible desperate housewives serving Geordie Shore-esque outfits and the lyrics.. its just terrible and insufferable, having grown ass women singing these teen talent show songs BE FR.

**seanderlust** (1.4): score inspired by the saturdays shooting 14 shots at the same time during the rap

**indie\_fan\_** (1): the verses are the only thing I can find somewhat tolerable

**TiltControls** (1): I tried writing a comment to understand this song but it got too long so let me just say this song confuses and frightens me

**apatel27** (0): 3 of the girls were married when this song was released. Marvin and Wayne don't deserve this slander

**BeauMeringue212** (0): a man definitely wrote this

**cherryices** (0): LARRY KING?

**Luxaria** (0): Why are they rapping? What are these lyrics?!? I did not expect to hand a zero, WHY ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT THESE OLD MEN???

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): it's like they invented phcj but straight and older

#Lizzie McGuire - What Dreams Are Made Of

**Luxaria** (11): I DO NOT CARE IF NOSTALGIA HAS ME HERE I was obsessed with this song, I love it, I love the final chorus, I love the fade out, I cannot help but support it with my eleven.

**agentofscranton** (10): lizzie mcguire you'll always be famous

**Amazon4life** (10): I was obsessed with this song and vid back in the day. (Yes I'm old)

**amr** (10): a camp or genuine 10? U'll never know :shrug:

**Awkward\_King** (10): the tide is high and i wish i was too

**DirtyRat583** (10): i have cried to this song before

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): Drowned Debbie Harry

**hoolytoledo** (10): kitties know how to do a good cover

**ismayoaninstrument9** (10): immaculate cover

**luckyphase** (10): this is one of the first songs I remember ever liking so it's nostalgic to me. Thanks Disney Channel!

**StarSquash45** (10): the bridge >>>

**TCHALLA1966** (10): was obsessed with this video on replay dance moves had

**thegolding** (10): THIS ALSO DESERVES A 11 UGH. I love this song since I saw miss Lizzie McGuire dancing to it while getting ready to ruin her graduation. This is for the herstory books

**vivaforever597** (10): Interestingly, the middle-8 (the only original part of the song) is easily the best part. Pure euphoric pop, and in retrospect it probably did a lot to shape my taste in music thanks to its inclusion on the Lizzie McGuire Movie soundtrack. Nearly my 11.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this has gospel vibes

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): The Lizzie McGuire Movie made me who I am today, for better and for worse

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): this was my introduction to Blondie

**1998tweety** (8.5): the original >>>

**celladonn** (8.5): the Blondie version is superior but still, bop

**moonagenightmares** (8.5): i liked this so much i had to google if this was the original… it wasnt… again ctfu

**seanderlust** (8.5): a wonderful cover of a smasher of a classic

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): They must have payola-ed this on radio disney because they played it every hour for like 3 years straight

**starla\_** (8.5): I love this cover, it's so nostalgic. The 'Get the Feeling' part is bliss

**TiltControls** (8.5): Not as good as Blondie's more famous cover, but it adds some nice sections that are fun. Though this feels ripped right out of a DCOM movie

**BaconShoes** (8): a fun version of this song, but I think I prefer the Blondie cover

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Atomic Kitten and Blondie have so much in common: covering this song, being blonde, losing rates…

**fadedblue09** (8): Scratch that, this is actually more Natasha that the last song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): ~~Do The Live Action Disney Channel/Nickelodeon Rate~~

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): Before Disney had a viable roster of teen pop stars, they would simply import the squeaky-clean pop coming out of Europe. If you were too old for Mickey but too young for Britney, Radio Disney had you covered with the likes of "Upside Down", "Bring It All Back", "It's the Way You Make Me Feel ", and yes, this cover. This is, objectively, not that good, but i have too many fond memories to give it anything less.

**kaanew** (8): a radio disney classic

**mysario** (8): Blondie outsold

**throwaway-7650** (8): wow they really are the blondie of the rate

**bbfan132** (7): this sounds like a disney cover, and that’s not a bad thing

**plastichaxan** (7): this is kinda silly too but i guess they’re british so

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Pretty good cover. Probably the best version of the song by far.

#that one shitty experimental song from Blondie - Parallel Lines we all tanked in New Wave Giants

**thedoctordances1940** (6.3): another one of the many omg this song moments in this rate but this actually isn't very good is it

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is fine but only because the original song is so good and this is lesser

**Melody** (6): I wish i liked the song  .. but its so corny.

**qazz23** (6): decent cover, but Blondie's version is the best

**raggedy-princess** (6): not a great idea to go head-to-head with Blondie

**robincav** (6): Bridge saves. Nonsense lyrics don't hit

**stbrigidiscross** (6): I don't think this cover was necessary but at least it was upbeat and respect to Natasha for doing the dancing while pregnant.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): you won't be #1 in this rate

**Marvelous2002** (5): Kinda cute again, I think I've goven up on connecting with them

**sarcasticsobs** (5): I’m cacklin’

**oscarbrierley1** (4): early childhood Nostalgia. It hasn't aged well tho. It feels repetitive and I dont like the country guitar.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): my arch nemesis blondie…so we meet again…

**WaneY2UKtoc** (4): i like that the main girl looks like beth gibbons but sadly does not sound like beth gibbons. this looked like an intense dance to choreograph

**Smuckles** (3): Oh fuck, the song isn't carrying them this time. This is real bad! I'd love to be a fly on the wall when/if Debbie Harry heard this.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): I’m definitely not holding on

**criestotheclicking** (2): I have an irrational hate for this version

**daretheghost** (1): How to take a great song and cover it, retaining none of the charisma or yearning that made the original great in the first place. [2]

**bogo** (0): i hated this song when blondie sang it and i still hate it now

**MrSwearword** (0): absolutely not, this awful cover is why I hate this group.

**nootnoot781** (0): name a better duo than british girl groups and releasing god awful covers.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): For whatever reason, whenever I see the ~~yikes and dogwhistle-filled~~ popheads takes on H.E.R.’s music being too mellow and boring, my brain goes right to thinking about 90s R&B singer Joe 😭 Outside of like Stuttering, a lot of his output is very smooth R&B to me, not much hint of earlier new jack swing or late 90s neo-soul to be found. And I like it a lot! So, the mischief part of my brain was curious to where this sort of song would end up here, and well, Day 1 seems about right! Stream “I Wanna Know” for clear skin!

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): despite every fibre in my being telling me to be a misandrist, Joe makes the song

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorites! The switch up in delivery from Mis-Teeq is really refreshing, it’s nice to hear them nailing a softer sound and you can never go wrong with that silky sexy futuristic ’00s r&b sound. Makes me wanna cook for my man.

**nt96** (10): sounds vaguely similar to Always On Time by Ja Rule. Still a great song!

**seanderlust** (10): the harmonies on "maybe" are so pretty

**indie\_fan\_** (9.4): This gon’ be day 1 won’t it

**welcome2thejam** (9): Good slow jam

**1998tweety** (8): me everyday

**bbfan132** (8): v pleasant to listen to while chilling out

**MrSwearword** (8): something tells me this was supposed to be their "American" debut, in which case thank god the label went under so Scandalous would be remembered as their true triumph.

**throwaway-7650** (8): pleasant bg music [non-derogatory]

**TiltControls** (8): They've shown bops, now they're showing they can kill ballads too

**BaconShoes** (7.5): smooth

**fadedblue09** (7): very slick and smooth, but goes nowhere after a while

**StarSquash45** (7): not me enjoying male vocals for once

**Stryxen** (7): this is so intimate.. I feel like im intruding

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.5): upvote if you’d let him give you a kiss

**starla\_** (6.5): decent but repetitive

**daretheghost** (6): I don’t love it.

**oscarbrierley1** (6): this song feels like it was tacked on the album for americans.

**stbrigidiscross** (6): it's perfectly nice but lacks the special Mis-Teeq edge that makes them so great.

**Marvelous2002** (5): Cute

**slimboyfriend** (5): YouTube comment left 10 years ago by P-Dog: “Yes!!! This song gets me in the mood.”

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): from any other group this would have been a fine song but coming from mis-teeq i cant help but be disappointed at how underwhelming this is

**thegolding** (4): the vocals are so good but the rest of the song doesn't really have it for me

#[AND I'M JOE TO YEW!](https://youtu.be/1svA2sGhDEE?t=12)

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.6): sorta just a vibe cut ngl, but also Joe (plumber? avg six-pack? danger? blow?) sorta hits it just right. everyone in the club is having a good time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): Our final song of Day 1, and a quintessential early 2010s EDM banger! Flo Rida hopped on a remix of this song after he blocked The Saturdays from two chances to hit #1 on the UK Charts. It’s fun, brainless EDM that has definitely grown on me.

#Rate winners of Early 2010s Pop Rap Rate

**akanewasright** (10): there’s something about flo rida and this kind of hook that makes me feel emotional and nostalgic for no good reason JDJDH

**hoolytoledo** (10): quintessential pop music really

**StarSquash45** (10): This was a strong contender for my 11 omg

**TCHALLA1966** (10): yes I gave it a 10 yes flo rida was needed I will not explain more

**throwaway-7650** (10): now I really want to stream right round

**seanderlust** (9.5): shoutout to flo rida's backup singers who had to just sit there and be like "er! er! er! er!"

**1998tweety** (9): this man can do no wrong

**BeauMeringue212** (9): even Una sounds good on this one

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): VEGAS LET ME HEAR YALL MAKE SOME NOISE!!

**robincav** (9): Revitalises me

**thegolding** (9): this is such a femminist anthem?? idc

**vivaforever597** (9): A point deducted for it being the Flo Rida version. Sean Paul added something to What About Us. Flo actually detracted from Higher.

**apatel27** (8.5): Just good memories of High School associated with this song

**plastichaxan** (8.5): the opening lines are so camp please

**agentofscranton** (8): aggressively 2010

**daretheghost** (8): Points docked for Flo Rida, who adds nothing.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This kinda hits more than I thought it would, like yeah it’s a generic ‘10s club banger but it’s a *good* generic ‘10s club banger.

**Melody** (8): remove flo Rida and the slay reveals itself.

**mysario** (8): with all the cover versions present in the rate, I'm kind of disappointed it's not Creed's "Higher" ft Flo Rida

**qazz23** (8): a bit too polished but like the rap verse

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): The most introspective Flo Rida has ever been

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): see my Ego comment (unless this is an earlier elim then wait I guess)

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): they just dont make music this good these days

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): honestly i love how flo rida gets into these random collabs with european artists, first the song he featured on in eurovision and now this? honestly im happy for him

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): flo rida is the best thing to ever happen to music

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): more autotune than charli xcx

**criestotheclicking** (7): “I’m doing nothing so at least I’m doing nothing wrong” chronic anxiety realness

**ImADudeDuh** (7): america representation :heart:

**Luxaria** (7): Signalling the end of the Y2K era by collabing with Flo Rida for sure

**Marvelous2002** (7): The chorus drags on for a bit longer than it's welcome but the beginning of the chorus is still good so idk how I feel about it. Expected Flo Rida but he wasn't there, not disappointed

**Stryxen** (7): that intro was so jarring sjdhfkf

**TiltControls** (7): And what other better way to represent the 2010s by having Flo Rida on a song

**welcome2thejam** (7): Enough time has passed for me to be slightly nostalgic for Flo Rida, wtf

#Like a G6

**bbfan132** (6.5): this is pretty fun but not amazing or anything

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): It is weird going back to early 2010s electropop when you have no nostalgia for the songs

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Always been a Flo Rida anti. This makes me No Fun sometimes but I will not apologize!

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): this song was written for the charts and it did well in them, but idk it feels even more soulless and commercial than their other songs.

**celladonn** (5): this is that bad kind of 2010 dance pop but I can't help but smile at a flo rida appearance

**fadedblue09** (5): Flo Rida washed these girls I fear

**frogaranaman** (5): ????????

**MrSwearword** (5): no...this does not measure up to the other songs here

**BaconShoes** (4.5): I feel like this could have been by kim kardashian or something and it sounds very dated in a way I don’t enjoy

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): This could be any failed American girl group from the early 2010s

**CrimsonROSET** (4): see sometimes eliminating songs just because of the guest rapper is valid

**nt96** (4): lower pls

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Pretty generic and forgettable, sounds very 2011.

**Smuckles** (4): Sweet, we're in the feature era now. No point to Flo Rida being here at all.

**Amazon4life** (3): Talk about generic...

**WaneY2UKtoc** (3): again, absolute purgatory of end of the 00s pop radio that feels entirely anonymous. colossal achievement EVEN with Flo Rida :/

**starla\_** (2.5): too screechy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): This is some seriously nondescript early 2010s shit.

oscarbrierley1: The correct sugababes song is gone. The correct 2 atomic kitten songs are left. All saints on the other hand, the tastelessness at how many songs have been voted out... at least I know where it's at is still there.

throwaway-7650: I fear the all saints massacre is deserved, they had 4/5 of my lowest scores in the rate and the only group that I didn't have a 8.5+ average for (it was actually sub-5) </3 I know where it's at for first out tomorrow!
