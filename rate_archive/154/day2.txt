**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): why‚Äôd I rate this so high

**flavasavavandal** (7): love that they let Pingu feature on this song right at the end but it would‚Äôve been nice if they credited him

---

# Disco best genre wbk

**Awkward\_King** (10): this isnt disco but i do love it

**DirtyRat583** (10): this vibe of song was so common in 2013ish u could make a rate of just them and i would give it 10s across the board

**ImADudeDuh** (10): you know what, pandering works

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): definitely the #1 song that references Baby One More Time

**thegolding** (10): THIS IS SO GOOD MY SHABBAT GIRLS

**throwaway-7650** (10): I love disco [4]

**seanderlust** (9.2): remember that remix of real groove by kylie minogue that featured dua lipa? imagine if that was ava max instead and you get this

**1998tweety** (9): ended Stupid Love

**StarSquash45** (9): between this and Gentleman it's like we GET IT!! you're 90s kids!!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Basic and unoriginal but hell if it isn't fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): And we love the liberal use of the word ‚Äúdisco‚Äù in this sub don‚Äôt we?

**MrSwearword** (8): I so want to read them for the pandering, "It's never winter when it's Donna Summer all year long." moment, however I can't shit on this cute song too hard. Still, they pushed their luck with something like that. TOOT TOOT BEEP BEEP when mentioning the queen, gurls.

**qazz23** (8): lives up to its title, plus üé∑ !

**TCHALLA1966** (8): she‚Äôs a cutie

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): make up your mind what fucking year do you want to go to????

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): yknow i gotta give it to the saturdays, they actually know what year baby one more time came out it, unlike a certain anne-marie

**bbfan132** (7): the pop culture references are annoying but it‚Äôs fun sonically

**CrimsonROSET** (7): disco icon britney spears

**fadedblue09** (7): I feel like I should score this higher because this isn't dated as their other stuff, but at the same time, I don't wanna be called a basic disco gay (even if this is barely disco)

**uberpigeon** (7): wish popheads had some disco love when they rated kylie

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Morphs into something good by the end but wow it takes a long time to get there

**Marvelous2002** (6.5): It's good but I'm not sure why they went in that direction

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): None of these girls were born in the 70s. And the song's not even disco! (It's still pretty good tho)

**Stryxen** (6.1): they do love a name drop

**criestotheclicking** (6): subtle product placement.

**daretheghost** (6): Are these last three songs emblematic of a late-career decline or

**sarcasticsobs** (6): [patiently waiting for said ‚Äúdisco‚Äù] ‚Ä¶

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): fitting song title

# Disco sux

**BaconShoes** (5.5): I‚Äôm over the Saturdays I‚Äôm sorry

**nt96** (5): they really be adding rhythmic guitars on a beat and call it disco these days huh?

**slimboyfriend** (5): The most disco thing about this song is the attempt at the Donna Summer wordplay

**WaneY2UKtoc** (4.2): "This should be a number 1 hit.. The Saturdays are often over looked in the music business but with a tune like this they really show how much they deserve their fame. Another fab hit girls :)"

**Melody** (4): lame.. corny.. boo tomato tomatoes.. throwing tomatoes.

**TiltControls** (4): ARE THEY ALL MISPLACED IN TIME IN THE 90s AND NEED OUR HELP??

**starla\_** (3.5): boring

**TheQueenofVultures** (3.5): This feels like a half 1999 by Charli XCX and half generic pop track from a movie about how pop music is generic

**Smuckles** (3): Very half-arsed. I think even they're bored singing this honestly.

**Luxaria** (2): Not a single iota of disco here.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): IDGAF if this is produced through a tin can and a clipping mess, I can‚Äôt get ENOUGH of this dramatic ass song lollllll. Before they got totally overtaken by generic EDM, this Kelly Clarkson-esque banger just totally hooked me. It‚Äôs really just Vanessa‚Äôs belting that hypes me up lol. I also think it‚Äôs vaguely reminiscent of Emeli Sande‚Äôs first album, as there‚Äôs dramatic belting over a skittering beat. An easy sell for me!

**flavasavavandal** (3): I can hear the edge of the mix clipping as the song stretches against the constraints, the limp electric guitar, there is no yass, there is no slay, just a not very interesting girl group making what I would describe as the generic version of a 2000s UK hit

---

# It‚Äôs A Neverending Story

**Awkward\_King** (10): BEST SONG EVER

**daretheghost** (10): The girls are singin!

**MassiveThief** (10): saturdays are IT wow

**StarSquash45** (10): A few days ago I was with my friends and this came on the radio and they said it was "the worst song that had played so far" :/

**thedoublebanana** (10): This MV is the definition of camp.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): warped our understanding of space and time

**throwaway-7650** (10): when the chorus hits I just want to sing YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN... SO NOW WHO'S GONNA CRY FOR YEW...

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): me when one of my rate ideas finally gets chosen

**plastichaxan** (9.5): when she creamed forever is over omfg

**apatel27** (9): The chorus is amazing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): But the slay has just begun.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The chorus is like being jump scared by a moody teen show soundtrack

**qazz23** (9): strong chorus, love the multiple vocalists

**cherryices** (8.9): yes i bought this music video on itunes when it came out‚Ä¶ the latent lesbianism of it all

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Vanessa really was the Nadine of the group, she carried on this

**bbfan132** (8): this was fun, i liked the rock/electroclash sound of it

**Marvelous2002** (8): Omg I forgot how hard the chorus hit,and it all gets better after the first one. Vanessa is a VOCALIST (and so is Nadine). It's so funny when they sing and another less vocally able member lip syncs over their parts, it doesn't seem do anyone good haha

**MrSwearword** (8): the song is cute, but jesus fuck only Rochelle and Una weren't done dirty by the makeup people on set that day.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): they belt the hell out of this song, as they should since it was meant for kelly Clarkson.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.4): Luv to pop rock

**welcome2thejam** (7): Might be overrating since it's following up such a boring song, but I do appreciate the energy

**starla\_** (6.5): that belt in the chorus

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.4): I think this one‚Äôs fine

**akanewasright** (6): The singer on the chorus is eating‚Ä¶ nothing else is

**criestotheclicking** (6): I just get such intense mum vibes from them all?? Not in a weird way, in a they‚Äôre-dressed-double-their age kind of way. Or maybe it‚Äôs just the early 2010s fashion that had teenagers dressed in peplums.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): lover? /puts on sunglasses more like over

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): this can't not have been a Kelly Clarkson reject

**Luxaria** (6): The mix lets this one down, the vocals need to be turned up

**Smuckles** (6): That's a good chorus! Can't help but wonder how much more I'd like it if this was performed by another artist though, someone who could really belt it out. Maybe a Lizzo perhaps?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this chorus is fun but the verses are really dragging this down

**TiltControls** (6): Add a live feeling to the vocals and this could be a Eurovision song

## It‚Äôs Over For Them

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I think Boys like Girls did this one better

**WaneY2UKtoc** (4.9): purgatory H&M type beat. would probably die on black friday listening to this song in an H&M while while trying to rip a onesie off a shelf and having it fall on me.

**BaconShoes** (4): a bit grating tbh

**vivaforever597** (3): I'm so thankful I first heard of them with Ego so I didn't have to go through a crisis of faith when they went from the first album and Just Can't Get Enough to... this. Probably their worst single.

**fadedblue09** (2.5): The amount of vocal processing here makes the song grating

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Robbed! Misunderstood! The popheads demographic missed out on the window of being passively indoctrinated by S Club 7 in the UK and States, but I am oldhead enough to have had that happen to me. Therefore, this brash and cheesy 70s-inspired number is so fun to me. It‚Äôs so funny to me that the guys from OMD decided to create this girl group to keep writing pop songs, as no OMD songs I‚Äôve heard sound like THIS. But maybe they were just adept at morphing their sound to any era. This was from their flop first album, but I think this era and music video definitely scream Y2K. If I grew up in England I‚Äôd def be stanning Atomic Kitten lol

**flavasavavandal** (10): S-Club 7 have less men than I remember them having

---

# S-Club 7 Stans

**BaconShoes** (10): I hadn‚Äôt heard this, but it‚Äôs an absolute smash

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Alright we‚Äôre starting out the Nuclear Pussy part of the rate with a bop!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): they put their whole atomic kittens in this song

**MassiveThief** (10): ate

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): What a way to debut

**Stryxen** (10): üíÉ

**throwaway-7650** (10): I love disco

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this would pop off at a wedding i just know it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): i didn‚Äôt expect STRINGS here? their power‚Ä¶

**oscarbrierley1** (9): v camp and fun

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): among us twerking gif

**welcome2thejam** (9): This is the type of sound I expected from British girl group pop

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): generic pop can be fun

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Sounds like the soundtrack to a fantastic aerobics class

**nt96** (8.5): when I ask the hosts when I should start the rate

**stbrigidiscross** (8.5): I love how energetic and fun this is, the original lineup of Atomic Kitten was so bouncy and slightly chaotic which I really like in a pop group.

**TiltControls** (8.5): But what if i'm busy

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): I inititally scored this kinda low but compared to the rest of their songs here this is fucking gold

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.1): this one's a pretty good execution of camp. authentic camp.

**akanewasright** (8): this is all empty calories and I‚Äôm kinda living for it

**fadedblue09** (8): This sounds like the kind of Y2K dancepop present throughout here in Asia

**Melody** (8): upbeat kitty

**qazz23** (8): yay, a disco sound

**TCHALLA1966** (8): the British in me is 2 stepping to this rn

**apatel27** (7): Very much biting S Club 7

**bbfan132** (7): this chorus is so blatantly sexual and it‚Äôs jarring

**frogaranaman** (7): makes me want to speak in a German accent

**slimboyfriend** (7): were these girls like 15

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): That whole late 90s British disco revival - "Canned Heat", "Rock DJ", "Your Disco Needs You" - just never did anything for me, sorry.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): Not the best disco-inspired song by a girl group produced by Absolute, but it's still good nonetheless.

# Get rid of it baby Right Now

**criestotheclicking** (5): one of those songs you hear but never know the name of.

**daretheghost** (5): This song doesn‚Äôt have the momentum to make that a capella break feel satisfying or earned.

**MrSwearword** (5): this sounds like it's soundtracking Trinny and Susannah trying to make someone dress in uglier clothing than what they were wearing.

**Smuckles** (5): Oh yeah, I forgot them and Steps tried to make disco a thing again.

**starla\_** (4.5): a little too cheesy

**Amazon4life** (4): Kinda too generic for me.

**Marvelous2002** (3.8): I guess it's fun and some parts like the vocals are good, but the production (the instrumental and the intro) are not very good imo. As soon as the intro hit I was like 'oh no', I did NOT like that sound.

**moonagenightmares** (1): theres no type of 2yk music i hate more than this

**flavasavavandal** (10): Left Eye definitely ghost-rapped the rap verse here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): To my surprise this is a Steely Dan sample (tho I‚Äôve yet to enter my #Danimal era, my old white guy band of choice is Rush thank u very much) and it‚Äôs so well utilized on this TLC-biting track. It makes sense, since producer Cameron McVey crafted the currently-rated band Massive Attack and their first album (not in the rate) Blue Lines. This definitely set a tone for the viiiiibe All Saints would have throughout their career.

---

# Knows where to put there good scores at

**akanewasright** (10): They‚Äôre ripping off TLC but like. They‚Äôre doing a pretty good job at it idk!

**Awkward\_King** (10): endlessly slay, shaznay has never flopped a day in her life

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): They‚Äôre talking about the slay button.

**kappyko** (10): was gonna be like "i see the tlc comparisons but this could just be a facsimile of other girl groups" and then the rap verse started and i was like that is left eye no fucking way

**nt96** (10): they're called All Saints but they put their whole ahem...girlhood into this >.>

**Roxieloxie** (10): tlcabees made points

**Smuckles** (10): The rap verse! The difference between All Saints and everyone else was that not only did they probably know what Paid In Full was but they also probably actively enjoyed it!

**TCHALLA1966** (10): this really hit me in the nostalgia

**oscarbrierley1** (9.7): their biggest bop. The chorus is so catchy. The rap part is beyond iconic to me.

**amr** (9): loses a point for the left eyeisms but a perfect song otherwise

**BaconShoes** (9): a vibe

**qazz23** (9): good use of samples and fairly catchy

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): not groundbreaking or anything but it feels good! the sample is used well!

**Stryxen** (9): must resist the urge not to loop just yet and continue the rate

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like this! it‚Äôs fun, albeit not super original

**starla\_** (8.5): this song has such terrible lyrics but it is so good for running to and I associate it with a runner's high so I have to rate it highly

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.4): sick Fez sample there. love y2uk superstars steely dan #DANIMALS RISE UP

**daretheghost** (8): Very 1997-hip, which helped set All Saints apart from a few of their contemporaries.

**MrSwearword** (8): it's a lot better than I expected but the vocals are clearly too dulcet for a beat like this. However, shoutout to Shaznay, who was carrying the performance in the video.

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): The harmonizations that girl groups had in the 90s cannot be beat!

**1998tweety** (7.5): What I will NOT reply with when my parents ask where something is

**StarSquash45** (7.5): i just really like this melody

**stbrigidiscross** (7.5): A nice introduction to the band, whenever I see the title written down I automatically hear the shouted I know where it's at response from beginning of the song

**BeauMeringue212** (7): me when tourists ask me for directions in my hometown

**TiltControls** (7): You can't tell me this was never used in a 2000s show or movie as the main character enters high school

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.7): it's cute but there's a hundred late 90s songs that sound exactly like this

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Braces‚Äô rap was a little wacky

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): if you know where it's at why didn't you bring it to this song‚Ä¶

**CrimsonROSET** (6): back of the 7/11

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): ngl the vocals on this are kinda bad and I don‚Äôt get why they thought it would be socially acceptable to rap

**ImADudeDuh** (6): feels like they slowed it down for some reason

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): Should‚Äôve faded out a lot earlier.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): its fine, but i feel like there are so many other songs from the same era that do this style better


# Doesn‚Äôt know where good music is at

**criestotheclicking** (5): my good sister needs a better wig.

**Marvelous2002** (5): Drags on for way too long, the rap is really enjoyable though. Are debut singles the weakest girl group releases? Discuss using examples from ancient to modern history.

**throwaway-7650** (5): omfg that self-reference was so corny wtf.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): First of all, why is that intro so dreary??? Besides that, this is just typical bubblegum pop

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): it‚Äôs not here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): This was such a moment for them. Why? I think the song is fine enough, but the music video is so laughable to me. They clearly were not a top priority of Polydor at the time. I don‚Äôt often let a music video sway my opinion of a song ~~though there will always be Night Changes~~, but man, the cheap production on Ego with the silly superhero plot. Really, it‚Äôs the carnival face paint lightning bolt on Mollie‚Äôs face that docks this but 2 extra points.

**flavasavavandal** (4): that keyboard or synth line that runs throughout most if not all of the song is kinda annoying but this feels childish in the worst way possible

---

# Torn by Ava Max music video

**Awkward\_King** (11): spending all my childhood years sat in front of the TV watching top 40 chart videos on 4music... this is my LADN... darj i am forever indebted to you

**agentofscranton** (10): my dad walked in on me watching the music video for this back when I was like 13 - specifically the part where una takes off her coat and unveils her boobs - and i think he's been using that moment to justify his belief that I might be straight ever since

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is 100% pure unconcentrated gaslighting, but they slayed so maybe it was necessary?

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I put this on a playlist I made for one of my OCs so I probably like it more than I should.

**MrSwearword** (10): an effective telloff track, well done gherls

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Marvel stole their concept

**thedoublebanana** (10): The amount I belted this song in my car is too many times to count.

**TiltControls** (9.5): This is the perfect messy late 00s/early 2010s pop I love

**hoolytoledo** (9): this song will most likely get slandered but it‚Äôs a personal guilty pleasure of mine

**Marvelous2002** (9): Beautiful gowns. Honestly though chorus is strong but verses and pre chorus > chorus. I miss these girls, I love them all, I hope they will have a reunion at some point

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): guilty pleasure pop vibes

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended BTS

**StarSquash45** (8.5): Does this song sample something? Part of it sounds so familiar and I can't tell if it was from another song or if this song was just ingrained into me as a wain

**criestotheclicking** (8): another banger chorus.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): relevant!

**daretheghost** (8): We need more sassy kiss-offs in pop music these days.

**Luxaria** (8): Sorry not sorry I love it

**qazz23** (8): liking the different synths on this

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): gimme more of this 00s electropop I literally don't care how good the production is

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): men amirite ladies?

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Is that the Poker Face beat I hear

**bbfan132** (7): this sounds very early 2010s but it‚Äôs fun

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): sometimes you just need a good ‚Äúfuck men‚Äù anthem to get you going

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): this is such an underwhelming chorus but the rest is good at least

**BaconShoes** (6): this is better than the previous two Saturdays songs, but I am still not sold

# Needs to knock some sense into their egos

**WaneY2UKtoc** (5.9): it rules listening to this and being able to feel my soul slip from me. some flavors of y2uk absolutely rip but these people are just evil.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5.5): this can't not have been a Gaga reject

**starla\_** (5.5): extremely 2010

**akanewasright** (5): this is the most 2010 song ever made

**sarcasticsobs** (5): Hm. Usually I can get into stuff that‚Äôs ‚Äúof this time‚Äù, but can‚Äôt grasp this.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Tries to recreate the same kind of RedOne vibes but I think Cascada did a much better job of replicating his sound at the time

**Smuckles** (4): In the UK I think this song has been on adverts for at least 3 separate pharmacies by now.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): When this was called the ‚ÄúNCT - Sticker‚Äù of the rate, I finally felt seen. This being the FIRST Girls Aloud song out, criminal for me, I weep‚Ä¶I get though why this song is so polarizing. I love songs that pummel me in the face, and this electroclash with a samba groove batshit crazy number is soooo good to me, it‚Äôs my third favorite Girls Aloud song ever. And the music video sleek as hell, the moment when their red dress rip to latex catsuits as Nadine crouches and starts singing ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt deny no way my d-d-d-dirty mind‚Äù As a former No Strings Attached stan let me say this outsold NSYNC and their flop Celebrity era!!!!

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): ok this song is just so much all at once, but the intensity never really hits where it needs to do, and the stutters don‚Äôt do anything for me

---

# Sexy! Yass Yass Yass

**vivaforever597** (11): This has grown on me so much. It used to be one of my least favorites on Tangled Up, but obviously now I love it.

**Amazon4life** (10): Should've been a #1.

**apatel27** (10): Meghan Trainor wishes she could

**BaconShoes** (10): i am feeling sexy

**kappyko** (10): Two Door Cinema Club you fucking HACK FRAUDS

**plastichaxan** (10): good for her

**RandomHypnotica** (10): they did not need to go as hard on this as they did‚Ä¶ but holy fuck am I glad they did

**StarSquash45** (10): i am a cis man but catch me screaming "FROM TOP TO BOTTOM I'M A WOMAN SUNSHINE" at the top of my lungs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): THIS GOES SO HARD?? AAAAA

**thegolding** (10): THE INTRO CHERYL

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): yes yes yes inject it into my veins

**throwaway-7650** (10): their songs are so chaotic [complimentary]

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): another abstinence bop from these girls

**daretheghost** (9.5): Absolutely wild.

**DirtyRat583** (9.5): this song sounds rambunctious (in a good way)

**mysario** (9.5): Girls Aloud really were the first to say "I'm Sexy and I No It" (also this uses "Hair of the Dog"? wtf???)

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): their best single after sound of the underground. Love the way thay the whole song is basically choruses.

**WaneY2UKtoc** (9.3): sorta wild how over the course of two or three listens I went from "streamlined" to "ohhhhhh I get how each of them are building off of each other as the song's tempos and musicality change. the Girls Aloud pop formula worked, and they had these intrinsically exciting videos that make you go "awooga i want catsuit". sighs in lietoc

**Marvelous2002** (9): Imagine a group releasing this today. The Serve! Yes Yes Yes... I'm also happy how there's a slightly more even spotlight

**Melody** (9): This is my sticker x

**nt96** (9): more like yas yasss YASSSSS

**qazz23** (9): More like Sexy! Yes Yes Yes

**DaHumanTorch** (8.3): itzy voice that's a no no!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): they walked so Tramp Stamps can run

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Cheryl‚Äôs voice being distorted throughout the whole song is hilarious lol sounds like she wants all flats, lemon pepper, extra wet, extra crispy

**sarcasticsobs** (8): jumpscare

**stbrigidiscross** (8): It sounds like nothing else and they finally had more than a fiver for the video. The intro is genuinely weird and it really goes in unexpected directions, all the girls sound amazing

**Stryxen** (8): campier title than something kinda ooh but less camp song ooouuuu

**akanewasright** (7.5): I hope some day someone loves me as much as this title loves its punctuation

**1998tweety** (7): relatable

**bbfan132** (7): kind of all over the place and not in the best way, but i still enjoy it

**CrimsonROSET** (7): sexy? no.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): I feel like the main heavy rock bits with the "Hair of The Dog" sample overstay their welcome but I love the song and the almost unexpected beat switch in the intro.

**seanderlust** (7): why does the chorus give me anxiety. you're right girls aloud i did forget to do a lot today, thanks for reminding me

**slimboyfriend** (7): I‚Äôve never heard a song go from zero to a thousand quite like this one

**uberpigeon** (7): put me in it when you group the hyperpop comments together

**welcome2thejam** (7): Went back-and-forth on this one, but I think the Yes's have it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Sexy maybe maybe maybe.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): total mess, up to and including the title

# Sexy? Naur Naur Naur

**amr** (6): this is punk rock

**criestotheclicking** (6): the eye makeup is giving Bratz. I‚Äôm kind of bummed I‚Äôve never heard this until now because I know I would‚Äôve loved it growing up

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Smexy! Naur Naur Naur‚Ä¶

**Luxaria** (6): The intro is let down by the rest of the song tbh

**Awkward\_King** (5): something was going wrong for one of the producers the day this was recorded like i hope whatever he was going through turned out okay

**starla\_** (4.5): no no no indeed

**TCHALLA1966** (4): NO! NO!

**MrSwearword** (3): the video is lovely but this song is bad

**Smuckles** (3): Naa, a misfire. Reminds me of those ‚Äú3rd single off the album‚Äù Pussycat Dolls songs. You know, the bad ones.

**TiltControls** (3): No No No is me as I was going through this track. It's a bit of a mess

**cremeebrulee** (2.2): they were right cause this is one of the unsexiest songs i've ever heard

**fadedblue09** (0): I almost did not finish this rate because I couldn't get through this overproduced mess

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): And with that, we say goodbye to our dear flops, Atomic Kitten! It‚Äôs no surprise this was their highest rated song on ‚Äúdisco‚Äù-loving popheads. This could have been a Kylie ‚ÄúFever‚Äù cut, and it is a very lovely use of an Electric Light Orchestra sample. Turns out it‚Äôs not coming home for the Liverpool girls </3

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): love it when disco sounds good and bops

# Number one fan of Liverpool‚Äôs best girl group

**Amazon4life** (10): Great disco track, very Kylie.

**amr** (10): no words for this song I just hope everyone else realizes how lucky we are to be able to listen to it in our lifetimes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is disco lol.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorites in the rate, the sample is used amazingly. Could be a Kylie Minogue cut.

**hoolytoledo** (10): their best by far and it‚Äôs not even close lol

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the Kylieprint

**StarSquash45** (9.8): the verses sound like a Ro√≠sin Murphy song

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): by far their best song in the rate. The sample is fun. Theres no weird vocals. It's just slay.

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): I love disco [3]

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is so sugary (compliment)

**plastichaxan** (9): not the best be with you in the rate but slay

**TiltControls** (9): I want this song to last forever

**1998tweety** (8.5): me @ Park Jimin

**bbfan132** (8.5): total bop, wish more of their songs sounded like this

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Love to see the return of those strings

**starla\_** (8.5): every decade has a disco era

**stbrigidiscross** (8.5): If they made more songs like this I would be a much bigger fan, this is so great. It's more mature than their earlier upbeat stuff but it's still great fun.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): finally some good fucking food

**BeauMeringue212** (8): the disco sound actually works for them

**raggedy-princess** (8): a genuinely good Atomic Kitten song!

**slimboyfriend** (8): This is I Want Your Love if it were actually good

**welcome2thejam** (8): Retro dance playing miracle worker yet again

**WaneY2UKtoc** (7.8): this ditty is making me think of one of those gta V cuts from nonstop pop fm. would've fit well in there. in between One Thing and the robyn heartbeat song

**BaconShoes** (7.5): disco-tinged bop

**akanewasright** (7): the hook is weak but this is the only song I‚Äôve heard since their debut where I wasn‚Äôt bored

**daretheghost** (7): I think this might be their most okay song here.

**MrSwearword** (7): how did this great beat get so cheapened...oh right AK are singing it.

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): It bops but the chorus leaves much to be desired

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Can't go wrong with an ELO sample

**qazz23** (7): some neat strings in this

**Smuckles** (7): Oh, forgot about this one! This is their best song easily for the string sample alone.


# Makes Liverpool jokes online

**Marvelous2002** (6): Hmm my fave of theirs so far, too late in their career though I'm afraid

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this is fine but i feel like its missing something to really push it over the edge

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): mis-teeq was cooler

**criestotheclicking** (5): good instrumental but lacking in the vocal department

**Olivier77777** (9.333): 9

**throwaway-7650** (8.722): they better #NOT be the group with the lowest average

**DirtyRat583** (8.578): as a north west girlie, i have no choice but to stan

**Amazon4life** (8.333): I wish they'd lasted longer :(

**thegolding** (8.222): 9

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.000): DEFINITELY the most Y2K group in the rate

**nt96** (7.944): 7.94 I can see some folks being put off with the older, more bubbly pop tracks against the more robust groups but it's Y2K! What did you expect?

**indie\_fan\_** (7.678): I was worried after seeing that not a single group member had any melanin in them, but they pleasantly surprised me!

**TiltControls** (7.611): I thought people hated this! This is really good! (Mostly.) It's very much of its time, but it gives me happy feelings listening to them so idc

**fadedblue09** (7.167): I don't get the hate, I definitely enjoyed their songs more than expected. They give me the vibe of "what if Natasha Bedingfield was a girl group"

**robincav** (6.667): Not a good group but would listen in a heartbeat

**slimboyfriend** (6.556): They sing a lot about love but never seem to say much about it

**RandomHypnotica** (6.533): neither of the words in their name suit their music, and i am incredibly dissapointed by this

**vayyiqra** (6.444): A group whose name I always thought was cool. Their part of the rate has some kind of weird stuff in it for the time period, with more than one disco-ish track and having the second-weirdest cover in the rate. Overall they're not bad though, just kind of inconsistent.

**Melody** (6.333): 5.2

**welcome2thejam** (6.111): A few good tracks, but there's just nothing to sink my teeth into here outside of the bizarre I Want Your Love, whose score I raised just because it was at least interesting in comparison

**raggedy-princess** (6.000): firmly the least interesting group here in spite of the OMD connection

**thedoctordances1940** (5.800): yeah they're not all that

**WaneY2UKtoc** (5.756): prolly not better than mezzanine really

**qazz23** (5.667): started decently but kinda went into ballad/or bland cover territory too much

**apatel27** (5.556): They feel like they were built to be remixed by Northern DJs

**akanewasright** (5.500): I read a few articles about how girls aloud and sugababes helped usher British pop in a better direction than where it was‚Ä¶ and this group is pretty much what the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù era sounds like to me. A mix of sugary sweet fun with some of the dullest ballads ever does not bode particularly well

**oscarbrierley1** (5.467): when they do dance pop it can be amazing, but i don't like their mid temp stuff. I love the sound of Natasha's voice. They have some good album tracks and surprisingly good b sides for anyone that wants to take a look.

**kaanew** (5.444): my least favorite discography out of all the groups. also before this why did I think they were Swedish?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.111): a group with a name as cool as this deserves better music!!

**Smuckles** (5.000): I suppose they're inoffensive? Not the most exciting collection of singles though, it's telling that two of their biggest hits are covers (and also fairly straight-forward covers too). A lot of very mild pop songs. At least they're better than the Saturdays.

**Marvelous2002** (4.911): All I know is that Heidi from the Sugababes was in this group at some point

**criestotheclicking** (4.889): i have low expectations

**cremeebrulee** (4.200): i really did go in with an open mind but this is not my type of music at all

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.111): Most of their songs (at least the ones I got to listen to) were pretty mid with the exceptions of Be With You, Tide is High and I Want Your Love. Probably my least favourite group in the rate.

**daretheghost** (3.889): Coming into this rate, I had a feeling Atomic Kitten would have my lowest average. They did not disappoint. <3

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): RIP queen xo

**flavasavavandal** (5): r.i.p Sarah

---

**Marvelous2002** (10): It's not an emotional song necessarily, it's pretty upbeat but it still managed to get me emotional cause of what happened. Love the way she sings the 'silver linings' line too. We lost an icon, but needless to say, no one should go through that, especially that young.

**thegolding** (10): She was always a queen

**plastichaxan** (9): camp

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): I thought this would be an emotional ballad because of the context, but I respect that this hyperpop serve is the note she wanted to go out on. Rest in peace legend </3

**daretheghost** (8.5): Girlboss anthem

**raggedy-princess** (8): <3

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Is this hyperpop?

**throwaway-7650** (8): go off production! miss you sarah ‚ù§Ô∏è

**cherryices** (7.8): never would have thought to check out sarah harding‚Äôs solo efforts, but this is so solid??

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Okay this is actually really good! It is a little bittersweet considering this was one of the last things she did before her cancer got to her. but hey, it's still a good tune! RIP Sarah <3

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I‚Äôm not really falling the metaphor here tbh but I‚Äôm yassing a bit.

**kappyko** (7): Bad but good!

**BaconShoes** (6.5): nothing amazing, but it‚Äôs fun

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): i feel like this would be better with harsher production and a more aggressive delivery

**TCHALLA1966** (6.5): alright

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This is cute but why is it produced like she can‚Äôt sing?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): ursula when she steals ariel‚Äôs voice and tries to marry prince eric herself:

**TiltControls** (6): There's something here, but I don't know if I love the song as a whole

**seanderlust** (5.8): jolin Tsai would put this out in 2009 and vastly outsell this version

**criestotheclicking** (5): conceptually a good song but the lyrics are bland. It‚Äôs somehow giving YA, or, DCOM. Rest in Peace, Sarah! I realise that sounds so backhanded after criticising the song but I really do miss her

**Melody** (5): Sarah sweetie.

**MrSwearword** (5): the chorus is solid but overall, this is giving Burger King crown.

**welcome2thejam** (5): This chorus feels manufactured in a lab to be used in Twitter fanvids

**bbfan132** (4.5): not the biggest fan of this, unfortunately

**GlialUreterostenosis** (4): is this another XoBrooklynne remix

**slimboyfriend** (4): I don‚Äôt remember where I first heard this song but I don‚Äôt want to hear it again :))))

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Woops not my 8 score from a few weeks ago. The production is absolute garbage but I‚Äôve known the song for years and the melody is nice.

**flavasavavandal** (3): Cheryl really gave the ~~world~~ UK this absolutely nothing of a song and it sold over a million copies in the UK

---

**1998tweety** (10): I love Sunmi - Heroine

**criestotheclicking** (10): genuinely a watershed moment in like 2009 or whenever this debuted on X Factor. Cheryl has plenty of amazing songs, she is quite underrated overall. i don't know what's with the constant random woodblocks though.

**MrSwearword** (10): it is not her true triumph, "Call My Name", however this still slays.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Beyond excellent debut single (Promise This and Call My Name are her best songs though and I hope we rate them someday)

**thegolding** (10): I really wish I could give this song an 11 as well. This is one of my favorite songs ever. I remember more than 10 years ago some Cheryl fans account followed me on Twitter so I went to discover her music and FFTL was the chosen one. I couldn't believe what my ears were listening to this song deserved to be a worlwide hit and not only on Europe. This is how a star is born

**TragicKingdom1** (10): we want cheryl vs jessie j vs rita ora vs little mix debuts

**Amazon4life** (9): One of her few good solo songs.

**Melody** (9): Cheryl really had the UK in a chokehold.. and this song is a banger x

**TCHALLA1966** (9): this was like the worst song on her album in the end but twas a cute debut

**DirtyRat583** (8.8): u should have done call my name instead, that song is INCREDIBLE

**cherryices** (8): an iconic debut, though the verses are a touch muddled

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): [Cheryl Cole‚Äôs 10 removed from popheads ballot because she is ‚Äúno longer relevant‚Äù](https://www.nme.com/news/music/cheryl-cole-waxwork-removed-madame-tussauds-no-longer-relevant-2540028)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): we gotta file file file file file for divorce

**bbfan132** (7.5): her solo music is kind of boring but i‚Äôve always liked this song

**Marvelous2002** (7.5): The song is slower than I feel like it should be. Cheryl's solo career ATE and she deaerves more now, she's been releasing some bops (incostintently though). Also she gets too much hate for her vocals, she's not Mariah, Whitney or Celine but she's still pretty good and she's made what she has work for her. Parachute is still that song.

**daretheghost** (7): I would think a song about fighting for love would have more urgency.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): something something Sunmi reference

**TiltControls** (7): the chorus is a little lifeless, but the verses are nice

**thedoctordances1940** (6.9): oh i remember this

**starla\_** (6.5): sorry Cheryl I will not be fighting for this song to win the bonus rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): How many songs in this rate have been love songs describing just absolutely putrid relationships?

**indie\_fan\_** (6): I had to look at my phone to see if I accidentally skipped to some Demi song during the hook

**apatel27** (5): It's really funny that at the end of it all, the things she'll most be known for is her ugly tattoo and having a kid with someone 10 years younger than her

**BaconShoes** (5): Nicola‚Äôs music is MILES better idk how cheryl ended up being more successful

**raggedy-princess** (5): Sunmi outsold

**seanderlust** (5): the mixing here is atrocious

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Yet another robbed song. In a way a sister song to Pure Shores (plus All Saints could only start working again with the busy William Orbit after Pure Shores proved a success). Originally intended Kirsty Bertarelli (about her love life to a Swiss billionaire, lol), it was later scrapped and given to All Saints. They and Orbit make it their own with a very unconventional and unexpected pop song. Like a darker and moodier Pure Shores, which I am all about.

**flavasavavandal** (9): it definitely isn‚Äôt as special as Pure Shores but it still has that dreamy, at ease spark to it that still makes it excellent

---

# Coffeehead

**Amazon4life** (11): One of my favorite songs ever. The video is classic early 00s vibes, nostalgia overload.

**stbrigidiscross** (11): This is so amazingly written, arranged and produced. I love it and listening to it feels emotional and like you're listening to actual art

**akanewasright** (10): Kingdom Hearts II Pooh Ascending gif

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Words cannot describe how amazing this song is tbh

**qazz23** (10): amazing production and harmonies; overall it's dreamy and the bridge has a '60s feel to it, also love the ending switch up (11 candidate)

**robincav** (10): I kinda gasped at the chorus it changed me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Ray of Light-core

**Smuckles** (10): Jesus fuck this is so good. I'm honestly a little lost for words on it. I can't go back on my Pure Shores loyalty.. but I was mighty tempted to. The chorus is perfect, soft and warm yet bittersweet. There's a darker subtext to the lyrics here I think and the visuals of black coffee and cigarettes evoke it beautifully. The feeling of being truly in love with someone yet knowing that nothing is 100% perfect, that we're all human. I have to mention the outro as well, just a delightfully weird choice to end the song like that but it works, a pure trip-hop powerplay. I hope this one does well and people don't pass it by, it's a truly brilliant song.

**StarSquash45** (10): the somewhat dark sound with the sweet lyrics just gives it such an air of sincerity

**throwaway-7650** (10): what 3rd single? idk anything about a 3rd single.

**seanderlust** (9.2): my favorite of the all saints tracks so far! the lyrics are so sweet and loving

**BaconShoes** (9): this was cool, some interesting things going on

**bbfan132** (9): i love the dreamy production and the harmonies, this sounds v nice

**fadedblue09** (9): Sounds really weird but I dig the spacey vibe

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): One of the weirdest songs in the rate but in a good way, it‚Äôs so spacey and kinda unexpected for a girl group but it works

**kappyko** (9): DUHHHHHHHH

**Melody** (9): their stand-up movement, I feel like they've always been futuristic.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): omg I am drinking black coffee right now as I listen! Bonus points for that! It‚Äôs pretty

**Stryxen** (9): just got teleported to the year 2300 how futuristic

**nt96** (8.8): Darjeeling Dark Roast (yes I know it‚Äôs a tea, shut up)

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): I LOVE the chorus on this one

**starla\_** (8.5): gorgeous production and hooks

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.4): just a stronger pure shores.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): that outro was cunt

**slimboyfriend** (8): The way they suddenly started making really good cool girl music out of nowhere

**vivaforever597** (8): Jezebel once described All Saints as "the group behind Black Coffee" and I was like, what American knows them for Black Coffee? Shouldn't that be "the group behind Never Ever"?

**1998tweety** (7.5): its gonna need to be at least a light brown for me

**daretheghost** (7.5): I love the way this sounds but it kind of comes & goes.

**TiltControls** (7.5): I am not a coffee fan (sorry darj) - but this is solid

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): i kinda like this but they need to hurry it up a bit

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): my mum lied to me, I am now an adult and I STILL don't like coffee!! Hot chocolate forever!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): but what does it have to do with coffee

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): Pure Shores but worse

**Luxaria** (7): Fine but no Pure Shores is it?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): their electropop flop slay

# Teaheads

**Marvelous2002** (6.7): That example comment really shows that the hosts have never had good Black Coffee. I hate black coffees but not Black Coffee

**welcome2thejam** (6): Wish more of the song was like the ending

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Song flavored song. Also why does this feel 10 minutes long??

**Awkward\_King** (2): this is the first one thats just given nothing ngl

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): THE best ballad in this whole rate, I will NOT be taking any other options here! Once you get into this song, you just become completely obsessed. The somber melodrama in the beginning, then the slightly rock-y chorus, THEN Keisha SERVING with the vocals towards the end! As an American I feel denied this iconic song since apparently they edited in a random other song in our version of Love Actually, a crime! A fantastic cover of a French song the Sugababes make all their own.

**flavasavavandal** (10): There is a really sinister edge to Too Lost In You (especially in the guitar) that just sends this song into overdrive. Hands down the best ballad in the rate, an incredibly moment in pop history

---


# Lost without their 11

**BeauMeringue212** (11): There were honestly a lot of 11 contenders in this rate for me, but every time I listened back to the chorus on this it just kept winning me over. The harmonies are gorgeous

**indie\_fan\_** (11): this pleasantly surprised the hell outta me, but yeah this is a beautiful track

# What, Actually

**agentofscranton** (10): when the electric guitar kicks in? that's history

**akanewasright** (10): the DRAMA

**Amazon4life** (10): They really have some great ballads, but this one is probably the best.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Holds crucifix up to balladphobia Be gone from this place foul spirit!!

**Luxaria** (10): Their vocals popped off! (Keisha in particular)

**Marvelous2002** (10): I WAS WAITING FOR THIS! Finally another 10. I remember discovering them in 2015 (I think that was thr year?) cause a guy sang this song in judges houses and I've been obsessed with this song ever since. That mv ending always annoys me, why did they not let the song end first lol

**MrSwearword** (10): the harmonies and "yass and slay" wardrobe in the airport for the video alone is why you see the score.

**throwaway-7650** (10): this would fit right in the futuristic R&B rate

**vivaforever597** (10): I'm so mad this was mostly excised from the US version of Love Actually in favor of a boring American Idol winner's ballad (even though the winner in question was Kelly Clarkson). It's a perfect 00s power ballad, and showcases all three women's voices perfectly.

**bbfan132** (9.5): this definitely sounds like a song that was made for talent shows but i still love it

**WaneY2UKtoc** (9.5): this is still really immaculate lovers rock [no i haven't heard that sade yet] love that they just strut down an airport terminal/baggage claim like they're flight on southwest didn't just get cance-wait what the fuck. omg this trio of ladies are literally SO ready to dominate any guy wow. um wow. what the fuck happened to videos n' shit like this for pop stars? Like i rlly hope they said "yeah we're down to do this" it just is so batshit pg-13 erotica but gotta salute the sugarbabes.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): maybe i woke up right i‚Äôm in my ballad mood

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The title is very accurate, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in this song! The production is so rich and immersive, and the babes give a very sensual performance (restrained, in a good way). Very mesmerizing.

**Melody** (9): a solid solid ballad... All Saints take notes.

**stbrigidiscross** (8.7): I love this one. The walking through an airport video where if you look closely they are very rarely in synch with each other, the verses are delivered beautifully and Keisha's "baby baby baybay" are all wonderful.

**1998tweety** (8.5): oh shes giving DRAMA

**BaconShoes** (8.5): I was humming along

**fadedblue09** (8.5): An improvement over the past songs, love the R&B-ish harmonies on this

**thegolding** (8): my girls can deliver a powe ballad

**daretheghost** (7.5): A handful of the ballads in this rate (Atomic Kitten) could benefit from the level of drama in this one.

**TiltControls** (7.5): I like the rockier elements on this one

**oscarbrierley1** (7): I love their vocals, but the production is a bit meh.

**Smuckles** (7): All Saints - Pure Shores

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): remember how i said i dont like girl group ballads? this one is an exception

**uberpigeon** (7): this is their Last Man On Earth

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): then find a map bestie

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): this is such a serve, from the commanding chorus to those cheeky little laughs perforating through. Such a confident bop that everyone hopefully love

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): One of my IRL friends got me into this song, and I do like it! I think my favorite formation is definitely Siobhan/Mutya/Keisha and then Mutya/Keisha/Heidi, so I‚Äôm ambivalent about Amelle‚Äôs presence here lol. If anything, I just love how front and center Keisha is throughout the song and music video. Queen!

**bbfan132** (8): good song!

**bogo** (8): sarah brand did it better

**fadedblue09** (8): funky feminist bop

**Melody** (8): thank you keisha

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I always thought it was "Cus I pulled up in the red dress" but I just saw the Spotify lyrics and they actually say "Cus I'm cooler in the red dress". Huh. Anyways this song slaps.

**qazz23** (8): better than Sarah Brand (original comment lololol)

**StarSquash45** (8): great melody

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): I thought it was either white gold or black blue

**Marvelous2002** (7.8): Omg this is a bigger bop than expected? I'm not sure any of them will ever want it but imagine if all 5 (6?) members of the Sugababes came together, that would be way too much too handle but I'd love to see it

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended Taylor Swift - Red and Taylor Swift - Dress

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): a bop, but a bit generic

**seanderlust** (4.5): sarah brand outsold

**Smuckles** (4): At some point Sugababes dropped off and certainly in the rate this feels like that moment. This song is pretty stock.

# Team Mutya

**cancersgroove** (0): im so sorry they were so boring after mother mutya left lmfao

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): I picked this one to show more early era Girls Aloud and not stuff their list with their 2006-2008 reign. I do like how this song both has the cool early 2000s electropop sound matched with the kitschy lyrics. Also I think a huge factor to why I love this song is Sarah‚Äôs ad-libs towards the end, just dopamine into my brain.

**flavasavavandal** (7): a really solid club banger but nothing about it really makes it pop other than the underwear line

---

# Showing their love and adoration

**Melody** (11): Now this song.. changed my life. The melodic drums, the electro chorus, the talk like vocals and everything about it. Sarah's ad-libs, the fun music video and the HEAVILY last chorus. It's pure pop perfection and perfectly captures the mid 00s aesthetic and feel. A TIMELESS CLASSIC.

**agentofscranton** (10): queens of rap frankly

**amr** (10): hit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): These girls are down bad.

**qazz23** (10): the electronic beats in this track are really good and well produced

**robincav** (10): Girls Aloud at their best when the lyrics mean nothing

**StarSquash45** (10): xenomania baybee!!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): so catchy omg

**vivaforever597** (10): Banger with probably their best video.

**BaconShoes** (9.5): a slay

**bbfan132** (9.5): the refrain combined with the production is heavenly

**Amazon4life** (9): The chorus could've been stronger, but otherwise a great song.

**throwaway-7650** (9): a bop but taking a point off for the underwear line

**TiltControls** (9): 2000's teen comedy core (complimentary)

**WaneY2UKtoc** (8.7): do you HEAR those rhymes?

**stbrigidiscross** (8.5): I really like the song and the salon themed video but it's not quite as essential as some of their other songs.

**cherryices** (8.2): truly some of the best instrumentals in pop‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

**daretheghost** (8): Really into the video game-y synth.

**kaanew** (8): you wouldn‚Äôt download a car but make it girl group

**oscarbrierley1** (8): the bridge really makes this song. The rest of it is good, but the way the bass intesifies and the song slows down is amazing for me.

**slimboyfriend** (8): Is that really how they pronounce ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù in England or did they do it for fun

**seanderlust** (7.3): they really said "maybe if I had done my makeup better my man wouldn't have left me"

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): I know it's technically Xenomania tradition to have an off-kilter song structure but it really is all over the place isn't it. Song's pretty good though!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): a little bland compared to some of their other singles but this is still fun

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): what show? omg rupauls drag race??? we should have a rate around that

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): the mixing was giving baby's first pro tools otherwise this was a bop

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this video is camp

**Marvelous2002** (6): The only one of theirs I haven't heard from this rate and I enjoy it more than their debut single, nicer soundscape and catchier imo

**MrSwearword** (6): it's high energy so that's cool but I'm not snatched by it.

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): Doesn't really have a climax but maybe thats the point

# People who should be shown the door

**akanewasright** (5.5): I‚Äôm honestly kinda baffled by this chorus‚Ä¶ like I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶

**BeauMeringue212** (5): this is like if Butlins made a pro abstinence song

**criestotheclicking** (5): I don't remember this song one bit.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I can‚Äôt form any opinion on this positive or negative

**Luxaria** (5): It's fine, not their most memorable song and a bit repetitive

**fadedblue09** (4.5): This feels very low quality

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): yeah this needed less repetition

**starla\_** (3): god this is so annoying

**moonagenightmares** (1): this felt like it lasted ages

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): THIS ALBUM IS SO GOOD!!! SIOBHAN‚ÄôS 2007 ALBUM GHOSTS!!! If you love Kate Bush and Tori Amos but also sometimes wanna be a basic folk pop girly this album is for YOU lmao And I admit that this is a huge outlier, but the mischief part of me knew I wanted to put the bizarre, backwards song in the bonus rate. The rest of the album is pretty regular.

**flavasavavandal** (9): what the fuck is this and why am i compelled not to tank it

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Let‚Äôs go weird Celtic atmospheric electropop!

**daretheghost** (10): This album was recommended to me ages ago and I remember being surprised to hear Siobhan was in a pop girl group. A really interesting album with some cool songs like this one.

**moonagenightmares** (10): this was the most interesting song of the entire rate

**nt96** (10): HEAD OVER TO INDIEHEADS AND DO THE TRIP HOP RATE NOW OR I WILL SEND THE GHOST OF RICO FUCKING SUAVE TO HAUNT YOU

**plastichaxan** (10): omg???? i wasnt expecting this sound in the rate at all lol i love this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this album is an underrated gem and this is one of the weirder songs on it (complimentary), Siobhan vs. Cocteau Twins vs. Kate Bush rate when

**thegolding** (10): I need to listen to this album fully because her style is so mind blowing and so radically different from her work in Sugababes. Just wow

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): Gotta concur with local DMD legend Smuckles here. totally would be pegged for a sacred bones reissue within a year or two

**bbfan132** (9): i love the production here, this song sounds super trippy

**cremeebrulee** (9): woah this is so eerie, i'm fucking with it

**qazz23** (9): beautiful and haunting

**starla\_** (8.5): this is actually really good?

**criestotheclicking** (8): this is way more avant-garde than i expected, pretty cool.

**seanderlust** (8): siobhan explaining the lyrics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eRRab36XLI

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): you know what i can appreciate the audacity

**BaconShoes** (7.5): this is really weird but cool?

**TiltControls** (7.5): I have no idea what's going on but this is good

**slimboyfriend** (7): bitches leave a girl group and suddenly turn into Enya

**Smuckles** (7): Off-kilter art pop! Have r/indieheads been made aware of this? If you snuck this into the middle of a Jenny Hval album do you think they'd notice?

**Marvelous2002** (6.6): Huh this is so interesting??? I don't think I get it on first listen and I definitely need to hear it more but it's definitely got me intrigued

**akanewasright** (6): I have no idea how to respond to this but it‚Äôs pretty

**celladonn** (6): this wasn't the sound I was expecting! I don't like it all that much but it is pretty cool

**kappyko** (6): noe venablesque

**TCHALLA1966** (6): right

**throwaway-7650** (6): this just sounds like microscopes and cobwebs

**welcome2thejam** (6): Need this energy to be dropped completely unchanged into like, Push the Button

**MrSwearword** (5): her vocals here are ghostlike in that I swear I hear something but nothing comes about

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): She thought she had the Tori Amos tea

**DirtyRat583** (4): a bjork reject

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): Well... It's a song!

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I would put this playlist on shuffle while driving and I almost crashed the company car several times trying to skip this

**Amazon4life** (1): Huh??

**RandomHypnotica** (1): kate bush if instead of art pop she made noise

**akanewasright** (10): I need Alesha Dixon to MC every songs ever made

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh doing this rate before the Labor Day weekend‚Ä¶this is hitting.

**fadedblue09** (10): Very smooth groovy chorus

**kappyko** (10): THATS MUSIC BABY

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is so summery and floaty and pretty

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): what‚Äôs a blacksmith rub

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): see unlike the saturflops, mis-teeq actually go to a REAL version of LA; its filled with low riders, strip malls, and basketball courts where black and brown sounds intermingle and straight up randomly go from one a-side to another. you literally learn why girls from the UK do it and how they do it and WHY its so important they go to LA to do it. yasss!

**BaconShoes** (9.5): this is a vibe i like it

**cancersgroove** (8.5): remix is 10 times better

**starla\_** (8.5): a cute bop

**TiltControls** (8.5): makes me want to take a spontaneous vacation

**1998tweety** (8): everyone in that one episode of fairly odd parents

**bbfan132** (8): :listening:

**criestotheclicking** (8): 7 honestly a pretty good mashup.

**daretheghost** (8): Something about this sounds so intensely familiar to me. It‚Äôs very much the vibe of the stuff I loved listening to growing up.

**frogaranaman** (8): I can't be the only one that hears Doja Cat (this is a positive)

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this would be a solid 10 if i was at a beach in 2004 while listening to this

**Melody** (8): so 90s I love it x

**qazz23** (8): love the vocals

**slimboyfriend** (8): I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôve heard this song before which is crazy because this didn‚Äôt chart at all in the US and I grew up in Minnesota

**Smuckles** (8): These slower chill songs are great! Perfect music for entering the club in slo-mo and everyone's dancing and smiling and you look real cool.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): VOTE FOR THE MASHUP MINIRATE!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the only place i see blacksmiths is in dnd so i‚Äôm taking this as a nerd anthem

**stbrigidiscross** (7): I really like this even if it's not the best they've recorded. The video with Alesha walking in the road while Sabrina follows in a car is objectively ridiculous but it's fun.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): smooth and vibey

**uberpigeon** (7): like... deoderant?

**agentofscranton** (6.5): it was at this point that I realised that alesha dixon and mark lee are the same person actually

**thegolding** (5): this one sounds a lot like All Saints

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.5): Not really feeling this one, but Alesha's rap is the best part (ofc it is).

**Awkward\_King** (3): this is like... fine

**MrSwearword** (3): absolutely not, this American makeover in the video was so wrong for this group

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): THE FUCKING SMASHA!!! Inject this song into my veinnsss. Sad to see The Saturdays leave and just miss Day 3, but glad to see this is their best-performing song. In a just world this would have gone #1 and not #3. It‚Äôs just the pinnacle of brain off and delicious oontz oontz music. It‚Äôs so driving and no filler throughout (or all-filler, tbh, but just Grade A filler imo) Goodbye Sats, hope you enjoy your inevitable reunion run in 2027 xo

**flavasavavandal** (2): this is like On The Metro but bad and less creativity, and On The Metro was already towing the line there

Idc it's getting my 11, didn't expect this woah. Wait MNEK apparently produced this? No wonder I love this so much, he's worked with LM a lot

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): This song is poppers from beginning to end. It‚Äôs gotta be the Bad Romance in the UK, like I just know the gays over there start gay screaming whenever this song comes on

**Melody** (10): now where do I start.. MNEK was only 16 when he produced this BANGER, the climax, the vocals.. THE DYNAMICS??? VANESSA SLAYING THE VOCALS! They were really Fired Up that day.. they never topped this sadly x

**nt96** (10): oh yes DEVOUR ME AND LEAVE NO CRUMB BEHIND

**plastichaxan** (10): that edge of desire section of the song holy shit

**robincav** (10): This may be delusional but it was my favourite song as a child so

**seanderlust** (10): 2011 david guetta core (complimentary)

**throwaway-7650** (10): this would slay on the shake it up soundtrack

**thedoublebanana** (9.5): The saturdays really deserve more credit.

**1998tweety** (9): me when I hear this song

**oscarbrierley1** (9): autotune bop slay

**qazz23** (9): lives up to its title

**Stryxen** (9): this is like a volta track

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this is the most eurovision song to ever eurovision

**thedoctordances1940** (9): this is so generic but also like the best sound ever

**welcome2thejam** (9): Heard "animal-mal-mal" and had to pause, I can't let myself be dragged there again

**starla\_** (8.5): okay this slaps

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): me getting up at 5am for day 3 of a reveal

**akanewasright** (8): I keep thinking this is a girls aloud song, which is honestly a massive compliment HSHDJJD

**CrimsonROSET** (8): eurovision bait (compliment)

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): there's something addicting about how the lead synth keeps ending on a low note instead of just hammering C#-D#-E over and over.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): This I can get on board with

**thegolding** (8): this makes me feel like i'm dancing at some club which is interesting since they don't play these bops where I'm from

**BaconShoes** (7.5): It‚Äôs almost great, but it‚Äôs like it builds up and then doesn‚Äôt pack the punch I want it to

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It‚Äôs so aggressively 2011 you know what I have to respect it.

**daretheghost** (7): Goes off but maybe too repetitive :(

**frogaranaman** (7): drag race type beat

**MrSwearword** (7): this is dated music for a very specific gay club in London. Which one, take a guess.

**TiltControls** (7): I'm half fired up after this. Maybe 3/4ths

**TheQueenofVultures** (6.5): Kesha reject, but she only makes bangers so its ok

**criestotheclicking** (6): nary a notable verse from the girlies unfortunately

**Smuckles** (6): You can have some points because this reminded me of uni, even if it feels a bit limp. This song stinks of vodka red bulls to me.

# All iced off

**bbfan132** (5.5): i like parts of this but then other parts sound like a mess

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): Kinda wish there was a stronger hook on this one. I'm sure the instrumental would go off at a club though.

**fadedblue09** (5): Overproduced and repetitive

**Luxaria** (5): The clear Girls Aloud reject T.T

**WaneY2UKtoc** (4.5): this may have been good in 50 shades of grey but its hard to tell. especially since the weeknd logged on and gave us an academy award nominated bop

**Awkward\_King** (4): do i hate this? no but is it giving anything at all? no

**Amazon4life** (1): Sounds like a Kesha reject.

**celladonn** (0): this is sooo generic omg. A dance banger should not feel this lifeless and dull

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): All of these Saturdays songs are low-key soulless radio pop riding on the sonic trends of the era, but at least the other ones had the decency to sound good. This is just noise.

**slimboyfriend** (0): This is so faceless

# This person was the last ballot and knocked The Saturdays back into their day or not all heroes wear capes - flav

**kappyko** (2): This is so emotionless for me

**StarSquash45** (9.022): more like the saturslays

**OliviaGodrigo** (9.000): The world went to shit after they went on hiatus

**agentofscranton** (8.944): the sats were around for the last two years of primary school through to the end of high school so of all the girls here they're the ones i've got the most nostalgia for (hence my probably way too high scores)

**moooo566** (8.778): this is one of those groups where i always think i know all their best stuff and then i hear a banger and i look it up and its yet another saturdays track. should've given them a whole rate to themselves tbh.

**MassiveThief** (8.722): By far my favorite of the groups in this rate

**DirtyRat583** (8.689): they are the prime example of "there is no slay without flop". they flopped with notorious and slayed after that

**throwaway-7650** (8.656): they better not be the group w/ the lowest average [2]

**plastichaxan** (8.589): I thought for a second they'd end up with my highest average but they just really ATE, I didn't see it at first but now they got second favorite wow what a moment

**Marvelous2002** (8.333): Generic at times but they're still one of my faves on here, I'm the most familiar with them since they were still releasing music and charting by the time I got into girl groups. Another group where the 'main vocalist' was pushed too much, the main vocalists are often my faves but I still dislike when they're the front and centre 80% of the time

**thegolding** (8.222): 8

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.156): I understand why they were included but they‚Äôre so 2010s-core for this 2000s-based rate

**qazz23** (8.000): I think I prefer The Sundays (lolol) // this was mostly good but too polished at times

**vayyiqra** (7.778): idk what to say anymore I'm just filling out these comments on each group instead of doing comments for each song because I'm so tired. I meant to do this rate over the last week but turned out to be busy and it kept getting away from me. Then I had to work three night shifts including two in a row this weekend so was just not mentally ready to write out a full ballot with solid comments. Also one of my family members is dying so that's on my mind as well. Sorry this ballot is so mediocre, I wanted it to be good and support your rate but this is the best I can do right now and I should be asleep anyway. Please take it as it is. oh yeah and this group is pretty alright

**Olivier77777** (7.611): 8

**RandomHypnotica** (7.556): definitely the most questionable, and most dated sounding of all the groups... idk what was happening here

**robincav** (7.389): Tacky as hell but I love them dearly

**cremeebrulee** (7.356): 2010s pop rap core

**welcome2thejam** (7.333): Fun, dumb pop in that late 00s/early 10s way. Super disposable, but generally you'll have a good time when these come on

**oscarbrierley1** (7.278): this is a pretty good representation of the best of the Saturdays. The only songs that I would add would be 'if this is love' and 'work'

**apatel27** (7.278): Much more hit or miss compared to the other groups

**raggedy-princess** (7.222): I miss EMD

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.056): more like the slayturdays lolol

**nt96** (7.033): 7.03

**daretheghost** (6.944): The only song I was familiar with before this rate was ‚ÄúForever Is Over‚Äù which I liked well enough, but not so much that I really cared to check out their other songs. But they‚Äôre pretty good!

**Melody** (6.889): 6.9

**akanewasright** (6.833): this is kinda the most ‚Äúmeh‚Äù group of the bunch to me, like they‚Äôre talented and they have good songs (as well as some bad ones), but I don‚Äôt think they have any solid identity

**criestotheclicking** (6.667): how dare you not include the cgi masterpiece that is ‚ÄúUp‚Äù

**sarcasticsobs** (6.544): Very ‚Äúof their time‚Äù, aren‚Äôt they? Just an observation

**thedoctordances1940** (6.544): even though i would've definitely been like aware of them when they were around and i was definitely old enough, i don't really remember much of them and I think they maybe just came a bit late to the party

**TiltControls** (6.111): The Saturdays seem like they just absorb whatever trends are popular that year. Sometimes it works. and sometimes it really doesn't

**fadedblue09** (5.556): Interesting how  the youngest group on the list has the most dated sounding stuff.

**Luxaria** (5.111): The most "5 dollars and a dream" group ever to exist

**slimboyfriend** (5.056): I can‚Äôt tell who their target demographic is, but it‚Äôs definitely not me. They‚Äôre like if the Pussycat Dolls came up in the early 2010s without a Nicole Scherzinger

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.933): Most of their songs (at least the ones chosen in this rate) are very dated but hey, at least I enjoyed them. Also I wish their Depeche Mode cover was on here, I could've easily given that an 8.

**WaneY2UKtoc** (4.678): probably not as good as mezzanine if im being honest

**Amazon4life** (3.889): Basically a poor man's Girls Aloud. They always seemed so faceless, just like Fifth Harmony.

**Smuckles** (3.778): I've wrestling with my emotions towards this act and why I don't think they can stand up to most of the others in this rate. Half of it is because I simply just don't think many of these songs are that good. Lots of attempts at dancefloor fillers that feel limp and fairly soulless. Some of it if I'm being very honest though is because The Saturdays came in just after I was in my 'era', the point where I was showing interest in what was in the charts. That interest has waned off over the years mostly as a result of listening to more and more genres overall. Maybe if I was more of a pophead later on where the lines between pop and dance were merging like they are here they'd have had a better chance.

**flavasavavandal** (8): when the song sucks but still bops hard

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): I‚Äôm not mad at the current score I gave this; on good days, this hovers around the 7 or 8 mark for me, but man I just don‚Äôt see the undying love for this one. The nonsense lyrics I tend to love grate on my ears (especially the unforgivable ‚Äútoot toot‚Äù and bum-snatching choreography in the music video), the song itself skirting on the edge of generic dance banger without the left-field flair typical to Girls Aloud. Sexy! No No No is the improvement and I will die on this hill.

---

# Oooh :eyes:

**DirtyRat583** (11): OH! YEAH!

**agentofscranton** (10): legitimately some of the greatest verses in pop music history

**Amazon4life** (10): I used to hate it back when it came out, but I came to realize it's amazing.

**BaconShoes** (10): Xenomania & Girls Aloud just slays so much like it‚Äôs insane

**bbfan132** (10): this sounds like the future

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is REAL lyricism.

**cremeebrulee** (10): it reminds me a lot of thee best song of all time, i love it by icona pop

**daretheghost** (10): This song goes from 0 to 120 in 15 seconds and barely lets up.

**qazz23** (10): the synths and hook are really good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): rina was VERY influenced by this when making the CSS video huh

**thedoublebanana** (10): it took me so long to realize it's "got to got to heat it up" instead of "doctor doctor"

**throwaway-7650** (10): something kinda ou - ppl tanking this

**1998tweety** (9): step on my tutu, you need to calm down

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): the hook makes no sense but i love it

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Hold on hold on hold on‚Ä¶ my ass is quaking

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): the very definition of CUNT [non-derogatory]

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): stream vrooh vrooh

**WaneY2UKtoc** (9): fast and furious UK core

**Stryxen** (8.7): pure camp truly

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): trash!!! but beautiful trash

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): the emotional depth in the lyrics always hits me

**Marvelous2002** (8): My fave of theirs so far, this is when they start sounding nostalgic (in a good way, like early Gaga and Katy) for me

**plastichaxan** (8): i shouldn‚Äôt have heard the mashup with vroom vroom before but still camp

**seanderlust** (8): "Something kinda ooh/jumping on my tutu" hello and welcome back to america's favorite game show, Is It Bad Or Is It Camp?

**slimboyfriend** (8): This is like those nonsensical songs written as a parody for a tv show/movie that actually kind of bang (ex: Why Did You Do That, On A Roll, etc.)

**starla\_** (8): camp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): put me in the camp section

**uberpigeon** (8): so relatable i hate when something kind of ooh is jumping on my tutu

**apatel27** (7.5): X Factor opening music

**DaHumanTorch** (7.3): ou ou

**ImADudeDuh** (7): how often do these women wear tutus

**Luxaria** (7): see previous comment about horniness in Girls Aloud songs

**Melody** (7): very high energy but compared to their other songs its not on par.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): What a banger.

**stbrigidiscross** (7): It saved their career along with the greatest hits and while I do really enjoy it and it's really cheap video it's not a favourite of mine. I usually like stupid spoken word parts but I don't really like the kink in your steel part, Sorry Kim.

**TiltControls** (7): These lyrics feel like gibberish (but it doesn't really matter much)

**StarSquash45** (6.5): chorus slays but the verses are mixed

**kappyko** (6): Something Kinda Poop

**Smuckles** (6): Trashy (Complimentary)

**welcome2thejam** (6): This instrumental feels straight out of a generic racing game main menu

**MrSwearword** (5): the production again goes hard but the gherls just do not deliver the vocals here.

**frogaranaman** (3): this was fun for like one chorus

**akanewasright** (1): This is‚Ä¶ not written for these voices in a way that most of the GA songs are

**amr** (1): I hate any sort of onomatopoeia that is potty adjacent like OMGGG makes me wanna rip my hair out. sorry. doesn't help that they say it so many times too

**a-man-with-a-perm** (0): they really wanted to keep that tutu line in there and build an entirely awful chorus around it

**TCHALLA1966** (0): I am very tired of this song fr

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Now that I think about it, following up the smash hit of Scandalous with a Blaque cover song seems pretty random. Also their very last single ‚ÄúStyle‚Äù isn‚Äôt very good. MIS-TEEQ WE WANT THE REUNION PLEASE HOP ON A SONG WITH SHYGIRL, PINKTHANTHERESS, BREE RUNW-

---

# Trying to get Mis-Teeq back together

**MrSwearword** (10): mainly because the video is so kii inducing.

**throwaway-7650** (10): we love destiny's child!

**WaneY2UKtoc** (10): ugh not sure how even with low quality videos mis-teeq's majesty legit GETS through. even if we're out of UK garage a bit, these fellas rlly do be understanding and self-actualizing through these cuts

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): Pique facetiming Shakira holding her Grammys

**DirtyRat583** (9.5): sounds like something off In The Zone if it was better

**1998tweety** (9): me with my copy of Super Mario Galaxy for 4 months when I lent it to someone in my class

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): The Timbaland-lite production will never not be good for me! Produced by Salaam Remi tho who is equally iconic

**TiltControls** (9): I don't need my time back after listening to this fantastic track

**oscarbrierley1** (8.7): another song with a smash of a rap verse. This song has a weird history. The non remix version was recorded by american girl group blaque, but flopped so hard their album was cancelled, so it was given to mis teeq. However the better known version for both bands is their respective Remixes. trackmasters for blaque (it's the version that was put on streaming with their album years after it was supposed to be released) and ignorants for mis teeq (it's the version in the music video)

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is so 2001/2002 in a good way

**cancersgroove** (8): POP EXCELLENCE..

**Melody** (8): this being their 2nd to last single hurts so much. They were so talented was mistreated hugely by the british music industry in the early 00s. I'm happy black british female groups and acts are striving again ‚ù§

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I had NO idea this was a cover until I looked up the wikipedia page for it. Great song, don't like Alesha's rap in this one though.

**qazz23** (8): i like the rap verse

**Smuckles** (8): Remember when Justin Timberlake heard this song and decided he'd steal it and base his entire career off of it? Dude should be in jail. (Editors note: I am joking about this. Like, half joking.)

**Stryxen** (8): this works really well as the closer for misteeq in the playlist lol. I KNEW this was gonna be the album closer

**BaconShoes** (7.5): a fun song, very y2k vibes

**seanderlust** (7.5): did she just steal his ring? i live tbh

**starla\_** (7.5): a catchy bop

**criestotheclicking** (7): I live for a good courtroom MV

**daretheghost** (7): A little 2000s-by-the-numbers for me, especially in light of their other songs.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Not bad but kinda an underwhelming note to end this string of slayage on.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this kinda has cheetah girls vibes

**TCHALLA1966** (7): cute

**Marvelous2002** (6.7): Their later releases were going a good direction for me... and then we're done ):

# Get back to day 2

**CrimsonROSET** (6): me when i leave a book in the library and i have no proof its mine

**Amazon4life** (5): They were really the UK Destiny's Child, huh?

**hoolytoledo** (5): can‚Äôt nobody love you like I love you

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Took off points when this songs started sounding bad and they can‚Äôt get them back.

**stbrigidiscross** (4): I think this just a bad song, they do their best to make it work but it's just not up to their usual standards. The version by Blaque is similarly lacklustre so I think there's something about the song that just doesn't work.

vch01: I was surprised how badly their music has aged for me in general, compared to all the other artists in this rate. I definitely remember liking them much more back in the day. The only tune I genuinely enjoyed revisiting from the selection was Roll On, and that one has already been voted out. I guess you can't hate Scandalous either, but everything else was...eeeeeehhhhh

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): if S-Club 7 did this song it would be a 10

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): I mysteriously have 18 scrobbles of this song but can barely remember the times I‚Äôve listened to this song all the way through (outside of rate-hosting, of course). I think I like the idea of it and respect the zaniness of it more than I sit down and listen to it. I‚Äôm not alone in this, as the girls themselves hated this song and didn‚Äôt want to do it lmao. But it peaked at #2 in the charts and proved that the Brits and some popheads (but not enough to make Day 3) love a bit of cheeky camp.

**apatel27** (10): Want a drill remix of this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We had a love machine store just outsold my hometown. My parents donated money to put up a Jesus Hates Porn sign next to it.

**DirtyRat583** (10): pussy power at its strongest

**Luxaria** (10): I'm sorry but can we say iconique? I will know every word of this song on my death bed and I love how unabashedly horny their lyrics were

**moooo566** (10): there was a guy at school who used to play this on loop from his phone speakers (not to be all "in my day" but holy shit people complaining about phone speakers now don't know how good they have it) from the back seat of the bus on every trip and its a real testament to its quality that despite that, i still fucking lvoe it

**vivaforever597** (10): This is summer in a song.

**WaneY2UKtoc** (9.3): genius maverick energy

**akanewasright** (9): Her (2013)

**Amazon4life** (9): The lyrics are kinda cringy, but the song is still a bop.

**Awkward\_King** (9): capitalism is bad

**BaconShoes** (9): infectious energy

**celladonn** (9): this is bopping

**CrimsonROSET** (9): give me ALL the kisses

**ImADudeDuh** (9): how did the girls aloud stans know who was singing what part in this song without color coded lyric videos?

**MassiveThief** (9): makes me wanna run outside and dance in the street

**mysario** (9): pop-rockabilly core

**nt96** (9): oh I'm loving this jovial energy!

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Edgar Allen Poe and Emily Dickinson could never write this well

**qazz23** (9): love this dancey sound

**RandomHypnotica** (9): are love machine's really waterproof? Idk I just doubt the claims of being able to breathe underwater‚Ä¶ why does a machine even need to breathe??? Something isn't adding up here‚Ä¶

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Girls Aloud would have bodied I Bet that You Look Good on the Dancefloor, just saying

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): darj told me this song sounds like a uk eurovision song, but i have to strongly disagree with that, because uk eurovision songs all sound like shit instead of being a banger like this one

**welcome2thejam** (9): Mathematicians Aloud would have sang "easy as Pi" and "give me a kiss or 3.1415926535..."

**dream\_fighter2018** (8.5): the second best song by a girl group called Love Machine, still a good song

**bbfan132** (8): super fun, sounds like commercial/advert music but in a good way

**Melody** (8): she's so cheeky I love her x

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): yee-haw bitches

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Hootin‚Äô and hollerin‚Äô

**StarSquash45** (8): would be a 10 but i'm pretty sure "eskimo" is considered a slur üò∂

**Stryxen** (8): the drop into that chorus omfg I remember when this was released and hearing stadiums erupt into hours of uninterrupted applause

**TiltControls** (8): This feels countrified for some reason. And it works?

**1998tweety** (7.5): this has a "back to school The Gap/Old Navy sale ad" vibe to it

**stbrigidiscross** (7.5): It's crazy and wonderful and I love the "What will the neighbours say?" and "Let's go eskimo" lines but I rarely feel a need to revisit it.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): happiest song of all time

**seanderlust** (7.2): "so don't break the law" what are you, a cop?

**daretheghost** (7): An alright song, if not particularly innovative.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Starts off kinda weird but eventually I figure it out and it‚Äôs pretty cute then

**slimboyfriend** (7): Definitely sounds like it could be in a Kohl‚Äôs commercial, but I love those vibes!

**Smuckles** (7): Look, I'm not going to tell you that I'm blasting Love Machine as a part of my normal listening habits. I'm not going to tell you that this is a bad song either.

**TCHALLA1966** (7): throwback to BBC for overplaying this

**oscarbrierley1** (6.8): my least favourite of the girls aloud songs here, but its still a bop. I think it's slightly too camp in the wrong direction for me.

**criestotheclicking** (6): that opening riff just reminds me of all the adverts it‚Äôs been in

**fadedblue09** (6): it feels like the "Biology" template at some points

**kaanew** (6): uk girl group line dance song??

**throwaway-7650** (6): well. this grew off me on relisten unfortunately

**frogaranaman** (5): this gives camp (like the one with counselors) energy

**Marvelous2002** (5): Fun but a lot more dated than I remember. Also the choreo is something, really fits the song though

**plastichaxan** (5): they‚Äôre kinda silly for this

**starla\_** (5): this is kinda cute, retro vibes

**uberpigeon** (5): i think this was on too many ads or something its triggering something in my brain

**indie\_fan\_** (2): one of the most unpleasant 2000‚Äôs hooks I‚Äôve heard

**MrSwearword** (2): an effort was made but not necessarily a good one
