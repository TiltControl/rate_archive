2000's Pop&B Perfection Rate (Usher/Justin Timberlake/Ne-Yo)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/zbptby/2000s_popb_perfection_rate_usherjustin/

**SUBMISSION WINDOW NOW OFFICIALLY CLOSED**

The century shift of R&B in the mainstream was rather interesting back then. Both in terms of the sound as well as how it was presented. Some stars were able to transition flawlessly into the next decade while new figures of the scene came up to drop some of the most predominant songs of their time. That style and sound is exactly what 2000's Pop&B Perfection (or shorthand Pop&B) will cover to represent what exactly was going on in the R&B scene. I am very glad to not only be cohosting with dope ass rater u/jackisboredtoday, but also have this be my very first time as rate host as we bring to you these three widely discussed albums from the 2000's and see which one comes out on top.

Shaffer Smith has been part of a number of hits behind the scenes.  Beyoncé's "Irreplaceable", Rihanna's "Take a Bow", Mario's "Let Me Love You", and several others. However, that does not dismiss the fact that he was doing a bit of work for himself as well, not to mention quite a bit of classic songs of his own. That itself is more than apparent with his third studio album titled *Year of the Gentleman*. Presenting the persona of a man that is "calm, courteous, kind, charming" in Ne-Yo's own words, the singer wished to throw it back to a 1960's style and bring it to the 2000's. Kicking off this era with the upbeat lead single "Closer", the song shot to the charts in multiple countries and presented a change in sound for the artist in comparison to his past work. Of course, that was far from it as the follow-up "Miss Independent" which leaned back into his material prior to "Closer" as it reached the top 10 on the Hot 100. The album peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200 and is currently his most commercially successful album, including having several gold and platinum certifications. The album received his most positive reception from critics at the time as well as a total of six Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year. Many praised Ne-Yo's grown and confident sound that he portrayed on the record, defining it as a standout body of work for him and once-again proving that he can be just as successful in the spotlight as he is while working in the background.

# [Usher - Confessions](https://youtu.be/sGFyQsJZ4Es)

Usher was already making a name for himself in the late 90's. With singles such as "You Make Me Wanna..." and "U Got It Bad", He was becoming the next big sex symbol in R&B. However, it was his follow-up to his third album *8701* that he established himself as one of the most significant R&B figures in the 2000's. In early 2003, Usher and Chilli from TLC split after a two-year relationship, causing many rumors to start. One of the main ones were people speculating that Usher must have cheated in the relationship. This did little - if at all - to deter Usher's popularity. In fact, it's seemed to have only boosted his stardom as he released his fourth studio album titled *Confessions*. As much as a lot of artists like to tag on that "most personal record yet" tag whenever they release a new album, *Confessions* is very much an album where that tag is justified. With iconic producer Jermaine Dupri being the main producer behind this album, Usher took this time to not only prove himself as a very capable vocalist, but also share intimate, personal stories of his own as well as storied inspired by his own friends lives. A myriad of classic R&B/Pop songs were born from this one album. From the heartfelt and charming duet "My Boo" with Alicia Keys to the intimate and vulnerable song "Confessions Part II". Of course we can't forget about the ultimate club banger "Yeah!" which shot to #1 on the Hot 100, staying on the top spot for a total of twelve weeks. *Confessions* had a total of 4 #1 singles and is certified Diamond, making it his most successful album. All in all, Usher far from experienced the "Fourth Album Curse". On the contrary, it may very well be Usher in his prime.

# [Justin Timberlake -  FutureSex/LoveSounds](https://youtu.be/pD_9NApaiSM)

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2scB1uhcCI1TSf6b9TCZK3?si=5Wp_B7d1RTWtpS2dsYEVRg) | [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/futuresex-lovesounds/187665948) | [Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/album/512746)

Think back with me if you will, to the mid-2000s, a time before Justin Timberlake had lost every last bit of his cool, in part because he hadn’t finished getting it in the first place yet. Justin Timberlake had already established his name as a solo artist in 2002 with his debut album Justified, working with collaborators like The Neptunes and Timbaland who had reshaped the entire mainstream in order to craft a sound for himself by pairing his voice with the Neptunes’ signature future funk (originally intended for Michael Jackson) and Timbaland’s revolutionary drums. For his return to the music scene four years later, however, he wanted to declare pop supremacy, and he reunited with Timbaland and his new protege Danja to move his sound in a sleek, more dance-oriented direction. Lead single SexyBack was a statement of intent, a hard-hitting club track which nearly abandons the normal pop structure of the day an attempt to chase anthem status, and whose titular lyric became a phrase that people still reference today. Once the full album dropped, it featured lots of Timbaland production that moved his sound ever closer to dance music, as well as work from fellow superproducers Rick Rubin & [will.i.am](https://will.i.am), as well as features from Three-6 Mafia & T.I. (as well as Beyoncé on the eventual deluxe edition). Upon release, the record courted critical acclaim too, with a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year and second single “My Love” even being declared Pitchfork’s #1 song of the year in an era when that wasn’t common for pop singles. Once it was all said and done, the era had spun off six top 20 singles, three of which went all the way to #1, marking a hot streak that essentially was his imperial phase within pop music, supplementing the massive success of this album’s singles with a bevy of features and writing credits on hits as he became the prototypical male pop star for a wave of singers who would follow during his next extended gap between albums.

* **You must listen to and score every song in the main rate.** Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.
* **Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10** and can include one decimal place but no more. So 8.2 is fine but 8.25 is not.
* **You may give one song in the whole main rate a score of 11 and one other a score of 0** so, if you want to award these scores, save them for your favourite and least favourite songs in the rate respectively.
* **We encourage you to leave comments** of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, **they must be in this format**, simply leaving one space after your score:

>Red Light: 7 Green Light

Any other format such as:

>What Goes Around... / ...Comes Around (Interlude): Invented Karma (10)  
>  
>Lie To Me: 4: Okay. This song is winning this rate.

* If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole they must be formatted like this, leaving colon then a space after the album title, for example:

>Album: Confessions: \[comment here\]

* **DO NOT SABOTAGE** the rate by giving outrageously low/high scores for the sole purpose of skewing the results, we reserve the right to exclude any ballot we suspect of this. If you're worried your scores could be mistakenly perceived as such, all you need to do is leave comments explaining the reasoning behind them. (*Leaving comments for your 11 and 0 are HIGHLY encouraged!*)
