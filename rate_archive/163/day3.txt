jackisboredtoday: How are we feeling heading into day 3? What are everyone's winner predictions? Any surprises you think might be coming today?

=====

Frajer: Yeah vs Closer for number one seems most likely but Burn, Caught Up, Confessions Part 2 and What Goes Around Comes Around are all strong contenders

Surprise would be My Boo and/or Miss Independent being criminally underrated

edit being right about My Boo, Miss Independent, and Sexy Back brings me no joy

=====

sweetnsoursauce11: Honestly besides Bad Girl getting out yesterday I’m happy with this Day 3! (Said no one ever in a rate) 

My prediction is Yeah! Will take out first place, and the rest of the top 5 will be Lovestoned, What Goes Around, Closer, Confessions Part 2 and My Love

**indie\_fan\_** (9.4): For this to be Ne-Yo's highest ranking deep cut makes sense. I don't see that much MJ flair that a good amount of the comments claimed here, but it still makes sense to see how he was influenced by Michael.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): We open day 3 with the last remaining Ne-Yo deep cut, and I'm actually just happy to see all three artists got one deep cut onto day 3 given how the singles from these albums are so iconic. Completely makes sense why this one is the one that made it for Ne-Yo since it's A. one of the stronger ones and B. the only deep cut that's truly uptempo will likely do best in the popheads rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): kinda outsold Mitski

**noavocadoshere** (10): oh lord, what did i sign up for? pop&b perfection is the correct title for this rate, this is gonna be EXTREMELY hard. this is so smooth. 2/2 back to back so far for yotg.

**nt96** (10): Mitski found bald and dead I kidnapped her and stuffed her in the trunk of my Mitsubishi and dumped her in the crusty ass ditch of a mother lake she failed to create.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I was gonna do like a 'neyo could do but could miski do ' joke but I think mitski could a club banger if she decided she wanted to do one

**seanderlust** (10): "hey pretty mama what's the deal with you tonight" - jerry seinfeld to airline food

**thestoryteller13** (10): CMON melodies!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): a rave.dj with this/about damn time... I see, no I HEAR the vision.

**1998tweety** (9.5): ended those fad Wonder Girls

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): my headcanon is this song is about Beyoncé

**fadedblue09** (9): fun, bouncy number

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Binaural synths is cheating

**Stryxen** (9): smash but the drop is a Kylie minogue unstoppable rip off

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): no one ever:

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I miss the golden days of r&b

**welcome2thejam** (9): Can't enjoy this as much as I'd like since repeated & successive uses of "nobody" triggers my Goofy floating lifelessly in a fountain to Mitski reflex

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8.5): I'm in the club transcending.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): will we go a month without rating a song about cocaine

**daythreeinmiami** (8): This is the song I will be playing in my head when I go out on the town and channel my main character vibes.

**Dragusken** (8): Sounds pretty nice for the chorus but felt like the verses were a bit underwhelming when put with the intensity of the backing instrumentals.

**jaztinax** (8): it’s giving target michael jackson but in a good way

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): it's hard to follow up Closer on the track-list but neyo did it successfully

**MassiveThief** (7.5): holy MJ worship

**TiltControls** (7.5): Really fantastic production here

**heysoupie** (7.2): I would love to hear this song while shopping with my Mom at Kohl’s

**IIIHenryIII** (7): he can emulate Michael's voice very well, I'll give him that

**plastichaxan** (7): Can’t believe this inspired Mitski omg ?????

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): definitely sounds bruno mars-esque

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.5): she hit the floor??? Did shawty get low low low???

**theonewithoutmynudes** (5): regular degular… this is what I remember most of neyo’s discography sounding like

**timothy444** (5): boring, generic, and might as well have been made by an algorithm. Also, I saw a YouTube comment saying this had "Michael Jackson" vibes which made me laugh in disbelief.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): This is just perfection to me with the synths, one of the stickiest hooks of the whole rate and an all-around classic. I had a pair of other 11 contenders too, but I often like to pick an 11 that I think could use the help and well… the others I was thinking about were always gonna need it less. Just glad this at least made Day 3

**indie\_fan\_** (9.5): This track's also a fun ass song. Didn't think it would be this high, but even so it's still well deserved. For it to be more controversial songs here is a bit unexpected as I mostly assumed most people more or less in the same boat that it would be good, but not necessarily great

**daythreeinmiami** (11): Anyone who gives this a 0 is cancelled I’m sorry I don’t make the rules. Anyone who gives this below an 8 CLEARLY doesn’t understand how they got that pretty little face on that pretty little frame.

**Bordersz** (10): I remember I had an illegal pirate rip of 1D's Take Me Home and this Summer Love was on it and my family was convinced 1D was Justin Timberlake lmao.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): his best song but people aren’t ready for this conversation

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the bridge of this is lowkey one of the best parts of the whole rate

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): i was so close to giving this my 11 i could listen to this every day for the rest of my life and still not get sick of it

**sarcasticsobs** (10): something something something… GIRL

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song deserves more love!!

**timothy444** (10): Sexy af

**CrimsonROSET** (9): WITH YOU

**TiltControls** (9): only for the southern hemisphere. for the rest of us its winter love right now

**heysoupie** (8.7): not sure why this song didn’t become a massive single like SexyBack - I think its a better fit with JT’s discography/vibe. Maybe that’s why.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.5): fun and breezy

**1998tweety** (8): ended Rita Ora

**Dragusken** (8): Sounds cringy but, hey, at least it can it's boyband-esque. In all seriousness though, this is one of the songs I like more from this album.

**plastichaxan** (8): Set the Mood not being paired with this as it was in the album helping this get a higher score omg

**impla77** (7.9): this man really wants to give rings to every woman he sees

**jsonphile** (7.5): John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John outsold

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (7.5): a nice cruise control bop

**akanewasright** (7): I hated this the first time I heard it, and while I recognize it’s not bad, I still have vaguely negative feelings from my first listen through

**DirtyRat583** (7): this was so boring i completely forgot i was rating until the next song

**noavocadoshere** (7): huh. this used to be my favorite off of this album. idk what happened.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): when you're in a long distance relationship with someone in the opposite hemisphere

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The way he oscillates between cool and cringe so easily is fascinating

**Frajer** (6): in his Drake era

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I vaguely remember these synths used as like opening instrumentals of 2000s reality shows on VH1 lolol

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): the way he keeps saying girl after every single line makes me think that he’s trying his absolute hardest to make sure it’s literally impossible to interpret this song in a nonheterosexual way

**welcome2thejam** (4): You really gonna spit bars on the phone with your girl the whole night Justin? Really?

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): this Crazy In Love knockoff

(2.5 x1) xophrys

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Dope that this was able to make it to day 3. It's a rather solid deep cut + opener and I wouldn't have been too mad if this was made a single.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): a deep cut that actually hit the bubbling under in a pre-album bomb age is wildly impressive in terms of showing just how huge this album was at the time, and this song *mostly* earns the hype. It's definitely the deep cut that feels most in-line with the singles of the album when it comes to production, a solid enough track that I can see why it was the best-performing JT deep cut

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’m sad that “Year of the Gentleman” does not have at title track. That’s honestly the one I’d be most curious to hear.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): he’s just saying words but they’re in a bop order

**jaztinax** (10): i rarely listen to this and i’m not sure why… it slaps so hard

**noavocadoshere** (10): both the most stereotypical and the most quintessential aquarius song if there ever was one. great opener.

**throwaway-7650** (10): is it bad if I say this could fit right in on blackout

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (10): He came out the gate with the most unsexy force commando thrust ditty that WORKED. The way those synths go low-low-low on the chorus makes me

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): a great intro to the album.

**thestoryteller13** (9.5): Well deserving of the first track. Always been a guilty pleasure for me. CMON BRIDGE!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is extra carried by Timbaland’s production but I love his chorus on here

**seanderlust** (9): why is JT calling himself daddy and why do i kind of like it :didntseethat:

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): sex(y) counter: 7

**welcome2thejam** (9): You know what, this grew on me. I appreciate how just weird this sounds compared to the other two. Don't know if it will last, but I'm willing to give Future Justin a fair shot

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): it does sound like future sex love sounds

**MassiveThief** (8.5): had to grow on me, this is a cool intro

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): how good are all the openers in this rate

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): i hate it when straight guys call themselves daddy

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): its fine but it also just feels like a watered down version of better songs to come

**1998tweety** (8): the album opens and so do my legs

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i had a comment about jt calling himself ‘daddy’ but as the song went on i think that’d be the least of her issues

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): I need Justin to never say “daddy” again

**Roxieloxie** (8): my leg is shaking, im trying to kill the groove but i fear its spreading. nevermind he just said daddy and everything in me stopped im lowering my score again

**TiltControls** (8): only one lovesound? what happened to the rest?

**timothy444** (8): Right off the back, we're introduced to a song that offers to subtleity to what Justin is wanting to do to the average female listener which honestly, is quite based at the time to be so explicit. This basically highlighted Justin's desire to have his entire album be played whenever an orgy is happening and it flows right well into the next song in terms of transitions.

**emayzee** (7.6): this sounds so much like that one song of his where he played steve jobs in the music video

**akanewasright** (7.5): I need to take this man’s pen away from him

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): Another One Bites The Dust Who?

**DirtyRat583** (7.5): grating intro into an amazing song... i remember i was conflicted

**impla77** (7.5): Points off for calling yourself daddy

**PinkCadillacs** (7.3): I really like this song. I think it’s underrated.

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Really, REALLY fun sounds! Oop, he said "Little girl" and "Daddy", I'm out! -2+ whole points just for that!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Oh he's horny

**Bordersz** (6): OK intro.

**celladonn** (6): this kind of just sounds like a worse version of other songs on this album

**Stryxen** (6): hmm I don't like the melody in the chorus. it unsettles me. but the rest is actually really cool

**Dragusken** (5): I don't know why but the backing instrumentals remind me of "Little Dark Age" by MGMT. The song is okay but it sounds a bit too cringy, like someone trying to say too much while doing the deed.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (3.5): some interesting things happening in this song but also feels unorganized/unfocused

**fadedblue09** (3): his vocals sounds like a demon here

**moonagenightmares** (3): “little girl” ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): ok

**indie\_fan\_** (9.8): I'm a little surprised this didn't break into the top 10, but I suppose the intro was what was bringing it down. Personally, I think it's fun enough and that transition's dope. T.I.'s verse is kinda there, but he bring what's slightly needed here.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): This definitely lost a number of points with people for combining Let Me Talk To You into My Love, and I definitely see why as it leans way harder into the corny side of Justin's persona, but listening more the transition started to work well enough for me to overcome that. My main takeaway from this one though is that we need this kind of choreo from our pop boys again

**xavieryes** (11): My Love is basically the song that got me into (for me) international pop music, so I could not give my 11 to anything else.

**akanewasright** (10): sometimes weird noises are good actually

**amr** (10): heartbreaking the three worst people U know make a great point

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’m not in love with the first part of this song but the second part is so slay that it’s a 10 regardless.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this dumbass medley is kinda setting this song up…. not for me though i love this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): MY LOVE

**DirtyRat583** (10): i thought i would be annoyed by the extra song tacked on the beginning of my love but it was actually good?????? i do not believe it

**flava** (10): invented hyperpop

**frogaranaman** (10): I don’t know what it is about this beat but… yes

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I forgot T.I was here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): TI’s verse going against the entire song is honestly kinda camp

**jsonphile** (10): okay these lyrics are incredibly corny. “This ring here represents my heart” Justin what the hell are you talking about? And T.I. doesn’t even seem to understand that this is a love song. But damn does Timbaland know how to produce a song and Justin and T.I. just exude coolness on this song

**nt96** (10): That We Need a Resolution callback was unexpected as well as the intro medley. Overall its pretty neat but the way it segues into My Love was just chefs kiss, it kinda takes the song to a whole other level.

**rosapalms** (10): sorry my 15-year-old self, it’s good

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): My Love is Justin's best song i said what i said

**theonewithoutmynudes** (10): I still remember the choreography from the MV

**thestoryteller13** (10): The intro to this song is so catchy and then the flow into the song.. perfectionnn

**TiltControls** (10): Justin please just make them separate I don't want to have to remember to skip a minute in everytime I want to listen (thank god for the single version). And why do the physical and digital versions of the album pair them up differently?!? where's the consistency??

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (10): wtf is this insanity here justin bro? like sir, im here backstage at madison square garden watching yr performance over floating cameras provided by the hbo corporation and i'm going apeshit. oh no matter why p4k gave it no. 1 ditty. also i just feel like im floating in the matrix landing 720-quickscopes at 15 sensitivity. even TI, noted trap muzik legend, is here and helping me with my auto-aim!!! lfg everyone!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): That intro drop & the first line? Too damn good. Honestly didn't know I had such reverence for this until now but here we are. The squeaking's probably gonna cost this any chance at a win, but this definitely deserves to place high

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): My love is perfection but let me talk to you … yes can I talk to JT on why this is tacked onto this song

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): The first part is kinda unnecessary, but Part 2 is a banger

**Bordersz** (9.5): Production is HOT. They don't make songs like this anymore lol. 6 minute long songs? In this day and age?

**emayzee** (9.5): aged absolutely incredibly

**noavocadoshere** (9.5): first off, the let me talk to you you/my love mash up is perfect. that transition? good GOD. it's been awhile but a ring? justin was out here skipping all the steps ready to propose. more like my love (bombing).

**plastichaxan** (9.5): My love on its own would be a 10 tbh

**timothy444** (9.5): I don't know how a song can be so sexy in its transitions, production, and vocal delivery but here we are. At this stage of the album, pretty much all of these songs are chart topping single worthy

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): T.I. verse not for me, but the rest is great

**babadork** (9): Get rid of T.I. and this would probably have been a 10. “I’m patient, but I ain’t gon’ try/You don’t come, I ain’t gon’ die” is the least sexy part of this frequently unsexy album.

**celladonn** (9): this would be better without the Let Me Talk To You part. Also fuck T.I but I kind of love his verse, the candle guy line is so stupid

**daythreeinmiami** (9): I’m ignoring the beginning of the songs. They don’t exist in my mind. They’ve always annoyed me and they seriously drag the whole album down. So my score is for My Love. So Timbaland, stop talking, lets get to the main event.

**jaztinax** (9): would’ve been a 10 but i think the first part is annoying af

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): Let Me Talk To You is annoying and brings it down a point but My Love is the perfect pop/rap song

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): sex(y) counter: 64 (-)

**Frajer** (8.5): if JT wrote me a symphony just to say how much he meant to me I'd block him and call the police but the power of this song is undeniable

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is literally the first time I'm hearing this song? There was a secret 3rd number 1 hit on this album that I didn't know about?? Why don't my local radio stations play this anymore?

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): the start part of this is bad but the main part is good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): so we all agree that T.I is carrying this song right

**impla77** (7): Giving rizzo rat in the chorus

**OutrageousWorldTour** (7): My Love is a 10, but minus points for the intro

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.8): LOL at the random-ass witch laughing in the background during the chorus

=====

jackisboredtoday: **1998tweety** (6): the weird baby laughing thing scared me sooo much as a kid, I thought it was supposed to represent a devil or something, it really traumatized me huh, I had shivers while listening to the song rn, I fear I'm not over it

**seanderlust** (5.5): "they call me candle guy" - T.I.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): the second half of this song sounds like budget Flashing Lights (tho this came first I know) and it’s kind of a vibe. The first half is way too repetitive is on some goofy shit

**Dragusken** (4): Gives Fast and Furious OST vibes. But otherwise, really forgettable. Would honestly rather listen to a Tiktok/Soundcloud R&B song.

**heysoupie** (4): the sample on this song is so annoying

**Stryxen** (3): it insists upon itself lois

**throwaway-7650** (2): anyone else hear bo$$ in their flows

**fadedblue09** (1): The first half is god-awful enough to be a 0 contender, sadly the second half is hardly a redemption

**MassiveThief** (1): my love my love my love my love get out of head get out OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD

**apatel27** (0): yeah no the creepy laugh can fuck right off

**vayyiqra** (0): Deeply annoying and repetitive. Can't stand it

**indie\_fan\_** (10): The fact that this is highest performing deep cut on the rate is nothing less than deserved. First time hearing this song, I was instantly captivated. With that sample, background vocals, Jada's feature, and the passion in Usher's vocals all mesh together so well here.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): The final deep cut standing in this rate, and I can see why, the beat is smooth, Jadakiss' verse actually contributes nicely, and Usher can always sing the hell out of any track he's given

**seanderlust** (11): ooooh that sample is glorious here

**soul-glitch** (11): Put his whole Usshy into this one

**amr** (10): jadakiss hand heart

**BeauMeringue212** (10): The story of this song being made for Dr Dre, almost going to Jay-Z and Jadakiss almost not being on it is so interesting. I feel like whoever got it would've made it a hit tbh but I'm glad it went to Usher in the end

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I love that the background singer is taunting Usher

**Dragusken** (10): Usher's vocals here were quite infectious. The harmony in the chorus really made the lyrics feel even stronger, making you really feel like his baby is being missed.

**noavocadoshere** (10): from the sample to the feature? chef's kiss perfection.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): tyler the creator would make a great song with this instrumental

**thestoryteller13** (10): Godddamn I just love Just Blaze's productions, this is so good. Love this sample. LMFAOO gotta love the Jadakiss laugh

**throwaway-7650** (10): can already see this getting stylo'd and I hate it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Fantastic beat

**emayzee** (9.5): discovering non-single gems like this is one of my favorite things about doing rates

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): listening to this on thursday. this is the smartest comment i could come up with

**celladonn** (9): love the production

**fadedblue09** (9): Very funky, one of the true "confessional" tracks

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Coolest guitar sound in the rate, great vocals. Jadakiss good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): why is this the best beat of all time

**IIIHenryIII** (8.7): this feels like an underrated jam

**akanewasright** (8.5): the way this song’s sampling of a sped up throwback song was a trend in the early 00s and hearing that kind of sample is now a throwback to that style on top of the throwback to the Dionne Warwick song… anyway, banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): It’s like the second half of Burn but much less depressing and also not as good.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): spotify has it down as ‘thats my word man you can quote me’ and that is absolutely not what jadakiss says

**heysoupie** (8): this song sounds weirdly contemporary to me, other than the Jadakiss part

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): imagine having to follow Yeah! on a tracklist and actually being successful. something about usher begging for a girl back just works lol

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8): quintessential “gotta get my girl back” R&B

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The sample 👌

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes a cute bop

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Whoever Jadakiss is, when he came in, he sounded like Shy Ronnie

**Stryxen** (6.7): pretty good

(3 x2) BleepBloopMusicFan, daythreeinmiami

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Whew chile this song... WHEEEWWWW CHILE THIS FUCKING SONG! Words can't describe how much Iove this track. The nostalgia, the chemistry between Swizz Beatz' girl and Usher (I kid, I kid), just absolute perfection. This really deserved higher than just barely top 10, quite possibly my favorite Usher duet ever and one of my favorite Usher singles.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): I mean I don't have as much to say about this one as some of the other singles here, but it's a very good track where their voices blend so well. Also I do hope this eventually leads to Alicia getting a much deserved album rate or two one day in the future, since she feels like one of the most relevant pop stars of the 2000s that we haven't covered at all in album rates

**nt96** (11): as iconic Yeah and Closer are, I had to give my 11 to this one. There's just so much memories attached to this one. In the car looking out the window with this on the radio. Being in my grandmother's house, spending hours playing PS2. This is such a perfect balance between upbeat and chill. Absolute classic!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): alicia keys always gets my yass points

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): popheads zoomers will never understand the iconic loserdom of watching this music video on VH1 and getting in your feelings about your non-existent boo cuz you’re in 8th grade and you’re a loser

**Dragusken** (10): Definitely one of my favorites from this album. The addition of Alicia Keyes really puts this song over the top and adds to the expressiveness of this song. The way they both sing "My Boo" and give assurances really make this song feel like a promise that, though parting, they will always be special in each other's lives.

**emayzee** (10): aged like fine wine

**fadedblue09** (10): Dare I say the best female/male pop collaboration in existence?

**frogaranaman** (10): Miss Alicia is my artist that I’d be like “yass slay forward thinking queen” if she releases 7 seconds of silence on iTunes

**jaztinax** (10): this has the kind of deep nostalgia that i can’t describe with words

**sea-assumption-7403** (10): They’re so great together on this track and this was my favorite era of Alicia Keys. This was my 11 at first (and forever in my heart) but ultimately I had to give it to part II.

**thestoryteller13** (10): one of my favorite songs of all time.

**timothy444** (10): It's amazing how well this fits with the overarching theme of this entire album. Though the couple in this song is no longer together, they still feel something, even though it's lingering and just a small dwindling spark. They both know how they can't go back together but they don't regret the times they spent together, even though it ended up in a relationship breaking. Great way to almost end an album.

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (10): omg it's MAI BOO!!! alicia keys sorta helps just let this one rise up amongst the "very likeable but fatiguing chaff" of the back half. idk it was nice to hear this on new year's day with some pals and just enjoy it

**noavocadoshere** (9.9): alicia keys and usher snapped on this collab.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): Classic

**akanewasright** (9.5): we need to rate Diary of Alicia Keys huh

**heysoupie** (9.2): ok the amount of charisma that would be in the same space if this were to be performed live would probably be unbearable. On a personal note, this song was popular when I was in middle school, struggling hard with my mental health and being carried through it all by a boy (who in retrospect had a huge crush on me) who loved to hate this song, but would sing it frequently. We lost touch after he moved when we started high school but I recently found out he is now doing his dream job (insert crying emoji)

**PinkCadillacs** (9.2): Usher and Alicia Keys are fantastic on this song.

**Frajer** (9): I don't know about y'all but I know about us and it's the only way we know how to rock

**soul-glitch** (9): I can't hear this without thinking of the vine.

**TiltControls** (9): me on the character select screen in mario kart double dash and mario kart 8 deluxe

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Oof this is a popular one but I can't say it's one of my all-time favorites

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Alicia adds so much here

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.5): a top 10 iconic R&B chorus

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): I always used to confuse this for Dilemma purely because of the title. Like I’d be there waiting for the “all I think about you” chorus to hit like a DUMMY

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this is lowkey overrated and I say that as someone that owns a CD single of this

**1998tweety** (7): what I say after turning off the Wii when someone takes my favourite character in Mario Kart

**IIIHenryIII** (7): when two legends collab, there’s always a chance of things going south… that’s almost the case

**rosapalms** (7): I’ve always felt like this song is overrated. That’s a very different thing from saying it’s not good.

**Stryxen** (7): I like this song quite a bit but this isn't a great fit for ushers vocals I'm afraid

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i am no longer asking, i am DEMANDING popheads to put songs in a minor in a rate already, its been long overdue

**DirtyRat583** (6.8): the children(?) in the background are annoying

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): something something phoebe bridgers ghost joke

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): sorry its just not as good as dilemma. alicia outshines usher tho

**welcome2thejam** (6): Light nostalgia points, but this never really did it for me. The outro's fun though

**seanderlust** (5.5): sorry alicia and sorry to anyone who really likes this one but i really don't like the chorus of this one. didn't like it when it came out, don't like it now. something about his delivery really bothers me. doesn't help that i don't really have nostalgia for this one

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Oooh this is not gonna be a popular opinion. I’m sorry but this is just so cutesy I’m kind of nauseated.

**daythreeinmiami** (3): I just don’t like it okay don’t @ me.

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Man I like that this reached top 10 and is his second best performing song, but this still deserved to be higher up on placement. I get massive nostalgia with this song, partially because I remember seeing clips with men tryna serenade their girl with this track or have it playing in the background and... that was an interesting time! In all seriousness, an essential Valentine's Day Anthem here.

**jackisboredtoday** (8): A classic radio staple. It never was in my top top echelon of hits from its time (or even my favorite Ne-Yo smash) but I’ve never ever wanted to turn it off once it’s on. In the words of Reese Witherspoon, “Women’s stories matter, they just do!”

**DirtyRat583** (11): giving my 11 to the song i have the most plays for bc i cant decide >>>>>>>>>>>>

**timothy444** (11): Everything is perfect about this, from the start of the instrumental beat to the way Ne-Yo sings. And no, I will not elaborate with a fully blown paragraph. Just trust me on this bros

**1998tweety** (10): I mean come on now

**apatel27** (10): Feminist Anthem

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The way he’s making the fedora “m’lady” gentleman look actually WORK.

**cremeebrulee** (10): internalized this song too much when i was younger now i’m TIRED of being miss independent!!! this shit is not worth it!!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ne-yo just out here making fedora anthems that are somehow not toxic, what a king

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Ne-Yo taught me feminism in 2008.

**Dragusken** (10): Like the titular girl, this song's got its own thing going on, and that's why I love it. Neyo really creates a feeling of intrigue as he pines over this mysterious girl who don't even need his help. The cherry on top is the way the song slows down as he reaches the end and says "That's why I love her…" as if pondering how he can next get to know Miss Independent.

**frogaranaman** (10): why do I feel like Spotify will make a playlist titled “This Is: Feminism” and put this song somewhere near the top

**ImADudeDuh** (10): #NotAllMen

**noavocadoshere** (10): c'mon. everything about miss independent is a home run. on a re-listen however, why would she spend time? what is ne-yo bringing to this freaking luxury dining hall miss independent has going on? it's not even a table dude. stay away from her, get a job.

**nt96** (10): When Kelly Clarkson said "What happened to Miss Independent", its cuz she fell in love with Ne-Yo. Popheads cinematic universe moment???

**Roxieloxie** (10): Im really hoping that this or Yeah! dont win but not enough to not give them a 10 because they both absolutely bang. Ill be honest i think i prefer so sick to this ever so slightly but like two baddies so its fine

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Going just off of the song title, thought I did not remember this but within 0.5 seconds it all came RUSHING back. So dang good. Love those synths so much

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song was the peak of straight men (neyo loves a (#girlboss)

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): me when I hear synths: a 10! I also really like the way ne-yo says independent

**xavieryes** (10): feminist icon

**akanewasright** (9.5): he drank his respect women juice when he wrote this!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Kelly outsold

**seanderlust** (9.5): we truly do stan financial independence

**fadedblue09** (9): Not in love in this as much as the other singles but it's still undeniably iconic

**Frajer** (9): Christina Aguilera and Kelly Clarkson have the Miss Independent but this is still timeless

**oscarbrierley1** (9): there's something about this song that I want to dislike, but i can't. It's just too catchy and the beat is so bouncy.

**TiltControls** (9): such a stellar track even if the production sounds like it was taken from the same source as the default samsung alarm noise

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Neyo said "yasss girlboss kween, pay them bills"

**impla77** (8.5): me living with my parents: ‘tea’

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.4): Kanye stole that beat!!!

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8.1): with the farty high school football synths, sorta feel like i could use a circa 2011 version of this on glee with will schuster going monkey mode

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I've always loved the way they love

**welcome2thejam** (8): Move over women, Ne-Yo made the ultimate girlboss anthem

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i didn’t recognize this from the title but omg my work plays this song all the time

**PinkCadillacs** (7.2): While I do like this song but I just don’t love this song compared to Closer and Mad. Personally it’s my least favorite of the 3 major singles from Year of the Gentleman.

**babadork** (7.1): Even though I was actively following the charts at this time, I somehow missed that this was the biggest single from this album, but it never really did much for me.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): while this is a classic, i don’t think i ever got much of the appeal for it? Especially compared to closer

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): Can’t relate, I’m Miss “Still Dependent on her Parents”

**thestoryteller13** (7): This song is solid but Haha everytime I hear it I think of the Spice remix (if ur caribbean u know what im talking abt lmfao)

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): i loved this song when it came out but in relistening i find it pretty annoying. kelly clarkson owns this title

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): The beat is very cool but personally I don't think Ne-Yo did anything interesting with it (outside of the chorus maybe)

**Stryxen** (6): Michelle Obama Purse so heavy gettin Oprah dollars

**throwaway-7650** (6): incel anthem lowkey... like wdym she makes you proud. so you're a proud boy? why are you sharing this information with the world?

**TragicKingdom1** (3): the background riff is mindnumbingly bad sorry

(1 x1) darjeelingdarkroast

(0 x3) fadedblue09, flava, TakeOnMeByA-ha

**indie\_fan\_** (9.4): Ah yes, the oh so controversial Justin single. I will say this grew on me immensely over time as I woulda given this a 0 instantly if I was still before my teen years. I found it annoying as hell but since then there have been clips that have used this song that improved my opinion on it a shit ton. Does not matter what the clips in question were, point is this song is a jam.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): This could just as easily be high 5's for me or upper 8's depending on the day and how much I'm in the mood for what it offers. I have to respect the audacity though, this being the lead for the album is ridiculous and its even more shocking just how much it worked. The kind of gambit imperial phases are built on...also this went on a journey up and down this was early day 2 at one point a couple dozen ballots in

**plastichaxan** (11): Adding this to the list of songs I realized I listened to way too young and certain behaviors I have suddenly making sense

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this is maybe my dad’s favourite songs of the 2000’s and he spilled

**throwaway-7650** (11): wonho:

**TragicKingdom1** (11): timbaland's best beat idc idc this had SUCH an impact and for good reason. no matter how withered JT gets i will always stan because of this song and the 20/20 experience

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (11): dipshit 11 dispatched to sexyback, a terribly unsexy ditty that still somehow flops it's ass to "weird bop" territory that I raise a big 'ol glass to. As a single, it would not be an 11, but in the context of the album, coming RIGHT after FSLS it works like crazy. Justin makes a promise, one that is unwarranted and as a very unsexy alien in the body of a man from the state of tennesee, seems unprompted. But he's ADAMANT that he can bring "sexy" back \[to the masses\] bc we don't know how to act or something. Now again, his suit and tie fit here isn't exactly in the sexy q-zone, and many people here are helping guide him "to the bridge" or "the chorus". u/PaulaAbdulJabar's notion that he'd just been told what "sex and sexy" is totally makes sense because the lyrics are totally meaningless vapid nonsense that I wanna revel in. Over a real "better to play one-note LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS than two notes at all" beat that clear took notes from Usher's YEAH (ft. Lil Jon), this entire thing just riles me up in the best of ways.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): There’s been periods of my life where I hated this song, but thankfully we’re not in one of those periods.

**Bordersz** (10): I don't care about the awful lyrics. This is iconic. Very experimental for a lead single. No other pop boy has dropped a single that has matched the audacity and riskiness of this song. Such a hard pivot in image.

**celladonn** (10): still goes harder than it has any right to

**cremeebrulee** (10): now that was a classic

**CrimsonROSET** (10): see when you STAY sexy you don’t gotta bring sexy back

**daythreeinmiami** (10): The cultural impact this song had on the world in 2006. The GRIP Timbaland honestly had on the world in 2006 was insane. The youths would never understand. You just had to be there.

**DirtyRat583** (10): this sounds SO dated, like "this song is timeless" said nobody ever, but it bops so

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): iconic, show-stopping, amazing, vomit it out, put it in a blender and drink it etc etc but the repeated use of the word “child” still throws me for a loop even though I’ve heard this song at least 100 times. Anyway, fuck yeah this is the smasha.

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (10): Another classic in this list

**ignitethephoenix** (10): men haven’t been able to achieve sexy camp songs since this

**IIIHenryIII** (10): song structure 101

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is gonna be the last elimination on day 2 and its gonna be a gag

**impla77** (10): i was today years old when i learned wtf jt was saying in the chorus.. wait i forgot

**jaztinax** (10): ahh the days when i would have my earphones plugged into my little bullet mp3-player, singing and dancing to this out loud at age 8

**moonagenightmares** (10): when i was like 10 me and a friend used to blast this song while spinning on those spinny office chairs

**noavocadoshere** (10): timeless.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): this song singlehandedly kept justin Timberlake cool for much longer than he actually was.

**rosapalms** (10): sorry Prince, it’s good

**seanderlust** (10): i am a small fish swimming towards the pretty little light that is timbaland and danja production, that is used as the bait for the angler fish that is justin timberlake

**soul-glitch** (10): One of the nastiest beats in history

**theonewithoutmynudes** (10): I remember when this song first dropped people were like wtaf is this, but then it became iconic quite quickly as other singles from the album were released and also became v popular

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): sex(y) counter: 34 (+25)

**timothy444** (10): sexy af

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): It's funny he's trying to be manly on this track because I always thought he sounded super gay… not that that's a bad thing

**xavieryes** (10): invented the typical pop song structure

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.9): Prince was kinda right saying sexy never left but Justin still did something here, so I’m giving this a petty 9.9

**PinkCadillacs** (9.5): What a freaking jam. My second favorite from the album.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): Once again, what a fuckin banger.

**BeauMeringue212** (9): We should not have been singing this in the elementary school discos

**emayzee** (9): eight year old me felt like she was at the club whenever this came on

**nt96** (9): Watching the MV on YouTube gives me such nostalgia and I'm so grateful that I can experience it at anytime. Thank you, Janet's right titty.

**thestoryteller13** (9): Bop but goofy

**TiltControls** (9): this is to the parts of a song what hollaback girl was to spelling bananas

**welcome2thejam** (9): Went through a roller coaster through this one. This last listen on the good headphones put me on the side of Sexyback enjoyer, though I could easily be on the other side any given day.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): Everything I've seen talked about this ditty has it coming across as incredibly divisive. With this song title, it could've been so much worse but I think it's pulled off well

=====

jackisboredtoday: **TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): the production here is so incredible, but there's something about the way JT sings that I don't like

**MassiveThief** (8): "lemme see what you're twerking with" is such a horrific bar but still... banger

**Frajer** (7.5): JT isn't sexy and Prince was right to say sexy never left when he heard this song but Timbaland really put a sick beat on this song and the yeah you ready is iconic

**akanewasright** (7): I get it, but also I’ve never strongly enjoyed this one

**Dragusken** (7): This song, although cringy, is a classic so I have to give it its due respect. Still remember first hearing the song from an art history parody back in school.

**heysoupie** (6.2): this song is bizarre and corny and to me, proof that people will fall for gimmicky shit if someone we think is cool (Timbaland) tells them its cool

**jsonphile** (6): this is one of those songs that I just don’t know how I feel about it. Sometimes it’s a 10 sometimes it’s a 2. It’s both incredibly cool and also incredibly corny

**letsallpoo** (6): dont reference slavery challenge \[IMPOSSIBLE\]

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): honestly i never really liked this song all that much, the production and the timbaland ad-libs carry it for me

**1998tweety** (4): idk this song has always sounded scary to me, the slave lines are also....not it, but Timbaland eats.

**apatel27** (4): sorry but never liked this song

**Roxieloxie** (4): im pretty sure this is how i heard this song first in 2015 when this app took over

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): there are like three songs from my pre-teen days I never re-visit. Milkshake I already zeroed, “Thong Song” i never think to listen to and I’d prolly give a “have to respect it” 7. This is the third one and honestly it just has no replay value for me. It’s way too long and repetitive, just hate how Justin sounds here.

**fadedblue09** (0): an ABOMINATION

**flava** (0): this is the Look What You Made Me Do of sex jams

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): hated this song ever since i was a kid and no it has not grown on me in the slightest, everything about this song just sounds so ugly and annoying, how THIS was the song that restarted justin’s career i will never know

**Lowest Scores:**

(3 x2) daythreeinmiami, pijus41

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Man, it woulda been amazing if this was a top 5 song. But if anything, I'm pleasantly surprised it did this well. I also can't not think of Boondocks every time I hear this, that episode's a classic \[cue to only 3 people on the entire raterbase that know wtf I'm referring to\].

**jackisboredtoday** (10): This made it pretty high up but honestly it still feels like a robbery to me. There was a split-second in the first few ballots where it was in contention to win and I got excited because this would’ve been a slay winner so it was sad seeing one of the best ballads of the 00s (all time?) slowly drop down to #7 as more ballots came in and competition got stiffer

**amr** (11): romance.

**apatel27** (11): one of the best songs of the decade

**akanewasright** (10): Jermaine Dupri’s melodies have such a specific style, and while it’s a pretty versatile style, it’s kind of killing me to hear the ghost of Mariah’s “Shake It Off” in the chorus of this emotional ballad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The runner up for my eleven. He’s a fucking MESS in this song and it’s so GOOD.

**Bordersz** (10): The falsettos on this are immaculate.

**Dragusken** (10): The thrilling conclusion to the Confession series, Burn feels like a soulful acceptance of how much Usher's wrongdoings have led to a drift in his relationship with his girl. The need to "let \[their relationship\] burn" is sung with a pained but positive note, making you feel the pain of things being too late.

**fadedblue09** (10): An 11 contender, and my favorite single on this album. Seriously, it has everything: topnotch storytelling, lush instrumentation and Usher's vocal versatility

**Frajer** (10): fifty-leven days umpteen hours

**oscarbrierley1** (10): he sings the hell out of this song.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Production wild

**sea-assumption-7403** (10): Another classic. On a different day, this could have been my 11.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): heartbreak usher is the best usher

**thestoryteller13** (10): :( sadddddd but a classic. Makes sense to follow the confession tracks.

**TiltControls** (10): The 11 of the album tbh

**timothy444** (10): This brings me back so many memories, and although it sounds kinda dated, that's because his sound (basically the synthesized strings in it) in this basically was the 2000s. Banger!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Never in my life did I think the words "fifty-leven" and "umpteen" could be so heartrending

**xavieryes** (10): another classic

**noavocadoshere** (9.9): the boondocks scene for this is iconic and it's hard not to sing along to this. one time this song came on at my friend's birthday bash and she's a big usher fan so she let it play and i had to go outside to like, get myself together and stop sniffling bc the cake cutting was coming up. but i could hear this through the walls and my situationship/mutual friend showed up with his ex :( the memory tied to this makes me laugh now.

**seanderlust** (9.2): usher's voice here sounds so incredible. his falsetto is like honey

**CrimsonROSET** (9): SO MANY DAYS :kirbyell: SO MANY HOURS

**Stryxen** (9): oooh I squealed a little in the final prechrous

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): post leg day anthem

**PinkCadillacs** (8.7): This song is so good. It was an amazing way to follow up to Yeah in terms of singles.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): inside of me there is two wolves, one telling me to move on and one telling me to cry

**BeauMeringue212** (8): I've always loved the chorus but felt the accoustic guitar sits oddly in the mix during the verses

**emayzee** (8): this was never one of my favorite singles of his, but that's just a testament to how stacked his singles discography is bc this is still an 8

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this song is just ok so how did it become such a big hit?

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I mean it's basically U Got It Bad 2 but that's not a bad thing

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8): kinda feels like a good 7/11 gamer fuel anthem. drum machine pimping out like a litany of hitmarkers coming out a chopper gunner. but usher? boy is smooth.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7.4): fatigue is also pretty real with this song as well but it’s an easier listen compared to yeah

**frogaranaman** (7): can’t believe Ellie Goulding did a cover of this song and fucked it up so much

**1998tweety** (6.5): Hamilton washed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): had to listen to this one on loop for a while to try to understand why this one is so loved, not sure if i actually like it but at least i understand the appeal now

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): ellie goulding outsold i fear

**PretentiousPegasus** (4): this might be controversial but burn is boring and overrated as hell

**daythreeinmiami** (3): So this man. Cheated on his woman, begged for her forgiveness over two damn songs, and is now in the very next song like ‘um excuse me I’m hurting you gotta let it burn lol soz it’s you’. That emotional whiplash. This is why I like Raymond V Raymond. It doesn’t get me emotionally invested.

**Lowest Scores:**

(3 x1) xavieryes

**jackisboredtoday** (9.1): MEGABOP ALERT!! I heard so much less about this than the other Confessions singles growing up, with this being the only single to not reach #1 (though it did go top 10) and the only one that didn't feel like it was just in the air as a kid, and I do not see why. The second I heard it I was hooked because the beat and hook are some of the best on the whole album. Luckily, while it was robbed by the general public of even greater successes, we at least let it get right up to the edge of the top 5 here... Also once again, we need this kind of choreo back!!!

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): For a while, I thought this was going to be the second best performing Usher song on the rate mostly based on popheads usual taste. I was never that crazy about it because I feel it gets a bit repetitive, but he does great on the vocals side and I do see the appeal behind it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): this song is somewhat similar to me to my favorite Usher song ever, “U Don’t Have to Call”. That song is an 100/10, so I will settle on giving “U Don’t Have to Call” Pt. 2 an 11

**oscarbrierley1** (11): the song of all songs, the beat of all beats.

**OutrageousWorldTour** (11): I’ve always loved this song - such a jam! Perfect for dancing and it’s such a fun listen.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): GOT ME FEELIN' IT. Again, I OWNED this CD and forgot this was on this album. Anyways, easy 11, what a stretch starting from "Confessions Part II"

**vayyiqra** (11): This song has been stuck in my head, on and off, for almost 20 years

**akanewasright** (10): wait LMAO the writer of this song is Poo Bear, the guy who’s written half of Bieber’s big hits from Journals/Purpose. Had no idea he was around this early

**cremeebrulee** (10): me with rates after finishing this on jan 1

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me when i finally do all rates in a month

**Frajer** (10): the production on this is immaculate

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I can’t believe I somehow missed this bop until now

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is his third best song, it only loses to hey daddy and climax

**ImADudeDuh** (10): bitch YAS

**jsonphile** (10): an absolute bop. I agree Yeah should be the song best remembered for this album, but this one deserves some love too, and I never really hear it anymore

**noavocadoshere** (10): i don't want to be biased and i'm honestly trying not to be but like...is there one average song here? it's just usher's pure talent and ability at work here.

**nt96** (10): iconic bop, iconic MV, what else do you need?

**plastichaxan** (10): This would’ve been such a classic for kid Poppy wow

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): the best usher song and it isnt close!! the best karaoke song too

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Another banger!!!

**TiltControls** (10): how are these first 7 songs so damn good

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I like this for the same reasons I like Closer

**welcome2thejam** (10): Great song all-around, but at the end of the day, it's the horns baby

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): such a catchy beat

**emayzee** (9.2): this went diamond in my mom's minivan during my radio disney phase

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (9.1): had a very unfortunate moment with my boombox when around 46-54 seconds into the song, it just stayed stuck glitching around and reformulating the cut into one of 'em gltichy bandcamp wonderlands I go apeshit for. However, it should be noted that usher makes a lotta "r" sounds during this time and the entire affair was just quite bizarre (and claustrophobic in the skipping) but really hit on weird qualities in this album here--huge plunderphonic potential waiting to be tapped I think. I can't remember where I heard this one, but I know it and it's nice to see it hea-oh damn it my boombox is doing it again I gotta skip the track :/

**Bordersz** (9): Love the runs on this.

**frogaranaman** (9): dude needs to get off

**thestoryteller13** (9): Cmon horns

**PinkCadillacs** (8.9): This song deserved better. It should’ve been the 5th #1 hit from Confessions.

**flava** (8.5): this would be a 10 if i didn’t feel like Will I Am used this as major inspiration to create the worst song ever

**MassiveThief** (8.5): banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Oh this was a single? It’s good!

**daythreeinmiami** (8): if u pimpin pop a bottle of this

**Dragusken** (8): This one is not bad, however it doesn't really leave an impact on my mind. However, I cannot deny that the chorus is really nice to listen to.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): weakest of the era's singles but still an enjoyable song

**1998tweety** (7): im boppin

**heysoupie** (7): this song stresses me out. I guess that’s the point

**timothy444** (7): Certainly one of the weaker singles from this album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): yeah!’s slightly underwhelming brother

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6.5): I’ve never really latched on to this song but it’s pretty fun

**dream\_fighter2018** (5.5): you’ve heard of the Yeah! triangle, now get ready for the Caught Up Tuba!

**indie\_fan\_** (10): One thing about Justin's FS/LS single choice... they made the right choice every damn time. The transition to the second part of the song, JT's vocals are on point here, The instrumentation, everything here is great. Very worthy top 5 song.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): I actually was going to give this barely a 7 up until a few days before the due date but I listened again around that time and everything just clicked for me. Namely, that outro, which takes the whole thing to an entirely different level when he switches it up at the end. Honestly if this rate went on a couple more weeks I might have wound up giving it a 10

**1998tweety** (11): i mean come on now, this song is turbo long but doesn't feel like it and it helps that its GOOD

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this is the best song of all time

**MassiveThief** (11): epic, multi-faceted, beautifully produced, oh and TAYLOR SWIFT REFERENCE????

**moonagenightmares** (11): the last third of this song is kinda godtier

**TiltControls** (11): I apologize for any complaints I had about combining interludes with tracks in my previous comment because this song wouldn't be nearly as effective without both parts. The slow built up throughout the song is nothing short of stellar. Though Usher had so many amazing tracks to choose from and Ne-Yo had Closer, there's no way I wasn't going to give this masterpiece my 11.

**akanewasright** (10): when the beat switch kicks in, I ascend…

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): You know what this kind of did have to be seven and a half minutes long

**celladonn** (10): Strong 11 contender, the I Think She Knows part is so lovely

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Who needs drugs when this song gets me stoned.

**DirtyRat583** (10): this is so good and its gonna go out day 2 isnt it

**IIIHenryIII** (10): and this is how you make an interlude

**impla77** (10): I didn’t see myself liking a 7 minute JT song but here we are

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Glee ass song

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): a masterpiece

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): like with the next song, the highlight is the outro but the rest is an undeniable bop

**timothy444** (10): You know things are about to get real when the bloody guitar starts coming in towards the five minute mark. One of the best ways to slowly transition to an interlude! Hell, LoveStoned feels incomplete now that I know there's a god-tier interlude wrapping it up.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): Best chorus on the record, interlude is fun, but a couple lines having me going "huh?" keeping the 10 away

**emayzee** (9.7): a discography highlight

**sea-assumption-7403** (9.5): Maybe the best medley. hits all the right beats for me.

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (9.5): if you're freaky and you know it, let me here you make some noise *me, making noise bc this album is bizarrely hitting all the buttons* it bops on the cd so hard.

**Bordersz** (9): The violins in the transition and then the guitar SO GOOD. I Think She Knows should have been a seperate song.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): finally a track I like

**PinkCadillacs** (9): This is my third favorite from the album.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): against my better judgement and despite the fact that some of these lyrics are truly atrocious…i can’t make it not bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Horny, Sexy, Pretty

**welcome2thejam** (9): I think my brain is irreparably broken because my first thought is if Sufjan Stevens did a live cover of this multipart extravaganza, it would honestly probably be tight as hell

**babadork** (8.9): I don’t know how this song that tries to compliment how well a woman’s ass reflects light and uses the word “freaky” repeatedly manages to be maybe kind of sexy.

**amr** (8.8): this pink panther ass production on lovestoned

**flava** (8.5): just remembered that there is a song called she knows by someone else in this rate and if you play it, I will report you to the rate police

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): I love this one. Both sections are amazing.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): even just the “interlude” part is 2 minutes

**DaHumanTorch** (8.3): the production giving glee transitions

**CrimsonROSET** (8): a seven minute song categorized as an interlude oh he does NOT know the pophead demographic

**oscarbrierley1** (8): this feels like the introduction to what he would be doing on his next album. Which was making songs that repeat way too much. If you cut 1-2 mins from before the beat switch it would be perfect.

**plastichaxan** (8): What is it with these extra songs that make me drop the score for the other one I don’t want to overthink how the album is done but I am confused

**Stryxen** (8): OW! Okayyy medulla

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7.7): rare instance where a Justin Timberlake interlude actually weakens the song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): ok i hated this song in 2006 and haven't willingly listened to it since but damn it slaps?? unfortunately i still hate the outro and it's so fucking long so i'm deducting points there

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): coward stopped saying sexy just because I started to keep count

**Dragusken** (6): Makes me think of the Moto Moto scene from Madagascar. Feels whatever but I do have to admit that the bass notes do sound quite nice.

**Frajer** (6): he needs solitary confinement in horny jail

**Roxieloxie** (6): 'shes got me love stoned' can you just say you have a boner like a normal person

**fadedblue09** (5.5): the second half is heavenly. Too bad the first half is such an overproduced, noisy ordeal to get through

**noavocadoshere** (4): TIL justin timberlake can actually play the guitar, and that wasn't something he just said to sound cool.

**indie\_fan\_** (9.9): Uh. Yeah. Uh. Watch this \[Waves peace signs in front\]. I mean, everything that's been said positively about this song has already been said. Widely regarded better than part one which definitely makes sense! For some reason, this song just doesn't hit that special it factor for me to give it that perfect score, but still great nonetheless.

**akanewasright** (11): Imagine buying this album because you liked burn and/or yeah and generally liked Usher from previous albums and then got to this tabloid scandal of a song… iconic moment and SUCH a fucking great song

**bigbigbee** (11): One of the funniest songs ever. this took me OUT when I heard it for the first time. . I can’t believe that he was trickle truthing this person so badly it took two tracks. there’s not even a break in the album between Confessions and this one!!!!!! This is literal comedy gold

**emayzee** (11): he actually named it this because "II" looks like 11 and he knew it was worthy of 11ing in a rate two decades later

**Roxieloxie** (11): Hello? Yo, I'm in the booth I'ma call you right back Nah, I just gotta put this one part down I'ma call you back I'm at the studio, man, what? Man, quit playin' with me, man.... No but foreal, I hardly ever 11 singles in rates which is why my win rate is so low but this song fucking gagged me. Its one i've known all my life but i dont think I processed any of the words until listening to it for this rate and this paired with part 1 legit had my jaw drop. Everything about this song is so audacious and sleezy and yet its quite literally artistry. It feels like a 4th wall break in which im watching this album being acting out in front of me. The moment I saw the video for this it was over for everything else

**sea-assumption-7403** (11): Perfection. I don’t know if anybody but Usher could sing so well about riding in his whip to tell his main lady that he knocked up his side chick.

**1998tweety** (10): the sequel ATE, it's giving Catching Fire

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Top 5 musical sequel of all time EASILY.

**Bordersz** (10): WATCH THISS!! That guitar is iconic.

**celladonn** (10): Something so funny about the audacity of this song. Also it slays

**Dragusken** (10): In my opinions, Part II took what Confessions excelled in and turned it up to a whole new level. The speedy delivery of the truth and the expressive riffs Usher gives us really shows the desperation to try to be true to his boo and hoping that they'll be able to go through this turbulent time.

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): okay so this one has him getting the girl he’s having an affair with pregnant after the first one was relatively tame. Thank God it didn’t get more out there because the “Usher arranged marriage” arc would have been a step too far for me

**fadedblue09** (10): Pure pop-R&B perfection. The vocal runs, catchy lyrics are everything

**Frajer** (10): thanks Artie Abrams for letting Usher have this one first

**IIIHenryIII** (10): when the sequel is better than the original

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way this was a single and it was huge too. If I made a song in order to confront head-on my infidelity and getting someone besides my spouse pregnant AND then my label was like “hey, make this a single and name your album after this” i’d be a bit taken aback.

**noavocadoshere** (10): "Confessions P. II is gonna sweep the 2000's Pop&B Perfection. Am I serious? How do I know? I will put that on everything. I'd even eat an avocado if my prediction is wrong."

**nt96** (10): so damn good like come on

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): the audacity to apologise so publicly with these self-centred ass lyrics 💀 and make it a bop too?? the pop boys arent doing it like him anymore

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok usher you REALLY fucked up but at least you made this song

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Classic

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i don't like cheating but i'll endorse it if we get bangers like this out of it.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (10): I still laugh at any of the “watch this” memes that come up on my TL

**throwaway-7650** (10): this song is so pathetic \[affectionate\]

**timothy444** (10): I absolutely love how cohesive this feels as a whole on this album. Like, of course it's the title track, but it both feels like its own separate track and the second half of the previous track as well. Pure fire

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Sometimes I love this song, and sometimes I think, if Drake did something like this we would all be clowning him endlessly

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (10): I like the fact that he put pt 2 after and said "i have confessions part II". this is important honesty AND continuity that the man is establishing. i don't even care if its true or not, I just think he's doing the right thing here and I'm assuming this ditty will have a 10+ avg bc we all agree "usher is doing the right thing here"

**welcome2thejam** (10): Never has infidelity sounded so good so often

**babadork** (9.8): I’ve spent almost two decades convinced that this song was about Usher’s real life. I guess I don’t need to remove points out of loyalty to Chilli.

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): Tristan Thompson's go-to karaoke song

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this is the greatest song about cheating of all time

**jsonphile** (9.5): never forget when the boys on glee were on drugs from their teacher’s wife and performed this song mashed up with Bon Jovi’s It’s My Life

**seanderlust** (9.5): (usher comes back in the room after confessions part one) okay...you're gonna laugh...

**thestoryteller13** (9): Damn this song is so much better if you listen to part one first.

jackisboredtoday: **thisusernameisntlong** (9): how many parts do you need

**TiltControls** (9): not even a song later and he's already planning the whole confessions cinematic universe

**impla77** (8.5): This is just like me.. getting the tea 20 years later

**jaztinax** (8.5): where’s the bon jovi part

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Confessions was so boring he immediately made a Part II to redeem himself king

**cremeebrulee** (8): what’s more unhinged, him having so many crimes he needed a second part to this song or them covering this on glee for some reason

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is so funny to me because i imagine that part 1 had been done for a while then he got this information and just went ‘shit’

**frogaranaman** (8): watch this

**heysoupie** (8): an iconic song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): oh

**PinkCadillacs** (7.8): I like Part 2 of Confessions way more than Part 1. Also the Watch This line is iconic.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.8): ✌️ watch this ✌️

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (7.5): Oh my god the DRAMA! And this one is an improvement above the 1st confession. The 1st one kinda comes across like he's flexing about having a side chick and a crib and a car, but all the things he talks about in this one are just, not good

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The glee mashup with this and ‘It’s My Life’ was a bop what can I say. But USHER you expect this woman to stay with you after ALL THIS? I know it’s a song but I am heated.

**soul-glitch** (7): Shaking ass to one of the most scandalous, humiliating, disgraceful stories I've ever heard

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): damn the plot thickens

**moonagenightmares** (6): these lyrics are so awful in the bad person way lol

**apatel27** (4): Babe I cheated on you multiple times and got another woman pregnant but i admit it so you need to forgive me now

**Lowest Scores:**

(2 x1) noavocadoshere

**indie\_fan\_** (10): And Justin's album is now officially fully out. Part of me thought the long-songphobes were gonna tank this out of the top 5 but I'm glad to see where it placed. I have to say how much that 3 song run from Lovestoned to this is so damn good. Him making a song about someone else getting their karma is ironic in retrospect given... 🐘 . Regardless, this is easily in the top 3 jt singles for me and its length is perfect.

**jackisboredtoday** (7): I mean its good but also if we’re picking extremely long or sweeping Timberlake tracks he has better, and if we’re looking at his big breakup melodramas he still has better

**cremeebrulee** (11): i’m not 11ing JT i’m 11ing the gossip girl pilot

**frogaranaman** (11): lol like a record got it

**ignitethephoenix** (11): this was his mirrors before he dropped mirrors

**jaztinax** (11): the first song/mp3-file i got on my nokia phone, transferred from my cousin with infrared<3 nostalgic, timeless, pop&b perfection, ahead of its time, brilliant

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): I don’t want to root for the white man but this song is a masterpiece

**popnbogo** (11): an awesome level up from cry me a river, which was already awesome to begin with

**PretentiousPegasus** (11): probably my favourite song of all time

**static\_int\_husp** (11): this is maybe the only interlude on this album that works well with it's connected song, and it works really well

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): is this what patriots feel like

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): No need to berate me, I'm fully aware of the wack-ness of 11-ing the only white artist in an RnB rate, but to do otherwise would be lying to myself. One of my first music memories is of my dad singing this song and having me try to sing it as well. Listening to it now, I can tell that he did indeed have taste! Everything about this song is just so smooth and sexy and spiteful, from the earwormy Middle Eastern riff to his expressive vocals (that little pout Justin does in the second pre-chorus might be my favorite moment). Do I think this song is the epitome, the apex of RnB? Nah. But we don't rate songs based on how well they fit the theme of the rate, we rate them based on how good we think they are in general. And popheads, I think this song is good.

**1998tweety** (10): this was my bop growing up, king devoured

**akanewasright** (10): I’ll be pissed if this wins bc I couldn’t stop it… Danja made Justin make a point or two it’s sad

**amr** (10): britney girl look away!!!!!!!!

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Look, I know this is basically Cry Me A River Part 2, and we're all very anti-Justin for that but... this absolutely goes off sorry

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This has to be Justin’s best chance to win…congrats on fifth place!

**Bordersz** (10): Love the interlude outro part.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): cut to mike’s mic explaining how this song was used perfectly in gossip girl

**DirtyRat583** (10): the 2006 compression on the shaker vs the luscious production of literally everything else 🤼🤼

**fadedblue09** (10): the best song on this album by a long shot.

**Frajer** (10): the beat to this song is incredible and it is so gorgeous this had 11 potential

**IIIHenryIII** (10): they needed the interlude to show that karma does exist

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Karma is his boyfriend, karma is a god

**moonagenightmares** (10): the balkan twang in the instrumental has me in a chokehold i fear

**nt96** (10): I get so triggered when the radio stations cut the ending, its too good!

**PinkCadillacs** (10): This is my favorite song from the album. I love that this song is just like Cry Me a River, which is also my personal favorite off of Justified.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Yeah, I still dig it

**soul-glitch** (10): When you CHEATED girl, my heart BLEEDED girl ✋😫🤚

**theonewithoutmynudes** (10): this was actually close to being my eleven - the way the interlude comes in so smoothly and the instrumental throughout but I was not trying to give JT my 11, especially when so much of what I love about this song and album is the result of timbaland’s prowess

**throwaway-7650** (10): UGH I wish I could tank

**timothy444** (10): Justin Timberlake and Timbaland even knows how to make a petty break-up song so sexy

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (10): wait this is so friggin bonkers live. even justin can't believe how much fun he's having

**daythreeinmiami** (9.5): I realised I was 100% bisexual in 2006 when I watched ScarJo in this music video.

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (9.5): Love the instrumental on this one

**jsonphile** (9.5): it’s a less good version of cry me a river, which is to say it’s still a really damn good song

**TiltControls** (9.5): [https://i.imgur.com/Gctkxqa.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Gctkxqa.jpg)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): I always found this a bit overrated but the outro is gorgeous, outsells the rest of the song by far

**Dragusken** (9): Why does the start of this song make me think of Genshin Impact…Well anyways, this is one of the better songs from the album. Actually sounds like an R&B song for once and the chorus actually sounds pretty nice, with the riffs.

jackisboredtoday: **oscarbrierley1** (9): probably too long, but it switches up enough to make it interesting. The music video is so iconic to me, I wore it out on YouTube when it first came out.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): iconic song iconic video it takes talent to make a 7 minute song feel short

**thestoryteller13** (9): Always loved the end of this song

**welcome2thejam** (9): Yeah this one's still great

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): kermit is my boyfriend

**emayzee** (8.8): i actually prefer the interlude in this one

**sea-assumption-7403** (8.4): I really burned out on this song in the past & thought i’d score it lower but it’s still pretty good.

**impla77** (8.1): petty queen

**seanderlust** (8): me explaining tetherball

**OutrageousWorldTour** (7): This is honestly hard to rate properly. The first section drags on two long and I can’t help but think of the video, where the cheating girlfriend is told she deserved to die in a fiery car crash because of the aforementioned cheating. Just ugly stuff there. The song itself doesn’t really have that ugliness - it does sound like a horror film score, but at least it doesn’t make me feel like I’m about to get called misogynistic slurs.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): the interlude is better than the actual song

**babadork** (5.5): Justin Timberlake cannot make a breakup song without me being at least a little suspicious that it’s misogynistic.

**noavocadoshere** (2): absolutely gorgeous production but i'm ready for the tomatoes. i hate this song. HATE IT. it's everything i dislike about justin timberlake in a song and i had to sit through seven minutes of it. idc.

indie\_fan\_: a rather interesting album in Justin’s career, all things considered. Obviously considered it’s absolute peak, which I think is mostly due to how timbaland was on fire during the 2000’s. I think I personally slightly prefer 20/20 experience part 1, but this is full a great record with some of the best singles of his career, with or without n sync.

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8.815): How tf you rate this cornball classic? For real though, Justin Timberlake doesn't seem real and I watched the Futuresex/Loveshow madison square garden dvd, so I know he IS real. I guess though while watching that, I had one of my batshit epiphanies about why even though this LP sticks out like a sore thumb in the rate, it also floats above the others for me. It's poor-man's scritti, touring in the year of the last scritti album to date. Green Gartside was too anxious and misled and never toured his pop'n'b vision until it was decades removed, but Futuresex/Lovesounds is sort of a brilliant "almost-satire" of pop having deep meaning or awareness that refutes high class vision of Gartside's best works. Justin Timberlake is populist and a completely unsexy alien who loves black pop and just wants to provide that love in a series of the most "Timbaland is carrying you but that's okay" bangers to a mass audience; the kind that are deeply funny on an album but could totally work given a funk-band inclination in a live context. The kind that almost have him operating as a mannequin with no personality, the perfectly fitting final form of justin. That the album got Pitchfork attention isn't really surprising--not just because the songs were here or that Justin was white--but because Pitchfork's staff had a sugar tooth for pop with their single coverage, and yeah dude just hit it out at the right moment for the site to champion. Across at least 75% of this album (and all its singles and DVD), I genuinely believe in the fucked up notion of Futuresex/Lovesounds. So here's a tequilia shot and salute to the troops in Iraq fighting for my freedom! you did it justin, sir.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.769): one of the best albums of the 2000s. Timberland/ Timbalake/ Justimbaland is the best duo ever. This one alone had 5 eleven contenders, how’s that possible?

**jaztinax** (8.462): the literal definition of 2000s pop&b perfection

**rosapalms** (8.308): this was the revelation of the rate for me. I’d never listened to this album all the way through, and I think I was expecting that the singles were totally carrying it. But the album tracks mostly all deliver too.

**PretentiousPegasus** (8.231): one of my favourite albums of all time. i was 6 years old when this came out and it was the first album/music in general i started paying attention to, thanks to the thats what i call music CDs over the following few years. i still listen in full about once a month.

**xavieryes** (8.192): I used to listen to this album 24/7 back in 2007, might be the album I've listened to the most in my life and it's pretty much what got me into pop so yeah I'm a bit attached to it

**timothy444** (8.115): It should come as no surprise that Justin Timberlake manages to win the rate in a landslide because pretty much almost every song is amazing and transitions well with each other. I especially love how incredibly strong the first half of the album is and how explicit but sorta clean that Justin Timberlake comes across. It's not too raunchy, in fact it's exactly the perfect amount of horny that is present in this amazing pop album.

**frogaranaman** (8.077): do the mens rate

**babadork** (7.892): Even though the only person involved with this that isn’t actively unsexy is Beyoncé, I think it somehow manages to still be sexy.

**sea-assumption-7403** (7.723): this album came out when I started college so a lot of these songs and whole album really, I associate with that time in my life which likely influenced my scores. I wasn’t expecting to still enjoy some of the singles like SexyBack or What Goes Around as much because they were truly everywhere during that era but they hold up. the album still feels exciting and fresh even as it reflects hallmarks from its mid 00s era; it flows in and out of genres, the production is great, creatively it’s interesting and of course JT’s falsetto. I also really liked the ballads on this. A classic pop album and I don’t know that any of the current male pop stars have ever put out anything this iconic.

**Bordersz** (7.615): This is really his best album hands down. So cohesive and the production is so ahead of its time.

**jsonphile** (7.577): Justin really told us he was bringing sexy back and he did. Really though, this album is carried heavily by Timbaland’s production. That man ruled the mid-2000s and his beats sound just as fresh today as they did back then. While I think his best work was with Nelly Furtado’s big hits, he’s got some excellent work here, especially on My Love. And of course, Justin Timberlake is great here. I know in recent years there’s been a lot of backlash towards him, but let’s not pretend these songs don’t slap

jackisboredtoday: **nt96** (7.462): I don't know how well this album will turn out amidst the controversy surrounding Janet/Britney. Many people avoid that whole "separate the art from artist" adage and tank the album due to the sins of the artist. It's rather unfortunate because, this album is pretty great. I love how some songs have their own medley before it switches up on you and takes it up a notch, it makes the tracks a bit more dynamic and adventurous in the process; I would go as far as saying they remind me a bit like DJ sets. I admire how far Timbaland was willing to go with creating a left-of-center pop album, even if some songs didn't stand the test of time. It's still a very well put album.

**DirtyRat583** (7.415): this album made me unhappy. it was going so well!!!!! like everything until chop me up was excellent. then damn girl comes in and starts the end for the quality. say my name by destiny's child autoplayed afterwards and i was like "ah, something fresh". its older than the album by 7 years !!!! i am so sad. originally the comment was gonna be "i think loose is the better of the 2 timbaland 2006 megaproductions but this is really good too" well not anymore. this could have been an amazing 40ish minute album but nope its a strained 70 (!!) minute album (at least the version in the playlist is - standard is 66 minutes but thats still excessive). ok enough complaining - what goes around/comes around is one of the best 2000s tracks and it alone made this album worthy of its 4x platinum status - and sexyback is the cherry on top

**TiltControls** (7.308): Basically lives by the success and quality of the singles. Rest of the album ranges from fine to eh. And thank god the deluxe/extra tracks were left at that

**thestoryteller13** (7.154): [Definitely ahead of its time being released in 2006, but overall super fun and sexy album with an iconic and genius cover art.]

**cremeebrulee** (7.046): this album is why i'm a misandrist

**flava** (6.962): it’s the sound of the future, and the future has sex, unlike the past where no one ever had sex, so say thanks to mr timberlake for inventing sex

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.923): This album is the definition of "trying too hard" like seriously. Not that there aren't amazing parts of the record, cause there are, I just wish they weren't so sparsely spread amongst a sea of cringe. As clichéd as it sounds, Justin Timberlake sounds best when he’s just being himself.

**welcome2thejam** (6.769): This is consistently put forward as one of the game changing 2000s albums, and based off the singles, I could certainly agree. Shame the deep cuts tend to be dull or baffling though

**sarcasticsobs** (6.700): I DO remember this one being this long. A couple truly greats songs accompanied by 2 of the worst songs I've listened to in months, potentially years

**oscarbrierley1** (6.577): when it's future its good, when it does the retro sound it sounds like a less interesting version of other songs.

**BeauMeringue212** (6.523): The hits on this are so goddamn good, iconic even, but the rest of the album feels like an afterthought to me

**akanewasright** (6.385): Justin Timberlake has had “go white boy go” said to him a few too many times, but unfortunately Danja and Timbaland are the ones saying it, so the music is kinda great most of the time

**Dragusken** (5.923): Yeah…was pretty sure I wouldn't be a fan because of JT's voice…but I dislike his lyrics more lol. However, was surprised I rated some songs highly.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.523): Kinda loses its steam in the second half but all the singles are bangers. Pretty good album. SexyBack is a total slay.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.846): I think I’m the world’s quietest Justin Timberlake hater lmao. Idk, I’m not usually out here blaspheming him on popheads posts. I was a huge *NSYNC stan who also disliked Justin TImberlake, so I’ve been containing multitudes since I was 9. A lot of this album runs overly long and self-indulgent. Some cuts sound like Justin Timberlake and Timbaland fucking around and chuckling that they’re smooth geniuses. No disrespect to legend Timbaland (all disrespect to JT), but that vibe I’m describing can get really annoying fast. Outside of some all-timers (What Goes Around), I haven’t been into JT’s vocal tone since like 1998 so a lot of this album was a slog for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.769): admittedly i was never a fan of timberlake so i don’t think i was ever going to enjoy this album, but even besides that this is just BLOATED, songs go on way longer than they should and it falls off majorly near the end in an unrecoverable way.

**fadedblue09** (4.654): I had a hard time listening to this album because I was never the biggest fan of Timbaland's production style: Too much focus on firing aggressive beats every second that ends up overwhelming the performer's presence. On top of that, a lot of songs are too long that made it an ordeal to get through. On the other hand, JT is a much better vocalist than I expected, even if it only showed on a handful of tracks.

**Lowest Scores:**

**jackisboredtoday** (10): Well, here we are at the song I know a LOT of us assumed was cruising to the well-deserved win, and I do theorize if people hadn't mentioned the triangle that's exactly what would have happened. Instead this still slayed and came extremely close to catching up in the end, but is relegated to a 2nd place finish. Nonetheless, this is an obvious 10 and one of the biggest hits of all time because its also one of the best songs of all time. That beat!!! That performance!! That Luda verse!!! All enough to make your booty go *clap*

**indie\_fan\_** (9): And your unexpected runner up! It was torture for me to just see everyone be so sure of this being the winner and knowing that it was only #1 for a few ballots. This is an undeniable club banger and the main song many people think of first when they hear Usher's name. I really like it except for the part that can never be ignored when talking about this song: That. Damn. Triangle. ISTG I never once thought about that shit until it was brought up to me a year or so ago and now it's all I hear. Also another thing that kinda gives me second-hand embarrassment is the "hold the head steady, imma milk the cow" line from Luda. Those things woulda gotten solved and it woulda been an instant 10 from me.

**babadork** (11): I couldn’t really consider anything else for my 11. “Yeah!” is too massive to not overshadow everything else.

**celladonn** (11): one of the best 00s club bangers. This combination of people is so fun

**CrimsonROSET** (11): at the end of the day the heart wants what it wants, and my heart wants lil jon to just go YEEEEEEEEEEAH sometimes

**flava** (11): it will also be my 11 in winners 4

**Frajer** (11): had to be the 11 Ersher Luda and Lil Jon were firing on all cylinders and I genuinely can't give an mvp on this one

**jsonphile** (11): what an iconic bop. Usher, Lil Jon, and Ludacris all bringing the voice, the beat, and the flow and making those booties go 👏

**PinkCadillacs** (11): ICONIC. I don’t care how many times I hear this song, it will always make me wanna dance.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): This is the one Chief!!! What a fuckin banger!!!! (That triangle is annoying tho lol)

**rosapalms** (11): The extra point is for Ludacris. Luda rarely if ever slacked on a guest appearance, but this is an embarrassment of riches. Plus, you know, the other two presences on the track to make ya booty go \[clap\]. We all know it’s going to win anyway.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): from a one to ten, this banger is a certified twenty

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): basic 11 is basic but like, come on…its yeah

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): YEAHHH

**welcome2thejam** (11): The ironclad grip this had on 2000s middle school youth

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): This would be a weird winner… like this isn’t exactly what I think of when I see these three albums together. But this is, in fact, the best song ever made, and a near irresistible ass shaking anthem, so I can’t exactly object. It’s slut music for whores only, who can say no to that?

**BeauMeringue212** (10): If someone ran for president on a "Put Ludacris on pop songs again" platform they would sweep

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Duh.

**Bordersz** (10): A pop classic. This beat is crazy. No matter the occasion...put this song on & the crowd will go wild.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’m usually mad when a song that’s quite different from the rate’s genre may win. Luckily, this is the ultimate 8th grade dance anthem for me so I HAVE to stan. The very loud triangle makes this experimental noise pop, actually

**daythreeinmiami** (10): yea yea yea, yea yea, YEAH

**DirtyRat583** (10): guys the triangle isnt THAT annoying now

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): the international primary school disco smash hit

**emayzee** (10): THEE party anthem of our lifetimes

**frogaranaman** (10): yeah!

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (10): This song has so much middle school nostalgia for me I love it so much

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the triangle player is an inspiration for all percussionists in high school. Also this is one of the GOAT songs, I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t think otherwise

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the biggest smasha of 2004 according to Billboard magazine’s year end list

**jaztinax** (10): iconic banger

**moonagenightmares** (10): instant flashbacks to this being literally everywhere

jackisboredtoday: **noavocadoshere** (10): yeah, yeah, yeah, y'all already knew what this was getting lol. not only would the taste committee come to my house with pitchforks and torches, my r&b AND pop cards would immediately self-destruct if yeah! got anything LESS than a 10. iconic.

**nt96** (10): someone put their whole triangussy into this and we thank them for it

**plastichaxan** (10): That was a classic

**popnbogo** (10): 📐

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): anything less than a 10 would be criminal. we need fun club bops back please im so sick of boring sad girl music!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Yeah!

**Roxieloxie** (10): I dont want this to win but its also kinda the best song ever and i cant not give it a ten. Im gonna be bitter when this sweeps by 28 points but im also going to be shaking my ass

**sarcasticsobs** (10): The triangle saves this song

**seanderlust** (10): Songs That Sample Yeah!: I Got Covid At A Rina Sawayama Concert And Am Now Homophobic by Pee! In The Pool ----- HELLO??????

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i'd be extremely surprised if this doesn't win. it's not dated, it absolutely goes off and is loved by all generations. my other 11 contender.

**thestoryteller13** (10): NOTHING MORE TO BE SAIDDDDDDD!!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): love an all time banger that also manages to fit in with the rest of the concept album. needed a second 11 for this. booty go triangle noises

**throwaway-7650** (10): rate winner

**TiltControls** (10): Yeah? Yeah!

**timothy444** (10): If there's one thing that music snobs love to nitpick about modern pop music, it has to be the lyrics and how they're written, especially if it's repetitive. I mean, at times that is a valid criticism but lyrics aren't always everything. Maybe people just like the beat or something. But I'm going off-topic here; "Yeah" by Usher is one certified banger and is such an incredible opening track for an album even though most people only know one word on that song. It's not just one word, it's how its chanted and its ability to get a party crowd going!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Wait….. you mean to tell me he's not saying "Every white girl best step off me"???

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (10): somehow NEVER occurred to me THIS song was in the rate...nor that it was named "YEAHHHHH!!! OHHHHKKKAKYYYYY". Like when I was 7-8 years old they were using this in fucking PBS Kids bumpers inbetween arthur and postcards from buster. I loved the one-note dipshit samples then. this song is perfect; a real "you can do NOTHING and it is music, and this is what we've all been leading to" moment. it deserves ALL the cookies and forehead kisses.

**xavieryes** (10): classic

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): now that was a classic

**sea-assumption-7403** (9.4): modern Pob&B party classic verse from ludacris & a Lil John feature who was everywhere in the 00s. Iconic track.

**martian\_pet** (9): Lil Jon do your thing!!!

**apatel27** (8): It's a decent track but if this is the highest scoring track of the album shut the sub down for hating R&B

**Dragusken** (8): The first song I think of when I think of 2000's clubbing vibes. The shouting lyrics add to the mood of the song, like Usher is getting hyped up to approach the chick at the club. However, I do wish it didn't sound as harsh.

**MassiveThief** (7): yeah

**Stryxen** (7): OKAAYYY

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6.5): the fatigue is real with this song… I wish I could give it a higher score but you COULD NOT escape this song in the 2000s

**fadedblue09** (6): Obviously iconic but tbh I was never a huge fan. Doesn't really represent the album very well and literally every other single is better

**IIIHenryIII** (0): I feel like this is just boomer Baby

**Overall Average**: 7.574 **// Average Controversy:** 1.720

indie\_fan\_: Yep, the album with the highest average out of the three and it definitely makes sense. Definitely a classic and laid the foundation for future r&b singers on themes, production vocal style, and a bunch more. Even though I probably prefer 8701 over this record, the standard edition doesn’t have a single skip for me, which is very impressive given its length.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.083): A near flawless album, has two dips for me. Otherwise, Usher at his peak and just casually being the King of R&B

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8.794): that's right usher, these are your confessions. all nearly 2 dozen of 'em that sorta frontloads too hard and perhaps is a chaffed up in its back half. But, the man do be shedding tears and what is here clearly works for car stereo systems, nail salons, teenage bedrooms, etc. Again, really made for car stereos and limited drives; you sink into this for too long it's gonna become a fatiguing "damn man why'd you write so many ditties?!" listen and we just don't want that, even though a lot of this is about as "no notes, usher, sir" as it could get.

**Bordersz** (8.639): This album needs to be in the Library of Congress. The impact and influence of this album is understated.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.317): I owned this on CD and do NOT remember it being this long, expanded edition or not

**welcome2thejam** (8.278): A bit better curating in the second half and this is an all-timer album. As is, it's still an overall great record that starts off with wall-to-wall classics

**TiltControls** (8.222): Fades a bit for me in the back half, but those first 7 songs are enough to support the rest

**nt96** (8.194): Classic 2000s album full of bops and slow jams, although it could've benefited from a cutting a few songs. Really takes me back to how controversial Confessions Part II was with everyone accusing Usher of cheating on Chili, the relationship falling apart and how that was worst thing he could've done. But guess what? It sold millions of records! And so, it laid the foundation of how success can generate through gossip, with albums like Lemonade proving that.

**sea-assumption-7403** (8.117): Going into this, I expected Usher to get my 11. So many of Usher’s hits are still in my regular rotation and I struggled with which song to give the 11 to. But maybe because I haven’t listened to the full album in some time, there were a few misses than I remember; the back half of the album slows down a bit for me. But the hits are still excellent and confirm Usher’s legacy as the singing, dancing, cutie king of the R&B and Pop&B genres. Whoever said Confessions is that girl, agreed, and will continue to be.

**thestoryteller13** (8.028): [An absolute classic. I've heard almost every song on this album but never in order and it definitely makes it better. Such a cohesive album and well deserving of its success. They really don't make albums like this anymore, I truly miss 2000's R&B.]

**fadedblue09** (7.944): I listened to this album back in 2021 and I definitely enjoyed it. I can see why it's regarded as an R&B classic, although I felt slightly bamboozled since I was expecting more confessional storytelling based on the title; instead, it was dominated by sex and love songs. Which isn't bad since Usher is a charismatic performer, but it could’ve helped this album become more consistent.

**jsonphile** (7.889): Absolute smash of an album. I do think it could have trimmed off a couple of songs in the later half of the album and it’d be stronger, but when it slaps, it really slaps. Usher is easily the best singer of these three, and this album shows he knows how to party, and how to take it slow, and can do both effortlessly. Some of the production on this album hasn’t aged all that well, but Usher’s voice still sounds amazing.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.883): Honestly this album still holds up extremely well. Great features, great vocals, great mix of genres between dance, r&b, funk and hiphop, and the hits still hit

**Dragusken** (7.778): Honestly, didn't know much aside from Confessions. Usher is nice but I think I prefer his singles more.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.778): full of bangers. A bit of an outlier compared to the other two as its more early 2000s when the others are more late 2000s in sound.

**PretentiousPegasus** (7.556): great album. some of the tracks are kinda cringe lyrically and feel like filler musically but when its good its good. deserves all the praise

jackisboredtoday: **Verboten\_Prince** (7.500): What makes a pop star? Listening to Confessions, I think I've come up with a possible answer: You have to be willing to embarrass yourself. Usher got up on the world stage and stated plainly loud and clear that he cheated and is gonna have an illegitimate kid, even though that wasn't his story, and yet he said it with such style and flair and confidence, people accepted him anyways. They even got down to his troubles! That's what a legend does. Risk making themselves look stupid in their attempt to push their artistry further and further. This album is great because Usher is an amazing performer, a charismatic personality, and a committed storyteller.

**DirtyRat583** (7.461): this was such a slog to get through. break count: 4

**rosapalms** (7.167): some unbelievably high highs on here, but the ballad deep cuts run together and don’t rise above “competent” for me. Granted, there’s nothing offensively bad here, either, but I probably won’t revisit the album as a whole.

**timothy444** (7.167): So we're just rating an album where Usher cheats on someone and then tries to have make-up sex with the same girl for five songs in a row? Yet, I prefer that album over the one where Ne-Yo is trying to m'lady for almost one hour.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.083): This one has a lot of bangers on it. I'm really diggin' this one.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.028): i think for a lot of people this album’s length is probably its biggest selling point, but to me it just comes off as its biggest weakness. theres a lot if filler tracks on here and i think if around 5-6 tracks were removed, it would’ve been a much better listening experience for me

**cremeebrulee** (7.000): this album is why i'm a misandrist

**IIIHenryIII** (5.733): even though I like Ne-Yo better, somehow I enjoyed this album more than YOTG. It’s very chill and soothing but far too long.

**MassiveThief** (5.222): too long, too monotonous, schnooze

**indie\_fan\_** (10): Man... I was really hoping for Closer to take the win. Did I expect it? Like most people, not really. But damn it, it's so well deserved. For almost the entire time of the rate it was winning and I was waiting for my hopes to be crushed and see Yeah! take its place in the end. But thankfully, it prevailed in the end as it looks like it's one that pretty much everyone in the rate agreed was at least good. So low controversy turned out to really help this song and I'm glad to see Ne-Yo walk away with the win after a lot of his other material here was done dirty.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): Whew, well I know this wasn't the presumed winner, but I'm actually really happy with this result. I knew this song was Ne-Yo's best case for being on even ground with the rest of the rate, but I didn't expect it to be winning almost the entire time, benefitting from the kind of extremely low controversy that comes from nobody giving the song under a 7, which frankly deserved!!! This is a classic and even though the top two is a battle of undeniable 10s I support the upset

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): This is my next 11 win! Clown make up is ON.

**Dragusken** (11): The echoic calls in the chorus work so well with the nature of the song, like a siren's call to come closer. The upbeat feel of the song with the echoic lyrics make it a song you can't help but sing along to. Overall, Neyo's musical flair here really added to the strength of the song and is worth an 11 for me.

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): I don’t trust you if you don’t have an absolutely ungodly amount of nostalgia for this song

**fadedblue09** (11): One of my favorite 2000s hits and just Stargate production at its peak: It's like the perfect bridge between their R&B and dance-pop sounds, and it blends both genres so seamlessly. On the top, Ne-Yo puts on a soulful but upbeat performance that just completes the song.

**impla77** (11): banger

**Stryxen** (11): oh this is a gentle MAN

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): easy 11 for me and if this makes the top 5 i'll be so happy!! absolute banger which unfortunately is pretty forgotten compared to justin and usher's hits, but personally i go back to this song more than anything else from these three albums and is one of my favourite pop-boy songs ever

**1998tweety** (10): ended those fad chainsmokers

**akanewasright** (10): I really do wonder how well this can do… would be a slay winner but it feels like it could get robbed a little

**CrimsonROSET** (10): what am i supposed to do not love this?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): greatest song of all time so true

**DirtyRat583** (10): me being able to hear the compression is annoying but its not that bad + this song is an iconic classic

**flava** (10): at least we have a closer guaranteed for AS7

**Frajer** (10): both Chainsmokers and Ne-Yo say they can't stop in their songs Closer really makes you think

**frogaranaman** (10): I’ll take “club songs I know every word to without consciously listening to the song” for $600

**IIIHenryIII** (10): have you ever had a celebrity whisper in your ear? ✔️

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is honestly the best song called Closer, i do not give a fuck

**jaztinax** (10): this song has crack in it. the way the chorus hits??? my gosh

**MassiveThief** (10): banger. love the instrumental and the chorus is KILLER

**noavocadoshere** (10): it took me a long time to stop rewinding "i can feel her on my skin/i taste her on my tongue/she's the sweetest taste of sin" part. we used to be a proper country when you could fall in love in the club.

=====

jackisboredtoday: **nt96** (10): a absolute timeless classic

**oscarbrierley1** (10): I'd forgot how much of a bop this song is. It's a shame the rest of the album doesn't really sound like it.

**plastichaxan** (10): Me with rates

**PretentiousPegasus** (10): the guitar and production on this is insane! crazy how everyone talks about how good early 00s r&b was but nobody talks about late 00s gems like this

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Another banger!! I love this one so much you have no idea.

**rosapalms** (10): Came so close to giving this my 11.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the material for the Closer rate is SO good, I just can’t pull myself away (from the repeat button)

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Honestly 1 of the only 2 Ne-Yo songs off this record I recognized when diving in (Yes, I don't remember "Mad", yell at me all you want!!). Still goes, classic chorus, really love the guitar, and very much enjoy that one synth/sound effect that pops up at first in the chorus immediately before the bridge (that I can't really describe, it's wonky though)

**sea-assumption-7403** (10): Still an absolute Bop.

**soul-glitch** (10): It sounds a little dated but slaps nonetheless

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): something something outsold the chainsmokers feat halsey

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): this could've been a hit any year between 2006 and 2013

**thestoryteller13** (10): Over ten decades later and this song still bangs

**throwaway-7650** (10): why are we rating midnight sky again? I'm not complaining though

**TiltControls** (10): I feel like I don't hear this discussed as much as many other hits of the late 2000s, but I don't see why. It's so incredibly sleek and catchy and I don't think I've seen anyone really hate this track (cue lowest scorers section below this). Though I think Justin and Usher are getting a lot of discussion I can see Ne-Yo dark horsing this.

**timothy444** (10): So not as iconic as "Closer" by The Chainsmokers and Halsey but it is still a massive 2000s banger and essential in any 2000s party playlist. It's just unfortunate that unlike Justin Timberlake's album here, "Closer" just feels very out of place and honestly makes the rest of the album sound terrible in comparison. Which is kinda hilarious, because the filler tracks definitely are. Also, you can sorta make the same argument with Usher because "Yeah" is a party song as well before going in a different tone but at least there's a concept regarding the album. The album as a whole, doesn't feel like it has structure. But anyway, probably the most upbeat song in the rate lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I'm a sucker for love songs that don't sound like love songs. Like this is all about how he wants to be with this girl but at the same time it sounds like a mental breakdown

**welcome2thejam** (10): I don't know if Ne-Yo can keep up anything close to this quality throughout this album, guess we'll find out. But no matter what happens, I can't deny the dude stepped up first at-bat and knocked it clear out of the park. Fantastic track.

**xavieryes** (10): timeless classic

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): bop!

**theonewithoutmynudes** (9.5): infectious! I forgot how much fun this song sounded

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): would've been perfect if the chorus had a little bit more boom

**PinkCadillacs** (9.4): This is both my favorite from the album and my favorite song from Ne-Yo in general.

**Roxieloxie** (9.2): What a banger

**Bordersz** (9): This came out in 2008? Idk why it firmly sounds like a 2013 song or something. It sounds more modern.

**cremeebrulee** (9): now that was a classic

**daythreeinmiami** (9): I JUST CAN’T STOP

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): this song just feels like 2006 (do not tell me it came out in 2008)

**emayzee** (8.7): this song just sounds like my green ipod nano

**heysoupie** (8.3): ok but why didn’t anyone tell me this song wasn’t by Usher

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8.2): it's got cute farty synths and pretty fickle bass.

**jsonphile** (8): me when I’m trying to eat healthy but there’s a delicious looking quart of ice cream in my freezer

**seanderlust** (7.3): (footage of me writing i will not make a chainsmokers joke over and over again on a chalkboard)

**Overall Average**: 7.114 **// Average Controversy:** 1.829

indie\_fan\_: Hands down my favorite album from this rate. Not a single slip for me. I believe more people like Ne-Yo’s debut album the most and while I do really like that record, there’s just a special flair about this album that pulls me in. All in all, I think Ne-Yo was done dirty here, but I am glad the sub got to experience him and he still did okay with the fact that he’s the least recognized artists out of the three on this sub.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.423): really no-skips on this album, might be one of my favorite R&B albums of all time now. I think it deftly blends emerging electropop sounds with R&B.

**nt96** (8.885): There isn't much I can say about this album, it's a very solid album nonetheless!

**fadedblue09** (8.885): One of my favorite male pop albums ever. The lush late 2000s R&B sound always gives me that nostalgic rush, and Ne-Yo is just one of my favorite male vocalists in general. I like that his music doesn't rely on typical masculinity tropes and instead just focuses on emotional, vulnerable songwriting (there's a reason why he ended up writing hits for some pop girls after all). I think those reasons can explain why I gravitated to his stuff the most.

**Dragusken** (8.769): I only knew a few songs coming into this but I can firmly say Neyo is my favorite of the three. Just the subject matter and musicality put him over the top for me.

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8.377): Well after 3 listens to the CD on the boombox in between room cleaning and tape tabulation and cataloging, I'm not tapping out of the Year of the Gentleman--it's always the year of the gentleman imo--although I'm respectfully turning away from my time with Ne-Yo. He seems like a nice dapper gentleman in all honesty, and his hat n' suit n' tie combo is pretty swag as my CD booklet points to (he also has some choreography I just have to guess for myself in my mind). But sonically, he finds himself making a 48 minute workhorse that isn't really exceptional, just merely really on point and good. He has a real mathematical execution, with his bells and whistles feeling more the result of adding bc "this shit sounds fire [and it does] and syncopates real nicely [which it does]" then truly feeling like left field personal detailing. that was never going to be the case though, was it? and honestly, a workhorse still gets the job done and kinda rules.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.192): The only album I had never heard before this rate outside of some singles, but the biggest surprise (speaking relatively, to my ratings) considering I remembered really enjoying the other two a lot when they came out and was unsure how this would compare. Fun "discovery". Never knew off his work on other artists' smashas, cool stuff

**rosapalms** (8.000): this was the only album I had been very familiar with front to back when I started this process, and it mostly holds up.

**thestoryteller13** (7.846): [I'm pretty familiar with this album already since it was one of my mom's road trip favorites, but I was super excited to give it another listen basically 14-15 years later with a more mature perspective (I was 4-5 lmfao) . I do still think it is heavily underrated, Ne-Yo is such a talented songwriter and the production on this album is amazing]

**TiltControls** (7.808): When I first saw the idea for this I thought Ne-Yo would be out of his element compared to the massive success of the other two. But I forgot how many iconic tracks actually came out of this album. Even the non-singles are full of life at times thanks to Ne-Yo's stellar charisma.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.769): 1999

**welcome2thejam** (7.538): Was kinda the wild card for me going into the rate, I'm way less familiar with his work. He definitely doesn't have the charisma carry potential or production benefits of either his competitors, but the songs on this particular album are generally solid enough to hold his own.

**sea-assumption-7403** (7.431): Knew all the hits and enjoyed them when they originally came out but I don’t think I had ever given the whole album a complete listen through. Overall a lot of bops, Ne-Yo’s crooning definitely makes some of the weaker songs still work. Overall a great Pop&B classic.

**PretentiousPegasus** (7.385): this was the first time I listened to this album in full. although the singles were great, I felt it had too much filler (although it definitely picked up in quality in the 2nd half!!). feelsbad for this man he doesnt stand a chance against Usher and JT

**babadork** (7.315): I hadn’t listened to this full album in years, and Ne-Yo was a bit more gentlemanly in my memories. Comparatively, he makes the best argument for him being boyfriend material of the three albums, but that isn’t the biggest accomplishment.

**jsonphile** (7.308): I like Ne-Yo, but he’s clearly the weak link of the three. He’s a good singer, but none of his songs I feel are absolute iconic bops, unlike Usher and Justin.

**cremeebrulee** (7.092): this album is why i'm a misandrist

=====

jackisboredtoday: **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.000): a bit uneven and falls off a bit towards the end but a nice listen

**DirtyRat583** (6.915): this is my favourite purely bc of the shorter runtime. god bless u ne-yo

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.769): I mean, I don't think Ne-Yo was trying to make as grand or iconic statements as Usher or JT, but his album is still a solid collection of bops, ballads, and jams. He knows how to craft the right hooks to get stuck in your head.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.385): so being a gentleman means being a decent human being, got it. Jokes aside, I don't think I'll be coming back to this. The singles truly are the only highlights here.

**Bordersz** (6.308): This whole album sounds way more modern to 2008 and aged a lot better than I expected with this revisit.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.115): I'd never listened to this album before. It was kind of what I expected from the work he's done for other artists. The lyrics are more male manipulator than Gentleman imo, especially in the middle where it gets a bit yikes.

**timothy444** (5.562): So there's this YouTube video where this guy ranks every Ne-Yo album from worst to best and this was at the end of the video. That should be a good indicator that I either have bad music taste or everyone else does (btw my top artist on my spotify wrapped is Machine Gun Kelly). Anyways, one of the most boring and bland R&B albums I've listened to and really the singles are the only stand-out tracks and that only applies to half of those singles as well!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.700): Outside of Closer, Nobody and (I guess) Miss Independent, this album is just meh.

**letsallpoo** (4.231): straight people are weird

TiltControls: Great job Jack and Darius (and also Roxie!) for the great reveal!! So glad we finally got to rate these iconic albums after so long.

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

It's been a long time coming, but we finally have a **Closer** rate winner (just, maybe not the one that's been appearing time and time again)

* With a 9.590, **Closer** becomes the 37th highest rated song of all time on the sub! It places right below Solange's Cranes in the Sky and right above Kendrick Lamar's i
* Closer also becomes the first song since the Hispanic Art Pop rate in 2021 to join the 7's club! (Songs that avoided getting a score below 7)
 * [The full list of tracks to accomplish this can be found here](https://pastebin.com/KJ64aiUH)
* With a 0.928 controversy, **Closer** becomes the 15th least controversial song on the sub
 * Now the entire top 25 has a controversy score lower than a 1.000 

For the other 9+ songs

* **Yeah!**: 42nd
 * Below: Jessie Ware - Spotlight (41st)
 * Above: Billie Eilish - Happier Than Ever (43rd)
* **What Goes Around.../...Comes Around (Interlude)**: 215th
 * Below: George Michael - Faith / Kanye West - Love Lockdown (213th)
 * Tied: Róisín Murphy - Murphy's Law / Genesis Owusu - The Other Black Dog (215th)
 * Above: Fergie (ft. will.i.am) - Fergalicious (281th)

## Artists

All 3 artists already had previous songs to put them on the leaderboard, though Usher and Ne-Yo was primarily through appearances in the odd grab-bag here and there. Artist ranks are out of 350

* 247th: Bleachers (7.249)
* **248th: Usher [PREV 321st] (7.248)**
* 249th: Alaska Thunderfuck (7.238)

-


* 267th: Alessia Cara (7.139)
* **268th: Justin Timberlake (7.131) [PREV 266th]**
* 269th: Kehlani (7.120)

-


* 287th: MisterWives (7.000)
* **288th: Ne-Yo (6.975) [PREV 310th]**
* 289th: Jess Glynne (6.968)

-

**Featured artist changes:**

* Timbaland: 3rd -> 12th
* Alicia Keys: 19th -> 16th
* Beyoncé: 161st -> 161st
* Ludacris: 248th -> 198th
* will.i.am: 340th -> 342nd
* T.I.: 350th -> 346th

**Other Artist Stats**

* On the highest rated artists leaderboard **Timbaland** drops to 12th place and **Alicia Keys** moves up to 16th
* **T.I.** goes from the 2nd lowest rated artist on the sub to the 6th lowest. 
 * LMFAO, The Vamps, Wiz Khalifa, and Kiiara all move up (down?) a spot in response
* **will.i.am.** joins the lowest rated artists list, going from not on the leaderboard to having the 9th lowest artist average
* **Beyoncé** joins the tie for first for most rate appearances, as this marks her 21st rate. The Weeknd and Ariana Grande both also have 21 apperances

## Albums

Due to albums only being recognized with the most common tracklists, Ne-Yo and Justin's iTunes bonus tracks are not counted for these averages. I left the Usher tracks in since the Deluxe album has a standard accepted version rather than just bonus songs for a single store-front, but if I'm misinterpreting that let me know and I can remove his bonus tracks as well.

Averages are out of 365 albums rated.


* 180th: Paramore - RIOT! / Demi Lovato - Don't Forget (7.578)
* **182nd: Usher - Confessions (7.846)** / Billie Eilish - Happier Than Ever (7.846)
* 184th: Carly Rae Jepsen - Dedicated Side B (7.841)

-

* 261st: MGMT - Little Dark Age (7.329)
* **262nd: Justin Timberlake - FutureSex/LoveSounds (7.323)**
* 263rd: BROCKHAMPTON - GINGER (7.318)

-


* 288th Bleachers - Strange Desire (7.185)
* **289th: Ne-Yo - Year of the Gentleman (7.180)**
* 290th: Britney Spears - Oops!...I Did It Again (7.178)

-

**Other album stats**

* By picking up 33.0% of the 0's available in the rate, **FutureSex/LoveSounds** joins the 0s magnets list for albums in 9th place
