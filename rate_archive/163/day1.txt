**jackisboredtoday** (6): Well I think we all knew this was about to be the first song out given how people talked about it. Luckily it was only a bonus track so if you dislike it then its easy to ignore, but the gap between this and the second song out surprised me. I know this is cringy but if you can ignore the lyrics and kinda justin‚Äôs falsetto its always felt more mediocre than disastrous to me. Also major lol that this was a iTunes exclusive originally and yet it isn't on Apple Music for some reason

**indie\_fan\_** (4): Yeah, y‚Äôall hated this one lol. And I don‚Äôt blame you really. I like the instrumentation well enough and the vocals don‚Äôt annoy me as much as a lot of others here, but those goddamn lyrics remind me of those cheesy ass, white fuckboy lines that just make you either do an eye roll or laugh because of how bad they are. Definitely my least favorite Justin song in this rate and prolly a blessing in disguise for Apple Music users that this is not available for them.

**noavocadoshere** (10): sometimes i reeeeeeally can't stand timberlake's inflections and how he says certain things, but this is sleek and polished.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): color me shocked that Justin ends the album on a note I really like, after so much of this album feeling like a total slog

**RandomHypnotica** (9): ok i don't see why this gets so much hate??? is it just because how he talks about boob and ass?

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): his vocals are particular gorgeous on this one, damn Justin

**sea-assumption-7403** (7.5): Lyrically kinda dumb but I really liked the production on this.

**BeauMeringue212** (7): ykw I'm not mad at his lil raspy voice. Though this sounds more like a Robin Thicke song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Uhhhhhhhhh. You know what it‚Äôs a camp 7.

**soul-glitch** (7): I would rate this higher but it's giving too much "holy fucking fuck that body is absurd"

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i kinda want to give this a low score bc it's not fucking on apple music but it's actually good so

**Bordersz** (6.5): Gorgeous harmonies on the chorus but lyrics are a bit ehh.

**babadork** (6.2): If this were to be reimagined as a kpop song, it might be a bop.

**Frajer** (6): need another shower

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Justin may have said ‚Äúwhere did you get your boobs?‚Äù but Usher would sing ‚Äúhoney got some boobies like wow oh wow‚Äù 4 years later so he didn‚Äôt even committee the worse boobs lyric crime out of artists in this rate!

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): I'm glad it didn't make the main tracklist

**Stryxen** (6): vocals are horrible but I'm sorry this is kinda fun

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): two "sexy"s made it in the extension for a final sex(y) counter of 67!

**jaztinax** (5): no sorry the fact that he said ‚Äúboobs‚Äù and ‚Äúbitch‚Äù in this song gave me the ick

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (5): wait this one sucks damnit T!

**welcome2thejam** (5): Needs an instrumental version

**dream\_fighter2018** (4.5): Justin Bieber has spent half of his career trying to recreate this

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (4): "You look like a cosmopolitan model so have a cosmopolitan cocktail" is such a bad lyric oml (not to mention the one afterwards about getting her drunk)

**ImADudeDuh** (4): [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/573328294204801035/1055175704049889310/image.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/573328294204801035/1055175704049889310/image.png)

**thestoryteller13** (4): Never saw this track on the album before but it's cute, I would probably skip though,

**seanderlust** (3.5): let's find out if the corn emoji works in rate ballots: :corn:

**emayzee** (3): this is reminding me of the bebe rexha "he loves alcohol more than this pussy" song

**fadedblue09** (3): what did they do with his vocals here üíÄ

**heysoupie** (3): dull and corny

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): is this REALLY what you wanna end your album on

**vayyiqra** (3): lol what the hell are these lyrics

**cremeebrulee** (2.5): BOOBS?

**akanewasright** (2): Justin‚Ä¶ [sometimes it‚Äôs not your turn to talk](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/857436302805565441/1048825998822613032/image0.jpg)

**Dragusken** (2): And‚Ä¶the cringe is back at full force. I'm also a bit confused about the 8-bit sounding back instrumental. But yeah the fkboi sounding lyrics really just don't do it any favors. The vocals sound nice but just‚Ä¶the lyrics‚Ä¶ya no. Really seems from a bodega from hell rather than a boutique in heaven‚Ä¶just saying‚Ä¶

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Starting to realize that the quality of these songs is inversely related to how aggressively Justin says the word "girl"

**amr** (1): frown

**impla77** (1): hey justin.. I don‚Äôt think you should be asking a woman where she got her boobs from

**oscarbrierley1** (1): no just no. The lyrics are so cringy.

**1998tweety** (0): this is so embarrassing

**celladonn** (0): is he fucking serious with this shit

**CrimsonROSET** (0): how the fuck is this what we‚Äôre ending this great rate on

**nt96** (0): he wants to be Jamiroquai so bad

**OutrageousWorldTour** (0): I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶.what. This is the cringe-y JT of Can‚Äôt Stop the Feeling and Filthy. I would‚Äôve kept this in the vault and never release it.

**Roxieloxie** (0): indie kitchen voice

**sarcasticsobs** (0): Christ.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (0): we are once again toeing the line between this and a Lonely Island song

**TiltControls** (0): this sounds like they just compiled a list of the 50 worst pickup lines and made justin sing it as creepily as he could

**xavieryes** (0): Somehow this is the first time I hear this song and tbh I hate it. Glad it's not on the main tracklist lol

**Highest scores:**

(10 x1) Dragusken

(9.9 x1) noavocadoshere

(9 x2) darjeelingdarkroast, omgthenerve

(8.8 x1) WaneSexyBacktoc

(8.5 x3) apatel27, fadedblue09, thestoryteller13

(0 x8) cremeebrulee, DirtyRat583, green\_hair\_dont\_care, ImADudeDuh, letsallpoo, moonagenightmares, throwaway-7650, TragicKingdom1

**indie\_fan\_** (8.4): I mean, I get why this didn‚Äôt do well. I understand that it can get dull plus that dishwasher line is kinda ???. This is definitely my least favorite song on YOTG which I‚Äôm not sure is really saying all that much considering I still give it a pretty solid score. Idk, I guess I just like that self-acknowledgement that he ain‚Äôt shit and bring aware that she could easily do better than him.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.5): well realizing the problem is step 1 Shaffer, now its time to do something instead of self-pity

**Dragusken** (10): An anthem for all those who feel like the one they love deserves the world and the stars yet feel like they're not doing enough. The emotion behind the lyric "Why does she stay?" feels like a retrospective whisper to the heart, poking at the heartstrings of the lovesick listener.

**noavocadoshere** (9.9): i'm screaming at how much of a self-drag this is. but i also love self-introspection. i hate how much i love this ain't sh anthem. i know it's 2008 but a semi-futuristic beat w. lasers on a song about being terrible to your partner is...a choice.

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8.8): cornball banger. dude, I will come to your house and help you with dishes/help your boo. yr both worthy 4 each other i bet.

**apatel27** (8.5): This is a nice back to back to Miss Independent

**fadedblue09** (8.5): There's something addictive about how the beat suddenly pauses every second

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Lyrics examining the lack of fair division of housework and emotional labor in relationships? The way this album is actually a feminist manifesto like‚Ä¶

**emayzee** (7.8): that entire first verse about not doing dishes is very me coded

**Bordersz** (7.5): SHE'S SO MUCH BETTA THAN MEE

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): why don‚Äôt you just try to be a better person instead of wondering why she‚Äôs still with you? Like you know what the problems in this relationship are, try and fix them instead of singing about how terrible you are! The keys are in the ignition, TURN THEM!!

**RandomHypnotica** (7): probably cause you're Ne-Yo

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Low self-confidence anthem. Liked the strings that came in near the end

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): if you start any song with the line ‚Äúshe hates that i dont do dishes‚Äù youre just BEGGING for me to laugh

**1998tweety** (6): I'm bored

**CrimsonROSET** (6): in theory this is cute but like hey maybe you try and step up to the playing field big guy?

**Frajer** (6): why does this sound like The Weeknd

**heysoupie** (6): is this supposed to be ironic? I thought this song was going to be some sad sack anthem pining from afar for a woman trapped in an abusive relationship & wanting to rescue her but‚Ä¶this is just a song about admitting he is a scumbag boyfriend??

**jsonphile** (6): Ne-Yo you lazy fuck do the goddamn dishes

**Roxieloxie** (6): no because why is she staying like you're not making a good case for yourself

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): she hasn‚Äôt heard No Scrubs yet, that‚Äôs why

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Finally, a love song for my parents

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): Ne-Yo king of the simps

**babadork** (5): This is depressing. I kept expecting something about wanting to change, but he just goes on about how his girlfriend will stay with him even if he‚Äôs not a good boyfriend.

**impla77** (5): I have no clue, sunken cost fallacy?

**martian\_pet** (5): Man wash the damn dishes

**seanderlust** (5): ne-yo writing a song about how bad he feels that he doesn't do the dishes in well over the time he could have taken to y'know...do the dishes...

**MassiveThief** (4.5): the constant simping is starting to get old

**PretentiousPegasus** (4): good vocals but this was so boring

**soul-glitch** (4): Bruh stfu and do the dishes

**theonewithoutmynudes** (4): this felt like it was just going to be an interlude but it just kept going

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): good question

**welcome2thejam** (4): After hearing all that? I'm asking too wtf

**daythreeinmiami** (3.9): I‚Äôll admit, I am not the biggest fan of slow tempo RnB. I‚Äôm in a fast-paced environment and I gotta go fast mkay? So what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I zoned out and that‚Äôs enough for me to know this song is boring. I liked the bridge slightly.

**akanewasright** (3): he did NOT drink his respect women juice when he wrote this

**sea-assumption-7403** (3): Musically it‚Äôs nice but I can‚Äôt with why does my gf stay w/ my raggedyass loser self lyrics.

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): not the learned incompetence :/

**BeauMeringue212** (2): Cos you're rich Neyo, that's literally it

**celladonn** (2): This is pretty boring and I know it's trying to be introspective and emotional but it just comes off as kind of pathetic

**jaztinax** (2): not him starting the first verse with ‚Äúshe hates that i don‚Äôt do dishes‚Äù‚Ä¶ absolutely hate men saying how much better their partner is than them, this song is the ultimate ick

**oscarbrierley1** (2): male manipulator anthem. The woe is me I'm so terrible to my girlfriend lyrics do not work for me.

**Stryxen** (2): He's like the kind of guy who stands next to women in public and loudly says Yah I'm just really passionate about women's rights and like the wage gap. Also this is boring and annoying

**IIIHenryIII** (1): who's gonna punch him???

**sweetnsoursauce11** (1): boy instead of complaining DO BETTER how u gonna follow up miss independent w this bullshit. it's not catchy enough to make up for the stupid content

**cremeebrulee** (0): my guy are you bringing anything to the table

**DirtyRat583** (0): balladphobia ACTIVATE

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (0): If my partner didn't help out around the house and instead just wallowed in their own self-pity all day, my ass would be out the door

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this is like... Shawn Mendes - Treat You Better but from the perspective of the asshole boyfriend?? What the fuck???????

**letsallpoo** (0): why would he 1) admit to this 2) write a song about this and 3) put this in an album called year of the gentleman???

**moonagenightmares** (0): wtf are these lyrics ctfu i hate men

**throwaway-7650** (0): this was traumatic to listen to... he's so pathetic omg

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this plays at the super weenie hut jr

(1.5 x1) moonagenightmares

(1 x2) realitykenz, sarcasticsobs

(0 x3) darjeelingdarkroast, impla77, Saison\_Marguerite

**indie\_fan\_** (8): This song is kind of a guilty pleasure for me lol. The vocals are‚Ä¶ a choice. But I still love it for some reason plus that beat slaps. Will.I.am. coulda just stayed behind the scenes since his verse definitely was not needed here. Besides that, I‚Äôm but but this is a jam even though I get why it‚Äôs hated on.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.5): the chorus is what I say when a woman asks me which Kendrick album earned him his 2nd #1 hit after the bad blood remix

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Damn boys

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (9.2): wait this song was only meant to sort of possibly work live, with a delirious fantasy in justin timberlake's hedonistic ragtag cornball utopia. sorta just a perfect vibe there where he and his pals dance in the middle of the stage while he runs around in a fedora and gets knocked by ladies who are wearing minimal clothing

**sea-assumption-7403** (9): Love the retro beat and it‚Äôs great with JT‚Äôs voice. Was originally feeling will.i.am fatigue just from seeing his name but I‚Äôve enjoyed the song more with each listen.

**noavocadoshere** (7.5): justin shouldn't have gone with softer vocals here, but will.i.am was an absolute perfect feature. love his vibe + the psychedelic/funky production here enough.

**TiltControls** (7.5): getting a will.i.am feature is basically flipping a coin for quality. lucky for justin it landed here

**xavieryes** (7.5): I discovered the word "damn" through this song lol

**MassiveThief** (7): now THAT is some sensual falsetto

**Stryxen** (7): good fun

**thestoryteller13** (7): Love the feature and vibe of this one.

**heysoupie** (6.8): decent

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): poetry here

**plastichaxan** (6.5): Thank god I was scared this album was all hits (Still decent though)

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): damn girl, wtf are you on about

**Frajer** (6): this is what every Ed Sheeran song sounds like to me

**apatel27** (5): His voice is really badly mixed here

**ImADudeDuh** (5): idk why but I can see ‚Äúblack eyed peas‚Äù and think ‚Äúoh yeah they were around in the early 00s‚Äù but seeing just ‚ÄúWill.i.am‚Äù makes me think ‚Äúwtf he was already making music back then?‚Äù and I can‚Äôt explain why

**jsonphile** (5): will.i.am is so bad he brings this down two whole numbers

**nt96** (5): It started out with that cool beat, then the Damn Girl refrain got me like "ok move on", then will.i.am came on and I just lost it lol

**oscarbrierley1** (5): naming the brands makes me cringe so bad, I hope maybelline and lorielle were paying.

**rosapalms** (5): the vocal effect on this is so annoying, pass

**seanderlust** (5): "Woo-woo-woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo-woo" - will.i.am.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Did not need to hear will.i.am "uwuwuwu"-ing at me today

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): sorry im like. so insanely distracted by 0:31 in this song it sounds like he‚Äôs saying the f slur and i can not unhear it no matter how many times i read the lyrics

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i did not think i‚Äôd ever utter the words ‚Äòsaved by will i am‚Äô and yet

**daythreeinmiami** (4): What is will.i.am DOING? He sounds like the Valentino White Bag lady. [https://youtube.com/shorts/IzTlPjgJfTk?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/IzTlPjgJfTk?feature=share)

**Dragusken** (4): This song reminded me of Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines‚Ä¶that's really really unfortunate. The musicality of the chorus redeems it slightly but the shouting just puts me off here. Just woah-woah-woah, it's a no-no-no for me.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i don't love justin's upper register sorry

**timothy444** (4): will.i.am wrote this? Gee, I wonder how I can tell.

**welcome2thejam** (4): There's a path here to a solid retro bop, and instead they threw away the map and drove off a cliff

**Bordersz** (3.5): Very boring, sounds dated and is OK. Waiting for it to be over.

**akanewasright** (3): girl

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This almost loops back around to being a camp high score. But it does not.

**cremeebrulee** (3): this song is overstimulating me i need to lie down

**fadedblue09** (3): Percussion is üî•‚Ä¶.wish the vocals were someone else's though

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): Teletubbies did it better

**DirtyRat583** (2): what is this doing here. who approved this????? this is literally clown music

**theonewithoutmynudes** (2): points deducted for the phrase ‚Äúfeminine gelatin‚Äù

**sarcasticsobs** (1): This took me out and annoyed me so badly that I lost the same tera raid battle in Pok√©mon twice in a row

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): feel like i‚Äôm in a Target ad from hell

**impla77** (0): Why are the verse lyrics repeated when they‚Äôre so bad in the first place? This was so bad that I had it pegged it as a zero before will.i.am came in

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): I hoped for more of a shamelessly obnoxious bop from will.i.am, this was just exhausting in a boring way

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Well, I get why this did so poorly. Cosplaying as a drug addict named bob here is just?? Especially in the context of this album. Label prolly wanted some last minute type of song from JT. I say all of that and I still like this song‚Ä¶ Idk flaws aside, I don‚Äôt really pay attention to the lyrics themselves all that much and just chill.

**jackisboredtoday** (0): fucking ‚Äúmy name is bob and i work at my job‚Äù ass lyrics‚Ä¶. this is bottom five and I still think it went too far, I don‚Äôt mind an attempt to toss on an ‚Äúissue‚Äù song but it has to be confident

**rosapalms** (10): somebody should have warned me about this one. I didn‚Äôt have ‚ÄúJustin Timberlake deep cut make me cry at my desk at work‚Äù on my 2023 bingo card, but here we are. I honestly didn‚Äôt realize that Justin could have this level of gravitas

**Bordersz** (9): Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): his most underrated song

**timothy444** (9): My ears exploded with taste as soon as the gospel choir bit happened

**1998tweety** (8): I am going to church

**Dragusken** (8): Anddddd, we're back to the cringefest (not as bad at least). Emanating finance bro vibes with the first spoken art of the song. Once we get to the chorus, the lyrics redeem it slightly, almost making me feel I was listening to something from Hadestown. The song topic works well with the music after the initial part and the instrumentals are nice. Though the grand climax does feel a bit cringy again. Not bad overall though.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): the choir saves this song

**jaztinax** (8): not sure how this fits in with futuresex/lovesound but it‚Äôs a solid song nonetheless

**OutrageousWorldTour** (8): ‚ÄúHi, my name is Bob and I work at my job‚Äù was so funny when I was a 10-year-old in 2006 and now I have become Bob.

**TiltControls** (8): Production's not as notable as the rest of the album, but Justin's performance is strong enough to get it a good score

**celladonn** (7.5): hi my name is bob and i work at my job

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ‚Äúhi my name is bob, I work at my job‚Äù is such a funny opener for a sad ballad ‚ò†Ô∏è

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): this song is such a ??? Choice for this album which is about love and heartbreak. Like okay let‚Äôs sing about Bob who had a drug addiction and is struggling but throw it on this album about how I‚Äôm bringing sexy back

**babadork** (6.5): This is very out of character for me, but I like the gospel choir. I‚Äôm not sure about the rest of it.

**oscarbrierley1** (6): this song always feels like such a random departure from the rest of the album. Its so serious.

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (6): his anti-crack song is pretty middle of the road but he's real for this one. brings a choir out on stage in the madison square garden video. it becomes "white man gospel", which is not the same as indie gospel. u/Tadevos I'm calling you in to confirm this.

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (5): Honestly was not expecting a song about the struggle of poverty and drug addiction in this album

**sarcasticsobs** (5): idk Timberlake doing a "character" not really doing much for me. Even cheating by using strings is not bumping this up from a 5

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): his name is bob and he works at his job ü•∫

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): oh hi bob

**theonewithoutmynudes** (4): I feel like these lyrics might fit with a very different arrangement, specifically timbaland‚Äôs vocals in the background are muddying this song

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): the blueprint for Say Something

**throwaway-7650** (4): no1curr about your roleplaying fantasies bob. I mean justin

**vayyiqra** (4): This does not belong on this album

**bigbigbee** (3): not his fault, it was over 20 years ago, but this type of messaging around addiction is imo trite and not helpful generally

**CrimsonROSET** (3): why is there a random drug psa in this album

**impla77** (3): lyricism off the charts

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): i just don't think there's any reason for this song to be over five minutes long

**welcome2thejam** (3): The choir section is the only reason this isn't lower, absolutely dull

**cremeebrulee** (2): we gotta keep childrens choruses away from men not named michael angelakos

**PinkCadillacs** (2): My least favorite song on the album and this whole rate. I just can‚Äôt get into this song personally.

**thestoryteller13** (2): I like the message but I usually always skip it. Heard it enough in health class in high school lol.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): did not ask for conscious Justin Timberlake no ma‚Äôam. Don‚Äôt listen to this, just put on the superior track Dilated Peoples ‚ÄúThis Way‚Äù [https://youtu.be/Rbo9QlcLcX8](https://youtu.be/Rbo9QlcLcX8)

**daythreeinmiami** (1): This sounds like a ‚ÄòKids, don‚Äôt do drugs!‚Äô PSA and I can‚Äôt take it seriously. Drugs in moderation kids. Avoid meth tho.

**noavocadoshere** (1): i'm a terrible person bc i laughed at forty-something dollars a day. like, justin...please. must bob not only make minimum wage (which you're already uncertain about), but also have every other horrible thing happen to him? addiction. family left him. it's okay to have a majority of lighthearted/fun tracks on albums heavily about sex, relationships and love, y'all. i promise.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (1): Justin is not the deep storyteller he thinks he is here‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre going to speak for the struggling working man as a rich pop star, you better sell the character‚Äôs pain and he doesn‚Äôt

**akanewasright** (0): bruh

**amr** (0): he saw that "name a famous bob" tweet and just started saying anything

**BeauMeringue212** (0): I'm sorry but this failed ballad with Justin Timberlake cosplaying as a poor CRACK ADDICT?! This is unforgivable üò≠

**sea-assumption-7403** (0): Hi my name is Bob. No. Was this song designed for a just say no to drugs school special. The inclusion of this song feels weird and out of place on album of sexyback chop me up and other fun sexy bops.

**seanderlust** (0): honest to god why is this here. why is the story of bob with a drug addiction on an album called FutureSex/LoveSounds

**Stryxen** (0): WHAT is THIS

(1 x2) amr, thisusernameisntlong

**indie\_fan\_** (7.5): another song that makes sense as bottom 5. Honestly, I‚Äôm okay with the ballad phobia here. I like it a good amount, but it does drag on a bit too loving for my taste, but it does make sense as a closer to this album to an extent.

**jackisboredtoday** (7): I don‚Äôt know why this pre-chorus sounds so familiar but I swear I‚Äôve heard it somewhere even though I have no idea why since it wasn‚Äôt a single. Anyway, I get why this went out because it‚Äôs a ballad and not the truest standout of the album but this is the first exit I could‚Äôve seen push a little higher

**jaztinax** (10): would be my 11 if i wasn‚Äôt so passionate about my other 11. underrated gem!!! the perfect r&b ballad!!! although minus for saying ‚Äúlittle girl‚Äù in the bridge like boy what?

**MassiveThief** (10): oh he's singin straight from the soul. on god.

**noavocadoshere** (10): a simple piano ballad asking for another closer chance? best way to close the album. i mean, i'd be a hater if i denied this anything less than a ten, even if that little girl line made me visibly frown bc it's so awk :( still a ten.

**throwaway-7650** (10): why is he so good at closers (I've heard 2)

**xavieryes** (10): balladphobia will probably ruin this song's performance which is unfortunate because it's great

**PretentiousPegasus** (9): the one exception to my balladphobia

**sea-assumption-7403** (8.9): A nice ballad and really worked with JT‚Äôs vocals.

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (8.6): "I wake up every morning and I can't believe this is my job. It's so FUCKING cool! Now I don't wanna get cheesy on you, cuz that's not the new yawk standahd, but I never imagined I, a kid who grew up outside Memphis, TN would be able to travel the world and I owe it all to you, so thank you" -justin T, madison square garden 2007. anyways this song fucking slaps in the live performance, just feels like a loungey ditty that the steely dan brain trust coulda taken to an 11, but it's an 8.6.

**Dragusken** (8): Simple-spoken and the instrumentals give me classic Mo-town/Dreamgirls vibes. Pretty nice overall and a nice deviation from the cringy fkboi tracks in the earlier parts of the album.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I guess JT needed a pure vocal moment but this feels like an afterthought

**seanderlust** (7.5): it's a nice enough ballad/slow jam. i do like the instrumental quite a bit.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what justin so you can fuck me at the top of the stairs again

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Typical-ass ending song ballad but not bad

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this is the Boys will be Boys of the album

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): it doesn‚Äôt fit on the album, why nobody told him that? neither does losing my way, but whatever

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6.5): a sincere ballad but it felt like it was really going to flourish at the end but sort of just fizzled out

**1998tweety** (6): bored

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Stop saying "little girl", you freak!! You are grown!!

**Stryxen** (6): cute but it kinda forgets it's a song by the end

**Bordersz** (5.5): Too long.

**akanewasright** (5): This is nice ig but man‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like this way more if someone with a bit more substance to their voice sang it

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): this is the sort of a song that a man sings in the corner of your room while trying to convince you to take him back

**nt96** (5): it sure is another song

**welcome2thejam** (5): Competent

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): damn right it's another song can this album end already

**plastichaxan** (4): Why did he decide to be boring he can‚Äôt pull it off go back to the horny bangers

**TiltControls** (4): for an album that leans so heavily on its stellar production this is just lacking in every way imaginable. even as a piano ballad it's not very interesting

**daythreeinmiami** (3): This isn‚Äôt sexy time music Justin. This is meant to be a sexy time album. The last two songs have dried everyone up they declared a worldwide drought.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): zzzz

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): this tempo is achingly slow. As someone who‚Äôs not keen on JT‚Äôs vocal tone this is a very unpleasant listen for me

**impla77** (2): god this is boring as shit

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2): literally snoozing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): yep, this sure is another song

**amr** (1): snnnoooooooooork mimimimimi

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): I miss the future sex sounds

**indie\_fan\_** (9): now come on, this was definitely robbed. For it to be the first usher song out??? I don‚Äôt get people. Maybe it‚Äôs just be being a sucker for Usher‚Äôs falsetto a lot of the time, but this absolutely deserved better and is a peak love-making anthem

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): Usher loses his first song here and as much as I enjoy his album I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm too surprised this was an early cut, it comes deep into the back end of the album and the production especially feels like it lets him down here

**theonewithoutmynudes** (10): my favorite vocal performance on the album - a sexy song that didn‚Äôt do too much unlike TWIMF

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A much better execution of a sexually explicit track than That's What It's Made For

**CrimsonROSET** (8): TOP OF THE STAIRS?!

**sarcasticsobs** (8): lmao Nobu name-drop. Anyway, cool percussion

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I wanna sing like Usher man

**welcome2thejam** (8): The front third of this album is so good that I have no choice but to allow this super h\*rny victory lap

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Featuring the Thwomp from Mario as the thuds in the production.

**jaztinax** (7.5): simple but effective

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): every r&b artist has their prince rip off song, this is usher's. It's cute but nothing special.

**akanewasright** (7): This is nice but I‚Äôm both like. ‚ÄúHmm this sonically feels like an album closer kind of‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad this isn‚Äôt the album closer because lyrically this would be a weird closer‚Äù

**ignitethephoenix** (7): maybe cause it‚Äôs Christmas Eve but this gives Christmas music energy

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (7): yup it's another usher ditty

**DirtyRat583** (6.8): i swear ive heard this kick somewhere in fl studio

**noavocadoshere** (6.5): if there was baby boom in '04 that resulted in a ton of sag/cap babies, i don't want to say confessions was the sole culprit but it definitely had a hand in it.

**TiltControls** (6): the falsetto is super impressive, but honestly it gets a bit tiring for being most of the song

**Dragusken** (5): Feels a bit too simplistic to me and not too much a fan of the melody.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): damn the songs get in a glut after Bad Girl

**throwaway-7650** (5): imagining a timeline where usher was a hs/ms sex ed teacher

**timothy444** (5): this is the third song in a row about you trying to bone a woman, rather explictly in fact

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): i think i just heavily dislike when usher goes in falsetto

**RandomHypnotica** (4): what in the melanie martinez is this nursery rhyme instrumental

**impla77** (3.7): Resisting the ace urge to rate this even lower

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): the album was doing so well for me but this falsetto over a MIDI keyboard playing ‚ÄúOne is the Loneliest Number‚Äù is not doing it for me

**IIIHenryIII** (3): sounds ugly

**Stryxen** (3): pfft what is he even doing

**heysoupie** (2.5): is this also a hornier song?

**daythreeinmiami** (2): That kick is terrible the bridge key change Usher does is terrible. Nelly Furtardo did it MUCH better. Stream ‚ÄòDo It‚Äô by Nelly Furtardo.

**thestoryteller13** (2): Idkk this one gives lullaby. I can hear the Prince influences maybe but I couldn't get into it.

**indie\_fan\_** (8.8): yeah this makes sense as a day 1 cut. Like it well enough, but I still think it falls a tad short of the other deep cuts on this record, with the hook not being as good as it coulda been.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.5): I want to like this more but the conversation interludes make it so I could never want to hear this outside the context of the album, and that‚Äôs before getting into a couple truly corny lines

**amr** (10): excuse my language but they could use this song in \[DATA EXPUNGED\] and it'd probably work

**Bordersz** (9): It is a little too sensual for me, but this is how you make a "sexy" without being cringe-y or fake.

**seanderlust** (9): oooooh filthy. i love it

**thestoryteller13** (8.5): sexyyyyy

**akanewasright** (8.3): \[points at earlier songs\] and THAT kids, is why you use a condom, even if you think it‚Äôs hotter to go in raw

**1998tweety** (8): sensual bop

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I feel like I need a shower

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ‚Äúraw dog is a never‚Äù wonder how he learned that rule?

**soul-glitch** (8): I really wish I didn't like this song but I do

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): me when i ask why my boyfriend is washing dishes instead of using the dishwasher

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (7.8): he's gonna freak it omg

**TiltControls** (7.5): some of these tracks are full of charisma and seduction and then are titled like an explanation in a wikihow article

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7.3): points deducted for the phrase ‚Äúnut up‚Äù and the softcore spoken word interlude before the last chorus

**babadork** (7.2): It loses a point because I can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre using a condom by the end of the song or not.

**BeauMeringue212** (7): "Rawdog is a never" Girl just get on PrEP

**CrimsonROSET** (7): LET USHER SAY FUCK

**OutrageousWorldTour** (7): I want to go back in time and be a fly on the wall for the writing sessions for this one. It‚Äôs not a bad song, but who suggested the idea of a pro-condom song?

**plastichaxan** (7): Superorganism stans after listening to their music and feeling something

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this flute sample is so distracting nfkfhskagkanflh

**welcome2thejam** (7): Thank GOD I didn't play this part of the album for my work carpool

**sea-assumption-7403** (6.5): I like a good dirty song (all my favorite Weeknd tracks) but there‚Äôs a lot of heavy breathing in this one

**daythreeinmiami** (6): The production is very crisp but the lyrics do have me reacting like this.

**Dragusken** (6): Aside from the instrumentals, the song feels lackluster to me.

**frogaranaman** (6): bro shut up üò≠

**moonagenightmares** (6): love the prod but these lyrics‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

**rosapalms** (6): hahahahhahahah what the fuck

**fadedblue09** (5): I appreciate Usher's efforts to make this song tolerable but this is just very cringeworthy

**nt96** (5): Only Janet can make seduction sound so pleasant. You're not Janet, have a seat.

**PretentiousPegasus** (5): idk what went wrong in this song the whole confessions album is sexy but this song veers into r/ihavesex vibes

**timothy444** (5): Well, I'm definitely not jamming this song when I'm using it in the bedroom

**noavocadoshere** (4.5): this is such a WEIRD song. just about condom use/safe sex? would've been higher, esp. given the context of the early 00s. but then the second verse and the interlude???

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): um. usher's really bad at taking his own advice

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i hate spoken words in songs it gives me the biggest ick. production slaps tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): "We got protection" Usher remind me what happened seven songs ago

**heysoupie** (3): omg have i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôve ever heard a hornier song

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Yeah, I can't deal with this, especially THAT one part

**impla77** (2.5): There was a lot of things this could‚Äôve been about.. I managed to guess correctly though

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Boring and nasty. Perfect recipe for a 0.

**oscarbrierley1** (0): the lyrics are direct but not direct enough to be fun. It's like uncanny Valley where they just make me feel uncomfortable.

**indie\_fan\_** (9): I‚Äôm not gonna be here and act surprised about this being out so early, but this was still a solid track for me. Not exactly the same magic Miss Independent had which is the issue with calling it the remix to that song, when you compare the two, it doesn‚Äôt hold up to that same level. Even so, this is still a great bonus track to me, with the exception of Fabulous‚Äôs verse which feels a tad out of place at times.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): We lose our first single of the rate here, and while I liked it when I was first discovering this album, I do get how the sample can be unappealing. This did grow off me a little after I‚Äôd known it for a few years so even though I think it‚Äôs solid, I can‚Äôt be too annoyed that it goes out here.

**amr** (10): donna summer finger heart

**apatel27** (10): Miss Independent so good it needed a sequel

**rosapalms** (10): this track is unbelievably stupid in the best way. It feels like Ne-Yo, Jamie, and Fab just got in the studio, popped bottles, and just had fun. The result is just warm, funny, and beautiful to the ear. S/o to Fabolous for ‚ÄúI had to ask what she doing in that caddy / she said ‚Äòsince you my baby I be stuntin‚Äô like my daddy‚Äù

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (9.5): this video fucks and if I had mr. jamie foxx on standby I would always be bringing him to the ladies to show them how much i care for remixes etc

**Dragusken** (9): Miss Independent's sultry, mature counterpart. Despite concerning the same theme as Miss Independent, it has a much more lowkey vibe, like someone who's appreciative of the independent queen he already has. I like this song a decent amount. However, Miss Independent's energy in comparison is more apt in my opinion.

**Roxieloxie** (9): this entire album is neyo like 'i fucking love women who dont ask me for shit'

**sea-assumption-7403** (8.8): How many songs about independent women in the 00s are there? And are independent women now not interesting song subjects anymore? Where‚Äôs my independent woman anthem now that I‚Äôm in the age range to have my aforementioned independence sung about? And why doesn‚Äôt Jamie Foxx do music anymore?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): sorry i won't apologise for enjoying #girlboss songs, esp when they are catchy ones. like that piano ugh

**CrimsonROSET** (8): girlboss

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): gotta tip my fedora to ol‚Äô Shaffer rn

**PinkCadillacs** (7.9): This should‚Äôve been on the original track list of the album instead of being a bonus track.

**Stryxen** (7.5): terrible and corny. But kinda good

**theonewithoutmynudes** (7.3): if a condensed version of this was added to Miss Independent (a la 20/20 experience) I think I would have given the combined entity of those songs a higher score, but on its own this song is fine too

**martian\_pet** (7.2): Of course you love it when she says I got it, you don't want to do anything

**1998tweety** (7): girlboss

**cremeebrulee** (7): just say you‚Äôre broke like there's women who don't mind

**Frajer** (7): Miss Independent was great as is and didn't need a remix

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (7): WAIT JAMIE FOXX IS A SINGER TOO???

**welcome2thejam** (7): The little fake superhero theme they hum after "captain save em" got me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): You are NOT Miss Independent but you‚Äôre a decent knock-off.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): i genuinely cant tell if this is supposed to be a remix or if it‚Äôs its own thing

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): not donna summer getting the beach house treatment

**TiltControls** (6.5): This song would be so much better without that weird pitched up wail in the background

**babadork** (6.2): I‚Äôm already not a big fan of ‚ÄúMiss Independent‚Äù and cutting the lyrics really emphasizes what I don‚Äôt like about the lyrics. It becomes even less about being attracted to women that are career-driven and more about being attracted to women that appear to be wealthy.

**impla77** (6.2): Did we need a Jamie Foxx Miss Independent follow up

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this feels like it‚Äôs almost a miss independent remix

**PretentiousPegasus** (6): this took me embarrassingly long to figure out its a remix of Miss Independent. i had never heard this song and was surprised it has over 100M views on youtube.

**seanderlust** (6): usually i'm a sucker for a pitched-up sample but for some reason i really don't like this one

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): those high pitched vocal cuts really irritate me in this

**fadedblue09** (5.5): thank you for the hosts for unnecessarily dragging my Ne-Yo avg

**sarcasticsobs** (5): Not for me at all, some lyrics had me going "why?"

**timothy444** (5): The girl who screams "remix" around the 1:49 added more substance to this than Jamie Foxx and Fabolous combined.

**noavocadoshere** (4.5): ne-yo is a gold-digger confirmed!

**heysoupie** (4.2): kind of boring & misogynistic in a way that makes me less surprised at how i was definitely not a feminist at the time in my life when this album was popular

**flava** (4): a wealth hoarders anthem

**jaztinax** (4): after listening to this album, i don‚Äôt believe this message

**thestoryteller13** (4): I like Ne-Yo's flavor in it but this song still kind of makes me laugh, not in a bad way, I just always imagine Jamie Foxx laughing while singing even though I know he's dead serious.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): WOAHOHOH WOAHOHOH

**IIIHenryIII** (3): so ahead of its time ü§©

**oscarbrierley1** (3): this song lacks any energy. Like it seems so empty

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): My favourite part of this song is the random-ass sample of the girl going "remix\~"

**daythreeinmiami** (2): We could have rated ‚ÄòBecause of You‚Äô, like 2007 was the year prior it could have worked. I just can‚Äôt believe they willingly put in a ‚Äòremix‚Äô adlib that sounds like an old mp3.watermark. But those baby sounding adlibs are worse and again I stress, ‚ÄòBecause of You‚Äô was RIGHT THERE.

**Bordersz** (1.5): Sample is annoying + too loud, nice runs. I hate the lyrics. Gold digging songs make me roll my eyes bc these rich dudes purposefully pick poor women to financially abuse them anyways.

**moonagenightmares** (1): propaganda to get women to pay on dates. not until that pay gap disappears!

**Lowest Scores:**

(1 x1) darjeelingdarkroast

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): This song has a nice boppy little hook but I can‚Äôt complain about it going out relatively early since it‚Äôs clearly one of the least memorable songs on the album‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd imagine it would‚Äôve done even worse had we rated the 50 Cent version though

**indie\_fan\_** (5.4): this track defines just existing and not doing exuding anything positive or negative. Which I supposed explains why it‚Äôs not just bottom 10. One or two good things this has going for it, but besides that, sexy ladies is one of the most ‚Äúthere‚Äù tracks on the album

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (9.8): another dipshit banger! watching it at futuresex/livesounds madison square garden is seeing a beautiful lil' cornball mannequin who just took a shot trying his damndest to land a dance with no appeal, just ragdoll perfection. He achieves that without really seeming to understand why or how, but just as. it's a rare energy, which after a week of listening to chiastic slide and almighty so and thinking of my dear scritti because of this performance, i am TOTALLY on board with. also the studio cut's big thrust swagger and HEAVY bass (it's not fleet i'll tell you) damn near kneecap me

**Bordersz** (9): This instrumental is everything. The chorus is so fire esp with the harmonies. That 1 minute outro is very dated.

**babadork** (8.7): I don‚Äôt think we make fun of Justin Timberlake‚Äôs embarrassing feud with Prince enough. This song is Sexy Dancer (Timberland Remix), but Sexy Dancer is really great.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): r/ihavesex

**akanewasright** (8): oh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm the only one who likes this huh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I‚Äôll be honest I was tempted to give this a 10 just because it was the only song on the album under 4 minutes long.

**timothy444** (8): sexy

**IIIHenryIII** (7): where them at?

**emayzee** (6.7): this sounds like the john legend "sellout" song from la la land that causes ryan gosling's jazz purist character to have a crisis

**sarcasticsobs** (6.7): I really memory-holed this one, huh? Almost wish it remained that way!

**fadedblue09** (6.5): decent but repetitive

**noavocadoshere** (6.5): the production on this > the lyrics.

**1998tweety** (6): this is ok

**CrimsonROSET** (6): get it guys i have HOT ladies ALL OVER ME

**oscarbrierley1** (6): doesn't really do anything, it's cute but just kind of repeats.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's okay but a little forgettable imo

**theonewithoutmynudes** (6): didn‚Äôt grab me

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): sex(y) counter: 64 (+30)

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): üò¨

**impla77** (5.4): how many sexy ladies does one need?

**cremeebrulee** (5): he used up all his charm w the other sexy song huh

**ignitethephoenix** (5): didn‚Äôt try with the lyrics here, did we ?

**moonagenightmares** (5): this made me laugh but i dont think it was meant to be funny

**seanderlust** (5): "move it to the left...now move it a little to the right" - justin having the sexy ladies help him move a couch

**daythreeinmiami** (4.5): I think l know who inspired this song. Sexy, sexy, sexy.

**Dragusken** (4): The only thing I really like from this is the high note in the chorus. Otherwise, just feels cringe and doesn't offer much in terms of sparking R&B joy.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i am currently in the cyberpop rate reveal listening to this as an interlude this song radiates the most sleazy energy imaginable not even the slap bass can save this

**welcome2thejam** (4): Justin has the charisma to make a lot of things work. This is not one of them

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): My album comment will probably get into this but as a former NSYNC stan, who still managed to be a JT anti, that this guy has the charisma of a pool noodle

**indie\_fan\_** (8.4): Imma be real, outside of the timbaland verse, I don‚Äôt really get the hate here. My surprise when this really was the bottom song at one point and I was just there thinking ‚Äúreally? out of all justin songs‚Äù? Maybe it‚Äôs my taste for southern rappers speaking but this coulda had a higher average

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): The beat is prime material but the hook lets it down quite a bit. Not exactly a bad song but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm complaining about this leaving on day 1

**amr** (10): "let's watch some desperate housewives" think about the messiest bitch U know...it's a man ain't it?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i busted out laughing when this song started playing this was the LAST thing i was expecting to hear on this album

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (10): wow he brought memphis rap legends the three-6 mafia to help him make a banger

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.6): when she‚Äôs a 10 but she might be a cannibal:

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): wish they had experimented more with this dark sound on the album

**rosapalms** (9): I had no idea Justin had a song with Three-6, let alone that it was a banger

**timothy444** (9): Docking one point because of the existence of Three-6 Mafia

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): preacher‚Äôs daughter be like

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): camp 8, also I love Three 6 Mafia

**sea-assumption-7403** (7.9): The Timbaland and Three-6 Mafia verses make it.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): timbaland‚Äôs low voice ad libs kind of make this worse

**Frajer** (7): it's cute that JT let Timba and Juicy J have the floor for a song

**welcome2thejam** (7): When Three-6 Mafia tells me it's going down I can be 100% sure it is. Honestly needed more of them

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): once again production slaps

**1998tweety** (6): why does that man adding in random words in the chorus sound so off?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): The random low-pitched vocals in the chorus are honestly very funny and keep this from a lower score.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): my name is tim i work at the gym

**seanderlust** (6): @ timbaland are you more of a miranda or a samantha

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): do you think Timbaland is a Bree Van De Kamp stan?

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): sex(y) counter: 65 (+1) and none for the city!

**akanewasright** (5): sigh‚Ä¶ this coming after what goes around grinds all momentum on the album to a halt

**BeauMeringue212** (5): Timbaland watches Sex and the City huh... Wonder if he's a Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte or Samantha

**daythreeinmiami** (5): She‚Äôs messy and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs in a campy way yet or not. Like there are many things happening in this song that have me ‚ÄòScrewed Up‚Äô, if you will. (I reviewed this hours before I found out Gangsta Boo died, may she Rest in Power)

**jaztinax** (4.5): kinda boring

**sarcasticsobs** (4.5): Just leave Three-6 Mafia on this, maybe leave JT and Timbaland in the chorus, and I'd like it lmao

**thestoryteller13** (4.5): catchy but the deep voices in the chorus throw me off. would be seven if it didn't have it. I do understand the chopped n skrewed thing they were going for. Beat fire regardlessss

**heysoupie** (4): JT wants to be Black so bad

**impla77** (4): Okay, but we need sex and the city vs desperate housewives discourse

**PretentiousPegasus** (3): the worst song on fs/ls, a stain on an otherwise perfect album

**theonewithoutmynudes** (3): This song is giving The Lonely Island

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Swag is not something you can fake, it's one part learned, one part instinct. Justin is‚Ä¶ definitely showing he has neither

**fadedblue09** (2.5): is this where the "chopped and screwed" trend came from

**Dragusken** (2): Another entry in the cringy fkboi wannabe vibe that this album seems to be emanating‚Ä¶Just not it for me‚Ä¶.

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): oh so this is where the name ‚Äúchopped & screwed‚Äù comes from, because this was screwed from the moment of conception

**oscarbrierley1** (2): I can't really explain why I dislike this song so much, but it really doesn't work for me.

**xavieryes** (2): the worst song on the (main) album by far

**noavocadoshere** (1): LMFAO. whose idea was this??? it just doesn't work. my score is solely for three-6 mafia's involvement.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): I actually don‚Äôt get the hate for this one, I might just be a sucker for more uptempo Usher, but I actually really like him on this one. Surprised that of all the bonus tracks this is the one that got tanked into day 1

**indie\_fan\_** (2.5): and finally this has been eliminated this is easily my least favorite song on the whole rate. The production is not at all flattering to me and i don‚Äôt really feel it matches usher‚Äôs voice either. It has some good things going for it as I see what they were going for sonically plus Usher‚Äôs vocals do well here, but it‚Äôs very underwhelming for me. In the end, I‚Äôm glad it was just a bonus track.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We have green covered now who‚Äôs gonna give us a bop called ‚ÄúYellow Light?‚Äù

**noavocadoshere** (10): UNDERRATED. criminally so.

**Stryxen** (10): he was experimenting! He's an experimentalist

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (10): oh dude but that cocteau reverb on the gtr with a lil' hype synth key. lmfao he's really trying to clutch it at the end here he can have my 10

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): this sounds proto-Early 10s Pop Rap and like usher‚Äôs 2010s discography. If it had a stronger low-end and wasn‚Äôt so skeletal I‚Äôd give it a 10

**Dragusken** (9): Quite sultry, as expected from the title. Usher's vocals also match the chaotic vibe brought by the instrumentals. The backing vocals also sound pretty nice with Usher's belting. Maybe it's the topic but the song gave me Roxanne vibes.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this might become a 10

**jsonphile** (9): honestly this could‚Äôve been a single that chorus slaps so hard

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): wait‚Ä¶im hearing something

**PinkCadillacs** (8.4): My second favorite of the expanded edition songs on Confessions after My Boo.

**akanewasright** (8): I understand the hate for this, and also propose that [the solution to your problems with it may be simple](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/851835432886599761/1061855752467259422/image0.jpg)

**oscarbrierley1** (8): it sounds like a mix of goodies and 1,2 step. Not a bad thing because they're both bops.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): the production is anxiety inducing but I‚Äôm still bopping

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): me following the laws in GTA

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): this song sounds like ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Cha‚Äô by the Pussycat Dolls Feat. Nicole Scherzinger mixed with He Said, She Said by Ashley Tisdale.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): usher and falling in love w a girl that was supposed to be a one night stand - name a more iconic duo

**welcome2thejam** (7): Sources: Usher is beside himself. Driving around downtown Atlanta begging (thru song) his girl for address to her home

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Needs more oomph

**nt96** (6.5): I like how subtle and sneaky it sounds, however it almost feels like JT reject that never got finished.

**1998tweety** (6): did not in fact end Lorde

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this sticker ass beat

**fadedblue09** (6): probably the most dated track on the album

**rosapalms** (5): I do not like this beat or this chorus.

**theonewithoutmynudes** (5): this is v specific but there‚Äôs a loop of audio in this song that sounds like an OST from Paper Mario, like from chapter 3 or so - I spent the entire song trying to remember which OST because the actual song bored me

**emayzee** (4.5): the production on this just sounds like if you fed 2004 music into an AI

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Beat is total ass but at least Usher tried his absolute best to make it sound good

**moonagenightmares** (3): extremely outdated in a bad way

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Keys? Harmony? Proper mixing? Never heard of her

**sea-assumption-7403** (2): Considered this for my 0. Usher does have some serious misses (much of the early 2010s era of his catalogue for instance). I almost wanted to give this the 0 that I would give him just for putting Papers into the existence.

**thestoryteller13** (2): Was surprised to see that this was produced by Lil Jon and written by Keri Hilson. Interesting but the instrumental is kind of odd

**xavieryes** (1): this song is insufferable for me for some reason

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): wow this felt endless, just that chorus with a janky falsetto and the 00s shrieky synth over and over for nearly FIVE minutes.

**MassiveThief** (0): this is UGLY. the synths are from my nightmares.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): I actually feel like I might‚Äôve underrated this since I‚Äôve liked it a little more every time I‚Äôve heard it. not the most unique ballad but it feels like it would fit into a live action adaptation of a Disney movie (actually not an insult even though it should be).

**MassiveThief** (10): now THIS is a slay

**nt96** (10): Downright bop idc

**rosapalms** (10): world-class vocal performance here

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): WORLD STOP... hold on this is actually kind of great wait

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): something is doing it for me with the synth moments throughout this album

**seanderlust** (9): "happiness will never last/turns into memories of the past/here today and gone just as fast" - surprisingly heavy lyrics from a song about being happy

**theonewithoutmynudes** (9): to me, this sounds v similar to the song he did for The Princess and the Frog (this is a compliment)

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): Again: STRINGS

**1998tweety** (8): Beyonc√© in Feeling Myself

**fadedblue09** (8): His vocals elevate this

**frogaranaman** (8): simp

**PretentiousPegasus** (8): this kind of gives x factor winners single or that song they make you sing at year 8 graduation

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): dio brando

**thestoryteller13** (8): so beautiful and romantic (right after the track about someone cheating doe??? LMAO)

**TiltControls** (7.5): Wish there was a bit more to this, but it's a nice ballad with some strong moments

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (7.1): like there's a pretty good low end here I think, sorta need more of that bass drone than that bloody chorus though. im not transcending in the ckub

**CrimsonROSET** (7): so he DID get her back? gag

**Dragusken** (7): This song sounds like it'd be used in a Kaiser Permanente or PETA commercial. Personally, not my cup of tea though I have to admit that Neyo's vocals are quite nice.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): the chorus is euphoric

**welcome2thejam** (7): This album has just made me feel super bad for Ne-Yo, every song he's either not getting the girl or is super pessimistic about their relationship

**heysoupie** (6.5): this one gives me John Mayer vibes

**jaztinax** (6): jfc here he goes again saying he doesn‚Äôt deserve his partner. DUMP HIS ASS HE‚ÄôS LITERALLY SAYING HE SUCKS

**Stryxen** (6): okay first of all take a breath...

**impla77** (5.7): This is teetering dangerously close to musical theatre core

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Oh that first line set me up for something very different. I started a rosary‚Ä¶

**ImADudeDuh** (5): so you want this to happen Ne-Yo? [https://astronomy.com/news/2021/04/what-would-happen-if-the-earth-stopped-spinning](https://astronomy.com/news/2021/04/what-would-happen-if-the-earth-stopped-spinning)

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): American Idol-tier ballad

**BeauMeringue212** (4): He coulda let Jason Derulo have this one tbh

**IIIHenryIII** (3): stop this song from playing, please

**RandomHypnotica** (3): catholic school mass core

**noavocadoshere** (2): damn year of the gentleman, what happened to you? this is as generic as it can get. the first half was so much stronger.

**daythreeinmiami** (1): I need this album to be over this is getting embarrassing

**indie\_fan\_** (10): I 100% get the hate for this one. It‚Äôs corny, cheesy, and giving high school prom vibes. Yet I still love it. I can‚Äôt help it, there‚Äôs a certain genre of corny r&b shit I will defend with my life and this fits into that category. I will say I absolutely woulda tanked the NKOTB duet as that version is a mess.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): the song titled single being the most forgettable single of anything in this rate‚Ä¶ yeah its the generic default ‚Äúsingle.‚Äù Still cannot BELIEVE this was for a New Kids album that also has The Pussycat Dolls, Timbaland, Akon, and Lady fucking Gaga

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is amazing and when looking up the song thought i was gonna have a New Kids on the Block jumpscare

**fadedblue09** (10): The use of wordplay on "single" is clever

**thestoryteller13** (10): Currently body rolling.

**nt96** (9): this is what Shawn Mendes and Justin Bieber thought they were serving when Boyfriend and Treat You Better was released.

**soul-glitch** (9): King of pandering to the ladies

**1998tweety** (8.5): me @ Alhaitham

**noavocadoshere** (8.5): this is exactly the kind of song i WOULD expect from ne-yo. the beat kept reminding me of neighbors know my name and all i could think was I HEAR A KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKING ON MY DOOR. pls. the grunt/moaning was weird to end on though.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): me hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha

**BeauMeringue212** (8.3): The "single" wordplay is not exactly inspired, but I love a good old fashioned begging r&b ballad

**theonewithoutmynudes** (8.2): this song is fairly basic but it‚Äôs also really working for me at the same time

**celladonn** (8): this outsold the new kids on the block version

**Frajer** (8): New Kids On The Block is an insane feature

**plastichaxan** (8): Need a boyfriend for like 4min fr

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (7.8): hey! hey! hey! 1,2,3,4! 1,2,3,4! I want a weeknd cover of this with young thug doing the ad-libs. anyways this one is a cornball banger

**OutrageousWorldTour** (7.5): I prefer the version with New Kids on the Block but this is fine. Honestly, pretty underrated.

**sea-assumption-7403** (7.3): Would maybe rate it a bit lower lyrically but Ne-Yo got me with that let me sing it in a harmony line. He kills it vocally all over this album.

**bigbigbee** (7): god SM Entertainment really ripped this album off wholesale for essentially all of their b-sides between 2009 and 2011

**CrimsonROSET** (7): behind the dj booth? usher

**Dragusken** (7): I don't know why but the first few parts of the song gave me Viva La Vida (by Coldplay) vibes. Overall, this song is pretty nice and gives a little anthem for simps wanting "to be your boyfriend".

**IIIHenryIII** (7): did usher and will.i.am just stole the melody from the verses? It sounds too similar to what I think it‚Äôs the pre-chorus in OMG. Anyways, the way that piano comes to set the tone for mad‚Ä¶ goosebumps

**Roxieloxie** (7): sometimes you gotta get a little two step banger and I can appreciate it

**welcome2thejam** (7): I've read enough fanfics and watched enough romcoms to know this is a C- attempt at the Fake Boyfriend run

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): why can i see big time rush covering this

**heysoupie** (6.5): it‚Äôs giving Viva la Vida

**impla77** (6.5): Cause there‚Äôs like two definitions that fit here!!

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be your boyfriend‚Äù - is that a promise? Because Ne-Yo, I‚Äôm unfortunately very, very single

**green\_hair\_dont\_care** (6): The weird breathing at the end put it down a point

**ImADudeDuh** (6): kinda embarassing that the best vocals on this album came from the random guy in the intro of this. Anyways this is serving Betta Thanny Can a bit but still not nowhere near as bad.

**jaztinax** (6): the lyrics feel a little childish

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Not for me

**seanderlust** (6): "i'll be your boyfriend until this song goes off" ne-yo's galaxy brain moment of putting that line in a song that does not go off

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): "Yo‚Ä¶ you know how single can mean both being alone AND a song release? Well, hear me out‚Ä¶ what if we wrote a song where we use BOTH meanings AT THE SAME TIME???" ‚ÄîNe-Yo, probably

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): The fact that this song ISN‚ÄôT a single? Ugh his mind. Mainly because it isn‚Äôt very good.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): honestly boring after the first two songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why did he have to include the moaning at the end üíÄ

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): The guy in the intro did NOT need to be here lol

**TiltControls** (4): These lyrics read like a preteen in the mid 2000s first discovering ingame forums and asking if anyone wants to be their girlfriend

**TragicKingdom1** (4): ???

**daythreeinmiami** (3): Oh this went downhill quickly this is a mess and my brain wants to like it but this production is just TERRIBLE. Whoever thought putting that muddy ass kick on every beat was a good idea, and those gross ass grunts in the end, it wasn‚Äôt. Shame on you.

**ignitethephoenix** (3): I don‚Äôt think this is supposed to be intentionally funny but it is

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): big time rush cosplay? at your big age AND single? pick a struggle

**moonagenightmares** (2): those moans were not it

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): if a guy hit on me like this, the last place I would be going is his bed

**timothy444** (0): Oh boy, a song that gives me flashbacks to "Treat You Better" by Shawn Mendes, and radiates energy accordingly by insisting a random girl to be his girlfriend. At least in this very instance, Ne-Yo himself is insisting that it's just for one song... and then the second verse kicks in which is incredibly cringe. I mean, what real life person does that? Who would actually say that and mean it? It's so weird! So weirdly honest, but also... weirdly desperate. Hilariously, this song has its own Wikipedia page and that's only because it was actually a single but with another artist... and honestly strangely enough that works way better than whatever this solo version wannabe is attempting.

**indie\_fan\_** (9): if anything, I‚Äôm surprised this didn‚Äôt go out bottom 5. Definitely don‚Äôt hate it, I just assumed most people would think this was too dull. Solid track nonetheless, but I think there‚Äôs better sensual sounding songs on the album than this.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): This is passable enough, but very much a part of the weakest stretch of the album, so I can‚Äôt act even a little bit surprised at this being a day 1 cut. Still a little funny that this was the first step on Robin Thicke‚Äôs path to ripping off the artists in this rate for years to come

**theonewithoutmynudes** (11): this is the highlight of the album for me, I love a sultry ballad. Fun fact - this was a Robin Thicke demo and his ex-wife Paula Patton is the female voice heard in the chorus (it‚Äôs also my belief that The Evolution of Robin Thicke would have better matchup from a quality perspective with Confessions and FS/LS but that‚Äôs neither here nor there)

**akanewasright** (10): horny comment

**BeauMeringue212** (10): My favourite song in the rate vocally, Usher's mic was on

**fadedblue09** (10): His falsettos here are godly. Probably the best of the sexual songs

**noavocadoshere** (10): this song will remain one of in usher's top five for me.

**seanderlust** (10): now why is robin thicke here

**Dragusken** (9): I like the instrumentals in this song and it really adds to the softness of Usher's vocals and the lyrics.

**thestoryteller13** (9): okaaaaay another sexy jam. I suspect that this song was sung by Robin Thicke first since he wrote it because a lot of the riffs are robin thicke-ish (circa 2006 NOT blurred lines lol)

**WaneSexyBacktoc** (9): there's something incredible about naming the ditty "can u handle it?". they talk about freaky things and there's a whispery section with a big YEAHHHHHHH! shit rules

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): Vocals

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): oo this is a sexy song, which means it probably won‚Äôt last long

**jaztinax** (8): a really good slow r&b jam

**1998tweety** (7.5): theyre really just having sex on this huh

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): This sounds like a Childish Gambino ‚ÄòAwken, My Love!‚Äô deep cut. I like it.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): I always wonder who the woman singer is because she doesn't seem to be credited anywhere. Its kind of a slow build, but it has some nice vocal moments.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): no i am weak

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This fine. Maybe I‚Äôm just not in the right frame of mind to be listening to this while sitting in bed all day surrounded by candy and candy wrappers.

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): I don't think they can handle it!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): He‚Äôs so skilled at horny jams

**DirtyRat583** (6.5): even within the context of the album this is a chore and a half

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the guy working the ticket stand at the movie theater when i ask him for a ticket to see the movie it

**throwaway-7650** (6): ...not PAULA PATTON (??) getting HAIM'd/maren'd/lana'd

**plastichaxan** (5): Guess I couldn't

**timothy444** (5): Yes, we get it Usher, you messed up and you want to have make up sex. Jeez

**CrimsonROSET** (4): no usher your lower register is fine please don‚Äôt-

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): Usher is a good looking man with charisma sex appeal etc but this very long Keith Sweat type of baby making jam with the chick hollering post-bridge is a bit much even for me, an enjoyer of the R&B classics

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i hate balladphobia but sorry i'm participating in it now

**IIIHenryIII** (3): genius song descriptions are so thirsty over this dude

**heysoupie** (2.5): is this a hornier song?

**MassiveThief** (1): i'm sleep

**moonagenightmares** (1): snooze

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): what happened to this album
