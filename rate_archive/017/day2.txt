**MrSwearword**: "I swear this crappy synth got on my nerves tracks ago. Enough of this."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I much prefer White Roses but Black Roses is really great too. And I really like the “you keep turning on, you’re turning me on, you’re turning me OFF.”"

**Zamomattel**: "Solid & poppy, Charli moderately slays here"

**whatsapilot**: "ngl the beginning always makes me think this is Power. Anyway the bass makes my ears cum."

**Altiondsols**: "the prequel to White Roses"

**therokinrolla**: "The really heavy bassline can be a little much, but this is the best song on the second half of the album(also I feel like there MUST be some connection between White Roses and this song). The chorus is shookifying"

**deschaussettes**: "had me tapping my feet, love her "raps""

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Just as good as White Roses"

**vapourlomo**: "The melody is kind of pedestrian, but THAT BASSLINE."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this song isnt bad but i forgot what the chorus is like halfway through the chorus"

**elitefourbrad**: "This is another bop from Charli because production is totally on point here, autotune is a little heavy but it works with the futuristic sound."

**jamesfog**: "One of the more enjoyable, catchy songs on True Romance"

**yunglethe**: "this is cute but so forgettable!"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "White roses in the snow / Never let me go / Lying in your bed and movin’ slow"

**kappyko**: "i like the outro tbh"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This > White Roses"

**SkyBlade79**: "white roses is way better than this… the lyrics are kind of cringy"

**MrSwearword**: "It’s subtle but doesn’t screw with the cohesion of the album."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oh my god those synthsss"

**Zamomattel**: "Not one of the strongest in the rate, but a fun light pop song nevertheless"

**therokinrolla**: "I like this nice chill tune. It is so different from the rest of the album, which is necessary and brash, this is restrained and cute. I like it."

**deschaussettes**: "BOP. CERTIFIED BOP. I love it, love the little "radio"-like effects that breaks up the song round the third part, and the static effects all over the song. Also her voice in this is so pleasing aahhh"

**vapourlomo**: "It sounds cute, but the lyrics are deceptively dark. I LOVE songs like this (hence why Passion Pit was one of my favorite bands in high school)."

**elitefourbrad**: "I love the synth here! It reminds me so much of Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper and that’s easily one of my favorite songs. Love In Stereo sounds like such a button-pressing time."

**jamesfog**: "A Carly tea, I live"

**skiddos**: "The chorus is a little lackluster"

**kappyko**: "closest the album returns to '80s synthpop of Everything is Embarrassing/I Blame Myself. pretty stuff, adore the singing, maybe not as good as those other songs? the effects i hear in this are a little tacky but not overused."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Pretty uninteresting compared to the rest of the other tracks, but it's still better than Stereo Hearts."

**SkyBlade79**: "the best part of this song is how the intro sounds like Run Away with Me, a song that the real Sky can actually appreciate. It’s just BORING"

**4Roux**: "This is the most Ariel-Rechtshaid-sounding song on the album I think. A Haim cover of this would sound great too."

**cedollete**: "this song is sooooo good, on a music-level! sky's voice sounds fantastic here, and it's just a really plain good pop song. the only reason i don't have this song rated higher is because the lyrics are soooo cliche imo. normally that wouldn't be a docking point for me but it's disappointing compared to the rest of this album, which is filled with great lyrics and inventive song premises."

vapourlomo: Because their stuff is very middle-of-the-road (which is part of their appeal, no shade here), which means they aren't going to get many bad scores, compared to Charli and Sky who are a bit more weird.

However, this means they probably won't win either.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oh, this shit is so rough, so raw. It’s probably my third favorite on the album, the way she sings is just so tremendous."

**Zamomattel**: "Like this a lot but some elements don't seem to work that well together"

**Altiondsols**: "dumbish"

**therokinrolla**: "I love the chorus and the reptition here for some reason i dont really kno why but it makes my HEAVY METAL PUSSY POP"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "i can feel the balls of my heavy metal heart"

**banananaise**: "breaking news sky ferreira saves metal"

**vapourlomo**: "This song sounds incredible with its hair metal-meets-synthpop production, and honestly, Sky has more metal cred than Gaga could ever have (put the pitchforks down, I adore Gaga, but you know this is true). Still, it does get a bit repetitive, knocking it down from a 9 or 10."

**elitefourbrad**: "It’s not bad, but I’m not really a Heavy Metal type of person. The only Heavy Metal for me is Heavy Metal Lover by Gaga."

**kappyko**: "HOLY SHIT THE RIFFAGE <3 powerful vocals!!"

**chihuahuazero**: "This song bangs as much as its title suggests."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "lady gaga and 21p are SHOOK"

**SkyBlade79**: "wow, a half decent song! The only metal that this Sky likes is avenged sevenfold and elena siegman tho, sorry hunty"

**cedollete**: "MAN this song is so much better than any song named "heavy metal heart" should be, haha"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "AHHH THOSE SYNTHS AH MY GOD. This song is bittersweet in the best way possible, and I love it so."

**SkyBlade79**: "kind of repetitive, but the chorus is nice"

**cedollete**: "loooove the chorus on this song, probably one of the best choruses from the album!"

**MrSwearword**: "vocals are admittedly samey, but the production is not boring."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This song was straight up my junior year song. The lyrics are so good and the hook is so edgy but so so so real. It’s the catchiest thing on the record, and I may have sang it like every day tbh"

**Zamomattel**: "nobody asked her if this song slays"

**VeganSquash**: "I could feel her emotion but the song was too repetitive for me"

**whatsapilot**: "r u ok sky?"

**therokinrolla**: "really lame, the title is way to long, t0000 edgy4me"

**deschaussettes**: "this is kinda generic, but the lyrics speak to me sooooo much"

**vapourlomo**: "This honestly could've been a song from Hole or Elastica in 1995. That's a pretty damn high compliment, FYI."

**elitefourbrad**: "I don’t like when singers have that echo autotune effect and I don’t like it here. It also doesn’t help that this is a complete ripoff of The End Has No End by the Strokes."

**jamesfog**: "nobody asked me (if i was snatched)"

**skiddos**: "This is one of those make me want to shout songs. NOBODY ASKED ME IF I WAS OKAY!! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "AAAAAA basically my theme song if I have a TV show about me. That's why I am giving this an 11."

**kappyko**: "i love how she sings the title like three different ways"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I like the emotion Sky conveys in this song. I tend toget overwhelmed by social situations at times, and I sometimes feel like nobody considers the fact that I might be confused or frustrated whenever I'm involved in drama."

**SkyBlade79**: "This sounds like all of the worst parts of early 2000s pop punk… personally, I, the better Sky, prefer metal."

**cedollete**: "gets a bit repetitive, but's overall an absolutely fantastic song. the way she sings "i tried to ask you, but nobody asked me" is heartbreaking. my biggest complaint is just that the verses aren't nearly as good as the fantastic chorus imo."

Wait I'm confused...if you don't like "edgy" why are you voting in a rate with Charli's darkest album and 2010s Courtney Love (HAIM is very, very not edgy)?

That's like saying you hate folk and participating in a rate with Bon Iver and Iron & Wine.

**MrSwearword**: "Vocally, their registers are really bum when low. That’s like 75% of the vocals and that’s the problem."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Holy fuck this boppp. I haven’t listened to Days Are Gone since 2013 and I’m surprised at how it’s holding up. They’ve always had some great percussion and this track is no slouch, with an instrumental that feels very Vampire Weekend."

**Zamomattel**: "love this, classic Haim festival BOP"

**icedarkling**: "my fave song by them!"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "this sounds the same as falling with a slightly better bassline"

**therokinrolla**: "even tho i feel like all their voices sound the same its still basically perfect"

**deschaussettes**: "THE break-up song you need to finally end things with your shitty boyfriend"

**vapourlomo**: "Out of the four seasons, I feel that spring is the hardest to assign a particular musical sound to (the others are easy: Summer is all breezy, hard-hitting rock and pop like Lisa Prank or Tame Impala, Winter is chilly, gloomy electronic like M83 or Chromatics, and Fall is Drake and Florence+The Machine). Forever is one of the few songs that unequivocally sounds like spring to me: It's brisk and upbeat, but not quite as fiery as more summery tunes."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "honestly if Sky's album wasnt in the rate this would be my 11. sooooo immaculate and energetic"

**elitefourbrad**: "Their vocals don’t really sound that great here leading up to the chorus, it reminds me of a song I heard on Futurama a while ago."

**jamesfog**: "I remember hearing this for the first time and instantly falling in love with it, they're that good!"

**kappyko**: "i like the vocal sample that reoccurs in this and the rhythms are great. catchy as fuck"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Took me three listens to like this, but the production is pretty sweet. The party where they sing 'Get out, get out of my memory' is pretty great."

**SkyBlade79**: "Quite average…"

**cedollete**: "the pre-chorus on this song is SOOOOO good!! also the guitar on this song is fantastic, especially the solo. my biggest problem is just that something about the chorus just sounds... off? i can't really put it into words, but i feel like if the chorus was just a LITTLE different, the song would get a perfect ten for me."

**whatsapilot**: "really boring"

**MrSwearword**: "This bored me. “Stay Away”? No need to tell me twice."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Not one of the more memorable songs, but as a standalone listen, it’s fantastic. So hazy, and Charli makes one of the more repetitive hooks interesting."

**Zamomattel**: "Like this but seems very filler, not all that memorable, I think that Charli has a lot of songs like this"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "MOM SLAYED US AGAIN"

**therokinrolla**: "At first I didn’t like this song that much, but it’s grown a little. I’m still not a huge fan of Charli’s breathy singing voice in the verses, but the BOMB that the prechorus and chorus is helps to keep me interested."

**deschaussettes**: "lyrics can be a bit better. cool beat and production tho."

**vapourlomo**: "Honestly, this sounds like Sky Ferreira had a baby with The Human League's "Human" and I'm 100% here for it."

**elitefourbrad**: "Another great bop with Charli being petty to a bitch like I would."

**jamesfog**: "A kinda cute bop"

**kappyko**: "the melody on this chorus shows she's had the talent that shows on her later projects since her debut, but like, why can't she get more interesting production??? the whole gothy electro darkwave pop style is cool but she could at least switch it up. don't get me wrong, i like electropop, but this style of electropop just feels really dated, honestly, especially when it came out in 2013!!"

**chihuahuazero**: "This song made me a Charli fan. I remember seeing her open for Marina and the Diamonds, as Charli was singing this song, running her hands through her goth hair."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Is it just me or does the part where she says 'stay away' sound a little like how Slade sings 'hang on' in Hang On To Your Love?"

**MrSwearword**: "I’m pretending this is the group trying slightly different vocals. I can’t imagine this being MORE OF THE SAME. DAMN. SONG."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Chorus is wild. Just straight wild."

**Zamomattel**: "not my favourite production, loses some of their individualism, still pretty strong"

**VeganSquash**: "did the lead singer change? Sounds different for some reason."

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "the vocals are actually pretty good on this song for the first time on the album, and i really like verse but the chorus sounds like everything else. I HAD HOPE AND THEY FAILED ME"

**whatsapilot**: "For some reason it gives me nostalgia vibes as if it were a timeless classic I've known since forever, even though I just got into this album last year. I can't explain why this song is so great for me. By far the best song on the album, in the rate, and one of my favorites overall."

**letsallpoo**: "There are few songs out there make me have an emotional response. 2014 was my graduation year, and in May, a month before high school would end for me, the school's English department had a field trips of sorts to a play festival in Oregon, and in preparation for the bus ride I downloaded a ton of albums. One of them was Days Are Gone (thanks for the recommendation, Pitchfork!) and I distinctly remember listening to the title track as I stared out the window as grassy fields full of cows rolled by. That moment in your life is always a strange one, the one between the stress of moving to college and the stress of trying to get into college. It's a time of reflection and anticipation and doubt and fear and hope and a billion other emotions that tumble all over one another in your head. This song is one of those special songs where I can't help but have a visceral reaction to, because no matter what it always brings me back to that moment in time when I had no idea what the future would bring me, when all I knew was that the days I knew were gone. I know the song's actually about a relationship, but I can't help my feelings."

**Altiondsols**: "this album is losing steam HARD"

**therokinrolla**: "I love it its mild kinda like a banana its lovely"

**deschaussettes**: "eh. kinda generic. love the synths tho."

**vapourlomo**: "I think this is the underrated gem of the album. A sharp pivot from the early to the late 80s with the drum machines and bright electric piano chords is a nice change of pace."

**elitefourbrad**: "A song about thinking about their ex, I mean it’s pretty generic for me."

**jamesfog**: "Este slays this song! One of the poppiest song's on the album, and I love the different styles here!"

**skiddos**: "This is such a weird track, I absolutely love it"

**yunglethe**: "This is song is the most similar to Falling, which is why I love it so much"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "BITCH I AM FUCKING SHOOK. WTF THIS TITLE TRACK CAN'T BE THIS GOOD????????? OMG."

**kappyko**: "i'm living for the DAYS ARE GONE DAYS ARE GONE HA part but the intro is kind of ass for a bit nvm i like it now EDIT: you know what fuck it this holds its own against the other 10s on this album"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I really love the part where they say 'days are gone'! It sounds so catchy and forbearing."

**SkyBlade79**: "Pretty catchy!"

**luigi_is_better**: "way better than iiccym fite me"

**cedollete**: "the title track for the album is easily the worst song from it which.... makes it a really weird decision to name the album after it, honestly. the "hoooolding on" part is great, but everything else about the song doesn't work super well for me."

**MrSwearword**: "The vocals are really bad but the production is at least pretty decent."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Omg am I the only person who thinks this sounds like a Terraria song?? I love love love those bleeps, and I get shook every time those synths come in. Take My Hand has my favorite verses on the entire album, some really memorable delivery, and probably the some of the dreamiest atmosphere on the album."

**Zamomattel**: "Love this, sounds like it could be on Number One Angel"

**VeganSquash**: "idk it feels too distorted for me, especially the "lets dance" part"

**whatsapilot**: "queen of being trashy and sophisticated at the same time"

**mokitsu**: "Mediocrity in mp3 format"

**vapourlomo**: "The production is solid, but the whole song feels so repetitive and doesn't live up to the stellar first two tracks on True Romance."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "that 80s synthpop vibe makes me float tbh"
