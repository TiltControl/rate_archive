[RATE] The Ariel Rechtshaid 2013 (aka Haim vs. Charli XCX vs. Sky Ferreira) Rate Reveal Pt. 1!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6dj78w/rate_the_ariel_rechtshaid_2013_aka_haim_vs_charli/

Hey guys, an update on the rate reveal.

First, some bad news. Yesterday I locked myself out of my house while going to a party, so I'm currently unable to access my computer which has all the data on it. Luckily I did find shelter at a friends house, and convinced him to let me use his laptop (try explaining you are doing a rate reveal for a pop music subreddit), and due to /u/letsallpoo's software and reddit messages I'm able to present the rates still, however without writeups. This will be a minor incovenience ofcourse, and I hope y'all will be able to still enjoy the rate. I could ofcourse have made it up new today, but it was the best weather in the last 8-ish months today so I was forced to go to the beach. 

TLDR: I'm stupid and needed to do everything from scratch. No writeups avaible tonight.

Then secondly some good news, The rate reveal is starting at 23:00 CET tongiht, which is 3 PM PST or in 1 hour and 20 minutes, both here and on http://plug.dj/popheads. Be sure to join us there! Hear the worst songs off these 3 albums!

MrSwearword: Oh that's fine. Even if you didn't lock yourself out, rate hosts had to do writeups sort of last minute. You can always add them later in another day reveal or something.

So, the first song out. I don't like this song much. I also shamelessly stole whatsapilot's comment as a shitpost link.
---
**MrSwearword**: "Beat wise this goes the FUCK in and I live. Lyrically this is a bit weird but that’s nitpicking."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "A little obnoxious, but a lot to love. The beat is really too grating for me though, and her vocals are kinda weird on here. It does work for me for some reason though."

**Zamomattel**: "There are sounds here that should've never been put together and should never again. However, there is still a charming quality that stops it from hitting the very bottom marks" -- *seems like you're not right after all*

**whatyourheartdesires**: "I just hear noises"

**VeganSquash**: "kinda liked the lyrics but the song was so bad. I couldn't hear what Sky was saying and the beat was all over the place."


**Altiondsols**: "this is less of a song and more of a mic check"

**therokinrolla**: "this should not exist"

**deschaussettes**: "the beeps and kinda heavy metal guitars are really driving me crazy, but I can’t decide if it’s good crazy or bad crazy."

**mokitsu**: "This is really, really bad. This song is really a 0."

**vapourlomo**: "I really like this sing-slong melody juxtaposed against the grinding, distorted guitar. It just works, can't explain why."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "we already have Omanko"

**elitefourbrad**: "I don’t love the guitar here, it’s giving me a really bad headache that I can’t even hear or enjoy the rest of the song sadly."

**jamesfog**: "tbh forgettable but still a bop, i'll stan"

**skiddos**: "It's hard to understand what's she's saying"

**yunglethe**: "yeah it's a no from me dawg"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I am reading the Genius page for this song and I still have no idea what Sky is singing. It's catchy I guess?"

**kappyko**: "i like the distorted production and there's some cool stuff going on near the end"

**chihuahuazero**: "At least I remember this song."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Goes on for too long."

**SkyBlade79**: "this rhyming is lazy/ super super crazy. This song is trash / rather watch a car crash. You suck, other sky / listening makes me want to die"

Omanko. The song everyone expected to fail horribly, and it did. But it didn't get last. It got second to last, so that's not a lot better.

---
**MrSwearword**: "apparently, “Omanko” is Japanese for “sonic clusterfuck”."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I like rock music and whatnot but this song is way too repetitive for me, I really don’t like it and it’s usually an instant skip."

**Zamomattel**: "When you think of the fact that multiple people had to approve a song for it to be put on an album it leaves the question, how was this song able to get to the final cut?"

**VeganSquash**: "I thought this song was super funny. I speak a little Japanese so I was like "oh god" when she was saying Omanko."

**whatsapilot**: "it's almost funny at first but then it just turns out to be really boring and annoying"

**Altiondsols**: "some A New Family teas. not a damn clue what she's talking about tho"

**therokinrolla**: "what the fuck"

**deschaussettes**: "boring and vaguely racist"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "bussy"

**banananaise**: "(writing on chalkboard) i will not make a weeaboo joke, i will not make a weeaboo joke, i will not make a weeaboo joke"

**mokitsu**: "Oh no baby what is you doing"

**Bannanaise**: "(writing on chalkboard) i will not make a weeaboo joke, i will not make a weeaboo joke, i will not make a weeaboo joke"

**vapourlomo**: "I know this is going to be eliminated early, because this is popheads not nineinchnailsheads, but come on: this is a perfect recreation of that 90s moment when industrial and grunge combined. The oddball lyrics and droning guitar grove just add to the odd atmosphere."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "UNDERRATED GRUNGY BOP!"

**elitefourbrad**: "Just for Omanko being slang for vagina apparently in Japanese."

**jamesfog**: "My Japanese weave is officially snatched"

**skiddos**: "What a fuckin weeb"

**yunglethe**: "i feel like score is self explanatory"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is not bad as a lot of people would say about the song tbh."

**kappyko**: "noisy asf and just what i like. hentai anthem"

**chihuahuazero**: "This is a Japanese Christian subreddit."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I love how heavy this track is. But how is this about vaginas?!"

**SkyBlade79**: "you know I could’ve went my whole life without hearing this complete pile of trash. After swearword told me what the name was it got even worse. What sorta campy delusional bs is this… this Sky is the worst kind of weeaboo wtf"

**Nfranklin50**: "I honestly don't know what I just experienced. Did she say something about Japanese Jesus smashing puss on christmas? Like I wanna bop but more christian morals are telling me otherwise"

**gannade**: "brooke candy is amazing. as good as a rapper as becky g. also check out fellow aspiring white girl rapper chanel west coast."

**elitefourbrad**: "Reminds me of a Tupac song oddly enough, only thing keeping this from a 10 is annoying Brooke Candy who is not needed here at all."

**jamesfog**: "Brooke Candy sounds better when she's singing"

**yunglethe**: "honestly? she can keep this song and the poor man's iggy azeala that features on it"

**kappyko**: "OK I ACTUALLY DIG THIS HIP HOP TYPE THING, a welcome change from the rest of the album. i love female rapping, reminds me of like Leikeli47 or M.I.A."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I'm starting to think that I enjoy songs with British rappers on them. Cloud Aura, Really Don't Care, that one Drake song..."

**4Roux**: "There should be more rap features on this album because it works really well with Charli's sound!"

**MrSwearword**: "“How can I fix what I’ve fucked up?” singing lessons, sharpen your songwriting, pick better production, pretty much throw this album away and start over."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I really think the naming mechanism for the next two songs is brilliant, perhaps one of my favorite things about the album. Chorus is iconic too."

**Zamomattel**: "Boring and a bit lazy, some good elements but too similar to superior Songs here"

**VeganSquash**: "the chorus sucks and the verses are meh"

**jamesfog**: "Forgettable"

**yunglethe**: "this is unoffensive enough but not great. listen i know this sounds like i hate charli xcx. i listened to this so much when it came out!!! i saw her live when she was promoting this album!!! but it has NOT aged well at all and number 1 angel is 500x better"

I MADE A MISTAKE THIS IS ACTUALLY NUMBER 32 NOT 31 IM SORRY SO FAR AWAY IS #31!!!

**MrSwearword**: "Beat wise, it’s a great closer. Vocally, this is a terrible way to end the album."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I don’t really remember this song. It’s kind of an interesting closer, but a bit too slow for my tastes."

**Zamomattel**: "There is nothing very exciting here and the whole song is honestly such a drag"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "I have no idea what is happening here"

**VeganSquash**: "too dark for my taste"

**whatsapilot**: "I'm conflicted. This is mostly boring but at the same time I kinda dig the atmosphere."

**therokinrolla**: "soo dark and deep wow"

**deschaussettes**: "the transition between happy, peppy Love in Stereo to this is whiplash-inducing. I like the contrast tho, really digging it"

**banananaise**: "great album closer, not a stand out track but it's unique and leaves an impression"

**mokitsu**: "10 for the Twin Peaks references #JusticeForFWWM"

**Bannanaise**: "great album closer, not a stand out track but it's unique and leaves an impression"

**vapourlomo**: "A creepy, haunting ending to an otherwise upbeat album. It kind of works, but I'm not sure this sound plays to Sky's strengths."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this song sounds like a swamp but in a good way. very eerie and dreamlike and tbh one of my favorite title tracks ever"

**elitefourbrad**: "After everything so upbeat on this album, I never would’ve expected the dark track here. It sounds like a Lana song, but even better with the good beat and the dreary vocals."

**jamesfog**: "when the title track is the weakest song on the album... oop. yikes"

**skiddos**: "What an odd way to close the album"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Man, don't you just hate it when albums just end with a disapointing, boring closer?"

**kappyko**: "kind of a cool experiment in gothy pop. rlly dreamy. nico vibes"

**chihuahuazero**: "The atmosphere and the hair-raising outro gives the album title its potency."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The melody and production are gorgeous, but I'm not sure if I would listen to this regularly."

**SkyBlade79**: "such a boring and samey song…"

**4Roux**: "It sounds so misty and strange, and the final buildup was very frightening. But it works well as a long interlude between Love in Stereo and Everything Is Embarassing."

I am so sad that my absolute favorite song from True Romance, and this entire rate is already out on the first day. In this message I also want to commence my personal vendetta against /u/gannade, maymiranda  die out soon (oh wait she already do)

---
**MrSwearword**: "Her vocals don’t match the vibe of the song, but this is inoffensive [read as: not shitty]"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is the song that was teased in the intro of Nuclear Seasons, and holy fuck, is it transcendent. It’s a moment of pop perfection that blends a great set of verses, with a back and forth pre-chorus that leads to the best possible climax of the album, a euphoric proclamation of pure and unrestrained love. There’s not a single second on this song that’s wasted, and just when you think it’s done, there’s one of the best textures on the outro, a crazy arrangement of vocal samples that finish off this masterpiece"

**Zamomattel**: "So unmemorable, not necessarily bad but Charli can do SO MUCH better"

**icedarkling**: "so underrated and one of her best songs!"

**VeganSquash**: "part of me thinks this song is cool af bc of those off key vocals in the background but...the lyrics are so meh"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "this is my least favorite song OOPS"

**whatsapilot**: "boring"

**Altiondsols**: "feels so fucking long lmao"

**therokinrolla**: "The layered vocals are shivering. Then you get even more shook as you transition into a beautiful chorus and later a chilling bridge. The lyrics aren’t even that good but simply the production and delivery serves more E•MO•TION than most other songs ever could."

**deschaussettes**: "creepy ass song and beat 👌"

**mokitsu**: "This song makes me cry :'-("

**awhile2**: "Queen of sampling herself"

**vapourlomo**: "This is okay, but man I could really go for some of that Sucker bubblegum punk energy right about now."

**gannade**: "this song scares me tbh. it sounds like some kind of ritual im not feeling it"

**elitefourbrad**: "I can’t stand Charli screaming in the background of this song, and the way she talk sings is not good."

**jamesfog**: "Something just felt... off in this song."

**yunglethe**: "i have never seen the appeal of this song, but it doesn't sound as bad as some of these other songs"

**kappyko**: "digging the production but wtf is that backing vocal sample"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "So generic but Charli's British whispering saves everything"

**SkyBlade79**: "You know it’s going to be good as soon as that production starts… it’s just so interesting and makes the song such a B O P. The sustained notes are amazing and I’m surprised that this song is so underrated on popheads, it’s very Lorde-esque."

**MrSwearword**: "I heard this like six times already. ENOUGH."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oh my lord, this is such a good closer. Straight 80s with some iconic synths and honestly I can’t get over how good this is."

**Zamomattel**: "Good album closer, very typical of the rest of the album"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "and here the production reminds me of Sky's album"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "and ending it off with this recurring theme of 80% of the album sounding the same. this is my first and last time listening to this record"

**Altiondsols**: "Eh. Started really strong, kinda fell apart near the end"

**therokinrolla**: "yike"

**deschaussettes**: "HAIM does hey hos better than the lumineers"

**mokitsu**: "I definitely won't call Haim's name anytime soon"

**vapourlomo**: "Like the classic early-80s albums that Haim clearly modeled Days Are Gone after, it ends on the album's most boring song."

**elitefourbrad**: "This is just the perfect song to listen to tease that SO you just broke up with and you want to be a bitch and tease them with “those eyes”."

**jamesfog**: "A sensual closer, I live"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Decent enough, but this is almost indistinguishable from a generic feel-good song they play on religious radio stations. Why did HAIM have to end this album with three extremely mediocre songs?"

**SkyBlade79**: "their voice sounds pretty good in this song, unlike lots of others. Repetitive as always."

**MrSwearword**: "It’s like an 80s soundtrack and that’s actually a compliment in this case."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I will, I will I will I will!! Oh my god, this song would get a ton more recognition if it was earlier in the album."

**Zamomattel**: "Definitely not awful, just so forgettable"

**therokinrolla**: "i really dont like this either"

**deschaussettes**: "eh"

**vapourlomo**: "There's not a lot to this song, but the new wave groove sounds super familiar. It's the kind of thing our parents would've jammed to in high school in 1981 driving around at night in their beat-up El Caminos."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "more like I Wig"

**elitefourbrad**: "Another great song on this album which has Sky’s vocals overpowered by the guitar, what I can hear is amazing though."

**jamesfog**: "I Will stan for Sky"

**skiddos**: "I love this album so much but I feel like I need to take Advil after this"

**kappyko**: "my rankings of songs titled "i will": beatles > sky ferreira > radiohead. i think there's a danny brown song called i will too but i heard its about eatin pussy lol"

**SkyBlade79**: "I really hate these vocal effects. The real Sky knows that putting vocal effects on your voice rarely sounds good. This hurts my head."

**4Roux**: "This was featured in a horror movie I was dragged into, it's how I discovered Sky who is now one of my faves, so this song will always have a special place in my heart... I love the slow fade-in and fade-out, makes it feel like it has no real beginning and end, and the aggressive lyrics ("Pretend that I'm shy, I laugh when you cry", "I kiss like a lie")"

**MrSwearword**: "deliciously wacky and I like that."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Ahh, I love this song. It’s got a crazy instrumental, and the way she delivers the vocals is so chill yet savage."

**Zamomattel**: "Nice & strong lyrics but a bit repetitive"

**therokinrolla**: "the verses are super yikes but the chorus barely recovers it into a 7"

**deschaussettes**: "the video game-like effects are SO GOOD"

**vapourlomo**: "Grunge-meets-new wave is pretty much the overarching sound of Night Time, My Time, and Ain't Your Right might have the most seamless blend of the two styles."

**elitefourbrad**: "Too repetitive for me and repetitive lyrics should stay in EDM and not this indie queen’s album."

**jamesfog**: "it ain't your right to snatch my weave, sky. but i'm letting you do it sis"

**skiddos**: "I love the melody for this one!!"

**yunglethe**: "the opening is so fun! but then it turns so repetitive :("

**kappyko**: "she has really pretty vocals here. would it be wrong to say shoegaze vibes?"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I started to realise how heavy this album was when I reached this track. It'sa pretty decent song, all things considered."

**SkyBlade79**: "hey, you can say whatever you want, THIS SKY knows that freedom of speech is real. However, I can also say that this song is too boring and her voice just sound really weak"

**Nfranklin50**: "Another song where the production is going crazy and I can't hear a word anyone is saying"
