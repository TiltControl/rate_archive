The 2013 Ariel Rechtshaid Rate: Days Are Gone vs. True Romance vs. Night Time, My Time!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/635xmk/the_2013_ariel_rechtshaid_rate_days_are_gone_vs/

Back in 2013, three female acts released their first albums, all with the help of the same man, Ariel Rechtshaid. All of these acts are also expected to drop a new album this year, so what better way to celebrate this than to take a look back at their previous albums! (We don't talk about Sucker)

##[HAIM - Days Are Gone]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/Haim_-_Days_Are_Gone.png)

Haim is a sister act, consisting of [Este]( http://static.gigwise.com/artists/wenn21497887.jpg), [Danielle]( http://www4.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Danielle+Haim+Glastonbury+Festival+Day+2+rc5fi4aTOZYl.jpg), and [Alana]( https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/482856354864852992/cl_LYqPR.jpeg) Haim. They have been making msuic together since they were young, appearing in several bands together throughout the years, but in 2007 they decided to form their own band, named after their own last names. They had a slow start, but upon their first EP, *Falling*, they started to gain more attention. Shortly after the release, they were signed to Polydor Records, who recommended them working together with Ariel Rechtshaid.

The result is a beautiful pop-rock record with R&B and hip-hop influences. The record was received with critical acclaim, also ending up on several year-end lists, #6 on the Billboard top 200, and #1 on the UK album chart. It has also been certified gold on the latter chart.

##[Charli XCX - True Romance](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Charli_XCX_-_True_Romance.png)
[Charli XCX](http://static.idolator.com/uploads/2013/03/15/charliXCX-sxsw-22-600x450.jpg), also knows as Charlotte Aitichison is an English pop artist. While True Romance is her first Album, she had released 2 mixtapes (*Heartbreaks and Earthquakes* and *Super Ultra*) and some singles before. *True Romance* is a raw synthpop record, in her own words *exploring every corner of her own romantic history*. This album is still my favorite album of hers, although her upcoming 2017 album may change that.

##[Sky Ferreira - Night Time, My Time](https://e.snmc.io/lk/f/l/5f1c3dc82f2b8549352e43e765d7c62e/5031708.png)
[Sky Tonia Ferreira](http://s33.postimg.org/jk8z4w827/Sky-_Ferreira-by-_Hedi-_Slimane01.jpg) is an American pop artist. She was discovered through her MySpace page when she was 14, and subsequently signed to Parlophone when she was 17. Her first album has been delayed multiple times. It was first meant to be released in early 2011 but after the flopping of the lead singles (*17*, *One*, and *Obsession*), her budget was cut and she instead released the EP *[As If!](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aTIGlhSo1bL8QUg/giphy.gif)*. If you listen to these songs you can see a complete shift in her musical style and artstyle compared to *Night Time, My Time*. After that EP, she announced her album to be released in 2012 under the name ~~*Wild at Heart*~~ *I'm not Alright* (wait, it's *I Will* after all). But in 2012 she didn't release an LP either, instead released the EP *Ghost!*

In 2012 she also met up with Ariel Rechtshaid, who she wrote almost the entire final album with. The album was then finally released on 29 october 2013, and was met with favorable reviews.

**Rules - PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS BEFORE SENDING ME YOUR SCORES!**

**SERIOUSLY, PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS, EVEN IF YOU'VE PARTICIPATED IN RATES BEFORE**

**PLEASE**

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots**: giving a 7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache. This is because I'm using a computer program to parse the votes and print everything out (more on that later).
* Yes, you have to listen to every song. I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program (more on that later). Every album is on Spotify, and I've also provided a ton of Youtube links to help you. No excuses!
* Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.
* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is ONE song total, **NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM**. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results.
* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.
* I am using a computer program that the wonderful /u/letsallpoo designed in order to parse these votes! You can see it [here](https://github.com/jnlu/popheads/blob/master/popheads.py). While this will make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. **The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link at the bottom of this post. PLEASE USE THAT.** You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
* If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.
* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!


This is correct:

> Omanko: 1 oh a christian song :/

These are INCORRECT:

> Omanko: 1: oh a christian song :/

> Omanko: oh a christian song :/ 1

> Omanko: I'm giving this a 1 because it's a christian song :/

> Omanko: 1-oh a christian song :/

> Omanko: 1 (oh a christian song :/)

> Omanko: 1 - oh a christian song :/

**Please send in your rates before 1 may using [this premade message!](https://goo.gl/4gibZo) You just need to fill it in.**
