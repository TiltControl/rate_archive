=====

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (8): Someone beat me to the hi tonight joke damn it

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): Yeah this is one of the most forgettable songs on the album for me but I still like it and enjoy it when I‚Äôm listening to it, the hook is just a little bit underwhelming and dynamically it barely surpasses the verses.

---

## Going Insane (for the song)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Could‚Äôve gone diamond if it were a single.

**ernie** (10): my favorite bside from this side of the album, something about it is just chef‚Äôs kiss 3d emote

**jay duh** (10): its honestly appalling how great this is, this could be an ariana track and it'd chart for at least 94 weeks tbh

**thegolding** (10): Call Me Tonight is so underrated. It's such a bop with a dark vibe but also a wholesome melody. Queen sh*t

**BaconShoes** (9.5): the tove lo serve

**runaway3212** (8): pickup line queen

**MToms** (7.8): why did she choose to sing Ay-oh though

**1998tweety** (7.5): this is fine

**afs** (7.5): please don't pour Ava Max in a glass

**jordannimz** (7): Yet another song that is simply good bopping material. Not much to say other than I like it a lot.

**oscarbrierley1** (7): I like the chorus but the rest is forgettable.

**SmileAndTears** (7): Not a flop but not exactly a gag either

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it's fun but thats it

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): ayo?

**shipperondeck** (6.3): idk why her AYOOOOOs send me every time

## Probably won‚Äôt call her tonight

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): yass, generic song numero dos!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Oh I get it! Her name isn‚Äôt really Tonight!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): She sounds a lil bored here, I think she knew that she was making a filler track, but the strings are nice.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): pretty fillery, and not that fun

**ImADudeDuh** (6): omg Hungry Eyes was a reference to the Heardle on July 5 2022

**static\_int\_husp** (6): this is the second song I forgot was on this album

**vayyiqra** (6): The guitar is making this sound like a B-side by Aqua, but there are worse things to sound like, I guess.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): this is just boring

**bulforster** (5.4): hmm

**CrimsonROSET** (5): either go ayo or a-yo ay-o is not an option maxine

**frogaranaman** (5): "call me a nine" absolutely not

**starla\_** (5): this sounds like a yassified country song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): hi tonight i‚Äôm dad

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): wtf is that AYO in the chorus DASUJDHSAKJ i hate that

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Is she saying A-Yo

**fairytalehigh** (4): unearthly boring, next

**hikk** (4): hmm no i don't think i will. maybe if this song was less boring i would.

**seanderlust** (4): "if you don't know my name then you can just call me tonight" BOOOO TOMATO TOMATO

**skargardin** (4): Well anyway..

## Going insane (because of the song)

**2dina3dworld** (3.5): the glass line has to be a bottom tier innuendo

**nlh1013** (3.5): the lyrics are pretty cheesy

**ricki** (2): i admire the insistence to keeping the title of the song despite it not fitting the song scheme nor rhyming with a single phrase

**akanewasright** (1): I kinda despise this song DJFHJD. Tove Lo is an artist and songwriter I like a lot, but every now and then she makes a song that just sounds ugly to me, and this is one of them. But on top of that‚Ä¶ I can hear her version of the song in my head, and while I think her version of the song would at least have a fitting edge to the vocals. Ava‚Äôs performance on the song is very much lacking in edge, spirit, or anything beyond high school theater kid energy

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): For the fact that this is just an intro track (well not anymore I guess), I‚Äôm surprised to see this make day 2, although that‚Äôs probably more reflective of the quality of the rest of the rate, but i do really like this track, the synths sound really good and it just has some really cool moments

**plastichaxan** (7): Her adding my head & my heart before she starts the concept of the album with this‚Ä¶ We couldn‚Äôt process her genius

---

## Successfully helped an interlude to day 2!

**1998tweety** (10): I'm ascending. Give me a full album of this please.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ava really belongs in the early 2010s, but I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôve got miss icon in this era

**hikk** (10): it's just a gag. the instrumental part reaches through my ear canals to caress my brain folds and suddenly ava max has infiltrated and overtaken my mind

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): god I love intros so badly they fucken rule.

**ricki** (10): ava's team were on the path to make the best song in existence and decided to keep it shorter than 2 minutes

**Vromega** (10): TOO SHOOOOORT. This song is so so good

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): i know she's getting the chopping block reeeeeeeal early but i gotta give flowers to the production, it fucking knocks

**jordannimz** (9.5): Ok so this is the opener for the standard edition of the album, and it's a really cute production-based intro. Cirkut went off tbh.

**ernie** (9): this and take you to hell are my favorite intros ever they both deserve to be longer than the time they currently have.

**jay duh** (9): not much to say just a godly anthem take us to church queen

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Low-key one of the most ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù moments on the album, the synths are really cool.

**jexan13** (8.5): Why does this sounds like a quirky Right Words, Wrong Time by CRJ

**BaconShoes** (8): kinda slays as an intro tbh

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): hey kids spelling is fun!

**runaway3212** (8): does not deserve the hate she‚Äôs a queen idc

**sunsetspt1** (8): Cool production

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): great opener till they forced my head and my heart into the opening spot like why

**Uberpigeon** (8): this is art pop

**MToms** (7.5): pleasantly surprised with the output till now

**afs** (7): what this doesn't even STAND for anything? even Dua Lipa had a political stand

**arne** (7): it's giving 2012 minecraft youtuber intro

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it‚Äôs a cute intro I guess

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://gfycat.com/SpeedyDiligentBigmouthbass

**RoyalBloodFool** (7): S-E-V-E-N, Seven's what you sound

**shipperondeck** (7): the instrumentation sounds like this one vocaloid song i loved back in the day (crystalline feat. gumi) but i don't get why this is literally just an interlude

**SmileAndTears** (7): it's fine as an intro, and i guess it establishes the concept/theme of the album but lets be real for a second here. No one listens to Ava Max for lyrics or themes or w/e. it's about the bangers, and this isn't one

**vayyiqra** (7): Expecting to hate this because of the corny title but it's nice. And an original? Cirkut must be a better producer than I thought.

**babadork** (6.5): While I like parts of the song, I wish they had eased up on the distorted vocals.

**seanderlust** (6.5): this is one elementary school game reference away from being a melanie martinez song

## Tried their best to prevent it but ultimately failed :(

**CrimsonROSET** (6): taylor said spelling is fun and this rate is prove people believed her

**DaHumanTorch** (6): spelling is fun or whatever

**cremeebrulee** (5.8): now bestie what does this stand for.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): sounds like a generic EDM-intro for a Minecraft YouTuber

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): we love unnecessary intro songs!

**bulforster** (5): hmm

**celladonn** (5): I'm trying to think of something funny that H.E.A.V.E.N could be an acronym for but I don't think it's worth expending that much energy on this song

**fadedblue09** (5): It's fine but shouldn't this be the intro? Edit: Apparently it originally was, oop

**flavasavavandal** (5): actually outtalented Porter

**frogaranaman** (5): I just listened to this and can‚Äôt remember the melody at ALLLLLL

**jackisboredtoday** (5): this intro exists for no reason beyond the incredibly weak concept that she threw away after like a month to tack on MH&MH anyway, so its basically just empty space

**letsallpoo** (5): im glad cirkut had a good time

**nicol(y)as(s)** (5): this sounds like a zedd produced track (derogatory)

**static\_int\_husp** (5): yep, that's an interlude

**Stryxen** (5): she‚Äôs so funny for ruining the point of this track as an intro just so she could put one of her hits at the start for more streams

**throwaway-7650** (5): S P E L L I N G I S F U N ! - miss americana & the radio terrorist

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): this feels so pointless, it sounds like the music that would play on the outro of a kpop video where they're showing some bloopers and credits

**akanewasright** (4): I mean it‚Äôs produced well but this song has nothing of substance

**apatel27** (4): It was good as an opener but second on the album? Nah

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I was trying to come up with some cheeky acronym for this comment but this song is too mediocre and forgettable to use that amount of brain power on.

**LesApfels** (4): It's bargain bin Turn Off the Light

**nlh1013** (4): I think I would like it more without the spelling bc the music is actually ok

**welcome2thejam** (4): Honestly, smart move to make the change to start off with the previous song

**MassiveThief** (3): ...k

**TheQueenOfVultures** (3): Its an interlude alright

**skargardin** (2): Thinking about how My Head & My Heart being added to the album rendered this song's intro status completely useless.

**TiltControls** (2): It's one thing to be an interlude, it's another to be a bad one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): first of all why is this not the album opener. secondly those synths at the end sound absolutely awful

**Awkward\_King** (0): this song is so vile im sorry what in the melanie martinez knockoff 2015 floppery

**pig-serpent** (0): It feels wrong that Ava Max has the most boring song in a rate with 17 Madison Beer songs in it.

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): gamer montage music (naur)

Thedoctordances1940: **plastichaxan** (7.5): I can‚Äôt believe the average isn‚Äôt even 6.5 yet dfskjfsk

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Yeah I‚Äôm not all too fond of this tbh, like especially the opening is kinda annoying but it‚Äôs cute enough

\## There should be no reason to tank Madison!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Emma\_Roberts\_smiling\_while\_covered\_in\_blood.jpg

**jay duh** (10): maybe im just super emotional right now but i could cry.. she is everything genuinely

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): "She took her time with this album and it shows. Every song is 20/10 and literally not a single skip in this album. Not only is the sound of her music so beautiful, but the meaning is so touching, IM SO IMPRESSED."

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song is so sad i can't listen to it but wow does it tie the album together perfectly and any song that can make me cry is an automatic 10

**jordannimz** (9): Her vocals here are beyond beautiful and I adore the violin in the second verse. This song feels simple in the best way.

**starla\_** (8.5): interesting production

**1998tweety** (8): gives off Spongebob vibes idk why

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Okay vocoder!

**fairytalehigh** (8): i love that weird vocal effect in the background, it's one of the best parts of this album

**ricki** (8): This whole rate left me a little confused on Madison, because her whole public imagine is very *TikTok baddie Ariana Grande clone*, but a lot of the album felt like it was trying to go for a sound on a more melancholic, almost Indie feel, which felt reminiscent of Lana del Rey, but with more of an electric sensibility. The whole time I'm listening I'm trying to figure out who she could work with to be able to make that sound properly, and listening to this song it hit me. The sad girl vibes, the heavy, prominent basses, the distorted voices... She wants to achieve the sound Billie Eilish has mastered. She wants a heavy, dark sound for the more dim topics, but still likes to release fun bops (and hopefully receive the public attention that Billie's biggest hits have gotten). I think with the right producers and songwriters she could very much achieve it properly, and not have her next album feel so confused in sound. GIVE MADISON A STUDIO SESSION WITH FINNEAS, I WANT TO SEE HER USE THE MOST OUT OF HER POTENTIAL.

**afs** (7.5): that's a lie

**celladonn** (7.5): a cute little moment elevated by the production

**nlh1013** (7.5): another one about my ex lmao she could know him

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): this would be a fine ending by itself. I don't think this album needs a separate outro

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): i wish my ex said the same thing.

**pig-serpent** (7): Is there a name for the style of country I can only describe as "sad spongebob music?" See this and "Kansas Remembers Me Now."

**akanewasright** (6.5): the title made me want to tank but the melody is nice and it‚Äôs less insufferable than I thought it would be

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): that intro‚Ä¶ where is Louie Zong‚Äôs check?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): this feels like a song I would enjoy if I were invested in the singer‚Äôs life and persona, but I sadly am not, so this is just a mildly pretty ballad with personal but plain lyrics

**anothertown** (6): you know what go on girl and do your thing i guess

**bulforster** (6): yas

**CrimsonROSET** (6): hyperpop

**flavasavavandal** (6): this is country-coded

**skargardin** (6): i mean the vocals are pretty

**thegolding** (6): HER VOCALS HERE THO. Perfect actual final song.

## There kinda is

**vayyiqra** (5): This slightly country-ish sound (ignore the vocal effects, I mean the brushes on the drums and the guitar) is not something anyone wanted from Madison Beer but it's okay.

**thisusernameisntlong** (4.5): vote for the vocaloid rate

**BaconShoes** (3): not for me i‚Äôm sorry

**DaHumanTorch** (3): ok then madison, what reason does this song have for being here?

**fadedblue09** (3): Sorry this was embarrassing

**hikk** (3): ok what's up with her having these boring ass instrumentals but then randomly throwing in a cool ass synth for half a second

**Roxieloxie** (3): me when i get caught staging photos at a black lives matter protest

**shipperondeck** (2): the melodrama is just so painfully unenjoyable. keep this in the teeny bopper disney channel specials thank you

**Awkward\_King** (1): ok

**frogaranaman** (1): Can't Stop Falling In Love melody ass

**ImADudeDuh** (1): no it don‚Äôt

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): this sounds like she wanted to make 4 songs in one and it does not work at All

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): The dark synths on this song are genuinely so fucking good and I don‚Äôt know why this ended up barely making day 2, this deserved a lot better!

**plastichaxan** (6): Kinda underrated this awe

---

## Screaming out her name 

**AHSWeeknd** (10): STEP ON ME MOMMY

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this smash, easily the best album cut here

**ernie** (10): another great song from this album

**fairytalehigh** (10): i wanted to give this like, a 3, but "GET YOU HIGH IN MY CABANA" is just so fucking stupid, it's breathtaking

**jay duh** (10): GAGGGGGG cause why does she just constantly slay and always out-do herself? THE OUTRO? She said what needed to be said and did it gracefully. All she did was scream a bit into the mic but i really dgaf shes right in every aspect and i back her

**jexan13** (10): poisoned your faves

**jordannimz** (10): Such a dark, sexy groove. Giving me Turn Off The Light vibes. Oh, and I love vocoder so much. And the double-time outro with the whistles????? SO GOOD

**SmileAndTears** (10): mmghhhhfff...

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): easily the second best song off this chapter.

**hikk** (9): horror synth

**starla\_** (8.5): this sounds like a eurovision song - that's a compliment

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): love the haunting vibe and whistle tones!!

**thegolding** (8.5): I really love the metaphores she's able to make in her songs. I'm not saying she's Carole King but she's a pretty good writter and Belladona is a good a example.

**1998tweety** (8): would be much higher with a better chorus

**afs** (8): misheard her saying "poisonous contagious get you high unlike obama" and ngl that was a missed opportunity

**anothertown** (8): let's go goth queens

**BaconShoes** (8): okay miss ava hit those high notes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): She‚Äôs dark-sided. So twisted. devil emoji

**MassiveThief** (8): so cheesy but DAMN IT'S GOOD

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.9): "get you high in my cabana" has the same energy "hula hula so good you take me to the jeweler" does, aka taking me out of a good song

**MToms** (7.5): I like these evil church ghost vibes

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): the production is neat but the song is definitely brought down by the chorus

**2dina3dworld** (7): good idea, but slightly poor execution

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): People hyped this song up so much in the lead up to the album and I don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶ like it‚Äôs fine I guess but it‚Äôs a bit sluggish? I wish it were even more overdramatic and goth.

**runaway3212** (7): queen I also lie literally always for no discernible reason

**shipperondeck** (6.6): omg whistle tone ava at the endü§©ü§©ü§©

**jasannn** (6.5): that breakdown saved the song

**bulforster** (6.2): yas

**astrologicalangel** (6): the high notes are super impressive, but the lyrics make next to no sense to me

**Bordersz** (6): She was singing DOWN on this, I did not know she has a higher register like that. I feel like she's wasting her vocals.

**fadedblue09** (6): Kinda ambivalent towards the darker songs on this album

**welcome2thejam** (6): Ooh, an extra point for speeding up the instrumental on the outro, sounded real nice

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): stevie nicks outsold

**rotating3Dtext** (5.5): the only good part is the synth. maybe

## Not _that_ hard to forget her

**ImADudeDuh** (5): she says belladonna in a way that i feel makes italians angry. ca

**skargardin** (5): Whatever she's trying to sell here it wasn't successful

**static\_int\_husp** (4.5): more like Bella-yawn-a

**majid** (4): this is as bland as oatmeal sdgjslkg

**nlh1013** (4): not into the lyrics or melody

**oscarbrierley1** (4): because the rest of the album is so camp this kinda feels like a flop note. And the whistle notes are so grating and over produced to me.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (4): Many of her songs feel like theyre written with a rhyming dictonary open (belladonna/cabana)

**vayyiqra** (4): I feel like Ava thinks this is a really original and clever to write a song about there being a poisonous flower whose name means "pretty lady", as if this is highly obscure knowledge. She is very edgy indeed. Watch out: she is sweet, but also she is psycho!

**RandomHypnotica** (3.5): she sounds like a vocaloid on the chorus (derogatory)

**akanewasright** (3): please these lyrics üò≠

**CrimsonROSET** (3): she is allergic to rhyming i swear

**pig-serpent** (3): Super cool combination of boring and annoying.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): floppadonna

**celladonn** (2): I really hate the way she says belladonna and she says it so many times

**Awkward\_King** (1): belladona where the hell have you been loca

**frogaranaman** (1): whatever it is she's doing in the chorus should stop

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): Belladonna- an italian word meaning "beautiful lady" but also can be explained as a DEADLY NIGHTSHADE because of the plant named Belladonna that can makes us high if overused. "Her songs are like the oxygen for the humans NECESSARY".

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): that fucking chorus‚Ä¶i almost gave this a 0 from how awful that was

**TiltControls** (0): Camp is too kind a word for this

**plastichaxan** (8): Ugh she has the mind of a mastermind

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): I do really like this but I wish the climax it was building up to was bigger, like the first chorus with the plucked guitar notes feels like it‚Äôs building up to something big but it never really does, this could have been her IKTE moment but alas

---

##  Yassing and Slaying (in a sad way)

**AHSWeeknd** (11): I AM IN IMMENSE PAIN

**1998tweety** (10): the BEST song on the album

**jay duh** (10): god this song live... ive watched too many videos of her just shattering the universe and altering reality as we know it with this chorus

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Outsold Beyonce in making a countdown song? Well no but I do like this a lot.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The slayage of the song allows me to overlook the kinda lame usage of counting‚Ä¶ like yeah it‚Äôs a bit corny but she sells it. ‚ÄúRighteous indignation‚Äù is very much her wheelhouse I guess.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): so relatable lol

**BaconShoes** (8): she said the album name!

**jordannimz** (8): On an album filled with vintage-meets-modern pop, the guitar and the 6/8 timing makes this song feel the most vintage. I really love the lyrical imagery here.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): if Olivia is actually dating Zach Bia, why didn‚Äôt she listen to this song first

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): nice countdown

**bulforster** (7.4): yass

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): her motion sickness slay

**afs** (7): "curses in cursive" that's Ariana's job

**akanewasright** (7): I always forget the name of this song, but it‚Äôs one of the tighter melodies on the album

**fadedblue09** (7): Some of the lyrics here are‚Ä¶.choices but otherwise tolerable

**skargardin** (7): we love hidden album titles!

**static\_int\_husp** (7): this is decent but lors this album is getting too long

**seanderlust** (6.5): "you probably deserve it" why is everyone in this rate so TOXIC

**oscarbrierley1** (6): someone with a great voice could turn this out (kellyoke maybe). As it is it's kinda boring.

**vayyiqra** (6): Probably the only ballad-y song this album really needed.

**celladonn** (5.5): This one's a bit boring I fear

## Stop counting down in songs

**CrimsonROSET** (5): her countdown moment

**DaHumanTorch** (5): gowns, beautiful gowns

**fairytalehigh** (5): girl what the fuck are you seriously making me give credit to "wish you were gay"

**frogaranaman** (5): did Madison Beer forget about the number two

**Roxieloxie** (5): me when im phobe bridgers in an alternate universe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): go to therapy

**TheQueenOfVultures** (4): This album has the same issue as SOUR where I truly cannot stand to hear about this relationship by the end because its so boring and all she does is mope about it for 4 songs without covering any new ground

**Awkward\_King** (3): she said the name of the movie in the movie omg

**shipperondeck** (3): i don't know this is overall so disappointing

**pig-serpent** (2): Yeah, I guess this album wouldn't have been complete without the stock 6/8 ballad.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): not the tape sounds!

## I‚Äôm not gonna mention every comment this user made about their ex but it‚Äôs kinda funny I like it

**nlh1013** (8): THIS IS ALSO ABOUT MY EX

## Good

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Covid put the OVER in Taylor Swift‚Äôs LOVER.

**ernie** (10): best single from this era, would‚Äôve been second best if they added dear society on here

**jay duh** (10): probably the best song ive ever heard in my entire life since conception to this moment in time june 16th 2022 2:53 pm EST in south florida on the east side not the west like my fucking god

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): Lover is over? And she made spelling fun?? This is a Taylor diss track Madison you need to be careful.

**BaconShoes** (9): catchy chorus with some spooky vibes

**celladonn** (9): serve

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This came out too late, if this had been released during the Hot Topic/tumblr era it would have dominated the AMV scene.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Madison: can spell, Alanis: doesn‚Äôt grasp the meaning of irony, so who‚Äôs the better writer of woman-scorned anthems?! She should just have leaned into saying "put the ex in sex" though

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): spelling queen

**jexan13** (8.5): ended homole

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): idk what the guy did but I'm on her side

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): she ended classical music in the MV which is automatically +2 points

**anothertown** (8): you're killing my vibe in ways that words cannot describe!!!!!!

**DaHumanTorch** (8): madison has definitely posted a blurry picture of a night out on instagram and captioned it "low quality pic high quality night üíÉüíÉ"

**jordannimz** (8): I really love the electric guitar in this song. And the last chorus?? you put the over in lover, put the ex in next, AIN'T NO I IN TROUBLE ‚Äî gets me hyped every time.

**pig-serpent** (8): A haunting song but going full trap pop throws off the vibe even if the chorus is good.

**skargardin** (8): wait this serves

**sunsetspt1** (8): Grower

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): it's catchy and fun but i don't love the lyrics i the chorus (and i'm someone who doesn't really care about lyrics lol)

**Vromega** (8): great chorus

**shipperondeck** (7.9): i think she got lucky here bc i don't much care for her voice or her sound overall... trust me, it's not looking good for miss beer rn

**akanewasright** (7.5): Now I like this song, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs Madison‚Äôs song. It sounds like it was written a few steps higher and transposed down for her, like she‚Äôs doing a cover of this song on Glee

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): oh fuck me why is this kinda catchy

**hikk** (7.5): ended sam smith or something is that even what their song is called? idk

**MToms** (7.5): Love the production on this, spelling lyrics takes it down a notch

**afs** (7): sPeleleligngg uss a aUduunn fUNNN!!!!

**fadedblue09** (7): The lyrics make me crack up fir some reason

**ImADudeDuh** (7): sends me that blake shelton already made a song with this exact premise

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): spelling is fun i guess

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): lyrically it kinda feels like early billie stuff (overly dramatic)

**Bordersz** (6.2): A bit generic but still catchy.

**DirtyRat583** (6.1): the lyrics are a bit üò∂ girl u can do so much better

**majid** (6): i mean her vocals are technically good but there‚Äôs nothing really interesting happening here

**SmileAndTears** (6): splling is fuuuun

**bulforster** (5.4): hmm

## Goodbye

**frogaranaman** (5): sounds like a song from a ripoff high school production of High School Musical

**MassiveThief** (5): I mean I like how it sounds... but these lyrics are just so 6th grade english class. Enough to pretty much ruin this song for me.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): she needs to dodge bullets better/get more special effects. im not supporting her here and i hate to do that.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): shes trying way too hard to be edgy in this

**TiltControls** (5): If the vocals were just slightly better I'd probably love this.

**vayyiqra** (5): Can't listen to this without hearing "you put the ovary-" lol.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Hey kids spelling is fun etc. etc.

**fairytalehigh** (4.1): the melody in the chorus is kinda cool but the "hey dumb boy!!!!1 let me spell it out for you!!!!!" lyrics are giving GAYLE (derogatory)

**Roxieloxie** (4): me when im not dua lipa

**runaway3212** (4): I loved this until akane pointed out that it sounds like she‚Äôs singing a song modulated lower to fit her range which spilled but also I cannot anyway in conclusion stan/cancel akane for getting music more than me

**seanderlust** (4): fall out boy's "the best part of believe is the lie" lyric outsold

**Awkward\_King** (3): oh boy i am not gonna like this album

**babadork** (3): I am generally anti-spelling.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): s(he) be(lie)ve(d)

**indie\_fan\_** (3): Not every song can make spelling sound fine in music. This is not one of those songs.

**apatel27** (2): don't spell in songs k ty

**oscarbrierley1** (2): this is just a bunch of sayings stitched together into a song.

**ricki** (1): you cant spell awesome without ME!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): and i put the "holy" in holy shit who thought this awful chorus was a good idea

**Stryxen** (0): oh my god that was horrible this is like tiktok hit lyricism where they have one barebones idea and attempt to make a whole song out of it

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (7.5): I mean it‚Äôs true

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): I feel like this title is a little bit too long and clunky for me but it is kinda funny

---

## Ava is just one big hit away from being a main pop girl, I swear!

**AHSWeeknd** (11): This is the funniest one but also the most truthful one here

**DirtyRat583** (11): you're gonna make me cry AVA HAS NOT BEEN UP-AND-COMING FOR 3 YEARS I DO NOT BELIEVE IT

**Jexan13** (11): the amount of shade. Absolutely perfect

**notsomainpoplietoc** (11): oh boy they've been up and coming for three years this is their moment!

**seanderlust** (11): please the passive aggression in this one sends

**arne** (10): we're feeling sassy today huh

**fairytalehigh** (10): where are the lies

**Stryxen** (10): t

**welcome2thejam** (10): This and the official NSMPG title helped sell me on the rate tbh

**majid** (9): ava max is this generation's david bowie <3

**pig-serpent** (9): lol

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): LMFAO!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like the concept but it feels like a bit of a misnomer considering Madison Beer is here.

**violet** (8): :plsssfast:

**frog (i guess)!** (7): I mean it's true they really have been trying

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): This has the same problem with the above but it's more intriguing at least

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): very true for Zara, I guess it‚Äôs been 3 years for Ava, & Madison I think you need to be up to be up and coming

**TiltControls** (6.5): a bit wordy, but pretty funny

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): i appreciate the shadiness but it's a bit lengthy and doesn't really work the greatest as a title

**vayyiqra** (6): Not my favourite but I laughed the hardest at this one I think. However I don't think it's a joke with much repeat value.

## Not after this rate they won‚Äôt be

**indie\_fan\_** (5): I think "Delayed Up-And-Comers" woulda been shorter and better.

**ricki** (5): she was a rough working title but it did a well enough job in the marketing department

**RandomHypnotica** (4): kinda a mouthful tbh

**afs** (3.1): this is the only situation where I'll use a score that isn't divisible by .5

**1998tweety** (3): this would have to be updated constantly, therefore inaccurate

**SLAYdedblue09** (3): a mouthful

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): actually zara has been up and coming for at least 5 years now

**shipperondeck** (2): it's true but too long smh

**flavasavavandal** (0): I feel like this title does a disservice to how long Zara has been "up-and-coming"

**runaway3212** (0): actually ava max came all over europe

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (9): Mind of a mastermind moment part 2

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): This is a good song that made around the middle of day 2 which I think is about fair but I don‚Äôt really have much more to say about it than that.

---

## Me seeing people tanking in the rate

**AHSWeeknd** (10): that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve become emotionless‚Äù hits hard

**jay duh** (10): yup fuck you @jackgilinsky

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): im so predictable. put backwards vocals on a song and i‚Äôll eat it up

**TiltControls** (9.5): The standout of the album. It's not as deep as I think it wants to be, but it's performed well

**babadork** (9.3): There is enough that is really good about this song to overcome the Alka-Seltzer bit, but I still can‚Äôt completely forget about it.

**jordannimz** (9): This song just gets me... maybe that's not a good thing, but I do love this song. The verses have such a good groove and I love her vocal delivery.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): emo as fuck (affectionate)

**skargardin** (9): Wait this is definitely a favorite so far

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): the way I did this rate

**emayzee** (8.7): she's kinda in her twenty one pilots bag here and it works

**celladonn** (8.5): this album really is like if Melanie Martinez was good

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): like me, it seems

**BaconShoes** (8): catchy and a vibe

**fadedblue09** (8): Some awkward lyrical choices aside this is actually decent

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): TOO LATE TO GO OUT! TOO YOUNG TO STAY IN

**jexan13** (7.5): one of the weaker ones

**nlh1013** (7.5): this is where the album really started to click for me! I like the play on the keep calm saying

**1998tweety** (7): she's ok

**afs** (7): omg she really got her listeners' feelings towards this

**akanewasright** (7): the title line is somewhat obnoxious, but the beat helps give the song some life

**arne** (7): ok this album is actually pretty neat

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is amateur hour I came out of the womb being a hater.

**cremeebrulee** (7): this catchphrase being the worst thing to come from britain actually

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): love the chorus to this one but the rest of it is kinda lacking

**runaway3212** (7): me doing this rate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): love a depression bop

**vayyiqra** (7): Very early 2000s type beat.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): this song is almost great, but just isnt quite there.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): and sometimes it looks like she‚Äôs trying hard

**hikk** (6): in hindsight i should have expected a rick and morty sample on homesick after seeing that a song title is based off of "keep calm and carry on"

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): I'm sorry but "I was gin and you were toxic" is too funny

**Stryxen** (6): carrion is one of my favourite fiona apple songs

## Me doing this rate

**shipperondeck** (5.9): helter skelter alka seltzer find some shelter ok bars (/s this is corny)

**bulforster** (5.6): hmm

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): the title is my reaction to this song

**majid** (5): the hook is so damn weak

**notsomainpoplietoc** (4.1): such a cool thing at the start come back! Her songs are always so üò©‚ú®immaculate‚ú®üò© The eargasms I get from this is immaculate üò©

**ernie** (4): mid, should‚Äôve worked better as a interlude

**static\_int\_husp** (4): numb is a good description on how I feel during this filler

**Roxieloxie** (3.7): me when its 2012 and i want a poster

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): nothings ever made more sense than when akane told me madison seeked out some of melanie martinez's producers for this album

**MassiveThief** (2): "I was gin and you were toxic" I hate these lyrics so much

**fairytalehigh** (1): okay who the fuck signed off on "i was gin and you were toxic"

**frogaranaman** (1): the random Beatles reference help ???

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): God I just love these kind of songs idk what to tell you they scratch my brain

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): It‚Äôs not the most interesting track here but it does have one of the nicest melodies, the end of the song sounds really good

---

## This song sounds effortless (Madison is just that good, it all comes naturally to her!)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The way her voice is essentially an instrument here, I love it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Madison I hope you‚Äôre feeling better these days. Very beautiful song.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i think it's at this point i realized how out of place this album is in this rate LMAO this song is actually stunning but the subject matter is very despairing compared to ava and zara's stuff so it's gonna get done dirty. which is a shame because madison sounds gorgeous here. probably my fave discovery.

**fadedblue09** (10): This is really stunning. The vocals here remind me of FKA Twigs

**jay duh** (10): my GOD shes just so real and queen and slay for this

**jordannimz** (10): This song is just so beautiful, from her vocal performance to the acoustic guitar to her lyrics. This song feels like floating. Oh, and the last chorus with the vocoder?? Chef's kiss.

**1998tweety** (9.5): I'm floating

**BaconShoes** (9.5): gorgeous song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): dreamy song, her vocals are gorgeous here

**CrimsonROSET** (9): you know sometimes her lyrics really hit

**nicol(y)as(s)** (9): stream how not to drown by chvrches

**shipperondeck** (9): not doing Too Much like some of her others here so I like it

**sunsetspt1** (9): I think this could've performed well as a follow up to Selfish

**babadork** (8.3): I like the little nuances in the vocal performance.

**akanewasright** (8): Sometimes I think Madison gets a bit in over her head with her artistic ambitions and subject matter, but I really like this one. I applaud her for writing about her experiences with medication, and I think she sounds gorgeous on the song

**Bordersz** (8): A very cool song criticizing the pharmaceutical industry and stigma surrounding mental illnesses.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I kinda wish this was more of an r&b track, like Kehlani would crush this.

**vayyiqra** (8): Her vocals are pretty in this. "Madison Beer does ethereal vibes over a trip-hop beat" is a ?! moment but also I'll take it.

**arne** (7.5): bumping up the score by 1 just for the vocoder at the end. god i LOVE vocoders

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): frankly i feel uncomfortable rating this and i've shit on her enough already so i'm just going to give it a 7.5

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): vocoder slay really scratches the brain

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): the way I did this rate

**afs** (7): no effort queen

**ImADudeDuh** (7): yuh

**bulforster** (6.2): yas

**ernie** (6): this is alright but not necessarily my fav song from this song, i would let it play if it came on tho

**static\_int\_husp** (6): this sounds like Kohls brand Ariana

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): pretty

**Vromega** (6): too much post prod for a ballad

## This song sounds effortless (lazy)

**hikk** (5.5): i tuned this song out fairly effortlessly however the vocoder part is cool ig

**2dina3dworld** (5): this song feels very anti anti-depressants and like I get it doesn‚Äôt work for some people but I think it‚Äôs a very dangerous message to impart on an impressionable young audience no matter how well intentioned that medication doesn‚Äôt work to treat mental health, which is not what Madison is going for but it‚Äôs a very easy surface level message to discern and misinterpret. Obviously it‚Äôs more complex than that, and psychiatric medication doesn‚Äôt work for some people but I feel Madison misses the mark, no matter how well intentioned she was in writing this, it swings and misses the point it was trying to make entirely.

**frogaranaman** (5): it is a dead ringer for a other song and I cannot figure out which one

**nlh1013** (5): another that was just decent to me

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): real song

**skargardin** (5): I sleep

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): yeah its effortless alright

**Roxieloxie** (4.5): me when im slaying without effort

**MassiveThief** (3): I think I would like this if it weren't so digital sounding. Like throw this over acoustic instrumentals and leave her voice more natural. As it is, just grating to listen to.

**Awkward\_King** (1): im not commenting actual critiques or reasons i dislike most of these songs bc im being memey but my average is very low so i want to defend some, i hate how breathy her vocals are here the production is so sparse and the whole song just feels like its waiting for a release that never comes

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The way Ava and Zara could‚Äôve had the same name for a song, but Ava decided to name hers ‚ÄúOMG What‚Äôs Happening‚Äù

**frogaranaman** (10): I don't remember this part of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire soundtrack

**jasannn** (10): this was the type of basic dance-pop with good production I was expecting from the rest of the album

**sunsetspt1** (10): Effortless and catchy

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): the instrumental is so pretty

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): yass go murder another papi for a great song again plss!

**lillipup03** (8): Taylor Swift who?

**vayyiqra** (8): this chorus melody kind of rules

**CrimsonROSET** (7): look what you made me do but slay

**SmileAndTears** (7): Ok so ig im learning that my workplace used to play Zara Larson 24/7 cuz i recognize that song too

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): Zara and Ava making the same song, great minds think alike I guess

## Are you really number one though Zara? Let‚Äôs be honest now‚Ä¶

**TiltControls** (6.5): self-reflection? pass

**Awkward\_King** (6): this album is like future nostalgia from the upside down

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Another track that needed a second pass‚Ä¶ like girl what exactly have you become? Details would be appreciated. Edit: looked it up, um, okay, didn‚Äôt expect that!

**hikk** (6): nudisco song

**jordannimz** (6): I like the disco bassline, as well as her vocals in the chorus.

**majid** (6): ‚Äúwe have thank u next at home‚Äù the thank u next at home:

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): a bit basic but basic can be good too

**bulforster** (5.8): hmm

**nlh1013** (5): she kind of sounds bored singing this one

**shipperondeck** (5): you've made a mid song... congrats

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is the most eurovision-y song on the album imo. tbh she probably couldve beat tusse if she competed in melodifestivalen with this

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): They keep ripping off Taylor, they wish they could be her üòî‚úåÔ∏è

**fadedblue09** (4.5): this is supposed to be emotional but this feels hollow

**cremeebrulee** (4.4): is this her response to my poster girl avg

**fairytalehigh** (4.3): there are at least 13 swedish pop songs about this exact same thing that are better

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Why listen to this when you could listen to OMG What‚Äôs Happening instead?

**notsomainpoplietoc** (2.5): "Poster Girl is the pop era we needed to carry on Future Nostalgia‚Äôs legacy!" rlly gotta hand it to an abba knockoff.

**arne** (1): omg the way she predicted her score when she sang "I'm number one"

**Uberpigeon** (1): i have to listen to this every day on my works radio and this is my revenge

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Outsold all of sour tbh

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): This deserved day 3!

---

## Slay Times

**Bordersz** (11): This song is perfection. The sound, her vocals, the vocal chopping on the chorus, the lyrics, the emotions, the vibes, the EVERYTHING. It's EVERYTHING.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): [inhale] IN THESE SOUR TIMESSSSS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Love yourself first queen.

**fadedblue09** (10): Wasn't expecting this banger

**jay duh** (10): i could cry rn just listening to this masterpiece like wowwww... she really gave it her all

**jexan13** (10): Ended Docile Goat

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Portishead‚Äôs IMPACT ‚ù§Ô∏è mark your calendars for the trip-hop rate on Indieheads!

**sunsetspt1** (10): Was planning on turning off the album right before this song started, really glad I didn't because it's easily her best one and one of my favorite songs of 2021. Wish she leaned into this Tame Impala inspiration more instead of filling the album to the brim with ballads

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): is this her best song?? it might be. my third 11 contender from madison. the first time i listened to this song, the chorus hit and i ascended

**Stryxen** (9.5): finally some good fucking food

**BaconShoes** (9): the production kinda slays

**lillipup03** (9): That synth sounds like a liminal space and I don't know how else to describe it

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): us rating Sour in February 2022

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): i actually really dig this

**1998tweety** (8): this is fine

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): yass dubstep

**jordannimz** (7.5): I love the verses and prechorus. The chorus doesn't live up to that standard, but it's still pretty good. It's just that the verses and especially the prechorus are that good.

**Roxieloxie** (7.2): me when im evil paramore

**afs** (7): "I don't know what song of mine you heard" me neither

**Awkward\_King** (7): i do see why people compare her to ariana after hearing this one kjsda

**runaway3212** (7): predicted olivia rodrigo!

**vayyiqra** (7): Keep getting a Lana vibe a lot on an album that doesn't sound like her music at all. Maybe it's a vaguely retro thing in the vocals? Idk. I'm too tired to explain.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): there's an olivia joke to make here but I can't think of it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): wanna like this more because its lyrically good by madison‚Äôs standards but the production just misses for me

**notsomainpoplietoc** (6.1): you cant name it after portishead's ditty that's unjust

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): it's alright

**hikk** (6): that synth is cool

**akanewasright** (5.5): yeah this is kinda just there for me

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): The first few seconds of the chorus are so cool but then she doesn‚Äôt do anything interesting with it.

## Sour indeed

**bulforster** (5.1): hmm

**ernie** (5): forgettable

**frogaranaman** (5): this production style is getting grating

**skargardin** (5): praying BOYSHIT picks this album back up

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): me when i‚Äôm listening to good 4 u by olivia rodrigo

**CrimsonROSET** (4): edm jumpscare

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the sequel series to Hot Ones

**shipperondeck** (2.5): this song doesn't even make sense sonically what the fuck

**MassiveThief** (2): this instrumental is unbearable.

**pig-serpent** (2): The song starts strong and the more I listen to it the less interested I am.

## Hmm I wonder if any other songs from this rate would be there

**TiltControls** (6): Sweet & Sour rate bonus option!?

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (10): A classic

**plastichaxan** (9): Kinda funny that the So Am I prequel got so far

---

## Sweet

**Gusearth** (11): I just have a soft spot for this song because it returned me to the 2010 pop sound during a year of dry music

**TragicKingdom1** (11): the journey i've had with this song...from being deeply annoyed by the hype of having a Pure Pop (tm) song to ironically yassing and slaying to unironically yassing and slaying...all i can say is üêà‚ÄºÔ∏è

**violet** (11): giving this score because ive heard no song so much since that it still has effects years later

**1998tweety** (10): The song that started it all; I still remember when my good friend jamesfog showed me this and started stanning Ava. The good sis was WAY ahead of the curve (but when is he not?). Are there some messy lyrics here? Maybe. But the song bops!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): grab a cock gun!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this album started and ended so great.

**anothertown** (10): a stone cold classic

**Bordersz** (10): Insanely catchy. MAMAMAMAMA

**DirtyRat583** (10): my cat

**fairytalehigh** (10): my straight ass brother loves this fucking song and i love him, also this song is extremely dumb but that alone makes me love it. 10/10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): iconic

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): Ava's songs always include m-ma-ma-ma

**skargardin** (10): it's the classic!

**thegolding** (10): Sweet but Psycho was one of the very few pop hits from 2018, a year that was mostly dominated by rap music (sorry to the rap fans). So remembering this song will always feel sweet and like a slight hope that pop music wasn't dead as it seemed back then.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): dad-core

**Uberpigeon** (10): female manipulator music but the manipulation in question is asking your boyfriend if he thinks a random woman is hot then getting mad no matter how he answers

**celladonn** (9.5): you know it's a smash

**jay duh** (9): i dont need to say anything. The stats speak for themselves

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): when she‚Äôs a 10 but she insists on cutting just one side of her hair ü§™ the problematic fave has arrived!

**SmileAndTears** (9): the way nearly 40% of this album samples an old hit is so fucking funny

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): it took so long for this song to grow on me but it has and it's a bop and suits her as an artist perfectly

**Vromega** (9): This song was absolutely everywhere in european radios. Massive but deserved success

**emayzee** (8.6): brandy melville graphic tees in 2014:

**majid** (8.5): this will receive some undeserved tanking so i've inflated my score for it, it's soooo overhated

**babadork** (8.3): This whole time I thought the lyrics were ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a Top Gun kind of crazy,‚Äù which I interpreted to be more jumping on Oprah‚Äôs couch and maybe joining a cult than participating in human trafficking.

**2dina3dworld** (8): I‚Äôm a twisted fucking cycle path üòî‚úåÔ∏è

**afs** (8): "so left but she's right tho" was a warning for that one Netherlands far right party... do not mess with her.

**BaconShoes** (8): A bop, but not my favorite on the album. She‚Äôs so crazy!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Which half of her haircut represents the sweet and which represents the psycho?

**fadedblue09** (8): kinda weird to end the album with this

**lillipup03** (8): This is good now that I don't have to hear it four times an hour on the radio

**MassiveThief** (8): AI generated "catchy" music, and boy did it work

**Stryxen** (8): i love this song she‚Äôs just saying shit

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): as far as ava singles with overplay go, this is surprisingly the one i‚Äôm more ok with

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): If you were around when this song came out and remember the sub being flooded with posts asking if Ava Max was the one meant to fulfill the ‚ÄúPop Girl Prophecy‚Äù because she was a white blonde woman making pop music, then you‚Äôre entitled to financial compensation.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I can‚Äôt believe she got popular off this track, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs one of her best at all

**ricki** (7.5): you know what, life was much simpler when this played on the radio every 45 minutes

**CrimsonROSET** (7): todd pointing out just how many songs by actual pop girlies tried to do this and here comes this nobody and gets it right first try is funnier than it should be

**DaHumanTorch** (7): not ava being goofy i- üò≠üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**hikk** (7): i liked this a lot when it was becoming a hit but i haven't sought it out on my own since then... it's still fine but she really outdid herself with most of the rest of this album

**pig-serpent** (7): I would more describe this song as perfectly serviceable and not at all weird but to each their own.

**nlh1013** (6.5): even though this gets stuck in my head a lot it does not mean I really really like it lol

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): basic as fuck but it gains a point for destroying a dutch far-right party

**jordannimz** (6): I mean, it definitely was overplayed. But it was honestly a good breakout single for Ava and I like it overall.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Slighty better now that it's not radio filler

Thedoctordances1940: ## Psycho

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): anti maverick energy unlocked. im offended by her usage of latex and rubber

**rotating3Dtext** (5): she‚Äôs so craaazy I love her

**shipperondeck** (5): honestly i wish i had her ridiculous unabashed confidence

**bulforster** (4.7): hmm

**akanewasright** (4): I think we need to acknowledge how awful the lines ‚Äúso left but she‚Äôs right through‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs poison but tasty‚Äù are. Those + the attempt at framing this as a feminist, girl power song made me realize how incompetently written the lyrics are. It‚Äôs catchy but not that fun

**TheQueenOfVultures** (4): mymymymymymymy

**TiltControls** (4): It's so generic it actually becomes boring

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): Just making sure I don‚Äôt fit in

**Awkward\_King** (2): this was the blueprint (derogatory)

**RandomHypnotica** (2): "so left but's she's right tho" is genuinely one of the worst lyrics I've ever heard

**frogaranaman** (1): Glee would cover this

**Roxieloxie** (1): me when im evil

**sage** (1): terrorism

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): she‚Äôs so crazyyyyyyyy! love her!!!

**nicol(y)as(s)** (0): literally the most pop pop song ever made

**oscarbrierley1** (0): no just no. The dubstep breakdown is so retro. Hate the lyrics. She should leave the whistle notes to people who sound good doing them.

**starla\_** (0): I absolutely hate this song. It sounds like a rip off of Poker Face but irritating as hell. The verses have nothing happening and then the chorus is annoyingly catchy yet incredibly boring.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): yes this song is bad because it glorifies mental illness and abusive relationships but have we also considered that it is also incredibly annoying.

**vayyiqra** (0): When I joined Popheads I feel like I kept seeing this song being shilled, and then the hype about the Pop Prophecy (remember that damn thing?) and seeing this thumbnail of the video with its edgy "padded cell but red" image and being repulsed by that. Then the lyrics became memed to hell and back, and it took me years to ever willingly listen to it. It has not grown on me one bit and I still think this is one of the worst pop songs to ever become a hit. That isn't even getting into the bordering-on-offensive way that Ava uses lyrics about severe mental illness to portray herself as a Very Quirky Girl. I can't fucking stand this song. It's a kind of Pavlovian conditioning.I need to stop here before I rant more. This song is on too many levels of awful. It's catchy, but that's actively a bad thing, because it sucks.

**TiltControls** (10): Nothing else on the album compares to this. Almost got my 11 too

**fairytalehigh** (9.9): what i'm looking for my tall slender tatted up coworker to do. alan HMU

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): oh wait since when was this a bop

**1998tweety** (9): and my hole

**jay duh** (9): yassss

**nicol(y)as(s)** (9): yass

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): honestly this song deserved more

**afs** (8): heh I like the connection between this and the previous track that's about it

**akanewasright** (8): this chorus is lazily written but it also has vocoder so ig it‚Äôs actually excellent

**ignitethephoenix** (8): for some reason I didn‚Äôt realize this song would be on the album üíÄ

**ricki** (8): 15 year old me that was fully crushing on a guy i met on skype that used to do cocaine would have cried to this song

**welcome2thejam** (8): Now that I can do!

**AHSWeeknd** (7): good for her

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): you ruined her career, you don't deserve being a single.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): A cute little song!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Hearing the orchestral version of this ruined the original for me, the lush production is just so much more interesting than this generic pop sound. I hope she does more stuff with that sound in the future because I think it could be the edge she needs to take her music to the next level.

**jasannn** (7): me to the guy I talked to on Bumble for two weeks (actually we‚Äôre started talking again so‚Ä¶)

**jexan13** (7): why do you ruin those verses and prechorus worthy of a 10 with that chorussssssssss

**skargardin** (7): The amount of overexposure this got on the radio has slightly soured it for me, but it bops still

**Roxieloxie** (6.9): me when im evil

**bulforster** (6.6): yas

**starla\_** (6.5): this song has so much potential...needs a remix

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this shrinks with every listen tbh. stands out as being repetitive even in this rate

## Would take Zara bowling just to ruin her life in return

**CrimsonROSET** (6): girls on tumblr about any character in 2017:

**oscarbrierley1** (6): spotify users have a lot to answer for. This has five times the streams of all the time and don't worry about me. I dont understand why this song is kinda meh.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): well this song flopping felt like the start of her fall back into irrelevance so maybe he did ruin her life, just in a different way than she meant

**fadedblue09** (5): Wait she put this on her album??? This is like centuries old

**frogaranaman** (5): mood but also meh

**hikk** (5): zara was at her lowest... fat nasty and broke. career in shambles. she couldn't come on this bitch mad as hell because she needed to make the most inoffensive song possible to get those spotify streams so instead she made ruin my life

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): I will forget what this sounds like the second it's over

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): she really had this much faith in this song that she included it on an album released 2 and a half years later üòµ‚Äçüí´

**vayyiqra** (5): edgy title okay song

**flavasavavandal** (4.5): remember kiddos, when you don‚Äôt have a good hook, just repeat phrases into the microphone until it‚Äôs drilled in their heads

**2dina3dworld** (4): don‚Äôt let anyone dull your sparkle, queen

**majid** (4): how the hell does this have 500 million streams

**shipperondeck** (4): girl no this is so boring

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): i do not like this at all, it sounds super generic and the chorus is super weak

**Awkward\_King** (2): ?????

**indie\_fan\_** (1.5): All those spotify ads that had this playing in the background made this track from mildly annoying to nearly intolerable.

**Uberpigeon** (1): this album is ruining my life

## Survived the jump rope challenge in Super Mario Odyssey

**arne** (11): this makes no sense at all and I'm here for it

**Roxieloxie** (11): thee icon

**shipperondeck** (11): as a Gamer i must approve but i need to know who mario and luigi like the most out of these three

**TiltControls** (11): gamers rights yass

**welcome2thejam** (11): Which girl will win by doing absolutely nothing?

**Awkward\_King** (10): pizza pasta

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): fitting, because the new super mario bros games are just bland alternatives to the superior 3D games

**majid** (10): this is so camp omfg

**RandomHypnotica** (10): gamer rights

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): but we need the audience to vote for the video game instrumentals mini rate (hoping that by the time this rate reveal happens it already gets voted in)

**AHSWeeknd** (9): I‚Äôd love to learn about the etymology of this title

**vayyiqra** (9): Gets points for making me laugh although it's not a very good nor indicative name in of itself.

**1998tweety** (8): campy

**anothertown** (8): a good alt for the acronym. It's also true. Ava is very much like toadette (like, if Toad and Toadette were from anywhere in the US, they're from the Midwest) and zara has a rosalina quality about her. Madison can be cat peach or something

**ricki** (8): funny

**runaway3212** (8): she‚Äôs playfull, she‚Äôs original but she does not get the point across that well

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Peach/Daisy/Pauline rate when?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ7_gsuVdp0

**fairytalehigh** (7): birdo main pop girl

## Play Mario Kart 8 with Smart Steering on

**seanderlust** (6.5): i was going to make a daisy and peach joke but then i remembered it was new super mario girls and i was like "who's new in the mario universe" and all i could think of was sora joining smash so...give sora your 11s

**pig-serpent** (6): Funny name but not descriptive

**Stryxen** (6): Da11sy

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): it's kinda funny but only if you know the original name

**notsomainpoplietoc** (4.2): lol

**afs** (4): wario outsold I fear

**aldwin\_is\_here** (4): I'd rather shove a pipe down my throat.

**flavasavavandal** (2): Never cared for Mario tbh

**SLAYdedblue09** (0): suck it Nintendo nerds

## huh

**Jexan13** (6): I don't get. Is it because Madison and Ava are compared to Italian WoCs? Or because Zara Larsson is slightly reminiscent of Waluigi?

**thegolding** (4): i don't get this one

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): I‚Äôm glad I gave it a 10 this just kept growing on me

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): I can‚Äôt say this is one of my favourite songs on the album, it‚Äôs decent but I‚Äôm not a big fan of the little post-chorus and some of the melodies feel a bit clunky but it still did well and I can‚Äôt begrudge it too much for that

---

**sunsetspt1** (11): Ian Kirkpatrick and Julia Michaels' genius on display, if it were a Dua song instead I'm positive it would be a massive hit

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): as a queer man, this is a painful song because it reminds me of a time where I fell in love with a straight friend but can't confess because of backlash and ruining his relationship with me.

**BaconShoes** (10): such a bop omfg

**ernie** (10): FALLLLINGGGGG FORRRRRR A FRIEEEEENDDDDDD

**fadedblue09** (10): Sounds really unique, and the lyrics are memorable

**fairytalehigh** (10): she gets a pass for "if it are it be iconic" because this fucking goes that FFFucking hard

**frogaranaman** (10): I hope she got laid for this

**jay duh** (10): GAGGGGGGGGGGGUH bit of an ass shaker

**Stryxen** (10): GGG (gagged, gooped and gagged)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song is sapphic coded i dont make the rules

**nlh1013** (9.5): I love this one, the music is so funky and fun

**1998tweety** (9): It's giving Kylie Minogue

**AHSWeeknd** (9): This comes off as delusion.

**celladonn** (9): Love the melody of the prechorus and drop!

**jexan13** (9): finally, some good music on the album

**lillipup03** (9): "Is there a spark for us or is it just purely platonic" is the best line on the album‚Ä¶ I just need to stop relating to it ü´†

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): every time the bassist is grooving this album is good

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a bop, and I forgot what the title meant and thought it was "fuck fake friends" lmao but that is a very different, much worse song by Bebe Rexha. Right, this is the -good- FFF.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Fun beat, love her voice on the pre-chorus and how it flows

**Bordersz** (8.5): Very breezy. Pop perfection.

**starla\_** (8.1): finally some good fucking food

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): After looking at my frequented tags on AO3, I have decided to give this a good score.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): F.R.F. (Fuck Real Friends)

**jasannn** (8): she‚Äôs kinda quirky

**shipperondeck** (8): a bit of zara's zany spunk has returned ! yay.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): is this a known acronym??? I have never heard it outside of this song

**afs** (7.5): I was about to have a fit because I thought she copied bebe rexha's fuck fake friends

**2dina3dworld** (7): nu disco queen

**akanewasright** (7): this song sucks a bit, but I like my mental image of it, which involves cartoon skeletons dancing

**Awkward\_King** (7): can i get an f in the chat for all the other girlies

**bulforster** (7): yass

**CrimsonROSET** (7): fuck farry fill

**jordannimz** (7): I love how the verses are written, and this song is pretty catchy. The post-chorus reminds me a bit of Tom's Diner but not as good, though.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): love the music but lyrics are a bit clunky in parts

**oscarbrierley1** (7): its catchy but I can't ignore the terrible grammar of the lyrics. "If it are" like really you have a writing team and you couldn't find something better to go there.

**ricki** (7): electro-chicken drop

**skargardin** (7): the drop is so goofy

**MToms** (6.5): if it are it be iconic is the worst line I have ever heard

**pig-serpent** (6.5): In reverse Zara fashion, the instrumental and verses are pretty good but that hook is abysmal.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): 'if it are'???? 'it would be iconic'????? what are those lyrics i-

**hikk** (6): ik bebe rexha is mad as hell that zara not only took her song title but also that she was too floppy to make it into the flop rate

**arne** (5.5): the guitar bit after the chorus saved this song

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): damn Zara sung about falling in love with this friend with the same passion as Lush Life

**anothertown** (5): justin tranter and julia michaels are not seeing heaven

**MassiveThief** (5): "Is this a story arc? Cause it it are, it'd be iconic" girl WHAT

**runaway3212** (4): for fucks fuck

**TragicKingdom1** (4): limpest pop drop of the rate which is unfortunate because the rest of the song isnt bad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I do kinda like the little instrumental break part but otherwise this was just one ear and out the other. Really weak chorus.

**TiltControls** (3): She almost sounds bored here. Is that while it's titled like that? Did she fall asleep on the F key on her keyboard?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2.5): this really doesn't do anything for me except the vocals in the chorus

**Uberpigeon** (2): F

**indie\_fan\_** (1.7): #FFF is a color code for white, which is the opposite of me, which is probably why I don‚Äôt like this song.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): This song was on a pretty good run towards the end and almost looked like it was gonna still make day 3 despite not having the greatest of starts but I think this is about fair for this, and tbf anything that makes use of the same homophone as eminem‚Äôs horrible window pain/pane dad joke doesn‚Äôt really deserve day 3 just by association

## Slayed Glass

**jay duh** (11): **TODAYS YOUTH** A-B-C-D-E, F-U /And your mom and your sister and your job / And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art **breathtaking, jaw dropping, different and unique in many aspects** My skin is made of glass / But apparently it's stained / 'Cause you notice all the cracks / But can't look inside my pain **okay?, unenjoyable, "who is madison beer?"** do you see the problem?

**1998tweety** (10): this song fucks me UP

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is where the heart wrenching depression starts on the album, I love it.

**ernie** (10): this song is just‚Ä¶. FUCK!

**sunsetspt1** (10): More of this sound please!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): such a gorgeous song and i love the metaphor

**thegolding** (10): The pain is audible on her voice. She sounds like she cried for hours. This is called interpretation and she definitely knows it.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): this should've went out with a bang instead of the laid back last chorus

**anothertown** (9): i was born with glass bones and paper skin- [gunshots]

**starla\_** (9): love the production on this, it reminds me of Halsey's If I Can't Have Love...album

**welcome2thejam** (9): Damn, this was influenced by Radiohead? Guess she does have her own take on male manipulator music

**Bordersz** (8.7): Her runs are like silk.

**BaconShoes** (8.5): I JUST MIGHT BREAKK

**jexan13** (8.5): Jesus been awfully quiet since this dropped

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I feel like I've heard this chord progression a billion times before but i like it nonetheless

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is quite pretty but not the strongest melody on the album.

**skargardin** (8): oh this is nice

**akanewasright** (7.7): She sounds gorgeous here, and while I think the melody meanders a bit, bits and pieces of it are really memorable

**afs** (7.5): I just realised how many of her songs I heard on my radio

**jordannimz** (7.5): I always forget how much I like this song until I listen to the album again. Idk what else to say.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): queen of stained glass, of blender, of tempered chocolate, queen of skillshare

**hikk** (7): me decorating my house in minecraft

**vayyiqra** (7): loving this Catholic representation, as a man of God myself (note I have no clue what Madison's religious beliefs are I just like joking about being Catholic). also cool beat

## Noticed all the cracks

**Roxieloxie** (6.8): me when im the cathlic church

**bulforster** (6.5): yas

**fadedblue09** (6.5): A nice vulnerable moment but some of her vocalizations are out of place

**pig-serpent** (5): I am amazed at how many Madison Beer songs are ruined by the drumming. She makes cool soundscapes and then the generic rock/trap drum beats kill the mood.

**shipperondeck** (5): genuinely i don't know how to feel about her usage of drums in this song and in general. but this score is actually low because i cannot stand that key change thing she keeps doing

**fairytalehigh** (4.3): "my life's just a faded memory of what i can't have" girl aren't you like 20?

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): stretches an already thin metaphor even thinner

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): this chorus sounds like dialogue from a bad YA novel

**frogaranaman** (1): oh my god here we go again

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): i hate robots

**Stryxen** (1): music for an attempt at an artsy psychological horror superhero film trailer which still wants to be a box office hit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i really did not like how her voice sounded on this one at all

## At least Madison did it subtly

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): she's kinda mother for that pain/pane line

**TheQueenOfVultures** (3): guess thats why they call it window pain

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): I feel like I should like this a lot more but there‚Äôs something about it that makes it seem a little bit childish, almost like it was written for some kids show, but I‚Äôm not sure why.

**plastichaxan** (8): The host urge to play a song you love but not wanting people to trash it or get bored

---

## Care how Zara cares

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Where was this 80s influenced pop on the rest of the album??

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): you should've been a single, wtf is she thinking for not making this a summer hit!

**Awkward\_King** (10): :oprahpoggers: :oprahpoggers: :oprahpoggers:

**jay duh** (10): wait omg... gaggggggg

**lillipup03** (10): Zara truly is the queen of summer songs in my heart

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): she wanted to recreate blinding lights so bad with this one‚Ä¶and she kinda slayed while doing so

**runaway3212** (9): idc this bops

**welcome2thejam** (9): Hot damn, where has this been? Easily the best sounding Zara song so far and it's not even on the record proper? Tragic

**shipperondeck** (8.9): this is a good song but the decently executed 80s vibe automatically gives this an even nicer score in my book

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): i'm such a slut for synthwave

**afs** (8.5): should've paid homage to Aly and AJ with "stupid summer"

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): why does this bop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): was the last summer in sweden in the 80s or

**seanderlust** (8.5): blinding lights lite but it does slap a bit

**starla\_** (8.2): I love the 80s gated reverb on this

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Feels like it was created to soundtrack the credits of a Netflix coming of age film (complimentary)

**MassiveThief** (8): yeah she ate on these bonus songs. whoever made the decision to not have them on the album needs to reevaluate. even tho this one is just trying to be Blinding Lights.

**skargardin** (8): bop

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): slay

**vayyiqra** (8): Yes I am being the stereotypical basic 2018-era Pophead who eats up any synthpop song by a blonde woman right right now and I'm okay with that.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): she snapped here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This kind of feels like it‚Äôs ripping off three different songs but it bops so who cares.

**jasannn** (7.5): its too hard to hate a lowkey version of take on me.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): why is one of the most listenable songs from the album a deluxe track?

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7.5): hey there summer boy, im putting on my heels

**TiltControls** (7.5): I don't love all of the vocals here, which is a shame cause I actually like the song itself

**emayzee** (7.2): this is fine but maybe we should consider closing the portal that blinding lights opened bc we're getting too many knockoffs at this point

**bulforster** (7.1): yass

**akanewasright** (7): this is kind of just another Blinding Lights synth song, but it‚Äôs a decent change of pace, and the chorus is nice at least

**BaconShoes** (7): catchy lil ditty

**CrimsonROSET** (7): me when someone asks me what i did last summer and i have to hide my hook hand

**pig-serpent** (7): Man, Physical really has just ruined synthwave for me. The amount of synthwave songs I call ‚Äúa strictly worse physical‚Äù as if that song invented the genre is crazy.

**nlh1013** (6.5): I like the eighties sound to this one

## Don‚Äôt want to think about it

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): I can't tell if it sounds like another song or if it's just generic. Also enough of the blinding lights drum machine

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): this song has potential to go somewhere but it never really takes off like it should

**indie\_fan\_** (5.4): Feel like I've heard this kinda song 500 other times by now

**flavasavavandal** (5): Zara please don‚Äôt do Blinding Lights-core again

**frogaranaman** (5): this is gonna get compared to "Blinding Lights"

**hikk** (5): i like blinding lights knockoffs generally but listening to this rn i really get the ppl that are tired of them and think they all sound the same and are played out

**nicol(y)as(s)** (5): mid af

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): "Please Zara, **listen to your fans!** Explore more this type of sound, a modern 80's electropop, cause it fits very well on your voice and you slayed on this track!! Please release this one as a single!"

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): it's not bad song but it feels empty?? like idk there's something missing but the bones of a great song is there

**jordannimz** (4.5): The instrumental is kinda basic, which is not always the end of the world, but so are the melody and lyrics. It's fine enough, but like, meh.

**Roxieloxie** (4): me when i dont know what i did

**fadedblue09** (3): i'm really tired of this sound. Can we get please get rid of synthwave

**sage** (2.7): crickets

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Ugh, I‚Äôm so disappointed this didn‚Äôt make day 3, it was there for a while but dropped out towards the end, but like this is genuinely so good. Easily one of the best sounding songs in the rate

**plastichaxan** (8): Hmm are you sure bestie

---

## Should I be???

**akanewasright** (10): I just think that Tove Lo should write for all the pop girls

**BaconShoes** (10): whenever Tove Lo is involved, it slays

**ernie** (10): YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT YOUUUU, this is her best song fight me

**hikk** (10): WE LOVE YOU TOVE LO THANK YOU FOR DONATING BLUE LIPS SCRAPS EVEN IF SHE PAID IT DUST BY NOT INCLUDING IT ON THE ALBUM

**jay duh** (10): YASSSSS YAS YAS YAS YAS

**oscarbrierley1** (10): I thought this would be my eleven, but when I tried to write a comment for it I couldn't thing of anything to say. Its just a bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): why do all these bonus tracks sound so much better than anything on the actual album üò≠

**shipperondeck** (9.6): yoooo ???? see zara this is something i would playlist !

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): a great banger to send to my ex-gf after I came out to her.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): whoa. this is much better than anything on the album why did she take this off

**jordannimz** (9): Such a bop ‚Äî with such great production and vocals, this would've worked really well on the album.

**skargardin** (9): BOP

**afs** (8.5): zara reacts to rate results

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**fadedblue09** (8): Sounds really familiar

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Why does this sound like Tinashe song at parts

**ricki** (8): *passionate from miles away*

**vayyiqra** (8): "I've been sleeping okay" god I wish that were me

**notsomainpoplietoc** (7.9): "This song on a late night drive on an some what close to empty road, windows down, nice cool breeze, and the bass bumping with the vocals a little higher than usual, makes this the best damn song to think to and just enjoy the moment you are in. Can‚Äôt express enough how many deep thoughts I‚Äôve had with this song." why tf was this regulated to b-side land?

**2dina3dworld** (7): the most interesting thing about this is whatever that saxophone is doing

**AHSWeeknd** (7): whoever directed that video clearly hates Sweden

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This also feels like Ulta Beauty playlist material but like the higher quality stuff towards the top.

## I don‚Äôt really care enough about you to do that Zara

**bulforster** (6.9): yas

**nicol(y)as(s)** (6.8): mid af

**TiltControls** (6.5): ok

**fairytalehigh** (6.1): ehhhhh can't relate

**pig-serpent** (6): I wish the song wasn‚Äôt boring, but that synth sound is actually really cool and deserves to be used in a better song.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): this is a bit of a bop. easily could've replaced one of the weaker songs on the official album

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): the buzzing part naur

**Roxieloxie** (5.7): me when im listening to swedish house mafia

**apatel27** (5): Soulless beat

**frogaranaman** (5): this is okay

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Zara after seeing that Madison Beer is in the rate:

**Stryxen** (5): k i won‚Äôt

**Awkward\_King** (2): this lo-fi lo-effort trop pop

**flavasavavandal** (2): so glad Zara got over her thirst but could she go back to making good songs

**Uberpigeon** (2): i have to listen to this every day on my works radio and this is my revenge

## ü§ê

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh I won't, I'm confident you've got this rate in the bag zara
