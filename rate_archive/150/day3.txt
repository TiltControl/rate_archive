Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): I remember someone said Carly wrote from a gay man perspective and I think she may not be the only pop girlie to do so

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): First elimination of day 3 and I think this feels about right for this song, and it has been hovering around this spot for most of the rate. It‚Äôs a good song but the most notable thing about it being the gemini line is not what you‚Äôd really want

---

## Pisces

**1998tweety** (10): ascending

**AHSWeeknd** (10): listening to this as a Gemini always catches me off guard

**ernie** (10): this song is just so heavenly, if someone else sang this it wouldn‚Äôt be that good imo but this song just works for madison idk why

**jasannn** (10): of course, my favorite song off the album wouldn‚Äôt sound out of place on SOUR (compliment)

**jay duh** (10): i agree fuck geminis

**jordannimz** (10): This song has some of the prettiest harmonies on the album, and that's saying something. Another perfectly-executed ballad. And the vocal run in the last chorus?????????

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): slay

**BaconShoes** (9.5): gorgeous, stunning

**celladonn** (9.5): This has such a lovely sound

**emayzee** (9.5): the vocals and cinematic production of this song god i love this and wish the album was more in this vein

**starla\_** (9.5): my favourite song on the album

**akanewasright** (9): some of these lyrics are kinda bad, but this is one of the best ballads on the album, so I‚Äôll let it slide

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): such a gorgeous song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): yeah this is really pretty

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): She knew he was selfish when he walked in.

**violet** (8.5): probably the best song on the album tbh!

**notsomainpoplietoc** (8.1): she's so talented here tho

**jexan13** (8): This track position is unfortunate

**nicol(y)as(s)** (8): shes a lyricist... shes a songwriter...

**nlh1013** (8): THIS IS ABOUT MY EX

**pig-serpent** (8): Suffers a bit from being right after the too-similar Homesick, but this is clearly the superior song.

**TiltControls** (8): Finally an emotional song that someone manages to put emotion into

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): love the Chorus, but the production is a bit boring.

**indie\_fan\_** (7.4): It was all fine until that gemini line made me cringe

**seanderlust** (7.1): can us Geminis be allowed to lie in peace without being called out for it by Madison fucking Beer?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i dont eat i dont eat shellfish

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): now why are geminis in it

**MassiveThief** (7): the beginning was annoying and I feel like she reuses the same chord progressions over and over, but the climax was pretty nice.

**skargardin** (7): cute moment

## Geminis

**afs** (6.5): balladophobia

**anothertown** (6.5): i dont like all the rolling crescendos

**fadedblue09** (6.5): "Why are you such a Gemini" I had no idea this zodiac craze was this bad wow

**fairytalehigh** (6.5): as a gemini i took offense to this but as a gemini i also gave her the benefit of the doubt, even if it's a total billie rip

**sunsetspt1** (6.5): The gemini line always takes me out of it, every time

**2dina3dworld** (6): ‚Äúbaby why are you such a Gemini‚Äù. We‚Äôll come here and call me out to my face then, Madison.

**bulforster** (5.5): hmm

**ImADudeDuh** (5): half of this album is just Madison lamenting a relationship where she either blames the guy or herself by speak singing quietly over a guitar from a laptop

**Roxieloxie** (5): me when i tank libid0 in kpop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): as a gemini myself i take offense at the gemini line

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): madison beer

**apatel27** (4): This is a bad Olivia Rodrigo song

**shipperondeck** (4): zzzzzzz god are we serious

**vayyiqra** (4): Two acoustic songs in a row is a lot for Popheads to handle. Tried to be fair, but this is weird pacing. Nvm I don't like this.

**Stryxen** (3): i was so bored

**hikk** (2): waits for her to slay again

**frogaranaman** (1): this stretch of ballads is REALLY rough

Thedoctordances1940: ## Oh and Halsey is here too

**TiltControls** (8.5): watchout halsey, we've got a new colour queen

**hikk** (7.5): his pills his hands his jeans

**CrimsonROSET** (7): halsey outsold kinda

**ImADudeDuh** (6): But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky

## The people that didn‚Äôt mention Lana or Halsey ig

**anothertown** (10): we were like a gorgeous bed of roses, ready to die any minute! üó£Ô∏è

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When the mascara drips you give him the slip.

**frogaranaman** (10): this is one of the best pop ballads I have ever heard in my life

**jexan13** (10): When this songs plays I just imagine myself on a sexy dress, with stockings and high heels, crying

**mayaSS üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üòúüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë©** (10): she took an ever-so-quick dip in mother lake here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): still obsessed with this, such a beautiful song. another 11 contender for me.

**thegolding** (10): This song is just amazing. I think her lyricism was on its peak here. I love the metaphors related to make up and colors and you can listen to her vulnerability better than in other songs.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Gets a bit repetitive towards the end but the central phrase is so good that it doesn‚Äôt matter.

**afs** (8): marina outsold

**pig-serpent** (8): This song highlights what I think the difference between a good and bad Madison Beer song is. This isn't an atypical song for her, but the textures of the instruments and effects on her voice come together in the chorus to sound more spectacular than it would look on paper. Most of the rest of this album lacks either the sound design or cohesion of this song.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): she sang with my favorite color!

**BaconShoes** (7): is it time to run now

**skargardin** (7): cmon vocals!

**Roxieloxie** (6.3): me when im looking for clues

**fadedblue09** (6): A bit too dramatic

**nicol(y)as(s)** (6): she had a vocoder and a dream.. Queen

**akanewasright** (5.5): I really like this song up to the chorus. That just grinds the song to a screeching halt for me.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): some pretty production but it's nothing special

**emayzee** (5.5): i liked the 15 seconds of drumming at the end but as far as everything else......

**starla\_** (5.2): this is nice but the midtempo ballad schtick is getting a bit old at this point in the album

**babadork** (4): She should have taken some more tips from Shangela, because your makeup should not be doing that

**static\_int\_husp** (5): this is not giving Joni Mitchell but I almost wish she would

**bulforster** (4.9): hmm

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): need a version of this song without the terrible sounding bass in the beginning of the chorus

**ernie** (2): something about this song just makes me annoyed as hell‚Ä¶.. for those that love this i‚Äôm not sorry but y‚Äôall have mid taste /j

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): i just feel mean because this album is clearly not for me like i hate almost every song so far but i just feel like im being mean ejsdjk

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): Ethical Lana del Rey music? Sign me up

**thedoctordances1940** (9.3): Yeah this song is blatant Lana worship, in fact a couple of months after this album had come out and the song wasn‚Äôt that fresh in my mind anymore it came on and I genuinely thought I was listening to Lana but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily a bad thing. Her vocals in the pre-chorus sound so much like Lana, the imagery she paints with the lyrics are the exact things Lana would sing about, California sunsets, silent movies, fated death, colourful imagery etc‚Ä¶ these are the exact kind of nostalgic fantasies Lana is always singing about, but it really is a brilliant song and at the end of the day this comes without the baggage of it being Lana which I can only view as a positive.

---

## Dear Society is just another way to say Question for the culture

**notsomainpoplietoc** (11): dipshit 11 rewarded to the petty lana del rey ripoff/automidtune/trappop monster. poor little thing wants to soundtrack anything.

**1998tweety** (10): Literally a Lana song

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She said ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs for the Born To Die stans‚Äù

**jay duh** (10): yupp took lanas crown clean off her head and wore it gorgeously! Minus the republican antics teehee

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): youtube comments stop calling any song that has a remotely old fashioned vibe to it lana del rey-esque (impossible)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I Can‚Äôt Believe It‚Äôs Not Lana Del Rey

**welcome2thejam** (9): I'm not even gonna say her name y'all already know what this sounds like

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): Well hello miss Madison Del Rey

**jordannimz** (8.5): The verses and prechorus are so Born To Die-era Lana, but the chorus feels very cohesive with the rest of the album. Like usual, this song is gorgeous, but the bridge is bit forgettable compared to the rest of the song. The outro more than makes up for that though, with its beautiful cinematic strings.

**Bordersz** (8): It is like Lana Del Rey gifted her this song. I always mix up singing Summertime Sadness with this.

**vayyiqra** (8): This feels like a LARP as early Lana Del Rey but with more synth and vocoder and I'm into it.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): blue jeans...white shirt...walked into the room you-

**MToms** (7.5): Very Lana (+Halsey+Taylor with the color references). This sounds good but gets quite repetitive.

**shipperondeck** (7.2): im sure there will be very few lana comparisons made here

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): the Born to Die era lana inspiration is HEAVY here

**nlh1013** (7): this one gave me big Lana vibes. I really like her voice in this one

**oscarbrierley1** (7): lyrics like AI wrote a lana del rey song. The production kinda goes hard though. Vocoder slay

**ricki** (6.5): this sounds like an EDM remix of a Lust For Life song

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): lana voice

**seanderlust** (6): this is an underrated lana del rey ultraviolence album cut EDIT: nevermind just got to the farting synths

**Uberpigeon** (6): this is literally a lana song

**cremeebrulee** (5.6): what in the lana del rey cosplay

**majid** (5): this is such an obvious lana copy it actually made me cringe a bit lol

**arne** (4): this is giving lana del rey

**indie\_fan\_** (4): This gives me Lana Del Rey vibes, which is why I‚Äôm giving it a negative score

**fairytalehigh** (2): lana called, she wants her everything back

**MassiveThief** (1): Just bad all around. There's a constant grating WUB WUB WUB WUB in the background, the lyrics are high school english level (a pretty constant theme on this album), and the chorus is super repetitive. Sounds to me like she's trying to copy Billie Eilish and/or Lana on a lot of the vocal inflections too.

**emayzee** (5.5): i liked the 15 seconds of drumming at the end but as far as everything else......

**starla\_** (5.2): this is nice but the midtempo ballad schtick is getting a bit old at this point in the album

**babadork** (4): She should have taken some more tips from Shangela, because your makeup should not be doing that

**static\_int\_husp** (5): this is not giving Joni Mitchell but I almost wish she would

**bulforster** (4.9): hmm

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): need a version of this song without the terrible sounding bass in the beginning of the chorus

**ernie** (2): something about this song just makes me annoyed as hell‚Ä¶.. for those that love this i‚Äôm not sorry but y‚Äôall have mid taste /j

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): i just feel mean because this album is clearly not for me like i hate almost every song so far but i just feel like im being mean ejsdjk

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): This convinced me to give Ava a true chance and keep listening to her music

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): Just a massive bop, so glad this pulled through in the end and made it into day 3

---

## Kings and Queens and In-Betweens

**flavasavavandal** (11): She really out-radioed with this

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I can imagine Nicole Kidman enjoying this

**babadork** (10): Is it a coincidence that my favorite song off this album is the one that I‚Äôm most convinced I can hear a European accent on?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): why did I hear ‚Äúyou get a royalty high‚Äô and thought Ava Max was referring to music royalties cuz she keeps interpolating songs lmaoooo

**ernie** (10): the second best single from this album, the way she starts off the song with those VOCALSSS üò©üò©üò©

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I LIKE THIS SONG SUE ME

**jay duh** (10): yepppp first time i ever heard of ava max was cause this song actually! Kat, CalvinHarris_fan and myself we're playing roblox in quarantine 2020, it was a dress up game and calvin had the opportunity to select the category and he chose Kings & Queens so i googled and my jaw dropped at how absolutely gag this song is and how short ava max is but we move she is god

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): very girlboss feminism and honestly kind of embarrassing to enjoy this but it's just such a huge bop I cannot deny it

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): "I am a Christian but this song speaks level to me. As a mother and a wife who is fighting alone to keep the family together in every aspect. Literally emotionally and financially but not physically anymore as I'm now miles and miles away from them. Ever since my pregnancy I am the only one working my ass out to provide everything, just to give my daughter a happy life eventhough I'm drained. I pray that I will have the strength to continue fight my way as my king is just sitting in his throne." this song is undeniably so bad it becomes perfect. Ava's fans were right

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): queen of making dick jokes that automatically pull you out of the song

**throwaway-7650** (10): "queens & kings" as the title would fit the lyrics better tbh

**BaconShoes** (9.5): if i had one, it‚Äôd be bigger than yours!!

**emayzee** (9.4): the instrumental break after the second chorus that sounds identical to the victorious transition scene music......YUP

**1998tweety** (9): The guitar on this sounds so damn good, but besides that it's a bit clunky (the sword line in particular).

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): I wish you became a top ten on the Billboard.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): It bops but trying to girlboss-ify the concept of monarchy‚Ä¶.eh‚Ä¶.

**fadedblue09** (9): Slay sample choice, kinda ruined by the drops though

**hikk** (9): HER PEN

**ImADudeDuh** (9): queen of feminism

**jasannn** (9): The main pop girlies wish they could have a guitar solo this great,

**jordannimz** (9): Another great use of an interpolation on a perfectly-produced song; the guitar solo is great and it's so danceable. I just can't deal with the bridge... say what what you want but I think the chess metaphor is cringy.

**runaway3212** (9): the chess metaphor she is a writer omfg

**SmileAndTears** (9): Unironically better than both the Bonnie Tyler song and You Give Love a Bad Name, naur its true

**static\_int\_husp** (9): is this good? No. But it is a bop so we have to stan, your honor.

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): outsold chess? (serious)

**anothertown** (8.5): sometimes word salad is good

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): this is weird because it does not serve cunt like an ava single should but its still good i guess

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): honestly it's a whole bop

**afs** (8): not her swordshaming

**Awkward\_King** (8): https://im.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-1-5ab6257519.gif

**CrimsonROSET** (8): her janelle monae moment

**MToms** (8): excellent sample choice

**pig-serpent** (8): People may make fun of Ava Max for being behind the times, but guitar solos existing is something the previous times got right and our time got wrong.

**RoyalBloodFool** (8): it'd be bigger than yours

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): it‚Äôs surface-level feminism that‚Äôs the sonic equivalent of making Danaerys your entire personality in the Game of Throne era, and the interpolation carries hard, but I‚Äôm bopping

**skargardin** (8): Overplayed bop

**Vromega** (8): At one point this song was my fave among the singles. I think I kinda got bored of it and I'm not enjoying it anymore :pensive: The nstrumentation is quite repetitive. Still giving it a good score for the time I loved it

**starla\_** (7.9): this song grew on me somewhat. Not her best but pretty good

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): love the chorus melody, but some of the lyrics are cringy and the production is a bit forgettable.

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's fun. Ava Max is very good at doing fun. I just don't think it's all that interesting compared to her other stuff

**shipperondeck** (7.3): this is stupid but better than i remember and, i fear, could be a future guilty bop. but why is the best first "if" so quiet lmao

**jexan13** (7): Not bad but kinda generic

**Uberpigeon** (7): remember when she promoted this with guitar emojis as if the guitar part wasnt only just a bridge

**welcome2thejam** (7): Constantly flipping on my opinion of this, but I'll admit so much of the song and MV occupies a tiny piece of my memory hole. When they suddenly get guitars and floppy hats? Unforgettable

Thedoctordances1940: ## Peasants

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): why is ava making weird penis euphemisms

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): [Forever thinking about this tweet‚Ä¶](https://i.imgur.com/o2M0kAD.png) Anyways I think this would have exploded if it were a Dorian Electra collaboration because this is exactly their brand and they would have given it the necessary spice. The ‚ÄúIf You Were A Woman (And I Was A Man)‚Äù sample is well integrated though.

**lillipup03** (6): Idk why, I always found her voice grating on this one

**seanderlust** (6): fitting this calls out queens because it is VERY girlboss vibes. i can almost see kiss mark emojis capping some of these lyrics.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6): The chorus is so strong and the verses are so weak

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): guitar solo queen

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): this has tiktok nursery rhyme energy, but before they were trendy, I guess she is an influential queen

**bulforster** (5.1): hmm

**jackisboredtoday** (3.6): she really hyped this as the ultimate anthem for girls and gays and then dropped a chorus that just blares with 0 dynamic change at you as if we were gonna eat that up

**akanewasright** (3): This song is easy to drag, because the only good part of the song (the chorus) is something Ava did not write. The verses are limp, the bridge is weak, and the lyrics are laughably bad - so it‚Äôs a pretty normal Ava Max song

**ricki** (3): loona deserved to win queendom

**arne** (1): I genuinely can't stand this song I'm sorry

**frogaranaman** (1): this may be one of the worst things ever conceived by mankind. instrumental solo fucks though

**MassiveThief** (1): Don't know what it is about the main melody but I hate it. Ruins the song.

**vayyiqra** (1): Can't get over the Bon Jovi interpolation - it's too much of a jumpscare. Aside from that, the corny sword metaphor (get it? it's a dick) is too much. All the lyrics, in fact, are bad. It's like "an attempt was made: girl power edition". This is terrible.

**cremeebrulee** (0): i could make a comment about how much i dislike these corporate, corny female empowerment songs but really i just hate this one because this boba place i went to in college would play this on repeat

**Roxieloxie** (0): i need ava max irradiated

**nlh1013** (10): would‚Äôve been my 11 if all the time wasn‚Äôt in this rate

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): Basslines at its finest

**Stryxen** (10): sudden and unexpected serve

**sunsetspt1** (10): I actually streamed this one 480 times last year according to my wrapped LOL, but I became so sick of it and haven't been able to listen in months so I can't give it my 11 I guess

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): that little piano in the chorus is so cute

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this is so mediocre i love it

**AHSWeeknd** (9): good for her

**fadedblue09** (9): The album's first serve

**seanderlust** (9): i love the bassline on this. i dislike the gang vocals on the chorus but i'm going to choose to ignore it

**skargardin** (9): Noonie Bao finally delivers the bop the album needs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this is the best song on the album

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): The less Tame Impala I have in my The Less I Know The Better the better

**shipperondeck** (8.6): a loud bass line woo

**afs** (8.5): of course the song is about the opposite of the title

**celladonn** (8.5): fun!

**emayzee** (8.5): i will enjoy anything with a prominent bassline

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): greyro anthem? (curious)

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This chorus is smooth like butter!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): That piano line is nice as hell.

**cremeebrulee** (8): this one is very cute n summery, love the vibes

**pig-serpent** (8): The bright summery keys make this song, and by extension the verses that don't have them feel empty.

**vayyiqra** (8): shoutout to this bassist, dude rocks

**welcome2thejam** (8): I mean, they check all the boxes of making a fun pop driving song, can't really argue with it

**akanewasright** (7.5): the instrumentation carries the song, but this is some of the coolest instrumentation in the rate

**jasannn** (7.5): another K-pop b-side

**ricki** (7.5): i love classical music

**indie\_fan\_** (7.1): This that happy go lucky pop shit that can be nice. Corny lyrics, but still a fun track

**1998tweety** (7): I originally had this at an 8 but then I saw ricki point out that the chorus sounds like kids singing in the background so I had to take off a point

## Soooo‚Ä¶ I Need Love was a lie?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): definitely the best song on the album but even then it's nothing special

**violet** (6.5): a lil..well boring

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): this is a song‚Ä¶ it exists

**CrimsonROSET** (6): her passion pit moment

**flavasavavandal** (6): Zara‚Äôs vocal performance and processing on the chorus is unquestionably bad but at least it has a nice bounce even if it is pretty repetitive

**bulforster** (5.3): hmm

**frogaranaman** (5): me on Tinder

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): "I've heard songs of more famous singers that are not so good but become popular. Now we have Zara Larsson that it's incredible, she give us real vocals and she don't get the same???? SheüëèüèΩ deserveüëèüèΩ moreüëèüèΩ"

**sage** (5): the children in the chorus need to shut the fuck up

**SmileAndTears** (5): why the kids in the background. my god. no. just... no

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): a bass riff this good shouldn‚Äôt be wasted on a song so boring

**jordannimz** (4.5): This song is fine, but it's kinda forgettable. Like I have no recollection of this song existing.

**DaHumanTorch** (2.8): i too need someone, someone to make sure these children in the background never sing again

**plastichaxan** (10): Me when I offered to cook a big meal for my family and forgot to buy salt and we didn‚Äôt have much left

**thedoctordances1940** (9.1): Always been one of my favourites on the album it‚Äôs just such a fun song and definitely some of the better lyrics on this album.

---

## Feeling like Wonder Woman

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I feel like this song was made for a 40 year old drag queen

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She doesn‚Äôt give AF about the salty shut-in dorks on r/popheads. She is ROCKING that haircut.

**hikk** (10): when she put this on streaming and eventually the album after it was only on youtube for a while she's a people pleaser she's tuned in to her audience she knows it's THE SLAY

**ignitethephoenix** (10): me when it‚Äôs really icy and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it

**jay duh** (10): YEPPPP her shady af comebacks era.. ate the twink up that this song is about

**jexan13** (10): absolute perfection

**jordannimz** (10): Ok, back your regularly scheduled programming of pop perfection. How did this song almost not make the album??? It's one of the best things she's put out ‚Äî perfectly danceable and lyrics that make you want to flip off your ex.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): "She has to notice that salt is getting great streamings on spotify and youtube! So it needs a music video and will blow up all over the place!!! üòç" fans fucken NNEED a tik tok dance or some new juicy ava max dancey movies. I AGREE THIS ONE SLAYS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): if I scrobbled Youtube, this would have a chokehold on my Ava plays. it‚Äôs giving a Natalia Kills vibe (affectionate)

**static\_int\_husp** (10): she's in her 2010 Angelina Jolie bag

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): fantastic pop song

**thegolding** (10): THE VIOLINS GIRL. I love Salt so much. I think she's a really good songwirter and her metaphors, though simple, are creative and smart, something we can really hear in Salt.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): queen of putting the only good song as track 15

**Vromega** (10): This chorus is such a bop omg. An instant fave

**1998tweety** (9.5): bop

**fadedblue09** (9.5): club crying banger

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): love how ava made a song that is relatable like once a year at most

**BaconShoes** (9): a disco-tinged smash

**skargardin** (9): banger

**seanderlust** (8.7): this would be a great drag race lip sync

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): Ignoring every word of the prechorus except how she says the word "pops" is the ideal way to enjoy this song

**Bordersz** (8): This is a banger. It is really catchy, Iand I love the vocal chopping.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): so SO many bad lyrics that distract from how much the song fucks

**throwaway-7650** (8): BAD IDEA BY ARIANA GRANDE?

**afs** (7.5): honestly after listening to the album I kinda understand how this was picked to be lead single (rng)

**jasannn** (7.5): Damn, her cooking must be bland af

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Girlboss anthem, in both a good and a bad way.

**shipperondeck** (7.5): unironically i need thigh highs so bad

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is my favourite generic bop off this album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Another song that was hyped up a lot before the album came out that I never quite got... points for the Wonder Woman reference, I appreciate that ‚Äúsuper heroes‚Äù are low-key integral to the fabric of the Ava Max brand

**TragicKingdom1** (7): why did the leak of this get her Next Main Pop Girl buzz lmao. it will NEVER be I Got It Bad

## Breaking Hearts

**akanewasright** (6.5): this isn‚Äôt as great as people make it out to be tbh but it‚Äôs competent enough to not tank

**fairytalehigh** (6.3): "i'm all out of salt" me leaving this rate

**anothertown** (6): all out of salt don't tell Samin Nosrat

**CrimsonROSET** (6): dehydration era

**vayyiqra** (6): At last one of the few bearable Ava songs in the sense there is nothing obnoxious about it. Okay maybe I lied, after hearing that verse about cake and snakes.

**cremeebrulee** (5.2): thigh highs? no more tears to cry? wasnt madison was supposed to be the arianabee of the rate

**bulforster** (5.1): hmm

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): go to the store and get more salt then? ava you're so dramatic

**frogaranaman** (5): I thought this song was finishing three different times before the last chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (5): drink some water

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): girl wtf are these lyrics

**Uberpigeon** (5): this is so relatable because i am all out of salt

**Awkward\_King** (4): ava's lyrics are so bad and ive neglected to mention it until now because i cant in good conscious defend any score above a 4 if i acknowledge them

**nicol(y)as(s)** (4): boring

**2dina3dworld** (2): this is forgettable Drag Race lip sync music

**Roxieloxie** (2): me when im an element

**ricki** (0): when i was little i used to eat salt directly from the shaker and one time i did it so much my tongue started bleeding. my score to this is unrelated to that story.

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): This is absolutely one of my favorites in the album like‚Ä¶ Wow she has so much power she needs to do this more often

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): This really had quite the surge towards the end of the rate, only just missing out on the top, but this is a really good song and definitely deserves its place up here. While it doesn‚Äôt really indicate what‚Äôs ahead on the album, this is quite a bit darker than much else on the album after all, it‚Äôs a good opener and a direction it‚Äôd be cool to see Zara go down.

---

## I do love you!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): This song gave birth to me, oops

**Vromega** (11): Best 2021 pop song imo

**AHSWeeknd** (10): is Zara Larson a waitress? Because she just served!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is a great introduction that got immediately ruined by easily the worst song off this album

**anothertown** (10): i played myself thinking she might have a splashy moody dramatic era when she released this as the lead

**BaconShoes** (10): so great. catchy hook/chorus and stellar production

**DaHumanTorch** (10): will be shocked if this isn't top 10

**ignitethephoenix** (10): aayyy ayy AHHHHH AHH

**jackisboredtoday** (10): these lyrics are so‚Ä¶.. but this production is so!!!

**jay duh** (10): hard to think of something for this but yass

**jordannimz** (10): What an intro! The combo of the sexy bass, the gorgeous strings, and her vocal delivery make this one of my fav songs by Zara.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): a worthy entry in the Swedish electropop canon, serves the right amount of drama and whimsy

**thegolding** (10): I felt a little disappointed when I realized this was just an amazing track and not a hint for what the actual album was going to sound like. I really wanted an album with this kind of production because this slays so much.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): her Greta Thunberg moment

**HornyForWater** (9.7): deserved better

**emayzee** (9.4): strings make everything better

**akanewasright** (9): I was so excited when she dropped this, like ‚Äúomg maybe the album is finally coming‚Äù‚Ä¶ and then it was another year

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Damn I know this is just supposed to be about the songs but she is SERVING in this music video go off!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): damn u shit with that

**hikk** (9): synth bass synth bass synth bass

**pig-serpent** (9): A good representation of what his album sounds like when it's firing on all cylinders.

**vayyiqra** (9): This bassline is really good and even the strings are (despite sounding fake).

**ricki** (8.8): love me land is where zara stores all of her slayage

**afs** (8.5): this could've been a CONCEPT album!

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): zara already clearing the other two dear lord

**seanderlust** (8.5): oh hey julia michaels! long time no see. this is overall fun! i am going to ignore some of the bad lyrics because it's enough of a vibe that it gets a pass.

**violet** (8.5): yass

**1998tweety** (8): boppy opener

**bulforster** (8): yass!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): What a fun concept for an album opener! I think the strings are so evocative, they really draw you into the mood that she‚Äôs trying to create. I just wish the verses were a bit stronger.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the intro really reminded me of the victorious theme song

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): feel like it could be a bit longer, or build to something a bit bigger, but still a bop

**TiltControls** (8): I'd love to go to love me land if it's filled with bops like this

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): me when im a knock off of an oscar winning flop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): why is it love me land and not just love land, what is the me adding here other than awkward grammar

**nicol(y)as(s)** (7): decent

## Not finding me there

**fairytalehigh** (6.7): i was feeling the hook until "can't contain my bones"

**indie\_fan\_** (6.6): Hook is honestly rather pleasant, but those notes in the verses are painful to listen to

**fadedblue09** (6): it's an opener alright

**skargardin** (6): the "sirens" were a choice

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's cute

**welcome2thejam** (6): Hate to admit it, but I'm a Love Me Land adult. I livestream all my visits for my youtube channel, I've spent thousands of dollars on Love Me Land themed merch, I wait in line for awkward Zara character meet and greets, the whole shebang

**frogaranaman** (5): you could probably do coke to this song

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): an intro!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): girl what is this choreo

**flavasavavandal** (4): damn those violins deserve better than the limpness of this song

**MassiveThief** (4): some lines feel like a purposeful parody of the avocoidies and banoinies voice

**mayaSS üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üòúüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë©** (3): go girl gives nothing

**Stryxen** (3): does this intro sample the silent hill siren

**Uberpigeon** (3): what is this

**cremeebrulee** (2.2): this is so boring dear god

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): I‚Äôve always found this song to be really boring and underwhelming. Wtf is vernaculary

**SmileAndTears** (0): that song used to play every day at work and like, its already a super annoying song, but add overplay on top of that? yeah no, I never wanna hear this song ever again

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): There‚Äôs so much to love about this song, brilliant production, catchy (yet not quite original) melodies, great verses, but the standout moment for me is the way she says boots, I genuinely love that.

**plastichaxan** (7): I‚Äôm glad y‚Äôall like it I do too I just never saw top 10 for her but it‚Äôs nice to see

---

## The Highs

**static\_int\_husp** (11): God I love this song. it just makes me want to run and explore the word and be free. The more songs like this Ava makes the better.

**TiltControls** (11): This is by far the best song in the rate and I'll be sad if it flops for not being a single

**1998tweety** (10): the sample on this is immaculate

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she said ‚Äúmoo‚Äù lmao

**akanewasright** (10): okay this song is wonderful but we deserved one extra chorus at the end, like the drum breakdown should lead into a more full final chorus to bring it home, but it kinda winds up falling flat

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this is great, could've been popular if she actually cared about this.

**BaconShoes** (10): another good use of sample. euphoric

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): See Ava Max is not an artist where you would expect deep cuts of this quality but here we are.

**emayzee** (10): this feels like a sister song to maybe you're the problem and i love it

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I listen to this and pretend that I‚Äôm gay Batman and honestly that‚Äôs so valid of me

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite album cuts, this is just very fun

**jay duh** (10): yeah sit down babes @DuaLipa god fuck this bridge is just too good like OMFG i ascend i levitate i float i cry i shed several tears i weep- oh hold up torn just started.

**jexan13** (10): This is my Anton Ego's Ratatouille moment. Truly captures the magic of late 00/early 10 music, but without the dated parts

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): Ava and her team just know how to make a fucking great, fun pop song. Love this song, so catchy

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): In the intro, I thought this is a Christmas song

**runaway3212** (10): okay real talk she is showing main pop girl potential here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): one of her best songs miss max more bops like this PLEASE. the final chorus ugh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ughhh unfortunately i always immediately have to give a good score to any song with an 80‚Äôs influence like this

**HornyForWater** (9.6): deserved at least a music video

**jackisboredtoday** (9.1): the sample carries this so hard but that melody is just heavenly

**hikk** (9): the vocoder part GAGGGGG

**skargardin** (9): :sobsing:

**SmileAndTears** (9): this bitch is incapable of not sampling an old hit kjdfsnlfgnkfjdszl

## The Pleasure

**afs** (8.5): wait is she trying to suggest her parents are her mother and her brother

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this album got 7 singles deep and this wasn't one of them?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): it's cute, which makes it an album highlight

**bulforster** (8.1): yass!

**jasannn** (8): this makes me feel yassified

**fairytalehigh** (7.9): "woo-ooh," "mood," and "boots," the 3 genders

**anothertown** (7.5): 'are you wearing the-' 'the leather boOoOOoOoTs? yeah, I am'

**jordannimz** (7.5): Oh she wants to be Gaga so bad (I don't blame her; So AÃ∂mÃ∂ Do I). And honestly it works ‚Äî this is perfectly boppable and the lyrics manage to come off as not cringy imo. Dare I say camp?

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): I'm so sick of the blinding lights style drum machine. The chorus is really good and I love the vocoder bit on the bridge and the slowed down drums in the outro.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This song does a great job of building up energy but a not so great job of building that energy up to anything.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): is this her experimental era

**Bordersz** (7): I like the beat and I found the melody unique.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): idk what that means but im happy for you or sorry that happened

**shipperondeck** (7): growing on me like the entirety of this album

**Uberpigeon** (7): she will never beat the gaga accusations

## The Poison

**celladonn** (6.5): my leather boo-oo-oo-oo-oots

**CrimsonROSET** (6): avampire

**ricki** (5.5): ava is the daughter from the night and gaga's marriage

**fadedblue09** (5): i'm sick of this synthwave sound

**frogaranaman** (5): this is serviceable to be tune

**Stryxen** (5): she made this for the furries so happy for them

**TheQueenOfVultures** (4): The last chorus feels like a weird middle ground between fading out and blowing up

**vayyiqra** (4): Every time I see this title I think it sounds like the name of a Gaga song, which doesn't help my feeling this album is kind of a LARP. But then I heard that melody and thought "really? the nugu German guy who was ballsy enough to write a response song to "Space Oddity", and also have it somehow be good? That's awfully bold". As a Bowie stan it takes me out of the song completely.

**Awkward\_King** (3): ava max is like if a popstar was programmed to be markettable to the gays but they forgot to add the good parts

**majid** (3): i'm bawling üò≠üò≠

**nlh1013** (3): this one just sounds kind of grating to me

**arne** (2): not the major tom cover GOD can this trend of ripping melodies from old songs end already I'm genuinely so annoyed by it

**2dina3dworld** (1): where the wild David Bowie sequel songs interpolations are. Sucks that a song with such a great title is such a flop

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): not woo-mood-boots!

**majid** (10): i am blown away, this is THE song that introduced me to screamo, it‚Äôs my favourite genre now, thank you ava max ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè

**sunsetspt1** (10): Probably my favorite Ava Max song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): not even the annoying spoken words can ruin this bop

**throwaway-7650** (10): anyway stream let's be friends - carly rae jepsen

**HornyForWater** (9.8): deserved to be a hit

**1998tweety** (9.5): now THIS is camp!

**DirtyRat583** (9.5): its bland but its groovy

**anothertown** (9): omg it's boppening

**pig-serpent** (9): This song is really good, but I think if Dua Lipa sang it it would be a 10.

**SmileAndTears** (9): That bridge? camp

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): me when I hear an actually good ava song

**MassiveThief** (8.5): Could do without the spoken part but hey it bangs

**shipperondeck** (8.3): this deserves lower i think but i have always really liked this song and was like if we ever rate this im giving it an 8.3. anyway

**afs** (8): broadcast my emotions tions tions and make them all dance to it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): that's one of the lamest screams i've ever heard in my life, but it bops

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Was going to be an 8.5, then that mini skit gave me ‚ÄúThe Kind Of Lover I Am Outro‚Äù Flashbacks

**jordannimz** (8): A song I worried was going to be terribly cringy, but ended up being a disco bop and a half. Such a good melody and production. Except the bridge. I SWEAR TO GOD, AAHHHHHHH

**runaway3212** (8): thank the heavens and hells she‚Äôs not a singer she‚Äôs an actor

**bulforster** (7.9): yass

**DaHumanTorch** (7.8): I had a really nice time with you. I mean, you're sort of a dick sometimes but...someone out there is surely gonna love a dick! Uh, check please?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the title is the worse thing about this song‚Ä¶ why didn‚Äôt she call it Look What You‚Äôve Done

**MToms** (7.8): This was great up until the part where she talks, I just don't like that in songs

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): the spoken bridge is so awful but fuck it its camp i guess

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i just dropped my phone in the toilet

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the bridge is camp

**seanderlust** (7): debate of the lifetime: is the delivery of the bridge camp or is it just bad

## Definitely want to punch it

**ricki** (6.5): i wanna snide at this more but i would eat it up if it were a future nostalgia song

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this absolutely sounds like come to brazil by alaska i wont be told otherwise

**fadedblue09** (6): That bridge was camp

**hikk** (6): no bc what IS happening? she's so real

**Uberpigeon** (6): fun fact phoebe bridgers sampled this scream for I Know The End

**arne** (5): the bassline saved it to a point where I feel indifferent about it but god..., the chord progression is so....

**LesApfels** (5): What does "running to your heart like magnets" even mean

**lillipup03** (5): That scream in the bridge knocked this song down at least two points

**oscarbrierley1** (5): I keep forgetting why I rate this song so low, then the spoken bit starts. The scream is just so bizarre.

**skargardin** (5): The bridge is giving major "HA! HA! I'm acting." teas

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): wtf was that spoken word segment lmao

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): Ava Max you'll never be Lady Gaga

**static\_int\_husp** (4.5): it's ok until the very bad spoken bridge

**notsomainpoplietoc** (4.2): "will make a good summer song for next Summer or bbqs"

**ernie** (4): boring, tired, and my least fave single from this era i used to be so obsessed with it but after a while it left a bad taste in my mouth.

**Roxieloxie** (4): :o

**2dina3dworld** (3): omg why would you release this?

**vayyiqra** (3): Kind of lolling at "broadcast my emotions on the radio" as someone who has worked in radio and knows it's not a very good way to reach someone - oh god that spoken word interlude where she's trying to be edgy and screeches loudly is so bad. Why. I forgot it almost ruins the song.

**cremeebrulee** (2.6): damn i would‚Äôve ate up this spoken word part in middle school ‚Ä¶ where was this 14 years ago

**aldwin\_is\_here** (2): I wish you didn't exist, like at all.

**fairytalehigh** (1): what's happening is i already gave my 0 to "so am i," amanda

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Comfortably one of my favourite songs in the rate and one of my two 11 contenders and what really makes the song for me is the little synth flourishes, they sound so good.

**plastichaxan** (7.5): :crunchyava:

---

## :crunchyava:

**fadedblue09** (11): Based on the hit singles, I always assumed Ava‚Äôs music was enjoyable on some novelty level. But this one‚Ä¶.impressed me a lot??? I wasn't expecting some emotionally vulnerable bop in this rate and yet she served it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This song had me absolutely snatched from the moment I first heard that synth intro, it‚Äôs one of my favorite pop songs and I have the scrobbles to back it up. Ava is, by her own admission, not a particularly ‚Äúdeep‚Äù artist but this one really resonates with me emotionally; I think there‚Äôs something to be said about the struggle to be vulnerable, and I think she captures that in a straightforward and approachable way. Musically, the song just melts on the ears like butter with comfortable synth pads, a smooth melody, and one of Ava‚Äôs best vocal performances to date. I do wish that there was more of a final chorus because it definitely has that whole ‚Äúending the song abruptly so you‚Äôll loop it‚Äù thing going on‚Ä¶ but it worked bitch, I‚Äôm streaming!

**majid** (11): hey joey/poppy, can you play the crunchy ava clip as the shitpost for this song

**mayaSS üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üòúüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë©** (11): THE BIRTH OF CRUNCHYAVA

**nathan** (11): she has made me into the person i am today. i owe my life to naked by ava max.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): Pour one out for Bonnie McKee, a pop girl barred from flying

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is peak songwriting. Pack it up Taylor.

**akanewasright** (10): This was my favorite song off the album on release, and I still consider it a damn good pop song. Bonnie McKee is one of my favorite songwriters of the early 10s, and any time she pops up, I‚Äôm glad to see her

**BaconShoes** (10): a smash hit :crunchyava:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh those are some PRISTINE bleep bloops. Hell yes.

**ernie** (10): another good single from this era, she really has the 1-2-3-4-5 punches with this album

**jay duh** (10): gag of the century.. And that final chorus yeah youre shaking u/ZaraLarsson

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): The production on these sounds so good

**runaway3212** (10): This chorus being literally top 2 in this rate

**skargardin** (10): Turning of the critical lyric thinking part of the brain to enjoy these absolutely slapping melodies and production choices. This can be applied to the entire album tbh.

**Stryxen** (10): :crunchyava:

**welcome2thejam** (10): Simple but effective, strong and vibrant hook, just a fun song to listen to. Gelling with this Ava performance, fitting that she sounds more like a natural on a song about wanting to show the real her

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): THOSE VOCALS AT THE END? GAG

**1998tweety** (9): cute bop

**bulforster** (9): YASS!

**cremeebrulee** (9): ok fine i will admit this one is good

**hikk** (9): the chorus helloooooo.... the catchiest melody u have ever heard in ur life..... it's no surprise that bonnie mckee has writing credits on this she's so powerful

**ignitethephoenix** (9): we love a slightly corny vulnerability anthem

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): ok i know the lyrics are immature but idc about lyrics and the final chorus SLAPS

**TiltControls** (9): Kind of corny lyrics, but it's done in a fun way so it works out

**ricki** (8.8): ava max didnt deserve this song, why didnt they give it to zara

**shipperondeck** (8.1): CRUNCHYAVA GANG

**afs** (8): Schrodinger's clothestripper

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I wish you were promoted more as a single.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): bop

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah I admit I only like this because it sounds like a cut from Emotion Side B. The "stripped back" metaphor is an awful clich√© of course, but we don't expect much from Ava's lyrics by this point.

**fairytalehigh** (7.3): kinda obnoxiously cute actually

**celladonn** (7): I like the production but not the lyrics

**jordannimz** (7): Is this the most profound song ever? No, but I appreciate a little bit of a more somber lyric, and as always, this is immaculately produced. I love Ava's vocals here, and the second prechorus is simply so good.

**nlh1013** (7): this was my fave on the album and it only garnered a 7 from me so‚Ä¶.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): the post chorus (or mid chorus?) section bops

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): :crunchyava:

## banned from :crunchyava:ing

**CrimsonROSET** (6): so she doesn‚Äôt want intimacy in love‚Ä¶ bestie that‚Äôs what one night stands are for

**ImADudeDuh** (6): ok

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): this song lacks any kind of spark, it feels really empty to me. Her trying to do vocal runs and riffs sounds so forced and unnatural.

**starla\_** (5.4): kinda boring

**frogaranaman** (5): is this supposed to be a ballad

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): "wow. saw a video of her singing at home and proves she can do it all. i mean in terms of being really talented outside of a studio on basic equipment." gotta agree but jesus we need to get some sweaty hyperdub bois in here to give her a real BITE.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): my favorite part of youtube introducing the most replayed timestamps on videos is that i can see the most replayed part of this song is when it ends

**Vromega** (5): Weak lyrics and weak instrumentation

**2dina3dworld** (4): okay Doja Cat

**nicol(y)as(s)** (4): meh. overrated

**static\_int\_husp** (4): this is a song I only remember from crunchy_ava.mov and this is actually a lot slower (read: worse) than I remember

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): this song is so bad but so many songs in this rate are worse so im gonna pretend to like it

**sage** (3.2): snoozefest

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): I do really like this but I think it could‚Äôve left a little bit earlier for me, but I also don‚Äôt begrudge it too much

## HO-LY SMOKES

**Stryxen** (11): HO-LEY üëº üôè SMOKES üí£ üö¨ !! zara please release a 10 minute mix it‚Äôs too short babe

**anothertown** (10): holy smoaks!!!!!

**celladonn** (10): HO LEE SMOKES!!!

**jay duh** (10): HO-LY SMOKES! This song is so fucking good!!!!! Like jaw dropping good

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): Hoe-lee smokes!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): good for ho lee, I'm not into smoking but you do you

**ernie** (9): HOLY SMOKES!!!!

**fairytalehigh** (9): she gets a 9 just because she says "holy smokes" in a cute way

**skargardin** (9): holy smokes what a bop

**pig-serpent** (8.5): Holy Smoke, Oh my God, somebody stop Zara from her endless onslaught of bangers (Actually though please do not.)

**afs** (8): HOLY SMOKES!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ho-ly smokes

**DaHumanTorch** (8): hoe lee smokes!

**oscarbrierley1** (8): really pretty chorus melody. Something about the phrase holy smokes being in a song makes me laugh. The rest of the song goes hard enough for me to overlook that.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I‚Äôm not a native English speaker and to me, ‚Äúholy smokes‚Äù sounds cheesy

**TiltControls** (8): Holy smokes this is great!

**hikk** (7.5): HO LY SMOKES.......

**jordannimz** (7.5): Ho-ly smokes! This song is quite welcome after the past few disappointing songs!

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): down so bad you start saying holy smokes unironically

**ImADudeDuh** (6): white people need to start saying ‚Äúholy smokes‚Äù again

## HO-LY SMOKES in spirit

**1998tweety** (10): Literal pop perfection, adding to my playlist

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this is pop music, I enjoy it.

**Awkward\_King** (10): zara kinda drowned madison and ava in the mother lake with this one

**fadedblue09** (10): This is really catchy

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): They were gonna take her rights away but then they heard this and gave her another shot

**jasannn** (10): This would make a great k-pop song.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): "If you didn't catch it - this song is not just about a relationship, it's about weed" honestly when you put it like that the song becomes an auto ten. sorta going down the same logic path I've done when i claim 'andrew wk's she is beautiful is about embracing your femme side'. lmfao at this being 3 years old GOD these people love to just have good tracks sitting on the sidelines and then plopping 'em in their sea of chaff.

**ricki** (10): "oh my god, i won" i manifest with zara as i light 5 candles in star formation and get my livestock sacrifice ready to make sure we get that rate win

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): oh thank god i was starting to worry this album wasn‚Äôt going to have any good songs on it

**throwaway-7650** (10): throwback to when I did a weed chicken mukbang for 4/20/22

**HornyForWater** (9.7): should have been a single

**akanewasright** (9.5): this song has grown off me a touch from me overplaying it, but also it‚Äôs easily one of my favorites of the rate

**BaconShoes** (9.5): kind of genius to make a song that seems like it‚Äôs a love song but it‚Äôs actually just about how much she likes smoking weed. It‚Äôs also a bop

**vayyiqra** (9): Yeah this song and arguably this whole album is kind of a LARP as Future Nostalgia but I like it

**jexan13** (8): cute

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): it's kind of giving knockoff Future Nostalgia but in a good way

**nicol(y)as(s)** (8): a just dance classic

**shipperondeck** (7.9): i underrated this album before listening to it

**nlh1013** (7.5): if Madison was writing songs about my ex, Zara is writing about my new boy ü•∞

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): this chorus is infectious

**bulforster** (7.2): yass

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): a good title track

**lillipup03** (7): This might be the most random pick for a Just Dance soundtrack ever‚Ä¶ but I approve

**Uberpigeon** (7): ok its bopping

**welcome2thejam** (7): Lost her opportunity to be the poster girl of D.A.R.E. that's for sure

## HO-LY SMOKES (derogatory)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): More like the poster girl of mall playlist filler.

**frogaranaman** (5): alright title track

**indie\_fan\_** (2): Me seeing this track posted on the rates channel for the 100th time: ‚ÄúHow many times do we have to see this song, gay boy!?‚Äù

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): I think this got the most Ari comparisons of any of Madison‚Äôs songs and I can definitely see that but it‚Äôs very much a great song in its own right and honestly i think the rhyming of on on on with on on on works really well in this context.

**1998tweety** (10): she devoured here

**AHSWeeknd** (10): GENIUS, UTTER HORNY GENIUS that Popheads will underrate.

**anothertown** (10): this shit is on another level, elsewhere..

**babadork** (10): This is another really nice vocal performance.

**BaconShoes** (10): a smash, very yass

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Mmmmmm‚Ä¶baby!

**ernie** (10): this song is so fucking good i‚Äôm sorry

**jay duh** (10): took arianas ponytail and wore it gorgeously.. now thats how you out-do the doer!

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): even if the auto "on on on" is funny, her outfits are slay. gotta appreciate the strings that sound like they accidentally came from a Leaving Records cassette release.

**shipperondeck** (9.9): lost points for saying "more sweet" instead of "sweetest" idc that it wouldn't rhyme it just sounds silly as it is

**sage** (9.6): slay bridge

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): oh this is a bop

**HornyForWater** (9.4): I only like upbeat music which is why I love this song

**Bordersz** (9.1): I thought this was a pop bop, like a HIT, but y'all paid her dust. I really like the sound on this song, I wish she made more songs like this.

**akanewasright** (9): this one is a dumb bop, but I buy it as Madison‚Äôs song more than like‚Ä¶ Good In Goodbye or pre-album singles like Hurts Like Hell

**ImADudeDuh** (9): now why is this the smasha

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): i feel like it tries too hard at points but it‚Äôs still sorta good

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): "probably gonna call me crazy" omg ava isn't the only one sweet but psycho here

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I‚Äôm shocked that this isn‚Äôt an Ava Max style ‚Äúsong cobbled together out of samples‚Äù because it totally has that vibe? Honestly she was kinda ahead of her time with this one, it totally sounds like the ‚Äò00s revival thing that‚Äôs in right now.

**jordannimz** (8): Ok I really hate when songs are called "Baby" because it just feels SO clich√© to me. Even "(If You Wanna Be My) Baby" would be a better title imo. But moving past that, I really do like this song and I love how sexy this makes me feel.

**ricki** (8): ignore my score when you see me throwing a tantrum if this beats all the time

**skargardin** (8): thank god there are some bops on the back half

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this could have been bop of the century if the chorus wasn't so clunky with all the "on's"

**vayyiqra** (8): Madison do more songs with trip-hop-ish beats I cannot get enough of it

## Clothes still on on on

**MToms** (7.5): I had heard this one and the Ariana comparisons before, but it sounds good

**emayzee** (7.3): are you sure this isn't camila

**oscarbrierley1** (7): lyrics like AI wrote an ariana song.

**Stryxen** (7): is this her horny moment lmao its a bop but she just sounds bored and uncomfortable. asexuals won happy pride month

**bulforster** (6.2): yas

**CrimsonROSET** (6): us losing our mind trying to figure out the video in the listening party

**fadedblue09** (6): not very appealing

**fairytalehigh** (5.7): i left "BOYSHIT" for this??

**seanderlust** (5.5): this is really pretty! i like this quite a bit. her voice sounds really soft (complimentary) on the bridge. that said, it's boring

**frogaranaman** (5): I don't understand straight people

**pig-serpent** (5): I‚Äôm not sure this more upbeat pop is what Madison‚Äôs style should be.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this song peaked at its intro

**Roxieloxie** (4.3): me when im baby

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): if this is supposed to be sexy then it's not working

**Uberpigeon** (2): this is someone elses baby

**apatel27** (0): Bad lyrics, boring flow, boring instrumental

## No, we‚Äôre not playing it as the interlude üòá

**Awkward\_King** (10): charli sweetie

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the Ariana comparisons are so boring, let‚Äôs talk about how Charli definitely took notes from queen Madison

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): imma fuck you up imma fuck you up imma fuck you up

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Charlotte XCX outsold

**hikk** (7.5): imma make you my imma make you my imma make you my......

**afs** (7): honestly forgot charli, even bieber outsold

**starla\_** (5.2): Charli outsold

**plastichaxan** (10): I don‚Äôt know what describes the rate better between this and White Girl Rate

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Yass and Slay

---

## Yass and Slay

**1998tweety** (11): they do do that dont they

**afs** (11): really there was no competition. this was always going to eat up the flops.

**Awkward\_King** (11): this name raised me, shaped who i am as a person and yassed every single one of my slays

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): yass slay

**flavasavavandal** (11): insert noitstrue gif here

**frog (i guess)!** (11): YAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I know we could never actually use this but it feels correct and true to the spirit/audience of the rate.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): omg Spill!!!

**majid** (11): if you didn't yass at least once while doing this rate, you're lying to yourself

**RandomHypnotica** (11): :yassgrenade: :yasspills: :beberexhaslay:

**runaway3212** (11): the name, the myth, the legend. The most yass and slay name to ever yass and slay

**SLAYdedblue09** (11): If this doesn't win , I am CALLING the authorities

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): yass & slay title

**vayyiqra** (11): It's not the funniest name but we've all used it so much it just feels right.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Bestie went off, queen, spill, sksksks

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): YASS

**ricki** (10): based on the vernacular of anyone that happens to stan these ladies it felt appropriate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): debatable with how much of this rate actually yass'd and slay'd but it's iconic

**TiltControls** (10): yass/slay

**pig-serpent** (8): I love this name but sadly it's not descriptive enough to be a good name.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): yep.

**seanderlust** (7): WHERE is bebe rexha if this is truly a slay rate

**shipperondeck** (7): add yass bomb emoji to the popheads emote catalog PLEASE

**welcome2thejam** (7): I didn't realize this was another name for Not So Main Pop Girls and not a completely different rate until after it actually got approved, I was so confused for so long

## Naur and Flop

**fairytalehigh** (5): more like ASS and NAY amirite

**Roxieloxie** (4): kinda yass kinda slay

**DirtyRat583** (2): this would be a good rate title, but madison beer - therefore I cannot give it slay/10 sorry üíî

**arne** (0): if this rate was yass and slaying, why is my average just above 4

**Jexan13** (0): the only thing Zara has slayed is her own career

**Stryxen** (0): marmiteman I wish you never found out about the word slay

**plastichaxan** (9): I mean it‚Äôs the official name I can‚Äôt tank this

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Getting the fewest 11s but still winning is quite the achievement but it also feels right for this? It‚Äôs the title that works the best, gets straight to the point but also because it‚Äôs been officially known as this for ages the title has sort of lost its novelty and the funnier aspect has slightly worn off

---

## It‚Äôs a good title that‚Äôs why it was picked!

**ricki** (11): I'll give head to whoever came up with this one, I'm a little mad i didn't think of it myself. describes everything you need to know about the girls and why they were pitched together

**Stryxen** (11): t

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A very professional title, I could see this title working in an office

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): , it lacked Bebe Rexha but other than that this was a great selection!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): banger title, rolls off the tongue and gets straight to the point while also being slightly shady

**shipperondeck** (10): i mean it's true

**thegolding** (10): this was the smartest one tbh

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): clear and concise

**welcome2thejam** (10): The queen for a reason

**indie\_fan\_** (9): Yeah, I think this is the most fitting name for this rate out of them all.

**runaway3212** (9): a queen, a bit basic but she‚Äôs slay

**notsomainpoplietoc** (8.2): undeniable

**Awkward\_King** (8): what happened to main flop girls

**DirtyRat583** (8): it's the one we know and love

**fairytalehigh** (8): an undeniable classic.

**flavasavavandal** (8): an iconic rate name but one that will not end up aging well since we all know Ava's coming for global domination

**frog (i guess)!** (8): it's a cute kitschy name. I like it

**pig-serpent** (8): A classic name, can't complain about it

**RandomHypnotica** (8): it's cute, it's succinct, it works

**SLAYdedblue09** (8): A worthy runner up

**TiltControls** (8): solid final choice

**vayyiqra** (8): A very clear and straightforward name though it isn't funny nor is it yass. Makes the most sense probably though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Serviceable.

## Who wouldn‚Äôt want to do a rate called New Super Mario Pop Girls more than this tbh

**afs** (6.5): Not-So Good

**Jexan13** (6.5): considering popheads tastes and delusions, this could mean literally anyone

**anothertown** (6): Subjective, there are some for whom these are the main pop girls

**seanderlust** (6): can't disrespect an OG, even if there are other names i like better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): its the most accurate, but its not exactly a very "fun" title either

**1998tweety** (5): thats what they are, yes

**majid** (0): very generic

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (11): God just‚Ä¶ I was afraid of the concept but everything about this song is perfect to me: The bass, the vocal production, just about everything she really IS mother.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): First elimination of our top 5 and we‚Äôve finally passed the 8 average mark (just about) but this is such a great song and comfortably my favourite on this album. The darker production on the chorus sounds incredible and the dynamic increase just builds up the tension brilliantly, just such a good track.

---

## See the truth

**DaHumanTorch** (11): she detached her pussy, melted it down to titanium and steel, then turned it into a hard drive and when she plugged it into her laptop, this song is what she heard

**nicol(y)as(s)** (11): Not saying mother for an ENTIRE minute - challenge

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): I did not see this dark pop excellence coming, but I should have known she had it in her after Villain

**thegolding** (11): This is the fisrt song that I heard out of Liffe Support, an album that ended up becoming one of my indisputably favoritoes from 2021. This song reminds of a period in my life, and looking back, and getting a better look at the amazing lyrics, I can see why I liked it so much. Uncounscious mind I guess. Anyway, the track is great, the lyrics and the Alice in Wonderland references are amazing and this should have been a single. Thank you Madison for this song.

**2dina3dworld** (10): ‚ÄúYuh‚Äù I see you Ariana bestie

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I‚Äôm glad she didn‚Äôt pack this with Alice In Wonderland references.

**akanewasright** (10): YES MADISON GIVE ME LIFE!!! THE GUITAR IS YOUR BEST FRIEND!!! Also the singer Raye, known for a few UK dance hits and being trapped by her record label, co-wrote this and you can hear her impact. It‚Äôs a great fit for Madison‚Äôs voice and I‚Äôd love to hear them work together more

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Not sure I‚Äôm following the metaphor here but SLAAAAAAYYYYYY.

**celladonn** (10): top notch production

**ernie** (10): FOLLOW THE WHITE PUSSY TO SEE THE TRUTH :oprah:

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is the song that convinced me to check out this album, it was nothing like what I expected from an artist like Madison and I hope it performs well in the rate. Wonderland imagery is pretty common in quirky girl music but her take on it is pretty refreshing, she actually pulls off the edginess necessary to make the concept work.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): honestly this is more interesting of a song than most pop girlies have been putting out these days

**jay duh** (10): this beat has my heart in a death grip just waiting to end me

**jexan13** (10): So unique

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ugh i LOVE this song, strong 11 contender. miss beer more songs like this pls

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ok yeah this is yassing and slaying

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): YASSSSSSS

**BaconShoes** (9.5): this one really comes together

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Now this is intriguing

**hikk** (9.5): her experimental moment yass

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): love the maximalist production. The yuhs are maybe giving a bit ariana but I let it slide because I love the rest.

**1998tweety** (9): this goes HARD

**Awkward\_King** (9): ok serve a little

**cremeebrulee** (9): this song is kind of nonsense and just pure vibes but luckily that is my fave genre of music

**lillipup03** (9): This is not the sound I expected on this album but I love it

**majid** (9): maybe they were right about tagging this album as ‚Äúexperimental pop‚Äù on aoty‚Ä¶

**welcome2thejam** (9): Didn't expect this type of sound here, and it's definitely got my interest

**anothertown** (8.5): the eerie bells.. yea

**starla\_** (8.5): this sounds like an Ariana song in a good way

**TiltControls** (8.5): Love how dark and atmospheric this one is

**afs** (8): madison should really do heavy metal

**arne** (8): a song I like? in this rate????????????? what

**CrimsonROSET** (8): alislay in yassland

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this song is good but the chorus has the same problem of Demi Lovato - Daddy Issues

**Stryxen** (8): gagged the old art pop ladies a bit

**vayyiqra** (8): This is like an alternate universe where Ava makes a song with a "ooh it's like a kid's movie but ~twisted" theme but because Ava didn't write it, it isn't awful.

**violet** (8): im following the white rabbit

## Need to follow the white rabbit

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): is this your drug song or your hyperpop audition. Can it be both?

**babadork** (7.4): The production is a little bit too much. I think they could have removed one element to let the beat shine more.

**bulforster** (7.2): yass

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): yeah i would‚Äôve stanned this is it dropped when i was 12

**shipperondeck** (7.1): her sound is just like too much i think and it's not really cohesive. idk maybe it'll grow on me as we continue

**jordannimz** (7): The chorus goes hard, and I love the real drums that come in in the second verse/outro.

**pig-serpent** (7): There's a lot to love about the rocky bassline and blown out drums of this track but I don't think many of the sections flow well into each other and the production could go a bit harder. It‚Äôs her most ambitious song but it doesn‚Äôt match up to its potential.

**skargardin** (7): the production is pretty insane

**SmileAndTears** (7): its giving industrial post-punk indie rock alternative slayyyyy vibe yassssssssss

**notsomainpoplietoc** (6.9): a real honky tonker

**Bordersz** (6): Interesting chorus.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): is this what normal people think hyperpop sounds like

**nlh1013** (5.5): the melody saved this for me, idk why the reference to the white rabbit seems a little try hard to me

**frogaranaman** (5): does she mean Bugs Bunny

**Vromega** (5): too much boring distortion

**MassiveThief** (4): Yassified Yeezus

**Uberpigeon** (3): this has all the ingredients to a song that i like but its just not doing it for me

**Roxieloxie** (2.4): me when my name IS alice

**fairytalehigh** (2): i just really fucking hate that chorus

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (9.5): This being put on the beginning of the album just adds to the concept, this is purgatory, this isn‚Äôt Heaven or Hell, this is her head & heart poured into song form. Misfits rise for our anthem!

**thedoctordances1940** (6.3): Yeah I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of this song and it mainly comes down to the chorus. I do really like the verses and pre-chorus but then the chorus itself i just find kinda flat, i don‚Äôt think the synth sounds great and like the generic dance beat is fine as a whole so I usually just end up listening to the original version of the album without this.

---

## You should stay!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): More like my yasss and my slay!!!

**DirtyRat583** (11): this song oozes europe in a way i cant explain AND IT IS SO GOOD

**HornyForWater** (11): please stand up for the gay anthem

**lost-ln-the-echo** (11): this was one of my most listened to songs of 2021, huuuuge bop

**MassiveThief** (11): the beat drop when the chorus starts is the epitome of yass & slay. and the sample/interpolation is so perfect.

**RoyalBloodFool** (11): I go to extremes

**SmileAndTears** (11): That fucking BEAT hoLY sHIET. Idc that she keeps sampling old hits and has no originality as long as the songs BANG

**starla\_** (11): this song embodies yass and slay...the sample is genius if you're old enough to remember the yass and slay of 'Around The World (La La La)'

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): this song is like crack to me. legitimately one of my favourite songs released the last few years

**Uberpigeon** (11): charli WISHES her uncreative samples bopped this hard. Plagiarism queen ava untouchable!!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): FUCK ME THE FUCK UP, THIS IS MUSIC.

**akanewasright** (10): I usually drag this era of Ava for being unable to make a song without relying on an obvious sample, but the advantage of a song like this is that since 80% of it is recycled from a good song, she only has the other 20% to fuck up, and she mercifully doesn‚Äôt fuck this up

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): the perfect song to start this era

**anothertown** (10): this is my favorite of her samples so it's a shame that she gets it out of the way at the beginning of the album, lol.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i actually hate how good this song is it really shouldnt be

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): the word "slay" is probably gonna get thrown around a lot in this rate as a joke but this song is genuinely a massive slay

**BaconShoes** (10): MY HEAD, AND MY HEART!!! This is so good omg it‚Äôs infectious. She slayed this sample

**ernie** (10): the sample is just perfect, even though it‚Äôs quite unoriginal of ava to constantly do samples on her songs this song has the best use of the sample she used

**fadedblue09** (10): Starting off with an instant wig snatcher wow

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Yes the usage of the sample is a bit lazy but I‚Äôve listened to this too many times to pretend it isn‚Äôt an absolute banger.

**hikk** (10): everyone had better have been prepared to take cover asap upon starting this rate bc we're being immediately bombarded by a YASS AIRSTRIKE

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is the capital Yass & Slay anthem of the rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://gfycat.com/grossdimpledcondor

**jasannn** (10): it doesn‚Äôt make sense as a retroactive opener but one of her best.

**jay duh** (10): this song... beyond earth shattering. It was a nexus event if we're being honest with ourselves. Beginning to end its just an adrenaline rush of slay and gag and yass.. i fear Miss Max is unstoppable when it comes to snatching a euro pop sample.. couldnt even tell you who originally sung this but i want to give them a kiss on the lips maybe a little hj or just ???? depending on how the night goes.. thank you AVA MAX for being the queen that you are and blessing us with these masterpieces that sadly get overlooked because the world is too scared to accept your gaggery

**jordannimz** (10): This is basically pop perfection, and a great use of a nostalgic interpolation. Technically a deluxe track, but still a great opener for the album.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): So camp. Is the most catchy part the sample? Yes. Do I care? No the song is a bop.

**seanderlust** (10): is the most redeeming quality of this song the sample? yes. would i possibly be better served just listening to around the world (la la la) by ATC? maybe. does this still slap? yes. yes it does

**shipperondeck** (10): currently blasting this while reluctantly traveling amongst the mountains of ireland #yass

**Stryxen** (10): she was so right to put this at the start of the album for no reason there is no time where i would want to listen to ava and not listen to this song first

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): unironically a way better use of an obvious 00s dance sample than Beg for You

**emayzee** (9.3): when a sample works it WORKS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.2): we love to see Ava & Beyonc√© spearheading the 90s dance revival

**1998tweety** (9): Jorgeous ate this

**lillipup03** (9): You know that one Vine with the original, right? Childhood.

**skargardin** (9): A brave choice of a sample

**sunsetspt1** (9): Heard this for the first time on the radio, great hooks that drew me into the rest of the album

**TiltControls** (9): It's fun, but would probably also give me a headache if I looped it too much

**welcome2thejam** (9): Jeez, I'd be madder at the lazy interpolation if this chorus didn't go way tf off. Bop!

**afs** (8.5): it gives green m(h)&m(h)

**Bordersz** (8.5): I mean it's only a bop bc the sample was a bop. Her vocals went off on this.

**ricki** (8.5): thinking of @ing a certain popheads favorite so she takes a tip or two on how to sample a classic and not butcher. im sure she'll see it, i know she name-searches

**MToms** (8): I recognized the sample immediately and had to look up where it was from. Its presence might be bumping up the song score for me.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): DO THE JORGEOUS! DO THE JORGEOUS!

Thedoctordances1940: ## You should go :(

**indie\_fan\_** (7.7): Thought this was a Clean Bandit Song

**celladonn** (7.5): Slays a bit

**majid** (7.5): me when mediocre pop girls sample classic european hits ü§©

**bulforster** (7): yass

**CrimsonROSET** (7): blanket trio >

**runaway3212** (7): the trend on this album is the sample being better than the song

**violet** (7): la la la la la lalalala

**Vromega** (7): Sampling so heavily a huge success can be sloppy. Luckily it's not the case here ! This song doesn't take much risk but works well as a eurodance bop

**static\_int\_husp** (6): we love a song that was tacked onto the album so carelessly it comes before the intro

**vayyiqra** (6): I see we begin with the Ava trend of "songs that are okay only because they sample another, better song which I remember from my childhood".

**RandomHypnotica** (5.9): when the best part of your song comes from the sample‚Ä¶ that is not a good sign

**LesApfels** (5.5): I'd rather listen to Around the World

**cremeebrulee** (5.4): i have only heard the snippet from the ph charts so uh i had no idea this had that sample lmao

**2dina3dworld** (5): okay tropical pop queen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): it‚Äôd be higher if it didn‚Äôt play every single day at my retail job (yes i‚Äôm still tanking songs off retail trauma)

**pig-serpent** (4): I get that you can do cool things with interpolation but this is just the original song?

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): I loved it when she said "my mys got a mymymy"

**fairytalehigh** (2.5): ava i am BEGGING you stop sampling eurodance

**Roxieloxie** (1.7): i cant believe this was in tall girl 2

**frogaranaman** (1): I keep on expect the "All Day & Night" melody and that ruins the song for me

**Hulnia** (1): i didn‚Äôt think this was THAT bad when it first came out, but after going back to the vastly superior song it samples and months of overplay of both the song and it‚Äôs genre in my country, i can‚Äôt stand it anymore. everytime i cry did everything this song was going for but much better.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): IT‚ÄôS BEEN ONE MINUTE AND SOMEONE HAS ALREADY DISLIKED THIS?

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): Definitely among her best I‚Äôm very happy this ended up being her highest rated

**thedoctordances1940** (9.3): And here it is, Ava is out! Although with all three artists making the top three it‚Äôs no achievement and this was always going to have a tough time against All The Time and Boyshit but this is a great pick for Ava‚Äôs best song. It‚Äôs easily one of her catchiest and most fun songs, especially helped by the campy music video and the ABBA ‚Äúsample‚Äù is a fun little thing that just adds some recognisability to it.

---

## Not Torn

**ernie** (11): Her best single and my favorite song of her, idk something about this just makes me so emotional because i got to know ava because of the release with torn so yeah :)

**shipperondeck** (11): an explosion of maximalist pop greatness. idc. i love this song AND ITS SILLY SUPERHERO THEMING. IDC [2]


**AHSWeeknd** (10): There‚Äôs a good chance Ava Max is Satan, cause she fell from Heaven into Hell

**amr** (10): "torn between heaven and hell" omg U guys she said it WOAHHHHH

**Awkward\_King** (10): oh this song is good wtf?

**BaconShoes** (10): RIGHT NOW BABY I‚ÄôM TORN!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Why wasn‚Äôt this a multi-week number one smash hit??? No reason. We should be ashamed.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i thought about giving this a 9.9 but i realize i was being petty. ok fine ava u got me here

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ava DRAINED the mother lake with this one, this is why california has a water crisis

**DirtyRat583** (10): i dont have 170 scrobbles of this for no reason

**fadedblue09** (10): she's no Natalie Imbruglia but it's still a bop

**jay duh** (10): OMFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG ITS JUST TOO GOOD... i wanted to 11 but i have to stand by queen madison but AH! This absolute serve deserves it so so so much

**jexan13** (10): like cocaine. The 11 if Madison Beer slapped slightly less

**majid** (10): ‚Äúi‚Äôm torn in-between Heaven & Hell‚Äù  oh my lord, the title-drop, if this doesn‚Äôt prove that this is the greatest concept album since Sufjan Stevens‚Äô ‚ÄúIllinois‚Äù, i have no clue what will

**RandomHypnotica** (10): absolutely AWFUL music video, but the song is a fucking slay

**skargardin** (10): It's the serve

**Stryxen** (10): who is Tom

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i love basic pop. also love the "i'm turn in between heaven and hell" halfway thru the album she's a genius

**Vromega** (10): This chorus is so fresh, I can't help myself from singing RIGHT NOW BABY I'M TORN :yas:

**ignitethephoenix** (9): never liked Torn as much as other singles from her but it‚Äôs still good

**SmileAndTears** (9): SHE SAID THE THING!!!! SHE SAID HEAVEN AND HELL!!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

**afs** (8.5): is there gonna be a t0rn to tank this

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I can‚Äôt find it anymore but my favorite memory of Ava Max is when she did an acoustic performance of this song and even though she was sitting down the entire time she still insisted on ripping her jacket off to do a dramatic costume change‚Ä¶ like that‚Äôs the charming level of over-earnestness I expect from her.

**nicol(y)as(s)** (8.5): partial slay

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ava max war criminal

**lillipup03** (8): This would've been a much better follow up to Sweet But Psycho than So Am I ugh

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): Natalie Imbruglia outsold /s

**oscarbrierley1** (8): a fun song, some one of the more interesting instrumentals on the album.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): oh no!

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): you're contagious baby but only for like the first minute

**TiltControls** (7): The sample is nice, but the rest of the song could've been a bit more remarkable

## Torn

**bulforster** (6.4): yas

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): "They dont make songs like this anymore. OMG this takes me back to the 2010s, it feels so great!"

**akanewasright** (4): okay I used to like this song a lot, but as time‚Äôs gone by, I‚Äôve realized that the topline is kind of‚Ä¶ nothing? Like it‚Äôs not catchy or interesting, it just fits well enough with the admittedly great production. A disappointment at the end of it all

**runaway3212** (4): she wrote ‚Äúim torn in between heaven and hell‚Äù and that‚Äôs all she did for concept

## Not Torn

**frogaranaman** (1): one thing I'm not torn up about is giving this song a terrible score!

## Gimme Gimme Gimme just one song without an instantly recognisable sample Ava please!

**emayzee** (11): between this and hung up by madonna, im obsessed with the GGGCU (gimme gimme gimme cinematic universe)

**1998tweety** (10): this really should've smashed. The sample is great, it's placed perfectly within the album too.

**hikk** (10): FADBBA / FADONNA

**jordannimz** (10): A thematic genius! It's like she's Torn between Heaven & Hell! Never been done before! But I'm not Torn on whether or not I like the song....... it's really really good! Plus ABBA sample!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): using an abba sample on this shes never beating the european allegations is she

**seanderlust** (9.7): i am contractually obligated to rate any song that samples gimme x3 favorably

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): for that Gimme, Gimme, Gimme sample is easily used well in this song!

**apatel27** (9): ABBA deserves it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): anything remotely inspired by ABBA is automatically a banger

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): ABBA called madonna who called dua who called to ask for their flute back, amanda

**ricki** (8): they must have had a lot of trust in their legal team

**MToms** (7): Is that ABBA in the back

**static\_int\_husp** (4): someone call the lawfirm of Agnetha, Bj√∂rn, Benny, and Anni-Frid, because ABBAs lawyers need to put a stop to this

**vayyiqra** (4): I am told this song "subtlely" samples Abba. We have different ideas of what subtle is, I guess. I am also told the video shows "Amanda flying out of the ocean floor and back into her boyfriend's sight, as she proceeds to electrocute him by punching him in the mouth" and I'm glad I did not watch any of the videos for this rate. It's too early in the morning for this.

**2dina3dworld** (2): gimme gimme gimme a reason to live because this song is making me regret everything

## I don't üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è speak üó£BOYSHIT üë¶üí©

**2dina3dworld** (11): I‚ÄôM SORRY BUT I DON‚ÄôT TALK

**babadork** (11): The opening is epic, and I like the use of sound effects. However, I have changed my 11 so many times this rate that I‚Äôm fully expecting not to remember during the reveal.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): this is the introvert of this rate

**fairytalehigh** (11): so much of this album is biege mid-tier ariana/lana cosplay, then all of a sudden there's "BOYSHIT," like a flaming rainbow chainsaw festooned with dildos

**hikk** (11): it's getting HUNTY up in here

**ignitethephoenix** (11): it‚Äôs(hould have been) the smasha!

**jexan13** (11): the 11 was so clear from the beggining. Like, that epic intro, those verses, that energy, that bad bitch attitude, so catchy, so sexy, so good. This should win, this is art

**RandomHypnotica** (11): absolutely fucking immaculate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): um yes queen skinny legend versace boots the house down slay queen hunty mama and oop daddy work madison beer snatch my wig

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it really bummed me out to acknowledge the fact that I do in fact speak boyshit

**anothertown** (10): https://ibb.co/JFFhDLb

**Awkward\_King** (10): why has it taken this long for her to learn how to make good songs

**BaconShoes** (10): PEOPLE DIED

**cremeebrulee** (10): ended bilinguals

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i cannot unhear "i don't speak abortion"

**fadedblue09** (10): Sis was hiding the bops in the second half wow

**frogaranaman** (10): does this pass the Bechdel test

**jay duh** (10): scat visibility

**jordannimz** (10): The bassline? Pete Nappi went OFF. And the rest of the song is of course such a groove and makes me feel powerful.

**nicol(y)as(s)** (10): oh shes taking it

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): not boyshit! so true ms. beer. anyways why IS there a parental advisory sticker thingy on the album? it doesn't need it

**runaway3212** (10): yass

**shipperondeck** (10): FINALLY A GOOD SONG THANK FUCK

**Stryxen** (10): your boyish reassurance is not reassuring and i need it and all of my devotion turns violent if you go to her don‚Äôt expect to come home to me to meeee i can‚Äôt get you off my mind i can‚Äôt get you off in general so here we are we‚Äôre just two losers i want you and you want something more beautiful lack of inhibition works wonders in revealing every demon and all this confrontation this suffering what do you want from me? If you don‚Äôt like how i look then LEAAAAVEEEe i can‚Äôt get you off my mind you can‚Äôt get yours off the hostess watched her lips reserving tables as my ugly mouth kept running love me. LOVE MEEEEEEEE!!!!!!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): god this is such a bop and my final 11 contender. also the song that got me interested in life support!

**welcome2thejam** (10): I am the personification of the Garfield "wonder who that's for" meme right now

**akanewasright** (9.5): still haunted by the time when I went to go pick my sister up from work with this song on and she just looked at what was playing and went ‚ÄúMadison Beer? Really?‚Äù

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): I feel like Madison would have probably bullied me in high school, idk she gives me that vibe. Still a fun song though!

**sunsetspt1** (9.5): Great pop song that just doesn't fit Madison

**1998tweety** (9): mega bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): cuz why not!

**skargardin** (9): finally some good food

**thegolding** (9): She really said men's rights. Men's rights to shut the fuck up.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): yass misandry

**vayyiqra** (9): Again this album is like "Ava but not corny and awful and her edgy-girl persona doesn't feel as much of a put-on". Anyway I love pretty much any song with a shuffle beat so.

**ricki** (8.9): ignore my score when you see me throwing a tantrum if this beats all the time

**starla\_** (8.9): a fun catchy bop

**LesApfels** (8.5): She saved all her energy for this one song

**TiltControls** (8.5): Popheads whenever a rate has both men and women in it

**bulforster** (8.3): yass!

**afs** (8): speak no evil found dead in a ditch

**celladonn** (8): Don't love the lyrics but it is a bop

## Probably Speaking BOYSHIT üôÑ

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): verses are a 10 but the chorus is like, a 6

**SmileAndTears** (7.7): it's giving a little

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Okay is it just me or does she sound exactly like Sabrina Carpenter on this track? Like I know Sabrina isn‚Äôt the most musically distinct artist out there but I‚Äôve listened to her *Singular* albums a lot and the similarities in their voices and delivery is really uncanny.

**mayaSS üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë©üòúüë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë©** (7): fun

**oscarbrierley1** (7): very fun, also relatable because I also don't understand what boys (including myself) mean.

**Uberpigeon** (7): whys this kinda good

**nlh1013** (6.5): this one was a grower. I‚Äôm not a fan of the play on words on this one vs stay numb and carry on. Idk why my brain works the way it does lol

**pig-serpent** (6.5): This is the most Zara Larsson Madison Beer song in this rate. It‚Äôs better than a lot of bad Madison Beer songs but it doesn‚Äôt really live up to Zara‚Äôs stuff.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): generic

**indie\_fan\_** (2): I‚Äôve heard this way too often in ads to give this a positive score.

**Roxieloxie** (1): me when im a boy and i shit

## These two ballots came in consecutively i laughed a bit when that happened

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this was the song you guys were gagging over? hm

**TheQueenOfVultures** (3): This is what you guys kept hyping up?

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (11): And here it is, the very obvious winner and tbh I couldn‚Äôt agree more. This song has been absolutely dominant for essentially the whole rate, at one point even having a full point average lead over second place and even with two 0s and the gap getting a little smaller as the rate went on, nothing was gonna stop this. The vocoder throughout the song is very reminiscent of Doin it Right by Daft Punk, a connection I could never complain about, but Zara‚Äôs vocal performance is just absolutely incredible here, more than anything you can tell she absolutely means every word, ~~unlike some of her other songs in the rate~~. I love the melody, the production is great, it‚Äôs just hook after hook, with both verses being really short, and it‚Äôs just simply amazing, this not making the album will always be a mystery.

**plastichaxan** (10): Okay this kept growing on me after accepting its win it‚Äôs very slay very yass very worthy winner I was just being petty cause it wasn‚Äôt in the album

---

## A11 The Time was just right there

**1998tweety** (11): now why the FUCK wasn't this on the album???? Literally one of the best pop songs I've heard. I wanna walk down the street on a bright sunny day and just jam to this.

**akanewasright** (11): this is one of the best pop songs of the past 5 years and I‚Äôll die defending it

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): , easily her best song and nothing from her discography tops the euphoria I get whenever I listen to this once-of-a-lifetime hit, this could've been easily a smash hit if she actually prompted this (and if her label wasn't a piece of shit too).

**anothertown** (11): thank god this made it here

**apatel27** (11): a bop

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): SLAY! genuinely a massive banger, the production on this song is amazing and the vocoder is a fantastic addition. zara why the FUCK did you not go in this direction for the album

**BaconShoes** (11): this serve‚Ä¶ idk how this didn‚Äôt make it onto the album in most formats. It‚Äôs like a yassified daft punk song

**bulforster** (11): SLAY!!

**cremeebrulee** (11): fuck i forgot how much i love this... she's so ugly for not putting this on the album!!! i'm such a sucker for the repeated vocoder portion, this honestly washes everything else in the rate

**jackisboredtoday** (11): Just immaculate, fromthebreakingofthedaytothemiddleofnightfromthebreakingofthedaytothemiddleofnight

**LesApfels** (11): Excluding this from the album was an act of insanity, homophobia and international terrorism

**lillipup03** (11): Not only my favorite song of this rate, but my favorite song of all time. I don't even know how to describe how much I love it, it's just so perfectly catchy.

**nlh1013** (11): I had to do it

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): The best pop song of 2019. It‚Äôs a perfectly constructed pop song from start to finish.

**oscarbrierley1** (11): a lot of the songs in this rate are camp fun dumb bops. This is genuinely great. The production is great, the vocal performance is great, its catchy. It's a shame it wasnt a big enough hit to make it on the original version of the album.

**ricki** (11): i dont even have a funny comment to make, it's just perfection, insanely catchy insanely fun, always feels as fresh as the first time i heard it

**rotating3Dtext** (11): YEAH RHYTHM GUITAR

**runaway3212** (11): yeah im clich√© so what

**seanderlust** (11): the vocoder vocals in the background scratch the same itch in my brain that a really good beatboxer does

**skargardin** (11): the NERVE of making your best song a one-off single

**skull\_xbones** (11): awesome song!

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): should've outsold main pop girls

**throwaway-7650** (11): drake could never

**vayyiqra** (11): She was wearing that all-purple outfit on the cover of the single to bait me in particular as a Hana stan, and it worked ! (silly joke). This is a really good song though; I love Ilsey Juber as a songwriter and she's really underrated. I found her through Lykke Li and also Mark Ronson who I both love and this song has her sonic thumbprint all over it. Done the rate !!

**welcome2thejam** (11): See, if Poster Girl was like this, maybe she wouldn't have to be a Not So Main Pop Girl

Thedoctordances1940: ## Fromthebreakingofthedaytothemiddleofthenight

**AHSWeeknd** (10): she looks like a Boulet Brother in that black wig

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A little salty y‚Äôall snuck this one in here so she could win while having the worst album but I can‚Äôt deny an immaculate bop.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is going to be the most predictable rate winner ever but i can't be mad, this was my second choice of 11

**fairytalehigh** (10): easily the most competent pop song in this rate, she gets flowers and so many kudos. blessings unto you, zara.

**frogaranaman** (10): how are all these loosies better than the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I will never understand why she insisted on treating one of her best songs (one of the best pop songs of the decade tbh) with such disregard. It‚Äôs okay baby, if Zara won‚Äôt love you, I will.

**hikk** (10): i think this winning will be so ridiculously boring but anything less than a 10 would be lying

**jay duh** (10): yassiana..

**jordannimz** (10): OK WHY WAS THIS NOT ON THE ALBUM??? One of her best songs by a long shot. This is a scream-along-in-the-shower-while-making-your-own-choreography song.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): genuinely unbelievable that this didn't make the final cut but is better than every song on the album üíÄüíÄ

**nicol(y)as(s)** (10): yass

**pig-serpent** (10): OMG Doin it Right‚Äôs influence!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): :pretendstobeshocked: when this wins

**shipperondeck** (10): implicit peer pressure caused me to rate this higher maybe. i mean it almost lives up to the 11 hype. almost

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): yeah this is winning the rate

**HornyForWater** (9.7): should have been on the album

**emayzee** (9.6): here's how this can still go #1

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): fromthebreakingofthedaytothemiddleofnight, this song is dancing in my mind

**afs** (9): has an album reject ever won a rate before?

**celladonn** (9): yall have overhyped this song too much but I can't deny the boppage

**CrimsonROSET** (9): good luck on all stars!

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the vocoder is a little annoying but it does slap

**jasannn** (9): might be a little too popheads-core for its own good

**MassiveThief** (9): I'm really tired of listening to Zara after doing this rate but I can still recognize greatness. The vocoder voice beat is amazing.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i could take the free 11 win because i like this about equal as SBP but that one is more camp which i think fits the rate more

**jexan13** (8.5): I expected more from the hype in the initial thread

**starla\_** (8.5): the best song not on the album

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): this is a great song but not even her best in the rate!! why the f wasn't it on the album though like there's so many bad songs and this would have improved it greatly. apologies in advance to that user who was campaigning for this song to have a perfect 10 score.

**TiltControls** (8.5): I can't believe her second best song in the rate isn't even on her album

**DirtyRat583** (8.4): wait this is a bop

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is nice! not like a rate winner to me but i wont be mad if it does this is like good

**flavasavavandal** (8): ugh I guess this is pretty good

**Uberpigeon** (8): ok she got a good one finally

## All the Time

**indie\_fan\_** (7.6): Have I heard this kinda thing a hundred times before? Yes. Do I still enjoy it regardless? Also yes.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Not quite onboard with the hype but it's not awful. Idk I guess I can just deal with her in Winners 3

**SmileAndTears** (7): it's good but its very h&mcore coded (derogatory) and I really hope this doesn't win

**2dina3dworld** (6): this reminds me of Dancing on My Own. I don‚Äôt like Dancing on My Own.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): eurovision macedonia is wondering why this song isn't bigger.

## I try to forget about you

**Roxieloxie** (1): me when i'm slay

**Hulnia** (0): i really don‚Äôt get the acclaim this song gets. the hook is one of the weakest in the whole rate, and the vocoder bit is one of the most annoying things i‚Äôve heard on any song. the verses aren‚Äôt as bad, but they‚Äôre still not great and are completely forgettable. her actual vocals are pretty good (as they are throughout the whole album), but i don‚Äôt think anything could save this mess for me.

**sage** (0): literally have no idea what people hear in this its genuinely such a nothing song which is worse than being outwardly bad

## You got away this time u/ImADudeDuh ‚Ä¶ 

**ImADudeDuh** (11): if this song doesn‚Äôt win i am going to spontaneously burst into flames, which will in fact make the news and inspire several independent investigations and podcasts trying to dissect what happened to me. But they will never find the answer,leaving my death as one of the most mysterious occurrences in the history of the planet. My family will never have closure, my friends will be left uncomfortable every time I‚Äôm mentioned, and the world will never know the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhat caused u/ImADudeDuh to burst into flames?‚Äù The answer is All The Time did not win this rate.

thedoctordances1940: Yeah this is my least favourite of the albums and it‚Äôs definitely carried by the bonus tracks and tracks not on the album but it‚Äôs not a bad album. It has the most songs that just seem to go nowhere hear and I think with how many songs she lost very early on, most people would agree with that, but it does also have quite a lot of bops and songs I really like. And then there‚Äôs obviously All The Time.

plastichaxan: I‚Äôve seen a lot of praise about this album being her second/third so the most competent but it was genuinely not my favorite, it has slays of course but I found it the more inconsistent/the one with more midaf songs. Still I really liked it don‚Äôt get me wrong.

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**sunsetspt1** (9.000): I was in Zara's 0.001% of 2021 (unashamedly!) and I was surprised to see how little attention this release got. All 16 tracks (plus the two Target bonus tracks Famous & When I'm Not Around) work for me, some more than others. I saw someone say a while ago that if Dua Lipa released half of these songs, they would be hits - and I agree. I find these songs to have a ton of personality, despite Zara's involvement being smaller than the other two albums in this rate.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.500): Oh I get it, she‚Äôs the girl on the poster behind her!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.288): a genuinely solid album, with some admittedly forgettable songs, but it was enjoyable!

**vayyiqra** (7.938): For a long time my feelings on Zara were roughly "oh it's a meme that she hates men? Well I guess the feeling is mutual, because her music really sucks" and the only song by her I liked was "Lush Life" and "Symphony" also I guess. Now with this album she's redeemed herself a lot by making much better music and also being much less cringe overall. I can honestly say I liked this album; it's so much better than her boring debut and it may not be the most inventive album ever but it's enjoyable. The team that worked on this is also kind of stacked: Max Martin, Noonie Bao, Mark Stent (?!). Scandinavians rarely miss with pop.

**pig-serpent** (7.781): A very conventional album, but Zara Larsson is a phenomenal singer and the basslines on here are swanky as hell

**afs** (7.719): the ONLY non American flop, we stan Rest of the World representation

**DirtyRat583** (7.513): after lush life, she kinda vanished and I always wondered why. this answers that question

**jexan13** (7.500): Kinda unremarkable

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.313): she's going to make the album of the century once she starts enjoying bowling I believe in her

**fairytalehigh** (7.294): as a drunk robyn stan i'm realizing that miss larsson might end up higher than ava, whose album i actually prefer in this rate, but i'm at peace with that. the 8-9's must flow

**oscarbrierley1** (7.188): the fast songs are bops, the slow songs are a bit boring. This is a bit weird because I like the slow songs on her old albums. The only album in the rate without a song that I actively hate.

**ricki** (7.175): mother

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.156): Zara Larsson is an interesting artist for how uninteresting she is, she actually seems like a person with a strong personality and a good sense of humor but none of that comes across in her actual music. She‚Äôs a good pop artist so she succeeds when she has the material to back her up but the lack of flavor to her music means that when she isn‚Äôt operating at 100% then there‚Äôs nothing really there (as opposed to the other artists in this rate, who are interesting even in their failures). There‚Äôs a difference between being polished and being sterile and she often falls on the wrong side of that line, which ends up being the chief failure of *Poster Girl*: it‚Äôs a pleasant listen, but not a lot of it sticks with me. Should have put ‚ÄúAll The Time‚Äù on the track list üòî

**jackisboredtoday** (7.150): An album that benefits in my scores from not having too much tank-worthy material compared to the other two, but which is definitely less than the sum of its parts when a large quantity of mediocrity fills up space

**Vromega** (7.000): Quite dissapointed by this album that I expected a lot ! I absolutely loved the first singles and was so excited to hear the whole album. Unfortunately for me it failed to deliver, most of the songs being very far from the quality of the singles.

Thedoctordances1940: **nlh1013** (6.906): this was the only album of the three that I had actually listened to before this rate. I think I like life support better but this one does have some bangers. I guess it depends on my mood

**jasannn** (6.906): this album feels like it‚Äôs stuck in the early 2010‚Äôs but it reminds of some great kpop albums so i cant hate it too much

**anothertown** (6.906): really forgot how bad this was

**TiltControls** (6.875): There's potential here, but a lot of the songs just needed an extra push of charisma to go from good to great

**welcome2thejam** (6.813): Zara's perfectly fine, bigger issue is the production unfortunately kneecaps her way too often with uninteresting choices or just sounding ugly. Luckily, the bonus tracks pull a massive carry job; shame they blow so much of the actual album out of the water

**jordannimz** (6.813): Oh, what an inconsistent album (plus associated droplet tracks). Some of the songs are just incredible but there are way too many songs that should have been left off the album. Where was the quality control??? We know you have it in you, Zara!!

**skargardin** (6.500): It's a step up from So Good, although that's not saying much really. The highlights are the bops, and the downtempo ballads I really could not care less for. I think Zara has it in her to create a truly strong album in the future though.

**fadedblue09** (6.406): Decent effort overall. It's nowhere as consistent as Ava's and unfortunately, half of the tracklist is held back by dated production choices. Still, the highlights are memorable enough to be given some spins. Among the three, I'm not sure what niche can she carve from out of this, but I wish her good luck

**cremeebrulee** (6.175): zara is really excellent at making albums that have precisely one (1) song that i loop like 80 times and nothing else

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.125): it‚Äôs kinda wild how wildly inconsistent this album is throughout its tracklist‚Ä¶how shes able to go between generic dollar store pop to genuinely amazing songs is a talent not many can pull off

**avg-vag** (6.094): 5.8 the experience of this album was painful. it's like listening to the shadow of a pop hit that's been generated by artificial intelligence in the learning process. most of the lyrics read like google-translated packaging from something ordered on wish and the production could be unused stock from love island muzak, but the hooks are incredibly catchy. i had originally rated that majority of the songs sub-five until i realized they kept crawling their way into my subconscious. the disappointment that the best song of the rate is grouped with this terrible album is exactly why zara larsson's failure to consistently reach her potential is so aggravating as a pophead.

**starla\_** (5.825): This is definitely the worst set of songs on the rate. I loved her album 'So Good' but there is no 'Lush Life' or 'Only You' on this album, only boring midtempo songs, and the best song on the album isn't even on the album.

**2dina3dworld** (5.719): there‚Äôs a phenomenon in the sims community called ‚Äúsame face syndrome‚Äù where all of the sims you make yourself end up looking the same because you just want something conventionally pretty and easy to style. This album feels like an album made up of same face syndrome - like all the songs sound ripped from the same template. It got boring pretty quickly

**apatel27** (5.625): It's just so empty

**SmileAndTears** (5.581): Ugh. Zara, girl, let's talk. WHat is this? Why did you put this out? I'm sorry, i don't know how to put this kindly, but this is garbage. She tried to chase every trend in pop and ended up with a generic, grating collection of ariana grande and dua lipa rejects.

**indie\_fan\_** (5.256): Take my comment for the Ava Max album, but remove the ‚Äúenjoyable for what it tries to be‚Äù part.

**hikk** (5.125): wow this album kinda sucks and she should be grateful that the hosts decided to do charity work and include the songs she foolishly excluded

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.125): yeah i'm not a fan of this, pretty much all of it is super generic songs with mediocre production. the two cut singles are ironically WAY better than anything on the actual album and i find it astounding that they were cut from the album

**MassiveThief** (5.094): the regular edition is painful. generic beats and lyrics, the only thing that sticks out is her voice and NOT in a good way. bonus songs are awesome, even if they're pretty blatantly "taking inspiration" from other big hits.

**flavasavavandal** (5.031): I‚Äôd tell Zara give her songs room to breathe but I‚Äôm afraid her label didn‚Äôt give her enough studio time for that considering the track lengths and how rushed this sounds

**frogaranaman** (4.438): I'm in Europe while doing this ballot so this album makes more sense

**notsomainpoplietoc** (4.394): "Zara is a big big big singer. She deserves to be one of the world‚Äôs best if not THE BEST but her label ruined her, controlled her and made her underrated." I usually believe someone if they put 2 or 4 bigs in their youtube comment, but 3? industry plant! Anyways tho "It is necessary to admit it that we already feel the improvement between So Good and Poster Girl."

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**AHSWeeknd** (9.188): I enjoy pop music

**DirtyRat583** (8.800): can u guess what continent i am from

**jexan13** (8.781): Such a good, fun album. It's no masterpiece, but it never pretended such. No bland songs, just bops. Also, funny she's compared to Gaga when is this so many times better than Chromatica

**SmileAndTears** (8.781): My enjoyment of Ava Max's music has always been kind of semi-ironic. Like, the music is decent, and if it were anyone else I probably wouldn't care, but sis is always trying way too fucking hard, always giving her 110%, even when she doesn't need to, and i just can't not love her because of that. And then there's the interviews where she just tells lies after lies, whether it's about her hair or drinking coke, or loving Elton John. And then the memes? Miss Max falling into a lava pit during a roblox concert? her songs dismantling a far right party in some european country? 'Bird!'? Ava Max is the gift that keeps on giving

**sunsetspt1** (8.031): I didn't give this one much of a chance until last summer, but it was my most streamed album for months. Sleekest production of the three albums here, but I could've used more variety. Slow start and loses steam toward the end but the string of songs from Tattoo through Who's Laughing Now are a lot of fun

**jasannn** (7.844): I originally put her off as basic radio filler but wow this album really doesn‚Äôt have any skips. I love the fully fleshed out melodies and the lively productions. My only complaint is it needs better lyrics but at least they don‚Äôt feel clunky or too cringy.

**hikk** (7.813): there's a few mediocre songs but i've always felt that ava is overhated and this album is actually pretty good! out of all the faceless dancepop out there ava really gives it her all and her producers are great

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.813): We were so harsh on this album when it came out, and for what? This is exactly what we should have expected from Ava Max, for better or for worse. As the title implies, this album has some incredible highs and some pitiful lows but a lot of it just kinda falls into the middle‚Ä¶ but when Ava gets it, boy does she soar. Also I think it‚Äôs time that I confess that I think the cover of this album is really pretty, I never understood the hate.

**afs** (7.781): you will never be cocteau twins

**jordannimz** (7.563): You could say this album is like Heaven & Hell ‚Äî the highs are very high and the lows are... well So Am I is on this album. Overall though, the highs won out and I do love this album amidst its flaws. Filled with some amazing dance pop.

**anothertown** (7.406): i fully support ms. pad. I appreciate that she wanted to do a concept with her first album out. However, I think 2 filler tracks could be cut from each half of this album and we would all benefit from it

**MToms** (7.381): I actually haven't heard any of these albums before, so I'm going in blind apart from some singles. Her music sounds fine but doesn't really stand out to me, it's generic and sounds like she tried to replicate Future Nostalgia. Same goes for her, it would be hard to pick her out or distinguish her on the radio/party/playlist. If you listen to these songs separately from each other, any of them could be a single, but once the are together they blend too much and become tiring.

**fadedblue09** (7.188): This album is really Euro-coded. Very dance-driven, club-friendly etc. But what really surprised me is Ava's voice, the girl can actually sing, which we don't see a lot nowadays. The dancepop formula does wear thin in the back half and I wished she switched up a bit because there's definitely room for it.I don't know how her career can proceed from here, but there's definitely a niche for her.

**babadork** (6.869): Of the three, this is the album I have listened to the most. It is good for when you are in the mood to listen to some upbeat pop music and pretend it‚Äôs still the early 2010s.
[/r/popheads/comments/wcq127/notso_main_pop_girls_rate_reveal_day_3_my_head_my/iiengsp/]

=====

Thedoctordances1940: **skargardin** (6.750): She really proved with this album that she has a knack for creating earworm-y melodies and smashing the formulaic pop formula. There are several dips in quality, the songwriting is pretty.. questionable at times and the production does a lot of the heavy lifting, but it doesn't detract from this being a fun listen.

**starla\_** (6.731): This is a decent pop album with a couple of bangers, a few cute bops, and one of the worst songs I have ever heard. Exactly what I expected from miss Ava.

**apatel27** (6.594): Concept doesn't work but some songs are good

**indie\_fan\_** (6.575): ‚ÄúGeneric, but enjoyable enough for what it tries to be‚Äù is the best way I can describe this album. This album feels like it mostly belongs in the early 2010‚Äôs. Also, I will never get over the fact that she thoupeople were going to compare her to Mariah Carey-

**MassiveThief** (6.563): The only album in this rate that has me wanting to hear more. There are absolutely duds, but plenty of great songs that make me excited for her future. She yassed, and BOY did she slay.

**welcome2thejam** (6.500): When you're a not a standout performer, you better have the strong songs to keep you afloat. And this thankfully does have a few heavy hitters, and only one outright disliked track, but also a lot I'll have forgotten by this time tomorrow

**avg-vag** (6.188): 5.8 this album wastes all of it's potential trying to convince the listener that it is more than it is. the hooks and sampling of peak pop monuments are wasted by meandering verses that skip through a chasm of nothing. ava's singing shouts at you at a frequency you can forget there's even vocals on the track. even at it's best you get caught up by a wave of a chorus and realize it never crashed you to shore. start to finish, the consistency of this album could soundtrack a dancefloor but it lacks any dizzying heights to get lost in.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.156): out of all the albums here this one's the best but it's still kinda mid. some bangers though

**TiltControls** (6.125): Biggest peaks and biggest drops. Ended up with my lowest average but is probably the album I think of most fondly of too

**pig-serpent** (5.938): Like the album title implies, half the album is good and half of it is bad.

**fairytalehigh** (5.919): pitchfork described sigrid's last album as "gay club filler music" and i think it's a more apt label for ava. that's not even an insult, she crushes it! (mostly)

**oscarbrierley1** (5.813): the majority of this album feels really soulless and formulaic. Its mostly good choruses, but cringy lyrics and forgettable production, so I only love a couple of tracks.

**LesApfels** (5.656): What hurts the most about this album being such a mixed bag is songs like Born to the Night and Belladonna actually fit the heaven and hell concept sonically, so she could have pulled it off and just gave up halfway

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.625): more like sample hell

**nlh1013** (5.000): I just unfortunately did not enjoy this album. I used to think I liked Ava max‚Äôs music but the more I listened to this, I realized that I really only like the singles bc they get overplayed and I think there is some kind voodoo lol. Except for two songs! I truly love freaking me out and maybe you‚Äôre the problem. But sadly neither are in this rate

**RandomHypnotica** (4.913): how does ava manage to do one thing on almost every song that makes it horrible

**cremeebrulee** (4.869): ph roots for ava sm and it's a little hard to watch when this is the material

**notsomainpoplietoc** (4.700): "She is one of these celebrities who is sucessfull but still not stuck up, really sympathetic and funny..." "I hope she will release a deluxe edition of this album that will include all of her pre singles and my head and my heart. I'm pretty sure this will be one of the most streamed female album on Spotify." ava max fans are considerate warriors; heaven and hell is a borderline cohesive release worth fighting for.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.625): i had already disliked ava max long before this rate started and i was going into this trying to be nice and hopefully be surprised but man this album is Not Good. when its not being mind meltingly generic it ranges from barely passable to flat out terrible and the few tracks on here i actually enjoyed are nowhere near the heights of the good tracks on the other two albums. also this album cover is hideous lmao

**frogaranaman** (4.125): I want to die

**vayyiqra** (4.000): A "just okay at best" mashup album of 2010s (or even late 2000s) electropop with some well-known melodies from older pop hits, and no real personality of its own, but a lot of tryhard lyrics; this is a weird album. It's in the uncanny valley of pop music, where bland but sincere electropop meets the most corny almost-covers you have ever heard. What a strange album. The memeing about it almost makes me want to like it, but then there is the insurmountable problem that this album also sucks. When rockheads complain about pop music sounding soulless and like it was made by an AI, this album is what they are thinking of. And on this one (1) album at least, they have a point I fear.

**2dina3dworld** (3.625): this album is like a flavourless Future Nostalgia, which is impressive considering how flavourless Future Nostalgia is. There‚Äôs nothing original here, just bland sampling and gay club transition music

thedoctordances1940: Life Support is an album that still has quite a few duds and tracks that could definitely be better, but it shows a lot of potential.

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**AHSWeeknd** (10.059): This is actual pop music, it‚Äôs more than ‚Äúbops‚Äù and ‚Äúcool beats‚Äù it‚Äôs innovative and presents theatricality. And this album is pain, the definition of PAIN. Madison‚Äôs lyrics/concepts with Leroy Clampitt‚Äôs production makes for a beautiful experience. It captures a rollercoaster of emotions throughout it, feeling hopeful then down based off let-downs. I also love the fact that this album takes the listener through a journey, with Emotional Bruises as the climax. Really not something I would‚Äôve expected from Madison Beer, but it just goes to show you can be both gorgeous and a genius at the same time. No skips, a whole underrated masterpiece.

**jexan13** (8.765): I discarded this girl because people said she was an "Ariana Grande" clone... girl, the worst song on Life Support is better than anything on the mess that was Polutions.

**jordannimz** (8.471): This was my second-favourite album of 2021. Madison's vocals are beautiful in every song and the harmonies are basically as close to angels as we could get. I love the retro vibes mixed with some hard-hitting modern production and we HAVE to give Madison credit for co-producing every track other than BOYSHIT and executive producing the album.

**avg-vag** (8.324): 8.3 madison beer might be one of the few artists that can actually pull off the faux-deep, tortured tone of this album in a way that feels terrifyingly genuine. she was raised in this popstar incubator with the expectation she'll catapult into the charts at any moment but was so altered in the process that she delivers this sad, aching look into the shell of an instagram filter that is so cohesive she ironically didn't leave herself room for a bonafide hit. she could have easily turned many of these songs into generic pop formulas - the closest being boyshit, good in goodbye or baby - but they all have this eerie production coated in the sense of a fake smile that is perhaps too uncomfortable to be marketable. that is sad art pop.

**anothertown** (8.147): No features. No Swedish Songwriters. No Trap Beats. 100% Pure Uncut Rock.

**sunsetspt1** (7.412): I think this could've been a great (rather than good) album if Madison's mission were clearer. You can tell that a lot of these lyrics sacrifice creativity for digestibility (surface level wit in place of thoughtfulness), but yet the album can't make up it's mind whether it wants to be full-fledged pop or more indie. The problem is I don't know if Madison would rather be the it-girl or the beloved artist, and through this indecisiveness she achieves neither. I'm always rooting for her and have faith in her next release, but I would be lying if I said I listen to the bulk of these tracks often.

**Vromega** (7.353): Overall a very very solid debut album ! She works well on her voice, her range, even if I regret that this album feels a bit too "industrial", with a lot of post production, distortion, sound effects,... Her talent and gorgeous voice do not need that much production ! Anyway she creates a very welcoming universe that I enjoyed exploring. Her fave themes and the lyrics are very common and sometimes she lacks originality. She doesn't have her own identity yet but it's ok, she has the talent and time to grow. I also had the luck to go to the life support tour and it was an awesome show.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.347): this album was shockingly ballad heavy, it really could've benefited from some more tracks like Boyshit, because they really started to blur together at a point

**starla\_** (7.329): This was actually better than I expected. It has some interesting production and sound textures and Madison's voice is beautiful. I don't know why pop albums have to have so! many! songs! on them, there were definitely some filler tracks.

**babadork** (7.324): This is my favorite of the three albums in this rate. The production and instrumentation are amazing. While some of the songs can be a bit derivative, she sounds so great that it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

**SmileAndTears** (7.282): I will give credit where it's due and even if i don't loooove this album it's at least interesting. sometimes.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.206): Based off of what I knew about Madison Beer before this album (mainly that she was the Monster High girl) I did not expect her debut album to sound like this, which is kind of a double edged sword. On the one hand I respect that she had a vision and ambitions beyond just being another yasscore pop girlie, but at the same time there‚Äôs something to be said for giving the people what they want. She punches above her weight class with this album and it only sometimes succeeds, but I think if she takes some time to iron out her sound (surprisingly the more blues/country leaning tracks were the standouts here) then she‚Äôs got a great sophomore album in her.

**afs** (7.176): honestly I should've tanked this more

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.176): pop off queenvelynn

**indie\_fan\_** (7.141): This album has either really solid tracks or bad tracks, there‚Äôs no in between. Even so, this still isn‚Äôt bad at all for a debut album.

=====

Thedoctordances1940: **2dina3dworld** (6.971): I have chosen Madison as my main flop girl to champion. This album is a bit amateur at times but it shows a lot of unrealised potential and I‚Äôm rooting for Madison to realise that!

**TiltControls** (6.971): On average stronger than the other two, but also doesn't match their peaks

**welcome2thejam** (6.941): Only album I knew previously, and big improvement over my only listen. She takes a couple of fun and unexpected swings and I enjoyed it a lot more because of that. Interested in seeing where her music career takes her.

**fadedblue09** (6.912): Not my favorite album here, but probably the most intriguing. There are some dark, left-field elements that caught my attention but ultimately I don't think she fully realized her ideas due to the inconsistent writing. I do think there's potential for her to reinvent herself as some sort of Tumblrcore fave (or whatever the equivalent is nowadays).

**skargardin** (6.647): I get what she was going for with the emotional tone of this album, but most of it doesn't really resonate with me at all, unfortunately. She has some great vocals though that must be said.

**MToms** (6.471): Unfortunately I didn't like this album as much as I wanted to. Her voice is my favorite of the three, and I feel like this album is more memorable and has a clearer message/identity than Ava's, but maybe I don't enjoy it as much because many of the songs are slower. The slow sad songs especially seem to mesh together and are hard to distinguish from each other. The album also feels somewhat unfinished, as some songs are too short and others repeat the same phrases over and over instead of innovating with verses.

**DirtyRat583** (6.424): im sure some of you are happy with this album but that is not me

**cremeebrulee** (6.312): madison can write some pretty good songs when she isn't cosplaying like 6 other pop girls

**vayyiqra** (6.294): "What If Ava Max Wasn't Awful: The Album". Way less cringe, much less immature (despite Madison being way younger), a lot of cool production elements (strong late 90s and early 2000s sounds), better songwriting. Also that she was a member of K/DA who I love and has BPD like me helps a bit. I liked this more than I remembered; it's pretty solid.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.265): this album is attempting to be too serious. It has too many similar interludes.

**hikk** (6.000): i think there's some pretty cool ideas on some tracks here but it gets a little bogged down by mid/generic moments. i hope she experiments a little more on the next album cuz there's glimmers of an alt pop queen here

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5.894): "Omg is there an audio cd I need this album now to blast in my car"

**nlh1013** (5.882): I saw this one on popheads all the time and tried listening to it like last summer but I guess I wasn‚Äôt really in the headspace for it. Anyway after sitting with it I actually really, really enjoyed it. I hate when it takes me so long! Same thing happened with future nostalgia

**fairytalehigh** (5.882): there is a really good album to be made by miss madison beer, and this ain't it. she talks about heavy topics, she has the range, but she's hamstrung by mimicking her contemporaries: ariana, lana, billie, kacey. she's going to go down the tiktok road, i fear, but as far as statements are concerned, i hope she has it in her.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.824): she has a really nice voice but unfortunately i feel like madison isn‚Äôt really making the right music to compliment it most of the time. i think she could pull off a more rock influenced album really well like on boyshit or follow the white rabbit and i dont think its a coincidence those ended up being my favorite tracks.

**LesApfels** (5.559): It's kinda crazy how many tracks on this album feel like interludes

**pig-serpent** (5.029): Much like the first Bioshock game, this album is at its best when it's spooky but spends most of its runtime forgetting this simple fact. I can see what the rest of the album is trying to do but little of it comes together for me.

**Awkward\_King** (4.618): this album was apparently not for me

**MassiveThief** (4.618): I did not like this at all. She's clearly trying to do different/quirky stuff but it never pans out, and on other songs she's just imitating other singers. Lyrics are generally painful as well.

**frogaranaman** (4.412): this production is so lifeless

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4.294): this album has incredibly weak writing and the depth of a kiddie pool

**apatel27** (4.294): How can she make an Pop/R&B album this boring

TiltControls: Sorry this is late! Bit of a delay due to flying home today, but the stats that have been up-and-coming for 8 hours now are finally here!! I only caught day 1 (and I'll catch up on the other days after this), but fantastic job Marmite and Poppy with the reveal and hosting!

## Songs

Congratulations for the ~~definitely not unexpected~~ win for **All The Time**. All The Time takes **298th** highest average 
overall across all songs. It ties Dua Lipa's Physical, sits right below Bad Bunny's Yo Perreo Sola and right above Coldplay's Clocks.

* **All The Time** takes a top 10 record for the 9th most 11s given to a song in a rate! 

* Ava Max's **So Am I** also becomes a record holder today by becoming the song with the 15th highest controversy ever rated! Just know if you ever feel like a misfit, Ava feels the same.

## Artists

Placements for the artist averages are out of **322 artists**. Zara Larsson has a previous ranking and while Ava and Madison are new, each of them has previous scores affecting their ranking (Sweet But Psycho for Ava and VILLAIN and POP/STARS for Madison)

-

* 267th: Iggy Azalea (6.947)
* **268th: Madison Beer (6.936) [NEW]**
* 268th: Drake (6.936)
* 270th	: Ashley Tisdale (6.911)

-

* 281st: B.o.B. (6.829)
* **282nd: Zara Larsson (6.826) [PREV. 261st]**
* 283rd: Travis Scott (6.822)

-

* 286th: BTS (6.791)
* **287th: Ava Max (6.781) [NEW]**
* 287th: Nelly (6.781)
* 289th: BLACKPINK / The Neighbourhood (6.770)

-

## Albums

It's time for the girls to break out from bubbling under and onto the charts! The lowest albums averages chart that is! All 3 albums in the rate made it onto the lowest 25 album averages list (which doesn't include extra songs outside the album, sorry Zara!). 

* **Life Support** takes the spot for 23rd lowest, and **Heaven & Hell** is right behind with the 22nd lowest. However, Zara keeps winning(?) today and **Poster Girl** takes a top 10 spot for 6th lowest album average on Popheads rates. They knock Bionic, Glory, and A Fever You Can't Sweat Out off the list.

* **Heaven & Hell** also manages to sneak on the most controversial albums list in 10th place. It also just missed a spot on the % of 0's given to the album leaderboard and sits in 11th place there with 29.2% of the raters giving the album their coveted 0.



## Rates

* Not-so-main Pop Girls lands in **6th for lowest rate averages** across all rates. It bumps the Meme Rate off the leaderboard
