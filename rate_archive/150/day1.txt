Welcome to the first day of the most yass _and_ most slay reveal popheads rates have ever seen! Since the beginning of June, the raters of r/popheads have attempted to settle the most important question regarding our favourite flop girls, who’s songs are the most yass and slay? Well today we’ll be finding out (or at least partially)! Starting at **3PM EST** (in about an hour from when this post goes up) we’ll be going through the first 17 eliminations of the Not-So Main Pop Girls Rate, all the way from **49th** up to **33rd**, as well as sending the first two titles from the bonus rate (where we rated all the names this rate has gone by) home. Come and join us on [Queup](https://www.queup.net/join/yassandslay) to see the eliminations be revealed live, and keep an eye on this post to get an overview of all the eliminations as well as all their averages and the comments!

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (6): Yeah this isn’t great I was a bit shocked it was first out but anything that kept So Am I out of the bottom 1 I was glad with dsfjks

**thedoctordances1940** (0): Yeah this is the worst song in the rate for me by far, the beat is terrible, I don’t want to ever hear Zara say I don’t give no fucks again, the melodies go nowhere, the chorus is annoying, overall I’m just so happy this went out first, it’s the most nothing song in the rate.

---


## Give no fucks

**fairytalehigh** (9): pride month means having serenity about one night stands

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The women in this rate used the phrase “concept album” VERY liberally but I do appreciate that there was some thought taken into how this album would open and close; during “Love Me Land” we watch her fall into the ecstasy of a new crush, and by the time she’s reached the end of the album she’s learned to stop obsessing over the details and has decided that whatever happens will happen. It’s a cute little thematic arc.

**pig-serpent** (8): I’m surprised by how much I like this one.

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): it took her the entire base album but she got greatness, then she started playing Boppitt with the guy

**AHSWeeknd** (7): When you’re too horny to think about consequences

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is fine

**jay duh** (7): hmmmm i give no FUCKS ????????

**jexan13** (7): the trauma still remains after the album ended

**Stryxen** (7): her i know the end wow

**vayyiqra** (7): The album could've ended here but then we wouldn't have All the Time in the rate, so.

**afs** (6.5): omg whats happening

**BaconShoes** (6): flop compared to the rest of the album, but not bad

**CrimsonROSET** (6): no you don’t understand i REALLY don’t care about this like i could tell you all day just how much i don’t care

## Lucky Zara gives no fucks

**bulforster** (5.6): hmm

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): this sounds like a cut track from Dangerous Woman in a very bad way

**shipperondeck** (5.2): er.. alright thanks i guess

**1998tweety** (5): MEH

**anothertown** (5): this is a bebe rexha song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): ????? i genuinely don’t even know how to rate this one what’s even happening

**akanewasright** (4): this is just so bland… she got the Ariana TUN team and they gave her nothing

**SmileAndTears** (4): THIS is how the regular version of the album ends??? oh lorde

**Roxieloxie** (3.8): me when i come back on to a rate reveal

**fadedblue09** (3): clunky and sticks out in a bad way from the rest of the album

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is very close to being a blackpink song (bad)

**jordannimz** (3): Yeah this was a bad choice for a closer (for the standard edition of the album). Also I removed half a point for that "even if I" post-chorus. Yikes.

**nicol(y)as(s)** (3): these traps beats are not it someone let her know that

**skargardin** (3): She really ended the standard album with this boring ass song

**notsomainpoplietoc** (2.4): "There is simply no storyline to the record"

**DaHumanTorch** (2): maybe ronniesus had a point

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): maybe you should give a f*ck cuz this song is not good

**sweetnsoursauce11** (1.5): literally what is this chorus damn the first half of this album is SO much better

**apatel27** (1): Sung with the sass of a preppy child trying to act hard

**Awkward\_King** (1): i dont know zara

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): god i hate this type of trap-pop, it just feels like trend-chasing and it barely ever works well. this sort of sound does not fit zara at all and it just sounds tacky and uncomfortable

**frogaranaman** (1): I am so deeply uninterested in this as an album closer

**hikk** (1): if there's one thing this album does consistently it's the flip-flopping between mediocre trap-pop song and mediocre nudisco song and at this point im just tired

**Saison\_Marguerite** (1): Zara did it… she produced a song so mediocre that it broke me. This sounds like it was rejected from that Bebe Rexha EP every rater dunked on in 2018, and then not even Blackpink or Fifth Harmony would touch it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): The production on this is just doing whatever it wants. I think there’s some gang vocals buried in the mix somewhere? Whatever it’s doing it’s very annoying.

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): Ah, our controversial song, well, most controversial, I was glad to see it escape bottom 1 this is actually camp in a way also someone pointed out that the lyrics weren’t so bad maybe because English wasn’t their first language and… It may be my case too

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I am genuinely so happy this avoided last place, there were so many little decisions that contributed to this ending up above What Happens Here, convincing multiple people to raise their score for So Am I just by a little bit long before the final ballots were in and eventually realising that caused So Am I to end up less than one point ahead of What Happens Here but just being relieved it managed it. As for the song itself, yeah idc it’s really fun. Sure it’s just Sweet but Psycho with really cheesy and bad lyrics but a) I love Sweet but Psycho b) the lyrics contribute to making it so great. At this point all I have to say is see you in all-stars!

---

## Misfits and proud!

**Awkward\_King** (11): i dont care I DONT CARE!!!! SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE A MISFIT!! SOMETIMES I FEEL SO DARK AND TWISTED!!!!

**celladonn** (11): I definitely feel like a misfit amongst all these So Am I haters on popheads 😔

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Over/under on how comments are gonna reference that one scene from Riverdale?

**fadedblue09** (10): Miss Ava served us a pride anthem and popheads is paying it dust. You hate to see it8

**frogaranaman** (10): I actually hate this song but I think the idea of increasing its controversy score is so funny to me

**jay duh** (10): Misfit and proud! Why dont we get a month?

**jexan13** (9.5): This is not that bad. Maybe because English is not my first language, but this is a bop from start to finish

**HornyForWater** (9.4): yes I do like this song

**flavasavavandal** (9): a relatable queen

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): early 10s tumblr probably would have eaten this up

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I probably shouldn't like this song. It's incredibly vague and nondescript in its content, and the song is basically just "Im so quirky 🤪 can't go anywhere", but idk I still like it, somehow. Like, I do think there's a place for this kind of song, even if it's just a diet Born This Way (at least this song has passable production and is competently mixed). Like yeah it might be the most aggressively sterile version of a "love yourself" anthem but it's an inoffensive bop and frankly, it doesn't deserve the hate it inevitably will receive in this rate. TLDR: OMG SHE SLAYED SO HARD BOOTS THE HOUSE DOWN YASSSSSS

**MassiveThief** (8): I admit the only reason I enjoy this is because I rarely listened to Sweet But Psycho when it was popular... it really is a blatant attempt to replicate its success

**afs** (7.5): ava max, you will never be stefani germanotta

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): [The ruthless dragging of this song on the /r/popheads Jukebox is one of the feature’s finest moments](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/b3duio/the_popheads_jukebox_week_109_cause_god_makes_no/eiysvk5/) but now that some time has passed I think it’s time to admit that if you ignore the lazy lyrics then this song is actually a pretty cute and catchy little bop.

**Bordersz** (7.2): Smart to mimic Sweet but Psycho, but doesn't hit as hard as the og.

**1998tweety** (7): This will be the first boot but it's...alright

**jasannn** (7): we love weeekly

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): bit weird to put Sweet but Psycho on the same album twice but go off I guess

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): I can’t hate this song, it’s too funny. POV: you’ve just been bullied and popular girl "Amanda Kay" is trying to cheer you up, which is more insulting somehow

**thegolding** (7): Guilty pleasure

## Different but coming to terms with it

**BaconShoes** (6.5): this song is kinda cringe but kinda camp idk

**shipperondeck** (6.5): middle school me would've eaten this song UP

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): stop it, ur not Lady Gaga nor a tampon for her scrapped tracks

**ignitethephoenix** (6): it’s not bad on its own but like it was a terrible follow up to sweet but psycho

**welcome2thejam** (6): This sounds like an Ava Max ripoff song

**indie\_fan\_** (5.5): Corny ass lyrics

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): yassified Holden Caulfield

**starla\_** (5.1): do you ever feel, like a plastic bag

**AHSWeeknd** (5): if it weren’t for that instrumental this’d be a straight zero

**TiltControls** (5): It's not good, but it's also entertaining in a way? I'm conflicted

**anothertown** (4.5): It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

**majid** (4): this is so funny why is this in the hell section of the album

**nicol(y)as(s)** (4): this song makes me wanna bully people

**pig-serpent** (4): Oh I'm Sweet but I'm Psycho, a little bit psycho, and I like to rip-rip-rip my self-elf-elf off.

**rotating3Dtext** (4): she’s so craaazy I love her

## The true dark and twisted 

**seanderlust** (3.5): OK I'm gonna keep this vague to avoid spoilers but iykyk. I just watched the first part of season four of stranger things and there's a character that tells another character they know what it feels like to feel different, as an attempt to empathize with them but in context it's extremely menacing. anyways going straight from that to the same sentiment in a fucking ava max song is extremely funny

**arne** (3): everything inside me is dark and twisted

**lillipup03** (3): I might like this song if it wasn't literally just a copy of Sweet But Psycho…

**astrologicalangel** (2): worse version of Sweet but Psycho in every way

**DaHumanTorch** (2): ava singing how different she is over one of the most generic beats of all time

**ernie** (2): do i need to explain it?

**jordannimz** (2): What's there to say? It's her worst song by a long shot. Now, I don't think it deserves a 0 like I know a lot of people are going to give it, but ...it's not good. I guess this song feels like an outcast, doesn't fit into the album's format of generally good pop music.

**oscarbrierley1** (2): qUirKy girl anthem. The melody and production are fine, but the lyrics are so bad.

**ricki** (2): unironically raising my score for the after school x so am i mashup from the 2021 kpop rate reveal

**throwaway-7650** (2): stream after school by weeekly

**2dina3dworld** (1): she’s so quirky! Can’t take her anywhere!!!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): wait i'm confused, why is sweet but psycho on this album twice?

**cremeebrulee** (1): thinking of the alternate universe where we rated this album in nu-disco

**hikk** (1): ok im definitely #teamava but it was kind of funny when she released this and everyone was just like immediately no. boring ass melodies boring ass production i didn't move

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): "She's not the next Lady Gaga, She is the first Ava Max". gotta appreciate the balls of having this song out over 1.5 years before your album. indie artists are fucken clowning around by not engaging in this decade/era spanning release tactics! anyways her video does not slay, way too much product placement and mid ass prep school shit. it WANTS to be horny but its not.

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): Thinking about the time I met her in late 2018 where she did a private showing of this music video and I had to listen to gays in the room explaining the Pop Girl Prophecy to her manager

**RandomHypnotica** (1): honestly why does the instrumental sound halfway between a christmas and a halloween song

**Roxieloxie** (1): so true

**skargardin** (1): This is the hell Rina was singing about

**static\_int\_husp** (1): this would be an easy 0 if it wasn't so obviously a tossed off follow up to Sweet But Psycho, and I gotta respect the originals claim to the 0.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): I can't relate, I have always fit in and everything inside me is not dark and twised

**vayyiqra** (1): "Do you ever feel like a misfit" I am a 33 year old man who is listening to an Ava Max album at 8:30 in the morning, for a Popheads rate called "yass and slay". Do -you- think I ever feel like a misfit? I do not even think that is a question. Anyway this song: yeah it's really corny and I don't like it. "Like Sid and Nancy" you know what happened to that couple right? That's not a good thing?

**akanewasright** (0): I’ve heard this melody 800 times before and this is the most embarrassing instance of it

**babadork** (0): Sweet but Psycho’s lyrics are also dumb, but the song is catchy, which makes it not matter.

**bulforster** (0): flop!

**CrimsonROSET** (0): the vindication when i called this harley quinn-core and found an amv of harley x joker to this….

**fairytalehigh** (0): it challenged me as a listener

**ImADudeDuh** (0): thinking about the r/music thread that dragged this almost as hard as r/popheads did when it came out

**jackisboredtoday** (0): this defective Born This Way clone… and I already hate born this way. i was gonna be kinder and say KMart version but that’s more Kelly Clarkson’s People Like Us

**LesApfels** (0): Apparently Charlie Puth is credited under a pseudonym on this song, and I really can't blame him for wanting to pretend it never happened

**runaway3212** (0): to all men relating to this song, you’re not special you’re just gay

**skull\_xbones** (0): really boring

**sweetnsoursauce11** (0): this is my first ever 0 score lmao. not only do i hate this song because it's bad, but i also hate this song bc it ruined ALL the momentum ava had coming off sweet but psycho and it took her 2 fking years till she got it back. imagine if this wasn't the follow-up to sweet but psycho and literally any over song was

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i dont have it in me right now to drag this song the way it deserves so instead im just gonna link the popheads fresh thread for this to do it for me https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ayfjbz/ava_max_so_am_i_official_music_video/

Your skin makes me cry 

You float like a feather 

In a beautiful world 

I wish I was special 

You're so fucking special 

But I'm a creep 

I'm a weirdo 

What the hell am I doing here? 

I don't belong here 

I don't care if it hurts 

I want to have control 

I want a perfect body 

I want a perfect soul 

I want you to notice 

When I'm not 

around 

You're so fucking special 

I wish I was special 

But I'm a creep 

I'm a weirdo 

What the hell am I doing here? 

I don't belong here 

Oh, oh 

She's running out again 

She's running out 

She run run run run 

Run 

Whatever makes you happy 

Whatever you want 

You're so fucking special

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (6.5): Honestly working on the comments for the rate I had to relisten cause I forgot what it sounded like and I guess there was a reason but it’s already too late to change scores sfjkjksf

**thedoctordances1940** (5.7): Yeah the song cowritten by Max Martin and it’s out so early. But like, this isn’t very good, the trap-pop beat is really uninteresting, Zara sounds like she doesn’t care and the lyrics are not that good

---

## Stay happy in their bubble

**sunsetspt1** (9.5): The melodies are unique and never bore me but the bass is too loud for me sometimes

**throwaway-7650** (9): this is a STAYC bside (you hear that @ BEP)?

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): chase the white rabbit omg is that a Madison Beer reference

**Bordersz** (8): I love the guitar and the harmonies. This is a breezy bop. Her vocals slid on this.

**jordannimz** (8): The guitar is such a vibe, and even though the trap drums are a little overdone, it works here. Great harmonies. A gem I totally forgot about.

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Not every pop album needs a trap beat

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): White Rabbit??? omg is this secretly a Madison Beer love song???

**afs** (6.5): she copied the WHITE RABBIT MOTIF TOO???

**BaconShoes** (6.5): how did max martin cowrite one of the worst songs

**pig-serpent** (6.5): I still like this, but it’s certainly generic, even on this fairly generic album.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): this being the max martin song on the album… he really just tossed her a throwaway huh

## Dumped his ass

**ernie** (6): mid.

**vayyiqra** (6): just vibing at this point out of words

**seanderlust** (5.3): i acknowledge this is a weird comparison to make but Karol G would have eaten this beat. i could hear this being one of the midtempo bops on her album - think El Barco

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): i like the Pussycat Dolls' Version better!

**CrimsonROSET** (5): is the white rabbit chase you’re chasing madison beer

**DaHumanTorch** (5): stick with me is what this song didn't do, this is one of the blandest most unremarkable songs i've heard in ages

**ImADudeDuh** (5): whats with these girls and white rabbits

**jasannn** (5): very filler

**fadedblue09** (4): derivative, even for this rate's standards

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I’ve never heard someone say “hater” in a more annoying cadence… also I don’t really get why there’s so many songs about “loving a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks” because I don’t know that this is a very common experience? Like make it about racism or homophobia or something

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): just really really boring

**TheQueenOfVultures** (4): not even the haters could stop her, she is that powerful

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): she set herself up with the white rabbit mention

**bulforster** (3.2): naur

**akanewasright** (3): How are you gonna get Max Martin for the biggest snooze of the album

**celladonn** (3): This is neither yass nor slay

**fairytalehigh** (3): when you're ready come and get it out of rihanna's recycling bin

**mayaSS 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩😜👩‍❤️‍👩** (3): ROSÉ type beat

**shipperondeck** (3): if someone wrote and sung this to me i would break up with them

**skargardin** (3): I've come to the conclusion that Zara's one good down-/midtempo song is Uncover

**Stryxen** (3): even the hay-ders…

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): I’ll stick with the Pussycat Dolls song.

**hikk** (2): no go away

**nicol(y)as(s)** (2): ... i have no words

**frogaranaman** (1): god I just do not care

**jay duh** (1): docking points for the white rabbit name drop... dont speak on madison like actually.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): taking a break from youtube comment reposting here to just say...the fuck was this? of all 3 albums, Zara's sound is the most milquetoast, autopilot; sounds like an audition ditty to get on an unbankrupted Mervyn's playlist.

**sage** (1): mind numbing

**sweetnsoursauce11** (1): say what you want about ava and madison's lyrics but they didn't use the term "haters"

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): not the stock trap drums sample on this

**Uberpigeon** (1): she did NOT say haters... zara please you're making this so difficult

**plastichaxan** (10): Combat interludephobia part 2

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): Yeah Madison loves vocoders

---

## #StopBullyingInterludes

**Roxieloxie** (11): me when im an interlude

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Interludephobia

**jay duh** (10): gag

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): Am I the only one who feels vulnerable and confident at the same time while listening to Interlude? 😶

**ricki** (10): interlude solidarity

**jordannimz** (9): Just to reiterate, I love vocoder. And I love how the minimalist production emphasizes her lyrics and beautiful melody and harmonies, before giving way to another stunning cinematic outro. Super dreamy.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): she knows the key to my heart (a vocoder)

**fairytalehigh** (8): why are the interludes on this album my favorite parts

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Interludephobia need not apply!

**jexan13** (8): cute, tbh. Funny how the "copy's" interludes are longer than the "original's" full songs

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): cute Imogen Heap moment

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**hikk** (7): imogen heap woke up in a cold sweat

**jasannn** (7): her “track 10” is going off

**MassiveThief** (7): the interludes are genuinely my favorite part of this album

**pig-serpent** (7): A Capella with heavy vocal effects gotta be one of my favorite genders, although unfortunately this is a relatively weak outputting in this style.

**seanderlust** (7): hmm...you know how ariana often says how much she loves and is inspired by imogen heap? this sounds like ariana doing a not-particularly-good impersonation of imogen

**SmileAndTears** (7): I love how she didn't even bother giving this a proper title

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): this doesn’t do much but i do like vocoder

**afs** (6.5): who do you think you are, farrah abraham?

**static\_int\_husp** (6): An interlude named interlude on popheads, home of interludephobia? bold choice

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): Interludephobics hate this one simple trick! (making the interlude as long as other songs in the album)

**vayyiqra** (6): Obligatory Imogen Heap reference. I like the strings at the end.

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this weirdly one of the best so far ?

## Interludephobia

**arne** (5): dollar store Bon Iver - 715 CR∑∑KS

**BaconShoes** (5): kinda forgettable

**ernie** (5): cute interlude

**frogaranaman** (5): oh there's a storyline

**MToms** (5): chill on the vocoder

**nlh1013** (5): generally not a huge fan of intros/interludes/outros but I did not mind this one

**oscarbrierley1** (5): vocider slay but kinda meh otherwise.

**skargardin** (5): well its certainly an interlude

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): glad it's an interlude

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): her imogen heap moment

**CrimsonROSET** (4): it’s an interlude

**fadedblue09** (4): No need for the vocoder sis

**ImADudeDuh** (4): remember those tiktoks that were just someone saying a story but autotuned? yeah

**starla\_** (4): interludephobia

**violet** (4): uhm...

**welcome2thejam** (4): Shoutout Madison for naming her interlude Interlude so I know where to drop the automatic low score

**bulforster** (3.9): naur

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Damn she couldn’t even bother to give this a real title.

**cremeebrulee** (2.5): u cannot convince me that this isn’t just madison rambling into a running fan

**LesApfels** (2): https://youtu.be/qLPIKhrMVkc

**TiltControls** (2): Is she speaking into a fan?

**shipperondeck** (1): she loves the vocoder huh

**Uberpigeon** (1): this made me a vocoder anti

**DirtyRat583** (0): it was between the beginning and this and after a relisten this is worse so

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Yeah it’s not entirely true but it’s funny

**plastichaxan** (5): Kinda feels like Madison erasure I think she hasn’t bubbled under

---

## And they serve because of it

**Gusearth** (11): iconic and true

**pig-serpent** (11): Hits all my categories for a good name

**thegolding** (11): this is so mean but so iconic lmao

**frog (i guess)!** (10): this is the shadiest of these names it kind of sends

**fairytalehigh** (9): the shade!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): not the best title but it definitely works well

**indie\_fan\_** (8): LOL this made me laugh, so I gotta give it a positive score.

**shipperondeck** (8): lmao

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Save this one for a Bebe Rexha / Rita Ora / Kim Petras rate

**majid** (7): wouldn't pick it but it would be a good option

**vayyiqra** (7): Feel like this only makes sense to chart nerds which is the main drawback; however it's kind of funny.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): if I ever become a musician, I'll get added to this.

**Awkward\_King** (0): boring because its true

## They deserve better

**anothertown** (7): mostly accurate but does a disservice to Ava lmao

**afs** (6): exCUSE me. ava max is a global SUPERSTAR.

**1998tweety** (5): erm ava has HIT(s)

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): HOW DOMT THEY HAVE MIORE VIEWS THIS SHOULD BE THE MOS TPOPULAR THING I N T HE CIOUTNRY

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): I feel like I hear too much Ava Max and Zara Larsson on radio/cable to consider them bubbling under, might be a Turkey thing

**DirtyRat583** (3): actually all the girlies here charted (even madison beer, although she peaked at 53 in my country)

**RandomHypnotica** (3): it just isn't really true

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): Ava actually charts sometimes.

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): Only because it doesn't apply to Ava Max

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i've never seen anyone call this rate that and also it's a lie bc ava max isn't a bubbling under artist even though she should be

## They deserve worse

**runaway3212** (5): this one kinda misses the playfull aspect

**SLAYdedblue09** (5): Okay but this is highkey misinformation cuz Madison and Zara only have 1 entries each. Maybe Ava qualifies...

**ricki** (3): i don't think madison has made the bubbling under

**TiltControls** (3): not bad but doesn't say much

**flavasavavandal** (1): we all know Zara won't be touching the bubbling under despite the rate promo

**Stryxen** (1): not accurate at all madison can't even get there

**jackisboredtoday** (0): love the bubbling under shoutout but 0 Ava songs have peaked on the bubbling under, one Madison song has, and two Zara songs have. Not exactly queen numbers even there

**seanderlust** (0): we are being REAL generous with the phrase "bubbling under" huh

=====

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): Sure it’s got the cliché drug metaphor but it’s a cute little ballad and I like it

**plastichaxan** (7): I don’t think a comment gets better than “what she needs is better producers” like why try

---

## Part of the [70.5%](https://preview.redd.it/9mm75owyn6u61.png?width=2406&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f7094d5422d389b7f61b5df582977d5cfd79bc)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this probably doesnt deserve a 10 but i dont feel like breaking my rating scale for this rate just to give this song a 7 so i’ll be nice and round it up

**jordannimz** (9.5): I think this chorus has my favourite melody on this album. I really like the production on this song; it's really beautiful. And her ad libs in the last chorus are so powerful!

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): ME TOO BITCH!!!

**1998tweety** (8): same girl same

**akanewasright** (8): okay so this song isn’t very good, but I also need love, so I have no choice but to stan (this is unironically why this is one of my most played songs on the album)

**jay duh** (8): yass

**runaway3212** (8): me too girl

**ricki** (7.8): don't we all

**TiltControls** (7.5): relatable

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): me too bitch tf

**afs** (7): hunters aren't the only people who need their blood...

**AHSWeeknd** (7): those examples of “like a ___ needs a ___” were really interesting, I wonder how many more Zara could’ve come up with

**BaconShoes** (7): her vocals sound great, but it’s a bit dull compared to the rest of the album

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): if you ignore “like a hunter needs his blood”, and “like the poison needs the pill” it really isn’t that bad

**jexan13** (6.5): that chorus is abbrasive

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): Calvin Harris ft. Ellie Goulding outsold

**emayzee** (6.4): same

**fairytalehigh** (6.2): this is a nice chorus but i'm sorta sick of these autotuned-backed choruses (unless your name is rina)

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why are you first associations to things you need addiction, hunters and poison miss zara are you ok

**fadedblue09** (6): kinda filler

**HornyForWater** (6): the remix with Trevor Daniels outsold

**lillipup03** (6): This was my favorite song on release day… what was I thinking lol

**vayyiqra** (6): please no more pop songs with love/infatuation = drug/addiction metaphors I beg but otherwise this is pretty alright

**shipperondeck** (5.7): and i need to sleep in this airplane but we dont all get what we want do we miss larsson

## Like a Zara song needs its tankers

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): I don't like your ballads

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Theoretically I should love this because it basically panders directly to me but it feels underwritten, almost like a scratch demo. She should have given the music and lyrics a second pass to make them stand out more.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): a little boring but not bad

**Uberpigeon** (5): drug metaphors are my pet peeve sorry zara

**bulforster** (4.8): hmm

**celladonn** (4.5): very generic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This song needs like some five hour energy or something.

**Roxieloxie** (4): me when im evil sam smith

**Stryxen** (4): she stole imogen heap's passport

**hikk** (3): me too but could u have maybe made a better song about it

**nicol(y)as(s)** (3): what she needs is better producers

**skargardin** (3): this snoozefest

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): this is giving ava max lyricism im sorry

**apatel27** (2): God it's so juvenile

**MassiveThief** (2): Suuuuuuuper generic lyrics, and nothing interesting musically

**welcome2thejam** (2): Weaksauce song, only part that made me feel anything was the bridge

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): was this song necessary? It’s so nondescript

**frogaranaman** (1): SOMEONE BUY ZARA TINDER GOLD

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): "How is this not blowing up, her management is slacking on marketing or something because this'd have no trouble going viral, something's not right here, she deserves more" THE YOUTUBE COMMENTS SO EXACERBATED BY HER NOT GETTING MORE PLAYS YASS

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (9.1): Yeah I love this, it just works for me

**plastichaxan** (9): I’ll let this robbery pass I guess… maybe there’s worse to come

---

## WOW

**akanewasright** (10): This song dropped right before I came out for the first time. Like it was a complete coincidence that I wound up coming out that week (Taylor Swift’s ME! and Avengers Endgame have more to do with me coming, ask me about that some time), but I still have a lot of nostalgia for it. Plus like… why lie it’s a massive serve

**BaconShoes** (10): One of the more unique songs I think, and it’s a hit

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok tbh i don't love this one but i looped it an absurd amount a few years ago so not giving it a 10 feels dishonest

**jay duh** (10): yasss reminds me of reputation for whatever reason.. white girl gone BAD.

**mayaSS 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩😜👩‍❤️‍👩** (10): WOW!

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream the remix with *that blonde girl* I mean sabrina carpenter

**vayyiqra** (10): Not sure why I like this so much. It's a weird song and in a different mood I might find it really annoying with the loud fake horns, but I like it. It's uh hyperpop or something. It's experimental. It's the avant-garde.

**Vromega** (10): pop perfection

**1998tweety** (8.5): Sabrina remix outsold

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): this is a slay idgaf

**nlh1013** (8.5): a certified bop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): Kylie outsold

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop drop.

**fadedblue09** (7): The way I picked this as an interlude for my rate despite never watching the MV before

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): the anti-Right Here, it sounds worse though

**shipperondeck** (7): wait wtf i know this song. what chewing gum commercial was this in

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): she's a bit of a banger

## WOW (sarcastically)

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): I loved this song when it first came out, I find it boring now.

**TiltControls** (6.5): WOW vs OMG quickrate

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): i kinda see how this went viral but i dont think all the parts of the song work together that well

**afs** (6): ow

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This could work perfectly for a 15 second ice cream commercial

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): WOW, this is painfully mediocre!

**MToms** (6): too much noise

**pig-serpent** (6): The "oh this is the boring piano ballad" to "oh wait this is gonna drop" to "oh wait the drop is bad" pipeline.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): I don't like the horns but the bop potential was there

**emayzee** (5.9): this feels very AJR except i prefer every AJR song i've ever heard over this

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): List of artists who outsold: Kylie Minogue, Alaska Thunderfuck, LOONA, Brandy, the cast of Julie and the Phantoms, Melissa Villaseñor doing an Owen Wilson impression

**jordannimz** (5): This was my least favourite song from Zara's between-albums-droplet era, and like, it's fine, but it's never really grabbed my attention. I do like her vocals in the outro, though.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): feel like the all caps wow might have been a bit of an overstatement

**Uberpigeon** (5): these corny ass lyrics

**violet** (5): at the corner of mediocre and mediocrest bye

## WOW (derogatory)

**anothertown** (4): the horns are literally so bad

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): sorry but i only see this as ad music

**CrimsonROSET** (3): i assure you this drop is not making anyone say wow

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I remembered this song but holy shit this production is much worse than i remember

**nicol(y)as(s)** (3): nothing wow about this song

**notsomainpoplietoc** (2.5): "Tell me your favorite part of the music video!!!! It's ok if you have to rewatch it a couple times 💕💕💕" well zara, Im a little frustrated that you're wearing horny clothing but you say "I’m just in a t-shirt on the couch". anyways I think having a bro watch yr hologram is endearing camp, but still this too horny. horny cap engaged.

**seanderlust** (2.5): leave world of wonder out of this

**bulforster** (2): naur!

**fairytalehigh** (2): kate bush outsold

**Stryxen** (2): me typing in the drag race streaming service to watch drag race because i am a fan of drag race

**sage** (1.4): the trap horns need to be banished from existence

**Awkward\_King** (1): this is what everyones goin wild for...

**ernie** (1): no matter how many times i listen to this i just hate it with each listen, this feels like torture

**frogaranaman** (1): why is she barely wearing any clothes this album

**ricki** (1): i said she was mother not that she was perfect. we all have lapses of judgement sometimes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i’m having such a violently negative reaction to that drop and these lyrics

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): I hate this chorus with my whole heart. Something about it makes me think of “if Hannah Diamond tried to make a trap banger” which sounds cool on paper but it’s really so ass!!

**flavasavavandal** (0): excuse me but what the actual fuck is this

**hikk** (0): the brass horn blast is so kpop boygroup (derogatory) also im PISSED that this trash ended up on the album while all the time and don't worry bout me got shafted a bitch is petty so a 0 it is

**MassiveThief** (0): idk what to say other than the chorus sucks. like she tried to recreate Gold by Kiiara but 20x worse. oh and the indie girl voice is annoying.

**skargardin** (0): her worst song and single to date I fear

**TheQueenOfVultures** (0): is she even in a gown

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I like this quite a lot tbh and I think it deserved better. I think it’s the better executed song of the Summer Edition tracks but obviously had a big uphill battle against a not particularly notable Synth-pop song everyone including myself was going to eat up. The melodies, the vocal performance on this are really good though, and I feel like these are some of the better lyrics on Zara’s album overall.

**plastichaxan** (6): Yeah this is fair

---

## Enjoying the moment

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A day one out but deserves better

**indie\_fan\_** (8.6): Got some tropical-ass vibes that I dig

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): a good song that was almost certainly pitched to rihanna and tossed off

**afs** (8): I sleep

**Bordersz** (8): Standout track!

**flavasavavandal** (8): it’s been too long since I’ve heard a great song

**MassiveThief** (8): How is this not on the standard edition. It's miles better than anything on it, even if the beat is basically just "I Don't Care" By Ed/Biebs.

**skargardin** (8): this deserved way more!

**vayyiqra** (8): Forgot Emily Warren existed until I read the credits for this and remembered someone told me last year to check her out two years ago because her voice sounded like Kimbra, and I liked her so shoutout to whoever said that.

**Vromega** (8): Her voice shines

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): you are a decent song

**jay duh** (7): hmmmm...

**jordannimz** (7): Shoulda been on the standard edition of the album because it's waaay better than some of those songs. I love Zara's head voice in the chorus.

**BaconShoes** (6.5): cute but nothing too special

**jexan13** (6.5): Do you remember that dark era of Trop Pop that was famous during 2016-2018? This is like a better version of that horror

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): the chorus is really pretty but the faux dancehall production is so dated to me. The billen ted remix has better production, but has an EDM dance break.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): this was dated the instant it released

**CrimsonROSET** (6): dont make decisions in a hangover!!!

**jackisboredtoday** (6): this feels like it was left in a box from 2017-18 and only rediscovered when zara needed an extra bonus track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): This chorus is kind of nice but this is a royalty-free beat for sure.

**bulforster** (5.2): hmm

## Get it over with instead

**fadedblue09** (5): inessential

**frogaranaman** (5): fine song but for the baby raters that don't know this is terrible advice 😭

**shipperondeck** (5): im running out of mundane things to say

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like if you yassified i don’t care by ed sheeren

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Why does this song do all that build up and then immediately pretend like it didn’t happen?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): better than the last three songs but still boring :(

**ricki** (3.5): this has to have been played at least once on love island

**anothertown** (3): the boobooness continues

**celladonn** (0): Soooo boring and I really hate the way the percussion sounds

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): she had room for this on the Summer Edition but not All the Time? jail.

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): When this was winning… we were all so happy… Imagine a universe where this is in winners rate 3

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): Yeah, this song was somehow briefly first very early on but unsurprisingly it didn’t last. Seeing it fall throughout the rate was kinda sad but also not surprising, but this is one of the better interludes/intros/outros and the radio broadcast format is really cool, and maybe one day Madison will even make a full Signalwave album.

---

## Have listened to all 6 and a half hours Himawari gazou

**arne** (11): nice little outro, this is probably the closest we'll get to my taste of music in this rate so have my 11

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Channel Surfing is the analog horror I need in my life.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Surprised she didn’t sneak some more Rick and Morty in there.

**ernie** (10): giving this a 10 because this is finally over

**jay duh** (10): girl fuck you for cancelling my merch order!

**nicol(y)as(s)** (10): nice outro

**ricki** (10): interlude solidarity but it doesnt deserve it

**Stryxen** (10): i hope this wins

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is hyperpop

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I love the implication that people are playing Madison Beer on TV

**fairytalehigh** (9): speaking with bias as a dark ambient stan but this is so fucking cool. i think madison has a lot to say but she's stuck trying to be like everyone else. she and her team could do so much with her perspective and voice if they leaned into this sound.

**starla\_** (8.1): this is weirdly compelling?

**emayzee** (8): im not even trying to be shady by rating this higher than more than half the album but the guitar at the end is a highlight of this album for me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): really takes you inside her frame of mind as an artist impacted by pop culture

**1998tweety** (7): Now why couldn't you have just put Dear Society here instead

**afs** (7): god this really sounds like an outro to an acclaimed indie pop album that I wouldn't get....

**akanewasright** (7): this is sweet

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): i got not a lot to say other than this is a good ending.

**TiltControls** (7): Okay this actually is pretty good for interludes/intros/closers

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): u know its bad when this is one of the most interesting songs on the album

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): much more interesting than the beginning was, i’ll give it that

## Intrigued

**cremeebrulee** (6): oh i hate when artists do this (@ BILLIE EILISH!!!!) but at least the channel surfing framing of it makes it a little more justifiable

**DaHumanTorch** (6): this is how dear society can still be a single-

**jordannimz** (6): It's a fine thematic outro with some pretty strings and guitar, but the channel surfing bit is just not for me.

**oscarbrierley1** (6): it gives spongebob music vibes. Such a weird way to end what was trying to be a serious album

**RandomHypnotica** (6): it's exactly what it says on the box :shrug:

**skargardin** (6): well that was cute ig

**SmileAndTears** (6): 🤨

**thegolding** (6): No Madison, thank you.

**2dina3dworld** (5): how the fuck do I rate this

**anothertown** (5): you know what go on girl and do your thing i guess [2]

**BaconShoes** (5): it’s ok idk this doesn’t really add much to the album

**CrimsonROSET** (5): the spongebob-ification of madison beer

**fadedblue09** (5): uh huh

**frogaranaman** (5): legit forgot this was supposed to be a storyline by the end

**ignitethephoenix** (5): cool concept but like I’m interlude phobic and this is the worse thing here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i don't have an opinion on this

**bulforster** (4.9): hmm

**babadork** (4.6): If this was a little shorter, I think I would really like it.

## Wtf is Signalwave?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): this is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the album

**lillipup03** (4): Cool concept, but that sound hurts my ears

**MToms** (4): kind of unfair that these have to receive points

**sunsetspt1** (4): Interesting idea but no reason to ever listen to it

**vayyiqra** (4): This was very disorienting and pointless but whatever, it's short.

**Vromega** (4): a mess. I pretend I do not hear

**Bordersz** (3.5): I hate this ending.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): This hurts my ears?

**Roxieloxie** (3.4): me when i watch that one fairly odd parents special

**apatel27** (3): Not much to it is there

**static\_int\_husp** (2): this truly was not necessary

**hikk** (1): didn't eat like the intro there's not rly any reason to listen to this

**ImADudeDuh** (1): next drag race monologue lip sync???

**MassiveThief** (1): I tend to automatically hate any studio song with applause. This is no exception. A jagged, annoying song to end this album.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): "It’s crazy to me how so much emotion can be heard from just those small snippets" bro you would fucken cream if u heard burial's archangel or in mcdonalds.

**shipperondeck** (1): i wish i could give more than one 0, this shit is annoying

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): shes artsy

**nlh1013** (0): not into it

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (9): Isn’t it too soon to ask Ava

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): Seeing various forms of pop reggae by white pop up occasionally is never really all that fun but I do quite like this, probably because it doesn’t rely to heavily on the guitars and has enough electronic stuff to make it enjoyable for me.

---

## Not me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): should be in the new Joker movie ❤️

**1998tweety** (9): campy, loved the guitar too.

**akanewasright** (9): I think this rate just taught me that I’ll eat up anything Noonie Bao writes

**BaconShoes** (9): very yas very slay

**jay duh** (9): just an overall slay why lie about it? What do you gain from pretending to be a hater? Are you getting cut a check? Is your car note being paid off? Did your ass get fatter? No? So why?

**celladonn** (8.5): ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

**ernie** (8): the song kinda gets repetitive but it’s camp so i’m bopping, also the mv for this song slays!

**babadork** (7.8): The fake laughs, which I would normally hate, are the best part of this song.

**afs** (7.5): this is probably the first time I've seen someone using "doesn't" wrong in a song instead of using "don't" wrong

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I'm glad she switched up a bit cuz the dancefloor pop was getting tired

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Shoutout to all the Harley Quinn AMVs on YouTube

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): in her joker era

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): this chorus is actually kinda good in a campy-not-actually way

**skargardin** (7): catchy af I fear

**Stryxen** (6.5): on paper this is just so bad and i should hate it but i just can’t make myself dislike it it’s kinda so fun… the chorus is horrifically bad and yet i love

**violet** (6.5): hahahahahaha

**AHSWeeknd** (6): one thing Ava Max can do is make you cringe.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): everyone who understands that you're not a single-worthy track.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this album severely suffers from ‘i got the beat first and struggled to make lyrics fit’

**oscarbrierley1** (6): the whistling is a no, this is not 2012

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): Jessie J met the Pussycat Dolls

**welcome2thejam** (6): Very very proud of this song for recovering from that awful intro

**jordannimz** (5.5): The production feels a bit dated (2017, anyone?). Not a bad melody but this is the most forgettable song on the album imo. The guitar solo bumped it up half a point though.

**bulforster** (5.3): hmm

## Me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): If I were truly over somebody I wouldn’t spend so much time fantasizing about them crying and pining for me in bed.

**frogaranaman** (5): this is tolerable, but on thin ice

**hikk** (5): ava when she absolutely clears this rate bc her album is the best (except maybe not this song)

**indie\_fan\_** (5): I guess I am, but not out of delight, if that’s what you mean

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): The only bad thing about this song is that it ends. ava's coalition building bop features so many cutsie #fitchecks. if only she did a runway music video that lasted 1hr...

**pig-serpent** (5): I don’t know why we needed this song right after Take You To Hell, which does a similar spooky upbeat rhythm.

**ricki** (5): all points i gave to this are because of that little guitar solo

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): its not bad but its not good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): not the hahahas in the chorus…did the joker cowrite this???

**Uberpigeon** (5): im not!

**shipperondeck** (4.8): that evil laugh? can we get pop villain ava please? or is that already her with her samples

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4.5): not me. i stay stone faced and unimpressed

**jackisboredtoday** (4.4): everything about this song just feels so cheap to me

**fairytalehigh** (4.3): i demand a 10 year ban on whistling in pop music!

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): boring yet also annoying?

**RoyalBloodFool** (4): The intro sounds like an ad

**seanderlust** (3.5): i hate something viscerally about these lyrics but i'm really struggling to put my finger on it but yeah, not having a great reaction to this one

**TiltControls** (3.5): not ava when she sees this score

**Awkward\_King** (3): apparently ive consumed this song so much through osmosis

**DaHumanTorch** (3): your hair dresser is who

**runaway3212** (3): somehow still better than what Jessie J was trying to do

**cremeebrulee** (2.4): :|

**ImADudeDuh** (2): damn, if hell sounds like this half of the album, maybe i need to be straight

**vayyiqra** (2): This is trying so hard to be Ace of Base I thought it was literally a sample of a song by them. Anyway, typical Ava formula: edgy theme about revenge, annoying gimmick (laughter this time), something about being CrAzY and psycho. "She is seen dancing in a destroyed office and breaking a car with a crowbar, before breaking free of a psychiatric hospital while strapped in a straitjacket." Once again I am glad I did not watch the video.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): Ha ha ha Ha ha ha Ha Bitch!

**2dina3dworld** (0): is this her equivalent of an emotional ballad

**RandomHypnotica** (0): me, I'm laughing at you

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this girlie needs to learn that you cannot come for jessie j's throne as the top not-so-main pop girl and miss

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (10): we need to combat intro/interludephobia

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): The best performing (but not my favourite) of Madison’s interludes and managed to beat out quite a few non-interludes but at the end of the day it’s just a pretty opening track and not much more

---

## Introphobia is still Interludephobia!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): interludephobia still exists, I however do not partake in it.

**jay duh** (10): heavenly daring charismatic enchanting alluring breathtaking jaw dropped earth shattering EXCELLENCE.

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): opening with the beginning is bold and the chance to rate a real opening interlude is welcome. this tells a story of how good music is. what it means to be alive. generations of songs can only dare to have aspired to that.

**ricki** (10): intro solidarity

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): a flawless mood setter, but imagine if she put it at the end? never been done before!

**jordannimz** (9): Madison is here to let you know that she can SING. A very good intro.

**nicol(y)as(s)** (9): ended ariana

**starla\_** (8.5): really dreamy intro

**sage** (8.3): ate

**anothertown** (8): prety

**ernie** (8): interesting way to start off the album, love the vocals

**hikk** (8): pretty

**indie\_fan\_** (8): Wow that is actually a beautiful intro, I do not remember that the last time I listened to this + I am pleasantly surprised.

**SmileAndTears** (8): something something ariana grande

**Uberpigeon** (8): Matt, go back to sleep. I think I've finally got it all figured out.... like a butterfly floating in amber

**Vromega** (8): pretty sure she wanted to copy raindrops but it's not bad

**1998tweety** (7.5): I mean she does sound good here

**Bordersz** (7.5): Not a big fan of intros, but her vocals were heavenly.

**afs** (7): god this really sounds like an intro to an acclaimed art pop album that I wouldn't get....

**akanewasright** (7): the way she starts the album with this dramatic ass intro and then has it lead into the most basic pop song on the album

**jasannn** (7): raindrops by ariana grande but make it all moans

**RandomHypnotica** (7): magbay outsold

**runaway3212** (7): come through concept album queen

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): pretty

**emayzee** (6.8): idk what to rate this bc pretty much nothing is happening but i've still heard worse in this rate

**BaconShoes** (6.5): sets the mood i suppose, but nothing special

**MToms** (6.5): ghostly Ariana (not to confuse with ghostin)

**fairytalehigh** (6): the book of genesis outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): this is the most melodramatic “hi” I’ve ever heard

**ImADudeDuh** (6): imagine sharing a song title with RuPaul and him eating you up

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): her voice is so beautiful but it's literally just a minute of AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 😭😭

**pig-serpent** (6): I love me a good spooky cold open but it's odd that this fades out before the first real song starts.

**skargardin** (6): ok vocals!

**bulforster** (5.2): hmm

## Yeah and that’s why we don’t like it

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this is the beginning of the record you like

**fadedblue09** (5): inviting

**majid** (5): okay intro i guess? lol

**static\_int\_husp** (5): yup, that's an intro

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its a bit vocal slayage but its also an intro so

**wy** (5): Matt isn't the only one going back to sleep 😴

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): another unnecessary intro track but it loses a point for being connected to a terrible song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Don’t care about this as a song but shoutout to her for the accurate title. MagBay could never.

**vayyiqra** (4): That felt very much like "wait, there was an intro?".

**welcome2thejam** (4): Bro I just finished 2021 Electropop please stop sending me albums with tracks named the Beginning and the End

**cremeebrulee** (3.7): ik this came out before the magbay album but . sorry they own this title now

**TiltControls** (3.5): this deserves to beat some actual songs

**Stryxen** (3): rupaul > magbay >>>>> this

**oscarbrierley1** (2): she doesn't have an impressive enough voice to pull this off.

**sunsetspt1** (2): Pretty but unnecessary, she does more of the same on the beginning of Homesick and I think I would've preferred having that song as the opener

**Roxieloxie** (1.8): me when im mag bay

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): ?????????? why does she think we care

**frogaranaman** (1): I did not enjoy this

**nlh1013** (1): pretty but didn’t really deserve a score to me and the 0 was taken by the outro

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): ahh ah ahha ahha

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): I know you have a good voice but that’s what songs are for. go next omg

**shipperondeck** (0): white woman breathing (annoying)

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (11): This is also true, but truer

**thedoctordances1940** (7): Yes this is every popheads rate but like it’s true

---

## Regular Popheads Rater

**fairytalehigh** (11): I have never felt like more of a white girl than listening to Madison beer

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): now THAT'S a rate title if i've ever seen one

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this perfectly sums up the rate and the actual fans of the artists

**majid** (10): i love it, straight to the point

**frog (i guess)!** (9): LMFAOOOOOO

**notsomainpoplietoc** (7.8): madison beer is white?!

**ernie** (7): basic, like the title ❤️

**runaway3212** (7): plain and simple!

## Regular Popheads Rater _but self aware_

**ricki** (7): i mean ... yes, but them being white is not what unites them

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): excuse me zara larsson isnt white she's SWEDISH

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): I'm yellow tho

**arne** (6): it's true but it doesn't hit as much

**Jexan13** (6): but they're not white! they're European

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Albanian erasure

**jackisboredtoday** (5): Simple, straight to the point

**RandomHypnotica** (5): this is literally over half of all ph rates

**Stryxen** (5): they're literally all POC? Ava is Albanian, madison Grande Is Italian and zara is swedish

**DirtyRat583** (4): madison is white?

**seanderlust** (4): this describes like half of the popheads rates

**SLAYdedblue09** (4): Let's make pop a genre of inclusivity 🙏

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): manifested Baby Queen AMA

**flavasavavandal** (3): no comment

**1998tweety** (0): tbf this title could apply to half of our rates

**afs** (0): this can be used for like half the rates done

**anothertown** (0): there are so many other white girl rates on here lol

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): you could apply this title to half of all popheads rates and it would fit, and no this is not a good thing

**indie\_fan\_** (0): Sooo... over half the rates Popheads have done?

**pig-serpent** (0): This is every rate

**Roxieloxie** (0): isn’t every rate this

**shipperondeck** (0): as someone who's called it white girl pop rate from the start, you need the POP part. idk why. it's just necessary. idk.

**TiltControls** (0): there's at least 50 rates we've done that could've been titled this

**vayyiqra** (0): A bad name. Lots of rates have white girls; Popheads became infamous for that to the point we've since diversified our selection process. Also not a funny name, nor is it yass. Was a 4 but I might as well use my 0 here.

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (8): God making gays to release into the world

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): My lowest score for Ava, the cod reggae chorus is always a bit of a downside and as an introduction to the second half of the album it doesn’t really do much but it’s still fine.

---

## On their way to Heaven with Ava

**jay duh** (10): the people shes taking to hell is anyone giving her an under 7 average btw

**notsomainpoplietoc** (10): "Can we just talk about how great the quality of the audio is- it sounds as if you are in a room with this queen 🤚🏻"

**1998tweety** (9): I love The Living Tombstones

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): this is the most camp needy girls songs

**jordannimz** (8.5): My fav part of the song is the little bit of piano in the second verse on the lyric "me-he-he-he-eal". I love the groove in this song and the transitions into the chorus just feel perfect to me.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): stranger things type intro

**starla\_** (8.5): camp

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): That incredible Five Nights At Freddy’s song ruined this for me but you know what? Even the shadow of great art can be beautiful in its own right

**hikk** (8): the queen of concept albums making her statement clear

**MToms** (8): the beginning caught my attention

**pig-serpent** (8): “Let’s see who this song is under the mask…Dear Future Husband!”

**BaconShoes** (7.5): Sets the mood for the “hell” portion, but not super amazing

**shipperondeck** (7.1): heaven & hell is a concept album.

**afs** (7): you sure you don't want to be a diva

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): i don't need to, I'm already gay anyway

**jasannn** (7): I keep doing the Blackpink Playing with Fire dance to this song.

**violet** (7): lalala lala lalalala the re-up

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): Calm down just trash his car like a normal woman scorned.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): the intro to this song is amazing, the rest is fine

**AHSWeeknd** (6): an accordion would work well here, just so it could sound worse than it already is

**CrimsonROSET** (6): me and my broken heart

**MassiveThief** (6): It's good but I'm also sure I've heard this song done by 50 other artists, from the beat to the main chorus melody

**runaway3212** (6): i hate this but im also kinda yassing

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): better than h.e.a.v.e.n. because this has a discernible hook, but it still feels sorta awkward and stilted in any place that isn’t that hook

**fadedblue09** (5.5): something about the melody sounds like a Disney Villain-ish song

## Already in Hell

**frogaranaman** (5): whatever that is in the middle of the song? camp

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): summarize this album in one track name

**bulforster** (4.8): hmm

**ricki** (4.8): the nightcore version of this would get used by FNAF cosplayers on TikTok

**akanewasright** (4): this feels like a ripoff of the mid songs on Turn off the Light, but the hook is halfway decent at least

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this song is like missing 1 element from being a Five Nights At Freddy’s fan song

**nlh1013** (4): ok I know the album is called heaven and hell but she is laying it on pretty thick for it not to be a concept album or anything lol

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): this song pisses me off, because the first 15 seconds promise a dark electro slay, but then it becomes a showtune

**Uberpigeon** (4): its giving pennywise but its a kids musical

**seanderlust** (3.2): i just know some tiktokers have made some very edgy lip sync videos to this one

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): this song reminds me of "me and my broken heart" by some british one hit wonder i can't remember the name of and i fucking hate it

**indie\_fan\_** (3): Sounds like a Disney Halloween Lullaby

**skargardin** (3): A laughably weak attempt at creating a concept I fear

**vayyiqra** (3): Why does Ava keep trying to be edgy on this album? She is about as edgy as a blunt butterknife. What is her deal. Just make bleepbloop music, that's all we want from her. Why are her lyrics so awful? "I'm a five-course meal" ??? I am not touching that because I am so confused. Doing this rate at 8 in the morning was unwise.

**welcome2thejam** (3): This is what I imagine Tones & I's other songs sound like

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i just realised this album feels like the daughter of who you are by jessie j

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): didn't realize the song title was referring to my impending scores

**fairytalehigh** (2.2): i cannot express in words how much i hate how she sings "i'm not a bite, i'm a five course me-hee-hee-hee-hee-heal"

**cremeebrulee** (2): they really hammer this concept album into you

**static\_int\_husp** (2): y'know what I changed my mind, bring back normal interludes like Heaven

**2dina3dworld** (1): this song has to be like the eightieth circle of hell

**RandomHypnotica** (1): oh this is… not good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): this sounds like a five nights at freddy’s fansong

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**plastichaxan** (8): I agree it was over too soon but what we got is great I don’t mind

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): It’s not titled interlude like the actual interlude on this album so I wouldn’t consider it one really but I also get where people are coming from calling it one, it’s very short, doesn’t have much of a chorus but it’s a very pretty song.

---

## #Stopthingsthatkindasoundlikeinterludesphobia

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The production/lyrics proves that Madison Beer is a genius.

**anothertown** (10): a sub-2-minute song that has multiple movements in it, that's the madison beer experience to me

**Bordersz** (10): Emotional lyrics, relatable, love the effects on her vocals very Lana-esque, she is singing like she is on life support towards the end I love it.

**jay duh** (10): MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!!!!! Just a great song filled to the brim with excellence and madisons haunting voice echoing across a brain tingling beat that is in real time changing the way you perceive the world like WOW.

**jexan13** (9): should be longer, but such a mood setter

**Vromega** (9): "The end of me" makes me ascend :woeis:

**Uberpigeon** (8): oh this is actually vibes

**emayzee** (7.6): not it ending as soon as it started to get really good

**1998tweety** (7.5): this is fine

**afs** (7.5): that cut off was something

**seanderlust** (7.2): interesting instrumental!

**BaconShoes** (7): pretty, moody, kinda short

**DaHumanTorch** (7): this has some cool production moments especially with her vocals

**fairytalehigh** (7): this is rather lovely, the vocals are great, but the whole "honey, you'll be the death of me" thing is just lana, lana, lana

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I wish this transitioned to the next song then it would be the serve

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): love the moody vibe but it's just so short and the end is a bit abrupt

**jordannimz** (6.5): Her vocals in the start are just heavenly! I just don't love from 0:49-1:07, but after that, it's gorgeous again.

**MToms** (6.5): feels like an unfinished idea

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): it's nice but very much just an interlude

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): the pop star machine when making madison:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Title is apt. I’m very neutral on this one.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): buzz lightyear on that one fake out ending of toy story

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this whole song felt like an intro

**oscarbrierley1** (6): the best of the interludes. The start of the album when I listen to it. Kinda long for an Interlude.

## Can’t believe how many times they’ve been let down this rate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): so basic, so mid, so… default

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Some gorgeous vocals here but not really memorable

**bulforster** (5.4): hmm

**akanewasright** (5): Yeah she’s aiming for art pop here and misses the mark. She sounds gorgeous and the production is great, but the melody is bland

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): this song is too short to make any impression on me

**frogaranaman** (5): sounds fine but it's like any other pop song right now

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Why does she spend this much time singing without making a point?

**lillipup03** (5): I love the electronic touches but it feels so anti-climatic

**skargardin** (5): well, that happened!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why is this so short

**TheQueenOfVultures** (5): She cuts it off right as it gets interesting

**vayyiqra** (5): It was kind of quiet and in one ear and out the other, from what I remember.

**Roxieloxie** (4.4): me when im internet explorer (rip)

**static\_int\_husp** (4): girl what is this, I am genuinely asking

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): this song isn't needed on here

**pig-serpent** (3.5): I like the second half of the song, but not enough to make up for the first half.

**ricki** (3): ...alright

**nlh1013** (2): this was just slightly too slow for me. I know this is a very low score but I did not really revisit this after the first listen whereas at least with Ava’s album I listened to each song more than once

**shipperondeck** (2): trying to be lana

**Awkward\_King** (1): how is every song the worst song ive ever heard

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): "I h4te her for making this so short. It's probably my favorite track! What in the world did I do to deserve such a pain in my heart, Miss Madison?!"

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): Honestly I was kinda surprised this was out day 1, it’s a cute bop that seemed rather inoffensive to me but i guess there just weren’t that many people that really liked it

**plastichaxan** (6.5): I mean it’s kinda fun yeah

---

## The two most slay raters that loved almost everything here giving it a 10 and other people that also liked it ig

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “two girls in the bed” did popheads write essays about this line queer-baiting or not?

**jay duh** (10): omg gag genuinely

**1998tweety** (8): this is filler but good filler

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is fine.

**BaconShoes** (8): The remix might be better that they used in the music video but idk

**fadedblue09** (8): I wish that Clean Bandit-ish drop in the chorus stayed for the whole song

**static\_int\_husp** (8): now maybe I am too sapphic to comment on het relationships but if you're boyfriend is ignoring you so much, maybe leave???

**vayyiqra** (8): Allegedly Julia Michaels is here as well but I cannot tell where.

**afs** (7.5): queen of character progression from not showering to using perfume

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I love that this song features reverse queerbaiting… she’s like yeah I could use a girl for male attention but it’s not worth it :\

**hikk** (7.5): she's down sooooo bad my god

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): this starts off rough (Zara don’t you DARE use a good woman to make your scrub boyfriend jealous!) but it does have some cool production

**TiltControls** (7.5): they say if you recite the you stan zara larsson video 3 times backwards you can summon her right behind you!! until then i'll keep staring at the screen, thanks Zara

**fairytalehigh** (7.1): sorry i'm drunk here did she say "sucking the waiter"?

**anothertown** (7): zara you seem to be mentioning two girls in the bed a lot

**MToms** (7): extra points for lyrics

**pig-serpent** (7): The hook is the only thing saving this song, but damn, it is saving it.

**ricki** (7): zara have you ever stopped to think about how the two other girls in the bed might feel about the fact that you're fully ignoring them for some guy that's clearly not interested in you? i personally believe you should focus on what you do have and not what you dont! have fun with the other ladies, i mean...

**shipperondeck** (6.9): mall music

**jexan13** (6.5): maybe if she got naked the song would be more interesting

**Stryxen** (6.5): she wants to be robyn so bad

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6.5): Why doesnt she pronounce the last syllable to her words

## Maybe the guy has a point

**seanderlust** (6): this is maybe the most forever 21-core instrumental in the rate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): honestly this sounds like an ava max song LOL

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): very fogettable

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this is just worse love me land idk what to tell you

**skargardin** (5): this goes in one ear, out the other

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): that sure was a song

**MassiveThief** (4): I guess some of the lyrics are funny but damn this is bland

**flavasavavandal** (3.5): please Zara have some self-respect for yourself and dump this guy and get rid of the squanks

**2dina3dworld** (3): I hope the waiter was into it!!!!

**akanewasright** (3): that opening line is just kind of an immediately “nope” for me, and then the melody is just dull as fuck… like Julia Michaels can do better than this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This sounds like a song you would hear at an Ultra Beauty but like really towards the bottom of the playlist after all the bops have already been added and they still need to hit a certain length.

**ernie** (3): kinda forgettable honestly, but the instrumental is nice

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): maybe play hard to get next time idk

**Vromega** (3): so repetitive and boring

**bulforster** (2): naur!

**frogaranaman** (1): "do you smell my [perfume]?" no he has COVID-19

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): your wife is naked. she is standing over you, staring at you with KFC. AND there's another girl upstairs in bed :o. BUT you don't care because you're just playing fortnite trying to get a victory royale!!! fortnite dance

**jordannimz** (0): Just break up with him already; he's not worth your time, Zara. And this song's not really worth mine. Sorry. I had to add a point to So Am I because I realized I liked it THAT MUCH MORE than this track.

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (7.9): This is a song I enjoy a lot more when I actually listen to it than when I’m just thinking about it. I’ll see it coming up on the tracklist and think eh and then I’m listening and like it just bops, but I also can’t complain about this having essentially always been day 1.

**plastichaxan** (5): This is kinda my second least favorite song in the rate

---

## Spreading rumours about how yass and slay this rate is

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it’s spelled rumours*

**hikk** (10): queen bringing back complextro she just gets it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): when she said "ruma ruma ruma"… poetry to my ears

**shipperondeck** (9.3): i have to admit that i admire her dedication to attempting to make dance bops bc i just realized literally all of these are dance bops

**1998tweety** (9): I love The Living Tombstones [2]

**BaconShoes** (9): I KEEP RUNNIN RUNNIN INTO YOUR ROOM

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): …This reads like the POV of one of those women who write love letters to serial killers in prison. Bops tho.

**jay duh** (9): CLAPBACK QUEEN. Ate you gays up trying to compare her to gaga like hello? Who has done more for the lgbt community between the two lets just be honest with ourselves

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is good too, albeit a tad generic at moments.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): love a slow down finger snap bridge. Fun production. Hate the intro.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): another song that could be better without a lackluster chorus I’m afraid

**afs** (7): how is this even more underwhelming than the lizzo one

**ImADudeDuh** (7): lizzo ended her, but this is better than the lindsay lohan song

**skargardin** (7): bop

**Stryxen** (7): roombas roombas roombas </3

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): what an ear worm

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): oh she loves repeating words over and over

## Not believing those rumours

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): stevie nicks (and also the rest of fleetwood mac) outsold again

**jasannn** (6): Playing with Fire Dance Part 2

**jordannimz** (6): I really love the harmonies in the prechorus, but overall the song is a bit forgettable. Like it's good, but not THAT amazing.

**Vromega** (6): One of the "too repetitive songs"

**starla\_** (5.8): Lindsay Lohan outsold

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): gave this a scrobble out of pity sometime last year I think

**akanewasright** (5): decently memorable hook, but I also kinda hate the way it sounds lol. Also this song drags at 3 minutes long I didn’t know that was possible

**celladonn** (5): So repetitive but not bad I guess

**CrimsonROSET** (5): spotify told me to guess the lyrics for this one and i think for the sake of my average i probably shouldn’t

**frogaranaman** (5): LIZZO AND CARDI B?????

**nlh1013** (5): this reminds me of the rah rah ah ah ah roma roma ma from bad romance

**notsomainpoplietoc** (5): the CGI hellscapes that look like they were cut from a failed adult swim pilot are fucking hysterical. Begets us such comments like "As a 32 years old music lover who can control his emotions....PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEAAAAAASE, LET THIS SONG BE THE NEXT SINGLE!! I really love this song, my favorite of the whole album. The video would be something futuristic like this lyrics video hehehe". gotta agree

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): lizzo is unbothered

**vayyiqra** (5): Someone else make the obvious Lindsay Lohan joke; I am tired of Ava by now and have nothing. I want this album to end.

**fairytalehigh** (4.9): ava skirts by with a lot of mid material just because her choruses are fun/hooky/melodic but this one's chorus is just not very good

**bulforster** (4.8): hmm

**thisusernameisntlong** (4.5): the repeating syllables thing Ava did with this album gets really tiring at this point

**RandomHypnotica** (4): alan walker energy (derogatory)

**ricki** (4): she was channeling her inner rah rah bitch

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i still refuse to believe ava is not british

**Ghost-Quartet** (3.5): she didn’t put any effort into this so I won’t put any effort into my comment

**static\_int\_husp** (3.5): Stevie Nicks did not single handedly save Fleetwood Mac for their best album to be associated with this

**fadedblue09** (3): Feels strangely dated compared to the rest of the album

**nicol(y)as(s)** (3): GEUREOKE MALHAEBWA

**seanderlust** (3): "who's gonna love you if it ain't me" uhhhhh yikes

**majid** (1): i have nothing to say about this song i just hate it so much it sounds like every song from the early ‘10s

## Well ok somebody believed them

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): all the rumours are true

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): I just can’t not make this bop

**plastichaxan** (4): And this is my least favorite song in the rate if anyone was wondering from my Rumors comment

---

## The kind of song that stays on your mind

**AHSWeeknd** (10): could’ve just said “I give great head” but no we need metaphors

**BaconShoes** (10): a permanent mark on my psyche as this song loops in my head

**jay duh** (10): YEPPPPPPP IM LIKE A TAT TEW!

**SmileAndTears** (10): that 'your heart' at 1:19 has an inexplicable effect on me. I bet this SLAPS live

**Awkward\_King** (9): slayteez did outsell but this song is really fun i hate to say it

**ernie** (9): a serve!!!

**skargardin** (9): How does she do formulaic cookie-cutter pop so well

**violet** (8.6): this song is tattooed in my head!

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute bop [2]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Ladies, if your man says no to getting your name tattooed on his right ventricle…dump his ass.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Corny but done with enough tongue in cheekness that it works

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): why are all of the writing credits Charlie has had since Voicenotes better than any of his solo songs

**afs** (8): omg she should totally collab with skrillex

**hikk** (8): slayyyter cleared just a tad i fear

**Stryxen** (8): why does ava max have a wiki and why does the page for this song say “Charlie Puth changed this song’s title from Black Shoes” like 3 times in a row.

**bulforster** (7.8): yass

**fairytalehigh** (7.6): it has this really spritzy 80s feel to the chorus that i love

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): I wish you were a single.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Perhaps it’s just because this follows my favorite song on the album but I always skip it

**shipperondeck** (7): overall i love her music but her lyrics truly are asinine

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this feels like the moment on the album where those comparisons to 2011 pop feel most true… as someone who loved that era I thought I would be more into this but its merely fine. Maybe nostalgia is real after all

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): this would be super basic without those woooOOOooo's in the background

## Desperately trying to erase her

**MToms** (6.5): The songs are starting to blend together now (5th of the album)

**anothertown** (6): teenage dream c-side

**pig-serpent** (6): I don’t have anything interesting to say about this song so I’ll accuse Ava of ripping off Def Leppard because the synth riff during the chorus of this song is similar to the guitar riff of Photograph.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): Jordin Sparks and Slayyyter both outsold

**majid** (5.5): this is a painfully mid song but i can’t help but bop

**starla\_** (5.5): speed up the tempo and this would be a 9

**akanewasright** (5): I really like the verses, but the chorus is just too Puth-y for me to get into it

**DaHumanTorch** (5): if this song was a tattoo it would be the press-on ones you get at summer camp that wash off within the day

**fadedblue09** (5): Sounds like a Gaga parody (some might argue that for all her songs but it's really apparent here)

**jordannimz** (5): It's ok, but it's my least favourite track from the first half of the album. Not bad, but nothing really stands out to me, and even more lyrically cliché than the previous song. Will still bop to it though.

**oscarbrierley1** (5): the lyrics are a no.

**ricki** (5): i know the songwriters were mad as fuck that this My Everything era Ariana song ended up in Ava's hands

**runaway3212** (5): this is kinda weird in a way I cannot explain

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i’ve heard this song 50 times before by random nameless pop girls in the gap

**arne** (4): this song flew by (not in a good way)

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i hate this metaphor so much

**ImADudeDuh** (4): jordin sparks really did the best tattoo song ever

**LesApfels** (4): Slayyyter outsold

**vayyiqra** (4): Ew. This is a quirk I don't expect anyone else to get, but I hate the idea of lyrics about tattooing, like a couple of Ariana songs, and more I can't think of. It irrationally grosses me out. Since I am not a huge baby I can kind of get past it, but it doesn't help this is just an okay-ish song.

## But it won’t come off

**RandomHypnotica** (3): did I not just hear this EXACT fucking song in naked ????

**static\_int\_husp** (3): this soiunds like it should be on the soundtrack to a teen rom com from 2002 (derogatory)

**seanderlust** (2.5): something about those synths screams "basic 2015 filler pop" so the fact that this came out in 2020 is still pretty funny

**2dina3dworld** (2): what’s with the late oughties electrotrash instrumental? It’s making my brain vibrate out of its casing

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): I hate skrillex

**notsomainpoplietoc** (1): "A tattoo worth getting over my soul a million times over and forever. Without question my loyalty is undying as is the love in my soul that crashes at the feet of a goddess they call my love obsession but to me it's cherishing the moments of each day and every second that you walk this Universe if only you were mines like stars wondering across time and space searching for a true path that is eternal."

**frogaranaman** (0): this. this is the song. I cannot overstate how much this song sucks. I hate everything about it. I hate how this metaphor is fucking dumb, I hate how this sample is lazy, I hate her voice in the song. I hate the dumb fucking haircut. I hate everything about this. I hate it here. someone kill me

Thedoctordances1940: ---

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): It’s a cute song but the Rick and Morty sample is a baffling choice at best. Without that I assume this makes day 2 quite comfortably, but then again getting to see people’s reactions to listening to it for the first time and being suddenly dumbfounded by the sample at the end might be enough to make up for that, at least a little bit.

**plastichaxan** (6): Damn rick and morty sample

---

## Have a solid grasp of theoretical physics

**jordannimz** (11): My absolute favourite song on this album. I'm a sucker for emotional ballads, for songs referencing outer space, for songs about crushing loneliness. The lyrics make me wanna cry, and the production is perfectly stripped-back and evocative. I've never watched Rick and Morty, but maybe I should.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This song makes me believe Madison Beer dated Rick Sanchez

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorite songs in the rate. Madison got a lot of flack for being faux deep but I think that she kinda nailed it with this one, I absolutely understand what she’s singing about here: The melancholy, the loneliness, the angst, the *bitterness* at the imagined people who don’t have to deal with it all, she captures it beautifully. Reminds me a lot of “Spaceship” by Kesha, another song with a similar sound and concept, or the song Gonzo sings in *The Muppet Movie*. Hate that she sandbagged this by putting the Rick and Morty clip in there.

**jay duh** (10): when you think about it the rick & morty inclusion in this song is actually very smart and kind of genius of her. The audio clip directly speaks about being on a different planet and feeling out of place. The rest of the song also discusses these topics and ultimately you need a certain level of intelligence to understand rick & morty and why it's easily one of the best programs ever aired on television

**jexan13** (10): So beautiful. I don't care about the outro skit, that is art.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i love the sense of longing in this song

**celladonn** (9): yass main pop girls Rick and Morty! In all seriousness I do really like the lyrics here

**welcome2thejam** (9): Big brain move to add a little twang to this alb oh my god this is the one that had the Rick and Morty outro wtf

**fadedblue09** (8.5): i love the Americana vibes but the metaphors are wild. And that outro choice 💀

**jasannn** (8.5): the rick morty snippet catches me off guard everytime

**nlh1013** (8.5): I really liked this one. I like the melody and guitar a lot, and the theme resonated with me as well

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): theres something cute about how sincere this song is. Like it shouldn't work for me but somehow it does.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): it’s a beautiful song that’s overshadowed by the jarring outro (Madison sweetie, your target audience is NOT composed of Rick & Morty fans)

**1998tweety** (8): this was camp

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): yass!

**anothertown** (8): this song is lovely and touches on themes of alienation better than Ava does but i get distracted from it about halfway through every time i remember the ricky mordy clip.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I can’t believe this lovely song ended on Rick and Morty

**seanderlust** (8): if she wanted to include that outro so badly she should have covered rick and morty by soulja boy after this


**thegolding** (8): Another peak of vulnerability on this album and one of her best songs lyrics-wise. Also, that 'Ricky and Morty' part. This song is just iconic.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): you know what, if you were to tell me that Madison Beer is just an alien who is trying to act like the perfect gen z adult, I’d believe you.

**sunsetspt1** (7): Great concept with an outro I don't care for

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): Ooh la la someone is going to get laid in college

Thedoctordances1940: ## Just don’t understand how deep it is

**Stryxen** (8): actually i kinda love this other than the… yeah… there’s a few moments that i just really like and it comes together really nicely until the… yeah

**babadork** (7.7): I still feel like I might not be taking off enough points for how vibe killing the Rick and Morty sample is.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): I like the kinda folky instrumentation on this one, it’s cute. Would’ve been better without the Rick and Morty jumpscare though.

**shipperondeck** (7.5): she's much better when she's doing less honestly. never mind is that fucking rick and morty

**letsallpoo** (7): dont ruin your song in its last 20 seconds challenge [IMPOSSIBLE]

**lillipup03** (7): Ok why are Rick and Morty here lol

**afs** (6.5): RICK AND MORTY??? -0.5

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): why the sample tho

**MToms** (6): I hate pop culture references in the actual recording, sorry, keep it for the video instead.

**ricki** (6): i know that in the outro is not what i think it is

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): I wanna rate this higher but I'm scared of Rick and Morty making Day 3

**TragicKingdom1** (6): honestly not a bad ballad until the jumpscare

**vayyiqra** (6): Please don't tank this for being acoustic. It's nice. [EDIT] Oh. The ending. Yeah okay, feel free to tank it for that.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): why???? Why did you ruin this song Madison????

**akanewasright** (5): I’m still so 😭😭😭 that she chose to include that tacky ass Rick & Morty outro

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): minus points for the Ricky and Morty outro

**skargardin** (5): this was the last place I expected to hear a Rick & Morty sample.

**cremeebrulee** (4.6): she’s so goofy love her

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): Not enough of an intellectual for this song.

**static\_int\_husp** (4.5): I liked most of this song but the rick and mort sample made me cut my score in half it's so unnecessary

**arne** (4): deducted one point for the rick and morty sample holy shit who thought that was a good idea

**astrologicalangel** (4): was that a fucking Rick and Morty sample? Am I going crazy?

**BaconShoes** (4): this is pretty (until the Rick & Morty moment), but not my vibe

**DaHumanTorch** (4): minus 2 points for using rick and morty

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): who heard this and thought "you know what this sad ballad about not fitting in needs? a sample from rick and morty!" i would like to talk

**majid** (2): -3 because of the rick and morty sample

**hikk** (1): oh girl. making this snooze AND making me hear rck and mrty at the end? who asked??

**jackisboredtoday** (1): oppress rick n morty stans

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): was gonna give this a 5 but then she played rick and morty at the end so i immediately gave it a 1 instead

**mayaSS 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩😜👩‍❤️‍👩** (0): for the fucking rick & morty in the end 😠

**notsomainpoplietoc** (0): cocteau twin reverb for a millisecond. could accidentally be mistaken for an obliquely memory holed piece of 4AD-core. and then OOPS has a rick and morty sample. all points were lost

## Humor was too subtle

**ernie** (6): this song is cute but i would skip this when i was listening to the album - not sorry

**bulforster** (5.9): hmm

**starla\_** (5.3): a bit...idk...overblown?

**frogaranaman** (5): "my parents said they met under the moonlight" that means they hooked up at a bar

**fairytalehigh** (4.4): actually NOT docking this for the rick and morty sample but instead "this ain't my people, ain't my crew, ain't my PLANET" like we get it girl you different

**nicol(y)as(s)** (3): this one is for the lana girlies

**pig-serpent** (2.5): I'm diggin the acoustic part of this song for one verse but after that it wears out its welcome and none of the other elements are adding anything. It doesn't help that the melody feels a little too obvious at times and it makes the song sound very cliche despite how unusual it actually is, and it just makes Selfish a slog to listen to right after.

## I thought Rick & Morty would be bad enough for that but sure

**Roxieloxie** (1): me when i keep misreading this title as homestruck so i tank it

## Nah, but here have your own section

**CrimsonROSET** (4): can you put this as the header of the rick and morty comment section
