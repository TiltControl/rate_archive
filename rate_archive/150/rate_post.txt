All 3 albums represent the not so main pop girls that have made us gag; the girls we love, or, depending on who you ask, love to make fun of.

\-*Ava Max* on coming out as an r/popheads rater

&nbsp;

Ava Max, renowned member of the Albanian Mob, has been writing and releasing music for almost a decade at this point, but it took a couple of years of rather infrequent releases before her career took off. The first song released from her debut album, *Heaven & Hell*, was — let me just check to make sure I get this right — …*Salt*? Yes, *Salt* was initially released on Soundcloud and YouTube back in July of 2018, just a couple of weeks before the song that finally took her career to the next level, *Sweet but Psycho*. 
  
&nbsp;

Originally only taking off in Europe, and contributing to the misconception that Ava herself is European, the song went on to become an inescapable worldwide smash that everybody loved, a song that absolute nobody will tank in this rate and is, apart from [dismantling a Dutch far-right party](https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/ava-max-netherlands-politics/), the most notable thing she has done in her career. The question on people’s mind was: how does she follow this up and can she carry the momentum forward into a successful career? The fact that she’s in a rate called Not-So Main Pop Girls answers that question.

&nbsp;

Ava’s first attempt at a follow-up song, *So Am I*, was by no means a massive flop, at least not in Europe, but it felt too much like a retreading of past waters to properly catch on. Following a few more singles that only made the tracklist of *Heaven & Hell* due to fan demand, she released *Kings and Queens*, just as the pandemic was starting to spread to most of the world and impacting a lot of the music industry. *Heaven & Hell* was one of many albums delayed in response to the pandemic, but I would argue that it was ultimately for the better, as it allowed her to restructure the album into two concrete halves, *Heaven* and *Hell*, before eventually releasing it in September of 2020. This was an incredibly bold idea, with her being the first person to ever release a concept album, but the watertight theming of the album is what has helped make it the not-so main classic we all know and love today.

\-*Madison Beer* moments after finding out she was being pit against Europeans in a rate


&nbsp;

Moving on from “looks European, is American” to “looks American, is American”, singer-songwriter Madison Beer, who first was signed at 13 when main pop boy Justin Bieber shared one of her YouTube covers, and after slaying her hater in the confrontation video, she ended up releasing a debut EP in 2018. She then began teasing her debut album with the release of *Hurts Like Hell*, which was later scrapped from the album, before *Dear Society* became the first official single, only for it to also be removed from the album’s tracklist, but finally, the official lead single, *Good in Goodbye* was released in early 2020.

&nbsp;

After this, Madison released *Selfish*, *Baby* and *BOYSHIT* as singles, as well as *Stained Glass* as a promotional single prior to the release of the album in 2021. After getting a few “not found pages” about how these singles did on the charts, we found that *Good in Goodbye* reached number 15 on the New Zealand Hot Singles, and *Selfish* reached number 19 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart, as well as charting in several other countries where charts don’t matter or something; however, these two singles were the only ones with this data available. Not very yass of the GP, but enough for her to earn the not-so-main pop girl title with her peers.

&nbsp;

The album was released in early 2021, as her debut, and received criticism such as “ambitious yet shallow”, “rooted in authenticity but still layered in artifice”, “seemingly intent on proving its own seriousness”, but most importantly, and the only one that actually matters: “just slays too fxcking much!!!!!!!!!!!!”. The album tackles on many personal issues for Madison, with her vocal delivery being one of the standouts of the album and further yassifying the experience of listening to it.

# Zara Larsson - Poster Girl

\-*Zara Larsson* on her boyfriend’s new obsession with rates

&nbsp;

It’s back to Europe for our third and final main flop girl, where we’re heading to Sweden to find the world’s [most prominent anti-bowling activist](https://twitter.com/yosoymichael/status/1449778350298484737): Zara Larsson. *Poster Girl* is the only non-debut album in the rate, with this being her second or third album, depending on if you live in Scandinavia or not. Her international breakthrough came with the lead single for her first international album, *Lush Life*, but she has largely struggled to replicate its success within her solo career since.

&nbsp;

*Ruin My Life* was the first single released from her follow-up album *Poster Girl*, but once again only saw limited success and even failed to top the Swedish charts. If there was one place Zara was going to consistently top the charts, it was in her home country, but none of the subsequent singles, including the scrapped-from-the-album-but-included-in-this-rate-anyway *Don’t Worry Bout Me* and *All The Time*, managed to reach that elusive number one spot. If you can’t get your singles to number one though, you can always rely on your album to get there, right?

&nbsp;

*Poster Girl* was released in early March of 2021 and, in its first week, failed to top the Swedish album charts, losing out to Swedish Rapper Ant Wan — no, I didn’t know Sweden had rappers outside of Drain Gang either — as well as the compilation for Melodifestivalen 2021, the Swedish Eurovision song selection competition extravaganza, even featuring the man who never quite lived up to his promise to become popular himself, Eric Saade. *Poster Girl* still released to mainly positive reviews but it failed to make any sort of lasting impact and officially relegated Zara to Poster Girl the of Not-So Main Pop Girls.

# Rules & Instructions

#### PLEASE READ THESE THOROUGHLY TO AVOID HAVING TO DEAL WITH ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR BALLOT LATER.

- **You must listen to and score every song in the rate.** Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.

- **Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10** and can include one decimal place but no more. So 7.3 is fine but 7.31 is not.

- **You may give one song in the whole rate a score of 11 and one other a score of 0** so, if you want to award these scores, save them for your favourite and least favourite songs in the rate respectively. 

- **We'd encourage you to leave comments** of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, **they must be in this format**, simply leaving one space after your score:
>Baby: 10 YASS 🐈‼️ her rhyming on on on with on on on.. a lyricist

Any other format such as:
> Sweet But Psycho: i sang sweet but psycho at karaoke 2 weeks ago with my male friend who i thought was straight but recently started going through a sexuality crisis...sweet but psycho was his most played song of last year (6.5)

> Poster Girl: 5: That ho-ly smokes lyric is earth shattering

will get your ballot rejected.

- If you'd like to leave a comment on any of the albums as a whole they must be formatted like this, leaving colon then a space after the album title:
>Album: Heaven & Hell: I can’t believe we let Rosalía copy her groundbreaking concept like it was nothing MOTOMAMI you will be dealt with trust

- **Your ballot must be formatted exactly like the template in the message link** so make sure you use it or the template in the backup pastebin for your scores to be accepted.

- **Your scores will not be confidential** and will be revealed, along with any comments, with your username attached.

- **DO NOT SABOTAGE** the rate by giving outrageously low/high scores for the sole purpose of skewing the results, we reserve the right to exclude any ballot we suspect of this. If you're worried your scores could be mistakenly perceived as such, all you need to do is leave comments explaining the reasoning behind them.

- **If you want to change any of your scores** or comments after you've already submitted your ballot, feel free to message us before the submission deadline to sort it.
