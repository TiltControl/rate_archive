[Hello Popheads](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/690/341/3c6.jpg)

 It’s currently February, which means It’s Black History Month[ …](https://rampages.us/jadamk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12819/2016/02/63572873693432972584207799_tumblr_m3h7h9TPc71qca3kho2_500.png) and what better way to celebrate it than to dive into three amazing albums. So sit back, take your mask off, and grab a nice cold [Pepsi](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/06/business/06xp-PEPSI/06xp-PEPSI-superJumbo.jpg) while I pass it off to my incredible Co-Host u/plvstvcbvrds to get us started

 In the Black community, it is a well-known tradition to [clean one's entire house on a Saturday](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6INNa0bCi9JfbWwXyLDbI5?si=x0M9UH3dQ_e8Gn5w3-5iSw). [Sweeping, mopping](https://me.me/i/kinfolk-kollective-knflkkollective-black-moms-saturday-cleaning-list-yall-bout-5920093), wiping down the baseboards, opening up windows and letting in a breeze past yellowing lace curtains.  Over the Texas hills and into perfumed houses with plastic covered furniture, hair greased with [Blue Magic](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81ZmLPvWyIL._SX425_.jpg), and crumbling concrete steps for Sunday pictures. This rate is for three of the most Blackity Black Black albums to ever Black. These are albums that reshaped genres, created impressive, spectacular imagery and audio, and  that will go on to define and inform generations of politics and art.  Kendrick, D'angelo, & Ms. Knowles are all important figures in Black culture, and right now we get to celebrate and enjoy that. Break out the [card tables](https://blavity.com/twitter-is-hysterically-trying-to-figure-out-why-black-people-dont-teach-the-uninitiated-how-to-play-spades?category1=news&category2=education) and your best deck, y'all.

**Cultural Context**

So before we jump into the albums, seeing as these albums are so intertwined with themes of blackness and black culture, there are various articles linked throughout the album blurbs that add context and information to a few of the topics here. They are of course not required in order to do the rate but they do add some context that I think would be beneficial to be aware of going in if you aren't all that familiar with Black (American) Culture

**Black Messiah - D’angelo**

D'angelo's Black Messiah album was released in 2014. It is his third studio album. 
It won Best R&B album at the 58th Scammy Awards. But this was his first studio album in 14 years, and came as a bit of a shock. He would guest star, but we hadn't seen new music from him in over a decade. What D'angelo had been doing instead was [building networks of artists](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20078-black-messiah/). He was guesting on other people's albums. He taught himself to play the guitar and worked on perfecting his craft, and then when he was ready, this album happened. And a "a slow-simmering gumbo finally boiled over", it was (Jenkins, 2014). This is an explosion of soul, flavor, spirituality, and Blackness. 
It's creative, it's full of love and culture and care. On songs like 'Sugah Daddy', he's playful, funky, and downright vulgar in his lyricism ("Can't snatch the meat out of the lioness mouth
Sometimes you gotta just ease it out"), but he always makes sure to pull back and let the instrumental breathe in [jazz tradition](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-018-0838-4). The entire album is an experiment in Black musicality and joy.

**A Seat At The Table - Solange**


To pull the curtain back a bit, when Solange released this album, it was right before the election of  That Man. But the [writing was on the wall](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bimadewunmi/what-is-america-so-afraid-of). I lived in the deep South at the time, and I was scared for my life. All of these uprisings had been happening,  but Black people were still being brutalized and murdered in the streets. All for wanting to have life, and liberty, and the freedom to exist without fear. Leading up to the election, Black people were terrified of the future. 
When this album dropped, it was like a community balm. Each song a hymn, a blessing, a mutual understanding, an act of care. Solange Knowles travelled the world, but she always came back to be inspired by New Orleans and Houston. The album explores themes around 
Blackness and Black bodies. She talks about anger and frustration, exhaustion, and even 
the politics of hair and bodies and touch. And she didn't do it for a white audience, even if they listen to her music. As she explained on FUBU, Black people are the backbone of pop culture and music at large, even as they are [rejected, ridiculed and brutalized.](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/blackness-as-a-commodification-cultural-appropriation-and-other-american-pastimes-642f6195a84d)
The showcase of [Black complexity](https://www.elle.com/life-love/a33251/there-is-nothing-wrong-with-black-girl-magic/) on this album isn't an accident. And as she boldly proclaimed, this shit is for us, by us.

*(Co-Host Note:) Also wanted to link these two additional articles related to this album, this [one](https://issuu.com/ajcwfu/docs/seatatthetablefinal) for the album as a whole and [this one](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/solanges-dont-touch-my-hair-is-an-anthem-reclaiming_b_57f67383e4b030884674abca?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADaRwh_9OfFDBjzqGOB9s6tWN0uJNLU6VFeTEwMtvbUl5K09n-XUa9W4a-_TORXqtoElx-6wlfFtOgEiEcqALY78F6qWracz_TU-03DMKv_yDUMV1GoMI9o5bXnNmUSuUPvguJnyWJbfU1i-eLs9LhubrZYiO0qD-2BZLubAHKRb) about dont touch my hair*

**To Pimp A Butterfly - Kendrick Lamar**

To Pimp A Butterfly. Whew. This album is an explosion of sound and culture. 
On this album, Kendrick explores themes of Blackness, money, sexuality, brutality and violence, 
and what it means to grow up in Compton. Inspired by a [trip to South Africa](https://www.essence.com/news/kendrick-lamar-dishes-inspiration-behind-pimp-butterfly/), Lamar explained that he wanted to create an album that explored Black unity rather than division. He wanted to bring the magic of his trip back to Black kids growing up like him who didn't know that their Blackness is something to embrace and love. He grapples with the complexities of being a famous Black man and what that means for his [masculinity](https://medium.com/cuepoint/to-pimp-the-black-woman-on-kendrick-lamar-s-limited-black-liberation-26d63d94cad) and understanding of himself. He pulls in jazz, gospel, and rock influences. He experiments with instruments and samples, having a veritable tour through Black music, movies, shows, and references. This is an album [not interested in explaining itself to people](https://www.wweek.com/news/2019/08/07/one-of-late-writer-toni-morrisons-most-famous-quotes-about-racism-came-from-a-talk-at-portland-state-university-listen-to-it-here/), and it shines because of that fact. Alright became and still is a [protest anthem](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/26/753511135/kendrick-lamar-alright-american-anthem-party-protest) for Black Lives Matter, the haunting mantra of *'we been down, we been hurt before'/ 'my knees getting weak and my gun might blow, but nigga we gon be alright'* to this day is chill-inducing. This album is a love letter to [Black resiliency](https://www.mhanational.org/blog/re-defining-resilience-perspective-toughness-bipoc-communities).

**The Rules**

First time doing a rate? Don’t exactly know how this works? It’s okay Here are the rules ~~that absolutely did not copy and paste from the last pandemic rate i hosted~~

-  **Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine so long as it is only 1 decimal place. Ex) 9.2 and 4.9 are good, 3.33 and 7.75 are not.

-  **You have to rate EVERY SONG in the RATE**. If you submit a ballot with just a few songs rated we will not be able to use it. If there's a mistake and you skipped a song one of the host will message you to get it fixed 

-  **Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.**Feel free to share them and campaign for your favorite song to win and bully those who are more tasteless than you

-  **You may give ONE (1) song a 0 and ONE (1) song an 11.** Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks.You **must** leave a comment for these.

-  **You can change your scores at any time!** Feel free to contact the host anytime after you submit before the deadline to change a score, and we will be more than happy to help you.

- **Don’t Sabotage**. You’re entitled to your own opinion on these albums but dont give an album a significantly lower average without any justification! For ex: Just because Solange Flopped last time in the rate does not mean you can redeem her at this rate by tanking D’angelo!

- **Make sure you use the prepared link** that can be found [here](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Roxieloxie&subject=Black%20Conscious%20Classics%20Rate%20&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Black%20Messiah%3A%0A%20%0AAin't%20That%20Easy%3A%0A%20%0A1000%20Deaths%3A%0A%20%0AThe%20Charade%3A%0A%20%0ASugah%20Daddy%3A%0A%20%0AReally%20Love%20Feat.%20Gina%20Figueroa%3A%0A%20%0ABack%20to%20the%20Future%2C%20Pt.%201%3A%0A%20%0ATill%20It's%20Done%20Tutu%3A%0A%20%0APrayer%3A%0A%20%0ABetray%20My%20Heart%3A%0A%20%0AThe%20Door%3A%0A%20%0ABack%20to%20the%20Future%20Part%20II%3A%0A%20%0AAnother%20Life%3A%0A%20%0AAlbum%3AA%20Seat%20At%20The%20Table%0A%20%0ARise%3A%0A%20%0AWeary%3A%20%0A%20%0AInterlude%20-%20The%20Glory%20Is%20in%20You%20Feat.%20Master%20P%3A%20%0A%20%0ACranes%20in%20the%20Sky%3A%0A%20%0AInterlude%20-%20Dad%20Was%20Mad%3A%0A%20%0AMad%20Feat.%20Lil%20Wayne%3A%0A%20%0ADon't%20You%20Wait%3A%0A%20%0AInterlude%20-%20Tina%20Taught%20Me%20Feat.%20Tina%20Lawson%3A%20%0A%0ADon't%20Touch%20My%20Hair%20Feat.%20Sampha%3A%0A%20%0AInterlude%20-%20This%20Moment%20Feat.%20Devont%C3%A9%20Hynes%2C%20Kelsey%20Lu%20%26%20Master%20P%3A%0A%20%0AWhere%20Do%20We%20Go%3A%0A%20%0AInterlude%20-%20For%20Us%20by%20Us%20Feat.%20Master%20P%3A%0A%20%0AF.U.B.U.%20Feat.%20BJ%20the%20Chicago%20Kid%20%26%20The-Dream%3A%0A%20%0ABorderline%20%2CAn%20Ode%20to%20Self%20Care%20Feat.%20Q-Tip%3A%0A%20%0AInterlude%20-%20I%20Got%20So%20Much%20Magic%2C%20You%20Can%20Have%20It%20Feat.%20Kelly%20Rowland%20%26%20Nia%20Andrews%3A%0A%20%0AJunie%3A%0A%20%0AInterlude%20-%20No%20Limits%20Feat.%20Master%20P%3A%0A%20%0ADon't%20Wish%20Me%20Well%3A%0A%20%0AInterlude%20-%20Pedestals%20Feat.%20Master%20P%3A%0A%20%0AScales%20Feat.%20Kelela%3A%0A%20%0AClosing%20-%20The%20Chosen%20Ones%20Feat.%20Master%20P%3A%0A%20%0AAlbum%3A%20To%20Pimp%20a%20Butterfly%0A%20%0AWesley's%20Theory%20Feat.%20George%20Clinton%20and%20Thundercat%3A%09%0A%20%0AFor%20Free%3F%20Interlude%3A%0A%20%0AKing%20Kunta%3A%0A%20%0AInstitutionalized%20Feat.%20Bilal%2C%20Anna%20Wise%20and%20Snoop%20Dogg%3A%0A%20%0AThese%20Walls%20Feat.%20Bilal%2C%20Anna%20Wise%20and%20Thundercat%3A%0A%20%0AU%3A%0A%20%0AAlright%3A%0A%20%0AFor%20Sale%3F%20Interlude%3A%0A%20%0AMomma%3A%0A%20%0AHood%20Politics%3A%0A%20%0AHow%20Much%20a%20Dollar%20Cost%20Feat.%20James%20Fauntleroy%20and%20Ronald%20Isley%3A%0A%20%0AComplexion%20A%20Zulu%20Love%20Feat.%20Rapsody%3A%0A%20%0AThe%20Blacker%20the%20Berry%3A%0A%20%0AYou%20Ain't%20Gotta%20Lie%2C%20Momma%20Said%3A%0A%20%0AI%3A%0A%20%0AMortal%20Man%3A%0A%20%0AEND) in order to make sure that your scores are formatted correctly.
