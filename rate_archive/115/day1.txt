Roxie: Ah the interludes, Noteably, when we rated When I get Home, the interludes were not included. Which makes sense, I get how it can be hard to rate not just a short song but just spoken word in general. We saw some absolutely divisive takes, some people rated these songs based on how much they enjoyed them ( which in some cases would be higher than the actual songs they were before), some based on the lyrical content of them and some of you just kinda decided to just give every interlude the same 5 or 7 which i guess?? idk you do you, anyway its not shocking that our first song out is an interlude.

PB: Y‚Äôall are a bunch of haters.

\---

**runaway3212** (10): Can these songs stop being so good

**akanewasright** (8): the interludes need help

**cremeebrulee** (7): ok intermission but the others in this album kind of outsold

**noctilucentvibes** (6): the avon lady....

**fadedblue09 (5.5**): Sonically, it doesn't blend well with the other tracks around it

**Junky?** (5): Just Rating Ever Interlude a 5 cause it feels weird to judge them LOL

**KennyEarthman** (5): inspiring

**nootnoot781** (5): avon lady? i just heard rihanna girl

**MrMoodle** (4): yeah this feels pretty pointless

**AHSWeeknd**  (3): Half of these interludes could‚Äôve been attached to the songs

This is the first interlude on the album and I personally think it fits in really well and introduces you to what you are about to to become apart through the album but again, the interludephobia won when it came to this

---

#All My Friends are Glorious 

**runaway3212** (10): you know what? spill king

**ReallyCreative** (9): phenomenal transition between Weary and Cranes!

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This transitioning into Cranes in the Sky. Perfection.

**akanewasright** (8): the interludes need help in this rate

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): The way that this transitions to Cranes in the Sky so perfect omg

**vayyiqra** (8): Neat but too short to rate, so I just gave all the interludes around the same as my album average.

**CarlieScion** (7): i dont know how to rate this so im giving it a very neutral 7

**cremeebrulee** (7): not my fave interlude here

**just\_thonking** (7): I mean it's 17 seconds long but it sounds nice at least

**waluigiest** (7): fantastic epilogue to Weary

**booksandplantsand** (5): he's right!

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): not me liking this more than the previous song


#Girl idk use your imagination 


**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This flows into the next track well (it‚Äôs a fun ironic juxtaposition) and the advice is solid but like‚Ä¶ how am I supposed to rate this lol

**pheromenos** (6): i'm not sure how to rate these interludes lol. i mean i enjoy them thoroughly because they're only 20 seconds long, but that's not really enough to assign them a score.

**plastichaxan** (6): ma‚Äôam this is nothing i

**skargardin** (6): I find this really hard to rate

**slimboyfriend** (6): well he's right

**ziggytvs** (6): i like this but i'm docking a point bc idky it wasn't just kept as part of Weary

**bigbigbee** (5): I like a lot of the interludes on this album, but this one is too short for me to know what to make of it, so it gets the standard ‚ÄúExactly What You Run From You End Up Chasing‚Äù interlude score of 5 from me.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): girl this is 17 seconds

**JunkyGS** (5): Just Rating Ever Interlude a 5 cause it feels weird to judge them LOL

**KennyEarthman** (5): "As long you find peace in what you doing then you successful" is amazing advice

**mudkip1** (5): i don't know how to rate any of these intermissions jdnvlskjdnvlk

**ReallyCreative** (10): gorgeous way to end the album

**akanewasright** (9): the interludes need help

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Those trumpets give it a fitting climactic flavor

**bigbigbee** (8): It‚Äôs perhaps a little unconventional, but I think this is a perfect cap to the album. It sounds like emerging from this experience and looking at a golden sun.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Oh dang, I was expecting a closing song. But this closing interlude is great and basically summarizes the underlying theme of the album that Solange is trying to send.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): damn this is such a good album

**rickikardashian** (8): i mean‚Ä¶.. out of all the interludes this sure feels like the one that deserved to exist the least

**ziggytvs** (8): near perfect capstone

**Awkward\_King** (7): ok THIS interlude is a 7

**booksandplantsand** (7): good note to end on!

**JunkyGS** (5): Just Rating Ever Interlude a 5 cause it feels weird to judge them LOL

**KennyEarthman** (5): a celebration of Black culture

Roxie: So here we have it our first song out, Its a little robbed but often are two part tracks in rates. However, The fact that yall just decided that d'angelo needed to be included into the interludephobia is lost on me

PB: I'm gonna fuckin fight all of youse.

## ________________________

## Used to get real high

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way he gave this song a part 2, mister d‚Äôangelo, i owe you my life

**kappyko** (10): this is the phineas and ferb of the album

**waluigiest** (10): it came back even stronger!!

**Awkward\_King** (9): the sequel is better

**cremeebrulee** (9): yeah its mostly a continuation of the first part but it bops idc

**fadedblue09** (9): Very flavorful and funky

**mysario** (8.8): ... you're gonna see some serious stuff!

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Always love more of a good thing! Docked 0.5 points from Part 1 cause I don‚Äôt totally get why this is here.

**skargardin** (8): for being basically a reprise this is great

**vayyiqra** (8): I love multi-part songs and reprises on albums and this is not an exception. There is some cool guitar on this too.

**runaway3212** (7.5): there's much better here

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): don't know if this unpopular, but I prefer this to Back to the Future Part I by a long shot

**KennyEarthman** (7): liked this better than Part 1 even though Part 1 had better lyrics

# Luck Just Ran Out

**bbfan132** (8): feels like an interlude but i still enjoyed it \[2\]

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): D‚ÄôAngelo was like ‚ÄúI want in on the interludephobia‚Äù

**MrMoodle** (7): I mean, it‚Äôs basically a simplified version of Part I so I feel I can‚Äôt rate it very high. But Part I was really good so it‚Äôs not like I can rate it that low. Maybe there was some lyrical development across the album here that‚Äôs going above my head and this part would really click if I caught that.

**ReallyCreative** (7): cute reprise but there are a lot of better interludes in this rate

**wavingwolves** (7): sequels are rarely better than the first

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I felt like this was unnecessary

**booksandplantsand** (6): nice little reprise

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): this is definitely a song that exists

Roxie: Also another great interlude, another one of my favorites that honestly deserves higher 

PB: did any of u listen to what he's saying 

---

**akanewasright** (10): the interludes need help (but especially this one)

**rickikardashian** (10): so we‚Äôre just going to let people give this low scores and let it go day 1 because it‚Äôs an interlude‚Ä¶ :peloton:

**runaway3212** (10): I'm honestly sorry for him I feel so bad

**TiltControls** (10): The piano leading into mad is pefection.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): honestly it feels weird giving this a score but i love this interlude in the context of the album + the piano is great

**bigbigbee** (8.5): The things that even extremely conservative Americans consider ‚Äúactual racism‚Äù (roll my fucking eyes) is still fresh in the minds of people who are alive today, and who are not even that old. Even if you know that on an objective level, I think that it‚Äôs sobering to hear it as a firsthand account from someone.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): god the history of this country is so ugly‚Ä¶ the present isn‚Äôt that cute either

**cremeebrulee** (8): im screaming @ this title

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Wait, is this her dad? I am kinda tempted to give this a 0 because of how he treated Beyonc√© and Solange. But he made points with this song. So fine, Mr. Knowles, here's an 8.

**mudkip1** (8): this one's good and leads into Mad so well

**vayyiqra** (8): The story behind this is really heartbreaking.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): racism is bad

**booksandplantsand** (7): excellent prelude to the next track

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Excessive interludes but they all fit the album.

**JunkyGS** (5): Just Rating Ever Interlude a 5 cause it feels weird to judge them LOL

**KennyEarthman** (5): the piano sounds so happy while the experience he's narrating sounds traumatic

**nootnoot781** (5): ? wait is this too high for an interlude???

Roxie: Back from the interlude hell, we have a song that alot of you also called an interlude???? I Guess, I think its a nice song. It also reminded you all of alot of songs so thats nice  

PB: ...i'm not mad, i'm just disappointed.

**kappyko** (10): this is going out day 1 and i am going to cry

**KennyEarthman** (10): sounds like music that my dad would play in a car

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): I usually don't like whistling but I really love it introducing the hook on this song

**wavingwolves** (10): ended that boomer band called the door(s)

**MrMoodle** (9): I think the whistling makes this lack some of the edge other songs on the album have but it‚Äôs still super great. Kinda got K.K. Slider vibes.

**bbfan132** (8): almost feels like an interlude - i like it quite a bit but still

**cremeebrulee** (8): love a good whistle song

**runaway3212** (8): Caroline outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): the whistling on this one reminds me of something from Animal Crossing

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this reminds me of the channel TV Land

**pat-rickstar** (7): It‚Äôs nice but on the lower end of the album for me, don‚Äôt find it that memorable

**ReallyCreative** (7): fine, but not for me

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Coming after Betray My Heart it feels a little repetitive

**RandomHypnotica** (6): This one is a little too twangy/country-ish for my liking

Roxie: Another Really powerful song out That I really hoped would do better!! I remember when this album came out and my mom would play it all time ,this being one of the first songs I really payed attention  to and realized that it had alot more going for it than just the funky instrumentals. 

PB: this is funky, sexy, well made music! ..the lack of taste y'all are showing 

---

**kappyko** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/292042312958083075/823625125202624562/unknown.png (all this aside a song like this shows how well written this album is)

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): and did he lie?

**runaway3212** (10): I don't know what he is saying but it slaps

**wavingwolves** (9.2): the harmonies at the end. that's all

**AHSWeeknd** (9): So subtly addressing a heavy message, absolutely brilliant.

**noctilucentvibes** (9): songs to play when you are experiencing unprecidented weather extremes

**MrMoodle** (8.5): Less boppy than some of the other tracks here but I'm reading the lyrics and it‚Äôs really making me feel like illiterate braindead weasel I truly am so high marks for that

**Alumineous** (8): The human condition, perhaps defined by Adam and Eve themselves. We consume. We take. We are egotistical. We rage war. Despite that, we are curious. We have morals. We have free will.

**bbfan132** (8): very good but not outstanding imo

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): really like the ‚Äúla‚Äù part but omg these lyrics are depressing, I shouldn‚Äôt have looked them up. I hate that this came out seven years ago but would be just as relevant if it dropped yesterday.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): erykah badu vibes

**cremeebrulee** (7): ohhh we love an anti-war/climate change song, i just wish it were a bit memorable

**KennyEarthman** (7): at this point I'm glad I have the lyrics on hand cuz it really adds a dimension to the songs

**ReallyCreative** (7): I really should like this one more, but it's too repetitive and the vocal delivery is grating after a while. The lyrics are great and the ending vocal harmonizations are pretty

**vayyiqra** (7): Really can't argue with these lyrics at all. : /

**ziggytvs** (7): nothing in particular to say except this ages like wine

**rickikardashian** (6.9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzAfTmC3It0

Roxie: I know this is just an interlude but honestly, this should've won the rate with a perfect ten average idc idc, The transition into this is actually perfect. This one probably did better because of that. 

PB: that white guilt kickin y'alls asses in the wrong direction.

#Appreciates a Killer transition 

**bbfan132** (10): the transition into this is perfect

**ReallyCreative** (10): a phenemonal transition, maybe the best on the album

**runaway3212** (10): This transition omfg

**akanewasright** (9): the interludes need help in this rate (plus this is a nice transition between tracks)

**CarlieScion** (9): normalize making interludes sound like actual songs!!!!

**cremeebrulee** (9): i mean they spilled

**pheromenos** (9): the transition is so smooth??? can't believe i'm giving the interludes significantly higher scores that the actual tracks lmao

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the transition for the last song is so good

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): ugh that transition

**AHSWeeknd** (7): These interludes are breaking my heart

**KennyEarthman** (7): the transition

#Kelsy Lu stans come get yall juice

**kappyko** (10): yeah this actually deserves a 10 because you literally cannot listen to DTMH without that horn outro. also wtf kelsey lu is on this?

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): the way that this emerges from ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Touch My Hair‚Äù is sooo good‚Ä¶ also Kelsey Lu is on this?

**vayyiqra** (8): I wish I had more context for this monologue. Also, Kelsey Lu is really good and needs more attention. While I'm here, Dev Hynes is awesome too. It's too bad they're only here in such a small role.

**wavingwolves** (8): everyone please listen to kelsey lu's album blood!!! it's so amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): This gets a higher score than all the other interludes just because of Kelsey Lu (even tho she's just backing vocals but idc)

#Does not feel the moment 

**ImADudeDuh** (6): it feels real weird to just rate interludes of people talking about race set to music.

**JunkyGS** (5): Just Rating Ever Interlude a 5 cause it feels weird to judge them LOL

Roxie: Im gonna keep calling ever day 1 D'angelo Cut robbed and you all are just gonna have to deal with it. This one absolutely pains me. This was top 10 very early on and then dropped a little but as the last batch of ballots started coming in It started falling. This was originally gonna be my 11 before I switched it. This song is so mesmerizing to me in a way I dont even know how to explain. Im not a really a religious person at all but everything about this is so raw and beautiful that you feel the emotion in it.

PB: hate crime

# Ideologically I Dont Agree With Organized Religion But They Kind of Went Off With Stained Glass

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I am once again crying in the club

**kappyko** (10): perpetrators beware say a prayer

**runaway3212** (10): This is just so enjoyable

**waluigiest** (10): wow this is delicious

**wavingwolves** (9.4): singlehandedly turned me into a christian

**bbfan132** (8.5): love the melodies here

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): really love the bass on this

**seanderlust** (8.2): it bops

**vayyiqra** (8): Ooh, this is really cool. It has this funky rhythm but also a kind of spooky melody behind it.

**booksandplantsand** (7): it's rare that a song centered around religion actually feels devotional and sincer, but I think he pulls it off

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this song almost makes me want to become catholic again (but then the trauma comes back)

#well

**ziggytvs** (9): really groovy and Prince-ly

**Awkward\_King** (6): is this the one people are calling prince just because it has a guitar :scream:

#Praying Your Scores Redeem Yourselves 

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): it's a prayer

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I like the inclusion of the church bell in this one, I kinda wish it was more frequent because it‚Äôs a nice change in sonics from the rest of the track. Not my favorite song on the album though, I appreciate the message but the lyrics feel more like a sketch than many of the other songs in the rate.

**ReallyCreative** (6): it feels a little like a four and a half minute interlude, but I do like how the beat feels a little offset. Not enough substance to really grab a hold of. In a rate this good, it stands out as a dud.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): this was good at first but kinda drags

Roxie: This is actually the true real robbery of today. Another banger that was top 10 before it sunk. I am persoally mad because apparently this was the song that sent everyone to genius???? Everyone sat through Aint That easy??? 1000 Deaths??? THE CHARADE??? and said brain closed but suddenly we get to this horny banger and everyone is suddenly a scholar with a degree in lyricism. Are some of the lines a lil hmmm? yes but kendrick literally started a song with a girl moaning!!! If you've given WAP a 9-10 and did not like this, Im bullying you

PB: I.......hate y'all. this song is unashamedly horny and based on your comments, you are too? why the disconnect?

##

# I was eagerly Anticipating to see if anyone would give this thier 11 the entire time this rate was open, this person finally did at the very end of the rate and I took physic damage from this, Im never gonna be able to think about this game again

**MrMoodle** (11): The piano riff from Wii Play‚Äôs Find Mii but make it a horny anthem, perfection

# People who can appreciate the art of a true funky banger

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was the only d'angelo song i'd heard before the rate and i think remains my favourite

**bbfan132** (10): the instrumentation here is perfect

**bigbigbee** (10): So playful and fun. I love whenever D‚ÄôAngelo uses vocal harmonies like this. Also the way they say ‚Äútossed and turned‚Äù tickles me so much.

**kappyko** (10): i had this song saved on my phone in middle school alongside really love and played it to death it was literally the coolest thing ive ever heard

**KennyEarthman** (10): funky. groovy.

**plastichaxan** (10): i am she

**runaway3212** (10): bopbopbopbop

**endcreditouilles** (9): ooooooh these horns, Roy Hargrove going OFF

**skargardin** (9): well damn

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Super jazzy

**Alumineous** (8): Actually, it's pretty self-explanatory, given the title. Groovy as hell!

**waluigiest** (8): these harmonies are so tight and lovely

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): really love the piano and trumpets here

**ziggytvs** (7): a nice jaunty tune

# Comments that mention Prince

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This is VERY Prince-esque, in all the right ways

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is very 90s prince but if he also loved horns

**AHSWeeknd** (5): giving me that Prince‚Äôs Sign O‚Äô The Times sort of jump from lyrics between songs but only Prince can pull it off

# Comment that mentions Stevie Wonder??

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Piano on this one kinda reminds me of the iconic ‚ÄúSir Duke‚Äù anyways I fully do not understand a word he‚Äôs saying here but the vibes are immaculate so I‚Äôm giving it a good score, hopefully they aren‚Äôt about something super dark and heavy and I‚Äôm making light of them.

**noctilucentvibes** (9): the music is absurdly good like possible 11 but some of the lyrics....... why

**ReallyCreative** (8): not the queef reference, it's funny tho

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a real bop. The last verse is ... odd but it's still a good song.

**CarlieScion** (7): i hit it so i made the pussy fart, so true king

**celladonn** (7): Ok so this is incredibly funky and probably deserves a higher score but I just can't with the slapping sounds and the lyrics are a bit much for me lol

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): "I hit it so I made the pussy fart" lyric cards that look like shitposts teas

**seanderlust** (6): great instrumentals, but the references to cribs and other baby things, making references to spanking the subject two separate times in the song, the lines about making the pussy fart......lisasimpsonstaringatherplate.jpg

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (5): not a pussy fart

**booksandplantsand** (4): appreciate the honest horniness but the lyrics don't work for me

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): The baby metaphors make me really uncomfortable.

Roxie: God we were doing so well with D'angelo, if you've talked to me(roxie) about rate stuff I've probably ~~bullied~~ lightly suggested that you should Listen to D'angelo the most when submitting, He was very strategically placed as the first album in the playlist for this reason and yet, as time went and more and more people sent in, he started doing worse and worse. This is by far the biggest offender of the vocals being more muffled than the track, but considering what the song is about, it feels almost intentional in a way.

PB: y'all: PB call us racist too much!1!! yeah well look at this placement! and tell me i'm wrong!

**Alumineous** (11): D'Angelo is almost indeciperable here, as if his voice is coming out of a tinny speaker. Thus, it reminded me of war, where your ears would ring and eventually get lost due to the constant gunfire. And of course, shellshock. Using this warridden atmosphere so carefully coloured by D'Angelo only pushes the spoken word intro: the fight for peace does not come without sacrifices, without struggle.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the absolute power in these lyrics.

**akanewasright** (10): The samples in the beginning alone justify this score

**bbfan132** (10): love the bass here

**CarlieScion** (10): THE GUITAR

**fadedblue09** (10): Really ominous and indignant, matched by the constant buildup throughout.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): any song that opens with the condemnation of whitewashed jesus is a 10, it also helps that its got a fcking great guitar solo at the end

**kappyko** (10): the intro to this song kicks me in the ass down the stairs and i'm left with a dislocated jaw and i would let d'angelo do this to me again and again

**MrMoodle** (10): THE ELECTRIC GUITAR. FUCK ME UP.

**runaway3212** (10): This is so effortlessly great

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The intro and the ending are absolutely amazing

**skargardin** (10): wow this is incredible

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): I kind of wish the vocals were a bit more prominent in the mix here, but idc because the song is so good otherwise

**seanderlust** (9.2): but really this opening is a great point. Jesus was born in modern day Palestine but he looks like he could be a stunt double for Chris Hemsworth in Thor? okay.

**stickywheels46** (9): Damn this track sounds dirty and chaotic, like mud being flicked in my face, Amazing.

**vayyiqra** (9): Damn, these are good lyrics. Unfortunately Khalid Abdul Muhammad (the man talking in the first speech that's sampled) wasn't a great guy but still, this song is awesome.

**waluigiest** (9): the intro is everything

**wavingwolves** (8): the way this made me think my earbuds were broken gave me the biggest rush of adrenaline i've felt in months

**ziggytvs** (8): great sample and whoever is shredding deserves a raise

**pheromenos** (7.8): the instruments are lovely

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): I like a lot of what's going on in this song, but the vocals are way too quiet on the verses, and eventually the chaotic repetitive production gets tiresome. The chorus is great though.

**rickikardashian** (7.8): i like the guitar but it took me way too long to realize that there were lyrics that werent spoken words

**cremeebrulee** (7): its hard to decipher the words from this unfortunately so i don‚Äôt have much to say (i did genius it fyi but yeah) but i will say that intro spilled there is NO way jesus was white like most people imagine him to be lmao

**Awkward\_King** (6): this is hyperpop

**booksandplantsand** (6): for the opening sermon but the rest is too fuzzy for me to really make sense of

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I can barely understand the verses idk why he chose to use a weird voice restrictor thing. The band sounds good tho

**KennyEarthman** (6): it's so chaotic yet it works at some parts

**pat-rickstar** (6): I like the instrumental but not how the vocals are mixed here sadly

**celladonn** (5): This is a challenging listen, I was challenged by it

#Do you know how hard its gonna be to get D'angelo to be rated again??? You really mean to tell me that this is the only reason D'angelo will not be able to join the list of artist with no 0s??? are you kidding me??? I hate it here
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (0): too abstract for me. it makes me anxious for some reason

Roxie: I Only learned the story behind this song recently and its haunting. I highly recommend  going to read about it. I dont have alot to say about it other than its really great.

 PB: I joked about leaving after this rate. I'm less joking now.

**kappyko** (10): the transition from the last song to this is like the dajgnafjajfsajfjsajfajdjsd

**ReallyCreative** (10): me to my besties when we get lost in the gay bathhouse on our first night out post-COVID

**runaway3212** (10): The emotion, everything it all comes together so perfectly

**bbfan132** (9.5): absolutely love the production

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Her voice is haunting and soulful at the same time, which fits the subject matter very well.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): this is also what they call a "jam"

**noctilucentvibes** (9): i love how heavy that drum in contrast to the lightness of the album

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): so pretty

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): God, I can't imagine how painful it is to be forced to go away from a place that you proclaimed home for so long because of some fucking racist assholes. This is really sad.

**cremeebrulee** (8): the backstory to this song is heartbreaking but this song is so freaking good

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): [Um, read the backstory for this song on Genius](https://genius.com/Solange-where-do-we-go-lyrics)

**MrMoodle** (8): I was so excited by the piano intro, it sounded like we were about to get a mega bop and then I was sorta let down especially after that super exciting interlude. I mean, considered independently it‚Äôs still one of my favourite songs on the album but I was feeling super hyped and then it was just pretty low key.

**vayyiqra** (8): Wow, the backstory behind this song is unbelievably tragic. Look it up if you haven't.

**booksandplantsand** (7): sad and musing

**KennyEarthman** (7): this feels so melancholic

**AHSWeeknd** (6): oMG a BilliE EILish Inspired song üòç??/? cATch ME waiting FOR WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP /s... not sure why I said that but this production is great.

Roxie: Ah, and here we loose our first Intro Track! This song Is really great but I will admit out of all the openers this isnt my favorite but I do really enjoy it. The run from this to cranes is also just amazing


PB: This is such a beautiful song. From start to finish, just pretty, well-thought out, and lovely to listen to.

#Rising from the ashes of the RNB Girls rate

**Awkward\_King** (10): i like crumble

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): great opener and one of my faves from this album

**mudkip1** (10): these two tracks just hit different!!! her vibe is magical

**mysario** (10): we love an intro :)

**runaway3212** (10): obviously

**wavingwolves** (10): genuinely love this as an intro and as a song

**seanderlust** (9.3): when I die, instead of burying or cremating me the normal way, lay me to rest in the harmonies when they sing "rise". just tuck my body between the third and the fifth and set me on fire, thank u

**bbfan132** (9): great intro to the album!!

**kappyko** (9): i just realized now how loudly the bass is mixed here i don't mind but omfg i was actually shaken

**ReallyCreative** (9): a great way to open an album, please avoid introphobia

**skargardin** (9): This is actually such an amazing moodsetter of an intro

**waluigiest** (9): the swells and bass hits and just overall shape of this song are completely magnetic

**booksandplantsand** (8): omg this is a fabulous intro

**cremeebrulee** (8): she sounds lovely here

**pheromenos** (8): it's a nice, mellow intro. i enjoy it.

**rickikardashian** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXbtfjuxsac

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): a nice intro

**KennyEarthman** (7.5): short but sweet

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): wish it was longer!

**wryn\_** (7.5): I might just give all the interludes and mini tracks a 7.5 by default, they all serve an important purpose but I don't think any of them are better than the other

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): That fake-out ending got me

**AHSWeeknd** (7): It‚Äôs like this ethereal introduction to an experience

**CarlieScion** (7): a cute lil intro

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): It's kind of repetitive lyrically but this is a good opener.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Solange must have really liked this one because it felt like her whole next album was just chasing this vibe‚Ä¶ it suffers from the same issues that *When I Get Home* had (sparse, repetitive) but also shares its strengths (immersive, somewhat hypnotic).

**vayyiqra** (7): I gave this a 5 the first time I heard this - why? Maybe because it's so short but it's good anyway.

Roxie: And Here we have it, our last Day 1 cut! I love both back to the futures so much and im sad that this had to be cut today but so is the way of rates I guess.

PB: What an effortlessly funky song. Love it!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh my god

**kappyko** (10): this is the rick and morty of the album

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): bop

**seanderlust** (9.2): the shape i'm in lyric...cheeky!

**bigbigbee** (9): This song reminds me of Cuphead

**cremeebrulee** (9): most songs about fame kind of go over my head but i like the strings in the background

**skargardin** (9): this is so funky

**mysario** (8.7): once this baby hits 88 mph...

**bbfan132** (8.5): the intro reminds me of animal crossing

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Really like the production and melody on this one but it gets repetitive, I wish it had more of a build or a journey.

**MrMoodle** (8.5): "so if you're wondering about the shape I'm in I hope it ain't my abdomen that you're referring to" ouch me in quarantine

**CarlieScion** (8): too real

**ReallyCreative** (8): the abdomen line was great

**runaway3212** (8): this starts out weak but after the start it gets very good

**vayyiqra** (8): Wow, that one line about him being out of shape in the lyrics has a really tragic backstory behind it. It's about D'Angelo being shamed by the media because he was once successful and incredibly fit but over time became an alcoholic and a bunch of awful things happened to him. I recommend reading about it here: [https://www.spin.com/2008/08/dangelo-what-hell-happened/](https://www.spin.com/2008/08/dangelo-what-hell-happened/)

**waluigiest** (8): I too want to get back to the way it was

**wavingwolves** (8): the way both this song and the movie of same name touch on incest more than necessary

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the cousins line really threw me off but otherwise this is amazing.

**ziggytvs** (7): tremendously groovy, i really like how this track starts with vinyl crackles and pops

**booksandplantsand** (6): i like the way the production and the lyrics match exactly

**KennyEarthman** (6): "So if you're wondering about the shape I'm in, I hope it ain't my abdomen that you're referring to"... cheeky
