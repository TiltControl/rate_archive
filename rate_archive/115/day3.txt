Black Consciousness Classics - Rate Reveal Day #3 ‚Äì We Are Not Going to Be Alright
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mf842u/black_consciousness_classics_rate_reveal_day_3_we/

Welcome to the final day of the BCC Rate Reveal! Today we‚Äôre counting down #16-1! We potentially might be looking on in horror as an interlude beats out multiple full length, critically acclaimed songs because you all can‚Äôt read or listen. Anyways. u/roxieloxie will be DJ-ing for us again, so please, heap her with praise, she‚Äôs the best co-host one could ask for. The party starts at **(3:30PM CDT/4:30PM EST/1:30PM CDT**), about an hour from this post going up! Be there or be square like one side of Ava Max‚Äôs wig. Raters beware, say a prayer if you dare!

Roxie: Our first day 3 cut! I forget alot about this song until it comes up in the trackilist but its really nice! Alot of you agreed as it got a few 11s which is always nice to see.

PB: this song is amazing. 
 
---
 
#Moonlight, your my starlight

**1998tweety** (11): im levitating
 
**ReallyCreative** (11): the fucking SimCity synths/guitar/whatever the fuck that is combined with her vocals, OBSESSED!
 
**TiltControls** (11): When we did the TTPT for Solange a few months ago I gave number 1 to Cranes, with this in close second. Before starting the rate I figured I'd stay the same and give Cranes my 11 too, but upon relistening something about the track hit different. I don't even fully know what it was, but once those first few notes started playing I knew this had to be the 11.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): There are no words to describe this production. This album is such an experience.
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): oh this shit is stone cold I absolutely love it
 
**CarlieScion** (10): this is so unsetteling, but in a good way? like it sounds how anxiety feel
 
**fadedblue09** (10): Probably the most poppy song on the album with those synths, but her vocals are the one that take this to another level.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): ‚ÄúThey say I changed / but what a pity if I stayed the same‚Äù holy shit, probably my favorite lyric in the whole rate
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): love the change in production style here and the harmonies are absolutely gorgeous
 
**kappyko** (10): oh i get it wishing well
 
**KennyEarthman** (10): "They say I changed, but a pity if I stayed the same."
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this song is so underrated
 
**bbfan132** (9.5): the production on this album is excellent
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9.5): probably one of the more overlooked songs from this album
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): the production on this is INCREDIBLE
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Ohhh I love the production of this so much.
 
**pheromenos** (9): especially LOVE that intro, the instrumentation is top-notch on this one
 
**skargardin** (9): so stunning
 
**ziggytvs** (9): i cannot lie, this is the first track to make me sit up and take notice in a while
 
**bigbigbee** (8.5): Airy and pretty ‚Äì I love the tense synths running through it.
 
**wryn\_** (8.5): Twigs vibes? Very nice
 
**seanderlust** (8): love the instrumentation on this one
 
**vayyiqra** (8): I saw some comments about how underrated this song is and couldn't agree more. Popheads had better not sleep on this just because it's slower or whatever.
 
**mudkip1** (7.5): i really dislike the way the song opens but the rest of it sounds so pretty
 
**runaway3212** (7): honestly the only 'miss' here
 
**Awkward\_King** (6): lowkey this feels more kelela-esque than the actual kelela collab

runaway3212: Not popheads serving tastelessness one song into day 3 already
[/r/popheads/comments/mf842u/black_consciousness_classics_rate_reveal_day_3_we/gsm6yx9/]

=====

ReallyCreative: I really need to stop throwing my 11s away on vastly superior songs too tasteful for the rabble

Roxie: Hearing this song for the first time Is absolutely an experience. Honestly the more I listen to this the more I love it. I cant believe this is out over tina told me.


---
 
#Genius.com owes us commission 

**Awkward\_King** (10): THIS DICK AINT FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
 
**bbfan132** (10): the best interlude i‚Äôve heard, honestly
 
**bigbigbee** (10): At first I thought ‚ÄúHAH, this is great but too weird to give a ten.‚Äù Then I listened to it like four times in a row and I was like never mind this is perfect
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): unironically this is so good omg . the uncle sam metaphor alone warrants this 10
 
**endcreditouilles** (10): TITTY JUICE AND PUSSY LIPS
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): lowkey this is also an 11
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended that Drake and DJ Khaled collab
 
**mudkip1** (10): the jazz instrumental is gorg
 
**plastichaxan** (10): this dick ain‚Äôt freee
 
**runaway3212** (10): Doja Cat release Aint Shit challenge
 
**seanderlust** (10): "this dick ain't free" - kendrick making an onlyfans
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): I know it's just an interlude, but this might be my favorite song on the album because it gives me whiplash
 
**waluigiest** (10): I think about this interlude literally all the time
 
**whizzer0** (10): living for the instrumental... also the whole thing
 
**wavingwolves** (9.5): girl: "i need that brazilian..." me: is that a motherfucking BRASIL reference???
 
**AHSWeeknd** (9): This production is insane, but I can‚Äôt help but laugh
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This interlude is just too iconic that there has to be a music video that perfectly explains what the song is about.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Onlyfans anthem‚Ä¶ you know why I‚Äôm giving this a 9‚Ä¶
 
**kappyko** (9): it is groanworthy whenver people fixate on the "THIS DICK AINT FREE" line not because this song wasnt meant to be funny because it absolutely was but because it reminds me of how so many gross racist internet people used that line to dismiss this album
 
**KennyEarthman** (9): the way he says free elevates this track
 
**ReallyCreative** (9): a really fun interlude
 
**stickywheels46** (9): From a technical standpoint, this is arguably one of the best rap songs of all time
 
**vayyiqra** (9): Tbh him saying "this dick ain't free" is funny but also this track is wild with the bebop track he's talking over and the complexity of the lyrics touching on themes about gender roles and capitalism. I can see why it's his favourite on the album.
 
**wryn\_** (9): First time I listened it was funny, 20th time it's kinda heartbreaking
 
**ziggytvs** (9): she's so right and she should say it, actually
 
**rickikardashian** (8.5): i love everything in this track so much‚Ä¶ except kendrick himself
 
**CarlieScion** (8): first time I listened to this I thot it was just a ¬´Why Women Deserve Less¬ª-anthem lmao
 
**letsallpoo** (8): the weird noises that start around 1:56 sound like an ocarina of time enemy
 
**skargardin** (8): Interludes are always a tough one to score, but this is admittedly a great one
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love how this sounds like an interlude in musical where the band is growing crazy and there‚Äôs a weird monologue over the music

#Uncle sam on speed dial 
 
**booksandplantsand** (4): I know that it's not misogynistic it's a metaphor but I really don't like it :/

Roxie: Back in January, I predicted this would be the first D'angelo song out due to balladphobia. Its really beautiful and stunning but I did not think it would be one of the last d'angelo songs in. Im sad its this low, but there was also a point where it wasnt here at all so Ill take this over that

PB: Come outside! I'm not going to hit you, I just want to talk! :) About :) Your :) Balladphobia :)

#So baby pull me closer  

**Awkward\_King** (10): i was trying not to give out too many high scores because i like to actually give my scores some weight but fuck even on this album that i didnt think would click with me as much this is another 10 it's such an epic but sombre closer
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): feels like a daydream in the best way
 
**CarlieScion** (10): a really damn good closer
 
**endcreditouilles** (10): ugh can't get over how good this album is, I've been missing out
 
**fadedblue09** (10): Couldn't ask for a more climactic closer. Reminds me of the classic D'Angelo sound.
 
**kappyko** (10): so it turns out i rated this album based on how much i want dangelo to fuck me out of 10 while listening o these songs
 
**MrMoodle** (10): I hadn‚Äôt heard a single D‚Äôangelo song before this album and now I think I‚Äôm in love with him
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): fantastic closer, I wish the rest of the album sounded a bit more like this and Ain't That Easy
 
**runaway3212** (10): amazing closer
 
**seanderlust** (10): I just wanna take you with me/To secret rooms in the mansions of my mind -- mmm. Great closer.
 
**skargardin** (10): ok vocals
 
**waluigiest** (10): a beautiful closer. The harmonies are the cherry on top
 
**wavingwolves** (10): wish god gave me another life so i could live longer to enjoy this song for more time....
 
**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): This is a really nice closer
 
**bbfan132** (9.5): very enjoyable outro to the album!!
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): i‚Äôve mentioned this in the comment for next lifetime in the neo soul rate but i love songs that tackle the right person/wrong time so this is right up my alley. i think it‚Äôs gorgeous and a nice way to end off the album!
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): a strong closer to the album
 
**KennyEarthman** (9): nice closer for a nice album
 
**slimboyfriend** (9): I'm in love with this Prince-like falsetto that closes out the song
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): LOVE the lyrics of this one, I find them so touching, but unfortunately the final two minutes of this fall kinda flat for me. I was expecting something more for the climax of the final track, this either needed to be bigger or more concise because the weird middle ground underserves its potential.
 
**vayyiqra** (8): The sounds on this track are so rich with the guitar, piano and sitar adding their own layers. Some might have trouble with it being six minutes but I think it's a really strong closer.
 
**ziggytvs** (8): i started crying?

#I guess ill see you next life time
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): a nice little closer, but I can‚Äôt help but think it should‚Äôve reflected the greater theme of the album.

Roxie: I cant believe this is the song that everyone said 'you know what let me retire from my interludephobic ways' Is it amazing? Yes? But seeing this beat out, at once point in the rate literally d'angelo's entire album, was painful. Someone gave this an 11 at one point and i literally cried seeing this jump to top 10. 

PB: Everything aside. I'm so proud to be Black. Regardless of the bullshit, I love my Blackness. Tina, Solange, Bey, and all of Destiny's Children taught me.

#:noitstrue:
 
**akanewasright** (10): the interludes need help (but also Tina is spot on)
 
**Alumineous** (10): Truer words have never been spoken.
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): she's right and she should say it
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): i mean she spilled
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Ms. Tina Knowles made points here.
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Perfect.
 
**fadedblue09** (10): My favorite interlude on the album, and probably the best in the entire rate.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): omg she got Beyonc√©‚Äôs mom for this track! And she absolutely spilled, everything she says here is pure facts and I wish more people could just wrap their heads around this concept. I feel like they could if they weren‚Äôt so scared of the implications
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait, Tina went IN on this reverse racism sh!t
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): we love education!
 
**rickikardashian** (10): :noitstrue:
 
**runaway3212** (10): She sounds so confident and proud here
 
**skargardin** (10): this is the best of the interludes i think
 
**TiltControls** (10): Another perfect lead from interlude to song and also has a fantastic message said beautifully
 
**waluigiest** (10): this interlude SNAPPED and I think about it constantly
 
**wavingwolves** (10): outsold the other interludes
 
**pheromenos** (9.5): Tina speaks facts though!
 
**seanderlust** (9.4): SPILL tina
 
**Awkward\_King** (9): it feels weird to give an interlude a 10 but if i were to give any a 10 it'd be this one it's so well said
 
**bigbigbee** (9): I really liked this interlude. The sentiments expressed in it maybe don‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúnovel‚Äù advocacy in the era of the internet, but coming from this woman who is probably much less ‚Äúonline‚Äù than we are, it feels very raw and honest. This interlude is a reminder that just because a sentiment might seem widely expressed in your own bubble, there are a lot of people out there for whom it is not the case. The activism of people who precede us is important to think about, acknowledge, and respect.
 
**CarlieScion** (9): seemless transition, great theme
 
**KennyEarthman** (9): the part about "White History Month" hit hard
 
**ziggytvs** (9): go awf mama
 
**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): spill queen
 
**vayyiqra** (8): based
 
**AHSWeeknd** (7): This is so powerful. Tina Lawson a legend maker.
 
**slimboyfriend** (7): it's not a song, but she's right!
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): everyone needs to follow tina on instagram

#Now im not mad because if this song got higher I would've cried, but you could've at *least* dont an a 7 or something
 
**JunkyGS** (5): Just Rating Ever Interlude a 5 cause it feels weird to judge them LOL

Roxie: This song is really hard to listen to, but It's supposed to be. I do agree that this is one of the harder songs in the songlist to rate just because its intentionally supposed to make you feel as uncomfortable, you can rate it based on how it makes you feel or how well its executed. This song was one of the few songs out today that was actively in day 1. This was originally Kendricks first song out until the sheer amount of 11s came out and dragged this song back up to day 3. So shout out to yall. This song is also just another painful cut, Its the **only** other 0 we received and its the first one we got after a string of really high averages. 

PB: :) 
 
---


 
**\_SoulGlitch** (11): This is honestly such a powerful song and I was left in tears after it ended. I listened to it for the first time doing this rate and was just left speechless. I wish I didn‚Äôt relate to the lyrics as much as I do.
 
**bbfan132** (11): don‚Äôt have a good comment to write about this, just listen to it
 
**cremeebrulee** (11): ok this track is a MASTERPIECE . in a good timeline this is kendrick‚Äôs highest ranking track. i love that kendrick includes a mirror to ‚Äúi‚Äù because self-love anthems are usually so one-dimensional and it‚Äôs so refreshing to see a song tackle depression in such a dark and real way. ugh it‚Äôs so good it‚Äôs so good
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (11): This is just too fucking dark, man.
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (11): The JOURNEY this song takes ugh!!!!! what a masterpiece https://i.imgur.com/QONVIyz.gif
 
**lobo\_generoso** (11): im not even sobbing i just feel all the pain ive ever felt all at once...
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (11): just amazing
 
**noctilucentvibes** (11): eleven because it made me emotional af
 
**skargardin** (11): holy shit this hit me so unexpectedly and hard as hell
 
**wavingwolves** (11): works both like a punch in the gut and a nice hug
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): An album highlight.
 
**akanewasright** (10): This was hard to listen to for all the right reasons.
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): absolutely no words. what an amazing piece of art
 
**frogaranaman** (10): this song will probably get paid dust but oh my god, this is probably Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs best lyrically written song, like, ever
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Curious to see how this track will do because it‚Äôs not often we have songs in rates that feel like they‚Äôre intended to make the listener uncomfortable, which Kendrick definitely does here. His voice and the way he just like, vomits the words out is so in-your-face and unusual but that makes it so powerful and memorable‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs borderline camp, there aren‚Äôt a lot of people who could pull it off like this.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh this is extremely fucking personal.
 
**kappyko** (10): Bop!
 
**MrMoodle** (10): The fact that he‚Äôs not afraid to have voice cracks and screech his vocals at points adds so much emotional intensity to this song like fuck
 
**runaway3212** (10): omfg this is literally so immaculate
 
**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This raw unpacking of Kendrick‚Äôs self-loathing and regrets is gut-wrenching. I‚Äôm in awe of how he REALLY goes there emotionally, and how his dark catharsis paves the way beautifully for the hopefulness of ‚ÄúAlright‚Äù.
 
**seanderlust** (10): file under: songs that are great but are honestly kind of painful to listen to
 
**stickywheels46** (10): Kendrick isn't rapping on this track, he's performing, this shit is god damn art
 
**Awkward\_King** (9): Uwu
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I remember crying when I first heard this song. Man, the amount of self-loathing was so uncomfortable, but in a good way. It fits so well to the context of the album where Kendrick's character suffers a huge existential crisis about his identity as a Black man who made it as a hugely successful rapper. But that success came at the price of him selling his soul, which eerily explains the title of the album.
 
**KennyEarthman** (9): I felt the emotions in this track
 
**slimboyfriend** (9): If u can't hate urself, how u gonna hate somebody else?
 
**fadedblue09** (8.5): Very dramatic and intimate delivery, and I love the jazzy instrumental
 
**ReallyCreative** (8.5): while it's not my favorite, the emotions are palpable
 
**celladonn** (8): Such a personal and harrowing song that it becomes a little hard to listen to
 
**vayyiqra** (8): This hurts to listen to knowing he's talking about self-loathing and depression which is something I'm too familiar with. :sad:
 
**waluigiest** (8): the second half of this song carries so much emotion it‚Äôs difficult for me to listen to it
 
**just\_thonking** (7.5): I feel like the song has a lot of meaning to it, but listening to it is just not an enjoyable experience tbh
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): this may be the most controversial song in the rate me thinks... kendricks voice is very raw here and it‚Äôs quite stripped back. I think this works very well with the lyrics of the song but it‚Äôs not exactly a pleasant listen for me.
 
**ziggytvs** (7): sue me
 
**mysario** (6): this has always been my least favourite song on the album because his delivery feels weird for an incredibly personal song
 
**rickikardashian** (6): now why did he have to make the housekeeper latina :peloton:...


# :peloton: 
 
**mudkip1** (0): this felt so scatterbrained, it kinda hurt my ears when the sound kept switching between ear channels

Roxie: I have alot of mixed emotions on this song that once again, lean more towards a convo I'd like to dissect in a diaspora studies class rather then popheads. I do wish track wise the first part and the interview would've been seperate cause I do like the song part more and i wouldn't have to average my score. But its not a song I hate in anyway. Another song Im shocked ended up doing pretty well. This stayed out around top 10 until the end

PB: what roxie said, but again, with a lot more anger and a pardison fontaine level 'bitch' at the end. a full throated, your entire lineage feels it 'raggedy bitch' at the end. 
 
---
 
**pheromenos** (11): i don't have much to say because i'm too feeble-minded to fully comprehend this song, but it's transcendental and i loved it so much more than i thought i would (especially when i first saw the duration lol)
 
**vayyiqra** (11): There is no way this song is winning, but I feel like I have to give it my 11 anyway because it left more of an impression on me than anything in this rate. It sums up the themes of the whole album and musically was fascinating the first time I heard it, because of its experimental structure. I know Popheads hates long songs and is not going to be in the mood for a seven-minute coda to a five-minute song, but it's brilliant how Kendrick at last finishes the poem he's been reciting throughout the album and then has a lengthy dialogue afterward that dissects the kind of things he was talking about in it. This song is one of a kind and something special.
 
**bbfan132** (10): stellar ending to one of the best albums
 
**bigbigbee** (10): This would have gotten my 11 if it hadn‚Äôt been for King Kunta. I cannot say enough good things about this. I LOVE the last spoken bit; it makes me very emotional, and I genuinely enjoy re-listening to it. Parts of this album remind me very much of a play, and this track steers into that the most. Finally hearing the poem that‚Äôs cropped up in pieces through the album feels like an emotional release, as it brings all of the themes that he‚Äôs explored together. This closer makes me feel comfortable sitting in silence with myself after the last word lands. It‚Äôs just a perfect closer.
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): what a song. what a thesis. fucking incredible
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This has got to be the most ambitious culmination of a concept album of all time.
 
**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): More albums need to end with a 7 minute long interview
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): what an incredible way to end an album, honestly.
 
**lobo\_generoso** (10): pac... pac...
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this song will probably place low because of its length but to me this is honestly one of the standouts of the album - the moment when it all comes together. the bit at the end where kendrick calls for tupac with the music crescendoing never fails to make me emotional :(
 
**mysario** (10): this isn't a true 10 to me since the whole track is too long for my attention span but the concept and execution are too good to NOT give it a 10
 
**plastichaxan** (10): eat the rich king
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): there's so much to unpack about this one but it's such a fascinating artistic choice, I don't really know what else to say about it, the build up at the very end... there are no words
 
**runaway3212** (10): a perfect closer to a perfect album
 
**skargardin** (10): what a perfect outro
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): Wow I almost cried when he explained the album title at the end.
 
**TiltControls** (10): interested to see if this will be too long for some, cause the 12 minutes? All worth it
 
**wavingwolves** (10): gays don't have enough attention span for this but i do
 
**ziggytvs** (10): this is genius and almost my 11. the back half of the track is so soothing; I love kendrick's speaking voice and this is a poignant conversation
 
**wryn\_** (9.5): that last 'pac?' is one of the most powerful musical moments of all time idc
 
**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.2): There‚Äôs a lot going in in this 12-minute track, it‚Äôs hard to give just one score. The tribute to Nelson Mandela is powerful, and I like the message of not giving up on people who are challenging the status quo when it becomes inconvenient to support them. However, the dismissal of Michael Jackson allegations is‚Ä¶ uncomfortable. Regardless of feelings about that particular case, It‚Äôs not betraying someone‚Äôs important legacy to acknowledge that they may also have done fucked up things. A better example of how Michael was let down might be the mockery of his mental health issues until his death, when everyone suddenly respected him. The spoken word outro is required listening. Kendrick‚Äôs imagined interview with Tupac is moving, and the poem that brings the whole album together is my favourite part.
 
**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): The Tupac interview was really interesting to listen to, but I've never been a big fan of when this sort of stuff is attached to a track, because it kills the replayability (especially since the interview lasts over half of a 12 minute track) This would be a 10 without it
 
**Awkward\_King** (9): i have reached my conclusion and ok yes racism is definitely bad
 
**CarlieScion** (9): a really good fucking outro
 
**endcreditouilles** (9): man what a way to close such an artful & cohesive album.
 
**fadedblue09** (9): I just wanna say how that "interview" is so cleverly executed.
 
**seanderlust** (8.8): tupac really said "you know what? I think we ARE going to eat the rich."
 
**noctilucentvibes** (8.7): this is so hard to rate because it's so got so much going on üò≠
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): I really wish the later part of the track was a separate one because I would've rated that conversation between Kendrick and Tupac a 10 alone. But nonetheless, this is a perfect way to close the album that has incredible rich storytelling through music.
 
**KennyEarthman** (8.5): the interview with 2pac
 
**celladonn** (8): A long track with a lot going on (I really don't know how I feel about that MJ lyric) but ultimately it ties the album together in a pretty brilliant way
 
**ignitethephoenix** (7): this isn‚Äôt really a song but I think it‚Äôs a very nice closer to the album
 
**JunkyGS** (6): I still find the tupac conversation cringe sorry....
 
**AHSWeeknd** (5): It‚Äôs probably just me, but the album should‚Äôve ended with ‚Äòi‚Äô. Even though this one is a discography highlight.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I listened to *To Pimp A Butterfly* for the first time years ago and this track really stuck with me, I‚Äôve thought about it a LOT and have many thoughts on it that are long and rambling and I go back and forth on it a lot but when pushed to give it a score for the rate, a five felt right. Generous even. I don‚Äôt think that this track is unsuccessful, he says a lot of interesting things and raises some good points, but there‚Äôs this weird air of‚Ä¶ egotism (I guess) about it that kinda puts me off. I respect his confidence and his work certainly backs it up but his demands for unwavering loyalty really make me raise my eyebrows‚Äì especially once he brings Michael Jackson into the equation. I understand the nuance of what he‚Äôs talking about because society does have a way of tearing down powerful black men, but no one is above reproach and so I can‚Äôt say that I really agree with the call to action here. The ‚Äúconversation‚Äù with Tupac at the end also gives me pause, as a theatre person I don‚Äôt really have the grounds to judge his decision to include a real life figure in his work because it‚Äôs a common narrative device but I never like hearing clips from dead people being used posthumously in different contexts, regardless of the intentions it feels gross. Also sorry to say it but the poem at the end is corny.
 
**rickikardashian** (5): I'm just kinda uncomfortable by the concept of taking voice memos of a dead man to make it seem like you're interacting

Roxie: So fun fact! D'angelo did not have a single 11 in this rate until Runnaway sent in their ballot with an 11 for the charade... 27 days into the rate. Hate to see it. I eventually ended up giving this my 11 because its the song that grew on me the most during the rate. Honestly I do think this song is extremely underrated here, its one of the most political in the rate and ~~I think it suffered a bit from people not knowing the words~~ this song was sitting at number 12 for a while and it wasnt until the very last ballot sent by none other than kappyko that this finally got to number ten. 

PB: it's just a good song. if you can't see that, i can't help you. hunt down that same camp that camilla went to. 
 
---
 
#Watching kappy spend 6 hours debating his 11 choice knowing he had the power to get this to number ten physically pained me 
**kappyko** (11): okay in middle school i used to always get youtube advertisements of this album that featured the opening vocals and i was so entranced by that specific moment and i never knew what song it was for a while then when i found out what the song was i loved it but not quite as much as sugah daddy or really love? but the more i listen to this album the more i realize this is actually the greatest achievement in recorded music history
 

#Great taste

**runaway3212** (11): It's so incredible how great this is, the buildup, the everything I love it so much
 
**ziggytvs** (11): this is beautiful. i dig the subtle sitar(?) and the way the song swells. i originally gave this an 8 on RYM, but i f*cking love this
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why am I crying in the club
 
**akanewasright** (10): the ending of the song alone... chefskiss
 
**Alumineous** (10): Damn, this is very relevant.
 
**bbfan132** (10): the music combined with the lyrics‚Ä¶ excellent
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): holy shit that chorus is chilling
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): if i had an 11 for this album its probably this song cause holy shit did this make me so sad on a first listen. ‚Äúall we wanted was a chance to talk / stead we only got outlined in chalk / feet have bled a million miles we've walked / revealing at the end of the day, the charade‚Äù probably top 3 lyrics in this whole rate. i‚Äôll be heartbroken if this gets done dirty
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): "All we wanted was a chance to talk, 'stead we only got outlined in chalk."
 
**fadedblue09** (10): I love the rock influences and the message is well-delivered.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): my favorite from the album, just a perfect combination of lyrics and sound
 
**pat-rickstar** (10): One of my favourites on this album for sure
 
**RandomHypnotica** (10): "All we wanted was a chance to talk, 'stead we only got outlined in chalk" hit really hard, wow
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): a poignant bop
 
**skargardin** (10): This really is so powerful
 
**TiltControls** (10): The song I keep come back to most outside relistening for the rate. Perfection.
 
**vayyiqra** (10): I love everything about this, the lyrics, the bassline, the sitar, the drums. The best track on the album, I think.
 
**wavingwolves** (10): bop
 
**whizzer0** (10): Listened to this again after looking up the lyrics and liked it a lot more.
 
**seanderlust** (9.6): "All we wanted was a chance to talk/Stead we only got outlined in chalk" GOD
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.2): the way the 'revealing at the end of the day' sounds so good
 
**pheromenos** (9): definitely the best song on the album for me
 
**KennyEarthman** (8.5): "Degradation so loud that you can't hear our cries" is an amazing lyric
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): an important message, just wish the verses were a little wordier
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): Ohh this is definitely the first song I totally like in this album. The lyrics are very politically charged and the production here is so good. It's like I am vibing in a music bar.
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (7): ugh these lyrics

#Im personally haunting you
 
**CarlieScion** (6): it drones on a bit on, very repetitive but i think thats the point?

Roxieloxie: # Black Messiah

---

**Overall Average**: 8.203 **// Average Controversy:** 1.288

---

**kappyko** (10.083): i guess i'll make this point HERE because it's obviously the album where it's most relevant but apprehension towards approaching these albums always confuses me because on every album there's songs that are either really sonically accessible or lyrically universal in some way. black messiah is inherently a political album but it is also chiefly an album about love in all its forms. the writing is so charming and reminds me so much of the '70s soul i love, the music is just moment after moment of FUCKJFJHFJHJF, and i'm glad i relistened to this as much as i have because iasjgahgdhaghadghadghdajgdjagjdajgadjgdjgjadjgdajga.

**MrMoodle** (9.458): The album I was least familiar with going in, I was really not expecting to love it this much. Every instrumental is so detailed. It doesn't have my highest average in the rate, but I think this still might be my favorite? The climaxes of some of these tracks are heavenly.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.375): This was the album that had to grow on me the most, but it‚Äôs so worth it. The musicianship on display is just stunning and the lyrics are required reading. I love how D‚ÄôAngelo balances being deeply serious and playfulness.

**runaway3212** (9.250): This surprised me by being so fucking good, I expected it to be clearly the weaker album but that wasn't the case

**fadedblue09** (9.083): I enjoyed this album quite a lot! I like its blend of vintage neo-soul, and rock influences, with tinges of jazz and funk throughout. Though honestly, I felt the need to rate this differently from the other two since it‚Äôs not as focused on social issues, but rather it‚Äôs more of a confessional record exploring love and vulnerability. Regardless, I‚Äôm happy to have discovered this album and I can say that D‚ÄôAngelo earned this comeback.

**whizzer0** (9.000): completing my character arc from the Women of Neo Soul rate by becoming a D'Angelo fan

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.917): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ecdp7SkXYAATS89.jpg

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.917): I enjoyed this album a lot more once I got used to D'Angelo's voice being muffled on certain songs.

**buddhacharm** (8.750): I'm gonna be deadass...part of the reason why I got into the album was because I found D'Angelo sexy as fuck üòî To my pleasant surprise, the album is literally...fucking amazing. The album is such a moment on every level and gets better with each listen. While the other two albums are genuinely two of my favorite albums of all time and thus have resonated with me on a deeper level than Black Messiah has, I still think this album is fantastic and is a total showstopper

**skargardin** (8.583): I'm glad that I've been introduced to D'Angelo through this rate. Definitely want to check out his other albums as well.

**seanderlust** (8.517): This album was the newest of the three, meaning that when it came out I gave it a couple run throughs but hadn't re-visited any of the songs. Upon a deeper dive, I like a lot of the material presented here! The atmosphere feels hazy and lingering. There are several standout moments through the album. My one critique is that a lot of the tracks can feel a bit same-y, though I like that same so idk how much of a critique it is really. I think a lot of the diversity of sound lies not so much in the tempo or attitude or atmosphere or anything but how the instruments are played, which can be subtle on first listen. Overall, glad I got the opportunity to dive in here.

**plastichaxan** (8.467): i feel like this will be very underrated in a lot of ways, and while there are moments in the album where i‚Äôm not fully immersed in it, this is extremely powerful and i‚Äôm glad i got to listen to this

**TiltControls** (8.458): Was less familiar with this album coming in, but it's all really great!

**hikkaru** (8.208): I hadn't heard anything from this before doing the rate and I saw that a lot of people were saying it was the "worst" (heavy emphasis on the quotation marks) album in the rate but I ended up really liking it, the funk/rock influences in the production are so good. I fear some people might come for the vocal delivery and vocal production but personally I think it fits the style incredibly well.

**BookyCats** (8.208): 9.5

**pat-rickstar** (8.125): I'm glad I persevered with this one because it absolutely was hard to get into at first but it's grown on me a lot. Reading the lyrics was almost necessary to make sense of what the songs were about, that helped me appreciate the album a lot more.

**ReallyCreative** (8.092): This was very much not the kind of music I normally listen to. It's an interesting and well-constructed album, but it's very obviously the weakest in this rate for me. I love what goes on in a couple of these songs but they don't feel indicative of the album as a whole? I'm also just not a fan of D'Angelo's voice I think, he's just not my thing. While I liked individual songs more than I like this as a project, I see why it's regarded as a classic. At the end of the day this is still a great album next to two phenomenal, near-perfect ones.

**vayyiqra** (8.083): This album is very solid and I hope Popheads respects the musicality that went into it. Before being into pop I was into other genres like classic rock and jazz and I hear a lot of funk on this, but also other moments that remind me of Jimi Hendrix or even Miles Davis (and I see critics picked up on these influences too). As well, I play drums and have always thought Questlove is a great musician, so he and the other backing musicians are stellar. This is probably the least political album in this rate but the lyrics still have quite a punch - there is one song that is about a climate apocalypse, and of course being made around the time of the Ferguson riots must've shaped a great deal of the album. I also find the religious themes and metaphors about warfare (something Kendrick also talks about on his album) to add a lot of weight to the lyrics. This was the only album in the rate I had never heard before and was a good introduction to D'Angelo's music. I will be going back to it soon.

**KennyEarthman** (7.833): really different from my usual music taste. I appreciate it

**celladonn** (7.708): I've given this album 3 listens and honestly I think it's probably one that requires more to fully acclimate to. Definitely some brilliant stuff on here, as well as some that might be a bit beyond my taste

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.417): this is imo the weakest album in this rate but still has some very good songs

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.358): this was the only album i hadn't listened to prior but i really liked it!!

**AHSWeeknd** (7.333): This production is so good. It‚Äôs a masterpiece.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.000): Reading up some context about how the album was made and how it's D'Angelo's first album in 14 years made me appreciate this body of work a bit more. Overall, this album is alright but I really don't see myself listening to this album often compared to the rest of the albums in this rate, which are more to my palate as a music listener.

Roxie: I, like yall ,cant believe obamam put this on his pr playlist when the song before this drags him for filth
 
---
 
**bbfan132** (10): great features all over the album, and especially here
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favourite songs lyrically, the story of how Kendrick converses a homeless man who turns out to be God is fantastic. Love the reflection on greed and selfishness here
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): its cheap at the dollar store but wow is it expensive if i want to buy an app for .99 cents
 
**kappyko** (10): obama's favorite song of 2015 was the song that came right after the song that literally addressed him by name?? like how does the us president even respond to that kind of song
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): immaculately constructed, interesting and compelling from start to finish, an 11 in most other rates
 
**runaway3212** (10): Slay me this is so good
 
**seanderlust** (10): a masterclass in storytelling
 
**stickywheels46** (10): The storytelling on this is unmatched
 
**vayyiqra** (10): One of the best songs on the album because of its narrative and how vividly he describes this story. Everyone has been in that situation of wanting to help a stranger and feeling guilty because you can't (or in his case, he doesn't want to at first). Kendrick talks a lot about feeling selfish and hypocritical on this album and he is brutally honest with himself.
 
**waluigiest** (10): the storytelling and journey in this song is phenomenal. I am blown away by his ability to write explicit narratives that feel real and beautiful rather than awkward and heavy handed
 
**wavingwolves** (10): billionaires existance is in itself a crime against humanity [2]
 
**bigbigbee** (9): This song is a gut punch. In the last place I lived, cruelty and animosity towards people experiencing homelessness was unfortunately very common and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about that. I don‚Äôt know. This one hit me hard.
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): the transition from hood politics into this is just ‚Ä¶. mwah
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): God, I love the storytelling in this song. The plot twist where the poor man revealing himself as God? William Shakespeare is shaking from his grave right now.
 
**fadedblue09** (9): Masterful, heart-wrenching storytelling yup yup
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love a good story track and this one keeps me at the edge of my seat, it‚Äôs practically a modern biblical parable.
 
**skargardin** (9): kendrick is just such a great storyteller
 
**wryn\_** (9): activates my dormant inner christian for 4 minutes
 
**AHSWeeknd** (8): the power in this, heartbreakingly beautiful
 
**KennyEarthman** (8): the plot twist omg
 
**letsallpoo** (8): obama really had the nerve to put this on one of his pr's playlists huh
 
**booksandplantsand** (7): this song is harder to listen to but I think that's because it asks a hard question

Roxie: Literally such an amazing song. I wish it would've done better but Its absolutely a great point to start with the 9 averages 

PB: I remember the first time a white person touched my hair. And I think of all the time I spent watching bad BET movies while my grandmama greased my scalp in her dusty ass living room. And I think of the love and care that Black women put in their hair. I think of weathered fingers braiding nappy hair. And I just have to exhale that anger away so it doesn't consume me. A lovely song, an intelligent testimony to an unspeakably violent act. 
 
---
 
**mudkip1** (11): this has always been my favorite song from the album. the delivery is otherworldly and i'm so obsessed with the music video. we don't deserve this album it's such an absolute work of art
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don‚Äôt know how Solange does it, her work is powerful.
 
**akanewasright** (10): I really, really hope this makes the top 10, but I don‚Äôt trust racistheads at all at this point. This song is perfectly produced, written, and sung, but this also feels like a song that will get a bunch of middling scores with microaggressive comments. Anyway... this deserves top 10 easily, and would be a serve of a win, even if I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll get there
 
**bbfan132** (10): i love solange
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): let's just take a moment to appreciate this masterpiece
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this is an 11 contender / winner right here. this was the first solange song i ever heard so i really love it and i think it‚Äôs such an important song for non-black people to hear and understand. (also scream bc someone tweeted this song is about taylor and there‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs true)
 
**fadedblue09** (10): Black feminism in song form
 
**kappyko** (10): the first time i heard this was my freshman year of high school when the student government president played it on the school intercom(?) speakers. literally magic
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): the production! the vocals! the trumpets! the last 30 seconds!!!
 
**runaway3212** (10): queen tell them off
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): sampha is king
 
**waluigiest** (10): honestly I needed someone to teach me this lesson in elementary school when I let the other kids pet my Afro like a dog because I didn‚Äôt have any idea of how I should be treated and respected
 
**wavingwolves** (10): chefs kiss
 
**ziggytvs** (10): i was considering scoring this a 9 but then Sampha's backing vocals made me see the light
 
**MrMoodle** (9.5): mmmph that outro is gooooooooood yes yes
 
**seanderlust** (9.5): the horns on this heart eyes
 
**wryn\_** (9.5): Sampha is a jewel. Nothing but appreciation for Sampha here
 
**Alumineous** (9): I remember this interview of several Black people living in Japan and this was a common thing that Japanese men did. They would touch any Black women's hair without permission. And for some reason, they didn't think it was wrong. That's what this song reminds me of.
 
**vayyiqra** (9): I really like this instrumental and it's awesome to hear her duet with Sampha too; I've been meaning to listen to him more after liking Process a lot. A very talented guy.
 
**CarlieScion** (8.8): gorgeous vocal runs
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Love the messaging of this one but it‚Äôs not my favorite musically, I get what Solange is going for with the in-your-face repetition but it leaves me kinda flat. This is barely related to the song but did anybody else watch *Bad Hair*, that horror movie that Hulu did with Kelly Rowland about evil weaves? It‚Äôs not perfect but I had a lot of fun with it, I would recommend checking it out.
 
**KennyEarthman** (7): the symbolism
 
**stickywheels46** (7): This hair is my SHIT!

Roxie: This song Is really amazing I couldnt even be mad that this was the one everyone got stuck on repeat while trying to do this, its honestly that good.

PB: sexy, soulful, well-made music. 
 
---
 
**akanewasright** (11): GOD, what a good song. Like, in every damn respect. I love a good concept in a song, and this uses that slinky fucking beat to its fullest power, creating a narrative out of it. There are so many good 11s on this album and I feel like this one is among the most basic (like this, alright, and the single version of i if it was here), but it deserves to go far
 
**Awkward\_King** (11): it is just... the best written song i have ever heard. the multiple meanings, the poignancy, the elocution in writing it is insANE. it's a fucking 24 episode long series in a song
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): Among all of the songs in this album, this is the one I always tend to repeat the most. The production was supposed to be like a vibe but the lyrics are just so sad and morbid as Kendrick's character commits revenge on the man who killed his friend by having a sexual relationship with this man's wife. This act of revenge, among all other things, obviously led to his breakdown in the next song. This is literally brilliant storytelling in a song. And this is the best way I can explain why I am giving this song my 11.
 
**stickywheels46** (11): Wait, this song is about pussy? I thought Kendrick just really appreciated interior design
 
**YouBuyMeOrangeJuice** (11): there's so much to love about this song. Anna Wise's beautiful intro that leads into Kendrick's verses with that excellent hook all strung together by Thundercat's excellent production that leads to the absolute mic drop at the end that brings the whole song full circle. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
 
**bbfan132** (10): lmao i was thrown off when i first heard the intro to this‚Ä¶ apparently it‚Äôs partially a saxophone too? love that
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): there is a very short list of men allowed to talk about pussy and he is on it. ALSO amazing wordplay as always
 
**buddhacharm** (10): These Wa11s? Jk I had to give it a 10 but this song is truly masterful
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): idk what is they put in this song bc i was streaming this like CRAZY last month. no joke i made no progress on this rate because i got to this track and then got distracted and looped it. i mean i‚Äôm not surprised this is a fucking BOP
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): is this disco??????
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song the first time I heard it, it never grabbed me but wow I‚Äôve been obsessed with the song recently. It‚Äôs probably Kendrick‚Äôs most sensual song and has an amazing groove. I love everything about this song (especially the chorus and guitar) but I really love how it goes from a song about loving a women to something much darker when you get the full story.
 
**kappyko** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/292042312958083075/823612444400156672/image0.jpg
 
**pat-rickstar** (10): The "woah oh oh oh" after the chorus is so satisfying
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): this close to taking my 11 I swear it's a 10.5
 
**runaway3212** (10): I just love this so much
 
**seanderlust** (10): one of the easiest 10s in this rate. also shoutout to the callback to GKMC.
 
**skargardin** (10): such a simple metaphor and yet there are so many layers to this song, obsessed
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): hauntingly beautiful
 
**waluigiest** (10): This song is an epic. It is a painful, beautiful, fantastic journey
 
**wavingwolves** (10): just sounds like a piece of heaven
 
**BookyCats** (9.6): U: 7.2
 
**AHSWeeknd** (9): Kendrick doesn‚Äôt miss, pure genius.
 
**slimboyfriend** (9): SEX
 
**vayyiqra** (9): There is quite a contrast here between Kendrick talking about his guilty feelings and the funky backing track. That is what makes the song, though.
 
**wryn\_** (9): I used to be too repressed to listen to this lol
 
**ziggytvs** (9): some crude joke about my walls

**lobo\_generoso** (7.3): the ellen performance would be like a 9, and the moans make me uncomfy every time tbh

Roxie: Another really interesting one that is another f.u.b.u conversation but everything about this song absolutely works in a way that I really do love to see.

PB: This song is....it's more than just being lyrically amazing. It's an untouchable record. Kendrick at his best, and I say that as an OG fan. Absolutely killer. 
---
 
**booksandplantsand** (11): the build to that final verse...
 
**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Addressing a serious topic and you can really feel the aggression in this one. And the beat absolutely goes off in this one.
 
**sarcasticsobs** (11): could not imagine giving this less than a 10 even if it ended after the first verse
 
**steelstepladder** (11): It‚Äôs an impossible decision to pick just one song to give an 11 to on TPAB. At the end of the day I think the Grammy performance might have broken the 5 way tie in my mind but this could have gone any way to me.
 
**wryn\_** (11): if this doesn't make popheads top 10 of all time i will be enraged
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): Chilling. I‚Äôm always at a loss for words with this one
 
**bbfan132** (10): a masterpiece
 
**celladonn** (10): WOW!!!
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): banger banger banger i wish i had a second 11 to give this to. kendrick does ending lines so well and this is the #1 example of that
 
**fadedblue09** (10): The centerpiece of the album. It ties all of its themes together into a full circle.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): I feel like there are some songs that assigning a numerical value to them in an r/popheads rate is a bad thing and intentionally takes away from the art of music. This is one of those songs.
 
**MrMoodle** (10): Kendrick‚Äôs delivery is unmatched on tracks like this
 
**runaway3212** (10): this is so fucking amazing
 
**seanderlust** (10): kendrick calling himself a hypocrite https://i.imgflip.com/26wvib.jpg
 
**skargardin** (10): this is pretty fucking monumental
 
**stickywheels46** (10): I can feel the palpable rage through my speakers, this track is a furious masterpiece
 
**vayyiqra** (10): Some of Kendrick's heaviest lyrics, this song is kind of uncomfortable to listen to at times (I mean verses about slavery and genocide) but of course that's the point. Kendrick did not hold back here.
 
**wavingwolves** (10): flawless
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): the last line of the song ... whew. there‚Äôs so much to take in with this track. Genius lyrics really pulling through when I need it and gives me a whole new found appreciation for his lyricism
 
**KennyEarthman** (9): the storytelling
 
**ziggytvs** (9): diabla blanca imma let you finish

Roxie: 1/2 of the songs I was really afraid would end up sweeping placing here! Honestly this was tied for second for the end of the rate, its course essentially went through 1-3 before the very very end when it somehow got kicked out which is honestly wild. In this rate, I truly feel that this would be an 10/11 in all stars but here compared to everything else around it , it just does not hit as hard

PB: Post-Ferguson, something in the air changed. And hearing people scream this while they protested, just. I can't explain what this song means to so many people, even if it's a promise we won't see in my lifetime. But n-gga, we gon be alright.

#Send my regards to Tk and his broken 11 streak

**avg-vag** (11): i love all three of these albums and could easily pick multiple 11‚Äôs but alright brightens the bleak spot in my heart that won‚Äôt let me hope.
 
**endcreditouilles** (11): empowering and fucking ferocious, I‚Äôm 100% here for this, legend
 
**RandomHypnotica** (11): This song is just‚Ä¶ soo SOOO good! The lyrics are iconic, legendary, anthemic, the vocal snippet being looped in the background is great, the way Pharrel sings "we gonna be alRIGHT" it all just comes together so perfectly, ugh, love it!
 
**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): This song is just incredible
 
**TragicKingdom1** (11): a powerful message over one of pharrell's best beats. it's really easy to see how this became the definitive BLM anthem
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): Absolutely insane, Kendrick‚Äôs music is always genius
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): me when someone asks me how i am
 
**bbfan132** (10): kendrick x pharrell is a match made in heaven
 
**CarlieScion** (10): this is probably gonna win
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I do not like Pharell on the hook, but Kendrick bodies everything on here.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): man this song is still so relevant. Another one of my favorites, this is definitely one of the most direct songs on the album, but that‚Äôs exactly what is needed.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): the only song in the 2010s better than Grimes - Oblivion according to pitchfork
 
**KennyEarthman** (10): that chorus got me dancing
 
**mudkip1** (10): legendary
 
**runaway3212** (10): I don't want this to win but it's perfect
 
**seanderlust** (10): i don't want this to win just because I love a good surprise win, but come on. you don't NOT give this a 10. it's a great song, and it is even better in the context of the album immediately trailing u
 
**skargardin** (10): perfection
 
**vayyiqra** (10): I do not feel at all ready to comment on this other than to say it's great.
 
**waluigiest** (10): MASTERPIECE
 
**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): Yeah, this is the song that every white person listened to in 2015 and was like ‚Äúokay, that‚Äôs enough activism for today‚Äù. It‚Äôs overrated and underrated at the same time, because Kendrick sure has better tracks, but this is still amazing and arrives at the right time within the narrative of the album.
 
**fadedblue09** (9): It's a "local" song, sure, but it doesn't change the fact that it's still a great song.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (9): lmao he wants to be Ariana so badly it‚Äôs embarrassing
 
**wavingwolves** (9): it's actually a little more than alright
 
**pheromenos** (8.5): love the pharrell production here
 
**booksandplantsand** (8): tbh I just like how this one sounds
 
**cremeebrulee** (8): i will actually laugh if this wins bc its like . so far from the best on this album. i remember when this album dropped when i was in high school and people were like, always playing this song instead of the other 4 good singles lmao ‚Ä¶ not that i hate this song or anything it‚Äôs just well, alright
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (8): i don‚Äôt want this song to win as imo it‚Äôs one of the worst on this album sob
 
**ReallyCreative** (8): I thought I'd love this one from the jump but it ends up being too repetitive for me. Still very good though.
 
#He's the lowest score but he actually spilled here

**kappyko** (7): yeah after talking to roxie this is good out of the context of the album but in the album it feels like everything else shines so much more

Roxie: God I was really rooting for this song to win!! It peaked at number one various times throughout the rate but never got to recover from that last 6.5. Its such a good intro into the album and perfectly sets everything up
 
PB: Iconic intro. Iconic!

#We should Never Gave We should Never Gave Popheads Rates go back home

**engifear** (11): I'm not sure other people love this song as much as I do, but a Kendrick song featuring George Clinton and Thundercat could never have gotten any other score from me. It's a great intro to a great album.
 
**graphicxl** (11): One of the best album openers I know. The frantic intensity sets the scene perfectly.
 
**seanderlust** (11): okay firstly, I don't see kendrick, thundercat and george clinton on a track with flying lotus and dre and don't give it a 10 or higher. but also, the uncle sam verse is honestly one of the smartest verses i've ever heard.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): I always get chills with this opener.
 
**akanewasright** (10): The actual perfect start for the album. Absolutely immaculate
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): nvm i take it back capitalism IS bad
 
**bbfan132** (10): such a fucking good intro with a++++ features
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): the production/lyrics/flow are pure kendrick
 
**buddhacharm** (10): FlyLo daddy
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): this opener whew ‚Ä¶. so dense but still so accessible. there‚Äôs so many sonically interesting parts to this song and i love the metaphor of fame as his first girlfriend.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): such a strong opening track. I love how funky is it and the hook is amazing. I love the introspection on his come up in the industry, and how it ties back into the title of the album
 
**kappyko** (10): something about wesleys theory i always think about is someones comment that kendrick lamar came up with a hook that no sane non-black person would ever sing
 
**RandomHypnotica** (10): What an intro, I love the wobbly bassline throughout, Kendrick starts off with some REAL powerful lines and great delivery, it's a fantastic opener
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): there's so much going on in this one but it's all super interesting and fun
 
**runaway3212** (10): This is literally so amazing I love it so much
 
**skargardin** (10): pretty much the perfect intro isn't it
 
**slimboyfriend** (10): I feel like I'm going to be giving every song on here a 10 because this opening is so perfect.
 
**whizzer0** (10): I wasn't sure I was going to like this album but by the end of this track I was sold... what an opener!
 
**wryn\_** (10): This was too much for 15 year old me to handle on first listen
 
**ziggytvs** (10): LET'S F*CKIN GOOOOOOOO
 
**wavingwolves** (9.6): can't begin to tell you the way i'm obsessed with the "look both ways before you cross my mind" part
 
**bigbigbee** (9.5): Weird and cool. A perfect opener. The only thing holding it back from a better score is that it feels slightly less re-listenable than other tracks on this album.
 
**mysario** (9.5): one of the best album openers you could ask for
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9.5): everyone say thank you Thundercat! This song is outstanding
 
**endcreditouilles** (9): what an incredible opener, really sets the tone for the whole album
 
**KennyEarthman** (9): good opener
 
**vayyiqra** (9): I've heard this album before and was still blown away by this song. It's overwhelming.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): A great intro to the album, musically and thematically. It feels like the opening credits of a movie where you‚Äôre just whizzing through the world you‚Äôre about to spend eighty minutes in, just seeing colors and names and flashes of what‚Äôs to come. Also love me some Thundercat

PB: I LOVE MYSELF!

#I cant stop crying we did it kids

**astrologicalangel** (11): this is one of the best songs ever made and I will hear no word to the contrary
 
**CrimsonROSET** (11): After an album with themes of so much pain and drive to stand up, it almost feels wrong to give the highest score to the poppier, up-beat, good vibes song in the entire rate. But after I slept on it, it just felt right. The texts on the rate announcement post helped me educate myself more about black culture, but if there was one thing that was clear from the start, is that the very least we can do is stand in unity. Bring each other up and fight together. Recognize beauty, recognize greatness, recognize the wish to do better, the need to do better. And I think this is the reason I gave this my 11.
 
**izeasklapaucius** (11): this is literally the first Kendrick song that I heard kajillion years ago (2016). While I've only heard the album this year because of this year, i has stuck with me since my initial listening. the 70s rock influenced production, the energetic chorus, and the frustration Kendrick's poured into his lyrics, it's all beautifully arranged into this track. Modern masterpiece, period.
 
**AHSWeeknd** (10): A great way to (almost) close out the album. Love this one.
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): i hate myself
 
**bbfan132** (10): love how joyous this is - also love the live feeling of this version
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): THE PRIDE THE CONFIDENCE YES YES YES
 
**celladonn** (10): Perfect. I used to dislike that this was a live version but now I can't imagine it any other way
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): if i was complaining about this song on my u comment, ignore me bc this is a smash
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I love the single version of the song a lot. But in the context of the album, it makes so much sense that this song was supposed to be like a live performance in Kendrick's hometown. It's like he reached the climax of the story where he finally found himself again and decided to go back to his hometown. With his renewed wisdom, he tried to unite his divided community by performing this uplighting song.
 
**endcreditouilles** (10): the lyrics in this one hit so close to home for me. Such a poetic depiction of struggling with mental health and self esteem, of going to war with yourself. One day at a time, sun gon' shine.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Back before I knew anything about pop music I remember seeing Kendrick perform this on SNL and just being utterly transfixed by it. Like his energy, his intensity, his rapid fire flow‚Ä¶ he was going so hard it felt like he was going to fly off the stage at any second. I went back to watch that video though and for some reason the top comment on YouTube is from videogamedunkey, who thinks that the live version is better than the studio version‚Ä¶ and he‚Äôs right.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): :-) happy
 
**kappyko** (10): the "it's gonna be a beautiful night" of the album
 
**KennyEarthman** (10): I love how this is such an opposite to U
 
**lobo\_generoso** (10): just say the face ü§≠
 
**MrMoodle** (10): SO close to being my 11, a seriously needed moment of levity on an otherwise sometimes very depressing album, this just sounds like pure joy.
 
**plastichaxan** (10): this brought an energy to me i haven‚Äôt felt in long...i love myself
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): yet another song I really want to give my 11 ugh
 
**runaway3212** (10): this album is just literally too perfect
 
**seanderlust** (10): I mean it's no ME! by taylor swift, but i suppose it's good. /s
 
**skargardin** (10): this is such a bop omg
 
**TiltControls** (10): i love this song
 
**TragicKingdom1** (10): i was really tempted to give this my 11 because of the single mix but the sudden outro detracts from this version unfortunately. still a 10
 
**vayyiqra** (10): Verse 3 is one of the best parts of this album and that's saying a lot.
 
**waluigiest** (10): the energy is flawless the entire time
 
**wavingwolves** (10): bts is shaking
 
**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.7): i prefer the single version but the end skit is so !! good
 
**ignitethephoenix** (9): I hate to be the person who prefers the single version but here I am. Still an excellent song and having this version within context of the album gives it a whole different outlook
 
**mysario** (9): properly the antithesis of "u", this is one of my favourite tracks on the record but well... on one hand, this is easily one of the best songs Kendrick has ever made while keeping such a great message to it - on the other hand, the album version's production and choice to make it come off more like a live performance and getting rid of Thundercat's amazing bass ending from the single makes me not prefer this version
 
**bigbigbee** (8): I get why this was chosen as a single and I think that the radio edit cuts the end, but I actually like the outro part best.
 
**fadedblue09** (7.5): The song part is really catchy but comes off as cheesy at times. The spoken-word second half is the real highlight and could've been a separate track.
 
**static\_int\_husp** (7): sorry to say it, but the single version of i would have gotten at least a 9

Roxie: This song hit number 1 two times with two ballots and then never again :skull: everyone assumed that this would win and take the crown and while its really good I am kinda glad we didnt get a predictable rate winner! this song is absolutely stunning though. This was tied with alright for the looooongest time and at one point i was scared i'd be a triple tied winner but it fell at the last second

PB: Look at all those chickens!

#Fire Fire Gentrifiers!!
 
**AHSWeeknd** (11): GENIUS. The subtlety leading up to the chorus is so next level.
 
**AngelicEmbrace** (11): It's just one of those song that have everything I love about artists(from all fields): great storytelling, non-corny social commentary and a honest motivation. I just love it so much
 
**BiPolarBear17** (11): No words could ever do this song justice or explain the monumental impact Cranes in the Sky has had in my life. I've been waiting to give this song an 11 ever since I started doing rates all those years ago, and it's an honour to finally have that opportunity in such an outstanding rate üíï
 
**BookyCats** (11): Cranes in the sky is like a dreamy summer day. A warm breeze, birds singing and you are relaxing on fresh cut gras
 
**buddhacharm** (11): This song is literally aural therapy for me, I cannot quantify how many times I've played this song to save me from bursting into tears lmfao ‚úåüèΩü§™
 
**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): This song is so beautiful! Definitely one of the best songs of the 2010s.
 
**fadedblue09** (11): One of the best songs ever crafted. Seriously, it has it all: heavenly instrumentals, poetic yet relatable lyrics and angelic vocals from Solange.
 
**JunkyGS** (11): SOOOOOOOOOOOO Beautiful omg.... even though it is a very critically acclaimed song I still feel like it is under rated LOL
 
**nootnoot781** (11): yes this is a basic choice but it‚Äôs also one of 5 songs that brings me to tears. absolutely divine
 
**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): This song is so gorgeous and soothing. It‚Äôs a vulnerable moment that seems more personal than political, but the two are intertwined, and I think the lyrics are even more meaningful in the context of Solange‚Äôs Black social consciousness. Capitalism encourages dissatisfied and oppressed people to forget about their suffering through consumerism, hedonistic activities, and individualistic ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù, when usually, the system is the problem. It‚Äôs healthy to look inwards through therapy and other means, but we also need to call out the root of the societal problems that keep marginalized people from finding true happiness, no matter how they try to change their circumstances.
 
**SideBTrack8** (11): such a beautiful song
 
**slimboyfriend** (11): I love the dual imagery of seeing some peaceful birds in the sky coupled with the gloomy sight of construction cranes blocking out the city sky.
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): simply put, it's a classic
 
**1998tweety** (10): gorg
 
**bbfan132** (10): :poohascend:
 
**celladonn** (10): SUCH a beautiful track
 
**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It's exceptionally beautiful and touching, but there are songs on this album I enjoy more.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I‚Äôve spent too many minutes lying in bed singing this song to an empty room to give it anything less than a ten
 
**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song is so gorgeous and haunting. Easily one of my favorite songs here in the rate, it‚Äôs so simple yet so effective in the message that is conveyed
 
**ImADudeDuh** (10): Thinking about how i expected this was gonna be a hit when it first debuted on the hot 100‚Ä¶ my Smile era
 
**kappyko** (10): this is the prettiest song ever made and i can at least sleep knowing popheads will definitely give this the justice indieheads didn't give to it in their rate. like they put that shit below fucking FUTURE ISLANDS
 
**MoonlightByWindow** (10): :(((
 
**outsideeyess** (10): these backing vocals have me sobbing
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): transcendent!
 
**runaway3212** (10): This is so beautiful
 
**seanderlust** (10): if you know one solange song, it's probably this one and for good reason. this song is fantastic and if TPAB wasn't here this would probably get my 11
 
**skargardin** (10): insanely gorgeous
 
**stickywheels46** (10): This track is so beautiful lyrically and sonically
 
**TiltControls** (10): ugh, just gorgeous. so close to giving this an 11
 
**vayyiqra** (10): I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I love this song and think about it often. It's such a good and unique metaphor to build a song around and a strangely compelling image and title.
 
**waluigiest** (10): okay can we talk about those high notes??? And the writing is stunning and constant across.
 
**wavingwolves** (10): biggest smash
 
**ziggytvs** (10): there's nothing left to say about this song except that it's perfect
 
**akanewasright** (9): Idk what else to say other than this is beautiful. Like actually a thing of beauty.
 
**booksandplantsand** (9): yeah this one HITS
 
**cremeebrulee** (9): ok not me thinking this song was about the bird cranes and not metal cranes kdjfkdjs
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Geez, I didn't expect this song to hit me so much. As someone who is usually optimistic, I tend to avoid painful moments. But they always happen no matter. I feel you, Solange.
 
**just\_thonking** (9): captures the feeling of malaise so well
 
**wryn\_** (9): Ok I really thought I was going to underrate this but WOW I finally understand iy. I literally saw solange live and that didnt make it click but listening to it now it all makes sense? Pandemic vibes i guess
 
**Alumineous** (8): Her vocals, though.
 
**KennyEarthman** (8): cranes in the sky is an odd analogy but it works
 
**MrMoodle** (8): When she sings "it's like cranes in the sky" and the piano starts building up I wish it continued building for a bit, but instead the piano just drops out and I feel kinda blueballed, it sounds like shit's about to go down but then it doesn't really. The ending sort of gets there, but I was hoping for more of an explosion. Then again, it seems kinda silly to try rating the song based on what I wanted it to be rather than what it is, when what it is is very good.
 
**pheromenos** (7): idk why but it doesn't click with me at all üòî
 
**RandomHypnotica** (7): This song just never really clicked with me, I've listened to it a few times over the years, because of all the acclaim it got, but it just feels a bit lacking for me. I really like the lyrics though.

#If I had a dollar for everytime user CarlieScion was the lowest score on an albums last song left I would have two dollars, which isnt alot but it makes me mad its happened twice
 
**CarlieScion** (6): i do not get the hype here, like its CUTE but not at the hight of like Don't You Wait

Roxie: And here we have it our winner!!! This originally had an over 10 winning average, placing itself nicely between Whitney and, well Whitney! As more ballots came in though it started to fall, but never quiete enough to be able not to fall back up. I personally would've liked a non single to win but If I had to choose between all the singles I feel like this si a really great one!!

PB: It's a hell of a song, I'll tell you that much.

#BITCH WE WON THE RATE GOT ALL OF POPHEADS TALKING 

**bigbigbee** (11): I know this is a basic 11 pick, but I‚Äôve loved this song since the first time I heard it.
 
**celladonn** (11): God what a good fucking song
 
**hikkaru** (11): The bass and the guitar that comes in later on in the song oh my god. Even ignoring anything this song is saying the production is just out of this world. I think this track does an amazing job of showing one of the key themes of the album, that being Kendrick's personal experience in gaining immense fame while being a black man, and that's what elevates it to be my favourite in the rate and an extremely worthy 11.
 
**ignitethephoenix** (11): Probably my favourite song from the album, I love funky this is as well (the way I‚Äôll be saying this for the whole album) but him using the metaphor of King Kunta Kinte to reflect on him being a black man in the music industry (and coming a not well to do background to becoming a millionaire) is so good.
 
**ImADudeDuh** (11): thinking about a universe where this was a hit‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ i wanna live there
 
**just\_thonking** (11): Just so infectiously funky. An immediate favorite from the album and it doesn't get old
 
**KennyEarthman** (11): that guitar solo makes me feel badass
 
**letsallpoo** (11): LIFE AIN'T SHIT BUT A FAT VAGINA!!!!!
 
**mysario** (11): during a spring break years ago, I flew down to Florida and missed the bus from the airport to the hotel so I passed the time by listening to this album in full. by the time the album finished, the bus still wasn't there so I'm like "alright, should be here any second, I'll just vibe to this song while I wait" and then I heard this song for another hour straight while the Florida sun cooked me alive, what a wonderful time
 
**outsideeyess** (11): ADORE THIS SONG SO MUCH
 
**pat-rickstar** (11): Very hard to pick just one 11 on this album, I think this might be my personal favourite but there's about 4 others I'd considered giving it to. This won because I love how the production shifts and progresses as the song goes on
 
**rickikardashian** (11): roxie really let me !np this for a month with the titties gif without letting me know who kunta was
 
**static\_int\_husp** (11): The funk was within me before even the first shot
 
**TipsyTom55** (11): The way the ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt no king!‚Äù Lead into this song? I gasped.
 
**Awkward\_King** (10): i dont really have any intelligent commentary on the song because it's brilliant enough on it's own but like years later im still like... wah... wow
 
**bbfan132** (10): one of the two songs i knew/remembered before this and it is still growing on me
 
**booksandplantsand** (10): the only song from the album I knew beforehand! so good!
 
**cremeebrulee** (10): ok seriously is there a track on this album that isn‚Äôt a 10?
 
**fadedblue09** (10): IMO the real opener of the album, establishes its themes very well.
 
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): shoutout to Terrace Martin, who did ‚Äúadditional production‚Äù on this track. He did an EP with Ric Wilson last year that I really loved entitled *They Call Me Disco*, check it out. Anyways *TPAB* isn‚Äôt necessarily an album that I would consider to be a ‚Äúfun‚Äù album but this track is a definite bright spot, despite the dark lyrics the funky, cartoonish production is a lot of fun to listen to. I especially love those little callbacks from his hype girls
 
**kappyko** (10): this is literally so fun that it's pretty hard to realize how weird it is lol
 
**ReallyCreative** (10): BOP!
 
**runaway3212** (10): Kendrick sound so incredible here omg
 
**seanderlust** (10): bop
 
**skargardin** (10): the beat really is everything
 
**TiltControls** (10): Kendrick's control over a beat sometimes feels unparalleled
 
**vayyiqra** (10): It feels weird to say this about a song which is about a character from Roots, but this song is also ridiculously catchy.
 
**wavingwolves** (10): incredibly catchy
 
**whizzer0** (10): These might be the strongest opening three tracks I've ever heard... It's always good to hear a song where fun and depth are not are not mutually exclusive.
 
**wryn\_** (10): my first day of uni my halls of residence had a party where we put this on and everyone started rapping along and we were all white and i can't listen to this without wondering how problematic that was. but we all knew all the words cause it's a masterpiece obvs
 
**graphicxl** (9): I almost just wish the production was louder. That's about my only complaint, this was the perfect choice as the commercial single from an obviously uncommercial album.
 
**MrMoodle** (9): It‚Äôs a mega bop, everyone knows this. But I think the instrumental on the verses don‚Äôt feel as full as the other tracks, which isn‚Äôt an inherent problem, but as what‚Äôs arguably the most accessible track on the album and the one most people will first hear from it, it‚Äôs kinda disappointing. I still love this song but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best representative of the album as a whole. Look I‚Äôm really scraping for critiques here ok
 
**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): constantly stuck in my head for days after every time i listen to it
 
**waluigiest** (9): I really thought this song was like 20 years older
 
**ziggytvs** (9): that bass is so sick, I DO want the funk

#Well too bad!! its heading to winners rate babeyyyy
 
**AHSWeeknd** (6): I never liked this one

Roxieloxie: # A Seat At The Table

---

**Overall Average**: 8.186 **// Average Controversy:** 1.329

---


---
**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.810): Solange made a bold artistic statement on her own terms, not holding back on any topic. Whether she‚Äôs laying out her perspective on racial injustice, reclaiming her personal peace, or celebrating the richness of Black culture, her elegant vocals over lush instruments are like a balm for the soul, and her lyrics a much-needed wake-up call for those of us who have not walked in her shoes. I love how the album flows with the interludes, hearing people close to Solange‚Äôs heart speak on the album‚Äôs important themes makes every song more special.

**runaway3212** (9.667): I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said about this album, it's immaculate

**kappyko** (9.571): people gave the most backhanded compliments to this album when it won pitchfork's aoty like "yes it's such a good choice for a /statement/." as if it isn't a beautiful album in its own right! it still sounds like very little else out there and people will groan about the interludes but not only are they very short but they're literally pretty to listen to? cranes in the sky, don't touch my hair are the obvious highlights and deserved the single shine but the run from DTMH to borderline is perfect

**ReallyCreative** (9.495): I love this album and loved the opportunity to listen a little deeper. Everything about this album feels so deliberate and calculated while also being so expressive and beautiful, a masterpiece from start to finish!

**buddhacharm** (9.119): As someone who's been a fan of Solange's since her incredible True EP, A Seat at the Table ‚Äî inarguably her masterpiece ‚Äî completely stopped me in my tracks. On first listen it admittedly felt a little bloated and meandering to me, which is perhaps something I can attribute to my initial inability to adapt to her aesthetic pivot. I think it took the trauma of the 2016 election for the album to really cohere for me, and its amazingly prescient nature helped assert it as not only one of the best statement pieces of the 2010s, but one of my favorite albums of all time. (Side note but my low-ish scores for the interludes probably lowering my average for the album is just...homophobique)

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.095): I feel like we should have rated this album instead of When I Get Home with Take Me Apart and Isolation. Wonderful listen all the way through, even though it was not made for me.

**waluigiest** (9.000): One of my favorite albums of all time. The writing, the themes, the cohesion, the performance. Everything is perfect.

**whizzer0** (8.762): I listened to this right after TPAB which was probably a bad idea because it's still a great album but there's quite a difference. I think I connect with this album the most personally, though, even if it doesn't have quite so much going on. It's interesting how all three albums share similar themes and are all packed with variety but keep their own distinct sounds and lyrical styles.

**TiltControls** (8.619): Amazing album! So many absolutely great songs! The interludes were tricky to rate, but I just did it from whatever my gut feeling was

**seanderlust** (8.567): Full disclosure - I had no idea that Solange had projects before this- I only knew ASATT and WIGH. It sounds like she got some pretty weird and kind of racist feedback from critics for the projects before Table. Well RIP to those critics but I'm glad that Solange was able to channel some of that frustration into this album! This is a lovely monument to self-love. Solange shimmers and floats through these songs with clear mind and intention. She invites the listener in to empathize with her whether they can directly relate or not. I get that this album is particularly important for WoC, and I am so happy that both Knowles sisters have been able to not only claim their seats at the table, but to save a seat for anyone who might relate.

**plastichaxan** (8.538): this album would have a higher rating from me if it weren‚Äôt for my lack of understanding on rating interludes, they are very powerful, and i gave one a 10, and yet it feels off to rate them on such a great album/rate as well

**frogaranaman** (8.524): music as art

**pat-rickstar** (8.500): When I Get Home was the first album from Solange I listened to, for the R&B Queens rate a couple of months ago. I like this album a lot more to be honest, it's a lot more straightforward and accessible in a way, and so clear in its purpose and messaging.

**vayyiqra** (8.381): Although I'd heard this album before, it didn't quite click with me the first time - I liked it but didn't love it. This time it grew on me heavily and I think I appreciated the lyrics a lot more (I knew what some of the songs were about roughly but didn't delve into them deeply which was a mistake). Also I didn't appreciate what a well-produced album this is and the way it blends genres like R&B with traces of synthpop and jazz, which is very up my alley. As well, there is (like on all these albums) a very talented group of musicians working on this behind the scenes which make the musicianship incredibly tight. I did have some trouble rating the interludes (which do add to the album) so I just gave the album average to each one. This was my second-highest album in the rate but in a way maybe my favourite.

**skargardin** (8.333): I really need to be in a special kind of mood to fully sit down and appreciate Solange's music, but this is nontheless a great album with many beautiful moments. I will definitely return to it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.319): i was obsessed with this album in 2016 and 2017 but haven‚Äôt listened to it much since then so thank you for reminding me how great it is

**fadedblue09** (8.167): My favorite album in the rate (though I‚Äôm not sure if my averages will reflect that). It's a rare album that sounds eclectic and soulful at the same time. Despite being soft-sounding, there's certainly a strong yet subtle indignance throughout. Furthermore, it perfectly balances the personal and political, as Solange is able to act as a voice not only for herself, but for other black women as well.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.071): Listening to A Seat at the Table for the second time now for this rate made me highly appreciate Solange an artist even more. I discovered some gems that I criminally slept on in my first listen and I have them on my saved list now, such as Don't You Wait and Junie. Solange has this beautiful way of acknowledging these really painful experiences that Black women go through and made this entire album feel like a therapy session for them. This is easily one of the best albums of 2016 for sure.

**hikkaru** (7.881): I think I prefer the other two albums in the rate but this is still great. I will say that normally I'm against rating short interludes but here they're so impactful and poignant in regards to the album's structuring and themes so I'm glad they're here and I hope they aren't done too dirty for being interludes.

**MrMoodle** (7.476): The only song I‚Äôd heard from this album before the rate was Don‚Äôt Touch My Hair (which I love), but tbh I was less engaged by the rest of the album than I thought I‚Äôd be. This certainly would‚Äôve gotten a higher average from me in any other rate, but considering the calibre of the other albums here I felt the need to be super critical. The instrumentals didn‚Äôt feel as rich and detailed as the other two, and I felt like some of the social commentary was a little less nuanced and subtle (particularly when compared to TPAB), although there is something to say in favour of the bluntness of it, not much is concealed. I generally like the interludes but they were pretty inconsistent, and some of them (eg. No Limits) didn‚Äôt feel like they added much. This is still an excellent album and I feel a little silly trying to critique it too much since it‚Äôs like, what the fuck am I supposed to tell Solange about music that she doesn‚Äôt already know, but personally I didn‚Äôt love it as much as the other albums in the rate.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.443): so fucking good and i just wanna say if anyone ever gets a chance to see solange live you better do it!!!! her live shows are unreal

**celladonn** (7.333): I feel like Solange's album average is going to get dragged down a bit because of all the interludes but it's definitely a great project with a lot to say

**stickywheels46** (7.190): Surprised I never got around to listening to this before, great R&B album

**KennyEarthman** (6.929): this feels like a seminar, which is good for the first 30 minutes then gets a bit boring after

**AHSWeeknd** (6.810): I‚Äôm always so speechless after listening to this album, Solange knows how to make an experience.

Roxieloxie: # To Pimp a Butterfly

---

**Overall Average**: 8.871 **// Average Controversy:** 1.171

---

 

---
**ElizabethDDoS** (10.063): I'll let my score speak for itself.

**runaway3212** (10.000): The perfect album, literally it's so good

**seanderlust** (9.956): i'm gonna keep this brief since there isn't any praise I can rain on this album that it hasn't already received. also if i start talking about the lyrical content i'm going to end up looking like that one IASIP bulletin board meme. anyways, TPAB is brilliant and it is my favorite album of all time by a mile. anyone wanting to get into kendrick or rap or even modern jazz I would give this a listen. it is also IMO the gold standard for albums, which is why I think I gave this a 10.0 average (unless I did the math wrong which is a definite possibility)

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.781): from the first time i heard this album in 2015, it cemented its place as one of my favourite albums ever. kendrick just does an amazing job with his storytelling throughout the album and i LOVE almost every song on it. i really really hope it does well in the rate!!

**MrMoodle** (9.750): I went into this rate planning to be really harsh, like, really blowing up even my most minor criticisms so I would be able to differentiate my scores between each song, but that‚Äôs basically impossible on this album where nearly every song is virtually flawless

**buddhacharm** (9.625): I distinctly remember rushing to download the leak when it was erroneously released early on iTunes. There was something so unbelievably empowering about knowing that you're listening to something that would transform musical discourse for years to come ‚Äî that's how I felt when I gave TPAB my first listen. Despite it being one of my favorite albums of all time, I feel like there's still so much left to tap into. This album is so rich with incredible lyricism, powerful and pertinent messaging, intricate production, and unyielding grooves that there's so much to unpack each time.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.550): An instant classic for a reason. Kendrick is an expert storyteller, there‚Äôs so much to learn from unpacking his lyrics here, and his delivery never misses. The producers pulled from different styles, from dynamic beats to smooth soundscapes, to create a rich backdrop that keeps the listener engaged over the hour-plus runtime. This is a journey of craft and passion from beginning to end.

**ReallyCreative** (9.469): This album was just meticulously crafted, every detail, every aspect has been so carefully curated and it's apparent immediately. It's not something that I could just put on while doing whatever, but it's a classic in every sense of the word. Very emotional and thought-provoking but also some great bops.

**kappyko** (9.313): my scores look fucking mean but i think having listened to this album the most i'm more willing to be a little harsher. despite that its still like great lol other people have shit to say. i have seen criticisms of this album from others that have varying degrees of validity (i'm sure somebody remembers the "ben carson lectures over struggle jazz" tweet on hiphoptwitter :/). i'm not the person that should be making that call, but i think this album is still sonically fantastic and not much has really topped it in terms of pure grandeur. kendrick is a profound lyricist and although i prefer GKMC to this i still think this is deserving of everything it got and some more

**hikkaru** (9.281): It's so easy to see why this is so immensely acclaimed and is one of the most well-regarded albums of not only the 2010s but of all time. The lyrics, themes, production, it all comes together to make one of the best album experiences out there. It's great that we finally got to rate it!

**skargardin** (9.250): It's not hard to see why this is hailed as one of the all time greatest albums, just utterly stunning in every sense.

**TiltControls** (9.188): I think my average for this probably speaks to my enjoyment of the album lol

**pat-rickstar** (9.156): My expectations for this album were very high going into the rate as I hadn't heard it before, and they were absolutely exceeded.

**plastichaxan** (9.131): it's just as good as everyone says, i have to admit i'm really skeptical of albums that are so widely praised, but this deserves every praise it gets and more, truly outstanding

**vayyiqra** (9.125): This album was both the easiest and the hardest to rate, I think, in a way. Musically, it's awesome - I've always liked hiphop that has jazz samples in it and it's pretty hard to beat Thundercat as a studio musician. (A random fact is that both he and Bilal were on Kimbra's The Golden Echo, one of my favourite albums ever.) That part of the album is easy to rate, but the lyrics are the hard part, because they're just so complex and poetic, up to the point that there is literally a poem that repeats throughout the album (which is one of my favourite things about it.) All these albums talk about overlapping themes, being all made by African-Americans in a decade that was tumultuous about racial issues. Being both white and not American, I was hesitant to talk about the lyrics and themes of these albums at all, most of all this one, because I was afraid of fucking something up or being presumptuous. I was thinking of just sending scores and keeping from commenting, but changed my mind after reading the discussion in the rate thread and decided that we are rating these albums because they need to be talked about. Because this album is so long I don't know every single nuance of the lyrics but I did read them all and as much commentary on them as I could. Besides, it's an album about many things - for example Kendrick talking about his experiences with depression and his mental health are directly relatable to me. Another arc that repeats throughout the album which I didn't pick up on so much before is his struggles with fame and feeling hypocritical and undeserving of that. This album is far too ambitious to sum it up in one paragraph but it deserved all the praise it got.

**stickywheels46** (9.063): What can I say that hasn't been said already about this? Mind blowing.

**slimboyfriend** (9.031): This album should be required reading in all English classes

**whizzer0** (8.938): It doesn't really feel fair to give each track a rating well, at all, but especially based on only two listens. I've been doing my best to reading through the Genius analysis but there's... so much! I still feel like I'm only scratching the surface of this album's complexity. So my scores might be slightly inflated compared to how I might feel if I got really into it, although I don't think it's unreasonable to say there isn't any track below an 8 in this rate, if that. (I also have no idea how to pick an 11 so I haven't.)

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.813): I checked this album after 1989 won AOTY in 2016 and I wanted to check why people felt like To Pimp a Butterfly should've won. I say this as a hardcore Swiftie, TPAB should've won AOTY instead. The way TPAB impacted the cultural conversation about race especially in the context of the BLM movement at that time should be the reason why TPAB should win AOTY. It's not just the cultural impact, but the way how this album is structured as well. It's like there is a movie being played in my head as Kendrick's character navigates his journey as a successful rapper suffering his downfall to finally connecting to his roots and the community he once belonged to. Literally, it's about Kendrick as a lost "pimped" butterfly redeeming himself. I am not kidding when I say that this album changed my life and the way I hear music. Even though I am not someone who is knowledgeable about hip-hop, this album made me stan Kendrick and why I am always excited for his releases. (Kenny please come back huhu)

**bigbigbee** (8.688): I am likely swayed by its near-universal acclaim, but this is probably the best album I‚Äôve heard in‚Ä¶at least five years, if not ever. I love how parts of this album feel like a stage play ‚Äì the feeling I‚Äôm left with as the album closes is very similar to how I feel after the final lines of plays that move me somehow ‚Äì very sobered, very one with my own thoughts, very internal. It‚Äôs a feeling that no other album has ever managed to instill in me.

**celladonn** (8.656): My favorite album here and it's not close, and that's not a slight against the other albums it's just a testament to how good this is. Such a well crafted masterpiece with so many fantastic songs and moments

**KennyEarthman** (8.500): how have I not heard this before??? I missed out

**fadedblue09** (7.813): Well-earned its status as a classic not just among rap albums, but for the entire music canon as well. Every lyric is eye-opening and all its themes are successfully presented, and honestly I don‚Äôt think I can say anything that hasn‚Äôt been said. The (relatively) low average I gave is mainly due to my preference of the subtle, soulful approaches of the other two and for some reason the tracklist order gave me whiplash at times.

**AHSWeeknd** (7.500): An insane experience. This is like one of the best albums ever.

TiltControls: What a great rate! I'm glad that everyone enjoyed the albums ~~even though Mad and D'angelo deserved better~~

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) as always. Songlist tool should have updated automatically too.

###Songs

So many good songs in this rate that it makes sense that we got the entire top 7 into the top 100 highest scorers!

* King Kunta (#9)

* Cranes in the Sky (#28)

* i (#29)

* Wesley's Theory (#43)

* Alright (#45)

* The Blacker the Berry (#81)

* These Walls (#99)

We've also got some lowest controversy records with Wesley's Theory at #2, i at #4 and Alright at #7

Also the "no score lower than 7" list gets some new additions with Alright and How Much a Dollar Cost

###Artists

Well **Kendrick** had quite the performance here eh? With this rate his average is enough to move from #19 to #6 on the artist average ratings. He also takes the #10 spot on lowest artist controversy. We've also rated him enough to make him #19 on most songs rated.

**Solange** also had a strong performance, though it was hard to catch up to Kendrick. Luckily she bumped up her average enough to move from 95th to 34th for artist averages. She also takes the #7 spot for lowest artist controversy

So yeah, **D'angelo** takes the record for earliest exit in a 3 album rate at 10th, taking the record from Charli XCX going out in 9th. I mean I guess the competition was strong, but couldn't we let The Charade have a 9 average at least?
On the plus side, with an 8.172, D'Angelo takes the 17th highest artist average and lands on the top 20 leaderboard. Finally, he takes the #1 spot for lowest artist controversy!!!

In other bad news LMFAO has someone joining them on the no 11's list now. I don't even know if I want to count them as having your only songs be 6 interludes seems a little unfair. 
Nevertheless, **Master P** technically has 0 11's across the 6 interludes he featured on for Solange so he qualifies for the list. On the plus side, he also is eligible for the no 0's list so he gets a rare distinction there.

###Rates

This rate takes the 3rd highest average of all time and becomes our least controversial rate ever done! It also ties the record for least 0's given and takes the record for lowest % of 0's given out.

Thanks to Roxie and PB for hosting a fantastic rate!

:)

will continue to haunt my dreams forever
