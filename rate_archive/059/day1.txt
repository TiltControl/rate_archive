Hello everyone, welcome to the first day of the EDM/Pop Girl Collaboration rate reveal! I’m incredibly excited to get this started - it’s been a long time coming (seriously it’s nearly February already, jeez). I can assure you all that this is going to be a messy ride.

frogaranaman: I don’t think so, that song has a pretty basic verse / pre-chorus / chorus / verse / pre-chorus / chorus / bridge / chorus structure.
[/r/popheads/comments/ajt05m/edmpop_girl_collabs_rate_reveal_day_1_the_part/eeykj1h/]

=====

frogaranaman: My three guesses are “This Is What We Came For”, “Break Free”, and “It Ain’t Me”.

Reasons:

-	“This Is What We Came For”s chorus goes down ~an octave in the second half, which is unusual for a pop song.
-	“Break Free”, as an EDM song, doesn’t have a climax until the *very* end of the song.
-	“It Ain’t Me” has that odd pre-chorus break after the buildup.

**Edit:** ”Hey Mama” could also work, as it has the hook first before the verses start, which is not common in pop songs at all.

As much as r/popheads seems to be stans of up-and-coming electronic avant-pop producer SOPHIE in other threads, they do not stan her collaboration with Cashmere Cat. One listen to that drop and you can immediately tell that it was cooked up by one Miss Sophie, and I really do mean cooked - her pots and pans truly did snap here. With an enormous controversy score, there were a lot of lovers and a lot of haters of this song, but the haters clearly won. This song was in the bottom position from essentially the very beginning of the rate and sat there for all of nearly two months. Oh well, Sophie will stay winning with her Grammy nomination :nail_care:

---

#Kitchen equipment enthusiasts

**enecks** (11): This is batshit ridiculous and intense. That drop is like a pinball game in a rubber kinkster orgy with some breaking glasses. SOPHIE is the GOAT.

**Bendariaku89** (10): classic experimental weird genre-shifty song mashup but not actually a mashup song. sophie definitely has a style that i can recognize by now, with the mechanical factory sounds. i love the dichotomy between the somber and intense parts. if you love vroom vroom, you’ll definitely love this. sidenote: i genuinely thought this was charli xcx.

**FireLordAegon** (10): idk what I just listened to but I coudn't press pause and I am inclined to give this a 10

**MashLuke** (10): this track is a mess from start to finish with the dog sounds in the drop and the metallic noises. I love it a lot, it's so clumsy in a good way.

**Me-Luigi** (10): a post-modern classic, Karen ruined Iggy's SNL performance but Iggy's career tanked and Karen got to make this, soty 2017 (glad all writers/producers from this reunited on Nights With You along with Ryan Tedder, that was a serve as well) this is sumn for the pots and pans

**mms82** (10): Peak SOPHIE- cute and aggressive at the same time

**mudkip1** (10): just bc of sophie we stan and support

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Will I give anything that has SOPHIE banging pots together a 10? Maybe so.

**radiofan15** (10): This is my fifth most listened song of the year in Spotify so you already know this is gonna be a 10

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): hi sophie sorry i gave you a bad score in the charity rate

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://i.imgur.com/lGEC57T.png

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the drop is the best thing sophie has ever done

**tapdancingpig** (9.6): A cute little trop bop until Sophie fucks everyone’s shit up. Then it nears perfection.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): I've never heard this before. The songwriting is okay, but I really like the production! It's such a fun mix of smooth and abrasive textures.

**kappyko** (9): MØ and SOPHIE together on the same song together is literally either heaven or hell for any music listener, no in between

**vulture\_couture** (9): yass miss SOPHIE deconstruct my bussy mom

#SOPHIE get the fuck out of my kitchen cupboard

**BearlyEvenAPun** (8): most of this song is actually amazing but that drop does not fit well here

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): you could cut this song down to 2 and a half minutes and it would basically be the same. Do I like that Cashmere tried using other sound effects? yes. Do I think they improve the song in any way? eh

**static\_int\_husp** (8): If you didn't tell me SOPHIE contributed to this, I would have assumed she did anyways, given that the drop is basically pots and pans

**rotating3Dtext** (7): the weird SOPHIE sounds part is not for me

**SkyBlade79** (7): cute in an ugly way

**yatcho** (7): Low-key glad SOPHIE has moved beyond the pots and pans production style to something a little deeper

**camerinian** (6.5): I'm not entirely certain how well SOPHIE's contributions coalesce here, and I'm not sure MØ is the best collaborator for it, but I like the jarring tonal interplay and how it works with the lyrics. It's cute, somehow

**frogaranaman** (6): This is one of SOPHIE’s three drops that she makes.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): This song reminds of these percussion music CD’s I had to listen to and review for band class since I was a percussionist. Just a bunch of percussive noises with a rhythm. Except there were no vocals on that. Also this song is just too song for the lack of substance it has.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I'm not really sure about this one because I honestly don't think Cashmere Cat's (relatively) mainstream brand of electronic music and Sophie's PC Music tendencies (which I usually enjoy) go all that well together. Also ngl this song's title is pretty white

**sbb618** (6): Is this breakdown intentionally bad? What the hell? It gets the score it does because the rest of this is so good, but what the hell?

**seralite** (6): um its ok

**twat\_brained** (5.8): Those marimbas definitely sound like MØ's style, much like how you can hear SOPHIE'S industrial-meets-dubstep style. I'm just not sure how exactly Cashmere fits into the equation here. I guess in the verses, the buildup and the outro. But that's MØ's job, right? Suffice it to say this just doesn't exactly come together.

**awryj** (5): is this song ironic or sth? bc i dont really get why sophie put those goofy ass cartoon sfx drop in there. they usually have a purpose in pc style songs but here they just sound out of place

**bespectacIed** (5): hears kitchen utensils banging it's a sophie song alright

**Brandon6099** (5): not my taste

**diamondblaze413** (5): holy shit sophie i love you but honestly wasn't ready for any of this

**timothy444** (4.6): This is way too weird and reminds me of a discount Shawn Wasabi but without the talent. This is something I would listen to if I was high but it doesn’t make it a good song.

**HerculesMeow** (4): The beat drop is so weird and I really just don't get it, I guess?

**Leixander** (4): Such a mess, Sophie's magic doesn't work here and feels too abrasive.

**monkeyattacks** (4): Cashmere has good parts of his songs and then he has parts that just make you go uh okay then.

**ManofOranges** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3GMDjFKoE8

**mich4725** (3): doesn't work

**evilqueenlex** (2): The singer and the track don't connect. She's too whiny in sound for me and the song is too disjointed. I've liked SOPHIE's tracks before so it's not like I don't get it.

**Johnnytoby** (2): no thanks charli xcx scrap

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (2): bye

**SinfulAnarchy** (2): this is too trippy and weird for my taste. also, idk who’s singing this, but they sound bored and uninspired.

**notdallin** (1.9): yeah it’s a no from me, dawg

**1998tweety** (1): Oh my goodness this is so so bad, some pc music can be good but chief this ain't it.

**gannade** (1): WHERE ARE THE INSTRUMENTS??????

**marcryan** (1): More like (After Acid)

**MrSwearword** (1): actively unpleasant

**selegend** (1): Sounds like a garbage disposal

**strawberryswing1** (1): For most of the songs I've given bad scores to in this rate, I've given them bad scores because they're way too generic. This one I'm giving a bad score because it's straight noise. This is garbage.

**vhqv1997** (1): I'm not entirely sure that was a song

**bloupp** (0): This is a complete mess

**cyborglilith** (0): atrocious

**GamblesWithDesire** (0): Yeah, no.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): MO sweetie, I'm SO sorry you had to be on this song with Sophie....................................

**InfernalSolstice** (0): this is why people criticize sophie for sounding like pots and pans

**jamesfog** (0): SOPHIE bad.

**LandonKidatrea** (0): sounds like someone got their hands on the Hanna-Barbera library of sound effects.

**piccprincess** (0): this is literally the worst version of Sophie you could possibly give me, ever

**ramskick** (0): what the fuck is this chaos in the middle it sucks and makes me curl up into a 9 because it sucks so bad.

Oh, David Guetta. Often times, EDM pop is described as “dated”, and while I personally am not a big fan of using that as a criticism, Guetta’s tracks really do show their age. This one (alongside another) are among the tracks that most show when they’re from, and clearly people aren’t here for it! Unfortunately for Rihanna, while she did strike gold with other EDM collaborations, this ain’t it.

---

#Right

**Leixander** (10): Disjointed mess that I love and still listen to sometimes.

**PuggleMaster** (10): I have a really bad memory of singing this song off tune in my french class and I want to die thinking about it

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): hell yes i didn’t NOT expect to see this in the rate i am living

**bespectacIed** (9.8): Rih does a lot of things well, but when she's on dance club mode, she's legit unparalleled.

**Chevsapher** (9.2): The lyrics are cliche and the drop is a little dated, but regardless, there's something really compelling about the melodies and the chords.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Rih at her best can make me overlook ANY questionable production choices

**twat\_brained** (8.3): David's maximalism is on some other shit here, let me tell you. If nothing else, I miss when this sound was dominant on the radio and everyone lost their fucking minds to this kind of music. It'd be cool to hear a song like this again on R9.

**diamondblaze413** (8): lyrics did not warrant the best electro i could've ever anticipated

**FireLordAegon** (8): Ok I was gonna give this song like a 3 or something cause I thought it was generic trash back when R7 came out, but I listened to it again to be fair and holy shit! It's still generic trash, but like the kind I'll listen to guilt free and on repeat.

**jamesfog** (8): inb4 " this is dated"

**radiofan15** (8): I can't believe that i'm gonna say this but Rihanna should try to do more EDM collabs because they all slaps harder than Chris Brown's fist

**ramskick** (8): there are times when I think I need to listen to this song RIGHT NOW.

**xxrandooxx** (7.3): yes rihanna

#Left

**1998tweety** (7.7): This is decent but honestly a little boring.

**sbb618** (7.5): I feel like there's a reason I hadn't heard this one before.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I know the stuff people say about Rihanna releasing constant 7s isn't true but honestly almost every single between Loud and Anti more or less fits that description and this is no exception

**timothy444** (7): Like many of the other songs he worked on, Rihanna’s voice in the chorus is probably the best part about the whole thing. Unfortunately, it hasn’t aged well and it deserves to be forgotten in the past, alongside 90% of all other songs that he helped produce. I’m not even kidding, it sounds like it was made in 2009.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.5): this is not bad, it's just bland. i feel like i've heard this same song 2 times already

**Brandon6099** (6): not my taste srry Rihanna

**evilqueenlex** (6): I haven't heard this song in forever. It's okay. Points for being energetic even if it is kind of boring.

**ManofOranges** (6): This song... exists, I guess.

**MrSwearword** (6): mediocre in both the pantheon of Rihanna songs and songs in this rate; kind of highlights the "Rihanna-tigue" being felt around the time of release.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I haven’t listened to modem-sampling dance music in years

**SinfulAnarchy** (5.5): the beat is really annoying.

**notdallin** (5.3): There’s good production elements here but strangely Guetta decides to just throw it all into a blender for that awful chorus. Sorry Rih, not even your vocal performance can save this.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): The chorus is pretty good, everything else is mediocre

**MashLuke** (5): why was this included lowkey, no shade.

**vulture\_couture** (5): This isn't horrible but it's also not notable

**awryj** (4): omg this sounds so fresh!! btw have you heard this new song, call me maybe? it's sooo catchy!!!

**tapdancingpig** (4): This is just... kinda boring.

**TragicKingdom1** (4): why is this in the rate when Snakehips - All My Friends isn't

**frogaranaman** (3): The fuck?

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this sounds like a KPOP song that KPOP stans don't even like

**lilguavachan** (3): whew chile... the generic stank coming off this track...

**Me-Luigi** (3): this is really boring

**cyborglilith** (2): what

**Johnnytoby** (2): why is this b side here but not trust nobody ok wow

**marcryan** (2): I like Rihanna’s voice and that was about it.

**camerinian** (1): Rihanna is trying her best, I know, but David Guetta is just… the worst. Like, if you are not substantially coked up, I don't know how you could enjoy this whirring, dissonant, momentum killing drop, and even during the verses it seems like he's constantly trying to one-up Rihanna, which is not a good idea because it constantly pulls you out of her performance. Lorde was right about David Guetta

**enecks** (1): Lady Antebellum Outsold

**kappyko** (1): what on EARTH i HATE DAVID GUETTA he really gave her this for her album what a selfish asshole,,, shoulda been whos that chick on her album smfh

**selegend** (1): Horrid drop, generic lyrics

In 2018, Marshmello propelled himself to be one of EDM-pop’s biggest names when it comes to production. Emphasis on the pop - his pop crossover stuff isn’t really the sort of EDM you’d find in the actual genre or on the charts in 2013. In F-R-I-E-N-D-S (that’s how you f***ing spell “friends”), he teams up with British star Anne-Marie, and somehow they managed to make a Billboard #11-peaking hit. Many, including popheads evidently, find it to be annoying both in production and lyrics. I personally think Anne-Marie’s delivery works well enough, but it’s understandable why people are irritated by it as well as the g-funk bridge thing. Stream Happier, which is a better song (though this deserved better than bottom 3 tbh)

---

#F-R-I-N-D-S

**CarlieScion** (10): overhated bop

**cyborglilith** (10): big bop

**gannade** (10): amazing

**Johnnytoby** (10): cute I bet the middle schoolers love this

**ManofOranges** (10): When she spells friends it really just sounds like she's spelling "frinds" and like it kinda irks me.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): One of the better modern EDM-pop songs out there. I was humming it for a month! The guitar is quite clever, and the bass works well with the vocals.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.5): i cannot wholeheartedly give this a 10 considering she spells friends wrong

**1998tweety** (9): A mega bop, God-Marie can do no wrong. The chorus goes HARD and I love it.

**MashLuke** (9): this is legit good, Anne-Marie totally makes the song.

**radiofan15** (9): In theory this shouldn't work, but the mashup of unlikely elements (subtle Mustard beat in the chorus, switching between singing and rapping, acoustic guitar melody) really turns this into the hit it deserved to be

**SkyBlade79** (9): that g funk drop is juicy. Song gets repetitive but its still so good

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song is easily my favorite Marshmello song. There’s not a giant stupidly small drop, and the writing and most of the production work well.

**vulture\_couture** (9): this song had me hooked in like five seconds and i want to see what anne-marie's whole deal is now

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): this lowkey SLAPS. a true bop.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): this song is great, but i'm still shocked there's a song about bragging about friendzoning someone

**diamondblaze413** (8): humming makes it

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): single-handedly ending the Friend Zone

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Sue me, but this is a good song.

**InfernalSolstice** (8): catchy at least

**monkeyattacks** (8): A grower.

**ramskick** (8): I'd like to be FRIENDS with Anne-Marie because this song is a bop.

**sbb618** (8): The main instrumental leaves much to be desired, but I'm a sucker for any song that spells out a word in its lyrics.

**selegend** (8): This actually being a good pop song actually shook me when I first heard it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): this song’s message is so powerful it was able to get /r/incels banned

**bbfan132** (7.5): don’t kill me but i actually like this!

**Brandon6099** (7): bop but overrated

**frogaranaman** (7): This song is anti-straight men. And I’m thankful for that.

**Me-Luigi** (7): a really basic bop

**MrSwearword** (7): what a spelling chorus can do for a song

**seralite** (7): i kinda love-hate this song

**kappyko** (6): this song is good, even despite its overexposure and my general dislike for the discogs of both ppl involved

#Friendzoned

**singularlegend** (7): cute but annoying as shit by now

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): i like the music, but this whole ‘friendzone anthem’ thing is ugh

**twat\_brained** (6.3): This just became really bothersome really quickly when it came on the radio last year, I'd switch to another station because the guitars got on my nerves. Also, what's the point of leaving "shit" uncensored but censoring "fucking" during the bridge regardless? I don't get this song and I don't get Marshmello. Speaking of which, I'm not sure what that tinny-ass synth in the final chorus is, but it's immensely grating, which could've been done so much better if Marshmello kept the music minimal, highlighting Anne-Marie's voice, which is actually really great, before gradually increasing it and sidechaning it into the hook. Instead I'm left even more disappointed than Anne-Marie's friendzoned suitor, which, by the way, the friendzone itself shouldn't even still be a thing. Let's just leave this song in 2018, okay?

**awryj** (6): yawnne-marie is a no from me but i kinda enjoyed the 00s inspired melody

**lilguavachan** (6): it's alright. i kinda forgot what it sounded like after it ended.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): literally don’t get the hype for this

**vhqv1997** (6): Just like the TV show, this song is very noisy and bland, and everyone involved is super white

**FireLordAegon** (5): Honestly this song is trash. It's still in my library though and I bop to it sometimes and even enjoy it, so I bumped this up a few points.

**mudkip1** (5): this is so boring and cookie-cutter

**evilqueenlex** (4.5): I can't stand that faux accent.

**jamesfog** (4): Eh

**LandonKidatrea** (4): I found my soulmate. She didn't. Friendzoned again. tips fedora

**marcryan** (4): Decent but cannot stand next to these amazing songs.

**patronsaintofaspies** (4): This is the first time I'm listening to this song and good lord I understand why people actually dislike Anne-Marie's music instead of just ignoring her now why was I subjected to three minutes of this mediocrity

**notdallin** (3.7): This song is needlessly mean coming from a marshmallow* head.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (3.5): should they even be friends at this point

**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): NOT a bop it just sounds awkward and weird. lol that billboard didn't consider it EDM enough to chart on the EDM charts though

**timothy444** (3): You know, the more I listen to this, the more I start to hate it and see its obvious flaws and issues. The part where Anne-Marie spells F-R-I-EN-D-S just so the melody can fit it is just really lazy for starters and Anne-Marie sounds really annoying on it. What’s even worse is that they felt like they had to censor the F-word (with a stock sound-effect) when they’re clearly okay with other swear words that Anne sings. I used to like this okay but it’s just a jumbled-up mess that gets worse the more you listen to it. Also, the production is so terrible that David Guetta makes better beats than him.

**Bendariaku89** (0): who wants a song about a friendzoner who doesn’t even really care for their so called “FRIEND”? like she calls the friend crazy, insane, with sitcom levels of bad behavior that honestly feels more like she’s making it seem worse than it actually is, think the guy just likes her more than he should, and they both need to talk this out, not just quick immediate rejection and calling of insanity. COMMUNICATION IS KEY PEOPLE. this perspectives sounds more arrogant than anything because she doesn’t stop trying to call someone she vehemently dislikes as a “friend”, and she doesn’t even care whether that friend can be talked with and such. UGH THIS SONG’S MESSAGE IS JUST BAD. it is a nice tune, but that’s not really enough considering this sounds a lot like other marshmello songs.

**camerinian** (0): ew. Everything about this song can be described as ‘ew’. The fact that it’s a self-proclaimed ‘friend zone anthem’ is ew. The fact that the guy in the song is basically just a stalker is ew. The fact that Anne-Marie continues to call him a friend and lead him on even though he’s showing said stalkerish behaviours is ew. The fact that Marshmello insists on doing that stupid “hey this is a real guitar guys listen to these FUCKING string squeaks” thing that so many modern producers love is ew. The percussion pattern imported directly from the “trap fill 1” preset on Ableton is ew. That god damn AWFUL g-funk synth on the last chorus is just genuinely unpleasant and an insult to g-funk and also ew. And since I’m running out of space, here’s a list of everything tied to Anne-Marie that is ew, because she is the worst new pop girl and nobody can change my mind -- the opening riff has her jumping between registers and sounds terrible, whoever convinced her that rapping was a good idea should be shot, ending the first lines of the chorus with elongated syllables is terrible whoever you are and even worse with her part accent, part permanently congested voice, she doesn’t enunciate the spelling so it sounds like she’s saying “FRINDS”, even though attempting to spell the word properly wouldn’t even fit the fucking meter anyway so what’s the point oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck i hate it

**enecks** (0): This is a hot mess that isn't even enjoyable on any angle. Apart from todd in the shadows style roasts.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): This song gets on my nerves so much every time I hear it on the radio. Like yes you have made it very obvious that you just want to be friends. You don’t have to repeat that 1000 times very obnoxiously.

**zekkyzach** (0): was a 3 until everything after the bleep happened

Marshmello continues to not evoke positive emotions from Popheads, with his second and final song exiting here. Back when this was released, I would have agreed wholeheartedly with its placement, but while listening to it for the rate it really grew on me. I think Selena’s whispery coos fit the vibe of the song great, and the anti-drop thing after the massive build is really cool. But it really is a grower, and I can see why it’s so low. The drop can be seen as extremely boring, and I know Whisperlena isn’t for everyone. 

---

#Furries

**Brandon6099** (10): I'VE BEEN RUNNING WITH THE WOLVES TO GET TO YOU, best Marshmello song and that is the tea, whisperlena slays <3

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): Popheads will say it's basic but Selena sounds great on this track and I love the guitar-heavy background.

**piccprincess** (10): blindly stanning regardless of production issues

**ramskick** (10): I'd crawl with the wolves just to listen to this song another 100 times.

**selegend** (10): I know it’s not an excellent song, but I really enjoy the atmosphere and Selena’s soft pigeon coos

**singularlegend** (9.5): deserved to smash

**PuggleMaster** (9): Honestly I just listen to this song for the drop

**vhqv1997** (9): This song is a 10 but I just can't forgive that cover art and that music video

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): this is cute but i cant not look at the cover and laugh at marshmello's goofy smile next to the wolf and selena

**MashLuke** (8): I love this although it's nothing crazy. I just dig anything Selena does.

**Me-Luigi** (8): watt and marshmello kinda snapped here

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I confused this with Anywhere by Rita Ora for some reason but looking back I actually don't think I've ever listened to Anywhere

**timothy444** (8): Disappointing how such a great build-up gets destroyed by a lacklustre drop. But then, it’s Marshmello so it should be expected. However, The production on the verse is amazing and it builds up hype though it is ruined like all of his other works.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i didn't like this initially but the drop actually bops once you get to used to it

**vulture\_couture** (8): kinda similar to Let Me Go but the chorus hits home way more. "i've been running through the jungle i've been running with the wolves to get to you" <3

**SkyBlade79** (7.5): tbh I think this is very underrated and way better than It Ain’t Me

#Marshmello roasted over the fire

**1998tweety** (8.3): This isn't bad but as a follow up to Bad Liar and Fetish I was so disappointed.

**sbb618** (8): Worse than I remembered? Does that make sense?

**Chevsapher** (7.8): I like the beginning and I like the lyrics. Unfortunately, the "chorus" is disappointing, and the track as a whole sounds rather disjointed.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Whenever I hear this song I think of that really uncomfortable performance of AMA’s by her of this song. I still don’t know if she was acting that way on purpose, or if she was heavily on drugs (probably both). The song is just alright though.

**ManofOranges** (7.5): Ugh this song sounds so good and then you get to the chorus and it's just Selena moaning??? The pre-chorus really builds up so hard and that's what we get???

**MrSwearword** (7): even the wolves wouldn't eat this but at least the production attempts to mask Selena Gomez's many many vocal flaws

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): generic yet catchy.

**tapdancingpig** (7): Selena Gomez is the best part of this damn song, and it’s not even close. I know that we call her “whisper Queen” and “the worst pop singer,” but she sells the song. She does everything it asks for and gives it more atmosphere than it deserves. The drop is dumb and pointless, and there should be a bridge, but Selena almost makes it work.

**FireLordAegon** (6.8): This is probably one of the worst songs in my library that I regularly bop to- second only to FRIENDS -but I guess Marshmello is a guilty pleasure ¯(ツ)/¯

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): booooring

**gannade** (6.5): the verses are great but the drop is so bad

**diamondblaze413** (6): why were we fronting on the cover art tbh if you don't know three wolf moon you should

**evilqueenlex** (6): It's meh but better sounding than a lot of the other meh songs on this list.

**jamesfog** (6): Meh

**LandonKidatrea** (6): I want to compare this song to She Wolf, the other song in this rate that uses wolf imagery. This song sounds much more cohesive. It actually sounds like Marshmello's beat plays into Selena's strengths as a singer. As a result this song sounds way better. But there's a dissonance between how this song sounds and its themes and lyrics. The wolf imagery falls flat. This doesn't sound feral enough.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): selena wyd

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I really still can’t get over the three wolf moon single cover

**xxrandooxx** (6): if the drop was better, coulda had a better score

**notdallin** (5.2): FIX WOLVES

**Adorable\_Raccoon** (5): no matter how many times i've heard this song I always forget what it sounds like

**Leixander** (5): too generic even for EDM

**radiofan15** (4.5): Ugly cover art aside, this is generic and quite boring... also the Pop Whisperer sounds half-asleep... and the drop is one of the laziest i've heard in my life

**camerinian** (4): God I almost liked this one because this was the first Marshmello song where the buildup actually had a good degree of intensity and swell to it, and Selena’s hook are getting better and better as of late, but dun dun dun dun dunAH HA HAAAAAAAA is one of the most worthless, unsatisfying drops I think any major producer has had on a single

**ImADudeDuh** (4): always been boring to me tbh.

**kappyko** (4): Selena's voice is great for EDM/chill pop on her solo music, but I feel like Marshmello really disappoints on this. It's a little too generic for its own good.

**lilguavachan** (4): that drop was very shitty, the rest of the song is decent

**marcryan** (3): Good Verses, Bad Chorus

**twat\_brained** (3): The lyrics make little to no sense. Why would you run through the jungle with wolves? Aren't they found in snowy forests? And that cover art? Dreadful. Zedd, I'm sorry. I was too harsh on "I Want You to Know". You were able to make something work with Selena. Marshmello is just not giving me anything here.

**Bendariaku89** (2): ARGGGGGHHHHHHH, THIS SONG SOUNDED SO GOOD IN THE FIRST VERSE. sounded so much like daughter (see lifeforms and smother) that i thought it was headed in that direction, then i realized we were in an EDM rate and sadly knew that i wouldn’t be getting that slow melancholic song that it was presenting. i guess that’s why I hate this. it starts of interesting, then gets into that bland EDM buildup prechorus into the drop which doesn’t even sound great. ITS JUST A DISAPPOINTMENT. the verses raise my rate to a two, but they just represent what could’ve been.

**frogaranaman** (2): At least the song itself is not as bad as the cover art would suggest.

**awryj** (1): selener truly did that

**enecks** (1): This is so limp and vapid. Fuck Marshmello

**Johnnytoby** (0): skksksks I thought this was it ain't me the first time I was rating almost giving it a 10 fuck this song

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (0): They really thought they deconstructed the genre with this horrible drop lol

**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): SeLeNa GoMeZ iS a TaLeNtEd VoCaLiSt

This mega-collab between two producers and two huge pop stars sounds better in theory, but ends up just being a mess. It has it all - annoying production (those noises during the verses, mmm), and terrible lyrics (Yes I do the cooking, yes I do the cleaning / Plus I keep the na-na real sweet, for your eating / Yes you be the boss, and yes I be respecting, ugh we stan misogyny) - what more could you ask for in an EDM song? At least Bebe got her name credited, initially it was just Nicki’s name on this song!

---

#Hello, mother.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): hearing this was a trip

**Bendariaku89** (10): this song took me off guard so much that i didn’t really register this at first until the second listen. it’s SOOOO GREAT. even if i’m not super okay with nicki, the entire ensemble and song just punches so great with bebe’s HEY MAMA HEY MAMA and that after chorus.

**kappyko** (10): This song is pure noise, Bebe mostly moaning and Nicki putting in some weak verses over subpar production and a weird sample(?), what could possibly be good abWHOLE CREW GOT THE JUICE YOUR DICK GAME THE TRUTH MY SCREAMS IS THE PROOF THEM OTHER DUDES GET THE DEUCE AAAA WHO AM I SHITTING I lOVE THIS LMFAO also the first verse is great lol

**Me-Luigi** (10): trap EDM BOP! Pity that Bebe initially wasn't credited and still a lot of people don't know she wrote and sings the chorus, this is like guetta's last big hit and it didn't age that bad. Nicki's verses are also very enjoyable, more so than on a lot of her solo material

**sbb618** (10): This song has it all. Crazy chorus buildup, great features, a bonkers sample from an Alan Lomax prison song...Not a huge fan of the turn in the bridge, but it still works.

**1998tweety** (9): Nicki is a queen haters stay pressed that you can't cancel her hihi. Always coming for her cause she's more talented and relevant than your flop faves? Seethe. Bebe queenie too.

**Brandon6099** (9): classic bop bebe underrated

**Chevsapher** (9): I feel so gross listening to this song, but it's such an earworm.

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): A jam that Bebe fought for her deserved credit on

**singularlegend** (9): excellent

**vhqv1997** (9): This is how the public was introduced to Bebe Rexha, by mistaking her for Nicki Minaj

**vulture\_couture** (9): Somehow the four people involved combine their powers to create one of the biggest bangers of the decade - and yet the lyrics are horrid enough for me not to give it a 10. But like if Nicki wants to do the cookin and the cleanin good for her I guess

**Leixander** (8): acthscually nicki dissed j-lo's "I Ain't Your Mama" here!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): why is Bebe unrecognizable in this track

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This entire song is produced to make you think that Nicki is singing the verses justice for Bebe

**seralite** (8): yes... i do keep the nana real sweet for your eating.

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): pretty catchy. kind of basic though.

**radiofan15** (7.9): The trailer of every comedy up to 2017 quite ruined this song for me but then relistening I got reminded of how much of a bop this is... also no shade to Bebe but I first though it was Nicki singing the chorus

**tapdancingpig** (7.6): Very well constructed pop track. Nicki has an enjoyably weird rap verse, Bebe sells the shit out of that chorus, and the production is definitely memorable.

**diamondblaze413** (7.5): bebe's stealth game top tier just sneaking the hell into deserved relevance

**ramskick** (7): hey mama this song is pretty good.

**FireLordAegon** (6.5): This song is equally cringey as it is catchy

**LandonKidatrea** (6): Bebe Rexha's voice has all the force of a goddamn explosion. She's easily the highlight of the song.

#Feminist queens

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I remember when everyone thought Bebe Rexha was Rihanna in this song...those were the days. Also we should have rated Where Them Girls At, where Nicki actually has a good verse.

**MashLuke** (6.5): this is a bop but a careless kind of bop, not a quality bop.

**twat\_brained** (6.4): Why the hell is Nicki submitting to David with these lyrics? He turns you on once and 3 years later you decide to just come out with these lyrics? Also, can we talk about "your dick came the truth"? I don't wanna know what a lying ejaculation is like. Thankfully, Bebe's appearance is restricted to just the hook, and she really is the life of the song. Imagine being outshined by Bebe goddamn Rexha despite her having at most 1/4 of the solo runtime you have on the song.

**PuggleMaster** (6): I love nicki but this song was horrid

**rotating3Dtext** (6): the first time I was confused to hear those lyrics coming from nicki tbh

**evilqueenlex** (5.5): Nicki's flow is kinda whack in this song. The horns save this song.

**frogaranaman** (5): I did not realize half of these people were featured on this song.

**monkeyattacks** (5): Song aged like milk. Not well.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Yes, I’ll be your woman, yes, I’ll be your Bebe Rexha; born August 30, 1989) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer.[1] She is known for songs such as "I’m a Mess" "Meant to Be" with Florida Georgia Line, "Me, Myself & I" with G-Eazy, and "In the Name of Love" with Martin Garrix. She has also written songs for various artists such as Selena Gomez, Nick Jonas, and Eminem.[2][3]

**timothy444** (5): David Guetta somehow managed to make everyone in the song sound annoying as hell. Nicki Minaj’s parts are just unbearable and it’s painful to get through. It honestly sounds like David made this in an hour. However, the chorus isn’t that bad (I’m not sure if Bebe Rexha is singing there because she sounds young as hell here) and is pleasurable at times to listen, if only to serve as a rest period between those awful verses.

**notdallin** (4.9): Poor lyrical performances from all players here and they should be ashamed of themselves. Without that soaring Bebe chorus, this would definitely be a nothing song.

**yatcho** (4.5): This song is kinda... gross

**marcryan** (4): Nicki sounded good but I felt it was incomplete.

**selegend** (3): This song is obnoxious

**camerinian** (2): did this song exist before movie trailers, or did the movie trailers with this song in it exist before the song? 🤔🤔🤔

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (2): This did not deserve to be a hit

**Adorable\_Raccoon** (1): i'm mad you reminded me this song exists

**enecks** (1): Kanye outsold.

**MrSwearword** (1): TRASH. The lyric pointout from the last time I played apache and scalped this shitty song but with more FUCK YOU added to it

**ComeOnPupperfish** (0): nicki sweetie what was that second verse???

**lilguavachan** (0): everyone on this track can eat 10 tons of shit for this misogynistic trash heap of a "song".

Whom’st’d’ve? In all honesty, this rate could have been cut down to just 50 songs, but I thought it would be fun to include two more lesser-known songs that give a sort of duality - deep cuts from C-tier pop girls re-released albums. The other, Ellie Goulding’s Stay Awake, is still in, but unfortunately this bop is cut here. Though I like it, I can see how the production could be seen as cheap and generic, and clearly the greater majority saw that too. Oh well, let’s just make sure we don’t let Tove’s next album flop as hard as Blue Lips. 

---

#We can run on love in a hopeless place

**Bendariaku89** (11): i just love that sort of slight desperation for clinging onto a relationship even if they both know it won’t and shouldn’t last. i mean i relate to that sentiment a lot, which is probably why i love this song as much as i do. the production helps me love it so much more as well, with those guitars, almost chiptune notes, reverb synths in the background, and that small build up using the tunes. it just screams some nostalgia in me which i appreciate. the chiptunes that plays behind the chorus. the melancholic tone of the entire song, while staying upbeat matches the message of the lyrics so much, UGH IT’S SO GOOD. this song just makes me wish for such a better life than what i have, but i just kind of accept everything and go with what we have. love. THANKS FOR LISTENTING TO THIS TED TALK ON RUN ON LOVE. (honorary mention to let me go for my 11)

**diamondblaze413** (10): HOLY SHIT WHAT IS THIS IT'S PERFECT

**MashLuke** (10): this is one of Tove's best songs. The drop is insanely good.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i strongly prefer the QOTC remix, but this bangs hard as well.

**skargardin** (10): I’m now more convinced than ever that Tove Lo has got the perfect voice for EDM features.

**SkyBlade79** (10): some more of Tove’s best IMO… perfect video, cute but SO SAD, just… I’ve cried to this multiple times. I do acknowledge that it’s a grower so I won’t be too mad about placement (and I know y’all have bad taste)

**Chevsapher** (9): I've never heard this before, but dang, Tove never disappoints.

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): Tove's smoky vocals really make this song click for me and I like that the drop is a bit more understated.

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): oh wow I love this drop. BIG bop !

**notdallin** (8.1): really like the chorus here but DAE feel like this is directly trying to mimic the success of “We Found Love”?

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): queen of thinking green

**jamesfog** (8): Never heard this bop

**ramskick** (8): this rating is running on my love of Tove Lo.

**vulture\_couture** (8): this should be bad but the beat is too strong man

#Whom'st'd'v'e?

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I saw Sky in the comments section of this one's music video and I screamed Sky are you here congrats on the rate I'm sorry for giving this song a 7.5

**xxrandooxx** (7.5): i feel like this song could grow on me

**1998tweety** (7.3): Surprisingly the drop is my favourite part of the song for once, the rest of the track is meh though.

**Brandon6099** (7): love you Lorde but.... thank u, next

**camerinian** (7): this is a cute little song. Don't really know why the drop is significantly louder than the verses, but I've always liked Tove Lo's writing, and this is a nice little capture of a strong moment

**marcryan** (7): You got me listening to this low budget?

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): kind of noisy and cluttered. the electric guitar solo is really nice though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song is serving serious 2012 vibes

**timothy444** (6.3): Okay, why are rating irrelevants like Lucas Nord? Either way, it’s not really good and it sounds like something out of GarageBand.

**MrSwearword** (6): pleasant enough but not worth my attention

**twat\_brained** (6): No matter what, I'll be rating this again in Sky's rate with Ellie and Sia. So, with that in mind, this just feels like your everyday club filler, complete with vague and sparse lyrics about heartbreak. Not to discredit Tove's experiences with heartbreak or her desperation at the third stage of grief, but this just doesn't do anything for me.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): the melody just isn’t there and the lack of a hook makes this disappointing

**ignitethephoenix** (4): Boring and generic.

**Me-Luigi** (4): actually didn't know this song before but this is not it

**seralite** (4): both of these tove lo songs are underwhelming sadly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): no offense but like why is this here lol

**piccprincess** (3): what is this

**frogaranaman** (1): Ah, so there is a reason I haven’t heard this song before!

**Johnnytoby** (1): I'm just dissapointed

**radiofan15** (1): Does this song really deserves a comment? NO IT DOESN'T

Ah, The Chainsmokers! Popheads’ most favourite producers and active subreddit users. Unfortunately for them and Daya (who seems to have vanished after her couple hits in 2016), Popheads is not here for the obnoxious fart-like drop and hollow and uninspired vocal performance. Frankly, I’m glad this flopped in the rate - definitely one of my least faves here. 

---

#Daya stans

**bigenemies** (10): This song gets me so hyped. I love playing it while I run, it’s the prefect tempo. There’s something about the drop that really speaks to my body. It has a low-key sexy, dark quality to it. Love.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): I adore this song to bits and pieces because it fits my dramatic bitch moments when I'm lipsyncing alone in my apartment

**Leixander** (10): Their best song tbh.

**MashLuke** (10): This song is great, I remember the day it came out I downloaded it right away. That drop is so good and Daya's vocals really make it.

**Me-Luigi** (10): AN EMILY WARREN ORIGINAL SUNG BY LGBT TALENT we love a grammy winning song

**mms82** (10): check out the Illenium remix for the greatest version of this bop!

**timothy444** (9.6): Screw what other people say about this song, this is one of Daya’s best and it’s a tragic love song that everyone knows ends in letting someone down. It’s emotional and I think I cried once when I listened to this five times in a row. I can never get sick of this song.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): I have a few nitpicks about this song (namely, Daya's pronunciation and the length of the second verse), but this really is a catchy and well-done track. The ad-libs toward the end are my favorite part.

**tapdancingpig** (9.5): I listened to this song a LOT when it first came out. Parts of the song didn’t age well, but I still like it, and the final chorus THRILLS.

**1998tweety** (9.4): A mega bop, the chorus goes hard but tbh it does get a bit repetitive/annoying after a while. The way how the song revs up at the bridge is awesome though.

**frogaranaman** (9): Me as I am being carried over a puddle of water because I don’t like getting wet.

**lilguavachan** (9): you'd think dollar store halsey would get on my nerves, but this is the one song she's decent on

**ManofOranges** (9): This one is probably gonna go out quick and I admit that it's probably not that good but like I listened to this song on repeat through the whole of the summer of 2016 like I would listen to it all the time and I really don't know why but I guess it's cause I have taste.

**MrSwearword** (9): still the best song to their name

**radiofan15** (8.7): Although it loses some steam by the third drop it still snaps... altough Daya sounds awful in it

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I like this song and the production a lot (along with Daya’s vocals) but the beat drop in the chorus is my least favourite part. I feel like every single car commercial overplayed the drop to death so it irritates me slightly.

**sbb618** (8.5): Not as good as Closer, but sufficiently catchy.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): this still sounds fresh good job bros

**bespectacIed** (8): That bridge is killer

**Brandon6099** (8): DON'T LET ME DOWN DOWN DOWNNNN

**jamesfog** (8): Grammy winning singer Daya

**singularlegend** (6.5): they made points here

#Please let me down

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): idk it’s definitely a banger but production feels super hollow for some reason.

**yatcho** (7.5): Iss aight I guess...

**notdallin** (7.1): TURN DOWN FOR DON’T LET ME

**Johnnytoby** (7): Something always felt off about this song to me mixing wise

**ramskick** (7): sadly Daya's future career did in fact let me down.

**vulture\_couture** (7): I regret to inform this is still somewhat fun

**awryj** (6.8): the progression to the sax drop kinda saves this song

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): roses but bad (also I hate the video so much)

**twat\_brained** (6.2): Never forget this song has earned Alex, Drew and Daya each a whole ass GRAMMY. The guitar riff in the verses is brilliant, and so is the buildup to the drop. It's just the drop that's sadly a letdown. That's sadly ironic considering the title, isn't it?

**CritneySpearz** (6): Used to love this song, but the drop annoys me now idk why.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): featuring Gaya.

**LandonKidatrea** (6): Daya sounds amazing here. 2:12 to 3:28 is the highlight of her career. Sucks that the Chainsmokers fumbled the most important part. There's an edit of this song that replaces all the drops with the final drop and it sounds WAY BETTER.

**piccprincess** (6): This drop is what the recession is going to sound like

**xxrandooxx** (6): This drop flat out kills me the Illenium remix is 110% better but hey I saw daya at a college orientation concert so I have to stan my girl Daya.

**diamondblaze413** (5): i know nobody has heard it but i wanna know is clearly the better daya-featured trap song

**enecks** (5): This is the worst of their 2016 hits. Kinda annoying.

**marcryan** (5): I saw Daya sing this live at a college orientation concert. Queen of promoting in midwestern Wisconsin.

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Remember when we thought Daya was going to have a career? Good on the girl for coming out, though. It's a shame the only song of hers that's going to be remembered has this messy of a drop.

**selegend** (5): Grating drop on an otherwise fine pop song

**SkyBlade79** (5): overrated imo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Top 3 worst drops: 3) Dropping in Tilted Towers. 2) The DOW drop of 1,175.21 points on February 5, 2018. 1) The Chainsmokers - Don’t Let Me Down (feat. Daya).

**FireLordAegon** (4): This is quite horrible, it got a little better though at the end

**PuggleMaster** (4): this song getting over played on the radio absolutely ruined it for me

**evilqueenlex** (3.5): This song is bad I don't care what anyone says. That instrumental hook is probably the worst out of the all the songs on this list but the singer is decent so I'm not going to give it a one.

**seralite** (3): ugh i really dont like this one

**TragicKingdom1** (3): i used to tolerate this but it got REALLY bad after a year of radio play. the drop is disgusting and daya sounds extremely disinterested. it could also afford to be like a minute shorter

**camerinian** (2): I know this is probably rude because of her age but I’m really glad Daya doesn’t seem like she’s gonna continue being a thing. Doesn’t help that she’s on easily the most ear-grating drop and dour, unsatisfying single The Chainsmokers ever released either

**Bendariaku89** (1): liked it at first but realized i kind of feel distanced from it after looking back. i don’t think it’s a rehash of anything they’ve done, and the drop has some sultriness in it that i appreciate. the verses bore me to death though that the drop can’t save it.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): who let the '' sit still look pretty '' girl have another hit?

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (1): This beat drop is definitely in the top 10 ugliest sounds I've had the displeasure of hearing

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): Manages to be both terrible and bland at the same time somehow, so props to that.

Remember Sean Paul? Temperature really is that bop. A couple years ago, with the boom of trop-pop, he made a resurgence on this song as well as Sia’s Cheap Thrills. It was kind of wild, tbh. How could you deny those amazing ad-libs? This song is just kind of weird lyrically - it contrasts a pretty standard trop pop bop with lyrics about… single mothers? Sean Paul does the absolute MOST to be, well, Sean Paul, and then Anne-Marie is also there I guess. I wonder if she’ll ever truly cross over to North America, or if she’ll be forever stuck in the bubbling under chart with 2002. 

---

#Single mothers

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): daily struggle

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I get this is good, but why was this a hit over Symphony?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): im not entirely sure how a song with lyrics dealing with a single mother barely making it bops, but here we are

**monkeyattacks** (10): A great song.

**radiofan15** (10): Sean Paul's career surviving this long is one thing that would never cease to amaze me... but i'm glad it is like this because "daily strugle" really adds a lot to this depressing bop

**SkyBlade79** (10): this is such a god damn bop even with the weird subject material

**timothy444** (9.4): Not really the ‘Rather Be’ killer but it does come close! Sean Paul feels a bit out of touch in this song but Anne-Marie is delightful to sing and tell the story about a single mother who is just trying to survive instead of going the generic route. Shout out to the cinematic bridge as well.

**1998tweety** (9.2): Feminist independent woman-centered BOP. Sean Paul and Anne-Marie are both icons. I know this song is gonna get some criticism for some weird lyrics but honestly it all works and takes something that's a bit hard to talk about and accept, and turns it into a massive bop.

**bloupp** (9): I can see how this song could be annoying but personally I love it.

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): a soaring, multi-layered song. also, kudos for writing about the struggles of being a single mom, rather than singing about the same generic “love” stuff that permeates mainstream pop. my only critique is that Sean Paul’s vocals are lowkey just incoherent mumbling.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Sean Pauls ad-libs in this song are so ridiculous, but it's still good

**BearlyEvenAPun** (8.5): I hope you're ready for all the 'DAILY STRUGGLE's

**Chevsapher** (8.5): I really like it everything about this song except Sean Paul's annoyingly proliferative interjections.

**notdallin** (8.5): I’ve been starved for a good strong thematic element through all of these EDM songs I’ve been listening to. This song not only builds upon a topic that is often overlooked in pop music (i.e., the struggle of single mothers) but takes that theme and empowers it through a catchy af tropical house beat.

**sbb618** (8.3): Sean Paul yelling randomly over the whole song might've worked for Sia, but it doesn't work here.

**enecks** (8): This sounds amazing but also Anne-Marie is the worst pop girl right now and Sean Paul is as shouty as a carpet commercial. But damn it this is so well intentioned.

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): A cheery tune that doesn't at all fit its depressing subject matter

**marcryan** (8): Subtract Sean Paul

**PuggleMaster** (8): this song is so messy but it's a earworm

**ramskick** (8): this song does not rockabye me to sleep.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): this is so confusing. i must have heard this song two hundred times on the radio and for some reason i still enjoy listening to it. it’s an edm song with cringy lyrics about a single mother with sean paul saying biddybong over orchestral string instruments

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): something about it is grating

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): For some reason I don’t remember hearing Sean Paul’s part on the radio ever when they played this song. Or did I block it out?

**MashLuke** (7.5): shout out to all the single mums out there.

**diamondblaze413** (7): i will love and appreciate the bounce

**frogaranaman** (7): DAAAYLEE SDRUDDL~

**TragicKingdom1** (7): DAILY STRUGGLE!! should've been a bigger meme

**vulture\_couture** (7): I... what is happening? A dance song about the struggles of single motherhood with the kind of annoyingly catchy chorus that makes you wanna tear your ears out? Somehow works?

**bbfan132** (6.7): DAILY STRUGGLE

#DAILY STRUGGLE

**Brandon6099** (7): classic bop but not into it

**cyborglilith** (7): Sean Paul ruins every song he's in.

**lilguavachan** (6.5): why do i not remember this song? it's alright. i'll probably forget about it again.

**CritneySpearz** (6): Anne-Marie is a queen, but Sean Paul is so obnoxious omg.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): You know what? I actually liked Rockabye a lot like, a year ago, but now I'm listening to it on my own I'm starting to realise why everybody thinks it's super annoying.

**selegend** (6): City High’s “What Would You Do” reimagined as a trop pop song - not quite as good though; Sean Paul takes away from the seriousness of the song tbh

**singularlegend** (6): she's ok

**tapdancingpig** (6): This song is frustrating. I like parts of it. The production is fun, and I like Anne-Marie and the pre-chorus hook works really well for me, but trop-pop fatigue is real, the chorus is annoying, and the lyrics feel... icky

**yatcho** (5.5): I once heard a version of this on the radio without any of the Sean Paul adlibs but his verse was still in, it was the most bizarre radio edit and made me appreciate the DAILY STRUGGLE

**LandonKidatrea** (5): Sean Paul is my fave pop girl

**kappyko** (4.5): everybody on this song can do better than this smh.

**awryj** (4): DAILY STRUGGLE

**evilqueenlex** (4): I can't take this song seriously after hearing Sean Paul ad lib "DAILY STRUGGLE!" The sound doesn't fit the subject matter. City High did the upbeat song about a struggling single mom better.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Honestly, an iconic mess. But, it's still a mess

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): Ironic how this song is about the hard work mothers put in, because I put in a similar amount of effort to prevent myself from skipping this track.

**unovachamp** (4): I still can't believe this was a UK Christmas number one. That's kind of a big deal for a so-so song.

**camerinian** (3): So the story of this song doesn't remotely fit the tone of the track, Sean Paul doesn't fit either side of it, this has next to none of the unique qualities that make Clean Bandit interesting, Anne-Marie is one of the most worthless new pop girls, and still this song is somehow more boring and forgettable than it is bad. Weird

**Johnnytoby** (3): God I know it's supposed to be inspirational but I cant take this song seriously

**MrSwearword** (3): what the hell is this clusterfuck; at least they shoutout single moms

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (3): I would say this was ruined by radio overplay but the truth is it was never even good to begin with.

**Bendariaku89** (1): i just hate this. the entire song just sounds so hamfisted and really bad that i couldn’t ever listen to this song. in fact, this is pretty irrational because to be fair, this song doesn’t really have anything “bad” persay, just that for me, everything together just makes me irritated, from the drop to the rapper, to the voice and the beat and the chorus melody and all of that. i just really can’t vibe with the song and like this song even if the single mother message is great.

**strawberryswing1** (1): something about a song about single motherhood over EDM production makes me feel uncomfortable lol. I was happy when this song stopped playing on the radio.

**Me-Luigi** (0): DAILY STRUGGLE

**seralite** (0): i despise this song

**twat\_brained** (0): wtf I wanted to do this rate to bop along to silly love songs with a fun electrobeat not get emo over single moms barely clearing the poverty line. This is a really hard song to pull off, and I don't even know if a male vocallist was necessary, but why Sean Paul? I'd rather have had Ed Sheeran or someone who knows how to pull at listeners' heartstrings. Who listens to Sean Paul and thinks he's right for a song with touchy subject matter?  Also, I'm just not into Anne-Marie, and I don't even know why. Do I just not get her? Then again, who is her target audience? It's unclear, which, I suppose, worked in her favor since this was a Christmas #1 in the UK, but it's an uneasy listening experience altogether. I'm not even sure if this is the song I hate the most in the rate, but for all this spiel about a song I am just wholly uninterested in, it has to be a 0 from me.

Hailee Steinfeld, extraordinary actress known for being among the youngest people nominated for an Academy Award, took a break from her thriving acting career to take a swing at music. While it worked out for her bigger hits, this one, aided by everyone’s favourite music duo Florida Georgia Line, did not do as well, peaking at 40 on the hot 100. I think the main problem is that it it just doesn’t do anything particularly exciting - the buildup to the drop is anthemic and fun, but the release just isn’t there. The muffled synths just aren’t enough to stand out positively, especially in a rate full of much more exciting drops. 

---

#Haileegot

**1998tweety** (10): A massive bop, I love the chorus with multiple vocal lines on it, makes it feel a lot bigger. This song absolutely deserves day 3 but you cause have awful taste and hate jerk FGL so it'll be lucky to make day 2. The way Hailee ends the song is bittersweet.

**animefangrant62** (10): , haileEGOT strikes again with another big bop, this time featuring those silk tongued gods known as Florida Georgia Line

**Bendariaku89** (10): look, I FUCK WITH THIS SONG, though i can understand why one wouldn’t. it does have that sort of unneeded EDM drop. it has that vibe which most people associate with generic. for me though, i just relate to this song’s message. having that knowledge that i’m making a relationship awful and i just wish my other partner would just realize that or just find someone more healthy than me to be friends with but our relationship’s still there and i just wanna blast this song at them, and tell them to be happy and WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL FRIENDS WITH ME WHEN YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO ME SO MUCH THAT IT HURTS YOU DEEP ENOUGH TO HAVE DEPRESSION I WANNA HELP BUT ITS ALL LOSE/LOSE... ahem. anyway, that sentiment just hits me deep and that’s why i just love this song. the beat legit makes me wanna dance just wearing underwear and a hoodie on a car i don’t even own in the rain at the side of a cliff t-swift style while i cry a little too much. the vibe is just too good. also hailee sounds beautiful. WATCH BUMBLEEBEE. STREAM BACK TO YOU. THANKS FOR READING AND LISTENING TO MY TED TALK ON LET ME GO. (this isn’t my 11 tho ‘cause run on love fucking dethroned her)

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is giving me Bebe Rexha + Florida Georgia Line where the artists collabing just have me like “??????”

**timothy444** (9.2): I would’ve preferred if the song had different male vocalists but Florida Georgia Line doesn’t ruin it at all. It’s just a bit jarring seeing this EDM and country crossover work so well. The melody also isn’t generic and straightforward and has this country-like feel that overplay hasn’t killed at all. A murderous bop.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): why is this good? it has no right to be, it just... is.

**HerculesMeow** (9): I'd never heard this song before but I really liked it! I normally dislike FGL but they sounded good on this too

**ManofOranges** (9): You know I really like this song but like the chorus sounds like a wheezing robot and I really just don't know who decided that but they shouldn't have.

**Me-Luigi** (9): This is such a weird but lovely collab, watt really snapped - still funny to me that Bebe Rexha suggested FGL to be on this, they work quite well for a lil verse, the distorted guitar drop live in some performances was IT

**PuggleMaster** (9): FGL actually sound good on this. Not sure how Alesso did that but congrats!

**ramskick** (9): just to piss Q off for the most part because he hates FGL (love you Q)

**vhqv1997** (9): I like this song, but I feel like they smashed three different songs together and it only worked by sheer luck

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): haileegot won, why is watt credited on this tho

**notdallin** (8.1): LONG LIVE TROPICAL HOUSE. WHERE 👏 THAT 👏 ALBUM 👏 ALESSO 👏

**camerinian** (7.5): I wish the verses were more interesting, and Florida Georgia LIne just straight up didn’t exist, because my god what a hook. Absolute belter of a tune

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): the chorus is cool

**sbb618** (7.5): Love the chorus (or even just the transition from verse to chorus), but not really the rest of the song.

**yatcho** (7.3): Cant believe i kind of like a midtempo edm song featuring Florida Georgia Line... my absolute lack of taste omg

**singularlegend** (7): Hailee underrated mom

**vulture\_couture** (7): The chorus is very fun and FGL actually fit the song somewhat well!

#Florida Georgia Line enthusiasts

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): this is an alesso song indeed

**Chevsapher** (7): There are too many vocalists on this track, and although the production is solid, it's not enough to lure me in.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It’s okay I guess. Feels like it’s just a radio song though and nothing else.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Florida Georgia Line are my favorite women

**monkeyattacks** (7): Meh Hailee and Alesso make this song

**awryj** (6): eh

**Brandon6099** (6): bops decently, pretty generic (sorry ly Hailee <3)

**CritneySpearz** (6): Hailee is a queen but FGL is trash

**diamondblaze413** (6): second drop is really nice but fgl literally wrote half an already short verse

**evilqueenlex** (6): I hear this song all the time but never heard the intro so at first I was like "ooh I'm going to like this song" and then i heard that familiar "I'VE BEEN HOPING..." and was like ugh not this song. I never listened to this song in its entirety so I mean at least I know for sure I don't like it. This song gets a 6 for Hailee's vocals and that intro.

**golden\_bassnectar** (6): the song would be way better without FGL

**MashLuke** (6): this is fine really, it does what it does.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): It's a shame we're just limiting this rate to main pop girls, because if we didn't, we could have included more Avicii, who actually had country-influenced EDM hits worth listening to; most unfortunately, the words 'Florida Georgia Line' and 'good' are completely incompatible, unless you add a 'riddance' at the end.

**piccprincess** (6): SHUT UP AND--

**seralite** (6): ehhh its ok

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): this is probably the only acceptable thing Florida Georgia alone has ever done

**bbfan132** (5.7): the vocals/vocal editing is…. :S also, boring production does not earn any points from me

**frogaranaman** (5): Reminds me of puking.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): This song was a solid 7 before FGL came in, because they both don't fit the song and are there for like 20 seconds.

**Leixander** (5): a collab that doesn't work!

**MrSwearword** (5): oh look Florida Georgia Line ruins something; SHOCKER

**selegend** (5): Would be 10x better without FGL tbh

**Johnnytoby** (4.5): Hailey has done better

**SinfulAnarchy** (4.5): I used to like this song, but now, every time it plays on my local radio station, I internally groan. it sounds super derivative and formulaic, and the beat is annoying. lyrics are also generic trash.

**Adorable\_Raccoon** (4): i do not like her indie girl impression or the chorus effect in the chorus. It's only a year old but it sounds dated.

**bespectacIed** (4): Cute chorus

**marcryan** (4): 4 for the 4 artists in the song

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): That synth in the drop is unsettling

**tapdancingpig** (4): Eh. Just... boring. Cliched hook, boring drop, uninteresting-but-competent vocalist (Hailey Steinfeld, not FGL. If it weren’t for the country fuckers, I would have given it a 5).

**twat\_brained** (4): This is an Alesso song? This can't be the same man behind "More Than You Know". Well, one major difference here is that there's a total nobody in Watt, on the track, compared to Seb Ingrosso, 1/3 of perhaps the greatest dance band since Daft Punk, and a Hailee Steinfeld who sounds marginally less lifeless than she did on "Starving". And Florida Georgia Line, of all people, is on the track somehow. Why? Frankly, my dears, I don't give a damn. In fact, it seems the only person who did was Hailee on the chorus. If nothing else, I give her credit for that.

**xxrandooxx** (4): there's alot goin on in this

**radiofan15** (3.7): I like Hailee and wish her the best but yikes... this is more generic than a Lil Baby and Gunna deep cut

**LandonKidatrea** (3): Florida Georgia Line are my fave pop girls.

**skargardin** (3): personality lost

**SkyBlade79** (2): the drop hurts my head so much

**enecks** (1): Forget Meant To Be - this is the real enemy.

**lilguavachan** (1): fuck you alesso. the drop is just dreadful, hailee... gurl go back to acting or whatever you did before your wet fart of a music career, and i'm not going to address the others in this song because that would mean having to acknowledge that they exist in some capacity and i'm not going to do that to myself, thank you.

**mich4725** (1): Just meh, those vocal chopped hooks are so overused

Before planning this rate, I forgot this song existed. It didn’t do so hot in the US, but was a smash in a lot of other countries. Released in 2010, this song seems to take after the trashy electropop hits of that time (Like A G6, anyone?), rather than the full-on EDM trend that took North America by storm about a year or two after the fact. As such, it’s understandably rated low here, most certainly showing its age and having a gratingly vocal-pitched chorus. That’s two losses for Queen Rihanna, but maybe her work with Calvin Harris can do better! 

---

#It's Britney, bitch

**awryj** (10): i love this song and i will never be ashamed of it

**jamesfog** (10): A BOP.

**kappyko** (10): david guetta is so damn selfish he gave her "right now" for her album but saved this for himself what a scumbag

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented Auto Tune Cher who

**MrSwearword** (10): this could've been a smash in the States if either's label had bothered to release it here

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): classique

**skargardin** (10): Peak 2010s

**strawberryswing1** (10): ugh take me back to 2010

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Super glad we were blessed of this bubblegum EDM pop sound from Rih at least once, since I don't think we'll ever hear this again

**evilqueenlex** (9): "my heart is a dancer beating like a disco dream" is so poetic and "she's a mean-eyed crazy addicted disco diva" is an aspiration.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Is you don’t think this is a fun song, you have no soul.

**singularlegend** (9): THROWBACK

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Who’s that Czech?

**twat\_brained** (8.1): I swear, I heard this like 15 times at all the middle school dances and bar mitzvah parties I went to (Judaism was the majority religion in my high school grade), and never once on the radio. The lyric video was also really mesmerizing to me at age 12 since it was the first proper "lyric video" I can ever remember witnessing. Fun song, fun memories attached to it, good shit all around.

**Chevsapher** (8): I've never heard this before... I like the density in the production, but the vocal processing sounds really off. The hook is odd too. It's disappointing, because those synths are so interesting!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): who is she tho? like... anyone could've sung this.

**diamondblaze413** (8): the 90s died in 2012 here's proof

**ramskick** (8): nobody ever says 'who's that chick' when Rihanna is playing.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): who’s that c h i c k. I like it in a dumb club song way [2]

**radiofan15** (7.8): Probably the weakest of Rihanna's EDM collabs but that really says a lot of how strong they generally are

#IT'S PIKACHU!!! FUCK

**1998tweety** (7.6): Omg I rihmember bopping to this song but I never knew it was Rihanna. It's ok, hasn't aged the best tbh.

**camerinian** (7.5): I mean, Rihanna kind of sounds like ass through the auto-tune here, but it’s the most fun I think David Guetta’s production has ever sounded, so I’ll give him points for that.

**sbb618** (7.5): The way Rihanna says "chick" in the chorus sounds like it was hastily dubbed in. Also, what exactly is a disco drum?

**MashLuke** (7): very campy.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): one do the only songs that can be said to not have been improved by rihanna

**Brandon6099** (6): not my taste either :(

**vhqv1997** (6): This song aged like milk

**vulture\_couture** (6): super dated but fun

**timothy444** (5.9): Very outdated to the point where I don’t even want to hear this song again. It was good for its time, that’s it.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): This is one of the most dated songs I've ever heard. It's not necessarily BAD, but it's such a product of its era and not in the nostalgic way.

**notdallin** (5): Like a G6’s impact

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Is this the EDM equivalent of kitzch

**cyborglilith** (4): what

**frogaranaman** (4): It honestly sounds like they’re barely trying.

**Me-Luigi** (4): (where's my interest? where's my interest?)

**SinfulAnarchy** (4): this sounds metallic and soulless. also, it’s really noisy and dated.

**yatcho** (4): Aged pretty poorly, Rihanna has absolutely no personality here

**monkeyattacks** (3.5): no, just no.

**TragicKingdom1** (3.5): this is trash, i can't believe think it was robbed of being a hit

**bbfan132** (3.4): this is just blueurguh.

**Johnnytoby** (3): check my comment for Right Now

**LandonKidatrea** (3): when Rihanna says "I don't really care" it absolutely shows. She doesn't sound like she cares AT ALL.

**lilguavachan** (2): oh rih rih, thank god you're past this shit.

**Bendariaku89** (1): what even is this song. it sounds so tacky. they tried way too hard to make this some cool party girl idc about anything blah, just sounds so bland and ugh.

**enecks** (1): David Guetta begone

**gannade** (1): david guetta is ASS

**marcryan** (1): It was sound.

**mudkip1** (0): no

**SkyBlade79** (0): this is complete garbage. Her voice on the verses makes me want to die.

**tapdancingpig** (0): I’m sorry, but the chorus is RIDICULOUSLY subpar, and the autotune does not work here (Rihanna’s vibrato does not work with it at all).

I suppose I can see how people perceive this as annoying and vapid, in fact its probably the most vapid song here, but how can you deny that beat? Smh. I have nothing else to say.

#My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

**MrSwearword** (11): SHOULD'VE BEEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE IN THE U.S. THE UK IS CANCELLED FOR ONLY ALLOWING THIS TO STALL AT #2. Sorry, let me be calm about this. THIS SLAYS. END OF DISCUSSION.

**awryj** (10): a queen and a king (this song marks the beginning of his deterioration as a producer but it's STILL A BOP)

**kappyko** (10): I better not see any of yall give this an ugly score bc of Kelis's voice bc her voice is perfect uglies

**lilguavachan** (10): oh finally some good fucking music

**PuggleMaster** (10): ok somehow i missed this song for all these years. This is AMAZING omg, it's going on my playlist immediately.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): me listening to Beethoven and his boring symphonies: 😒 me listening to Calvin Harris press 3 buttons: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/151/933/b94.jpg

**ManofOranges** (9.5): I'd never heard a Kelis track besides Milkshake but this one really hits. Her voice just sounds incredible on this and it overall sounds amazing. The only reason it's not a 10 for me is because of that part near the end where the song like escalates in pitch for no reason and it just doesn't sound right to me.

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): yoooo this is a bop and I completely forgot about it until this rate, thanks for showing me it

**timothy444** (9.4): That chord progression as well as the choice of instrument at the beginning is fire and is so unique that it grabs the listens attention. It reminds me of that Sigala song ‘Somebody’ where the beginning motif carries the whole song and it present to manipulate the track. Also, the tone and theme of the song perfectly recreates the feeling of bouncing!

**twat\_brained** (9.4): Aw man, this melody brings back memories I didn't know I had! And I didn't even know Kelis was on the song, either. I'm fairly certain this was either in intros of YouTubers I liked or radio ads for local nightclubs. It's more likely to be the latter. I think I might have heard it on Saturday night dance club radio mixes too, since that's the most logical solution I can come up with. This one gets a score boost from me purely for hidden nostalgia

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This bops, not gonna lies. Calvin’s production really shines through here and embodies the name of the song.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Kelis' voice sounds so great and the beat is really fun... points were definitely made

**bbfan132** (8.5): i remember hating this song but it’s actually a total bop? i love the part in the middle where it slows down and she just says “BOUNCE.” and her voice kind of “bounces”….

**Bendariaku89** (8.5): love the drop and the intro. has virtually no lyrical content. it does remind me of some weird ghost dj just playing this at like hotel transylania or oscar’s hotel. should be called boo-unce.

**camerinian** (8.5): This is like the perfect synthesis of vintage Calvin and peak popularity Calvin. That riff is damn fucking catchy, Kelis is a great compliment to the song, even if she doesn’t steal the show, and it’s actually really groovy, which is a trait that would just fall off a fucking cliff for him after this song and wouldn’t really come back until Slide

**Chevsapher** (8.5): The songwriting is underwhelming, but I don't care because I'm too busy listening to that great thumping bassline.

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): a catchy, effortlessly cool dance song. it gets a little too high-pitched for my taste though.

**strawberryswing1** (8.5): instrumental is a 10, I think it would have been better without any lyrics.

**diamondblaze413** (8): holy hell i forgot kelis existed but this whole thing is so CLEAR

**jamesfog** (8): Major bop

**MashLuke** (8): that bassline and the vocals, fire.

**Me-Luigi** (8): I forgot this existed but this is quite the bop, hasn't aged that badly

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I didn’t know who kelis was (now I do), but this slaps

**piccprincess** (7.5): I’m about to bounce my milkshake to get the boys to my yard

**vhqv1997** (7): I can see Mario lip-sync for his life to this song

**vulture\_couture** (7): This is some of that fun I would like to see back on the charts. I miss Kelis and Calvin Harris compliments her really well here.

#just use the exp share

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Okay, but just imagine how amazing Magikarp would be if it learned Bounce naturally. Its attack stack is abyssal, yes, but Bounce'd be able to trounce Bug and Fighting types early on and it'd make training the little fish marginally less painful. Can't we shake things up a bit, Nintendo?

#Kelis deserved to flop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): as a calvin harris fan i sadly admit this song is overrated

**tapdancingpig** (7): Not bad, but Charli did it better.

**notdallin** (6.9): I’m glad Calvin helped Kelis out so she could miss a shift or two at Arby’s to get more o’ that Milkshake caaash!

**1998tweety** (6.6): RapQueenIggy did it better

**Brandon6099** (6): an ok song meh not my taste

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): bounce

**ImADudeDuh** (6): was fine but the bridge to the "big" drop annoyed me

**Leixander** (6): i dislike early calvin sadly

**enecks** (5): For all the good stuff Calvin Harris has done he also makes some super inane stuff like this

**frogaranaman** (5): Hey guys, I found this behind-the-scenes of Calvin Harris making “Bounce”! Check it out: https://youtu.be/xjOHFFxeyOI

**radiofan15** (5): I'm quite glad that Calvin moved beyond the generic EDM song of this era because OMG this is boring!

**evilqueenlex** (4): I want to like this but I don't like it. The more I hear it the more it reminds me of a track off of Farrah Abraham's My Teenage Dream Ended but if it had polish and talent.

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): Meh, definitely a track that's more about the music than the vocals, but the music isn't all that interesting

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): i am not bouncing

**marcryan** (3): I like the instrumentals, but the vocals and lyrics aren’t there

**ramskick** (3): this song made me bounce out of any room I heard it in.

**xxrandooxx** (3): take away the voice and its video game music, which is honestly the best part of the song

**monkeyattacks** (2): First time hearing this song. Beat is the only tolerable bit for me.

**seralite** (2): never heard it before now and didnt really like it

**mudkip1** (1): this aint it

I guess this isn’t actually really electronic but whatever, producer/pop girl collaboration it is. Here, Demi invokes her inner Cha Cha Slide and gives instructions on how to do a dance of sorts. It’s in the name. Really, there’s not much interesting here, but you could go stream the Calvin Harris remix of Halsey’s Alone that Stefflon Don is also on if you want a real bop. 

---

#Bitch, I don't need introduction

**gannade** (11): a massive bop omfg

**awryj** (10): ALL MA LADIES WINE TO THE LEDT SWAY TO THE RIGHT DROP IT DOWN LOW AND TAKEI T BAACK, HIIIGH BITCH I DONT NEED INTRODUCIOTN FOLLOW MY SIMPLE FINSTRUCTION

**Bendariaku89** (10): damn that hook just sinks and drags me through a paradise and a beach or two. like that chorus just makes me want to shake my ass like i’m some bad-ass spice shaker treating these under-seasoned boys.

**Johnnytoby** (10): Ok but this Produce team deserved better

**strawberryswing1** (10): Demi should do more EDM features, I enjoy those songs from her so much more than her usual music.

**camerinian** (9.5): YO WTF THIS IS A BOP. The steel drums on the pre-chorus are a total cocktease but fuck me this is groovy as sin

**bigenemies** (9): This song causes involuntary booty shakes.

**Chevsapher** (8.5): A little cheesy, and I'm not a fan of the bridge, but that chorus is pure fun!

**diamondblaze413** (8.5): the BITCH has made my life better

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I miss Demi [2]

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): jax jones is one of this generation’s best DJs and he’s so much better than this track too

**timothy444** (8.1): A heart-racing girl empowerment anthem that’s upbeat, energetic and even has dance instructions. This song is pre-packaged party fun in a small contained box that can fit inside a smartphone or if you’re feeling old-school, an iPod.

**FireLordAegon** (8): i didn't really like it, but "bitch I don't need instruction" deserves recognition.

**MashLuke** (8): so fun, Jax Jones is highly underrated, all his singles are great.

**sbb618** (8): This one sounds pretty unique, so props for the whole drumline thing.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Why does the US hate Demi EDM team ups? She’s great at them.

**vhqv1997** (8): Is this Hoedown Throwdown but for samba?

**Brandon6099** (7): decent bop, pretty catchy I guess

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): The best of the Demi songs in this rate. The beat is really cool and I like that it sounds pretty different from everything else in the rate. It could be a little higher, but I don't like Stefflon's part.

**vulture\_couture** (7): is Demi Lovato trying to be Rihanna here? lmao but anyways this works really well, a fun fierce song that stands out from the crowd

**singularlegend** (7): it's cute

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): this is just fun. Vapid and dumb but SO FUN

#Instructions unclear

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): At least the song title tells us this is a ‘follow the instructions’ song.

**1998tweety** (7): This song is very meh for Demi's standards. The lyrics are so boring. Dua's new rules & Marina's rules > Demi's simple instructions

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): '' me and my crew we have the juice ''

**evilqueenlex** (6): This song is basically screaming "Hello, I'm your Zumba instructor for today, let's march!" "Bitch I don't need introduction" is a lyric that deserved better.

**frogaranaman** (5): People pop their pussy to this?

**LandonKidatrea** (5): Step 1. Don't pick up the phone. You know he's only calling cause he's drunk and alone.

**marcryan** (5): Demi really read me an instruction manual... Huh

**ramskick** (5): I don't need Demi Lovato to give me instructions on anything.

**xxrandooxx** (5): catchy beat

**twat\_brained** (4.6): Okay, first. The staccato on "wind to the- left" is one I can do without, because it takes me out of the song every time I listen to it. I can also do without Don's verse, because I can't really see anything of value it adds to the song. And besides, haven't we already heard these instructions from the Spice Girls' legendary Spice Up Your Life? Overlooking that song's Timbuktu lyric, that's a much better song worth streaming. As for Jax himself, I feel like he'd have a better chance if we included You Don't Know Me.

**notdallin** (4.5): https://imgur.com/a/OCO04zS

**CarlieScion** (4): this song gives me traumatic flashbacks to my zumba classes

**enecks** (4): ew

**SinfulAnarchy** (4): this is laughably bad.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): There is so much that’s annoying about this song, the weird pause before she says “left,” the way her voice is filtered, and the meh instrumental.

**Me-Luigi** (1): demi's vocals are so edited on this, she can't even sing this live, this song is atrocious

**MrSwearword** (1): I am not in favor of this knockoff Shakira 2014 FIFA song/Kat Deluna reject. NO.

**radiofan15** (0): WOW that was annoying... also what the fuck one "one to the left" in the chorus normal and the other kinda cuts as if it was a glitch?... also also, it is wrong that I didn't knew when Stefflon's verse started and ended because the processing in their voices make them sound alike?

This is one of the songs that first propelled Bebe into a state of relevance as a solo artist, and like a lot of her songs, it’s just kind of underwhelming. I actually really like her voice on EDM songs and think she excels as a feature, but she’s brought down here by Martin Garrix’s obnoxious drop, which is definitely worse than his other song in this rate with Dua. I guess Bebe should just choose better EDM songs to attach herself to - perhaps popheads stans Take Me Home more? 

---

#Bad bitches

**Me-Luigi** (11): Bebe's vocal performance on this is amazing and she deserved everything she got out of this and carrying all the promo (like being credited as a lead artist of the song on this list)

**Brandon6099** (10): bebe vocals slay, classic bop

**gannade** (10): i really like the idea of this song but bebes vocals are so shrill... i enjoy it nonetheless

**kappyko** (10): Bebe Rexha, EDM goddess. The squealing is the sound of this song's haters having their necks stomped on by Goddexha

**MashLuke** (10): this is perfect, Bebe's voice should be featured more in EDM. I remember when this was just an ID and when it was released. I've loved this from the first listen.

**PuggleMaster** (10): The song that made me stan Bebe whew she really did that vocally!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this goes hard but every time i play this song i swear i hear my mom yelling my name in the production in the production

**tapdancingpig** (10): This works so well it makes me angry. I’ve come around to the drop, Bebe sells the whole thing, and THE BRIDGE WORKS!

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): great song, though the voice reminds of PINK! almost.

**Chevsapher** (9.2): Bebe's pronunciation is always a bit odd, but the mix and the song structure here give her enough space to show off just how good a singer she really is. The production is also excellent.

**1998tweety** (9.1): Bebe queenie, her vocals are well suited for this song.

**radiofan15** (8.5): The drop was really granting at first but then it grew on me... also Bebe Reptar really fits with the track

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): this is quite good.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): I expected this to be worse. I'll take this over Meant to Be any day of the week.

**frogaranaman** (8): When I got into my Lyft last night to go to a concert, they were playing “Meant To Be – Live At iHeartRadio Jingle Ball” and when I asked them why they were playing this song specifically they offered no answer.

**LandonKidatrea** (8): Every time I hear this song I can't help imagining Bebe Rexha on a mountain, screaming at the top of her lungs. And the lyrics certainly suit the intensity of Bebe's delivery (Personal favorites include "I wanna testify, scream in the holy light", and "I will hold you in the depths of your despair") . Especially that bridge. This song as a whole shows Bebe Rexha at her best.

**notdallin** (8): “oh this is actually a pretty good song. What year is this from? Like 2013?” *checks year* *sees it’s from a year and a half ago* 😬

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Does love have a name

**yatcho** (8): Bebe comes off like a really strong vocalist here, very earnest and passionate. And I'm still a sucker for the dolphin noise drops

**jamesfog** (7): Bebe snapped

#Stop!

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): Bebe's voice is doing all the heavy lifting here because the music and drop is pretty damn basic

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I had no clue this was Bebe Rexha who sang it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): I’m convinced Martin Garrix didn’t do any vocal editing in the drop and it’s just Bebe herself ad-libbing the seal-like sounds

**Adorable\_Raccoon** (7): i am conflicted with this song, i do not like bebe but i love the drop...

**ramskick** (7): In the name of love Bebe needs a bigger personality.

**twat\_brained** (7): The second Bebe song I'm listening to for this rate, Martin doesn't drown out Bebe's grating high notes in the way Cash Cash does, but the only real earsores are in the bridge when Bebe yells out a really pitchy F5, twice. Speaking of pitchy, Martin pulls of the same bullshit Zedd does in "Starving" and "The Middle" with pitching Bebe's vocals multiple octaves on the drop, complete with vocal splicing. Less of this, please.

**timothy444** (6.5): Meh, average song, average score.

**awryj** (6): bebe sounds like dolly parton with laryngeal cancer

**CarlieScion** (6): who let bebe think she had Vocals

**DrunkHurricane** (6): really annoying drop

**marcryan** (6): I used to like this song but overplay is a bitch.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I don’t really have a snarky comment for this song, it’s just pretty okay

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): every time this came on the radio while in the car, I had to change the station. that drop hurts me

**bespectacIed** (5): Awesome drop from a bland song (but I think this could be said of many songs on this rate lmao)

**diamondblaze413** (5): OH SHIT there she is again

**evilqueenlex** (5): That bridge has my throat hurting.

**seralite** (5): this & the other martin garrix song kinda sound the same tbqh

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): the drop is grating, probably his worst song

**singularlegend** (4): grinds my gears

**SkyBlade79** (4): annoying ass drop

**vulture\_couture** (4): lord have mercy on us with all these faux-deep midtempo songs

**camerinian** (3): I really wish Martin Garrix would stick to just doing background production for pop, because he is so much better at that than making drops. God, this screechy, unpleasant, grooveless slog just kills what little Bebe Rexha had given it before

**Leixander** (3): Jarring.

**lilguavachan** (2): stop. making. bebe. rexha. a. thing.

**enecks** (1): I am not a bad bitch

**ImADudeDuh** (1): most annoying drop ever. I fucking HATE this drop.

**MrSwearword** (1): still hate this quite a bit

Hailee’s fine and all, and if she wanted to taste me I’d be perfectly okay with that, but the main hook and title of this song is just kind of gross. What’s even more gross is the production, with Grey doing the absolute most to be as annoying as possible. Generally when people describe the “obnoxious EDM drop” I don’t find myself being too bothered by what they dislike, but wow do I hate the production of this song. I also don’t really know what Zedd does here, I guess his name was tacked on for name recognition or something? It doesn’t really sound like what he normally does (and pretty much all of his songs sound one of two ways so :flushed:)

---

#I am cannibal, cannibal, cannibal

**Bendariaku89** (10): look i love hailee and i’m pretty biased. zedd can be awful with songs, but i don’t think it was bad for her this time. that drum beat in the chorus just sounds so great, and the bass is nice. the drop i’ll admit isn’t perhaps the greatest, but i don’t care. i just love this song mostly because i like hailee’s voice and her singing with some interesting if generic instrumentation. and that hook is great plus the drop isn’t horrendous.

**Johnnytoby** (10): deserves better, I know this wont make it to day 2

**kappyko** (10): poo's hatred for this i will never understand. this is harsh noise. i always love how grey's songs have guitar parts that sound ripped from the 2000s

**1998tweety** (9.5): I remember the first I heard this song I stanned it hard, it has worn off a bit but its still great. The drop gets a bit annoying but at least its kept short.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Those strings!

**radiofan15** (9.5): Damn it Hailee, this is the kind of pop bops we want from you! Everyone who stans Allie X should just give up and stan Hailee instead, at least she's talented and can actually sing.

**timothy444** (9.5): God damn, this song is amazing! Though I prefer the explicit version that Spotify removed quietly, the slow transition from acoustic to electronic is simply amazing and it fits well. All of these artists complement each other and it’s just way too catchy!

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): haileegot won [2]

**marcryan** (9.3): Zedd continues to keep me fed.

**awryj** (9): one of those songs i should hate to the core but love instead

**evilqueenlex** (9): I really like the metaphor used in this song. "I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you" is such a weird but romantic thing to say. It just makes sense.

**Me-Luigi** (9): this is a serve

**notdallin** (8.5): it makes me a lil uncomfy to hear Hailee repeat over and over that apparently I “do things to [her] baaaawwwdyyy” but then the drop happens and I just flit away just in time for her to like *not* taste me. She catches up to me for the second verse. Rinse and repeat

**jamesfog** (8): Overhated

**MashLuke** (8): this is really nice and one of the things Hailee has done.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Do you think Hailee Steinfeld is into vore

**ramskick** (8): this song makes me realize I'm starved of eye candy sometimes.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): no offense she should’ve said flu instead of zoo

**diamondblaze413** (7.5): why don't we listen to grey more

**singularlegend** (7.5): hailegend saved it

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): The lyrics are hilariously bad, but the production is actually really good (thanks Grey!) and the hooks kind of stick.

**Brandon6099** (6): decent bop, summary of Hailee's discography (no shade ily haileegot)

#Whole damn zoo

**MrSwearword** (7): something's still missing from this to have it slay

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): Here for Academy Award Nominee Hailee Steinfeld and no one else

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): “I was so much younger yesterday” well yeah Hailee that is in fact how linear time progression works

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): whole damn zoo

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): I like Hailee's part and the guitar during the verses, but I really do not like the drop at all. It's jarring and whiny.

**twat\_brained** (5.3): You're right, Hailee. Yesterday you were the amongst the youngest ever Academy Award nominees for an acting category. Now you're reduced to releasing generic pop and resorting to the Transformers franchise. That's not even getting into Pitch Perfect. Your work on Into the Spiderverse was great, but I'm starving for either your next phenomenal acting performance or another skyscraping megahit like "Love Myself". It's not gonna happen if you're being dragged down by Zedd and Grey. Or Universal Pictures.

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): this is just cringy. it’s like that one drunk friend who tries to act sexy but comes across as crass, and you’re just embarrassed for her.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4): badly chosen metaphors aside, this song bores me.

**enecks** (4): Mess

**frogaranaman** (4): A surprisingly unenthusiastic song about sucking dick. I can conclude based on this evidence that the song was written by a straight woman.

**vulture\_couture** (4): no

**yatcho** (4): Boring midtempo shit... yawn. She sounds pretty cute here though

**Leixander** (3): Really really generic and boring.

**seralite** (3): underwhelming

**SkyBlade79** (3): mmm zoo butterflies

**LandonKidatrea** (2): That Bumblebee movie looks interesting at least. Looking forward to it.

**camerinian** (1): this song gives me assorted zoo dung in my stomach

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Fuck Hailee Steinfeld

**letsallpoo** (0): good memories

This is another not incredibly electronic song, opting for metallic drums throughout the song. Different from Charli’s maximalist work with PC Music producers in her recent mixtapes, 1 Night goes for more of a chill vibe, which does kind of go against the idea that most EDM goes for, thus making it a bit of an outlier in this rate. I personally think it’s fine but ultimately unremarkable, and it seems a lot of y’all shared this opinion.

#1 Night is all it takes

**Adorable\_Raccoon** (10): i wish there were more mura masa songs to rate

**frogaranaman** (10): Me towards any attractive man that sends me a message.

**MashLuke** (10): I love Mura Masa a lot, this album was crazy good and Charli made this song perfect. Still jamming to this weekly.

**Me-Luigi** (10): this is soooo good like can we have more of this charlotte

**rotating3Dtext** (10): underrated bop, don’t @ me

**tapdancingpig** (10): Ugh I love this song so much. It’s a cute bop, but it’s well written, catchy, and it makes great use of the pop song structure to tell a story.

**Leixander** (9.5): Underrated! I love their chemistry, how it blends their style together in a great way.

**Brandon6099** (9): Mura Masa makes bops ONLY, charli slays, that is all

**CarlieScion** (9): they did that

**Chevsapher** (9): How have I never heard this? The songwriting is a little rough, but Charli always delivers the hooks, and the production is deliciously bouncy.

**jamesfog** (9): Charlotte snapped.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VicnraalF_w

**TragicKingdom1** (9): mura masa makes chill bops

**awryj** (8.5): BAHK TO WE WI WÄ

**Bendariaku89** (8.5): feels familiar, perhaps because it matches charli’s style and it just sounds like i’ve heard it before (her old one).

**twat\_brained** (8.5): DOYUHWANNUHGOH As a matter of fact, I DOWANNUHGOH, I WANNUHGOH to a Pop 2 concert but apparently you've forgotten Canada is more than just Toronto. It's a good thing I saw Femmebot and 1999 performed live within a month last year because that's the closest I'll get to Charli :(

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): i just wanna go back, back to where we were, take a ride on your d-

**diamondblaze413** (8): so does charli do anything other than going back

**evilqueenlex** (8): ~it was only one night but I wanna go back to where we were in 1999~ i'll see myself out.

**vulture\_couture** (8): okay this song I had no idea about before doing this rate but I love it. I love that charli keeps lending her Big Hook game to producers who do nontraditional things to show all the different things pop could look like if it tried just a little harder. minimalist miracle

**ramskick** (7): I could listen to this song on repeat for 1 night before getting bored of it.

#I just wanna go back

**notdallin** (7.5): everytime I hear this song I have to check if I have it slowed down in some way. Doesn’t it feel like it should be way faster? It really drags

**sbb618** (7.5): Weirdly, building the whole beat out of these weird untuned sounds works better than just injecting them into the drop.

**1998tweety** (7.4): Charli's Oh Oohs on Same Old Love outsold the ones on here.

**MrSwearword** (7): the production alone might be a scoche too "current" but I'm not gonna knock it too hard. Charli herself...kind of listenable actually. The song still fails against the field at large but I'm not mad at this.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Were their lesbians in the music video I'm just okay with this song but I love lesbians

**Johnnytoby** (6): this is EDM 👀👀👀👀

**camerinian** (5.5): I remember listening to this once when it came out because I was frothing for new Charli content, and then immediately forgetting about it outside of that admittedly sticky hook. I don’t know what it is, Mura Masa just straight up doesn’t do it for me. He’s too…. Bloopy? Is that dumb? That’s dumb. Ignore me.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): this song is mediocre stream 5 in the morning

**strawberryswing1** (5): this is just missing something :/

**SinfulAnarchy** (4.5): no.

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I don’t mind repetitive songs, but this is way too repetitive.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): boring a bit tbh

**selegend** (3): I hate this type of production

**radiofan15** (2.5): Charlotte... please... stick to your own music... I BEG YOU

**GamblesWithDesire** (2): Not a fan of Charli's voice here and the minimalist production puts so much emphasis on it that the whole song suffers for me.

**SkyBlade79** (2): this is honestly so boring, most boring song on the rate

**xxrandooxx** (2): this song put me to sleep

**gannade** (1): nails on a chalkboard

**marcryan** (1): I didn’t know what do expect, but my expectations were not met.

**timothy444** (0): This song doesn’t really deserve a 0 but it should illustrate how much I dislike this song. It really should be a three or four but if I want to demonstrate my point, I feel the need to drag this score down because it’s such a terrible song that doesn’t even deserve to be in this rate. Mura Masa himself isn’t really my style and this song isn’t an exception to my taste and to add insult to injury, he decided to team up with Charli XCX. Unfortunately, just like most Charli XCX songs, the lyrics follow a basic formula but it's made pretty clear by the repetitive chorus that shows itself as unimaginative while managing to make it grating at the halfway mark. I'm no stranger to pop girls that this subreddit stans but there’s a difference between iconic, meh and gosh dang annoying and it’s clear to see which side Charli falls on. Speaking of Mura Masa, the production is sloppy and sounded like he missed a deadline from his label manager and just banged some pots and called it a day. It’s so disappointing as well since Love$ick was his best (and only good) song and he set my expectations real high only for him to crashland with this mess. Sure this... thing isn't bad-bad like half of David Guetta's discography or the one hit wonder Silento but it's just forgettable bad and it's below average.

The first of two Cashmere Cat/Ariana collaborations, this one seems to be the less popular one. Interestingly enough, for the majority of the rating period both this and Quit were literally right next to each other. That makes sense to me, because I forget what both of them sound like. A true testament to them both being boring. 9 (After Coachella) outbopped thank u, next.

---

#I adoooore, you-ou-ou-ou-ou

**rotating3Dtext** (11): the production details, her voice! ughh

**Bendariaku89** (10): at first i kinda actually really hated this, but now i get it AND I DIG IT. it’s so sultry like a dangerous woman track. that chorus is so nice and so great AGHHH SO GREAT, with the reverbering oscillating tones. took me off guard once i started vibing to it DAMN.

**enecks** (10): This is glitzy and luscious I love this please PM me incineroar yiff

**lilguavachan** (10): i just love it when cashmere cat and ariana collab

**selegend** (10): One of Ariana’s best imo, that MY MY MY MY MY part is BEAUTIFUL.

**singularlegend** (10): one of ari's best

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): This song gives me purple (where my synaesthesia bitches at?) and passionate vibes. It's sexy, romantic, and cute. Ariana at one of her best.

**twat\_brained** (9.4): FELINES LEMME HEAR Y'ALL MAKE SOME NOISE!! This is an appropriately titled song because I adore both CC's production and Ariana's vocals. In a pipe dream she'll add this to her Sweetener setlist.

**bespectacIed** (9): The superior CC/Ariana collab

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): this is cute but I feel like I've heard this same song 3 times already

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this is a really big vibe despite being the most unintelligble ari has ever been

**Chevsapher** (8.5): A sonically interesting track, but it would benefit from a better chorus and fewer distracting clangs.

**kappyko** (8.5): okay maybe some points were made i love the mix of EDM drop-pop and contemporary R&B prod.

**PuggleMaster** (8.5): I didn't know this song was a thing

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): The hook works (even though it’s from another song), and Ari sounds great, as we’d expect from her over modern R&B production.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Oh wow this is actually pretty good, I have no idea what she's saying but it bops.

**FireLordAegon** (8): Ok I still don't have sold opinion on this song, so here is an 8 cause Ari

**MashLuke** (8): neat song.

**monkeyattacks** (8): Ariana elevates this song with her vocals and Cashmere goes with a more traditional edm which is a good choice.

**marcryan** (7.4): You can’t go wrong with Ariana on a track.

#Who I really are

**gannade** (8): i will give reddit gold to anyone who can tell me a single line ari sings in this song without looking at the lyrics

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Ariana singing 'mamama' is giving me bad flash-forwards to Sweet but Psycho

**timothy444** (7.2): Just like all Cashmere Cat singles, the featured artist saves the song from a complete disaster. Ariana’s voice makes it seem like she’s embracing the lyrics but the production I can’t really pay attention too much. It just feels like a scrapped song from one of Ariana’s album though I got to say, this is one of Cashmere’s better songs.

**Brandon6099** (7): okay song, Quit is better

**ignitethephoenix** (7): okay this is a bop but I feel like the chorus is lacking a lot. Which makes it less enjoyable. I want to like this more but I can’t.

**MrSwearword** (7): Ariana does her best with this scattershot production

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): Not a fan of the breathy delivery from Ari but the song it's still good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The lesser of the two Ariana collabs but still a good song

**vhqv1997** (7): This is Dress by Taylor Swift but not good

**vulture\_couture** (7): cool. not super memorable but cashmere cat/ariana pair well

**notdallin** (6.7): [you got me screamin’ ma ma ma mama ma ma](https://imgur.com/a/lzz3bOp)

**diamondblaze413** (6): i know it's damn good but i can't do rnb

**jamesfog** (6): Quite good on the first listen

**Johnnytoby** (6): I like it but it's just so boring tbh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): i usually don’t mind trap beats in pop music, but this isn’t the tea

**piccprincess** (6): I’ve never actually heard this and I’m severely disappointed :l

**ramskick** (6): I adore most Ariana songs. Not this one.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): i can’t feel this

**frogaranaman** (5): This is one of Cashmere Cat’s three drops that he makes.

**Me-Luigi** (5): I forgot this song existed (mama ma, ooh, yeah yeah)

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): it’s been less than 30 seconds after i listened to this song, and i already forgot what it sounds like

**camerinian** (4): if it wasn't for Ariana being on here, this would be radio mix show filler. There’s just nothing here at all

**GamblesWithDesire** (3): I'm gonna assume that Ariana is saying words here? It's just sort of boring.

**radiofan15** (2.5): Not even thank u next... more like fuck off go away

ThatParanoidPenguin: My boyfriend and I broke up because of Ariana's 7 Rings.

We got in a huge fight over it because I was saying how it was good that Ariana was bringing trap music to the pop girls. The fight eventually spilled into other topics and it got really heated. In the heat of the moment I called him "cancelled sksksksks", and it was a wrap.

We dated for two years and were thinking about moving in together. At the time I thought he was the love of my life. And it ended over Ariana.

And since all of my friends were also his friends, and he was closer friends with them than I was, they took his side. So I lost all my friends too.

My best friend called me a few hours after the argument and said she didn't want to hang out with me anymore because it would cause drama.

The only people I've talked to in like a week are my parents.

The Swift-Harris anthem and the peak of Nils Sjoberg’s discography unfortunately just barely misses out on Day 2. Sad, because this is a real slapper in my opinion. Calvin Harris’ production really shines here - he truly is the star. Rihanna (and Taylor’s uncredited vocals) are fine, but the “you-oo-oo-oo-ooh” is infamously repetitive and obnoxious, making this song one of the shallowest and uninteresting lyrically on this list. Songwriting legend Taylor snapped. I don’t really care about lyrics in a context like this rate, but I can see why people would rate this low because of the repetitive nature. 

---

#Swifties

**bigenemies** (11): The imagery! Such a seductive song. Beautiful vocal performance. Perfect for the club, perfect for a midnight stroll, perfect for picking up groceries. It’s just beautiful.

**evilqueenlex** (10): Rihanna in the video to this song is such a mood, a moment, a treasure. I live my America's Next Top Model life to this song!

**InfernalSolstice** (10): taylegend swift

**marcryan** (10): Still bops, Thank you Taylor Swift for the vocals. Also Rihanna did great with whatever she helped with.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love Taylor Swift

**piccprincess** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jIrYNdKgkA

**PuggleMaster** (10): swifties really overrate Taylors writing on this..........

**radiofan15** (10): The best thing to come out from Taylor and Calvin's pairing

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this is the last real club bop ever made and that’s sad fuck adam you sly dog this is so smooth

**vulture\_couture** (10): This truly is what I came for. Soft, intimate, still danceable, the manipulated vocal works great as a hook.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Brooding yet beautiful. This song absolutely deserved to be as big of a hit as it was.

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): Where’s the Rihanna x Calvin collab album

**Johnnytoby** (9.5): A little too repetitive but it works

**lilguavachan** (9): nils sjoberg did that

**Me-Luigi** (9): Rip Tayvin :( this was everywhere and rightfully so

**monkeyattacks** (9): Memorizing song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): And for the one hundred and thirteenth time, Taylor Alison Swift writes another queer-coded song; mysteriously, nobody notices, much like how nobody noticed 'was she worth this mess?', 'don't you worry your pretty little mind', 'he will try to take away my pain, and he just might make me smile but the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead', or 'good girls, hopeful they'll be, long will they wait'. Why?

**1998tweety** (8.6): This is a solid bop but I'm tempted to say its a little overrated.

**timothy444** (8.5): An improvement over ‘We Found Love’ albeit with even more repetitive lyrics to sacrifice for a more amazing production coupled with some dope vocal effects that play around with Rihanna’s voice. Chill instrumental sections are present as well.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Honestly, so what if over half the song is just Rihanna saying a middle-aged pophead's name over and over again? We don't even know if that's Calvin or Taylor's responsibility. Speaking of which, I wonder what would happen if Taylor and Rihanna collaborated once again, with both of them singing. I'm sure it can't get much worse than Endgame. If anything it'd probably be similar to Same Old Mistakes, which I'd gladly accept.

**notdallin** (8.3): do y’all think that Calvin puts this song on loop and cries while cuddling an autographed copy of 1989???

**bbfan132** (8.1): nils sjöberg’s impact… we stan!

**Brandon6099** (8): another calvin duo classic, not as good as We Found Love

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): yo-o-oooh-ooh

**enecks** (8): This marked a point in Calvin Harris' career where he started delivering good grooves. His formula isn't complete - Rihanna is kinda wasted on the worst writing Taylor's done this side of Reputation. But it's a good groove.

**frogaranaman** (8): Afternoon yesterday me to nighttime yesterday me telling me that I cleaned the bathroom so I could puke in peace without worrying about its disgustingness.

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): Nils Sjöberg died for this repetitive but boppy anthem #lookwhatyoumadeherdo

**ManofOranges** (8.1): You know this song is cute but it feels underwhelming at spots. Also wow Taylor's songwriting skills her mind really must've ascended when she wrote the chorus for this song.

**seralite** (8): taylors vocals <3

**vhqv1997** (8): This song is 90% chorus, 10% verse, and 100% drama

**kappyko** (6): This was good and we're all going to have to deal with that.

**xxrandooxx** (6): overall decent song

#I was dyin' in a getaway car

**ignitethephoenix** (8): All I think about when I hear this song is how Taylor secretly but then not so secretly wrote it. And that it’s just trying to be We Found Love 2.0.

**jamesfog** (8): Rihanna, not Taylor, snapped here.

**ramskick** (8): honestly I think this song is what Rihanna stans come for if you know what I mean

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): this is so goddamn popular for being so basic

**DrunkHurricane** (7.5): it's okay I guess but never would have been big if the artists involved weren't already famous

**singularlegend** (7.5): basic but bop

**FireLordAegon** (7): Don't @ me but I'm gonna compare this song to closer. They both sound like the first draft of a song and not a finished product.

**selegend** (7): I used to hate this but as repetitive as it is, it has vibes

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): the lyrics are ridiculously repetitive. it’s a bop though.

**MrSwearword** (6): I might've scored this higher before but especially against this field, it really comes up short.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I do enjoy this but it is by far the weakest single Calvin Harris has smashed with, it’s pretty bland and it took a while for me to enjoy it at all.

**awryj** (5): this song reminds me of a shopping mall and it's as exciting as it sounds like

**mudkip1** (5): overplayed

**MashLuke** (4): I hate this song so much. It's catchy and that's fine but Rihanna's success kind of made it bigger than it should have been.

**mich4725** (3.5): One of the most overrated songs imo

**Bendariaku89** (3): i wonder how this song would sound if taylor actually decided to collaborate on this song and actually wrote some verses and a great bridge for it. i think i would like that better than this result, but this is a listenable song anyway. doesn’t mean i can’t hate it even if it’s “listenable”.

**bespectacIed** (3): Only saved by Rih's charisma, this song is horrible. And no, Taylor did nothing to elevate this song whatsoever

**camerinian** (2): OuOUoUOuOUoUoUoUOuoUououOUOuOuOuOuOUoUOUouOUouOuOUOUOUOuOuOUOUoUoUOUOuOUOUOUouo

**SkyBlade79** (2): you x100

**tapdancingpig** (2): The only reason I rated the song this high is that I had a lot of fun picking out Taylor’s vocals in the song.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): idk if this is an unpopular opinion, but this song is so annoying. Possibly the worst hook in EDM imo.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (1): This song is already pretty terrible, but being the follow up to We Found Love doesn't do it any favours either. Rihanna sis wyd we know you can sing better than this.

**diamondblaze413** (0): how did anyone agree that "you-ou-ooh" was fine

**Leixander** (0): Absolute worst song of all the three artists involved (rip Nils Sjoberg), uninspired and forgettable.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this song is boring as fuck. my way is even worse tho

**yatcho** (0): Annoyingly repetitive and overplayed to the point I actively hate this song

bespectacIed: Adore was fucking robbed it was the best Ariana song in this rate :///// Just bracing myself for the very undeserved Break Free win/high placement

If Say It doesn't reach Day 3 I'd be incensed

shekeepsreceipts: adore is the superior ari and cashmere cat collab by far.

i don't think break free will win because a lot of people have strong feelings about the awkward grammar in the song. my guess is rather be.
