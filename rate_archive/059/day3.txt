(Drew Taggart voice)

***Hey.***

Welcome to the third and final day of the EDM/Pop Girl Collaborations Rate Reveal! Today we'll be counting down from **#15** to **#1**, and we'll find out which slapper slaps the most according to all of you that participated. I'm incredibly excited! 

Please join me in the plug.dj room ([plug.dj/popheads](https://plug.dj/popheads)) for the live reveal, shitposts, and bops! It's always a great time in plug, but I have a feeling today will be extra fun. 

The reveal will begin at **4PM EST**, or about an hour after the time of this post being made.

This is a piano-house-pop-bop, and Dua works extremely well on it. It's just so much fun. I actually heard this on the radio yesterday, love that rate promo, wig. Stream NBLAH and support one half of this since-forgotten production duo! 

---

#It's electric!

**singularlegend** (11): BEST RECORD OF 2018 COMING FOR A GRAMMY

**Bendariaku89** (10): it’s very listenable, and a total bop. and that’s really the adjective. listenable bop, which sounds bad, but it’s actually really great and in fact it’s in my top 10 for this rate. perhaps not everyone cares for that sort of generic sound, reminds me of how one kiss was recieved, but I LOVE THIS AND ONE KISS ANYWAY. i love her voice, the instrumental, the beat, the fade out, the vibe, just UGH.

**bespectacIed** (10): I unapologetically love this gentrified mess

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): top notch vocals here

**diamondblaze413** (10): house never dies AND NEITHER DOES DUA BEING PERFECT

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): anyone else feel this song’s volume is a lil too low??

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Gentrified Anna Wintour slaps

**PuggleMaster** (10): my 2018 SOTY and i don't understand the hate that it gets

**yatcho** (10): One of my top songs of 2018.... drag me

**marcryan** (9.3): Supports Public Utilities

**awryj** (9): dua please stick to house pop this is what you're great at

**evilqueenlex** (9): Am I a Dua Lipa fan?!

**FireLordAegon** (9): I didn't like this song at first but then I heard it at H&M and now twice as basic cause I'm obsessed with it now.

**Johnnytoby** (9): Thanks

**Leixander** (9): Way better than One Kiss, Electricity is what mainstream pop music should've sounded like in 2018.

**ramskick** (9): Dua Lipa has some real electricity in her voice.

**ManofOranges** (8.5): This song would've been a 10 for me but then they had to go and pitch her voice down during the chorus and, you know what, I'm sick of it.

**radiofan15** (8.5): The ending is quite the teaser of what it could have been but that's not a detriment of how enjoyable is the song overall

**1998tweety** (8.3): Personally I prefer this song over One Kiss. Yeah its a bit more generic, but it also has more replay value.

**bloupp** (8): Song doesn't really go anywhere but for some reason I still like it

**camerinian** (8): fuck me, this is just really god damn good house music, and it puts a massive smile on my face every time I hear it, Dua Lipa is such a great presence for this sort of song, and it’s straight forward, not boundary breaking, but it’s bouncy and it just works

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): The best of the Dua Lipa EDM tracks in this rate

**ignitethephoenix** (8): So when are we going to get more Silk City songs? I really want to see what else Diplo and Mark Ronson come up with because this is definitely a good start.

**LandonKidatrea** (8): This song has REALLY grown on me. Really wish she had performed it during her concert in the Philippines :(

**MashLuke** (8): a nice house song from 2 of the finest producers with one of the world's finest singers.

**sbb618** (8): Because this is the last song on the list, I think I'm gonna outline how I generally ranked these. When I hear this type of song, I'm looking for a really basic formula: simple verse that builds up to a crazy, catchy chorus and completely explodes at the drop. If the song doesn't really fit this description, I will probably judge it lower. I didn't consciously do this, but it kinda fits with my philosophy over this. Sorry to all the songs I slighted with this.

**seralite** (8): im giving it a higher score than i otherwise would because this song is in that one casey frey video

**Chevsapher** (7.9): Another grower. I love that prechorus, but the drop is a bit of a letdown. To be honest, I prefer the Ten Ven remix to the original; it feels more consistent and has better energy progression.

**vulture\_couture** (7): this is just a neat little song. beat gives me almost disco vibes at times and Dua Lipa fits it perfectly

**xxrandooxx** (7): a decent song

#Insulators

**rotating3Dtext** (8): it’s a’ight

**notdallin** (7.8): lowkey this song is not as good without the music video

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): i feel like i've heard this same song 7 times already.

**jamesfog** (7): Was underwhelming on first listen but a slight grower bop. American flop.

**Me-Luigi** (7): would've expected better from dip, dua and mark

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): 90s throwbacks are COMING. I enjoy how this sounds but overall it isn't memorable enough for me unfortunately

**SinfulAnarchy** (7): meh. not much electricity, just a couple pitiful sparks. it’s a cute song though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This should be the theme song for Detective Pikachu

**twat\_brained** (6.6): How and why was this given a whole ass Grammy nomination over more deserving songs like One Kiss and Side Effects? In fact, I have a new question. If Dua can give her lover electricity, and she stops the world, what happens when the world endures a worldwide blackout? I wonder if Vsauce or ASAPScience or someone like them has a video on this theory. Truth be told, this song is much better than some of the bullshit people call EDM that gets put out onto the airwaves, but when a song this sonically similar to One Kiss, featuring the same vocalist, no less, it's nigh impossible to see this as anything other than a retread.

**Brandon6099** (6): One Kiss wannabe sorry not sorry ly Dua <3

**MrSwearword** (6): Dua has far better material

**selegend** (6): Great gowns, beautiful gowns

**skargardin** (6): Average at best

**timothy444** (5): This was just released three months ago I think and I already think it’s outdated. Dua Lipa should stop making boring-ass music for once and try something interesting.

**frogaranaman** (4): It’s trying too hard to be “One Kiss” and we all know it.

**tapdancingpig** (4): Ugh this song is so boring. If this makes it past day 1, the Dua Lipa stans have well and truly gone crazy.

So this is like the third time we've rated this, somehow, because it didn't exactly smash up the charts and Flume isn't really a big name on the subreddit and then you have Tove who is a C-tier pop girl, but honestly? It's what she deserves. This is a bop, and it manages to stick out a bit from the crowd in this rate thanks to Flume's unique (but not too unique @sophie) style, which is definitely positive. Glad it made it to day 3! 

---

#Talking (Body)

**SkyBlade79** (11): Easy 11. The perfect sex song, so fucking powerful just oh my god. Amazing drop (definitely the best in the rate) with the humming and the drums, perfect vocals, just holy shit... probably some of Tove’s best work. My girlfriend also loves this song. It’s led to some uhhhh fun moments 😊

**Bendariaku89** (10): i’m biased for TOVE LO, but i just love this entire song. maybe it’s the verse’s melody, or the chorus’ carefree kicking it nature without an awful EDM drop, or even how the instrumental supports tove lo’s voice quite well. hell, it sounds like a song for QOTC, which is a jam and a bop to me. so i welcome this addition to her discography quite well actually.

**bespectacIed** (10): It's Flume. No other explanation needed.

**frogaranaman** (10): Flume’s music is what body dysmorphia feels like.

**Leixander** (10): Oozes charisma and awesomeness.

**MashLuke** (10): perfection.

**Me-Luigi** (10): this is amazing, can daddy Flume come back already

**MrSwearword** (10): NOT THEM AGAIN. If I recall correctly, this is the one good song they have so lemme full marks this

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Tove Lo sounds AMAZING in this and poppy Flume is the best Flume. Also "let me fuck you right back" is peak songwriting.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): nnnggh (never be like you is also great)

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this song is so chilling and powerful i love it

**timothy444** (10): I rated this 11 back in the electronic rate and really, it was only because half of the songs in that rate were awful especially that KAYTRANDA album. Still, it’s one of my favourite Flume tracks and he picked the perfect pop star to collaborate with. The worst part of the entire song is Tove Lo but that’s only because the instrumental is just unbelievably fleshed out and jaw dropping while also supporting Tove Lo’s delivery on the lines she sings. I appreciate how she doesn’t try too hard like Bebe as well.

**twat\_brained** (10): Didn't I already give this a 10 in All-Stars? No problem, I'll just give it another 10. I like how the production here is slightly deviant from what made Flume famous, such as his remixes for Disclosure's "You & Me" and Lorde's "Tennis Court". It also helps that Tove sounds great here and it held up when I saw her perform it at Osheaga.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Can Flume and Tove Lo please make an EP together? This track is magic.

**Brandon6099** (9): flume is perfection, but Never Be Like You is better, ly Tove <3

**evilqueenlex** (9): I really like this song and it's my first time listening to it.

**Johnnytoby** (9): this rate deserves more flume songs

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This song sounds like being slapped in the face (and subsequently enjoying it)

**yatcho** (9): Tove Lo really is the modern EDM queen

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): really good

**1998tweety** (8.4): This song lowkey scared me cause I'm listening to it at 3am and it sounded like someone was randomly opening and closing doors so I kept looking around but didn't see anything.

**notdallin** (8.3): mmmm ^mmm mmmmmmmm

**diamondblaze413** (8): unexpectedly, the wonkiness is the least perfect part of this

**monkeyattacks** (8): Tove has a great voice for EDM

**ramskick** (8): I would like to say it: Tove Lo is the bomb.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): a good song but not good enough to be worth rating 3 times lmao

**enecks** (7): good

**CarlieScion** (7): let me fuck you right back :kimbryell:

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): I was meh on this song at the start, but the chill-ness of it eventually won me over.

#Silent

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): I feel like I've heard this before, like 5 times

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): No I will not

**camerinian** (7): my only regret is that Tove Lo didn’t feature on Wall Fuck instead, otherwise we would have the first ever 13/10

**vulture\_couture** (6): originally had a higher score here but I just can't retain anything about this song

**mich4725** (5.5): I'm a huge Flume fan, but this ain't good. Never Be Like You is miles better.

**radiofan15** (1): Remember when Tove Lo was a thing? I member... also this is garbage alongside Never Be Like You

We really owe it to Hayley for robbing her in the 2017 Pop Rock Rate, and while she narrowly missed out on the top 10, she did manage to make it to day 3. Some people consider this song "diet Clarity", which I can see, but that's fine because both are 10s! 

---

#One night stand

**awryj** (10): hayley's voice fits edm bangers so well omg

**bespectacIed** (10): Repetitive lyrics but the acoustic version is so fucking magical and way better than the original. Godley Williams' vocals made this a 10

**cyborglilith** (10): love hayley

**diamondblaze413** (10): why is it credited as "feat. hayley williams from paramore" on some platforms like BITCH WE KNOW WHO

**frogaranaman** (10): The greater Zedd “Stay” song.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): Hayley works so damn well on this song

**jamesfog** (10): Haylegend snapped

**lilguavachan** (10): hayley could sing about how gays shouldn't be married and i'll still probably be like, "yas queen shit on us mother!!!!!!!!!"

**MashLuke** (10): PER-FECT SONG. IN-SA-NE DROP. UGH.

**Me-Luigi** (10): a major serve and a great combination

**MrSwearword** (10): Hayley Williams nailed this song so much

**PuggleMaster** (10): Zedd's best song

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): *Hayley Williams of Paramore

**timothy444** (10): Before Happier with Marshmello and Bastille existed, there was this dream collaboration combining the most unique voice in Rock music and the mastery of Zedd’s production and it worked damn well! Hayley’s voice is suited for this EDM banger and I’m so glad this was made because it’s just so sad yet so happy, something that ‘Happier’ just failed to do.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): It's lyrically stereotypical, but Zedd nailed the production. I still catch myself humming this song quite frequently.

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): This makes asking someone to spend the night for sex seem so dramatic. I love it.

**Brandon6099** (9): classic bop, what else to say except hayley slays

**camerinian** (9): I mean, yeah, this is just Clarity 2, basically, but I endorse more Hayley Williams features. She has a grit and expressiveness to her voice that a lot of other lack, and her performance is just golden

**vhqv1997** (9): This would be a 10 but dammit I fucking hate that helium inflated voice effect thingy

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song made me realize Zedd has always liked ticking noises.

**kappyko** (8): "Clarity" but better lol

**notdallin** (8): the song’s catchy af bUT IF Y’ALL FORNICATIN’ Y’ALL BETTER BE BOUND FOR LIFE AMIRITE MY CHRISTIAN POPHEADS??????

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Hayley Williams isn't somebody I'd typically expect to be on an EDM song but this is great!

**ramskick** (8): I would like to stay the night in a place that has this song as part of a playlist.

**vulture\_couture** (8): who would have thought the girl from Paramore would be great on big electro bangers

**selegend** (6): Very adorable!!

#why

**marcryan** (7.8): Makes me think of Minecraft Hunger Games

#Bleachers deserved the win

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): this is nice. idk why, but I feel like this song is Clarity's less hot sister.

**tapdancingpig** (8): This essentially Clarity 2.0, but also Hayley Williams is here. I might have been a littler harsher on this track if it weren’t for her presence. It does, after all, include the use of Zedd’s now horrifically overexposed clock ticking effect.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): a little too repetitive, otherwise it would be better than Clarity

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I love her but that final buildup is awful and the drop is kind of dissonant

**1998tweety** (7.5): I find her screaming way of singing a bit annoying at times. The chorus is also pretty annoying. Not an awful song but def one of the weaker cuts in this rate.

**LandonKidatrea** (7): The way Hayler sings "Are you gonna stay the night?" makes her sound like she's talking to her friend that's crashing on her couch and isn't looking for a new place. Like, "Ugh. Are you gonna stay the night? Really?"

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The chorus is a direct quote from hotel desks when people walk up to them

**yatcho** (6.5): I've never really liked this one too much, it's kind of where Zedd stopped doing anything unique and went on autopilot

**CarlieScion** (6): do my rate! oh wait 💀

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): I love Zedd... this doesn't do it for me. I think my issue is with the '' nights '' before the drop? They bring an 8 to a 6. The robot voice also doesn't help.

**twat\_brained** (5.4): This is just boneless Clarity. The hook had 4 unique lyrics, whereas the 6 lyrics in this song's hook are almost exclusively the same lyric repeated over and over, making Hayley seem more desperate. Speaking of which I need to finish the 2017 pop rock rate. Hopefully Hard Times is a winner by the time this song is revealed! Whereas this would be lucky to make day 2.

**Leixander** (5): Worst song involving Hayley's vocals.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): A mediocre Clarity clone... this isn't it

**singularlegend** (5): forgettable

**radiofan15** (4.9): Hailey... please... stick to Paramore... please...

**enecks** (4): no

**SkyBlade79** (4): meh

**gannade** (3.5): overproduced

**BearlyEvenAPun** (3): Hayley sounds as good as she can here, I just don't think the song itself is that great.

**Bendariaku89** (3): i think stay the night’s sin lies heavily in how hayley williams’ voice is its only sort of great factor. the rest are okay or annoying. the production’s generic and danceable but just okay in terms of the rest of the songs here (edging slightly good with a nice drop) but the hook gets grating and annoying after the first few listens and the lyrics are laughably bad, so the only redeeming factor here is Hayley, who is a really good vocalist shafted by bland lyrics supported by a flimsy but sort of okay production.

Here's the first Chainsmokers song for today. In 2018, everyone's favourite producer duo saw far less success than they did in the past, and about the same amount of acclaim (none). But there was one diamond in the rough, and that was Side Effects. A funky-disco-pop-bop featuring vocals from the third Chainsmoker, AMA queen Emily Warren, who sells the vibe very well. I'm really happy this made it to day 3, because at one point it was in the mid-twenties - tasteless! Good on that last batch of scores for getting it up here. 

---

#Ooh, you're all that I want

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (11): one of the best songs of 2018. if this was on Funk Wav Bounces Vol 1, people would praise it as one of Calvin Harris's best works. but people do not want to give the Chainsmokers a fair shake :(

**ImADudeDuh** (11): one of the side effects of this song is listening to it will make my WIG FLY OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**1998tweety** (10): Okay wow this is such a mega bop, the production is amazing, the vocals are amazing, the song keeps itself fresh and interesting throughout the whole thing. This could've been the lead single and smashed tbh.

**Bendariaku89** (10): loved it the first time, still love it now even though it fell off my personal top 10 for this rate because there are SO MANY GOOD SONGS. it’s so departed from the chainsmokers more edm drop-esque style which made me appreciate its funkiness. there is some calvin harris funky wave tunes in here, but it’s just done so well that i can dance bop to this ALL DAY. i love that drop, love that breakdown at the end of each chorus, the instrumental has a lot of intricacies in it that improve everytime i listen to it. better than roses in my honest opinion.

**bloupp** (10): My SOTY of 2018, would have gotten my 11 in a weaker rate. This song is pop perfection from start to end. If this leaves early popheads is cancelled.

**Brandon6099** (10): godslayers pop perfection, they slay once again, Emily Warren best pop girl rapper and that's the tea <3

**Chevsapher** (10): If this song wasn't so annoyingly short, it would get my 11. The melodies, the bass, the piano, the desperation... and that bridge!

**CritneySpearz** (10): Should have been their biggest hit

**frogaranaman** (10): Along with its needed effects, sertraline (the active ingredient contained in Zoloft) may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur while taking sertraline: More Common Decreased sexual desire or ability; failure to discharge semen (in men). Less Common or Rare Aggressive reaction; breast tenderness or enlargement; confusion; convulsions; diarrhea; drowsiness; dryness of the mouth; fast talking and excited feelings or actions that are out of control; fever; inability to sit still; increase in body movements; increased sweating; increased thirst; lack of energy; loss of bladder control; mood or behavior changes; muscle spasm or jerking of all extremities; nosebleeds; overactive reflexes; racing heartbeat ;red or purple spots on the skin; restlessness; shivering; skin rash, hives, or itching; sudden loss of consciousness; unusual or sudden body or facial movements or postures; unusual secretion of milk (in females).

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): A BOP that got fucking slept on by the GP last year.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song deserved so much better. It’s one of their best songs and it’s an absolute bop. The bass/guitar is so groovy. This should have been a hit and I’m mad about it.

**lilguavachan** (10): oh... a bop

**marcryan** (10): Disco Funk That Cuts like Room Temperature Butter. The bridge cured my depression.

**MashLuke** (10): This. Is. Good. One of the things they have ever done. It shoulda been bigger!

**Me-Luigi** (10): ANOTHER EMILY WARREN ORIGINAL, this is what I what from both the chainsmokers and emily

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my favorite reaction was from the godsmokers themselves when they were surprised to see the overwhelming reaction for this song in the corresponding [FRESH] thread

**piccprincess** (10): draw the line, I’m by the line YEAH

**rotating3Dtext** (10): yes!!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this is the biggest dance bop of the last 3 years

**SkyBlade79** (10): what a god damn bop. Tbh I’m super happy it doesn’t just have an instrumental bop but I LOVE IT

**strawberryswing1** (10): holy fuck I can't believe the Chainsmokers were capable of making a song this good. that bridge, UGH my wig.

**tapdancingpig** (10): I had ignored the “Sick Boy” era up to this point, but this song is undeniable. The bass is perfect, Emily Warren’s vocals are perfect, AND THE BRIDGE!

**twat\_brained** (10): A GOOD EDM hit from 2018! Also, a real upturn in form for r/popheads most beloved EDM duo. Definitely one of the standouts from the Sick Boy era and a top 3 Chainsmokers song for me. That's the best bassline I've heard since Attention. The disco-ey pianos are another major redeeming factor here. If this wasn't made by who it is, I can guarantee it'd be at least 1 whole point higher in its final position.

**vhqv1997** (10): It warms my heart that this song was so well-received by r/popheads after you guys being so needlessly mean to every single thing they did in the past

**jamesfog** (9): We love them again

**selegend** (9): What a killer chorus

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): lyrically much better than their past stuff. a smooth, groovy melody combined with Emily’s vocals makes this one of their standouts.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): a fucking bop that was ROBBED in the popheads vmas

**timothy444** (8.7): More poppy than their other ventures but it works. The instrumental doesn’t stick out though but Emily Warren’s vocals make the song what it is. It just doesn’t sound like a Chainsmoker song. The ‘rap’ bit that Emily tries to do also doesn’t really do wonders to this song, serving more as an annoyance than something that adds to the composition.

**Leixander** (8.5): They finally gave emily an official feature credit in this!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I was lowkey shook when I heard this for the first time?! This is such a great artistic progression (there's more sonic variety here than on the Chainsmokers' radio hits) and Emily Warren's spoken verse is brilliant. Is the rest of their Sick Boy project like this? Should I listen to it?

**notdallin** (8.4): And with this song we get closer and closer to that disco revival that I’ve been living for for years now… COME ON 2019

**diamondblaze413** (8): she's still got her solo chance and you can't tell me otherwise

**LandonKidatrea** (8): this song is underrated tbh

**MrSwearword** (8): this is actually pretty good. It sounds nothing like The Chainsmokers so it has that much going for it and whoever Emily Warren is, she's a pretty good vocal feature. It sounds like a weak song by another artist but in Chainsmokers-land that's outstanding progress.

**vulture\_couture** (8): why are all the chainsmokers songs on this at least somewhat good

**awryj** (7.2): surprisingly good

**FireLordAegon** (7.2): Who's idea was it to put 4 chainsmoker songs in this rate?? This is the best of the bunch, but uhh

**camerinian** (7): How the fuck does every god damn B-list producer somehow sound great doing funk tones??? Points docked for the dumb awful rap bridge and it being another “Daddy Andrew hearteyesemoji ” song, but fuck me if it isn’t groovy

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): this is perfectly fine, but the talk-singing at the end brings it down

**enecks** (7): This is weird. Like a TOP song but chainsmokers? It's got groove - but I liked it before the delivery tried to get faster.

**radiofan15** (6.9): This sounds like classic Chainsmokers and I kinda dig it... a shame that it was virtually ignored by mostly everyone

**evilqueenlex** (6.5): It's alright, it just has nothing particularly special about it that makes it stand out.

**yatcho** (6.5): Pretty overrated on release by everyone here, it's just ok

**kappyko** (6): I fucking hate how the bass guitar sounds on this it literally ruins the whole thing and it pisses me off cos emily warren is a great singer and delivers so much and the rest of its pretty good toooo

This is like the only good song with vocal chops. Kiiara is shook

---


#Whiskey neat

**1998tweety** (11): You know for how much hate Selena gets about her vocals, she does a very good job at selling this song. The lyrics are great, the verses and pre-chorus aren't the highlight but they're by no means lackluster. I love the vocal splicing in the chorus, some might find it weird but I feel like it actually suits the song very well. The drop tho, that's what really elevates this song. I like that it drops but the vocal splicing keeps going. I have so many distinct memories to this song, I love it so much.

**piccprincess** (11): Selena honestly has the best voice for this stuff (don’t attack me popheads). Album when? I need it

**selegend** (11): I used to think it was boring, but I’ve really come around to it. As a New Yorker, I love that Kygo uses the word Bowery all throughout the song. The emotion Selena conveys is impeccable - the anger and sadness resulting from a toxic relationship that she’s finally ready to step out of.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): she did what she had to do... other than showing up for the music video

**enecks** (10): YEAH

**frogaranaman** (10): I do not know where I would be in life without Kygo’s music.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): One of the few songs where playing with the vocals really works for me! Turning the chopped up vocals into the drop works really well and sets a great mood here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): It aint me anymore cause i look so different without my WIG on my head!

**Johnnytoby** (10): ugh I know the Selautotune hate will place this outside the top 20 but it's truly a serve

**ManofOranges** (10): Honestly I feel like I shouldn't like this song but it really just takes me back to when I had a crush on a straight guy and like every little thing made me think that we had a chance and then I would have bouts of existential crises where I knew he would never love me so I'd think about how there was nothing between us and there never would be and so I'd listen to songs like this and I would be like wow I can relate to this even though I really can't because there was never a relationship in the first place but I would just pretend like there was an it would make me feel better and then I'd be like okay I'm over it but then I'd repeat the cycle a month later. Anyways this song is a 10.

**marcryan** (10): |TO:Ex |FROM:Me |MESSAGE:It Ain’t Me|

**MashLuke** (10): man this gets me so emotional, Kygo makes one sad tropical house song and it's majestic. I love this, especially the vocals.

**Me-Luigi** (10): another watt excellence song on this list, selena actually kinda rocks this and this was everywhere, the vocal chop chorus was really fun for 2 songs

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Selena’s ad-libs at the end of this track is orgasmic

**mms82** (10): the best vocal splice drop

**radiofan15** (10): The Pop Whisperer strikes again with the ridiculously chorus "nono-aroundme-nono-they'reaskingme-whereigo-i'llgo" or something like that

**ramskick** (10): if anyone asks 'who here hates the hit Kygo and Selena Gomez song', I'll respond 'It Ain't Me'.

**Brandon6099** (9): Selena is best EDM pop girl and that is the tea

**Chevsapher** (9): Out of all the 2017 songs with chopped vocals, this one might be the best. The chill atmosphere complements Selena's vocals well.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I keep hearing skinny in the chorus where the chopped vocals are. Selena a skinny legend confirmed!

**jamesfog** (9): Classic

**yatcho** (9): Selena, Kygo, mid-tempo chill production... I really should hate this but out of all the chill trop pop that absolutely plagued just a year or 2 ago this one is the best.

**bigenemies** (8.8): Kygo is great at adding little bits of ear candy that just makes his songs pleasing to listen to.

**Leixander** (8.5): Buh-buh buh-bowarieh

**SinfulAnarchy** (8.5): I like this song

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): This has one of the better “pop drops” I’ve heard in a while.


**bloupp** (8): Rare example of good vocal chopping

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): This is chill pop done right, Miss Selulu was born to have her whispers chopped up into a neat little EDM chorus.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I was weirdly obsessed with this last last summer and I'm not sure why

**seralite** (7): skinny <3

#Chief called...

**notdallin** (8.3): TIL that there are actual lyrics in that stuttering chorus

**timothy444** (8.2): I don’t know how to feel about this song. On one hand, it’s laidback and catchy with the instrumentation and production being typical Kygo but on the other hand, those vocal effects kinda annoy me and I don’t think it’s Selena Gomez that’s dragging this song down.

**singularlegend** (8): back to you is this upgraded

**vhqv1997** (8): I just had an aural seizure

**xxrandooxx** (7.8): not a fan of the beat drop

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): overrated as fuck but still a good song. kygo has much bigger bops (especially Firestone)

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): i feel like i've said this too much, but I i've heard this song many times before.

**camerinian** (6.5): This is a pleasant song. I mean, it doesn’t really leave an impression on me once I’m done listening to it, but it’s all very nice. Selena’s good, Kygo’s good, everyone’s good. Just… not notable really

**awryj** (6): who needs lyrics when you have a a a a bowuh ee a a whiskonee be weh o ooh o o

**evilqueenlex** (6): I'm sick of distorted vocal chops and this song is one of the worst at doing this.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Who overdrafted their card from ordering too much Postmates this month? It ain’t me, it ain’t meeeeeeeee

**vulture\_couture** (6): what is a kygo and why should i care? i guess this is well-done but it really tanks when you listen to it more than once and just doesn't do much to hold attention

**MrSwearword** (5): too mediocre for blatant scorn

**diamondblaze413** (4): nope too many times

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): i’m done with kygo production it’s 2019 and y’all still let him make music

**twat\_brained** (3): I'm glad it ain't Selena because Selena ain't it. I know Selena's like an A-list superstar and everything, but why this? Maty Noyes may just be another faceless pop girl but Stay was great. In fact, First Time would've been an even better contender for this rate! We've rated so many Selena Gomez songs, whereas we're not rating an Ellie album until later this year. Would there really have been any harm in replacing this with First Time? Rihanna has 4 songs in the rate so why not Ellie. u/hikkaru I'm interested in knowing why you would choose Selena over Ellie.

**Bendariaku89** (2): i mean i like the lyric whiskey neat, and the disjointed lana del ray sounding chorus. but that pre-chorus annoys me, and while the production is competent, it is utterly boring to me.

**cyborglilith** (2): atrocious drop

**SkyBlade79** (1): ugh this is garbage

While Lorde and EDM might not seem like a great match, Disclosure calms your worries with more chill, lowkey, and moody production that fits her style great. This was an 11 contender for me, so I'm really glad it squeezed its way into the top 10. Watch the music video if you haven't already!

---

#Embracing

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Is it weird that Lorde, when she was only 18, sang a song about a sex filled affair where, at least in the music video, she kills the man once his girlfirend finds out? Kind of. Is it such a bop that I'm willing to look past all that? Yes.

**strawberryswing1** (11): Marry me Lorde. I'm sorry these twinks are gonna kick you out in day 2.

**Bendariaku89** (10): i love this pure heroine-esque song. the drum beats while lorde sings through somber synths. reminds me of yellow flicker beat, but funkier like a yellow funky beat (i mean it’s very summery feeling). the lyrics are akin to pure heroine, which just makes me love this so much more, it sounds like it could be on a lorde album.

**bespectacIed** (10): Great lyrics as expected of Ella. "Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland", her mind!

**camerinian** (10): So Disclosure are easily my favourite act out of anyone on this list. They have such a primal focus on their grooves and know how to build on top of a fucking sick sample or bassline like nobody else here. With that being said, Caracal was a massive disappointment as an album. With that being said though, Magnets was one of like three good songs from it, so yeah. Lorde is such a good fit for their whirring, clicking garage sound that I’m stunned it didn’t happen sooner. I’m so glad she still plays this live, what a funky track dang.

**enecks** (10): Such a luscious song

**frogaranaman** (10): This song makes me want to seductively slip into a coma but, like, in a good way.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): Sex in a song, should've been a total smash if the world was correct

**Johnnytoby** (10): those druMs

**kappyko** (10): okay maybe i shouldve put caracal in my producer curated album damn rate but

**lilguavachan** (10): an anthem of being too hot in the ass and being a homewrecker. break those relationships queen

**MashLuke** (10): Disclosure are the fucking best, they invented house really. This is gonna get boosted by Lorde fans but shout out to my fellow Disclosure stans.

**Me-Luigi** (10): this is amazing

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): I like how this song feels like a bridge between PH and Melodrama

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Fuck, I love how hypnotic this entire song sounds. Lorde's voice only contributes further to Disclosure's aesthetic and now I'm pretty sure this song's hook gonna be stuck in my head for days now haah

**rotating3Dtext** (10): a Lorde feature is so rare

**SkyBlade79** (10): will always be iconic and deserves a win (which I won’t be surprised if it gets). Sounds like pure electricity

**tapdancingpig** (10): I remember when this came out. I thought it would be a hit... Anyway, the song is still fucking awesome, and the video definitely made me boost this all the way up to a 10.

**twat\_brained** (10): Loved this when I heard it live, loved it when it first came out and I was walking through downtown Montreal to Starbucks when this came on my Spotify, loved the video where Ella mirrors the lyrics by partying in a Mulholland mansion. In hindsight, however, I hate to be that person, but the case about the gender roles being reversed with two men in a love triangle with the same woman burning her alive in a flaming pool is unsettling to think about. Still, the 1-2 punch of this and "Omen" was great back in fall 2015 and I hope it at least goes top 10 again.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.8): no return would’ve been a better title

**1998tweety** (9.6): Lorde should stick to her regular artsy stuff but if she does want to push towards a more mainstream direction then this is what her songs should sound like.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Disclosure has great attention to detail. The best parts of this track are the bass, the sweeping synths in the chorus, and Lorde's dreamy vocals.

**diamondblaze413** (9.5): let's all listen to caracal on this blessed day

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): "pretty girls don't know the things that I know" is my personal mantra. We need more seductive Lorde songs.

**radiofan15** (9.5): It was originally supposed to be a 7 out of 10 but seeing how dirty they were done in the rate in which Settle participated (i'm aware they won, but they did so with White Noise of all tracks) I increased that score by 2.5 points just to give them a better chance to win... you're welcome

**Brandon6099** (9): Lorde slays that is all, thank u, next

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): this song is like a beautiful slow burn

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This chorus snaps, I hope we get more angry Lorde in the future

**timothy444** (8.7): It feels unfair to compare Lorde to someone like Lana Del Snooze but it helps paint the picture on how an indie girl can make or break one of those Pop EDM collabs. This is an interesting case as Magnets feels more alternative dance than anything and yet, it’s hypnotising and the song in its entirety from the chill aesthetic synthesisers and Lorde’s smooth relaxing voice sets the mood for this jam. Magnets is the perfect song to jam to while driving alone at night after clubbing and I know others here would do the same. Just like other Disclosure songs, it does its job at soothing you into relaxation.

**ramskick** (8): Lorde's ability to make earworms makes me wonder if she's implanting magnets in her listeners' ears so they are drawn to her music.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): if any of you guys give this an 11 just because lorde i will actually buy TGS soundtrack for my entire family

**LandonKidatrea** (7): "Pretty girls don't know the things that I know" lmao imagine having such poor taste that you think Ella is unattractive

#Pretty girls

**jamesfog** (8): Overrated bop, watch this win.

**MrSwearword** (7): the production is really groovy because Disclosure but Lorde isn't that bad actually. Against the field, it's just not going to measure up.

**vulture\_couture** (7): not the best work of either Disclosure or Lorde but still a very solid song.

**Leixander** (6): good BYE

**ManofOranges** (6): I saw Lorde and I was thinking but this was gonna be something inchresting but it wasn't.

**notdallin** (6): why does this song sound so… empty?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5): never got the hype for this one

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Lorde and EDM just don't mix as good as they should.

**marcryan** (4): I don’t know how I feel about this song

**xxrandooxx** (3): I expected more for these two

**monkeyattacks** (2): Really doesn't do much for me.

A few years back, the Chaingods/Godsmokers debuted on the scene with their smash hit, hashtag selfie. It was vapid and annoying and everyone hated it. They had the world against them, but then they followed it up with this - a more low-key yet still boppy song that even the most adamant of Chainsmokers haters have to admit is pretty decent. I think personally I would have this top 5, but hey, top 10 is pretty good too! 

---

**Brandon6099** (11): SAY YOU'LL NEVER LET ME GO, best godsmokers song and that is the tea, fight me <3

**Johnnytoby** (11): :) takes me back

**bloupp** (10): The drop goes hard, what more could you ask for in a Chainsmokers song

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): aka the good chainspokers song from 2016

**diamondblaze413** (10): THE FUCKING "oh, oh-oh-oh" IN CHORUS YES

**enecks** (10): This is a beacon. If Closer is the ending credits of 2016, this is the opening. It's optimistic, complex, well-constructed. It's awe-inspiring EDM. #Selfie wishes.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I’m still shook by the Disney version of this song that exists out there, where no one smokes a little weed on the couch in the backroom because that’s not kosher for the kids to listen to.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I wish I put roses under my WIG cause it's currently flying off my head!

**kappyko** (10): the good chainsmokers song!!! i never noticed how weird rozes' vocals are but its excusable bc this is the nostalgic atmosphere theyve been trying to go for ever since

**MashLuke** (10): Man this was their first top 10 hit, wild. Such a good song.

**mms82** (10): Song that started it all with the Chainsmokers- amazing. Also ROZES is so underrated and still puts out bops

**piccprincess** (10): MAJOR bop whew!

**rotating3Dtext** (10): yes

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): evocative, moody brilliance.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Avengers: Infinity War but the snap plays the drop in this song instead.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): big big big bop

**TragicKingdom1** (10): a magical song. calling ROZES a "pop girl" is a stretch tho bc nobody has heard her solo material (if it exists) but i will let it slide for a song this perfect

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Literally no one I know wasn't shook by this song after knowing it was from the #SELFIE guys. The best beat drop in this rate.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): This song marks the point where I really started paying attention to the Chainsmokers. It's a great encapsulation of the dreamy stoner vibe, and I love how density of the synths in the drop!

**radiofan15** (9.5): 10 years from now this would be seen as a classic in the same way than I Will Always Love You and Soulja Boy's Crank That are seen today... I planted the seed and I can't wait to harvest it

**twat\_brained** (9.4): God, imagine hearing this in 2016 and finding out it was from the same boys who made the most obnoxiously inane musical tribute to digital self-portraiture and who genuine made a song about wanting to live the life of a Trump supporter whose talent has completely eradicated and is spreading detrimental misinformation about one's mental well-being. Not to mention the lead vocalist has expressed his own struggles with depression, aging the latter song even worse. In any case, this was the song that made people take the Chainsmokers seriously, before Closer made everyone pay attention to them. And honestly, I commend Alex and Drew for their efforts, with additional congratulations to ROZES; her vocals mixing brilliantly into the production.

**timothy444** (9.3): I like both ROSES and ‘Something Just Like This’ despite them having a similar-sounding drop. Even so, the drop is slow yet packs a punch providing us with many different sounds and effects that makes my ears orgasm. The buildup is also nice despite it being very small. In terms of the lyrics, they may not be the best and I can say that the verses are the weaker parts of the song. Still, the accompanying instruments save this from being anything lower than almost perfect.

**camerinian** (9): God this song is awkward, it's confused, it's cliched, and yet it resonates so God damn strong. That chorus just knows how to tug on the romantic heart strings, and the delivery of ROZES is probably the best match The Chainsmokers have ever had for their material. Shame about the gang vocals on the drop, which… I mean they don't totally fuck the song, but, like, why

**CritneySpearz** (9): It slaps

**jamesfog** (9): That was a classic!

**lilguavachan** (9): i'm only knocking off a point because that drop is too fucking long but i just love this damn song so much.

**Me-Luigi** (9): The only (good) song I know by ROZES, this is an absolute bop and andrew's background vocals were foreshadowing sumn

**ramskick** (9): I don't even have a good pun to go along with this song. it's really good.

**tapdancingpig** (9): The Chainsmokers’ song that everyone can agree on. I think we were all shocked when we realized the #SELFIE guys made one of the most interesting, unique, and downright pleasant songs on the radio.

**vulture\_couture** (9): remember when people were like "the chainsmokers released a new track and it's ... good? what the fuck"

**yatcho** (9): Easily the Chainsmokers best, probably because it doesnt sound like theyre trying so hard

**1998tweety** (8.6): This song is really nice and atmospheric but honestly you guys overrate it so much. The EDM breakdown lasts way too long and honestly makes the song boring. Also it promotes drug use so automatic point deduction.

**Bendariaku89** (8.5): the highly acclaimed song of theirs. personally, i like side effects better, but i can see why most dig this, i mean i do as well. those lyrics feel very teenage cool kid chilling. that’s not really a bad thing to be honest, but i feel that because i’m not a teenage cool kid, just a teenage odd kid, that the songs doesn’t really gel with me as much as it does for other people. this song just feels like nostalgia of drugs, sofas, and joints which i don’t have. maybe that’s why i don’t vibe with it as much as others do.

**frogaranaman** (8): Why is a cat being mauled during the drop of this song?

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): I love this song! I like the somber feel to it in both the lyrics and the melody. I know a lot of people have said that The Chainsmokers keep reusing the drop from this song, but it's a great drop and I have no qualms with it.

**LandonKidatrea** (8): First time I heard this song I was on Christmas vacation with my extended family. We went to Baguio, a mountaintop province in the Philippines and a very popular tourist spot. I was chilling outdoors with my cousins, and we were trying to get a barbecue grill started. It was already dark out, it was cold as balls, and foggy as Silent Hill. One of my cousins plays this song and I'm immediately enthralled. Every time I hear this song I'm taken back to that moment in my life.

**marcryan** (8): Rose Nylund would love this song

**notdallin** (8): A song with so little subject matter that the only title they could come up with was the featured singer’s name spelled wrong

**sbb618** (8): Why do people think this is the best Chainsmokers song? The verses have some great production, but the chorus really doesn't land.

**seralite** (8): love it but its no paris by the chainsmokers

**singularlegend** (8): here too...

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I know this used to be called Drew and Alex's only good song before Side Effects dropped, and I do love hearing it on the radio, but listening to it on my own is, eh, just not very engaging. The names are a funny little coincidence, though.

**MrSwearword** (6): sure it's surprisingly decent but it's still lacking in anything stellar

**SkyBlade79** (6): also overrated, the drop is annoying

**FireLordAegon** (5): idk how to feel about this. This went from boring to bop to generic trash so here is a 5

**monkeyattacks** (5): Only slightly better than that Calvin Bounce track.

**awryj** (4): there's something really annoying about the first part of the drop. the production is weird. tbh i like the dissonant second part more, idk why. the song is pretty mediocre anyway

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): why does she sing like that

**selegend** (3): I’m not cool enough for this

**evilqueenlex** (2): This song is nowhere near eleven material. Delusional to even suggest it's more than a five. It's way too boring and cliche.

In my opinion, Clean Bandit has decreased in quality quite a bit since their earlier material. However, there's one song from their new album that is really quite good, and that's Symphony, featuring the Nigerian man-hater herself. It's a feel-good bop that works well with their style, and it's deserving of a day 3 spot imo. 

---

#Fuck men

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): this was my 11 until last minute. It is pop perfection, and it honestly pains me I had to choose between these two songs.

**enecks** (10): Songs with music metaphors in them are almost always good and cute. Case in point - this bop which is the closest Clean Bandit has come to recapturing that magic from Rather Be.

**frogaranaman** (10): Adding this to my “workout/cry” playlist.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I don’t know why I like it, but I like this.

**jamesfog** (10): Modern masterpiece

**LandonKidatrea** (10): First time I heard this song I was blown away. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Zara Larsson, the Lush Life girl, the Ain't My Fault girl, DID THAT. She sounds amazing here and Clean Bandit complement her performance so well. I love how Zara's vocals and the instrumentation capture the intense euphoria of being in love. But even with all the intensity of the strings and Zara belting, the song still feels light and sweet and cute.

**ManofOranges** (10): Wow great song from an iconic Nigerian woman of color.

**MashLuke** (10): Zara sounds so good and the vibe is perfect. Not surprised America did not like this, this is very European.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Zara’s best track and i will fight anyone who says otherwise

**MrSwearword** (10): Clean Bandit has so much talent, they made Zara Larsson not suck for one full song.

**radiofan15** (10): Gosh this is one of my favorite pop chorus of the decade, it's so heavenly and gorgeous, I can't believe it came from Zara from all people... also props to Clean Bandit for not ruining it with an unnecesary drop

**selegend** (10): pop PERFECTION

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): Zara soars on the chorus, and this song captures the feeling of melancholy perfectly. idk, I know some people will find this song to be cheesy, but I really like it :)

**singularlegend** (10): excellence

**tapdancingpig** (10): Zara Larsson deserves so much better than the shit material she gets. This song proves that she can handle good material amazingly well.

**twat\_brained** (10): This remains my favorite song from both artists' discographies. Zara sounds phenomenal here, the melodies and hooks are immaculately produced, and Clean Bandit know exactly when and where to raise and lower the song's intensity. We gave this a top 5 ranking the first time around; I'm confident we can repeat this feat!

**notdallin** (9.9): So I was sitting in a tiny hotel room in Auckland early last year just after coming from a month in Tonga. I was laying on the bed (which was roughly the size of the entire room), nursing my sprained ankle that I had gotten from getting off of a ferry earlier that day, just feeling sorry for myself. Me and my SO just laid there, starved of civilization and familial contact from back in the States and all we could do was watch TV on the wall across from us. I had a lot of music to catch up on and this song came on the NZ version of MTV and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. What a cathartic experience in an awful situation.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): This should have been a much bigger hit than it was. The production is so interesting, and the chorus is catchy in the best way.

**diamondblaze413** (9.5): "i was solo singing on my own" i mean that's usually part of the agreement of being solo yes

**camerinian** (9): This is the song that Clean Bandit had been building up to their entire career. A literal orchestral backing behind one of their biggest hooks ever, and having one of the biggest rising stars of pop to deliver it. Tbh I just wish the first chorus had that same massive payoff too. Song is a bit slow to properly build. That is literally my only critique for a song that will otherwise rightly be seen as their magnum opus

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): This song is a gorgeous, simple bop.

**kappyko** (9): okay!!!! lets get it girl!!!

**Me-Luigi** (9): gotta stay consistent with the pop girl prophecy rate I guess, I Miss You deserved to be on the ballot

**timothy444** (9): A friendly dance-pop song that really feels like a symphony is behind the whole song. I love how there’s also a violin present unlike most of their songs nowadays and they did a great job with the addition of Zara Larsson’s voice which is tolerable and not over-the-top like many of her other singles.

**yatcho** (9): Clean Bandit definitely had a formula and this serve is that formula executed divinely

**1998tweety** (8.8): This song is cute, the video is even cuter. Zara is ok and kind of forgettable but she does a good job selling this song, she delivers good vocals which I guess is all that matters.

**awryj** (8.2): [swearword] a lazy rehash of kelis' acapella [/swearword]

**Bendariaku89** (8): it’s odd. this song felt disjointed for the first time i heard it, but now that i’ve digested it, i really like this bright and bubbly song. it’s lovely ear candy with the pianos, but it’s not really the best.

**Brandon6099** (8): I just want to be part of your symphonyyyy

**ramskick** (8): I'd like to be part of Zara Larsson's symphony too.

**unovachamp** (8): High praise for sad gay love story music video.

**Johnnytoby** (7): that second verse!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is the best song they’ve done since Rather Be honestly

#Do the mens rate

**rotating3Dtext** (8): wholesome. the high notes kind of hurt my ears tho.

**cyborglilith** (7.5): very mediocre

**monkeyattacks** (7): not as good as rockabye but still good enough to listen to.

**Leixander** (7): Zara screams too much in this.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I've deduced that most of this song is actually good Zara's voice is just not for me

**evilqueenlex** (4.5): If this is what someone's symphony sounds like, I would assume they are boring and lack a distinctive personality.

**SkyBlade79** (4): not great

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): idk why i cant like this

**lilguavachan** (1): for some reason, zara's voice is like nails on a chalkboard to me. also the song is very forgettable.

**vulture\_couture** (0): Alright so if this 0 gets disregarded I'm at peace, I'm not rating anything else under 4. But I hate this a lot. It's not even that the song itself is horrible (though it is), it's that it represents the utter misery of being a pop fan in 2017 so well. Fuck off with this faux deep midtempo shit.

RIP my 11. When planning this rate, I thought this was a LOCK for top 5, and had a strong chance at winning, but it never got close. I'm surprised - popheads loves Ariana, and popheads LOVES pop Ariana (@7 rings). This is exactly that - pure EDM-pop bliss that makes me feel like I could do anything. Those ad libs at the end SEND ME. There's issues with grammar and enunciation, sure, and that lowered its score a bit as you can see in the comments, but it's still the biggest slapper in this rate imo. 

---

#I'm stronger than I've been before

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): popheads_ariana_praise.txt

**enecks** (10): YEAH

**evilqueenlex** (10): Do I really need to say anything? This song is obviously a bop with its only flaw being the "who I really are" lyric. Disliking this song gets you two free tickets to hell.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I wish Zedd and Ariana worked more together; make it happen again please.

**jamesfog** (10): One of ha bests

**Johnnytoby** (10): I feel bad not giving this slut bop an 11 but I have hope itll make top 15

**ManofOranges** (10): This song still sounds amazing.

**MrSwearword** (10): ARIANA'S BEST SONG, SHOULD'VE BEEN #1 ON THE HOT 100

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Ari said "f*****s lemme hear y'all make some noise" with this one

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This is the closest thing we've got to a classic diva song in the past few years along with Into You and it is GLORIOUS ladies gentlemen and nonbinary pals Ariana's vocals served whew

**PuggleMaster** (10): Robbed in the anniversary rate

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): legitimately one of the best songs ever. period

**seralite** (10): one of my faves from ari

**vhqv1997** (10): Was it her terrible enunciation or her terrible grammar because I still hear it as "who I really are"

**vulture\_couture** (10): this song is just pure fun. utter incomprehensible nonsense lyrically but I still feel every word

**Chevsapher** (9.5): If Max hadn't botched the lyrics, this would get a 10 from me. The whole track is so ridiculously punchy, and holy shit, that ending!

**radiofan15** (9.5): I wonder how many comments would be about "Fart on your body I came alive" or the actually accurate "Now that I become who I really are", I mean jeez girl... you're giving me #FaggotsLetMeHearYouMakeSomeNoise with that enunciation.

**marcryan** (9.1): Instrumental Goals

**Brandon6099** (9): edm pop classic, collab again plz

**kappyko** (9): i dont want this to win cos its literally already been rated ! but its still great okay

**ramskick** (9): I hope that Ariana Grande never has to break free from a bad relationship again.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): like a dele FIVA YE BABE

**singularlegend** (9): pop classic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I love a communist anthem

**xxrandooxx** (9): one time i drank at 4:00 in the morning on a monday and listened to this song as chaser

**yatcho** (9): That instrumental is so fucking fun, theres so many moments of zaniness to just flail around to especially that outro. Don't really know if it should be in this rate though, definitely more of a hired job than a collab, but whetever its a bop.

**1998tweety** (8.8): A mega bop, from just the beginning the production goes crazy and is immediately captivating. The song is pretty good throughout the entire thing and doesn't get stale. The grammar sin is a point deduction though.

**sbb618** (8.8): Zedd, like Calvin Harris and sorta Martin Garrix, has a lot of songs that are super recognizable but not specifically to him. Multiple times, while doing this rate, I would click on a song and say to myself "Huh. That was Zedd?"

**notdallin** (8.6): the ending blast kind of ruins it and it’s a little dated but Ariana’s star power is undeniable here. releasing this song during the *My Everything* era showed just how much of a chameleon Ariana is.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): "I only wanna die alive" I only want Max Martin to write grammatically correct pop. Can you believe he came for "Green Light" when this is on his resumé? The F5 Ariana delivers at the end of the bridge almost brings this song back into 10 territory for me. But then I hear the breakdown at the end, and I'm taken out of the song. Still, we managed to get this to #2 in the Anniversary Rate, so I don't expect any lower than #4.

**camerinian** (8.5): I didn't like this when it first came out, but tbh it is a massive bop. Ariana's got the enunciation problems she had when starting out, and i really don't know what that outro is, but Zedd and Ariana is such a good pairing I'm surprised they haven't done it again since

**diamondblaze413** (8.5): just letting everybody know that this literally crossed over to ddr because it's so dancable

**monkeyattacks** (8.5): Arianas best EDM song

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a good song but if this wins just because ari hype is at an all time high on this sub............

**timothy444** (8.3): When this came out, I wrote on another forum that this was going to be a forgettable song. A few years later and I’m sorta right on that I reckon. Sure, Ariana slays in this song and while the gays will be shouting ‘yass queen’ every time they hear the intro, it’s just gonna be just a fad throwback song that everyone forgets about thirty minutes after. It sucks to hear the truth but no-one is going to remember Ariana or Zedd for ‘Break Free’. It’s a good standalone song but it’s nobody’s favourite.

**awryj** (8.2): grammar is cancelled

**tapdancingpig** (8): This song is pure joy. Ari’s vocal performance is a little lacking (her diction is infamously bad here, and she’s doing weird shit to make her voice sound different from her natural sound), but when it works, it works.

**CarlieScion** (7): space tits

#WHO I REALLY ARE (AM? ARM?)

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): It's a basic bop. Nothing wrong with it, but it's not exactly a stand out in any way, that's just how it really are

**SkyBlade79** (7): putting this song in the rate was some BS, its obviously going to win

**frogaranaman** (6): Shit’s just mediocre.

**LandonKidatrea** (6): THIS IS! THE POT WHALE!

**Me-Luigi** (6): this isn't that great

**Bendariaku89** (3.5): i want to like this song, because of ariana, but i just feel disconnected from the song’s edm vibe. it just doesn’t work for me. if you put me in a dance floor, i would dance regardless, but that’s not really enough compared to the other more amazing songs in this rate.

**bespectacIed** (3): This is Ari's worst pop song. Can't get past the intentional ugly lyrics. It's so bad that if I didn't stan ari, i would have given it an even lower and deserving score

**SinfulAnarchy** (3): I can’t stand the part where she says “now that I’ve become who I really are.” Like, is it THAT hard to use proper grammar?

**gannade** (0): so noisy and overproduced and one of ari's worst vocal performances

**MashLuke** (0): okay this song has to be one of the most overrated tracks ever. Zedd's production is odd, the intro is big and sounds watered down somehow, the lyrics are senseless and the vocal performance is weird as well, very loud and not addicting to me. The catchiness is there but not really strong and the pink vibe it has it's the annoying kind of pink like Jojo Siwa in a Barbie car pink. It's just there. You hear it and you are like, "this is tolerable".

All three artists involved in this masterpiece have yet to impress me even half as much as they do here. Major Lazer bores me, DJ Snake annoys me, and MO is just kind of there in their own solo works, but as a whole? They come together to make one of the best hit songs of the past few years. While they might not have anything quite as good in their discographies since this, this song's quality might just make up for that. 

---

#Blow a kiss

**CarlieScion** (10): a bop and a half

**Chevsapher** (10): A very solid track. It seemed a bit avant-garde when it was released, so I was really surprised that it became as popular and massively influential as it did.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): honestly my biggest praise for lean on in context with this rate is that it's one of the few songs under three minutes

**enecks** (10): Actually a masterpiece

**frogaranaman** (10): People pop their pussy to this!

**gannade** (10): the classic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Absolutely love this song! Once of the best dance records as of recently! The production is so lush and MØ really sells it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Lean On something to hide my head cause im bald cause my WIG is gone!

**Leixander** (10): One of the most deserved hits of this decade.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song takes me there everytime I listen to it like wow. MØ's voice is just so good in this and DJ Snake's solo part or whatever you wanna call it is absolutely transcendent. Ugh wow. Their minds.

**MashLuke** (10): this song is the shit. Like the actual shit. I pumped this song for years now, it's fucking insane. That fucking drop is the best thing ever, I love this song so much omg. I just can't with how good it is.

**Me-Luigi** (10): a modern classic, Karen really did that

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Diplo and MØ’s peak

**radiofan15** (10): This song brings me Vine memories... GOOD Vine memories

**ramskick** (10): after I heard this song for the first time I needed to lean on someone because I passed out after hearing such greatness.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): blokus, fire a gun

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): iconic.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): iconic classic, i have like 150 scrobbles of this

**twat\_brained** (10): This is vocal pitching done right. Mostly because it's the exact same key MØ sings on the chorus. That is, until the breakdown after the second chorus. Even then, it doesn't feel that detracting from the song like most vocal pitches would. All in all, MØ sounds as great as she ever has on this song, and this is some of the finest work ever produced by both Diplo and DJ Snake. I don't see it winning the rate but it belongs no lower than #6.

**vulture\_couture** (10): MØ absolutely slays this

**timothy444** (9.9): This would’ve been a perfect 10/10 if a god-awful radio friendly version didn’t exist in the first place. For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, they basically changed it from ‘blow a kiss, fire a gun’ into ‘blow a kiss, into the sun’. Geez, are people that insensitive?

**yatcho** (9.6): Spawned an annoying trend that lasted for years but I cant really old that against it, it just bops too hard

**Brandon6099** (9): classic bop, FOCUS fire a gun ;)

**camerinian** (9): I think I might be one of the few people on this sub who could actually qualify as a Major Lazer stan. Seen them live three times, each time amazing, their first three albums are chock full of ragers. While this song may have signalled the beginning of the end for their seriously wild material as they kept chasing hit 2 (Know No Better and Cold Water sucked ass fight me), I can’t deny how brilliant this collab and everyone on it was, melding the distinct elements of everyone present into just a wonderful pop song. Second to maybe only Royals, this has to be the most influential pop song of the decade, and that legacy speaks for itself

**CritneySpearz** (9): MØ

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): Love this song! It's sultry and the drop mimics the vocals really well.

**jamesfog** (9): Modern classic

**rotating3Dtext** (9): you know it

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song will probably be remembered as a classic, and it’s not hard to see why. This is one of the most iconic drops of our time, for all senses of that word. MØ’s vocal isn’t my favorite, but it does help sell the song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I’ve seen MØ perform this song 3 times now and it gets better every time

**cyborglilith** (8.5): annoying bop

**awryj** (8): the bridge-vocal chop-solo thing kinda makes this song

**diamondblaze413** (8): is it a drop or a synth solo? who the fuck knows but it's good

**lilguavachan** (8): i pray that this is the last time i hear this damn song but it's a cute song the first 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times you hear it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is good but I don't really get the hype oop

**SkyBlade79** (8): MØ deserved a better breakout hit, but it’s still great

**notdallin** (7.9): Pitchfork called DJ Snake’s contribution to all his songs “weird ass dolphin noises” and now I can’t unhear it

**FireLordAegon** (7.5): This song was a hit when I was shutting myself away from society. It was nice figuring out how and why diplo became a mainstream artist. I still don't get why it was this song that blew up, but I'm not complaining.

**MrSwearword** (7): good for all 3 involved being attached to this but there's just better songs to listen to

**unovachamp** (7): The leaked demo of Lean On is a lot slower and really interesting.

#Fire a gun

**1998tweety** (6): This is super controversial but I've never been a fan of this song and don't think its really great either. Maybe its just cause I'm not the biggest fan of MO's voice, but seeing everyone talk about how amazing this song is leaves me a bit confused. I mean it was the most streamed song at a time which baffles me. Don't get me wrong it's not a 0, but I hesitate to see it as anything above a 7.

**Bendariaku89** (6): at first i would’ve liked this song, but i think it falls into the pitfall of kind of awful lyrics. it doesn’t really make sense really. but other than that, the instrumental sounds interesting, but if you’ve heard other songs, some things start become very familiar. the breakdown after the second chorus is great tho. that doesn’t make this a great song though.

**bespectacIed** (5): Yikes to the video but this kinda slaps

**xxrandooxx** (5): beat drop is god awful

**Johnnytoby** (2): idk how it got as popular as it did

**marcryan** (0): Too much

**selegend** (0): This song annoys me to no end

Florence might be an odd choice for an EDM vocalist, but she puts your worries to rest REAL quick. Her voice is absolutely AMAZING in her solo work, and it's the exact same here. That buildup to the drop might just be my favourite in the entirety of the rate, and that's saying something! I'm really glad this made it to the top 5 (though I wish it was the highest Calvin song). 

---

#Sweet

**bloupp** (10): Iconic

**camerinian** (10): God knows why Rihanna is the default collaborator for Calvin Harris when Florence’s intensity is such a perfect match for his massive sound. This is one of his craziest drops too, so a perfect pairing all around

**Chevsapher** (10): The melodies are especially good, but honestly, what's not to like about this song?

**diamondblaze413** (10): holy shit the soul in this

**enecks** (10): This is the best pre-Funk Wav Bounces Calvin Harris song easily. Florence just did THAT.

**evilqueenlex** (10): This is my song. I'll never get tired of it and it will never not make me happy. This song just makes me want to twirl all over the place.

**frogaranaman** (10): Florence, if you’re reading this, I am sorry. I am ready for forgiveness. I will do anything to have you back in my life. Please, listen to me, believe what I say, I truly mean it.

**gannade** (10): flo's vocals work really well on this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): sweet, nothing on my head cause my WIG is gone!

**kappyko** (10): OKAY THE GUITARS? THE VOCALS?????

**lilguavachan** (10): i just think florence is neat

**MashLuke** (10): this song is great, the lyrics are really good and the vocals are good as well.

**MrSwearword** (10): Florence delivered so hard on this. Slay.

**mudkip1** (10): omg this bop

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Florence and the instrumental sound like they're competing to see who can be louder and I love it

**selegend** (10): Solid pop song with gorgeous vocals from Florence. Kinda hope it wins tbh

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this is a damn song

**seralite** (10): UGH ICONIC

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Is there a pre-Funk Wav Calvin Harris single that isn’t a 10? The answer is no. The fact that Florence murders this track is just incredible but what’s even more impressive is the Calvin Harris remix of Spectrum is somehow even better than this.

**twat\_brained** (10): I ought to give 18 Months a listen, some of the singles on it are ace! This is far from an exception. Holds up really well 6 years after the fact. I'd love to hear Florence do more music like this, she and Calvin blended really well on this single.

**vhqv1997** (10): Anything by Florence is a 10 from me

**vulture\_couture** (10): Florence should be on more EDM bangers, she has the exact kind of soaring dramatic voice that compliments the loud driving beat well. Peak "dancing in the club while going through a rough breakup" song.

**bbfan132** (9.6): florence slays even when she is featured in a supposedly generic edm song <3

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): THAT DROP. sounds like that rackety gun that were old and made annoying sounds but better sounding and just sucking me in. the lyrics just bounce off my head, but her voice is great, and the song is just worth it for that drop, plus those verse were just very captivating. that hook tho needs some work, but lovely song regardless.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Florence absolutely kills this song. This is such a good collab, it needs to happen again.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): listen to her goooo

**1998tweety** (9.3): Florence's voice isn't the kind you would associate with EDM production but somehow it works.

**radiofan15** (9.1): Florence's vocals are heavenly here and Calvin snatched with that drop... ugh we stan a worldwide hit

**awryj** (9): when this song dropped I was really into Flo and HATED it bc she sold out!!! now i have seen the light and bop to it as godence intended

**Brandon6099** (9): classic bop

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): this is cute, but kinda bland? I dunno, I feel like I've heard this same song 4 times already.

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): great song but Florence needs to enunciate her words better. when this song came out, my friend thought that she was saying “sexy elephant” in the chorus.

**timothy444** (8.9): It’s a Calvin Harris song alright but the production and instrumentation does try do carefully match Florence + The Machine’s style of music. The drop actually isn’t bad and it does fit the song and atmosphere. Florence’s voice also is amazing as always.

**Johnnytoby** (8.5): Truly a grower

**Leixander** (8): Chorus always felt bad, repetitive and forced to me but i like the verses.

**Me-Luigi** (8): this chorus is excellent and the drop knocks

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): One day I will actually stop being lazy and listen to Florence's discography but for now instead of giving new music a chance I will just play the same five artists over and over again until Spotify hangs and I have no more time left to discover interesting songs

**singularlegend** (8): classic

#Nothing

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): I really like Flo on this, but the production is just a little too... annoying. The Spectrum remix was so much better.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): spectrum remix >>

**LandonKidatrea** (6): I just wanna point out that the last drop cuts off Florence as she's about to belt, and that shit ought to be a punishable offence on the part of Calvin Harris.

**notdallin** (5.6): oh Florence, sweaty, why did you have to stoop to this level?

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): God, I wished I liked this more because Florence is killing it but I fucking hate the music

**ramskick** (5): tbf Florence has such a loud voice that her default sound has to be at a solid 6/10 so anything that is average in terms of noise has to sound like a sweet nothing.

**xxrandooxx** (5): as an EDM-head, I was surprised to find myself loving the singing rather than the instrumentals. We stan a witch.

**SkyBlade79** (4): Florence is really good on this but the drop is so boring and repetitive that it wrecks the song

**bespectacIed** (1): I'm foreseeing this to be a winner/contender so I had to come up with sumn really quick. I'm a huge Florence fan but this is soooo bland. What a waste of Florence's talents ugh

This will probably upset some of you, but tbh I'm happy this missed out on the top 3. My opinion of it might not be incredibily positive, but there's absolutely no denying its impact. It's one of the biggest songs to ever exist, solidifying Rihanna as probably the biggest pop star out there, making Calvin Harris a household name, and bringing EDM production into the mainstream and onto the charts. Absolutely iconic. 

---

#Navy

**Bajuko** (11): Rihanna's best song

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Hard to imagine anyone else would be able to pull off this song as well as Rihanna did. One of her best vocals and Calvin did great with the production too

**bespectacIed** (11): Imagine willingly giving any other song in this rate an 11. Like, I couldn't fathom it. This is it.

**bloupp** (11): The moment I saw this song in the rate I knew it was getting my 11. In addition to being a spectacular song, this piece has a very special place in my heart as it was the first song I heard that started to get me into pop music.

**FireLordAegon** (11): One day. I'll find love. This song is good enough for now.

**imasalesman** (11): this was my 11 last time I rated it and it will be until the day I die

**jamesfog** (11): Invented the trend of cute little EDM hits. Rihanna ha everlasing impact

**PuggleMaster** (11): I doubt this is gonna win especially since this is the 3rd rate it's in. Hopefully i'm wrong and queen did that with a win, but robbed for a 3rd time!

**unovachamp** (11): This is it, ladies and gents, pop perfection

**1998tweety** (10): Now this is a song deserving of a ten. Despite not being Rih's best vocal performance, the production and energy of the track makes up for it all. The way the track shifts from the more subdued verses to a high energy chorus accurately echoes the lyrical themes and enhances the overall feeling the song gives.

**Brandon6099** (10): classic EDM song of all-time, best Calvin Harris song, bops hard as hell

**Chevsapher** (10): Although I don't think this track is as big of a deal as some popheads think, I still really like it. It's an earworm of a song with a production like a rollercoaster.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I always thought it said '' we found love in a homeless place '' so I thought it was about loving just on a first sight without thinking beforehand? I dunno why.

**enecks** (10): This is a totem of EDM that is essential to understanding 2010's pop. It helps that it's damn good - Baseball organs with lyrics about finding joy in pain.

**frogaranaman** (10): Me when I got a boyfriend from Grindr.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): This song is legendary for a goddamn reason thx

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular

**Leixander** (10): Gave birth to EDM era of early 2010s.

**ManofOranges** (10): That was a classic, that was a classic.

**MashLuke** (10): this song was my shit in 2011 omg, I have vivid memories of me dancing to this. That drop is still the shit man.

**Me-Luigi** (10): THIS IS A MODERN CLASSIC, Calvin really is a excellent songwriter

**mich4725** (10): This is the proper Rihanna/Calvin collab! Just fantastic.

**MrSwearword** (10): it's not gonna win the rate [again] but it's always nice to see this song on the list and award it full marks.

**radiofan15** (10): Calvin should make a joint record with Rihanna full of this and TSWYCF

**strawberryswing1** (10): Literally one of the best pop songs ever created. I can't believe it only got to #5 in its original rate. I guess it'll be robbed here as well. If any song deserves to win, it's this one.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I debated about giving this a lower score because of the fact that it is a bit overplayed and isn’t quite my favorite from the album. However, this song is just so good, so punchy, so important. The way the song opens is unlike any other pop smash I’ve ever heard, it’s like magic in those first few seconds. It’s one of the biggest and best pop tracks of the 2010s and with good reason. I know it’s gonna win but I think that’s okay. It deserves.

**twat\_brained** (10): Right, I forgot about this. Let's see, last time we rated this it came 5th overall with a score of 8.789 compiled by 84 users, myself included. That said, one of the hosts was a pathological liar so maybe he lied about this song's score, so we may as well wipe that score from Popheads archives. What isn't a lie, however, is that this song fucking slaps, even 7 years after its dominance on the Hot 100. I didn't appreciate this enough when I went to middle school dances.

**vhqv1997** (10): I swear this song is rated just as often as Rolling In The Deep. Still slaps though. This rate wouldn't even exist without it

**vulture\_couture** (10): Hard to say many things about this one except that it's pure joy. More specifically the hard work of carving out joy in a miserable life. Strained ecstasy.

**yatcho** (10): Absolutely iconic

**notdallin** (9.5): Everything works together so well for this song. The music video, the bouncy intro, Rihanna’s raspy vocals largely made up of seven poignant words, even the stupid dubstep breakdown—they all come together for an iconic bop. They hear “Yellow diamonds shining in the light” and a generation will never be the same.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.5): hot take this song wins

**diamondblaze413** (9): prechorus is premeditated murder

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Still a snatcher

**marcryan** (9): See me in walking down my cul de sac with my yellow diamonds in the light.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Fuck Closer lives. This is legitimately one of the defining songs of the 2010s for me. There's nothing more representative of how dominant EDM was for the first half of it than the opening notes of We Found Love and Rihanna's amazing singing voice throughout this track.

**piccprincess** (9): This would be a 10 if I wasn’t so annoyed with the drop being literally the same 4 beats over and over again with no harmonic change https://youtu.be/it-ru_UiMgE?t=157

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): both Calvin and Rihanna soar on this track. three and a half minutes of bliss.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): iconic yadda yadda, still not their best work

**awryj** (8): this is what i came for

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): This drop made me gay

**ramskick** (8): Rihanna stans definitely found love in her.

**sbb618** (8): I think I got super annoyed by this song when it was playing all the time on the radio. Or maybe that was "Diamonds". There are too many Rihanna songs with diamonds in the chorus.

**selegend** (8): Iconic but I’m also kinda tired of rating it lol. Most of these songs wouldn’t have happened if this song didn’t exist though. Also interesting is that Calvin wrote and produced what’s arguably one of the biggest hits of the decade entirely by himself.

**singularlegend** (8): classic

#Hopeless

**TragicKingdom1** (8): a bop, but it gets a little worse every listen

**xxrandooxx** (8): overall family friendly pop song, good for beginners

**timothy444** (6.5): Overrated song that is still good but it’s far from Calvin’s best works. The lyrics are repetitive which I don’t mind if the instrumental wasn’t so boring, generic and bland. It just sounds like it’s stuck in the year 2011 which is fitting since it’s probably a baseline for Calvin’s other songs on what not to do. It still bops but it’s just loops and one girl singing the same thing over and over. Sorry but it’s the truth in case anyone here is delusional enough to give this song an 11.

**camerinian** (6): God I'm sick of this song

**kappyko** (6): where have you been is so much better yall....

**tapdancingpig** (5.8): I know I should have more respect for this song, since it kind of kickstarted a trend that can’t get enough of, but... I don’t know. This song came on the playlist, and I didn’t realize that had come on until Closer started. I literally thought “wait, wasn’t there another Calvin song before this?” So... yeah, sorry.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (5): honestly overrated tbh

**evilqueenlex** (5): I can't stand this song. This song is annoying as hell but I cannot give it less than a five. This song had too much of an impact for me to do that. Plus, it's Rihanna.

**gannade** (3): always thought this was overproduced and noisy

**Johnnytoby** (2): I never got the hype, she's screaming and instrumental is too loud it just hurts :(

**LandonKidatrea** (2): oh wow i forgot how much i dislike this song...

**Bendariaku89** (1): i have a dislike for this song. i’m not really sure, but it’s probably from the song’s beat, that odd uncanny piano, plus that buildup sucks, and the drop just doesn’t do anything for me. the lyrics also don’t really do anything what with that hopeless repetition which sounds more grating really than catchy. it’s just nonchalance bordering on hate song for me. it’s one of the worst tbh.

Yet another absolutely ICONIC song. On days 1 and 2, Guetta flopped pretty hard and lost the vast majority of his songs, but this one stuck around for the long haul and it's easy to see why. This is THE song that made Sia a star, and also furthered along EDM's dominance in the mainstream. Definitely deserving of a top 3 position. 

---

#Precious metals

**GamblesWithDesire** (11): I fucking love this song. The vocals and drop are so perfectly mixed to hit with maximum effect.

**IeuanHa** (11): Sia's voice just elevates to a different plane of existence with some of the high notes here

**mudkip1** (11): LEGEND!!!!

**sbb618** (11): No explanation needed.

**1998tweety** (10): I loved this song so much when it came out and I still love it. I think it was my first introduction to Sia, I'm glad she blew up cause she has so many bops and lyric heavy songs. Her nonconventional voice works super well on this track too.

**Bendariaku89** (10): god the 2012 nostalgia kicks in so much. this is just a great song from the year that i can’t help giving this such as high score.

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my could-be-an-11 in this rate. Iconic is a word thrown a lot carelessly nowadays but this is truly iconic.

**bloupp** (10): Modern classic

**Brandon6099** (10): classic bop, best david guetta song, sia slays

**Chevsapher** (10): This song is really fun to belt along with in the car! Great songwriting, great drops.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): other metals are QUAKING

**frogaranaman** (10): This is one of the top two songs of this rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Iconic and a modern EDM classic.

**jamesfog** (10): Takes me back to 2012

**Johnnytoby** (10): If this doesn't win....

**Leixander** (10): A classic for a reason!!

**MashLuke** (10): this song is one of the best tracks he has ever done. Sia does her thing and the production is super fine. Flawless.

**Me-Luigi** (10): modern classic

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): lmao I almost rated this 2010

**MrSwearword** (10): Sia slayed on this

**PuggleMaster** (10): ICONIC

**ramskick** (10): this song's reputation is as strong as Titanium

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i’ve said it before and i’ll say it again: she wolf > titanium > bang my head > flames and yet they’re all 10s

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): the nostalgia

**skargardin** (10): Take me back to high school, aah

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This was EXTREMELY close to snatching my 11, the opening of this song is just so iconic. This song basically made Sia a household name and it still bangs 7 years later.

**timothy444** (10): I can’t find anything wrong with this song and the music video that came after it. Sia’s voice is extraordinary and for once, David chooses the right instrumental to suit her voice and do her justice. The build-up is also absolutely brilliant and perfectly portrays the feeling of being bulletproof and invincible (if only briefly). It’s a true Underdog story of a song!

**vulture\_couture** (10): Sia's big, dramatic vocals and Guetta's aggressive beats just work well together.

**radiofan15** (9.7): Can you believe Sia and David invented metalurgics? ugh their minds

**bigenemies** (9.5): This is the kind of song that makes you want to belt your heart out. It’s a dance ANTHEM with an empowering message. The bridge is also so beautiful and refreshing to hear. I never realized how bridge deficient EDM music is.

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): I cite this song as the one that started the trend of songs replacing lyrical choruses for instrumental choruses which makes me resent it slightly but it's not David Guetta's fault that people try to replicate it in really boring and uncreative ways.

**diamondblaze413** (9): mv made it

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Christina Grimmie :(

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Damn you know what I hope David Guetta at least finds comfort in the fact that this is the only song he'll be remembered for because its fantastic and Sia's vocals just exert POWER no longer she got famous off it whew

**tapdancingpig** (9): My first exposure to Sia, and it’s still one of her best “I meant to sell this one” songs. This has all of the raw force of her voice without the drug and questionable technique fueled cracks of the modern era.

**xxrandooxx** (9): lova ya sia

**marcryan** (8.9): An overplayed classic, but still a bop.

**twat\_brained** (8.9): I mean I get that this is like their magnum opus or something, but I don't feel like this is the absolute towering achievement for either artist. It's great, but I feel like there's something missing here. I can't identify exactly what though.

**piccprincess** (8.5): kinda hurts my throat listening to this

**singularlegend** (8.5): classic

**camerinian** (8): see this song actually works because David Guetta shows some fucking restraint for once in his life, and Sia puts in a rightfully starmaking performance. Ignore the whole school shooting subtext though haha

**monkeyattacks** (8): Makes me nostalgic for some reason

**notdallin** (7.7): tbt to when two girls sang this in the shower together NAKEE in Pitch Perfect.

#Sia doesn't deserve a career.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): it’s kiiind of iconic but the drop is disappointing

**seralite** (7): its gotten a little old tbqh but is still good

**enecks** (6): I am Octavia outsold

**kappyko** (5): perfect phcj browsing music. the chorus and bridge vocals are good but the verses mean nothing and the drop doesnt mean anything

**lilguavachan** (3): no seriously, like why was he a thing

**gannade** (2): Sias vocals are on point and the chorus is great and then David Guetta takes a giant dump on everything

**awryj** (0): a hot take? maybe so. i just hate this song. i'm also allergic to some metals including titanium so...

And so the underdog wins. Holder of the lowest controversy score in any rate ever from its inclusion in the 2016 EP rate, it was an absolute blast to root for this here. The general perception of the song seems to have become more positive over the last couple years and that makes me really happy, because Closer definitely is THE anthem of the mid-2010s. It propelled Halsey to stardom, and now she has the #1 song in the United States, and that’s just one good part of it (halsey haters BEGONE). Every lyric in the song is quotable and the bleep-bloop drop is absolutely iconic. During the rating period, the song jumped all over the place, swaying between being out on Day 1 and Day 2 with each new score. Once, it found its way into the top 20 and I was praying that it could somehow stay there so that the haters would seethe :janet: But eventually, it stabilized at around #25, about halfway through the list of scores, and I think that’s apt for such a controversial song.

#Hey.

**CarlieScion** (11): queen

**MashLuke** (11): I love this song so so so much. One of my first posts in /r/popheads was a Billboard article celebrating the Chainsmokers topping the Billboard hot 100. Seeing their rise to success was so crazy, this song has been on my most listened songs playlist of 2016/2017/2018 on Spotify. It's just perfect, I loved that summer.

**mms82** (11): My most played song of 2016, 2017, 2018, and a strong contender for 2019. Honestly pure pop perfection and my favorite song of all time

**radiofan15** (11): I wonder if the Blink-182 song they beat to death in Tucson is the same one Halsey sang in that mall

**1998tweety** (11): This song is gonna be snubbed so hard and I already know it. You guys need to not let overplay affect your overall opinion of a song. This song is such a summer song and is so nostalgic and so fun but at the same time bittersweet. The one thing I'm a bit lukewarm on is some of Halsey's weird lines but other than that its a super catchy fun song.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): Gets waayyyy too much hate. I actually like how weirdly specific the lyrics are, gives it a bit of meaning instead of having another relationship song that could apply to any random person in the world.

**bloupp** (11): This song is amazing and y'all only hate it because it was overplayed.

**Brandon6099** (11): SO BABY PULL ME CLOSER, classic song, will bop to forever even in my 80's

**Chevsapher** (11): Haters gonna hate, but this song has an atmosphere all its own. In my mind, “Closer” is one of the defining songs of this decade.

**cyborglilith** (11): does not deserve the hate

**enecks** (11): This flawed masterpiece defines the decade almost as much as We Found Love. The flaws - some framing that kinda puts Halsey in a submissive desperate position. But the details and the drop - it's so 2016. Those three words are its appeal and its failing.

**GamblesWithDesire** (11): CLOSER IS A BOP, Y'ALL ARE JUST MEAN AND BITTER ABOUT MATTRESS THEFT

**gannade** (11): halslay

**Johnnytoby** (11): it's a good song

**Leixander** (11): I like this song now but I used to hate it a lot. It is not good but really enjoyable, if that makes sense! (Also i want to see the score/controversy difference between the EP rate and this rate hah!)

**ManofOranges** (11): This song deserves to be up there in the rankings, like it or not, and that's that on that.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (11): overplayed, but still bops. excited to see the controversy score for this one, though

**piccprincess** (11): SOBABYPULLMECLOSERINTHEBACKSEATOFYOURROVERTHATIKNOWYOUCAN'TAFFORDBITETHATTATTOOONYOURSHOULDERPULLTHESHEETSRIGHTOFFTHECORNEROFTHEMATTRESSTHATYOUSTOLEFROMYOURROOMMATEBACKINBOULDERWEAIN'TEVERGETTINGOLDERDODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODOWEAIN'TEVERGETTINGOLDER

**PuggleMaster** (11): this song takes back to when i was truly happy with my life so i can't really drag it

**selegend** (11): The haters are just jealous

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): imagine all the people that had sex to this lol

**strawberryswing1** (11): I remember I discovered this song before I started to visit r/popheads regularly. The first time I heard it I loved it and I put it on repeat for over an hour. Then I started visiting this sub and everyone talked about it like it's one of the worst songs ever so I felt ashamed for liking it. Now I know popheads has terrible taste and there's nothing to be ashamed of !

**tapdancingpig** (11): This will go out early BUT FUCK YOU, THIS SONG IS GOOD.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): If there’s one song on here that has a chance to rival the sheer impact of We Found Love, it’s fucking Closer. When I first heard this track in my college dorm room the night it dropped, I thought it was a pretty solid Chainsmokers track. The lyrics were snappy and the beat was really catchy. I had no idea I was listening to one of the defining songs of the decade, a megahit so pervasive the world would never be the same. And I feel the same as I did two years ago when I did the 2016 EP rate - this song is an absolute masterpiece. /u/The_Chainsmokers I love you and thank you for making the world a better place.

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD** (11): memes lost

**timothy444** (11): I missed out on the EP rate but if I didn’t forget about that rate, I would’ve given this a 10 just to mess with people. I mean, it’s cheesy but that’s the charm of it. It’s a love duet that can be taken as genuine even though they probably had ghostwriters writing this but I don’t care. The drop is relaxing, the voices complement each other and it’s still nice to listen to this occasionally when it pops up. The only reason why I’m not giving this an perfect eleven is because there are simply better songs that I enjoy more seriously.

**twat_brained** (11): honestly fuck you guys I still wholeheartedly love this song 30 months after it came out. Halsey singlehandedly carries the entire song for me, and I'm not just saying that as a stana of hers. I felt an instant connection to it and when it went #1, I was overjoyed for her because I felt she deserves it. Two and a half years later, she hopefully has her second #1 single by the time we're revealing this rate. Even if she doesn't, I'm glad her only chart-topper is one of the most iconic songs of the decade.

**vhqv1997** (11): I'm giving it a 10 because I just know you would all try to sabotage it

**vulture_couture** (11): I was tempted to give this one a 11 just because it's great and makes a lot of people angry for some reason. Great lyrics that tell a story, the bridge/chorus is great, the drop is awful but like in a relatable way that makes the song better.

**camerinian** (11): every rational part of my brain should loathe this awkward, chinsy little song, and I can't. That chorus is magical, the drop is like almost a cool off from the chorus but it works in its own right, the verses are weirdly written and delivered, and yet it's aching sincerity helps it overcome any sort of growing pains. I can't. This sing is great in spite of everything working against it.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I know this song was overplayed for a billion years, but I totally understand why this was so successful. It’s instantly catchy and follows a formula that works so well. It is a good song imo, but if I rated this song back when it was on the radio every hour, it would have definitely given it a lower score.

**notdallin** (11): The song we were all waiting to drop all summer in 2016. And when it finally did everyone realized how much they hated the Chainsmokers. But for one beautiful month, we didn’t question what it meant to bite that tattoo on her shoulder, or what’s so significant about Tucson and Boulder, or think about the length of the Chainsmoker’s dicks whenever we heard this song. No, we could all hear that chorus of “we ain’t ever getting older” and just let it run us through.

**marcryan** (11): I really love and hate and love and hate this song. Luckily during this rate i like it.

**sbb618** (11): You can't help but belt out this song when it comes on.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): a BIG grower that perfectly captures the nostalgia of late millennials / early gen z...i consider this the most iconic song of the decade for that reason

**xxrandooxx** (11): catchy as hell

**rotating3Dtext** (11): SO BABY PULL ME CLOSER IN THE BACK SEAT OF YOUR ROVER THAT I KNOW YOU CAN’T AFFORD BITE THAT TATTOO ON YOUR SHOULDER PULL THE SHEETS RIGHT OFF THE CORNER OF THE MATTRESS THAT YOU STOLE FROM YOUR ROOMMATE BACK IN BOULDER WE AIN’T EVER GETTING OLDER

frogaranaman: **frogaranaman** (11): This will literally define a year in our generation and I’m honestly okay with it.

**jamesfog** (11): This song aged like fine wine. We all know the lyrics too

**ramskick** (11): it's amazing that I have positive memories of this song despite the fact that it played so much it drove me CLOSER to insanity.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (11): THIS SONG IS NOT THAT BAD YOU GUYS ARE JUST MEAN

**evilqueenlex** (11): I reluctantly like this song. This song would be better if a male singer like Justin Bieber or Charlie Puth was singing the first half of this song.

**diamondblaze413** (11): took me three years to come around lmfao

**IeuanHa** (11): Hated when came out, grew to quite like

**SkyBlade79** (11): Underrated tbh, people just hate it because its popular

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Ok, I am not a big fan of this, but can we talk about how this is kinda the most iconic song of the last half of the decade? Like every lyric is quotable and memorable and it just really is known by everyone.

**Me-Luigi** (11): I don't know why but I start to laugh when this song comes on anywhere - it's a meme to me, glad Camila didn't end up on this

**seralite** (11): i think going a few months without hearing this one before now has made me generous 

#The roommate that had their mattress stolen

**FireLordAegon** (11): This songs sounds like it was written by a first year music theory student. What is there is good, but I feel like the song is just too simplistic and repetitive.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): This grew on me a LOT even if the synths sound like something I could've made in Garage Band and the guy can't sing for shit

**Bendariaku89** (11): this song is in middle of the road for me. i love it’s drop, but i know it’s a reworking of roses, which for me is better, but not by a lot. this song still sounds nice, even if it doesn’t pull the punches for me.

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): I joined the hate circlejerk when this first released because I thought Halsey sucked and I despised the idea of Mariah's record being beaten, but right about last year, when its reign on the charts had ceased for good, I began to think it was great. Now, I've come to the conclusion that it's just okay.

**kappyko** (11): it's cute but way too damn sparse

**LandonKidatrea** (11): Don't let this rate's results distract you from the fact that Todd in the Shadows named this song his Best Hit Song of 2016!

**carly-rae_sremmurd** (11): the whole song feels like it's building up to an explosive chorus that never happens and it makes my head hurt

**singularlegend** (11): it's ok....

**awryj** (11): i believe this is one of the songs the us army uses to torture their prisoners of war

**CritneySpearz** (11): Idk why but the chorus is grating to my ears, Halsey’s verse saves it from being a 0.

**lilguavachan** (11): i don't hate it as much as when it first came out but that doesn't mean it's good still

**bespectacIed** (11): What a hilariously bad and song. No amount of nostalgia or image overhaul for both halsey and the chainsmokers could make me like this.

**bbfan132** (11): no

**MrSwearword** (11): NO. GROSS. This shit still sucks all this time later.

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): this is the whitest shit ever.

Wow. This song... this was the little engine that could. Until it couldn't. For nearly the entirety of the rating period, Clarity held the top spot, with Rather Be lagging behind by quite a bit. But as the last swath of scores came in, it began catching up, and eventually snatched the #1 spot. It looked like it had the win. Until... the last score came in. The VERY. LAST. SCORE. With picc giving it a 7.5 and Clarity a 10, Rather Be was pushed into the number two spot yet again, and here we are. Sorry Glynncels, maybe in All-Stars 3?

---

**Chevsapher** (11): I was blown away when I first heard this song on the radio... it's just so good! The mix of electronic and classical textures is emotive and expressive, Jess's tone and delivery fit the song perfectly, and the melodies are fun and catchy.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (11): This is one of my favorite songs of all time. The vocals, the beats, the chorus... FUCK :clap: ME :clap: UP

**CritneySpearz** (11): One of the best songs in the past decade for sure

**kappyko** (11): NONONONOONON. i may have held a personal contest to see if i get sick of sweet nothing or this song first and this song won out. both are still what should be the top 2 though....

**Leixander** (11): This is the musical version of that one comfy emoji.

**ManofOranges** (11): This song really is perfection, plain and simple. I remember the first time I heard it and immediately I was in awe of just how good it sounds. I listened to this song on repeat for days. It's just that good. In particular, the violin really just elevates the whole song, ugh it's fantastic. Also I had a crush on the violin guy when I saw the video.

**marcryan** (11): Serotonin was released

**ramskick** (11): there are very few places I'd rather be than a place where this song is playing.

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): I just love this song. it can be hard to write a feel-good pop song without coming across as cheesy or bland (i.e. “Can’t Stop the Feeling”) but this sounds infectious and uplifting. when i listen to this, I think of someone special, and it makes me feel fuzzy inside :)

**skargardin** (11): They will never, ever top this expertly produced song. idk what else to say other than that this is an iconic megabop, no wonder it was clean bandit’s breakthrough hit

**TragicKingdom1** (11): glynncels fucking rise up

**twat\_brained** (11): Glynncels RISE UP. Not sure how anyone can really hate this song, Jess sounds great here and the violins definitely produce a classical flavor that's hard to incorporate into modern-day music. Major kudos to CB for pulling it off though; I don't see this song anywhere lower than #2. In fact, I'm going out on a limb and giving this my 11, because I'm confident it'll win the rate. It's the most deserving if you ask me.

**xxrandooxx** (11): violins man...

**1998tweety** (10): My second choice for an 11, this song is so warm and soft and makes me feel good, Jess is the perfect fit for it.

**awryj** (10): the best song they've ever released

**Bendariaku89** (10): probably the actual best song in this rate to be honest, and no one will and should contest why. it’s one hell of a song. those lyrics border on nonsensical and lovely that you just accept the idiosyncrasies of it all, though that’s not why people like it. THAT INSTRUMENTAL is what makes people drool over how amazing this song is. it fucking kicks every song in this rate’s ass, in fact i once had that instrumental saved in my phone by itself. this would be the best song to get first place if i were to be honest, even if i adore (get it. adore) some other songs than this (COUGHletmegoandrunonlove*COUGH&).

**bespectacIed** (10): Tempted to give this a lower score because I have a sour memory of a roommate (who doesn't know I'm gay) catching me dramatically singing to this. But this is one of my 11s in this rate

**bloupp** (10): Pop perfection

**camerinian** (10): What a perfect pop song, and it’s incredible how, over four years and god knows how many weeks topping charts around the world, there is still no song that sounds like it. Jess Glynne delivers one of her most nuanced performances ever, the core riff is undeniable, and it established exactly what makes Clean Bandit stand out amongst every other EDM act out there, which in 2014 is a hell of a feat. This song is just an undeniable house bop, and it’s gonna age a hell of a lot better than 90% of this list lmao

**diamondblaze413** (10): zara i genuinely apologize but you didn't get the best violin melody in history

**enecks** (10): If I wasn't worshipping at the altar of SOPHIE this'd be my 11. This is a fucking masterpiece, and lightning in a bottle.

**evilqueenlex** (10): If you don't like this song, you get a free ticket to hell.

**FireLordAegon** (10): This song would rather be heads cause it lost a coin toss for my 11.

**frogaranaman** (10): I want to live in Japan and have a dance party when I buy fish every day. :(

**ImADudeDuh** (10): idk a really good wig pun for this, but I 100% thought Jess Glynne was the asian girl in the music video until like last year.

**jamesfog** (10): Absolute classic.

**MashLuke** (10): this song is so perfect, like so fucking perfect it would deserve a 10 and a half. Man this is a modern classic, y'all now someone like Pitbull is gonna sample it in 2030 and make an easy hit out of it.

**mms82** (10): One of the most beautiful tropbop beats of all time- most nostalgic song

**MrSwearword** (10): CLEAN BANDIT'S BEST SONG AND THE SOLE TRIUMPH OF JESS GLYNNE

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Obligatory: Glynncels rise up

**radiofan15** (10): Story time... when I first heard this song I though it was Rihanna singing it, and then I forgot about this song until Glee Season 6 reintroduced it to me... anyway, it-s a classic that what I meant to say

**rotating3Dtext** (10): flawless tbh

**selegend** (10): As a Chinese teen, that music video AMAZED me. Hearing an EDM song with classical influence was breathtaking to me

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): humans don’t deserve this song

**SkyBlade79** (10): reminds me of my parents

**unovachamp** (10): I have mad respect for Jess for pronouncing Dubai correctly in this song.

**vulture\_couture** (10): This is just perfectly constructed and Jess Glynne's smoky voice is awesome for this kind of song

**timothy444** (9.5): 9.5 When I first heard of this while browsing through the 'australian-charts forum' (before I ended up on /r/popheads), I was blown away at how unique and risky the composition was by incorporating classical instruments like violin with other modern elements like synth blips. It was so weird and yet, it just worked really well. My only problem is that in context of the rate, it just doesn't fit the EDM-theme and it's a bit too poppy though the remix by The Magician does attempt to turn into a club banger. Unfortunately, there's not much bass present, instead over-relying on their classic gimmick which fizzled out when they became sell-outs in late 2017. Still, this track bops but it would be sad to see this win when there are better deserving tracks.

**Brandon6099** (9): classic bop

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This is wholesome pop perfection.

**LandonKidatrea** (9): I find it incredible how relaxed and breezy Jess Glynne sounds, while still having avenues to show off her range and power as a vocalist. It's also incredible how many sonic elements Clean Bandit add and remove at various intervals, all without making the song sound clunky and disjointed.

**seralite** (9): its iconic.

**vhqv1997** (9): This song is super overplayed in my country. I can't listen to it without getting PTSD

**sbb618** (8.5): Definitely thought this was Rihanna until now.

**notdallin** (8.2): Overplayed in 2014 but it continues to deliver years later via funky instrumentation and perfectly broken syllables that bounce and weave especially in that pre-chorus!

**Johnnytoby** (8): Classic

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I hope you're happy TK

**lilguavachan** (7.5): i have no strong feelings about this song one way or the other.

**tapdancingpig** (7.4): This song is pretty delightful, but Jess Glynne’s vocal performance... how do I say this? Listening to this, I know exactly how she fucked up her voice.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this song smells like a Target ad

**yatcho** (7): I get why it's so highly regarded, but it just doesnt quite connect with me. It's almost... basic? Still, good song.

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): Basic, and not in the best way.

**Me-Luigi** (6): positive: it kinda bops, negative: it's kinda annoying and gave jess glynne a career

**PuggleMaster** (5): BITCH! I always thought this was Florence singing it.

One could say that the holy trinity of EDM producers from 2013 were Calvin Harris, David Guetta, and Zedd. They popularized the entire sound of EDM in the mainstream, and for them I am incredibly thankful. Like We Found Love and Titanium, this song is absolutely ICONIC, and definitely influential. This is a dramatic and powerful mid-tempo EDM song, which is a bit different from the upbeat bangers that make up a lot of the genre, but that's what makes it a bit special. In all honesty, if I were to pick between this and Rather Be for a winner, I'd prefer Rather Be just on the level of being a song that I prefer. But Clarity feels... right. It feels correct for the winner to be one of the most influential songs, one from one of the OG EDM stars. By a 0.01 higher average score, Clarity is the best EDM/Pop Girl Collaboration. 

---

**camerinian** (11): Not only is this the best song on this list, but it’s also the pinnacle of the entire mainstream EDM explosion of the era and a textbook example of doing everything right for this type of song. Foxes is such a perfect pairing for this production, able to manage both the subtler, quieter and bigger, broader emotional beats for the song. Her performance is surprisingly nuanced, but who are we kidding, this is Zedd’s song, and good god the production and song construction is perfect. The verses are sparse but beautifully placed to accompany the vocals and build the emotionality, and my god what a build. The hook is a shout-along anthem that only escalates in power, and backing the drop with those choral-esque chanting vocals only adds to the level of scope. The rest is standard stuff, the buzzy distorted synths, pulsing bass, but the best part of the song for my money is those two isolated drum hits halfway through the drop. With just two powerful pulses, the energy is suspended for a brief moment, before exploding yet again on all cylinders with the hook back in tow. It is a masterclass in pacing, and I would struggle to think of a song this big that’s done it better.

**cyborglilith** (11): BIG nostalgia

**diamondblaze413** (11): vocal harmonies in drop killed me and sent me to an undeserved heaven

**evilqueenlex** (11): This song is drama, it's theater, it's beautiful, it's everything. It's silly but this song holds a special place in my heart for being a little light for me to hold onto during a really dark and unstable time in my life. The bias jumped out.

**frogaranaman** (11): I’ll take “Songs about love that hit the spot right where it needs to hit” for $1000, Alex.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Definitely one of the best EDM songs from recent memory. The lyrics, the build up to the chorus, and Foxes vocals are all work so well together. It’s honestly fantastic.

**InfernalSolstice** (11): an all-time favorite song of mine

**notdallin** (11): I’ve always inherently felt this song had a romantic quality to it. Not an imminent break-up song as some may assume, but it’s not a romantic song either. It’s more like a “Transatlanticism”, because even though the couple is broken, they are still pieces of each other. “You are the piece of me,” Foxes sings, “I *wish* I didn’t need.”

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): Whew!!!! An anthemic FORCE of a song.

**tapdancingpig** (11): This song goes on for too long, but it’s essentially perfect. Everyone I know (who doesn’t hate everything about EDM) still loves this song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): In 2012 I didn’t obsess over many artists, but I obsessed over Zedd. I listened to his Legend of Zelda remix too many times. When this song dropped shortly before the album, I played it into the ground. But, I never once got tired of it. It just sounds so clean, so fresh full of air, so stunning. It’s literally one of the best pop songs ever. It’s one of my favorite songs ever. It just sounds so fresh, so pure, so unlike anything else Zedd has done. It’s the pinnacle of the genre, of the medium of music, of human achievement. It is all that I ever need.

**1998tweety** (10): I am proud to say that I stanned this song slightly before it got big. A mega bop.

**awryj** (10): a jazz edm power synth pop masterpiece

**Bendariaku89** (10): look, this song is very conflicting for me. it shouldn’t work at all, with the double climax, but it does. i mostly vibe with the viva la vida (shout out to fallen kingdom) chants in the background that i just focus on whenever i hear this song. though, foxes does a great job with her voice in singing these lyrics. i think i like this a lot mostly because of those chants. those chants.

**bespectacIed** (10): "If our love is allergy why are you my Claritin"

**bloupp** (10): A perfect EDM song

**Brandon6099** (10): best Zedd song and will be forever, this song is absolute edm-pop perfection <3, Foxes deserves better

**Chevsapher** (10): Even my mom likes this song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I was this close to making this my 11. this is just the perfect song to leave on the background and lose yourself on another activity.

**CritneySpearz** (10): Classic bop

**enecks** (10): I love foxes. They tend to be bottoms in the furry fandom. Which is weird because Fox McCloud (the quintessential furry fox) is such a top). Foxes make the furry fandom run. Fox sex is where the word yiff derives from.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): A fucking iconic song top to bottom

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the top of my head has clarity now that my WIG is gone!

**jamesfog** (10): One of the best EDM songs

**lilguavachan** (10): is it overdramatic as all hell? yes. is it something you'd hear on some teenager's AMV dedicated to their hawt bishie boiz doing sinful, garbage gay things>:3? yes. do i love it anyways? absolutely, 100%.

**MashLuke** (10): This song is perfect. Like super perfect. Like fucking perfect man.

**Me-Luigi** (10): grammy winning excellence

**MrSwearword** (10): it's a shame she faded from the spotlight because this slams

**mudkip1** (10): so good!

**seralite** (10): i mean... its iconic.

**timothy444** (10): If your friends don’t like EDM, show them this. Clarity is such a cinematic masterpiece that just ends up being so big but it never overstays its welcome.

**twat\_brained** (10): How can anyone listen to this and NOT give it a 10? It's got everything you could want in this musical subgenre; lyrical brilliance, towering vocals, buildups which match the mood of the lyrics, and Earth-shattering drops. I'm actually goosebumping from the final chorus; it's just so overpowering and great to listen to. Zedd's PEAK.

**yatcho** (10): I can remember exactly when I first heard this song almost 7 (!!!) years ago. This really changed the game for everyone and still sounds fresh today

**bbfan132** (9.3): sorry, isol :(

**xxrandooxx** (9.3): nostalgic boost

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Can't believe Zedd is a furry

**ramskick** (9): at some point when I heard this song I had a moment of clarity: this song is great.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): this is one of the most influential songs in pop history ever ama

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): this is really good.

**singularlegend** (9): pop classic

**vulture\_couture** (9): Zedd's production used to be like super dense all the time but somehow it worked. He does the absolute most and it ends up working

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): oh man oh boy if only I liked those ‘choir’ voices

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): :b:lassic

**radiofan15** (8): A CLASSIC SURE... but quite dated with that "enthusiastic audience" drop... BUT STILL A CLASSIC

**selegend** (8): I wrote a really long post about this like almost 2 years ago

**Leixander** (7.5): Don't know why this is beloved so much here, it is a nice song nevertheless.

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): good vocals but overrated imo… not a fan of the drops at all. I also remember being a dumb kid and thinking that Zedd was the signer and Foxes were the male vocals in the background and that’s it lol.

**kappyko** (6): foxes delivered so much and the drop is just kind of ehhh girl. the eahhhhs are so damn BAD!!!

**gannade** (3): SO overrated. the vocals and the production never mixed at all, shouldve been a stand alone foxes song.

**shekeepsreceipts** (0): the lyrics are super annoying. a lot of songs in the rate seem to romanticize toxic relationships, and clarity is the worst offender.

[/r/popheads/comments/akfbx1/edmpop_girl_collabs_rate_reveal_day_3_the_point/ef5bjbx/]

=====

Roxieloxie: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Closer The lyrics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of music theory most of the themes will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Halsey's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her singing- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Lorde's Melodrama, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these references, to realize that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Closer truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Drews existential catchphrase "so baby pull me closer," which itself is a cryptic reference to Nick Jonas' Hit song. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those locals scratching their heads in confusion as The Chainsmokers genius wit unfolds itself on their spotify playlist. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Chainsmokers tatoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they gave closer an 11 (preferably higher) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
