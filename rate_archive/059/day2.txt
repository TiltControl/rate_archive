Yesterday I mentioned in the Run on Love cut that there were two songs that easily could have been removed from the rate and nothing would have changed, and it would have been an easy 50. Here‚Äôs the other one! Personally I love this one and Madeon has BOPS in his own discography, but the biggest problem with it is that Ellie‚Äôs voice seems drowned out in the mixing and it‚Äôs easy to tell - many of the comments touch on that. I‚Äôm glad that it managed to make it to day 2 at least! 

---


#Caffeine addicts

**awryj** (10): I miss this Ellie so much :emofish:

**Bendariaku89** (10): i‚Äôve actually listened to this before i ever heard of the rate, which i couldn‚Äôt say to the other ‚Äúother‚Äù songs in this rate with the exception of lean on. that being said, i have nostalgia vibes to this because i‚Äôve been listening to this track for a while. it‚Äôs intense, i like the sort of chase feel this song gives, like we‚Äôre runaways trying to stay awake (get it) in a darkening space wasteland, or even just a post-apocalyptic planet. that imagery just plays on repeat every time i listen to this song, so i personally just love that. plus goulding‚Äôs voice is lovely.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): this song is just a good time

**ImADudeDuh** (10): More like Stay attached cause my WIG currently isnt!

**lilguavachan** (10): one of my favorites from halcyon days, love you ellie queen

**MashLuke** (10): Madeon is crazy talented and this is so well-crafted, Ellie helped EDM become huge back in the day.

**mich4725** (9.5): far from being pop imo other than having pop vocalist?

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): It grows on you. I think that this has the second best production in the rate, but Ellie is actually surprisingly what holds the song down‚Ä¶ her voice sounds weird in the chorus and the lyrics aren‚Äôt amazing

**bespectacIed** (9): God, Halcyon Days is such an epic album and this song represents the mood of the album so well

**camerinian** (9): I was gonna comment on how this sounds like vintage Ellie, before I realised it came out 2012 so it basically is vintage Ellie. Whatever, she sounds amazing over this production, and I wish she would go back to this sound some time

**diamondblaze413** (9): one of like twenty songs madeon actually has

**LandonKidatrea** (9): This song is phenomenal.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): this song is LOUD

**Chevsapher** (8.5): I adore Madeon, but his production really overpowers Ellie's vocals here. With that said, this song has a lot to love.

**jamesfog** (8): Never heard this bop [2]

**MrSwearword** (8): credit for being different for Ellie Goulding

**ramskick** (8): I don't need any help staying awake after listening to this.

**vulture\_couture** (8): The one time I really enjoyed Ellie Goulding on an electro song. This just goes hard.

**twat\_brained** (7.9): It feels like the mixing's a bit loud on the chorus; it's hard to hear what Ellie's singing there. I got lost midway through but then I was brought back in for the final chorus. All in all, I don't really know what Ellie's trying to say here, but I am unfortunately not having an easy time of staying awake, despite me drinking a whole ass bottle of Dr. Pepper earlier. That said, Madeon knows how to bring the beat here and it's an absolute banger.

**Brandon6099** (7): decent bop, not my taste but Ellie is too good

**Me-Luigi** (7): actually didn't know this song before but this works well with the song and I love that she keeps singing over the "drop"

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Huh this could be in a video game

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song is the least Madeon-sounding track out there but it‚Äôs a bop

#Tired

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is ok but her other tracks in the rate are much better.

**evilqueenlex** (6.5): A little too much going on this song but it's still listenable.

**SinfulAnarchy** (6.5): um, I can barely hear Ellie‚Äôs vocals over that loud ass background noise.

**timothy444** (6.1): Filler

**frogaranaman** (6): This feels more like a Rudimental song than a Madeon song.

**tapdancingpig** (6): Holy shit, I think I just heard mixing issues! I haven‚Äôt done that before! It‚Äôs kind of a shame, because I do like this song, but... that‚Äôs a big yikes. Also, I love Ellie, but she should have re-recorded her verses.

**Johnnytoby** (5): another b side but no trust nobody I just am exhausted at least it was kinda cute and ellie

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): The production on this is atrocious, completely drowning out Ellie's voice

**radiofan15** (3.5): I'm trying Ellie, but this song is not letting me!

**notdallin** (3): Hot take: Halcyon Ellie is the worst Ellie era. And that album cover looks like it was taken immediately after she got her Skrillex haircut‚Äîswiveling in that barber‚Äôs chair with the cape still on and everything!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): of the 20 amazing tracks in halcyon days i was forced to rate the only truly bad song :/

**marcryan** (1): Next Song‚Ä¶.. See ya

**seralite** (1): i really did not like this one there was far too much going on

I think this is about as apt of a spot as we could get for this song. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fine. It‚Äôs a song. But many of the other songs in this rate do EDM so much better. The drop is kind of generic, it‚Äôs yet another empowerment anthem, and the personality that usually shines through in Tove‚Äôs solo music doesn‚Äôt really jump out here. Stream her (hopefully) upcoming album please she‚Äôs so good

---

#Heroes

**monkeyattacks** (11): Deserved better on the hot 100.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): this is a classic and i will fight anyone who thinks otherwise

**ManofOranges** (10): Mrs. Lo really went all out for this one.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): for some reason I feel like Tove‚Äôs voice doesn‚Äôt work on this track because I‚Äôm not used to hearing her in empowerment anthems.

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): I LOVE TOVE LO, anyway besides the point. this song is definitely lovely from start to finish. i love the extended HEROES and the verses are nice as well. that message that expressed the feeling of being ordinary, and just wanting to be invincible and OP even if it‚Äôs impossible.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): A little generic and repetitive, perhaps, but the melodies are compelling and the production is quite crisp.

**diamondblaze413** (9.5): took me like four years to refind this, i have no clue how tove agreed to this but i'm glad

**MashLuke** (9): one of Alesso's best songs, Swedish perfection.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Really had a bias against this ever since I heard it being played in every convenience store ever, but now that I'm listening with my earphones I'm actually realising that the production is beautiful. Will this tear down the Berlin Wall? Maybe not, but it's still amazing.

**skargardin** (9): Tove Lo + EDM is a match made in heaven. I will NEVER get tired of this song.

**timothy444** (9): I always adored the music video for this, but in terms of the song itself, the drop is just so hopeful and happy for me to not like it. Every single time I listen to this, I imagine my favourite anime pairing Izuku and Uraraka running through the sunset and saving people. This song pretty much brings the inner weeb in me even though I never express that outside of the Internet.

**1998tweety** (8): I remember hearing this song a bunch when it came out but never knew it was Tove Lo. A solid bop

**Brandon6099** (8): WE COULD BE HEROOOOOES, a huge bop tove lo slays <3

**jamesfog** (8): Very 2014 radio, very that

**ramskick** (8): Tove Lo is a hero as far as I'm concerned.

**sbb618** (8): This song really disappoints me, because I feel like with a little tweaking here and there, this song could hit that next level. But, it's stuck at an 8.

**seralite** (8): bop

**SkyBlade79** (8): tbh not as bad as I remembered

**awryj** (7.8): Tove sounds surprisingly nice on this and I'm not a fan of her vocals

**notdallin** (7.8): once upon a time in early 2015 I wrote this song off because who tf was Alesso and Tove Lo amirite but wait was she the Talking Body lady? aNYWAYS BUT THEN I went on a cruise for the first time a few months later and while the white girls trashily danced around the deck playing (I think?) musical chairs vying to be the Carnival Cruise Princess or some shiz this song played and I WAS NOT THE SAME SUDDENLY THIS SONG‚ÄôS GENIUS WAS LAID UPON ME LIKE THE EDM MANTLE HAD JUST REAPPEARED AFTER DISINTEGRATING IN LATE 2013 ONLY TO GREET ME IN THE WEST CARIBBEAN WITH ITS MERCIFUL DROPS. 7.8/10 WOULD DO IT AGAIN

#Villains

**vhqv1997** (8): They really didn't even try to hide the plagiarism huh?

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I love tove lo‚Äôs voice, not so much the drop

**tapdancingpig** (7.6): I kind of hate the drop, but everything else is top notch. Horny Ellie Goulding is serving vocals and hooks, and the rest of the production bops pretty hard. If only the drop wasn‚Äôt actively unpleasant...

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): This song is fun even if it did get played out by Big Hero 6. Tove Lo and the production sound great but nothing else really seems to stand out for me

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): the lyrics are kind of cheesy, and the song is repetitive. but overall, pretty catchy and decent.

**frogaranaman** (7): Youtube tutorial-core.

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): The drop is a little bit too grating for my tastes

**LandonKidatrea** (7): The Lego Batman Movie was awesome. Watch it if you haven't yet.

**marcryan** (7): I‚Äôm okay being normal

**Me-Luigi** (7): It's a bit basic but I love the way Tove sounds on this

**strawberryswing1** (7): I loved this song and overplayed it sadly :/

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): this song sounds like a motivational poster

**twat\_brained** (6.8): Tove and Alesso could be heroes in the same way that the songwriters could be more inspired. Same with the drop. I still love Tove but this didn't make full use of its potential.

**camerinian** (6): I think it was when this came out that I (and a lot of people) started getting sick of the big EDM sound. Not necessarily a slight against the song, but it was way too late in the game for something this nondescript to come out.

**gannade** (6): the lyrics for this are super cringe. youd prob hear it in some C tier teenage drama/movie about superheroes

**Leixander** (6): has Tove's worst vocal performance

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): fuck the lowercase title

**TragicKingdom1** (6): dated and too repetitive...but not bad.

**radiofan15** (5.5): Bowie was secretly diagnosed with cancer around the time this song was released... coincidence? I THINK NOT

**mich4725** (5): too cheesy, his best songs are actually pure EDM

**MrSwearword** (5): much too bland

**mudkip1** (5): i heard this on the radio recently and it underwhelmed me

**Johnnytoby** (4): it's so cheesy :\

**vulture\_couture** (4): Trite, boring, midtempo slog with zero personality. Technically well done I guess but I miss when pop music was fun.

**ignitethephoenix** (3): idk why but this song gets on my nerves. I feel like I‚Äôve heard it so much but I don‚Äôt remember where I‚Äôve heard it

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (3): I'm pretty sure Tove Lo has never sounded worse than she did on this track

**selegend** (3): Faceless

**singularlegend** (3): ANNOYING!

**unovachamp** (3): Not nearly enough references to thinly veiled references to tits to be a real Tove Lo song

**enecks** (2): Bowie sweetie I am so sorry

**lilguavachan** (2): listen i love miss lo but this is so... overdramatic and unpleasant

Okay this is a ROBBERY. This is such a BANGER. I don‚Äôt love all of David Guetta‚Äôs songs in this rate, but this is by far my favourite. Charli snapped, and I wish this song had been bigger so that she could get more recognition. I think most people‚Äôs issues with this song boil down to the drop, which I guess I can understand because it is a bit grating. There‚Äôs also French Montana, who of course is a m*n and we do not stan those. Seriously though, his feature is kind of really unnecessary and feels a bit tacked on just to try to get extra streams. At least it made it to day 2. 

---

#You like my hair? Gee thanks, just bought it!

**awryj** (10): the best thing he's put out in YEARS... and it's mostly just skrillex and afrojack anyway

**seralite** (10): YAS this is my skank anthem!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song sounds like 5 different songs put together but somehow instead of being a disaster the 5 songs are all actually the legs, arms, and head of Exodia and now Charli XCX has won the Yu-Gi-Oh! match.

**bespectacIed** (9.7): A bop with a rap part that doesn't ruin it!!!

**1998tweety** (9.6): This is what a good mainstream Charli song sounds like. The production, especially in the chorus, is so good. Montana on this is so lame though, I have to take off points.

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): this song at first sounded off, but that slow intro beat coming into that hammerhead chorus caught me so off guard, but it‚Äôs so SO HOT AND NICE. classic charli, but it‚Äôs a lovely song to listen to. french montana is... here, but his voice sounds nice with the instrumental i guess.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): What a banger! It sounds more like a Charli track than a Guetta track, but that's a good thing. Props to French Montana for being better than most rented rappers.

**Me-Luigi** (9.5): Skrillex snapped hard, would have hated the feature less if it was incorporated like it was at the EMA's, French Montana adding "pull up"s near the end and charli also doing "you"s during his verse

**twat\_brained** (9.1): One of the surprise hits of 2017 that sounds a lot better than it probably deserves to. The chorus pops right off, harder than a G.H. Mumm bottle, and Frenchie sounds not too bad on his verse. Would love more of this from David and less "Hey Mama" and "Dangerous".

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): a song in this rate that is under three minutes???? what is this madness

**enecks** (9): I want Charli to have a nice day. If you're reading this Charli, treat yourself.

**Leixander** (9): pull-up pull-up pull-up

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): repeticholi best choli

**mms82** (8.5): Honestly a great song from the DirtySex drop alone- also French Montana is surprisingly good as a feature

**timothy444** (8.5): In spite of David‚Äôs infamous reputation for being the Nickelback of EDM, this song bops and the bass during the Charli chorus sections drops hard and it‚Äôs heavy-hitting to the core! However, some of the parts are annoying and I wouldn't return to it every so often.

**xxrandooxx** (8.5): fuck that rap tho

**tapdancingpig** (8.4): Charli, AG, and Noonie forcibly make a David Guetta song have personality. French Montana hurts the song, but Charli and ‚ÄúDaddy sexy money‚Äù pull through.

**Brandon6099** (8): charli slay

**monkeyattacks** (7): Charli vocals are great on this song.


**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): i want to listen to this with strobe lights

**kappyko** (7): This song shouldn't even exist. Thank god it does, though! A blast on the senses from all involved, future bass as a murder device, a vacuum of space

#French Montana can choke

**strawberryswing1** (8): ugh this would be a 10 without French. Can he please disappear he's the worst part of even his own songs.

**camerinian** (8): God if it was SOPHIE instead of Guetta and, like, Cupcakke instead of whatshisface, this would be a 10/10 banger. Even then, I'm surprised they let Charli this loose on a David Guetta song, since he's really good at sandblasting personality off of his singers

**CritneySpearz** (8): A bop ruined by the awful rap feature

**evilqueenlex** (8): I was all for this song in the intro but then "PULL UP PULL UP PULL UP" happened and I had to reduce it from a nine-point-five to an eight. Plus, French Montana has never been necessary.

**marcryan** (7.6): I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve never heard this song before. French Montana can leave tho.

**sbb618** (7.5): "Put your skin on my skin" does not sound as sexy as these guys seem to think.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): how can the french montana verse be so bad

**Adorable\_Raccoon** (7): charli is the best part of this song

**FireLordAegon** (7): This was pretty horrible, but I'll bump it up because I like the chorus and was blessed by charli's presence

**golden\_bassnectar** (7): would be a 10 without French Montana

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like Charli‚Äôs part but French Montana continues to be the most pointless rapper to exist right now.


**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I actually find Charli's plastic hedonism really entertaining because of how feminine her music's aura is so adding David Guetta to the mix of all people just isn't that entertaining for me

**radiofan15** (6.2): If this is what we need for Charli to remain in the public eye she might better became an independent artist at this point because it's not worthy

**diamondblaze413** (6): french what the hell are you doing here

**jamesfog** (6): Trashy bop. French Montana is trash on this though

**MashLuke** (6): this is fun but also, this is a rate and this is not that good.

**bbfan132** (5.9): this production is shit‚Ä¶ why, charli, why????

**CarlieScion** (5): fuck hannah montana

**frogaranaman** (5): This did not age well.

**LandonKidatrea** (5): I don't know about the rest of you, but I REALLY want to have sex with Charli XCX right now.

**ramskick** (5): sadly Charli XCX is not dirty and French Montana is not sexy.

**yatcho** (4.5): French Montana RUINS anything that was going well in this song

**ImADudeDuh** (4): potential that got fucking ruined on the chorus

**SinfulAnarchy** (4): i knew from the title that this would be bad. it‚Äôs not even catchy, just loud and annoying.

**SkyBlade79** (4): ew @ French montana

**vulture\_couture** (4): I want to like everything with Charli on it out of principle but this is just not interesting in any way

**GamblesWithDesire** (3): This song is obnoxious

**notdallin** (2): Only clean wholesome moneys on me plz!!

**selegend** (2): Poor Afrojack

**lilguavachan** (1): how many times do you need me to stream 1999 so that you don't have to do shit like this ever again? i didn't know you were hurting for money that bad charli.... i'm sorry queen i'll stream it right now

**MrSwearword** (1): leave it to Charli XCX to have something around three minutes that sucks. Also, Beautiful, Dirty, Rich called; it's suing this bullshit for character assassination.

#Rexhars

**Chevsapher** (10): The quality of Cash Cash's music is frustratingly inconsistent, but they were at their artistic peak when this song was released. The effect is euphoric.

**frogaranaman** (10): I completely forgot Bebe Rhexa wasn‚Äôt blonde. Huh.

**gannade** (10): a MASSIVE BOP!!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Take me home cause im embarrassed cause my WIG flew off in public after hearing this song!

**kappyko** (10): edm queen and goddess

**ManofOranges** (10): I was thinking this song was gonna be like a 6 because it's from a producer I've never heard of before and also it has Bebe but no they really came out here and delivered an absolute smash.

**marcryan** (10): Did not expect my wig glue to run out.

**MashLuke** (10): this was my shit on freshman year in high school back when Bebe was still a newcomer. It took her a lot to release a debut.

**Me-Luigi** (10): martin solveig found crying after bebe pitched him this and he denied it (for being "too pop") then bebe and cash cash reworked it, still cash cash's most streamed song and bebe sounds amazing

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my good friend u/d4m1t always refers to Bebe as ‚ÄúBebe Recharge‚Äù and idk why it always cracks me up lmao

**MrSwearword** (10): I forgot that Bebe was on something legit enjoyable before the EPs.

**PuggleMaster** (10): BITCH! I DID NOT KNOW BEBE SANG THISNADKL;FSDFNASDKLNFLASDK;NFLK

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): how the hell do you expect me to choose an 11

**SkyBlade79** (10): god damn this is a fucking banger oh shit. VOCALS. LYRICS. INTONATION. VOCODER. BUILDUP. SLIGHTLY DISSAPOINTING DROP THAT DOESN‚ÄôT REALLY HURT THE SONG‚ÄôS QUALITY

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): EDM DJs, you were asked this week to present me with a Bebe Rexha feature I would like. Congrats Cash Cash, you are the winner of this challenge.

**yatcho** (9.5): Bebe kinda sucks as a solo pop girl but man she's fucking fantastic in EDM collabs. This banger was on repeat for months in 2013 for me and kind of defines that time for me

**tapdancingpig** (9): People like to shit on Bebe, but her vocal here is a large part of what makes this song work. She sells the shit out of the song‚Äôs euphoria.

**awryj** (8.5): bebe sounds like ellie goulding on crack here

**notdallin** (8.4): hearing this song in 2014, having no idea who Bebe Rexha was, made me know that she was a vocalist to WATCH.

**jamesfog** (8): Bop from before Bebe was famous

**Brandon6099** (7): decent bop

**monkeyattacks** (7): Bebe proving to be a star in the making

**ramskick** (7): something something I'd like to take Bebe Rexha home

**selegend** (6): One of ha best

#Rolling around at the speed of sound

**diamondblaze413** (10): it feels slightly awkward that i only know these guys from a sonic game theme song

**camerinian** (6): I‚Äôm never going to be able to see Cash Cash as anything but the guys who made the Sonic Colours soundtrack

#Perverts

**1998tweety** (7.9): Bebe can do much better than this tbh.

**twat\_brained** (7.7): One Direction remains as unbothered as ever. The beat's pretty good and even though Bebe's yowling isn't as obnoxious here as songs like "Ferrari" or what was in the Pop Girl Prophecy rate it's not enough to make this song great sadly.

**radiofan15** (7.5): I've heard this drop like 12 times before... come on Pervert-repelant, you can do better than this

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): I remember being obsessed with this song. it sounds kind of cheap and dated though, like a used car from 2004.

**timothy444** (7.5): Like most songs that Bebe Rexha has touched, it‚Äôs very average and a bit outdated a few months after the release. It doesn‚Äôt help that she chose to collaborate with some of the most mediocre producers in the industry.

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): The acoustic version of this song is a straight 10, but the drop in the original is a little grating for me

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): look at that baby rexha

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): TO THE PLACEEEEEEE WHERE I BELOOOONG

**FireLordAegon** (6): This is more like a five, but this is better than all my other 5s so hopefully this song enjoys this score inflation cause it needs it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): The whole reason why Bebe's career is flopping is because of songs like this don't @ me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): John Denver outsold

**vulture\_couture** (6): the big synth drop is really good but the rest of this kinda blows

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this is disgustingly dated (especially for a song that was included on their 2016 album) but kinda bops a lil

**vhqv1997** (5): So I have never listened to Bebe Rexha at all, but is her enunciation always this cringey? Also this song ends so awkwardly, like it's supposed to continue for a bit longer but accidentally got cut off

**Leixander** (4): Bebe don't touch EDM music unless you go 100% for it challenge.

**Bendariaku89** (2): the verses sound like studio killers, who has more interesting songs and beats than this pile of ‚Äúsometimes okay sounding but not all the time‚Äù song. the verses is the highest high of the song, while the rest just evokes ‚ÄúDONE BEFORE‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt really saved by bebe‚Äôs singing.

**lilguavachan** (1.5): she sounds like a cockatoo in heat, please stop making her a thing, music industry.

**enecks** (1): Take Bebe Rexha home so she can't release shitty pop songs

**Johnnytoby** (1): But where is Trust Nobody!??!?!? This song is literally a nobody :^(

It‚Äôs somewhat weird to include a PC Music producer in an EDM rate but, if you take the definition of EDM (electronic dance music), I say this fits the bill just fine :shrug:. It also features Queen Carly, who of course is adored by everyone here. I honestly thought this might have done a bit better than it did, because PC Music + Carly, but here it is in the early stage of Day 2. Honestly, I‚Äôm okay 	with it leaving fairly early, because while I do like some of the work of PC Music producers (especially with Charli), this song is just kind of uninteresting to me. When Gwen Stefani said ‚Äúthis shit is bananas‚Äù, she wasn‚Äôt talking about this song, as much as Carly may want that to be the case! Buy Carly‚Äôs next single on itunes

---

#THIS SHIT IS BANANAS

**awryj** (10): invented bananas, gwen stefani found dead in a ditch

**FireLordAegon** (10): Queen of EDM

**jamesfog** (10): PC Music'd bop

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my parents

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Carly make good music again challenge

**tapdancingpig** (10): I‚Äôm betting this will get robbed. It‚Äôs a little off putting and weird, but it‚Äôs also delightful. Huge Danny‚Ñ¢Ô∏è is a production god and Carly is adorable as always.

**theburningundead** (10): HUGE DANNY

**twat\_brained** (10): I love this because it sounds euphoric and feels like the perfect combination of Cascada at their peak and the futuristic overtones of PC Music. Definitely gonna check out Danny after this rate!

**Chevsapher** (9.8): Danny is at his best when he has well-structured songs to layer his production around, and Carly gave him a lot to work with here. It's DDR-esque bubblegum pop in the best way possible.

**timothy444** (9.2): So when listening to these songs presented on the rate, I‚Äôd like to listen to the producer‚Äôs other works to get a feel of them, and I got to say, Danny‚Äôs distinct style matches amazingly with Carly‚Äôs voice. It‚Äôs like a match in heaven and he didn‚Äôt disappoint!

**bespectacIed** (9): The production is soooo dated but it's okay cause it's carly

**camerinian** (9): I'm a huge dan of this song

**evilqueenlex** (9): Ooh that beat and CRJ, IT'S A MATCH PLANET EARTH! But I was hoping the chorus would give me more :(

**lilguavachan** (9): carly has the voice for PC music. take that as you will.

**1998tweety** (8.7): This song reminds me of those weird Snuggle Bunny ringtone commercials. They bopped, just like this song does.

**bloupp** (8): Carly sounds amazing as always but the chorus is a bit meh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Carly Rae Jepsen is in fact supernatural

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): bananas

**ramskick** (7): Carly Rae's chameleon like nature is indeed super natural.

**MashLuke** (7.5): nice vibe and cool production.

**diamondblaze413** (7): carly will forever deserve better but at the same time she kills us all

**LandonKidatrea** (7): This song is so bananas

**kappyko** (6): cute bop ig

**marcryan** (6): Queen of tucking me into bed then blasting a boombox in my face and gluing my wig back on. Thank you Ms. Rae!

#Hollaback Girls

**ManofOranges** (7.9): This song is like an anomaly for me. Like it sounds perfectly fine and yet something's just not clicking like I don't know what it is.

**notdallin** (7.7): kappyko: not enough carly in this rate. hikkaru: I guess danny l harle is *kindaa* an EDM artist‚Ä¶ well I mean he‚Äôs from PC music. kappyko: close enough

**Brandon6099** (7): okay song not my taste, sorry Carly still love you <3

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): not gonna lie halfway through i kinda doze off and started thinking about wtf was happening on that cover

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I can hear the PC Music elements if I listen really hard but I don't feel as if this strikes the perfect bubblegum pop Carly did for Emotion quite as organically

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): this is the one song that sticks out in the this rate because it‚Äôs not all in my face and it kind of stresses me out a little

**vhqv1997** (7): Sam and Dean Winchester are shaking

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): love me like that >>

**radiofan15** (6.2): With an slighty faster tempo I can see myself dancing to this song in Dance Dance Revolution... and that's not a compliment

**cyborglilith** (6): Not to hate on Carly, but nothing about her (both vocally and aesthetically) demands my attention.

**enecks** (6): It ain't all that


**seralite** (6): baby its so bananas

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5.5): i want to like this i just dont

**Me-Luigi** (5): this ain't it

**monkeyattacks** (5): Was conflicted, song is meh but at the same time it just works.

**selegend** (5): It‚Äôs cute

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): this sounds like elevator music.

**vulture\_couture** (5): I love Carly Slay Jesuspsen but this just isn't working out too well

**frogaranaman** (4): Okay, now I‚Äôm being reminded as to why Carly has flopped so hard out of the public conscious.

**GamblesWithDesire** (3): I've never been a fan of Carly's voice and nothing about this song has changed that. It's a 3 only because the instrumentals are passable.

**gannade** (3): carly i am so sorry that you are on this terrible track

**SkyBlade79** (3): this feels very immature

**Bendariaku89** (1): carly can‚Äôt save this no matter how nice her voice sounds.

**MrSwearword** (1): it's just got so much against it; bad production, weak vocals, an overall air of "well I couldn't come up with better but hey".

David Guetta and Sia is a classic combo, and they have like‚Ä¶ seven collaborations now. It would be kind of amusing if we were to rate them all tbh but ultimately songs like Bang My Head and Flames were cut for being fairly mediocre. Not like this one isn‚Äôt, I guess, seeing as it‚Äôs out here, but here‚Äôs a fun fact! This song was, at one point, in the bottom five. It slowly crawled its way out of the depths of Day 3 and made it here and I‚Äôm proud of it. It‚Äôs a pretty decent song in my opinion, and I really like the drop. It‚Äôs the content of the verses that I‚Äôm iffy on, it‚Äôs just a bit boring comparatively and creates a sense of dissonance in the song. I do like it better than the Shakira song though. 

---

#Furries [2]

**mich4725** (11): will probably be overshadowed by Titanium, but it might be even better

**vulture\_couture** (11): Yeah I didn't expect this to be my 11 going in but here we go. The Guetta beat is peak eurodance goodness and Sia delivers an incredible performance. The lyrics are mostly tortured metaphors about I guess being in love with something that's going to destroy you but it doesn't matter because the emotion is all there.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): another contender for my 11, this song is just so emotional

**Johnnytoby** (10): Shakira almost wishes

**Leixander** (10): This plucks at my heart strings for no reason at all.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my absolute bop of 2012

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Deserved Titanium's success

**radiofan15** (10): My favorite Sia/Guetta collab, I really missed them together... 'Flames'? #IDontKnowHer

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this is so embarrassing but i found this song because i heard it in a porn video and shazamed it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm falling to pieces‚Äù bitch me too

**timothy444** (9.9): Not as great as Titanium but still is beautiful in its own right. The bass drop is also arguably better than their first collaboration. It‚Äôs just a shame that it was released a bit too early in the wake of Titanium still charting and being fresh at the time. That alone kills off some of its uniqueness to the piece.

**twat\_brained** (9.7): Someone tell me why Marshmello and Selena released what they did when this exists. Someone said they thought this was better than Titanium and I'm gonna sit at their table on this one. As astonishing as that is, it just feels like Sia, whose voice goes above and beyond on both the verses and the chorus despite maintaining a level of vulnerability, and David are on an even greater wavelength here. I also rate the haunting outro with those strings.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Sia and strings are a match made in heaven. The percussion feels a bit too stiff in places, but the drop goes ridiculously hard!

**FireLordAegon** (9.5): Shakira is falling to pieces

**awryj** (9): the better titanium

**diamondblaze413** (9): the phrase "she wolf" just sounds so fucking weird to me but it hits

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): this is really good.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Oh hey how have I never heard of this collaboration here it has fantastic lyrics

**yatcho** (8.5): That drop is so sexy

**1998tweety** (8.1): Was this trying to recreate the success of Titanium? I mean its not bad but not spectacular either.

**Bendariaku89** (8): thought it was kesha but sia is a nice delight otherwise. i don‚Äôt know why. but it‚Äôs one hell of a song, that really took my by surprise the first time i heard that chorus. i think it‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs a great song regardless.

**frogaranaman** (8): Me during my weekly school-induced panic attack.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Shakira is shook!

**selegend** (8): I‚Äôm kinda convinced Guetta only makes good music when he‚Äôs working with Sia; amazing drop

**Brandon6099** (7): classic duo david and guetta

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Sia and EDM never go wrong, unless you add fetty wap.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): lmao remember this thing. she sounds as good as ever tho.

**xxrandooxx** (6.2): love ya sia

#Shakira outsold

**sbb618** (7.8): Is it just me, or does this metaphor feel a little strained?

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Sia sings the crap of this one, but the drop is a little out of place.

**vhqv1997** (7): Is this just a different version of Titanium?

**MashLuke** (6.5): a Titanium ripoff.

**evilqueenlex** (6): This song is doing entirely too much.

**LandonKidatrea** (6): I want to compare this song to Wolves, the other song in this rate that uses wolf imagery. This song does a better job selling the wolf imagery. Sia sounds like she's fighting against the beat. The song sounds disjointed and messy, which fits the theme of the lyrics but makes it sound kind of bad. It's kind of hard to listen to tbh.

**ramskick** (6): you know what else falls to pieces? a bit of my respect for Sia for doing this song.

**CritneySpearz** (5): Sorry but I would only enjoy this drop if I was 12 or on drugs

**enecks** (5): Shakira outsold

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): This one is way, way, wayyyyy too drop heavy for me. It could stand to have like 2 minutes chopped from it.

**gannade** (5): omg the beat does NOT MATCH WITH SIA

**skargardin** (5): Utterly forgettable. It haven‚Äôt nearly stood the test of time as well as titanium.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this was never better than mediocre, even back then

**notdallin** (4.4): I thought we were rating the Shakira song there for a second and I got really happy

**camerinian** (4): this is literally just Titanium again with a more obnoxious, tonally inconsistent drop. Even the video is the fucking same oh my god I hate David Guetta

**kappyko** (4): whats wrong with his posture???

**monkeyattacks** (4): Doesn't do much for me.

**marcryan** (3): I like (insert female vocalist‚Äôs) voice and that was about it.

**SkyBlade79** (3): this drop is garbage

**lilguavachan** (2): gurl... why was miss guetta a thing

**MrSwearword** (1): grating and blasphemes the spirit of the better She Wolf, Shakira.

#Party for one

**1998tweety** (10): Masturbation BOP. The chorus slaps hard, and unlike Cashmere Cat and SOPHIE, this song has some weird production but doesn't go too far to the point where its bad. Demi queenie too

**bigenemies** (10): This song is SO MUCH FUN! Like.. I usually get annoyed by censorship but f-woop woop woop is the catchiest fuck I‚Äôve heard.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Another bop that should have been bigger in the summer.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the censored words almost sound whale to me

**PuggleMaster** (10): one of the best singles of 2018

**singularlegend** (10): excellence

**radiofan15** (9.5): Damn is there anything Demi can't do other than having a top 5 hit? and don't you dare to go to the obvious answer you unconsidered swines!

**Brandon6099** (9): three words: quack quack quack

**Chevsapher** (9): Definitely a grower. Some of the production choices are a little obnoxious, but the driving beat and the songwriting are more than enough to keep me interested.

**Johnnytoby** (9): that drop!

**selegend** (9): Sounds nothing like a Demi Lovato song, I appreciate my girl doing something different

**tapdancingpig** (9): I kind of hate the US for sleeping on this weird-ass bop.

**awryj** (8.8): farty for one wishes

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): üê§üê§üê§

**marcryan** (8.3): Weird Chorus but I now all I want to do is QUACK QUACK QUACK

**diamondblaze413** (8): eh solo solo errybody

**enecks** (8): This is a mess but it makes me laugh so I'll give it a 8

**MashLuke** (8): a masturbation anthem. Love it, it's catchy to the right point, it has a replay value.

**Me-Luigi** (8): woop woop woop

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): There's no super good moment in this track but I really enjoy how Demi exerts good control of her voice here and shows that she doesn't need to belt out for you to call her vocals great

**ramskick** (8): sometimes I dance to this song when I'm solo.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): that weird censoring sound threw me off at first but it bops i guess

**vulture\_couture** (8): I wanted to hate this but there's just too much fun choices here not to give it a high ranking. And Demi is great on it.

**frogaranaman** (6): Love masturbation anthems !

**kappyko** (6): drop best part!!! wait i meant the vocal drop the drop drop is kinda weird. Clean Bandit's transition from using strings as really gorgeous organic backing on a lush mall-disco song to just weird melodramatic pieces in troppop is disappointing. demi does great here

#Brokenhearted

**sbb618** (7.8): This one falls into the "great buildup, great chorus, super annoying in-between" category.

**timothy444** (7.5): That chorus really took me off guard and part of me says that in a not-so-good way. What I particularly dislike about it is that it just isn't Clean Bandit anymore and felt like Instruction Part II rather than its own thing. It's more generic dance poppy than the style that made me fall into Clean Bandit in the first place.

**twat\_brained** (7.5): Demi is a great vocalist but it sadly feels like her efforts aren't used to her fullest potential, much like her Jax Jones collab. And she doesn't really add much to the music video but for a few glamour shots here and there, which, by the way, what is this video? Makes no sense to me. Clean Bandit have many a great single but it saddens me to say this isn't one of them, because they have some great stuff in this rate.

**cyborglilith** (7): quack quack quack

**evilqueenlex** (7): I like Demi's voice but I don't really like the hook. That repeated vocal thing sounds gimmicky.

**SinfulAnarchy** (6.5): somehow this manages to be both catchy yet annoying at the same time.

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): The jittery vocal effect in the chorus is really grating and prevents me from fully bopping to this song

**LandonKidatrea** (6): I wanna FWOOP! FWOOP! FWOOP! and QUACK! QUACK! QUACK! too Demi.

**Leixander** (6): i wanna quack quack quack but i am off to pahty

**lilguavachan** (6): not demetria's best, but even the best pop stars have their misses.

**notdallin** (6): I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôve been looking at those gosh-awful enlarged multicoloured body part(?) single artworks for all of these Clean Bandit songs for freaking TWO YEARS

**camerinian** (5): I CAN READ HER LIPS YA KNOW, SHE‚ÄôS OBVIOUSLY SAYING ‚ÄòFUCK‚Äô, PRETENDING SHE‚ÄôS AN AMBULANCE ISN‚ÄôT MAKING YA SONG BETTER

**MrSwearword** (5): dated but too mediocre for derision

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I wanna ‚Äúwoo woo woo‚Äù but I‚Äôm brokenhearted, ‚Äúquack quack quack‚Äù because I am a duck.

**FireLordAegon** (4.5): It's an good song but the sound effects in the chorus ruins it

**zekkyzach** (4): if i can hear a song on the radio for months and not know who either artist is, we have a problem

**ComeOnPupperfish** (3): :duck: | Again, WHY WAS THIS A HIT OVER SYMPHONY

**Bendariaku89** (2.5): that chorus is just awful, what with the triple fwoops and cries that just ruin what would be one hell of a song for this rate. the post-chorus sounds like the actual better chorus that should‚Äôve been reworked to be the chorus or they should‚Äôve even just cut out that horrendous chorus. i hate this sorely for that chorus, which is a shame, because i love the rest of the song.

To me, this is the definition of a 6. Not great, but not bad. I think it would probably be slightly better if the dude didn‚Äôt sing and it was just Demi, but even then, it‚Äôs inoffensive and fine. I think that‚Äôs what got it to an average very close to the overall average, and what kept it around this range for literally the entire rate (it never left Day 2). Go stream Feeling of Falling and support a Kim Petras bop without Dr. Puke thank you

---

#We can't make any promises now, can we babe?

**bloupp** (10): This was my jam last summer

**lilguavachan** (10): solo? that was a miss for me, demetria. this? this is a hit, queen.

**PuggleMaster** (10): one of my favorite songs of 2017. Should've went top 10

**selegend** (10): My favorite of the Demi songs in this list tbh, it just slaps all the way through

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): this song has no business being this good

**twat\_brained** (10): I mean this is great and all, but did this have to be the only Cheat Codes song in the rate? What about their song with Little Mix? Regardless, I think Cheat Codes know how to play to their strengths here, especially their vocalist, Trevor, whose back and forth with Demi is very complementary to one another's vocal styles, and the production here is honestly quite solid. I see potential for this as a top 10 darkhorse!

**Chevsapher** (9.5): This is my second-favorite Demi Lovato song, after ‚ÄúCool for the Summer.‚Äù The drop is well-worth the wait, and the vocal ad-libs are a clever touch.

**radiofan15** (9.5): This song won me over over the course of like 6 months in which it was played on radio non-stop, it's charming and harmless... a certified bop done dirty buy the GP

**camerinian** (9): I mean the Cheat Codes guy is boring as shit, but everything else about this song is straight up bop. I like that they add more groove to the drop in the second half, which a lot of producers can‚Äôt be bothered with doing nowadays, and Demi puts in a hell of a performance. She compliments this really well.

**marcryan** (9): Reminds me of summer and car crashes.

**yatcho** (8.7): This is soooooo underrated among everyone here. Demi has never sounded better to me

**evilqueenlex** (8.5): I feel like the guy was an unnecessary addition to this song but I'll allow it.

**Leixander** (8.5): Would it be funny if I say that I like the male vocals here more than Demi's?

**notdallin** (8.5): ahhhhhhhhhhhh but how can you promise me no promises when you promised me no promises??? https://imgur.com/a/txXSDo8

**1998tweety** (8.2): A bit generic but it bops, I wish this was a bigger hit.

**gannade** (8): a little shouty but yas demi

**kappyko** (8): Okay bop

**Me-Luigi** (8): my fav spotify plants lauv & loote snapped when writing and co-producing this, wish they didn't sell the song since it would've been more interesting

**tapdancingpig** (8): Pretty cute.

**vulture\_couture** (8): LAUV cowrote this and he's great <3 but yeah this is an all-around solid song, Demi delivers here, Cheat Codes make it still stand out from the crowd, I'm happy

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): I like the Demi verses the most

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): pretty good

**seralite** (7): i listened to it out of hatred after hearing this song play at my retail job but then unironically started liking it

#Male vocalists begone

**xxrandooxx** (8): this song has a catchy drop, the rest is meh tbh

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Not a huge fan of this song as a whole but god I miss Demi doing well and slaying with each new release :(

**bbfan132** (7.2): it‚Äôs only this high because my mom bops to it whenever it‚Äôs on the radio and i want to respect her opinion

**Brandon6099** (7): decent bop meh, Solo is way better

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): i feel like i've already heard this same song 6 times

**InfernalSolstice** (7): too anticlimactic

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): ^ ^ v v < > < > b a start

**timothy444** (6.5): A discount version of Closer that is neither memorable or relatable. It‚Äôs like if Kidz Bop wrote this or something.

**MashLuke** (6): bland as their music usually. Just hypebeasts making songs.

**ramskick** (6): I give no promises that I'll remember this song tomorrow.

**frogaranaman** (5): This song is a basic bitch bop but if it didn‚Äôt define my basic bitch summer then I don‚Äôt know what did.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): The processing on Demi's voice here doesn't click for me and it brings the whole song down along with it

**ImADudeDuh** (5): honestly radio play killed this for me, and it never was a fave of mine to begin with.

**enecks** (4): Demi keeps getting bad EDM

**MrSwearword** (4): the male vocals ruin this otherwise decent at best song

**SkyBlade79** (4): repetitive af

**Bendariaku89** (2.5): i have the problems with this song and solo in that if this song was reorder and produced differently with better choruses, i would've loved it.

This is an earworm if I‚Äôve ever heard it, but the question that remains to be answered is if it‚Äôs a good one or not. Many seemed to go to the positive side on this song, and I can see why - it‚Äôs incredibly catchy. The biggest issue that will forever plague this song is its similarity to Zedd‚Äôs previous hit, Stay (which is still in the rate!), because of the vocoder and ticking and whatnot. Zedd sweetie, you‚Äôre probably my favourite producer in this rate and True Colours is one of my favourite albums ever, but you need to make your songs sound more unique from each other! Another issue I have with this song is that Maren feels completely stripped of personality, which I feel she has quite a bit of in her solo yeehaw work, so that‚Äôs somewhat disappointing. :maren:

---

#Stay in the middle

**HerculesMeow** (11): What can I say, I've been a Maren stan ever since the country girls rate

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): THE MIDDLE IS A BOP, Y'ALL ARE JUST MEAN AND BANNED FROM TARGET

**MashLuke** (10): this song was a grower for me, it took me months before falling in love with it but it is really good. Maren's vocals are so good.

**Me-Luigi** (10): this song is perfect

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this song had more than 5 demos from multiple artists, but drowning Maren in AutoTune??? what was the point??

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): One of the best pop hits in recent years, I said what I said

**radiofan15** (10): A Record of the Year nominee wherever you like it or not. Demi, Canola, Anne-Marie, Carly, Tove Lo, Bishop Briggs, Bebe, Lauren, Daya, Charli and Elle really missed out.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The second best Grammys Target ad (p.s. Target put It Takes Two with Carly Rae and Lil Yachty back on streaming services)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): country queen snapped

**timothy444** (10): My most played song of this year and for good reason. Zedd didn‚Äôt need to prove himself but he did, and he has outdone himself by choosing to collab with a country singer, making the genre more than bearable. I know that there was a Bebe Rexha demo and countless other flops auditioned to be featured but Zedd choose to be bold and it paid off. Some people say that it‚Äôs ‚ÄòStay 2.0‚Äô but it really isn‚Äôt. It borrows some elements from that and makes it fresh while also retaining the boppiness that the former song delivered on.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): The vocoders and the layering turn a good song into a great one.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): oh baBY. WHY don‚Äôt you just meet me in tHE MIDDLE

**sbb618** (9.5): People say that it sounds just like "Stay". Is that supposed to be a bad thing?

**marcryan** (9.3): Established and Opened Target Stores across America.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): wow this grey chick is a really good vocalist üëÄ

**vulture\_couture** (9): should I feel bad for loving this? I don't feel bad. There's precision in every single choice Zedd makes here and the end result is awesome.

**xxrandooxx** (9): fuck yall with this catchy ass song you know damn well you can not give this a bad rap

**1998tweety** (8.8): A huge bop but honestly its a bit average, Maren is a slay tho can really makes the song what it is.

**evilqueenlex** (8.5): That tick-tock sound in the background makes this song but I wish the singer had more of a distinctive voice.

**notdallin** (8.5): I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I didn‚Äôt think much of this song until I saw the New York Times video about how it was made. It didn‚Äôt give me a whole lot of respect for Zedd, who literally did jack for the song, but all of the moving parts that go into a pop song was so inspirational, it really endeared it to me. Maren adds a lot here.

**bbfan132** (8.3): :kimbryell:

**awryj** (8): one of my life goals is to hear charli's and carly's demos for this song

**bespectacIed** (8): Wanted to give this is a lower score but before this was overplayed to death, I actually loved it more than its mother Stay

**Johnnytoby** (8): yeehaw

**ManofOranges** (8): You know I was gonna give this song a 10 but then I went and listened to Stay and I was like oh and so I gave it an 8. That's all I have to say about that.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Can we just reflect on the fact that Carly almost snagged this song before Maren Morris snagged it? Faith is truly working against us

**ramskick** (8): I want Maren Morris to stay in the middle between country and pop.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): maren goes OFF but kinda generic otherwise

#Losing my mind

**vhqv1997** (8): This song is not bad, but why the fuck was it nominated for 3 Grammys

**Brandon6099** (7): WHY DONT YOU JUST MEET ME IN THE MIDDLE, stay 2.0 but not as good (sorry not sorry)

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): stay but not as good

**jamesfog** (7): Overplayed and didn't deserve Grammy. Love Maren tho

**MrSwearword** (7): the above par but close enough

**diamondblaze413** (6.5): it's... there

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I hate it when an artist has a successful song and then makes their next song with pretty much the same formula and style. It‚Äôs not bad, but this is basically Stay 2.0.

**SinfulAnarchy** (6.5): why does this sound so generic

**frogaranaman** (5): This is one of the most painfully average songs I have ever heard.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Maren sweetie, pls next time you go into pop music, pls don't do it as part of a target commercial...

**tapdancingpig** (5): Oh dear. I have such complicated feelings about this and Stay. First of all, I think this is the better song of the two. The tune works a little better for me, and I think Maren is a better vocalist than Alessia. However, you can‚Äôt ignore that it‚Äôs a rehash of the original. And the song still isn‚Äôt perfect, or even all that great. The lyrics are subpar, the ticking clock gimmick still feels a little shoehorned, and the chorus is kind of boring. The last chorus in particular is a HUGE letdown. The bridge is pretty great though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Everyone is going to be commenting about how this is Stay 2, but I‚Äôm here to tell you, Stay is actually The Middle 2. Zedd‚Äôs disruption in the time space continuum, as evidenced by the ticking sounds in the instrumental, is trying to tell the listener that Maren is actually adrift in space, trying to reconnect to the past via a tesseract a la Interstellar. She is saying she needs to meet Alessia ‚Äúin the middle‚Äù so they can connect and save the human race. So technically, The Middle was first.

**twat\_brained** (4.7): Keep Grey away from Zedd. This just sounds like a pitched bootleg of "Starving" and "Stay", two, pardon my pun, middling songs on their own, not least of which combined which just makes it somehow even lower quality. Why did we let this go top 5 and not "80s Mercedes"? Also, that pitched vocal schtick really started to wear on me with the release of this song. Fittingly, I see this song going out right in the middle of the rankings. I hope the hosts see to it that this comes to light.

**bloupp** (4): Stay part 2, but worse

**selegend** (4): Maren is so disappointingly anonymous in this

**enecks** (3): What if Stay but bad

**Leixander** (3): No, OMG NO!

**yatcho** (3): This song succeeds in being catchy by brute force. It represents the extreme normification of EDM post-Chainsmokers, theres no fun to be found here just background noise. Also what the fuck did Zedd even do to this song besides adding clock noises

**camerinian** (2): maren why

**Bendariaku89** (1): bland. if we were rating the stay/the middle mashup, this would be higher, but this song by itself is stay 2.0. stay is just a better song than this (though stay isn‚Äôt great either).

**singularlegend** (0): this is just stay with new lyrics

This is the EPITOME of 2012 and I love it. You‚Äôve got David Guetta‚Äôs production from his prime, Nicki doing her sing-rap thing, ugh it‚Äôs iconic. What‚Äôs even more iconic is the rap verse, which is definitely by far most definitely absolutely her best verse she‚Äôs ever done. Monster is shaking. For a large portion of the rating period, this song was flopping HARD and it was so sad, but the swath of scores nearing the due date raised it up into Day 2 with an actually decent average, and for that I‚Äôm so thankful. 2012 is a year I have a decent amount of nostalgia for regarding popular music, and this song is definitely a part of that. I-I-I-I-I-I

#Turned on

**Chevsapher** (10): The autotune is a little harsh, but everything else about this song is so infectiously ebullient that I don't really care.

**Johnnytoby** (10): I didnt know Nicki sang this I'm so shook

**ManofOranges** (10): This song came out of nowhere like I wasn't expecting it and it just came and blew me away!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i need more Nicki Minaj singing

**mudkip1** (10): HOLY FUCK i forgot this song existed

**PuggleMaster** (10): It was between this and "We Found Love" for my 11, but seeing how this sub hates Nicki i'm prepared for sabotage. I remember her opening one award show and it was one of my favorite performances ever

**radiofan15** (10): Who says Nicki can't sing? Maybe she should ditch the whole rapper thing so Stormy doesn't sabotage her career no more

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): fuck there‚Äôs no possible description for this other than banger :(

**SkyBlade79** (10): yo this is a fucking banger and those drums yes LORD

**strawberryswing1** (10): :weray:

**twat\_brained** (10): God, this was such an adrenaline rush back in 2012. Its magic hasn't really been lost on me; we need EDM like this back on the charts! We also need Nicki to be a good role model, but let's be realistic about our aspirations.

**vulture\_couture** (10): This one is just utter silliness but I kinda miss music like that. Popstar Nicki is fun and she gets to sing about how she's literally going to die if someone doesn't come and turn her on and #relatable

**1998tweety** (9.6): Nicki is a queen haters stay pressed that you can't cancel her hihi. Always coming for her cause she's more talented and relevant than your flop faves? Seethe. [2] This song does bop harder than Hey Mama though, Nicki's ok singing doesn't bring the track down since the autotune fits well with the style of the song. As always she drops bars.

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): that chorus with the TURN ME ON is so danceable, just wants me to standing under running water and just DANCE WITHOUT CARE while i have a boner... what, i mean it‚Äôs called turn me on. also what‚Äôs that nicki minaj feature? it was so weak damn.

**sbb618** (9.5): A lot of these songs have super weird videos. This one...might be the weirdest.

**timothy444** (9.5): A sex-positive dance anthem that is mildly cringey but catchy as heck despite the semi-outdated synths and bass present in this song. Unlike ‚ÄòHey Mama‚Äô, it still holds up as a guilty pleasure though I suspect it‚Äôs because it wasn‚Äôt as popular as the other Nicki Minaj collab.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): ok the upbeat part snuck up on me

**jamesfog** (9): Miss Maraj may have snapped here.

**Leixander** (9): Singer Nicki (or her ghost singer) jumped out.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This has been one of my favourite Nicki features for a long time. I like when Nicki does pop once in a while, because she‚Äôs decent at it.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Nicki isn‚Äôt at her best as a singer, but she sounds pretty decent here, the hook works, and her rap is incredibly energetic.

**awryj** (8): basically only girl (in the world) #2 but that song is an 11 so // edit: oh wait i just got to the i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i part

**kappyko** (8): FUCK ME UP what is THIS

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The YouTube comments section of this song is all thirteen year olds getting shook about learning what the title actually means

**rotating3Dtext** (8): WOW REMEMBER THIS. I like it in a dumb club song way

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Empirical proof Nicki needs to be on more pop tracks

**diamondblaze413** (7.5): it really does exist huh

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): Nicki Minaj calling for a doctor and asking for someone to save her is so fitting for 2018 Nicki. Also, the theme of this song seems to be "if you don't have sex with me I will literally die." That is so extra, I almost love it.


#Dan Nicky your Bobbie s

**ramskick** (7): Nicki Minaj's boobs turn me on.

#Turned off

**Brandon6099** (7): bop but not feeling it that much anymore

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): This is about as basic as David Guetta EDM gets, honestly, and Nicki is never as compelling when she's singing

**vhqv1997** (7): Nicki's rap verse sounds unnecessary in her own song

**xxrandooxx** (7): middle school light me up

**MashLuke** (6.5): again, this is fun but not quality.

**notdallin** (6.3): [just act like everything around you turns you on](https://youtu.be/A0-1vwCn-WM?t=163)

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): This slaps but it's also really bad, Queen teas

**bbfan132** (5.7): this is such a flimsy song :/

**selegend** (5): Bop but also Nicki‚Äôs vocals aren‚Äôt really the tea lol

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): aged like milk. also, it‚Äôs not sexy at all, lyrics are quite cringy.

**frogaranaman** (4): If I was straight, this music video would give me a robot fetish.

**TragicKingdom1** (4): nicki sounds like ass on this song lmfao, where them girls at >>>>>>>

**camerinian** (3): David Guetta‚Äôs music, regardless of what sound he‚Äôs ripping off, always finds a way to give me a headache, and the minor keys and bass seemingly mixed louder than normal underneath Nicki‚Äôs screeching chorus guaranteed that. The worst part is that there‚Äôs this little crashing drum fill right before the chorus drop that sounds like it could be the core to a sick breakbeat song or something, but that would be an inspired idea in a David Guetta song, and we can‚Äôt be having that, so he mixes it so it‚Äôs barely audible and basically this song blue balled me with 7 seconds of audio fuck u Guetta

**lilguavachan** (3): like who asked for some gangly 50something year old man to be out here making these tracks.

**enecks** (1): Off button outsold

**MrSwearword** (1): ugh jesus, gross

#Can't quit you

**lilguavachan** (11): i just love how soft, and gentle it is. it's so peaceful even if it's a song about ignoring red flags everywhere because sometimes dick makes you go crazy.

**yatcho** (11): I was shook when I frist heard this and realized it had completely flown under my radar for months. One of the most beautiful songs in the whole rate and Ariana is BELTING it out. Love the flute (?), it sounds so beautiful and so unique alongside the rest of the songs in this rate. There are better/more iconic songs here but I really need this to get its due as it's SO underrated

**enecks** (10): Ariana collab with SOPHIE next. For the record this is amazing. The production is stripped back to make Ariana carry the vocal weight. Bless her for that.

**MashLuke** (10): this is so emotional aaa, it's so good. I hate that I can't buy the album online, why Magnus?

**mms82** (10): Honestly might be my favorite Ari song- just such a beautiful moving on song

**PuggleMaster** (10): Stunning

**rotating3Dtext** (10): showing off her voice as always

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is the best Ariana Grande song that nobody talks about honestly

**marcryan** (9.5): Vocals are laying me to rest while my wig is shooting star.

**Chevsapher** (9.3): This is better than some of Ariana's solo singles! It sounds experimental in a good way, and the vocals are lovely.

**timothy444** (9.1): Okay, now this is what I want. It‚Äôs obviously a chill song but they make it very clear that it‚Äôs an electronic song with complements from Ariana. The relaxing instrumentation adds to the atmosphere to the song and I love that flute! I would definitely listen to this on the bus on a rainy day!

**diamondblaze413** (9): i love riding trains so much thank you video

**frogaranaman** (9): The lyrics of this song are like this: https://youtu.be/BKInDainD5M

**seralite** (9): first time i heard this song and love it

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.6): '' when i make songs, the environment is a young girl or boy listening in their room and just being alone '' honestly mood

**evilqueenlex** (8.5): This song is giving me so many emotions I just wish the hook was better. It's great, can't believe I never heard it until now.

**notdallin** (8.4): a shimmering, bouncy gem with a strategically placed f-bomb descending slowly from the heavens to grace the undeserving ears of r/popheads

**Brandon6099** (8): ariana slays, good bop, better than adore

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This is such a unique and interesting song. Ariana sounds great as usual and i really like the lyrics here. It feels more personal than usual for this kind of song.

**kappyko** (8): aaIIIIIIII its good

**Me-Luigi** (8): this is a siaserve

**MrSwearword** (8): the production is less wahey and Ariana's vocals are surprisingly subtle yet powerful but this is still missing something

**ramskick** (8): I very rarely want to quit listening to this song.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): do WHAT to the pain

**singularlegend** (7.5): it's cute

**Bendariaku89** (7): i thought this was an awful song at first, but then i relistened to adore which made me fall in love with that song so i thought i‚Äôd sort of see if that did it with this one, which it didn‚Äôt do as great as adore does, but it certainly made me like it once i accepted the production and started appreciating the entire song with it‚Äôs sort of dreamy state.

**camerinian** (7): I do like the reserved, quiet nature of this song. It works in the moment, even if I have little desire to return to it. ARIANA is stunning here though.

**jamesfog** (7): Sia snapped.

#They quit

**twat\_brained** (8): I can't quit popheads so I feel you, Ariana. I'm also definitely feeling CC's percussion on the drop. I'm not sure if this is just Ari being Ari but the verses, specifically the lyrical melody is pretty hard to follow along with. If I was feeling really shady I'd criticize the outro for being too long, but I feel like within the context of the song, it symbolizes a relationship going on longer than it should because the lovers are in too deep.

**1998tweety** (7.8): Most of the song is pretty standard but the EDM bit is meh, I've never been a huge fan of Cashmere Cat's style.

**tapdancingpig** (7.7): This is a pretty good song, but I can‚Äôt get over Ariana‚Äôs Sia impression. Like, the vowel‚Äôs are EXACTLY Sia‚Äôs vowels.

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): The drop is really pretty and dreamy but the lyrics are pretty lackluster and repetitive.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): From how much everybody was sharing this, I was expecting it to be a banger, but honestly I'm disappointed about how anti-climatic its hook is sorry Ari

**radiofan15** (7): Pete's ex-fiance sounds lovely here and you can sort-of understand her words... having said that, the drop is a dissapointment

**sbb618** (7): These weird atonal banging sounds in every chorus from this guy are really getting on my nerves.

**vulture\_couture** (7): cool. not super memorable but cashmere cat/ariana pair well

**xxrandooxx** (7): Ari, yall forget what the space bar is?

**ManofOranges** (6.5): Honestly this song is boring.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this is missing something even tho it's rly good on paper if that makes sense (it prob doesn't)

**monkeyattacks** (6): Not as good as their previous song but more enjoyable than 9.

**SinfulAnarchy** (6): Ariana sounds nice, but imo the beat sounds a bit too upbeat for what the song is supposed to represent.

**LandonKidatrea** (5): Ariana sounds very good here.

**vhqv1997** (4): I literally fell asleep during this song

**ImADudeDuh** (3): maybe I just don't like Cashmere Cat

**selegend** (3): I don‚Äôt like Cashmere Cat as an EDM producer tbh. Be My Baby & Adore >>>>>>>>>

**Johnnytoby** (1): ok but why isnt Trust Nobody on this rate I'm actually not happy but this "song" is? alrightalright

And so the underdog falls. Holder of the highest controversy score in any rate ever from its inclusion in the 2016 EP rate, it was an absolute blast to root for this here. The general perception of the song seems to have become more positive over the last couple years and that makes me really happy, because Closer definitely is THE anthem of the mid-2010s. It propelled Halsey to stardom, and now she has the #1 song in the United States, and that‚Äôs just one good part of it (halsey haters BEGONE). Every lyric in the song is quotable and the bleep-bloop drop is absolutely iconic. During the rating period, the song jumped all over the place, swaying between being out on Day 1 and Day 2 with each new score. Once, it found its way into the top 20 and I was praying that it could somehow stay there so that the haters would seethe :janet: But eventually, it stabilized at around #25, about halfway through the list of scores, and I think that‚Äôs apt for such a controversial song. 

---

#Hey.

**CarlieScion** (11): queen

**MashLuke** (11): I love this song so so so much. One of my first posts in /r/popheads was a Billboard article celebrating the Chainsmokers topping the Billboard hot 100. Seeing their rise to success was so crazy, this song has been on my most listened songs playlist of 2016/2017/2018 on Spotify. It's just perfect, I loved that summer.

**mms82** (11): My most played song of 2016, 2017, 2018, and a strong contender for 2019. Honestly pure pop perfection and my favorite song of all time

**radiofan15** (11): I wonder if the Blink-182 song they beat to death in Tucson is the same one Halsey sang in that mall

**1998tweety** (10): This song is gonna be snubbed so hard and I already know it. You guys need to not let overplay affect your overall opinion of a song. This song is such a summer song and is so nostalgic and so fun but at the same time bittersweet. The one thing I'm a bit lukewarm on is some of Halsey's weird lines but other than that its a super catchy fun song.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Gets waayyyy too much hate. I actually like how weirdly specific the lyrics are, gives it a bit of meaning instead of having another relationship song that could apply to any random person in the world.

**bloupp** (10): This song is amazing and y'all only hate it because it was overplayed.

**Brandon6099** (10): SO BABY PULL ME CLOSER, classic song, will bop to forever even in my 80's

**Chevsapher** (10): Haters gonna hate, but this song has an atmosphere all its own. In my mind, ‚ÄúCloser‚Äù is one of the defining songs of this decade.

**cyborglilith** (10): does not deserve the hate

**enecks** (10): This flawed masterpiece defines the decade almost as much as We Found Love. The flaws - some framing that kinda puts Halsey in a submissive desperate position. But the details and the drop - it's so 2016. Those three words are its appeal and its failing.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): CLOSER IS A BOP, Y'ALL ARE JUST MEAN AND BITTER ABOUT MATTRESS THEFT

**gannade** (10): halslay

**Johnnytoby** (10): it's a good song

**Leixander** (10): I like this song now but I used to hate it a lot. It is not good but really enjoyable, if that makes sense! (Also i want to see the score/controversy difference between the EP rate and this rate hah!)

**ManofOranges** (10): This song deserves to be up there in the rankings, like it or not, and that's that on that.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): overplayed, but still bops. excited to see the controversy score for this one, though

**piccprincess** (10): SOBABYPULLMECLOSERINTHEBACKSEATOFYOURROVERTHATIKNOWYOUCAN'TAFFORDBITETHATTATTOOONYOURSHOULDERPULLTHESHEETSRIGHTOFFTHECORNEROFTHEMATTRESSTHATYOUSTOLEFROMYOURROOMMATEBACKINBOULDERWEAIN'TEVERGETTINGOLDERDODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODODOWEAIN'TEVERGETTINGOLDER

**PuggleMaster** (10): this song takes back to when i was truly happy with my life so i can't really drag it

**selegend** (10): The haters are just jealous

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): imagine all the people that had sex to this lol

**strawberryswing1** (10): I remember I discovered this song before I started to visit r/popheads regularly. The first time I heard it I loved it and I put it on repeat for over an hour. Then I started visiting this sub and everyone talked about it like it's one of the worst songs ever so I felt ashamed for liking it. Now I know popheads has terrible taste and there's nothing to be ashamed of !

**tapdancingpig** (10): This will go out early BUT FUCK YOU, THIS SONG IS GOOD.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): If there‚Äôs one song on here that has a chance to rival the sheer impact of We Found Love, it‚Äôs fucking Closer. When I first heard this track in my college dorm room the night it dropped, I thought it was a pretty solid Chainsmokers track. The lyrics were snappy and the beat was really catchy. I had no idea I was listening to one of the defining songs of the decade, a megahit so pervasive the world would never be the same. And I feel the same as I did two years ago when I did the 2016 EP rate - this song is an absolute masterpiece. /u/The_Chainsmokers I love you and thank you for making the world a better place.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): memes lost

**timothy444** (10): I missed out on the EP rate but if I didn‚Äôt forget about that rate, I would‚Äôve given this a 10 just to mess with people. I mean, it‚Äôs cheesy but that‚Äôs the charm of it. It‚Äôs a love duet that can be taken as genuine even though they probably had ghostwriters writing this but I don‚Äôt care. The drop is relaxing, the voices complement each other and it‚Äôs still nice to listen to this occasionally when it pops up. The only reason why I‚Äôm not giving this an perfect eleven is because there are simply better songs that I enjoy more seriously.

**twat\_brained** (10): honestly fuck you guys I still wholeheartedly love this song 30 months after it came out. Halsey singlehandedly carries the entire song for me, and I'm not just saying that as a stana of hers. I felt an instant connection to it and when it went #1, I was overjoyed for her because I felt she deserves it. Two and a half years later, she hopefully has her second #1 single by the time we're revealing this rate. Even if she doesn't, I'm glad her only chart-topper is one of the most iconic songs of the decade.

**vhqv1997** (10): I'm giving it a 10 because I just know you would all try to sabotage it

**vulture\_couture** (10): I was tempted to give this one a 11 just because it's great and makes a lot of people angry for some reason. Great lyrics that tell a story, the bridge/chorus is great, the drop is awful but like in a relatable way that makes the song better.

**camerinian** (9.5): every rational part of my brain should loathe this awkward, chinsy little song, and I can't. That chorus is magical, the drop is like almost a cool off from the chorus but it works in its own right, the verses are weirdly written and delivered, and yet it's aching sincerity helps it overcome any sort of growing pains. I can't. This sing is great in spite of everything working against it.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I know this song was overplayed for a billion years, but I totally understand why this was so successful. It‚Äôs instantly catchy and follows a formula that works so well. It is a good song imo, but if I rated this song back when it was on the radio every hour, it would have definitely given it a lower score.

**notdallin** (9.3): The song we were all waiting to drop all summer in 2016. And when it finally did everyone realized how much they hated the Chainsmokers. But for one beautiful month, we didn‚Äôt question what it meant to bite that tattoo on her shoulder, or what‚Äôs so significant about Tucson and Boulder, or think about the length of the Chainsmoker‚Äôs dicks whenever we heard this song. No, we could all hear that chorus of ‚Äúwe ain‚Äôt ever getting older‚Äù and just let it run us through.

**marcryan** (9): I really love and hate and love and hate this song. Luckily during this rate i like it.

**sbb618** (8.8): You can't help but belt out this song when it comes on.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): a BIG grower that perfectly captures the nostalgia of late millennials / early gen z...i consider this the most iconic song of the decade for that reason

**xxrandooxx** (8.5): catchy as hell

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): SO BABY PULL ME CLOSER IN THE BACK SEAT OF YOUR ROVER THAT I KNOW YOU CAN‚ÄôT AFFORD BITE THAT TATTOO ON YOUR SHOULDER PULL THE SHEETS RIGHT OFF THE CORNER OF THE MATTRESS THAT YOU STOLE FROM YOUR ROOMMATE BACK IN BOULDER WE AIN‚ÄôT EVER GETTING OLDER

hikkaru: **frogaranaman** (8): This will literally define a year in our generation and I‚Äôm honestly okay with it.

**jamesfog** (8): This song aged like fine wine. We all know the lyrics too

**ramskick** (8): it's amazing that I have positive memories of this song despite the fact that it played so much it drove me CLOSER to insanity.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.5): THIS SONG IS NOT THAT BAD YOU GUYS ARE JUST MEAN

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): I reluctantly like this song. This song would be better if a male singer like Justin Bieber or Charlie Puth was singing the first half of this song.

**diamondblaze413** (7): took me three years to come around lmfao

**IeuanHa** (7): Hated when came out, grew to quite like

**SkyBlade79** (7): Underrated tbh, people just hate it because its popular

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Ok, I am not a big fan of this, but can we talk about how this is kinda the most iconic song of the last half of the decade? Like every lyric is quotable and memorable and it just really is known by everyone.

**Me-Luigi** (7): I don't know why but I start to laugh when this song comes on anywhere - it's a meme to me, glad Camila didn't end up on this

**seralite** (7): i think going a few months without hearing this one before now has made me generous

#The roommate that had their mattress stolen

**FireLordAegon** (6.5): This songs sounds like it was written by a first year music theory student. What is there is good, but I feel like the song is just too simplistic and repetitive.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6.5): This grew on me a LOT even if the synths sound like something I could've made in Garage Band and the guy can't sing for shit

**Bendariaku89** (6): this song is in middle of the road for me. i love it‚Äôs drop, but i know it‚Äôs a reworking of roses, which for me is better, but not by a lot. this song still sounds nice, even if it doesn‚Äôt pull the punches for me.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I joined the hate circlejerk when this first released because I thought Halsey sucked and I despised the idea of Mariah's record being beaten, but right about last year, when its reign on the charts had ceased for good, I began to think it was great. Now, I've come to the conclusion that it's just okay.

**kappyko** (5): it's cute but way too damn sparse

**LandonKidatrea** (4): Don't let this rate's results distract you from the fact that Todd in the Shadows named this song his Best Hit Song of 2016!

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (3): the whole song feels like it's building up to an explosive chorus that never happens and it makes my head hurt

**singularlegend** (3): it's ok....

**awryj** (2): i believe this is one of the songs the us army uses to torture their prisoners of war

**CritneySpearz** (2): Idk why but the chorus is grating to my ears, Halsey‚Äôs verse saves it from being a 0.

**lilguavachan** (2): i don't hate it as much as when it first came out but that doesn't mean it's good still

**bespectacIed** (1): What a hilariously bad and song. No amount of nostalgia or image overhaul for both halsey and the chainsmokers could make me like this.

**bbfan132** (0): no

**MrSwearword** (0): NO. GROSS. This shit still sucks all this time later.

**SinfulAnarchy** (0): this is the whitest shit ever.

I had a fun rate reveal to watch at work! Some tragedies like the middle leaving, but overall trash was going out today. 

That changed though. 

I forgot the popheads community is the most delusional and honestly fucking stupid community I‚Äôve ever witnessed. I forgot that despite being a pop music forum, they hate any music that‚Äôs remotely popular. The Chainsmokers are fucking gods, and this is how you treat them. Closer is one of the biggest songs EVER, so you guys can continue stanning trash like Sophie or Lorde, but Closer is actually successful and will be remembered for ages. It might have lost this rate, but it won in real life. I can only assume none of you have ever had someone ‚Äúpull you closer‚Äù since you‚Äôre all a bunch of loser virgins, but the fact that you repeatedly take fun events for the community and ruin them by trying to be DiFfErEnT but disliking popular things isn‚Äôt a personality trait. So go off and feel superior disliking one of the biggest songs of the decade, I‚Äôm going to allow myself to like one of the biggest bops of the decade that isn‚Äôt going to be going away for a LONG time

This is the only remix of a song in the rate, and I think it‚Äôs a good thing that not many get incredibly popular because usually they‚Äôre not as good as the actual song itself. A lot of people feel this way about Lana‚Äôs biggest hit and only top 10 entry on the Hot 100, but surprisingly, for the majority of the rating period, this was doing far better than #23. It spent most of the time in the top 10, and at one point was in the top 5! To me, this song is just Fine. Even disregarding the fact that the original may be better, the production feels a bit generic and uninteresting, and I personally probably would have had it out a few spots ago but I definitely think this spot is more fitting than the top 10 position it almost achieved before sinking like a rock.

---

#We love Lana's only top 10 song

**seralite** (11): even with cedric gingivitis butchering this song its still the best one. my QUEEN lana

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): honestly this entire song is too real especially w/ summer starting soon

**evilqueenlex** (10): The only song on this list that was successful in making a sad subject/song fun and danceable without diminishing its sadness.

**frogaranaman** (10): Lana Del Rey‚Äôs best song is a remix and that‚Äôs not even a meme at this point.

**gannade** (10): og is better of course but still goes off

**MashLuke** (10): not really a collab but this remix is fireeee.

**mms82** (10): I know this makes me a fake stan according to every other Lana Del Gay out there but I needed an EDM beat to fall into Lana Del Rey and this song was an amazing opener to her, and still one of her bests

**MrSwearword** (10): on one hand, this defines sleeper hit but on the other hand how the fuck is this still Lana's peak on the Hot 100?

**radiofan15** (10): WOW we stan this Grammy winning bop, which is her biggest success and only Top 10 hit

**selegend** (10): Iconic

**SinfulAnarchy** (10): really good. idk what else to say, I love Lana.

**SkyBlade79** (10): unpopular opinion but this is better than the original for me‚Ä¶ especially the buildup, matches her voice and delivery perfectly

**yatcho** (9.9): Taking .1 point to protest Lana's lack of Grammys

**sbb618** (9.5): It just works.

**jamesfog** (9): Kinda made Lana relevant

**Johnnytoby** (9): How did this become more popular than the original üëÄ the str8s never cease to disappoint me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The rare EDM remix of a sad song that improves it in every capacity

**notdallin** (8.9): the og version of this song is so good and absolutely iconic, it‚Äôs really too bad that it had to be club mixed in order to become popular. But I guess I shouldn‚Äôt complain. I mean we would probably be talking more about Lana Del Flop if it hadn‚Äôt been for this remix.

**Chevsapher** (8.8): I know this remix is infamous within Lana's fan community, but I legitimately enjoy it. It's well-crafted, although perhaps a bit too generic, and the drop is thoroughly engrossing.

**xxrandooxx** (8.8): the music video with the chicken in the red dress really makes this song!

**skargardin** (8.5): I mean it‚Äôs pretty good and sure, you bet im gonna dance my ass of to it if it comes on in the club but everytime I listen to it it makes me realize how much more I‚Äôd rather listen to the original.

**1998tweety** (8): Honestly this remix isn't bad, yeah it's a shame it's her highest charting song considering she has much better but that doesn't mean this is bad. Y'all are gonna drag it though cause you feel the need to.

**diamondblaze413** (8): cedric gervais is a blatant song stealer but it's a bop

**enecks** (8): This got Lana a hit lol

**FireLordAegon** (8): I'm just glad Lana has a top ten hit.

**marcryan** (8): I, too, have seasonal depression.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I used to like this better than the original God why was past me such a dummy

**ramskick** (8): I get summertime sadness when I realize it's not summer anymore.

**timothy444** (8): On the bright side, they did their best in making Lana Del Rey interesting, a feat that Lana herself can‚Äôt do herself.

**twat\_brained** (8): "so I have another song from the last record that someone remixed the shit out of". Remember when this video surfaced, and Cedric unfollowed her? ROFLMFAO. Well thankfully, for Lana, she's still out here making white California twentysomething girl indie, or whatever sonic palette Norman Fucking Rockwell turns out to be, meanwhile this nobody is probably living from paycheck to paycheck, going from obscure nightclub to obscure nightclub getting ad nauseum requests for this. Lana Del Rey is not an artist who needs dance club remixes. It's not even like I hate this remix, I'm actually kinda into it. I'm just not hearing artists like Lana getting musical treatments like this

#Seasonal depression

**Brandon6099** (7): love you lana but original version is better

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I love the original song, but the remix feels wrong.

**lilguavachan** (7): like... it's cute but i'd rather just listen to the original song

**Me-Luigi** (7): LanaEDM works quite well, but it still feels wrong because it's not meant like that

**rotating3Dtext** (7): whatever, man

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i‚Äôm not gay so this is the only good lana del rey song

**tapdancingpig** (7): I have aggressively mixed feelings about this remix. On the one hand, it did give Lana a pretty big hit, and it does have a lot of euphoria behind it, the right kind of euphoria for the song, exciting but kind of uncomfortable and miserable. On the other hand... I don‚Äôt know. We lost a lot of emotion from the old version, and we lost that amazing bridge.

**vulture\_couture** (7): this feels like it doesn't really belong here because it's a remix of a preexisting song but it had a life of its own so i guess. lana del rey fits into the whole "crying in the club" aesthetic really well so i'm still giving it a good score

**awryj** (6.5): cedric remix venice bitch challenge

**bbfan132** (6): this is the edm equivalent of calum scott‚Äôs rendition of dancing on my own

**CarlieScion** (6): oh look, its where the song peaked on the billboard charts

**InfernalSolstice** (6): not nearly as good as the OG

**vhqv1997** (5.5): 10 for the original song, 1 for the remix

**camerinian** (5): As much as I love the original, and as much as a lot of mainstream EDM does have melancholic undertones, there‚Äôs a level of cognitive dissonance to making an MDMA-popping, fist-pumping anthem out of something literally called ‚ÄúSummertime Sadness‚Äù that I don‚Äôt have the brain capacity to process

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): I can't believe this is the version that got big. It doesn't work at all for me.

**LandonKidatrea** (5): lmao

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): This remix is garbage. I'm giving it an extra point bc I discovered Lana through it tho.

**Bendariaku89** (4): i think i get lana del rey, at least what her style is. i‚Äôm sadly not born-at-heart oldie, so i can‚Äôt really get into the original as much as others could. this song doesn‚Äôt really make it any more listenable than it has. the original appeals to those whose tastes are in vintage vinyls and wine, while this tries to transform it into an edm song for the youth? doesn‚Äôt work the greatest, but it sort of takes it anyway which i can like a little.

**CreepyMannequin** (4): It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing Summertime Sadness?

**kappyko** (3): this really made no points and lana deserves better

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (3): this is homophobia

**bespectacIed** (1): This remix ruined a beautiful song. I hope that top 10 was worth it

**Leixander** (1): Words can't describe how much I hate this remix.

Aww, come on. I love this song so much - it might not be the deepest or the most interesting in terms of production but WHEW it slaps! That drop might just be the hardest in the entire rate. This is a staple of my running playlist for good reason! That being said, I can understand why some aren‚Äôt the biggest fan of it (though it‚Äôs really not THAT bad, come on kappy why the 0). At many points this was a bit lower so I‚Äôm happy it managed to worm its way towards the top 20 for the final results.

#You and me bleed the same light

**Chevsapher** (10): I've loved this song since the day it was released. Selena's vocals work surprisingly well against Zedd's walls of synths, and that euphoric drop is among the best in this rate.

**frogaranaman** (10): Zedd knows how to knock pop house straight out of the park, god damn. I wish he would go back to this style.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): Selena and EDM, name a more iconic combo

**gannade** (10): remember when they "dated" for 2 weeks

**Johnnytoby** (10): ugh another Selena classic

**selegend** (10): She looks gorgeous in the vid

**timothy444** (10): Punchy, bold and catchy are adjectives that aren‚Äôt usually what a describe a song with Selena Gomez but Zedd does a killer job making Selena sound exciting!

**diamondblaze413** (9.5): it's remarkable you can even get this close after you create perfection

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): An underrated Selena bop!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): zedd meeting selena because '' he had to pee '' is the fanfiction come to life we would post on r/thathappened in a heartbeat. Glad a good song came from it.

**jamesfog** (9): Lati K snapped

**marcryan** (9): Recently rediscovered how HARD this song goes

**Me-Luigi** (9): this is my fav zedd era

**ramskick** (9): I want Selena Gomez to know that I love her work with EDM producers.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): stream true colors

**awryj** (8.8): fun fact: i haven't heard this song since 2015 and i hated it back then. i have seen the light

**ManofOranges** (8.6): It sounds good but I just feel like it gets to a point where it begins to drag on or something along those lines. If it were maybe like 30 seconds shorter or something I think I'd like it more.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Again not a bad song but it pales to the other tracks in the rate.

**bbfan132** (8.2): this is giving me stars dance vibes and i‚Äôm LIVING

**Brandon6099** (8): classic zedd, bops hard, very catchy and selena slays once again

**evilqueenlex** (8): what does "you and me bleed the same light" mean? that doesn't sound stunning America.

**singularlegend** (8): lati k version better

**xxrandooxx** (8): good song

**notdallin** (7.9): Zedd‚Äôs songwriting process ca. 2012-2015: -get someone to send him a hook -get someone to write introspective lyrics -find eye candy to sing your song (alternatively your own girlfriend) -flesh out the ordinary pop song iNTO ‚àû-BIT CAP‚ÄôN FALCON N64 NOISES WITH BLASTS OF VOCODER REPEATING SOME OF THE WORDS SO THEY SOUND ROBOTIC AND STUFF

**sbb618** (7.5): There's some weird stuff going on in the breakdown.

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): a basic bop.

**bespectacIed** (7): Bop. Zedd and Selena were a cute couple lol


**MashLuke** (7): this is a nice song that does what it's supposed to. Remember when they dated? Crazy.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Tell me you're covered tonight, or telling lies? No, papa! Open your mouth Ah, ah, ah! Johny, Johny Yes, Papa? Eating sugar? No, papa! Telling lies? No, papa! Open your mouth Ah, ah, ah!

#Honey, it's raining tonight

**camerinian** (7): this song is frustrating because it's basically two really good songs that don't quite come together. The verses are actually pretty house-y, groovy, fun, and then the big room drop is built up quite well, but they just really don't mesh, and the lyrical content doesn't fit in to either side, really

**twat\_brained** (7): Four years later one of my biggest regrets is purchasing this on iTunes with leftover gift money when I could've purchased something better. I'm not sure what exactly I should've bought instead. In any case this is a forgettable cut from both artists' discography. I want you to know I have no intention of seeking out this song beyond this rate.

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): some good lyrics and some mega cringy lyrics

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I really do not like the vocal melody on this sorry

**MrSwearword** (5): really bland

**vulture\_couture** (5): this has no reason to exist and the world is not better for it existing

**radiofan15** (4.5): I've never heard this one before and I'm quite glad because I already forgot how it sounded

**Leixander** (4): Filler material.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): Remember this PR relationship yikes

**seralite** (4): ehhh

**Bendariaku89** (1): this doesn‚Äôt work as much as it wants to. like the hook sounds nice, but the production doesn‚Äôt really do much to build up or create anything interesting for that.

**enecks** (1): Seleep gomez

**kappyko** (0): What the hell? This is generic to a T. Zedd choke, selena stay away from him forever

Along with Wolves, this song grew on me the most during the rating period out of all 52 songs. When it was released I could not stand it and thought it was both boring and annoying, but now it‚Äôs a solid 8 in my opinion. I don‚Äôt think many dislike it that much (besides the two zeroes), but rather just find it to be an uninteresting 5/10. It does have its fans though, and they helped propel it to a near-top 20 position. Here‚Äôs hoping Dua‚Äôs future singles can see similar success to this one! 

---

#Fell in love with her

**awryj** (11): ‚Äãhttps://media.giphy.com/media/4QFdQMZjt3K5JF27og/giphy.gif

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): ok this song is good... but i've heard it before. Way too many times.

**enecks** (10): Yeah this slaps. Dua has the charisma, the house beat is good, yet it embraces the weird elements sanded off by lesser producers.

**FireLordAegon** (10): This song is just so... gay

**ImADudeDuh** (10): One WIG being gone is all it takes to fall in love with this song!

**Johnnytoby** (10): Deserves top 10 pls

**MrSwearword** (10): song >>>>>>>>>>>> video all day. The song is worth many listens.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Because I'm dehydrated for a house music revival

**piccprincess** (10): The music video sends me

**radiofan15** (10): A bouncy tropical BOP with awful live choreo from the Albanian queen ugh her mind

**Chevsapher** (9.5): I wish the chorus was more refined, but the dark 90s house vibes give the track incredible atmosphere.

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): Dua's lazy arm choreography to this song a la Tess Taylor from Camp Rock makes me laugh. This is still a great song but please do better choreo sis.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I love the house style of the song so much. It has such a mellow groove which works well with Dua‚Äôs voice. This one of the songs of this summer imo

**bbfan132** (9.4): i love uk garage music (stream flowers - sunship edit by sweet female attitude on spotify) <3

**camerinian** (9): This is a fantastic house song, but also after watching Kameron Michaels‚Äô Instagram story one too many times, I kind of also never want to hear it again. That bitch needs to find another song to lip-sync to online

**marcryan** (9): I‚Äôve played this song too much, but it still bops

**Me-Luigi** (9): this is so infectious, dua's vocal and the most slick production really did this

**singularlegend** (9): summer classic

**twat\_brained** (9): My personal 2018 song of the summer, even though I can and have heard better music from both individuals. I never expected anything groundbreaking to come out of their collab, but I consider myself rather amused at what a pleasant and serviceably illuminating tune Dua and Calvin managed to release during spring 2018. One of my top 20 songs of the year, no less! More importantly, can we talk about those papier mach√© insects or whatever those were called in the music video? Not sure what those are about but they're very colorful which I appreciated. It's just such a feel good song that just instantly boosts my mood and for that I love it immensely.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): I love this sound but the song is kind of basic

**1998tweety** (8.1): This is still pretty good but it loses its charm after a few listens.

**Bendariaku89** (8): they call this generic. and they‚Äôre right. BUT IT‚ÄôS TOO GOOD. calvin knows how to make a good beat even if it‚Äôs not that original or ‚ÄúEXPERIMENTAL‚Äù. sometimes i want just that even if i also like dark kinky experimental beats.

**Brandon6099** (8): disco pop dua slay

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I'm not super big like this as I was upon release; it's a great throwback to house music that Dua's deep voice is very suited for, but the 'one, one" refrain is super annoying. Still one of my favourite Calvin Harris songs, though.

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): a mellow, tropical, 80s house song. my only criticism is that there‚Äôs no moment where the song really soars; the peaks aren‚Äôt high enough for me to justify giving this a higher score.

**notdallin** (7.9): it‚Äôs funny that everyone was really underwhelmed by this song at first. I think it‚Äôs gotten a lot better with time, probably because it borrows more from house than EDM. I think it‚Äôs at least reached ‚Äòwhelmed‚Äô status, no? The Dua feature doesn‚Äôt hurt either ;)

**kappyko** (7): Okay this is great now one of the best drops ever

#Needs multiple kisses

**timothy444** (8): Chill track but nothing special that stands out when you take it from the surface. Then again, what else can you expect from a Dua Lipa song? It‚Äôs exactly what you see and what you‚Äôll get. Unfortunately, if you ignore Dua, then you can start to notice all the tiny details that Calvin created in the instrumental and it‚Äôs such a shame that he had to pick such a bland pop singer when it would‚Äôve been such a nice instrumental track.

**diamondblaze413** (7): pure house is not meant to be performed live regardless of who the singer is

**frogaranaman** (7): The H&M staff is trying their hardest to get me out of their store by playing faster and faster songs, but I will prevail. I will find the shirt I need. I will out-gay my classmate. I will come out the victor.

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): The song doesn't really go anywhere? The music is interesting, but the song is just sort of there

**jamesfog** (7): One of the most overplayed songs of 2018. But a bop

**LandonKidatrea** (7): i don't know why but this sounds like the background music of a fighting game stage to me.

**MashLuke** (7): as long as I enjoy this song, it's just nice. The whole vibe is nice but it is in no way anything sensational, just relaxing.

**ramskick** (7): ngl I don't think Dua Lipa is that attractive but this song has a super sexy confidence that makes her way hotter than she normally is.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): we love a watered down bop that was also somehow the most exciting dance pop song we got this year

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I‚Äôll admit I wasn‚Äôt very keen on this track when it came out but now I just bounce up and down like this when it comes on

**Leixander** (6): I am happy that this became a hit and helped dua but that's all.

**SkyBlade79** (6): nice and tropical but also kinda flat

**tapdancingpig** (6): This song is good for runways and nothing else.

**vulture\_couture** (6): See I want to love Dua Lipa but a lot of her output feels like soulless craftsmanship. I do enjoy the 90s house vibes though

**seralite** (5): dont really love this one

**vhqv1997** (4): I've seen better vocal performance from Sophia the robot

**golden\_bassnectar** (3): so bland I cry

**selegend** (1): Dreadfully boring

**IeuanHa** (0): This song feels really lacklustre, and like Dua's vocals are being wasted to me.

This song is really cute and I think the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs be lonely together‚Äù hook is adorably sad. It doesn‚Äôt really feel like one of Avicii‚Äôs songs (stuff like Wake Me Up), and I wish he‚Äôd collaborated more with women so that one of the greatest and most influential producers would have more representation in this rate, but this song is still really good and I‚Äôm glad it squeezed its way into the top 20. RIP

---

#RIP

**timothy444** (11): I rated this perfectly as a 10 in the Charity rate and one year later, it deserves an 11 because the genius behind it is unappreciated. Part of Avicii‚Äôs final EP, it showcases a one night stand similar to ‚ÄòStay The Night‚Äô but differentiates itself by using clever wordplay on the title by twisting it into different meanings. Heck, the genius page for this song explains how it uses four different figure of speeches just in two sentences but also, even the word ‚Äòlonely‚Äô is used differently in context. During the jaw-dropping drop, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs be Lonely Together‚Äô uses the word as something that Rita wants to happen while the second sentence of that is using ‚Äòlonely‚Äô as something that they want to avoid, or have less of. It‚Äôs pure poetry and is such as an underrated technique in this song that many people won‚Äôt appreciate. In terms of the instruments, it also is unique and catchy that you won‚Äôt be able to forget it. The wub sounds in the chorus get progressively louder and the chords are so memorable yet sad. It should feel like a sad song but it also feels more like a song for celebration. It‚Äôs mindboggling crazy and complex and yet so simple that even a five-year-old can have fun with it (despite the alcohol references).

**1998tweety** (10): A mega mega bop. Rita tends to belt on her tracks but her more restrained vocals suit this song well. Side note but Hot Right Now is a MEGA bop and should've been in this rate even though you guys would've robbed it.

**bespectacIed** (10): I only listened to Avicii after his death, and this is what I heard first. Love this so much.

**Chevsapher** (10): I wasn't a fan of Avicii's folk-EDM phase, but this song brought me back on board. It's moody, it's sleek, and the lyrics are quite relatable. RIP.

**frogaranaman** (10): God, what a startlingly brazen confession about addiction masqueraded as a love song. Rest easy, Tim, you goddamn son of a genius.

**Leixander** (10): This felt like a breath of fresh air and a throwback at the same time when I first heard it, such a lovely song.

**lilguavachan** (10): oh avicii... rest in peace, king.

**MashLuke** (10): Man this would get me so sad even before his death. Glad this exists, listen to the acoustic version it's so wrecking.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): man, i miss Avicii

**selegend** (10): I‚Äôm such a sucker for sad bops

**strawberryswing1** (10): u/letsallpoo won

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): RIP :(

**camerinian** (9): I was actually really saddened when Avicii passed, not because I liked much of his music. Gotta be honest, everything from Wake Me Up onwards kind of grated on me, thought it was pretty gimmicky. No, I was sad because this was the first song of his I truly loved, and I was actually excited for where he was going to go next. This is just a no bullshit damn good pop song with a really strong hook from Rita and a groovy drop, and while it‚Äôs nothing mind-blowing necessarily, it showed a degree of restraint that I thought was a good look for him. God damn it. Writing this out sucks, man.

**diamondblaze413** (9): :(

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): r.i.p. legend

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): RIP :(

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): the effect on her voice is huh

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): excellent songwriting and Rita sounds great, doesn't sound very Avicii tho

**tapdancingpig** (8.3): One of the better subdued drops in the rate. This is overall a really well constructed pop song, and Rita does a pretty great job with the vocals.

**notdallin** (8.1): this song makes me sad about Avicii :(

**Brandon6099** (8): rita bops, rip avicii ;(

**enecks** (8): RIP

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This barely sounds like Rita but it‚Äôs still a good song.

**jamesfog** (8): European bop

**Me-Luigi** (8): don't really like how the (dominating background) vocals are used in this, but it's kinda a bop, the acoustic version and live performances are way better tho (RIP Avicii) but love how he made a drop 2017-ready

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): rip Avicii

**singularlegend** (8): rip

**kappyko** (6.5): this is cute!

#Lonely

**awryj** (7.8): not a fan of the drop but the song itself is def not bad

**sbb618** (7.8): This honestly just makes me sad that "Levels" is a sample instead of an original vocal track and it's not in this rate

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): Damn this doesn't even sound like Rita Ora but unfortunately this song just isn't that memorable or special.

**yatcho** (7.5): I CANNOT believe this is the only Avicii song in this rate, the level of disrespect is too high! I dont care if Etta James isnt collabing, you can slap on a fake featuring like on Break Free. I dont want any more excuses!!!

**twat\_brained** (7.4): God, I really don't wanna be harsh out of respect for Tim following his suicide last April but I wish we were rating "Seek Bromance" or "I Could Be The One" instead. Rita plays to her strengths on this track but it feels like there's something left to be desired from both artists here. In any case this feels like a good placeholder for #26 or wherever.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): buy alone together on iTunes

**Johnnytoby** (7): a cute it ain't me imitator

**MrSwearword** (7): I don't see it for Rita Ora and I don't care if I ever do, but Avicii's production was rather kind of cute if a bit "obvious" for pop appeal.

**ramskick** (7): is Rita Ora ever lonely

**radiofan15** (6.7): I hate to say it because #RIPAvicci and stuff, but this is bland... I mean it's quite catchy but also really forgettable

**monkeyattacks** (6.5): RIP Avicii

**cyborglilith** (5): don't get the hype for Rita Ora

**marcryan** (5): I‚Äôm gay and lonely.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): This is, sadly, really average

**vulture\_couture** (5): forgettable. basic

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): It's a pretty boring song and Rita sounds oddly bananas and avocados here in a way I'm not a fan of

**Bendariaku89** (3.5): that drop‚Äôs great, but the rest of the song‚Äôs conflicting for me. i don‚Äôt like the shifty synth beat that drapes over the song like cake, but dry cake. no one likes dry cake. this is the song. like the frosting has some nice flavor, but the base just doesn‚Äôt taste great.

**SkyBlade79** (3): generic

**mich4725** (2): Sorry this is the worst Avicii pop track, and I wasn't a big fan of his poppier music to begin with

hikkaru: # #19: Zedd - Stay (feat. Alessia Cara)

This marked a bit of a new era for Zedd, where, with the changing landscape of the charts, he altered his style a bit in order to not sound as dated as his first two albums. Of course, he‚Äôs always had a thing for the clock ticking and vocoder effects, but they really feel present here because of the less abrasive and maximalist production. As the first single in this new era, people weren‚Äôt quite sick of it yet, and so Stay works very well and is quite the bop. His singles since do feel somewhat milquetoast, so I hope his upcoming collaboration with Katy Perry will be more interesting.

#Stay, stay, stay

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): the middle but good

**enecks** (10): This is such a tight tense track I love it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ugh, i wished my WIG stayed after hearing this song!

**kappyko** (10): alessia cara still remains a force to be reckoned with i don't care i've always loved her music and the general friendly air of it all. it's daya without pretense and with a wistful circa 2013 era. "stay" is urgent and necessary, making the act of simply NOT moving sound imperative. squelchy electronica be damned, this song is great.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song snapped.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): credit Banks next time bitches

**radiofan15** (10): I still heard this one on the radio and even if I was never the biggest of the fans I never get tired of it, mostly because it's technically speaking so well done and Alessia really shines in here...

**ramskick** (10): I want to stay somewhere where this is playing.

**notdallin** (9.9): the first taste we got of modern Zedd. This song single-handedly took Zedd from the electronic power burst DJ to one who was synonymous with clock ticking and vocoder chorus echoes. Maybe some of you think it wasn‚Äôt a great turn for him, but I think it was amazing evolution that took his production to the next level. Whether he continues to ascend from here I guess is up to him. But whatever you think of 2018 Zedd, this song stands as a milestone for him and it continues to affect over a year and a half later. The music video takes it to a-whole-nother level, where the lyrics transform a romantic sentiment of wanting someone to stay when they have the choice to begging someone to stay when they don‚Äôt.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): The mixing is godly, and the lyrics evoke a palpable atmosphere.

**jamesfog** (9): Alessia Flopra snapped

**MashLuke** (9): Alessia killed it and Zedd's clock noise is now a signature sound.

**Me-Luigi** (9): this didn't help alessia's comeback but did help zedd and lgbt talent sarah aarons

**singularlegend** (9): ugh classic

**timothy444** (9): All I can say is that the chord progression that takes place during the pre-chorus took me by surprise in a good way. It‚Äôs unique, clever and feels like an epic song that was sure to be the song of the Summer (which in my heart I believe it is). Alessia Cara serves justice on this track as well and her vocals really suit the atmosphere of this banger!

**vhqv1997** (9): All you had to do was stay. Had me in the palm of your hand. Then why you have to go and lock me out when I let you in

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Another good song that I like less because it was overplayed.

**marcryan** (8.5): God I could use some Rum and Cola

**Brandon6099** (8): representation of Zedd's recent discography, Alessia slays

**vulture\_couture** (8): Zedd is great with vocal effects. like here he managed to make Alessia Cara tolerable to me and that's a minor miracle

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): i want to hate on this but i can‚Äôt

**diamondblaze413** (7): it's the middle but the melody doesn't make me slowly die

#Go, go, go

**frogaranaman** (8): The lesser Zedd ‚ÄúStay‚Äù song.

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): A jam but its younger clone is better

**gannade** (8): really overplayed but ok

**MrSwearword** (8): it isn't bad but I mean, it's not begging for a replay here

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): It's good, but everything it does, The Middle does so much better.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I know The Middle is a carbon copy of this but at least the Middle has a GOOD chorus

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I love Taylor Swift - All You Had To Do Was Stay

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): remember when this was spammed to hell on the radio and then disappeared as soon as The Middle was released

**twat\_brained** (6.5): Wait so is that actually Alessia in the intro and not a sample of Banks' Poltergeist? This is like a prophecy to The Middle. After listening to Know-It-All for the 2015 Tumblr Rate, much of which I've forgotten, I don't know what to make of Alessia. This song isn‚Äôt helping matters either. In fact, my focus is directed towards Zedd, who had these absolute club-ready beats that turned a good night to a phenomenal night. For comparison, Clarity has 128 bpm. This barely clears 100. Zedd needs to pick it back up before time forgets him.

**evilqueenlex** (6): Too similar to "The Middle" which is obviously the superior song.

**selegend** (6): Probably gonna be his best song for a while

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): for some reason, this used to always play on my local radio station, and I HATED this song so I would always switch to a different channel that actually had taste.

**skargardin** (5): Zedd‚Äôs been on a decline for me quality-wise ever since this song

**Johnnytoby** (4): the Middle was better

**SkyBlade79** (4): unpopular opinion but the middle is better

**tapdancingpig** (4): The existence of The Middle makes this song look so much worse. The chorus is even lazier than The Middle‚Äôs, and Alessia Cara‚Äôs voice, as much as I like it, has a much less clear tone than Maren‚Äôs voice, and Maren‚Äôs fits this style much better.

**Bendariaku89** (3): originally this was much higher, but i have problems with its sort of boringness attached to it. it‚Äôs admittedly nice at first, but the production is sort of disjointed, cluttered, so more listens make you wish it was made by someone else. it‚Äôs a fine overall song, if you like that generic stuff (i‚Äôm normally fine with generic stuff, but i somehow not into this one.).

**camerinian** (2): I honestly don't know how anyone enjoyed this when it came out. That humming melody at the start is needlessly complex and whatever the opposite of atmospheric is, the pre chorus is the only spot when there's even remotely a groove, and the rest of the song is the audio equivalent of something literally falling flat on the concrete. Alessia Cara is super overrated too dont @ me

**yatcho** (2): Zedd adding clock noises is that sped up video of the girl checking out groceries like, damn ma is it that serious

This one is an absolute classic, being one of Calvin‚Äôs earliest hits. Despite that, it didn‚Äôt make day 3 in this rate, and I think that‚Äôs because it at times feels like it‚Äôs about as generic 2013-EDM-pop as anything in this rate gets. Still, it‚Äôs a real slapper and I love the vocal melody Ellie sings on the buildup to the drop. These two should collaborate again!

---

#I NEED IT

**Brandon6099** (10): classic EDM bop ellie and calvin slay together

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): another timeless classic

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): A bop where the drop fits the song and Ellie's vocals just perfectly

**MashLuke** (10): this is an EDM classic highkey. Calvin Harris was on fire between 2012 and 2013.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): probably the first Ellie Gouldong track i have ever heard and what ultimately got me into her

**PuggleMaster** (10): CLASSIC! Everything Ellie and Calvin make is pure magic!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): why can‚Äôt all music sound like this :(

**SkyBlade79** (10): a wonderful song, should be what most edm/pop aspires to be

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding could release a song that is just 4 minutes of moaning in British and I would in fact give it a 10

**timothy444** (10): Even after existing for six years, this song still holds up and hasn‚Äôt aged at all! I specifically love how as we revisit each chorus, the instrumental that accompanies it gets heavier and intense showing that hopelessness that Ellie is undertaking in the journey of receiving that love. I just love that escalation and it gives a sense that she doesn‚Äôt want it, she needs it!

**twat\_brained** (10): Wait was it 2012 or 2013 when this was big? Either way I enjoyed hearing this on the radio because have you heard Ellie's vocals? Total smash on this song. And Calvin's work here is just the stuff of greatness. Something else you guys should know: when I was still involved with the legalized child labor known as my high school show choir, I had to recreate a choreography to this song for that year's national team excerpted from the previous year. I barely knew the choreography at all and had to just learn on the fly from what everyone else was doing, and somehow, I made it work. It was also lit seeing Ellie perform this live in concert in London in 2014.

**1998tweety** (9.5): A mega bop, Ellie's vocals are a perfect fit for this track.

**tapdancingpig** (9.3): This song is my favorite Calvin song by a fairly wide margin.

**Chevsapher** (9): This was the first Ellie Gouling song I ever heard! The chimes in the production complement her vocals well, and the "bridge" is just ethereal.

**FireLordAegon** (9): My pretentious teenage ass was so proud of "discovering" this song months before it was a hit.

**jamesfog** (9): A bop, but I prefer Outside

**ManofOranges** (9): This is another good track my only issue is that Ellie's vocals just feel like they get drowned out sometimes and I just feel like they could be more powerful.

**ramskick** (8): there are times when I need Ellie Goulding's love too.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): oops that video. do you think they can watch it nowadays?

**singularlegend** (8): pop excellence

**SinfulAnarchy** (7.5): this is pretty cute.

#I don't need it...

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Ellie sounds good but just not a fan of the production with the song. It just seems kind of messy.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Does the title refer to what Taylor said when she signed her contract with Calvin?

**Johnnytoby** (7.2): cute bop but the drop is too noisy

**awryj** (7): luv you pre-2015 ellie but the production here aged kinda badly

**diamondblaze413** (7): ellie is an angel but production really does sound like 2013 huh

**evilqueenlex** (7): This song is legitimately TRIGGERING but I can't justify giving it a low score just because of a bad memory. And I did like it once so...but literally hearing that intro anywhere, anytime makes me panic lol.

**frogaranaman** (7): One peculiar trait about this song is that there really is no classic ‚Äúbuild-up‚Äù in the song, just going straight into the chorus ‚Äúdrop‚Äù instead. This is a representation of our generation‚Äôs desire for immediacy in everything. In this essay I wi

**kappyko** (7): wait i didnt remember this being so good wtf

**Leixander** (7): I like the cute video but the song didn't age well unlike their other collab

**MrSwearword** (7): fine for what it is, but why did this get released in the U.S. and not Bounce?

**mudkip1** (7): kinda overplayed

**seralite** (7): generic but still pretty good

**bbfan132** (6.5): https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEdv0cLIguZzafwac/giphy.gif

**Me-Luigi** (6.5): Ellie Goulding's voice is the most Ellie Goulding ever on this record but it aged a bit badly

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): I still like this but it hasn't aged that well

**vulture\_couture** (6): Calvin Harris/Ellie Goulding is just not a good combination. Okay I guess

**radiofan15** (5.5): I'm whelmed as much as Ellie's singing here

**selegend** (5): It‚Äôs okay, didn‚Äôt age too well for me

**xxrandooxx** (5): hey ellie goulding

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): this has not aged well

**enecks** (4): Todd In The Shadows used this song as an example of EDM at its most soulless - and where is the lie

**notdallin** (3.8): it kind of sucks that when people try and argue that early 2010s EDM wasn‚Äôt generic, vapid, and meaningless someone can just point to this song and shut everyone up

**camerinian** (3): God what a dour song. This doesn‚Äôt even remotely use Ellie‚Äôs best soul and dreamy traits, and instead we get this depressing, tonally confused, kinda shittily mixed slog. I like the intensity at least, but there‚Äôs absolutely nothing underlying it.

While Martin Garrix‚Äôs other song didn‚Äôt do so well in the rate, it was easy to see why - the drop was obnoxious and sounds a bit like seals screaming, and Bebe‚Äôs howling vocals aren‚Äôt a favourite for many. Remove those two aspects of Garrix‚Äôs production, and you‚Äôve got this! Dua sounds great (as she usually does) and sells the song very well, while Garrix dials back the obnoxiousness in the drop. My favourite part of this song is the buildup to the drop. I do prefer the less poppy more EDM tracks that go a bit harder in this rate, but this is still decent. 

---

#Coming up with these titles is really hard I was literally going to put "not scared" here why am I so uncreative

**frogaranaman** (10): I feel this cover art/music video aesthetic to my core.

**lilguavachan** (10): oh thank god, there is a light at the end of the tunnel of shit

**MashLuke** (10): Dua's voice is immaculate and the production is mildly emotional and addictive. Lovely.

**mms82** (10): Most heart-wrenching EDM song ever, Dua Lipa's peak

**singularlegend** (10): sounds amazing acoustic too

**twat\_brained** (10): Lyrically and thematically similar to "Quit", this song, which is already a bonus rate winner, mind you, is just brilliant. These two bring out the best in one another, and I truly hear a convincing desperation in Dua's voice that just pulls me in and never lets go, especially during her vocalizations during the final drop.

**vhqv1997** (10): This is one of the few times where Dua's voice doesn't sound like an automated message and it really elevates the song. I don't understand why she phones in it so much other times

**Chevsapher** (9.5): The theme is interesting, the drop is masterful, and Dua's tone just fascinates me.

**radiofan15** (9.2): Even if it was overplayed (I still got PTSD flashbacks with the drop in it) this is an undeaniable bop

**diamondblaze413** (9): live version had me legit trembling

**jamesfog** (9): Dua snapped

**Me-Luigi** (9): in the name of love, but more generic, dua did fine on this and it still bops

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This deserved to smash in America! smh

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): i love it when pop songs have sad undertones to them.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Bold of you, Dua Lipa, to assume I‚Äôm not perpetually scared of everything.

**marcryan** (8.9): Great message and drop

**tapdancingpig** (8.9): I‚Äôve come around to this song a lot since the Pop Girl Prophecy rate. The lyrics hit hard, the drop works, and while Dua Lipa slips into Bananies and Oivacadies territory a little, this is among her best vocal performances.

**notdallin** (8.8): how can you hate a bangin‚Äô EDM song when the hook they leave you off with is something as profound as ‚ÄúIs the only reason you're holding me tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely?‚Äù

**1998tweety** (8.6): This is ok, I mean its not an awful song but its also not a huge standout compared to the other tracks in this rate.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): In The Name of Love (feat. Dua Lipa)

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.2): mood tbh

**Bendariaku89** (8): i think the songs is a little too spaced out that it feels off, but it‚Äôs still a great song regardless.

**LandonKidatrea** (8): The best of the Dua Lipa features in this rate. She sounds fantastic here. Also when she performed this song at her concert, during the drop she started headbanging like crazy on stage and I was SHOOK.

**ramskick** (8): I hope Dua Lipa is never scared to be lonely

**rotating3Dtext** (8): overplayed, but good

**selegend** (8): Dua‚Äôs voice works much better for this sound

#Scared

**bespectacIed** (8): Cute but the miguel x dua collab is better

**Brandon6099** (8): ITNOL 2.0 but not as good srry dua

**awryj** (7): pretty but repetitive

**enecks** (7): A try

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): The strings are a nice addition to this almost ballad, but I'm not big on the drop.

**kappyko** (7): Ehhhh

**ManofOranges** (7): I really don't see the hype behind this song.

**xxrandooxx** (7): p good

**timothy444** (6.5): I literally can‚Äôt tell the difference between this song and In The Name of Love and they might as well be the same song. It's just really bland and uninspired.

**camerinian** (6): this writing and Dua as a whole deserves such a better song than this. The drop is once again totally grooveless, adds nothing to the song, and doesn't really complement Dua's performance, which is fucking excellent from every angle.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (6): Lowered one point bc he really had the nerve to release the same song 3 times in a row

**evilqueenlex** (5): Do people seriously dance to this? Like in a club setting? It seems too slow for that.

**seralite** (5): meaty oaker...

**vulture\_couture** (4): i have come to the conclusion that martin garrix just isn't good at this kind of thing

**SkyBlade79** (3.5): vapid

**MrSwearword** (1): still don't like this song one bit.

For the final cut of the day we have the second Ellie/Calvin collaboration, and the one that popheads likes more! I think I personally prefer I Need Your Love, but both are really good. This one features a drop made of some sort of strings, which is pretty cool and definitely lets it stand out from the crowd a little bit, while I Need Your Love falls short in that regard because it sounds a bit basic. I think this is a really good spot for Outside - while it is a good song, the top 15 are all just on that next level that sets them apart from everything else in the rate. 

---

#Outside

**LandonKidatrea** (11): I fucking love this song. Probably the best Calvin Harris song I've ever heard. And I REALLY wanted to write this long ass essay explaining what I love about this song. But words elude me. This song sounds amazing. Ellie sounds amazing. The strings sound amazing. And every element of the song works SO WELL TOGETHER.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): there are too many good songs in this rate how am i supposed to choose my 11

**cyborglilith** (10): yes

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song does not get old for me. It‚Äôs such an ear worm and everything works so well together.

**Leixander** (10): The strings in the chorus are amazing.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): The best of the Calvin/Ellie collabs, still blows me away like the first time I heard it

**PuggleMaster** (10): pure magic

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i just realized this is i need your love part 2 @ellie part 3 when???

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I will let you in on a secret from my adolescence - I have played this song 468 times in iTunes. It is not the most played track on this album.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Her voice, the strings, the drop... it all works together so well.

**1998tweety** (9): Ellie's voice is so so good with EDM production.

**Bendariaku89** (9): that violin drop is sooooo good, while that melody is strung along with entire song in the background.

**diamondblaze413** (9): first song in my ancient playlist lol

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): The build up in the chorus to the drop is hype af, but the song is a little bit drop-centric

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): A very nostalgic song for me (yes, I can call this a nostalgic song, it's almost five years old). It played on my local radio for mysteriously  often amounts of time, and I knew Ellie's accent complemented the excellent production perfectly even when I was thirteen and dumb.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): so much energy

**timothy444** (8.8): Outside serves as the sequel to I Need Your Love and even though it can‚Äôt pass the extremely high bar that their last collaboration set for this piece, it‚Äôs still a great masterpiece that signifies the already broken relationship and the instrumental compliments that with a drop that presents itself as the thesis of consequence rather than the craving fix of pure ecstasy.

**tapdancingpig** (8.7): Ellie and Calvin are the fucking DREAM TEAM (when it comes to music, at least).

**sbb618** (8.5): Calvin Harris songs have this weird quality where for the first part, you forget that you've ever heard this song before, but when the chorus kicks in, everything comes rushing back.

**enecks** (8): Something about this EDM violin makes me moist

**frogaranaman** (8): My 14 year old gay ass that was never in a relationship bopping to this song daily: https://i.imgur.com/zxJxNhW.jpg

**seralite** (8): luv this one

**marcryan** (8): But what does it feel like on the Inside?

**ramskick** (8): has Ellie Goulding ever been on the outside of anything?

**SinfulAnarchy** (8): Ellie‚Äôs vulnerable vocals are a perfect match for the synths underneath. overall, a great song.

**xxrandooxx** (7.8): good

**selegend** (7): Motion is so underrated tbh. Pray to God slays too.

#Inside

**SkyBlade79** (8): gets a bit repetitive but still good

**unovachamp** (8): Probably unpopular opinion but this >> Need Your Love, the orchestra has me shook

**vhqv1997** (8): This is definitely not a bad song, but I hate how the chorus is so repetitive

**Johnnytoby** (8): the drop is also a little too noisy for me

**awryj** (7.5): I've always liked this song even though the detuned distorted strings in the drop are a CHOICE

**twat\_brained** (7.2): For how great "I Need Your Love" was, lightning sadly did not strike twice for Ellie and Calvin here. The main riff which the song is built upon isn't necessarily bad, it just doesn't feel like it's completely there in terms of song structure. And for how often said riff is repeated, it's a shame this doesn't live up to INYL's quality. I could see this roughly within the top 25, but no higher than #20. Or even #21.

**Brandon6099** (7): duo bops but not as good as I Need Your Love

**piccprincess** (7): I didn't know what I would find When I went looking for a reason, I know I didn't read between the lines And, baby, I've got nowhere to go I tried to take the road less traveled by But nothing seems to work the first few times Am I right? So how can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you, this ain't the best view On the outside looking in I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside You saw me there, but never knew I would give it all up to be A part of this, a part of you And now it's all too late so you see You could've helped if you had wanted toBut no one notices until it's too Late to do anything So how can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you, this ain't the best view On the outside looking in I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside So how can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you, this ain't the best view On the outside looking in I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside

**notdallin** (6.6): oh nO THEY‚ÄôRE BACK FOR ANOTHER ONE https://imgur.com/a/k9XXuEu

**MashLuke** (6.5): not really a fan of the drop, I'd still sing this out loud if played in a club but that's about it.

**bbfan132** (6.3): #elliegouldingreleaseanexcitingedmsongchallenge

**Me-Luigi** (6): Ellie's voice is a bit less Ellie on this, but I feel like this is more forgetable than INYL

**evilqueenlex** (5.5): Another song I never heard in its entirety until now and still don't like. I give it points for being catchy though.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): the drop is more grating than i remember

**camerinian** (5): This has all the same problems as I Need Your Love, but at least this time Ellie is allowed to put a bit more passion and dynamics in to her performance. Still, dour, glum, unsure what the appeal is tbh.

**vulture\_couture** (5): I've listened to this too many times to still not remember what it sounds like.

**lilguavachan** (4): the more i hear this song, the more i just don't... care for it. i think it's the drop, it just sounds so... screechy and unpleasant.

**singularlegend** (4): forgettable

**radiofan15** (3.8): Calvin give Ellie a song of her talent in which she doesn't sound like half asleep while singing, do that challenge

**kappyko** (3): this is kinda painful?

**MrSwearword** (1): oh god no, what is this Swedish House Mafia impersonation? UGH thank God Calvin has better material.
