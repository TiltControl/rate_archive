The Emo Rate 1.5 Day 2 - Ready To Go (Get Me Out Of This Rate)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ivxfm8/the_emo_rate_15_day_2_ready_to_go_get_me_out_of/

Hola, mis amores! 

Welcome to second day of the emo rate 1.5 (well, it's actually the third one, but branding^^^TM ) reveal. We are all living proof that it was actually not just a PHASE MOM. 

Today's reveal will begin at **3PM EST**, where songs #30 to 16 will be brutally murdered by a gang of tasteless e-boys, e-girls and e-people. [Come join us in the **plug.dj**, where we will be listening to these bops as they go out!](https://plug.dj/popheads/)

Some stats and fun facts before the show gets on the road:

* 77 people did the rate! That's one whole more person than my previously hosted rate - the Charity Rate. We like nostalgic pop punk more than community-chosen songs 4 charity!

* The average score is 7.620, so y'all actually think most of these songs pretty good!

* On the other side, the average controversy is 1.868, so any songs with higher controversy than this should be considered highly controversial.

* u/CarlieScion got a job offer today and we love her for it! Stream Halsey in her honour!

* I got Super Mario 3D All Stars but haven't played it yet AMA

**Mysario** (8): I'm a sucker for the "very quiet verse - loud chorus - slightly louder than the first verse but still quiet second verse - loud chorus - holding vocal notes in the bridge - quiet chorus - loud chorus" format.

**CarlieScion** (7): The instrumental in this is so gorgeous, especially the soft string intro. However, the lyrics are kinda peak Panic! - aka pretentious/nonsensical. 'Let me save you / Hold this rope' was definetly someones Myspace or MSN status at some point.

---

####**If you have to ask, you can't afford it**

**grinchelda** (10): what exactly is the exchange rate of mistakes for sheep

####**Slept like Princess Aurora**

**jolteonhoodie** (10): I wish I had more 11s to give because this song really deserves it

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the best song on the album yup!

**pig-serpent** (10): I really don't know how to describe how perfect this song is but there's a lot of subtle guitar work that goes unnoticed on this song, so please go back and notice it.

**poptartchill** (10): This is my favorite track from Vices and Virtues. I really love the musical build up to the chorus, the strings, the lyrics, and the concept as a whole.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): In my head this always had a MV that was kinda like the Jonas Brothers Lovebug one

**Verdantshade** (10): one of my favourite vocal performances from brendon... the melodies ('let me save you, hold this rope'), the high notes of the chorus, what a song

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): this is the best song on the album excluding bittersweet

**conceptualromance** (9.9): going to forgive some of these lyrics because the chorus and bridge melodies are just so good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): strong haunted house vibes on this one. so sexy

**fadedblue09** (8.3): The first song on the album that I'm sold on.

**kirby31200** (8): I love the strings on this one.

**twat\_brained** (8): I love how solemn this sounds

**1998tweety** (7.5): this bops but why does he scream so much

**modulum83** (7.5): an average adult contemporary pop rock song with excellent lyrics

**duhchappers** (7): definitely not one of my favorites on the album but it’s got a good chorus and bridge so I’m not mad it’s here

**milkywayinradius** (7): were they looking at my Robinhood

####**Traded for too much sheep and now can't build a road**

**intheaftermath** (6): the lack of Ryan Ross really shows here. It feels like Hurricane and Memories’ little sibling, who has a little less confidence and significantly worse lyrics.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): a little too filler-ish

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I’m not sure how I feel about this song. I kinda get the message of it, but the lyrics and structure kinda make things confusing

**anothertown** (5): Filler

**seanderlust\_** (5): Genius.com analysis: "While some critics dismissed the lyrics as being generic of young love, the lyrics at least make sense" i'll take accidental reads for 400, alex.

**ktajlili** (4): putting this song on record = mistake. I’d trade it any day for New Perspective.

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): this song sounds like it should have been in a depression medication commercial

**CarlieScion** (10): I love this little 3-minute story packed into a song. This is the definition of bittersweet, both beautiful and sad. It's also really sad that it ends up here, nearly going out on Day 1! Tasteless, all of you.

**Mysario** (7.5): This song is incredibly sad wtf! I did my scores probably by the second day so I don't remember why I gave this a 7.5 at the time, it's better than that! But the rest of y'all on average apparently agree with the 7.5. The whole song is pretty over the top from the lyrics to how hard it finds itself going. My biggest gripe with it is in my understanding, Brendon tried to emulate Billy Joel's 7 minute epic "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant" both sonically and lyrically. Sir, this is a pop song.

---

####**Y'all don't know me if you didn't know my choice is Midnight Memories!!! - u/CarlieScion**

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Charlotte IS2G if you shitpost Maroon 5

####**"Memories" by David Guetta and Kid Cudi**

**duhchappers** (11): I can't really put into words what makes this song so perfect, but every single element works together in perfect harmony and I will never get tired of it.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I'm a sucker for songs that tell a story like a narrator in a play, which this song totally does. Plus the gorgeous instrumental

**skargardin** (10): I cry

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): just a classic tune

**Verdantshade** (10): the storytelling reminds me a bit of death cab's death of an interior decorator but yeah this is a really pretty song

**grinchelda** (9.7): the instrumental chorus though

**pig-serpent** (9): The verses of this song are so bubbly and sweet, but the Chorus just doesn't quite hit it

**rickikardashian** (8.5): here i am, once again, im torn into pieces

**1998tweety** (8): shes alright

**anothertown** (8): Woof that intro just ripped me back to some indiscriminate summer time. So many of these songs are so sunny and don’t fit the visuals.

**modulum83** (7.5): this is the kind of song a theater kid would love - a super melodramatically sad story with obnoxiously thesaurus-worshipping vocabulary (and a Streetcar Named Desire reference!)

**poptartchill** (7.5): I think certain parts of this song are absolutely excellent, especially some of Brendon's delivery, but other parts are just fine to me. I still like it overall though.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): better than the other song named memories

####**"Memories" by Weezer**

**bbfan132** (7): overcompressed but still pretty good!

**fadedblue09** (7): Loving the more subdued pop-punk sound here, but wow the lyrics are just unnecessarily melodramatic. Stick to writing stories that are within your reach, please.

**kirby31200** (7): I really like that this is just a mundane realistic love story but I don't think it stands out sonically

**Leixander** (7): i thought it was going somewhere incredible but the chorus kinda sucked

**jolteonhoodie** (6.5): I don't know it just doesn't do anything for me

**DraculaWeekend** (6): Too cheesy

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Brendon definitely tried to make his own narrative song here… but I don’t know if he had it in him. The lyrics aren’t as detailed or poetic as they could have been. Basically it’s no last great american dynasty lmao

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): not feeling this one, it’s just kind of boring

**conceptualromance** (5): wants to be The Killers so bad

**milkywayinradius** (5): kind of typical and cheesy, but does have nostalgia vibes

**seanderlust\_** (5): I swear to god this isn't entirely a read, but the best part of this song are the violin sixteenth notes at the end

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.7): i literally just listened to this song and already forgot what it sounds like

**waluigiest** (4): I think the writing here is offensively bad. The song is pleasant but the one liners are corny and terrible

####**"Memories" by Maroon 5**

**bespectacIed** (3): Cheeseball. The strings at the bridge were a cute touch though

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): this song sounds like it should have been in a car commercial

**Mysario** (9.5): Made after the Farro brothers split from the Hayley William's Project, this song is basically a public response saying "heck you" to them. It's a good song that bridges the gap between the band's albums, losing a lot of the crunch and edge the band once had with one last hurrah to that sound. It's nothing special admittedly and if it was thrown out on an album, it would 100% be considered filler. However, at the time when it dropped, it was such a nice and welcome surprise that I can't NOT give this a high score! But why it ever made it on the Transformers movie soundtrack is still a mystery. I think executives heard "Decode" and were like "hey let's get that in our giant robot movie!"

---

####**AUTOBOTS, ROLL OUT!**

**1998tweety** (10): big bop

**agentofscranton** (10): the only redeeming aspect of the transformers franchise

**bespectacIed** (10): the only good thing that came out of the Transformers franchise after megan fox left

**jackisboredtoday** (10): godddd i listened to this daily in 2010 and its still one of my favorite Paramore songs ever… so good it makes the awful Michael Bay Transformers franchise worth it

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): my two highest paramore scores going to this and decode...when it’s right it’s right!

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this bop was in a TRANSFORMERS MOVIE?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): post-grunge paramore is something that i need much more of, you can’t give us just one song

**twat\_brained** (9.4): EXCELLENT video AND message! this is the perfect emo star-crossed lovers ship video song

**jolteonhoodie** (9): The Transformers movies are terrible but they did always have great soundtrack songs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.2): another song where i try and fail miserably to match the vocals

**ImADudeDuh** (8): China Anne Mcclain remains completely unbothered

**seanderlust\_** (8): Total aside - for anyone who likes this, check out the rest of their Singles Club EP. Four extremely solid tracks.

**bbfan132** (7.5): it’s good but there’s nothing that pushes it over the edge for me

**intheaftermath** (7.5): the little riff at the beginning is killer, but the chorus seems a little forgettable.

####**DECEPTICONS, RETREAT!**

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this one never really clicked with me tbh

**kirby31200** (7): I think the verses are better than the chorus, which to me was a consistent problem with pre-self titled Paramore. This song definitely does improve for me after learning the context and meaning

**pig-serpent** (7): This one just feels kinda off, and the Chorus doesn't hit properly. I still lilke it, but it feels like it should be better.

**skargardin** (7): Kinda average as far as their singles go

**modulum83** (5.5): "i've got a skeleton in me" oh word?

**conceptualromance** (4): I pretend I do not see it

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Never heard this before… meh. I kinda wish the chorus was as lively as the rest of the song

**fadedblue09** (3.5): What is the worst song on The Singles Club EP doing here? hmmmm

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): forgettable

**Mysario** (8.5): This is just a combination of all the other filler songs on the album while trying to emulate "Born for This" vibes at points. I like the filler songs so fine by me!

**CarlieScion** (8): Fillery, but cute! I get 'NO ONE IS AS LUCKY AS US' stuck in my head atleast twice a day. And 'Give me attention / I need it now' is a big mood.

---

####**Disney Channel's "Luck of the Irish"**

**bespectacIed** (10): Like Looking Up, an uncharacteristically positive Paramore song that I love so much. This song just makes me feel like the happiest person in the world. The hook "no one is as lucky as us" sounds like a warm hug. And as a worshiper of twee, the twinkly touches in this song make me so damn emotional ... i love the only twee-punk song ever (parquet courts is shaking)

**fadedblue09** (10): My underrated fave on this album. Every angsty album needs its optimistic breather somewhere.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i love this a lot, it’s such a feel-good song

**twat\_brained** (9.5): me drawing Cartesian Planes lol

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): nothing much to say except i love this song

**Verdantshade** (9): I always forget that brand new eyes has actual happy, upbeat songs, but here it is. I feel the album is so tied to anger and frustration, but having this and looking up make the contrast much more stark with the rest of the album, yet they fit perfectly

**modulum83** (8.5): i continue to be a sucker for pure happy songs (+.5 points for the little bells at the end)

**grinchelda** (8): simple but sweet

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): weird flex but ok

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Truly, dare I say it? A bop. Definitely one of the more fun-sounding songs on the album, which I enjoy!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): ironically the song that caught my attention again just as some of the songs on this album were starting to overlap

**conceptualromance** (7): I like the keyboard at the end

**jolteonhoodie** (7): The last three songs on this album have all just blended together for me honestly

**pig-serpent** (7): It's not a bad song but it sounds tired.

**poptartchill** (7): I like this one and I feel like it could've been a good closer tbh?

**rickikardashian** (7): this is looking up: the sequel

####**Nickelodeon's "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"**

**1998tweety** (6.5): im getting bored

**duhchappers** (6): Not sure if this song is worse than those before it or if I’m just sick of the same style used over and over again

**ignitethephoenix** (6): having another generic rock song this far in just does not work well

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): it just barely works, though

**seanderlust\_** (6): Of the two "happy" songs on this album, I think this one is my favorite. That being said, it's fun but it's not a highlight for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this definitely gives me “if i smile with my teeth, i think you’ll believe me” on the bridge

**CarlieScion** (10): This is one of my favorite Panic!-songs - it was an option for my 11. The production, instrumental, vocals and lyrics all just makes me feel giddy. I don't even mind the elevator music outro, it all just adds to the great ~vibe~

**Mysario** (7.5): This song is fine. When even Brendon wasn't too sure on what this song meant at first kind of screams "filler". Also bin this ending. It's no bathroom singing by Patrick Stump but it sure is out of place when I'm not in a lounge.

---

####**Enjoying the 104 days of Summer Vacation**

**conceptualromance** (10): bop and a half

**grinchelda** (10): the epitome of ryden bait

**poptartchill** (10): If something had to come out of the band's split at least this song did. Special thank you to Pete Wentz for giving us some of the best lyrics.

**sandyfishnets** (10): I swear I rated this a nine at first and then the funky elevator music at 3:36 got me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): that slight key change in the final chorus resurrected me

**modulum83** (9.5): epic, all-encompassing, life-affirming, and brilliantly written, and the production is beautiful.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I guess the outro to this song is a continuation of the one on Hurricane, kinda like a Jazz Club? It's a cozy vibe but I wish it'd just been an interlude, much like the first one

**TiltControls** (9.5): great song, but whyyyyyy the elevator music at the end

**fadedblue09** (8.7): Ah, so this is one of those backloaded albums.

**ggal2020** (8.3): throam. iykyk.

**bespectacIed** (8): this is actually quite beautiful, but what is that porno music outro that lasts a minute and a half

**intheaftermath** (8): I don’t know why I love “summer’s on its deathbed” so much.

**kirby31200** (8): Most underrated song on the standard version. The interlude following it kinda knocks the song down a point for me, I don't think it's bad but it doesn't mesh well with Sarah Smiles so it's kind of pointless to me. This is the most eerie song on the record, the repeated "only for you" at the end and the percussion just come out really creepy and I love it. And god the strings at the beginning of the bridge. For a long time I considered this my favorite Panic song

**pig-serpent** (8): A nice song that has both energy and a wholesome undervibe.

**twat\_brained** (8): would've been a 10 if the bossa nova outro was given its own interlude track

**bbfan132** (7.5): one of the best songs so far based off of melody/production

**ktajlili** (7.5): just for the line "put another ex on the calendar"

**1998tweety** (7): the gag when the outro is the best part

**cremeebrulee** (7): wtf is that elevator music at the end lmaooooo

**DraculaWeekend** (7): The outro reminds me of Sublime's "Summertime."

**duhchappers** (7): I like it but it doesn’t have much to make it feel unique in itself

**rickikardashian** (7): explain to me the minute and a half where it feels like im on a waitlist

**Verdantshade** (7): if I'm being honest I couldn't remember how this song sounded at all, and I know every word of every other song on the album. I deducted a point for that useless outro

####**Forgot your best friends birthday**

**CritneySpearz** (6.5): lmao what is the last minute…

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): idk why dig the jazzy outro but I do

**seanderlust\_** (6): The last minute of this song..."your call is very important to us. Please stay on the line, and Sarah Smiles will be with you shortly."

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.2): the last minute of this with the instrumental part is the only interesting bit of the song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why is there a full ass ringtone at the beginning and end of this song

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): “When I came back it was more of a relapse” hey you stole that from Fall Out Boy! Anyways I think all the metaphors kinda get in the way of the meaning of the song, which is the exact OPPOSITE of what metaphors should be doing... hey wait… you also stole that from Fall Out Boy!

**CarlieScion** (10): The verses here are so melodically pleasing to me! The wordplay is really clever, even though it apparently was born out of them not being allowed to name the song America's Sweethearts because of copyright 💀

**Mysario** (9.5): we do be loving our celebrities, just look at stan Twitter! So yea, let’s hear it for “America’s Suiteharts”!

---

####**Canada's Wonderland**

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): after incessant debating with myself, i decided to go left field and NOT give my 11 to Brand New Eyes aka one of my top 5 albums of all time, but instead give it to the song that has consistently been my favourite FOB

**bespectacIed** (10): "Why won't the world world revolve around me" omfggg same complaint. My favorite FOB song. That fucking chorus, chef's kiss. The best chorus of the entire rate, possibly of the entire pop-punk genre. The way patrick drags the "sins" in "i'm in love with my own siiiiiiins" makes me ascend to a higher dimension. My 11 in the rate if paramore wasn't here

**sandyfishnets** (10): yassss this is pure emo babeh

**grinchelda** (9.6): the ending mwah

**twat\_brained** (9): "suite"hearts? like escorts who work in hotel suites? big ups to sex-worker positive Fall Out Boy

**Verdantshade** (9): a reminder of the days when fall out boy could write catchy songs without being obnoxious (centuries...)

**fifteensunflwrs** (8): i love how it supposed to be "america's sweethearts" but it was already copyrighted

**ktajlili** (8): Favorite line I don't know much about cLAaaAasic cars But I got a lot of friend stuck on cLAasic coke

**modulum83** (7.7): gotta love how the band goes all out on this one although the rhythm is a bit plodding

**1998tweety** (7.5): alright

**bbfan132** (7.5): not as great as the songs before it but still good!

**fadedblue09** (7.4): Once again, Patrick's voice saves this song from being a total dreck.

####**New Jersey's Motel 6**

**conceptualromance** (7): they picked some of the weakest songs on the album to be singles smh

**duhchappers** (6): I can't tell what this song is supposed to make me feel. Like I assume its sarcastic but that just feels kinda empty. Idk its fine but I feel like I'm missing something

**ignitethephoenix** (6): for some reason this song is grating

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ehh I’ve never liked this song that much… Nothing wrong with it, I just think there are more interesting songs on the album

**anothertown** (5): arena rock is done better elsewhere on this album, the mixing is so off, and the subject matter of “Beautiful Young Fake Women in Hollywood” is ugly. I liked pete’s writing better on the previous album when it was all about “I am a beautiful young fake femboy in Hollywood”

**seanderlust\_** (5): I like the tempo shakeup form the prior three songs, but it just isn't very compelling.

**jolteonhoodie** (4): This is the worst song on the album by a mile

**pig-serpent** (4): The intro of this song is too cool to be wasted on a song this bad.

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): the vocals are a bit strained and a little annoying

**CarlieScion** (10): Oh god, this was the first ever Panic! song I heard. And yes, I found it in a fucking Pepsi-commercial. This song deserves SO MUCH better what the actual fuck. At some point this was among the first songs out - it had to climb its way up here. I for sure thought this was a guaranteed Day 3-song, given it's possibly the most poppy song in the entire rate. But I think most of y'all subscribe to the 'this is Panic!'s sellout song'-theory. For shame.

**Mysario** (9): y’all want a pepsi

---

####**Kendall Jenner and you**

**CritneySpearz** (11): a bop, screaming the lyric GET ME OUT OF MY MIND is very therapeutic 10/10 would recommend

**modulum83** (11): i do not say this lightly: pop perfection.

####**Steve Carrell, Cardi B, and Lil Jon walk into a bar**

**fadedblue09** (10): FINALLY. A song that actually sounds convincing. Even though the subject matter is not that new, it’s really anthemic and you can really tell it means a whole lot to him.

**hikkaru** (10): sellout bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): is this unabashedly shamelessly pop? Yes. do i give a single fuck? No.

**jolteonhoodie** (10): This song is just pure joy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/GrandioseMiserlyAntarcticfurseal-mobile.mp4

**RandomHypnotica** (9.9): I really do like this song, but it always kinda screamed "radio safe pop rock" to me, and in retrospect it kinda seems like a precursor to Panic!'s output now

**bespectacIed** (9): It sounds so much like a typical early 2010s indie pop song, it's almost comforting

**pig-serpent** (9): Peak Six Flags rock.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this song makes me miss going out and dancing

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): iconic anthem from the Smurfs (2011)

**kirby31200** (8): Fun but I can't listen to this without thinking about Universal Studios anymore

**twat\_brained** (7.5): unfortunately this song doesn't make me want to get reday to go nor do I want to go out of my mind listening to it. Tut tut.

**1998tweety** (7): this feels forgettable but that makes it better than half the album huh

**duhchappers** (7): I think I used to like this song more, but it's sorta too obvious in its messaging and doesn’t have as much replay value.

**intheaftermath** (7): I feel the need to mention this song is in the live action Smurfs movie. That is all.

**poptartchill** (7): This is such a catchy song. While I've grown a little tired of it over the years, it's still a very fun track that I enjoy.

**seanderlust\_** (7): Come on millennial whoop! This track feels the most cohesive out of possibly any track since the opener

**Verdantshade** (7): I hate how this is the only other vices and virtues song they play live when it's awfully repetitive.. ya basic

####**Sorry, we only have Coke here**

**conceptualromance** (6): this is car commercial music

**Leixander** (6): i am bored please change things up mr. brendon

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6): not me recognising this from the smurfs

**anothertown** (3): I hate this. I hate the bridge and the whoosh sounds

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): as someone who went to a lot of college football games around when this album came out, i will hate it forever.

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): This sounds so generic? Especially that stupid-ass millennial whoop. Sounds like something I’d hear out of a commercial

**DraculaWeekend** (1): Worst song on the album. If "The Only Exception" wasn't in this rate, this would be my 0. Get this song out of my mind pls.

####**I call this one 'Bold and Brash'**

**milkywayinradius** (0): wow more like ready to go into the trash. song is extremely derivative, basic and not what i would expect from patd. try harder, brandon

**Mysario** (9): Yea yea, another sappy song in this rate gone too early, what a surprise! It's really cute and extremely varied throughout without sounding jarring or overbearing. This is probably my second fave off the album (spoilers!) and yet I also hate it because I could never write such a cute song 🥺 nearly every Sarah I know is in a relationship, do you think their SOs wooed them with this?

---

####**This one is for you, Smiles!**

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): hehe that’s my name in the title :)

####👀

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is such a fucking bop, I s2g if this gets out on day 2

####🙂

**conceptualromance** (10): the chorus is immaculate

**pig-serpent** (10): I completely forgot that this song starts half country before having crazy mood-swings.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is the aural equivalent of standing outside a bakery at sunrise in the middle of Paris

**Verdantshade** (10): my favourite post ryan ross panic! song, and fully deserving of an 11. sarah is a lucky woman, this is such a genuine love song filled with all the passion and drama of panic!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.3): if this doesn’t get at least top 15 i’m rioting

**waluigiest** (9): CLASSIC panic. The lead in to the brass break is amazing

**anothertown** (8.5): sarah smiles =) like sarah doesn’t care =)

**grinchelda** (8.5): very cute but also my least favorite song on the album

**1998tweety** (8): i love latin music, with that said fuck sara

**duhchappers** (8): went from my favorite song on the album to one of my least favorite now back to really good but not great

**fadedblue09** (8): Surprisingly sweet. Wished the song was less generic pop-punk and also the harmonica bit should've been utilized more.

**ggal2020** (8): I love sarah so much and this song legit always makes me smile. how did all these emo boys end up with such great wives?

**poptartchill** (8): very cute song with some cool instrumental choices

**seanderlust\_** (8): Sarah, SArahh, SAARAHH, SAAAARAAAAAAAAAAHHHH

**twat\_brained** (8): I stopped listening halfway through I'm currently dissociating on a cross-territory roadtrip with my parents

**sandyfishnets** (7.9): every emo album has to have a super happy go lucky campy song with sad undertones

**engifear** (7): Ryden shippers be like "This song is actually about Ryan, not his wife"

**kirby31200** (7): A gift to the Sarahs of the world

####🙃

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): look its hard to follow up the best song on the album but A for effort

**jolteonhoodie** (5): This one really doesn't do anything for me

**milkywayinradius** (5): blegh que sarah, sarah

**modulum83** (5): the moment he starts singing the song starts going downhill

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This is supposed to be a romantic song? It sounds so… sarcastic and angry? Anyways stan Hall and Oates

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): it just doesn't sound good, im sry

**CarlieScion** (10): GOD this is a big bop. For the first year I listened to this I didn't even realise there was a Debbie Harry feature here, maybe just because I always listened with crappy headphones. This song sounds like actual anxiety in audio form, so 10/10 mr. fall out boy.

**Mysario** (9.5): I'M A NERVOUS WRECK I'M A NERVOUS WRECK I'M A NERVOUS WRECK I'M A three times for the holy ghost! Excellent closer and great vibes from miss Debbie Harry herself! I would consider giving it an 11 if the lyrics didn't kind of become way too nonsensical in the second verse, even by Patrick's standards.

---

####**Debbie Harry if you read this im free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I’m free**

**DraculaWeekend** (11): "I'M A NERVOUS WRECK" - can relate. Love this song so much. Debbie goes off too.

**shadowbake** (11): debbie harry is on it. also it slaps what more is there to say

**seanderlust\_** (9): oh hell yes! debbie harry!

**Verdantshade** (8): I was shook when I discovered that debbie harry was on this


####**Last of their kind**

**jackisboredtoday** (10): oh HELL yes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): doesn’t really work as a closer but it slaps so hard that i don’t really care

**anothertown** (9): wait maybe this song is great… got my degree in the gutter my heart broken in the dorms of the ivyLEEEEEAGUE

**jolteonhoodie** (9): --AAAID dun dun dun

**ktajlili** (9): How can career anxiety be such a BOP?

**modulum83** (9): this song makes me want to go apeshit

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): THREE TIMES FOR THE HOLY GHOST

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): definitely one of the best songs on this album

**poptartchill** (8.5): LOVE the instrumental

**conceptualromance** (8.3): I too am a nervous wreck

**duhchappers** (8): I think this song is really good but listening to it at the end of the whole album makes it hard for me to enjoy. In a playlist it kills

**twat\_brained** (7.6): three cheers for sweet phantoms arising from smokers' corpses

**1998tweety** (7): an ok closer

**pig-serpent** (7): I really like a lot of the guitar work on this song, and it's a pretty good release of agression.

####**Nervous wrecks**

**CactusWithinUs** (6): This song is good but I never found it all too necessary considering how well the track before feels like it ends off the album

**untitledmanuscript** (5): Disappointing album closer tbh (for standard album)

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): i know what these words mean separately but together in this order is just

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I don’t get how people can hate “Rat a Tat” but love this… Courtney Love complemented that song! Meanwhile Debbie Harry doesn’t add much to this one. Also, I will never hear “The drugs just make me reset” and not think of “Sincerely, Me” from Dear Evan Hansen (“Smoking drugs?”). Also, this is the worst ending song of the rate, it’s so abrupt!

**fadedblue09** (2.9): Yeesh what a mess. Pete's lyrics on this album sometimes borders on pretentious, and this song is the most glaring example.

**CarlieScion** (7): Chorus slaps, however the verses and instrumental sounds like it's being played out of an out-of-tune jukebox. I just wish they'd gone for a more crisp sound on this album, because it hurts my scoring of most of the songs when they all sound super-muddled. 

---

####**The future stars of How to Get Away with Murder Season 7**

**anothertown** (10): The actual huge banger of the album, this is what they did best in this era

**astrologicalangel** (10): Let's take a motherfucking life tonight! We're young and alive (which I can't say for that guy)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when this song always found itself on every 8tracks playlist i could find in 2015 tumblr… kinda iconic

**kirby31200** (10): Add this to your Halloween playlists!

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): is the best example to me of what this album is trying to accomplish and a good departure from their previous sound

**modulum83** (8.8): verses > chorus

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is pretty fun

**poptartchill** (8.5): This song gets me pumped in a spooky way. I do indeed clap my feet and clap my hands

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): that electric guitar is amazing

**jolteonhoodie** (8): Those claps before the first chorus!

**pig-serpent** (8): "What if we wrote a party song where we're abducted by aliens in the chorus, and there's a lot of violins and stuff. Wouldn't that be lit?"

**skargardin** (8): boppy

**waluigiest** (8): okay cute lil dance beat!!

**1998tweety** (7): why does this sound like halloween music; halloween music sweetie

**intheaftermath** (7): Would be a little higher if the lyrics weren’t so oddly “not like other girls”? Sorry, I’m too homicidal to party and listen to pop music like the popular kids.

####**These people were caught as The Imposter**

**bbfan132** (6.5): this was too loud at certain points (the drums….)

**conceptualromance** (6.5): it’s fine

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): one of the worst songs on this album. it’s not bad but pales in comparison to the rest of the songs here

**seanderlust\_** (6): SPOOKY GHOST OUTTRO

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): There’s nothing really attention-grabbing about this song… the chorus is weak and repetitive, and after the second chorus the song just kinda loses its excitement…

**fadedblue09** (2): Sounds like a soundtrack to one of those D-list horror movies.

**CarlieScion** (10): Why is this song going out NOW? Why did TWO people give it their 0? Why is ppopheads like this? These are the big questions.  

**Mysario** (8): Even though this song excels in its writing and composition, it just lacks a particular *oomph* factor to it and makes it sound like the same old song. It's still a big tune and since no one will read this comment I LOVE YOU ah I can't believe I've done that

####**The (Out for Delivery) Platinum Horseshoe Crabs**

**rotating3Dtext** (11): HORSESHOE CRAB HORSESHOE CRAB

**Roxieloxie** (11): I have a bad feeling this isnt gonna make it to day 3 but Im still gonna clown and stand behind it. I love this song. It's the ultimate roadtrip song, everytime my family would pack in and take a 10 hour drive to flordia this is the goto song to listen to while staring out the window. It just fills me with a weird nostalgic angst for something im not even sure i've experienced. the line 'I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs but i'm afraid that someone else will hear me" is such a raw fucking line that affects me way too much. Honestly This entire song is a masterpiece and im not even sure how to elaborate it without possibly crying

####**The (Shipped) Gold- wait**

**bespectacIed** (10): I love this because this feels like a Wombats song AND a 90s alt rock radio station. That intro is so delicious

**conceptualromance** (10): some of the best lyrics on the album

**fadedblue09** (10): My favorite song on the album, and I wish I loved this album more to give this an 11. Unlike most songs here, it doesn't come off as try-hard and messy in getting its message across.

**jolteonhoodie** (10): Every line in this song is pure gold

**ggal2020** (9.5): proof that fall out boy songs with gold in the title are superior.

**DraculaWeekend** (9): Patrick really goes off on this one

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is lowkey one of the best bridges in the rate

**poptartchill** (9): This song once came on once when I was in exactly the right mood to get it and I've fully appreciated it ever since.

**seanderlust\_** (9): "SUPRA and the Prophet are both in the business of souls" is peak FOB cheese. I love it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Fun fact! I used to really love this song because I was studying accounting in college and was happy that a song actually referenced it! Then I failed my class. But after listening to the song again, I can say that the magic is still there!

**modulum83** (8.8): sounds kinda like a great Fountains of Wayne track

**1998tweety** (8): verses slap

####**The (Processed) Silver Norm**

**anothertown** (7.5): This song has one of my favorite bridges I’ve ever heard but that’s really all it has going for it. Now that I finally looked up the lyrics and I know it says “Supra and the prophet are both in the business of soles” though, lol.

**kirby31200** (7): I quote this song every time horseshoe crabs come up, which has been surprisingly often

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): idk this has always felt filler-ish to me

**intheaftermath** (6): From here out, the album gets a bit monotonous for me. That’s not to say it’s not good music, it just would benefit from some instrumental variety.

**pig-serpent** (6): This song is so good until the chorus hits. It's more of the washed up nonsense from this album that doesn't feel explosive enough to follow the fantastic pre-chorus (that gets more repeats than the chorus because the band knew it was a better section.) Also the bridge is really neat.

**duhchappers** (5): "the same old song" describes this pretty well, feels like a budget version of an average FOB song

####**The (Payment Declined) Bronze Outliers**

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): they did this song far better when it was i'm like a lawyer, sry.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): if a robot was told to make a fall out boy song, it would be this. This is just bland and generic and pretty standard.

**twat\_brained** (0): pointless

**CarlieScion** (10): This was another one of my 11 choices (I had 3 just on Brand New Eyes). I keep forgetting Paramore started out as an actual christian band, but as an atheist, I still relate so much to this song. The imagery is beautiful, I love the build up and Hayley's vocals are gorgeous as usual.

**Mysario** (7.5): It's a refreshing change of pace from the album sonically. However this song never really clicked with me, which is weird because I typically enjoy songs that are vaguely about Jesus but never mention it out right! 

---

####**My Safest Haven**

**Verdantshade** (11): there's so many fantastic songs on this rate but it wasn't even a debate to give this my 11. every single thing about this is perfect, from the soaring guitars to the utterly hopeless chorus and the brilliant dynamics, shifting from contemplation to anger to hopelessness. 'in the free fall I will realise I'm better off when I hit the bottom' has to be one of the most crushing lyrics of all time

**bespectacIed** (10): The obsession I had with this song is ridiculous, this was my favorite in Brand New Eyes for a long time because it's so relatable lol. Not trying to fighting your depression and just succumbing to it... como Ariana Grande dijo: it's a mood, it's a vibe, it's a look, it's a match. The line "And the worst part is before it gets any better we're headed for a cliff / and in the freefall I will realize I'm better off when I hit the bottom" is top 5 best Paramore line of all time

**conceptualromance** (10): best opening line ever perhaps

**fadedblue09** (10): After Laughter wishes it was this good when pulling the whole "cheery tune, depressing lyrics" shtick.

**fifteensunflwrs** (10): crying to this song when you are eleven years old and you think your life will never get better is a very interesting experience

**Leixander** (10): the acoustic version is GOAT but this is awesome too

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i can never hit those notes in AGAINNNNNNANANAN but i will still try every time

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i can listen to the bridge of this song on repeat for hours

**twat\_brained** (9.2): I listen to Paramore because Hayley is clear in her speech, not unintelligible like Patrick

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Definitely one of the lyrical highlights of BNE

**1998tweety** (8.5): bops a bit

**bbfan132** (8.5): a bit weaker than the previous few songs but i still really enjoyed it! it kind of mellowed out at times but it quickly brought back the energy

**ktajlili** (8.5): more like Turn it UP

**modulum83** (7.8): legitimately one of the most fun songs on the album

**poptartchill** (7.5): I really like the bridge and the last chorus. This one is new to me and I could see myself going back to it a lot.

**duhchappers** (7): another good instrumental bridge, a nice change of pace

####**Song Title**

**pig-serpent** (6): After 4 back to back bangers, this songs sounds a little dull and the chorus isn't too interesting.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): kinda boring

**anothertown** (3): :very very small font so no one can see it: 

#>>>*"[book of Mormon (2011) outpeaked](https://youtu.be/_asNhzXq72w)"* <<<

**CarlieScion** (9): Are you worth your weight in gold? I'm not, but this song is still great. This walks perfectly on that fine line between pretentious/nonsensical and energic/boppy. The self-confidence and narcissism in the 'They know that I know that they don't look/sound like me' is off the charts, but somehow Brendon pulls it off.

**Mysario** (9): This song is FANTASTIC. That's it! It kind of hits all the right notes that Panic does right when they want to make pop anthems. BUT once again, the outro killed me from giving this a solid 10. In the album, these little interludes work well, but not when I'm tryna bop! Did y'all not know you can split them off from the regular tracks or did you only want 10 songs on the album as to not scare anyone off? RIP the bonus tracks and the interludes that could've been.

---

####**Dances to the boppest boppers**

**nbapip** (11): was obsessed with this for soooo long

**conceptualromance** (10): I do miss when I thought he was saying bang bang we are a hurricane but it’s still a ten without that

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song reminds me so much of old P!ATD, especially with the outro - love it.

**grinchelda** (10): slap my ass and call me a revolutionary

**Lizardman469** (10): this one goes seriously underrated

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I really love this song, and I get what they were going for with the outro, but it kind ruins the replayability of this song, so I wish they'd just made it an interlude on the album or something. Thankfully, it's easy enough to edit out

**twat\_brained** (10): rock's not really my genre but I know a 10 when I hear one

**Verdantshade** (10): what has happened to brendon's lyrics since? 'hey we are a hurricane, drop our anchors in a storm / hey they will never be the same, a fire in a flask to keep us warm' you can literally FEEL the passion of the song and now... he just writes meaningless lyrics about partying

**duhchappers** (9): maybe it’s just bias but I think the production is so cool here, I might not dance to anything but I'll dance to this all day

**ImADudeDuh** (9): sorry kina but this ended fadsley

**intheaftermath** (9): I love the delivery on this song! It’s so passionate and thrilling.

**modulum83** (9): always interpreted this song as being about a gay relationship which means i have to give it a high score

**rickikardashian** (9): i like that we’re giving an elevator music intermission

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I can’t help myself from grooving to this song! The beat is infectious, and the instrumentation is just as great to listen to as Brendon’s voice. It’s just a fun song!

**milkywayinradius** (8.5): catchy

**engifear** (8): One of my old tumblr mutuals once told me this song reminds them of me and I still don't know what they meant by that.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I like some elements of this song but other ones (like the beginning and end) I could go without

**pig-serpent** (8): Very solid party song

**sandyfishnets** (8): the lyrics, damn, so good

**ggal2020** (7.8): why is every song called hurricane so good??

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.8): call me basic but i love the lyric “i led the revolution in my bedroom”

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.8): this is good fun

**anothertown** (7.7): This song has a lot more going on than I remembered. I’ve never listened to this album on Spotify so I’m guessing these outros are exclusive to this platform? They’re not hitting

####**Only dances to the Cha Cha Slide**

**1998tweety** (7): bridgit mendler easily outsold

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): , a good song, but the background vocals are way too loud for me at points

**bbfan132** (6.5): another overblown song… kind of disappointed

**Leixander** (6): what does this outro have to do with anything??

**seanderlust\_** (6): As much as I love the disco clap at the beginning and the outro, the chorus just feels separated from the verses

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): kinda forgettable

**fadedblue09** (5.6): I thought I'd like it at first but the chorus blows. Also, the lyrics are just??? Somehow Brendon Urie manages to make a breakup song sound so pretentious.

**waluigiest** (5): the outro makes me SO ANGRY and I can’t explain why

**Mysario** (9.5): Despite not being a notable musician or artist in any way, I have had a chronic fear that I'll be joining the 27 club since I was a kid. Uh oh! And if home is where the heart is, then well I really am fu- AHEM back to the song, this song is underrated by most people but thankfully well appreciated by fans of the albums. Shout out to everyone with an anchor shirt or tattoo that says "I refuse to sink". Looking at you, The Wonder Years fans!

---

####**My body is an orphanage 🥵**

**poptartchill** (11): I don't see people talk about this song too much but it's my favorite from this album. I think the lyrics are really strong and I absolutely love the instrumental. This was a song that really drew me in when I was younger and I still feel really connected to it. Overall, I just find it to be a really interesting song? And I feel that my favorite song from my favorite Fall Out Boy album deserves my 11.

**anothertown** (10): I love to rate this song at age 27!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): GET HYPE

**grinchelda** (10): my favorite song on fad. "my body is an orphanage we take everyone in" me too thanks

**modulum83** (10): guitar solo guitar solo guitar solo

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): gorgeous, wounded but somehow still so confidently written. a lot of heart in this song to me!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): amazing exceptional phenomenal i love this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the guitar solo….i froth

**Verdantshade** (10): patrick swearing had me shook. also, what a guitar solo

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.6): one of their most iconic opening lines imo

**twat\_brained** (8.4): I take it Patrick's home life was rather unpleasant at the time of recording this

**kirby31200** (8): There's an official FOB shirt with an anchor on it. I find that hilarious

**ktajlili** (8): I’ll be listening to this track on my next birthday

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I like this song. It’s edgy. What else can I say?

**1998tweety** (7.5): the guitar ate but the rest is ok

**conceptualromance** (7.5): this song is good but also doesn’t stand out in any way

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): that opening line though!!

####**Doing lines of dust and sweat 🤪**

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): Honestly the lyrics have this kind of Mitski vibe to them and I know people are about to flip at me for saying that but oh well

**pig-serpent** (7): Just a solid rock song, nothing more, nothing less. Production doesn't suck on this track surprisingly.

**seanderlust\_** (7): "My body is an orphanage, we take everyone in" POWER BOTTOM ANTHEM ALERT

**skargardin** (7): thinking about turning 27 next year, the dread of it all

**duhchappers** (6): would probably be lower without the guitar solo. Lyrics fall into the category where he talks about being depressed and famous but it kinda just sounds like bragging

**fadedblue09** (5): Atavan Halen had a better take on the same subject matter, and had a more fun hook as well.

**CarlieScion** (10): This was a measly 2 points away from making Day 3 (sorry /u/wavingwolves, guess you should have gotten those scores in in time!). That's pretty great from a non-single, non-fan favorite slow ballad. I have far, far too many Misguided Ghosts-scrobbles on my Last.fm, because this is on my sleep playlist. It's so damn comforting, like a hug from an old friend. The 'organic' sounds of a hand sliding on a fret is just *chef's kiss*. 

**Mysario** (7): "This is the redheaded step child of the record" - Hayley Williams who then dyed her hair blonde. Also shout out to the average being 7.77

####**Year Zero / Are you okay?**

**seanderlust\_** (9): Putting on a Spotify playlist titled "Songs for when you're ready to fake your own death and start a new life under a false name in Singapore but you leave a note for your husband that just says "I'm all right. I love you" and he will someday move on but will always be wondering what became of you." It's fine. I'm doing fine, guys.

####**Dance Macabres / the pottery scene from Ghost**

**grinchelda** (10): the gem of the album

**TiltControls** (10): the better accoustic song on the album

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I always found this song mesmerizing, particularly because in contrast to the rest of the album, Hayley’s voice on this track sounds more like her S/T-and-onward voice. It’s as melodic and lively as her classic pop-punk sound, but with a delicateness that really brings out the emotion of this song.

**conceptualromance** (9.9): ouch

**modulum83** (9.5): this song hits agonizingly hard, fuck.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.3): no idea if this is a popular opinion or not but this is easily one of the best songs on the album

**bbfan132** (9): wasn’t expecting a folk song here but i’m not mad at all

**fadedblue09** (9): Looking back, I think this is the superior ballad on the album, since it represents its themes better. Also I dig the idyllic vibe it exudes.

**fifteensunflwrs** (9): crying to this song at 1 am when you are a very sad 12 year old and then listening to it again when you are a less-sad-but-still-sad 17 year old is a very interesting experience

**intheaftermath** (9): now THIS is how to nail a soft acoustic track! It’s so tangible and genuine and stunning.

**Verdantshade** (9): I didn't know I could cry this much, and then 26 came out

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): this will probably be out on day 1 due to popheads' hating slow songs but it mixes up the album which is def needed by the end and provides a nice juxtaposition

**DraculaWeekend** (8): This is what "The Only Exception" wanted to be

**ignitethephoenix** (8): love the change of pace here this is cute. Give me Taylor Swift vibes

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is good

**pig-serpent** (8): Whoa, acoustic guitars can be used to create interesting atmospheres and not just play bland chords surprised Pikachu

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): so much better than the only exception

####**Rats / the pottery scene from Community**

**twat\_brained** (7): this is too soft, I'm in a car ride with my parents and I hear them talking

**1998tweety** (6.5): no thanks

**bespectacIed** (6): Gonna ruin my overinflated BNE average but this so boringggg, the lyrics too on the nose. My only <10 in BNE because my capacity to tolerate ballads was already filled by the only exception

**duhchappers** (6): needed more energy, lost me halfway through

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (5): i know this is such a fan favourite but i have never really gotten into it

**jolteonhoodie** (3): It's just not for me and it feels so long despite being only 3 minutes

McIgglyTuffMuffin: If Playing God doesn't win we riot. 

I know it isn't going to win, it's probably going to be Decode or Brick by Boring Brick, but it needs to win.

pig-serpent: Somehow missed that this was going on next week!  These threads get unpinned way too quickly.

Me: Man, day 1 only eliminated songs I dislike or I'm meh on.  This rate might not give me anyone to complain about.
Day 2 *takes Trade Mistakes out back and massacres it with a rusty shotgun*: Are you sure about that?
