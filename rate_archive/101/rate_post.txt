#*[Folie à Deux](http://www.thegoodwineguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Folie-a-Deux-Merlot-2007.jpg)* - Fall Out Boy
 
Welcome to the new administration of emo sounds! At the down turn of the "Pop-Punk on the Radio Scene" and after a somewhat viral marketing campaign, *Folie à Deux* was released. Not wanting to feel like a gimmick by releasing on the American November Election Day and not wanting to overshadow flop releases like Britney Spears's *Circus*, Beyoncé's *I Am... Sasha Fierce*, and Kanye West's *808s & Heartbreak* (ugh what generous kings), they missed its original release date barely making the cut in late December 2008. 
 
The band took their previous sounds (mostly from 2007's *Infinity on High*) that they've been growing from and, along with a dose of chemical X, mixed it with a myriad of different genres in this album to create the Power-Pop Boys! Thanks to all these different genres that FOB decided to play with, every song has a unique sound compared to the previous one. It's also lyrically a strong departure from before, the band believing the autobiographical format was "losing its luster" from "everyone doing it" and instead striving to direct it more towards the world at hand.
 
The madness that surrounded this album in and out the studio had a lot more negative impact than it did positive. The sales numbers weren't as good as their previous efforts, "only" debuting at number eight on the Billboard 200 charts. This wasn't helped any better by critics and fans remarking how different the band's sound was now compared to fan favourite songs like "Saturday" and "Sugar We're Going Down". Fans would boo and jeer whenever they would play any of these new songs at concerts as it was far too different than what they were used to. 
 
Initially choosing to limit the time they took to record the album, the band would later blame that the album wasn't nearly as good as it could've been because they didn't take their sweet time making it. The band, depressed over the reaction to the album at the time, chose to take a "hiatus" in 2009 to clear their minds and take up other projects such as *Soul Punk*, The Damned Things, and something about Pete Wentz with Bebe Rexha.

#*[Vices and Virtues](https://fanart.tv/fanart/music/61dedf14-34cf-41ff-af89-68d66faf3860/albumcover/vices-and-virtues-4e78e39563261.jpg)* - Panic! At The Disco
 
After losing the band's guitarist and bassist, the remaining members of the band along with additional musicians went ahead and released *Vices and Virtues* in mid-March 2011. The album features some catchy choruses, hard-hitting guitars, and Adam Gontier of Canadian pride and joy Three Days Grace... wait... this isn't Art of Dying? Well, most of these things are true for Panic as well (though unfortunately a Brendon Urie post-grunge collab waits for another day). 
 
There was a calm separation between the departing Ryan Ross and Jon Walker and the remaining Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith as they had completely different musical directions they wanted to do. Ross and Walker went on to create a single album for the Young Veins called *Take a Vacation!* (pretty decent fake Beach Boys album btw).
 
Urie and Smith continued to work under the name of Panic! at the Disco, now adding back in the previously removed exclamation point, a decision that had fans cheering all around the world (yea, it was a p big deal at the time, news was slow back then). The duo created their first song together with "New Perspective" and it shook the world as much as Jennifer's Body did.
 
With Brendon taking up duties as the main songwriter, the album that would release took a strong turn into a more streamlined radio-friendly pop style as opposed to the previous albums that were more bombastic and experimental. Although many fans and critics would give it mixed reviews, they were all Ready to Go give it positive remarks with the album debuting at number seven on the Billboard 200 charts.

#*[Brand New Eyes](https://media1.tenor.com/images/d598d316452fa991ddedbefe34988c09/tenor.gif)* - Paramore
 
On our last tour fueled by ramen, we land back in 2009 to when *Brand New Eyes* would be released. After releasing *Riot!* with the Problematique^^TM hit "Misery Business" and the top bop "Decode" for the unforgettable film Twilight, the band went into the studio to work on *Brand New Eyes*. This put the band under a lot of pressure when writing for the album - they now had a solid fanbase, GP interest and a label interested in making bank on their investment.
 
Musically it comes off sounding less like a Riot and more like a Pep Rally this time around, ditching the angry sound with a more refined one. Contrarily, many of the lyrics on the album portray the strife internally in the band and the struggles Hayley Williams faced in the then-present. Luckily all the angsting during the making of the album paid off! They managed to get a second hit in The Only Exception, which got the high honors of being covered on Glee. Unlike the other chumps, this album debuted at number two on Billboard 200 charts.

* Rate every song with a score between **1 and 10**. You may give **one** song a **ZERO**, and **one** song an **ELEVEN**. As great as "Maps" is, you **cannot** give your 0 or 11 to bonus rate songs.
