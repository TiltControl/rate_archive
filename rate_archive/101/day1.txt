The Emo Rate 1.5 Day 1 - God Knows The World Doesn't Need Another Band
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ivay1j/the_emo_rate_15_day_1_god_knows_the_world_doesnt/

Hola, mis amores!

Welcome to Day 1 of the emo rate 1.5 (well, it's actually the third one, but brandingTM). We also only got a total of [one user](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/i2fepw/the_emo_rate_15_folie_%C3%A0_deux_vs_vices_virtues_vs/g07lbzb/) telling us that none of these bands are [ACKCHYUALLY](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/021/665/DpQ9YJl.jpg) Emo, so that is a success in my book! 

Today's reveal will begin at **3PM EST**, where songs #42 to 31 will be brutally murdered by a gang of tasteless twinks. [Come join us in the **plug.dj**, where we will be listening to these bops as they go out!](https://plug.dj/popheads/)

Some stats before the show gets on the road:

* 77 people did the rate! That's one whole more person than my previously hosted rate - the Charity Rate. We like nostalgic pop punk more than community-chosen songs 4 charity!

* The average score is 7.620, so y'all actually think most of these songs pretty good!

* On the other side, the average controversy is 1.868, so any songs with higher controversy than this should be considered highly controversial.

* I once again managed to force Halsey into a bonus rate. My power!

**Mysario** (7): Even though I gave this a 7, this is easily the worst song on the album. The intro and verses are great! Then the chorus and bridge are all kind of dreamy sounding, but not in a good way. It all kind of drones together. The ending here is one of my favourite outros they *could have* done due to how hard you hear them go - but it's cut wicked short for a weird voyeur clip of Patrick Stump singing in the shower. Does it deserve last place in the rate? Probably for that alone.

**CarlieScion** (6): I have no idea how this ended up being the worst song in this entire rate, but I guess that speaks to how great the other songs are - more than how terrible this song is. It feels kinda filler-y when Folie A Deux has so many standout songs.

---

####**THIS is r/popheads' artistic PEAK**

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Wet Ass Man Sack

####**Sweetener is Ariana's artistic PEAK**

**jolteonhoodie** (10): The "My head's in heaven..." lines is one of my absolute favourite lyrics ever. I always skip the outro though, why is it even here

**conceptualromance** (9.8): this song would be a 10 if not for the outro

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9.3): absolute banger, nothing more needs to be said. unfortunately i don't love the outro which stops it from being a 10

**Verdantshade** (9): I hate the outro but it also hypes me up for 20 dollar nose bleed EVERY DAMN TIME

**grinchelda** (8.4): my least favorite song on the album?

**rickikardashian** (7.8): i hated the part at the end

**twat\_brained** (7.5): why the acapella blues outro

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): Pharrell doing synths for this… pop-punk’s Sweetener era really arrived here

**duhchappers** (7): I think I would need about 15 more listens to get a true understanding of this one. It's weird and interesting and I like it on a surface level

**ktajlili** (7): old favorite but can’t unhear the fact the beginning sounds like farts

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the last bit of this song raised my score

**poptartchill** (7): This one was a grower for me. And in some ways it's still growing on me. But I appreciate it more every time I listen.

**1998tweety** (6.5): this was good but then the end happened, and its not even a short outro its over a minute

**fadedblue09** (6.4): Lol I forgot this had an acapella outro. I love the guitar solo bit, but I think they tried too much here and ended up accomplishing little in return.

**modulum83** (6): the sounds in the chorus are, honestly, just dissonant and unpleasing to listen to. however: +1 points for that dreamy jazzy bridge

**seanderlust\_** (6): What is the last minute of this song

####**thank u next**

**Leixander** (5.5): wanted to skip this one so bad

**waluigiest** (5): I forgot a song was playing for the second half of this lol

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): the only miss on the album for me, kinda boring overall and the outro goes on for far too long and adds literally nothing

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I’ve never been a fan of this song.. What do the lyrics mean? Why is the last line of the chorus so slurred and unintelligible? Why is he singing to a freckle?? The song that Patrick sings at the end of the track is better than this song lol

**anothertown** (3): I can’t believe people say that sweetener or anything post-2010 is Pharrell’s worst work when this exists

**pig-serpent** (2): What's going on? Why are the vocals so quiet? Why is the mixing?

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): this song just does not do much for me for some reason. sounds like a soul punk reject

**Mysario** (9): I think it’s a very well-written song at its core and fits really well with the rest of the album! Unfortunately it got cut and will be forgotten to the sands of time. Free this song, Brendon, put it on Spotify! It wants to be free!

---

####**Turn Of The Lights DESERVED**

**Verdantshade** (10): why are we not rating turn off the lights?? I'd like to shout that song out, the line 'so shoot on a star on the boulevard tonight / I think I'll figure it out with a little more time' is one of my favourite lyrics by brendon. I wanna be free is also a cool song though

**modulum83** (8.5): i am using this space to complain that Turn Off The Lights and Bittersweet, two of the Vices tracks I love the most, were left off. anyways good song.

**kirby31200** (5): It's fine. But Turn Off the Lights should've been included instead. Also quick shoutout to Mercenary, most overlooked song of V&V era


####**Fuck Panic! for not putting the bonus tracks on Spotify**

**conceptualromance** (10): I wish this was on the standard edition

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is the highlight of the bonus tracks (included in the rate anyway) for me, it just feels like it's got the most on par with the quality of the rest of the album, and I LOVE the syncopation added in that last repeat of the chorus

**twat\_brained** (9.5): anti-maskers in desperate need of oppression

**duhchappers** (8): the more straightforward lyrics work well here, this might be my favorite bonus track.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I am a sucker for songs that switch time signatures… Also I think Brendon sounds really good here!

**bbfan132** (7.5): brendon is such a good singer, i love his vocal inflections during the chorus

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): this really hit my preteen gay self in the feels huh

###¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**poptartchill** (6.5): One of the weaker tracks to me but I'm not mad at it

**intheaftermath** (6): This song feels like an early This is Gospel somehow, but it doesn’t hit nearly as hard?

**ktajlili** (6): lyrics are lacking to me

**seanderlust\_** (6): I think of the bonus tracks, this one is weaker. It is just a bit less compelling than the others

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): the lyrics speak to 14 year old me

####**Fuck bonus tracks**

**fadedblue09** (5): It's not bad but honestly, I'm just bored at this point.

**pig-serpent** (5): There are a few neat moments like some of the drum patterns, but overall this is kinda boring.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): ok i wanna be loved too what makes you so special

**plvstvcbvrds** (1): no.

**Mysario** (7): It’s very soothing and has some nice singing in it. I wish I had anything else to say to this song. I could see why it was basically cut and forgotten about. I wish we threw “Turn Off The Lights” into this rate or even “Bittersweet” instead but realistically, they weren’t gonna do well either and we had too much Panic as is. Sorry!

---

####**Kaleidoscope Of LOUD Heartbeats Under Coats!**

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a bop idc idc

**seanderlust\_** (10): I've never heard a better sound coming out than when you're whimpering my name from your mouth........I'm hole.

**TiltControls** (10): imma just pretend those last 10 seconds don't exist...

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): an underrated bop

**grinchelda** (9.7): cackles maniacally

**modulum83** (9.2): This is straight-up a musical number a villain sings while strolling around the town. I love it.

**intheaftermath** (9): I wish this was a part of the main album. It’s so charming and could balance out the pride of songs like Hurricane.

**Verdantshade** (9): god that ending. what a fun song though... I'm just a white blood cell.. fighting like hell.. for you

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): Probably my least favourite of the bonus tracks, feels a bit too sugar and sunshine to me (Also that ending is pretty cringy)

**twat\_brained** (8.1): shapes and colors the likes of which I've never seen!

**1998tweety** (8): its fun

**bbfan132** (8): pleasantly surprised by this, i liked the 60s-esque production here (it also sounded like a theme song to a show which was fun)

**poptartchill** (8): I like this one a lot but I also understand why it's a bonus track. Some interesting choices were made here but I like them.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): what are these lyrics askjdksla

**anothertown** (7): just smile and nod girls……….

**ignitethephoenix** (7): “I got an insatiable desire for your insides” chill lmao

**jolteonhoodie** (7): Well isn't this a jaunty little tune

**Leixander** (7): what are you going to do with my insides daddy

**milkywayinradius** (7): cute song

**pig-serpent** (7): Sounds like it belongs on Pretty Odd. As far as 60's throwback stuff does, it's alright but it's really made by Urie's musical theater kid stylings.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): what broadway play is this from

####**The Kaleidoscope In Brendon's Heart In The [ME!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5Gyr71XkAEdLUi.jpg) Music Video**

**CritneySpearz** (6): omg this ending legit scared me, truly bringing the Panic into Panic at the Dicks

**duhchappers** (6): its fine idk

**kirby31200** (6): "I've got an insatiable desire for your insides" these lyrics are a touch grosser than I remember, the bridge really makes this cute song take a turn for the questionable. I expect those kinds of lyrics from FOB, not Panic. But aside from that Brendon does a great job

**skargardin** (6): erm..

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (5.5): - I hate the maniacal laughing at the end of this track so much.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.4): i’m glad this is a deluxe track so i can act like it doesn’t exist

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): boring - nothing good or bad to say on it

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Well this is certainly a song… I don’t know, I just think it’s a bit too cheesy-sounding for me... Also what in the world is that sound he makes after “whimperin’ my name from your mouth”???

**bespectacIed** (2): kids' show music

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): this sounds like sara barielles when she was still mad at her label

**conceptualromance** (1): no

**fadedblue09** (0): I was gonna comment “yikes”, but then I heard this was supposed to satirize toxic love, which made it worse because I’m super picky about satire! Very weak writing, horrid, overall very futile attempt at the subject matter

**TragicKingdom1** (0): panic at the disco SUCKS!

**CarlieScion** (10): This song is so genuinely sweet that it borders on sickening, but I appreciate the show of emotions (plus the melody makes my heart swoon). This got too sickly sweet for most of y'all, so to bottom of the trash pile it goes.

**Mysario** (7): Come on let me hold you, touch you, feel you always, kiss you, taste you all night always 😭 oh wait, wrong song. A little out of place in the album but this is cute too. We love unreciprocated love! 

---

####**Wishing they were Sarah Urie**

**grinchelda** (10): words cannot express how much i wish ryan sang the bridge

**Verdantshade** (10): p!atd goes acoustic! in all seriousness, brendon's voices suits songs like this instead of songs where he's screaming over a bunch of noise (emperor's new clothes, king of the clouds)

**waluigiest** (10): to me this is the spiritual successor to Northern Downpour and When the Day Met the Night. It has cute tender writing and BEAUTIFUL vocals. Pop punk ballad excellence.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): sounds like it could vaguely be on pretty odd (i.e their best album) so i love it

**twat\_brained** (8.7): blink-182 found back on hiatus

**DraculaWeekend** (8): This song is cute without being overly cheesy. Also reminds me of Pretty. Odd. in a good way.

**ggal2020** (8): I’m a sucker for the more stripped down panic! songs.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this reminds me of pretty.odd. :)

**seanderlust\_** (8): The vibe is "walking along a path made of stars in a dream sequence"

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): the closest this album has to a Northern Downpour… doesn’t measure up to that level of perfection but this is sweet

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): I like this song, even though I think it's a pretty sudden shift in sound, but I have kinda bad memories with this song. When I was in 8th grade me and my mum narrowly avoided being t-boned by a guy running a red light just after the line "my spider's dead", and we were pretty freaked out and crying cause we almost died , so uh, yeah this song is a very mixed experience for me

**anothertown** (7.5): Brendon keeps his acoustic songs under 3 minutes and I respect him for that.

**bbfan132** (7.5): kind of cheesy but i enjoyed the much-needed change of pace/sound

**hikkaru** (7): cute

**kirby31200** (7): Cute yet vaguely unsettling

**pig-serpent** (7): It's nice to have a small break, but the rest of the album is so much more lush, and Panic have better acoustic songs, so this is kinda a miss, comparatively speaking.

**poptartchill** (7): A sweet song that fits the album well. I'm not always in the mood for it but it's a solid track.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): tbh this is just a really cute, nice song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is a sweet song! Makes me feel warm and fuzzy

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Pleasant-sounding, well-written, but I'm not fully sold on it for some reason?

**jolteonhoodie** (6.5): It's cute

####**Wishing they were Severus Snape**

**1998tweety** (6): no thanks

**duhchappers** (6): easily most forgettable song here yet pleasant for what it is

**intheaftermath** (5): I feel like this song doesn’t really know what it wants to be? Is

**Leixander** (5): i take back what i said on the previous song ugh don't give me the boring cliche acoustic ballad

**modulum83** (5): take on me mashup >>>

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): very out of place on this album and not my favorite vocals

**bespectacIed** (1): aggressively boring

**conceptualromance** (0): I simply don’t buy this attempt at sincerity from Brendon Urie

**Mysario** (9): Ugh this song goes hard in the mofo PAINT yo! My days ARE numbered at 24! Most people agree this isn't notable or that great (heck, Paramore basically hasn't played it live in 10 years), but it's a nice kick right after the acoustic ballad. I appreciate the message behind this song, even if it's incredibly corny. I think Shia LaBouf said it better though, in much less words too.

**CarlieScion** (7): This song is where all the songs on Brand New Eyes starts to feel similar to me. The lyrics are as tone-deaf as Misery Business to me, just in a 'pull yourself up by the bootstraps'-kinda way. The guitar goes awf tho.

---

####**That one greek anarchist Uber driver who told me depression isn't real**

**bespectacIed** (10): Yasss we love Hayley "Plato" Williams. The three song run starting with this one are triplets sonically, and all of em are 10/10. That extra lick of electric guitar in the last chorus, that one fucking minuscule extra detail, literally makes my face melt!!!!

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): honestly one of the most underrated paramore songs

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): There are plenty of people that I would love to sing this song to… I feel no sympathy bitch!! Get on with your life!!

**conceptualromance** (8.7): I love the lyrics on this one

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): i've always thought of this as the lesser version to Playing God but luckily it's still a solid song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): this makes me depressed bc i feel like im the exact type of person that this song is about

**twat\_brained** (8.5): I hope they sang this when they reunited

**fadedblue09** (8.3): "I feel no sympathy, you live inside a cake".

**modulum83** (7.8): hayley you're not my mom fuck you

**1998tweety** (7.5): this feels filler-y

**grinchelda** (7.5): i came out to have a good time

**Roxieloxie** (7.1): this reminds me of some disney era 2008 song and i cant place which one

####**Feeling sympathy for the tasteless people above**

**duhchappers** (7): this album’s average song, good but I can’t help but feel its a worse “Ignorance”

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): okay just kind of abrupt and fillery

**pig-serpent** (6): The guitar work in the final chorus is cool, but otherwise this song is kinda dull.

**seanderlust\_** (6): Hayley said you don't get to breathe after The Only Exception. GOOD MORNING MOTHERFUCKERS BA NA NAAA NA NA NA NA

**ImADudeDuh** (4): these album tracks lowkey sound all the same

**kirby31200** (4): Those darn kids with their uPhones and their Nintendo Gamemans! Kids don't go outside anymore like we did in the glory days of the late 90s. Only real 90s kids will get this song

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): just so loud

**RandomHypnotica** (0): This whole song just feels pretty immature honestly, the whole "just get up and DO SOMETHING you're so LAZY sToP FeElINg SoRrY FoR YoUrSeLf" shmick sounds like it should be coming from the singer of Smash Mouth not Hayley

**CarlieScion** (10): This is the best bonus track, hands down. I'm so upset this isn't on Spotify, because I KNOW it's available on Apple Music.

**Mysario** (9.5): the idea of bonus tracks is so frustrating. Wicked glad that it’s an outdated concept at this point. UGH! This song deserved to be on the album, eclipsing some, if not most, of the other songs in overall hype and catchiness IMO. It’s pretty cute in the sense that Brendon wrote this about being way too head-over-heels, so maybe it was made to be a bonus because he was embarrassed about it? If so, that’s a mood.

---

####**The crowd that's rejoicing**


**anothertown** (10): whew!!!! Concise and exhilarating

**modulum83** (9.7): biggest influence of alt rock/power pop on this record. chorus blows my dick off every single time

**grinchelda** (9.5): wait no i changed my mind, this is the ultimate ryden bait

**seanderlust\_** (9): The writers don't surprise me. "A dark room in the wallflower garden of the party" is the most Pete Wentz line I've ever heard.

**waluigiest** (9): these bonus tracks are wonderful

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): "She's got four on the floor" sounds way dirtier to me than I think was intended

**Leixander** (8.5): this is better than most of the tracks on the album lmao

**twat\_brained** (8.2): please tell me this was on the tour setlist

**bbfan132** (8): i thought this was enjoyable!

**duhchappers** (8): lyrics are kinda weird but really strong vocal line as always

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I like this song, it’s cute! I just don’t really know what he means by “stall me” lol

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.6): this song is worse than i remembered but it’s still a bop

**ggal2020** (7.5): my car literally any time I drive it in traffic.

**poptartchill** (7.5): I really like the lyrics on this one! I haven't listened to it in a while and it was fun to jam to

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I keep hearing stormy instead of stall me

**pig-serpent** (7): Not sure why this is a bonus track. It's a bit weaker than most of the album, but it's a short album and this wouldn't detract from the experience at all.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): do you know HOW LONG i thought he was saying "stormy" and not "stall me"

####**Cursing everyone and everything, even the sun**

**intheaftermath** (6): It’s nice, but lacks the magic and aesthetic of the rest of the album. It works better on its own.

**conceptualromance** (5): I find this song a bit generic

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): sounds very dated

**fadedblue09** (3): This is just a jumbled assortment of words that barely make any sense.

**CarlieScion** (9): The chorus of oh-oh-oh-ohs makes me want to stomp my feet! I feel like this would be perfect at live shows, which just reminds me how much I miss going to concerts. Thanks, now I'm sad.

**Mysario** (8.5): The day I found out about this song was the day that changed my outlook on 'Folie' as a whole. It's an excellent song and it made me think of how good the rest of the songs were! I love everything about this song - the vocal melodies, the instruments, the lyrics - but there's something about this song that makes it feel incomplete though that I can't describe. FOB must've heard it too and that's why it got shelved as an unfortunate bonus track. Regardless, the song deserves way more love or recognition than it ever got! It's the invisible song I can't stop singing at the mirror 😔

---

####**Patrick Stump's heavenly vocals.**

**ketchupsunshine** (11): it deserves

**conceptualromance** (10): I wish this was on Apple Music so much

**milkywayinradius** (10): never heard this song before!

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): should have replaced west coast smokers, justice for dog bell man

**DraculaWeekend** (9): Sorry, CRJ, FOB has the best B-sides.

**duhchappers** (9): Some of the cleanest guitar on the album, sounds like what half the other songs were aiming for. If this song was on spotify I would totally jam out to it very often

**twat\_brained** (8.3): why was this a bonus track and not in Gold Standard's place?

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**fadedblue09** (8): I love it, but it does sound like a holdover from Infinity on High, so I sorta get why it was cut from the standard edition.

**modulum83** (8): oddly exuberant for a song with such bleak lyrics

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.6): “it’s three drinks too late to talk to anyone but myself” very relatable lyric

**bbfan132** (7): i liked the vocals here and it sounded fine but i probably wouldn’t choose to listen to it that often

**poptartchill** (7): Spotify when Mr. Out Boy?

**seanderlust\_** (7): I'm three drinks too late to talk to anyone but myself...is a mood. Not a good one, but a mood


####**The way Patrick Stump sings the word 'mirror'**

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): never understood why they put this on thr album when West Coast Smoker would've been such a great closer

**Verdantshade** (6): so... this is the first time I've ever heard this song, I literally had no idea this existed. it's alright but there isn't the nostalgia factor which is there for the rest of folie :(

**kirby31200** (5): I understand why it's not on the regular version. I wish the Beat It cover was included in the rate.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I’m not really a fan of the lyrics… or the chanting… or how slow it is…

**pig-serpent** (4): Chorus is good, verses are meh, the "oh oh" part is awful.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i never actually heard this song before this rate and uhm. wasn’t missing much

**Mysario** (9.9): this is a demo? This is one of the tightest sounding demos of a song you could ask for! It really feels like a “A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out” deep cut… in fact, it is. Supposedly. As a huge fan of AFYCSO, it’s no wonder this is one of my fave songs on Panic’s side of the rate. It hits hard with its guitars, the drums go hard, and the chorus is wicked catchy.. The harmonizing Brendon does with himself sounds so good, even if it’s so goofy. I’m kind of scared to hear what a fully realized version would sound like, would it be worse? Better? The world may never know.

---

####**Bonus tracks > Regular tracks**

**jolteonhoodie** (10): Should have been on the album

**twat\_brained** (10): this is what Panic! SHOULD sound like.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): This definitely seems like a track that could fit well on their first album, I kinda love it tho

**anothertown** (9): they call this a demo but it sounds fully finished except for that bridge, what is the truth?

**poptartchill** (9): This is my favorite of the bonus tracks. I really love the lyrics and the instrumental. I'd sing along to this in the car if it were on spotify :(

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): if this is what this sounds like as a demo i would love to hear what a finished version of it would sound like

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.2): yeah this slaps

**conceptualromance** (8): I like the lyrics of this one

**seanderlust\_** (8): I have a feeling that if this song had gotten a little more refinement, it would have gotten my 11

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.8): the production on this (considering its a demo) its so enjoyable

**modulum83** (7.7): chorus is kind of lopsided and poorly written, but "if i wake in the morning i only need 2 more miracles to be a saint" is a golden line

**1998tweety** (7.5): erm what is that beat shes eating a bit

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): calling this a demo as if the production here isn’t better than half the album

**bbfan132** (7): a pretty good song but i can see why it’s just a demo - it feels kind of unremarkable

**duhchappers** (7): it doesn’t surprise me at all that this is only a demo, there’s definitely some potential here but it does not come together into a cohesive whole at all. Gains some points for sheer insanity, a cleaned up version would be super good

**milkywayinradius** (7): some interesting parts, but also kind of a mess all together

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I like how hard this goes! Very different compared to the rest of the album

####**Lately it seems like everybody's sick, everybody's dying**


**kirby31200** (6): Not bad but not great. I don't like the bridge

**pig-serpent** (6): Ooh, I... that bridge isn't my thing, at all. The rest of this is good, fits in with the strech from tracks 2-4

**skargardin** (6): for being a demo this is pretty fleshed out lmao but still pretty average

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (5.4): - Damn, this one did not age well.

**bespectacIed** (5): Not this Potential Breakup Song tribute

**engifear** (5): The production and transitions on this are... pretty odd (I'll see myself out)

**fadedblue09** (4): Waste of time. Next!

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): cobra starship called and they want their sound back

**Mysario** (9): I was almost shocked that this went out on Day 1, but then I remembered y'all hate slow songs. It's a classic cheesy song but the lyrics are overall way more despairing, lamenting on her past and using it as a base that her love for this person changed her frame of mind. It's really well done! Meanwhile, Chad Gilbert is playing songs about making sure to wear your seatbelt (never forget!), so who really came out on top here? Also reminder that the Glee cover was in the almost iconic Britney Spears themed episode for some reason.

**CarlieScion** (6): I cannot listen to this song without thinking of the Glee cover, which was - as usual - terrible. The original isn't much better. The lyrics feel both very insincere and immature to me. Musically, this could honestly have been an early Taylor Swift song, and I'm not saying that as a compliment. It's just very plain and average in an album filled with bops.

---

####**Bless your brave souls**

**bespectacIed** (11): In an album full of classics, I really am giving my 11 to the most (unfairly) hated paramore song and the song that will have the most 0s in this rate lmao. Anyways, sl0w painful d4@th to everyone who's gonna give this a low score. Hating this song about hope after lifelong cynicism is a sign of worms for brains. Yeah that includes hayley herself, fuck ha! You see I have a soft spot for the emo genre because it reminds me of younger years and simpler times ... but ultimately, the genre is just that to me, fodder for nostalgia. Only one song escaped the nostalgia goggles and stayed with me until adulthood... and it's \*literally\* the only exception. The 10-dollar mv where hayley metaphorically escaped her present, lived through her progressive stages of disillusionment about love, then reversed it all back to go back to the \*one\* sure thing in her life --- cinematic excellence. Hayley repeating the words "you are the only exception" throughout the song as if it's a reinforcive mantra for her cynical, still disbelieving heart that finally found something worth holding on to --- religious experience. It's the perfect stripped down song with a satisfying climax, but truly it's the song's cheesy message that will forever stick with me. The idea that someone or something could make sense of this fucked up world for you, it's so comforting; it makes you sane. Even if you haven't had it yet, or thought you had but you didn't after all (poor hayley 😭 fuck his ex hubby), believing on it is the only thing we could do, there's no other option goddamnit!!! Prepubescent me took all dat crap to heart, and a decade worth of human connections later, adult me is still on my way to believing.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): yes I'm basic. No I will not apologize.

####**Taylor SwiftTM**

**waluigiest** (10): I was ready to come in and clown on this song but..... I actually really like it. I mean this in the best way possible but it has huge early Taylor Swift energy. With the tender familial verses, simple guitar, and huge bridge, it nails that genre with a great Paramore flavor. Their versatility as a band is incredible.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): I mean this sounds like a good Taylor Swift song but its sound isn’t really what I look to Paramore for y’know


####**This is Good, actually**

**agentofscranton** (10): this is a good song idc what y'all say

**bbfan132** (10): this is so sweet :uwu: :gaycat2:

**Leixander** (10): yes, it is cheesy. so what??? it works!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I know Hayley hates this song now, mostly because of who it was written about, but sorry, this song is just too good to hate. I love everything about it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Oh boy here it is. The big one. Well I will NOT let any of Hayley’s own negative experiences cloud my opinion of this song… which is that it’s one of my favorite Paramore songs period! There’s something that I just find so powerful about claiming that your romantic feelings are strong and real enough to outweigh all of the tragedies and fear in your life. Sadly, Hayley’s relationship turned out not to be true, but her love WAS true, and so is my love for this song.

**Verdantshade** (10): first of all, fuck all paramore fans who don't like this song because hayley doesn't. there's a lot on this album that makes my all time lists and this is up there for favourite love songs of all time. my feelings on love have gone from idealism to scepticism but how I've felt about this song has never changed - there's a sincerity and hopefulness to it that not even the tragic context can erase

**1998tweety** (9): this was the only song i knew going into the rate, shes cute

**anothertown** (9): I remembered this having a lot more yelling and belting and huge chorus than it actually does, and it’s nice for not having much of that. Idc.

**duhchappers** (9): I know context has ruined this one for a lot of people but I never connected it to Hayley’s personal life that much so I’m still totally down for this

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is a bop but I really hope this doesn’t win cause it’ll once again be the most predictable winner for an Emo Rate.

**kirby31200** (9): Beautiful. Hits different after her most recent breakup.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i don't love this as much as i did as a teen but its still a GOOD song and ppl who say it isn't have never been in love

**TiltControls** (9): I don't hate the song as much as I used to. That being said, I still have no idea why this was made a single (and got so popular)

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I like this song but it’s shrunk on me a bit over time

**poptartchill** (8.5): This was the only non Britney Spears song covered in Glee's first Britney Spears episode

**fadedblue09** (8.4): It’s still lovely tbh. I probably would’ve rated this higher if we were rating it as a standalone, but as an album track, I don’t think it fits with the album’s themes, and it feels more of a Hayley song than a Paramore song tbh.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.2): i love a good heartbreaking song

**modulum83** (7.5): I love Yellow by Coldplay

**fifteensunflwrs** (7): it deserves at least a 9, but i always think about how much hayley hates this song because it's about a guy who instead of being the only exception, ended up being the thing that proves the rule...so I can't listen without cringing sorry

**pig-serpent** (7): Yeah this song is super basic but lyrically I really like this song. There's something about the arc of "love doesn't exist but I'm falling in love anyway" that I find compelling. The bridge goes a long way in spicing the song up too.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): so, uhm

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7): one of the weakest songs on the album ngl but still great

####**Hayley told me she hates this, so now I hate this**

**hikkaru** (6): i don't hate it but hayley made some points in pretending this does not exist

**Roxieloxie** (6): im balladphobic again im sorry

**conceptualromance** (5): Ive never been a big fan of this song, especially when it was covered on Glee

**letsallpoo** (5): my first year spanish teacher in high school made us learn a version of this song but with the lyrics substituted with spanish words for family members and for a test he made us write down his lyrics from memory. and i knew all the vocabulary words but didnt care enough to learn how the lyrics to his song went so i didnt do too well. anyway this song is kinda boring

**seanderlust\_** (5): Lyrically cheesy but musically sweet.

**twat\_brained** (5): this is also a rather big exception as to Paramore songs I enjoy hearing. Taylor did this better on folklore

**CactusWithinUs** (4): There was a comment on the genius page of this song that said "I'm getting coldplay vibes from this" and i think that explains my rating

**intheaftermath** (4): I’m so sick of this song that I almost instinctively skipped it. It’s nice I guess, but it’s just not where Paramore shines.

**ktajlili** (3): kind of a classic but ...uhhh

**astrologicalangel** (2): I can see where this is coming from but it doesn’t have any effect on me

**jolteonhoodie** (2): Ugh

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): it just doesn't work on a lot of levels for me

**cremeebrulee** (0): it’s what hayley would’ve wanted <3

**grinchelda** (0): i hated this song when it came out and i still hate it now

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): its 2020 can we stop pretending this song is good and just admit its boring and generic as hell

####**I was there for you in your darkest times**

**DraculaWeekend** (0): I'd rather listen to Maroon 5's "Maps"

**Mysario** (8): It’s a pretty catchy song from start to finish - however, I’d say it’s probably the biggest outlier in the album lyrically. It feels like there was an idea to make a catchy tune but they had no idea what to actually say, which is fine, but it sticks out more so than the rest of the tracks.

####**Winona Ryder**

**anothertown** (10): “hell or glory, I don’t want anything in between” :screams in myspace bio:

**Roxieloxie** (10): HELL OR GLORY I DONT WANT ANYTHING INBETWEENNNNN

**bbfan132** (9): stan harmonies

**conceptualromance** (9): showing the world the thunder

**modulum83** (9): i love the funky retro vibes on this. i literally feel nostalgic for an era of music i wasn't even alive for.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): this song is funky, i love how aggressive the drums are, and it's just so pleasant to listen to for some reason.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Judging Fall Out Boy songs is hard… Usually when I listen to songs I place heavy emphasis on lyrics and if they’re stupid/meaningless then it affects my percepetion of the whole song. But I don’t know, whenever I hear something like this that sonically sounds amazing, I just kinda give up on lyrical analysis and WOO YEAH THE THUNDERRRR

**grinchelda** (8.7): i'll take hell and glory thx

**duhchappers** (8): somehow the only song on the album I had heard all the way through before this rate, and its just a very good song

**poptartchill** (8): I definitely overplayed this song at some point in my life but it still rocks. The chorus (especially the final chorus with the key change) is so good

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): catchy and the final chorus goes off

**twat\_brained** (8): something about thunder? I hope Mrs. Judd appreciated this

**Verdantshade** (8): oooohh oh ohh oooooooh oho hHOHOhoHOHo oHHHHHHHHhh oHhhho oooOOOHHh

**Leixander** (7.5): bonus half point for the way the vocalist said thunder

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i just think its cute they wrote a song about pete’s son

**1998tweety** (7): this doesnt do anything for me tbh

**rickikardashian** (7): there’s so much in here that i should be loving….. and it just doesnt click with me

**waluigiest** (7): rolling up to the 6th gym in Hoenn


####**Winona Oak**


**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): this one never really clicked with me the way the others did, it feels almost a bit too light and breezy compared to the rest of the album’s bombast

**jolteonhoodie** (6): This is a very meh chorus

**kirby31200** (6): It's fine

**sandyfishnets** (6): loving the drums and overall production on this track, all the beat changes keep it super interesting

**seanderlust\_** (6): Nicki Minaj voice This what I do when a bitch breaks flock Patrick Stump second verse voice BA DA BA BA DA BA DA BA BA DA

**pig-serpent** (5): This song makes me feel nothing. Should've listened to daddy.

**fadedblue09** (1): The chorus sucks and the whole song is corny AF. If I didn't stan them, this would be a zero contender. One of their songs that I truly hate.

**Mysario** (9): I recognize that this is basically filler and Hayley just bragging about being a success while everyone else is a loser but Nostalgia^^TM hits me hard with this every time and I can't help but to bop to it anyways. This song is upbeat and a feel good moment for Hayley. We're so proud of her and her success (and I guess the others too)! 

**CarlieScion** (6): Once again, this is the filler portion of Brand New Eyes. However, the 'God knows the world doesn't need another band'-lyric makes me go feral. The fake fade-out is the only thing I usually recall from this song, which really tells you how bland it is.

---

####**This song is worth fighting for**

**bespectacIed** (10): Awww, such a bright, uplifting song. Love the humility, gratitude, and self-awareness... "god knows the world doesn't need another band but what a waste it would have been" lmaooo they spilled. I too, am happy that they crossed the world while it's asleep and became the legendary band that they are. P.S. THAT SNEAKY EXTRA FINAL CHORUS ... iconic.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): this is such a fun song, i love it so much

**fifteensunflwrs** (9): it's a shame this song is sandwiched between very similar songs but it is a BOP.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): i like that it doesn't mind being sparse at points, like the lyrics, and it reminds me of a DCOM movie song

**Verdantshade** (9): I CAN'T BELIEVE WE ALMOST HUNG IT UP WOOAOAOH talk about a hell of a fake out

**twat\_brained** (8.6): this ended before it began

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.3): probably my least favourite song on the album but it highlights the strength of the album thats its still over an 8

**duhchappers** (8): another really good song

**RandomHypnotica** (8): I hate the fake-out with the song sounding like it's gonna end but then SURPRISE! It doesn't!!

**waluigiest** (8): they’d better be paying the drummer overtime

####**So middling that nobody actually hated it**

**1998tweety** (7): filler but decent [2]

**pig-serpent** (7): A tad generic but it has a nice punch to it and it has a cool bridge.

**poptartchill** (7): this is sweet and I love the energy! Almost like a time capsule

**rickikardashian** (7): this is a rockier disney channel show song

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Idk, I always thought this sounded lazy, even for them. Reminds me a lot of RIOT! (their weakest album, don’t @ me).

**kirby31200** (6): I'm a sucker for "I'm living my dream and it feels great" songs. But would it have killed them to write a few more lyrics? Pretty repetitive

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The intro makes this sound like an extension to Feeling Sorry lol… It’s an alright song I guess… but the way she sings “I CAN’T BELIEVE WE ALMOST HUNG IT UP” is kinda annoying tbh

**conceptualromance** (5.6): one of the weakest songs on the album but the way the song ends and then comes back is great

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.6): another song that is just...there for me

**modulum83** (5.5): i love the idea behind this song but it's just...too loud i'm sorry

**seanderlust\_** (5): Rupaul voice Meh.

**Mysario** (7.5): Much like W.A.M.S., the verses are fun then - 3, 2, 1 - the chorus feels like it's just there and super unexciting. Somehow, that in itself brings the whole song down for me. I remember the first time I heard that bridge part, I was like "I recognize this goofball!" 10 years later, this incredibly useful ability came in handy when The Robot came out on stage singing "Are You Gonna Go My Way?"

**CarlieScion** (5): Pavlove does the oh-oh-oh-oh hook much better. This feels weirdly mixed and low-quality even in modern streaming format. This song has a lot of build up for what ends up being nothing to me. The 'little black dress/mess'-line files so tired. 

---

####**Lil Wayne - Tha Carter III**

**conceptualromance** (10): the prechorus of this one is so good

**fadedblue09** (10): Another personal favorite of mine! This one feels like a fusion of R&B and pop-punk and god, Patrick's delivery on the chorus makes me weak (he'll explore more of this sound later in Soul Punk). Let's just hope the rap-phobes don't drag this one.

**jolteonhoodie** (10): Surprise Lil Wayne! And somehow it works super well

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): unironically lil wayne’s best song

**Verdantshade** (10): I almost deducted a point for the lil wayne autotune but this has one of my favourite choruses of any fall out boy song. I also used to think patrick was singing 'I'm not a crap baby.. I'm the crap, baby' and I still get a giggle out of it

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): not me not realizing Lil Wayne was on the bridge until 2020…

**grinchelda** (9.5): i'm a big (big!) hot mess

**ktajlili** (9): Tiffany blew me away

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.8): this song has the added bonus of me being able to understand patrick's pronunciation

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): The bridge kinda kills the vibe but I really like it otherwise

**modulum83** (8.5): lowkey i could twerk hard to this song

**ggal2020** (8.2): “dear gravity you held me down in this starlight city” is an all time great emo lyric

**CactusWithinUs** (8): always taken aback by Surprise Lil Wayne

**poptartchill** (8): I particularly love the backing vocals/harmonies in this one.

**seanderlust\_** (8): I'm not a crybaby. I'm the crybaby. MOOD AF.

**1998tweety** (7.5): this was cute but then that weird talking bit tanked it

**anothertown** (7.5): the fully sung weezy verse is very galaxy brained

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): “i’m THE crybaby” this energy >>>>

**twat\_brained** (7.4): It certainly sounds good, I'm just lost on the song's meaning

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): Lil wayne really was showing up just everywhere in 2008 huh? surprised he didn’t end up on a susan boyle album or something too


####**Melanie Martinez - Crybaby**


**duhchappers** (6): the album is getting kinda tiring at this point tbh

**intheaftermath** (6): I love the dress imagery but outside of that it still blurs with its neighbors.

**kirby31200** (6): I'm used to indecipherable Fall Out Boy lyrics but there's only so much I can take. I should be at least able to tell what the song's about. The bridge isn't awful but it's not what I want from FOB

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Back when I didn’t have Spotify premium it used to play this song over and over… It’s difficult to separate that experience from my actual opinion of the song, but I think it’s alright.

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): i loved this song when i originally heard it, but upon reflection, it's a bit up it's own ass at points and it degrades in quality.

**pig-serpent** (4): It's okay I guess but I just don't feel this one.
