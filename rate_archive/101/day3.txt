The Emo Rate 1.5 Day 3 - Sometimes I Wanna Quit This All And Become an r/Music Subscriber Now
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/iwimvz/the_emo_rate_15_day_3_sometimes_i_wanna_quit_this/

Hola, mis amores! 

Today's reveal will begin at **3PM EST**, where songs #15 to 1 will be joyously celebrated by a hoard of bottoms, switches and tops. [Come join us in the **plug.dj**, where we will be listening to these bops as they go out!](https://plug.dj/popheads/)

Some stats and fun facts before the show gets on the road:

* 77 people did the rate! That's one whole more person than my previously hosted rate - the Charity Rate. We like nostalgic pop punk more than community-chosen songs 4 charity!

* The average score is 7.620, so y'all actually think most of these songs pretty good!

* On the other side, the average controversy is 1.868, so any songs with higher controversy than this should be considered highly controversial.

* Todays fun fact is that I'm getting a grocery deliver sometime in the next hour! Exciting stuff, I know.

---

Songs left in the rate:

#~~Fall Out Boy - Folie A Deux~~


#~~Panic! at the Disco - Vices & Virtues~~


#Paramore - Brand New Eyes

* **Brick by Boring Brick**

McIgglyTuffMuffin: > What A Catch, Donnie

I'm sitting here watching LA Rams vs Philadelphia Eagles and now I'm really curious if there are any wide receivers or tight ends in the NFL with the first name Donnie.


edit: there is a college player for Texas Southern named Donnie Corley, close enough.

**Mysario** (8.5): While I could see why a lot of people don’t like this, there’s a certain rockabilly charm to this track that always made me dig it. The sardonic lyrics drive home a point of selfishness that people inadvertently employ. Sadly, the song's bridge feels like it tried to mimic “This Ain’t a Scene” too much and I think that’s where it really falls short (also if you’re not into this sound either). The guitar solo is p cool tho

**CarlieScion** (6): This song simultaneously annoys me and makes me feel like a bad bitch. Like, you can't NOT feel like you own the entire world when you listen to this. However, musically this song is just not IT. I hate Patrick's low-tone vocals, they always makes me feel like he's trying to be annoying on purpose. 

---

####**You are the boss bitch**

**ImADudeDuh** (11): This song makes me feel like I’m not very self conscious and I’m the coolest bitch ever and sometimes I really need that.

####**Heat wave in your pants**

**astrologicalangel** (10): wow this instantly brought me back to my FOB phase

**cremeebrulee** (10): ohhh shit i didn’t know that this song was off this album

**ignitethephoenix** (10): love the transition from the previous song (edit: loves how smoothly this album flows together). Also I definitely heard this song before but had no clue this was Fall Out Body

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I used to have the line “let december glow in flames” as the title for my Fall Out Boy tumblr sideblog so yeah this was never getting anything less than a ten from me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): As a kid when I first heard this, I remember I didn't like it as much as the older songs, but revisiting it now, it really does hold up well huh. I do still think it could be a bit more interesting melodically however

**Roxieloxie** (10): Green Day Voice I dont care if you dont i dont care if you dont i dont care if you dont care

**skargardin** (10): a classic!!

**anothertown** (9): this is going to get robbed.. sad!

**intheaftermath** (9): Defined my rebellious phase against my parents if I’m being honest

**static\_int\_husp** (9): fun fact - I know how to play this song on the trombone

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i always forget how enjoyable this song and tbh it deserved more chart success

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the music video for this is iconic you can’t change my mind

**poptartchill** (8.5): I find this song to be very freeing

**1998tweety** (8): she's cute

**bbfan132** (8): fun song! very catchy

**fifteensunflwrs** (8): the official music video of this song is a very wild ride

**pig-serpent** (8): Strong chorus, solid riff with a nice tone, and Stump's having fun with this one. It's a solid song but I hate the way he sings "misery."

**twat\_brained** (8): Was a 10 from me but I saw S•••• P•••• in the video so I sadly cannot give it a full endorsement, which I really want to because this has quickly become one of my top 5 FOB songs

**waluigiest** (8): I’m not a huge Fall Out Boy fan but this is nostalgic for me in a way I wasn’t expecting

**modulum83** (7.5): honestly the attitude on this song has never really been all that convincing to me. suuuuuure you don't care what i think uh huh

####**Hope you find your happiness in this misery**

**seanderlust\_** (6): I think I liked this song better when I didn't understand the lyrics and just knew it as a bop with that Communist MV tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Probably my least favorite of Fall Out Boy’s lead singles (pre-Mania of course). BUT having listened to the lyrics again I can respect some of the cleverness of it. It’s just that some of the lyrics are also kinda dumb (“Heat wave in ya pants!”)

**conceptualromance** (5): I Don’t Care about this song

**duhchappers** (4): decent production and a good melody but just totally obnoxious lyrics keeps me from really ever wanting to hear it again

**fadedblue09** (3): I love FOB, but social commentary ain't for them, unfortunately.

####**We love the Earth, it is our planet**

**bespectacIed** (0): most annoying song in existence i think

**Mysario** (9): What a GREAT opener, coming out smoking hot! The drama behind this song with one of its best lyrics makes it even better. 

**CarlieScion** (7): How this got this far, I don't know. It's mid-tier Brand New Eyes, which again is mid-tier Paramore (to me). There are like 6 other songs on this album that does this exact song better than this song.

---

####**Dives in the deep end of the pool**

**bespectacIed** (10): Whew this is how you open an album full of collapses --- with a huge collapse right away. The lyrics are so powerful, you can really see the maturity from Riot era. \*"The truth never set me free so I did it myself"\*  --- 13 year old me really thought that was shakespearean. 23 y/o me still does tbf

**jolteonhoodie** (10): This was such a sleeper song for me. It didn't start as one of my favourites but every time I heard it I loved it a little more

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is my favorite opener in this rat

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): my high school motto was "the truth will set you free" and when this song came out everyone (including me) tried to be super edgy with THE TRUTH NEVER SET ME FREE bc we were rEaL emo's

**conceptualromance** (9.7): you really can’t be too careful anymore

**grinchelda** (9): truth is overrated

**Verdantshade** (9): tbt josh farro's rant about 'the truth never set me free so I did it myself' lmao

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Hayley's right. I need to stop being careful about how I write my songs

**bbfan132** (8.5): these power chords…

**fadedblue09** (8.5): "The truth never set me free, so I did it myself" ah yes, the blasphemous lyric that unraveled the band's internal feud. When you think about it, it's the perfect opener for this era and the drama that will entail.

**pig-serpent** (8): A good album opener choice as it fits the theme of the album while still being enough like Riot to ease in older fans. It's a good song, but it feels a little standard for Paramore.

**poptartchill** (8): very strong opener! It's true you can't be too careful anymore especially in this pandemic

**seanderlust\_** (8): An energetic opener. Hayley's voice sounds very strained though.

**waluigiest** (8): I love this introduction to the album so much. The loose drumming at the back half of the chorus…. Taste

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): good but kind of generic

**1998tweety** (7): shes screaming a little too much for me

**duhchappers** (7): good opener, the instrumental bridge was my favorite part

**kirby31200** (7): Man all of these albums have great openers

**modulum83** (7): i can just imagine so many teens drawing animatics of their favorite shows to this song

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): sounds very christian alternative rock but i'm down

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Well, this is a very loud and angry introduction! But Hayley is great at being loud and angry, so of course it sounds amazing!

####**Wears water wings in the kiddie pool**

**ktajlili** (6.5): I don’t mind this song, but I don’t feel like the music and lyrics work well together and Haley’s voice sounds a lot better on other tracks.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.1): the guitar is the best part of this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): sounds like a first draft

**anothertown** (4): very generic?

**CarlieScion** (10): Stream Closer by The Chainsmokers and Halsey. Also this is a GREAT song and y'all suck!

**Mysario** (10): I don't think FOB was trying to hide they were trying to make a bombtastic song here on purpose. Like, there's 2 verses that are different, and then 4 lines sang throughout. That's not at all a bad thing! In fact, it's done perfectly here. The lyrics play second fiddle behind the instruments and the energy they bring to the table. The drums, the strings, the guitar work - it's all beautiful *chef's kiss*! The vocals drive up that energy alllllll the way up there and then we get this anthem!

---

####**Kick drum beating in your chests**

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): it’s been about 2 years since i’ve heard this song and after listening to it on repeat for an hour and crying at least twice i’ve come to the conclusion this is the greatest song ever created

**fadedblue09** (10): An ANTHEM. Vocal king Patrick Stump come through!

**Lizardman469** (10): My choice for maybe the most quintessential Fall Out Boy song

**pig-serpent** (10): Arguably FoB's cheesiest song (it ends like the can can) but it pulls it off fantastically and centering the song's arrangement on a string section and a snare drum make the song wholey unique and not sounding like mud.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is so anthemic and fun and passionate and everything i love about pop punk emo

**TiltControls** (10): was very, very close to getting my 11. Definitely my favourite on the album

**grinchelda** (9.8): dear people that go to concerts and spend the whole time recording it for snap

**conceptualromance** (9.5): the orchestral element really adds a lot to the song and elevates it

**twat\_brained** (9.3): me when conservatives are elected lol

**bespectacIed** (9): I WILL NEVER BELIEVE IN ANYTHING AGAAAIIIIiiiIIIIN

**poptartchill** (9): The best way to experience this song is by screaming along to it in a car. But it's a jam regardless.

**skargardin** (9): the way I read this as coffee's for losers at first and was ready to fight

**Verdantshade** (9): this is the definition of overindulgence but it WORKS. I'll never really understand the order of the album though as this, the shipped gold standard and what a catch feel like the 3 closing songs

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): strings!

**cremeebrulee** (8): i dig the strings at the end

**duhchappers** (8): I really enjoy this one, Patrick gives a great performance and the outro is very nice.

**Roxieloxie** (8): yeah this is a mid 2000s fall out boy song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): .5 what a great chorus but i'm still waiting for change to come

####**Mayhem > Love**

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute but long

**plvstvcbvrds** (7): i like it, but i also feel like i'm being yelled at.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I don’t think this song is as deep as the strings make it out to be

####**W̸̼͛̐̚E̵̗̠̊̈́ ̸̨̤̘͕̒̋̍̽ͅW̶̛̖͈̹̫̘̜̆̒͜Ĩ̵̳͐͘Ḷ̵̦̈́̽̿L̴̥̰͈̪͛͗̐̑̑͘ ̵͉̹̦̺̓N̶̡̾̒̊́̏͘Ĕ̴̠̅͑̈́͐͝V̶̫̳͕͎̋̔̉̑͘͠È̴̛͎̬̪̪Ṙ̶̡̮̟̻̤̫ ̴͕̝͚̠̮̬̋B̴̢̛̜̫̜͔̟̩͐̀̆E̶̢̹̫͍̦̖̰͑Ĺ̵̢͒̕Ȉ̵͉̥͎̇E̶̗͛V̸̡͙̭̻̮͂͊͒̈́͜ͅẸ̸͎̩́̑̆͒͒ ̴̡̧͐A̸̘͎͈̅̒͛̈́̑̒̈́G̷̢͖͉͑͋Á̸̹̝̤̗̖̳̏͋͗͐̉͒I̸̤̥͔̰͙̜͊̅́̽N̷̘͋**

**Mysario** (10): This is my 3rd favourite song in the rate and it was absolutely done dirty being placed this low! However, them haters don't take away from the song's quality. The chorus is an unfortunate but relatable anthem to the people who would listen to it. It's all a very well done ballad that's driven hard by the piano. It all builds upon itself as the song goes on until we get hit crescendo with all the guest stars singing back old FOB singles as well as the oft forgotten "Growing Up". These guests include

Elvis Costello, 

Gabe Saporta (of Cobra Starship and Midtown), 

Travie McCoy (of Gym Class Heroes),

Brendon Urie (of Panic! at the Disco), 

Doug Neumann (band manager lol),

Alexander DeLeon (of The Cab), and 

William Beckett (of The Academy Is...) - what a list!

The MV also includes a myriad of references to old FOB videos and tracks and AAAAAA! Call it fan service if you want, but this song was unintentionally a nice send-off to FOB before their hiatus and remains as an unforgettable staple in their catalog to this very day. Unlike... *checks notes* ... The Mighty Fall.

####**Captains of the Sinking Ship**

**astrologicalangel** (11): the reprises of their old songs ALWAYS get to me

**engifear** (11): This should have been the album closer. I will die mad.

**ggal2020** (11): this song makes me ball my eyes out.

**kirby31200** (11): Pure fanservice. The high stakes emotional climax of pop punk. A religious experience. This really hit different during the hiatus

####**Decaydance frontmen singing the fan service bits**

**agentofscranton** (10): i should see a therapist

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This song deserves a 10 just for being so nostalgic with the lyric call-backs and features, even Brendon's (off-key?) "Dance, Dance."

**fifteensunflwrs** (10): i think my 10 is mostly for the nostalgia i feel when i listen to this song and remember my weird emo phase....

**grinchelda** (10): this balladphobia i hear so much about better not show up here

**jolteonhoodie** (10): It's always weirded me out that this song is in the middle of the album. The general vibe and the references to previous singles makes it seem like the perfect album closer

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this should have been the last song on the album

**Roxieloxie** (10): Yes it's a ballad yes im giving it a 10 what about it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): autotunned baby crying

**waluigiest** (10): What a glorious, beautiful song. The interpolation of their older songs in the bridge is mixed so well and it’s INCREDIBLE

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): that key change!!!

**conceptualromance** (9.6): I love the callbacks to previous songs so much

**modulum83** (9.5): god, maybe it is worth it to keep on going. fuck i feel like doing something with my life

**poptartchill** (9.5): The way they so explicitly call back to their biggest hits is so good and I always thought of it as theatrical in a way?

**CactusWithinUs** (9): The reprises in the outro are genius

**fadedblue09** (9): It just sank in if they never reunited after the hiatus, this song would’ve taken on an extra bittersweet meaning.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): I like the little call-outs to their older songs, but overall I wish the song was a bit more interesting. Also it feels like way more of a closer, it's a strange choice to have it in the middle of the album

**anothertown** (8.5): Pete literally wishes he were a Donny Hathaway caliber writer, he cannot even spell his name right. Anyway, I’m not going to get into the Donny & Roberta symbolism because I will embarrass myself. The part where all of their friends come in singing the songs from the eras when their bands debuted was just one aspect of this song that rocked my shit in 2008

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.2): it’s a song for the fans...literally

**pig-serpent** (8): I'm always unsure whether or not I like recalling other songs in this one, but I suppose it works on the based that the rest of this song is good.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.3): this is such a satisfying song to belt out

####**Patrick Stump having to sing Elvis Costello's part on the Greatest Hits version**

**twat\_brained** (7.1): the self-indulgent references to better FOB singles just ruins this for me. Why do stans love this so much??

**bbfan132** (7): parts of this were nice but certain sections sounded off? some of the singers should’ve been cut ngl

**cremeebrulee** (7): am i tripping or has the lyric “i’m not gonna end up like him” been a recurring line in this album

**duhchappers** (7): they really sold me on the anxiety and emotion. Not really sure the last minute is particularly necessary though

**1998tweety** (6.5): im sleeping, the reference to their older songs are cute tho

**rickikardashian** (6.5): is the sugar we’re going down interpolation like when rappers get their first big hit and reference in at least 10 guest verses

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I only started listening to Fall Out Boy during the ABAP era, so I feel like this song doesn’t really mean much to me as opposed to if I were a fan since the early days

**bespectacIed** (3): Yeah FOB thought they did sumn with that Les Miserables - One Day More-esque reprise with all the cameos ... NO, IT WAS CRINGEY AND SELF INDELGENT AS FUCKKK 😭 Shame because this song is kinda beautiful without it, i love the roberta flack reference, and the chorus is topnotch

**Verdantshade** (3): fall out boy fan sacrilege but this is honestly one of my least favourite pre-hiatus songs. I don't have any problem with their ballads (golden is great), but if coffee's for closers was overindulgence done right, this is it done wrong. there is nothing that merits the reprises in the song and I'm always wanting the song to just.. end

**seanderlust\_** (2): This is gonna be a long-ass comment and I'm not sorry. Here's my problem with this song. FOB tends to keep the subjects of their songs at an emotional distance, to the point where it feels like the lyrics are the narrator in a film noir movie. That's how they get away with some of their campier lyrics ("the best part of believe is the lie"; "I can't commit to a thing, be it heart or hospital") and overdramatic delivery (think "You're Crashing, But You're No Wave" or "My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark"). Normally, that's what gives cohesion to these songs. However, this song is about a suicide attempt. I think such a heavy subject matter and FOB's compositional style are either incompatible, or it is an incredibly difficult needle to thread. Either way, FOB's larger-than-life presence on this song (the strings, couplets about God, historical references, interpolations of past songs) undercut the emotional vulnerability of the subject. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

**Mysario** (11): wow, I DO want to live life with a new perspective! I have such a history with this song and the surprisingly good movie that it’s from (stan Jennifer’s Body). I won’t get too much into it here for super personal reasons BUT just know they’re pretty positive at its core. I think? Anyways, it definitely became a Summer anthem for me at the time with its feel good vibes and general optimism. It’s not deep in any way, but it's a good reminder that it’s always good to see life from a new perspective when you can! Yea, the song is probably about sex, but really, isn’t every song about sex?

---

####**knows 'Jennifer's Body' is one of the best movies of the 00's**

**leachianusgeck** (11): it slaps so hard its so damn catchy

**agentofscranton** (10): the greatest day of my life was when this showed up on spotify out of nowhere and i streamed it like 50 times in a row god bless

**anothertown** (10): iconic summer banger. I remember hearing this song, crisp and bright and absolutely full of hooks, and being excited for what brendon would do with his music career, and of course there was no other option except for it to have been a mess

**bespectacIed** (10): Nearly my 11. Outside Jennifer's Body being the most culturally important horror film of the 21st century and New Perspective being a perfect soundtrack to it, I think this is still my fave Panic song ever. This song sounds and feels like good high school memories

**ggal2020** (10): a cultural reset.

**grinchelda** (10): subtle

**modulum83** (10): i am skipping the d i s c o u r s e around this song to say that it's just very very catchy and bright and fun to listen to and i never get tired of it

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): clouded by nostalgia but who cares

**Roxieloxie** (10): this isnt on the album but its the best song on the album

**twat\_brained** (10): not sold on watching Jennifer's Body yet but if there's a movie whose soundtrack I'd wanna be attached to this one's certainly one of them

**Verdantshade** (10): js but brendon needs to stop writing about partying and go back to writing love songs

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): ty hafu for introducing me to a bop

**revolutionarycostume** (9.5): My love for Jennifer’s Body is probably influencing this score

**conceptualromance** (9): the Jennifer’s Body soundtrack remains superior

**fifteensunflwrs** (9): Jennifer's Body was a good movie, people are just tasteless

**ktajlili** (9): another classic

**seanderlust\_** (9): Brendon Urie is still horny on main

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): I watched Jennifer's Body last year on a whim without knowing about the cult following it developed and was really pleasantly surprised, it's honestly really quality and y'all should check it out. Oh I guess this is a song yeah, I don't really mind it either way, it feels closer to a Pretty Odd track in terms of sound

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.3): now everyone go watch jennifer’s body

**duhchappers** (8): did not know this was on spotify until this rate but I am very glad to learn

**hikkaru** (8): it bops well enough but i hate that line gsdsdf

**kirby31200** (8): I'm biased. The song isn't about sexual orientation in any way and yet I adopted it as my personal bi anthem in middle school.

**poptartchill** (8): Good song but hard to separate from the movie lmao. All I can picture when I listen to this song is Brendon and Spencer walking down a school hallway in sunglasses interspersed with clips from Jennifer's Body and I haven’t watched the music video in years.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this gets a whole extra point for jennifer's body in the MV

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (8): - A good, horny bop.

**1998tweety** (7): i wanna listen to this album from the perspective of someone who likes it

**bbfan132** (7): i need to watch jennifer’s body soon.

**engifear** (7): Jennifer's Body on the other hand gets a 10/10

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i’ll lowkey be disappointed if no one comments a big essay on Jennifer’s Body for this song.

####**saw 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows' in theaters**

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this is fine but the focus in these comments better be on reminding people how good jennifer’s body is and how much more attention it deserved

**TiltControls** (6.5): this just in - movie music videos are still weird to watch

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): “Can we fast forward til you go down on me” WHAT!! Umm other than that, it’s an alright song I suppose… But god that line does NOT fit the rest of this song

**astrologicalangel** (4): for some reason the line ‘can we fast forward to go down on me’ specifically gets on my nerves, but maybe that’s the point idk

**pig-serpent** (3): I would rarely use the word bland to desribe Panic at the Disco, but I have to use it here because this song sucks.

####**can't stop watching 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' on DVD**

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Based on the title, I was expecting a more meaningful song than what I got…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): why did yall hype this song up so much it kinda sucks

**CarlieScion** (11): I had a really tough time choosing an 11 for this rate, seeing as I love each album so much. I had multiple 11 options on every album, but in the end I chose this, because it goes awf, it has the theatricality I love in Fall Out Boy's music, it tells a fun story and it has a political edge! In the beginning of the rate scores coming in, this was actually stuck at #2 and #3, but it started to free-fall its way down here at the end of august. At one point it was a Day 2-song! What the fuck!!!

**Mysario** (10): When I saw TOP/P!ATD/FOB live many years ago, Brendon Urie came out for the brief moment they played this song and iiiiiiiiii yelped! I don't need to say much more - with the horns, harmonies, general composition - this is just an amazing song done perfectly start to finish. I love this outro too soooo much. Way better than Patrick Stump in the shower with the five knuckle shuffle!

---

####**Harmonizing with CarlieScion in the chorus**

**CactusWithinUs** (11): This song is everything i loved about this album finally culminating in a pretty perfect pop song. Patrick Actually Disappearing at the end is what kicks it up to an 11; the anti-climactic nature of it is very fitting for the album that preceded it

**milkywayinradius** (11): emo dream team

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): This song is exactly what I want from a Fall Out Boy song. A fun beat, an atmosphere that doesn’t take itself too seriously, a catchy melody that shows off Patrick’s Soul Voice©, metaphors that lend themselves to the meaning of the song, a song with an actual comprehensible MEANING (it’s about the Iraq War!). My favorite part is how in the bridge the line “the proof is on the television” gets cut short the second time to allude to tv censorship… or at least that’s how I always pictured it! So in summary: the best Brendon Urie song in the whole rate!

####**Blowing off steam with Mysario**

**bespectacIed** (10): CALL ME MR BENZEDRINE!!!!! Good god, this is a slayage. I love that this is the most theatrical and whimsical song in the album but it still sounds emotional. Patrick and brendon sound sooo gorgeous together, their adlibs legit make me cry. The brass section is melt-your-face gooooood. I actually dgaf if the song sucks ass, the horns and adlibs are enough to make me love this. Would've been my fave song on folie if it weren't for Pete's ramblings ruining the song

**engifear** (10): My partner didn't believe me when I told him this song is sung by Brendon Urie and Patrick Stump. He's convinced they're actually the same person.

**ggal2020** (10): panic! at the disco & fall out boy? and on a song that slaps this hard? hell yeah! it was so hard not to give this my 11

**grinchelda** (10): patrick and brendon going to town on the chorus is really something else

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Whew a bop

**jolteonhoodie** (10): AND I SAID, I SAAA--

**ktajlili** (10): the colab we’ve always wanted

**Verdantshade** (10): this was definitely a candidate for my 11, it's almost definitely my favourite fall out boy song. having a patrick/brendon duet is a dream and it's sooo catchy. ba ba ba ba benzendrine ba ba ba benzendrine... I feel like the 1975 really took a page out of their book here when writing upbeat, catchy songs about drug addiction

**waluigiest** (10): yes panic!

**DraculaWeekend** (9.5): I'm a sucker for horns.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Loving the cute retro-inspired instrumental. A bit ambivalent towards the execution of the socio-political commentary, but I'll forgive it because this is so fun.

**modulum83** (9.5): in this song, fall out boy evoke the tense malaise of american life in 2008 - taking aim at the health care industry, at the Iraq War, at cable news, and the opioid crisis - all in one upbeat ragtime tune. a spectacularly underrated song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): the song itself is only an 8 but the outro is so good i’ll bump it up

**anothertown** (9): This felt so fresh in 2008 and it really blew my wig back at the time. I still feel like it’s a highlight of their discography, but it’s a little dated. I kind of see it as a spinoff of the pre-Adele indie Britpop that was happening at the time. Oh no the outro :barf:

**poptartchill** (9): Brendon Urie said if Pete Wentz gets to sneak into Panic's part of the rate by writing parts of Vices and Virtues then Brendon gets to sneak into Fall Out Boy's part with this duet.

**1998tweety** (8): bop but again the outro drags it down

**intheaftermath** (8): A tad overrated, but still incredible. Brendon’s vocals really make it stand out, and it adds some much needed variety to the album.

**kirby31200** (8): (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! At the Disco). Would've been a 9 without Pete Wentz angsty beat poetry hour

**duhchappers** (7): this sounds exactly like a Panic! song on the chorus, but Patrick has slightly weird inflection. The production is a welcome change of pace though

**pig-serpent** (7): A bit of a weird change of pace, but it's very welcome. They decided to rip of Panic instead of the other way around, and they even invited Urie onto the track. Overall, I think Panic normally do this type of thing better but it's still a good song.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): not my fave but still a good song

####**Stray dogs outside with Mr. Benzedrine**

**ignitethephoenix** (7): was enjoying this song until the ending....what was that outro

**seanderlust\_** (6): Loved it until the last minute. Girl this slam poetry moment ain't it

**twat\_brained** (6): I share Pat's disillusionment with fame as I do with this album

**conceptualromance** (5.5): meh

####**Aaron Burr, sir**

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): this song sounds like it's from the hamilton mixtape and i mean that in the meanest way possible

**Mysario** (9.5): I love the inverse here of "loud funky verse / subdued slow chorus"! Like many songs on this record, FOB is able to crank out an amazing song that is fun to hear and makes a fantastic singalong... with words that really don't have any true meaning. But hey, it still slaps!

**CarlieScion** (9): And Fall Out Boy is down to a single song! This song is so FUNKY! The bass makes me feel things. I love that this gets a callback in What A Catch, Donnie. The "Tempest in a teacup / Get unique"-lyric makes me want to see this entire album performed live. Concerts, please come back.

---

####**Anything but a footnote**

**anothertown** (11): This song goes PLACES!! The crunchy guitar & drums contrasted against the horns. The huge bridge and how the final chorus releases the whole song’s tension. Artpop can mean anything

**jackisboredtoday** (11): i don’t know what the fuck these lyrics mean but i know this sounds fantastic

**jolteonhoodie** (11): This is the hardest 11 I've ever given! Every single other 10 I gave could have easily been my 11

**pig-serpent** (11): Wow. This feels like the culmination of everything FoB was trying to do on this album as well as Infinity on High and they really wrote something incredible.

**thebrandnew** (11): The best song FOB will ever write. Take THAT to your grave

####**Pete Rose's fellow unsung heroes**

**1998tweety** (10): this is a serve

**conceptualromance** (10): perfection

**CritneySpearz** (10): the bridge into final chorus takes me to another dimension, love it

**grinchelda** (10): does patrick know the way i worship his voice

**poptartchill** (10): This was the first song I got SUPER INTO from this album. Relistening for the first time in a while reminds me how good it is. Those lyrics? The instrumental? Flawless.

**seanderlust\_** (10): The transition from the last song to this one...Chromatica II/911 found dead. This is by far the best song on the album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i can’t find the edit someone made that’s just the i didn’t part on repeat for 3 minute just pretend i attached that as my comment for this

**Verdantshade** (10): DOES YOUR HUSBAND KNOW THE WAY... this is a sensational song. pete's lyrics aren't ridiculously pretentious and it retains their classic pop punk sound. I feel like after folie they lost the spark songs like this and this ain't a scene had

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): I love how over the top and melodramatic this whole song is, the dramatic shifts from full rock-out to Billy Joel-esque piano ballad, it's a rollercoaster

**DraculaWeekend** (9.5): If that last minute doesn't get you hype, I dunno what to tell you.

**kirby31200** (9): The low notes are equally impressive and goofy. The music video for this is irrelevant to the meaning of the track but still worth a watch. The four track stretch including and following this is amazing

**Leixander** (9): was not expecting this fine ass banger

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): one of my faves on the album, i love how cocky and experimental it is. also the horns are gorgeous.

**Roxieloxie** (9): I like the theatrics of it

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.7): this was my middle school anthem

**modulum83** (7.8): ridiculously theatrical, but this song always makes me feel sad for some reason

**astrologicalangel** (7): the first verse has kind of a This is Halloween rhythm to it??

**bespectacIed** (7): For how pretentious FOB's lyrics are, they always come thru with golden one-liners. Like "I don't just want to be a footnote in someone else's happiness" ... weeg snatched

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): a great chorus that i think is let down by average verses

**twat\_brained** (7): Something to do with Infidelity?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Oh jesus I don’t even want to get into the craziness of what this song is about… so I will just say that it is a good-sounding song!

####**Mr. Sandmen**

**duhchappers** (6): So far I feel like there's a lot of songs on this album that would be really good if the lyrics made any sense at all. But instead they are just trying too hard and end up being frustrating

**fadedblue09** (2): Honestly I never liked this. I love that subdued bit in the chorus, but I think it was better done in What A Catch Donnie. The rest of the song is just clunky and forgettable which makes it a drag. I didn’t even realize this was part of the medley until years later, which I guess proves how forgettable this is.

**Mysario** (10): After the Ryan and Jon split, Brendon and Spencer became the new Panic! Taking two years to release any new material (outside of "New Perspective"), this song bloomed out from the ground. It no longer sounds like the hectic parade from the Panic I first knew and grew up with BUT it's a great pop-rock track front to back AND it's actually coherent without sounding overly pretentious! Overall, just a fun song and sometimes, that's all you need!

**CarlieScion** (7): They're dropping like flies - Panic! is also down to a single song. This is REALLY bombastic and fun - but I still kinda don't know what any of this MEANS. 

---

####**Belongs in the Louvre**

**hikkaru** (11): it gives me that buzz.. their best song

**cremeebrulee** (10): ack if i didn’t have such an attachment to ignorance this would’ve been my 11,, such a standout from this album

**duhchappers** (10): I think this song contrasted with the FOB album I just heard perfectly shows the value of some restraint in production making for much stronger moments of emotional climax. The quiet moments make the important lines stand out more and a great overall experience.

**fifteensunflwrs** (10): a BOP.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is the only song I’ve heard from this album (which I like) so let’s see how the rest of this is

**ImADudeDuh** (10): WOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH MONA LISA!!!!!!!!

**intheaftermath** (10): This song defined sixth grade for me. It was great when I binged it on repeat in my bedroom then and it is still great now.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): still my favorite song Panic! ever did, that hook is just everything

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I always kind of imagined this song as the follow-up to I Write Sins, the ex-groom is real lost and trying to fill the hole his ex-fiance left with sex, but he still feels guilty about it.

**skargardin** (10): This classic, singing along to the chorus never gets old

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): another amazing opener, literally all these albums have 10/10 opening songs

**twat\_brained** (10): Tumblr is right. This 100% slaps.

**grinchelda** (9.8): i remember at one point in time this was the only panic! song one of my friends could name

**modulum83** (9.5): I Rewrite Sins Not Tragedies (but i'm not complaining)

**poptartchill** (9.5): still slaps

**bespectacIed** (9): The perfect lead single, as it's one of the 3 good songs in the whole album lol. The prechorus and chorus are mindblowingly good tho, like they merit this song a 10 if it weren't for the underwhelming verses

**ktajlili** (9): P!ATD classic

**pig-serpent** (9): Great song, but I've worn it into the ground.

**seanderlust\_** (9): Brendon Urie is horny on main

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i mean it’s a good song but does anyone else hear how similar the verses are to time is running out or am i just going insane

**Verdantshade** (9): this deserves a 10 but it's sooo overplayed that I skip this song more often than I should

**anothertown** (8): Bop. Famously, the first proper single post breakup. I hate the intro/outro like they added those weird circus noises to appease the AFYSCO stans, (who are not valid)

**bbfan132** (8): i enjoyed most of this but the vocal manipulation/vocoder/whatever brendon was using kind of turned me off

**conceptualromance** (8): a GREAT single but kind of gets lost in the album

**kirby31200** (8): This just won best P!ATD song ever over at /r/panicatthedisco. I like the song but I politely disagree. I just don't think the bridge is very good, sorry. Also this is a fantastic three track stretch

**rickikardashian** (8): this isnt a ballad

**Roxieloxie** (7.1): Not my favorite Panic! album opener

**1998tweety** (7): Mona Lisa kinda Lisa outsold

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This chorus is extremely catchy! A pretty strong opener. Not a fan of the bridge though

####**Brad Paisley's "Mona Lisa" outsold**

**waluigiest** (6): I’ve never really liked this, its always just felt like a watered down I Write Sins to me

**fadedblue09** (4): Lyrically ambitious, somewhat messy and disjointed execution.

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): i don't like the fact that the guitar seems off tempo at parts and the beat is just fighting itself/the vocals the whole song

**sandyfishnets** (2): meh

**CarlieScion** (10): And here we are guys. No Fall Out Boy in the top 5 for you! This intro is fantastic, but I don't understand how this is the highest rated Fall Out Boy-song? This was one of the least controversial songs in the entire rate. It's really fun, doesn't have as muddy/loud instrumental as some of the other songs, which I guess was most people's issue with the other songs. 

**Mysario** (9.5): UGH what a wonderful way to kick off an album! The calm intro, the blast off into the verses, the anthemic nature of the chorus - it’s just so fantastically done. These artists really knew how to start off albums, huh?

---

####**Perfect people with their perfect scores**

**bespectacIed** (10): Whew starting the rate with a winner contender already. I know we all see the irony of "nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy", but imo it's a distillation of FoB's signature tongue and cheek take on emo music. And there's nothing more emo than pretentious nonsensical lyrics about anger and heartbreak lol. P.S. "Boycott love, detox just to retox" might be my favorite FOB lyric ever

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Such a great intro for the album. DETOX JUST TO RETOX.

**modulum83** (10): beautifully epic and poignant at the same time, like a song you'd hear playing on the radio in the 90s. i used "loose bolt in a complete machine" as my discord status for a good while.

**poptartchill** (10): This is such a strong opener. I remember hearing for the first time and it was honestly a religious experience. A perfect song.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): honestly what an amazing opener!! Other albums would fall flat after this but Folie A Deux stays strong bc its the best fob album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i can’t give 2 11’s so pretend my score for this one is 10.5.

**TiltControls** (10): First song in the rate and already at 11 material

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): this is probably my favourite fall out boy song

####**This song was half-doomed but you are semi-sweet**

**grinchelda** (9.7): t break anthem

**twat\_brained** (9.2): agreed, tragedy is depressing enough as it is. That is, I'd love to hear about someone writing sins instead of tragedies ;)

**bbfan132** (9): really good intro to the album, love the drums

**duhchappers** (9): Probably my favorite song on the album, great production and the lyrics are probably the strongest of any FOB song I've heard. Very Cohesive and just well made.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): DETOX! JUST TO RETOX!

**kirby31200** (9): Just an absolutely fantastic album opener

**ktajlili** (9): Fall Out Boy meets The Who meets ???

**seanderlust\_** (9): If I had heard this when it came out, "BOYCOTT LOVE" would have for sure been my AIM away message

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is nice tbh

**Roxieloxie** (8): sometimes liking a fob song isnt about knowing what they're saying but rather just simply enjoying the ~ vibes ~

**Verdantshade** (8): a good song but borderline overindulgent. kinda cool that patrick still sings it though

**fadedblue09** (7.8): Patrick's voice really elevates the chorus into something anthemic. Sadly, the lyrics are all over the place, trying to cover too many bases at once. (try sticking with a single idea next time, I guess?).

**conceptualromance** (7.7): great album opener but the lyrics are a bit too nonsensical for me

**jolteonhoodie** (7.5): I've never really liked this song as much as the rest of the songs on this album. And honestly that's just because of the beginning of the song, I don't like it and it makes me want to skip the whole thing

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): If I have to tell the truth, I always saw this song as a rehash of Thriller… but like better and more epic-sounding. I still think it’s a good song! And I’m sure all of popheads can relate to “Perfect boys with their perfect lives, nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy!”

####**Boycotts Love**

**anothertown** (6): I’m finding I don’t love this song like I used to, the lyrics seem so try-hard to me, like Pete really thought he did something when he thought of the word “retox”

**pig-serpent** (6): The song feels well written, but the production makes the song sound washed up and like it's missing pieces. It's pretty representative of what I feel about this album as a whole.

**intheaftermath** (5): lovely intro, but the rest of the song seems sonically static

# Folie A Deux

**Overall Average**: 7.624 **// Average Controversy:** 1.881

---
**DraculaWeekend** (9.179): I forgot how much I liked this album. Crazy that it wasn't well-received; it's up there with From Under the Cork Tree for me.

**jolteonhoodie** (8.821): So many 10s. So many potential 11s!

**TiltControls** (8.750): Such a great album, at first it doesn't seem like there are any standout singles unlike their other albums, but it's because the whole album is so damn strong.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.714): Save Rock and Roll might be my favorite FOB album, but I think Folie is their objective best. I love how theatric every song sounds and lyricism is top notch as usual. Take away wams and pavlove and it’s nearly perfect.

**poptartchill** (8.714): This is my favorite Fall Out Boy album and one of my favorite albums of all time. The lyrics, the style - everything about these songs comes together for me in a way I really love. There's not a single song I dislike. The album itself is cohesive yet every song is distinct (and the transitions are great). This album is full of amazing tracks that I have never gotten tired of and I truly love listening to it.

**engifear** (8.500): This is hands down the best album Fall Out Boy ever released.

**Lizardman469** (8.500): I can't believe FOB went on hiatus after this album to only come back and release only one album and then retire

**conceptualromance** (8.493): the best Fall Out Boy album PERIOD

**RandomHypnotica** (8.400): Overall I really enjoyed the album, but it feels sort of inconsistent in tone throughout to really keep me interested for a full listen

**jackisboredtoday** (8.364): This album is genuinely Fall Out Boy’s masterpiece and the best thing they’ve ever made. I was late to discover it but once I did I spent almost all of high school with it on repeat. I don’t think I’ve given out this many 10s to an album before and I don’t know if I will again, but almost every song here brings so much flooding back.

**Verdantshade** (8.286): experimenting done right (glares @ MANIA). there's so much creativity on this album and it's crazy to think what fall out boy would be like today if folie a deux was received well on release

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8.250): probably an unpopular opinion but this is fall out boy’s best album

**ktajlili** (8.214): This album doesn’t always effortlessly blend it’s conflicting styles, but for me, that’s part of the charm. You can hear the band’s frustration as they caress between rocking out and delivering the classic FOB choruses. Even if they are a mess, the songs are fun to listen to. I just love all the absurd lyrics and will stan this album 4eva.

**modulum83** (8.164): On this red-colored album, Kanye West makes a grandiose and unexpected musical turn in an epic, idea-packed sprawl of a project that deconstructs the nature of fame and celebrity while commenting on the current cultural landscape, taking on influences from retro-soul pop, arena rock, and---Wait. Hold on. shuffles papers Give me a minute. Oh, this was about Fall Out Boy's Folie a Deux. Sorry about that!

**skargardin** (8.071): I've unfortunately never really cared for Fall Out Boy like that, even back when I was deep in the emo pond I never really listened to them at all outside of whatever was on the radio at the time, (mainly I Don't Care tbh sfgsjk). That being said, this is really solid and I no doubt would've been all over it had I chosen to listen to it in middle school.

**kirby31200** (7.929): Fall Out Boy's magnum opus?

**CactusWithinUs** (7.714): This album is all over the place but its only duds are when it decides to stick to the formula too rigidly. Would have really liked FOB to go down a similar route after this album

**anothertown** (7.571): fall out boy has been…in my life… for 15 years we have a complicated relationship. To me this is their peak. Balancing texture, complexity and a little bit of darkness with the tight, energetic songwriting and huge hooks emblematic of their best music. Ironically, it was the work process that made their best album that also led to their hiatus.. I honestly wasn’t mad at the time and frankly if I could send them back into hiatus I would! Anyway

**twat\_brained** (7.343): bit overrated if you ask me, it kind of confirms my suspicions of Fall Out Boy as a singles band

**duhchappers** (6.857): Controversial opinion, but the weird titles actually hurt a lot of these songs. It made it a lot harder for me to find the emotional center the band wanted and just were distracting. Disloyal Order is the exception, that title is perfect. Outside that, I liked a lot here but it was a chore to listen all the way through, thanks to a combination of overblown production and a hint of self-important attitude throughout.

**fadedblue09** (6.571): I’m an FOB stan, but I must confess: I don’t like this album as the rest of the FOB fanbase does. I get that they wanted to tackle bigger themes and create their own American Idiot, but IMO Pete isn’t just equipped for those stuff. He clearly has a lot to say, but he tends to cram his ideas and as a result, a lot of the songs end up being jumbled, incoherent messes. IMO, the real star of the album was Patrick and his vocals, as the diverse set of sounds here really displayed his vocal versatility. Though honestly, if you’re more interested in that, you can just stream his solo album Soul Punk instead.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.571): Ahh my favorite band, at least when I first started really listening to music. I’ve heard this album the most out of the three, but I can still recognize that some songs aren’t perfect. That said, I think the whole is better than the sum of its parts, a sentiment emphasized by how the songs all blend together, which I always love hearing in albums!

**intheaftermath** (6.464): A good emo album, but the middle portion suffers from some monotony.

**pig-serpent** (6.357): I know that as a Fall Out Boy fan I'm supposed to love this album, but I'd put it as 5/7 for them.

**bespectacIed** (5.643): Insert joke about "sell out boys" (only post-folie, let's be clear!). The thing about Folie is it's a fun record that's also perfectly valid and guilt-free to hate lol, it's equally composed of classics and duds. If you didn't listen to this on YouTube with the awful compression to immerse into the music piracy feels, you didn't do the rate correctly

**sandyfishnets** (5.221): hello emo my old friend

**Mysario** (8): Probably one of the best lyrically on the album with a bunch of great angsty one-liners sprinkled throughout. But there's something boring about the choruses where she feels like she's just reading off a piece of paper rather than really feeling her own words. The rest of the song is great though, shout out that call-and-response bridge!

---

####**Carries a mirror on hand just in case someone tries sumn**

**CreativeFrog95** (11): This is my favorite Paramore song and one of my favorite songs of all time

**fadedblue09** (11): I was going back between this and Brick by Boring Brick for my 11, but ultimately I went along with this. I just love everything, from the lush guitar-playing to the hard-hitting lyrics, and holds up very well as someone past his emo phase. I also consider this the centerpiece of the album, as it captures the album’s main themes (maturity, independence and even the band’s internal feud) all in one.

**Leixander** (11): Still my favorite Paramore song, a timeless classique that may be a bit too relatable.

**skargardin** (11): There's something about the juxtaposition between the angry lyrics and the chill production that just does this song for me. It's so odd and the combination really shouldn't work but it's just magic. One of my favorite's from Paramore by far.

####**We must get more acquainted!**

**bbfan132** (10): i don’t know what else to say other than “this is fucking great”

**bespectacIed** (10): Funny how God has been silent ever since this was released, I know she's embarrassed. This has such fun songwriting, I am always amazed by how much nuanced Paramore's songwriting is in comparison to their emo contemporaries. "Next time you point a finger i might have to bend it back and break it off" <--- the power that that line has!!!! Legendary song that exudes so much teenage arrogant, self-righteous energy. Also, neon pink hair hayley was a babe

**seanderlust\_** (10): "You don't deserve a point of view if the only thing you see is you." Words to judge by

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): hayley really nails the bitterness in her voice when doing angry songs and this is another amazing example

**Verdantshade** (10): fun story, we had to create a dance in PE class and I HATED my PE teacher so I did a dance to this song (I was like 11), it was my little form of protest lol

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i love how calm and chill this song sounds given how angry the lyrics are

**twat\_brained** (9.3): the millennial whoop, clever lyrics and video. I'm really disappointed not to be giving this my 10

**1998tweety** (9): oh wait this served huh

**conceptualromance** (9): GREAT lyrics

**engifear** (9): Hayley really snapped with this one

**pig-serpent** (9): I love this song but the groove in the chorus throws me off a little. I also wonder if it should've been a little bit less subdued.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): a change in pace was good, and i like the softer but still moody instrumental

**modulum83** (8.5): good music this music is good

**poptartchill** (8.5): I just like this one a lot, it's fun to jam to

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This song really captures the feel of just wanting to shut up all the self-righteous pricks in our lives

####**Got stuck playing 'Doodle God'**

**duhchappers** (6): nothing about this song is really bad, but I can’t muster much feeling for it anyway

**grinchelda** (6): honestly i just don't like this song because i get really bad finger related intrusive thoughts

**intheaftermath** (6): it suffers just because it’s sandwiched between two awesome tracks

**untitledmanuscript** (6): Chorus isn’t as strong as verses

**anothertown** (5.5): the body horror of it all..

**CarlieScion** (10): And with that we only have Paramore-songs left! We were so close to having a full Paramore top 5, but this song had its claws too deeply into the top 5. This got the single most 11s out of any songs in the rate. And I get it, it's all the best parts of Panic! put into a single songs - pretentious french intro, strings, fun ad-libs by Brendon, lyrics that would be perfect as a Myspace-status. The way the song ends with a perfect mixing into The Ballad of Mona Lisa, as if it's begging you to replay the entire album! Love it!

**Mysario** (6): one of the few remnants of “Cricket & Clover” and the last contribution by Ryan Ross, and despite Popheads' scores on it, this is probably one of Panic’s most divisive songs. I’d give it a 0 if I could! My fellow co-host even ENCORUAGED I did! Reasonably I won’t as the song has many good parts in it - even if as a whole, it fails to live up to its full potential. The chorus and the verses feel like two different songs mashed together so when the chorus comes around, it feels Pretty Odd. The circus vibes within the verses are the most we hear that feel like it came from the same band that once brought. The verses are fun, the chorus is bland, and the children's choir is nothing to be proud about. The demo version outsold this version but as it stands, we’ll never hear that fully realized and we must deal with this weird mash instead. It makes a decent closer though!

---

####**Here you are boasting the burlesque**

**grinchelda** (11): behind the sea outsold and i h8 french but damn this song is good

**intheaftermath** (11): Incredible album closer, it’s so theatrical and enthralling! Brendon really sells the narrative! A true standout on an already stellar record.

**purplechilipepper** (11): The choir at the beginning plus the "I only shoot up" line ugh I love this song

**RandomHypnotica** (11): What a perfect closer to this album. It captures the vibe of the whole album, it's got the fun, thesaurus-driven lyricism of Panic, a sweeping orchestral chorus, it's just peak Panic and so incredibly melodramatic and gorgeous and encapsulates everything I love about this album and band.

**revolutionarycostume** (11): Possibly the best PATD song ever

**TiltControls** (11): i think folie is the best album in this rate, so it pains me not to give it an 11. But this song is just too good not to recognize.

**untitledmanuscript** (11): Best Panic! Song imo

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (11): - Thank god for Ryan Ross's leftover lyrics.

####**Only shoots up with Ryan Ross's perfume**

**anothertown** (10): This is one of my favorite choruses frankly. I’ve heard this song and its pre-split demo a million times but never actually realized that Brendon wrote the choruses (just assumed that Ryan wrote the whole thing I guess..) King of punching up a song

**CactusWithinUs** (10): This is an amazing closer, particularly love the intro

**conceptualromance** (10): Ryan Ross’s impact

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I still remember hearing the demo for this song on YouTube years before the full song was released and being obsessed. Thankfully, the full song lived up to the hype. Best song on this album by far and an 11 contender.

**engifear** (10): If you were gay and a teenager in the 2010s, you 100% listened to this song and cried about that One person

**ggal2020** (10): I remember someone saying that this has a children’s choir because brendon wants to have kids with ryan and I have not been able to get that monstrosity of a take out of my head since. however, this is an amazing fucking song.

**hikkaru** (10): amazing closing track

**jolteonhoodie** (10): I love every little moment of this song. It's perfection

**ktajlili** (10): Stunning

**milkywayinradius** (10): finally a good song, i am re-energized to finish this rate

**pig-serpent** (10): It has what is likely Panic's best riff, an all time great chorus, a punchy beat to carry the verses, and a heck of a climax.

**poptartchill** (10): "'here I am composing a burlesque' -ryan ross" -brendon urie

**seanderlust\_** (10): SOLID end to the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I love when Brendon has more playful vocals like this. But stop doing children’s choirs for album closers!!! (Dua I’m looking at you as well)

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): This one also has slight theatrics and i can vibe with that

**duhchappers** (9): clever and fun, really just embodies the type of music Panic! Is best at

**ImADudeDuh** (9): another 8tracks classic

**kirby31200** (9): Oh Ryan Ross, you nerd. I miss his writing. I love how the album comes full circle

**twat\_brained** (9): Does the guitar remind anyone else of the Club Penguin game Smoothie Smash?

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): god i wish someone loved me

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): the choir… heavenly

**modulum83** (8): i meannnnnn it's super groovy but like, all the bonus tracks are objectively better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the verses are so fucking good but the chorus drops the ball so hard

**Verdantshade** (8): @ fall out boy: this is what what a catch should have been. thanks ryan!

**bbfan132** (7.5): an intriguing closer! wish i enjoyed it more but it was still pretty good

**Leixander** (7): "Are you guys ready for your songwriting lesson?" Joanna Newsom gulped. Lorde nodded. Taylor Swift blinked nervously. Katy Perry smiled. "Yes Ryan Ross," they said in unison.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This song is kinda silly and melodramatic… but I think it works. Just not that “mona lisa” shit at the end, that’s literally the creepiest part of this song lol

####**Je n'ai qu'un seul et unique regret**

**1998tweety** (6.5): the intro is bad but the rest is decent

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): props for trying to do something different but not for me. the ending of the song saves it

**fadedblue09** (3): Messy and disjointed song, sonically and lyrically.

**plvstvcbvrds** (1): does anybody remember the citizens mixtape? anyway, this song is bad.

# Vices and Virtues

---

**Overall Average**: 7.406 **// Average Controversy:** 1.914

---

**grinchelda** (9.787): okay my average for this is kind of ridiculous but i also ran a bandom blog for years

**RandomHypnotica** (9.553): I loved this album, and I still do, I think it's exactly the right mix between their first and second albums in terms of sound, and the results are absolute perfection. Also, since they aren't in the rate, you should listen to the bonus tracks Bittersweet and Turn Off the Lights

**Verdantshade** (9.000): panic!'s most consistent album (pretty odd is better but it does stretch). I have a huge soft spot for the bonus tracks too, and it's a shame that the best panic! album post ryan ross was their first

**twat\_brained** (8.873): the first Panic! album I've heard in full

**Lizardman469** (8.733): This is the most insanely consistent and catchy Panic! ever got

**modulum83** (8.393): P!ATD at the height of its powers. The steampunk/Victorian aesthetic is committed to in nearly every corner of the production of this record, and it makes for a fantastically immersive and exotic experience. Also pay attention to the drumming throughout this record - Spencer Smith is an amazingly creative drummer who does a lot of really technical and difficult parts.

**jolteonhoodie** (8.333): This album would be so much better with the bonus tracks included

**poptartchill** (8.333): This is such a great album. While it's not my favorite Panic! album, I really appreciate its sound and how cohesive it is. This was a new era for the band in many ways and they really knocked it out of the park. Brendon if you're reading this Please put the bonus tracks on Spotify (and while you're at it PLEASE add your absolute best bonus track All The Boys in addition to iconic holiday anthem It's Almost Halloween).

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8.267): we really should’ve ranked bittersweet, it’s the best song on the album. also, a lot of the bonus tracks are better than the standard album.

**duhchappers** (8.000): one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time, not the most consistent Panic! Project but the good songs are all so fantastic it makes up for it

**pig-serpent** (7.733): On some level I know that this is probably my favorite Panic album, but I always forget quite how good it is until I go back and listen to it.

**anothertown** (7.647): the castoff of the panic discography. The least talked about. It was kind of a rough first pass toward the pop direction they were going in, but I like that they kind of threw a lot at the wall.

**kirby31200** (7.533): Panic! At the Disco v3.0, your pop queens WISH they could reinvent themselves with every era the way Panic does. And look, a person other than Brendon on the cover!

**DraculaWeekend** (7.533): I've been a P!ATD fan since their first album, so I have a lot of opinions about this album. I was not into Pretty. Odd. at all (don’t think I've listened to it since it came out), so I was very interested in hearing how this album would be, especially after Ryan and Jon left. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised but how well they kept the "weirdness" of their first album. I could tell the lyrics weren't quite as unique without Ryan, but it was not a bad follow-up. This album has also held up a lot better than their first album, imo.

**skargardin** (7.533): I've always loved Brendon's voice and it really shines on this album with the pretentious lyrics to boot and the banging production, luv it. Some of the deep cuts I'm not too big a fan of, especially the bonus tracks but hey, they can't all be winners. Overall it holds up really well!

**waluigiest** (7.400): maybe a hot take but this is Panic’s weakest album

**ktajlili** (7.367): Honestly when I first discovered this album I had forgotten that P!ATD even existed. Pretty. Odd. sanitized a lot of what had initially captured me as a fan, so when I listened to this, it was refreshing to see some of those older elements return, albeit more toned down and cleanly produced. The album starts strong, dips in the middle, and then finishes with two amazing tracks

**conceptualromance** (7.227): it’s no A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out also this album feels long as hell

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.100): Half and half between really good and really forgettable

**CactusWithinUs** (6.933): I haven't listened to this album in years but I honestly don't remember it being this non-descript? for the first half, feels like it actually starts halfway through. I don't think anything can beat Pretty Odd. for me but the second half + some of the bonus tracks would make a great record

**milkywayinradius** (6.633): scores have been adjusted down due to brandon's involvement with ME!

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.000): I must admit, Panic is by far my least favorite of these three bands. But I tried my hardest to listen to this album objectively, and I can recognize the talent that Panic posesses. You can tell that the band takes care in setting up the right atmosphere for each song. Also, unlike the other two albums, Vices and Virtues has a more laid-back and fun atmosphere, so I enjoyed the more chill listening experience!

**fadedblue09** (5.173): First Panic album I’ve heard in full and...idk. I would advise Mr. Urie to stick to writing songs that are closer to his experiences, because I literally struggled to be convinced by his songs. He really thinks he can get away by throwing all these purple prose vocabulary and fancy imagery together and press blend, but lol nope. Don’t get me wrong, not every song has to be based on experience, but being an imaginative writer and an effective storyteller are two different things. A lot of these songs aren’t bad in theory, but I don’t think he has a quirky enough personality to pull these off.

**bespectacIed** (4.533): Objectively the worst album in this rate omg. A steep drop of quality from fever and pretty odd. The only song I'm confident that I like is new perspective and it isn't really part of the album, what the hell we gon do now

**Mysario** (10): The unfortunate stipulation of me being allowed to co-host this rate (as this was my first one whoopee!) was having this as a bonus song. Unfortunately, I know people do NOT appreciate this song at all so I had to watch this get dragged and now you all get to laugh at how poor this did compared to every other song in this rate. In fact, sporting a disgusting **5.367**, it's probably considered one of the worst tracks to hit a rate, even as a bonus song. It even did worse than songs like Linkin Park's "**Cure for the Itch**", OMI's "**Cheerleader (Felix Jaehn Remix)**", Alison Gold's "**Chinese Food**", Taylor Swift's "**London Boy**", The 1975's "**The 1975**" and Eiffel 65's "**Blue (Da Ba Dee)**" (seriously???)! It may not be the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or the Front Bottoms, but this song is just as (if not more so) emotional than both. It's the last time M5 could produce a great track and I'll now tell you why.

Immediately, the track opens up with only three bits to it: Adam Levine (who once personally stole money from me), a hi hat to keep the beat and a notable guitar riff. I'll come back to that riff later. Adam starts admittedly longing for a better time, missing a past lover and the life and conversations they once had. He wants to find a song on the radio that can help alleviate this looming despair upon him, but he can't find the right song to cheer him up. Sorry man, "Fireworks" just isn't on today. Now that he's sitting there unable to find something to distract him, the bass drums kick in while he laments on the past relationship he once had. He was so sure they were gonna share a life together. They had so much planned out. They even drew a map together (metaphorically (maybe?))! Hey, that's the title of the song! At some point, he made a mistake and "fell down", only for his lover to leave him behind. The ex-lover didn't look back. He was left on the side of the road. Why did they leave? Why didn't they want to help him? Were things so broken they couldn't be fixed? But they didn't look back. He's left thinking about it all after the fact.

More instruments come into play here. There's keys, heavy bass, and Adam harmonizing with himself since he couldn't get Brendon Urie for it. The heightened sense of sound accentuates the thoughts going through Adam's head. He was there for her in the best of times, in the worst of times, in their age of wisdom, and their age of foolishness. 

Everything briefly becomes silent as Adam begins "but I wonder..."

Then the chorus strikes. The instruments explode back in.

"Where were you" - he continues - "when I was at my worst down on my knees and you said you had my back?" Maybe it was an unrequited love all along. Maybe the lover never really had it planned out with him. Maybe it's Maybelline. Regardless, he never got the same appreciation and was left alone when he needed it most. He's stuck suffering the consequences for this painful decision. Yet all the memories stick with him. He wants to fix what's been broken. Perhaps if he could figure out what's wrong, everything can return back to normalcy for the two of them.

Game time.

Adam looks at the map (there it is again!) that they drew together. If anything, it might bear some clues on how to bring the lover back. He's following this map that leads to the most important treasure to him: you. Well, not *you* you, but like you *you*... you get it? Anyways, the instruments here all take an even louder sound that represent his determination in the matter. The drums become more robust, the vocals themselves fluctuate on more notes and there's more background noises like a bunch of ping-pong players that strengthen the sound that comes from his words. There's nothing he can do now except keep going for it.

Following following following the chorus, the second verse continues his longing for his past lover with a similar structure to the first, once again professing his continued feelings for them and the need to hear their voice once more. With such a beautiful voice that once lulled him to sleep, it's hard for him to resist the siren's call that echoes in his head. His heart aches, his mind detoriates, his stomach uneasily feels queasy - you name it. Something strange has come over the man and it ain't the 'rona. He can't get over his ex-lover. He doesn't want to. Wait. They don't love them like he does. He's determined to try and fix things.

We come back to the chorus structure as heard before. Sonically, nothing has changed. However, in context, it reinforces his feelings for his ex-lover. He's having a rough night and wishes his lover was there for him to comfort him as he had comforted them once before. His determination grows stronger all throughout. 

Now up until this point, the guitar riff has basically not stopped playing. Even disguised behind all the sounds of the chorus, the same twinkly riff never left. This riff comes off of a minor chord, providing the downcast sound that this song needs. The prolonged use of the riff represents the singer's sadness throughout the entire song as he sustains all the memories of his past lover.

Until...

**ImADudeDuh** (10): iconic, stunning, wow, amazing, omg!

**letsallpoo** (10): yes

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): jokes on you i love this song even though it sounds like a onerepublic ripoff

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): ngl this is one of my favourite Maroon 5 songs

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.3): if there’s anything maroon 5 is always gonna give you it’s a dramatic music video

**RandomHypnotica** (9): a good Maroon 5 song past 2010? I'm absolutely shocked

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): I unironically enjoy this song, sorry not sorry

####**Missing the conversation**

**intheaftermath** (8): if only every maroon five hit was this good...

**modulum83** (8): maps is an objectively terrible song but that little twiddly guitar in the verses is so nostalgic and catchy i could listen to that loop for hours

**jolteonhoodie** (7.5): Why is this song here lol

**kirby31200** (7): Maroon 5 isn't a very good band anymore but I actually really like this one. Would be better without the yelps on "Map that leads to you-ou"

**Lizardman469** (7): Quite possibly the best single from Maroon 5 of the 2010s...maybe?

**poptartchill** (7): simply a jam

**Roxieloxie** (7): Hey this isnt Sugar by Maroon 5

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the last good maroon 5 single

####**Searching for a song tonight**

**ktajlili** (6.5): I liked this song but I think it's a big overplayed and gets old pretty quickly. Still love the part: following following following

**duhchappers** (6): good for Maroon 5 for sure, one of their most tolerable and even enjoyable hits

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): "the map that leads to you" part is so aggravating to me but other than that the song is decent

**waluigiest** (5): sure

**astrologicalangel** (4): my life has been changed in no way by listening to this song

**bbfan132** (4): i used to like this when it came out but now it just annoys me

**jackisboredtoday** (3): this might actually be the worst Maroon 5 hit solely for the way Adam Levine sings the word “you”

**skargardin** (3): I used to stan this but goddamn relistening to it it is just annoying as can be

**TiltControls** (3): i was originally going to give this a 1. then i decided to actually listen to the song. it's alright

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): There were times when I was listening to Vices and Virtues and thinking “hmm… maybe Brendon doesn’t have as great a voice as everyone says he does.” It’s a good thing that this song exists to remind me what an actual bad voice sounds like!

**ggal2020** (2): there is an incredible song called maps, but this is not it

**grinchelda** (2): bonus point for being the best maroon 5 song

####**Changing all of the stations**

**bespectacIed** (1): Yeah Yeah Yeahs should have sued

**Leixander** (1): out of all the songs... if this was payphone it would get a 10!!

**pig-serpent** (1): I can't think of a single sound I hate more than Adam Levine's voice. I'm not giving a 0 this round solely because I can't give it to maps. I also don't understand how this fits the theme of the rate. At least Animals-muls sounds like a bad Fall Out Boy Song.

**purplechilipepper** (1): hate the overemphasis on the last song of each line in the chorus plus can't tell what he's saying plus I hate the production

**rickikardashian** (1): maroon 5 bad

**seanderlust\_** (1): ....you just included this to make us all listen to it, didnt you

**thebrandnew** (1): I hadn’t listened to this song in years and I remember why

**CarlieScion** (10): This goes HARD. God, Hayley's vocals! The build up throughout the song! The final release of the final ALL I WANTED WAS YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU! This was another one of my 11 options, and I'm really glad it got far, even though I don't think Paramore deserved to have the entire top 4 lmao.

**Mysario** (10): This is the last comment I wrote in so I'm just tired of writing at this point. How do people do this for a living? I think I've repeated the same phrase like 20 times just because I think every song here is GREAT! Well, outside of Stump's bathroom rump. Beautiful bittersweet outro here. It does just kind of end, but that's love, ain't it?

**1998tweety** (11): im ascending

**conceptualromance** (11): crazy how this is the only song to ever exist

**fifteensunflwrs** (11): OMG HAYLEY'S VOCALS BRING ME CHIIIILLS

**ktajlili** (11): All I Wanted was to hear Haley sing this song :/

**sandyfishnets** (11): emo anthem

####**All I wanted was yooooooooooooooUUUUUUUUUUUUUU**

**bbfan132** (10): absolutely perfect outro, one of their best songs in general

**bespectacIed** (10): paramore: hey babe, My Heart hasn't damaged your larynx ? Here, damn

**intheaftermath** (10): Every part of this song hits the mark. The guitar solo, the soft intro, the killer notes, it’s truly an experience.

**Leixander** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**seanderlust\_** (10): The guitar explosion in the chorus >>>>>

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i feel guilty for not giving this my 11 bc its such a fantastic song and the vocals are unmatched so it's an 11 in my heart. slightly bitter i will never hear it live however

**TiltControls** (10): best song on the album

**twat\_brained** (10): please shitpost the mashup with This is Gospel

**Verdantshade** (10): one live performance. one live performance is all I ask. but I'm also not ready for hayley to rip my emo heart out and stomp on it

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): vocals ended the music industry

**duhchappers** (9): now this is more like it, aided by really good lyrics and great guitar line backing up the emotion

**jolteonhoodie** (9): The bright spot in the second half of the album. Great closer

**pig-serpent** (9): Crushing depressing atmosphere and punk agression. Damn, what a fantastic closer, and the single most emo song Paramore has ever written.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): The first line of the last chorus is what god sounds like

**poptartchill** (8.5): Hayley has such an amazing voice and this song shows it off so well.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.8): all i wanted was YOUUUUUUUUU

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I'd probably like this better if this was more acoustic or subdued like the beginning.

####**All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi**

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): hayley’s vocals are amazing but it’s not particularly interesting otherwise

**modulum83** (6): this is just straight up emo

**anothertown** (4): all this has going for it is Hayley straining her voice in the chorus

---

####**Meeting CarlieScion on the Eastside**

**1998tweety** (10): pop perfection

**astrologicalangel** (10): I actually love this song so much and it is a TRAVESTY that I can’t give it an 11

**ImADudeDuh** (10): everyone who calls this Gen Z’s Fast Car is accurate (even though Tracy Chapman ended this song)

**rickikardashian** (10): halsey also bad but song good

**Roxieloxie** (10): As one of 3 Khalid stans on this sub I am legally obligated to do a rate whenever I see khalid. This song is cute, i'm always gonna be here for songs ~ coming of age ~ songs from black kids so this fills that niche. Like Kina, I have also heard a solo version of this live and it was great. Not sure what else I can say other than if the maroon 5 songs wins over this then popheads is in fact anitblack

**TiltControls** (10): this bonus rate feels unfair.

**letsallpoo** (9): we love halsey and khalid and sometimes benny blanco but maybe not this time

**seanderlust\_** (9): God I love Khalid's voice

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): cute but I don’t real go out of my way to listen to it

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): It's OK but it's no Closer

**duhchappers** (8): great driving song

**skargardin** (8): catchy banger

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this song is still like top 50 on australian apple music but it does have a lot of reply value and imo is a great chill summer song

**waluigiest** (8): is this riffing on black parade????

**grinchelda** (7.2): i have no idea what this has to do with the rest of the rate but it's pretty solid

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I don’t know why this is involved in the rate but it’s the song i enjoy in playlists and don’t skip but never think about

**DraculaWeekend** (7): I wish this song had anyone else other than Halsey

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Why does Khalid sing with a British accent? I honestly find that weirder than they way Halsey sings lol

**modulum83** (6.8): anyway fuck you here's a mashup of both songs https://youtu.be/Ss5Asce6RUk

**bbfan132** (6.5): i guess it’s sort of pleasant but it’s also nothing special

**kirby31200** (6): It's fine. Sounds like current era Ed Sheeran tbh

**pig-serpent** (6): This song doesn't leave much of an impact on me and the six guitar notes get a little boring by the end of it, but I like Halsey's performance enough to say that I overall enjoy the song.

**ktajlili** (5): meh

**poptartchill** (5): This song isn't bad but I just never liked it :/

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): never got the hype around this one it just sounds so generic to me :/

**jolteonhoodie** (4): I forgot this song about 0.3 seconds after hearing it

**intheaftermath** (3): I can’t explain why I dislike it so much. Maybe it’s the way the vocals drone from both artists?

**CarlieScion** (9): I WAS SO SURE THIS WAS GONNA WIN! This is the biggest highlight of the Twilight soundtrack. When I saw Paramore in 2017 they played both this **and** I Caught Myself and I felt myself reverting back into my 13 year old Twilight-stan self. Decode goes hard, even though the lyrics are a little too on the nose for the subject matter. P.S. this is on Spotify for people in Europe, so suck it Americans.

**Mysario** (9): lmao this song absolutely did not need to be this good for this movie. I think I over-listened to this song when I was younger so it doesn't hit the same beats as it used to for me. However, I do recognize that it's surprisingly one of Paramore's best-written songs with the Farro brothers. Guitar-work (fore and background). the well timed drums, the vocal prowess that's exercised throughout - you name it! The MV is great in the sense that it kills two birds with one stone: the typical movie MV and the typical emo band in the woods aesthetic. Also it looks nice!

---

####**Wish "I Caught Myself" was included in the rate instead of "Monster"**

**bbfan132** (11): this was the first paramore song i loved and it’s still one of my favorites! should’ve been on the album…

**letsallpoo** (11): while i fundamentally distrust the people who go to bat for the twilight soundtrack there are some points they have made

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): honestly how can people hate twilight when this absolute banger exists

**bespectacIed** (10): A deserving winner, I mean what else could it be aside from Ignorance, truly? I decided to forego a writeup that will explain in detail how the Twilight Saga trinity of novels, film series and soundtracks are a treasure, and will be the only facet of white literature that will be allowed to exist after the race/class revolution. Instead, I'll make do with saying Decode is one of the greatest songs ever made. Fire engine red hair hayley and company didn't have to snap this hard but they did, and produced a true classic.

**cremeebrulee** (10): ok i wouldve gave this an 11 but it’s NOT ON AMERICAN SPOTIFY ……..

**DraculaWeekend** (10): The best thing to come out of the Twilight movies. 11 contender

**engifear** (10): The Twilight soundtrack still owns my ass 12 years later

**fifteensunflwrs** (10): twilight was a great movie y'all just tasteless....

**ignitethephoenix** (10): think was my introduction to paramore, so I have to stan

**ImADudeDuh** (10): first rate winner that isn’t available on spotify may have arrived

**poptartchill** (10): this song is so good it justifies my Twilight phase

**sandyfishnets** (10): not a fan of the twilight vid tho

**skargardin** (10): I really have no relation with Twilight at all but I've always thought this was one of paramore's stronger singles. It just hits.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): tbh if this was actually on the album i would've given an 11 but i don't like giving 11s to non album songs so here we are. i loved twilight when i was younger but this song is better than the whole series and taylor lautner's abs

**twat\_brained** (10): more Evanescence-inspired heavy rock ballads!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This song is ACTUALLY amazing. Hayley’s voice is killer, as always, and the melody is so catchy! Would definitely be in the running for my 11, but I just wish it had a better ending…

**waluigiest** (10): twilight soundtrack never misses

**conceptualromance** (9): grateful that Hayley Williams was such a Twilight stan that she gave us this absolute bop

**duhchappers** (9): I know I’m not alone in being used to the live version on spotify. Honestly I prefer it now, the vocals sound more powerful

**Verdantshade** (9): shoutout I caught myself for being the superior twilight song

**fadedblue09** (8.7): It's one of Hayley's best performances, though I'll knock it a few points because I don't think it's relevant to the album's central theme and feels tacked on.

**1998tweety** (8.5): we love twilight

**anothertown** (8): HD remaster of the music video when?!

**seanderlust\_** (8): Okay, say what you want about the series, but the soundtracks to the Twilight films were banging.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): This feels very much like an All We Know is Falling b-side to me, considering how I'd heard good things about this song I was kinda dissapointed

**hikkaru** (7.5): this song gets the golden onion award from me

####**Would rather listen to the Twilight fan-fiction,'50 Shades of Grey', voiced by Gilbert Gottfried**

**modulum83** (6.5): i mean, nice guitar

**kirby31200** (6): I was looking at the lyrics on Genius and one of the annotations had a image with a trollface. That's not really relevant to my score I'm just angry

**TiltControls** (5.5): i watched the Twilight movies for the first time a few months ago and those movies are just full of yikes. soundtrack was cool, but I never really enjoyed this track much either way

**pig-serpent** (5): I've always found this one kinda boring. The vibe reminds me a lot of Flyleaf songs like "All Around Me," and "Again" which I like a lot more than this.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is gonna win isn’t it

####**The Razzie Award**

**Mysario** (10): My 4th favourite song in the rate (for those who counted, it goes Maps, New Perspective, and Donnie), this is just a pop-punk masterpiece and peak Paramore angst without sounding overtly childish. I'm honestly shocked it came in second here since this song goes SO HARD!!! It's in my top 3 Paramore tracks and while I'm sad it didn't win, second place is anything but an ignorant place to be!

---

####**Ignorance is still your best friend**

**cremeebrulee** (11): when this song first came out i had just gotten into a fight with my best friend and i set my aim status to the lyrics so he would know i was still mad at him LMAO

**ignitethephoenix** (11): absolute classic. One of my favourite songs from them

**Lizardman469** (11): the alternative to Misery Business that Hayley Willams can get behind

**seanderlust\_** (11): Righetous indignation in four minutes or less. This is the song for the petty high-school drama that you're not quite too old for.

**twat\_brained** (11): please watch this

**waluigiest** (11): This song is perfection. It awakens something in my core that makes me want to dance and punch someone at the same time. Few are doing it like this!!!

**astrologicalangel** (10): I LOVE a good friendship trouble song

**bespectacIed** (10): What a massive shift in history that those opening guitar riffs caused. Literally cannot find a single flaw in this song. This is the oLd pArAmOre at its peak and its finest. It's the band at their angriest and angstiest and not one head was left unscalped. The band really said "lemme amp up everything that the fans loved about us to the millionth degree and serve em with this pop punk classic." Seems like the obvious rate winner and even though it isn't mine, this has to win over men!

**conceptualromance** (10): banger

**DraculaWeekend** (10): the ENERGY

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh they fucking snapped on this

**intheaftermath** (10): The lyrics and the guitars work so well together on this one! Really captures the bitterness and I love it.

**jolteonhoodie** (10): I don't care what charts say, this was one of the biggest songs of 2009

**Leixander** (10): the song that got me into paramore but i rarely listen to it nowadays

**pig-serpent** (10): She angarie.

**poptartchill** (10): the definition of a banger

**skargardin** (10): iconic reset

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is genuinely one of the best angry songs ever

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): pissed off hayley is the best hayley

**Verdantshade** (10): wHEW a banger. love playing this on the guitar. also kinda salty that when I finally saw paramore after 8 years this was the only brand new eyes song they played :(

**1998tweety** (9): shes cute

**bbfan132** (9): hayley’s vocals sell the song for me, the power chords are great and all but she holds it together and brings it up to the next level for me

**duhchappers** (9): this song slaps, maybe the best melody from pre-After Laughter Paramore

**grinchelda** (8.5): my niece called my dog ignorant earlier, apparently it means annoying

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): God Paramore really is the best band for fun angry karaoke belting isn’t it? That’s a compliment btw. Those last “YOU TREAT ME JUUUST LIKE”s are just… yes honey!!

####**Didn't wanna feel your pain**

**plvstvcbvrds** (6): i love the music but i hate the lyrics

**fadedblue09** (4.7): Hot take incoming: I never liked this, even at the height of my Paramore phase. I’ve always found this too loud and immature, and sounds too much like a RIOT! leftover. And the older I get, the more obnoxious it becomes. Sorry!

**modulum83** (4.5): there are so many other songs on this album that are more melodic, more energetic, more fun. what does this have going for it? that it's dark and angry? i don't get it.

**Mysario** (10): I think like 10 rate scores in, we just knew this was winning. Well, I did. Someone else was 90% convinced "Decode" had it in the bag! Anyhow, I feel like I don't need to talk about this song. Y'all know why it's number one. ***BA-DA-BA BA-DA BA BA BA***

**CarlieScion** (9): So. Here we are. This is the official winner. This actually feels really underwhelming. It's a good song, but there are better songs on Brand New Eyes (and on the other albums but y'all aren't ready for that conversation!) The soft bridge and the ending BA DA BA BA is great tho.

---

####**Your World of Magic**

**agentofscranton** (11): everyone says hayley williams is unproblematic but yet here she is writing a song specifically to bully and call me out. very uncool.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): it was really tough choosing an 11 but i knew it was gonna be a song from this album. if this doesn’t win i’m done with everyone, this is simply a perfect song

**bbfan132** (10): the raw energy on this album and particularly in this song is perfect

**bespectacIed** (10): One of their best written songs, truly.  Love their fairy tale storytelling in an undeniably emo song. Fucking love that title, I really thought that was so cerebral back then lol. I love that the boys still created a \*kinda\* wistful vibe for a song with such uptempo, brash instrumentation. Love the iconic opening, the verses, the metaphors, the unforgettable chorus and hook (PARAPA PARAPAPARA!), and ofc that double bridge omfgggg ..... yeah hayley was right i DID build up a world of magic because my real life was tragic

**duhchappers** (10): really fucking hype, honestly forgot just how good this is, absolutely top tier

**fadedblue09** (10): If I had to give another 11 to this album, it would be this. It has my favorite MV of theirs, and the subject matter just hits close to home, even now. “Keep your feet on the ground, when your head’s in the clouds” is honestly an eye-opening lyric for my adolescent self.

**hikkaru** (10): one of paramore's best songs

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop but I also love the lyrics in this song so much

**pig-serpent** (10): One of Paramore's more poetic songs featuring all around excelling guitar work, neat drum fills, and the bass even pokes its head in a few times. Easily one of Paramore's best.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): a bit aggressive, but in a good way

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I thought Hayley was singing "Go get your chauffeur" for the longest time and this was about some out of touch rich girl, like a Marie Antoinette type character. Anyways, this song is so euphoric, the chorus is just an absolute highlight in Paramore's discography.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): parapaparapapara

**Roxieloxie** (10): Every time we rate paramore theres a song from their album that i dont know that i end up adding to my playlist and i think this is a strong contender.

**seanderlust\_** (10): The video for this song invented that one oversaturated yellow Instagram filter that nobody uses.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): will i be giving too mny 10s to Paramore? Probably but this song is still easily top 3 from the album

**Verdantshade** (10): 'she's ripping wings off of butterflies' a myspace bio for the ages. love love LOVE the music video, there's such a Romantic feel to this song despite being quite aggressive and as a pisces, there is no wonder that this was the song that started it all for me

**waluigiest** (10): this took some warming up but it’s so polished

**1998tweety** (9.5): oh wow ok this is hitting

**conceptualromance** (9.5): the menacing “ba da bop ba”s really take the song to another level

**Leixander** (9.5): this took some warming up, used to hate it a lot

**grinchelda** (9): paramore more like paracosm am i right

**intheaftermath** (9): So invigorating! I love it!

**kirby31200** (9): I think this should've been the opening track. The "Badum Bum Ba Da"s are so exciting and get me hyped

**modulum83** (9): i can't decide whether the lyrics are super dumb or super fun. the song itself is the latter for sure though!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): iconic but not a 10

**skargardin** (8): the bangers won't stop coming ugh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i actually dont really like the parapa parts that much

**twat\_brained** (8): energetic and high-octane yes, but the "ba da ba" lyrics just highlight a lapse in songwriting integrity to me

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Oh this bridge is heavenly… and the rest of the song is great too! BA DAH BAH BA DAH BAH

**poptartchill** (7.5): I feel like the ending really elevates it. I somehow forgot about this song for a while and I'm happy this rate gave me the excuse to revisit it because it's a good one.

####**Your Real Life is Tragic**

**anothertown** (6): I DON’T miss 2009 at all

CarlieScion: EFF YALL FOR MAKING ME UPSET THIS ALBUM DID SO WELL


# Brand New Eyes

---

**Overall Average**: 7.864 **// Average Controversy:** 1.801

---

**bespectacIed** (9.769): One of my favorite teenhood albums. A landmark album for the pop punk genre. Paramore's songwriting has always been too good for emo, but their maturity truly emerged here in Brand New Eyes. The stories being told are more nuanced, have a more defined vision, sometimes funny, sometimes poetic, always with the Paramore trademark vulnerability. This being their only album where their four core instrumentalists are all present explains why this album sounds so fucking flawless. Still sad that it's the last Farro brothers album because damn, OT5 Paramore really was an unstoppable force (lmao ot5, annyeong haseyo Paramore-imnida). I feel bad for the other two albums in this rate because honestly, I don't give a fuck about them!

**Lizardman469** (9.769): After Laughter tried it really did try to take the crown from this album and it just didn't

**Verdantshade** (9.308): this is one of my favourite albums of all time and THE album that got me listening to music. I wasn't into music at all until late 2010 when I heard brick by boring brick; I thought paramore seemed pretty cool and checked this album out. I then started looking for more music, and today, music is literally my life. I have this album to thank for so much, especially when it got me through some hard times (no pun intended) as I became a teenager. brand new eyes has also aged the best out of the albums on this rate, it never comes across as pretentious or edgy, but incredibly raw

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9.308): this is paramore’s 2nd best album behind self-titled and easily one of the best albums of all time, there were at least 5 contenders for my 11.

**Leixander** (8.923): is it too obvious that i stan paramore? no?

**fifteensunflwrs** (8.923): their best album, periodt

**waluigiest** (8.462): Paramore’s range is unmatched. They are the best band ever.

**conceptualromance** (8.338): this is my fave Paramore album but I’ll admit it sags a bit in the middle

**skargardin** (8.231): This era was where I turned into a Paramore fan through and through. The singles are among some of their best material imo, Ignorance and Playing God just hit so hard for me.

**fadedblue09** (8.162): My 2nd favorite Paramore album, only behind Self-Titled. Compared to the other two albums, this one is a bit more grounded in its lyrical themes, being more personal and tackling typical themes of youth. However, it worked in their favor, since they’re also the only one that manages to avoid sounding pretentious. In hindsight, it was pretty obvious the band was starting to crumble from here, but they somehow managed to use to that their advantage. I wish I could stan them harder and give them straight 10’s, but overall I’m a bit more able to point out its flaws now.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.077): This album is the one that’s most dissimilar to the other two, I think. Not only is it not trying to be as artsy, Paramore in general doesn’t extensively use metaphors in their lyrics like FOB and Panic do. In a way, that makes them easier to decipher and connect to, but it also means that they risk sounding more generic and uninspired. But I think that Brand New Eyes has the energy, passion, and TALENT that only Paramore can produce!

**poptartchill** (7.923): While I've heard most of these songs before (and even seen them live!) this is actually my first time completely listening through the album. I would maybe change around the tracklist but I really enjoyed this album and I will be listening to it more!

**jolteonhoodie** (7.731): The first half is great but the second half is just not that good imo

**pig-serpent** (7.615): The weird transition album between the great but inconsistant pop punk RIOT and the band's more alternative magnum opus. The band sounds a little tired on this album and the backhalf runs out of steam, even though the front half is fantastic.

**grinchelda** (7.592): i have nowhere near the emotional attachment to this album as i do the other two

**RandomHypnotica** (7.546): I think there's definitely some highlights on here, but for the most part I was kind of dissapointed, a lot of the instrumentals just kinda fell flat for me

**jackisboredtoday** (7.477): the only album here where I don’t regard it as the peak of the band who made it (even though Paramore has made loads of my all-time favorite songs). I still have a good lot of songs from this era that I cherish to this day, but most of the songs I revisit most form them are either from Riot or from their more recent 2010s output. There are gems here but a lot of the second half of the album is made up of songs I never really found myself coming back to all that much.

**DraculaWeekend** (7.462): I really like Paramore, but if I'm being honest, this rate is probably the first time I'm hearing this album in full.

**modulum83** (7.200): I do not like pop punk. I am sorry. Paramore's self-titled is one of my favorite albums of all time, and After Laughter is one of my most replayed. But the records before that I really cannot get into, although I can definitely tell that Brand New Eyes is an album that is excellent in quality, creative and thoughtful and driving with energy. Every time the band strips it back and lets the songwriting shine or comes up with a really catchy riff, I can really appreciate this album. But otherwise, it stands out from the other 2 here - and not in a good way.

**ktajlili** (7.154): I loved this album when it first came out, but not as much as Hard Times. The instrumentals are great, and I think this is where Haley really begins to show her potential as a songwriter. A solid rock album with a modern twist, the themes of frustration resonated with me as a teenager.

**kirby31200** (6.846): A distant third place, sorry

**CactusWithinUs** (6.769): This album was (almost) completely new to me so it was a pleasant surprise! It was a pretty enjoyable record (for the most part) and I love Hayley's voice especially, but it does drag on for a tad too long imo. Feel like some filler could be weeded out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.269): To be quite honest, I’m not that big a fan of Paramore’s pre-self titled work, and this album is no exception. All the songs sound so similar to each other that it’s hard to distinguish them from each other at times.

**anothertown** (5.154): this album is the lowest point of Paramore’s discography for me. I find it very generic and most of it washed right over me. They were about to hit really high highs with self-titled and after laughter (and I bop to riot and AWKIF as we all should) so I do not begrudge them anything

JunkyGS: Wow to have number 1 song and number 2 song be a difference of 4 points, literally enough to be decided by 1 person, is pretty crazy! 

I still think Ignorance is a much more dynamic song then brick, but still Paramore got what they deserved 👀❤️ It was so interesting to read the general consciousness around all these albums because I really had no clue what the fan narratives about each album were!!
