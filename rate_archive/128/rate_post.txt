###Intro

what's up fuckers it's finally time to rate some TikTok hits

and no this is not the Kesha hit that is later in this rate cycle

&nbsp;

Okay, but time for a real intro - and do we really need one?

We all know the app. [We have all seen](https://redd.it/ds7xoc) [the various posts](https://redd.it/nfmxwp) about the app. [We all remember Trump trying to ban them](https://redd.it/i1lb4d) (almost exactly) a year ago [and then promptly forgetting to do exactly that.](https://redd.it/jsg28m) We can list off various stars rising from the app, various celebrities revitalizing their careers on the app, various musicians getting a career from the app.

But do we know what the sub thinks about the quintessential TikTok hits? Well, we're about to find out.

###The Songs

The format of this rate is as follows:

* the ten biggest songs on TikTok,
* twenty selections personally made by me, and
* thirty-three songs voted in by you, the community!

[About a week ago](https://youtu.be/vJwKKKd2ZYE?t=135) I made [a voting post](https://redd.it/ooswhl) for the last section of this format and the results came in! The song list is below.

&nbsp;

**Biggest Songs**

1.	Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion – "WAP"
* Conkarah & Shaggy – "Banana - DJ Fle Minisiren Remix"
* Doja Cat – "Say So"
* Jawsh 685 – "Laxed - Siren Beat"
* K Camp – "Lottery (Renegade)"
* Olivia Rodrigo – "drivers license"
* Puri, Jhorrmountain & Adje – "Coño"
* SAINt JHN – "Roses - Imanbek Remix"
* StaySolidRocky – "Party Girl"
* Surfaces – "Sunday Best"

This is a rough list, but all of these songs are generally considered the biggest songs on the app due to either straight up sound usage or overall virality of the song.

**Personal Selections**

1.	Absofacto – "Dissolve"
* BENEE & Gus Dapperton – "Supalonely"
* Clare Rosinkranz – "Backyard Boy"
* Curtis Waters & Harm Franklin – "Stunnin'"
* Dixie – "Be Happy"
* Fousheé – "Deep End"
* Freddie Dredd – "Opaul"
* Issam Alnajjar – "Hadal Abhek"
* Jack Stauber – "Buttercup"
* Joji – "SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK"
* Lil Kapow – "BLACKOUT"
* MGMT – "Little Dark Age"
* Molchat Doma – "Судно (Борис Рижий)"
* Nathan Evans – "Wellerman (Sea Shanty) - 220 KID x Billen Ted Remix"
* Pop Smoke & Lil Tjay – "Mood Swings"
* SALES – "Chinese New Year"
* The Kid LAROI – "WITHOUT YOU"
* TOKYO'S REVENGE – "GOODMORNINGTOKYO!"
* Trevor Daniel – "Falling"
* Y2K & bbno$ – "Lalala"

These hits are pulled from the various 'sides' of TikTok, from various times in the app's history, and from (at the time) unknowns who are now rising music stars.

Also, some of these songs fucking suck. BUT - I just think they are important to the story of the app, which I will cover extensively reveal weekend. :)

**Voted Selections**

1.	Addison Rae – "Obsessed"
* Arizona Zervas – "ROXANNE"
* Ashnikko – "Daisy"
* Aurora – "Runaway"
* Beach Bunny – "Cloud 9"
* Bella Poarch – "Build a Bitch"
* Bill Wurtz – "Just Did A Bad Thing"
* Clairo – "Sofia"
* CMTEN & Glitch Gum – "NEVER MET!"
* Conan Gray – "Heather"
* Cookie Kawaii – "Vibe (If I Back It Up)"
* Dayglow – "Can I Call You Tonight?"
* Don Toliver – "No Idea"
* EllyOtto – "SugarCrash!"
* Frances Forever – "space girl"
* girl in red – "we fell in love in october"
* IamDoechii – "Yummy Blucky Fruitcake"
* Jack Harlow – "WHATS POPPIN"
* Kero Kero Bonito – "Flamingo"
* Masked Wolf – "Astronaut in the Ocean"
* Miki Matsubara – "真夜中のドア/Stay With Me"
* Mother Mother – "Hayloft"
* mxmtoon – "prom dress"
* Måneskin – "I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE"
* Perfume Genius – "Otherside"
* Regard – "Ride It"
* Rico Nasty – "Pussy Poppin (I Don't Really Talk Like This)"
* Roddy Ricch – "The Box"
* Studio Killer – "Jenny (I Wanna Ruin Our Friendship)"
* Sufjan Stevens – "Mystery of Love"
* Tramp Stamps – "I'd Rather Die"
* will.i.am – "Big and Chunky"
* YOASOBI – "夜に駆ける" (Yoru ni Kakeru)

A ton of amazing hits on the app from various times in the app's history and various sides of TikTok! I'm honestly so pumped with these results, there really is a wide variety of hits showcased here and I am so excited to see how these songs perform.

&nbsp;

As is tradition with most rates on /r/popheads, there is a bonus rate as well. I compiled a list of ten meme songs from throughout the history of the app that are pretty memorable overall. These songs are below.

**Bonus Rate**

1.	LIL MAYO – "Be Gone Thot!"
2.	The Backyardigans – "Castaways"
3.	LeviathanJPTV – "Chug Jug With You (Number One Victory Royale)" 
4.	Zack Fox & Kenny Beats – "Jesus Is The One (I Got Depression)"
5.	[Odyssey – "Native New Yorker - Wendy Williams Cover"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoOaP5rZ7Cw) 
6.	Louisa Melcher – "New York Summer"
7.	The Living Tombstone, BlackGryph0n & LittleJayneyCakes – "No Mercy"
8.	Millie B – "M to the B"
9.	Jason Segel & Walter – "Man or Muppet"
10. Tiagz – "They Call Me Tiago (Her Name Is Margo)"

The only song not on streaming is the "Native New Yorker" cover.

###Rules

These are definitely not copy / pasted from the POLLEN Rate I hosted last year and are clearly originally written with this rate in mind:

-	Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). Decimal points are allowed, but only to one place (ex. 7.1 is acceptable, but not 7.15). I do not give a shit what you give the songs as long as it is between those two numbers.
-	You have to rate every single song in the main rate. If you skip any and do not give us a score when I ask you for one, your ballot will not be counted. This is because the program used to determine the results will break if scores are not successfully put in and I will cry if the program breaks because it will be a pain in the ass to do this manually.
-	You may give **one song a zero (0)** and **one song an eleven (11)**. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. **If you do use either your zero (0) or your eleven (11), it is strongly encouraged to leave a comment on the track.** It can be as short or as long as you want, but please leave one; it will help the sub understand if you should be cancelled or not when the rate is being revealed.
  - This 0 and 11 cannot be used on the bonus rate. Those scores should only be on a 1-10 scale.
-	Please use the prepared link to submit your scores! That is the only form of ballot I will accept. I spent a lot of time and effort on it, so please use it.
  - Note: if you’re trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout, it may not work; I have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, so you should use a computer to send in your scores (if possible)!
-	If you desire to change any of the scores after you have already submitted them, simply message me and I will be glad to help! My life is much less boring since the POLLEN Rate, but I still have time for rate stuff, obviously.
-	If I believe your scores include any form of sabotage, I reserve the right to ask you to change them or your ballot will be denied. Sabotage will be defined as extremely low overall average(s) that show a clear bias against the rate as a whole. If you truly hate the songs given low scores, I strongly encourage you to write comments on them. This indicates to us that you are not trying to rig the results, meaning everything will go smoothly. :)
-	Your scores should not be considered confidential! Don’t be scared to share them. Go nuts. Campaign for whatever song you gave an eleven to. Or not. It really is not that deep.

---

###Commenting Guideline

It is also highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart’s desire, like this:

>	The Box: 10 ee ur

Any format other than this is NOT good and you will deeply hurt me if you do not follow the example given here. This includes:

>	Be Happy: 1: Don't tell me what to do.

>	I'd Rather Die: than listen to this s0ng!

>	Cloud 9: I will give this song a 9 because of the song title. Haha. Comedy gold.

>	WHATS POPPIN: 10 - /u/Roxieloxie fuck you

>	ROXANNE: (7) one time I was trying to get with this closeted frat bro and he said this song was a banger and I agreed and I never even got the pipe and that's not even the most embarrassing thing I've done for a man that relates to a song in this rate
