TragicKingdom1: /u/TiltControls we need the stats on the average and controversy sis
[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf0516h/]

=====

CrimsonROSET: from a quick check, its not in the top10 controversy, but it is the **2nd lowest** rate average.
[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf05gtv/]

=====

TiltControls: Yep! With the super low average definitely excited to see how it plays out today!

Also for controversy it is tied with Winners II for 14th highest!

=====

b_o_g_o_: how the fuck did the 2012 billboard rate get that low of an average
[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf07yjc/]

=====

frogaranaman: about 20 different country songs that all got 2-4 averages
[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf08mt2/]

=====

TiltControls: This. Though even then some of the scores were super harsh for the rate (Rolling in the Deep as the lowest scoring winner, songs from popheads faves not even getting to 7, only 7 songs from the list even cracking an 8 average)
[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf0ah40/]

[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf06v8k/]

=====

just_thonking: Proud to say I used every multiple of 0.5 between 1 and 10 (so like 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, etc.) for my scores, plus my 0 and 11. For context I think before this rate I'd given like one or two 4s ever and nothing lower
[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf081eg/]

=====

xavieryes: I rarely use decimals by I did use every integer number from 0 to 11 except for 6 in the main rate, and all of them if the bonus rate counts

frogaranaman: [Join the Beatsense room!](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj#/) Until the start of the reveal, some notes:

everything I have learned about the Tramp Stamps has been against my will and I want that to be clearly known

---

#this is camp

**brenda\_official** (10): camp classic i think

**jman457** (10): I love how mad this song makes everyone. Its a Camp and hyperpop meets rrriot gurl masterpiece but yall aren’t ready for that conversation

**rickikardashian** (10): **DEPRESSED TRAMP STAMPS MOODBOARD** // *”I’d rather die >!                                                               !<“*

**stryxen** (10): there is a good chance i may break and give this my 11. This was a moment and not because it’s bad, the song is whatever, but its reputation precedes itself by a mile and transforms this weird ingenuine punk girlboss monstrosity into a defining commentary on industry plants, gatekeeping, and the importance of genuinity in the genres it tried to imitate. Was it a conversation that needed to be had by uninformed teenagers on social media? Not really. Was it a clunky conversation full of misunderstandings, misinformation and terrible takes that caused a mess and made me laugh? yes. It just makes me laugh, everything about this band, this song, their social media presence, the rollout of their ep, the reception on tiktok was hilarious and i’m not sure there will ever be a moment like this on social media again. Also this gets stuck in my head and i like it idc idc idc if i were a braver man i would give my 11 to a bottom 5 lock but i’d like to maybe have some stakes going into day 3 this time.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): this song is ridiculous, problematic, and completely manufactured. But I’ll have that hook stuck in my head until the day I die.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I feel personally attacked, not only for being a straight white guy... Check my username 👀 That's a banger.

**intheaftermath** (9): it's not that I'd rather die than hookup with another straight white guy, it's that i don't want to hook up with one at all

**95ztaehyung** (8.5): i’m sorry it’s kinda good

**plastichaxan** (8): pleek y'all made it seem like this was awful and it's better than half the rate come on

**schwiftydude047** (8): admit it. you thought of a specific character or celebrity, or friend as she started listing off names.

**tinaoe** (8): SUE ME it's catchy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): these are IRONY POINTS ugh my annoying millennial ass lol. It's so bad at this point it's transcended to camp. I hope people scream this at bars 10 years from now. This song sucks, but it's funny now.

**nt96** (7.5): lol tell us how you really feel

**AHSWeeknd** (7): a bop, lyrically.

**banmoderator** (7): because the whole controversy made me laugh

**celladonn** (7): I think the level of hate they got was completely overblown so my score is perhaps slightly inflated out of pity. But this is just too dumb for me to dislike despite it sucking

**Iris3271** (7): Fuck these girls and Dr. Luke but I honestly don't hate it

**shhhneak** (7): “I’d rather die than spend another night with another Kyle” yeah that checks out.

**throwaway7650** (7): the laugh at the beginning help... the lyrics are kind of funny

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): honestly i don't see why this is so hated, i've heard much cringier songs that people took seriously

**aestheticen** (6): Why is this song in this rate?

**bigbigbee** (6): I don’t tend to hear lyrics on my first or second plays of a song unless they’re REALLY clear or notable, and on a music level I’m a sucker for pop punk, even artificial, derivative pop punk like this. Luckily I listened to the lyrics enough for this rate to realize that they really are that bad!

**hikkaru** (5.5): camp stamps
[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf0bb46/]

=====

frogaranaman: #they would rather die than listen to this song again

**rslashpoopheads** (5): so true bestie

**thedoctordances1940** (5): I get all the fake shit but it's not terrible

**pleasegivemeasword** (4.5): oh so you hate men? name every man.

**cheatviathan** (4): I was initially feeling this when the first verse came in. That guitar riff evokes a specific kind of early aughts mood that I adore. The lyrics are something I choose to interpret as satire, like an absurdist gender flip of the misogyny that the worst of these pop punk groups put out. Then came the vocal processing and synths in the chorus, which clash with everything else in an ugly, horrific way.

**hephaestionline** (4): okay so this is an okay-ish song like if we ignore the lyrics but surely there were other songs which should've made the rate shortlist

**jasannn** (4): It's not that bad tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Soooo I actually don’t mind 75% of the song. But that second verse is so out of pocket… There are many, many, MANY things to criticize men about… don’t think erectile dysfunction is one of them. Also they said my name and I am neither straight nor white so I feel compelled to rate it bad

**camerinian** (3): I honestly didn't hate this like its reputation would suggest, mostly just cos I feel like this band needs therapy more than they need a record contract

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (3): The ME! of 2021.

**GARjuna** (3): INDUSTRY PLANTZZZZZZ!!!!! fuck it's boring. Pop-punk without any of the charm or authenticity

**Hulnia** (3): This is awful, but I’d rather die than see Astronaut In The Ocean over it. 

 (and it’s kinda catchy 😳)

**kreddit2** (3): i feel really bad for any guy who listens to this song :/ it's not even a good song about bad sex. also feels really dated.

**sssaaage** (3): its really not as bad as yall act like it is but its still bad

**teenwitches** (3): they claim to be bringing punk back but this is just weezer's beverly hills with fake feminist lyrics

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoWWab/

**welcome2thejam** (3): I'd Rather Die but every time I listen to it they add more and more guys' names to the chorus

**slimboyfriend** (2.9): maybe Tramps Stamps was actually a performance art piece about girlboss feminism under capitalism. Maybe they're camp! Either way, y'all are ruthless for including this lmao

**bluepupz** (2.5): I don't like the Autotuned parts. However, some of these lyrics could be direct quotes from my college friends so I'm dying lmao.

**apatel27** (2): lyrics are so terrible

**Brendon-Urine** (2): hate myself for getting this stuck in my head sometimes

**flibbityflob** (2): what is there to say but bug ass.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (2): get a better industry plant

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (2): wow this is bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): this is literally just your average dorian electra song

**whatsanillinois** (2): i don't think they say my name thank god. would've never recovered from that one

**pig-serpent** (1.5): The instrumental is limp, the melody is awkward as hell and doesn't fit the song, and political lesbianism is cringe. I know it's getting last place but there are enough songs here I think are worst to give it an extra .5.

**akanewasright** (1): This is just kind of nothing? It’s not the end of the world but it’s bad. Like really bad. Their voices remind me of like… late 10s musical theater actresses trying to sing pop/rock or indie themed material, except with way less… idk, meat to the voice. Usually this gimmick is done to make the voice sound “dark” or “interesting” before the actress belts her ass off, and their belts on this song still sound just as stupid.

**arhmaer** (1): ok then dont. whos making you. who is forcing you

**avg-vag** (1): this is really a zero

**cremeebrulee** (1): i think she just named 75% of the participants of this rate by name

**CrimsonROSET** (1): bug ass

**ignitethephoenix** (1): I’d rather die than hear this song again

**ImADudeDuh** (1): something something “relatable”

**joeeswift** (1): this song is pandering to a niche group on tiktok, this groups entire aesthetic is just “look at us we are quirky white girls who hate basic white boys”, it kinda feels inauthentic?

**lost-ln-the-echo** (1): I'd rather die than listen to this again

**RandomHypnotica** (1): pathetic

**ReallyCreative** (1): I'd Rather Die than listen to this song again

**runaway3212** (1): I too would like to die

**skargardin** (1): good god

**steelstepladder** (1): MY CAR IS IN THE FRONT YAAAAAAAAAAAARD AND IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): They were so convinced they were doing something subveserive with this

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (1): of all the annoying songs in this rate, this one might take the cake..

**Uberpigeon** (1): butt fux outsold

**Verrem** (1): pop-punk should have stayed dead

**waluigiest** (1): I hate this for both the content and the fact it was clearly written with the goal of becoming a tiktok sound

**wavingwolves** (1): the fact this isn't even their worst song or worst lyrics

**1998tweety** (0): hideous lyrics and its not even a good song

**2dina3dworld** (0): this was an easy zero, and it all hinges on how much Trampstamps fuck me off. Firstly, let’s start with the lyrics “he was a skater boi, she was a tumblr girl” like shut up!!! Tumblr bullied your bug asses off the platform, and y’all couldn’t even tell us where you got your shoelaces from! Secondly, I hate to be snobbish but these girls do not understand what riot grrrl is. Riot grrrl is fighting against the establishment, and being genuine in standing up for each other, not capitalising off of hot button issues while also not providing any substantive criticism of any of the issues they talk about or any meaningful dialogue. Whenever r/popheads decides to talk about industry plants again, I’m going to just link the tramp stamps tumblr tag. No further explanation. They are the industry plants. Somehow both offensive and bland at the same time. The ultimate capitalist attempt to commercialise music and profit off of people’s genuine traumatic experiences. The only thing they’re good for is weed smoking girlfriends jokes.

**2RINITY** (0): I know the Auto-Tune and lyrics grab most of the attention, but this song fails at even the most basic shit. The drums sound like they machine-programmed the main beat and the actual drummer only played the fills. The bassline in the chorus is high up enough on the neck that it actively fights with the rhythm guitar part over which one of them gets to signal the chord changes. The verse guitar sounds like they had to change it last-minute because they realized they'd accidentally stolen the "Beverly Hills" riff from Weezer. It's just a total disaster from start to finish. No wonder they instantly killed their careers with it

**Awkward\_King** (0): the first note of this is the same as jail by kanye right ? jail for that. also not my name being in the outro

**bbfan132** (0): :naur:

**BoneStreetSand** (0): Can’t think of a joke, but that’s okay because these guys made a big enough joke of themselves to make up for it.

**HogwartsReject1912** (0): I mean

**jackisboredtoday** (0): yeah this is bad. I am very sorry about the generic 0 but it just is. congratulations everyone on being right

**jsonphile** (0): look maybe someone could do this type of song right with the right sense of irony and sarcasm but the tramp stamps are not that artist. I have no idea if they’re trying to be funny here (they’re not) or they’re being serious and think this is some strong antiracist/feminist message (which it definitely isn’t). Seriously I think these girls are trying to set feminism back 50 years. And no I’m not salty just because I’m also a straight white guy and they even say my name when listing white boy names. I’m all for making fun of straight white men, but this isn’t it.

**just\_thonking** (0): part of me wonders if I'm just influenced by the TRAMPS STAMPS hate train, but yeesh this song just feels and sounds bad. There is nothing redeemable about it. Definitely worthy of my first ever zero.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (0): Look, it's Tramp Stamps, of course I'm giving this one a zero. I would've said it sounds like Josie & The Pussycats, but at least that band made some actual bops! (Stream "3 Small Words".)

**ProfeNeuro** (0): about as punk and counterculture as x ambassadors selling the whole independent renegade underdogs shtick to get people to buy a jeep back in 2015. Tramp stamps and tramp stamps can fuck off.

**qazz23** (0): Really annoying vocals, nothing about this is good

**Roxieloxie** (0): /u/rickikardashian & /u/imadudeduh FUCK YOU

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): this song is the anti-WAP

**seanderlust** (0): misandry….M I S AH N D R Y… the hatred of, or pathological aversion to, Ryans or Kyles or Spencers or Robs or

**static\_int\_husp** (0): not only are they hacks but they're also bad musicians

**TiltControls** (0): Tramp Stamps is one of the few acts on here I've heard of before, so maybe this 0 is playing into that but this song is just... not good.

**vayyiqra** (0): Yeah this song is as horrible as we thought when it came out. The lyrics are gross and regressive, it's a boring song, their singing is awful and nasal and barely on-key. It's like a parody of 90s alt-rock but a very bad one. It's embarrassing. I hope we all forget about it soon because it's not even worth talking about anymore. It's just cringe.

this isn't even ironically good it's just kinda sad (n) This song really is one of my bottom two least favorite Tiktok influencer songs in existence (my least favorite is not in this rate...). There really isn't anything positive I can say about this - the songwriting is trite, the instrumental sounds like it was taken straight from a Youtube FL studios tutorial titled "HOW TO MAKE A POP SONG - NEW 2020 CURRENT TRENDS MUST WATCH", and Dixie genuinely sounds uninterested in the whole thing. I think my favorite artist quote about this song is that she would be "embarrassed to hear [her own] song at a frat party" because it implies two things: 1. Dixie D'Amelio is attending frat parties, and 2. frat parties would play this song. Just too funny to not mention, and literally 99% of the reason why I chose this song because I wanted to mention that comment. (n) Anyways this song fucking sucks.

#influencers have feelings too!!!!!!!!

**rickikardashian** (10): i mean, personally i would like to feel genuine happiness for once, but at the end of the day we are both not happy so i relate to her

**runaway3212** (9): Fine I'll admit I like this song. The remix is even better

**cremeebrulee** (8): immigrant moms when you tell them you have clinical depression:

**joeeswift** (7.5): aged quite well...obligatory 'ᗷᕼᑌᗴᔕᒍYᗴᔕ'

**seanderlust** (7.5): this is actually a really sweet and insightful song about allowing yourself to wallow in sadness. sometimes that's what you need, and it's nice to hear a song that accepts that.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): clunky lyrics aside, this is a bit of a bop

**HogwartsReject1912** (7): I like the pre-chorus okay? And I was going through a phase where I was really into Dixie D'amelio at this time. Found her cool and chill and relatable.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): wow I can’t believe I relate to Dixie D’Amelio

**vayyiqra** (7): This isn't bad as it sounds in theory, which is "very"

**jman457** (6.9): Honestly not the worst song on here, Billie Eilish has been real quiet since this dropped

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): honestly not the worst melody, the production just needs to be cleaned up

**akanewasright** (6): This song is so aimless and dumb. Unfortunately it sounds like the kind of radio filler I have nostalgia for, so I can’t tank

**best-american-record** (6): liked this a lot more than i was expecting to

**bigbigbee** (6): For some reason, I keep thinking it could use more didgeridoo…not sure what’s up with that…

**flibbityflob** (6): The lyrics are solid, and like...I'm going through a very rough patch, and yeah. It hits hard. Like...yeah, sometimes I don't want to be happy.

**GARjuna** (6): I'm not depressed enough for this

**nootnoot781** (6): this is actually phoebe bridgers for tweens and i respect that :)

**steelstepladder** (6): I mean same but

**thedoctordances1940** (6): Suprisingly not too bad

**throwaway7650** (6): I really don't like song titles that represent the opposite of the lyrics (song title-fished?), the song isn't bad but docking .5 points for that

**TiltControls** (6): it's fine? i feel like i'm expecting these to be so much worse than they end up being

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.1): I can relate (woo)

frogaranaman: #fuck them kids

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): big corporate energy

**bluepupz** (5): I unfortunately did not like her vocal delivery here - she almost sounds off-pitch at times. Idk, it's a pretty inoffensive song that tries to be more emotional than it actually is?

**cheatviathan** (5): The moment I hear the acoustic guitar line with the finger snaps, I immediately feel compelled to change the station, and the vocals are so-so. I like the sentiment of the song, but that’s no reason for me to return to this when “Rose-Colored Boy” has similar themes and is a genuinely great song to boot..

**educationalmirror** (5): it's not as bad as people pretend, I'm sure some middle schooler found solace in this

**hephaestionline** (5): Dixie doesn't show up on my FYP but this is okay ig

**hookerofpop** (5): nothing really stands out

**kreddit2** (5): it's not bad (or good) but it's not my thing. also v generic

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): sometimes I don’t wanna be happy either, really makes you think

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The autotune is very subtle at first but once you catch on to it it suddenly becomes real distracting lol. But I must be honest with myself: this is a lot better than I always thought “Dixie D’Amelio’s debut single” would sound!

**aestheticen** (4): I'd rather they sing a song about partying or putting their hands up in the air than try to be all deep and then sucking at that

**banmoderator** (4): it's kinda funny lol

**CrimsonROSET** (4): see, in theory i like this song, but it loses so much meaning on just how in your face it is about everything

**jsonphile** (4): was this song popular on tiktok? Or is it on here because it’s by a tiktoker? Because I can’t imagine anyone really wanting to do anything with this bland, completely empty song. How would someone use it in a tiktok? It’s not an interesting type of bad, it’s honestly okay to listen to, there’s just not anything memorable about it

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): this feels like a pretty standard pop girl's song, like I feel like anyone could sing this? Idk it's just not very interesting

**rotating3Dtext** (4): this lyrics are so deep man

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJw5Nr1/

**Uberpigeon** (4): the disappointing sigh i let out when the snapping fingers and guitar came in... no

**waluigiest** (4): for one day,

**jackisboredtoday** (3.5): i’m sorry because i’m sure there’s equally empty and mediocre songs i’ve given 6’s to but the flaws here are too apparent & this doesn’t have the catchiness to force me to accept it

**plastichaxan** (3.5): the way i would've ate this up if i had listened in like 2015 when i liked twenty one pilots...which justifies this score

**Square\_Preparation55** (3.5): inauthentic song, but she gets some credit for buhyees

**slimboyfriend** (3.1): "It's a salt that's on my tongue.... DUNGH"

**celladonn** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaSukw7uaXM

**jasannn** (3): Dixie just spoiled the ending of Inside Out.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**schwiftydude047** (3): the instrumental is pretty okay but the lyrics are bland.

**static\_int\_husp** (3): The easiest way to be happy is to turn off this song

**teenwitches** (3): vocals thinner than tissue paper with a $2 beat they bought on fiverr

**just\_thonking** (2.5): if "low effort" was a song

**1998tweety** (2): i mean

**2RINITY** (2): Ughhhhhhh leave this misery-pop in the late 2010s where it belongs. It's a new decade. Reject despair, return to rage

**AHSWeeknd** (2): where’s… the substance , it’s so bland

**Brendon-Urine** (2): EXACTLY what you'd expect from someone like her doing music.

**camerinian** (2): jesus is it 2016 again

**duochromepalmtree** (2): it’s so bad it almost seems like they were playing a prank on her. You would think they could’ve had someone give it a decent mix at least! But I just can’t hate her or her sister and I give her props for continuing to put out music even though everyone is begging her to stop.

**hikkaru** (2): can she use her tiktok coin to get better mixing

**Iris3271** (2): Some people shouldn't sing

**MrMoodle** (2): gotta be the blandest song in the rate

**skargardin** (2): it was way worse than I anticipated skull

**stryxen** (2): it’s really like that bad

**tinaoe** (2): sounds kind of like a discount therapy session

**welcome2thejam** (2): I know privileged people can be depressed too and nobody should be afraid of expressing sadness and all that, but hoo boy, filming this specific music video with this specific message inside a giant mansion is a Choice

**whatsanillinois** (2): the only good thing about listening to this song is knowing that big and chunky is next

**xavieryes** (2): i get the point but i don't need this song to make me feel worse so no thanks

**2dina3dworld** (1): me when I trip over my dog when I wake up in the night to have a midnight snack: Bruceeee

**arhmaer** (1): live laugh stand in a multi million dollar mansion and whine about how sad i am xoxoxo jesus fucking CHRIST

**avg-vag** (1): im convinced this song was programmed by an algorithm to be relatable

**bbfan132** (1): no thanks

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): This is a 0 contender. How do gentrify sad white girl 2014 tumblr?! That's almost an impressive feat.

**IIIHenryIII** (1): I have so many reasons to not not like this song… It's so generic. If this song was a person, I would hate them with all of my strength, and I like everyone. This song is literally the reason why wannabe hippies shit on pop music. It's so lazy and uninspiring. It has the soul of recent sad pop but the shell of late trends that were never good in pop songs. It sounds dated sonically but modern lyrically. I must confess though: 12-year-old me would have eaten this song. Ew!

**ImADudeDuh** (1): stop it.

**pig-serpent** (1): This song sucks. Overproduced millennial pop nightmare with #relatable lyrics. The entire song sounds algorithmically generated to appeal to depressed twitter teens and missing the mark because it doesn't fully commit and instead thinks it can appease everyone.

**ProfeNeuro** (1): celebrities have feelings too 🥺🥺 let me be sad with my millions of dollars to my name https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qloJltAENHk/hqdefault.jpg

**RandomHypnotica** (1): :)

**Roxieloxie** (1): frog what the god damn fuck is this. everything i have learned about these sisters has been against my will

**sssaaage** (1): why does everyone feel the need to release a song like sometimes it needed to be left in the drafts

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): was half expecting for them to throw a who can relate? (woo!) in this

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): Emily Montes did it better

**wavingwolves** (1): it sounds like you don't want me to be happy either

**intheaftermath** (0): Emily Montes did it better and she's literally 5.

**nt96** (0): I don’t use tikitok that much and I never cared for the tiktok drama/discourse but after seeing side by side comparisons of her dances and the black tiktok dancers she's copied from, I was a bit concerned. Then I realized how Dixie and Charli are getting all these endorsements, acting gigs and record deals, and for what? I cant imagine how pissed I would be if I worked so hard on creating a great dance only for someone else to mediocrely copy it and instantly skyrocket into fame. And don’t even get me started on this song. It sounds like a half-assed parody of a pop song. Its equal parts inspiring and a bit frustrating to know that as someone who produces music as a hobby, I can definitely vocalize and make better music than this crap. It's forgettable, soulless and there's no way this is leaving the bottom 5. Stay sad child.

**ReallyCreative** (0): quite possibly one of the worst songs I've ever heard wow

**shhhneak** (0): If this isn’t one of the lowest rated scores in rate history we’ve failed as a subreddit.

#party socialite lifestyle

**MrMoodle** (11): this song is so horrendous it’s actually perfect. every time i hear it i start grinning like a fucking weirdo. “i told her call me rocky, she say she not gon’ call me that” is the funniest sincere line i’ve ever heard in my life. just the absolute droning monotony and lack of any musical development across the song is hysterical. i didn’t know if i should give this my 11 or my 0 but it makes me happier than any song in this rate by far so i think the answer is clear.

**runaway3212** (11): So I know people will question this choice, but this song is so great to me. It's like an articulation of love from somebody who has never been in love or has ever worked on articulating their emotions. To this absolute legend of a man, somebody saying 'lol that name is stupid' feels like a revelation and he just shares that with all of us, which is such a pure joy to be a part of

**duochromepalmtree** (10): every once and a while a true feminist anthem comes out. A true love song. I love every moment of this one. As he says at the end of the track “don’t be scared to party (fully vaxxed)”

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): iconic love story

**akanewasright** (8): This song sounds like a mental breakdown in the making. His voice sounds so unstable like holy shit he’s gonna cry at any minute lmao.

**ReallyCreative** (8): this is art omg

**Hulnia** (7): Is this a completely mediocre song song made solely for TikTok? Yes. 

 Does it slap? Also yes.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): Ok so like. I put this rate on shuffle at first, and this was the first song I heard. And I watched the video. I'll sound like a concerned auntie but the whole song and video are so sad to me!! I'm like entranced by it. Some messed up emo- trap.

**Iris3271** (6.5): The singing.. isn't good but I do kinda like it

**bigbigbee** (6): I told her, "Call me Rocky" / She say she not gon' call me that” is such a funny line I raised this song’s score a full point

**camerinian** (6): am I wrong to think this is kinda cute in a meatheated way

**kreddit2** (6): it's mildly catchy

**Roxieloxie** (6): i know when that hotling bling, that can only be one thing

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1j8JT/

**throwaway7650** (5.5): I kind of appreciate the lyrics but the stylistic singing... :grinny:

**BoneStreetSand** (5.4): This is almost romantic but like… kinda pathetic…

**wavingwolves** (4.2): i actually like the instrumental in this but i hate the rapping

**1998tweety** (4): meh

**bbfan132** (4): meh

**bluepupz** (4): Are you the wifey type? Or are you a party girl? The song itself is a bit too repetitive/samey throughout for me.

**jasannn** (4): straight tik tok sure loves their 808 bass, don't they?

**jsonphile** (4): I kinda like that piano but besides that not much here. Although “I said call me Rocky she said she not gonna call me that” is a hilarious line

**pig-serpent** (4): I feel like this teenager stumbled onto a cool hook and the label picked him up and told him they would help him fix all the obvious kinks in his song and then just didn't and shipped out a half baked song because imagine a label actually helping their artists fix thier art. Anyway I think this guy has potential and I hope he does cool stuff in the future.

**plastichaxan** (4): i'm so sorry jules

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Rocky sounds so bored.

**rickikardashian** (4): this just sounds miserable. i hope this party girl gets invited to a good party

**TragicKingdom1** (4): pretty dreary but not bad enough to make my bottom 10 hit songs of 2020 list

**Uberpigeon** (4): LMFAO "i told her call me rocky she say im not gon call you that" that is funny

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): for a song called party girl this is pretty boring

**celladonn** (3): Bad but I feel kind of bad for this dude, he is absolutely never going to have another hit

**cheatviathan** (3): An otherwise disposable piece of shoddy, trap sludge pushed to another level of shit by one hell of a grating vocal performance.

**cremeebrulee** (3): this guy and yung miami would make the world's most off beat collaboration

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): literally this man's voice is so off-putting?

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (3): please grow a personality or buy one, both are possible

**stryxen** (3): this isn’t even a good flavour of misogyny

**thedoctordances1940** (3): these vocals...

**Square\_Preparation55** (2.6): the lyrics just feel dumb, they remind me of SoundCloud rappers that went to my high school and tried really hard to rhyme deep words

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (2.5): this is so sleepy for a song titled 'Party Girl'

**2RINITY** (2): Bro it's not 2015, why are you still slathering your voice in Auto-Tune like that

**qazz23** (2): The piano is the only good thing here

**seanderlust** (2): i can't think of a good way to describe the soundscape other than "gross" so i guess that's what my comment is

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Honey if she’s a party girl you think she’s gonna be interested in this snoozefest of a song?

**ProfeNeuro** (1.5): go listen to Cyndi Lauper’s “Girls Want To Have Fun”

**TiltControls** (1.5): this is the most boring party i've been to

**2dina3dworld** (1): this sounds like God’s Plan mixed with a ringtone rap song

**aestheticen** (1): Listening to this song makes me feel like taking drugs too

**AHSWeeknd** (1): party girl by Grace Jones outsold

**avg-vag** (1): it’s like they forgot they were making music

**banmoderator** (1): i'm listening to these bars and they're so bad lmfao

**CrimsonROSET** (1): jules is braver than any marine

**flibbityflob** (1): I hate this song. What the fuck is appealing about this woman. This song sucks so much ass I hate it.

**ignitethephoenix** (1): thinking about how I did a rate of the 2020 year end and now because I did that, I have to listen to this song for a second time in my life

**IIIHenryIII** (1): My ears are hurting.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): hate this

**rslashpoopheads** (1): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**sssaaage** (1): horrendous

**steelstepladder** (1): This is like Take Care but with a room temperature IQ

**teenwitches** (1): my girl wants to party all the time party all the time party all the time

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): Can't wait to see this covered on onehitwonderland in 15 years

**Verrem** (1): they hit you with this sad beat and then they sing about THAT, at this point I'm mostly just confused.

**waluigiest** (1): not this free garageband ass beat

**Brendon-Urine** (0): wow, what an awful song. never wish to hear this again. terrible vocals over a trash beat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): this is one of the most painful songs ive ever had to listen to

#aksjdhgklahglsaddfjkljashdfkljasdhflkasjdflasdflkadjlfk;ajlskfjals; how do u like this

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this beat is absolutely killer. It’s such a shame it was taken and turned into such a generic pop song. So glad it’s in this rate. A contender for an 11 from me tbh.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Let me start by saying that I've never heard this song thoroughly up until now, and I actually like this? Also, the music video is pretty awesome, and kinda wholesome? I can’t explain why, but it made me so emotional and nostalgic. I guess this is the moment I say Derulo's version is trash.

**camerinian** (9): I'd not heard the full version of this before the rate, and now frankly I'm disgusted at how little Jason Derulo added. Jawsh straight up just wrote the entire vocal melody to a massive pop smash and made the whole world aware of a hyper-regional, community-driven sub genre of music that reflects his heritage and identity, and that's fucking rad

**1998tweety** (8): wait why is this the best version of the song

**educationalmirror** (8): much better than savage love

**nt96** (8): When the country was on lockdown, I remember doing the dance with song with a coworker at a diner while it was empty. Good Times.

**Roxieloxie** (8): girl what am I supposed to say for this

**throwaway7650** (7.5): it's catchy for an instrumental I fear

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): It sounds a bit like a Donkey Kong Country soundtrack remix, and that can’t be a bad thing. Curious that it’s the sole instrumental in the list.

**pig-serpent** (7): I wish the horn sounded a little bit less fake, but overall enjoyable song. Jason Derulo is sadly imprinted over all of it for me and I wish he wasn't.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): this sounds so much better as an instrumental

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): I dunno if I'm just used to hearing the Jason Derulo version, but I wish we were rating that one instead, I would've definitely given it a 9.

**vayyiqra** (7): is this the Wii theme of Tiktok

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): sure

**bluepupz** (6.5): Curse you, Jason Derulo. Can't even listen to the original beat without hearing your voice in my head. Poor Jawsh 685, he's getting penalized in my score for a singer that originally stole his song without credit...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): fuck you jason derulo

**bigbigbee** (6): I like the Jason Derulo version better, I’m sorryyyyyyyy

**cheatviathan** (6): A fine enough beat, I guess. The descending whistle is a cool touch, and the rinky-dink sax melody isn’t too obtrusive on its own. Jason Derulo would steal this beat, and that melody would become the most grating thing in the world with his dogwhistle falsetto, but I can’t blame that on this specifically.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I know that is the original beat that Jason Derulo basically stole before giving credit but that version is ingrained in my brain and I need lyrics! This is less obnoxious than savage love though

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyo4Qby/

**flibbityflob** (5.6): not amazing even slightly, still somehow one of the best things on this list. TikTok is a plague.

**GARjuna** (5.6): it made history and is also kinda just there????

**TiltControls** (5.5): normally i'd say an instrumental shouldn't be beating most of the songs in a rate, but here I'll make an exception
[/r/popheads/comments/pzdimt/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_1_take_a_moment_to_think/hf0cddi/]

=====

frogaranaman: #FUCK YOU JASON DERULO

**akanewasright** (5): Why did I only just now realize the first part of Jawsh 658’s name is… literally just pronounced “Josh”?

**celladonn** (5): I can't hate on a teen celebrating his culture but this doesn't do much for me

**cremeebrulee** (5): why is this boneless

**CrimsonROSET** (5): jason derulo thought cats was gonna change the world and somehow that’s not the most embarrassing thing that happened to him in 2020

**hephaestionline** (5): is what the song gets without Jason Derulo or BTS. The instrumental is kinda nice without Jason Derulo tbh

**rickikardashian** (5): much better without jason derulo, but this is still just a 3 minute ringtone

**rotating3Dtext** (5): it’s weird hearing this without jason derulo on top of it

**steelstepladder** (5): No Jason Derulo, the way God intended :)

**wavingwolves** (5): this isn't bad to me but it's also barely a song

**apatel27** (4): generic beat but nothing offensively bad

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): oh so Jason Derulo didn't just steal the siren sound, that bastard stole the whole fucking song

**BoneStreetSand** (4): This is like, one minute too long.

**Hulnia** (4): Honestly, with Jason’s vocals, this feels kinda empty, but at least it’s much better than having to listen to Jason Derulo.

**intheaftermath** (4): I really thought this was a karaoke track

**jasannn** (4): Its not that bad but I cant listen to this without thinking about the terrible Jason Derulo version and it has no reason to be this long.

**joeeswift** (4): I miss Jason's voice

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): Jason Derulo is not physically on this version of the track but he is in my head and I don't know if that makes it better or worse

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (4): Kidz Bop ranchero reggaeton

**runaway3212** (4): FUCK YOU JASON DERULO

**schwiftydude047** (4): it’s a good instrumental but it doesn’t hit the same without Donald Duck singing along.

**seanderlust** (4): this sounds like the third best ringtone option that come with your phone

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This is indeed a song

**Square\_Preparation55** (3.3): imagine the fire department blasting this as they speed down the road trying to get to your house

**2dina3dworld** (3): I feel bad as a kiwi not giving this a good score, but this is just boring. But, at least it isn’t bad, unlike Savage Love.

**jackisboredtoday** (3): somehow i like the instrumental less

**just\_thonking** (3): Youtube-outro-ass music

**qazz23** (3): Very repetitive, nothing interesting happens

**ReallyCreative** (3): BERRIES AND CREAM BERRIES AND CREAM IMMA LITTLE LAD WHO LOVES BERRIES AND CREAM

**thedoctordances1940** (3): The only good thing about this is that it isn't savage love

**2RINITY** (2): The Jason Derulo version didn't get its own entry, but it was so bad it dragged the original down with it

**bbfan132** (2): why

**jman457** (2): while there are some parts of this that I can appreciate, its just frankly really annoying even in the 30 second clip form

**jsonphile** (2): on the one hand, I think there are parts of this that don’t sound too bad, and Jason derulo took the worst most irritating parts of this song and laid his annoying voice over it. On the other hand, this song doesn’t feel like a song. Just a beat that might be enjoyable for 30 seconds. Which describes many tiktok songs

**kreddit2** (2): it's just an instrumental and it's not a good one either

**RandomHypnotica** (2): annoying, repetitive, cheap sounding and ugh.

**waluigiest** (2): something about this sets me off

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.9): This sounds like a MIDI version of some song that would play at the start of one of my friends' bat mitzvah receptions back in the day.

**AHSWeeknd** (1): no thank you for making the most unbearable Jason Derulo song.

**banmoderator** (1): this sounds like cocomelon

**hikkaru** (1): i can't believe jason derulo heard this and was like omg lemme steal it

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this is so fucking annoying, but i’m not giving this a 0 because jason derulo literally stole this song from him and I feel bad.

**nootnoot781** (1): god awful song and it’s even worse when you factor in he stole the beat

**plastichaxan** (1): at least it's not the jason derulo version but why is it so long nothing happens

**ProfeNeuro** (1): ohhh, it’s THAT song. It isn’t a good song, I hate this royalty-free-sounding reggae melody, and I don’t understand how it became so popular. Fuck this song.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): ok honestly this isn't that bad but the immense trauma I experienced the instant I heard the part from the jason derulo song

**skargardin** (1): i truly hate it here

**stryxen** (1): it’s only not a 0 because i know it can get worse

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (1): this should've been 30 seconds, not 3+ minutes

**Verrem** (1): I was waiting for something to happen, and waiting... and waiting...

**95ztaehyung** (0): i instinctively wanted to hiss when this started playing

**aestheticen** (0): This sounds like some royalty free music I would come across while trying to find an audio for my video editing assignment

**avg-vag** (0): this is the worst thing to happen in humanity in 2020

**inesmina** (0): this and the jason derulo song make me want to kill myself

**my friend Ethan** (0): FAT FUCKING ZERO FOREVER

**slimboyfriend** (0): I cannot stand this song. It's amateurish and goofy and the first time I heard it I GUFFAWED out loud because I thought it was a joke

**sssaaage** (0): this is genuinely one of the worst songs i know, it has nothing going for it at all like... i despise it sm it makes me irrationally angry at how bad and annoying it is, the synth is like the worst sound to ever exist and the fucking savage love melody is so bad dear lord

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i get the cultural significance but this is really annoying as a full song sorry

**Uberpigeon** (0): its CLOWN music its literally honking clown music why is this a thing!! how i hate it.

**whatsanillinois** (0): at least i can skank to this

#THEY KNOW HOW TO ROLL DOWN IN THE DEEP

**akanewasright** (10): This is nowhere near the worst song in the rate. Is it perfect? No. Is it good? Perhaps not. But it bangs and it’s iconic and it’s not “first out” material

**Awkward\_King** (10): misandry

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is camp and I’m afraid people on this sub will never get that

**intheaftermath** (10): i'm so sorry but the siivagunner AITO rips really made me love this one... anyways, stream Strip Club (Beta Mix) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kinF56ONW_Y 

 .... or don't, because I have no taste

**Roxieloxie** (10): WHATCHU KNOW ABOUT ROLLING IN THE DEEP

**GARjuna** (9): this fucks. However we must now ask does Obama believe in T-H-O-T's??????????

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this goes off idc idc there's only like 3 truly terrible bars

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): I believe in :thots: not G-O-D but this dumb fucking song still bops

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Is it bad that I kind of like this? I mean yeah the lyrics are trash but the beat is great and he really does have a good flow… to the point where it distracts me from what he’s saying lol

**bigbigbee** (7.5): This grew on me, then it grew off me. There are too many obvious and nonsensical lyrics; I enjoyed it before I perceived them, but I had several “hang on, did he just say….” moments the third or fourth time I heard it. That being said: this is a hit for a reason. There’s something about this dude’s singing style. It’s unique. It’s catchy.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): ngl this beat does kinda go off but the lyrics...

**jman457** (7.3): Popheads talks about this like its the worst song ever, but it honestly bops a bit. Fuck with the neo-western production

**HogwartsReject1912** (7): I used to refuse to listen to it and then it came on the radio and I was like "ffs this is good"

**inesmina** (7): the rock version is better

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7): look, it's a good joke. it's a great joke, even. but I'm going to have to ask you to stop

**pig-serpent** (7): The title of the song is way too cool for the song itself. The beat still rules but it's a contender for "best generic trap song of the year" type beat, and does not live up to the promise of having the coolest title for a pop song in the past few years. Masked Wolf himself is fine, but the lyrics are cringe.

**TiltControls** (7): i had never really heard this song, despite everyone talking about it and... it's actually kind of good in parts? not amazing but passable. i wanted to trash this what do i do now?

**veryanniev** (7): never heard the whole song before this rate and I know everyone hates it but I can’t deny that it’s kind of a bop?

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6.5): honestly besides the lyrics it's not that bad lmao

**wavingwolves** (6.1): astro naurrrr

**astrologicalangel** (6): this might be the most basic song ever but everytime I hear it it gets stuck in my head for at least a solid day

**celladonn** (6): I mean it's not good but I can bop to it

**cheatviathan** (6): The fact that I’m giving this a 6 and not a 2 is entirely to do with the meme. The beat is okay, but Masked Wolf is a personality void, and his one verse is exactly the kind of all flow, no bars “lyrical miracle spiritual individual” bullshit that made people like Tech N9ne so intolerable to me. However, hearing it used in a tsunami of mashups and high quality rips has made it warm up on me a bit, as has the genuinely good post-hardcore cover by Our Last Night. It’s to the point where the chorus has lived in my head for months now.

**flibbityflob** (6): I love the chorus - my interpretation of the concept of an astronaut in the ocean is VERY different to Wolf's, but despite an interesting and captivating flow, his verse is so shit it's almost funny.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): WhAt yOu knOw BoUt RolLing dOwn iN tHe DeEp? The beat and his flow are sick, but that's about it.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i’m not gonna try to make a funny comment here, cause i know there’s probably stiff competition for this one.

**jackisboredtoday** (6): i actually can see why this blew up, some videos use the hook really well, but eh. this song is worse the more you actually listen

**kreddit2** (6): the beat is cool but the lyrics are middling

**nt96** (6): I can see kinda people hating this. It's ok I guess, thankfully I don’t use TikTok that much so I didn’t hear this too much to the point I'm sick of it. Not something I would replay tho

**rslashpoopheads** (6): honestly this is kinda catchy? but also too repetitive

**seanderlust** (6): "I believe in G-O-D, don't believe in T-H-O-T" sounds like a church using their sign to try to appeal to Gen Z

**hikkaru** (5.5): this is only 2 minutes long and yet it could easily be like 20 seconds long for the good part

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): 11 for the chorus 0 for literally everything else

frogaranaman: #haters for good reason

**1998tweety** (5): ok this honestly wasnt as bad as i was expecting, the rap verse was decent but its still not an amazing song.

**hephaestionline** (5): is what I would give the first 20 seconds of the song

**schwiftydude047** (5): solid beats but the bait and switch mashups got me annoyed.

**stryxen** (5): it’s really not like that bad

**Uberpigeon** (5): i feel like the meme of spongebob with his eyes looking in opposite directions. is this song supposed to be good or bad??? what is the drama with it???? i dont listen to hip hop i need someone to tell me what to think.

**welcome2thejam** (5): If this song only went up to the end of the first chorus, it'd be a 9. It does not. Beat is good enough to stay on my good side though.

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): I’m trying to give this an objective score and not just a 10 for the memes, but these lyrics are so stupid that it deserves a whole two points for how much they make me laugh

**avg-vag** (4): an inflated score solely for the production

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): beat is decent, chorus is decent, lyrics are absolute garbage

**bluepupz** (4): I believe in F-O-U-R, I don't believe in T-E-N. Sorry, I had to lol. These are some truly nonsensical lyrics, but at least the beginning/chorus is catchy.

**cremeebrulee** (4): i hate that this grows on me a little more each time i listen to it so i'm just gonna stop while i'm at this score

**jsonphile** (4): literally the only reason it’s not a 2 is just because that intro is hella sweet. And the hook is pretty catchy too. But the verse…some of those lyrics man. Especially that “g-o-d” line

**matthewc20090** (4): nasty hook but not much else. but have you ever wondered whatchu know about rollin down in the deep when your brain goes numb you can call that mental freeze?

**plastichaxan** (4): come on give us nothing

**ProfeNeuro** (4): looks like my “ohh it’s THAT song” phrase has been successfully trademarked by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to indicate songs I had previously known but never knew the name of said songs, be prepared to hear me say that quite a bit throughout the rate; eh, go listen to “Rolling In The Deep” by Adele instead.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): honestly, this just isn't the worst song in the rate, which is saying a lot

**rotating3Dtext** (4): my SHOCK when I learned this is a white rapper dude from Australia may only be matched by the cringe when he says I believe in g.o.d. not t.h.o.t.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): "I believe in G-O-D, don't believe in T-H-O-T" is kinda of a "wait, what?" lyric that makes you realize that this is just a deeply weird song

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): I finally understand what people mean when they call a rapper's bars corny

**arhmaer** (3): i do not have a tiktok and have literally never heard any of these songs. exciting! i hate this!

**banmoderator** (3): memes were decent but that's it

**CrimsonROSET** (3): who the fuck said you’re cool

**jasannn** (3): Sounds like an obnoxious frat bro.

**just\_thonking** (3): this song has ten good seconds

**letsallpoo** (3): what a way to start this rate

**MrMoodle** (3): there’s at least like 30 seconds of a decent song buried in this but oh my god the verses

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): The only good thing this song has is its' main hook, everything else is just a side-dish.

**ReallyCreative** (3): shockingly enough, there are a few songs in this rate that make this one feel almost tolerable

**runaway3212** (3): I'm not sure I believe in G-O-D after this anymore

**steelstepladder** (3): Whatchu know about clappin on some butt cheeks?

**thedoctordances1940** (3): Credit to the part that ended up becoming the meme, it actually is legitimately good. As for the rest, some really bad flows and lyrics, epitomised by the "I believe in G-O-D, don't believe in T-H-O-T" line really ruin any credibility this song had.

**whatsanillinois** (3): believe in g-o-d not t-h-o-t

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.5): Like it's FINE. Very annoying, but very catchy. The lyrics are so vacuous. This is the straightest male song of all time, no thanks.

**bbfan132** (2): :naur:

**TheQueenOfVultures** (2): This is big "I wish rap music had a real meaning" energy

**Verrem** (2): "I believe in G-O-D (ayy) Don't believe in T-H-O-T" please make it stop

**camerinian** (1.5): This the sort of shit that gets shared on Facebook by your army cousin captioned with "REAL RAPPER SPITS BARS, RIP MUMBLE CRAP 🤯🤯🔥🔥"

**Square\_Preparation55** (1.5): Jeff Bezos was def playing this song when he came back from space

**2RINITY** (1): Astronauts are SUPPOSED to go in the fucking ocean. That's where they land when they come back, dumbass. Stop fucking up perfectly good metaphors to make gibberish. And Ralph Lauren logos don't go on baseball caps, why are you putting that there

**aestheticen** (1): I don't know anything about rolling down in the deep

**brenda\_official** (1): what you know bout rolling down in the deep

**Brendon-Urine** (1): "i dont believe in t-h-o-t" single handedly makes this a 1

**my friend Ethan** (1): WHUTCHUKNOWBOU-

**nootnoot781** (1): windows down, scream along, to some Astronaut in the Ocean, a slaughter house, an outlet mall, slot machines, fear of god

**rickikardashian** (1): i already gave dixie my ironic 10 sorry

**sssaaage** (1): actually so horrendous its not even funny ironically

**teenwitches** (1): my brain goes a little more numb every time i have to hear this against my will

**throwaway7650** (1): horrid, he sounds so annoyingly confident. his voice is not the most unbearable one in the rate but still quite awful

**tinaoe** (1): i would have given this a 0 but I did get a few amusing edits on my fyp so it gets to live

**AHSWeeknd** (0): This just isn’t good, why was this a hit

**duochromepalmtree** (0): I cannot believe PlayTally now has a record of me listening to this song all the way through. So God awful. Somehow the verses are worse than the tik tok trend chorus.

**educationalmirror** (0): "I believe in G-O-D, don't believe in T-H-O-T" is enough for this to deserve a 0

**Hulnia** (0): Great, another member of the Nathan rap club, alongside the masterminds of Hopsin and Tom MacDonald. 

 Fuck this song, it’s definitely the worst hit of the last 5 years...

**Iris3271** (0): I would rather get a dozen root canals than have to suffer through this again

**joeeswift** (0): *lady gaga voice* untalented, not brilliant, un-incredible, show-starting, always the same, totally common, completely been done before

**skargardin** (0): the intro activates my fight or flight

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (0): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJ3PC6p/

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (0): this sounds like Imagine Dragons tried to go hip-hop and used a group of middle school boys as their ghost writers

**waluigiest** (0): I’m impressed with how this song is both pretentious and completely stupid

GANG GANG GANG GANG 

Wow, you guys hate fun, huh? This song is an absolute BLAST with some iconic lines and great flows and literally FLOATS on by. The Tiktok dance attached to it is iconic, the memes that came from it are hilarious. and it's featured on some of my favorite videos on the app ever. I hate to say it, but I really do think this song got an incredibly unfair treatment by the subreddit which is a shame because this is a classic Tiktok hit for fall '19 users of the app. I'm glad some of the users understood the power that "I don't know how to use a computer but trust me, bitch, I bring the Mac out" holds, at least.

#POPPED A PERC AND THEY BLACKED OUT

**95ztaehyung** (9.5): i know i dont have taste OKAY but i cant stop the bangers from banging

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): this kinda goes hard? Also fuck yeah beyblades

**GARjuna** (8): too short but fun!

**schwiftydude047** (8): there’s honestly some pretty great lyrics here.

**skargardin** (8): the 'LET IT RIP LIKE A FUCKING BEYBLADE' bar took me out

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJKvEEK/

**vayyiqra** (8): This would be kind of bad but I love anything that says "gang" repetitively so

**2RINITY** (7): OK, he's got some punchlines

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): the Beyblade line sends me

**sssaaage** (7): whys it kinda good

**Roxieloxie** (6.8): bestie the beat is not gonna run away from you, you can take a breath

**BoneStreetSand** (6.5): Can't tell if I mildly like this ironically or completely seriously.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (6.5): Wow this one really is just a snippet huh.

**kreddit2** (6.5): this would have been a 7 but uh "that's not a hickey those are bruises" line made me cringe so.... -0.5

**1998tweety** (6): this is ok

**aestheticen** (6): Too short

**duochromepalmtree** (6): not my type of song but if I was high as fuck in the car with my friends i feel like I’d really vibe to this. Gang gang gang gang.

**educationalmirror** (6): gang gang gang gang

**ImADudeDuh** (6): how is this already over

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (6): Lil Kapow is a bottom

**rickikardashian** (6): *”apparently if you count to 13 it looks like you know the lyrics”*

**seanderlust** (6): I don't know how to use a computer

**throwaway7650** (6): I thought this was a bonus rate song at first

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Beyblades… We’re truly living in an era of nerdy rappers and I’m here for it

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): this sounds not bad and then i hear the lyrics… also, the deep voice, the reference to e-girls, is this not just a CORPSE song by someone else???

**jman457** (5.5): Honestly i can see the talent here, its just so short!

**plastichaxan** (5.5): there's potential but it's not even 90seconds long

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I can't tell if this song is funny or not because I don't know how in on the joke he is but I love the Beyblade reference

#y'all hate fun

**cheatviathan** (5): With a limp, skeletal beat and coma-inducing vocal delivery, this is disposable. The line “Let it rip like a fucking Beyblade” was one that caught me off guard, though.

**pig-serpent** (5): Lil Kapow's flow is really good, and makes the song enjoyable to listen to, which is surprising because this beat is atrocious.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): there's so many bad lyrics in this song, but this gets points for the beyblade line

**welcome2thejam** (5): This man's got puns

**stryxen** (4.5): not the worst

**AHSWeeknd** (4): the beat’s good but oof

**arhmaer** (4): i think i might be old. this bangs btw

**bbfan132** (4): i feel like this ended before it started

**ignitethephoenix** (4): this barely registered in my brain

**pleasegivemeasword** (4): for four gang gang gang gangs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): why are you as a man singing “i got two dicks on me”. sounds a little gay bro idk

**jasannn** (3.5): I sure hope these lyrics aren't supposed to be taken seriously

**Square\_Preparation55** (3.5): I hear this song and imagine all of the white boys blasting it through their AirPods, thinking about how tough they are as they walk through the streets of their gated suburban community

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): I barely remember what this song sounds like but I know it wasn't good

**flibbityflob** (3): I'm glad it's short but even at 1:23 it's too long.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): genuinely so dull

**ProfeNeuro** (3): cool, next song

**steelstepladder** (3): Did y'all know

**Uberpigeon** (3): britney sounds different...

**waluigiest** (3): hmm maybe this is postmodern

**whatsanillinois** (3): now this is a song only made for tiktok. shite

**apatel27** (2): this is satire right?

**banmoderator** (2): at least it was short

**intheaftermath** (2): it's been a while since a song has made me feel absolutely no emotion whatsoever. I don't even know

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2): Ehhhh...

**ReallyCreative** (2): uhhh this is just not pleasant at all, painting your nails doesn't make you that interesting sir

**TiltControls** (2): I think the energy drop going from Big and Chunky to this brought the score down a bit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.4): Edgelord rap, nah I'm good. Let me just be a hipster and listen to Denzel Curry, Danny Brown or Jpegmafia lol

**best-american-record** (1): hearing that once was too many times

**hephaestionline** (1): is this straight TikTok??

**joeeswift** (1): never heard this song on the app, no ear wormy hook for me to latch on to so I didn't enjoy

**nt96** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yoPWzMwqI8

**rslashpoopheads** (1): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**shhhneak** (1): These sure are words in a one minute twenty three seconds sequence.

**teenwitches** (1): the beat barely even exists and he still can't stay on it

**tinaoe** (1): ehhhhhhhhhhhhh

**Verrem** (1): focussing on lyrics in a TikTok rate is definitely not the play, this one sticks out as especially bad though

**wavingwolves** (1): you telling me you don't know how to use a computer???

**bluepupz** (0): Let it be known that the Genius annotation for "I don't claim gang, but I got two dicks on me every goddamn day" is simply "hella sus" lmao.

**cremeebrulee** (0): this score is 100% because i scrolled down to this guy's artist description on spotify to check if he was white and i got greeted with one of the worst pictures i've ever seen in my life so fuck that

**IIIHenryIII** (0): My ears are literally hurting this time. I'm not kidding. My headphones hurt them, and this atrocity just made the pain worse.

**veryanniev** (0): I feel like the main reason of me giving this a 0 is that it was the first annoying rap song on this list, and to be honest it’s really hard to differentiate between them so this one gets my zero I guess. also obligatory «britney spears outsold» comment

I was always so mad when I tried to do this trend and the sunglasses didn't work when I tried to get them to fall on my face it was genuinely the most frustrating night I have ever had when making Tiktok videos 

Wow, what a fucking BANGER y'all! I really do absolutely love this song, it's really just pure fun and it's always fun to say "Shaggy has a Tiktok hit" now because of it. Wish it got treated with a bit more respect, but much like the "Wellerman - Remix" song, I did not expect much from y'all so I'm glad it placed where it did!

---

**cremeebrulee** (10): help why does this kinda go off

**Roxieloxie** (10): this rate waking up my dormant jamican half thats been asleep since the last time i had some good Coco bread

**MrMoodle** (8.5): i miss music like this in the mainstream, don’t use tiktok and had never heard it before this rate but i feel transported back to the days of the baha men or something

**TiltControls** (8.5): dk rap deserves a trend

**1998tweety** (8): she bops tbh

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): This is funnn idc!

**xavieryes** (8): show me the banana (na-na-na-na-na)

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): so glad Gwen Stefani taught me how to read this song title omg

**seanderlust** (7.5): love this referral system the girls in the song have

**wavingwolves** (7.4): this actually bops... it sounds like music i heard a lot growing up

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I mean it’s not bad

**GARjuna** (7): fun!!

**skargardin** (7): I actually really like this except for the .. questionable drop

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): the instrumental sounds like a car radio when you go in a tunnel

**rickikardashian** (6.5): very fun for what it is but it has no business being longer than a minute and a half

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): impressive that Shaggy made it through yet another music industry paradigm shift but the song itself is mediocre

**bigbigbee** (6): I would enjoy this more if I didn’t know the original song, I think. I can’t hear this and not think about how I’d rather be listening to that. It’s fine though.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Why isn't Sean Paul credited on his song?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJwN5Gs/

**throwaway7650** (6): it's catchy I guess

**jman457** (5.9): breezy island vibe, but the drop is a bit annoying

**avg-vag** (5.5): this provides seratonin even if it’s stupid

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): love a penis analogy

**shhhneak** (5.5): Bubble popping sounds should be banned from all remixes.

**2RINITY** (5): At least there weren't any Minions in this

**bbfan132** (5): a song

**bluepupz** (5): I think this would be fun to vibe and dance to at a bar. However, the song itself isn't my favorite. The last 30 seconds of music feels repetitive and doesn't add much, and the last 15 sec of silence is too long imo.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): there really aren’t enough songs comparing your genitalia to fruit

**ImADudeDuh** (5): THIS SOUND IS FROM A SONG CALLED BANANA???????????

**intheaftermath** (5): oh my god i love beetlejuice!!!

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (5): this is only for when I'm drunk. otherwise the only banana I want…

**my friend Ethan** (5): (minion joke here)

**schwiftydude047** (5): decent remix of a classic song.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): C’mon man you gotta be more subtle about dick songs!

**veryanniev** (4.5): started out okay but then progressively got more annoying

**hookerofpop** (4): initially it was 5 but 15 seconds of silence at the end of the song? how am i supposed to be alone with total silence and only my thoughts????

**kreddit2** (4): sounds like an island Disney movie outtake... and despite being only 3 minutes+ IT FEELS SO LONG

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): The full version of this doesn't really do anything else for me, the drop is pretty cool though.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): these 4 points are for the original not this shit

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): probably one of the few songs on here that would benefit from being shorter

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3.5): what the fuck is this

**best-american-record** (3): very repetitive but nice beat

**cheatviathan** (3): Lyrical content that uses some of the most obvious and hokiest banana themed sex metaphors possible atop some weak tropical house production, with a flaccid, overlong excuse for a drop? I’ll stick with “Put a Banana in Your Ear” from Charlie the Unicorn 2. Thanks.

**educationalmirror** (3): beetlejuice pity points

**flibbityflob** (3): Why. Not even worthy of a 1 or a 2 because it's vaguely coherent as a song and I do kinda like Shaggy's stuff, it's just so meh. Goes on for way too long.

**jsonphile** (3): how many different ways will people find to ruin the banana boat song

**plastichaxan** (3): look i may or may not be awful to the songs that i associate with trends straight people from my country made popular this is kinda annoying

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3): Banana Heartbreak >>>

**slimboyfriend** (3): oh how shaggy has fallen

**vayyiqra** (3): Yeah no. I respect Shaggy's status as living meme but this is awful.

**pig-serpent** (2.5): I surprisingly wasn't hating this until the awful drop came in and just refused to leave.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): hahahaha get it guys hes relating his penis to a banana! get it because bananas are also long and phallic shapped hahahaha!!! no one has ever made this euphemism before

**aestheticen** (2): Horrid but at least it's a little bit enjoyable you know

**arhmaer** (2): i thought i'd like this. i did not.

**camerinian** (2): Even though there’s literally a track from the Madagascar soundtrack in this rate, this song evokes “the hippo is shaking its ass at me during the credits of this movie my nephew dragged me along to” more than any other track

**celladonn** (2): Terrible drop, Harry Belafonte outsold

**thedoctordances1940** (2): god this goes on for far too long and has some awful awful terribly awful synths

**tinaoe** (2): reminds me of the sort of songs that were popular in Europe like early 2000s which just gives me awkward family party flashbacks

**2dina3dworld** (1): people have been making banana jokes in music since the 40s. They’ve gotten old. Stop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I'm so embarrassed right now.

**hephaestionline** (1): I kinda hate this lmao

**hikkaru** (1): why does this feel so long wtf

**joeeswift** (1): the happiness I felt when this song finished is the happiest I’ve felt for the past 2 years

**ProfeNeuro** (1): I imagine this is the kind of music they play at booze cruzes and nothing more. Fuck this song.

**runaway3212** (1): I hate this trend but I hate this song more

**sssaaage** (1): girl wtf

**stryxen** (1): uhhh

**teenwitches** (1): harry belafonte deserved better

**Uberpigeon** (1): :deadbanana:

**Verrem** (1): NO

was anyone going to tell me Freddie Dredd is white or was I supposed to figure that out when I looked up his image for the banner 

The beat on this song is fucking *WILD*, holy shit. I wish it was just an instrumental track because I would have dug it WAY, WAY more than whatever mediocre rap offering Freddie gives on this track. The flip on the sample is really cool, though, and seeing the debate on Tiktok over what was being said because English speakers cannot fathom other people speaking in another language is funny as hell.

---

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): This goes strangely hard! I love the whole Memphis rap vibes going on here.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I would like this a lot more without the heavy distortion and vocal filter honestly, i think it only takes away from this song

**2RINITY** (8): Nice groove, momentum builds well, can't tell if the fact that it sounds compressed to fit on a Super Nintendo cartridge hurts or helps it

**xavieryes** (8): o rap desse gringo aí é bem merda e quase estraga a música, mas foda-se, merece um 8 só pelo sample da Célia

**akanewasright** (7.8): Not totally sure what I’m listening to but I think it slaps?

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): is that the drag racing lady

**wavingwolves** (7.2): i actually really like the use of the sample in this

**2dina3dworld** (7): The POV’s that were like: “POV: you’re questioning me about why I fucked your husband” were some of the best Tik tok had to offer

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7): -2 for the men

**runaway3212** (7): why not

**schwiftydude047** (7): the use of the voice filter is pretty creative.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyotGBq/

**jman457** (6.9): the sample truly carries this, but my god does it ever

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s fine

**1998tweety** (6): this is interesting but kind of creepy too

**camerinian** (6): a beat this involved and exciting deserves a better performer than this schlub

**CrimsonROSET** (6): acho que pode ir sim davi

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (6): WHY is it so compressed, I'm getting decades old TV commercial sampled for a vaporwave track. It's interesting, though.

**intheaftermath** (6): I kinda miss the early TikTok POV era... it's all so "wHaT iF yOu gOt a MaRk ThAt toLd yOU yOuR sTaTus" now

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): this is hyperpop

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): this has the same vocal production as that putt putt song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): ehhhhhhhhh I like the sonics but the rap is SO mid. I can hear the Mountain Dew.

**steelstepladder** (5): Rating memes as actual songs is hard

**bluepupz** (4.5): This feels pretty disjointed. This is another one of those songs that just kind of confused me tbh.

**flibbityflob** (4.2): eh....not for me, also not very good.

**Square\_Preparation55** (4.2): it gives me flashbacks to when every single TikTok dancer was reusing the same tired dance moves to try and come up with some interpretive dance for this song that just could not be danced to

**seanderlust** (4.1): hello i would like to order one "someone else on this beat" please

**cheatviathan** (4): Freddie Dredd sounds like discount Matt Champion, and this beat is lo-fi to a fault.

**GARjuna** (4): gave me a headache

**kreddit2** (4): eh

**pig-serpent** (4): Beat itself is cool but I don't like the lofi effects going on over it, it's a little painful to listen to.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I love this sample! And uhh that’s all I’d like to say about this song

**AHSWeeknd** (3): any relation to Rupaul?

**avg-vag** (3): another cool production with terrible lyrics

**Hulnia** (3): Why did the somewhat decent part of this song, and not the annoying ass sample? Maybe it’s just overexposure, but god it’s so annoying.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): full offense NCTzens but this is what NCT USA will sound like

**vayyiqra** (3): I would like this a lot more if it weren't so unsettling

**Brendon-Urine** (2): the sample is very strange and the production is noooooot great

**cremeebrulee** (2): THERE'S A MAN ON THIS????

**sssaaage** (2): its.. a song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i just dont get the appeal of this type of rap

**arhmaer** (1): i really do think that a lot of the really popular trends in this kind of ??semi-pop?? music right now are just really annoying to me. the extreme repetition of a single kinda catchy element/melody, this kind of distorted vocals. the longer this went on the more it just annoyed me. them's the breaks i guess

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): this production is awful

**best-american-record** (1): pretty much only works as a tiktok sound imo

**duochromepalmtree** (1): I absolutely hate this!

**IIIHenryIII** (1): As a Portuguese speaker (yeah, that's my first language), I was very surprised when I listened to this one. That's the only reason why I'm not giving it my 0. Now my attempt to translate it: Oh, David, don't go, no / Now that this song is getting good.

**jsonphile** (1): what is this

**plastichaxan** (1): this is so annoying like i could stand it on videos but there's no way i'll listen to this on my own

**ProfeNeuro** (1): Hey Freddie, can you do us a favor and not sample bossa nova for this shit? thanks.

**teenwitches** (1): horrendous production and muddy vocals

**thedoctordances1940** (1): i'm sorry but what is going on here

**Verrem** (1): petition to keep whoever mixed this far away from the music industry

**rickikardashian** (0): the only talent the person that made this has was finding a great sample, because from then on they did everything wrong

**throwaway7650** (0): this might not actually be the worst song in the rate but I just find this so obnoxious on so many levels? the instrumental sounds like a bad imitation of when you get the star in mario kart, the sample doesn't work here, his voice is annoying af (I'm not convinced by a word he's saying)... all in all probably the song I'm most negative about in the rate so it gets my 0

It's fine. I mean, it's a catchy song that I won't turn off when I'm drinking with friends nor will I absolutely detest it being played while socializing, but it's not something I will seek out and loop. The Kid LAROI has much better songs than this one, and honestly much funnier Tiktok trends than this. So why did I choose it then, you may ask?

Eh, just wanted to see how many 0s this would attract.

---

#heartbroken

**tinaoe** (10): sometimes you want that fuckboi vibe u know. and i'm not even into men.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): one of the biggest growers of the year for me...it's just too catchy to resist

**1998tweety** (9): ok this bops

**educationalmirror** (9): actually really personal and beautiful

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): i’m sorry i know this is bad but “so there you go, oh” is SUCH a good hook

**brenda\_official** (8): so bad its good yeah i said it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this song is awful

**matthewc20090** (8): better than the usher song

**seanderlust** (8): GOD i want to hate this song given some real misogynist overtones but i'm afraid this might turn into a guilty pleasure. post-breakup feelings absolutely fight dirty and that's why the can't make a housewife out of a ho line, as gross as it is, kind of actually adds to it. plus there are moments here that i really love - "i'm scared to be alone", the high notes on the chorus for example

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I'm embarrassed to admit this, but I enjoyed it more than I should have. Well, I guess that's what we call "there's no such thing as guilty pleasure".

**runaway3212** (7.5): I hate to say it but this slaps, however can't make a wife out of a hoe is such a terrible line

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): the fact he is talking about not making a wife out of a ho when he 17 💀 outside of that line, it’s a decent song

**bigbigbee** (7): The challenge associated with this on Tik Tok is extremely mean spirited and I really don’t like it. That being said, I heard this song on the radio first and in a vacuum, it’s not bad.

**BoneStreetSand** (7): We had to deal with this playing every hour on Australian radio for months so I get uncomfortable when I hear it. The bad lyrics don’t help. At least this wasn’t the Miley version and his voice is nice…

**hephaestionline** (7): yes Indigenous Australian king, get that Justin Bieber money

**jsonphile** (7): I know this is gonna go out quickly, and yeah I know that line everyone hates (and I agree it’s a bad lyric) but I don’t know. Something about the kid’s strained, raspy vocals really works on this song. I don’t think this is his best song, Stay is much better, and his hook on No Return with Polo G and Lil Durk is probably the best use of his talent so far, and I think he’s got potential

**schwiftydude047** (7): breakups suck let’s face it.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): i generally like this song, but can't get fully behind some of these lyrics

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): once again, one VERY bad line ruins the appeal of a song

**intheaftermath** (6.5): I work at a summer camp, and every year the kids pick one song to be ridiculously obsessed with (like Old Town Road or The Muffin Song). This year, the nine year olds decided they couldn't make a wife out of a hoe

**just\_thonking** (6.5): First time hearing this song and I did not expect it to have that millennial "oh woah" part

**akanewasright** (6): I literally hadn’t heard this song before the rate and I’m still surprised the “can’t make a wife out of a hoe” song people kept quoting is a ballad

**bluepupz** (6): I just realized this is the same guy as the one on Stay LOL oops. I am going to ignore the "can't make a wife out of a hoe" line. Other than that, it's a pretty okay song.

**cremeebrulee** (6): now why is a 17 year old thinking about wifing anyone

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): the 'can't make a wife out of a hoe' line ruins it sooo much

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1GdTX/

**slimboyfriend** (5.9): "can't make a wife out of a ho" is so 2006

**TiltControls** (5.5): ignoring some of the lyricism, this isn't too bad of a song otherwise

**flibbityflob** (5.2): you can make a wife out of a ho, dumbass. sluts deserve rights too.

frogaranaman: #hates teenagers, doesn't think they have emotions

**aestheticen** (5): Without this song

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): this kid wants to be Post Malone so bad it's embarrassing. The weird attempts to re-create his goaty vibrato?? Awful. And obviously the ho line does not help at all.

**MrMoodle** (5): i don’t HATE this per se but it’s one of those tracks that i’m embarassed to have listened to even in private despite it not being for recreation

**pig-serpent** (5): This guy is really overhated but this song is mid. It has a hook, but his singing isn't great and the acoustic guitar chords are derivative and uninteresting.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): Wish we were rating the Miley Cyrus version, I would've easily given that an 8.

**steelstepladder** (5): Very tempted to give this a pass as I was way too hard on the similar teen brattyness of Juice Wrld when he was alive but this isn't exactly great

**throwaway7650** (4.5): his voice isn't that whiny actually but that one line... yeah

**Square\_Preparation55** (4.4): The Kid LAROI's real name is Charlton Kenneth Jeffrey Howard

**jman457** (3.7): He seems like a mass shooter type

**arhmaer** (3): i am the ho

**bbfan132** (3): these lyrics ruin the song

**cheatviathan** (3): The acoustic guitar immediately sets me on edge, LAROI’s vocals are passable, but not exceptional. Really, it’s the lyrical content that pushes this into awful. It’s tough to take his feelings of remorse seriously when he uses lines like “Can’t make a wife out of a ho.” I feel like teens will look back on this one with the same contempt we look back on acts like Staind with.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (3): I hate most of the vocals wtf.

**hikkaru** (3): i think ho-oh would make a great wife actually

**nt96** (3): this tryhard edginess is sending me lol boy keep crying

**rickikardashian** (3): this song is violently heterosexual, male and teenaged

**rslashpoopheads** (3): his voice is so fucking irritating

**static\_int\_husp** (3): disregard my previous comment about letting men make music

**kreddit2** (2.7): it's whiny and his voice is annoying

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): yeah I just have no patience for this kind of sad boy music, can't make an avacado out of avacadies

**ProfeNeuro** (2.3): lek dis if u vri evrityme

**2RINITY** (2): "Weedah-hyoOOOUUUU" shut the fuck up discount Juice Wrld go get a drummer or something

**banmoderator** (2): this Straight Fave makes me very annoyed

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (2): church group music misogyny moment

**Saison\_Marguerite** (2): CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES, THIS IS MY LAST RESORT

**whatsanillinois** (2): softboi-core

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): it lost 9 points for the cant make a wife out of a hoe line but then gained another .5 because the entire rest of the song rly isnt that bad

**Iris3271** (1.5): This had to be written by a tenth grader at the oldest good lord

**2dina3dworld** (1): you can make a wife out of a hoe, which is how my mother got married twice

**AHSWeeknd** (1): this just ain’t it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): "can't make a wife out of a hoe" dude you're 17, of course you can't

**camerinian** (1): Really tragic that Juice Wrld’s protege so quickly pivoted to pathetic cliched acoustic guitar moping with none of the rawness or complicated framing that made Juice’s music so cutting at times.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): Strong 0 contender. This is like the acoustic TikTok version of post-grunge. GROSS.

**duochromepalmtree** (1): I am bias against this song. I hate everything about it and it made me like Miley Cyrus less when she jumped on the remix! And I taught myself html coding at age 12 so I could run a Miley fan page! That’s how much I hate this song!

**Hulnia** (1): I fucking hate The Kid LAROI, especially his fucking whiny ass voice. I’ll never get what Juice saw in this man. 

 Oh well, at least it’s not Stay...

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i hate like, every kid laroi song. Stay is like a 6/10

**nootnoot781** (1): no

**qazz23** (1): Bad vocals, boring song

**Roxieloxie** (1): wait this is a BALLAD???? HUH?????

**sssaaage** (1): this is genuinely one of the worst songs i know and was one of the songs that was almost my 0, the lyrics are actually so bad and the kid laroi has the worst voice ever i stg. possibly the worst artist to blow up recently which is already a very low bar so you know its bad.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): “cant make a wife out of a hoe” kid you’re 17 years old dont you have algebra homework you should be doing

**teenwitches** (1): you're telling me this isn't post malone?

**thedoctordances1940** (1): the moment he starts singing you want him to shut up

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): The fact that he gets to become a massive star off of this song is truly unjust

**Uberpigeon** (1): christ...

**vayyiqra** (1): Yeah no I hate this guy's voice; I came of age during the 2000s and was there during the time when bad whiny emo singers were a plague, and this is too much like that style

**Verrem** (1): not a fan of Bieber so not a fan of this

**waluigiest** (1): god this sucks so bad

**wavingwolves** (1): ?

**xavieryes** (1): The Kid LAROI's voice is shrill and obnoxious, the lyrics suck, and the song is fucking sluggish and boring. zero-worthy. for The Kid LAROI to be good it has to be a song like Stay where his voice is mostly irrelevant (plus that song is fun, while this one is not).

**plastichaxan** (0): that one lyric...we all know the one...this is awful in every way possible i thought it would be hard to settle on a 0 considering the amount of 1s i gave and this came along last minute to prove me wrong

#it is literally never that serious

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): puts on Todd hoodie I could go on about the “can’t make a wife out of a ho” line (and I should because it’s just one of the most disgusting lines I’ve ever heard in a hit song in my whole life… sung by a 17-year-old, no less) but I’d actually like to bring your attention to something far more sinister lurking beneath the poorly-worded and excruciatingly-sung surface: this song is a model case of emotional abuse in a romantic relationship! Yes, saying “fuck all your reasons” for leaving then immediately dropping the clichéd “I didn’t mean it” excuse is the most blindingly obvious proof of this, but the line that truly stuck out to me the most was, funny enough, the one right after the infamous “ho” bar… “I’m scared to be alone.” Oh, you’re scared, buddy? Not your ex who had to experience what even you could admit was “losing your shit?” Are you the victim now? You want us to cry for you? Cause you certainly put on a good show of crying when you wail out that line right before the final chorus: “BUT I’M SCAAAARED TO BE ALOOONE!!” I’m guessing his thought process at that moment was something along the lines of “Maybe if I can make this stupid bitch feel sorry for me she’ll come waltzing back aaay” SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU SCUMBAG! Many songs annoy me, a handful of songs disgust me, but only a select few can scare me. The scariest thing about this song is that it’s so popular that it’s teaching a new generation of young men that this is how you solve a conflict in a relationship: pin the blame on her, fake remorse, pray she takes pity on you, then rinse and repeat. Disgusting. The worst you could say about ”I’d Rather Die” is that it’s an extremely misguided attempt to knock awful abusive men down a peg… Meanwhile this song is… a show of power by an awful abusive man who deserves to be knocked down a peg.

I literally remember nothing about the Tiktok trends that were associated with this song I genuinely just think it was one of those songs that was used with every single video for a while since it was just generic and catchy enough to be nice background music which in it of itself is a roast of the song that was conceived in only a matter of hours but that's besides the point you get what I mean

As generic, trie, and mediocre as this song is, my friend group and I still really fuck with it. It's one of those songs we always queue up when we are *just* drunk enough to ask the infamous "beer pong?" question that leads to us playing beer pong ad it's just such a nice soundtrack to it all. I get the gripes with this song, but honestly it's a bop and I still will not stand for its well-deserved slander anyways!!!

#depression? I guess I dunno

**2dina3dworld** (10): do not question my 10, I have my reasons

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): pleasantly surprised by this one

**aestheticen** (8): This is a song many people hate but I honestly dig it....

**bluepupz** (8): I can see why this got popular enough to be added to Today's Top Hits on Spotify (which is where I heard this for the first time). This is really, really catchy.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): The underlying guitar throughout makes this surprisingly melancholic and I appreciate the feeling that it gives the song.

**schwiftydude047** (8): now that I’m paying more attention to the lyrics, this definitely describes that feeling when you’re crushing on someone but can’t think of what to say.

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i hate to admit it but the summer walker remix >>>

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is alright but I rather have Post Malone do this since it’s basically a Posty song

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I mean... it's kinda catchy… fuck that, I like what my ears like.

**jasannn** (7.5): simp energy but that chorus transports me back to when I finally caved into downloading tik tok in late 2019

**duochromepalmtree** (7): this song is extremely catchy. I’m no longer an angsty teen so this isn’t going on a playlist or anything but it was absolutely stuck in my head for a while after listening.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): it's giving me knockoff post malone vibes but there is another song on this rate that is a much worse ripoff so I'll let this guy off. It's alright!

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7): move on. stop being a wallet

**pig-serpent** (7): Intellectually I agree with the people who hate this one but my gut likes it.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): it's not great, but it's gonna get a WAY harsher score than neccesary

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): holy shit this has over a billion plays and I've never heard it...

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): my hottest take is maybe that this isn’t garbage, I understand how his voice could be off putting though

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): this is extremely meh, but in this rate that’s enough i guess

**1998tweety** (6): nah

**apatel27** (6): forgettable

**bbfan132** (6): it’s fine

**educationalmirror** (6): was gonna give this a higher score but then I checked its use on tiktok and its mostly for bad pranks of fake blind people pretending to almost fall into fountains so, no.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): You know, I was gonna say "Has anybody mashed this up with Nightmare or Better Off Alone yet?" but as it turns out Trevor actually has a song that interpolates "Better Off Alone" that's currently unreleased... And it kinda bangs. Can't wait for when that drops.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoFJGA/

**seanderlust** (5.8): you ever have one of those songs where you're like "this is technically good but i am not at all interested in returning to this"? very that

frogaranaman: #I RISEEEEEEEE LIKE A PHOENIX BORN OF THE ASHES

**Hulnia** (5): Another one I should probably hate, but I streamed this way too much back when it was big and I just can’t get it out of my head.

**kreddit2** (5): just boring

**nt96** (5): meh

**Roxieloxie** (5): https://open.spotify.com/track/0TyKgXjB5tNEKAaZeaBtYT?si=mYu0lCWySXmSUaLfLKFhVQ

**rslashpoopheads** (5): it's aight

**throwaway7650** (5): not awful but he really sounds like he's struggling to sing at times

**best-american-record** (4.5): it’s okay but i got bored halfway through and went to look up if he was british and found out he isn’t ?? that was more interesting to me than the song

**flibbityflob** (4.5): this is just boring frankly

**banmoderator** (4): had no idea this song had so many streams

**cheatviathan** (4): Why is such a great beat with such cool guitar leads wasted on an emo kid who’s vocals sound simultaneously derivative and uniquely annoying, and who chooses the weirdest syllables to elongate and put stress on?

**just\_thonking** (4): 80% of this song is straight up annoying

**rickikardashian** (4): i genuinely think his label must have paid people to use this sound because why on earth was this as big as it was

**skargardin** (4): how this became such a smash hit really beats me

**slimboyfriend** (4): is this that kid Leroy?

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i mean its bad but like it isnt special

**ProfeNeuro** (3.5): fake-af-TikTok-core

**akanewasright** (3): Not dollar store Post Malone…

**CrimsonROSET** (3): honestly this song’s lyrics are pretty nice but he really chose to sang them in the worst way possible

**jman457** (3): outside of this sexy guitar intro there is really nothing much here

**jsonphile** (3): there’s enough sad boys who can do sad boy effectively we don’t need this dude

**runaway3212** (3): Honestly maybe his ex was right

**Uberpigeon** (3): im so sick of this generic beat and these bottom of the barrel baby booboo lyrics are not it

**celladonn** (2): Accurate title because I'm "falling" asleep

**hephaestionline** (2): discount The Kid Laroi

**MrMoodle** (2): the instrumental is kind of vibey but holy fuck i actually want to sew this man’s mouth shut every fucking chirp he makes causes my butt cheeks to clench in frustration

**ReallyCreative** (2): yuck

**teenwitches** (2): super duper generic

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): What a perfect encapsulation of all the things I hate in modern pop songs: simplistic trap beats, boring lyrics, ugly melodies, and of course, a singer that CANNOT SING

**waluigiest** (2): bad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.5): Is this the 2021 Chainsmokers? Not interested.

**2RINITY** (1): Boooooooooriiiiiiiiiiiiing

**AHSWeeknd** (1): the style of singing is awful, sorry to whomever gives this an eleven

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): sadboy hip hop was a mistake

**ImADudeDuh** (1): one of the most BORING hits of last year

**intheaftermath** (1): oh my god no

**qazz23** (1): Don't like this vocal style at all

**sssaaage** (1): his voice is genuinely so awful and is so grating and to make it worse this has like the most annoying melody ever

**steelstepladder** (1): I sleep

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): its bad

**thedoctordances1940** (1): I had happily forgotten this song exists and was living in peace. Thanks for reminding me of it I guess.

**wavingwolves** (1): ...and not the male bananis and avocadis vocals here too

**welcome2thejam** (1): Definitely my least favorite song in the few rates I've done. Just sludgy and ugly and an absolute chore to sit through. Only thing keeping it from my first zero is that it never reached overplay status for me since it was never put in commercials and I avoided it on radio at every turn, so small mercies I suppose

**xavieryes** (1): zero contender. his voice is vomit-inducing and the whole song is sluggish and annoying

**bigbigbee** (0): Wikipedia says that “The song was conceived in "a matter of hours” and boy, you can tell. Dreary and awful.

**camerinian** (0): there's not a song on this list that merits itself either as music or as a TikTok trend less than this. Nothing impacts, nothing is made clear or even artfully ambiguous, the emotions and tone are totally muddled, and there's nothing noteworthy to latch on to, even the bit that TikTok actually did use all the time for no discernible reason. This dude sucks. Just go listen to Post Malone you sadboi losers

I wanna know exactly what y'all are smoking that makes you enjoy this song

This song sucks, plain and simple. I can't justify anything about it. Sorry.

#https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20366662

**LesApfels** (11): Listen, I can't make the music not bop

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): Is it very good? No. But it's my most played song of the year and that's for a reason: it is *crazy* catchy. I'd give it my 11 but Surfjan is there and I can't just not give it to him. It's funny cause I made a whole post about how much I hate this and Addison Rae. Months later I'm lowkey staining her (though her Met Gala look was TRAGIC)

**joeeswift** (10): I unironically love this

**rickikardashian** (10): /srs I have to defend this song because it gets a lot of undeserved flack because it’s by Addison race, which I get, she’s not necessarily a likable figure and this song surely doesn’t help with trying to make anyone sympathize with her, but this is a genuinely a very well done song. Yes, the chorus might be vapid and would benefit greatly from other lyrics, but I’ve seen songs with clunkier lines go unnoticed, and I will NOT stay silent when you all gang up on this song solely because it was given to a non-Popheads-approved blonde. This is just a bop, and it 100% deserves better than whatever Day 1 placement it ends up getting.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): THIS is the music I want from tiktok stars, not people hiding behind fake deep songs (looking at you Dixie)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): This feels like a song from a comedy show where the popular vapid character starts a music career, it’s giving A Little Bit Alexis

**TiltControls** (9): this song is terrible

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): ok girlie

**1998tweety** (8): i like that charlie puth song i cant remember the name of rn

**akanewasright** (8): Unfortunately this is slickly produced and also really funny. Plus one of my good friends started (un?)ironically stanning this song, and so now I think of him when I hear this

**CrimsonROSET** (8): everyday my liking of this song gets less ironic

**educationalmirror** (8): I like this selena gomez-esque song, is that so bad?

**pig-serpent** (8): I was expecting to really love this one on first listen but after repeated listens it's just not quite there. The song is just a little too low key for me, both in the instrumentation and vocals, and as a result it's not quite popping for me.

**throwaway7650** (8): ...maybe I do have something in common with the kid laroi

**vayyiqra** (8): This is pretty good?? I thought her music would be a joke.

**jman457** (7.4): They played the Addison Rae song on The L Word and it...was kind of a bop? Perhaps it's situational.

**awhile2** (7): by far the best tik tok star gone pop star single

**letsallpoo** (7): oh no this isnt awful

**qazz23** (7): Decent hook but somewhat generic

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): nothing special, but not bad. wish it were longer.

**duochromepalmtree** (6.5): one million times better than anything Dixie damilio has done. But there’s obviously no heart here. Catchy as hell though.

**veryanniev** (6.5): of course it’s not half as good as Mariah’s Obsessed, but it’s still a bop, which made sense when I checked who wrote and produced this

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): the production (beyond the vocals) kinda bops here but i can’t go that high when its so obvious her range is like… 2 notes

**seanderlust** (6.2): addison has charisma. nerve? she had the nerve to wear that ugly ass green dress as the UFC correspondent, I give that to her. uniqueness and talent? I don't see any. she's just CN.

**banmoderator** (6): guilty pleasure and the dance is hilarious

**bluepupz** (6): Hmm some of the whisper stutter parts lowkey remind me of Selena, but I think they're the worst at the end when she goes acapella since the beats/production carry this song. There's a sort of hilarious irony to a TikTok star singing about being obsessed with herself LOL.

**hephaestionline** (6): Addison doesn't show up on my FYP but this okay ig

**rslashpoopheads** (6): this ain't bad honestly

**schwiftydude047** (6): yeah I know we give her a hard time, but at least the basis of the song is pretty heartwarming. the song is pretty catchy too.

**skargardin** (6): I need way more energy from this but it's not the worst thing ever

**whatsanillinois** (6): i can't believe this is one of the better songs on here

**95ztaehyung** (5.5): it’s certainly a song

**hikkaru** (5.5): it's not horrid but it feels a bit unfinished?

**kreddit2** (5.5): still generic but addison is performing the hell out of it in the video so + points there

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Well it's better than Dixie's

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.2): There's parts of this song that kinda remind me of Selena Gomez's stuff (Addison's vocal tone, the "Hands To Myself"-type drum programming and whatnot).This one doesn't really go anywhere either.

frogaranaman: #END INFLUENCER CULTURE

**2RINITY** (5): Nowhere near good enough to dethrone "Obsessed" by Mariah Carey

**aestheticen** (5): I hate that I like it a little bit....

**Brendon-Urine** (5): not as horrible as it could be. do not hate this

**cheatviathan** (5): Outsold Mariah Carey, but that says more about the failure of that track than the quality of this one. The beat is a vibe, and the vocals are solid, but the lyrical content does nothing for me, and the repeated syllables in the chorus annoy me.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): Mariah Carey wishes she could be Addison Rae

**intheaftermath** (5): it's not Build a Bitch but it's not Be Happy, y'know?

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): Megan Trainor outsold

**nt96** (5): meh

**runaway3212** (5): This isn't good but it is a bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyousJw/

**tinaoe** (5): this is SO meh

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this is the least interesting of the influencer songs in the rate

**waluigiest** (5): what’s wrong with being confident?

**Square\_Preparation55** (4.2): somehow only the second best song with this exact title to have blown up on TikTok

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): this girl is a narcissist

**bigbigbee** (4): I was interested in seeing how many of these songs that my tik tok-er sister knew, so I played her every song in the playlist. I would say that out of 72 songs, she knew 60 of them within the first 5 seconds, and another 5 she knew when we got to a different part of the song. Anyway all I’m gonna say is that she didn’t know this one.

**GARjuna** (4): so boring

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (4): where's the flavor? music equivalent of La Croix

**thedoctordances1940** (4): Bella Poarch outsold

**welcome2thejam** (4): What a Villain Song. "I'd die for me too" broke something in my brain

**2dina3dworld** (3): Mariah’s legacy

**apatel27** (3): song just doesn't go anywhere

**best-american-record** (3): it’s just so bland

**camerinian** (3): this really does scream “music as a vanity project” louder than any song has in a while

**jasannn** (3): This is just so plain.

**jsonphile** (3): This sounds like a bad Selena Gomez song. And I don’t even like Selena Gomez that much, but she is leagues beyond Addison

**just\_thonking** (3): she just sounds tired

**MrMoodle** (3): i think it’s kind fun that an influencer made a song about being obsessed with herself without even a hint of irony, but the song is way too fucking boring for that to save it

**plastichaxan** (3): there's worse here

**Roxieloxie** (3): who is funding these influencers

**Uberpigeon** (3): the tea is if ariana grande released this people would be eating it up

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): La-la-la-la-la-la-la a little bit Addison

**arhmaer** (2): i mean it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. genuinely. like i thought this would be truly atrocious and it's really just.... kinda obnoxious and super boring. not as offensively awful as i expected.

**avg-vag** (2): no thank you

**bbfan132** (2): not into this at all, so boring

**flibbityflob** (2): It's fine and then the chorus hits and I get so angry it's almost funny

**IIIHenryIII** (2): She's even more obsessed with autotune.

**ProfeNeuro** (2): Wait, she’s among the most followed people on TikTok?

**steelstepladder** (2): OMG I LOVE CHARLIE PUTH <3

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): this sounds like a selena gomez song

**AHSWeeknd** (1): Mariah Carey outsold, but what in the world are these lyrics oh god.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): The choreography in this video...

**ReallyCreative** (1): obsessed.... with turning the volume down

**shhhneak** (1): White mediocrity really gets you going places.

**sssaaage** (1): shouldve never been recorded

**Verrem** (1): Narcissus has nothing on this bitch

**wavingwolves** (1): the way she sings this as if she would rather be doing anything else but that is so funny to me

**xavieryes** (1): i had no idea who the fuck Addison Rae was until doing this rate and i actually loved this song on the first listens, and i had even given it a 10 when i first sent the scores. it's so obnoxious and narcissistic i ended up liking it in a "so bad it's good" way, comparable to how i assume people who like annoying Cher Lloyd songs like Want U Back feel about them. it's also insanely catchy, and i found the "plot twist" kinda funny. but then i realized that no this song is just flat-out terrible. i think what made me change my mind the most was that horrendous "i'd die for me too" line.

**teenwitches** (0): this is so aggressively mediocre but for some reason her robotic vocals get stuck in my head constantly

**TheQueenOfVultures** (0): God she just sounds so deeply unpleasant

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (6): kinda straight, but also bangs

**Roxieloxie** (6): i think im enjoying the bonus rate more than the main rate just for the sheer amount of???? im learning

**vayyiqra** (6): Not very good vocals but this beat kinda bangs

**seanderlust** (5.7): yuh

**duochromepalmtree** (5.5): but the guy who made this is a genius. He has such a hold on the app fr

**cheatviathan** (5): This song is neither an enjoyable novelty nor a horrendous failed attempt at novelty. It just exists. I’m sure TikTok has found ways to make it into a good meme, but the song on its own is too bland and generic for words.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): who the fuck is margo

**nt96** (5): Wh-- y-y, is-- ss he spe--k --ing l--ike th--at (yuh)

**schwiftydude047** (5): the piano in the background is pretty nice.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.8): It's aight lol.

**inesmina** (4.5): ?!

**intheaftermath** (4): my sister being named Margo singlehandedly ruins this song for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this beat sounds like evil kahoot music

**bluepupz** (3.5): The singing that started around 1:30 made it worse lmao. Do you know who's Margo?

**aestheticen** (3): ??????

**bbfan132** (3): the beat is nice i guess

**Uberpigeon** (3): i dont get it

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Why is this in the bonus rate? I literally don’t understand the difference between this song and like half of the rap tracks in the main rate

**2dina3dworld** (1): and I call you a has been. If this was in the main rate than my zero would actually have competition. Tiago is a rude asshole who can’t take criticism, he could release this generations Bohemian Rhapsody and I would not listen because I will always remember how conceited and narcissistic he was in his Tik toks. The undeserved confidence of some people!

**cremeebrulee** (1): men should not be heard i think

**nootnoot781** (1): vile

this is the worst fucking thing to happen to the entire fucking app

---

**runaway3212** (10): Exactly bitch

**throwaway7650** (10): BEGONE :thots: lil mayo kind of sounds like ronniesus

**akanewasright** (9.5): This fucks. Wait no, it’s abstinent but it could fuck if it wanted to

**bigbigbee** (9): It’s really funny. I love absurdist humor and this scratches that itch.

**GARjuna** (8): is this astronaut in the ocean

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I believe in G-O-D

**just\_thonking** (7.5): i have a feeling my average for the bonus tracks is gonna be higher than for the main rate

**TiltControls** (7.5): this is so dumb

**jman457** (7.3): sometimes misogyny hits hard

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): the beginning is so funny to me still

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): I too have thoughts

**vayyiqra** (7): One of the most memey songs in the rate and that's saying a lot; it's very stupid but I chuckled a bit

**duochromepalmtree** (6.8): as a song this is bad. But those opening lines that make up the tik tok trend are genius.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): so true!!

**inesmina** (6): hahaha funny lyrics wtf what a meme

**jackisboredtoday** (6): me at 3am when i’m trying to stop a night of anxiety

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): what in the area 51 is the album cover

**schwiftydude047** (6): ugh those insta thots are so obnoxious.

**Square\_Preparation55** (6): the sniffing noises are funny

**steelstepladder** (6): I thought this was gonna be a 10 but turns out the only good part of this song is the snippet

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.5): I love how there's a little choir every time he mentions God, that's pretty fun. The song is insanely short though.

**2dina3dworld** (5): this sounds like something a youth pastor would put on over his talk about chastity, and the entire message of the song would then go over his head

**best-american-record** (5): good for a meme song

**CrimsonROSET** (5): see he also believes in GOD not THOT

**ImADudeDuh** (5): eh

**matthewc20090** (5): not as funny as some of the other ones

**seanderlust** (5): I was gonna be harsh until I decided this song is just hilarious.

**thedoctordances1940** (5): could be a bit shorter yaknow

**Uberpigeon** (5): i like that he is an alien

**nt96** (4): Be Gone Mayonnaise

**rickikardashian** (4): this is a lot less funny when it passes the 15 second mark

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1C7Vt/

**intheaftermath** (3.5): it's just annoying, sorry

**camerinian** (3): even though this is in the meme portion of the rate, I honestly can't tell the difference between this and most of the edgy boy hip-hop in the actual rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): “be gone thots, go away, im a man of god” walked so “i believe in g-o-d don’t believe in t-h-o-t” could crawl

**whatsanillinois** (3): is this the new brockhampton

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (2.5): good god what is this?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.3): I-

**plastichaxan** (2): "everywhere i go i got thots" me but about the emote thots from discord cause i love her sm also this song is really something

**1998tweety** (1): gross

**aestheticen** (1): What the fuck is this

**AHSWeeknd** (1): it’s egregious

**avg-vag** (1): this exists to be viral, it’s not music

**banmoderator** (1): no no no no no

**bbfan132** (1): crickets

**bluepupz** (1): What the fuck is this [1] This is stupid as hell lol.

**brenda\_official** (1): dont need to explain this score

**celladonn** (1): Joke songs that fail miserably at being funny are so embarrassing

**flibbityflob** (1): imagine thinking catholics arent innately horny. couldn't be me! this song blows.

**jsonphile** (1): okay this is not a real song. And it’s not a very funny joke either to anyone above the age of fifteen

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (1): Christians :/

**ReallyCreative** (1): suddenly I'm old, I don't know

I know it's supposed to be ironically bad but it ends up just being Bad

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): “we’re fighting in the grocery store and I love you but i'm not sure that I like you anymore” is truly one of the most beautiful and relatable lines from any song I’ve ever listened to and I can’t believe it’s from this song. … actually, I can’t believe how well written this song is. Seriously, this kinda hits.

**bbfan132** (10): poetry

**rickikardashian** (10): this could be a phoebe bridgers song

**schwiftydude047** (10): how did I forget this? I feel so ashamed!

**stryxen** (10): oh you just had to be there

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1C7BD/

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): but if Taylor did it you'd call it a serve

**TragicKingdom1** (10): WE'RE FIGHITNG IN THE FCUKNG GROCERY STORE !!!!!!

**Roxieloxie** (9): i kinda hate this

**teenwitches** (9): i would like to see the full musical

**jman457** (8.5): this captures New York so well

**MrMoodle** (8): THIS IS Olivia Rodrigo

**shhhneak** (8): We need a Disney Princess on antidepressants at NYU representation.

**waluigiest** (8): LMAO I didn’t know they made this into a full song

**CrimsonROSET** (6): welcome to new york (2014)

**plastichaxan** (6): idk maybe my standards for the rate have dropped by this point

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): what musical is this from? all of them?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): i truly can't tell if this is a joke or if this was a serious attempt at a song

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): the worse NY song in this rate

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): the bones of this are really good but the production quality unfortunately really hurts it

**throwaway7650** (5.5): "chinese food" OMG actual alison gold jumpscare

**akanewasright** (5): What the hall am I listening to

**ignitethephoenix** (5): and we a fighting in the grocery story is a top 10 lyric of all time

**veryanniev** (5): don’t wanna shit on this too much because this is peak theatre kid energy and I could have written something like this back when I was 12

**Square\_Preparation55** (4.2): songwriting is hard

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.1): I think I'd have to agree with this YouTube comment: "This song would've been a banger if it had some production value behind it".

**bluepupz** (4): Why are you theatrically singing about a grocery store fight. New York theater kids are made different, I guess.

**camerinian** (4): that girl’s dad was right

**skargardin** (4): camp i fear

**steelstepladder** (4): Theater kid stuff

**vayyiqra** (4): Okay but why is this a hit it's not that catchy or QuirKy it's just boring

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Fighting in the grocery store 🤝 Chasing shadows in the grocery line

**flibbityflob** (3.8): does this work better if you've ever been to new york??? i'm english??? i don't know what new york is and i'm scared of it. the song wants to be more melancholy than it is and fails because of it.

**AHSWeeknd** (3): I’m not gonna lie, this is what half the “singers” in the main rate sound like.

**best-american-record** (3): it was ok

**celladonn** (3): Clearly I'm missing some tiktok in-joke because I'm not really seeing how this is a meme song, it's not particularly humorous. Or particularly good

**jsonphile** (3): this just feels made by a fifteen year old. And I mean that based on the lyrics, the production, the singing, the melody

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): ?????

**welcome2thejam** (3): This sounds like the first draft of a musical set to a karaoke machine backing track

**seanderlust** (2.5): well it's better than welcome to new york at least

**tinaoe** (2): no

**Uberpigeon** (2): i dont get it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.1): This sounds like a parody of a Regina Spektor song. As a Regina stan I don't like thattt. As much as I love Rebecca Black, this is like the "Friday" of Regina's Begin to Hope.

**aestheticen** (1): ????????

**arhmaer** (1): ah

**avg-vag** (1): i think this is supposed to be funny and i’m not wasting time finding out what it why

**banmoderator** (1): theater kids trying to be funny will never amuse me no matter how hard they try

**brenda\_official** (1): bad

**Brendon-Urine** (1): this is painful to listen to

**cremeebrulee** (1): what the fuck is this

**duochromepalmtree** (1): I’m good without this.

sorry Activision / Blizzard now is a bad time

---

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come ON. the way this song dismantled misogyny....

**banmoderator** (10): i joined tiktok in 2018 when this was at its peak and i play overwatch. it's still funny and half decent

**Hulnia** (10): Ah, I remember the days were me and my primary school friends found this when it dropped, and then we lost our shit when it went viral. 

 Those were the fucking days...

**ImADudeDuh** (10): feminist anthem

**intheaftermath** (10): I would've given this my 11 easily if it was in the main rate. Gamer girl supremacy

**rickikardashian** (10): the people that made fun of that one blonde girl for having her control turned off for the tiktok were very obnoxious

**runaway3212** (10): Yass feminism!

**steelstepladder** (10): This might have been the first Tik Tok I've ever seen

**stryxen** (10): oh you just had to be there

**Square\_Preparation55** (9.8): second best gaming themed song after don't mine at night

**akanewasright** (9.7): I had a massive crush on a guy who unfortunately happened to be a bit of a gamer (but like… a gamer who showers), and he once got mildly bent out of shape about someone who referenced this song. He claimed he just found it annoying (he was a bit of an ass about TikTok success), but I know that he mostly plays healers in Overwatch so 💀

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): i miss 2016 Overwatch

**throwaway7650** (9.5): GAYMERS RISE UP (no but gamer rage is so real FUCK)

**nootnoot781** (9): bop

**nt96** (9): This actually takes me back to when Overwatch still had that jubilant spark in its community, even the toxicity was still there. Now it's just…..there :(

**veryanniev** (9): this is such an undeniable banger. it’s like «The Point of No Return» from a parallel universe.

**jsonphile** (8.5): what this kinda slaps….WAIT THIS IS THE IM ALREADY TRACER SONG??? Why the hell is the worst part of this song the only part I’ve heard

**2dina3dworld** (8): I wanna be Winston 👀

**aestheticen** (8): At times I unironically like this song. I certainly miss 2016 Overwatch when you could mass rez people. 5 years on and I still play this dead game

**bluepupz** (8): This is a bop. Who cares if it's two Overwatch players arguing over characters. I finally found the source of that bridge, even I knew about that without ever touching TikTok lol.

**camerinian** (8): As a result of a two-year investigation, on July 20, 2021, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a suit alleging sexual harassment, employment discrimination and retaliation on the part of Activision Blizzard. The details of the allegations involve accusations of inappropriate behavior towards women and fostering a "frat boy" culture. The company's management initially tried to pass off the allegations as false, which led to employees sharply criticizing the management's lack of seriousness in the matter. Even after CEO's Bobby Kotick's open letter to employees that said their initial response was improper and that they would be internally reviewing matters, employees still staged a walk-off to protest the lack of action the company had taken in regards to the lawsuit. But anyway funny song haha

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i did NOT ask to get dragged back to 2017 youtube.

**schwiftydude047** (8): the lyrics do sum up my experience playing Overwatch.

**teenwitches** (8): this is why i only play video games alone

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): why is this good though?

**tinaoe** (8): unironically i like this

**welcome2thejam** (8): Could I interest you in a DPS Zenyatta?

**BoneStreetSand** (7.7): I didn’t realise this was THAT song and I was shook when the memed part played.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Big “nerds who learned charisma relatively late in life and are trying to make up for lost time” energy here. Speaking from experience of course

**duochromepalmtree** (7): I have no idea what this is or why it exists but the tik tok sound lives in my brain rent free

**TragicKingdom1** (7): honestly i didnt realize this was a meme song

**seanderlust** (6.7): great gamer representation in this bonus rate

**cheatviathan** (6): I played Overwatch religiously from the day it dropped to the Brigitte update. Is it worth returning to all these years later? How has the meta shifted? I’m genuinely curious.

**flibbityflob** (6): regrettably, i am a gamer. but also if you're complaining about there being no healer on the team comp go play healer for the love of god you are part of the problem. also rip to 2017 mercy, completely different character play-wise.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): hahaha overwatch right guys? Cheers luv? Hamster ball? Can you tell I’ve never played this game before?

**GARjuna** (5): fuck all the way off

**Uberpigeon** (5): this is so embarazzing to be showing up on my spotify i am embarazzed

**waluigiest** (5): ?

**AHSWeeknd** (4): stream Have Mercy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): The Living Tombstone is a pretty popular name in certain fandoms but most of his songs do barely anything for me. Also, I've never actually played Overwatch in my life.

**slimboyfriend** (4): I did not understand a word of this

**TiltControls** (4): just play mh

**vayyiqra** (4): Aside from being very catchy this sound is also deeply annoying and has theatre kid energy but I'll give it a few points

**plastichaxan** (3.8): i've never really understood these type of songs

**apatel27** (3): Gamer songs usually suck and this is no exception.

**avg-vag** (3): i only play sims and it’s a solo game :(

**jman457** (3): I just hate the voice

**Roxieloxie** (3): this rate is causing me to take fucking damage

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3): it's giving Disney and i really do not vibe with it

**2RINITY** (2): In this house we say "Fuck Activision Blizzard"

**bbfan132** (2): was excited for this to end but i’m happy for anyone who likes this lol

**ReallyCreative** (2): gamers deserve to be oppressed

**arhmaer** (1): no

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): oh my FUCKING GOD. THIS is the song that sends me into a fucking rage of this whole rate. If ONLY I could give this a zero. Here I am, a millennial who should be dunking on Gen Z stuff, right? NO! Not with this fucking cheugy-ass, 2011 millennial dashcon Tumblr bullshit!!!!!! This song definitely "forgot to be awesome". This "Boardgame Couple" -ass song. This song is TOO into Lindsay Stirling and Felicia Day. This song cosplays as Dr. Horrible Sing-a-long at mid-tier comic-cons. Nerds were a mistake!!!! Burn this song to the ground. Or burn it in the deflated dashcon ball pit.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (1): I hate mercy mains. They pick mercy every single game then refuse to swap, putting you at a huge disadvantage. Even if it's a 1 minute tiebreaker round and they'll never get a resurrection off they still pick her. You look at their profile and they have 90 hours on mercy and nothing on anything else. They spend the whole game flaming their team's 'terrible' picks (while playing perhaps the most situational healer) then at the end complain that 'nobody protected me ... how could I heal?' Nothing is ever their fault. They're just a nice guy trying to support their dumbass DPS to victory. Just because you're playing a support doesn't make you any better than people that pick hanzo or widowmaker every single game.

**my friend Ethan** (1): fuck you

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): not exactly the best time to be rating a song thats a parody of a blizzard game

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (1): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1aQB4/

**Verrem** (1): Overwatch bad

Honestly, this song is so fucking funny and has some genuinely funny lines. "You can download my dick off Google Drive / It's up for auction on eBay" and "I offer excellent toe sucking services" in the outro never fail to make me laugh, even more than some intentional comedy songs. Besides that, it's a really fun rap song. Super high energy, never drags, there's always something around the corner that's unexpected.  It is ridiculously abrasive, though, which generally gets in the way of this sub's enjoyment of songs so I understand why it placed so low. 

But the comedy of it all, damnit! The comedy of it all!

#good morning Tokyo

**2dina3dworld** (10): the line “y’all n-words fuck like James Charles” ages like wine everytime James Charles gets cancelled for being a predator

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is gonna go out early day 1 and its gonna make me sad, the way this slaps... its illegal i fear they are coming for necks

**bigbigbee** (10): This song is a banger. I LOVE his charisma. This song makes me laugh, but like, laugh and bop simultaneously? However, I was watching a compilation of tik toks to this song and non-Black people get FAR too close to lip-syncing the n-word for my liking on that app. Especially when they make a joke out of it, or like, a winky face to the camera, like “ooops! I almost….but I didn’t!” ;)

**Roxieloxie** (10): 'YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MY DICK OFF GOOGLE DRIVE' FDKSGSDJFKDSF GIRL WHAT IS THIS

**runaway3212** (10): If you're not black you can only sing like half this song

**steelstepladder** (10): We love someone who sells dick pics.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyo5gjg/

**Hulnia** (9): Terrible person, but I’ll never get over this stupid song, it will NEVER fail to slap every time. 

 That outro though- 😭

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This song is so stupid… I kinda love it. It’s so bouncy and doesn’t take itself too seriously. And $40 an inch is a bargain! But more importantly: If a lot of people on this sub were like me, you all probably had some… opinions on the James Charles line. But I’m gonna say go watch the Genius lyric video, I think his comments on that line were actually very thoughtful and it made me warm up to him a lot more.

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): this kinda goes off wait hold up what the fuck was that outro

**celladonn** (8.5): This has a manic energy that is very appealing to me

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): i guess this is just another song about tokyo

**wavingwolves** (8.3): good morning to you too ig

**akanewasright** (8): I have so many thoughts and yet I don’t think I have the words for any of them

**camerinian** (8): there's a primal, caveman part of my brain that really connects with this, and the part that's repulsed by this kid is screaming into the uncaring void

**GARjuna** (8): HELPPPPP parody????? this is so funy

**sssaaage** (8): this bops sorry

**thedoctordances1940** (8): ok this is a banger

**plastichaxan** (7.8): screams and whispers always a good combo for me. UPDATE: lowered for that ending not the toe-sucking services

**MrMoodle** (7.5): this is fun but i imagined if i ever heard it more than once in a row it would lose its appeal

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): "I can’t see the bullshit like Ray Charles" 60s Pop Soul promo omg

**2RINITY** (7): Could've been an 8 if the punchlines came a little stronger

**bbfan132** (7): like this sonically

**Brendon-Urine** (7): xxxtentacion rip off... but i dont hate it

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i wonder if anyone ever took him up on his toe sucking services

**apatel27** (6): rather listen to Rico

**matthewc20090** (6): this man rly into feet like that lmaoooo

**pig-serpent** (6): I love the loud and aggressive rap style but the beat isn't crazy enough to match his unhinged persona he's rapping through. This is so close to being amazing but it's falling short.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): adding a point for "toe sucking services"

**throwaway7650** (6): he sounds like he's trying to imitate flo milli but failing (she deserved to be here) but THE JAMES CHARLES LINE HELP

**Uberpigeon** (6): i was looking at the lyrics while listening and i saw the end bit and i thought someone had vandalised the lyrics page but then he actually said it so thats kind of iconic

frogaranaman: #good night Tokyo

**1998tweety** (5): its giving 6ix9ine. honestly it takes a second to go off but its not awful

**aestheticen** (5): Do not like his voice sorry

**jman457** (5): mom can you pick me up im scared, reminds me of a XXX song

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (5): for the whites: please stop barking at the camera. for everyone else, carry on (me: so, everyone but white people can bark at the camera | Daniel: no)

**ProfeNeuro** (5): me when it’s morning in tokyo. Also love how they censor the f-word, but don’t censor anything else.

**ReallyCreative** (5): I can't imagine this doing well, and it's pretty meh, but there's something catchy about it that puts it safely above the bottom rung of the rate for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): really didnt need this dude to tell us he sucks toes at the ending

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): that first lyric caught my attention but the toe line drops it a lot

**Iris3271** (4): I really liked this song until the homophobic line

**schwiftydude047** (4): kinda forgettable to me honestly.

**AHSWeeknd** (3): how does TikTok find this stuff

**arhmaer** (3): found the vocals SUPER grating but that is Just Me

**cheatviathan** (3): A combination of adlibs that won’t shut the hell up and a grating whistle sound in the beat make worse another piece of trap gunk that will be banished to the shadow realm once the rate is over.

**intheaftermath** (3): this title really made me think I was about to get something pop inspired but all I got was grunting for two minutes

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): This is honestly annoying.

**stryxen** (3): yucky blucky fruitcake but scary

**TiltControls** (3): GOODBYEGOODMORNINGTOKYO

**waluigiest** (3): no shape at all

**flibbityflob** (2.5): mom pick me up i'm scared. never have i felt more white in my entire life.

**hephaestionline** (2): obligatory straight TikTok comment

**ignitethephoenix** (2): was not expecting James Charles and toe sucking references in this song

**jsonphile** (2): okay this is way too much

**kreddit2** (2): no beat ... a toe sucking line...no good lines overall

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (2): this sounds like something the boys at my high school would upload to soundcloud as a joke

**vayyiqra** (2): is this a joke because I'd like this more knowing it's a parody

**shhhneak** (1.5): This is why Rina Sawayama wrote Tokyo Love Hotel.

**banmoderator** (1): the spoken word outro made me scoff

**bluepupz** (1): The screaming/yelling plus the rapping is really something, huh.

**BoneStreetSand** (1): I don’t forgive y’all for making me listen to this… btw the only reason why this isn’t my 0 is because he offers good toe sucking services.

**CrimsonROSET** (1): ‘shhhh be quiet’ take your own fucking advice

**HogwartsReject1912** (1): Maybe I'm just not huge on trap rap by men?

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Is this Fetch the Bolt Cutters influence? Just kidding. I'm pretty sure Fiona wasn't' the first to add dog barks to a song.

**nt96** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrPUvC7q6AY

**rickikardashian** (1): this sound brought discourse to my fyp for what felt like months and i cant listen to this song without thinking of anonymous tiktok accounts justifying this song trying to sneak in the f slur by saying “actually, you’re the real homophobe for thinking that a bleeped-out word that starts with f being used to refer refering to a famous gay celebrity was the f slur instead of the word fake”

**rslashpoopheads** (1): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**seanderlust** (1): ....so you didn't say the homophobic f word, but you put in a censor to make the audience think you did....have you considered just making a good song?

**slimboyfriend** (1): I hope he had a good time making this because I had a horrible time listening to it

**teenwitches** (1): is this from "straight tiktok" bc i've never heard this song before

**Verrem** (1): please stop whispering in my ear

**veryanniev** (1): so insanely annoying

**xavieryes** (1): insufferable

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): holy shit, this song is unbearable

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): Now what is the parody shitty version of South Florida soundclap rap. Let me just listen to Ski Mask or something lol

**jasannn** (0): even if this song isn't supposed to be taken serious, it's still unlistenable

**lost-ln-the-echo** (0): everything about this is just horrible. The beat? The screeching? The creepy lyrics? No. Just no.

**Square\_Preparation55** (0): the lyrics are gross and the artist is an alleged pedophile, which makes it worse

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (0): yikes

Ah yes, the Renegade. The most classic of all the Tiktok dance audios included in this rate. I completely did not expect this song to do well at all, even despite its huge impact on both the app and general pop culture. But then again, it's not the greatest of songs out there? The beat is monstrous, but the rapping is just fine. It is fun to bump occasionally, but it definitely is not something I seek out ever. I feel like this is really a robbery of a placement, though. It definitely deserved a day two offering at the minimum.

#renegade, renegade, renegade

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoVVat/

**Roxieloxie** (10): probably the only tiktok trend im really aware off, I have so many videos on my phone of my dormates trying to do the dance to this before lockdown started. So i had a pretty good ideas of it before the news broke that this dance was essentially the gentrified version.

**cremeebrulee** (9): its not particularly good but its iconic

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the most famous tiktok dance ever...yet the song itself is somehow underrated!! its a huge bop

**wavingwolves** (8.7): got me vibing and i'm not mad about it

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): 8 points for the cultural significance and the chokehold it has on me, .5 for the song

**MrMoodle** (8.5): this kind of instrumental with the big and chunky vocals would be a match made in heaven

**AHSWeeknd** (8): oh this is that one?

**sssaaage** (8): banger

**camerinian** (7.5): y’all got any more bass or

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): this is arguable THE biggest song on tiktok ever and honestly it deserve it

**akanewasright** (7.3): I literally did not perceive a single lyric to this song I just think the beat slaps

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.2): This is for Jalaiah Harmon

**2RINITY** (7): That's Jalaiah Harmon's dance, nobody else's

**arhmaer** (7): HATE to admit this kinda goes hard

**GARjuna** (7): why is this thing called lottery there and renegade here lol. [**Host’s note: this was like the day one version of the ballot, trust me it was an entire mess**]

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's not really anything special but I don't hate it

**schwiftydude047** (7): the dance for this one is still pretty fun honestly.

**steelstepladder** (6.9): woah

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): having to retitle it after the producer tag bc that was that part that took off SENDS

**rickikardashian** (6.5): now this was a cultural reset. where were you when charli posted her first renegade video?

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**kreddit2** (6): nice beat

**LesApfels** (6): I thought they were saying "Burn the gays" for the longest time

**rslashpoopheads** (6): do not stream lotto by exo

**waluigiest** (6): who wants to see my renegade???

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): did anyone else read the short story the Lottery in school?

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): I'm just now realizing Fortnite likes to profit off TikTok.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): burn the gays...?

**throwaway7650** (5.5): a cultural reset (impact-wise, the song itself is meh)

#burn the gays, burn the gays, burn the gays

**aestheticen** (5): I love how no one ends up knowing this song as "Lottery"

**apatel27** (5): can't get with the self call and response type of rapping

**BoneStreetSand** (5): Taylor Swift sounds different…

**cheatviathan** (5): This sounds like someone found a stock trap beat on the Internet, put a low effort verse and chorus on there as placeholders, and then, someone decided to release to the public in its unfinished state. There’s nothing to be mad about, but also no reason to care.

**hikkaru** (5): now that we're done with that, you want to see my renegade?

**Hulnia** (5): I’ll never understand how this never crossed over to the chart, it feels like the biggest song of all time when. 

 Regardless, I’m kinda glad, it got old REALLY quickly, and it’s awfully repetitive.

**joeeswift** (5): still salty bc I could never do the dance

**95ztaehyung** (4.8): just doesnt go anywhere??

**ProfeNeuro** (4.8): Gambling is bad for you. Don’t do it.

**flibbityflob** (4.7): categorically a song, still not great. i don't care about rap all that much so...

**jman457** (4.6): I mean its catchy I guess…

**duochromepalmtree** (4.5): boring but I did shake my ass while listening so

**bbfan132** (4): kind of boring tbh

**best-american-record** (4): im just so tired of hearing this song

**seanderlust** (4): not me audibly saying "is this gonna go anywhere or-" during listening to this

**thedoctordances1940** (4): yeah this kinda sucks

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): yaaaaawn

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3.5): I like how the whole reason this song got the "Renegade" subtitle was because the producer's tag in the intro was mixed way too high.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): nope, this is not good

**banmoderator** (3): the rest of the song is bad

**bluepupz** (3): I'm not very convinced by the use of "Go, go, go, go, let's go" as a hook tbh. It's a bit irritating.

**celladonn** (3): This is pretty monotonous

**runaway3212** (3): god this is beyond boring

**shhhneak** (3): Addison Rae you will be dealt with.

**Uberpigeon** (3): lets not go

**jasannn** (2): Iconic tik tok sound but terrible song.

**matthewc20090** (2): its really boring outside of the intro

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (2): gentrified rap. Charli D'Amelio, I'm looking at you. please learn. a. beat. any one of them. please

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (2): all i see is james charles doing the dance

**whatsanillinois** (2): this is the one tiktok dance i've ever learned

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): the first 10 seconds are good i guess

**CrimsonROSET** (1): see gucci gang worked because it was the same thing repeated over and over if you break the one rule of what makes these good you’re cutting your chances of making something like this work by like at least 85%

**hephaestionline** (1): gonna tell my kids this was renegade (feat. Taylor Swift)

**pig-serpent** (1): I hate this kind of beat and the rapper sounds squeaky and like he's not trying. So basically one of my least favorite styles of music ever.

**plastichaxan** (1): i am heterophobic and this was a moment for the straights so

**TiltControls** (1): is it bad or is it K CAMP

**Verrem** (1): all these bass overloaded rap songs are starting to sound the same...

I literally don't know what y'all expected with this song the cover art is literally about fingering 

Honestly, this is a huge banger. That beat is monstrous and the rapping on this ain't too shabby. This is also another iteration of the "Jason Derulo hopping onto a Tiktok hit" trend, which I personally detest to the highest degree. The snippet that's used for its dance explains why it became one of the most used audios on the app, it's super easy to dance to and is just generally super fun. Y'all did this dirty!

#mis amigos

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh this FUCKS

**GARjuna** (9.8): love these horns

**nt96** (9.5): Slut dropping to this in the privacy of my own room.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): I don’t speak the language but they’re kind of going off

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): the beat on this song goes legitimately hard. Makes me want to dance the night away in a neon dress.

**akanewasright** (8): I don’t know what these lyrics translate to aside from the title, but I’m gonna assume the rest of them are filthy so I can shake ass to them

**apatel27** (8): assuming this is the original. Jason Derulo version is an atrocity

**kreddit2** (8): my first on this list !!!! never heard this before, i think the beat's cool though i laugh a bit because coño in Tagalog is "derogatory term for people who seem to be high-class and/or vain " (thanks google - could not figure out how to word it) lol saving this to spotify

**letsallpoo** (8): i hope apple music knows that by censoring the title it just made me want to search up what it means

**seanderlust** (7.9): the facetime sound effect was clever. it's kind of a bop

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): kind of slaps

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): maybe I would hate it if I knew what they were saying but that beat goes hard ngl

**bbfan132** (7): this bops

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): it's aight, kinda slaps. it low-key slaps

**educationalmirror** (7): not sure what he's saying but girl I am living

**jman457** (7): Its get my ass shaking so what more can I ask for

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7): "coño", as quoted from una puta pinche bendejo maricon

**plastichaxan** (7): kind of a bop ngl

**ReallyCreative** (7): catchy? idk this is the kind of song I normally don't like but I'm kinda into it

**rickikardashian** (7): i miss feeling the bass from this song shake the walls of the bathroom while im trying to pee drunk

**runaway3212** (7): kinda sad that this is the dutch hiphop song that went viral but oh well

**throwaway7650** (7): the beat is disgustingly catchy but I'm not a fan of his voice

**wavingwolves** (7): i do not like the singer's voice but the beat is sooooo goooooood

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): it's fine but the energy's a bit low for me, I kept waiting for/expecting something to happen but nothing???

**2RINITY** (6): TIL the Dutch are still making moombahton

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Funny how we don't even need to watch the music video or search the lyrics to conclude that this song is dirty. I ended up watching the video anyway and, yeah, I was right. "Coño" doesn't mean what I thought it did, though. But I got very close lol

**rslashpoopheads** (6): twerking my poño

**schwiftydude047** (6): catchy saxophone ngl.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJox8F3/

**vayyiqra** (6): is this hyperpop

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): I thought that this was gonna be that one cat song, but this is alright if a bit bland

**aestheticen** (5.5): It does sound very TikTok bait

#ODIO ESTAS PUTAS!!!!!

**1998tweety** (5): nah

**bluepupz** (5): This would be really popular in a club, the beat goes hard. I just can't get past all the "coño"s in the song though, this is a little much LOL.

**cheatviathan** (5): I feel absolutely nothing from this. Maybe it’s because reggaeton is a genre that I’m not fully into, but I fail to see what about this was worth blowing up through TikTok.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): In the Netherlands, they don't say "I love you", they say "Zet het in de coño" and I think that's beautiful

**thedoctordances1940** (5): has some good rapping and some of the beat is really cool but some of it is also really annoying

**CrimsonROSET** (4.5): what the fuck did i just listen to

**flibbityflob** (4.5): This song being in a language I don't speak improves it immensely. The beat's really good, and there's no terrible lyrics to distract. Looking at YOU astronaut in the ocean.

**sssaaage** (4.5): girl what

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): this is super forgettable

**pig-serpent** (4): The bassline on this song is nicely produced but it doesn't go anywhere.

**slimboyfriend** (4): anyway stream Pu$$y by Bad Gyal

**steelstepladder** (4): Not really a song this one

**Uberpigeon** (4): it means cone????? why are they singing about cones.. cones of dunshire type beat

**hephaestionline** (3): ngl I miss when my TikTok was 80% thirst traps dancing to the Love Story remix

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3): annoying.

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I had the wildest time trying to figure out what language this was in, and let me tell you Dutch was not on my list of guesses

**intheaftermath** (2.5): to quote Lil Mariko, "boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring"

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): fart bass lol

**Square\_Preparation55** (1.7): Tony Lopez pops into my head when I hear this song, which is super uncomforting

**banmoderator** (1): LOL this is so low effort

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (1): Not the most pleasant listen.

**ProfeNeuro** (1): Fuck this song. Penalty points because Jason Derulo is in this.

**stryxen** (1): jumpscare

**Verrem** (1): nothing happens for 2:17 minutes

**xavieryes** (1): i feel like this is the kind of song you can only either love or hate. well i hate it.

This song's success is kinda wild to me as it's... just there? I mean, the sub goes crazy over much more drab songs so I guess I kind of get it; when the beat is catchy enough people seem to go wild for the song, but *damn* this song is the last one I expected for being one of the most popular audios lol. It was basically used for EVERYTHING, upon further research, so it makes total sense why, but also the quality of the song isn't really there for it... to me, I guess.

---

#feeling good :)

**CrimsonROSET** (10): someone called this gospel once and i had to do a double take

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**runaway3212** (9): we love positivity

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this could be a chance the rapper song (complimentary)

**seanderlust** (8.5): :)

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8.5): cute

**bluepupz** (8): I like the melody and backing piano. I love the additional instrument (the organ??) near the end as well!

**cremeebrulee** (8): overhated tbh

**GARjuna** (8): it's cute. kinda like hippo campus????

**hephaestionline** (8): the first Surfaces song I heard was actually 24/7/365, thanks to Spotify's Tastebreakers playlist in 2019

**matthewc20090** (8): love this vibe

**nt96** (8): Sunshine vibes all day long☀️

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This is very fun! Wish they didn't use trap drums in it though. Also, holy shit can't believe they did a song with Elton John.

**ReallyCreative** (8): stream Sunday Best by Valiant Vermin

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): not memorable for me to remember it but inoffensive enough i didnt hate it

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this dude’s lyrics make him sound like he was possessed by the soul of Jojo Siwa

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.5): Not the type of sound I normally love, but it works well here and the track feels so sunny and warm. A Whoops Now tea on a minor scale.

**stryxen** (7.5): i just can’t hate this it’s fun

**flibbityflob** (7.3): i love the vibe of this so much.

**2RINITY** (7): This sounds like it'd be a perfect fit for the mood when you're really happy, but a cruel taunt if you put it on when you're depressed and it isn't enough to pull you out of the hole

**Awkward\_King** (7): cool

**cheatviathan** (7): The jaunty pianos, trap percussion, and funk guitars have no right to work so well together, and the organ at the end takes this instrumental over the top. I also enjoy some amount of Gen Z irony, so this should be a slam dunk. But what holds this back from true greatness for me is the vocals.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): this is absolutely a good song and one of the better ones on this list. But I am so sick of hearing this song everywhere all the time!!! Especially in the year 2021! I am not feeling good like I should!!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Til you realize tomorrow's Monday.

**jsonphile** (7): this is pretty goofy but it’s fine. I like the piano riff and it’s just kinda feel good music

**MrMoodle** (7): i think i’m going to have to reevaluate all the songs i’ve rated in the past hour because i know for a FACT that i fucking hate this song but it’s kind of hitting right now, something has happened to my brain that’s distorting my perception

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): i only associate this with youtube vloggers at this point

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1tsnM/

**AHSWeeknd** (6): it ain’t bad, but those vocals

**arhmaer** (6): anti capitalist icons lmfao

**bbfan132** (6): kind of catchy ngl but it gets old quickly

**celladonn** (6): These dudes sound so smug

**schwiftydude047** (6): ladies and gentlemen…we got him. wait no that’s a different song. fuck!

**steelstepladder** (6): People really hated this when it came out... ehh

**welcome2thejam** (6): Don't hate it. Would probably kill at the Catholic middle school Walk-A-Thon afterparty

#feeling like shit!!!!!! fuck Surfaces ig

**awhile2** (5): the fact this song never got a chance the rapper remix is a tragedy

**banmoderator** (5): this is another Straight Fave that i don't understand

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (5): have you thought of doing shrooms, maybe?

**rickikardashian** (5): this sounds like feel-good music made by an AI

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): neighborhuuuiiiiiid

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): Way too optimistic for my taste

**throwaway7650** (4.5): the vocals are kind of off-putting but... I don't hate this?

**rslashpoopheads** (4): snoozer

**vayyiqra** (4): It's is okay but why are so many artists in this rate such mediocre singers

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3.5): it's giving background music for a Samsung Galaxy Tablet ad

**akanewasright** (3): This is kinda… nothing?

**bigbigbee** (3): The lyrics to this are so…stoner frat bro road trip…it’s really not a vibe I’m into

**kreddit2** (3): eh

**ProfeNeuro** (3): Turns out these guys are from College Station, Texas, and with this new info, I’m 99.9% confident that this song is peak Aggie-who-likes-to-get-wasted-on-a-Thursday-core. Gig ‘em, I suppose.

**qazz23** (3): It feels generic

**skargardin** (3): oh it's this annoying ass song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): everything about this song sounds like it was recorded on a non-proofread first draft

**TiltControls** (3): something about this just feels so... lifeless

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.2): So y'all listening to this Target commercial music???

**aestheticen** (2): Instead of feeling good, this makes me feel like committing first-degree murder instead

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): this is the most dejected sounding positivity anthem I have ever heard

**camerinian** (2): this is a mediocre song made worse by the fact that it was a hit during the shittiest part of 2020 and it was the last thing I wanted to hear.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i think my love for lalala came at the price of me hating this more

**whatsanillinois** (2): earworm in the worst way possible

**Hulnia** (1): ANOTHER song that’ll I’ll never get, those vocals are the fucking worst.

**jman457** (1): sorry ive never listened to this song by my own choosing

**nootnoot781** (1): why do i only get one 0 to use?

**sssaaage** (1): this was so close to getting my 0 its so fucking horrendous. they both sound HORRIBLE, the lyrics are fucking awful, the melody is horrible, the instrumental sounds so cheap it hurts

**Uberpigeon** (1): finally! a song to play while i hang up my live laugh love signs!

**wavingwolves** (1): lyrics are obnoxious and the beat sounds so cheap it actually makes me embarrassed for them

**xavieryes** (1): horrible

**hikkaru** (0): this song is SO obnoxious omfg

**ignitethephoenix** (0): you know what the instrumental is decent but this song is so fucking grating to me lyrically and with the singers voice.

**pig-serpent** (0): Most party songs invite the listener in in some way, shape, or form, which allows you to party along. These two smarmy douchebags lock the doors on you and brag from their balcony about how awesome their party is. Atrocious song.

**bee:** While all of the songs in this rate got popular thanks to Tik Tok, not all of them sound like a "Tik Tok song" in the way that this one does. In fifteen years, when we think back on music from the start of the '20s, we're going to think of songs that sound like this: dark, vibe-y, with a strong trap beat. Don's voice is special, too; the song wouldn't be good with his unique tone carrying the melodies and ad libs. 

This song (like many in the rate) is a grower - it's definitely not standard popheads fare, but I found myself bopping to it more and more every time I heard it. Personally I can't say that this genre of music is my favorite yet - probably in large part because I'm not very used to it yet - but I'm grateful to this rate that I got exposed to it more, especially because I firmly believe that it's a big and important part of "Pop" overall these days.

---

#head empty

**Hulnia** (10): The only song that actually sounds good slowed and reverbed, this was robbed on the charts (and probably will be in the rate).

**MrMoodle** (10): more hooks than can’t get you out of my head

**runaway3212** (10): I really love don tolliver's voice

**sssaaage** (10): BANGER

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the grip this dance had on the app in december '19

**xavieryes** (10): uh uh uh uh yeah, uh uh uh uh yeah, uh uh uh uh yeah

**ReallyCreative** (9): now why are the little moany sounds working so well

**ProfeNeuro** (8.2): This is great

**AHSWeeknd** (8): gets a little annoying but it’s alright

**Awkward\_King** (8): dni but the song fucks

**camerinian** (8): After Party would've been a 10, but I'll forgive the exclusion if we get capybara clips in the beatsense reveal

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): they did not do too much. in fact, they did just enough

**nt96** (8): I've only heard this song with the lowered pitch, so hearing the original for the first time threw me off 💀

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyopshW/

**bluepupz** (7.5): I think the breathy high pitched vocals in the chorus are great! The song overall is quite catchy.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Look I love Travis Scott so I should like this a lot but I feel like he’s just too much of a copy of him than I cannot care… I rather just listen to Travis

**bbfan132** (7): pretty good

**duochromepalmtree** (7): I wish they would’ve slowed the actual song down like it is on tik tok. Catchy and nice to listen to though.

**hephaestionline** (7): I thought Lemonade was the TikTok hit, but eh this was better

**skargardin** (7): bop

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): After Party is the better Don Toliver single, anyway fuck Don Toliver

**teenwitches** (6.5): i always feel like i did too much

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**arhmaer** (6): so sick of these two minute streaming songs omg

**cremeebrulee** (6): me when i need to get my friend nadia

**CrimsonROSET** (6): you are doing far too much

**throwaway7650** (6): nice production but I'm not giving don toliver a high score (kali sweetie I'm so sorry unless you're sticking with him like nicki with her man)

#head full... a bit too full

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): meh

**cheatviathan** (5): I don’t hate this, and the overuse of falsetto should be so much more grating than it is, but I can’t see why I should listen to this when other autocrooners do the same thing, but better.

**flibbityflob** (5): Again, fine production wise, it just does less than nothing for me.

**just\_thonking** (5): this does nothing for me

**kreddit2** (5): boring

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): Drugs n Hella Melodies was a better song than this and came dead last in the Hispanic Art Pop bonus rate so… he will flop and I can’t say I will feel sorry for him

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): kinda came and went, nothing super remarkable about it

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): It sounds nice? But other than that kinda forgettable

**intheaftermath** (4): was casually listening to this playlist and when I came back to write a review I could not remember a single thing

**pig-serpent** (4): I'm sorry but I still can't get over the fact that this guy is called Don Tolliver. Something about the name just feels off to me. Anyway, I'm not a fan of his singing and the beat is really cluttered.

**schwiftydude047** (4): honestly it just feels like so many other songs that it blends in too well.

**steelstepladder** (4): There was like 5 versions of this floating around Tik Tok at all times and all of them are better than the original

**2RINITY** (3): If those allegations about him from last month are true, we're not losing much of value by cancelling him

**qazz23** (3): Don't care for the vocals

**rslashpoopheads** (3): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**waluigiest** (3): why is this so messy

**seanderlust** (2.9): i hate the way his voice sounds sorry

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2.5): When I originally sent this in, I gave this one a 6.7 and actually wrote some nice comments about Don, but because of the recent accusations towards him I've decided to give it a 2.5 instead. I guess you could say I had "No Idea" what was coming hahahaha.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): i listened to this song 10 times while doing this rate and i immediately forget what it sounds like after it finishes ever time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): Bland trap. And no I'm not a trap-phobic pophead. Normalize calling out when trap is boring!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Ear garbage.

**jman457** (1): this song has like no personality to it

**plastichaxan** (1): this was nothing kali uchis break up with this man challenge

**stryxen** (1): sure the situation but also the song just isn’t good

**tinaoe** (0): this is just Not It

how did they get Carly Rae Jepsen and Enrique Iglesias on this remix 

This trend was FUN. It's definitely one of the most "Tiktok" songs on this list, if I can say so myself, and there's something so stupidly fun about this song. It's super easy to get inside your head, the production bops a little, and the song is just overall fun. I've overplayed it for myself, sadly, but doesn't stop it being fun!

---

#popped off when their girl gave them a little bit of lockjaw

**2dina3dworld** (10): shashasha is Tik tok’s version of “shy shy shy”

**95ztaehyung** (10): ashamed to say this was my most listened to song last year … i’m mentally ill

**Awkward\_King** (10): this goes so hard and for what ? does it need to

**sssaaage** (10): actually so good omfg.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): One of the best party songs

**wavingwolves** (9.9): the carly rae jepsen/enrique iglesias remix is a 10 btw

**aestheticen** (9): The Canada is certainly, very cold

**just\_thonking** (9): the Carly remix would've gotten a 10

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I also really like the remix with Carly

**steelstepladder** (9): Fuck it this is good

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this song is extremely straight but it goes off so hard

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): I'm not normally a fan of cheesy spoken intros that are outtakes from the studio, but this was cute and fit the song

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): this is catchy in the good way & y2k is a good producer. bbno$ is good here but i’m gonna never listen to him anywhere else

**akanewasright** (8): This man literally produced half of planet her. Because this song exists, Get Into It (Yuh) happened, and I will forever be thankful

**camerinian** (8): this song is a brainworm in the worst possible way, but the worm is telling me to give it a good score and there's nothing I can do about it

**IIIHenryIII** (8): This one is an 8, but this one is a solid 10: https://youtu.be/_tlO1Jlz9qY

**MrMoodle** (8): i only just found out that this song has a remix with carly rae jepsen and my betrothed enrique iglesias and THAT is a goddamn 10

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Pretty catchy hook, definitely won't be forgetting this melody. The remix with Carly and Enrique is really good too.

**ReallyCreative** (8): from the Canada never fails to make me CACKLE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this song is so fucking stupid i love it

**hikkaru** (7.5): the carly remix elevates this to a camp masterpiece but it's still rly catchy

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): but where is the Carly Rae remix

**stryxen** (7.5): i think i’ve cried to this song before actually

**cheatviathan** (7): The beat is basic in a compelling way, especially with the brief siren sound on occasion, that vocal melody is the catchiest thing in the world, and the way they pronounce “Canada” to fit the rhyme scheme is hilarious. It’s entertaining and enjoyable, though not transcendent.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): my weakness is the fact I like this song, but I prefer the Carly / Enrique version by far.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i really hated this song when it was first a hit, but now, idk its real catchy and just a stupid song that knows its stupid

**runaway3212** (7): This song isnt bad but the first part (aka the part that went viral) is definitely the best part

**seanderlust** (7): hmm. gonna have to do a "is this song actually bad or am I just old" listen through on this playlist I think

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoxmQY/

**2RINITY** (6): A mildly amusing shitpost

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): why did this get a remix with Carly Rae Jepsen of all people

**jasannn** (6): Idk how Carly ended up on the remix but she did improve it

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): didn’t think this song was longer than 25 seconds

**rickikardashian** (6): now that im listening to the original once again,,,, yeah carly and enrique iglesias were very random but made total sense as the features of the remix

**schwiftydude047** (6): this has a very fun vibe.

**whatsanillinois** (6): carly did it better

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I reluctantly raise my score by 0.5 time I listen to this song and mildly bop

#LALALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU

**throwaway7650** (5): all I can think of is mafuyu I'm sorry (WATCH GIVEN GAYS OR ELSE)

**flibbityflob** (4.6): there's like half a good song idea in here but the idea is not enough to last a 3 minute song. carly's remix is better.

**duochromepalmtree** (4.5): but there is something about songs like this. They are so bad but turn into such an ear worm!

**kreddit2** (4.5): boring

**GARjuna** (4): this beat drop FUCKS. He can't sing tho

**nootnoot781** (4): carly version > is also not good

**Uberpigeon** (4): there was a sound in this that made me think i was getting a skype call despite not using skype since like 2015

**vayyiqra** (4): enough songs with bad tuneless singing now

**waluigiest** (4): i can’t explain why this makes me so mad

**xavieryes** (4): this is much worse than i remember it

**bbfan132** (3.5): parts of it are ok but most of it is just not

**jman457** (3.5): sorry the Carly version outsold

**ProfeNeuro** (3.2): la de da de da de da de day oh

**bluepupz** (3): I just kinda tuned out mentally when I listened to this. The monotone singing is kind of boring.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): carly rae jepsen if you're reading this i'm in love with you and please contact me this thursday at 9pm when i am free here is my phone number call me when i am free at this thursday at 9pm when i am free

**hephaestionline** (3): fun fact: Lorde and saviour of r/popheads Carly Rae Jepsen is on a remix of this song!

**nt96** (3): Wished he could take the time to come up with a better melody or better lyrics….or better vocals.

**pig-serpent** (3): Nah. Some credit is due for an interesting sound pallet for a trap song, but the song itself? Nah.

**Roxieloxie** (3): besties,,,,,,,,,

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.9): Oh cool another Mac DeMarco-esque rapper. Heavy sigh. I'm not a chill girl, so can't relate!!!

**1998tweety** (2): carly and enrique tried to save this

**cremeebrulee** (2): this fucking sucks but so does does get into it (yuh) which y2k also apparently produced so i really shouldn't speak

**lost-ln-the-echo** (2): the vocals are just... so bad

**welcome2thejam** (2): Can't stop thinking about this song, which is not good, cause it's irritating me more and more every time I hear it

**Square\_Preparation55** (1.8): the lyrics suck, and the song is just not good

**my friend Ethan** (1.1): FUCK THIS

**AHSWeeknd** (1): Oof, this is… who would make such a bad song, I mean it’s incomprehensible.

**jsonphile** (1): you know there are a lot of songs that can use some nonsense syllables like lalala and actually make them sound beautiful and filled with emotion. This is not of those songs

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (1): how do I block somebody in real life?

**shhhneak** (1): TikTok really got these monotone men thinking they have a voice we need to hear.

**Verboten\_Prince** (1): Who allowed this song to be made? Shashasha? I rap my lyrics when I perform??? “THE” CANADA?????

**rslashpoopheads** (0): POOPY POOPY POOPY

Man, this song. I should hate it but I don't. Something about it is so intensely addicting and fun... which I guess is why it started to go viral on Tiktok! Most of the videos I saw of this song were just lip-syncing to the song because it's just *that* good and catchy, people were absolutely fascinated by it. I still occasionally see this video on my for you page to this day, its power and chokehold it has on Tiktok is still incredibly strong. Hopefully ElyOtto can follow up with another smash like this, but I'm pretty sure they're set for life either way!

#IMONASUGARCRASHIAINTGOTNOFUCKINCASH

**2dina3dworld** (10): Bathes are boring af. What else do you do but get wrinkly, be horny and cry?

**95ztaehyung** (10): my most listened song to this year 😭

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is a bad song, like this song is bad and deserves to do badly. bad song.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song has personally dragged me out of multiple potential breakdowns. It’s just so fun and silly and SAD. Feels like taking my medication.

**educationalmirror** (10): fun hyperpopy and kinda relatable

**hephaestionline** (10): I was so sure that this song would be hyperpop's first breakthrough into the mainstream. But alas, the GP was not ready.

**jman457** (10): feels like the little mermaid on acid

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): This song has no reason to be good but here we are

**xavieryes** (10): wish it were longer but still iconic

**slimboyfriend** (9.9): How can someone so perfectly encapsulate Gen Z internet cultural angst in less than a minute and a half

**camerinian** (9): hyperpop is dead. long live hyperpop

**GARjuna** (9): hyperpop??? could really see charli singing this

**Hulnia** (9): Okay, so about the 100 gecs wave being annoying...

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (9): get off Discord. go to sleep

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1G866/

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): fully thought i was gonna hate this after the first 3 seconds of the song but it's a bit of a banger!

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): we love the most successful hyperpop song of all time

**akanewasright** (8): camp

**runaway3212** (8): god I wish that was me

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): I kinda like it sorry

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): it's a bop but definitely a bit short

**throwaway7650** (7.5): good but sooo short. it's nice representation for hyperpop though imo! (also kim is really all over remixes of the songs in this rate huh)

**ProfeNeuro** (7.2): it gets annoying after a few listens, but hey, I’m giving bonus points to any song that revives the style of “To Be Continued” memes from a few years back, this one included.

**cheatviathan** (7): It’s as by-the-numbers as hyperpop gets, but by-the-numbers hyperpop is still fun enough for me. I’m a sucker for the contrast between sugary instrumentals and depressing lyrical content, so that also helps.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): when i tried to stan this so hard so this can be the first song by a trans artist to chart on the hot 100

**nt96** (7): lol is this 10 Gecs

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): okay but if Charli was singing on this exact same song y'all would... tank it in Sub Faves

**rickikardashian** (6.8): people had theories this was about drugs and addiction, but it truly is about eating a lot of sugar

**aestheticen** (6.5): What's the point if you're going to make a song this short? This is a whole interlude

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): okay, if a little bit baby’s first hyperpop

**Uberpigeon** (6.3): laura les' impact

**1998tweety** (6): well

**2RINITY** (6): When Mom says we already have 100gecs at home

**bbfan132** (6): 100 gecs-lite

**bluepupz** (6): This is so saccharine, I understand why this is called hyperpop. It is way too short though.

**inesmina** (6): this song gets in my head at 4am while I'm trying to sleep HELP!

**schwiftydude047** (6): why do I always forget how short this is?

**stryxen** (6): catchy but far too short

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): wait this is just serotonin… but slightly better

**flibbityflob** (5.7): why is a 12 year old rapping and saying the f-word. it's good but oh my god

**kreddit2** (5.5): kinda catchy but don't like their voice unfortunately

#100 gecs ripoff [1]

**plastichaxan** (5): this being the hyperpop that goes viral is my villain origin story

**sssaaage** (5): the instrumental bangs but the vocals are so..... i would eat this up if it had normal pitch vocals

**whatsanillinois** (5): mom, can we get 100 gecs? mom: we have 100 gecs at home. the 100 gecs at home:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.2): Not all hyperpop is good. It's very unoriginal and grating.

**arhmaer** (4): straight guys also shouldnt be allowed to listen to hyperpop. is this guy straight???

**qazz23** (4): Annoying vocals but at least it's short

**awhile2** (3): why do the shittiest hyperop songs get the most attention

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): as hyperpop songs go, this is bad

**jsonphile** (3): maybe someday I’ll understand this. At least it’s short

**pig-serpent** (3): I consider the genre bending as much as part of Hyperpop as I do autotune and blown out sub-woofers, so I find it sad that one of the biggest songs in the genre is such a blatant rip off of another artist's sound. It's 100 gecs - the noise and genre bending, right down to the melody sounding like something Dylan Brady would write. Kid, you have potential, you just really need to find your own sound.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): If "gec 2 ü" was hyperpop's Xbox 360, then "SugarCrash!" is its OUYA. Would've probably given it a 5 if it was the remix with Kim & Curtis.

**RandomHypnotica** (3): this is hyperpop in the most shallow sense of the word, it feels like a cheap parody that doesn’t really get the point

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I'd give this about 28 gecs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): ive taken pisses longer than this song

**welcome2thejam** (3): Simultaneously too long and too short

**AHSWeeknd** (2): I’m getting flashbacks to the video game rate

**banmoderator** (2): i know this isn't glitch gum but it is in that same camp of visceral hatred

**Brendon-Urine** (2): go listen to toothless by 100 gecs instead of this. pls

**cremeebrulee** (2): this SUCKS!!!!!

**hikkaru** (2): i hate u 100 gecs!!!

**steelstepladder** (2): Feel bad

**vayyiqra** (2): oh it's more 100 Gecs-lite shit too tired for this crap

**best-american-record** (1): oh

**CrimsonROSET** (1): this is like a sugar crash as in i have a headache

**IIIHenryIII** (1): I don't want to be that guy, but... this is not good, even if it's just a joke.

**MrMoodle** (1): why is all the hyperpop that blows up on tiktok fucking garbage it’s very upsetting

**my friend Ethan** (1): no.

**Roxieloxie** (1): i think im getting old [2] i hate the scissor sound in this so much

**shhhneak** (1): no <3

**TiltControls** (1): it's short, so that's nice

**Verrem** (1): did they really think the sound effects would add something to the music? (besides my desire to turn it off ASAP)

**waluigiest** (1): I point to this song as an example of hyperpop used as a crutch to replace artistic vision and creative talent, instead of as a tool to push genre boundaries

**matthewc20090** (0): didnt think i would use my 0 but i forgot THIS SONG IS SO ANNOYING

This? This is disrespectful. This placement is purely disrespectful. What you guys did to Pop Smoke was absolutely, 100% nothing but incredibly disrespectful. This was genuinely the most painful song to see get scored during the rate. This song is genuinely fun and such a vibe, plus the Tiktok trend attached to it is so funny. But man, some of the scores and comments this song got... 

Y'all suck.

#these ppl my lil boo thang 😚

**AHSWeeknd** (10): shoutout to a trap song that’s longer than two minutes and thirty seconds

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I cannot explain it but this song is addictive. The song I’ve listened to most from this rate. Nothing revolutionary but it just sounds so smooth!

**runaway3212** (10): idc this is immaculate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): me when G-Eazy raps about fucking without a rubber: ew nasty. when Pop Smoke does it: total bop, this is a 10

**Iris3271** (9.5): I know I'm almost certainly in the minority but the hold this song has on me is intense

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoqSgw/

**ProfeNeuro** (8.8): this song is also pretty cool

**akanewasright** (8.7): This kinda slaps but also wear condoms kids

**2RINITY** (8): RIP Pop Smoke, you should've lived to reign over NYC

**CrimsonROSET** (8): there is something very interesting about artists finding success in death that they never had in life.

**hephaestionline** (8): my demeanor is meaner than yours

**MrMoodle** (8): without the constant nutting this would be a 9

**TragicKingdom1** (8): major grower for me, i hope this subreddit grasps how much of a superstar Pop Smoke was poised to be

**just\_thonking** (7.5): tbh I like it

**flibbityflob** (7.2): i'm into this, honestly. just a good time. Maybe a little too long, but all the same, enjoyable.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): the way they talk about nutting on the covers without a rubber, and then nutting in a girl so she needs a plan b in the same song…just get a condom bro

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): probably my least favorite of the hits on this album but still not bad at all

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): nice smooth song

**HogwartsReject1912** (7): I made a TikTok to this that garnered some attention so it gets two extra points

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): the virgin line gives me the ick

**vayyiqra** (7): This guy says he fucks without a rubber, yet also says he doesn't want a baby. is someone going to tell him

**welcome2thejam** (7): The real mood swing is the sensual instrumental track combining with the continued use of the word "nutted"

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): [Shout out to that one guy who made a Sonic & Knuckles animation to this and managed to make Knuckles lip-sync the line "Shawty got the fatty".](https://twitter.com/ricfromsss/status/1321327251401723905)

**pig-serpent** (6): I like the mood of this song (heh) but overall it's just okay. The harmonies and lyrics aren't working for me, but man, the beat and Pop Smoke's voice are so good together.

**throwaway7650** (6): not really a fan of the lyrics for this one but it's not bad

#man y'all suck

**arhmaer** (5): this rules. men ain't shit

**jasannn** (5): Is this supposed to be sexy??

**kreddit2** (5): eh

**matthewc20090** (5): somebody get this man some water cause he's thirsty as HELL

**rslashpoopheads** (5): it's aight

**schwiftydude047** (5): yeah the title sums up my thoughts.

**steelstepladder** (5): Not quite what you know bout love levels of posthumous Pop Smoke missuse but this R&B style hip hop was not what he was known for or good at

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): the disconnect between the slow sad beat and the lyrics about cumming onto a girls bedsheets sdfvhbdsufjok

**ImADudeDuh** (4.5): the worst pop smoke song (besides the homophbic one) being the biggest hit...

**1998tweety** (4): nah

**cheatviathan** (4): Was never a fan of Pop Smoke’s R&B leaning cuts, and this is no exception. I don’t think I’ve heard anyone make the word “nutted” sound sexy, and he doesn’t even come remotely close to doing so. Lil Tjay’s contributions are okay, but not enough to elevate it for me.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Boring as hell.

**stryxen** (4): meh

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Why does a song with the words “Every time I fuck without a rubber I nutted on the covers” sound this soft

**slimboyfriend** (3.9): He nuts on her sheets without telling her...? And that's something he brags about

**BoneStreetSand** (3.5): OMFG JUST USE A RUBBER

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.2): I'm so sorry but this is not a Pop Smoke song that I like. But RIP, I like his other songs more.

**bbfan132** (3): not one of his best songs at all

**jsonphile** (3): ughhh I feel bad giving Pop Smoke and Lil Tjay such a low score when they are clearly more talented than so many other artists on this list, but….man these lyrics…gross

**sssaaage** (3): i like pop smoke a lot but his more pop songs are soooo

**Uberpigeon** (3): horny songs are only good when women do it

**veryanniev** (2.5): definitely sounds better than most of the other rap songs on this list but only if you pretend you can’t hear the lyrics

**bluepupz** (2): Why do they talk about nutting so goddamn much? The actual song is fine, and it reminds me of what was popular on the radio in the mid-00's, but the lyrics absolutely ruin this song for me lol.

**Verrem** (2): it doesn't actively hurt my ears so for that it gets an extra point

**waluigiest** (2): it’s so uncomfortable

**2dina3dworld** (1): this coming after Mayonaka no Door made my mood swing from happy to angry and my ears go from blessed to cursed.

**jman457** (1): RIP Smoke, but I keep looking at mood swings

**teenwitches** (1): did he just rhyme breasts with breasts

#this comment is....... not it

**celladonn** (0): The lyrics on this just gross me out so much. Sonically it's alright and I feel like I'd be fine with this song if it was in another language or something but as it stands I just find it repulsive

this is getting a ten because the thought of someone playing this at the club is too funny but I would also unironically turn up to this song 

The song that represents the sea shanty craze of the pandemic. Honestly, I think this remix is really fun and tongue-in-cheek which is part of why I chose the remix over the original. ~~The remix is also used more on Tiktok, so that helped too.~~ I knew this would get trashed, so I could care less about this placement, but it's not THAT bad like some of you guys are making it out to be!

---

#knows how to have fun, would get drunk with them

**schwiftydude047** (11): sea shanties are always so much fun to listen to and this remix exemplifies this.

**aestheticen** (10): This shit slaps hard as fuck. I do not care if this is supposed to be a sea shanty remix.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Dawn of Chromatica vibes 😍

**akanewasright** (10): I can’t lie this fucks

**astrologicalangel** (10): this slaps so hard it makes me wish I knew literally anything about sailing

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): because why not

**best-american-record** (10): this is the hype i needed from this list

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly sea shanties were not the worst trend represented in this rate and this proves it

**GARjuna** (10): FUCKS

**ImADudeDuh** (10): yeah this bops.

**pig-serpent** (10): If this was the sea shanty version instead of the dance one it would've gotten my 11 in a heartbeat. That said, it was still gunning for it.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): no question and was almost my eleven

**xavieryes** (10): an 11-worthy banger

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i literally just want to not like this for fuck sake

**seanderlust** (9.5): this is what they blared on the speakers of the krusty krab while cleaning the restaurant after close

**95ztaehyung** (9): innovative

**bigbigbee** (9): I really love the original shanty so I expected to hate this, but the dance beat got to me (love you Europe!)

**MrMoodle** (9): this is actually the dumbest fucking thing i’ve ever heard

**Roxieloxie** (9): This is a tech product review youtubers intro

**rslashpoopheads** (9): I love me a good sea shanty

**throwaway7650** (9): this sounds like a youtube parody [non-derogatory]

**Verrem** (9): at this point I will take anything that sounds different from all the landfill indie and trap rap

**ProfeNeuro** (8.5): Even though I enjoy this song more than a solid majority of the other songs on this list, this probably wins my “Worst Possible Song To Play Out In Public Should My Headphones Disconnect Award” for this list.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i really wish this smashed in the US just for the gag

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): gregorian chant trend when

**shhhneak** (8.1): titty.gif

**2RINITY** (8): BRB gonna go be a pirate

**cheatviathan** (8): I don’t know why sea shanties have made a resurgence in the meme economy. All I know is that we are living in the best timeline, because this Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag-type beat hit #1 in the UK, and it hits harder than Moby Dick.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): what the fuck?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This one goes HARD. Who knew sea shanties could be turned into club bangers?

**runaway3212** (8): This is terrible but also good?

**steelstepladder** (8): Wild how pirates were literal sea terrorists who would do horrible horrible things to people over the span of many many years and now everyone loves pirates. Makes me wonder if in 200 years the biggest song in the world would be the isis national anthem or something like that.

**flibbityflob** (7.9): Not the superior Wellerman, go check out the incredible version by Gordon Bok, Ann Mayo Muir, and Ed Trickett, but still very good.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): pirates but make them EDM DJ’s

**veryanniev** (7.5): No one is more surprised at this than myself, but I genuinely enjoyed this?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): i should really hate this for being such a gimmick but it works way better than it should

**1998tweety** (7): wtf am i listening to but why do i kinda like it

**2dina3dworld** (7): sea shanties but make it something basic kiwi girls would play at a party

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I usually hate remixes, but I kinda like this. Taking a few points though because it's too damn short. Also, this is the part when I say the original is a whole lot better. Just out of curiosity, I looked for it and it was surprisingly entertaining.

**jasannn** (7): its giving me Aviccii

**qazz23** (7): weird genre combination, it's fairly catchy

**skargardin** (7): bop i fear

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1fc7X/

**duochromepalmtree** (6): i have never heard this song before but it’s dumb and fun

**educationalmirror** (6): but it's catchy

**nt96** (6): twerks aquatically

**rickikardashian** (6): this remix does fuck a little but the sea shanty trend felt extremely heterosexual

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): i hated this trend but i'm such a sucker for house music ffs

**tinaoe** (6): did u know this man is getting played on german radio endlessly with a FUN. knock off song? no? good 4 u

**welcome2thejam** (6): What an age we live in

This is such a bop and I will not hear otherwise. Sure, it's derivative of its influences (i.e. 100 gecs), but it plays off those gimmicks WELL and really creates a fun, unique experience for the listener. Plus - I think "we broke up on Pictochat, crying on my DS" is one of the best lyrics ever written, genuinely. I think it's one of those songs that probably will be viewed as a microcosm of its time, but one of the good microcosms.

---

#WE BROKE UP ON PICTOCHAT CRYING ON MY DSSSSS

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song is the definition of generic gen z hyper pop. But this song is a shot of serotonin. “We broke up on pictochat, crying on my DS” scratches my brain in the perfect spot. I play this one a lot.

**hephaestionline** (10): so this is the first 10 that I didn't recognise prior; a hyperpop banger

**intheaftermath** (10): it's camp

**stryxen** (10): i can’t believe i still enjoy this so much after going through summer 2020

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyou96Y/

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): This song remains funny after each listen to props to that

**wavingwolves** (10): itz camp

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): this is gonna get absolutely robbed, and for what? If this was a 100 gecs track popheads would eat it up

**seanderlust** (9.7): it feels like the bubblegummy version of 100 gecs we saw in songs like ringtone, which is the side that i tend to gravitate towards/really love

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (9): can you tell I like 100 gecs yet? is it obvious?

**rickikardashian** (9): i love city pop

**sssaaage** (9): A SLAY IDC !!!!!

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): I can’t believe no ones ever tried to recreate pictochat. That platform had so much potential, that and you can draw shitty drawings and send them straight to your friends! I don’t know about you, but that sounds like fun!

**akanewasright** (8.5): The pictochat lyric boosted this score by a full point

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): This loud-ish, clipped, gecs pitched jam! Charli XCX come onstage!

**jman457** (8.4): Yeah I like cling clang music

**1998tweety** (8): maybe yall hyperpop hoes made a point or 2

**aestheticen** (8): Not bad... but I don't think I will add it to my library

**celladonn** (8): Hate to sound like a parody of myself but the 100 gecs remix outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (8): no because if anyone broke up with me over pictochat, i would be insanely depressed too

**schwiftydude047** (8): the fact that the song feels kinda robotic makes it that much better.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): laura les shout out in the lyrics we love to hear it!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.9): Definitely like it a lot more than "SugarCrash" that's for sure. The spoken-word bit just before the last chorus kinda dampens the vibe a bit - why does it sound like Peridot?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): the laura les shoutout caught me off guard

**2RINITY** (7): Anything that shouts out 100gecs and PictoChat can't be bad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): I don't hate this?

**thedoctordances1940** (7): the pots and pans beat has definitely run its course at this point but it's still a good song

**throwaway7650** (7): this is... fine hyperpop. some quirky lyrics but nothing special

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): It's really not bad. I kinda like it and it feels like a grower. I like the beat.

**pig-serpent** (6.5): For a second I thought this would be a hyperpop cover of Americ anFootball's "Never Meant" and this song is generic enough that I wish it was an Americ anFootball cover.

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): I think SugarCrash captured this particular vibe a little better but I'm surprised by how much I tolerate this?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): as far as hyperpop goes, this is kinda eh

**Brendon-Urine** (6): never heard the original, only the 100 gecs remix, which honestly improved this song a ton

**cheatviathan** (6): On the one hand, it’s cool to see hyperpop songs get traction on platforms like TikTok. On the other hand, the lyrical content on this one oscillates between corny and genuinely good every few lines, and the beat sounds like what you’d get if you typed “100 gecs type beat” into YouTube. Glitch Gum’s verse is pretty good, tho.

**nt96** (6): oMg HyPeRpOp

**teenwitches** (6): needs to put more hyper in the pop

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): was vibing with this until that spoken part took me out of it

**TragicKingdom1** (6): this would be better if it were more manic

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ahh hyperpop… equal parts cool and cringy

**welcome2thejam** (6): I'll give it about 50 gecs, plus an extra 10 gecs for the delivery of the "We broke up on Pictochat, crying on my DS" line

**Iris3271** (5.5): Great Value gecs

**flibbityflob** (5.3): it's a song! enjoyable, i guess, but probably not for me. The chorus/weird spoken bit sucks so much ass it kills me.

#100 gecs ripoff [2]

**apatel27** (5): annoying lyrics

**awhile2** (5): this is like the bootleg 100 gecs

**bluepupz** (5): This is a very... aggressive-sounding instrumental. The Picto-chat DS reference is interesting. I'm just kind of confused?

**hikkaru** (5): 100 gecs has done far too much damage to society

**Hulnia** (5): The 100 gecs clone wave was really annoying, this song just blends in for me to be honest.

**MrMoodle** (5): charli is right hyperpop is dead

**plastichaxan** (5): proof 100 gecs fucked up hyperpop cause why are they so great and then inspire this…

**Roxieloxie** (5): i agree my life would've been better if i never heard this song

**rslashpoopheads** (5): this is so generic it sounds like every posty clone song ever

**Uberpigeon** (5): the pictochat shoutout

**vayyiqra** (5): This is like 100 Gecs if they were listenable

**kreddit2** (4.8): feels like draft 1 of a charli xcx song + they don't have her charm

**camerinian** (4): hyperpop started to die when it started being filled with rote 100 Gecs mimicry instead of the bouncy experimentation it was founded on. The self-referential circlejerkery the genre (or, let's be real, the playlist) got filled with was exhausting. Glitch Gum is fun though, they can stay

**ProfeNeuro** (4): this song sure exists

**runaway3212** (4): ugh

**waluigiest** (4): no

**bbfan132** (3.5): the vocal runs sound horrible with the autotune lmao

**ignitethephoenix** (3): is this not a watered down 100 gecs song

**skargardin** (3): anyway!

**steelstepladder** (2.7): OMG I LOVE AMERICAN FOOTBALL!!!

**arhmaer** (2): budget food house music ass straight ppl shouldnt be allowed to listen to glitchpop

**banmoderator** (2): i have in irrational hatred for glitch gum

**jsonphile** (2): yeah I’m too old for this

**AHSWeeknd** (1): at least there’s some self awareness.

**CrimsonROSET** (1): this is like, 25 gecs

**matthewc20090** (1): autotune is gross

**Verrem** (1): fifty million people listened to this willingly

xavieryes: I was emotionally prepared to write a massive rant about this sub being xenophobic if Roses, Sudno, Hadal Ahbek, Stay With Me or Yoru ni Kakeru were eliminated today. But while several songs did get robbed, at least *that* didn't happen, so you're all cool. At least for now.

bluepupz: Wait goddamn it I literally just finished work and opened up Reddit, I can’t believe I missed Day 1 with all of its glorious controversy scores! I *will* be tuning in over the rest of the weekend though! I’m okay with the songs that went out today, though I am a bit surprised that I’d Rather Die came absolutely dead last lmao

duochromepalmtree: I gave 5 of today’s songs a score of 10 lmao. Not sure what that says about my taste level but it’s probably not good.

veryanniev: Maybe it's because I've never had TikTok, but to say I'm shocked by some of these placements would be a massive understatement. Like, some of these are not as bad as you're making them out to be.

hephaestionline: Ugh r/popheads confirmed homophobic for voting out SugarCrash! and NEVER MET! on day 1 (that or y’all just hate exclamation marks in titles; I guess we’ll never know 🤷‍♂️)
