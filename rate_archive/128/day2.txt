This song absolutely plagued Tiktok vlog videos for AGES. It still does. Which is why I chose the song as one of my selections! Honestly, I don't have much to say on this other than it IS a fun song and I will give him that, but I am kind of tired of the song overall and can easily move on from it. Not even Stauber's best song, either – nor his best Tiktok trend!

#animation majors, pro-art

**intheaftermath** (10): jack stauber's impact on the tween digital artist scene in 2017 >>>>>

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): the absolute gorilla grip hold this had on tiktok

**2dina3dworld** (9): Tik tok rate beats to study to

**educationalmirror** (9): vibes

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (9): JACK STAUBER⁉️

**schwiftydude047** (9): it reminds me of fun summer afternoons with my friends.

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): jack stauber make some more bangers please!!!

**jman457** (8.4): Such a breezy song, reminds me of like a Pavement/Ween song but for the modern day

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.2): I do like this a lot, a nice discovery for me!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): whenever I hear this song it makes me think of an acnh TikTok where someone tries to catch a tarantula and it goes horribly wrong. anyways this is a bop

**bigbigbee** (8): Should I dock points because I enjoy the version without his voice (from the froggy dance video) better? Maybe.

**GARjuna** (8): into this distorted shit

**MrMoodle** (8): this is either great or the most gratingly fucking annoying thing i’ve ever heard, i think a few more listens and i’d hate it but i’m gonna be generous for now

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): is it a good song or do i have good memories with it

**Roxieloxie** (8): idk whats going on here but i can vibe with it

**sssaaage** (8): it was the moment

**steelstepladder** (8): grooves

**welcome2thejam** (8): Kinda thought I'd like it more than I do? Still good, but I came into the rate thinking it was a 10, but found it never quite connected like that. That said, I adore that section with the sudden and brief switch to his normal voice.

**aestheticen** (7.5): It's chill

**bluepupz** (7.5): Something about this feels nostalgic, like I'm going on a car ride at sunset with the windows down. I like the instrumentals and backing music quite a lot, though I have no idea what they're actually saying.

**xavieryes** (7.5): my plan was to make some dumb joking here saying this is either as bad or better than the average Powerpuff Girls adaptation or something but i have changed the score for this shit so many times because i just cannot form a fucking opinion on this stupid song and therefore had to adapt the dumb joke accordingly and i am TIRED of doing that so FINE have a 7.5 and i do not want to think about this score or comment ever again.

**slimboyfriend** (7.4): vibes, beautiful vibes

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): this is still jack's best work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP9y7F_rzzo

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): it's okay

**BoneStreetSand** (7.1): It’s certainly a song.

**apatel27** (7): sounds like a mgmt reject

**banmoderator** (7): this is a cute one

**camerinian** (7): this guy really likes Talking Heads huh

**cheatviathan** (7): This instrumental palette is cool enough, and the sudden transition into a swing rhythm in the second prechorus is cool. The guitar and organ leads do have some cool moments to shine. I could do without that falsetto, and this sounds like something that would play in an iPhone commercial, but even iPhone commercials can slap sometimes.

**hephaestionline** (7): this does exude "I missed the summer of 2020" vibes

**just\_thonking** (7): cute but annoying

**kreddit2** (7): mildly disappointed this was not "build me up buttercup" but it's fine

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJEbkeL/

**rickikardashian** (6.8): the best jack stauber song to trend on tiktok was coffee and im mad it’s not on streaming

**1998tweety** (6.5): not a fan of the voice but the rest is good

**bbfan132** (6.5): parts of it are iffy, other parts are pretty good

**jasannn** (6.5): I didn't know this song had lyrics

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): do not have a clue of what is being said, but i kinda like it

**seanderlust** (6.4): I have absolutely no idea what this song is about but it's cute so i'll allow it

**hookerofpop** (6): it's cute

**jsonphile** (6): OH ITS THIS SONG I never knew what it was called. Anyway it feels more like a meme than a real song

**nt96** (6): its aight

**ProfeNeuro** (5.6): ohh it’s THAT song; eh, “crystal dolphin” is better and gets a nine from me.

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): literally what are you saying

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): this is definitely an indie song

**TiltControls** (5.5): starts off a bit weak, but picks up midway!

**jackisboredtoday** (5.4): build me up buttercup mops this

frogaranaman: #HATES animation, possibly anti-art

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this song has so many elements and i think about half of them work but the other half are awful and which is which changes everytime i listen to it

**duochromepalmtree** (5): it’s fine but I would never listen to it voluntarily. Would bop along if it came on while shopping in a Burlington coat factory

**pig-serpent** (5): My friends were showing me some other Jack Stauber stuff recently and it was pretty cool, I'm just having a hard time vibing with this one.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): it's aight

**teenwitches** (5): i like the remixes/mashups better

**flibbityflob** (4.5): It's like, fun! But do I like it? Nope.

**2RINITY** (4): I'm sorry, this'd be nothing without the TikTok trend

**avg-vag** (4): it's clear this was created for the purpose of internet background noise

**IIIHenryIII** (4): The bit used on the TikTok vídeos is the only good part of this song. The bassline is kinda nice, but the song just ain’t it.

**nootnoot781** (4): i can imagine this in a kia commercial

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): I like Peppermint better. Jack's stacatto vocal performance rocks tho.

**qazz23** (4): vocals are kind of annoying

**TragicKingdom1** (4): i expected this to be cheerier from the tiktok snippet

**vayyiqra** (4): This is not good because the vocals are awful and it sounds weak and tinny. 70s psychedelic nostalgia is not a good trend (sorry Tame Impala stans)

**thedoctordances1940** (3.5): this sounds really bad but I kinda see the appeal?

**AHSWeeknd** (3): Jack Antonoff would probably make songs like this in his reputation era.

**Brendon-Urine** (3): His sound gets so old so fast. This song started to infuriate me after hearing it ~3 times

**Square\_Preparation55** (3): the music is okay, but I can't tell if the artist is trying to sing actual words or just vocalizing, which really distracts from the rest of the song

**stryxen** (3): this takes so long to be bearable someone electrify my brain omg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i got this song recommended to me in a discover weekly on spotify when it had less than 10k plays and i thought “wow! this song sucks!” when i first heard it back then. and i still do!

**throwaway7650** (3): it's kind of groovy but those high-pitched vocals are some of the worst in the rate and there's some tough competition

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): That reminds me, I need to get new brake pads

**whatsanillinois** (3): most of these songs are so vapid jesus

**Saison\_Marguerite** (2.5): I know the album is called Pop Food, but why does he need to sound like he’s singing through a potato-quality mic? The Foundations outsold by far (ok maybe fuck Build Me Up Buttercup too after the Pop/Soul results)

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (2): Some of the production in this track, with the compressed sound and all, really reminds me of a fart, and the voice isn’t exactly getting a glowing review from me either.

**runaway3212** (2): I was surprised this was longer than 2 minutes and now I honestly wish it wasnt

**Verrem** (2): if Black Midi decided to do pop and was also bad

**my friend Ethan** (1): fuck this

**plastichaxan** (1): okay this is my first one cause this is one of the songs that have gotten the most annoying videos in that app which is fitting for an annoying song

#literally cannot hear this at all but god bless your soul

**wavingwolves** (1): if harry styles did lo-fi this is what it would sound like

**TK:** This is one of those songs that you can tell were going to smash from the very first listen. "New rapper gets a fluke hit with a song that's basically a freestyle" is not a new archetype (see: Shmurda, Bobby) but where Jack Harlow differs is that he has legitimate star power. He's above average in terms of skill and wordplay but it's his charisma and star power that pushes him over the edge. Compare him to G-Eazy: it's extremely impressive that he's confident in being a white rapper without coming off as a total fuckboy. Anyways, Jack Harlow is here to stay and I can't wait to read all the comments next year in the Billboard thread when he lands his first #1 and everyone who only listened to Industry Baby says "wait, he's good??"

---

#brand new whip, just  hopped in

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Jack Harlow goes off

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Jack is maybe the most charismatic guy out there

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this piano riff is so good. Jack also I think sounds great too and has great flow

**IIIHenryIII** (10): That's a banger.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): you know what, yeah. This is nice.

**xavieryes** (10): Shego’s fine as hell. I had a lot of cartoon characters that used to get me sexually aroused as a kid. She was one of them. The female reindeer from the Rudolph Claymation series. When I was in preschool, I used to be bricked up watching that shit and then that fine ass fish from Shark Tale. But Shego is up there, with her fine ass. I’m sensitive about my shit. That’s just how I am. So I think for me it’s a bigger thing cause a lot of my homeboys they’re weirded out when I tell him like I don’t like the deep throat. Really, it’s too much for me. A lot of girls have a very thin throat. It’s narrow. There’s not a lot of room to operate in there and they want to shove it back there and it’s like this is one of the most sensitive parts of my body and they just want to shove that shit. So for me, I’ve never liked intense head. I’d rather you just massage it. That was a reminder to myself because that’s one thing I’m not great at is being in the moment. I’m so forward driven and reflective that I be stuck between here. I’m trying to get better at doing this. It’s something I’m practicing. I don’t have no advice or anything to tell people because that’s what I’m trying to get on myself. But real talk, I do drink a lot of water. I’m very disciplined about wearing condoms. I’ve been really working on not getting too dense with my writing and just writing what comes to me right away. I say that greeting a lot when I run into people, when I’m on the phone. What’s popping? That’s just how I greet. So, now I feel like I can’t even greet people because I’m just playing myself out after this song. It’s what everybody’s associated with me as of late, so now when I greet people, it’s like “You really caricatured yourself, bro,” but that’s how I said it, so that’s why it was the first line, because it was conversation.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): forgive me roxie i can't make the music not bop

**MrMoodle** (9.5): now that jack has proven he is a friend of the home of sexuals are we allowed to admit this is really fucking good

**steelstepladder** (9.5): This song deserves better than where it's gonna place

**2RINITY** (9): Perfect introduction to Jack Harlow, definitely the right song for him to blow up with

**Awkward\_King** (9): he likes to serve

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the remix is a 5

**static\_int\_husp** (9): maybe men can be allowed to make music

**thedoctordances1940** (9): the beat is a smash

**TragicKingdom1** (9): given recent events he really lucked out getting the solo version in this rate

**BoneStreetSand** (8.6): Satin sheets? Yes please.

**camerinian** (8.5): Mom said we're allowed one white fuckboy rapper

**ProfeNeuro** (8.4): wuz poppin jimbo

**bbfan132** (8): this bops ngl

**best-american-record** (8): he’s definitely got better songs but you can’t deny this is good

**matthewc20090** (8): got old but still good

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): goddammit jack harlow

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1smx7/

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): sadly I have tested positive for having a crush on jack harlow. This song is dumb but I still bop

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.4): i also like girls that look like shego

**banmoderator** (7): bars were good tbh

**pig-serpent** (7): Good flow and cool beat, but by the time the song ends I'm ready to go weeks without hearing this song again.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): honestly this ain't bad

**waluigiest** (7): it’s better than I thought but not great

**welcome2thejam** (7): The "it does" aside made me laugh. It also made me look up the lyrics to that part on Genius and now I officially know one of Jack Harlow's sexual preferences, so I think I will take a break from this rate for a few hours

**flibbityflob** (6.8): it's like, good, i just don't like jack harlow all that much.

**bluepupz** (6.5): This has a nice beat, and I don't think there's anything particularly heinous in the lyrics so good enough for me!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): Jack's gotten better sorry but it's an aight bop.

**inesmina** (6.5): the piano and the beat are cute but the rest...

**jsonphile** (6.5): glad we went with the original and not the one with trump supporter Lil Wayne, woman shooter Tory Lanez, and DaHomophobe. I kinda feel sorry that Jack’s breakthrough hit was with these three guys who all did not have good PR these last couple years. Anyway, not a huge fan of this song, but I have liked other things I’ve heard from Jack Harlow

**seanderlust** (6.5): jack harlow reminds me of mac miller. we shall see if his stuff ages as well as mac's did.

**throwaway7650** (6.5): I think tyler herro is a pretty funny song but this is meh

**1998tweety** (6): meh

**aestheticen** (6): I prefer the remix way more

**akanewasright** (6): Every time I think of Jack Harlow, I think of that time Tinashe tweeted “I made [a bi anthem] with j\*ck h\*rlow, but he put C\*ris b\*own on it instead lol.”

**cheatviathan** (6): That piano riff in the beat is cool, I guess. I don’t think I’ve heard Sam’s Club referenced in a rap song, so that’s something. This isn’t really much of a song, and not something I’d actively seek out, but I wouldn’t complain if it came on. I prefer Harlow’s verse on the remix, but I’d also prefer to not give Tory Lanez my money.

**educationalmirror** (6): he has better songs but it's fine

**hephaestionline** (6): DON'T MIND ME JUST WATCHIN (is not actually the next lyric, I'm shook)

**Hulnia** (6): Like Party Girl, this is fucking generic as shit, but it’s still prettyfun. 

 The DaBaby and Lil Wayne versions on the remix don’t deserve to be as good as they are.

**kreddit2** (6): talented dudes but not my thing

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (6): Jack Harlow... lemme hit?

**ReallyCreative** (6): ehhh

**rickikardashian** (6): it brought jack harlow into the mainstream, which im fine with he seems cool, but this is just alright

**runaway3212** (6): Jack Harlow is so fucking hot makes me excuse this mediocre beat and flow

**schwiftydude047** (6): not the greatest thing ever but still really fun.

**vayyiqra** (6): Well that was a song that exists and was okay despite its very questionable features and absurd lyrics

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.7): Let me just say this: Thank fuck we're only rating the original.

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): tbh Industry Baby is better

frogaranaman: #old whip, did not hop in

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): He sounds like a full-of-himself frat boy. I liked Industry Baby but the more I perceive Jack Harlow, the more I'm annoyed.

**skargardin** (5): this really doesn't leave an impression on me idk

**apatel27** (4): lyrics are boring

**veryanniev** (4): meh

**TiltControls** (3.5): not this song

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): Jack is actually fine on this, but the beat is so annoying and repetitive I hate this so much

**nt96** (3): boy bye

**Uberpigeon** (3): its just BORING im sorry!

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Don’t let the Shego line distract you from the fact that Jack Harlow said he was sexually attracted to “The female reindeer from the Rudolf Claymation series”

**HogwartsReject1912** (2): This *would* get a 1 but I'm in love with that man so, extra point.

**sssaaage** (2): i hate this beat so much and jack harlow annoys me

**Verrem** (2): I'm not sure how representative the rap songs in this list are for modern rap in general, but I'm definitely not vibing with any of it.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): this is a jock anthem. that is not a good thing

**jman457** (1): Other than him being kind of cute, this song is kind of bad

**nootnoot781** (1): there are so many 0 contenders omg. that being said he’s kind of ho-

**plastichaxan** (1): god why do all the songs by men sound the same can you come up with something else

**Roxieloxie** (1): I did everything in my power to stop this from being in the rate and yet,,, my biggest enemy is me 😔😩 pop a 9-1-1-🚨👁

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): idk know anything about jack harlow but his verse on industry baby sucks so im giving him this score to spite him for that

**GARjuna** (0): good god he's boring

Honestly, this song knows its job and does it just fine. It's catchy, it's easy to make dances to, there's enough content in it to make memes to. Really fits quite well into that Tiktok hit model. I think it's a fun song and have had enough fun memories while this song was in the playlist to give it a decent score, but I mainly upped it to a 10 to be edgy and cool and a contrarian to the rest. 

~~and also this is a song on the "misogyny that slaps" playlist my friend group built one night which is honestly just a fun meme lmfao~~

---

#ALL THEY WANNA DO IS PARTY ALL NIGHT

**akanewasright** (10): Wait I remember listening to this years ago and thinking it was bad? But it’s actually good? Wow I hate all of my old opinions so much. By the time this rate gets revealed I’ll probably rate some of these opinions too, to be quite honest.

**Awkward\_King** (10): joke about reddit user roxieloxie

**CrimsonROSET** (10): you didn’t have to put on that dress tonight

**IIIHenryIII** (10): It's so catchy. I need it for the serotonin.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): im bitches

**xavieryes** (10): hated it at first for sounding like the most generic pop-rap song possible, with melodies taken from several other songs, such as rockstar, God's Plan, and I'm the One, but it ended up growing on me out of nowhere and now i love it. it's just too catchy.

**aestheticen** (9.5): I don't care! This is good!

**just\_thonking** (9): this is the platonic ideal of a tiktok song

**rickikardashian** (9): yes it might be stupid but i’m not a smart man and i like songs with basses that go bmmm bmmm bmmm bmmm bmmm

**Roxieloxie** (9): I hate this song so much, the track is so nice but the song itself is so fucking obnoxious. I remember the late 2019 period where i was trying to win jingleball tickets and thus was forced to hear this on the radio which means i know every word to this song against my will. also whenever people call me roxanne on discord this song instantly gets stuck on my head which i hate but its fun in a very corny way

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): it's catchy what can I say

**TragicKingdom1** (9): misogyny never bopped so hard

**BoneStreetSand** (8.5): I don’t know if I’m supposed to enjoy this as much as I do tbh

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): it’s impossible not to like this song. It’s catchy, happy, and reminds me of life before we were living through a global pandemic.

**MrMoodle** (8.5): i wanna hate this but the hook is undeniable

**95ztaehyung** (8.2): this will prob be out day 1 but u all just hate fun

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): This song IS a banger.

**jasannn** (8): This gets some points for having an incredibly catchy chorus.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): a bop

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): for 2.5 minutes, I became a straight white cis man

**pig-serpent** (8): I love the hook of this song but there's very little substance here and I expect in the next few months to a year I'm going to get really tired of this and never listen to it again.

**ProfeNeuro** (7.8): i really like this song, and not even in an ironic way

**matthewc20090** (7.5): this guy has some KILLER beats. insane hook, passable verses. super simple but its catchy as FUCK.

**bluepupz** (7): Another song about a party girl, but the chorus is very sing-along-able at least.

**cheatviathan** (7): This feels like a more successful attempt at what “Party Girl” was trying to do, if only because the vocal performance is more melodic, the beat is hot, and there’s a genuine pulse to it.

**hephaestionline** (7): all for the 'gram

**HogwartsReject1912** (7): Too much autotune but he's hot so I'll excuse it

**nt96** (7): Did you tell her she don't have to put on the red light?

**schwiftydude047** (7): the only Roxanne that comes to mind here is the one from a Goofy movie.

**skargardin** (7): god this earworm

**slimboyfriend** (7): I like it because it's very Rich Girl by Hall and Oates

**stryxen** (7): ok it’s a bit of a bop

**teenwitches** (7): this is catchier than it has any right to be

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf16jkB/

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): this is listenable but arizona zeros is a noxious presence. an asshole maybe, but not a player

**GARjuna** (6.5): why did I think this would be the moulin rouge one.....

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): stream the superior Roxanne sung by Only Murders in the Building star Sting

**jsonphile** (6.5): mildly catchy. Police outsold though

**flibbityflob** (6): Yeah, you know what? I vibe. Not as good as the best Roxanne, from moulin rouge, but still good!

**hikkaru** (6): this is rly catchy but i'm a bit sick of it

**sssaaage** (6): i thought i hated this beforehand but its a bop .... the chorus still sucks tho

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): this is the whitest hip-hop song I have ever heard

#never gonna love me but it's alright

**1998tweety** (5): erm no, the lyrics aint it

**2dina3dworld** (5): catchy, but otherwise overplayed.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): ROOOOOCKS! (link it to this video will ya: https://youtu.be/GInovXm59Ew)

**shhhneak** (4.4): Never heard this song as long as it was on Billboard and I truly thought it was a cover of The Police by a TikTok girl.

**arhmaer** (4): bitches wanna be jacek koman smfh

**banmoderator** (4): i know too many straight ppl that love this song for some reason

**bbfan132** (4): bores me quite a bit

**ReallyCreative** (4): girl if she's bothering you that much just start with Mudkip or Treecko or catch a fucking Shroomish. You're really thinking Torchic can carry you in a rock gym? Delusion

**Uberpigeon** (4): oh.. this is not the The Police song...

**vayyiqra** (4): "bitches love the 'gram" wow deep

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Is it bad that I kinda wanna put this guy and the Tramp Stamps in a cage match and see what happens

**steelstepladder** (3.8): I'm gonna watch Moulin Rouge now

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3.5): hot take: this is still better than The Police’s song

**2RINITY** (3): Giving Roxanne permission to put on the red light, because this shit needs to stop

**ImADudeDuh** (3): skull

**plastichaxan** (3): men serving nothing as usual

**TiltControls** (3): You don't have to put on the red light. oh wait wrong song

**camerinian** (2): if "bro who thinks OnlyFans banning sex workers was super funny" was a song.

**kreddit2** (2): song is somehow tiring to listen to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): im trying so hard to not give every single generic rap song in this rate low scores so i dont get accused of sabotage but its so hard to listen to this

**throwaway7650** (2): don't like this at all lord, it's barely catchy enough to not be a 1 but the autotune is horrendous and I can't stand the atrocious lyrics

**AHSWeeknd** (1): a zero contender

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): This song oozes toxic masculinity lmao. I'm good luv!!!

**Hulnia** (1): The fact I loved this songs is so fucking baffling and embarrassing, what a stain on my last.fm. 

 The most annoying, generic, “hip-hop” of it’s time, and it was overplayed to shit in my friend group song.

**my friend Ethan** (1): (clown behavior)

**qazz23** (1): Hate the vocals, sounds generic

**runaway3212** (1): Goddamn Roxanne I wish I was dead

**jman457** (0): Like a mix of every shitty tik tok music trend, also the Police outsold!

This song literally has like four different trends attached to it at four different points in the song (my favorite one being where you hold in a hit of your pen and then sign the lyrics lmao), and for that I must simply call out its iconic-ness as it is. Plus, Fousheé is easily one of my favorite singers to find success on the app as her discography is quite good in general. I adore this song to death, it's just so good.

---

#likes swimming in the deep end

**nt96** (10): Reading her success story is truly inspiring. I love this.

**qazz23** (10): Favorite discovery so far

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Foushée knows something about rolling down in the deep, Masked Wolf is shaking

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.8): This was a big surprise for me, I hadn't really checked out Foushee yet. I like the somber and melodic R&B quality of this song. I'll definitely keep an eye out for her!!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Doja Cat and Tinashe had a baby and she wrote this song

**runaway3212** (8.5): my teenage emo era is coming through with my scoring im sorry

**akanewasright** (8): WAIT THIS IS THAT THING REMI WOLF REFERENCED IN QUIET ON SET OKAY I UNDERSTAND THAT NOW

**pig-serpent** (8): Ooh that faster section? Damn. Also multiple sudden genre shifts eyes

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This is pretty nice. I'm glad we're rating Fousheé's original instead of the Sleepy Hallow version. Out of all of the various EDM remixes of "Deep End", I'd personally recommend SIDEPIECE's remix of the John Summit version; Ronpasso's reworking of Fousheé's original comes second place.

**schwiftydude047** (8): there’s some pretty solid beats in this.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoDkvs/

**TragicKingdom1** (8): it's really impressive how this spawned two separate trends

**bluepupz** (7.5): Her voice is lovely, and I like the backing track as well. I sound like a broken record in a lot of my comments, but the length of these songs are killing me lol.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7.5): "I've been trying not to go off the deep end" is such a deep end diver thing to say

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Quentin Tarantino would enjoy the cover art.

**banmoderator** (7): i actually really liked the rap section in this song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i really like her singing voice but the whisper singing kinda ruins?

**jasannn** (7): The tik tok hook is actually the worst part of the song.

**Roxieloxie** (7): why is she whispering

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): it felt like it was about to go somewhere, but never did. enjoyed it for the most part though!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I think me and this song got off on the wrong foot… especially considering the first time I heard it was on my local alt radio station, and whenever I hear anything on that station that isn’t even remotely rock-sounding my inner boomer comes out. But no, this is pretty smooth and chill!

**kreddit2** (6.8): her voice is pretty and unique!! but the song is only okay......

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this exists

**aestheticen** (6.5): I can definitely see why the TikTok kids like this

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I kinda like this, but the chorus is way disappointing.

**throwaway7650** (6.5): don't like her singing voice but nice rapping and lyrics

**apatel27** (6): the chorus is bad

**arhmaer** (6): fousheé are you free for dinner this thursday night-

**bbfan132** (6): it’s fine

**camerinian** (6): Sorry this is one of those songs I just can’t see as anything other than a TikTok sound. It’s a few good hooks but all of them are so self-contained that it’s hard to see it as a whole package.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the tik tok famous part triggers fight or flight for me for some reason

**intheaftermath** (6): I can't hear this without thinking about the one girl who falsified ASL to this song for the aesthetic

**just\_thonking** (6): it's nice but I feel like it's missing something

**ProfeNeuro** (6): kinda like Khaby Lame, this is cute for like the first few times you stumble upon it. also like Khaby Lame, it gets annoying really quickly after that.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): spoopy

**vayyiqra** (6): I was hoping this would be "deep end" by Lykke Li which is a great song but this is okay too

#prefers the shallow end

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): eh, not very memorable

**Brendon-Urine** (5): I've been trying to find this song for so long omg omg THANK YOU! it ended being meh but that hook got stuck in my head and I never knew what song it was

**cheatviathan** (5): Foushee’s voice has a unique raspiness to it, but it does little to elevate an otherwise mediocre song.

**duochromepalmtree** (5): this song is just so boring to me

**plastichaxan** (5): please this is so dramatic and for what

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i really dont like whisper vocals

**Uberpigeon** (5): its flat for me

**jman457** (4.5): a bit forgettable

**flibbityflob** (4.2): again, fine, slightly more to my taste than Daisy 1.0 but not actually that good. Aggressively boring, more than anything.

**2RINITY** (4): Whether it's the original or the freestyle, it feels undercooked. There's something here, but it needs more on the low end

**steelstepladder** (4): A slight vibe but I will never listen to this song ever again.

**stryxen** (4): this is soooo

**thedoctordances1940** (4): it's just sooooo

**ImADudeDuh** (3): *insert Shallow joke here*

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): this is just so dull? Like the music itself is just so boring? Also not a fan of the whisper singing parts

**rickikardashian** (3): when i hear this song i can only think of that girl that dressed like a clown and would speak gibberish in ASL to this song

**xavieryes** (3): the beginning is just horrible, but it gets slightly better in the second half. i just can't stand the whispery vocals.

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): girl if it bothers you that much just stay in the kiddie pool, my god

**hephaestionline** (2): ehh you can recognise which part of the song is the TikTok audio

**teenwitches** (2): a mess of like 3 different song ideas all mashed together

**2dina3dworld** (1): hearing this again nearly made me go off the deep end

**my friend Ethan** (1): fuck this

**sssaaage** (1): no bc this song is actually so fucking bad how did it become a hit

**wavingwolves** (1): i can't explain why i hate this but it makes me want to take off my ears and shake them

What an absolute classic Tiktok hit! The idea behind it is simple: start the video with a timer, start running away from your phone for 25s, then right at the last second stop in your place and do a lil dance. It's simple but absolutely instant serotonin, and honestly impressive for how far away from the camera some people can get in that short amount of time. It's probably one of my favorite classic Tiktok trends and I think of this at least twice a week it's the purest thing to ever happen to the app and fuck every single one of you that hated on this.

#loves new years

**2dina3dworld** (10): this reminds me of the best time of my life, and now I’m emo because I never got to do a Chinese New Year Tik tok on my friends deck

**Awkward\_King** (10): thank u frog

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.2): so cute

**hephaestionline** (9): "I missed the summer of 2020" vibes

**stryxen** (9): last year this would have been my 11 its cute

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJEWgof/

**wavingwolves** (8.9): imagine i'm doing the little dance

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): cute!!

**jman457** (8.3): What’s shitty about a lot of bedroom pop is that blows up on this app it feels like no effort was put into the song. This is one of the rare exceptions (even though SALES have better songs)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): what youtuber uses this as their fucking intro because i know i’ve heard it before but ‘chinese new year sample’ is terrible to search

**matthewc20090** (8): super underrated but its a bopppp

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): strawberry shortcake mf popped off

**nt96** (8): makes me feel like I'm a middle schooler skateboarding in the suburbs at sunset. Very chill and nostalgic.

**qazz23** (8): Pleasant indie pop

**Roxieloxie** (8): i forgot this existed help

**schwiftydude047** (8): I can totally relate to wanting to get out of this lonely midwestern town.

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**pig-serpent** (7): Fine song. I absolutely see why this song would take off, just not my frequency.

**steelstepladder** (7): This is fun but it kinda peaks in the first 30 seconds

**Uberpigeon** (7): i was waiting for the banging chorus but it never came. Its cute though!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): In some ways this is another slight indie-ish song. But I think this song is charming enough, definitely a sweet 90's sound.

**GARjuna** (6.7): it's cute idk

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): it's fine

**bbfan132** (6.5): i do like her voice and the instrumental… it’s just that her singing is totally off

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): cute but doesnt do much for me

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): it's cute

**2RINITY** (6): OK seriously why does TikTok love car commercial indie rock so much

**aestheticen** (6): This dance on TikTok makes me a little bit sentimental of pre-COVID days...

**avg-vag** (6): i want to hate this but i can’t

**cheatviathan** (6): Fine enough. Pleasant to the ears, but not memorable. While other songs in this rate remind me why I fell in love with indie rock, this reminds me why I burnt out on it.

**duochromepalmtree** (6): I do not like this song but the hook is absolutely infectious.

**jackisboredtoday** (6): listenable, i guess. I don’t like that voice much at all but I almost forgot i was listening to it so it could be worse

**vayyiqra** (6): Avocadies Episode III but it's alright and I don't think it's racist like one might think at first

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): There are a lot of singers on this list with very… interesting voices, aren’t there?

**welcome2thejam** (6): A pretty decent indie rock type tune. Diggin the sound of the guitar, and the voice is growing on me.

**bluepupz** (5.5): I don't really like this singer's voice that much. It feels like a nice indie pop song that would be played at a coffeeshop.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5.5): her voice sure takes some getting used to, and this kind of jaunty indie is hit or miss for me, but it has a real tenderness behind it that I can appreciate

#hates new years

**thedoctordances1940** (5): i kinda like it but it's also irritating

**TragicKingdom1** (5): it's important to remember that some of these songs trended for being literal background music

**ProfeNeuro** (4.6): Be sure to mark your calendars for 1 February 2022, for it is the Chinese New Year.

**slimboyfriend** (4.1): I HATE the vocals on this hook. Other than that, I'd be all over this sound.

**AHSWeeknd** (4): oh this is that song?

**bigbigbee** (4): They had to call it Chinese New Year because if they just called it New Year if you searched “New Year Sales” you’d just get a bunch of ads and Google would label you a big fat capitalist on the back end

**celladonn** (4): I'm not really feeling her voice

**IIIHenryIII** (4): There is a part that I sincerely enjoy, but it lasts so short.

**just\_thonking** (4): it's a cute song but I REALLY can't stand their voice

**kreddit2** (4): her voice is annoying and i feel really bad for saying that

**sssaaage** (4): audience

**waluigiest** (4): me in 2017 would have eaten this up

**throwaway7650** (3.5): production is alright but were the vocals off-tune on purpose? also the song title gives me war flashbacks to alison gold :soobcry:

**cremeebrulee** (3): FUCK THIS SONG!!!!! MY ROOMMATE MADE ME DO LIKE 15 TAKES OF ME SWEEPING ON A BROOM FOR A TIKTOK TO THIS SONG THAT ONLY HER 4 FOLLOWERS WOULD SEE!!!! WTF!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (3): I can’t wait … to never hear her voice again

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): the music itself is okay, but the singer's voice is just so grating to me...

**rslashpoopheads** (3): this is exactly the kind of song that made me think I hated indie music for 10 years

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2.5): Eh, doesn't really do anything for me. The artwork for the song reminds me of Hopeless Fountain King for some reason.

**flibbityflob** (2): uhhhhh why is this vocalist so terrible. The guitar sounds nice but I am in PAIN listening to this vocal melody.

**xavieryes** (1): boring song with dreadful vocals

**runaway3212** (0): What did the Chinese ever do to this singer to give them a song like this

I only chose this song so I could fucking dunk on it for a bit

Man, this song is incredibly annoying. The version that went viral on Tiktok is, unsurprisingly, slowed + reverb'd to death which makes it at least a *bit* more bearable, but obviously that is not the one on streaming. It is an earworm, I will admit, but quite hoenstly... at what cost? It's funny, there is a dance remix of this song (because of course there is) and I actually find that song quite fun in a "why not" kind of way. But the original is just... blegh.

The Tiktok trends were also fucking boring.

#likes the OG

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is cute

**akanewasright** (10): wait this bops

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): Arabic is such a beautiful language to me. Idk what he's saying but I don't care.

**seanderlust** (10): this is so charming and sweet!

**xavieryes** (10): really nice and catchy. 11 contender tbh

**Brendon-Urine** (9): always shook at the random songs that blow up, never heard any of this but it's very nice!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): montage music (compliment)

**duochromepalmtree** (9): I have no idea what he’s saying but this song is GORGEOUS. I hadn’t heard the whole song until now and now I am obsessed.

**jasannn** (9): Is this song you know... 😏?

**tinaoe** (9): this is just pleasant in the best way

**bigbigbee** (8.5): It’s a little bit clown-y (like there is basically ONE drumbeat in this and it barely lets up through the whole song) but the tune is sweet and cute and his delivery is nice.

**nt96** (8.5): Very fun song!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.3): This is such a BOP, I love it!

**apatel27** (8): slowed version on tiktok sucks

**matthewc20090** (8): catchy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoJnwE/

**throwaway7650** (8): very cute song, bonus half a point for the great single cover

**1998tweety** (7.5): alright

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i like it but if i have to be honest it sounds like an ed sheeren song in arabic

**jman457** (7.3): Cute bop, also FREE PALESTINE

**aestheticen** (7): I do not hate this

**banmoderator** (7): had never heard this one before but it was solid

**best-american-record** (7): the lyrics are great and i like the song, but it gets a bit repetitive towards the end

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I kinda dig this? It sounds so cute and very sweet. (I'm not gonna look for the translation to this because it might change my perspective. I hate cheesy lyrics, and I'm pretty sure this song is cheesy as hell). Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Ra-Pa-Ra-Pa... Damn it, this shit is addicting!

**ProfeNeuro** (7): I don’t understand a word he’s saying but I really like the instrumental.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I'll give this one points for being a real song and over 3 minutes long

**runaway3212** (7): This is cute in a very first love kind of way

**schwiftydude047** (7): the piano transitioning to the drums is really satisfying.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): it's kinda cute plsss

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Wait this is the song that’s super slowed-down on TikTok? Why would they do that? How rude lol

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): it’s cute but doesn’t stand out

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): it's cute but not as cute as some of the other cute songs

**GARjuna** (6.7): that one bollywood song that prays as the heroine leaves temple to walk around the neighborhood

**bbfan132** (6.5): pleasant!

**bluepupz** (6.5): The lyrics are very classic love song, but I do like his voice. The ra-pa-pa-pa-pa-pas are a little monotonous, but it's a cute song overall.

**flibbityflob** (6.3): god, Arabic is such a pretty language. Really like this one, actually, or maybe my standards are just extremely low.

**stryxen** (6.1): cute but it got very boring

**AHSWeeknd** (6): is this indie Russian music?

**cheatviathan** (6): It’s fine for what it is. What it is isn’t something that I would actively seek out, and there’s nothing about it that grabs me, but I wouldn’t complain if you put it on.

**hephaestionline** (6): okay so I thought I didn't recognise this one but TikTok just likes their ~slowed down~ audios

**kreddit2** (6): also boring but his voice is nice

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): it’s cute but why do I feel like I’ve heard this song in a hundred commercials despite it being new to me

#prefers the slowed n reverb'd version

**2RINITY** (5): Cool that a song in Arabic blew up, but that's the only thing really sticking out to me about it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): another song that's just not that memorable

**cremeebrulee** (5): its giving arab laxed siren beat

**intheaftermath** (5): I didn't realize this song wasn't in English and the reverb really made me think he was singing about his headband like Rachel Berry or something

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (5): chill bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): There's a few moments where the song actually starts to get good, but they get immediately cut off with that silly "ba ba-da ba-da ba" hook. The R3HAB remix of this is somewhat better.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): it's really cool to see a song sung entirely in arabic being wildly popular in the west, but the production sounds really REALLY cheap and the song itself just feels like a Jason Mraz song with a watered down hook

**rickikardashian** (4): this is actually pretty nice but the slowed-down sound that actually went viral on tiktok is genuinely the most infuriating thing ive ever heard, and now because of it, issam alnajjar will have to pay

**pig-serpent** (3): The singing is nice but this is not my kind of corny, and the verses are boring af.

**Uberpigeon** (3): its a shame because he has a nice voice but this sounds like vlogger 5minutecrafts music

**camerinian** (2): I don't speak a word of Arabic, but going off the sound of this song, I'm gonna guess the lyrics translate roughly to "Ask your doctor is Cialis is right for you"

**sssaaage** (1): crickets

#HELLO??????????

**wavingwolves** (1): i'm sorry but it sounds as if this singer is being held at gunpoint and being forced to sing this. i'm worried

#it's time for the twerkulator...........

**AHSWeeknd** (10): goes off

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is iconic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if this was longer it would easily be my 11

**sssaaage** (10): so fun i love it sm, was almost my 11

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): oh this is fun

**cremeebrulee** (9): i know tierra whack is shaking rn

**nt96** (9): I would've gave this an 11 if it wasn't so damn short. Honey I don't slut drop to snippets.

**plastichaxan** (9): nooo it's too short this would be a 10 with an extra minute or so

**static\_int\_husp** (9): I know this only from the video of the Google twerking and for that it gets a high score

**teenwitches** (9): the little duck and whip noises really make this one

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1sb5Y/

**wavingwolves** (9): this is so good actually

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.9): God DAMN this beat goes off! I love the music video too. Another short song but eh, what can you do?

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this laid out the blueprint for have mercy, we are all aware of that right

**GARjuna** (8.5): this beat is incredible

**jman457** (8.3): this just sounds like pure serotonin, if ths were longer it might be an 11

**best-american-record** (8): would rate higher if it was longer obviously

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if we sent this to indieheads they would instantly understand what the slut drop is

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): one time, I played only this song on the car ride home. it was a 20 minute drive. I basically played this song 15 times in a row. bitch was running on the hamster wheel

**Roxieloxie** (8): the way this rate has managed to bring up mundane early 2020 pre lockdown memories from being on campus is actually insane to me

**slimboyfriend** (8): this song has one good line but that line is SO GOOD

**throwaway7650** (8): the 3 extremely short songs under 1:30 would really sound great in a mashup huh (wait let me go create that with rave.dj rn)

**welcome2thejam** (8): The "If I Back It Up" duck is up there with the likes of the Collective Soul cat and the Run Away With Me saxophone seal in the "animals set perfectly to music" genre top tier

**2RINITY** (7.5): This shit probably has New Jersey going crazy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): I may be getting the sub-genre wrong, but this is giving me Jersey Club vibes. I'm not mad at it!!

**flibbityflob** (7.4): more of this chill vibe stuff, i cannot overstate how into that i am.

**arhmaer** (7): WHY IS THIS SO SHORT ITS SO CUTE

**bbfan132** (7): it’s p good sonically

**duochromepalmtree** (7): barely feels like a real song but it gets me hyped up every time so

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): Cute snippet!

**jackisboredtoday** (7): i like this but it feels like… a quarter of a song

**jasannn** (7): Some points for knowing when a song should be a short.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): why is it so short :(

**vayyiqra** (7): Not sure why because this is the kind of ultra-repetitive song I'd normally hate but I kind of like this

**camerinian** (6.5): I'm just glad TikTok is bringing breakbeats back into vogue. There's nothing more to say about this

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**bluepupz** (6): This has some cool elements, but this is too short for me.

**just\_thonking** (6): is this an interlude

**schwiftydude047** (6): this is way shorter than I expected.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): we as a society need to STOP making songs that are less than 2 minutes long especially songs that couldve been super catchy and enjoyable if they were stretched to a normal length like this one!!!

#StReAmInG eRa HaS rUiNeD sOnG lEnGtHs

**apatel27** (5): way too short

**cheatviathan** (5): This is the audio equivalent of someone submitting a rough draft as a final draft. There are some interesting ideas here. In particular, I’d be eager to see what a more adventurous hip hop act can do with those bedspring creaking samples. But here, they never coalesce into a legitimate whole, something with actual form or structure.

**kreddit2** (5): nothing much to say

**pig-serpent** (5): This is a minute long build up for a drop than never comes. It's musical blue balls, if you will.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): ok

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Those crow sounds give me bad flashbacks to mornings where I would be woken up at like 5 in the morning by crows outside my window and I would get so mad that I’d go outside armed with tennis balls and throw them at the trees, hoping to scare them away. Other than that the song is okay

**aestheticen** (4): These songs are so short, I don't even know what I am supposed to listen to

**bigbigbee** (4): This was stuck in my head once and I started singing it out loud, and my friend immediately put her hand on my arm and said, “Stop.”

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I still don't get it. This was my 0 originally, but this shit kinda grows on you?

**seanderlust** (3.3): this stresses me out

**Square\_Preparation55** (3.3): this feels like a song that was made specifically with TikTok in mind

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): I'm sorry but this is way too short to be memorable

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): at least it's short?

**matthewc20090** (3): idk what this song is trying to accomplish

**runaway3212** (3): I have no idea what's happening and I hate it

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3): it was apparently only 84 seconds long but truly felt like 10 minutes

**ProfeNeuro** (2): should this even count as a song? And this coming from someone who lowkey enjoys “bmbmbm”

**whatsanillinois** (2): this is what that high school student on the bus wearing giant headphones, a graphic tee, and a hoodie half over his head is listening to.

**veryanniev** (1.2): I was tempted to give it a 0 because it doesn’t even FEEL like a song, like, how do you rate this?? fuck it, I’m giving it a 1.2 in honour of its runtime.

**2dina3dworld** (1): back it up and get back in your hole, you awful mess

**steelstepladder** (1): This is not a full song

**stryxen** (1): this makes me nauseous

**hikk:** Build a Bitch is, in my opinion, by far the strongest song by an actual TikToker in this rate. While Obsessed and Be Happy scream cash-grab with their horribly bland visual aesthetics and sonic directions, here we see Bella immediatelly establish a distinct profile for herself as a pop artist. Said direction is fairly comparable to that of Melanie Martinez, to be fair - the dark twist on something associated with innocent children as the song's driving metaphor, paired with darker production - but for me personally it works quite a bit better than what Melanie has done even, seeing as... she's not dressing up as a baby which was just weird imo (also she doesn't have rape allegations against her which is always a plus). The music video takes the dedication to an actual aesthetic even further, painting a clear picture of the song in visual form and seemingly having at least some sort of a budget (Dixie's random shots of nothing and Addison's choreo in an empty room could never), and we see this work in Bella's favour as far as commerical success has gone - Build a Bitch has racked up over 300 million MV streams and charted quite a bit better than the songs by her contemporaries. I didn't really think I'd say this about a TikTok star starting a music career, but I'd say I'm definitely curious as to where she goes next with her music!

---

#BUT IF YOU NEED PERFECT, I'M NOT BUILT FOR YOU~~~~~~~~~~

**pig-serpent** (11): The cool thing about having an amazing chorus is that the rest of your song can just sound okay at first and people will learn to love them eventually. It's me, I'm People.

**1998tweety** (10): im sorry but this bops what can i say

**2dina3dworld** (10): Stream Inferno by Bella Poarch and Sub Urban 👀

**Awkward\_King** (10): pussy

**hikkaru** (10): the best tiktoker song by a fair margin

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): Great song, great video, but way too short tbh.

**TiltControls** (9.5): okay this is kind of fun

**akanewasright** (9): …this is kind of shockingly good? I know nothing about Bella as a 20 year old boomer to TikTok, but this is not a vapid or boring song. This is pretty sonically interesting as far as TikTok star songs go, and while I’m not sure how she’ll build on this song to create a music career, she has my attention

**celladonn** (9): It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that this is a bop

**duochromepalmtree** (9): great mixing and I think she has actual potential to be a pop girl! By far my favorite song from a tik toker. “This ain’t build a bitch” is such an earworm.

**educationalmirror** (9): this aint build a dude, bouncing pecs with shoulders too-

**IIIHenryIII** (9): 1,2,3… Ahhhhhh

**moooo566** (9): im not sure its very good but it is very catchy

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This song is the BARE MINIMUM amount of effort I expect from any of these TikTokers trying (and failing) to be singers

**nt96** (8.8): not gonna lie, this slaps harder than it should

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): THIS is how you make a song as a tiktok star, make a relatable, well produced bop

**wavingwolves** (8.6): next main pop girl iktr

**jasannn** (8.5): Outsold Sub Urban. Outsold Melanie Martinez

**best-american-record** (8): new single when, bella?

**hookerofpop** (8): a whole bop <3

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I remember when I first heard about this song I was not expecting much but holy this is a bop

**joeeswift** (8): great song and mv! I also love the effort she put into the visuals, and it paid off

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): What a banger.

**qazz23** (8): The hook is pretty good

**throwaway7650** (8): catchy! the song is a 7.5, bonus .5 for the MV... serving kpop

**vayyiqra** (8): Return of the avocadies, but this song is good somehow despite being like 90 seconds long, and there are worse things to write a song about, so. (Also hot take: this is hyperpop)

**BoneStreetSand** (7.9): I know this is supposed to be empowering, but seeing a girl like Bella Poarch sing about not being perfect makes me feel so ugly lol

**bluepupz** (7.5): The lullaby-like quality works well with the themes of the song. The chorus got stuck in my head for a while. It's just so short :(

**jsonphile** (7.5): I’m a little embarrassed by how much I actually like this song. Bella Poarch might actually have a potential career in pop music, at least certainly more than other tiktok stars.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): The epitome of a tiktok song where the best part of the song is an amazing hook and the rest of the song just circles around until it's time to push the hook again. And then it's over before it overstays its welcome.

**stryxen** (7.5): actually kind of a slay

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): yeah. it's good.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): as much as I want to give this a low score, it's a bit of banger and the hook is so catchy. my only knock against it is it's too short

**jman457** (7.4): Thought I wasnt gonna like this, but the drop kind of saved this

**Brendon-Urine** (7): it's entirely built around the chorus, but damn it's a good chorus

**letsallpoo** (7): was nobody going to tell me that bella poarch is a us navy veteran or was i supposed to figure that out myself

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): I feel like this is the kind of song high school bullies would LOVE, but honestly still kind of a bop

**MrMoodle** (7): i liked this more than i thought i would lol

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): she’s right and she should say it, the music is too Melanie Martinez-core for my taste though

**schwiftydude047** (7): don’t know how she’s already doing concerts with just one hit song.

**skargardin** (7): this is stupidly catchy i'll give it that

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJExBgM/

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): I hate to think about listening to tiktoker songs but this is credible enough that I don’t even feel that bad with it.

**plastichaxan** (6.8): this is ALMOST good, ALMOST. i hate to admit it but this gets stuck on my head if i hear it on tiktok

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (6.5): this is what Melanie Martinez thought she was doing

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this is one of those songs where exactly one idea went into it and it's a good idea but it needed more to support it

**seanderlust** (6.3): i love you melanie martinez

**aestheticen** (6): Would have been decent without the beat drop. It throws me off and reminds me too much of "Cradles"

**banmoderator** (6): honestly decent debut

**brenda\_official** (6): this sounds like the music that plays in the queue for the smiler ride at alton towers uk fish know

**camerinian** (6): I have like no desire to ever listen to this song of my own accord, and the verses are the sole reason why, otherwise this would be like a 9+ because that fucking chorus will not dislodge itself from my brain

**cheatviathan** (6): I wish this had a more compelling beat, because I do like the lyrical sentiment and the vocals. The toy metaphors do not make me cringe, and that alone is worthy of praise.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): see this song is good but that post chorus will actually kill me one day

**hephaestionline** (6): main pop girl Bella Poarch coming to end misogyny

**Hulnia** (6): I should probably hate this, but I just can’t, that chorus just slaps man. 😩

**Iris3271** (6): Giving Great Value Melanie Martinez

**tinaoe** (6): i'd add another few points if i was drunk in a club bathroom but alas

**welcome2thejam** (6): "Bob the Builder broke my heart" is not at all a phrase I expected to hear today or ever really

**astrologicalangel** (5.5): still can't believe this gets played on the radio

**veryanniev** (5.5): this had the potential to really go off but it never did

frogaranaman: #prefers Melanie Martinez, possibly has a diaper fetish

**2RINITY** (5): This feels like baby's first song with swear words in it

**AHSWeeknd** (5): giving “society bad” vibes, which can be done well but this isn’t one of the times it’s done well. The beat goes off tho.

**bbfan132** (5): a song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): The lyrics are kinda funny, but it's still a dud of a song for me. That little vocal tic of idk, vocal decrescendo? Annoying.

**kreddit2** (5): also generic

**nootnoot781** (5): chorus is a 9 though

**waluigiest** (5): this is same wave of feminism that Meghan Thee Trainor was riding with All About That Bass

**GARjuna** (4.5): idk I want more out of this

**just\_thonking** (4.5): it always bothers me when people call this "the one good influencer song" cause it's not good

**ProfeNeuro** (4): I really like the chorus, but the rest of the song feels incomplete (refer to: the “lalala” section after the chorus). Penalty points because most songs about how “beauty doesn’t matter” is sung by someone who obviously benefited from being naturally beautiful, and Bella Poarch is not an exception.

**teenwitches** (4): this would be better if literally anyone else sang it

**bigbigbee** (3.5): I feel that I am allowed to vaguely dislike Bella Poarch because I DO like Belle Delphine. Belle Delphine makes better music too. Music wise the chorus of this is fine but I hate the nasally “na na na” part.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I'm sorry but this song is so fucking asinine and irritating

**runaway3212** (3): I never got why this is the tiktok single people called good, it's arguably way blander than dixie

**steelstepladder** (3): Melanie Martinez for people who think they're too good for Melanie Martinez

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): more like build a better song

**Uberpigeon** (3): NO MORE GLOCKENSPIEL NURSERY RHYME MOTHER GOOSE MUSIC. MELANIE MARTINEZ DONE FUCKED UP MUSIC

**whatsanillinois** (3): what the fuck

**shhhneak** (2.8): Not this nursery rhyme type beat.

**arhmaer** (2): simone de beauvoir WISHES she could

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): this sounds a lot like Melanie Martinez. that is not a good thing.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Melanie Martinez without the Melanie Martinez (which means its better)

**flibbityflob** (1.8): the production is kinda fun ig but the lyrics are so bad it makes me want to die and the more the track goes on the more my ears bleed

**cremeebrulee** (1): maybe i'm not a feminist

**ReallyCreative** (1): this is so juvenile omg

**Roxieloxie** (1): i get the message of this but there is some irony behind it being delivered by a highly followed tiktok personality

**sssaaage** (1): the drop is actually so horrid

**Verrem** (1): how about you build a good song instead

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (0): A Melanie knock-off? In 2021?

fuck you /u/Awkward_King

This song is genuinely insufferable. I fucking hate it so much. There are like four ideas going on here and none of them work together. I don’t even care what you guys think of this song, it is literally one of my least favorite things on Tiktok. There are only 15 good seconds of this song and it's what was trending on Tiktok. I wish I never heard the rest of this song and rated it based on the trend. I fucking hate it here. Fuck you guys.

#WHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDO

**Awkward\_King** (11): i just thought it was the best song i'd ever heard

**cremeebrulee** (11): this song honestly led me to a lot of the friends i made on ph so ??? ty will.i.am for being horny on a kids movie soundtrack ig????

**moooo566** (11): his best work

**nootnoot781** (11): i needed something that was good but also inane to give my 11 to and this fits the bill perfectly. it's such a dumb song but an utter earworm. also dare i say this is the best thing will.i.am has ever done?

**rickikardashian** (11): what possessed will.i.am to make a random song in the middle of *Madagascar 2* go so hard? there had to be a spiritual connection between will.i.am and god themselves when he wrote this because there are no words to describe the other-wordly journey i go on when the “what she do, what she do…” part starts

**2dina3dworld** (10): this song reminds me of two things: the r/popheads discord server and this dude I know who went on a school camp where he had to listen people sing this for 10 hours

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m always so shocked to find out will.i.am made this. A true eleven contender.

**akanewasright** (10): One of the best songs ever made and a worthy winner

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this is fine art

**best-american-record** (10): classic

**CrimsonROSET** (10): throwback to when this song almost started a civil war in the popheads discord like [shit’s crazy](https://i.imgur.com/yz3trCU.png)

**GARjuna** (10): STRONG 11 CONTENDER. I miss madagascar. Who remembers this legendary trailer?????

**hikkaru** (10): WHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDO

**jsonphile** (10): okay the fact that gen Z decided to make Moto Moto’s song from Madagascar 2 a tiktok hit gives me hope for the future. Unironically though a great groove, and might be will.i.am’s best solo song

**letsallpoo** (10): https://gfycat.com/LeadingFilthyBlueandgoldmackaw

**plastichaxan** (10): i went into this thinking i wouldn't give it that great of a score but after these first few songs this outsold them all by far

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is for u/awkwardking

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): it’s THE cultural reset. CHON KAY

**skargardin** (10): WHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDOWHATSHEDO

**sssaaage** (10): oh my god Big and Chunky by will.i.am came on i'm crying no i really am i love you will.i.am thank you so much ❤️ my life literally couldn't get any better than in this moment right now while i'm listening to Big and Chunky by will.i.am i just want to personally thank him for writing the lyric "what she do" it transcends pop music this is a universal moment ahh thank you so much will.i.am for singing the beginning of the bridge literally no one else besides you could have done it this really is the best moment of my life ❤️❤️❤️

**throwaway7650** (10): this is a 10 for its comedic relief but I have PTSD from hearing this from rate reveals (surely this reveal will add to the trauma)

**TiltControls** (10): they don't make music like this anymore

**vayyiqra** (10): So relatable. Who doesn't like 'em chunky. This is art.

**waluigiest** (10): yeah me too

**wavingwolves** (10): this is genuinely such a good song like... it's actually so amazing i can't put it into words so i'll just say i have listened to this more than a hundred times and i can't ever listen to it only once

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I unironically like this. It sounds like Will I Am had the time of his live making this. All the different voices and weird sound effects just add so much texture. When the “what she do”s hits? NOTHING is better.

**MrMoodle** (9.5): why is this by far the best solo will.i.am song

**celladonn** (9): Will.I.Am's best song

**shhhneak** (8.8): All rise for the BeatSense national anthem.

**jman457** (8.5): We love a fun Body positivity anthem, also i distinctly remember this scene in the movie when i was 10

**95ztaehyung** (8): unironically slaps

**Hulnia** (8): A true masterpiece, never heard any other song that compares, -2 because the movie sucks though.

**intheaftermath** (8): This is one of my little brother's favorite songs and it is SO fun to blast in a car :)

**Iris3271** (8): Will.i.am didn't have to go this hard but I'm grateful he did

**runaway3212** (8): fuck you u/awkward_king

**stryxen** (8): comelohaces comolohaces comolohaces comolohaces

**tinaoe** (8): yes

**Uberpigeon** (8): this is a song that really speaks to me because, like moto moto, I too like them big and chunky

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Why is this song actually a bop??

**BoneStreetSand** (7.5): I twerked so hard that the catheter in my oesophagus made me gag.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): a career high for Will.i.am

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): i’m rating this one unironically i’ve decided and its stockholm syndromed me into some fun

**1998tweety** (7): bop

**2RINITY** (7): This feels like a shitpost with a surprisingly nice bassline

**aestheticen** (7): Incredibly camp

**Brendon-Urine** (7): does kinda slap...

**cheatviathan** (7): Even for as grating as some of the adlibs are, the bassline is groovy as hell, and will.i.am in this huskier tone works for me. The lyrical content is something I’d slot into “too stupid to hate” territory, especially the part where he rhymes “spacious” with “spaceship”.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I only knew the dubbed version of this song in my first language, and I really like it, but this one is actually a true bop.

**jasannn** (7): Big and campy

**schwiftydude047** (7): look out I think Moto Moto likes you.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): CHUNKY CHUNKY CHUNKY

**welcome2thejam** (7): I deadass don't know how to respond

**bluepupz** (6.5): I've never listened to more than the first 30 seconds of this until now. I'm blaming y'all if my Spotify starts suggesting Madagascar soundtrack songs. The power of the meme is too strong LOL.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (6.5): "this song is literally about a hippopotamus" - frog. anyways, Moto Moto wya

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): how did this get cleared for a children's movie soundtrack?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): In my personal opinion, Gloria > Moto Moto. Go ahead, arrest me, take me to horny jail, I deserve it. (Also: 1. The bassline honestly slaps, and 2. Why the hell does Hans Zimmer have writing and production credits on this?)

**ReallyCreative** (6): I like em Big and Chunky too but I'm kinda tired of this one

**seanderlust** (6): the ying yang twins been real quiet since this dropped

**teenwitches** (6): still can't believe this is a song about a cartoon hippo

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJwEYfu/

**kreddit2** (5.5): bc I THINK i remember where this song was used in the movie so + on nostalgia

frogaranaman: #fuck you /u/Awkward_King

**educationalmirror** (5): all about that bass tried to be this song

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (5): Bye there's no reason this had to run any longer than the 0:40 or so seconds it was in the movie.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): My Humps outsold

**matthewc20090** (5): this is the most uncomfy bop. wait what the fuck its on madagascar's soundtrack? LMFAOOOOO

**Roxieloxie** (5): king bestie </3 im sorry but this has been absolutely overplayed to death for me im starting to get tired by it

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (5): i really wish the 'it's all in the way she moves' part was its own separate song because it goes off

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): it feels so weird rating this as an actual song bc to be honest i never once heard of this song outside of madagascar memes and didnt know it had a full version to begin with? i also didnt know will.i.am sang this either so. thanks for making me aware of that fact popheads

**bbfan132** (4): sorry but no

**camerinian** (4): I don’t know if that rad bassline makes this more or less uncomfortable

**hookerofpop** (4): very disturbing

**joeeswift** (4): the last minute or so really saved this song and made it kinda enjoyable

**nt96** (4): I like the beat but that deep voice skeeved me tf out. NOT amused (or aroused).

**ProfeNeuro** (4): https://i.redd.it/9go0xj3i7by31.jpg

**TragicKingdom1** (4): do yall think will.i.am lost his voice doing that raspy voice for the whole song

**just\_thonking** (3.5): I struggle to get through this song

**slimboyfriend** (3.4): The sad thing is that this sounds like a song will.i.am would put on his studio album

**banmoderator** (3): song is bad, tiktoks were funny

**rslashpoopheads** (3): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**veryanniev** (3): not my favourite Hans Zimmer work, if I’m honest

**whatsanillinois** (3): i feel like will.i.am is about to catcall me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.2): This song makes me SO uncomfortable LMAO. I should like how shitposty it is but noooo pick me up mom I'm scared

**arhmaer** (2): this might just be the funniest song ive ever heard

**ImADudeDuh** (2): yeah it’s just a sub par will.i.am song and no amount of beattense plays will change my mind

**pig-serpent** (2): This song is not interesting instrumentally, Will.I.Am is not a good producer, and the song is not as funny as it thinks it is. There's not much to like here.

**Verrem** (2): can't say I disagree with the message, not a big fan of the Günther impression though

**apatel27** (1): why would this be popular wtf

**avg-vag** (1): my ears won’t have it william

**duochromepalmtree** (1): I was actually really enjoying this until I saw it was mr. William. Once I realized I had immediate ick. Unacceptable.

**hephaestionline** (1): I've watched Madagascar (1) an embarrassing number of times but never heard this

**static\_int\_husp** (1): I'm a twink so I can't relate

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): Literally delete the word plumpy from exsitence immediately

**xavieryes** (1): what the actual fuck is this

**flibbityflob** (0): Jesus Fucking Christ.

so true this is a dissociative anthem

---

#AM I A MANNNNNNNNN

**AHSWeeknd** (10): went off

**akanewasright** (10): I knew a girl who could not sing at all who performed this in front of her school and was nominated for the “best singer” senior superlative because of it. I hope she’s doing well now. Anyway this song and movie deserve all the love in the world.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is camp

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this is not a “meme song” this is a beautiful tune from an incredible film!!! I will be blocking anyone who rated this below a 7.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): an academy award WINNER

**jsonphile** (10): there will be no Jason Segel slander nor Muppets slander within this subreddit

**rickikardashian** (10): i relate to the muppet because ive also had someone’s hand in my behind

**Roxieloxie** (10): I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THIS IS IN THE RATE BUT THE SOLE REASON IVE WANTED A OSCAR SONGS RATE IS SO I CAN 11 THIS, I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH

**runaway3212** (10): this is actually the funniest song ever

**schwiftydude047** (10): this song is god tier.

**skargardin** (10): we love an oscar winning song

**teenwitches** (10): bret from flight of the concords wrote this and won an oscar for it, so go watch fotc and what we do in the shadows so you can support new zealand's clearly superior comedy scene

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): this is a lonely island song

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): this song is queer coded change my mind

**jman457** (9.4): We stan an oscar nominated bop!

**intheaftermath** (9): I saw this in theatres when I was like 8 and it changed my life

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9): This song really changed when FistTok got its hands on it

**welcome2thejam** (9): Jason Segel yelling "I'm a muppety man" is an absolute showstopper and there's nothing you can do about it

**jasannn** (8.5): I just saw a tik tok trend for this I'm simultaneously horrified and cracking up.

**best-american-record** (8): this was moving, i paid off my credit card debt and made amends with my estranged father bc of this song

**camerinian** (8): Sufjan Stevens couldn't win the Oscar but this did, so uh who's the real muppet here

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): why does this song envoke so much emotion?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1QMX5/

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): the muppets have the firmest grip on me and idk why

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): watch the muppet movie its cute

**2dina3dworld** (7): the superior version will always be the “am I a rat or am I a lady? If I’m a rat than I’m a very ladylike rat”

**matthewc20090** (7): a question i have never asked but now im glad i know the answer to

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): i remember seeing this scene in the cinema and just being in shock

**Verrem** (7): Flight of the Conchords always bangs

**seanderlust** (6.9): why is this a meme? I mean it's good but like...?

**bluepupz** (6.5): There was a Muppet movie? I mean the subject matter is... Muppets and men but the singing is nice!

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): good movie

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): I have no idea how this relates to TikTok but uh... Wow, this is surprisingly good. Weirdly reminds me of "Space Oddity" in some parts.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): shout out to the year this won an oscar for best original song not because its that particular good, but because there were literally only two nominations that year and the other one was from the fucking rio animated movie. idk what happened in 2011 where movies didnt wanna make original songs anymore but i think about that random fact a lot

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Truly Oscar-worthy songwriting here

**plastichaxan** (5.5): decent compared to a lot of what's going on in this rate

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): the muppets are lowkey horrifying monsters

#OR AM I A MUPPET (AM I A MUPPET)

**arhmaer** (5): god i felt this

**bbfan132** (5): a song

**bigbigbee** (5): No muppet has ever looked like Jason Segel in his muppet form, and that’s a good thing. No one would watch The Muppets ever again if they did. As for the song, it’s fine. I don’t think it’s very enjoyable.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): eh. I stan the Muppets tho. Follow Ms. Piggy on Instagram! Your faves could never.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (5): fuck me Kermit

**throwaway7650** (5): this song is not the identity crisis it thinks it is

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): are we human, or are we muppet?

**my friend Ethan** (4): this is camp

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): Is this humor too highbrow for me to understand

**aestheticen** (3): This is definitely very weird to me without having watched the movie

**flibbityflob** (3): deserved the oscar it won.

**GARjuna** (3): gave me a headache

**banmoderator** (2): the muppets movie deserves more hate and its fans deserve more bullying

**Uberpigeon** (2): i hate this but also vote for fictional musicians rate for more muppets yass

**thedoctordances1940** (1): no but this is awful, literally couldn't finish it

**vayyiqra** (1): Paradoxically this is a little too good at parodying cheesy power ballads; so good it's not funny, it just sounds exactly like one and that's cringe. Sorry Bret

**1998tweety** (10): camp

**2dina3dworld** (10): does the wiping out of Tomato Town count as a genocide and/or a war crime? Discuss in 600 words or less

**BoneStreetSand** (10): My mum asked me if this was me when I played it out loud like wtf???

**Brendon-Urine** (10): no reason for this to go off like it does

**celladonn** (10): He ate and left no crumbs

**duochromepalmtree** (10): absolutely genius. If this was my kid I would be so proud (and that’s not sarcasm I think this is genuinely awesome)

**hephaestionline** (10): any American Boy is a 10/10 (especially pro Fortnite gamers)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): me in the first 20s - why does this sound like American boy? Me afterwards -“ended Estelle and Kanye”

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking BOP

**just\_thonking** (10): perfect, no notes

**nootnoot781** (10): losing my mind during this rate. what the fuck even is the criteria for a good song? why am i giving this a 10 i would literally give american boy the same score if it was in this rate. are they of even quality??? i have no idea. i genuinely have lost all thoughts.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this would’ve been my eleven

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Estelle wishes she could do this

**rickikardashian** (10): seeing people born after 2005 discover American Boy because of this made me feel another level of ancient, and I was born in this millenium

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): sure

**slimboyfriend** (9.4): idk what any of this means but I love it

**jman457** (9.3): American boy is so iconic so…..

**jasannn** (9): bring parodies back pls

**jsonphile** (9): this will always put a smile on my face and I don’t even play fortnite or understand most of these references.

**matthewc20090** (9): a work of art

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): I've only ever played Fortnite twice but I can definitely vibe with the lyrics. Doesn't triumph over Estelle's original, but it sure comes close.

**tinaoe** (9): i want to be this innocent again

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): The first time I heard this song it put the stupidest smile on my face… and it still does

**apatel27** (8): cause a kid I used to teach sang it a lot and I like him

**inesmina** (8): I just died with this

**intheaftermath** (8): eh, Minecraft parodies are better

**moooo566** (8): better than kanye, but i feel estelle would smash her section's equivalents into a solid 10

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): YOU’RE 🌥️ SO SUSSY 😓😓🙊😨😳🎵 I 😀 KNOW 💭 YOU 👈 TOOK 👫 MY 😏 FORTNITE 🎮 CARD 🃏🃏 I 🍾 KNOW 🤔 YOU 🤖 TOOK 🤯 MY 😘 19 ❗ DOLLAR 💲 FORTNITE 💩 CARD 💳 GIVE 🚪🌌🍸 ME 👈 MY 👨😣 19 ❗ DOLLAR 💰 FORTNITE 💩 CARD 💳😑 YOU 👈😭 BETTER 🎰 GIVE 👹 ME 👩💡 MY 🥳 19 ❗ DOLLAR 💸 FORTNITE 👌🎮 CARD 🗃 I 👹 NEED 📲 MY 🔑 19 ♈ DOLLAR 💵 FORTNITE 👌🎮 CARD, 💳 NOW! 📅

**veryanniev** (8): I started chuckling uncontrollably and any song that is able to do that to me deserves at least 8 points

**akanewasright** (7.7): Still kinda taken aback that this is still like… out there and hasn’t been taken down lmao

**teenwitches** (7): i wish the lyrics fit the meter just a little better

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): i hate that i enjoyed this more than a bunch of songs in the regular rate

**waluigiest** (7): loses a few points because it’s a character voice, not actually a child singing :/

**welcome2thejam** (7): The first big family get together we had post-lockdown, all the little kids were singing this over and over and over and over. So I'm very fond of this song and would like to never hear it again

**camerinian** (6): Fortnite/Minecraft parodies will never not be funnier in concept than in practice

#fuck gamer lives

**bigbigbee** (5): I hope this kid is doing well. I thought Minecraft parodies were good, and I think this is…well it’s not good, but I think the spirit is perfect. Kids innocently being kids and having the imagination to make something like this (!) is something that should be protected and lauded. I don’t enjoy listening to this so I can’t score it very high (as opposed to if we were scoring, for example, TNT, the Minecraft parody of Dynamite, which I think is a 10), but A for effort.

**Verrem** (5): it's Gamer time

**banmoderator** (4): kinda silly

**cheatviathan** (4): LeviathanJPTV is continuing to support Epic Games even while they buy up exclusives for their digital storefront, and crunch their employees to hell and back. Corporate bootlickers like him are the reason why “AAA” video games are so bad now.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): i hope this is the last time we rate empire state of mind

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): why would you ruin such a fantastic song like this 😭

**bbfan132** (2): no comment

**nt96** (2): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK5J5_N2pP0

**runaway3212** (2): sorry I hate this

**seanderlust** (2): yes I do hate fun

**TiltControls** (2): why wasnt the in the vocal rate

**aestheticen** (1): What the fuck is this

**AHSWeeknd** (1): dear Lorde! this is just, I can’t.

**avg-vag** (1): do i need to be a gamer girl to understand this?

**bluepupz** (1): What the FUCK is this [2] Poor American Boy... Estelle sweetie...

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): This song replacing American Boy in people's memories is a crime.

**flibbityflob** (1): not as good as the edit i saw of this with revue starlight characters. you should watch revue starlight. this is the future of art though.

**GARjuna** (1): this is a travesty. Fuck you for ruining a perfectly good song

**plastichaxan** (1): how can i 0 a bonus rate song

**skargardin** (1): there are no words.......

**static\_int\_husp** (1): somehow this going a whole 3 mins is so much worse than the snippet used on TikTok

**vayyiqra** (1): feeling bad because it sounds like a literal kid but this is unlistenable i had to take my headphones off

#castaways, we are castaways

**1998tweety** (10): deserved to win the main rate

**2dina3dworld** (10): how is this a better summer album than the entirety of Solar Power?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): , should’ve been in the main rate, a literal eleven

**bbfan132** (10): i like the bossa nova sound here!!!

**best-american-record** (10): snubbed by the Grammys

**CrimsonROSET** (10): backyardigans was my SHIT austin was my favorite because he was there half the time but sometimes he’d just stay in his house and pretend those other kids dont exist and that’s a mood

**hephaestionline** (10): WE ARE CASTAWAYS

**hikkaru** (10): aurrr it's so catchy

**ImADudeDuh** (10): backyardigans being celebrated for their bops whew

**jasannn** (10): Backyardigans bossa nova :thots:

**jman457** (10): this feels like a quarter life crisis anthem

**nootnoot781** (10): i think?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this absolutely deserved to be in the main rate frog and i will judge you endlessly for it

**rickikardashian** (10): invented brazil

**Roxieloxie** (10): Frog you absolute *coward* for not putting this in the main rate so i could 11 it. backyardigans was one of my favorite shows as a kid, im glad more people are discovering how much the music unironically goes off.Anyway I think i played this song when my mom asked me how i was feeling after finding out that I didnt have on campus housing

**runaway3212** (10): me and my brother as 6 year old performing outsold but actually insold

**teenwitches** (10): more bossa nova please

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1gpoY/

**TragicKingdom1** (10): into the thick of it >> but im glad these visionaries finally made it into a rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I mean how can I not

**waluigiest** (10): whoever left a comment about this song on Taken by Hayley Williams, know that I think about that weekly

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): the real song of the summer

**jsonphile** (9): unironically pretty great. Very relaxing vibes

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (9): absolute banger

**nt96** (9): When the damn kids show has better music than this bonus rate.

**TiltControls** (9): icons

**tinaoe** (9): i had never listened to the whole song this is delightful

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): Honestly a vibe

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this had a bigger cultural impact than anything in the main rate

**schwiftydude047** (8): a nostalgic bop through and through.

**throwaway7650** (8): well not "fuck them kids" actually (justice for wonder pets)

**whatsanillinois** (8): better than billie bossa nova

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): this is unironically pretty good

**camerinian** (7): this would be a really nice instrumental if it wasn’t being sung over by literal children

**intheaftermath** (7): the songwriting is there, the vocals are not

**jackisboredtoday** (7): “we are castaways” represents the alienation that can exist in a capitalist society. “we’re stuck where we are with no house, no car, castaways, ahoy we are castaways” this represents the stagnation of economic prosperity and “we are with no house, no car” represents how most of the working class struggles to make ends meet

**matthewc20090** (7): originally had this at 11 after watching this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAGjfFmFkw 

 but actually there are so many good songs and this one is a meme

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): It's kinda surprising that some of the best and most memorable songs come from kids TV shows. Adam Neely did a great video on this song's bossa-nova influence that's well worth your time.

**cheatviathan** (6): In our college’s gaming club, we had a debate to determine which FrontYardigan had violated the Geneva Conventions the most. The consensus was unanimous: Uniqua was a war criminal piece of trash, and Pablo would never do any wrong.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): cuuuute

**plastichaxan** (6): okay but she’ll never be the spanish version so

**veryanniev** (6): I wish I knew the context of why this is a tiktok meme lmao

**seanderlust** (5.6): this song has roughly the same plot as the gilligan's island theme song

#ahoy there, ahoy

**akanewasright** (5): the backyardigans have done much better imo

**bluepupz** (5): Cute song. Perhaps not for my age demographic, but I can see the vision.

**stryxen** (5): industry plants

**vayyiqra** (5): Yeah I know the Backyardigans are a meme but there is nothing fun about this it just exists

**flibbityflob** (3): suddenly i'm reconsidering whether i want to have children.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): the backyardigans had so many better songs than this

**Uberpigeon** (3): i dont like that

**apatel27** (2): Backyardigans are a menace

**arhmaer** (2): who the fuck is listening to this

**banmoderator** (2): got old very quickly

**celladonn** (2): If I wanted to hear children singing I would simply listen to Chug Jug With You

**duochromepalmtree** (2): we Stan Peppa in this house.

**Verrem** (2): giving it a two because I hate it less than most of the other meme songs

**aestheticen** (1): This shit sucks

**Hulnia** (1): Sorry, I can’t fucking stand one, and it’s not funny.

**inesmina** (1): because I already gave my 0

**my friend Ethan** (1): this deserves a zero and I hate fun and childrens music and children

**sssaaage** (1): ermm

When I say that most of this rate has some fucking incredible beats, I fucking *mean* it. This song's groove is fucking out of this world and seriously irresistible, even with some of the awkward lyricism from Harm Franklin. Plus, the trend (while kind of basic, in retrospect) is dope as hell for cosplay videos. Found a bunch of really cool creators through this sound and for that I am thankful for it. :-)

---

#stun gun

**AHSWeeknd** (10): gets annoying af, but goes off, plus he’s Canadian

**hephaestionline** (10): CEO of big dick energy

**akanewasright** (9.3): this kinda fucks I can’t lie

**Awkward\_King** (9): me when i ingest too many yasspills and make a bop

**cremeebrulee** (9): the lyrics are a bit :peloton: but i fear it bops a lil

**jman457** (9): unlike most of other rap songs that go viral this like a smooth whisky

**runaway3212** (9): I have never seen this person but I believe them immidiately tbh

**aestheticen** (8.5): Sure... if you say so

**plastichaxan** (8.5): okay this one got me i really liked this and the trend(s) that came along with it

**1998tweety** (8): bops tbh

**awhile2** (8): on paper this song has everything that should make me hate it but its way too catchy

**bigbigbee** (8): I haven’t seen a ton of the tik tok trends associated with these songs, but I HAVE seen this one, and I think it’s biasing me a little. I just love fashion tik tok and I think that this song fits that mood perfectly. This makes me want to strut.

**camerinian** (8): there is no reason that all bedroom indie pop can’t have grooves this fucking killer

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): This is catchy as hell, it's a vibe. I can't hate.

**GARjuna** (8): gorgeous bassline. Idk one of many songs in this rate that feel like someone dropped xanax on it

**ReallyCreative** (8): Zero Suit Samus charging down smash while I hang at ledge

**schwiftydude047** (8): the references in these lyrics are chef’s kiss

**skargardin** (8): bop!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1xhuh/

**flibbityflob** (7.8): this has the vibes of something you'd hear as the backing music in a synthwave video game. this is a compliment

**2RINITY** (7.5): Solid groove, likable performances, decent quotables. I can see this being the foundation to something bigger for the guys behind it

**throwaway7650** (7.5): wait this is good I fear... oh I didn't realize the ft. was a new voice

**jasannn** (7.3): kirby bop

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): this actually kinda slaps

**bluepupz** (7): I am going to ignore "hey, good pussy sound like pasta" as well as some other choice lines. This has a funky beat, and the chorus is fun to sing along to.

**inesmina** (7): the lyrics are not okay but good jam

**jackisboredtoday** (7): harm franklin takes about a point off this song on his own

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7): I love this song, but it's so straight and I feel embarrassed every time I listen to it

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): I'm McLovin... ahhhh

**welcome2thejam** (7): Shoutout to this dude for making his own Pop-Up Video. All music videos should have this. Every single one

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.8): i just picture people fake walking to this song

**ProfeNeuro** (6.7): this guy wins this year’s “Oh wow this guy was born in Nepal Award”

**banmoderator** (6): honestly production is kinda clean here

**cheatviathan** (6): The beat and the dudes’ deliveries are more effective sedatives than Lunesta, but I can’t fully dismiss a song with lines like “got a young dick, call the pastor” and “she sucking on my neck like Buffy”.

**Iris3271** (6): At least it's funny

**matthewc20090** (6): hook has a killer delivery, everything else is boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): fun to listen to every once in a while

**Uberpigeon** (6): this has boppier production than the other horny guy songs i guess!

**vayyiqra** (6): kind of fun song but bad lyrics; kind of funny though despite that

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I’m super envious of this guy’s self-confidence

**seanderlust** (5.7): some of these lyrics are....uh...not good.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): not awful but not really great

**veryanniev** (5.2): this feels like they took the beat from Say So and made it boring

#was NOT stunned

**best-american-record** (5): not that bad but i probably wont listen to it again

**kreddit2** (5): eh

**rslashpoopheads** (5): ok

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): this song makes me feel nothing

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this doesn't have the charm to pull off the corny lyrics

**bbfan132** (4): these lyrics ruin the song

**ImADudeDuh** (4): the chorus is so good but “I got young dick, call the pastor” is the worst moment in the entire rate

**jsonphile** (4): wow this probably sounds cool to a sixth grader

**pig-serpent** (4): The least interesting use of this retro sound present in this rate, and neither rapper is very good. They're both convinced themselves that they're cool, but they really aren't pulling it off.

**Roxieloxie** (4): i cant get past 'little Einstein bitch ima blast her' what does that even mean

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3.2): Eh, I feel like it could've gone a little further.

**Brendon-Urine** (3): ...is this not bbno$? call me shook

**CrimsonROSET** (3): she wasn’t a fucking vampire dude the title is VAMPIRE SLAYER

**IIIHenryIII** (3): I'm not disappointed. This is accurately the kind of music I was expecting to listen when I learned we were rating TikTok hits.

**intheaftermath** (3): Curtis Waters gives me such an off vibe and I can't figure out why, and it comes across in his music

**stryxen** (3): more like annoyin

**duochromepalmtree** (1): this is what people mean when they say tik tok music is lazy

**sssaaage** (1): the beat is nice but this feels so long and both of them are so annoying

**Verrem** (1): well, something had to end the streak of listenable music..

who wants to go make whipped coffee and talk about the Tiger King with me on Zoom

What a classic of a Tiktok song and one of the prime examples of what fucking *hits* about these songs. It's such a simple idea and such a simple execution, but it works so perfectly ear-wormingly well that you can't help but enjoy it and play it again. I really love the laid-back nature of the song and how easily every idea flows into another, and that goddamn "five, six, seven, eight" countdown in the beginning ALWAYS plays in my head. Such a smash and Claire Rosinkranz really knocked this one out of the park.

---

#whipped coffee fan

**2dina3dworld** (10): This always reminds me of this one specific book and I can’t remember what it is! It was a young adult romance novel about two neighbours who fall in love but the girls parents don’t approve because they’re classist. Anyway, it was a cute and sweet book and that’s the same thing I feel about this.

**aestheticen** (10): I love the "5, 6, 7, 8" at the start of the song. I also think this song is kind of genius

**hephaestionline** (10): LOOKIN' SUPER FINE IN YOUR CORDUROY

**rickikardashian** (10): this girl is the most european woman i have ever seen in my life, and you’re telling me she was born and raised in california???

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): this is just a super cute, summery bop

**jasannn** (9): A Tik tok hit at its best. Short, catchy and a little indie.

**waluigiest** (9): i EAT this cutesy nonsense up

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I thought this was a pretty boring entry in the “bedroom pop” genre when I first heard this song for this rate, but since then, I’ve caught myself singing the chorus a lot. There’s something in this song that sticks with you. I guess that’s what makes it a good Tik Tok hit!

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): very cute but i wish it was more fleshed out

**ReallyCreative** (8.1): I know we're talking about the absolute baseball BEAST, Pablo

**CrimsonROSET** (8): DCOM song (compliment)

**educationalmirror** (8): fun, bedroom popey

**matthewc20090** (8): this song makes me think about my ex. its objectively good but it also makes me think about my ex.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): pick one, PICK ONE (1)

**qazz23** (8): Pleasant indie pop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJTqKSW/

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): always enjoyed hearing the first 5 seconds on the app, and its cute enough that the full song is nice too

**bbfan132** (7.5): til what this song is called

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): queen of ghosting u/TragicKingdom1

**jsonphile** (7.5): this is pretty nice

**nt96** (7.5): Has a bit of a quirky, suburban vibe and it doesn’t seem to take itself too seriously which is nice. Overall, it's a pleasant track.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Very standard chill indie pop, but Claire's vocals are very solid and she does a great job selling the song. The melodies are pretty too.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): is this Clairo for straight women

**seanderlust** (7.3): it's cute and breezy, if a little basic

**1998tweety** (7): this is nice

**duochromepalmtree** (7): this is a really cute song I think I would’ve loved more if I hadn’t heard it on tik tok first. Now it just sounds overplayed to me.

**hookerofpop** (7): cutesy summery vibes

**Roxieloxie** (7): who the fuck are all these indie women

**schwiftydude047** (7): I still listen to this one unironicly.

**teenwitches** (7): it's a cute lil song but i'd argue no one has ever looked good in corduroy

**tinaoe** (7): it's CUTE it feels sunny it's a MOOD

**Uberpigeon** (7): this is cute. It would be lower, if not for all the random little moments that give it personality, i love that shit

**vayyiqra** (7): I can taste the avocadies

**slimboyfriend** (6.9): Funnily enough the hook is my least favorite part of this song even though it definitely sounds like she's running through all her ideas for what the rest of the song should sound like

**avg-vag** (6.5): much better than the sample used on tiktok implies. it's got nice texture for a simple song by a teenager.

**kreddit2** (6.5): it's a little too twee for me but the song/video are kinda cute

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): It's cute...

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6.5): This suffers from only really being 60 seconds of a song for Tik Tok, but the 60 seconds are real cute I can almost excuse it

**throwaway7650** (6.5): cute tiktok indie pop I guess, I like the clown/circus line

**flibbityflob** (6.4): Completely middle of the road, but enough that i actually really like it.

**jman457** (6.2): a fun breezy time but feels like no effort was put in it

**2RINITY** (6): This is like chewing bubblegum that starts off tasting great and then it wears off within 5 minutes. Pleasant, but you just KNOW it's gonna get used to sell people crossover SUVs

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): fine but not really memorable

**banmoderator** (6): cute and decent song

**bluepupz** (6): This song is over 50% da-da-da-da's, and there are like 4 unique lines between the two verses/pre-choruses haha. I think it's cute and peppy, but it feels like the audio equivalent of empty calories.

**Brendon-Urine** (6): first time hearing the entire song, it's definitely not bad.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): okay but pretty forgettable

**plastichaxan** (6): now why'd i always think this was beabadoobee girl it sounds like something someone with that name would sing

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): I dig it. Love the video.

**skargardin** (6): this is cute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this sounds like a kids show song

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): She literally sounds like BENEE… Are we sure they’re not the same person??

**welcome2thejam** (6): Would put it down for being a bit generic, but there's a handful of neat touches here and there, like all the little random backing vocals or the 5-6-7-8 verse interruption

**steelstepladder** (5.6): Wanted to like this one but it doesn't go anywhere

#Tiger King detester

**apatel27** (5): mediocre yt girl song

**arhmaer** (5): i hate the suburbs

**IIIHenryIII** (5): It's so happy and cheerful but so forgettable.

**nootnoot781** (5): six seven eight my boot scootin’ baby is driving me crazy

**ProfeNeuro** (5): can’t wait for Claire R. to inevitably release her “drivers license” in 2023.

**shhhneak** (5): This is so bedroom pop it hurts.

**sssaaage** (5): its cute

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): it's cute, but feels like background music. maybe because that's what it's essentially used for in the tiktoks i've seen that use it

**intheaftermath** (4.5): This song feels like it would unironically have the same music video as Dorian Electra's F The World... it's just so boring

**just\_thonking** (4.5): another song where only ten seconds of it matter

**runaway3212** (4.5): If that how to make jorts video was a song

**cheatviathan** (4): That guitar loop is pleasant enough and the vocals are so so. But the vocal effects on the circus clown line, the turntable scratches, and the countoff before the second verse all clash with everything else for the brief moments they appear. This ain’t me.

**GARjuna** (4): boring

**joeeswift** (4): just over 2 minutes long and I felt like it went on for hours….

**stryxen** (4): ew

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.4): I can see the appeal but it's pretty grating bedroom pop for me. The little scratches are embarrassing. And the avocadis voice...it'll never leave, sigh.

**AHSWeeknd** (3): I’m getting flashbacks to the indie rate

**rslashpoopheads** (3): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**wavingwolves** (1): this song feels like it wants to be a feel good song but it's just so nothing that it isn't able to be

**xavieryes** (1): obnoxious

I loved this trend mainly because people would be like "I'm obviously Heather" and then they'd look like literally any other white person you could randomly point to on the street and it was the best unintentional comedy possible

WHYYYYYY WOULD YOU EVERRRRR KISSSS MEEE??? God, this song is great to wallow to. Conan really nails the "I'm in love with a straight guy who would never want me god dammit" high-school feeling ~~which encapsulated my entire time as a person who went to an all-boys high school~~ that plagues the queers of every generation. Everyone say Thank you, Conan Gray. 

However, I have been emotionally better than this song lately and did not feel it when I was listening to this for the host ballot scores so 5 it is~!

#never got kissed by their hs crush

**educationalmirror** (11): did more for the gay community than yntcd could ever

**hephaestionline** (11): I think I just have a soft spot for these gay pining unrequited love songs. Also I think I might be on the other side of TikTok as y'all, I used to get songs like Heather, Mr. Loverman and Heat Waves (which is criminally missing from the rate by the way) on my FYP. And yeah, the DNF edits which TikTok kept aggressively sending me eventually got me into MCYT. The algorithm knows me better than I do apparently.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I can’t read or hear the name Heather without thinking of Heathers (1988), so this is an instant ten

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): mood lol

**ImADudeDuh** (10): nah cause this is a fucking bop

**jasannn** (10): Traitor by Olivia Rodrigo did it better but it's still his best song.

**seanderlust** (10): the soft crooning, the subject matter, the gay yearning, the gentle if self-effacing positivity for the other woman...sob

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9.5): Yeah, I've been in love with a straight guy before. What's your point?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): corny lyrics knock it down a peg, but overall a pretty solid song

**TragicKingdom1** (9): im really glad i didnt have this song in high school i think it wouldve emotionally damaged me

**akanewasright** (8.8): I’ve seen criticism of this song calling it basic, or that anyone who had been through this could have written it. Honestly I don’t think that’s unfair. But this is the first one I’d really heard, and especially the first one to get any mainstream attention, so I don’t actually care about those people’s opinion on it too much

**kreddit2** (8.8): this was really The Track from Kid Krow; the one that was Great on first listen. happy this had an amazing soft video

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Heather is cute. Even if you don't like her, you can't deny Taylor's talent and impact.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): yeah the swiftie influence is on full display here

**hikkaru** (8): why didn't overdrive blow up wtf

**intheaftermath** (8): Honey what'chu waiting FOR?

**pig-serpent** (8): Hmm, good ballad.

**runaway3212** (8): Fine this song is good but I still think people should say Heather 100% less

**skargardin** (8): god this is catchy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): would be a lot lower of a score if it wasnt for that bridge

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoySNP/

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): now why was this song of his that went viral

**bluepupz** (7.5): Why do indie-pop type people like sweaters and cardigans so much? Outerwear love. I don't like the bendy thing he does with his voice with the "wuaaaaalks by" and "suooooore eyes", but overall I do like the song.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): conan

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): i like that it's gay

**stryxen** (7.5): its ok but i’m usually a conan anti so i’ll compensate slightly

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.3): a little overplayed but still good

**flibbityflob** (7.1): Oh...man okay, yeah, this one hits hard. You can hear the tswift influence here.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): i don't really care for Conan Gray but this is pretty good

**duochromepalmtree** (7): I had to stare down the lyrics to understand a word he’s saying during the verses. It’s fine.

**GARjuna** (7): fun but maniac is better. This guy really is olivia rodrigo but a dude for me

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7): god, you are SO SAD, aren't you?

**rickikardashian** (7): giving this a good score because of *mlm that crushed on straight guys* solidarity

**schwiftydude047** (7): I definitely like having these types of songs on when I need to rest.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I wouldn’t necessarily call myself a Conan stan, but I do appreciate his attempts to popularize the “softboi” aesthetic for men. We can’t all be alpha males sweeties

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): it’s just polyester

**bbfan132** (6.5): sweater, polyester, better

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): i wanna rate Conan Gray but can we rate one of his good songs next

**wavingwolves** (6.1): cute

**Awkward\_King** (6): gay

**nt96** (6): interesting song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): I wanna be your slave and I wanna be your master, I wanna make your heart beat and I wish I looked like Heather

**throwaway7650** (6): it's fine I guess... traitor outsold

**ProfeNeuro** (5.7): my least favorite total drama character when i was younger

**jman457** (5.6): Good song wish there was more though

frogaranaman: #teen angst sucks

**cheatviathan** (5): An overwrought ballad that does precisely nothing for me. It doesn’t have the unique lyrical detail or powerhouse vocal performance of something like “driver’s license”, and the more epic swells of instrumentation on the chorus just don’t hit me in the same way.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): blah

**whatsanillinois** (5): 13 year olds be bumping this one in the club

**2dina3dworld** (4): everytime someone tells me that this song reminds them of me, I lose fifteen years off of my life. Funnily enough, my score is the same as how many times I’ve been told that I remind them of this song as well.

**apatel27** (4): boring & melodramatic

**sssaaage** (4): its cute actually but like i hate his voice kinda and the lyrics are HORRIBLE

**vayyiqra** (4): Yeah. This is boring but it's going to be overhated because Popheads has an irrational dislike of Conan. Still boring though.

**waluigiest** (4): olivia rodrigo outsold

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.5): I'm so sorry to all the Conan stans out there. But this is so BLAND. It's a lil whimsical at least. It does that weird scooping vocal tic I'm not into.

**Uberpigeon** (3.5): be quiet twink

**aestheticen** (3): The tune isn't too bad but I absolutely hate the lyrics in this song. It's so fake deep and I hate how he tries to rhyme "sweater" with "polyester". It makes me very angry for absolutely no reason

**camerinian** (3): I literally have no desire to sit through the entirety of this multiple more times for the rate. Dude took all the dull, boring bits of Billie Eilish’s presentation and forgot all the intricacies and oddities that make her sound remain engaging

**static\_int\_husp** (3): begone, twink

**steelstepladder** (3): Gives me 2012 tumblr vibes I hate it

**teenwitches** (3): don't know what's worse--the weird cooing vocals, the bland af production, or the whiny lyrics

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): this is y'alls king? snorefest

**2RINITY** (2): Shut up shut up shut up shut up get the fuck off the kitchen floor you're embarrassing yourself

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2): This is boring.

**Verrem** (2): I'm NOT the target audience for this

**plastichaxan** (1): god there's something about this conan guy that makes my blood boil and makes me feel sick from how annoying he is is that called hate

**xavieryes** (1): boring

#I'm pretty sure it's just gay angst and not homewrecker shit lol

**CrimsonROSET** (0): is this a straight guy wanting to break up a lesbian couple or a gay guy wanting to break up a straight couple? My take is that it is awful

#we both made very similar Riverdale comments for two very different rates and songs

**MrMoodle** (0): conan gray is like a real life riverdale character

...I'm not sure why "Daisy" was voted in over "STUPID", quite honestly. This one feels way less Tiktok-defining for Ashniiko than "STUPID" and is also way less quality overall. As well, the lyricism on this song kind of sucks and is quite cringy, if I'm being quite honest. I'm glad y'all enjoyed this one, but I know that Ashniiko can and has done better than this.

---

#I'm crazy 🤪 but you like that 😇 I bite back 😈daises 💐 on your nightstand ✨ never forget it 😠 

**2dina3dworld** (10): the Hatsune Miku version is better but this still bangs because being a bitch is my kink

**Awkward\_King** (10): i have a friend who would slit my throat if i didnt give the one ashnikko song in this rate a 10, but also this chorus is... so good

**celladonn** (10): A massive serve

**educationalmirror** (10): fuck a princess i'm a king

**hikkaru** (10): her best imo

**Hulnia** (10): A bop about the superior Mario princess.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): :daisybop: omg is she referencing Professor Screweyes from We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (1993)?! her cultural acumen!

**just\_thonking** (9.5): this is what Build a Bitch wishes it was

**akanewasright** (9): Ashnikko has great energy but that only occasionally translates to a great song every once in a while. It 100% does here

**camerinian** (9): More domme-core please and no you can’t look at my search history

**qazz23** (9): This is pretty good, catchy beat

**thedoctordances1940** (9): It definitely took me a while to get into this when it was released, but the more I listened to it the more I started to love it.

**vayyiqra** (9): I do not like Ashnikko much but sometimes she makes Good music which is Camp

**TiltControls** (8.5): [HI I'M DAISY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdqOfJs2HRc)

**wavingwolves** (8.4): ''only trust a fella for some light amusement'' she's right

**steelstepladder** (8.2): Surprisingly good???

**aestheticen** (8): I like the persona she created in this song ngl

**Brendon-Urine** (8): she popped off.

**cheatviathan** (8): This track is surprisingly solid. The beat is more eccentric and whimsical than I was expecting, while still sounding heavy, and the line “Being a bitch is my kink” will never not make me laugh. The vocals should grate, but they work with this subject matter. P.S. The Hatsune Miku remix is a 10, though. Give it a listen.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): gaslight gatekeep girlbourgeoise

**hephaestionline** (8): listen to the Ashnikko remix of Plastic Doll if y'all haven't

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): unhinged, but in a fun way!

**nt96** (8): Very devious. I like it

**plastichaxan** (8): bit cringey but a bop

**skargardin** (8): i prefer the miku remix but this still bops

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyojNoa/

**Uberpigeon** (8): :daisybop:

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is probably her best song

**rickikardashian** (7.8): daisybop

**throwaway7650** (7.5): ...I don't hate this. stupid (shoutout yung baby tate) is great but outside of that I can't really get into ashnikko but this isn't bad.

**jman457** (7.1): A bit annoying but also makes feel like a bad bitch

**banmoderator** (7): oddly addicting with impressive vocals

**bluepupz** (7): "No dickstraction can confuse me" Amen. This is pretty catchy, though the chorus took a bit to get used to.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): objectively it’s a bad song. But I really do love that hook and I totally get how it went viral.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): When the music video is more entertaining than the song itself.

**intheaftermath** (7): this isn't the Miku version but I can't hear this without thinking of that god awful vocaloid tuning

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The original version is a 7, but the remix with Miku is an 8.8 - I would've given said remix a full 9 if Ash got someone like KIRA to do Miku's part though.

**schwiftydude047** (7): what is up with the looping video for this on Spotify? either way this is a sick girl boss song.

**waluigiest** (7): im crazy 😔 but u like that 🤪

**bbfan132** (6.5): wish i liked this more but it’s ok

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): ashnikko has some good songs but i would not mind if i never heard her music again

**jsonphile** (6): this song is a lot

**pig-serpent** (6): Not a bad song but man the cover art got my hopes up for something weirder. Ashnikko's vocals are really good though, I could see her tearing up a Dylan Brady beat.

**ReallyCreative** (6): not my favorite offering from Ashnikko unfortunately

**sssaaage** (6): i wanted to tank more bc ashnikko is one of the worst new artists her voice is literally so bad but this song is decent

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Please stop laughing… you’re making me uncomfortable

**Iris3271** (5.5): I wanna like this song more but I find it cringy

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): I very much associate this song with that side of tiktok that does the creepy anime movement stuff that is upsetting and unnatural, so this song feels upsetting and unnatural

#prefers STUPID so true

**2RINITY** (5): That...exists

**AHSWeeknd** (5): I don’t really know what to say about this, it exists.

**arhmaer** (5): normally ashnikko is a fun amount of annoying but this is a less than fun amount of annoying. good for them for hitting that

**TheQueenOfVultures** (5): prechorus carries the song

**xavieryes** (5): Julia Michaels sounds weird in this

**best-american-record** (4.8): im not a fan of the song but i’d rather listen to it over some of the others on this list

**kreddit2** (4.5): i agree she's cringey but i do not like that....

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): gaslight gatekeep girlboss the song

**cremeebrulee** (4): i just rly do not care for ashnikko's music

**GARjuna** (4): in another life this lost in the second round of unpretty rapstar 4

**runaway3212** (4): noisy and bad

**flibbityflob** (3.8): it's fine. but I'm listening on Thee Hatsune Miku's birthday and I think the remix is so much better.

**astrologicalangel** (3): Hatsune Miku version is far superior

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (3): It’s giving The Album (2020) bonus track.

**Roxieloxie** (3): i think im getting old

**rslashpoopheads** (3): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): sounds like shit and also i’ll never forgive ashnikko for the godawful hatsune miku remix of this song how dare you do miku so dirty

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.5): In another world I'd be into Ashnikko. Not in this one tho! I liked the Dawn of Chromatica feature but, to use an overrated phrase...kinda cringe.

**ProfeNeuro** (2.5): Daisy > Peach

**lost-ln-the-echo** (2): unfortunately I'm too far past my edgy 15 year old phase to enjoy ANY of this. I'm sorry but I just find every part of this excruciatingly cringeworthy

**1998tweety** (1): im sorry but i absolutely detest ashnikko's music. her singing is awful, her voice is awful, the production is usually gratting. if we end up rating her EP its probably gonna be my lowest average ever.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i hate ashnikko’s music

**steel:** Bill Wurtz, historian, shitposter, musician?? It’s more likely than you think. This quirky plunky bop blew up early in Tik Tok’s lifespan and has endured fairly well, becoming one of his most recognizable contributions to internet culture. Not quite as much as History of Japan but definitely up there. ~~a worthy winner of the rate indeed and it was wonderful seeing it walk out with an 11 average~~

---

#just did a BAD. THING.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): inject this song into my fucking veins i love literally everything about it, bill wurtz is an international treasure and he deserves so much better than being known as the ‘history of the entire world’ guy. ‘I ruined everything, and I let the things I ruined ruin me’ still lives rent free in my head.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I have BPD so this is the soundtrack to my entire existence

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): Bill Wurtz always gets a 10.

**nootnoot781** (10): going feral

**pig-serpent** (10): Weirdos like Bill Wurtz need to reclaim indie pop from alternative radio.

**ProfeNeuro** (10): Bill Wurtz is a creative genius and most of his recent discography gets tens across the board. No stop.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i would let bill wurtz sing me anything

**ReallyCreative** (10): Bill Wurtz is a main pop girl

**seanderlust** (10): bill wurtz makes some of the most innovative music today and you can't change my mind thank you

**steelstepladder** (10): Unironically deserves top 10

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoQdum/

**avg-vag** (9): brilliant internet music achieving what it's supposed to

**Awkward\_King** (9): me

 Nah but seriously, why is this such a bop?

**matthewc20090** (9): bill wurtz is god

**rotating3Dtext** (9): BILL WURTZ!!!

**Roxieloxie** (9): you cowards should've voted in the entire history of japan video i would've 11ed it

**schwiftydude047** (9): for something so bad this is pretty good.

**jman457** (8.6): sounds like a cloud but also existential dread

**rickikardashian** (8.5): *”I'm having a bad day, it's turning into a bad year // All the things I'm supposed to do, and the places I'm supposed to go are canceled”* hit a little closer to home than im comfortable admitting

**TiltControls** (8.5): me when i sent in my poprap scores

**slimboyfriend** (8.3): Taylor Swift

**cheatviathan** (8): Life is but a sad bad and glad mad dream. There’s a lot of interesting stuff going on here instrumentally, which matches the absurdist tone of the lyrics perfectly. I [4 letter word that you can use in various ways that are mostly positive] this song.

**educationalmirror** (8): not my favourite bill wurtz but still good and very tiktokable

**flibbityflob** (8): story of my life. thanks bill.

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): stream History of the World, I Guess

**runaway3212** (8): Don't be so hard yourself bestie bill

**throwaway7650** (8): this is pretty nice actually... "I'm having a bad day / it's turning into a bad year" SO TRUE FUCK 2021

**vayyiqra** (8): This song is a rollercoaster between "is he serious" "is this a forgotten hit from the 80s" "is this a parody of Steely Dan" and it succeeds admirably

**waluigiest** (8): had no idea this was so long

**welcome2thejam** (8): The soundtrack of me currently staying up past 3AM to finish this rate the night before I go to a music festival

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.9): People who accidentally drive one mile above the speed limit and get fined be like...

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this bops more than it has any right to

**wavingwolves** (7.8): this isn't super enjoyable as a full song but its still pretty cool

**bbfan132** (7.5): this is v pleasant to listen to

**camerinian** (7.5): my entire fucking For You page is full of mediocre dudes with synths who want to be Bill Wurtz, so it's nice to have the original article for once.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Taylor Swift - reputation (2017)

**2dina3dworld** (7): Mt Saint Helens is About to Blow Up >>>>>> this

**bluepupz** (7): I didn't know Bill Wurtz actually released a full song on Spotify! I can totally see why this would be popular for memes, but the actual song is pretty decent too.

**celladonn** (7): I think I like Bill Wurtz' music more in concept than I actually like listening to it

**cremeebrulee** (7): should've ended after the first chorus

**just\_thonking** (7): stream history of japan

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): main pop boy bill wurtz

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): I used to think this was from Dear Evan Hansen and I enjoy it more now that I know its not

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): stunned this came out pre-pandemic

**veryanniev** (6.8): the song is cute, the thing is I haven’t heard about Bill Wurtz in about 4 or 5 years and seeing his name just brought back the happy memories of being 18 and watching «History of Japan» for the first time. damn, does he realise how much power he holds over the Internet? insane

**GARjuna** (6.7): is this the japan history man????

**1998tweety** (6.5): its alright

**teenwitches** (6.5): i am also having a bad day/year

**arhmaer** (6): isnt this the history of the entire universe guy??? icon

**hephaestionline** (6): real ones remember history of japan

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its ok as a clip but i don’t like the full song

**jasannn** (6): This melody doesn't work as song but the production is nice.

**NapsAndNetflix** (6): this is great as a tiktok audio but like i will never listen to it so i just dont really know where to rate it

**rslashpoopheads** (6): okay

**Uberpigeon** (6): me about my scores on this rate

**kreddit2** (5.8): sounds like a disney's side character song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): not really feeling this

**jsonphile** (5.5): I’m sorry this is really petty of me but there were certain people at college who were really into this guy’s music and thought it made them “quirky” and “intellectual” and no so because of that I can’t enjoy his music. Bill Wurtz is actually pretty talented but his gimmick gets old quick

**stryxen** (5): okayyy

**shhhneak** (4.6): is this Bo Burnham

**banmoderator** (4): history of japan is iconic but we need to come to terms with the fact that bill wurtz has the same embarrassment factor as bo burnham

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): This is just annoying to me, sorry.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (4): he does not belong outside of Tiktok. keep him in his cage

**plastichaxan** (4): should've stuck to making history of the world videos

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4): me all the time

One of the earliest Tiktok hits on this list, I was SO pleasantly surprised to see it get voted in! Regard is a great producer who makes some bops and this is not an exception. It's an absolute banger of a remix and goes SO hard as a Tiktok hit. It was one of those 2019 Tiktok songs that I was super happy to have be a hit since it was catchy on its own and really opened up my mind to the idea that Tiktok can be an app for music discovery.

#WILLYATAKEMEHOME I WANNA-

**2dina3dworld** (10): if you want me to ride it… you wanna say so!

**aestheticen** (10): I don't care! This is good!

**Awkward\_King** (10): is this abt... yknow..

**CrimsonROSET** (10): listen i have funny comments sometimes but sometimes music is just good and i go ‘wow this is excellent’ and that is all thought i put into it

**akanewasright** (9.5): I don’t know what to say other than “it bops”

**celladonn** (9.5): I find it kind of baffling that I like this as much as I do but it is what it is

**duochromepalmtree** (9.5): I cannot help it this song has me in a choke hold. It sounds like laying in a tanning bed feels. So relaxing but with the shadow of guilty pleasure.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.3): this remix does the original so much justice love to see it

**1998tweety** (9): hold awn this bops

**GARjuna** (9): really chill

**runaway3212** (9): super chill and vibey

**skargardin** (9): summer smash!

**bluepupz** (8.5): This is another song I found on Today's Top Hits. It's really catchy!

**jasannn** (8.5): Regard's production is incredible but i feel like song is a little directionless.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): is this dis-gunshot

**wavingwolves** (8.1): yass generic ass house beat

**2RINITY** (8): Feels like a descendant of that mid-'90's New York house sound, I can vibe with it

**ImADudeDuh** (8): MOOOOMM!!!!! How come Europe gets all the fun EDM hits?

**matthewc20090** (8): i'd dance to this

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1JB5b/

**waluigiest** (8): it’s pretty groovy!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.8): This is pretty neat.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): [me the second this starts](https://gfycat.com/ImmaterialShowyDuck)

**throwaway7650** (7.5): it's nice but not great, different vocals would really elevate this

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): You kinda outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the vocal delivery could’ve been better

**avg-vag** (7): i can’t fault this for being annoyingly overused. it’s pretty good.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): nice smooth bop

**hephaestionline** (7): I must've misheard this song a million times because I thought it was the 4th song I'd heard in recent memory called "Body"

**Hulnia** (7): British radio has got me so fucking sick of EDM and all of it’s subgenres, but occasionally it has some good songs, and this happens to be one of them. 

 That sample works so well for what they’re were going with, pure summer fun.

**MrMoodle** (7): didn’t feel this the first time i listened but that hook has really embedded itself in the deepest crevice of my brain

**pig-serpent** (7): It's an okay groove, but as far as songs in this style go it's not Roses.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's a really cool beat but i wish the vocals were mixed a bit louder

**TragicKingdom1** (7): still a bop but they changed the vocal mix at some point which made it worse

**Uberpigeon** (7): ok for a second i thought it said "he" so i was like omg is this a gay sex song........ then i looked at the lyrics and it isnt.. incredible disappointment!!

**jman457** (6.6): Its catchy but is it even really a song

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s fine

**ProfeNeuro** (6.5): I have just been informed that I have a test for a really difficult class in two weeks (as of writing on the 16th) and I am starting to panic

**stryxen** (6.5): the ‘vibes 😍✨’ playlist dudes were not ready for this song

**schwiftydude047** (6): surprised I haven’t heard this one more.

**intheaftermath** (5.5): that one Hat Kid meme song did it better

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5.5): I swear I've heard this 1000000000 times and yet I instantly forget it exists once it's finished

#did not ride it

**jsonphile** (5): oh this song. Hey it’s another tik tok song that’s enjoyable for fifteen seconds and then boring

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): i liked it at first, but then lost interest and almost immediately forgot what it sounded like

**veryanniev** (5): The original is one of my favourite songs of all time and I want to reiterate to everyone how much better it is. Jay Sean did not deserve this mediocre remix, please go listen to the original!!!!!!

**flibbityflob** (4.3): I'm so apathetic. Listening to this whole thing in one go was a mistake. I feel nothing.

**cheatviathan** (4): This is exactly the kind of monotonous, derivative sludge that I do not want an EDM song to be, and it bores me to tears every time I hear it.

**kreddit2** (4): boring and generic (at this point, this remark is also boring and generic lol)

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (4): I mean, I guess? yeah sure, I guess I'll ride it

**best-american-record** (3): there’s no real beat change and it’s already a pretty chill beat so it doesn’t hold up on it’s own

**IIIHenryIII** (3): This is not good.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): POOPY POOPY POOPY

**sssaaage** (3): i hate edited vocals like this but other than that its just insanely bland and boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i dont really have a comment about this song i just wanna say that i was listening to it on youtube for this rate and side to side was in the recs and the only thing i could think of while listening to this was man i wish i was listening to side to side right now

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I had the most obnoxious, lazy, self-centered college roommate and he played this song EVERY FUCKING DAY. To the point where I have now dubbed any electro-dance-ish song that sounds like this one “roommate’s name-core.”

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.1): This is the music for influencers who will gaslight and fleece you into attending Fyre Fest.

**apatel27** (0): absolutely destroyed a Jay Sean classic wtf

**king:** Pussy Poppin is Rico at her best. Smooth, whimsical, dirty and fun as fuck. Gecs x Rico is a match made in heaven and I am so happy they have become such frequent collaborators, Rico shines on their bright, electronic production this is probably the best example of that. The second shortest track on her 2020 album Nightmare Vacation (which we *will* be rating), I can 100% see why this was the song TikTok selected to blow up, though I am still slightly resentful its success made her change the title and add the parenthesis. It marks her second song to go truly viral on the app, following Smack A Bitch which was already rated, and robbed, in the Up and Coming Rap Girls Grabbag last year. And look out for Rico's """summer""" mixtape hopefully coming soon, featuring Dylan Brady as the head producer (!!!) and allegedly including a Flo Milli collab! We aren't worthy!

#got a real big (oop) for sure

**2dina3dworld** (10): this should’ve been duking it out with “Make His Pockets Hurt”, but it’s alright. I’ll be happy if it bet all the male rappers

**AHSWeeknd** (10): honestly goes off

**akanewasright** (10): Rico X Gecs is a dream team methinks. This is just DRIPPING in energy and character and everything good and I love it dearly. I mostly knew Rico for the angry songs until iPhone came out, and seeing her a song like this, one that’s so… fun and silly and lewd kind of made me realize exactly how much range she has. I now count her among my favorite up and coming rappers. If I had a second 11, I would give it to this song. It just makes me happy.

**Awkward\_King** (10): god i love this song, and there will come a time when i can 11 a rico song, but this isnt it. but this song man.... its ear candy

**bbfan132** (10): masterpiece

**cremeebrulee** (10): rico pulling a cxh and refusing to say cock ... we hate to see it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): rico nasty more like what a rich nasty beat you got

**plastichaxan** (10): this just gets better with every listen

**camerinian** (9): STAN RICO, ALL DAY

**intheaftermath** (9): Rico Nasty's voice is just so great to listen to

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): love me some Rico

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Not my ultimate Rico fav but it's iconic for a reason!

**throwaway7650** (8.5): god rico has so much charisma, I'm always entertained

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.1): Rico is so talented and charismatic.

**jman457** (8.1): Rico is that bitch

**2RINITY** (8): Hell yeah Rico

**Brendon-Urine** (8): what a beat!

**cheatviathan** (8): It being barely over two minutes is a feature rather than a flaw. Rico’s charisma, the in-your-face beat, lines like “This pussy don’t purr, it fights back”, it’s all incredibly engaging. But I feel like it would become too overbearing or too stale if it kept this energy for four minutes. I really need to check out Rico Nasty’s other work. This, and her contributions to the “Ringtone” remix have me intrigued.

**GARjuna** (8): this fucks. Need to check her out

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is not the rico tiktok song i thought would get it and unfortunately that means i dont have a story for this

**skargardin** (8): tag changes due to tiktok virality MUST be stopped

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyooaSb/

**1998tweety** (7.5): my bussy is boppin to this

**celladonn** (7.5): I like Rico's music but this is ever so slightly annoying

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): I would twerk my ass off to this for sure. Another short song though.

**arhmaer** (7): I NEED HER

**rickikardashian** (7): she should get that checked out

**steelstepladder** (7): Perfectly fine but kind of your standard Rico song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): i hope all the conservatives who thought wap was too nasty never listen to this song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): it's fine

**banmoderator** (6): nightmare vacation was good but this was one of the weaker tracks

**bigbigbee** (6): I’ve loved EVERYTHING else I’ve heard from her. I love her performance here still too – her attitude is so great, I truly think she’s something special. But this song just doesn’t do it for me for some reason.

**bluepupz** (6): I don't love the background music/beats, and I prefer the verses to the chorus.

**schwiftydude047** (6): this guy must be really passionate

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ehh to me sounds like just another “my pussy bomb af” rap song… But it is pretty entertaining nonetheless

#size does not matter

**jsonphile** (5): I totally understand why people like Rico Nasty but I just can’t

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (5): cupcakKe's not as talented cousin

**pig-serpent** (5): Rico Nasty is super hit or miss for me and this one definitely isn't the former.

**runaway3212** (5): Jack Harlow I hope this answers your question

**sssaaage** (5): its .. a song.. iphone washed

**stryxen** (5): she has much better songs

**Uberpigeon** (5): rico i want to like your music

**flibbityflob** (3.6): Uh.....again, not for me.

**kreddit2** (3): not a lot happening

**brenda\_official** (2): annoying

**IIIHenryIII** (2): Too much "woo".

**vayyiqra** (2): yeah I hate Rico Nasty's voice don't know why not sorry

**aestheticen** (1): This is bad

**ProfeNeuro** (1): hey could we swap this song with Ritt Momney’s cover of “Put Your Records On”? They both start with “Pu”, but I like the latter more.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): it's like saweetie but bad

**Euphie:** Suddenly, I’m transported back to university. Mother Mother had a GRIP on the quirky indie kids of Canada back then! I never imagined that a decade later, it would once again have a grip on alt kids showing off goth lewks on TikTok. This song has it ALL: earworm hook, sex in a barn, murderous rage! It kinda gives Pumped Up Kicks, both are catchy indie bops about impending gun violence (do the IPR rate!!), but this is way more unhinged. Whether you’re in love with or annoyed by them (I pretended to like their music more than I really did, but they totally put on a killer live show), Mother Mother are a truly unique band and their cross-generational relevance proves this.

---

#they've got a gun

**qazz23** (11): I like the upbeat and dancey sound of this

**2dina3dworld** (10): anyone who gives this a bad score, you better run 👀

**bigbigbee** (10): God I bet this is amazing live. There’s so much chill or otherwise vibe-y stuff on this rate playlist, and a lot of it is really good, but it was nice to have something like this that’s just a shot of pure energy.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): that refrain is so damn sticky

**celladonn** (10): It goes off

**cremeebrulee** (10): smash!

**intheaftermath** (10): thank you for your service to the edgy tumblr kids

**jman457** (10): this song slaps hard, makes me nostalgic for 2000’s alt rock

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh WOW this is catchy af

**tinaoe** (10): listen as if i'd rate any mother mother song lower

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (9.5): the NRA has nothing on this

**cheatviathan** (9): So TikTok is just handing out streams to decade old indie rock songs that no one has heard of? Cool. I do love the guitar leads, and the vocals are eccentric enough to where I can forgive the repetition. It sounds just as frantic and as harrowing as the subject matter, and that is worth praise.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): it slaps I’m sorry it does

**GARjuna** (9): fucks

**pig-serpent** (9): Ok that riff slaps!

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): i’ve never heard a mother mother song in my life but this bangs

**rslashpoopheads** (9): c-can I see it? :flushed:

**schwiftydude047** (9): this hits different when you’re on a serious gaming streak.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): umm this song is kinda hot 😳

**seanderlust** (8.9): the guitars go off, but the lyrics are a bit repetitive

**camerinian** (8.5): I yearn for the Tony Hawk game this was clearly on in some alternate universe

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): yeah digging TikTok's taste in alternative sounds

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): this sounds like die antwoord

**best-american-record** (8): again repetitive but the beat saves it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if i was 14 i would try perfecting this on guitar hero so hard and that is a compliment.

**Iris3271** (8): This song definitely grew on me, I love the guitar

**teenwitches** (8): the bass on this is excellent

**whatsanillinois** (8): canadian alt-radio-core

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): It's catchy. Very of-its-time indie, but I can't hate it.

**2RINITY** (7.5): Starts strong, but I wish it developed its ideas a little better as it went along

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): this is the British pumped up kicks

**bluepupz** (7.5): I love the guitars here! Since there was a long intro, I was actually kinda hoping this would straight up be an instrumental lol. Do you think this person's daddy's got a gun? Unclear, I would say.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): all the other kids with the pumped up kicks… do the IPR rate!!!

**steelstepladder** (7.5): Don't be silly haylofts don't really exist

**1998tweety** (7): this is...interesting

**arhmaer** (7): who tf turned this into a tiktok song omg

**bbfan132** (7): fun

**rickikardashian** (7): isnt that the taylor swift x harry styles ship name?

**skargardin** (7): this was pretty fun honestly

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyo24c6/

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.7): "Pumped Up Kicks" on crack. Amazing.

**avg-vag** (6.5): canadian content laws strike again

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (6.5): The fast pacing works in its favor, but some parts are simply grating.

**kreddit2** (6.2): oh god the instrumental intro was so promising (like 8.5+ good) (very franz ferdinand if they tried to make a song for Dance Dance Revolution) but then they started singing.......

**aestheticen** (6): I also do not hate this.... what does this say about me?

**flibbityflob** (5.7): I'm not an alt-rock person at all, but at least Mother Mother make stuff that's actually close to music. God I sound old.

**just\_thonking** (5.5): I don't hate it but I also hope to never listen to it again

#who tf is Hayloft even

**hikkaru** (5): this hook is annoying asf

**ProfeNeuro** (5): ohhh, it’s THAT song. This feels like the kind of song you’d hear playing at a Chipotle, sandwich right between Clairo and a Spanish cover song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): alternative kids on tiktok be “like my taste in music is pretty obscure you probably wouldnt know it” and then play this fucking song

**welcome2thejam** (5): Oh yeah, this is definitely late 2000s indie pop rock. This is the type of shit that I'd listen to a few times since they were at Lollapalooza or something, and then would convince myself for the next few months that I really like them, but by next year it's like "The fuck are the Ting Tings still doing on my iPod?"

**slimboyfriend** (4.1): This mixing is horrendous

**throwaway7650** (4): "GUN GAGAGAGAGA" conservatives responding to the question "what do you think of the ARTPOP chanteuse"

**Verrem** (4): it was good and then they decided to start singing

**ImADudeDuh** (3): why did this one have to be the biggest hit of that summer where they had like 4 different songs get big

**runaway3212** (3): I feel like my ex-friend group would like this song

**sssaaage** (3): ok it bopped at first but as it kept going on their voices get so annoying and it never ends

**xavieryes** (2): i was ready to give it a 10, then those insufferable vocals came in

**AHSWeeknd** (1): British people!!1!

**brenda\_official** (1): mother mother worst band of all time

**Hulnia** (1): The soundtrack of all the most annoying people I know, the amount of fucking people with shitty outfits using this song were so annoying. 

 That chorus haunts my fucking nightmares too, why could it not have at least been one of their good songs?

**IIIHenryIII** (1): This is annoying.

**plastichaxan** (1): i hate the bit of tiktok that led me to believe this was a good song or that mother mother was a good band

**thedoctordances1940** (1): just shut the fuck up, please

**stryxen** (0): no this song actually makes me want to throw up i despise it

**wavingwolves** (0): OF ALL THE MOTHER MOTHER SONGS TO GO VIRAL.... IT HAD TO BE THIS???W THIS??????? one of the worst chorus i've ever heard, actually... it drives me insane and then it loops itself like a bunch of times it's like it's never going to end and then i have to pay attention to the time it lasts and think about what else i did today and notice i didn't really do anything of constructive and even so i feel like this song is wasting my time

we will simply choose to ignore the straight Tiktok trend that even Absofacto called out and found disgusting (n) What a bop! It's one of those songs that sneak up on ya and really keeps you coming back, with its absolute earworm of a hook and super slick production. Unfortunately, one of the trends attached to this song was... gross, to say the least, and as the host of this rate I cannot give the song the full 10 it would have gotten because that trend impacted my enjoyment of the song so much. But, I still do bop to it occasionally, so it's not a total loss!

---

#loves chemistry

**2dina3dworld** (10): I know this as that one where people used it for weird daddy - daughter incestous POVs and the artist was rightly offended by it so a lot of big Tik tokkers used the sound specifically to kick those videos off the top videos for this sound. Anyway, this bangs and I’m so glad it’s reputation was fixed.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This song is fire! Kinda reminds me of a Beck song, in a good way lol. Glad I got to discover this song and I'll be checking them out.

**intheaftermath** (10): :)

**seanderlust** (10): I love the instruments in the background of the bridge

**steelstepladder** (10): The hold this had on tik tok...

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.3): i really like this!!!

**bigbigbee** (9): This song has a really good synthesis of lyrics with its sound – I think there’s a very flowy, “watery” quality to this that’s really pleasant and serves to make the whole song a great complete experience.

**bluepupz** (9): This is great! I may add this to my own playlists. It's really catchy and I think the backing vocals during the chorus work well.

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): i remember listening to this song when it came out and now you’re telling me the current sad high schoolers still listen to it??

**RandomHypnotica** (9): it's an iconic sound, that hook is fantastic and it's light and fun, feels very Foster the People

**schwiftydude047** (9): I’m usually not complaining when this pops up on the alternative station.

**best-american-record** (8.6): beautiful song

**aestheticen** (8.5): Well I like this at first listen... I might hate it in a couple of months, who knows?

**kreddit2** (8.5): i love this song and had this on replay pre-rate . i just think it's really polished without sounding over-produced.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): another pleasant indie pop song that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but is reminiscent of the glorious indie/alt pop scene in the late 00s/early 10s

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this is the rare song that improves from just listening to its trendiest 15 seconds

**cheatviathan** (8): I must say, this is certainly one of the more unconventional instrumentals in this rate. The chopped up samples in the verses, the guitars in the chorus, the lo-fi drums, the pianos and synth buildup in the bridge. It feels as uneasy and unsure as the science metaphors that Jonathan Visger invokes. Good discovery.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): see this is what i wish these tiktok easy listening songs sounded like! There’s still interesting stuff in it but it’s mainly just vibes!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): didn’t know this was a tik tok trend but it’s a good song so I like it

**jasannn** (8): Me to my bath bombs

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): $20 for 1mg is too high, my man

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I'm surprised nobody has done a mashup of this with "Scarlet Fire" yet considering how similar they sound.

**rickikardashian** (8): tiktok loves to call absolutely anyone an industry plant, but they cant recognize a marketing tactic if it hit them in the face. the original singer posted a video like “there’s some weird daddy pov videos under this sound🥺🥺 let’s drown them out by posting many more videos with this sound”......and then people fell for it and did it. it was actually unreal

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoLS7F/

**throwaway7650** (8): this song should be called vibe instead of the other in in the rate

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): oh, this is a nice little chill jam. love the vibe

**Uberpigeon** (8): i was the wendy williams listening to music gif when this started playing

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): don't have much to say about this, it's just good

**bbfan132** (7.5): v pleasant

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Instrumental is pretty good, but I'm not sure if they perishing indie rock vocals are working for me. They're not bad, I just think the song would stand out more if the vocals had more of an impact.

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**2RINITY** (7): This is like somebody took an Adult Swim bump from 2007 and developed it into a full song. I can get behind it

**AHSWeeknd** (7): oh this is that song?

**camerinian** (7): Love this groove, hate the way he goes “in a pOOoOoOOoOol”

**rslashpoopheads** (7): cool

**stryxen** (7): very good! weird trend it blew up with!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The most disappointing thing about this rate was finding out that all these songs that I’ve heard on my local alt radio station were only there because of tiktok…

**jman457** (6.6): dig the production, not much beyond that though

**flibbityflob** (6): The acoustic is so much better, genuinely a song I come back to a lot. The full version is okay, but I don't like it as much.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Only decent. But consider it a big feather in its cap that it can still rate a 6 despite its' use in heavily played commercials, a very easy pathway to my hate list.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): it's not terrible but like this definitely isn't really interesting

#hates chemistry, possibly anti science

**runaway3212** (5): Chemistry is for losers

**ProfeNeuro** (4.9): so this tops Billboard’s Alternative Charts (for two weeks), but “Kyoto” by Phoebe Bridgers can’t even get in the top 20 of said list?

**wavingwolves** (4.9): i remember the context about this song and the trend it followed which makes it memorable bc it does highlight a specific problem w tiktok/social media of stripping things of its meaning but the song is kind of painfully mid in itself

**plastichaxan** (4.5): "this isn't what i signed up for" me doing this rate and disliking half the songs

**duochromepalmtree** (4): I would never chose to listen to this song. This is my first time hearing the verses and I don’t like what I hear! But like all songs in this rate it has one catchy part that is perfect for tik tok.

**xavieryes** (3): this song sure sounds like it's dissolving

**IIIHenryIII** (2): Unremarkable and easily forgettable.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i dont know how to describe it but this song is everything i hate about modern “alternative” “rock”

**arhmaer** (1): i'm so old

**sssaaage** (1): horrid. absolutely horrid.

I still hold strong that, had it not been for the pandemic, this remix would have been #1 for at least two weeks 

This absolute BANGER of a remix! Really, I'd say this and Dynero's "In My Mind" launched the slap house sound into the general public's mind which is awesome since it's quite a fun sound to mess around with. This dance trend was also so stupidly simple that it's fun, if that makes sense. It's a 'vibe', so to put it. That paired with a great song and this song has some fucking legs!

---

#TURN UP BABY, TURN UP WHEN I TURN IT UP

**awhile2** (11): this song wouldve gone number one if covid hadnt shut down the clubs

**camerinian** (11): I don't know if this is gonna get a lot of 11s because it's maybe not the most resonant piece of pop on this list, but holy fuck was this song a vital piece of my life in 2020. This soundtracked many a long late night drive home when all the clubs were shut and all my raver friends were locked behind a screen. I absolutely cannot get enough of that relentless thump of the kick, the way Saint Jhn's vocal line rides it effortlessly, nailing the rhythm and providing just the right amount of melody to keep it engaging, the way the bass line is rooted in funk but doesn't overpower the four to the floor hit, and I just adore how this song subverts the drop formula we're so used to and instead just gives enough of a chance to catch our breath before getting right back to the relentless energy. This song really rebooted my interest in house music and my search for that irresistible four to the floor rhythm, and I cannot praise it enough.

**xavieryes** (11): Every song called "Roses" is perfect by definition, and this is no exception. The whole vibe of this song is just perfect. It's amazing how it already feels nostalgic for me despite being so recent. Both SAINt JHN and Imanbek are incredible and underrated artists. Plus, it's not every day that you get to see a song by a Guyanese American remixed by a Kazakh producer blowing up like this one did so am I here for it.

**akanewasright** (10): I really, really like Imanbek as a producer. I have too many plays of his collaborative EP with a certain irrelevant superspreader because it made me feel like I was out of this world and made me forget my anxieties and tiredness during zoom classes last semester. This song started all of that, and is just as strong.

**Awkward\_King** (10): god i wanna hear this in the club

**celladonn** (10): There's something about this rhythm that just send me to another plane of existence

**cremeebrulee** (10): smash i stg if yall rob this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): people who think the original is superior are out of their minds imo

**GARjuna** (10): I danced to this song all the time in early pandemic. Sad to have there be an 'early pandemic.' I really thought this would only last a couple months at the time

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is one of the songs I associate with the beginning of COVID and it’s a bop but I can’t stop thinking about March 2020 with this

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic but also the original is so good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): even my non-mainstream-listening bff thinks this is a bop

**skargardin** (10): Imanbek really snapped here

**wavingwolves** (10): this is such a song to listen on the uber back home after getting fucked up

**aestheticen** (9.5): It's still so funny to me that this remix was first made illegally and it just randomly went viral on VKontakte lol

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9.5): idk if this is unpopular, but this is an excellent song

**1998tweety** (9): this bops honestly

**bigbigbee** (9): I love how this song just…starts. It’s jarring, and it works really well, especially since this song has such a strong throughline.

**ReallyCreative** (9): wait we might have to add this to some playlists girls

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf11VXN/

**thedoctordances1940** (9): banger

**jman457** (8.7): we love a deep house hit, this goes hard

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I absolutely love the story behind this and how the random railroad worker in Kazakhstan who made the remix couldn't even get a reply from Saint Jhn on Instagram and ended making his song miles more popular than it otherwise would've been

**matthewc20090** (8.5): THIS IS A JAM

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): honestly a guilty pleasure song

**cheatviathan** (8): One thing I’ve learned from listening to metric tons of French house is that a good bass groove is a key ingredient in making electronic music appealing to me. This track has that, as well as some oddly placed breakdowns and a catchy vocal melody. Great shit.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): The pitching is a liiiittle grating but this does KNOCK. Despite the simplicity, it's a damn good beat.

**pig-serpent** (8): I love the groove on this song and I can see myself popping it on every once in a while for the foreseeable future.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Instant banger from the very first second. I don't think Imanbek ever came close to topping this.

**ProfeNeuro** (8): Who knew that a remix of a fairly unknown 2016 song from a guy from Kazakhstan would end up being one of the biggest hits of 2020?

**schwiftydude047** (8): this would be really fun to dance to in the club.

**vayyiqra** (8): bop

**welcome2thejam** (8): Helluva banger. Don't know any of his other songs, but honestly hope he gets some sort of other hit, just cause it makes me infinitely sad to see someone get a big mainstream success off a song they can't even perform in that way

**bluepupz** (7.5): This is a nice remix and a fun song! This just reminds me of dancing in a club/at parties in college.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7.5): what the fuck is she saying

**throwaway7650** (7.5): weird altered vocals... wasted instrumental like ride it

**2dina3dworld** (7): sorry but the Chainsmokers did it better

**2RINITY** (7): Oh yeah it's that deep house song

**jasannn** (7): Chainsmokers outsold

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): Big H&M soundtrack energy but ngl it bops!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): it’s great as a tiktok sound, but as a full song it got super repetitive REAL quick

**stryxen** (6.5): eek

**hephaestionline** (6): the Chainsmokers did it better

**Hulnia** (6): Yet another exception to my thoughts on the state of EDM, although I do prefer the original and Future versions.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): The beat is pretty sick, but the voice effect is annoying af. I can't stand it!

**jsonphile** (6): this is the most tiktok song to exist. Just a catchy hook for about thirty seconds but gets kinda repetitive to listen to for a whole song. Literally any time I would hear this on the radio I would listen for about thirty seconds thinking “yeah this kinda catchy” and then get bored with it. So it’s very clear why it’s popular on tiktok

**runaway3212** (6): the opening is terrible but the rest of the song is slightly okay somehow

**steelstepladder** (6): I liked this song when it came out but I just got the biggest wave of anti-nostalgia to hear a song I so closely associate with the beginning of the pandemic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): would never listen to it in my own time but if i was out at a party and it came on i would probably enjoy it

**TiltControls** (5.5): love the production, could do without the vocals

**veryanniev** (5.5): may not be my cup of tea but I really love the fact that it made a regular guy from Kazakhstan a Grammy-winner. good for him.

**sssaaage** (4.5): its fine but like every song like this sounds the same

**bbfan132** (4): boring

**best-american-record** (4): it’s okay

**flibbityflob** (4): Again, I just feel nothing. Is this playlist induced apathy or does TikTok have awful taste.

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): sounds like they’re wilted… hahaha I’m so clever

**tinaoe** (2): this got played at the club last week and it Did Not Work

**AHSWeeknd** (1): I can’t stand this, it’s just, why.

**duochromepalmtree** (1): I am so so sick of hearing this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): poor roses but this fucking song brings me to the worst parts of quarantine and even worse, when there was like 3 songs on the radio only

This literally sounds like the most generic late 2020s indie pop, I do not have a single clue what to actually write about this. I vaguely remember the Tiktok trend, which was cute, but I cannot think of anything else to write about. How this was one of the 24 songs to scrape by with an average above 7 is beyond me, quite honestly.

---

#fyi it was brought to my attention Frances uses they / them, so I tried to edit the comments and reflect that :)

---

#LOVES space

**2dina3dworld** (10): “are you a cancer, because you make me sick” is mildly problematic, but otherwise this is a cute lil bop that also used to follow STFU! in my playlist

**qazz23** (10): Nice dreamy indie pop sound, love the outro

**steelstepladder** (9.9): See!!! I can think objectively and not give every song with lesbians a 10!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): You got that Mitski bump, Frances, I see you! But in the slew of bedroom pop singers I stay slandering, they have the best voice by a wide margin. Finally a bedroom pop singer who can sing, some fucking food. It's a charming song. Mitski notwithstanding I really like this song. The singing, harmonies, production, melody, all there! An indie pop artist TRYING on Tik Tok!!!!! It's giving what Backyard Boy is trynna give. I guess I'm gonna get in fights now lol.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): The Adventures of Space Girl and Backyard Boy

**TiltControls** (9.5): space is scary

**aestheticen** (9): Liking the vibes on this

**akanewasright** (9): The ending makes me feel like that gif of the hedgehog floating

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (9): friend of mine once told me that I have a lesbian mindset and I could not agree more

**wavingwolves** (8.7): 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩

**bbfan132** (8.5): :listening: i enjoyed this quite a bit

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Happy to see Mitski influencing new artists like that stage name! This is breezy, I like the mood swing through the second verse and I dig the higher register! The bridge is a sedated moment of A World Alone whatever.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): a serve

**sssaaage** (8.5): really cute actually.. the bridge is so ascend

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.3): The outro to this is the aural definition of "we ascending".

**1998tweety** (8): this is nice

**educationalmirror** (8): Sofia and space girl back to back, yes sapphics, come through

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is pretty good

**ImADudeDuh** (8): nice lesbian song

**pig-serpent** (8): I like this one and it was a great move to switch up the second half of the song and it has lesbians in it but my brain is hung up on the part where it doesn't sound like it's in space.

**plastichaxan** (8): probably my only discovery this rate dsfljdsfk i like this

**runaway3212** (8): I will be nice to this, it's nice

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1B7tF/

**tinaoe** (8): i love space i love girls why not

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This sounds pretty chill… I like it

**waluigiest** (8): this sounds like im early to a bar concert and this is the most memorable song from the first opener

**jman457** (7.7): isnt Francis Forever a mitski song

**seanderlust** (7.7): it's fun and cute but that's about all I feel for it. but it's extremely fun and cute so i'll be nice

**2RINITY** (7.5): Deftly avoids becoming yet another piece of car commercial indie rock with some quality percussion and being too gay for even Subaru to try and license it

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): The tiktok part of this song is my least favorite part

**flibbityflob** (7.3): It's good! i enjoy upbeat pop

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): stream francis forever by mitski

**best-american-record** (7): cute song

**bluepupz** (7): I thought the slowed down part at the end was the bridge but then it just kept on going and then the song ended. Whoops!

**cheatviathan** (7): Solid enough indie rock tune with space imagery and a cool bassline. The more ethereal tone of the final minute is a cool way to close out the track.

**GARjuna** (7): It's Fine I Guess. What do people do to this song on tiktok???? do they sway gently like palm fronds?????

**hephaestionline** (7): good vibes only

**schwiftydude047** (7): fits the lofi aesthetic quite well.

**ProfeNeuro** (6.4): i wanted space song smh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this song has zodiac rate energy

**duochromepalmtree** (6): dreamy and sweet but I’m still meh about it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): sounds like every other indie girl with a guitar song

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): frog play space ghost coast to coast featuring bree runway

#space SUCKS

**kreddit2** (5): kind of unfortunate that this is right after sofia bc i feel like it's the same topic and they have similar-ish voices. i think sofia's better though

**xavieryes** (5): cute but i can't bring myself to like it

**throwaway7650** (4.5): it's tiktok indie pop: the re-up #5 or whatever, wouldn't listen to this outside of the rate. love the homage to mitski in their name though!

**arhmaer** (4): white queers are really something huh (i'm allowed to say that i'm bitches)

**avg-vag** (4): not like other manic pixie cottagecore vsco girls energy encapsulated in song

**AHSWeeknd** (3): I’m sorry what are these vocals.

**intheaftermath** (3): this gives off "i'm so quirky!!! space!!!" vibes

**rslashpoopheads** (3): snoozer

**IIIHenryIII** (2): This is just plain boring.

I have a special attachment to this trend, as it was one of the audios I first had a viral video with. It was such a stupid post and I'm pretty sure I have it privated by now, but this song will forever hold a special place in my heart because of that song so I was very happy to see it get voted in. :) ~~It's also an absolute smash of a song, so.~~

**tinaoe** (9): by virtue of being Queer alone

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I was prepared to hate this song cause Serotonin is one of the most annoying songs I’ve heard in a while, but this is so pretty and ethereal! And gay!!

**duochromepalmtree** (8.8): a very beautiful and romantic song

**jman457** (8.5): Drakes new fav song <3

**cheatviathan** (7): Solid enough indie rock tune with some cool guitar leads. Other songs in this rate and in this genre do more for me, but this still has merit. I’m surprised by how much indie rock representation there is in this rate

**flibbityflob** (7): am i a bad lesbian for not liking this all that much? no, lesbians of the internet, i do not listen to girl in red.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.7): Pretty vibey.

#HATES October, possibly anti-Christian girl autumn

**GARjuna** (5): unfortunately being a sapphic doesn't stop this song from putting me to sleep

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why tf does she say “my girl, my girl, my girl, mY girl” like that?

**kreddit2** (5): this song + sofia + space girl has given me the impression that there is a lot of wlw content on tiktok. i support this!! but not this song which is more background music

**my friend Ethan** (5): billy eichner voice: LET'S GO LESBIANS LET'S GO

**ProfeNeuro** (5): we fell in love in a hopeless place WE FLEW A KITE IN A PUBLIC PLACE

**Roxieloxie** (5): gen z on god we gon find yall an interesting wlw artist to stan

b_o_g_o_: how did maneskin ~~and yucky blucky fruitcake~~ make day three

edit: okay so I'm sorry for the score I gave YBF, I was in a hurry when I did the rate and didn't like the first part of the song so I gave it a 3, when it's actually pretty good and has a lot of memorable moments (you forgot to take the chicken out, the only exception interpolation, the line about fucking in 6th grade)
