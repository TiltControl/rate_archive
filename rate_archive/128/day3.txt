Uberpigeon: giving my energy to Little Dark Age and Runaway 🙌

=====

steelstepladder: The Box, Slow Dancing In The Dark, Little Dark Age, Flamingo, Mystery Of Love, and Otherside take my energy!

Maneskin… why are you still here?

Edit: Oh! Stay With Me would also be a great winner. Forgot about that one

b_o_g_o_: okay here's my (definitely wrong) prediction for top 5, in no particular order: stay with me, little dark age, wap, drivers license, and mystery of love

CrimsonROSET: the only thing that needs my energy is jesus is the one and if it doesnt win the bonus rate i will truly know popheads has lost all sense of taste

Hulnia: Can we get Little Dark Age, WAP, Sofia, The Box and Flamingo as our Top 5 please? :)

And get I Wanna Be Your Slave and especially driver’s license out here. 😩

welcome2thejam: Top 5 predictions: WAP, Little Dark Age, Yori ni Kakeru, Slow Dancing in the Dark, The Box

That said, I'm honestly less invested in the main rate winner as much as Jesus Is The One winning bonus. If *that* gets robbed it's unforgivable

**sean:** And here, sadly, we ruin Jenny's friendship with the #1 spot. The virtual band Studio Killers kind of went off with this one - the Europop/steel drum combo works surprisingly well and the lyrics tell a heartwarming story of a wlw with a crush and a kleptomania problem. On TikTok, the song was incorporated into the #RuinOurFriendship trend, where users snapped their friends/mutuals/randoms that kept hitting them up the lyrics to the song to ask them out. The resulting videos were TikTok hits that ranged from uncomfortable to watch to deeply uncomfortable to watch! Though shoutout to the girl who responded to the "there's a few things that you don't know" lyric with "do u have depression." Bold assumption. Hope she's having a good day.

#wants to ruin your friendship

**GARjuna** (11): found this song bc Youtube Algorithm when I first figured out I was into women and it was a really big deal for me. I would watch the video over and over and feel seen.

**vayyiqra** (11): This is one of the best pop songs I've ever heard and I'm glad a new generation has rediscovered it. It also makes me deeply melancholy. : (

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**AHSWeeknd** (10): more pop songs should have accordions

**akanewasright** (10): akanewassapphic ~~this is a joke I’m literally not~~

**arhmaer** (10): the kids are appropriating my culture

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): it's gay, I love it

**best-american-record** (10): YES

**camerinian** (10): Songs like this are the reason I keep doing rates, cos I’d never heard this song before this rate, and yet I feel like it’s always been in my life. This is just astonishingly perfect pop from head to toe, from that immediate opening synth melody to that fucking huge, euphoric chorus and the lyrics with just the right balance between aching personal details and huge universal longing sentiment. Shoutout to all the young queer kids who are gonna have this soundtracking their first romances, I honestly couldn’t imagine a better anthem for them.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): normalize discovering your sexuality through being obsessed with your “platonic” besties!!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): aaaaahhhhhhhhhh

**jman457** (10): An certified bop, early 2010’s europop with sad boi vocalist is actual pop perfection

**pig-serpent** (10): I was wondering what all the hype was about but once this clicked it really clicked.

**ReallyCreative** (10): normalize toxic romantic friendships

**runaway3212** (10): We have to admire her confidence and the sapphic stuff stealing

**seanderlust** (10): come on millennium-era europop-inspired lesbian banger!!!!

**skargardin** (10): I need everyone to stream their self-titled album NOW for front to back BOPS!!

**stryxen** (10): yass!

**xavieryes** (10): i'm a sucker for this kind of production

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): the late 90's europop synth/accordian thing is kinda crazy but it also works?

**cremeebrulee** (9): me listening to this at age 17 w absolutely no critical thinking skills and not realizing i liked girls yet: omg why do i love this song so much brrr

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): would be a 10 but the fact that the singer of studio killers is actually a dude which makes this song queerbait ruins it for me

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9): I think this song is great but every video on this trend made me cringe

**aestheticen** (8.5): Nice production

**celladonn** (8.5): The Kim Petras version is a 10 unfortunately

**2RINITY** (8): Production's a little overstuffed in some areas, but at the same time, LET'S GO LESBIANS HERE WE GO LESBIANS COME ON LET'S GO LESBIANS

**bluepupz** (8): Have I heard this before for a meme video or something?? Feels somehow familiar, idk. I like this though!

**Iris3271** (8): Out of all the sapphic songs in this rate this one rings the most true

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyopQdm/

**Uberpigeon** (8): vote for fictional musicians rate next cycle yass!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I want what they have

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): It'a a fun bop, but I am not a big fan of the singing voice, especially in the chorus.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): not a fan of the voice, but this slaps i fear

**astrologicalangel** (7): this song is so good but it also brings back some of my cringest memories

**bbfan132** (7): let’s ruin the friendship (by demi lovato)

**bigbigbee** (7): I kept thinking that this was the sea shanty when I first heard the intro to this song.

**cheatviathan** (7): One of my favorite guilty pleasure genres in europop fused with a genre I’m allergic to in tropical house, and the end results meet somewhere in the good end of the spectrum. I think it’s the driving drumbeat, the accordion, and the synth tones that win me over here. Solid song. Would listen to again if it came on.

**flibbityflob** (7): lesbian anthem! we stan. as someone who's ruined their friendships for the sake of pussy, it's not worth it honey.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the singer “I don’t know how to say this” also the singer “I wanna ruin our friendship, we should be lovers instead”… sounds like you know exactly what to say

**intheaftermath** (7): no thoughts just the god awful The Living Tombstone remix of this song which made it about a stalker :(

**jackisboredtoday** (7): kinda bops but 8675309 mops in the battle of the Jenny songs

**kreddit2** (7): interesting

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Neat little bop. On a related note, there's a photo of me from when I was like 14 wearing a shirt with their logo on it with my brother and my nan that's still hanging in her house to this day. I don't think I have that shirt around anymore, shame.

**ProfeNeuro** (7): why does this sound like the kind of song to soundtrack a just dance game? also obligatory “jenny was a friend of mine”, and obligatory “this is an LGBTQ+ anthem”

**rslashpoopheads** (7): anyone remember that one song that was kinda popular in the 2010s with the accordion what was it called haha I really need to know wait it was um wait EDWARD MAYA?!

**schwiftydude047** (7): the tropical inspired beat is really fun.

**throwaway7650** (7): don't really like the vocals

**hephaestionline** (6): I'm gonna use this space to mention the superior TikTok trend, the kiss your best friend challenge (audio is Electric Love by BØRNS)

**whatsanillinois** (6): OMG sent this to my friend on snapchat and she thought i liked her blushing emoji.

#wants to keep it

**slimboyfriend** (5.9): I keep thinking the main riff will go into that Stereo Love song

**steelstepladder** (5.7): Love again this is not

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): It sounds like an indie girl fronting Cascada.

**Awkward\_King** (4): me

**CrimsonROSET** (4): honestly if someone did this to me it would ruin our friendship

**sssaaage** (4): its fine

**wavingwolves** (3.7): god i hope i never have to listen to this again

**HogwartsReject1912** (3): Garbage song. But my friend made a TikTok with this song that got him a lot of followers so I'll give it something higher than 1.

**nootnoot781** (3): i would want to ruin a friendship if one of my mates made a song this dull

**Verrem** (2): the beat is kind of fun but the vocals are atrocious

**my friend Ethan** (1.1): NO

**2dina3dworld** (1): I never got the appeal of this song, I’m sorry.

**tinaoe** (1): this beat is my nemesis

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (0): no I don't care shut the fuck up please stop talking I hate this song. the Tiktok trend for this made it be this bad

**cam:** Perhaps the most unexpected breakthrough act of 2021, Måneskin were a surprising hard rock winner of Eurovision, and then had an even more surprising pair of hits cross over to the English-speaking market who normally couldn't give a rat's about Eurovision. While their Beggin' cover has gone stratospheric, I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE is maybe more emblematic of the band's core appeal, which, if a brief scan of the song's TikTok page is any indication, is H O R N Y.

The 'cock' in 'cock rock' is really in full swing here (sorry), and this is essentially an anthem for the chaotic, community guidelines tightrope walking kinksters who are a surprisingly significant audience on the platform. Of course, appropriately for that audience, this song WHIPS and/or SLAPS (again, sorry). While Måneskin's aesthetic is very classic glam, the song is also rooted in a sort of late-2000s dance-rock swagger, with the four-to-the-floor kick giving the thirsty delivery a real bite, leading in to the wild fills and roaring guitar solo underneath the chorus. While the full-frontal (OK maybe I'm not sorry) presentation might be a bit much for some, I'm all for it, and I'm hoping this band stick around long enough past the pandemic to rip shit up live.

#horny for Italian bisexuals

**2RINITY** (11): We stan one (1) Italian polycule

**inesmina** (11): Maneskin is the shit

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**2dina3dworld** (10): as a law student, I do agree that lawyers need redemption. Snakes, all of them (including me)

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck me

**camerinian** (10): Måneskin have somehow made me go through Sexual Awakening 2 Erotic Boogaloo even though I already knew I was bi, how does that happen

**CrimsonROSET** (10): can this style of music become like mainstream please

**hephaestionline** (10): I'm just a hole

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): MANESKIN WORLD DOMINATION (Also can we do a Eurovision rate? Or at least a winner's rate?)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i'm a eurovision addict so i feel like i'm obliged to give this a 10

**shhhneak** (10): Damiano David makes me whore knee. ANYWAYS Eurovision hits different when your favourite actually wins. I can’t wait to see them blow up.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): vote for 21st century eurovision next rate cycle

**teenwitches** (10): i'm a sucker for a dirty bass line

**tinaoe** (10): i'm a European queer who loves eurovision did i have a choice

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): oh WOW i kinda love this

**xavieryes** (10): I wasn't big on Måneskin, including this song, until doing the rate, but relistening quite a few times, it's grown on me a lot

**BoneStreetSand** (9.5): But can you suck my toes like Tokyo’s Revenge, Damiano???

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): as much as I wish Zitti E Buoni was the song that blew up instead I can't deny that this is a banger. Love it.

**aestheticen** (9): Sexy Italian Man

**cheatviathan** (9): Okay. This is actually a well-constructed rock song whose grooves and guitar tones remind me of Franz Ferdinand and early Arctic Monkeys, and those vocals are certainly unique and have bite to them. Also, including a cowbell in your song in any capacity earns you a point in my book. One of my favorite discoveries of the rate.

**GARjuna** (9): not the best maneskin song by a long shot but the vid is O.O and also the song is good. In general I think maneskin is a lot more interesting in their Italian songs and I hope that the themes and ideas they have worked with in previous material stick around as they get bigger. Also v happy with my current place in horny jail!! Ethan if ur free hmu <3 <3 <3

**MrMoodle** (9): i wanna hate this because their faces on their spotify page look so deeply punchable but goddamn does it slap

**throwaway7650** (9): don't really like the guy's voice but the production is fantastic. but I must admit the stylistic vocal choices are great

**bluepupz** (8.5): This is great. I'm living for the rock and roll, and I know absolutely nothing about Eurovision but congrats to them for winning that!

**arhmaer** (8): horny italians are the only italians that deserve rights. the rest of their discography goes SO hard but y'all keep SLEEPING on it bc of the language diff. shame shame shame shame

**ImADudeDuh** (8): you know what, I appreciate that the background for this song on spotify mobile is the lyrics of the songs. Work smarter not harder to bring back lyrics on spotify.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): pop off, Italian bisexuals

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I definitely like the melodic hook that runs throughout this song, but I wish this song wasn't called "I Wanna Be Your Slave", let alone have the lyrics "I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master". Couldn't we have rated "Beggin'" instead?

**schwiftydude047** (8): this is very intimidating. but in the really good way.

**seanderlust** (8): the last twenty seconds of this slaps!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): beggin > this song but this does slap it just had a couple cringe lyrics

**sssaaage** (7.8): once i got used to his voice it bopped

**kreddit2** (7.5): very glam pretty rock i'm into it

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): the only things i know about this band are, they won eurovision, one of them mightve done coke during that live on air, they are maybe bi? or bi people are thirsting after that, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to cover black skinnhead of all songs??

**ProfeNeuro** (7.4): dont do it abbaham linkin didnt dye 4 dis noooooo

**akanewasright** (7): this song is interesting… it’s not bad in any way, but it is noticeably not sexy, especially for a song with this subject matter

**Hulnia** (7): The way he says fucking might be the best thing to happen to music.

**jsonphile** (7): I just can’t get into this band as much as I want to. I’m thrilled that a rock band is having so much success right now, but I just don’t really care for this song that much.

**nootnoot781** (7): damiano david... i will reserve my rights to comment

**nt96** (7): This and the I'd Rather Die track feels like they're responding to each other.

**ReallyCreative** (7): pretty weak compared to Beggin' but not that bad

**rslashpoopheads** (7): i listened to this and said wow it sounds like that one maneskin song and

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i like this song conceptually but the energy kinda dies part of the way through

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The lyrics are a bit… rough, but I won’t blame them too harshly for that, of course. And the music itself still kicks ass so hey!

**just\_thonking** (6.5): I like it I just wish it went somewhere

**veryanniev** (6.4): Damiano’s accent in this always throws me off. Why does he sound SO British? Also I really dislike how out of all of their discography people only ate up an uninspired cover and a song with English lyrics.

**bigbigbee** (6): I like this, but begrudgingly. It feels very clown car.

**runaway3212** (6): this song is overrated

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): i like them but this song is sooo mediocre

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoeuhK/

**welcome2thejam** (6): Grew on me. Keep expecting the chorus to go "But you could be the beauty and I could be the bastard" though and it's throwing me off

**cremee:** While lyrically quite straightforward (Sloane Struble, frontman of Dayglow, remarks that the song was a literal summary of the day he wrote it on), this song just sounds like a daydream. Between the hazy instrumental, Struble’s soft vocals, and the guitar strumming peeking throughout, this song soundtracks any wholesome tiktok perfectly, which explains why it isn’t tied down to any specific trend. While it’s more lowkey than a lot of the other frontrunners in the rate, it’s still a lovely song that deserves its [fill as needed @frog - it's day three lol] placement!

#you can!

**2dina3dworld** (10): help I didn’t know this was a Tik tok song lmaoooo I was recommended this by a friend, I’ve listened to it like 50 times and I never knew that it was Tik tok popular

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): OHHHH THIS IS SO FUCKING SMOOTH AND DREAMY I LOVE IT

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I've just discovered a new jam. OMG, this is amazing. I kinda want to give it my 11.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this just reminds me of pre-pandemic :(

**rickikardashian** (10): if nobody got me, i know *indie pop bands that drown their songs in reverb* got me. can i get an amen?

**TiltControls** (10): i prefer text

**welcome2thejam** (10): I'm a bit meh on Dayglow overall, but this and Close To You have set up shop in my brain for the past few months. Just an extremely fun dancetrack and an instant mood boost.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): this is exactly the type of song that would play on a commercial where people are playing at the beach in the summer and drinking ice cold fresh Coca Cola and I love it

**shhhneak** (9.5): No thoughts just dream pop vibes.

**1998tweety** (9): this is really nice

**hephaestionline** (9): "I missed the summer of 2020" vibes

**just\_thonking** (9): bop

**ReallyCreative** (9): I don't know if it does anything we haven't heard from this particular genre of soft alt pop rock but it's very pleasant and a bit of a standout in this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the best two door cinema club song that never was

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJEQ4Pe/

**tinaoe** (9): am i a sucker for yearning songs yes does this fit the bill yes

**jman457** (8.8): If I listened to this in middle school it would be in a playlist along with the plethora of other white boy bands that are featured in the Indie Pop Rate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): maybe this just sounds really good after the last song, but I’m vibing

**teenwitches** (8.5): y'all are sleeping on dayglow fr

**aestheticen** (8): Kinda got bored of it

**bluepupz** (8): I like this, but there's a sense of deja vu and idk what this reminds me of. Tbh it is entirely possible I've heard this before in like an ad or something.

**duochromepalmtree** (8): I have never heard this song in my life but I really liked it! Nothing revolutionary here but I could totally dance in my underwear to this.

**Hulnia** (8): Feels a lot shorter than it is, and it feels so happy and sad all the same time.

**jasannn** (8): My type of indie music.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): ugh i love this kinda indie pop rock

**throwaway7650** (8): love the beachy/dreamy vibe, very pleasant

**Uberpigeon** (8): i love shoegaze

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Out of all the songs from flash-in-the-pan artists that my local alt station plays, this is the one that I have the biggest soft spot for. What can I say? It’s vibey

**whatsanillinois** (8): sirius xmu-core

**flibbityflob** (7.6): This is really good, the first song on here I want to listen to again.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This one's neat but after a few listens it hasn't really wormed its way into my brain beyond the basic fact that it's bedroom pop vibe music.

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Close to You deserved to be their big hit

**ProfeNeuro** (7.2): i got an 8am tomorrow but you can call me tomorrow afternoon

**wavingwolves** (7.2): this is cute wait :howimlisteningnow:

**bbfan132** (7): cute enough

**GARjuna** (7): I don't use tiktok but a lot of this reminds me of the kind of stuff my friends listened to ~5 years ago

**runaway3212** (7): Do IPR!!!!

**schwiftydude047** (7): the 80s synth vibes are very satisfying.

**stryxen** (7): thank god a good song

**vayyiqra** (7): This is good but it's also just an Alvvays song with MGMT singing, or maybe that's why it's good

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): listenable but this could’ve ended earlier quite frankly

**slimboyfriend** (6.4): Maybe it's just because all these other songs are less than 3 minutes, but this song felt way too long

#you cannot

**2RINITY** (6): Yup, this sure sounds like it came from 2018

**AHSWeeknd** (6): No you may not.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): We’re sorry. You have reached a number that is disconnected or that is no longer in service.

**intheaftermath** (6): The intro was really nice, but it was just too long. Nothing about it felt distinctive after a while

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): this is the shapeless non-descript indie pop Spotify keeps shoving down my throat and while it's not bad.... i don't really have any desire to revisit it

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.4): Nah I'm good thanks. Is Friday arvo okay?

**astrologicalangel** (5): this made no impact on my life

**bigbigbee** (5): This type of music is usually my style but something about this just makes me want to be listening to its inspirations / predecessors?

**cheatviathan** (5): Nothing remarkable about this one. This is indie rock at its most boilerplate and devoid of ideas, and it’s especially galling considering the amount of good music within this genre that exists in this rate.

**kreddit2** (5): geez there are a lot of generic songs in this rate

**qazz23** (5): decent bedroom pop, feels like I've heard stuff like this 1000 times

**rslashpoopheads** (5): dayglow is so iconic

**plastichaxan** (4): this was just fine at first then got boring

**sssaaage** (3.5): i hate this type of indie pop sm literally every song sounds identical

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (3): this feels like stock music

**MrMoodle** (2): absolutely hate the vocal effects on this, completely ruins it, and the rest of it was only just BARELY okay in the first place

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): Something about bland, 80s vibe-y synth chill music makes me irrationally mad in 2021. Like DO SOMETHING. FEEL SOMETHING. I want to shake them! Slap them like I'm Cher in Moonstruck!

when I was tuning into the AOC Among Us livestream I was like "huh who is gonna play with her tonight" and then mxmtoon popped up and I was like "holy fuck it's the 'barbecue sauce on my titties person' hell yeah"

The disrespect to this Tiktok CLASSIC! This is one of those audios that randomly jumps into my head and always makes me happy. The most popular version of this song was the Lil Jon remix and it is still one of the funniest things I have heard in my life, I love it so much. Cannot believe y'all disrespected the queen mxmtoon like this, I will not stand for this slander!!!!!!!

---

#popular kid in high school

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i’m so predictable

**duochromepalmtree** (10): lyrically this song is honest and relatable and musically this song is relatively complex and sounds great. Who didn’t cry in their prom dress?!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): (prom) queen shit

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): stream dusk and dawn

**rickikardashian** (10): as the person that submitted this to the charity rate, im absolutely thrilled and terrified to see what this fucking community will do to her again. the least i can hope is that the people interested in tiktok and all the culture surrounding it are captivated by this and check more of mxmtoon’s music, because she genuinely is one of the best artists that has gained notoriety because of the app, and she deserves even more recognition than she has received.

**schwiftydude047** (10): yeah this is kinda how I felt during prom. it felt somewhat underwhelming after all those years of hype.

**vayyiqra** (10): :saduwu:

**aestheticen** (9): I don't hate this song but I am not sure why ukulele in music annoys me? Which is why I can never make up my mind on whether I like this song or not, but I guess I like it this time round :shrug:

**Awkward\_King** (9): this reminds me so vividly of a specific friend i have, who got obsessed with this song, and we'd always play it on the bus, and i just remember getting the bus back from college with her at like 7pm because we were waiting for the bus for like an hour and a half, looping this when we finally got seats, and i really miss that time in my life, as happy as i am right now

**ReallyCreative** (9): quite the bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): at least she got a song out of it

**stryxen** (9): this is just nice

**teenwitches** (9): the lil jon mashup would have been a 10

**throwaway7650** (8.5): better than I remembered! the way I had a mini mxmtoon phase... looking forward to whatever she does next!

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**2dina3dworld** (8): can’t relate, prom isn’t a thing here

**bluepupz** (8): This is really cute! It's youthful (as it should be, since she was like 17) without coming off as childish.

**flibbityflob** (8): FINALLY a song made for me. I'm a sucker for an indie girl, sue me.

**hephaestionline** (8): okay but pretty sure I know this song from a fanfic

**ProfeNeuro** (8): I have a feeling this is the kind of music that Spotify/AM would recommend to me if I gave up and put on a personalized “chill” playlist. Don’t blame it though, this is great.

**runaway3212** (8): I think this song sucks tbh

**steelstepladder** (8): Didn't go to prom so I have to take two points off

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1SowG/

**welcome2thejam** (8): Mxmtoon is firmly in my "this act hasn't clicked with me yet, but I'm still very much rooting for them" category, but I do really like this one. She sounds good in this full, bouncy pop production, and the chorus is a killer hook

**wavingwolves** (7.9): cute even though i usually hate ukelele music

**kreddit2** (7.7): this is v much a song i would have identified with in high school so it's a little discomforting but it's good!!

**akanewasright** (7.5): *barbecue sauce on my titties*

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute

**pig-serpent** (7.5): "This seems like a cool song, I think this could grow on me into something I really like" - me a few months ago before forgetting this song exists.

**2RINITY** (7): Somehow combines depressioncore and ukeleles, two things that normally suck shit, without being a pile of garbage. Clearly a talented songwriter behind this

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): good!

**BoneStreetSand** (7): Kinda nice but also very bland.

**Iris3271** (7): I, too, cried through prom

**nootnoot781** (7): this is cute

**Roxieloxie** (7): ily ricki

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’m not really a fan of people that sing like… this (I hope people know what I mean?? It’s like a very specific variation on the “bananies” voice lol), but this song is alright

**sssaaage** (6.5): cute !

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): her music is definitely cute but I just don't get much out of it

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): a sweet-sounding little bop

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): ok i was going to say this is mediocre but it actually has a very cute buildup

frogaranaman: #HATED prom. detests high schoolers

**bbfan132** (6): it’s ok

**cheatviathan** (6): I never went to prom, but my college friends who actually went have assured me that it’s overrated. I do still feel some regret from those days, and this song taps into my high school insecurities somewhat effectively. Really, the main thing stopping it from hitting me fully is that goddamn ukulele, which doesn’t match the dour mood of the rest of the song.

**intheaftermath** (6): ok radio disney <3

**just\_thonking** (6): a cute little tune

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (6): you're in high school? god, grow up

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): https://youtu.be/iJlVuZYA-J4

**TiltControls** (6): it's cute, but I just wish it did a little bit more

**waluigiest** (6): was this in another rate? I remember thinking the lyrics were so corny then and I still do

**bigbigbee** (5.5): This feels a little juvenile to me (in a bad way) and it’s not because of the subject matter even – the sentences and rhymes are so simple, almost like this is like…the first draft of the lyrics and she called it a day? “I guess I maybe had a couple expectations / Thought I'd get to them / but no I didn't” and “Feelings are all around” are especially awkward for me.

**GARjuna** (5): again so weird this stuff is popular now

**Hulnia** (5): To be honest, around the time this showed up, I was starting to get REALLY sick of bedroom pop, and while I’ve warmed up to the genre now, this still really bores me. 

 At least the verses are kinda relatable. 😳

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): the cutesy twinkly ukelele vibe doesn't really work for me. I appreciate the sentiments behind the song but I feel like this is just Teen Idle but not done as well

**jman457** (4.8): this song just gives “Not like other girls” who plays the ukulele who is actually kind of a arrogant bitch

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.4): Meh.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): snoozer

**AHSWeeknd** (1): I feel like a lot of people will give this a ten

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): Again feels like AI scraping old tumblr posts. NORMALIZE CRITIQUING BORING BEDROOM POP. If this ukelele-vibes song came out in 2009 and y'all found it now you'd be roasting this song.

**arhmaer** (0): this is the exact kind of like - really juvenile, trite stuff that tends to define tiktok in my experience. i really don't know what else to expect from a platform so dominated by young ppl, there's nothing really specifically wrong with it - it just gets so horribly tired the second you get some distance from high school, you know? i'm not sure if i would have liked it in high school, but i was annoying then too lol. not as sonically offensive as some of the other songs on this rate, but it's that truly juvenile shallow quality + the horribly generic sound of it that just utterly defines one of the worst music trends i've witnessed in my life

#that is the antithesis of this entire rate

**IIIHenryIII** (5): No replay value.

Эта песня - настоящий боп, и я так горжусь тем, насколько хорошо она получилась. Много боли - это сама любовь, основная система хранения. В горле, а не на заднем дворе, у экологического эроса, мягкой постели. Автор нескольких пластов в долине. Pellentesque обитатель morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Maecenas cursus orci justo, convallis elementum nunc congue eu. Fusce lacinia dapibus tincidunt. Целочисленный диаметр волутпат в gravida hendrerit. Mauris nibh lorem, laoreet eget arcu eu, elementum accumsan justo. Раньше в постели лежал самый первый слой траура и мстительной боли.

#I trust these people with my life

**2dina3dworld** (11): Fun fact: I first heard this song on a video about ethnic groups in Russia. I like how the translated lyrics tell a dreary story of pessimism, in contrast to the upbeat, danceable music. Even better is how without the translation, you can still glean the contrast from the vocalist’s tone. It reminds me a lot of Joy Division and New Order, which considering both are two of my favourite bands than it’s no wonder this got my 11.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): we should do a Russian pop rate, this is so good.

**camerinian** (10): Jesus Christ just get me back to art school parties at shockingly uninhabitable houses with nine people living in them and just enough of a lounge space for a dancefloor with only the red hue emanating from the turned-off TV and a shitty default visualizer playing off a MacBook screen lighting us. That is and will always be the vibe

**cheatviathan** (10): I never would have expected to hear a rock song from Russia that gives me heavy Joy Division vibes with anti-suicide sentiments in this rate, but here we are, and it hits differently than a lot of the other rock tracks in this rate. A late 11 contender.

**MrMoodle** (10): this fucking bangs what the fuck

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (10): comrade

**nt96** (10): Love the retro, New Order-esque sounds! After reading up on the lyrics and how much the band mean to Belarusians especially during a time of protest, it’s strange how here in the US, it's used in comedic situations. Definitely one of the most unexpected hits on this list.

**ProfeNeuro** (10): who knew that one of the best songs on this list is an esoteric “coldwave” song from a Belarusian group?

**wavingwolves** (10): yes i love post punk

**xavieryes** (10): i had never heard of this before but it's just perfect. it's surprisingly catchy and i've been listening to it on repeat since the preliminary list for this rate came out. would've gotten my 11 if Roses weren't in the rate as well.

**awhile2** (9): i had no idea molchat doma went viral on tiktok thats crazy

**Awkward\_King** (9): ok any indie short film from the late 90s

**best-american-record** (9): this is a fucking jam

**pig-serpent** (9): LoFi Russian post-punk is making its way around TikTok now? Can't say I'm complaining, this song rules.

**qazz23** (9): I like the post-punk/darkwave sound

**ReallyCreative** (9): bop!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): leave it to Russia to make a gothy post-punk song popular on TikTok

**sssaaage** (9): bop!

**teenwitches** (9): eastern european shoegaze sounds way cooler than it should

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoRNvV/

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): that intro snythline was setting me up for snythpop and instead I got some shoegazey new-wave, so i'm a little underwhelmed (but it still slaps)

**bluepupz** (8.5): I did not expect to like this so much, but the synths and guitars and vocals all work well together.

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): what the fuck did i just listen to

**intheaftermath** (8.5): dark academia <3

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this was such a weird trend in retrospect but it's one of my favorite things to have discovered off tiktok it's just pretty cool

**seanderlust** (8.5): "life is hard and uncomfortable but it's comfortable to die" russians do not fuck around with their dance music ig. sonically this reminds me of a she wants revenge demo

**Verrem** (8.4): vibing with scuffed Ian Curtis

**jman457** (8.2): honestly the weird surf rock influences with some brutalist architecture, whats not to like. Also storytime: I pretended to like this band because a guy I had a crush on was really into “soviet post-punk”. (a russian studies major) Turns out he was a straggot so it was all for nothing

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**bbfan132** (8): i like the production quite a bit

**GARjuna** (8): fucks

**HogwartsReject1912** (8): I don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl I am living

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Oh, I really like this. Have no idea what they're saying. Gonna add it to my playlist anyway.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): reminds me of Speed Racer

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): wait this bangs

**runaway3212** (8): This is the only song I didnt know before this rate but it's such a banger but also a bit weird

**schwiftydude047** (8): LoL hAiL cOmMiEs.

**skargardin** (8): wait this slapss

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i enjoy the new wave-y sound of it. reminds me of my old friend who used to collect obscure russian records in this similar type of genre and play them for us. he mightve even showed me this exact song too because it sounds oddly familiar to me

**throwaway7650** (8): some interesting production choices, overall solid

**Uberpigeon** (8): hi niki! i just saw niki girl

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): on the one hand I love darkwave and goth music, but I'm in a weird phase where I'm frustrated by how un-innovative goth music is nowadays. It's more stuck in the 80s than modern pop tbh. So a few fickle points off.

**slimboyfriend** (7.7): Lo-Fi postpunk is alive in Eastern Europe

**aestheticen** (7.5): Would have been better if it was slightly longer

**kreddit2** (7.5): i like this too, sounds joy-divisonesque

**2RINITY** (7): Oh, hey, it's Sasha the Russian's theme song

**arhmaer** (7): TOE TAPPER LETS GO

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): this reminds me of joy division for some reason

**Hulnia** (7): No idea how (or when) this became viral, but it’s fully deserved, this goes so hard for no reason.

**joeeswift** (7): I don’t know what she’s saying but gurl I am living

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I quite like molchat doma but this definitely isn't their best song.

**veryanniev** (6.7): can I just say how incredible it is to see guys from a fellow Eastern European country make it big?

**duochromepalmtree** (6.5): bond movie vibes. Not my thing but I think the sound is very very cool.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): jazzercise type beat, unsettling deep voice

#y'all are on thin ice for that trust tho

**vayyiqra** (6): I thought this would be metal but it's just Joy Division but Slavic so like, same kind of

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Why did I think this song came out in the 60s lol… I blame the album cover

**flibbityflob** (5): Always a slut for a good guitar-led song, this one's fun.

**rickikardashian** (5): slay

**rslashpoopheads** (5): it's aight

**celladonn** (4.5): As a non tiktok user some of the stuff that's apparently popular enough on the app to get included in this rate just baffles me. Russian postpunk? Well okay then

**Square\_Preparation55** (4.2): cool music, but it's not an otherwise memorable song

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): This sounds like one of those obscure songs from some unknown foreign radio station. You know, the kinda song you'd find in a YouTube video called "Most Mysterious Song In The World FOUND?!".

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (3.5): idk i'm running out things to say. this one was also annoying.

**hephaestionline** (3): I'm gonna use this space to mention the superior Cyrillic TikTok trend (audio is Моя голова винтом by kostromin)

cannot take this song seriously after some of the songs I have seen to this trend I am sorry (n) Y'all, this Tiktok trend... permanently scarred into my brain and genuinely half-ruins this song for me lmfao. It's good, objectively, and is a pleasant listen through and through. But I literally cannot unassociate this song with its Tiktok trend which absolutely ruined it for me sadly. Glad y'all enjoyed this one, though!

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): this sounds like it belongs on the soundtrack of a gritty fantasy series a la Game of Thrones

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I'm so happy for her. As much as I hate TikTok, I'm so glad it is opening doors for small artists and really underrated ones.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): very good

**jman457** (10): I literally had a spiritual expierence to this song

**nt96** (10): Scandinavian queen. Bjork found dead floating in a fjord sucking on a pixie stick, wig missing. Last words were "alsemanche".

**rslashpoopheads** (10): it's not just a phase mom leave me alone

**runaway3212** (10): I think we should all vote for the nymph wood fairy rate

**skargardin** (10): the tiktok to forest nymph rate pipeline?

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Aurora is one of my favorite discoveries in music the past few years.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): just adore the way this songs builds

**Uberpigeon** (10): she wrote this when she was ELEVEN what were yall doing when u were 11. nothing. so start stanning!!!!!!!

**whatsanillinois** (10): aurora is perfect

**matthewc20090** (9.5): BEAUTIFUL

**1998tweety** (9): pretty

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): I’m content that this is the one song of hers that broke through from the debut! Hopefully justice for Winter Bird next.

**hephaestionline** (9): My embedded systems lab demo tried to get us to listen to AURORA in early 2019 before AURORA blew up on TikTok. They had good taste.

**intheaftermath** (9): into the unknooooooooown

**jsonphile** (9): this is good. Not as good as the Kanye song, a bit better than the Bon Jovi song

**schwiftydude047** (9): talk about some serious range. you wouldn’t have expected her to be the siren noise in Frozen 2.

**seanderlust** (9): @ whoever was pitching the rate idea with AURORA in it - ok you might be onto something

**vayyiqra** (9): Aurora makes such pretty music and I need to listen to her more

**waluigiest** (9): sing that aurora wow

**2RINITY** (8.5): I did NOT expect this to build up as well as it did. Getting some Bjork vibes from this

**camerinian** (8.5): It was literally my last listen to this before submitting when this finally clicked for me. The development of the production in those synth runs is just gorgeous

**BoneStreetSand** (8.1): Kinda feels like Halsey meets Florence Welch, but not in a way that I think works very well. Then again I like the way it sounds kinda??? Very confused.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): turn up the vocals bestie, otherwise this is good

**banmoderator** (8): unexpected but pleasant

**bbfan132** (8): v pretty song!!!

**bluepupz** (8): She has a lovely voice! I also quite like the production choices throughout.

**cheatviathan** (8): A surprisingly great piece that’s more ambient than what I would typically listen to. The harmonies are stunning, and the way the piece builds and grows more grandiose as it progresses is certainly worthy of praise.

**GARjuna** (8): a bit obsessed w aurora ngl.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the production is so lush here I love it

**ReallyCreative** (8): with me?? I thought you'd never ask

**steelstepladder** (8): Need me a girl to riverdance into my heart

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1BK3o/

**plastichaxan** (7.5): i've unfortunately grown off my aurora era but this is cute

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): i listen to this song and i’m 14 again

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Only a girl like AURORA would have the courage to perform this song at a bloody Nobel Prize ceremony.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): I don't love aurora but this song is nice I suppose

**flibbityflob** (7.1): I'm not big into AURORA's stuff, but she's got a really good voice, and the ethereal way her voice haunts me is just, it's very good.

**akanewasright** (7): Aurora’s music is generally not for me, but it’s always pretty nice. With that being said, Cure for Me is one of my favorite songs this year. This one is perfectly cool though

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7): pop off, sing to the land bitch

**ProfeNeuro** (7): very pretty song

**stryxen** (7): this blowing up was unexpected as hell stream a different kind of human!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I don’t know why I was under the impression that Aurora did stuff like opera and yodeling and not like… actual pop music

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): this song isn't really clicking with me

**CrimsonROSET** (6): movie soundtrack-esque (derogatory)

**duochromepalmtree** (6): its pretty and sounds like a movie trailer song but it just isn’t something I’d listen to voluntarily.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): its nice and peaceful

**avg-vag** (5.5): i want to like this more than i do, it's kind of empty

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): I feel like a traitor to my decades-long obsession and advocacy of Scandinavian pop. ABBA, Susanne Sundfor, Anna von Hausswolff, I'm sorry!!! But this just feels like the weakest version of what I typically love.

**kreddit2** (5.3): she is talented but i find this song boring :((((

**aestheticen** (5): Well it gets good at the end but it's boring for the most part

**Awkward\_King** (4): ok miss nymph girl

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): kind of boring

**my friend Ethan** (4): forgettable

**thedoctordances1940** (4): it's alright towards the end but it's just so boring and i really don't like her voice and accent

**pig-serpent** (3.5): I like some of the harmonies but the song is also a little too serious and self important for me. Also meme indie girl voice lol.

**sssaaage** (3): auroras music is so boring to me sorry

**xavieryes** (2): i can't take it anymooooore

**wavingwolves** (1): i hope aurora's goal in life to make the most boring music possible because it would mean she's succeeding

**Hypno:** As one of the handful of songs in this rate that were released before TikTok even existed, Flamingo has been a bit of an internet meme for years since it's release, but is most well known on TikTok for the "black, white, green or blue, show off your natural hue" line, and videos of people swatching paint colours on their face, swapping coloured outfits or and everything between that. The song itself is incredibly catchy and it's not hard to see why, between the extremely weird, unique and memorable lyrics, the pan flute solo among other wild production elements and Sarah's calming, lighthearted vocals it's a bright, fun song and is the perfect representation of KKB's early sound.

---

#\*extremely Tiktok mashup voice\* OKAY IT'S CHILDISH GAMBINO HOMEGIRLS DROP IT LIKE THE NASDAQ

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (11): わたしはゲイです。

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is the third rate this year with Kero Kero Bonito in it. I wish Kero Kero Bonito would happen/win but that’s not gonna happen unless everyone gets over their Bonito-phobia

**akanewasright** (10): This is not KKB’s best at all, and yet it’s still iconic and wonderful and amazing and aaaaaa I love it so much.

**Awkward\_King** (10): HOW MANY SHRIMPS DO YOU HAVE TO EAT BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR SKIN TURN PINK EAT TOO MUCH AND YOU'LL GET SICK SHRIMPS ARE PRETTY RICH

**banmoderator** (10): I love this song! KKB's discography never misses and the trend for this song was so wholesome too! I prefer the other KKB tiktok hit, I'd Rather Sleep, but this one is great too

**bbfan132** (10): <3 <3

**best-american-record** (10): this is such a cute song and kkb can do no wrong

**bigbigbee** (10): One of my greatest losses when my computer data got accidentally wiped in fall of 2020 was a video of a hand petting a little cute pepe to the tune of this song…I miss her every day

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): It's always slightly bothered me how Sarah sounds like she has a cold? Outsider, lowkey, indie, pride anthem, nonetheless.

**pig-serpent** (10): I think this was my most played song on Spotify a few years ago? Honestly it's grown off me a little, but it's still worthy of a 10 here for legacy reasons.

**plastichaxan** (10): this is extremely fun! i can’t believe this is my 11 and i’m blanking on comments but for the mediocre songs i just think easily what to write :sob:

**RandomHypnotica** (10): 17. 17 Shrimps.

**rickikardashian** (10): this is for bugsnax

**Roxieloxie** (10): this was actually really fun, i didnt expect to like it as much

**runaway3212** (10): SPILL QUEEN

**seanderlust** (10): shrimps are pretty rich

**sssaaage** (10): smasha

**steelstepladder** (10): Can't wait to see who hates fun

**stryxen** (10): k lets vote this, bugsnax, and only acting for all stars then !

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyo5ULu/

**vayyiqra** (10): A tireless meme and also very educational about ornithology (flamingos literally turn pink from biochemicals they get from eating shrimp it sounds like a silly story made up for the song but it's true)

**welcome2thejam** (10): We're gonna get you that rate win, KKB!

**camerinian** (9.5): I really hope this song never runs out of virality and we just have generations of extremely online kids fucking shit up to KKB.

**duochromepalmtree** (9.5): this whole rate will be worth it for bringing this song into my life. The summer vibes are immaculate.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): honestly if I did have kids they’d listen to nothing but KKB instead of Baby Shark

**jman457** (9.2): Much better than the song sent in the IHER, love the production

**wavingwolves** (9.2): this is not a 10 because that flute moment made my enjoyment go down a lot

**1998tweety** (9): camp

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): kkb is impossible to dislike

**CrimsonROSET** (9): remember when bugsnax didnt even get top10 like what a moment most pleasing to me

**matthewc20090** (9): slide whistle supremacy

**qazz23** (9): It's fun and playful

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): me being obsessed with this song when i was 16 was the pipeline to me becoming a hyperpop stan i will not elaborate

**Uberpigeon** (9): poor kkb... always the grab bag never the main

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.6): A zany bop.

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): is this song just telling me it doesn't see color

**teenwitches** (8.5): we need more slide whistles in songs

**throwaway7650** (8.5): me being able to understand like half of the song because I took japanese for fun last year yass. not my favorite KKB song

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): KKB just is

**aestheticen** (8): Camp as fuck https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhDIILjlhBQ

**cheatviathan** (8): While it’s no “Break” or “Heard a Song”, this is still a banger of a song, and a great introduction to early KKB. I love the lyrical sentiment, I love the synth melodies and the rubbery bassline, and I haven’t tired of it after the meme died.

**nt96** (8): I was gonna rate this low but it definitely caught on to me.

**tinaoe** (8): try singing this in the car it's grand

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): is this a gay slur

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): that was cute and fun.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.4): I wonder if there are any competitve eaters out there brave enough to try the whole shrimp-eating challenge... Also "Trampoline" is clearly the superior KKB song.

**slimboyfriend** (7.1): I love KKB but this is not my favorite of theirs

**2RINITY** (7): I feel like the weird mixing choices (bass all the way over on the left, hats all the way to the right) helped this blow up, but also kinda held me back from rating it higher

**AHSWeeknd** (7): arcade music!

**bluepupz** (7): This is quirky and fun, which I feel is KKB's brand. The messaging is presented quite straightforwardly, which goes along with the nursery rhyme chorus.

**GARjuna** (7): some real superorganism shit

**hephaestionline** (7): I thought this was a meme before TikTok

**schwiftydude047** (7): I really dig the beats

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I still can’t get over how the intro reminds me of Paper Mario, but I’m pretty sure that’s on purpose

**waluigiest** (7): I can appreciate it

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I kinda get Clean Bandit vibes from them, is it just me? At least from when they used to make great music and not that shit they've released over the last few years.

**Iris3271** (6.5): The mashups are better

**joeeswift** (6.5): I don’t know what this is but I think I enjoyed it?

**kreddit2** (6.5): not my thing but i get why other people like it

**MrMoodle** (6.5): i really want to like this because it SOUNDS like something i would like… but i just don’t? it’s missing something but i have no idea what

**hookerofpop** (6): i hate shrimps but this could sound good on some days

**just\_thonking** (6): all these songs really straddle the line between catchy and annoying

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): Don't Hug Me I'm a Flamingo

**thedoctordances1940** (6): I guess I just won't ever properly get KKB

frogaranaman: #ate too much and they got sick

**apatel27** (5): overrated KKB song

**ignitethephoenix** (5): maybe one day I’ll hear a really good KKB song

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why is this sung like a jump rope rhyme

**jsonphile** (5): what

**shhhneak** (4.9): This sounds like a K.K. Slider song.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): kero kero poopito

**TragicKingdom1** (4): sorry but im not really into stuff this quirky

**ProfeNeuro** (3.5): funny that this is the KKB song that I don’t like and yet I still enjoy their other songs crazy amirite

**flibbityflob** (3): I'm too old for TikTok at the ripe age of 22 why in god's name is this popular. First dip into Japanese in this rate, and as a person who speaks Japanese, it's nice! absurdly simplistic lyrics, but nice i guess.

**Verrem** (2): I love KKB but something about that flute part just makes me irrationally angry

**Square\_Preparation55** (1.9): this song feels like a joke, I can't tell what it's supposed to be about

**xavieryes** (0): i can't stand Kero Kero Bonito and this is probably one of their most obnoxious songs

haha get it I gave this a nine because it has that number in the title haha

I fucking LOVE that Beach Bunny has gotten several Tiktok hits! This one is definitely their most easily-digestible Tiktok hit (their other one being "Prom Queen", which is pretty intense, to say the least) and it is such a fun song off of such a fun and underrated 2020 album. I'm glad that this song did pretty well in this rate, too. Go check out this album if you haven't yet, genuinely a great one!

---

#on cloud nine :)

**welcome2thejam** (11): Putting on my stan cap right now, but I'm all in on Beach Bunny. An addictive, sun-kissed sound, a keen instinct for laying down one killer hook after another, a voice that is absolutely chef's kiss: all on display in this song. And at the very least I'm glad we're rating the original version of Cloud 9 and not the acoustic cover that apparently was even more popular on TikTok despite being the equivalent of Calum Scott's Dancing On My Own. (That said, had I known what their general rate competition sounded like - I don't have a TikTok - and that popheads would actually vote a Beach Bunny song in, I probably would've nominated Prom Queen instead. So to those of you who would've preferred their other TikTok hit in this rate, let me say from the bottom of my heart, my bad.)

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): I wish he loved me :/

**camerinian** (10): If I was 15 at this very moment and just getting into music, I guarantee this would be my favourite song. Unfortunately I'm 24 and I know that there’s a lot of music like this out there in the world (stream The Beths), but like this is so adorable and upbeat and gleeful, I don’t know how curmudgeonly you’d have to be to pass this up.

**hephaestionline** (10): Okay, this was my original 11 but I changed it last minute. That being said, there's actually two (!) versions of this song on Spotify, and the album version on the rate playlist has the last 10 seconds cut out abruptly. Hopefully that doesn't hurt this song's average :(

**qazz23** (10): Cloud 9 + 1

**schwiftydude047** (10): absolutely love the pop punk inspiration.

**steelstepladder** (10): This is so great and cozy :)

**tinaoe** (10): i went through a phase of looping this endlessly during mindless data work and frankly it still bops so

**xavieryes** (10): a fun little bop

**shhhneak** (9.7): Maybe this app isn’t tasteless after all.

**duochromepalmtree** (9.5): I love this song (and the entire album it comes from). Immediately makes me feel seventeen again.

**Awkward\_King** (9): rt if ur a sad girl and you are angry and you are in love

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): this goes hard

**Brendon-Urine** (9): we love Beach Bunny!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): it’s in the name get on it popheads

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): Not to be unoriginal but it is a score that fits like a glove.

**pig-serpent** (9): Lots of energy here. One of the best summery rock songs I've heard in a while.

**ReallyCreative** (9): stream Superstore

**rickikardashian** (9): i was going to make a “me singing about a guy i just started talking to” but instead ill just call my therapist

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): very cute!! it’s fun and heartwarming and the garage rock edge keeps it from being overly twee. My mind immediately goes to Best Coast

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJoNM46/

**throwaway7650** (9): score in the title! this is a really solid song, super feel-good

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is so fun!!

**wavingwolves** (9): the score isn't as a joke this song is just a perfect 9

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): This is a sweet song! I'm picky with 90's indie sounds, but this is a great rocker.

**slimboyfriend** (8.9): This song and its album is beachy indie pop-punk teen angst bliss

**aestheticen** (8.5): The guitar is nice

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like this quite a bit! nice song

**jasannn** (8.5): I love this short stretch of indie-pop songs

**just\_thonking** (8.5): almost

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): saur cute

**2RINITY** (8): OK, see, this has distortion, this has energy, this has hooks. This is the kinda indie/alt shit I can get behind

**cheatviathan** (8): This song doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it doesn’t have to. I love the bass throughout the song. The chorus melody is catchy. The guitar interplay in the bridge reminds me of early Strokes in the best way possible. Just a great tune in a genre I thought I overdosed on.

**jman457** (8): yeah its like Girlpool and Frankie Cosmos light, but still better than the plethora of the half baked rich kid bedroom pop that goes viral all the time

**MrMoodle** (8): i was reading the rating guidelines and i saw “I will give this song a 9 because of the song title. Haha. Comedy gold.” and i feel a little hurt bc that was going to be my comment almost exactly. but now i can be more honest with my rating so i guess there’s a silver lining.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): yay Beach Bunny!!!

**nt96** (8): For some reason, my mind instantly mashed this song with 99 Luftballoons.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Excellent slice of indie pop-rock. I dig it.

**ProfeNeuro** (8): bunne

**rslashpoopheads** (8): oh I've actually heard this one and I like it

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I like this song but there’s something missing from me loving it

**Verrem** (7.8): such a great voice, not my favourite by them but it's good!

**bluepupz** (7.5): This is cute! I like the guitar near the end, in particular. Why does this remind me of a Disney show opening/ending song?

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this version doesn't really carry the energy all the way through, the remix was perfect for giving an extra oomph

**ImADudeDuh** (7): a cute song that should’ve been a hit

**skargardin** (7): I hate how I have next to no knowledge of the viral trends of these songs skull

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): sounds like music id hear while shopping for clothes at the mall

**stryxen** (6.4): k

**GARjuna** (6): I feel like this kind of melancholy wasn't popular or wasn't something you were supposed to feel when I was in high school. I wonder how common it is now

**runaway3212** (6): Prom Queen outsold

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5.5): it's not bad, but it does nothing for me until the last 30 seconds

#cloud ZERO!!!!!!!!!

**vayyiqra** (5): This kind of indie-pop-rock is boring, but tolerable.

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): Not that awful, kinda tolerable, but I hate the vocalist's voice.

**sssaaage** (4): cute but i felt nothing listening to this

**intheaftermath** (3.5): it's just so overwhelming to listen to, and for me, the melody isn't good enough to save it

**flibbityflob** (3.4): It's fun, I guess? Again, it's not good, it's just not so bad it's making me HURT

**arhmaer** (3): you literally cannot convince me that half of these aren't the same song

**AHSWeeknd** (2): How many indie songs do tiktokers listen to?

**Perfume Genius:** I met him while working at Zales Jewelry in 2014. I was cleaning a display case when I caught a wild movement in its reflection. It was Jensen. He was distressed and besotted by some physical fit. I put down my rag and went to him. Caught up in a kind of standing seizure, his legs and feet were firmly planted but the upper half was flailing and out of control. Yellow foam gathered at the right corner of his mouth. I almost went back for my rag but decided against it—his movements were too erratic, and I feared injury attempting to dab the foam.

A girl in my health class junior year had an epileptic seizure and we were told to give her space and let it pass. This was different, but I used the memory as guidance. I quickly moved semi-precious items from the counter to prevent any damage. I took off my sweater, which was a thick alpaca, and draped it over the sharp edge of a display case. I almost ran for my friend John, who worked at a watch-repair kiosk close by, but I decided to maintain calm supervision. 

After a few minutes whatever overcame him began to dissipate. Slowly his arms ceased to helicopter. His eyes began to open cautiously, and I noticed they were brown, which is my favorite color of all time. I did not recognize him. I have never seen the show “Supernatural” but know all about it because I have had sex with every cast member. Jensen looked at me with the expected mix of embarrassment and gratitude, but there was an extra ingredient I couldn't quite place. We were strangers, but he had just undergone a full-body emergency right in the middle of my Zales. He loosened after a moment when he was sure the convulsions would not repeat. I smiled at him and tried to do so without pity but with a general, easy kindness. It did not seem to register: He cast his eyes down, unmoving.

I went back for my rag. When I returned, I placed a gentle hand on his shoulder and offered it to him. He did not take the rag but instead took my hand from his shoulder and brought it to his mouth. He used my finger to dislodge the crusted foam from each lip corner before jamming it inside. Taken aback, I instinctively tried to pull away, but he bit down slightly, enough to keep my finger in place. I used my rag hand to try and pry his mouth open, and somehow within this scuffle he trapped the ring and pinky fingers inside. Stuck, I almost screamed. My rag had fallen to the floor. I reeled my head back to call out but was suddenly washed over with a warm stillness. It was as if he had arranged us in a sacred geometry. Any tension I had in my body fell away. Time crawled, I arched back, and he brought his hands to mine.

I was no longer in the middle of my shift at Zales. The entire mall seemed to vanish around us until just he and I remained. Jensen cupped my stuck hands at his face and drew them closer. Slowly, but without any strain, he took every one of my fingers down his throat. I felt no pressure from his jaw. His mouth gave without effort and kept giving until he had taken me to the elbow on each side. The arrangement should have brought stress to my joints as well, but I felt no such thing. I seemed to be pooling, my flesh arranging seamlessly as he gathered me deeper still. Slick, he sucked me up to the shoulders before widening—until the crown of my head was too pulled in. 

Miraculously, I could see. My eyes open, I saw each tender vein of his esophagus as I made my way further down. His teeth gently grazed my back as he swallowed, easy still until stopping at the belt of my jeans. This was the only point of tension. I felt him navigate the buckle with his tongue and bottom incisors until it unlatched. My denim fell away. Briefly, I imagined it meeting my rag on the floor. Brought back to the moment, lit as if by some divine headlamp, I continued to slide and watched as I entered Jensen's upper stomach.

This area was more populated. Big folds and craters, like zoomed-in ground beef, some slightly taken up by food in various states of digestion. I was beyond smell, beyond comprehension even, but still somehow fully present and lit up by feeling. My body was now fully ingested, arms and legs outstretched and every limb straight out like a spear. My dick grazed the ridges of his stomach as I made my way through. I began to harden and pressed myself into him. Noticing this somehow, he sent a response, a low hum that reverberated through whatever cavity I inhabited at that moment. The vibration heightened my arousal. I was glad for it. I greedily pressed harder as I swam, calling out for more. Each time he echoed back.

The feeling reached a fever pitch somewhere in his abdomen. Hard still, but dull and full of blood with no sensation. I opened my eyes, which had been closed with pleasure and did not recognize the anatomy. But I knew where to go, where he wanted me. Somehow Jensen was instructing me, lighting my path in ways unknown. Guided through unfamiliar tubes and atria, I arrived at his balls. I didn't know exactly how I got there, but I had full knowledge that I was inside his sack. Through this knowledge or Jensen's permission, my arousal returned. 

With my senses back, I called out once more and was met with a new hum. It coursed through me like a ton of bricks that clanged and rattled cum energy through every corner of my being. As the cum energy rose and spread through my body, so did the speed at which I traveled. I was tumbling wildly, nearly screaming in every possible way, through a thin passageway that loosened and constricted in perfect harmony with my desires. I was inside his dick now, and his hum turned to a scream that met mine. Formed into pure cum energy, I cascaded through his urethra like a great sloshing sea. Eyes still open, nearly bursting, I saw his meatus part and a sliver of my workplace outside. I shot out in what felt like pure fire, incomprehensible pleasure, one I was sure I couldn't return from after experiencing. But I did return, and quickly too, as I landed directly on my discarded jeans and cleaning rag.

Looking up, my everything a puddle, I met Jensen's eyes for the first time. Smiling, he wiped his brow with a shirtsleeve and turned to leave. I said nothing. I needed nothing. I felt spent forever. The experience was too singular, too intense to ever repeat or even acknowledge at that moment. I was shaken and glad to see him leave. Transformed inside but with a body back to normal proportions, I gathered my jeans over me and curled into a ball on the sales floor. I took the rag in my hand and held it close.

#wanting to see their lover in the afterlife

**bbfan132** (11): excellence, the best song to trend on tiktok

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (11): Honest to Lorde I cried listening to this with the album having just dropped. Sure, my eardrums were split open, but that explosion of sound feels exactly like coming out to someone and feeling genuine maybe for the first time. Thank you, Mike, for the music.

**veryanniev** (11): It has been 6 months since the indieheads crossover rate, in which MGMT’s «Time to Pretend» won over Perfume Genius’ «On The Floor» by only TWO POINTS, and I’ve been bitter about that ever since. You’d ask «Bitch, is there really nothing else going on in your life that you’re still hung up on the results of a Reddit rate?!», and I’d say «Yes, but mind your own fucking business». Anyways, I’m not gonna be as mad if «Otherside» doesn’t win, but if fucking MGMT will win AGAIN I don’t know what I am going to do (probably nothing except for leaving an angry comment). Oh, and yeah, this song is euphoric and deserves an 11.
[/r/popheads/comments/q0lyg6/tiktok_rate_reveal_day_3_these_results_are_you/hf9apmd/]

=====

frogaranaman: **akanewasright** (10): this is magical

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): heavenly

**Brendon-Urine** (10): ugh this song. it's just stunning in every way. a perfect album to a perfect album. I still remember the chills I got hearing it for the first time. stream No Shape!

**cheatviathan** (10): I’ve seen mountains of praise heaped upon the work of Perfume Genius, but never took the time to hear his albums. Listening to “On the Floor” for the indie rate, it floored me, and this did as well. The sparse piano jabs directly at the heart, and the layers of orchestration in the chorus hit harder than expected.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Perfume Genius is THE MOMENT. He's brilliant at his music, the dynamics and emotional vulnerability. I can't help but stan!

**jman457** (10): Its a beautiful song, and the trend associated with it added to the beauty to it.

**plastichaxan** (10): this is so poohascend vibes

**RandomHypnotica** (10): wow this is so different from everything else in this rate, and even what i've heard from Perfume Genius, but it's absolutely gorgeous

**ReallyCreative** (10): gorgeous jesus christ

**skargardin** (10): the sudden breakdown makes me ASCEND

**slimboyfriend** (10): It is I your resident Perfume Genius stand to remind you that you all need to listen to his discography for ethereal sad gay artsy bops and also this song is one of the best album openers I've ever heard and acts as an incredible lead-in to Slip Away.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): If I had a nickel for each time I almost gave Perfume Genius an 11 this year just for it to be stolen by an artist I hadn't heard before, I would have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.

**steelstepladder** (10): :poohascend:

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyot2WC/

**TiltControls** (10): I have no idea what trend this is, but I love it

**tinaoe** (10): mr perfume genius can i request a concept album about your supernatural sex escapades

**waluigiest** (10): I was so shook when this started trending on tiktok

**xavieryes** (10): after feeling absurdly conflicted on this song for quite a while, i've ultimately decided that i love it

**ProfeNeuro** (9.7): I don’t have a TikTok, so seeing Perfume Genius here was a shocker. I’ll take it though

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): hot and gay

**celladonn** (9.5): Ummm it's gorgeous

**jsonphile** (9.5): okay wow I really like this

**1998tweety** (9): beautiful

**best-american-record** (9): whoa, i wasn’t expecting that burst in sound in the middle and at the end. that was beautiful. i thought it was just gonna be slow track

**BoneStreetSand** (9): This was big on Tik Tok?

**camerinian** (9): OK fine I’ll get into Perfume Genius you’ve convinced me jeez

**rickikardashian** (9): this is amazing and technically it fits, but it doesnt feel correct rating this alongside Laxed - Siren Beat

**sssaaage** (9): ascending

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): love this song so much as an opener to No Shape

**stryxen** (8.5): not my fav by mr genius but it is still so yass

**throwaway7650** (8.5): this sounds so much like a hymn/lullaby and then the chorus EXPLODES... I don't love his voice but this song is such an experience

**duochromepalmtree** (8): the first time the beat drops is absolutely magical. And then they do it again exactly the same way as the first time…lost some point from me there. But it’s still beautiful.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Go get your money.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): did yall know perfume genius is fucking 40 years old??? What the fuck

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): pretty

**teenwitches** (8): it's giving "and in that moment i swear we were infinite"

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): I redeem myself after the indieheads rate! The explosion of noise and power after the first couple of lines is what really makes this song bang, though it would’ve been really cool if he’d sung over that last drop

**jasannn** (7.5): I'm pretty sure its on purpose but the mixing is odd

**LesApfels** (7.5): THE SYNTHS

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): the big moment is good but you can tell its just supposed to be an album opener

**banmoderator** (7): i like perfume genius but this is an odd pick imo

**CrimsonROSET** (7): styrofoam glitter bomb of a song

**GARjuna** (7): honestly I wanted to give him more points bc the supernatural erotica but we'll have to make do

**nt96** (7): https://tenor.com/bohsr.gif

**pig-serpent** (7): I really like the big explosion part and I think the somber part is okay. This is probably great in context of the album but by itself it feels incomplete.

**runaway3212** (7): not the best perfume genius

**schwiftydude047** (7): why does that transition to loud and bombastic feel so satisfying?

**seanderlust** (7): beautiful, even if it does kind of feel like a jumpscare

**flibbityflob** (6.8): Not his best work, but that's because his best work is EVERYTHING about his ongoing supernatural RPF. you owe it to yourself to read that. It's also not really for me, but I know it's quality.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): he has better songs than this, the vocals are just too distorted and the mixing is bugging me

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): has some really amazinh parts but the boring parts are really boring

**AHSWeeknd** (6): it ain’t much tbh

**bluepupz** (6): The loud explosions of instruments at 1:10ish and 2:16ish actually scared the shit out of me the first time I listened. Very pretty song, but I'm sure I would appreciate this more as an intro to the album versus a standalone like this.

**kreddit2** (6): just not into it sadly

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (6): did you like The Blind Side?

**Uberpigeon** (6): this is like slip away but not as good

**Verrem** (6): bad Perfume Genius song is still a pretty decent song overall

**MrMoodle** (5.5): i’m sorry, i can’t get into anything that sounds like it would fit in a coming of age indie movie trailer which basically describes every perfume genius song i’ve ever heard. i’ll give it some credit though because the instrumental just blasting in like that actually scared the fucking shit out of me and left me giggling for a while.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): genuinely got jump scared by the beat drop lol

#actually doesn't want to meet you on the otherside, tyvm

**aestheticen** (5): Man it's just not my kind of music I'm sorry

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): Oh I like this, sounds like the kind of song you'd listen to when you're all alone, crying in your bedroom on a col- WOAH HOLY FUCK I WAS NOT EXPECTING IT TO GO OFF LIKE THAT JESUS

**hikkaru** (4.5): i got jumpscared

**2RINITY** (4): This was gonna be a 2, but then BWOOOOOOOOOOOOOM

**arhmaer** (4): im really torn on this one. i think it's better than i'm giving it credit, i admit, i just don't like it!!! it annoys me! i feel nothing!

**vayyiqra** (4): Feeling kind of bad but this isn't working for me right now at all even though it's, in theory, very pretty

**rslashpoopheads** (3): snoozefest

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Man all the sapphics in this rate get fun rock bops but what do we get? Depression?

#O-O-OOOOOOOOO

**2dina3dworld** (10): I would make a Wendy Williams passing out joke but I think that’s a bit low brow and I am a woman of good taste (unlike Wendy Williams)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): only giving this a ten because the judges pretending to not know who that loud voice belongs to is Oscar worthy.

**Awkward\_King** (10): clap if you gave this a 10. clap if you gave this a 10.

**camerinian** (10): the masked singer feels like a fever dream at the best of times, but hearing wendy williams snort into the mic as a massive pair of disembodied lips is like a post-coitus cheese dream

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the most underrated part is that she says

**Uberpigeon** (10): this song saved my life

**waluigiest** (10): I entered this rate assuming this would be my 11. I’m so upset it’s in the bonus rate

**schwiftydude047** (9): everything about this performance is iconic.

**nt96** (8): LOL GIRL NOT THE SNORT I--

#they are prescribed 100mg of Zoloft daily

**2dina3dworld** (10): I too got depression, and I also like getting political at the worst of times

**akanewasright** (10): I would literally 11 this if it was in the main rate. I have looped this and it’s… honestly quite hypnotic. You just kinda fall into it after a while.

**astrologicalangel** (10): I wish more than anything that I could give two 11s

**Awkward\_King** (10): kennybeats please step on me

**bbfan132** (10): hi, i have a mental illness….

**camerinian** (10): I want Zack Fox to spit in my mouth

**cheatviathan** (10): One of the most profound and poignant pieces of accidental genius that Sir Kenneth Beats has brought out of the cave. When the great bard Zachary Fox said “I put my dick in a bag of Doritos and made this bitch suck the dust off the tip”, it made me rethink everything I thought I knew about mental illness, trauma, and the patriarchy (in that order).

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this would be a 11 if it was in the main rate.

**Hulnia** (10): Honestly, this one is actually like unironically good. 💀

**ignitethephoenix** (10): rip Betty white (just saying this for when she dies cause I know it’s coming up)

**jman457** (10): Free Palestine again!!!

**matthewc20090** (10): favorite meme song

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (10): makes me wanna cum

**nootnoot781** (10): i’d 11 this if it was in the main rate.

**rickikardashian** (10): i love christian music

**Roxieloxie** (10): i mean what can i even say its immaculate

**runaway3212** (10): Shoutout mental illness so true

**seanderlust** (10): spill

**sssaaage** (10): a smash hit.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): this has so many deeply funny bars it's great

**steelstepladder** (10): You better play the whole Genius video during the reveal

**teenwitches** (10): this is what reminiscing about your catholic school trauma as an adult sounds like

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1XoQQ/

**thedoctordances1940** (10): If this were in the main rate it would be an easy 11

**throwaway7650** (10): this song is the peak of comedic irony in song form

**wavingwolves** (10): who can relate WOOOOOO

**welcome2thejam** (10): Wish it could be Jesus Is The 11, but alas. Anyway, the first verse is the greatest rap verse of all time I will not be taking questions at this time

**jackisboredtoday** (9.6): there’s nothing i can add to this which wouldn’t be less funny than the song itself

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): WHO CAN RELATE WOO

**whatsanillinois** (9): SHOUTOUT MENTAL ILLNESS

**best-american-record** (8): i think i changed my score with each verse but the “if you got mental illness, turn up” line straight into “i put my dick into a bag of doritos” sealed it for me

**jsonphile** (8): okay this was kinda funny. Most of these joke songs are just one joke the entire song, but this is actually pretty good. “RIP Betty White she ain’t dead but for when she die” quality joke there

**schwiftydude047** (8): not sure how to describe this one. uhhhh praise Jesus.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i think there might be something wrong with me bc i listen to this song unironically all of time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): Honestly this song made me laugh lol.

**BoneStreetSand** (7.3): I feel like I’m going to hell for laughing.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): there’s so many things to be mentioned but shout out mental illness frfr

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Zack & Kenny are practically a match made in heaven, and probably the second best Kenny Beats collab outside of the entirety of "Unlocked".

**Uberpigeon** (7): rip betty white

**nt96** (6): If Betty White dies before she hits 100, I'll make sure he meets Jesus.

**vayyiqra** (6): This is such a bizarre song and it's not good but i find it oddly fascinating and also i have depression so that part is relable (not the rest so much thankfully)

#recognize genius when you hear it

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Kanye West

**banmoderator** (4): lol

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4): not rip betty white and shout out mental illness

**veryanniev** (3.5): you would not be able to convince me this isn’t some 3 AM stream of consciousness shit. also betty white is never going to die, fuck you for even thinking about that

**brenda\_official** (3): not very funny

**duochromepalmtree** (3): I get it. It’s funny. But it isn’t even catchy so it’s hard to see the real point.

**inesmina** (3): my grandma is going to kill me

**flibbityflob** (2.5): i take it back this is the real future of art. some of this is unironically good.

**plastichaxan** (2): okay and what do you want me to do about that

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (1.5): yeah this humor is not for me

**aestheticen** (1): ???????

**bluepupz** (1): WHAT the fuck is this [3] Shoutout mental illness.

**tinaoe** (1): i left church literally two months ago maybe it was because of this song

y'all why.

I'm sorry, but I hate this song so much. I hate the trend attached to it, I hate the random beat switch halfway through, I just cannot find a single thing to like about it. Which sucks, because Doechii has AMAZING songs in her discography! But this one is so incredibly annoying and the last song of hers I wanted to go viral. Oh well, at least y'all enjoyed it in the rate.

---

#has two i's in their name

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I love doechii soooo much. She reminds me of younger Nicki without all the baggage lol. And some Doja and Tierra. I think this is such a creative song. I hope she has a long career!!!

**nt96** (11): wow what an introduction indeed! The storytelling is phenomenal and the switch up was unexpected but very entertaining. I was gonna give BENEE my 11 but this one takes the cake for me!

**plastichaxan** (11): this song is a whole journey, it has everything i could ask for wow what a moment etc etc

**sssaaage** (11): idk how this blew up but im glad it did, the switchup is soooo good

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This rate is the first time I've heard this song but since my first listen I've gone back so many times. It's so good and unique. "Agressive" female raps, that beat switch, the smooth second half, layering in a Paramore interpolation, this song has it all. Every time I come back, I feel like I hear a new detail I didn't before. Highly impressive for a relative new, up and coming artist.

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I was in the middle of making a joke about how the entire second verse is about masturbation but then the beat switch hit… holy FUCK! This is a literal masterpiece… Did not expect to give my 11 to a song I’ve never heard before but here it is! Also this song gets extra credit for interpolating another song that I’ve rated a 10!

**2dina3dworld** (10): did you remember to put the chicken out?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the beat change did it for me

**akanewasright** (10): This is just… SO full of life and character. This is a really well executed concept, and an ideal introduction to her as a rapper and as a force of personality. Literally I want Doechii to have the world, and hopefully SZA interacting with her on Instagram leads to a track that actually gets released

**Awkward\_King** (10): not 11ing this song hurts, i literally love it more than i can express and its so brilliant, doechii's flow is incredible, the vulnerability of the lyrics juxtaposed with how sassily she's delivering them, the switchup halfway through which isnt just a switchup for the sake of it, it also is narratively relevant in the song and the lyrics. her mind your honour, her mind

**bbfan132** (10): really really good!!!

**best-american-record** (10): first time hearing this song, whoa i love this

**celladonn** (10): God damn this rules

**cremeebrulee** (10): king isn't holding a gun to my head rn why would u possibly think that

**CrimsonROSET** (10): what they said ^

**intheaftermath** (10): a modern day Bohemian Rhapsody

**jman457** (10): ok it took me a couple of listens but now I get it

**joeeswift** (10): wow the rest of the song is so much better than the part that went viral?!?!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Man oh man I was NOT expecting the switch-up partway through the song though. Bloody hell. Everything about this is amazing and I would've given it my 11, had it not been for a certain other rap song...

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the two different parts of this track at first, but it grew on me in the end

**ReallyCreative** (10): Something Real from this EP is a major bop go stream it

**runaway3212** (10): I LOVE THIS SO FUCKING MUCH UGH

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): her range though?? we love a coming-of-age autobiographical rap opera, this is a ride from beginning to end

**seanderlust** (10): I love this and I don't think it's just because it interpolates paramore. its format reminds me of my favorite tyler tracks. let the record show that literally the ONLY reason this isn't my 11 is because I am pulling for someone to FINALLY win a rate.

**shhhneak** (10): Looking camp right in the eye.

**skargardin** (10): GIVE IT UP FOR DOECHII

**throwaway7650** (10): this aespa - next level beat drop... I'M ONDA NEXT 10 IN THE RATE YASS (no but this song has great lyrics/storytelling for real)

**TiltControls** (10): love this!!

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the biggest hit we have here and i have to act accordingly

**welcome2thejam** (10): The back half turns this song from good to fantastic, from the Paramore reference to that "Domino's pizza date" verse. Easily the best discovery of the rate

**xavieryes** (10): this song sure is somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'

**2RINITY** (9.5): This shit is a JOURNEY. The ambition, the production, the progression, the quotables, this is a potential star-making performance right here. Somebody's gotta link doechii up with Missy Elliott, 'cause they'd make magic together

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9.5): Its my submission :)

**1998tweety** (9): she bodied this

**hikkaru** (9): we love a paramore stan

**jackisboredtoday** (9): YOU FORGOT TO TAKE THE CHICKEN OUT

**pig-serpent** (9): This song is a trip in the best ways. The first half actually has a beat that backs up her crazy, unhinged rapping (coughcoughtokyocouldlearnherecough) and then we get a sound change and a random Paramore sample. If I have anything negative to say here, it's that I'm not as huge on the beat in the second half.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): their voice is so nice

**vayyiqra** (9): I kind of love this ??? idk her voice is like vintage Nicki but over a really neat instrumental and I like multi-part songs a lot

**waluigiest** (9): the full song is good, but the videos that use this sound are some of the lowest quality vids I’ve seen and it means I never want to listen to it. But it’s a great song, especially the second half

**matthewc20090** (8.9): an entire bop

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): who is this absolute rapstress

**bluepupz** (8.5): I was very pleasantly surprised by the journey/story this song took me through. She's quite talented! I feel like she's gotta be around the same age as me, if she was selling Silly Bands in 6th grade haha.

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): I really like this girl and I think this song is very cool. She’s talented and someone to watch.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): oh this is groovy

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): im kinda bummed the tiktok sound made it sound like a generic bratty female rap song because there's actually a lot of depth here

**Uberpigeon** (8.3): this was a ride

**Iris3271** (8): I also fuck with Junie B

**schwiftydude047** (8): the rhythm and rhymes flow really well.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This song is an iconic journey however I just won’t come back to listen to it much

**jsonphile** (7.5): it’s a 7 for the first half, an 8 for the second half

**kreddit2** (7.5): the song gets better every minute

**aestheticen** (7): This is definitely something

**cheatviathan** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us2FjKZjvFI

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I had to take a few points because of the second section. It was quite bland. She kinda lost me there and I only got back to it after she name-dropped Paramore (yay)

**steelstepladder** (7): I like the first part, and I like the second part... Why are both these songs together?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i like the first half of this song much better than the second and it kinda loses my interest after the beat switch

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1GXTb/

**whatsanillinois** (7): beat switch rules

=====

frogaranaman: **arhmaer** (6.5): she had no right to go so hard

**flibbityflob** (6.1): two songs combined together, and whilst i'm kinda into the first half, i'm less into the second. her flow is real nice though, and I think she's one to watch.

**apatel27** (6): beat switch saves it 4 pre to 8 after

**camerinian** (6): I haven’t even submitted this yet and I’m already tired of the discourse i assume this song will come with

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (6): her name is doechii with two i's

**rickikardashian** (6): doechii very talented and i wish her the best but this SHRUNK the second i couldnt escape from it

**rslashpoopheads** (6): doja moment

#hates two part songs

**stryxen** (6): drags a bit but it’s mostly pretty fun

**banmoderator** (5): title made this unappealing but it was fine

**ProfeNeuro** (5): After 63 songs, I can safely say, as someone who doesn’t have TikTok (and watches TikTok compilations occasionally on YT), most of these songs made me realize how disconnected I am from the culture of TikTok. However, with that said, it was still an amazing experience, diving headfirst into a genre of music I would've never experienced without this rate.

**Roxie:** The first time I ever heard of this song was when it was announced that it had stoped Justin's "Yummy" from getting the top spot on the billboard chart. Like Lil Nas X had done months prior, Roddy had defeated the biggest enemy in pop music plaguing us all, white mediocrity, and I absolutely loved to see it. So it was all that much more enjoyable when I finally heard the song and just heard how absolute *fun* it is. Its insanely quotable, the ee-ur's are insanely earwormy, yelling the line 'BITCH DON'T WEAR NO SHOES IN MY HOUSE' is truly a highlight. I truly don't get how anyone can listen to this and just not instantly enjoy it.

#EE ER

**akanewasright** (11): Okay this is like… actually the best song here. This will lose probably, but if it wins, you just KNOW beatsense chat will explode with “EE UR” and we’ll all lose our minds and it’ll be the most iconic rate winner in recent memory.

**steelstepladder** (11): EE ER IS COMING!!!

**thedoctordances1940** (11): ee ur

**Awkward\_King** (10): ee er

**CrimsonROSET** (10): is it ee ur or ee er please decide

**jackisboredtoday** (10): future winner of the EE ER rate arrived

**joeeswift** (10): ee-er is permanently tattooed onto my brain now

**MrMoodle** (10): ee ur

**rickikardashian** (10): this is going to EE UR its way into the top 10, wont it? [**host's comment:** never was]

**skargardin** (10): ee ur

**stryxen** (10): ee ur

**TiltControls** (10): ee er

**wavingwolves** (10): ee ur

**camerinian** (9.5): EE UR

**aestheticen** (9): 一二

**best-american-record** (9): ee er

**celladonn** (9): ee ur and so on and so forth

**Hulnia** (9): ee er

**matthewc20090** (9): EEEE ERRR

**welcome2thejam** (9): Apologies in advance, but I am contractually obligated to EE-ER

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): ee ur

**static\_int\_husp** (8): ee er

**teenwitches** (8): eee urr

**waluigiest** (8): EE ER rate when?

**bluepupz** (7.5): EE ER EE ER EE ER This is catchy as hell. I fully respect the fact that this blocked so many songs on the Hot 100 last year.

**jasannn** (7.5): ee ur

**2dina3dworld** (7): ee er

**2RINITY** (7): ee er

**seanderlust** (7): EE UR

#I'M A 2020 PRESIDENT CANDIDATE

**AHSWeeknd** (11): A DAMN SONG. It still holds up

**Roxieloxie** (11): I absolutely adore everything about this song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): this is just a really well made song, I’m ascending to the outro

**TragicKingdom1** (11): every so often there's one of these hip hop songs where every line just hits and this is the best example

**cheatviathan** (10): This beat is unstable and eerie without caving in on itself. Roddy Rich has a unique ear for melody that few could match. And I love how the #1 song in America for eleven consecutive weeks had a line about putting a hit out on George Zimmerman.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i thought he said he was a 2020 presidential candidate? all men do is lie

**duochromepalmtree** (10): you can’t deny the hold this song had over all of us for a moment. It is so freaking catchy this one will be on playlists forever.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Genuinely one of my favorite hip hop song from the past few years. Roddy is probably one of the most interesting rappers from recently, I love his melodic style a lot

**ImADudeDuh** (10): No, because this fucking SLAPS! This would be the most quotable song in this whole rate if it wasn’t for another #1 hit here.

**jsonphile** (10): hey, a real song! Seriously, one of the best songs of 2020. It’s got a great atmospheric beat, and every line is so memorable, especially “BITCH DONT WEAR NO SHOES IN MY HOUSE” Keep Roddy around we need artists

**nootnoot781** (10): it has the catchiest hook this decade, argue with a wall

**runaway3212** (10): Finally some good fucking music

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRJEhR7Y/

**bbfan132** (9): bop

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): *wipes window in time to the beat*

**nt96** (9): me right now https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4fm8gR4yLY

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8.8): the zimmerman line is top tier

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): this finally clicked with me!

**just\_thonking** (8.5): the first good song in the rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): This song really does slap, huh? Can't hate!

**educationalmirror** (8): "don't wear no shoes in my house" finally a lyric that all poc can relate to

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The transition from this to "Start Wit Me" on the album is probably the second-best transition I've ever heard (the first obviously being "Chromatica II/911").

**BoneStreetSand** (7.5): I don't like this song, but those instrumentals deserve a 10 so it evens out.

**ProfeNeuro** (7.5): taking it back to a time in 2020 when the pandemic and mask wearing wasn’t the new normal

**throwaway7650** (7.5): ~~EE ER~~ EEYORE (shoutout faded)! nice beat and production overall (cannot say the same about NCT 127 - sticker) but I don't like his voice that much (can say the same about NCT taeyong)

**banmoderator** (7): overhated

**hephaestionline** (7): bathroom mirrors have never been cleaner (ee ur)

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I never got the hype for this one. I mean, his flow is nice, but the backing track is so generic. I've heard it too many times in so many different songs.

**kreddit2** (7): which i would describe as "i wouldn't save it, but i wouldn't skip it"

**pig-serpent** (7): I get why so many people love this song but I've been waiting for it to grab my brain and not let go since it came out, and that still has yet to happen.

**HogwartsReject1912** (6): Never was too into it but hey I don't hate it

**rslashpoopheads** (6): THINK ARTHUR! THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX!

**schwiftydude047** (6): I honestly really like the beat, but it’s not one of my favorites when compared to the rest of these.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): ...I don’t get it 😭

**flibbityflob** (5.7): I didn't like it, and then i REALLY liked it?

#I hate this subreddit so fucking much!!!!!!!!!!!

**arhmaer** (5): i know u ppl like it. ee ur makes me mad. pls live with that

**Uberpigeon** (5): so THIS is why you people keep saying ee er

**veryanniev** (5): I’m really disappointed this wasn’t Love Sex Magic

**1998tweety** (3): i retain my belief that this is an incredibly mediocre song that only blew up cause of the ee er

**jman457** (2.5): really overplayed, not much here (like there isnt even really a chorus) outside of the ee-ers and the strings

**sssaaage** (1): sorry if you had to be around teenage boys nonstop when this was a hit youd hate it too

I love "Fiona Coyne" by Skylar Spence!

Ah, "Say So". The song that launched Doja Cat into the stratosphere of pop stardom, and yet it was oh so controversial nevertheless. Personally, I've never been a fan of the song at all - even before knowing who worked on it, I thought the production was just kind of a slog and became grating and annoying after two or so listens. It makes sense, I have never been the biggest fan of Dr. Luke's production style, but learning about that fact only soured the song more for me. Doja sounds great, though, and the dance is an absolute blast - seeing it get built day by day was such a cool concept to see - but outside of that I just never got the hype around this song. Y'all obviously like the song, though, and it snuck into the top ten just barely. ~~But at the cost of "The Box", so ultimately it was to the loss of everyone involved.~~

---

#they didn't even notice

**kreddit2** (11): just such a fun song, doja cat performs the hell out of it in many different styles, and would there even be a tiktok rate to do without this song?????

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): this will probably win, and you know what? It would absolutely deserve to. Say So could bring world peace, it’s one of those songs that nearly everybody likes

**AHSWeeknd** (10): not giving the white demon a stream, but Doja went off

**bluepupz** (10): The 11 got narrowly stolen from this song, since I have slightly overplayed it at this point lol. Still an excellent pop song that I love!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): discourse

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Honestly? Still bangs. One of Doja's best.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): you listen to it and immediately want to hear it again. It’s also still the only tik tok dance I can actually do.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): yeah I cannot make this song not bop even with the overplay and Dr. Luke

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I didn't know TikTok claimed this song. Guess I'm a boomer after all.

**jasannn** (10): I'm not embarassed that I know the tik tok dance to this.

**rickikardashian** (10): who hates this song more? people that hate doja cat, or doja cat herself?

**sssaaage** (10): the chokehold this had over literally everything

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): [cant give dr luke any money by listening to this song if you have it illegally downloaded](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d6a/dc7/4a5001b7beea096457f480c8808572428b-09-roll-safe.2x.h473.w710.jpg)

**throwaway7650** (10): FUCK TYSON TRAX/DR. LUKE. with that out of the way, I hate that this is an absolute smash and I totally understand how it went viral for being good (among other things) like telepatia (kali coming to win all stars btw)

**tinaoe** (10): iconic showstopping etc etc

**Uberpigeon** (10): say so is unironically so fucking good i dont care if its so overplayed it truly is a 10!!!

**vayyiqra** (10): bop

**aestheticen** (9.5): Still slaps not going to lie

**jsonphile** (9.5): okay obviously this song is great. I’m sure we’re all tired of hearing it, plus all the discourse around it’s producer, but it is genuinely a good song, and Doja Cat may be one of the biggest stars of the 2020s

**jman457** (9.3): I mean it should be higher but locter duke exists

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): minus one point for being produced by dr puke

**hephaestionline** (9): I'm glad Doja's escaped the shadow of this song. But it still bangs in a 2020 summer that never was kinda way.

**nt96** (9): I made a mashup of this and American Boy by Estelle. One of my proudest moments.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1YRuf/

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): That harmony in the chorus is truly everything

**best-american-record** (8.8): great song, wish it wasnt overplayed so much

**slimboyfriend** (8.8): I'm surprised I still don't hate this song as much as Doja Cat does

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I once heard the intro to this song and very, VERY confidently said “Oh I love Get Lucky!” worst moment of my life

**TiltControls** (8.5): it's grown on me for sure

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the best song dr luke has produced since his cancellation and it's not close

**2RINITY** (8): What can I say about this that hasn't already been said

**Awkward\_King** (8): this trash ass fucking dumb stupid hate this fucking boppy ass well produced great video fucking song sucks fuck you

**bbfan132** (8): straightforward bop, v enjoyable

**cremeebrulee** (8): grinny obviously fuck dr l*ke but i will be lying if i say i didn't like this song

**pig-serpent** (8): Normally I prefer my disco to be more upbeat, like Dua Lipa or my favorite anime disco acts like Desired, but it's hard to deny the hook on this song. And given who made this song, I really want to deny it.

**qazz23** (8): I like it, but it's nowhere near as good as Boss Bitch

**waluigiest** (8): Tik Tok has a habit of taking great Doja songs and running them so far into the ground I never want to hear them again

**welcome2thejam** (8): You could probably cut the final chorus run and it'd be better for it (though the change-up with the double clap is a nice touch). Doja coming in with the rap verses are obviously what pushes this to a great score. Also that hard rock award show version might be a 10.

**MrMoodle** (7.5): still a solid track but doja’s done the same thing but better now anyway

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): I love Doja’s vocal performance here, she really shows her versatility and sounds like she’s having fun. However, the music itself is overhyped asf, and that’s not even getting into Dr. Luke discourse

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Live metal version outsold

**camerinian** (7): since I was so late to TikTok, the only significant video that jumped out at me for this song was some teenage white girl patronisingly explaining why Doja Cat might be sick of performing her most popular song at live shows more than a year after it was at its peak when she’s got a full album of new material out. Not that I needed some basic to spell it out for me, but yeah I feel that

**inesmina** (7): because is overplayed

**intheaftermath** (7): please let Doja perform something else

**Iris3271** (7): The voice she does in the second verse keeps me from fully liking this

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7): someone give her the anti-horny pills, please. (technically, -15 for Dr. Luke) *go listen to "Fiona Coyne" by Skylar Spence

**rslashpoopheads** (7): i hate how much dr luke served with this i literally can't give this less than a 7 but I'm docking points anyways

**schwiftydude047** (7): good on you Doja for figuring out the perfect recipe for a viral hit.

**flibbityflob** (6.8): I don't know how I feel about Doja, tbh. It's good, well polished music, but it doesn't hit right for me. I do need ass and tiddys, though.

**plastichaxan** (6.5): i’m as tired of this song as doja performing the choreo in that one video

**seanderlust** (6.5): ....okay yes I know luke is on this, but it slaps. i'm sorry I have to turn off my brain and pretend i'm on rollerskates in drag with flower petals falling around me as the Lord intended.

**arhmaer** (6): doja cat i'm so sorry for your career

**cheatviathan** (6): This was a conundrum. Do I give it a 6 because it’s a decent song with a solid disco throwback beat, and the slightest hint of genuine personality in Doja’s rap verse? Or do I give it a 0 because it gave Dr. Luke’s career a second wind? I chose the former.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): this is fine background music pop. the EMA performance elevated it to more than that

**stryxen** (5.5): please let doja rest

frogaranaman: #not repeating themselves

**GARjuna** (5): this thing really sounds like it was made in a lab. Really prefer the Japanese cover

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): The fact that this absolute banger was co-written and produced by Dr. Puke is what's stopping me from giving it an 8.

**Roxieloxie** (5): my roommate kinda made me hate doja cat sfdsdfsdf she used to loop the album on her alexa and it was the most annoying shit after a while

**shhhneak** (5): I dislike this song almost as much as Doja dislikes it.

**Brendon-Urine** (3): know I'm against the grain but this song has always been annoying

**ImADudeDuh** (3): https://i.imgur.com/YF55baF.mp4

**ProfeNeuro** (2): “I’m not a Doja Cat fan, would’ve given a two to ‘Say So’ as well, if I could.” -me during the popheads exchange rate, probably

**xavieryes** (1): I get why people like this song, but I just can't fucking stand it. It's so overproduced and sickly-sweet it gives me migraines. Sometimes I used to think that I was biased against it for being produced by Dr. Luke, but nah the problem really is with Say So, Doja has other songs sadly produced by him that are actually good.

**akanewasright** (0): I have a host of reasons to resent this song but they boil down to this - this is the only song in this rate that makes me angry, stressed, and upset. A lot of that ties into how I felt on Grammy night when I realized Dr. Luke could win his first Grammy in 2021, but also [this happened when I tried to set up the AM playlist for this rate.](https://i.imgur.com/Sdza16s.png) Making a playlist for this rate was bizarrely stressful and involved me accidentally forgetting to drink water for a while, so me thinking I’d finished and then having this happen was… not my favorite. This song has personally inconvenienced me and it can go to hell

have I cried to a music video about a half goat man being shot in the chest and bleeding to death? yes! has it been more than once? maybe so! do I care that it might be slightly embarrassing? no!

This was one of the wildcards of the rate, to me. Most songs I generally knew how they would do (ex. most of the bottom region of the rate), but this song was either going to be incredibly successful or a massive flop. And boy, was I glad it wasn't the latter. This is honestly one of my favorite "Tiktok songs that are actually good" songs and genuinely happy Joji has found the success that he has after doing weird meme shit for so long.

---

#IN. THE. DAAAAAARRRRRKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

**Brendon-Urine** (11): I still listen to Joji's stuff but I'm quite confident he'll never match this song. It's just got magic in it, I didn't know it went viral on TikTok but I'm glad. This is a song that deserves it.

**matthewc20090** (11): this song enables my loneliness

**2dina3dworld** (10): who would’ve known that Filthy Frank would go from screaming externally to screaming internally

**AHSWeeknd** (10): went off

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): now this is how you make a sadboy anthem

**camerinian** (10): Is… Is this one of the best songs of the 2010s? I know it's a big call, but I honestly just think this song might be perfect. Joji's obviously doing a very popular sadboi mumble, but cutting through it on that wailing, grief-stricken chorus really hits home just how fantastic the dynamics and the atmosphere is. This is gonna be a karaoke staple as soon as I can find a bar that doesn't have a song list 5 years out of date

**cheatviathan** (10): I would have thought that only hearing the Carl Wheezer cover would taint my perception of this track, but that didn’t happen. This is phenomenal. I think it’s the revving synths in conjunction with Joji’s emotive vocal performance which hits me most with this track.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly filthy frank becoming a legit good artist was not in my 2020 bingo

**GARjuna** (10): GODDAMN filthy frank can sing

**ImADudeDuh** (10): now why did I go from aggressively hating this man for saying slurs his whole youtube career and even worse, starting the harlem shake, to fucking STANNING this song.

**jasannn** (10): This song makes me want to simp in my car at 2am.

**pig-serpent** (10): I used to be completely in love with this song and at the time it was the best Joji had mashed his atmosphere with a great hook and interesting instrumentation (those piano arps in the background are great!) so even if I don't listen to it as much anymore I still think it's a fantastic song.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i was obsessed with this song when it first came out and i’m still not over it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): fantastic production and great vocals, who would’ve expected Joji to be so damn good

**seanderlust** (10): joji talking about this track: "I like ballads people should get into them" joji anti-popheads confirmed

**sssaaage** (10): no bc why is this song so good

**steelstepladder** (10): :floating:

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoEm5b/

**TiltControls** (10): if WAP weren't here this would've been an easy 11

**wavingwolves** (10): hedgehog floating gif

**welcome2thejam** (10): An all-timer chorus on this song. That final climax is probably the best single moment of any song in the main rate (if you add the bonus rate then the award goes to, of course, the first fifteen seconds of Jesus Is The One)

**bigbigbee** (9.5): As someone who was familiar with Joji when he was Filthy Frank, I cannot believe this man is allowed to be taken seriously as a singer of sad, emotional ballads. I begrudgingly love this song (pooh bear ascending.gif), but I honestly think his Pink Guy mixtape stuff is more sonically interesting, even though the lyrics are…uhhhhh……..bad……..don’t go look them up.

**bbfan132** (9): :floating:

**bluepupz** (9): Joji's music is just vibes and I'm here for it. This is the type of music that I would play in the background while talking with friends at 3 am.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): One ex-friend stanned his music and made me listen to this album. I just didn't get it other than this song, which is way better than it has any right to be. So evocative.

**Hulnia** (9): As someone who’s been with this guy since the Pink Guy era (not proud but it is what it is 😬), I think most of his stuff is pretty mid, but god damn this song is something else. 

 It’s fucking beautiful, and I’m so glad that it found success.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): This actually slaps!

**kreddit2** (9): i really like this song

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (9): take a shot

**schwiftydude047** (9): honestly this feels pretty good to listen to when you’re trying to take a nap.

**flibbityflob** (8.5): this is so fucking good but also in my mind he's eternally filthy frank so this is extremely funny.

**nt96** (8.5): Years later, I'm still shook that this was Filthy Frank.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): really solid song with sweet instrumentals. my only complaint is the vocal production/mixing

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i still hear this audio today...the impact

**1998tweety** (8): vibey

**ignitethephoenix** (8): sometimes I cannot believe this man was filthy Frank and popularized the Harlem shake

**jsonphile** (8): ehhh from what I’ve heard about Joji I expected to like this more. It’s good, certainly better than most of the songs on here, but I don’t think it’s that great

**throwaway7650** (8): wow I liked this much more than I thought I would... joji/filthy frank (that's him!) still has the best PR in the world though

**Uberpigeon** (8): i will never forget someone saying joji is lorde for boys. it really made me think how funny it is that straight guys are much more willing to enjoy this kind of music when its by a man and "marketed" to them and by funny i mean misogynistic

**vayyiqra** (8): Has anyone else ever noticed how many songs and other things are either called or are about dancing in the dark, to the point it's become a cultural trope; because I have many times before. Anyway I like this because of its vibe even though Popheads will hate it for being so slow

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): sad

**jman457** (7.5): He is better songs but its good for what it is

**ProfeNeuro** (7.5): I would’ve been eternally grateful for “Run” (his best single, easy 10, maybe even an 11), this one is also pretty good.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.2): GIVE ME REASONS WE SHOULD BE COMPLETE

**hephaestionline** (7): reminds me of someone I (kinda maybe) friend-ghosted

**Roxieloxie** (7): yall using ballads on tiktok?

**rslashpoopheads** (7): DAE filthy frank? haha. lol.

**runaway3212** (7): I think this could be a lot better but it ends up kinda mid

**Square\_Preparation55** (6.6): decent song, just a little bland, but the sound effects are cool

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): I only know a few other Joji songs but I have no idea why this seems to be his most popular song? I just think it's a bit boring

**2RINITY** (6): I'm a spiritual lyrical individual Spiritual miracle lyrical individual Spiritual miracle individual Skippin' and flippin' and dippin' And skippin' and flippin' and dippin' Fuck Lil Wayne! And the government's corrupt! Fuck the government, 'cause I don't give a FUCK!

**aestheticen** (6): I used to like this song, but I'm kinda over it. At least it's something different though I guess?

**arhmaer** (6): i suppose i can expect nothing from this guy if not tiktok fame. this is actually WAY better than i expected from him, just a bit obvious - liked it tho, that chorus was great

**whatsanillinois** (5): it's fine but also fuck this filthy frank asshat.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): all sadboy music is the same

**letsallpoo** (4): i do not trust this man

**thedoctordances1940** (3.5): plainly uninteresting

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): Sorry. Blandblandbland let me just listen to Frank Ocean. Get these Frank Ocean knockoffs out of my headphones!! meme of old dude grimacing as he takes headphones off

**duochromepalmtree** (3): mumble core. It’s boring. Even the “big” parts.

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I always hate it when celebrities with larger-than-life personalities decide they want to make pop music, and then the stuff they make is just… completely devoid of any of it. No I’m not asking for a Filthy Frank R&B track lol just a song that doesn’t sound like he’s gonna fall asleep before he reaches the chorus

**plastichaxan** (1): i don't get the hype for joji or this song at all

This song is incredibly successful in pulling me straight back to the beginning of quarantine, when I was still trying to make heads and tails of being forced to flee a country and come back to the states because of COVID. It's just such a fun song and sounds like bright, sunny days with its super dope vibes and stuff. Shame that I couldn't fully get into BENEE's debut as it just sounds like bait to get onto the POLLEN Spotify playlist ~~(do the POLLEN Rate)~~ but this song is a standout for BENEE and I'm glad it found success not only on Tiktok but this rate!

---

#I'M A LONELY, OOO, AAA,

**IIIHenryIII** (11): I'm a straight guy but this is my anthem. 1M A LONELY B1TCH (SUPALONELY)

**2dina3dworld** (10): I don’t have anything interesting or funny to say so I will just ask something that’s been bugging me: is it just me or does BENEE look like Björk?

**aestheticen** (10): Takes me back to lockdown, where I worked out for 2 weeks consistently. I know that's a very random thing to mention but I just associate lockdown and this song to that. This would have been my 11 if not for my actual 11 in the rate.

**Awkward\_King** (10): if u all rob this because its overplayed you are not fun and are ugly, bop bop bop

**cremeebrulee** (10): the way this song lowkey caused the pandemic, she rly said if i have to be a lonely freak the rest of yall will be too

**CrimsonROSET** (10): how many comments are gonna be about how the male feature brings the score down

**duochromepalmtree** (10): the first time I heard this song I could not stop listening to it. I think it’s genius pop songwriting. This is also an actual example of a song blowing up organically on the platform.

**hephaestionline** (10): official anthem of the pandemic, zoomers, and quaranteens

**Hulnia** (10): Move over Lorde, we have a new queen of New Zealand. 

 So fucking iconic, this basically summarises ANYTHING good about the shitty year of 2020.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite song discoveries last year, this is a full bop and a mood

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck me, this is such a cute bop. It’s gen z irony in a perfect song that feels just corporate enough that I can feel it, but don’t care.

**matthewc20090** (10): this song cured my depression

**nt96** (10): One time I burned tf out of my eyes because the shampoo bottle said "Tearless", I read it wrong. Anyway, stream Hey u x.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): The original's pretty cool, but [the mashup with "I Gotta Feeling" is even cooler.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muvXhZbET_0)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): that grunt at the end of the pre chorus is perhaps the most satisfying sound ever

**rslashpoopheads** (10): ok I'm gonna be honest I first heard this on the radio and I really thought someone dug an old justin bieber recording out of the vault and I was like damn I can't believe he's calling himself a bitch

**runaway3212** (10): yass bitch it's the smasher

**schwiftydude047** (10): I can relate to the isolation and loneliness. granted most of us do, but that doesn’t mean this isn’t a bop.

**steelstepladder** (10): IM A LONELY BITCH

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): a bop

**vayyiqra** (10): This would be kind of annoying but there is something so endearing about the way she says "I'M A LONELY BITCH" because well same

**waluigiest** (10): okay my friend sent me this in early March 2020 and I loved it so much, I thought it was just a quirky indie pop song. No idea it took off on tiktok

**wavingwolves** (10): a perfect post pandemic song

**xavieryes** (10): Quarantine anthem. It's just so fucking good and relatable. That "UGHHHHH" is just cathartic.

**BoneStreetSand** (9.5): The song that headlined my university internship.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): this is just so fun, we love a sad bop! would be a 10 without the feature, which feels a bit unnecessary

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): such a bop but what is that gus dapperton feature doing

**ProfeNeuro** (9.2): nu-disco is great

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): lol relatable

**camerinian** (9): GRRRRRRRRRR for best two seconds of the rate

**cheatviathan** (9): The self-deprecating tone of the lyrics actually works well opposite some gorgeous vocal harmonies, and a great instrumental with some slap bass and cool organ parts. Gus Dapperton’s contributions in the final third work better than I expected them to as well.

**jasannn** (9): The theme song to early pandemic.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (9): I've been lonely, mmm 👄 ahh 😛

**pig-serpent** (9): I love the juxtaposition of a warm bassline and comforting synth tones with the lyrics.

**skargardin** (9): now this was such a bop

**stryxen** (9): HRNGGGGGGGGGGGGG

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1X58d/

**Uberpigeon** (9): i been lonely ooh ah yeah! HOWEVER... this is so fucking catchy but its so long for what it is. this SHOULD have been one of those dreaded sub-3 minute songs. also i cant abide gus dapperton he has a stupid name and i skip when i hear him show up

**jsonphile** (8.5): definitely became a hit because of lockdowns, but man is it relatable. “I’m just a loser” “I’m a lonely bitch” or the best part of the song “urgghhh!” Anyway who is Gus Dapperton and why is he on this track I literally forget his verse exists once I finish his song

**MrMoodle** (8.5): i couldn’t enjoy this song until todd in the shadows told me it was good which was deeply humiliating for me because i didn’t think i was one of those people

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): a lot of people dont like the guest verse in this song but personally i like it a lot and think it adds to the overall vibe! benee is obviously the main star of the show though and she has a wonderful voice and witty lyrics to match

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): a nice vibe

**flibbityflob** (8.4): god I love this song. very quarantine vibes, very good all the same. I love it so much.

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**2RINITY** (8): Oh hey, it's the vibing at the very start of quarantine song

**best-american-record** (8): me fuckin too

**bluepupz** (8): I dislike how some words are pronounced but overall this is a very very catchy song.

**inesmina** (8): overplayed

**sssaaage** (8): this song is so fun

**throwaway7650** (8): "I'm a lonely bitch" SO TRUE... unneeded feature though. pleek

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): of the BENEE songs I've heard, this is probably my least favorite, but it's still pretty solid. Gus does well here

**just\_thonking** (7.5): another song that straddles the annoying/catchy line, albeit pretty well

**bbfan132** (7): doesn’t need gus dapperton, benee’s parts are great on their own

**joeeswift** (7): this song brings back memories of whipped coffee and excessive tiktok usage

**LesApfels** (7): I'M A LONELY BITCH!

**jman457** (6.1): as a longtime Gus Daperton stan im glad he finally got a hit

frogaranaman: #actually are in a relationship. fuck single people

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (6): This was a nice vibe until Dapperton’s voice stormed ringing into my ears. Should’ve been a solo track.

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is one of those indie artist people along with like clario and those white women who are all somewhat slightly named phoebe that yall keep telling me exist but im still not convinced

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): nghhh this is annoying… Why is she singing like that?? Why is he singing like that??

**Verrem** (6): B A S S

**whatsanillinois** (6): such a strong chorus accompanied by a real mediocre verse

**Iris3271** (5.5): I HATED Gus Dapperton's part

**banmoderator** (3): the part that got famous on tiktok was catchy but then I listened to the rest of the song and oh god it's horrendous why does she sing like that

**kreddit2** (3): eh

**AHSWeeknd** (1): who can relate? Woo!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): "In case you haven’t noticed, I'm weird. I’m a weirdo. I don't fit in. And I don't want to fit in. Have you ever seen me without this stupid hat on? That's weird." GROUNDBREAKING.

**tinaoe** (1): MAYBE my most detested tiktok trend. maybe.

if I were a celebrity and had a semi-public relationship that ended amicably and had stan speculation I too would milk that for shit with my ex's consent

...honestly, it's a bop. And the success story that it had built from Tiktok is absolutely *absurd*, literally leading to one of the highest-streaming days on Spotify of all time. Plus, only a few months after the WAP-ening of mashups on Tiktok did Olivia get her very own "this song works with every other song" treatment that happens to any female pop star with a slightly catchy bop in an easily-transposable key. I'm proud of her, doing this all before even turning 18. What an icon!

#RED. LIGHTS. STOP. SIGNS

**Square\_Preparation55** (11): great songwriting, an amazing bridge, and I feel like this song is the biggest representation of how much impact TikTok really has had on the music industry

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now. this as your debut?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this’ll probably win the rate

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): all hail Olivia Rodrigo, our new overlord

**best-american-record** (10): cause i still fuckin love you babe

**duochromepalmtree** (10): it’s rare to get to see the birth of an instant classic. I think we will be listening to this song on easy listening radio for the rest of our lives. Beyond overplayed but that doesn’t erase the absolute magic Olivia created with this one.

**educationalmirror** (10): I forget that this is a tiktok song because it transcended that but yeah, the biggest song of 2021 was a tiktok song

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): Fuck Joshua Bassett for leaving his underage girlfriend

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Never forget all the fucking thinkpieces about where this song came from and all the popheads going “I dOnT gEt It” when this song was first exploding out of nowhere even though it’s literally just a teen breakup song. Imagine how TIRED we were of it all.

**intheaftermath** (10): good 4 u being overplayed really gave me a new appreciation for this one

**jasannn** (10): Even though I'm 22 and haven't really experienced heartbreak, I can really feel the pain and hurt through her delivery on this song and the rest of SOUR.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i do not envy frog having to pick which of the stale joke comments for this song is the least stale for the banner

**schwiftydude047** (10): Olivia went out with a bang for her first single…even if I prefer the others over this one.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): A better bridge for driving than Chappaquiddick

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyofJ5C/

**throwaway7650** (10): always ready to support a fellow asian (yes she is asian, shut up ARMYs) in this rate. I've loved this since the day it came out

**TiltControls** (10): RED LIGHTS. STOP SIGNS

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): that bridge still hits hard

**waluigiest** (10): I’m sorry but compared to the rest of this rate this song is of absurd quality

**akanewasright** (9.9): Is this overhyped? Yeah. Is it a little obnoxious and melodramatic? Oh yeah. Is shouting “I still fucking love you” at an Olivia Rodrigo concert a long term goal of mine now? You betcha

**shhhneak** (9.9): Bridge stronger than American infrastructure.

**celladonn** (9.5): it's good or whatever

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): it’s good bye

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9.5): Throwback to everyone frantically googling "who is olivia rodrigo" in January

**Awkward\_King** (9): is this the best song ever made? no. but its so fucking good. why do i feel like olivia is both gonna be overrated and overhated in this rate... hopefully it levels out to a fair placement sjdjs

**banmoderator** (9): trended bc it's a good song, not bc there was one relatable verse quoted out of context

**bluepupz** (9): RED LIGHTS, STOP SIGNS... The bridge is great, definitely my favorite part of the song.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the popheads discord saying this was worse than party rock anthem lives rent free in my head

**GARjuna** (9): production is rly goood

**hephaestionline** (9): I'M SORRY OLIVIA FOR SKIPPING THE [FRESH] THREAD OF THIS SONG UNTIL I SAW THE SPOTIFY NUMBERS A DAY LATER. I'm 100% a Rodrighoe now. That being said, jealousy jealousy is the song of the year.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): One word: bridge! What can I say? She learned from the best.

**jsonphile** (9): ahhh nice to hear a song I recognize again. Yeah it’s a great song. And an amazing bridge. Why am I talking about this song we’ve all heard enough discourse about this song. Anyway jealousy jealousy best song in the album

**just\_thonking** (9): yes it's derivative but that's outweighed by how good it is to sing in the shower

**kreddit2** (9): i used to not like this song and I was VERY VERY WRONG. in retrospect, i probably just had very high initial expectations because of the hype, but once the hype over this song died (and was transferred to deja vu/good 4 u) I relistened and it just CLICKED. still a stand-out track on sour!! am so happy she's successful :D + unpopular opinion but the bridge is NOT the best part of this song it's "you said forever now i drive alone past your street!!" i really love the tones of resignation in that line....

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): still such a great song, that bridge!! love a sad song to drive home to after a long day

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): still bangs but when i listen to it i have such a strong association of cold snowy winter nights walking back from class and all the girls in my dorm blasting this in the halls and showers

**rickikardashian** (9): i wonder where olivia’s career would be now if she had failed her driving test

**rotating3Dtext** (9): it may be a little over dramatic, like girl you are 17, but that bridge gives me goosebumps

**seanderlust** (9): listen, I know when we reviewed our side of the indieheads exchange I rated this song badly but i'm in my pitchfork re-reviewing vroom vroom era so

**tinaoe** (9): i mean c'mon but it's not my fave from sour so

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): She excels at something a lot of people, especially on this list, forget is just as important as singing in tune: singing with emotion

**aestheticen** (8.5): Do I even need to comment on this?

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I didn’t love it at first but it grew on me. Still not her best song though

**xavieryes** (8.5): while i'm mildly bored of this song, i still find it a pretty good ballad, and the bridge is still just perfect

**2dina3dworld** (8): does this mean that we can’t rate Sour?

**camerinian** (8): I flip between “Perfectly fine song that got an inexplicable amount of attention for no discernible reason” and “one of the most pristine pop creations in years” and I still haven’t really decided where I fall yet

**cheatviathan** (8): I fall just outside the target demographic for this song and this album, but this still hit me. The lyrical details are certainly personal and unique, and the bridge hits hard. It’s not the best track from that album, but it’s still more than deserving of the initial hype it received.

**flibbityflob** (8): finally some good fucking food. that slow descending synth is SO good, olivia's voice is so good, and yeah. hits different after some stuff that went on in my life.

=====

frogaranaman: **Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): I'm 22 and still have no clue about driving!

**pig-serpent** (8): "I GUESS YOU DIDN'T MEAN WHAT YOU WROTE IN THAT SONG ABOUT ME" is such a strong line that it carries the entire song up to an 8.

**plastichaxan** (8): this always gets to me i always think it’s fine and then the bridge comes and my score goes up a lot, also i admit that i’d rate it higher in other circumstances but i don’t want to see this win

**rslashpoopheads** (8): hot take the bridge is cringe and the worst part of the song but it's still good

**Uberpigeon** (8): ugh the lyrics are so teenager but the performance really sells them... u go girl miss olivia.

**vayyiqra** (8): no one thought this would be a better Lorde song than anything Lorde put out this year and yet

**veryanniev** (8): 8 for that bridge alone

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): To imagine that there was a time earlier this year when I, a fully grown 25 year old gay man, wasn't obsessed with music from this 17 year old teen girl

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): There are better songs off SOUR!!! But I appreciate the drama and magnetism of the song.

**jman457** (7.6): really not too special outside of the cocaine bridge

**ProfeNeuro** (7.5): OMG 😳😱😨😰 MY BOYFRIEND 💁‍♂️💁‍💕❤️🔪 JUST BROKE UP 🆙😳😳😔💔💔💔💔 WITH ME👩‍🦰👩‍🦰 AND NOW IN THE SUBURBS 🏠🏡🏠🏠🏘 I💁‍♀️😞 LEARNED 👩‍🏫👩‍🏫👨‍🏫🧪📔 TO 2️⃣ DRIVE 🚗🚙 AND I DRIVE 🚘🚗🚙 PAST THE CHIPOTLE 🌯🌯🌮🥬🍚♨️🥩 WE 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️👩‍❤️‍👨 USED TO ⬅️⬅️⏪ EAT 🌮🎂🍕🍪 AND KISS 😘😘💋👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨😳😳 AT, I 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️ HOPE YOURE 🧑👨👆👇 HAPPY 😀😊😌 WITH THAT BLONDE 👩👩👩🏼👩🏼👩 BITCH 😡😡🤬🥵😡💃💉🔪⚰️🔪🗡🔪

**runaway3212** (7.5): Driving??? In my gay rate??? It's more likely than you think

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i wasnt impressed with it my first few listens but it does slowly grow on you the more you hear it. would probably like it more if i could relate to it someway but unfortunately i have never had a relationship and i also never passed my drivers test so i dont have a license lol

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): the 2 week span where popheads discoursed about this song before actually listening to it or using other social media was iconic

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): so where do we think this will land when we rate Sour??? better or worse than here??

**MrMoodle** (7): i’ve been extremely meh on this song up until now but i’m listening to it with a decent pair of headphones and i think i’m getting the appeal, she kind of kills it on the vocals ngl. i still think the transition into the bridge feels super forced and clunky and i don’t like the claps.

**nt96** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD1vCd1oKC0

**ReallyCreative** (7): quite literally one of the most homophobic songs released in recent memory, I have no idea why Olive Garden gets the support she does. Everyone knows the gays can't drive, it's just sickening that she would flaunt her driver's license. Millie Bobby Brown's apprentice.

**welcome2thejam** (7): A case of me being way too past this song's demographic for it to hit like it should, but boy, I think it'd be a 10 if I were.

**bbfan132** (6.5): overplayed but decent

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): It's a pretty decent ballad, though I much prefer "good 4 u" over this one. (This is coming from someone who hasn't listened to "SOUR" in full.)

#fuck teen angst! AGAIN!!

**bigbigbee** (6): I actually like SOUR’s other tracks, but I just don’t hear what’s so special or noteworthy about this song. Nothing distinguishes this for me from other nice ballads on the radio.

**Iris3271** (5.5): Olivia has a lovely voice but this song puts me to sleep I'm sorry

**arhmaer** (5): what is wrong with teenagers why do they have so many FEELINGS

**sssaaage** (5): at least its better than every non brutal sour song

**teenwitches** (5): maybe i'm just an old but i'll never understand why y'all hyped this up so bad

**wavingwolves** (4.3): while i can admit that this song has some cool details and elements i really hate the overall vocal delivery and i just feel like olivia is constantly holding herself back from giving an actual great vocal performance by doing her best bananis and avocadis impression

**2RINITY** (4): I'm sorry, but any song that starts off reminding me of "The Reason" by Hoobastank is automatically gonna be a bad time for me. Thank God Olivia proved this wasn't the only trick in her bag

**qazz23** (4): One of her weaker songs, takes a while to get going

**Roxieloxie** (4): so glad she dropped more songs so i can hate this in peace

**steelstepladder** (4): Yeah I guess I'm just heartless because I feel nothing

**Hulnia** (3): I love some of Olivia’s music, but I’ll never understand the love for this song. Maybe it’s just balladphobia, but I just find it hard to listen to. 

 That being said, that bridge gets me every time. 😩

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (3): please move on from high school there is so much more to life please girl holy fuck move out of your town

**Brendon-Urine** (2): got sick of this song after hearing it like twice, let alone a million times

**astrologicalangel** (0): I'm sorry but the number of times I had to hear this at work, it's dead to me

One of the few songs we've rated before in this rate, I actually only started warming up to this song recently. Something about it was kind of just boring before and I never really bothered to care for it, but now I kind of really dig the guitar line and the washed-out instrumentation. This was one of those songs that was on the fence of being in the rate since we had already rated it before and it almost felt repetitive, but the song *did* chart because of Tiktok making it viral so I figured it was worth an inclusion to see how it did. Which, unsurprisingly, is well!

---

#they can do it! if they try!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): one of the best indie pop songs of the last decade i fear

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is the best wlw song in the rate i fear

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly i had the same thought before but it was about the cowboy bebop protagonist

**Hulnia** (10): A true lesbian anthem, that fucking guitar interlude goes so fucking hard.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Sling is a great album.

**jman457** (10): she is the ultimate lo-fi/bedroom pop tik tok girl

**nootnoot781** (10): who’s fucking idea was it to pair up this song with cassie from skins going “i’ll love you forever sid”.

**nt96** (10): I'm getting heavy, sparkly suburban vibes and I love it.

**plastichaxan** (10): i wonder how clairo feels knowing no song of hers comes close to being this good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I should’ve sent this to AS4 tbh

**rickikardashian** (10): i dont want you fuckers rating clairo again you’re always mean to her for no damn reason

**sssaaage** (10): when it gets crunchy i died

**stryxen** (10): my 11 once upon a time so let me just not give it it again. flop!

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I wanted to do this trend looking for a guy who looks like Kaidan Alenko and maybe if I did I would have a boyfriend who looks like Kaidan Alenko. I guess we'll never know.

**throwaway7650** (10): one of those songs that I kept raising the score of until it was a 10, the production is actually really good, especially the noisier section? wow

**wavingwolves** (10): 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩

**Uberpigeon** (9.6): I THINK WE COULD DO IT IF WE TRY!!!

**bbfan132** (9.5): <3 this’ll probably do well, rightfully so

**1998tweety** (9): pretty

**2dina3dworld** (9): okay this is the pumpkin spice latte of wlw music but it still bangs.

**aestheticen** (9): I don't recall liking this back then, not sure what clicked and now it sounds more interesting than I remembered

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): Maybe she's... stoned at the wlw salon

**hephaestionline** (9): commenting to stay on LGBTQ TikTok

**jsonphile** (9): solid song.

**runaway3212** (9): 'Sofia you and I shouldn't feel like a crime' is such a poignant lyric and that really makes me love this song so much

**schwiftydude047** (9): I get this stuck in my head every so often and I have no complaints in the slightest.

**steelstepladder** (9): This song is fine and then it goes into HYPERDRIVE and it becomes great

**waluigiest** (9): Rostam popped off

**welcome2thejam** (9): When that scuzzy, in-your-ear guitar explodes and then its immediate transition back... suuuuch a great section

**flibbityflob** (8.8): the crunch synth that hits at the 1:42 mark is so good it almost makes me ignore the rest of the song. which is a shame, because like, i am a nb lesbian who's felt this way about women before. often. it's a lesbian mood.

**shhhneak** (8.6): Listen I hear a sapphic song, I like it.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): gay

**bluepupz** (8.5): The chorus is so good. I was going to give this a 9 but I don't like that staticy section in the middle lol.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.4): You know what????? I've been unimpressed with Clairo from a music standpoint BUT the production on this slaps, it's inventive, and it's a warm and cozy song. See I don't hate all modern bedroom pop!! Was Rostam going for the arpeggiated thing of Animal Collective "My Girls"/Frankie Knuckles "Your Love"??? Ya got me, Clairo!!!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): it's gay, I love it (3)

**ignitethephoenix** (8): bags outsold I’m afraid

**pig-serpent** (8): Solid hook, and I love the heavy distortion part.

**ProfeNeuro** (8): I prefer “Bags”, but this is still good.

**tinaoe** (8): by virtue of being german the one goddamn song that always pops into my head is alvero solar's sofia and for the pure fact that clairo gives me an earworm for ANOTHER song this is getting deduced some points

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I’m surprised by how much this song grew on me after hearing it on my local alt station for so long… the static is still annoying though

**kreddit2** (7.9): very mid 2000s indie

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7.5): the better industry plant

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): This song's pretty neat. Some of the TikToks from the challenge this song spawned are bloody hilarious.

**2RINITY** (7): Feels like the pieces are there for the song to be a 9, they're just not quite put together yet

**intheaftermath** (7): stream Amoeba

**matthewc20090** (7): good chorus

**qazz23** (7): The distorted guitar solo makes this one

**rslashpoopheads** (7): im sorry but clairo songs are so boring

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf18S1W/

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): sorry to this girl but this song came and went without much fanfare

#fuck sapphics1!!!!!!!!!

**AHSWeeknd** (6): this is about to get three elevens for some reason.

**duochromepalmtree** (6): always here for more wlw songs but this just doesn’t connect for me. I can’t seem to get into her no matter how hard I try!

**thedoctordances1940** (6): I still don't really get clairo

**vayyiqra** (6): Clairo is uninteresting to me mostly but this is okay

**cheatviathan** (5): I want to like this. The vocal melody is sweet, but not overly so, and the instrumental has some interesting shifts. But goddamn the mixing on this one is not the best. Why is the bridge so heavily caked in distortion? Why are the vocals in the last thirty seconds so much louder than in the rest of the song?

**my friend Ethan** (5): boston realness yass

**Roxieloxie** (5): who are these people

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): clairo songs be like “i like women 4 chords of pop guitar solo”

**camerinian** (3.5): I really don’t get the hype for Clairo, never have. We are in a golden age of femme singer-songwriters with wide-ranging genre influences, so why you'd choose to listen to Clairo over any of her contemporaries with more interesting and vibrant musical pallettes or more evocative and poetic writing is mystifying to me

**ImADudeDuh** (0): uh oh! It’s still bad!

fuck you Jason Derulo pay for your crimes against humanity

---

**aestheticen** (11): It still sucks though

**bigbigbee** (11): I actually like this song, sorry. my college professors lied, sometimes plagiarism does work

**cremeebrulee** (11): i didn't want to do this

**CrimsonROSET** (11): i'll have it be known this song would be my 0 if it was in the main rate

**HogwartsReject1912** (11): I love this song and I'm not ashamed to say it

**hookerofpop** (11): 😔

**jackisboredtoday** (11): very bad but I guess the success of mediocre hitmakers from 10 years ago doing very similar styles to their old stuff is comforting that no matter how much changes in this world a few things can still be the same

**nt96** (11): I dont like Jason Derulo, but his vocals has a much fuller sound.

**seanderlust** (11): okay listen, let me first say that i dont like either of these songs. i am giving jason derulo the 11 not because i like this version of Savage Love, nor is it because i am a BTS anti, but it's because every time i see jason derulo's name now i think of the time he got hacked on twitter and the hacker-as-jason tweeted at james charles, "shake some ass you sexy juicy [f-word]". and you know what? jason derulo doesn't deserve that. he's done nothing but make danceable-if-not-good bops for his entire career (as far as i know, at least). so jason, as an apology, here - have an 11.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): just found out Jason Derulo's birth name is Jason Desrouleaux (pronounced the same way) and he gets the 11 just for that

**TragicKingdom1** (11): king of tiktok

**2RINITY** (0): because Jason Derulo is the only one singing

**AHSWeeknd** (0): This was never it

**akanewasright** (0): The way Jason Derulo behaved about this whole situation was honest to god fucking disgusting, and since these two songs are 90% the same, he earns the 0 for that

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): this is the most creatively bankrupt song I have ever heard

**cheatviathan** (0): This one has slightly more time filled by obnoxious Jason Derulo vocals than the other one

**flibbityflob** (0): not as good as CATS 2019 and that's just the long and short of it!

**GARjuna** (0): I'll be honest it's fine?? I don't get the hate

**hephaestionline** (0): once I hear a song on those foreign variety shows, I've decided it's overplayed (and they played it for a very good chunk of 2020)

**ImADudeDuh** (0): THIEF!

**jsonphile** (0): why did this man ruin a song that I already hated

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (0): no

**RandomHypnotica** (0): look he still has a credit on the BTS remix he'll be fine with this 0

**Roxieloxie** (0): what the fuck is this song I have no words

**runaway3212** (0): im not gonna lie im giving this score based purely on ethics because I truly think both versions are unlistenable. I think it's one thing to like join on a succesfull song to get an easy no.1, it's a whole different story to steal somebody's beat who is currently discussing with multiple people who to sell it too, somebody who is 17 no less, as a 31 year old man, I just truly find it so disgusting, so fuck you jason derulo I hope you don't understand when she talks dirty to you

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): the 60s do not have a monopoly on co-dependency anthems, and this one doesn't even sound good!

**slimboyfriend** (0): One of the only things in the world that could make me hate this song even more was a Jason Derulo feature

**stryxen** (0): :audience:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): absolutely not

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (0): https://variety.com/2020/music/news/jason-derulo-tiktok-controversy-savage-love-laxed-siren-beat-1234609101/

**thedoctordances1940** (0): This used to be absolutely intolerable to me so I'm confused as to how I'm not utterly despising it

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): Honestly though props to him for knowing exactly how to game the system in order to stay culturally relevant. I respect the hustle

**welcome2thejam** (0): May this help us take one step closer to bringing Jason Derulo to justice

this is inherently better because there is not as much Jason Derulo in this song

---

**2RINITY** (11): because sometimes BTS are singing instead of Jason Derulo

**AHSWeeknd** (11): the lesser of two evils

**akanewasright** (11): There are a few reasons I think this earns an 11 in this rate: one is that I think these two songs are functionally the same and I like BTS as entertainers and as people more than I do Jason Derulo. Another is that the boys cursing is, for some reason, really funny to me? Like imagine if One Direction was allowed to say "fuck" in the middle of a #1 hit. Obviously it's not the same, partially because of language barrier stuff, but it amuses me greatly that this is a thing for no good reason.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): this is still the most creatively bankrupt song I have ever heard, but now it has BTS

**cheatviathan** (11): This one has slightly less time filled by obnoxious Jason Derulo vocals than the other one.

**flibbityflob** (11): BTS gets the 11 solely because they're like...actually talented?

**hephaestionline** (11): might be in the minority that doesn't find the original grating in retrospect, and the BTS remix is a bit better than the original

**hikkaru** (11): i'll just pretend there's only a single 1 in my score

**ignitethephoenix** (11): BTS definitely improves the song which is still mediocre

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this is bad too

**inesmina** (11): but is also awful.

**jsonphile** (11): well I still hate it and BTS add absolutely nothing to the song but more time with BTS means less time with Jason Derulo so that’s a win in my book

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (11): kpop ;) uwu xdxd

**my friend Ethan** (11): this is on-par with a hate crime [**host note:** yea he looked like he was in physical pain the entire time he listened to these songs]

**plastichaxan** (11): i can't believe i'm being held at gunpoint to do this secret bonus and i have to 11 this cause at least we get a few seconds of not listening to Jason Derulo but also at what cost

**RandomHypnotica** (11): i am doing this for the safety of my friends and family

**rickikardashian** (11): kpop rights

**rotating3Dtext** (11): better than I expected, also I don't have to listen to jason derulo all the way trough

**Roxieloxie** (11): I guess

**runaway3212** (11): J-hope is hotter than jungkook and everyone who disagrees is wrong

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): it's still corny, but I respect BTS's remix-hopping hustle more than I respect Jason trying to steal beats from a teenager, and Suga's rap adds dimension to the song #JusticeForSugasInterlude

**slimboyfriend** (11): I have to give it to BTS because they manage to make the song somewhat endearing even though Jason Derulo won't go away

**stryxen** (11): :slightlysmalleraudience:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i dont care if bts wins i just need jason derulo to lose

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): https://www.somagnews.com/btss-rm-joins-kanye-wests-new-album-donda-fever/

**thedoctordances1940** (11): Parts of this don't have Derulo's vocals, that's a big improvement

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I actually hate both of these songs a lot. I may even hate the BTS one more cause they're making things worse by perpetuating the popularity of it. But ah well. Also, I'm well aware that BTS have sworn in their songs before, but somehow I still found it more shocking to hear Jungkook say the f-word than I did when I first heard Taylor Swift say it 💀

**wavingwolves** (11): that's the correct option

**cremeebrulee** (0): but fuck my ex army roommate ok!!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (0): we talk about manufacturing streams but this bonus rate is just manufacturing bts 11s! i will not stand for it!

**HogwartsReject1912** (0): Not *awful* per se, but I hate ARMYs so anything BTS gets a 0 :)

**hookerofpop** (0): 😳

**jackisboredtoday** (0): both of these are bad but somehow the BTS inclusion makes it feel more soulless. Through no fault of the band, but the addition was so shameless & showed a desperation on Columbia, Jawsh & Jason's part that was embarrassing before we get into the whole drama of ARMYs turning on it hard & add another layer of messiness to the remix

**nt96** (0): The vocals were a bit thin and frankly nauseating, then the autotuned rapping came on. I don't give two fucks about BTS and y'all BiTcheS can fight me or bite me. I said what I said 😘

**seanderlust** (0): sorry BTS. Boy With Luv is still probably the best entry on my running playlist, if it makes any armys feel better.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): honestly both of these songs were incredibly desperate attention grabs but the fact that the bts remix came second makes it sadder.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): abolish sales

this song placing so high just proves we're all truly indieheads at heart

WHAT. A. FUN. HALLOWEEN. FUCKING. BOP!!! GOD, I adore this song to death and it's genuinely one of the most unexpected Tiktok hits in recent memory. It makes total sense, though, as its boppy chorus is absolutely perfect for aesthetic videos and dances - exactly what Tiktok needs! I think my favorite video under the sound, though, was when MGMT posted one themselves; it came up on my for you page and I was like "oh nice this is a vibe", scrolled for three-four videos, then came back up and was like "now wait that's MGMT isn't it?" They absolutely KNOW how to nail a vibe and it shows super hard in this song.

#/r/indieheads subscribers

**banmoderator** (11): this album (and song) was one of the first albums to really get me into music on a deeper level. it tells such a compelling story and each track has its own individual meaning. specifically, LDA's meaning was about the USA under Trump's presidency and how terrible things truly looked. it's still topical now under the pandemic and it's just a phenomenal song. stan MGMT

**celladonn** (11): Mgmt's best song? Everything here works, it's entrancing

**Hulnia** (11): Another song where, I have no idea how it got big on the app, but I’m not complaining AT ALL. 

 MGMT are one of my favourite artists of all time, and this isn’t an exception, that production is fucking insane. 

 Let’s please give them their second rate win. :)

**intheaftermath** (11): everything about this song is immaculate... the instrumental, the lyricism, the overall vibe. I could loop this for hours and be happy

**Iris3271** (11): One of my favorite songs of all time, carries me through my bimonthly existential crises'

**just\_thonking** (11): MEGA BOP. Please if this wins (or at least gets top 5) I'll forgive popheads for making Time to Pretend win the indieheads rate

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): perfect song in general but especially for fall and halloween

**ProfeNeuro** (11): As an indieheads user (this is actually my 1st rate over at r/popheads), seeing this selection makes me very happy. MGMT released a great album in 2018, and seeing one of my favorite songs from that year make the list makes me very very happy.

**Uberpigeon** (11): I GREIVE IN STEREO, THE STEREO SOUNDS STRANGE!!!! VOTE FOR 2018 INDIE POP NEXT CYCLE!!!

**wavingwolves** (11): a better song than time to pretend

**2dina3dworld** (10): that chorus after the bridge is an absolutely magical experience. It’s comparable to Empire Ants’s instrumental transition from Damon to Little Dragon - the same magical transition that transports you into another dimension where all you can see, all you can feel, is this song.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this is pretty nice

**akanewasright** (10): This bops and also I’m friends with an MGMT stan hi Nick

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): nice spooky bop

**bbfan132** (10): deserves to be a potential winner

**best-american-record** (10): god i love this song

**cheatviathan** (10): If you had told me earlier that this was a TikTok trend, I would’ve been more motivated to make an account. I genuinely think this whole album is MGMT’s best, and that this track is the crown jewel. The more eerie, gothic tones of this track complement the lyrical themes well, and the synth bass is infectious as hell, especially the lick right before the final chorus. Another early 11 contender.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song could give me sleep paralysis and i would say thank you

**CrimsonROSET** (10): would i be mad if mgmt won two rates in a year? absolutely not

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): As a professed MGMT-hater, I've been SLEEPING on this album! This goth era of theirs is a vibe!! I gotta run to listen to this album. Sorry malchat doma, this is some cool modern goth!!

**GARjuna** (10): SUCH a dysphoria anthem for me.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): shout out to u/ResByTheBatphone for sharing this song in a mini rate in the midst of a pandemic because I really grew to like it (and also the band as well as a filthy casual)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we love the song by men that will do the best in the rate

**jman457** (10): nothing but a huge bop, would not mind seeing them win a second rate this year

**joeeswift** (10): I feel like the main character when this plays

**RandomHypnotica** (10): vote for the 2018 Indie Pop rate!

**seanderlust** (10): I should do a deep dive on MGMT to find out if they are capable of making a bad song. I guess that's how they got to the managerial level.

**steelstepladder** (10): Can't wait for MGMT to beat Sufjan and Perfume Genius again

**thedoctordances1940** (10): what a banger

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): excellent indie pop song

**Verrem** (10): finally a song that isn't a meme, also one the better MGMT songs!

**MrMoodle** (9.5): this is good. i’ve only heard MGMT’s big hits from the 2000s but i really should go through their discography at some point.

**shhhneak** (9.5): finally some good fucking food.

**bluepupz** (9): I'm kinda surprised this one's a TikTok hit, ngl. Glad it's in the rate though! I like this sort of dark-ish moody synthpop, and it was nice to see a longer song included haha.

**hephaestionline** (9): POLICEMAN SWEAR TO GOD (ACAB)

**jsonphile** (9): holy shit MGMT is popular on tiktok? Maybe there is hope for gen Z. This isn’t my favorite from them but it’s still much better than most of the music here

**ReallyCreative** (9): I'm so terrified MGMT will beat Sufjan again but this song is SO MUCH BETTER than Time to Pretend

**rickikardashian** (9): when MGMT wins another rate and absolutely no one is happy about it even though we were the ones that gave it nothing but 8+ scores

**rslashpoopheads** (9): banger

**runaway3212** (9): I hate when I like songs I feel like my old friend group would've liked

**skargardin** (9): I think im still sleeping on this album a bit

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyoWERU/

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I still have no clue what he’s saying but girl I am still living

**waluigiest** (9): id never heard this whole song, it’s neat!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Can't believe I'm potentially contributing to a potential second MGMT rate victory in a year, but there's some surprise grooves here and they created such an impressive atmosphere and mood

**stryxen** (8.5): this song is a fun lil mess (me and michael outsold)

**Awkward\_King** (8): pussy

**IIIHenryIII** (8): TikTok kids have some taste after all. There’s still hope.

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): you're not THAT edgy, please calm down

**throwaway7650** (8): really good production even if I don't care for the vocals

**vayyiqra** (8): thinking of when Popheads was mad that MGMT won a rate because they're good

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.2): I love the spooky vibes of this one, both the song and the music video. I don't think this will ever top "Kids" or "Electric Feel", but it sure comes close. The TikTok challenge this song spawned is also one of my favourites, cause some of the end-results do actually look pretty sick.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): so when are we rating an actual MGMT album

**1998tweety** (7): justice for On The Floor

**camerinian** (7): sobs I’m sorry, I just… I don’t love it

**schwiftydude047** (7): this fits the chaos of the last couple years perfectly.

**sssaaage** (7): his voice is really annoying to me and i dont like the chorus but the verses are good

**flibbityflob** (6.7): I never really got into MGMT, but this is an actual song that had musicianship put into it, which is a whole lot more than most of this list. The cover of the single version is by extremely cool ero-guro artist Suehiro Maruo, which is just cool!

**Roxieloxie** (6.6): hey this isnt indieheads

**2RINITY** (5.5): Oh boy, more 80s synthpop throwbacks, not like we already have 50 million of those

**pig-serpent** (5): I fuck with some MGMT, but I'm not sure there's much of a hook here. It's just spooky synthwave and faded vocals.

**kreddit2** (4): this is not peak MGMT

**95ztaehyung** (3.5): kinda long and monotone sorry

you know what? maybe they're right.. sawagashii hibi ni waraenaku natte ita 😔🙏🏼

WHAT. A. BOP! YOASOBI is easily one of my favorite discoveries from Tiktok and every song they release does NOT disappoint. I'm glad the subreddit really bopped to this song, it's highly deserving of all the praise it gets and absolutely is one of my favorite bangers of this rate.

---

#SAWAGASHII HIBI NI WARAENAKU NATTE ITA

**1998tweety** (11): the absolute SERVE. I know this song is fairly new but it still makes me feel really nostalgic.

**aestheticen** (11): Easiest 11 I have ever decided on in a rate. This song is truly one of the best songs I have ever heard in my life. The chord progression, the key change, the piano... everything about is perfect. It's definitely more amazing once you realise what those lyrics mean (spoiler alert: it's about suicide.)

**bigbigbee** (11): I’ve loved J-pop for over 10 years now, and so I’ve heard a lot of it. But even still, every now and then, a song comes along and floors me. This is one of them. The sparkling piano notes that constantly provide countermelodies to the singer’s clear, beautiful vocals; the way that the song, which gradually increases in energy, grants a brief, quiet reprieve in the final chorus before coming back in a euphoric explosion of sound; the BRIDGE!! I’ve listened to this a frightening amount of times in the past month. Thanks voters for voting this in!!

**bluepupz** (11): I love this. I was fully expecting myself to give Say So my 11, but this brings me back to my days of listening to tons of Vocaloid songs in high school. Plus, is that a key change I hear?

**cheatviathan** (11): A j-pop song whose lyrics tackle themes of depression and suicide, wrapped in a dynamic vocal performance and a propulsive instrumental with a killer bassline and some cool keyboard parts, and TWO key changes in the final minute? This was an early contender for my 11 going into the rate, and only a few songs came close to topping it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): the fucking song of all time

**throwaway7650** (11): an 11 for the keyboard/synthesizer (whatever instrument that is, the producer went the fuck off) alone... this is top 1 here, period

**AHSWeeknd** (10): went off

**akanewasright** (10): apparently this took her to #1 with her debut single in Japan and like… spill. This is incredible

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this is a bop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is an ANTHEM. I knew it before I realized it was a TikTok song haha. It's such a bop!! I'm obsessed with it.

**GARjuna** (10): this is really good!!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok this isn’t vocaloid technically, but the producer normally works with Vocaloid and this style is VERY reminiscent of it. Anyway, we need the vocaloid rate

**rickikardashian** (10): do you know those stan twitter edits people make where they grab the climax of a song and play sped-up videos of people running, dancing, falling, shaking their head, etc? that’s what my brain looks like each time i listen to this

**runaway3212** (10): You know what? exactly bitch spill

**seanderlust** (10): shoutout to the piano player just going APESHIT on this track

**sssaaage** (10): YASSSSSSSSSSSS

**tinaoe** (10): BOPS

**wavingwolves** (10): WHAT A MOTHERFUCKING SMASH OMFG⁉️⁉️ IF THIS ISN'T TOP 5 JUST BURN THE WHOLE SUBREDDIT

**kreddit2** (9.5): it's captivating idk how else to describe it

**banmoderator** (9): wait this song was really fun, including the non tiktok parts! the piano went hard and vocals were clean

**CrimsonROSET** (9): This has anime opening energy. If only there was a rate with more songs in this style up for voting in the next cycle.

**Hulnia** (9): I hate the reason I recognise this (and TikTok isn’t the reason), but it’s still fucking great.

**schwiftydude047** (9): this would be an awesome choice for a shonen anime intro.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): GOD why do kickass J-pop songs always throw everything off with the most nonsensical key changes?? I was so prepared to give this song a 10 but I can’t justify that when the second to last chorus sounds so off-key!

**veryanniev** (9): guys, there’s even a key change

**flibbityflob** (8.9): oh the vocaloid heritage is so strong and also SO good. YOASOBI are big in japan right now, and deservedly so.

**matthewc20090** (8.8): anime as FUUUUUCK

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): The piano hits a sweet spot but I do feel like, other than the also great vocals, there's something missing in the track to confidently push it into full-mark territory for me.

**ReallyCreative** (8.1): fun! I will say, like many songs of this ilk, there are moments where less could be more with the piano. Overall, a really cool bop!

**2RINITY** (8): See, THIS is how you do depressing shit, you turn it into a dance party to balance out the lyrics

**bbfan132** (8): the instrumental is super fun

**brenda\_official** (8): never heard this song on tik tok ?

**inesmina** (8): cute

**jsonphile** (8): okay kinda dig the groove on this

**stryxen** (8): good song

**teenwitches** (8): you could tell me this was from a jrpg and i'd believe you

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1Qw2Q/

**vayyiqra** (8): Channelling my hidden inner weeb and love of funk guitar and bopping to this

**Verrem** (7.8): never heard of this, it's fun!

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (7.5): I'm a weeb

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): cute bop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): i like the energy here

**jman457** (7.2): Sounds like a fun time

**educationalmirror** (7): cute :) apparently its about depression but still

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I need to learn Japanese.

**pig-serpent** (7): Imagine trying to make serious J-rock music and having a bunch of westerners constantly saying your music would make a good anime opening because most anime use mediocre J-rock songs for their opening credits. This song is better than the average anime opening at least.

**ProfeNeuro** (7): izza vibe

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.3): "Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance." -André 3000

**rslashpoopheads** (6): cool

I’m gay and sad, I have to give this a 10

The version that was viral on Tiktok is *technically* pitched up, but eh that's most Tiktok hits anyways. It doesn't really matter anyways, this song is genuinely so fucking incredible. So beautifully written, so beautifully performed, so beautifully Sufjan. This song makes me cry every time. "Visions of Gideon" makes me sob. That is all.

---

#yeah we're gay and we cry, keep scrolling

**avg-vag** (11): it’s sufjan, it’s a masterpiece in a sea of sub fives.

**BoneStreetSand** (11): OH TO SEE WITHOUT MY EYES—

**brenda\_official** (11): tik tok kinda ruined this but not completely

**HogwartsReject1912** (11): I love this song so much y'all have no clue. ROBBED at the Oscars.

**jman457** (11): Daddy sufjan really came in with a song that will be on my sad boi hours playlist for years.

**ReallyCreative** (11): Sufjan looking at the gays like "It's 4pm babes, time for your daily emotional breakdown to my music!" Yes honey indeed

**seanderlust** (11): one of my favorite sufjan songs - and given that i am such a fan, those are high honors. the plucking guitars, the ethereal feeling, the gorgeous lyrics - flawless. if this song were a place I would never want to leave.

**shhhneak** (11): I’m so sorry but I still love CMBYN despite the abusive cannibal. I saw that shit four times in theatres and cried every time.

**tinaoe** (11): i know i know cannibal song but this song was legit my top spotify song of 2020 SO

**Verrem** (11): My favourite song on this playlist by far! So beautiful.

**waluigiest** (11): I’m so glad he wrote this for Luca it’s so beautiful

**AHSWeeknd** (10): this is really good

**akanewasright** (10): I asked some friends of mine, most of them gay, whether I should see Call Me By Your Name recently and the responses ranged from “no because it’s bad” to “no because it’s good but also it’s bad” to “just listen to the Sufjan songs, they’re the best things to come out of the movie” and I think the last person spilled

**Awkward\_King** (10): im so sorry i dont feel good about loving this as much as i do but my god its so beautiful, lemme skip it 20 seconds in otherwise ill have to watch the film

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): it's gay, I love it (2)

**bbfan132** (10): i don’t use tiktok but this is probably a song that would come up constantly for me if i did use it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://i.imgur.com/3bLXV9K.png

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I have a real physical reaction when I hear this song. It is just so beautiful and is honestly borderline ASMR.

**flibbityflob** (10): thank you sufjan i owe you my life. he has a thing about nieces but this is so good i truly don't care. deserved an oscar.

**hephaestionline** (10): obligatory handle is in the lyrics so I can't give this less than a 10

**Hulnia** (10): When the fuck are we having a Sufjan album rate?

**IIIHenryIII** (10): How did Sufjan get a TikTok hit? This is so odd. Anyway, I'm just glad to be listening to one of his songs in a Popheads rate.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck Call Me By Your Name

**jasannn** (10): I wish I could relate.

**kreddit2** (10): the only reason it's not an 11 is bc of visions of gideon. but wow this is perfect - the lyrics!! the vocals!! the instrumentals!! it feels so classic and timeless

**plastichaxan** (10): i like this song but not in a call me by your name stan white twink type of way but in an indie alternative i hate the movie but love sufjan type of way

**ProfeNeuro** (10): wait this is tiktok care? well anyways, if it weren’t for MGMT, this would’ve gotten my eleven. wait, was that the right decision?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we stan Sufjan in this househould

**rickikardashian** (10): my life will never be as cinematic as when i cried to this on a terrace in italy because i got dumped

**steelstepladder** (10): Suf King

**stryxen** (10): sufjan my beloved im so proud of however this did

**thedoctordances1940** (10): sufjan stop making me smile and cry at the same time challenge

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): So good it convinced us Call Me By Your Name was a good movie

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): Sufjan's voice is like a warm blanket

**welcome2thejam** (10): Here comes my boi Sufjan to fuck me up again!!!

**whatsanillinois** (10): y'all can't do this to me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.8): Oh SUFJAN. Glad to see you hear. Hope you're well. To think we'd end up here, when I heard you 300 years ago with the song "Jacksonville". When you were making "Illinois", did you think we'd meet on a TikTok rate, of all places? Anyway yea here's my score bye

**bluepupz** (9.5): I don't think I've ever heard a Sufjan Stevens song before this! This is really beautiful and atmospheric, and I love the strings and plucked guitar.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Timothee Chalamet, and even worse, Armie Hammer, will hunt you down if you don’t give this song a good score

**wavingwolves** (9.1): this movie fucking sucks

**1998tweety** (9): nice

**banmoderator** (9): if this was like any other sufjan song it would have gotten a 10 lmfao, i think cmbyn is kind of an uncomfortable movie and I think the whole "wes anderson-esque romanticism" is so tired but sufjan is sufjan and his music is still great

**cheatviathan** (9): This is my first time listening to anything from Sufjan, and what a strong first impression this made. The way the track builds, and more layers are introduced, is awesome to behold, and the softness of Sufjan’s voice fits this sort of contribution exceptionally well.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): vewy pwetty

**static\_int\_husp** (9): look people joke about Sufjan being gay all the time, but if he didn't want it to continue, he should have made this incredibly gay song for an incredibly gay movie

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRyonTvc/

**TiltControls** (9): this rate really just is indieheads exchange pt. 2

**Uberpigeon** (9): :woeis:

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): I love this song but I don’t want it to win this rate over certain other songs that feel like tiktok is more in their DNA, y’know??

**jsonphile** (8.5): this is a tiktok song??? Huh. Well it’s good

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8.5): Armie Hammer, please don't eat me

**GARjuna** (8): dug this

**nt96** (8): Reminds me of Simon & Garfunkel

**runaway3212** (8): Fuck this movie but this song is decent

**schwiftydude047** (8): haven’t seen the movie yet but it’s still a pretty solid song.

**throwaway7650** (8): I haven't seen CMBYN but this just sounds like it I'm sure

**xavieryes** (8): I'm not familiar with Sufjan's music but this is pretty good

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): one time I had a dream that sufjan was my boyfriend that I woke up in bed next to and let me tell u he was a gentle tender lover as u would expect

**celladonn** (7.5): Stream Boy Jr.'s hyperpop cover of this. Now that's a 10

**MrMoodle** (7.5): i don’t really listen to sufjan but he has crazy impressive forearms and reminds me of joe moravsky from american ninja warrior i’m a simp

**pig-serpent** (7): Good Acoustic stuff like Sufjan normally delivers, but at the same time maybe too much like what he normally delivers.

**vayyiqra** (7): I was going to make a joke like "wow I love Sufjan Stevens" then I looked and it was literally Sufjan Stevens so

liking Japanese city pop music makes you better than other people :noitstrue:

The absolute joy that I got from seeing the positive reception of this song come in... unmatched. I've been a fan of city pop for ages at this point (thanks Youtube recommendations!) and this song is easily one of the best. I ddi pitch a city pop rate a while back as well, but obviously didn't happen - this doing so well in the rate just gives me more reason to repitch it. I totally expected this to land in the bottom of day two and seeing it do so well (and almost even WIN - which it was for quite a long portion of the rate!) is just simply amazing, so I'm happy. :)

fun song but minus one point per time someone at a bar took this song as a cue to start grabbing my ass without asking 

I think "WAP" placing at the top should come to no surprise to anyone. The instant hit rap duet thanks to its instant controversy amongst the American public, it spawned various dances on the app, was used in hundreds of thousands of mashups, and became one of the most used songs on the app, slowly but surely as the mashups began to amass. The sub loves it, conservatives hate it, what more is there to say?

Unfortunately, I have some pretty bad memories with this song and the whole "get the D'Amelio's / (insert popular influencer who is a minor) to do the WAP!" trend on Tiktok still makes me incredibly uncomfortable so I couldn't give "WAP" a high score in full conscious for *this* rate, but I'll give it my 11 in the upcoming Winners Rate as compensation. :P

---

#from the top? make it drop

**astrologicalangel** (11): if this doesn't win I will be disappointed

**duochromepalmtree** (11): there was no competition for my 11. Not only an instant classic but a real cultural moment. This song completely transcends the app and the internet in general.

**flibbityflob** (11): Art. The truck horn, the little 'Uh,' the way Nicki talks around the VERY NORMAL word uvula, it literally NEVER fails to make me giggle like an idiot.

**hikkaru** (11): a predcitable winner but idgaf

**ignitethephoenix** (11): so glad this song brought back the massive cultural song release moment.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Fucking iconic. In every sense of the word.

**jasannn** (11): An obvious but deserved win. This song was all over my fyp when it came out.

**joeeswift** (11): a true cultural reset!

**jsonphile** (11): I mean what is there to say about this song that hasn’t already been said? It’s just a fantastic song. Every line, every joke, incredibly memorable. Like if you can hear the line “I want you to touch that little dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat” and you don’t get a huge smile on your face I’m sorry for you.

**JunkyGS** (11): Still holds up and this song was true cultural moment and reset. [**host note:** the song is just barely a year old how would it not hold up lmfao]

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Absolute certified banger, so many great lines, this song has to be the winner of a Tiktok rate

**lost-ln-the-echo** (11): it's a bop, it's hilarious, almost every line is quotable, cardi and megan are both great, the beat is perfect, literally what more could you want??? It's iconic!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): It's a song everyone loves, hates and loves to hate. Certified hoe anthem. Love the music video too.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Could I give my 11 to anything else? Iconic in all the right ways, it's got the trifecta of being dramatic, memeable and catchy. It's the perfect tiktok hit.

**skargardin** (11): We will be enjoying its inevitable, well-deserved win

**slimboyfriend** (11): There is the pre-WAP world and the post-WAP world and I'm blessed to have lived in both

**TiltControls** (11): can't wait for the WAP X WAP mashup for the reveal

**1998tweety** (10): i mean...legendaric

**2RINITY** (10): This was THE song of 2020, and I will not hear otherwise

**95ztaehyung** (10): this was the moment

**aestheticen** (10): Actually a cultural reset

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an eleven contender, and honestly a great song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is winning and it deserves to

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): h*rny anthem

**bbfan132** (10): revenge for the indieheads exchange rate

**best-american-record** (10): no comment needed

**celladonn** (10): Music really peaked with this

**cheatviathan** (10): I’m late to the discourse, so all I’ll say is that “I want you to touch that little dangly thang that swang in the back of my throat” is the best lyric of 2020, and only “Got a Vonnegut punch for your Atlas shrugs” comes even remotely close.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA7zkyKisC4

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): Me properly falling in love with this song during the last days of Christmas break… makes you think.

**GARjuna** (10): FROM THE TOP MAKE IT DROP

**hephaestionline** (10): This song came out on the same Friday that Doja Cat released Freak on streaming, and ngl I actually preferred that at first. Of course, both songs eventually went viral (Freak uses the same sample for the silhouette challenge remix of Streets).

**HogwartsReject1912** (10): I sing this to make my mom pissed its hilarious lol

**Hulnia** (10): Melon was so right to put this as the second best song of last year, a hilarious banger with some amazing verses. 

 A bit annoying that the video overshadowed the music for most, but it’s still great no matter what.

**intheaftermath** (10): my conservative sister hates this one! <3

**jman457** (10): This song will be a defying moment in pop culture for years to come . Also I literally have an essay why people who accuse Cardi B of robbing men are bootlicker capitalists who are upholding the patriarchy!!

**kreddit2** (10): cardi b and megan delivered

**MrMoodle** (10): no song in history has so many instantly quotable lines in succession

**nootnoot781** (10): bohemian wapsody is an 11 though

**plastichaxan** (10): this broke the internet it really is a cultural reset also it slaps

**ReallyCreative** (10): when they sing WE ARE A POT in the new Cinderella movie, do you think they are a pot with macaroni in it?

**rickikardashian** (10): i hope the hosts mashup the acapella from this with the WAP instrumental, that’d be hilarious

**Roxieloxie** (10): as a rate host who has made a remix to this i legally cant give it a bad score

**rslashpoopheads** (10): there's some whores in this house.

**runaway3212** (10): WAP WAP WAP

**seanderlust** (10): i'm not even gonna pretend like this isn't a ten, like i wasn't delighted when this was NPR's SOTY, when i found out we were rating this. some of the most iconic lines in the past decade at least, subtly overflowing with genius - "switch my wig make him feel like he's cheating" is legitimately hilarious. also, if you're pearl-clutching about how raunchy the lyrics are but you'll happily sing along to the bad touch by the bloodhound gang i'm gonna need you to unpack that for me.

**sssaaage** (10): already a classic

**static\_int\_husp** (10): R.I.P. to Ben Shapiros wife, died of dehydration

**teenwitches** (10): the honk after big mack truck always makes my brain happy

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I can't believe Cardi and Megan made an anti-italian song. It is so disgusting that discrimination against Italianx people is still permited in 2021

**tinaoe** (10): those videos of parents reacting to this song mayhaps made my 2020 so

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): really excellent, what else can I say?

**TragicKingdom1** (10): every so often there's one of these hip hop songs where every line just hits and this is the second best example

**Uberpigeon** (10): when straight men make horny songs it sucks but when women do it its different! 😎 from the top let it drop babyyy!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Has a collab between two huge artists ever lived up to and even exceeded the hype the way WAP has?

**waluigiest** (10): this was THE song of 2020

**xavieryes** (10): BRING A BUCKET AND A MOP

frogaranaman: **camerinian** (9.5): I did a cum

**shhhneak** (9.4): Ladies don’t ever compare your punani to Dasani. You’re VOSS at the very least.

**bluepupz** (9): Are you a certified freak? 7 days a week? I vividly remember the first time I listened to this, and I just started laughing once I heard all the lyrics. I love how over the top and quotable these lines are.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Y'all praise Cardi and Megan's bars but the real star here is the truck horn. I WANT YOU TO PARK THAT BIG MACK TRUCK RIGHT IN THIS LITTLE GARAGE HONK

**stryxen** (9): GRIMES??

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): id try to make my own funny attempt at making a joke about this song but nothing i could possibly come up with will ever be funnier than the dude in indieheads from the popheads exchange rate whose comment on this song was “weezer buddy holly voice : ooweeoo i have got a wet ass pussy”. i genuinely cannot listen to buddy holly or this song anymore without thinking about that comment and crying from laughter

**throwaway7650** (9): cardi's not bad but megan's verses are on another level. anyway STREAM WAP SHAKER https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3j41xzVNLs

**welcome2thejam** (9): Hey, this went up a point from when I rated it in the Popheads exchange! Congrats! Anyway, this song is just wall-to-wall "favorite moments in a song?" nominees

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): A cultural reset. What a time.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): I've always really liked this but I've never loved it as much as I feel I should

**2dina3dworld** (8): it’s a crime that indieheads rated this before we did

**inesmina** (8): BRING THE BUCKET AND THE MOP

**my friend Daniel (they/them)** (8): queer whore anthem, the reason I wish I got a BBL.

**nt96** (8): I made a mashup of this with City Escape from Sonic. Not my proudest moment...

**SFbby** (8): I can't stop saying "Macaroni in a pot" every time I make macaroni TT

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRf1sWXw/

**vayyiqra** (8): Yeah I hate Cardi and like Megan and I'm kind of tired of this song but will always respect it for how it made Ben Shapiro look like a sexist dumbass who doesn't know how a vagina works, which is what he is

**akanewasright** (7.7): I’ll be upset when this wins, but I can’t drop this score any more

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I lost screencaps of a Minecraft parody of this – there are several, would you believe it? – and it’s a great loss from my life…I do remember that it was called Wet Ass Potion and it had the line “you know I’m a freak witch, potions, weakness”

**Brendon-Urine** (7): I appreciate this song more for what it did to Ben Shapiro than the actual music

**schwiftydude047** (7): the energy of this song is weirdly addictive. AH😝

#does not want to do the WAP

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this is fine, but tbh even though I like it well enough it isn’t as groundbreaking as so much writing seems to make it out to be. Anyway its fine & i get why its so loved but it’s the boring winner here so i’m gonna be meaner

**arhmaer** (6): some of cardi's worst verses. megan carried

**banmoderator** (6): i like how multiple parts are used in tiktoks due to how iconic it is

**pig-serpent** (6): I love that this song exists and that it pissed off so many people, but it's just fine. I don't love the beat, Cardi's using her default flow, and Megan has better songs. I do have admit that I see myself making references to certified freaks, macaroni, a bucket and a mop, and the little dangly thing that hang in the back of my throat for years to come.

**ProfeNeuro** (6): This mashup version made by u/systemofstrings gets my eleven (...had it been in the running) --> https://whyp.it/t/1901-wap-70110

**whatsanillinois** (6): my dad was watching this music video the other day !

**qazz23** (4): Very underwhelming considering the discourse around it

TiltControls: Thanks frog for hosting an amazing rate!!! (even as someone who knows next to nothing about tiktok). I know it's been busy but you 100% killed the reveal

Now onto the usual [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates!

##**Songs**

Congrats to WAP for pulling out the win! Maybe not a surprising one, but it's such a good song. (Though Stay With Me was maybe my favourite discovery and would've been an excellent winner too!)

* **WAP**'s score gives it the 166th highest average across all songs

* **WAP** just barely misses the most 11s leaderboard with 17 11's (18 are needed to place). Though for the other board...

* **I'd Rather Die** takes the 8th place spot for most 0's with an amazing 23 0's! This ties it with It's Everyday Bro.

* **I'd Rather Die** also takes another leaderboard spot as the 14th lowest rated song of all time! This puts it only a few spots above Bad Blood (though we'll see if it can take its spot back) 

* **Be Happy** also came close to making the lowest list, but the score was a bit too high so it ends up around the 30th lowest rated song

* **Jesus is the One** becomes the bonus song winner with the 2nd lowest average (Eastside by benny blanco, Khalid, and Halsey still has the crown for lowest with 7.104 vs 7.216 for Jesus)

* There were 3 previously rated songs in the rate: **Sofia**, **Say So**, and **prom dress**. Compared to the last times they were rated all had lower scores, but higher placements

##**Artists**

Another grab bag with mostly new artists, so not much to discuss here. So just gonna do a quick speedthrough

* **Cardi:** moved up 10 spots for averages

* **Clairo:** moved up 15 spots for averages

* **Doja:** moved up 3 spots for averages

* **Megan:** moved up 9 spots and onto the leaderboard for averages (at #22)

* **Rico:** moved down 19 spots for averages

* **will.i.am:** no change for averages, though with a B&C songeniality win he now becomes the artist with the most songeniality wins after Halsey (2nd) and Taylor (1st). Also moves up 2 spots on the most controversial leaderboard

##**Rates**

* This rate ends up being getting the 2nd lowest average across all rates (though still a bit far from the 1st place Billboard 2012 rate)

 *  Also it knocked the original rate (Carly/Taylor/Ariana) off the lowest average leaderboard. Will we see it make a return next week???

* The rate gets close to the leaderboard for highest controversy rates snagging 14th place overall

* Tiktok gets 3rd for most zeroes used in the rate! (By percentage). 85.95% of participants used their 0 which only puts it behind the 2012 and 2010's Billboard rates.

* It is also in 9th for 0 spread. 53.97% of songs managed to pick up at least one!

* This isn't a record but something I was curious about: In terms of longest to reach 8 average this rate is 3rd with it not happening until the top 6 (this also happened in Emo Rate 2 and the Mid 2010s Synth Pop Rock Rate). Ahead of it are the One Direction solo rate (top 5) and Revival vs. Confident vs. Bangerz (where the top 2 were the only songs to get above an 8 average lmao). However this does take the record for longest holdout for a grab bag!

Great job again Frog and can't wait for the 5th Anniversary Rate reveal next week!
