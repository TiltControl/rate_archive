We will be relistening to the songs as they go out along with other handpicked bops by yours truly (some of which will be by other hyperpop artists I think deserve some recognition in addition to this rate!)

Some stats:

I did NOT expect this to be early day 2. I thought late day 2 or early day 1. It definitely isn't Slayyyter's best, or even top 5 on the album, but it's still such a fun song. Daddy AF is the superior horny anthem.

---

**Carinm** (11): horny anthem, literally perfect

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): that farty synth is so fun

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): So sweet when I get a little horny, yeah.

**kappyko** (10): I want this.

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): If I was a stripper, this would probably be one of my songs

**bbfan132** (9): this is super fun, not quite a 10 for me but it‚Äôs great

**twat\_brained** (9): this is a musical pheromone

**vayyiqra** (9): In which she continues to LARP as Britney but makes it hornier

**seanderlust** (8.4): i know my last comment was a britney spears reference, but I seriously want a remix with britney on it. although the chorus is maybe a bit explicitly raunchy for her brand

**1998tweety** (8): production on this is great, love a sleazy bop. the moans are a bit much though

**akanewasright** (8): This song took a hot minute to grow on me, but it‚Äôs fucking stellar

**skargardin** (8): take a bite take a bite

**Stryxen** (7.5): so does mine :)

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): can you eat me right is something I wonder frequently

**mayolizard** (7): doja cat outsold

**waluigiest** (7): she..... is really tryna be britney

**dragonsteel33** (6.8): it's good nothing that really pops though idk. the second verse gives blackout era britney for some reason

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this is like if Doja and Britney Spears were one person who did a hyper pop song

**maxrocks329** (6): Lana and her Pepsi Cola remain unbothered

**runaway3212** (6): I love The Fame X cupcakKe

**yatcho** (6): cute lyrically but it's very undercooked, shows that it was one of her first songs

**Palutzel** (5.7): the fame gaga on cocaine

**anothertown** (5): there is something very clunky and bad about this‚Ä¶ The ‚ÄúS-L-A‚Ä¶. Y‚Äù intro hits though

**pig-serpent** (3): I like that Hyperpop is bold enough to out obnoxious the most obnoxious pop songs of the last few decades, but sometimes they forget that they still have to write good songs. Once I get past how band the snyth line is I'm bored because it's too repetitive.

**rickikardashian** (2.5): this is also hyperbritney, but bad

A deserved placement. The superior gay medieval bop of the album.

---

**richbitchjuice** (11): ‚öîÔ∏è L11ve By The Sword ‚öîÔ∏è

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Can't wait for this to get fucking robbed.

**plastichaxan** (10): so short!! also underrated

**runaway3212** (10): I love this album so much omg

**skargardin** (10): the bass >>>

**anothertown** (9.5): I have the power of god and anime on my side!

**mayolizard** (9): AAAAHHH FINALLY I WAS WAITING FOR SOMETHING I WOULD LOVE LIKE THIS

**steelstepladder** (9): Forgive me master... but I have to go all out... just this once

**waluigiest** (9): the production on this song is GORGEOUS. It‚Äôs just a glorious experience to listen to it

**1998tweety** (8.5): okay this is GOOD

**Carinm** (8.5): goes hard

**sarcasticsobs** (8): some of my favorite production on the entire record

**twat\_brained** (7.7): just like Ava Max in the Kings & Queens mv, shoutout to u/ghost-quartet's comment

**bbfan132** (7): a bit underwhelming compared to the previous songs but still enjoyable

**ktajlili** (7): I don't find myself going back to this one, but I do like just simply for sword sound effect

**vayyiqra** (7): Dorian has studied the blade, and knows that the best blades are those that stay in their shealths :pensive:

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): this was like a 9 before that ugly bridge lmao

**dragonsteel33** (6): eh

**ignitethephoenix** (6): stan Captain Hook from Once Upon a Time [2] and also Captain Hook by Megan thee Stallion

**pig-serpent** (4): The like the heavier guitar that comes in during the intro but I don't feel like is amounts to a whole lot. It's trying to be a darker and more intense song but by this point on the album it sounds played out. Also metal on metal scraping is my least favorite sound and I can't listen to it.

**frogaranaman** (0): what DeviantArt sounds like if it was a song

This deserved to go out before Cha Ching and Celebrity. The chorus just feels kinda hollow to me, as catchy as it is. Still a major bop, she doesn't miss

---

**kappyko** (10): her vocals at the end are so good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the chorus gives me STRONG hollaback girl vibes

**anothertown** (9.5): Lesbian things

**1998tweety** (9): Hold awn I'm getting some Destiny's Child vibes or something

**awhile2** (9): never gonna get it tea with the vocal breakdown

**bbfan132** (9): holy fuck this is catchy

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9): relatable

**twat\_brained** (9): this sounds like a cheerleader routine song

**waluigiest** (9): this is just really good pop

**akanewasright** (8.5): I‚Äôm obsessed with this song. Especially the harmonies aaaaaah

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This feels like the most "Britney" of her songs

**banananaise** (8): this narrative sounds like a text convo that would go viral on twitter

**pig-serpent** (8): You know, the percussion of this song is doing a great job of carrying this song but letting the bassline take all the credit.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): not thrilled with the choruses but the verses go hard

**vayyiqra** (8): nor do I tbh

**seanderlust** (7.3): bernie sanders tweet voice slayyyter is right. but for real, not to be serious in the comments section of the hyperpop rate, but can we leave the idea of the homewrecker behind? like if your man is acting infidelous (a word?), then your real beef is with your man, not the other girl. it's his job to keep his dick in his pants; if he can't do it, that's on him.

**lightningcrying** (7): the verses and the chorus are really meh but the "i dont want your man" part is catchy af. i can see myself going back to this song just to hear that part

**runaway3212** (7): I hate it when titles are spelled like this

**mayolizard** (6): standard

**notceitn** (6): kinda forgettable tbh

**rickikardashian** (6): hyper-early 2000s r&b

**skargardin** (6): this has more potential than devil imo but it grows repetitive

**steelstepladder** (6): Is it weird I find this album blurring together as well? Like after I hit the standout tracks I'm like... eh

**Carinm** (3): She says Ur man so many times, it gets repetitive and annoying after a bit.

I am FUMING this deserved Day 3 omg omg this is such a smash. That bridge makes me either ascend or have a seizure every time. This is probably the most "hyperpop" sounding of the album, with that stuttering bridge. This would make a perfect drag race lip sync song.

---

**kappyko** (10): when she becomes a motorcycle omg

**waluigiest** (10): this song is truly a ride!! In several different ways. Pop off

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): FUCK ME CHEST TATTOO

**addupten** (9): banger, definitely best song on the album

**Carinm** (9): Love it

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.

**plastichaxan** (9): the last 30 secs or so hit so hard omg

**skargardin** (9): jam

**yatcho** (9): The adhd bridge yaaasssssss

**Palutzel** (8.3): is this song about sex?

**letsallpoo** (8): is this the bohemium rhapsody of hyperpop

**vayyiqra** (8): This isn't the best song on this album but it gets stuck in my head a lot

**dragonsteel33** (7.9): same thoughts on it as daddy AF. i like the verses a LOT more than the chorus but the minor key makes me go a little nuts ngl

**pat-rickstar** (7.8): Is she ever not horny??

**runaway3212** (7.5): The chorus is really good and the rest of the song is good enough

**seanderlust** (7.3): rub that grease around - glitter and grease - gaga collab confirmed!!!

**akanewasright** (7): This song is pure trash, and I love it.

**bbfan132** (7): love the production but parts of this didn‚Äôt fully click for me

**lightningcrying** (7): fun but doesn't really stand out that much. i think putting it after Daddy AF on the tracklist took away a bit of the excitement for this one

**1998tweety** (6): meh and filler

**mayolizard** (6): girl ok

**pig-serpent** (6): I like a lot of what this song is doing in theory, like the more washed out vocals and synths for the chorus, and the nastiness that runs though everything else, but it's not really coming together for me.

**rickikardashian** (6): hyperer charli xcx

**steelstepladder** (5): Vroom Vroom this is not

SLayyyter inspired Doja Cat's Cyber Sex, something you don't see in the history books. This also marks That Kid's rate debut (stream Crush everyone!!). He definitely helped propel this song to the place it got.

---

**Stryxen** (11): this is so me!!!!!!!! i wanna be someone‚Äôs e-boy so bad

**Carinm** (10): Amazing showstopping incredible

**kappyko** (10): predicting many comments shitting on the feature despite the fact that That Kid might be the most talented person in this entire rate

**pig-serpent** (10): A pop song that's basically perfect but you can't show anyone because it is way too horny for mortal consumption.

**RandomDKguy** (10): E-BOP!

**vayyiqra** (9): :flushed:

**twat\_brained** (8.7): stream crush <3

**seanderlust** (8.6): email my heart found dead. but for real, can someone who's better at music theory than me tell me why the synths behind the first verse sound so interesting? they sound unresolved and not typical of pop music

**dragonsteel33** (8): good feature i love that kid

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): THAT KID CARRIES THIS.

**passionfruits2** (8): only giving this a high score bc u respect That Kid too much

**yatcho** (8): Everything that's not "do you wanna be my e-boy?" repeated like 6 times is so good

**didney-worl** (7.5): stan That Kid

**mayolizard** (7): fuck them tik tok boys anyways I love spencer <3 kinda saved the song imo

**runaway3212** (7): Stream cyber sex by doja cat

**anothertown** (6.5): if I never heard any derivative of the word ‚Äúsexin‚Äô‚Äù in a song ever again, it would be a good life!

**bbfan132** (6.5): not a big fan of this although it‚Äôs still pretty cute - that kid‚Äôs part sounds off to me and the song in general feels lackluster

**1998tweety** (6): this is trying more than a little too hard. lyrics are way too repetitive

**skargardin** (6): never really cared for this like that

**akanewasright** (5): Idk I still like it but it‚Äôs kinda weak compared to other stuff

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): whew this is almost as bad as most of flamboyant

This is such a shocking and introspective commentary on machines and robots, and the possible downfall of humanity they could bring. Elon Musk needs to watch out

---

**akanewasright** (10): The fact that she gets cut off in the middle of the closing track kind of sends me

**mayolizard** (10): funny queen

**TiltControls** (10): the rise and fall of Emily Montes' Roblox career (2020)

**waluigiest** (10): ROBOTICY // STATIC-Y

**1998tweety** (8): :( my heart aches for her

**pat-rickstar** (8): queen of inventing new words

**RandomHypnotica** (8): Technology is a very fickle thing, and in this track, we can see the effect this has on her life, as technical issues are preventing her from doing the one activity she's actually able to perform in this harsh condition, her one last bastion of safety. A warning to society's overreliance on technology

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this deep

**seanderlust** (7): this is what the 1975 was trying to do with "a brief inquiry..."

**banananaise** (6): someone write a medium article about what this song says about technology

**TragicKingdom1** (6): better than kim petras - icy

**vayyiqra** (6): Is this Kim Petras singing (jk I like her)

**skargardin** (5): yelling

The way that this song is about getting your dick cut off...they really ended gender with this one. The production on the chorus goes OFF and I love their voice in this

---

**didney-worl** (10): my sadness that we never got a music video is immeasurable

**maxrocks329** (10): This is the future liberals want

**runaway3212** (10): Perfection

**seanderlust** (10): wow, with this album dorian really said fuck the entire concept of gender, and they were absolutely right.

**lightningcrying** (9.5): love the production, love the lyrics, absolute banger

**anothertown** (9): I go up for these Cher vocals

**Carinm** (9): Love it

**dragonsteel33** (9): really good instrumental + lyrics all around great hehe

**steelstepladder** (8): Slightly weaker than most of the core album tracks but still great

**twat\_brained** (8): Dorian Electra? Dorian Electra. RT if you agree

**waluigiest** (8): this is what years&years were trying to be with Palo Santo, no I won‚Äôt unpack that

**1998tweety** (7): the first half of this BOPS but then something weird happens near the end and it tanks

**addupten** (7): This one grew on me!

**bbfan132** (7): the second half went hard, the first half was fine but i wanted a bit more

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Great, but a tad bit too hyper for me. Love the whip on this.

**mayolizard** (7): Aaaaaaahhhhhhh

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): that drop deserves a better song

**pig-serpent** (6): The fax machine sounding section is pretty neat but most of this song is whatever.

**vayyiqra** (6): Well this is an okay song given it's about having your dick chopped off, but that breakdown which sounds like a dialup modem isn't great

**ignitethephoenix** (1): what‚Äôs with their voice here...there‚Äôs way too much going on. If they just stuck with one vocal effect it would be better

This one has always been just okay to me when compared to the rest of the album. Definitely one of the "mid" tracks

---

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Phenomenal intro track tbh. The energy is THROUGH THE ROOF in this one.

**runaway3212** (10): I feel weird calling this iconic since it doesn't have more than 5 million streams, but it really is iconic

**steelstepladder** (10): Yes sir ;)

**waluigiest** (10): The arc of this song makes it a stunning opener for me. It‚Äôs got this quiet subtle vocal delivery that builds and explodes into the sax at the bridge and it‚Äôs glorious

**1998tweety** (9.5): this bops

**Carinm** (9): the track sounds lovely, a little bit repetitive, but its short and sweet so not much to complain about.

**yatcho** (9): The most straightforward bop of the album and i really appreciate it

**Palutzel** (8.2): cute bop

**bbfan132** (8): this bops!!! loved the production

**twat\_brained** (8): but you use gender neutral pronouns i am confusion Dor

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it has early 2000‚Äôs vibes but drenched with hyperpop

**lightningcrying** (7): really good first track! an introduction to dorian not only literally but also to their sound. really gets you hyped for the the rest of the album

**pig-serpent** (7): This is a good song but it's not really popping for me.

**skargardin** (7): a bit short but it does bop

**vayyiqra** (7): Good intro though it's not long enough to develop on much

**dragonsteel33** (6.8): honestly the opening tag might be my favorite part of the album

**seanderlust** (6.8): i LOVE the lyrical reversal. that said, dorian has said that it is more of an introduction to the album, and I think that's fair. I don't see myself seeking this song out outside of the full album's context.

**addupten** (5.8): started off alright but got awfully repetitive

**mayolizard** (5): ok

I know musically Make Believe fits better as a closing track but it makes me so mad that a song titled "The Ending" isn't the final track on an album....serving Gritty Pretty Intro being the fourth song on the Sunshine Kitty Pawprints Edition

---

**LesApfels** (11): I've been obsessed with this song since the Soon You Won't See Me At All EP and it never gets old

**addupten** (10): a definite standout of the album

**bbfan132** (10): it‚Äôs called the ending but it‚Äôs in the middle of the album‚Ä¶. huh

**RandomHypnotica** (10): a surprising bubbly little track that feels like it was MUCH needed, this one really grew on me!

**banananaise** (9): i just realised how weird it is that this isn't the last song on the tracklist

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): well its ~over~~ just beginning

**waluigiest** (8): This is really groovy

**dragonsteel33** (7.8): feels like something off pop 2 and im living for it

**twat\_brained** (7.8): i'm losing my mind and these songs are starting to run on

**Palutzel** (7.6): cute bop

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): It might be quite annoying but the "going or going or gone" is one of the most memorable hooks on this album

**Stryxen** (7.5): :‚Äô)

**astrologicalangel** (7): I am conflicted on this one

**vayyiqra** (7): :pensive:

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**akanewasright** (6.5): This works well as a conclusion to Soon I Won‚Äôt See You At All, but as a song... it‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs perfectly catchy, but it‚Äôs not on the level of the other tracks.

**runaway3212** (6.5): I really don't get why this isn't the final track

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): It's past 1 am and I'm trying to do this rate ASAP to never touch most of these songs again. You'd think this would be the closer but there are 3 more tracks after this, help.

**kappyko** (6): i did not expect a dancehall song on this album. if i knew there was one i would've probably expected it to be just fine though

**pig-serpent** (6): A perfectly acceptable take on tropical house.

**skargardin** (5): i like parts of the production as a whole its a mess

**yatcho** (5): something about the vocal effects with the various rhythmic choices don't really mesh at all

**Carinm** (4): very bland

**steelstepladder** (4): shrug emoji

At just 5 years old, Emily Montes has more human decency and is more educated on race in America than the current president of the United States...let that sink in

**1998tweety** (10): political queen, we stan

**bbfan132** (10): no words

**frogaranaman** (10): woke queen

**mayolizard** (10): woke queen

**Palutzel** (10): she did more for minorities than the president of the USA

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Emily has never been afraid to address political issues, and this track dedicated to George Floyd and the BLM movement is proof of that. She is not afraid to mourn his loss, and fight for a new future. She really is one of this generations most prolific and powerful personalities

**seanderlust** (10): YOU BETTER SPEAK ON IT MISS EMILY

**static\_int\_husp** (10): queen of activism

**TiltControls** (10): this is such a weird assortment of 3 tracks

I go absolutely insane every time this song comes on, a total banger. I love the Kiss Me Thru the Phone sample on this so much

---

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This goes the fuck off oh my god do i actually like 100 gecs what the fuck help

**Palutzel** (10): absolutely phenomenal

**pig-serpent** (10): This song has the gnastiest drop I've ever heard in my life in it. If you know any drops that are gnastier, please let me know, I want to hear it.

**plastichaxan** (10): best, 11 contender for me yup yup

**runaway3212** (10): It's really strange how the chorus could actually be used for a katy perry song.

**bigbigbee** (9): kiss me through the phone by soulja boy. I am right

**Carinm** (9): very cute, love everything about it.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): "everyday you got me always feeling like [beat breaks down]" what a mood

**akanewasright** (8): The remix of this song is perfectly executed in my eyes, but like... this one is still damn good. I especially like Laura‚Äôs glitched out vocals toward the end, that was a neat idea that SS taken out of the remix.

**bbfan132** (8): top-tier production here

**kappyko** (8): YASS SWEET POTATO FRIES YASSSS (that kid did kiss you through the phone better)

**pat-rickstar** (8): Don't like the drop but the verse after the first one is great. The Tommy Cash/Hannah Diamond remix is a 10 however

**RandomDKguy** (8): gec

**notceitn** (7.5): it slaps but the remix ate it up

**twat\_brained** (7.1): laura stop you sound like a- wait no you sound like a whiny kid on every song why do I like this music again

**mayolizard** (7): remix outsold :soobcry:

**yatcho** (6.8): when they went full euro-dance with this on the remix album is when it finally made sense

**1998tweety** (6.5): this would probably be a 9 if it weren't for that AWFUL glitching part. seriously i actually really like the rest of the song but that one bit just kills it.

**lightningcrying** (6.5): cute chorus! i really like the kiss me thru the phone sample (interpolation?) but, as much i usually like this type of production, it felt kinda samey here compared to the rest of the album

**banananaise** (6): me: mom can we have xXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx (remix) [feat. Tommy Cash and Hannah Diamond]? mom: we have xXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx (remix) [feat. Tommy Cash and Hannah Diamond] at home. xXXi_wud_nvrstop_UXXx (remix) [feat. Tommy Cash and Hannah Diamond] at home:

**seanderlust** (5.9): the sonic equivalent of a basic meme with a picture of soulja boy with Impact font text over it, deep fried to the point of being almost unreadable, with the original text scribbled out and replaced with "GIVE ME YOUR LIVER/BOTTOM TEXT". is that a good thing? who knows? who cares? death is coming. 5.9/10.

**InfernalSolstice** (5): the parts with vocals are great but the instrumental parts are horrid

**ignitethephoenix** (4): is this the sound of my earbuds dying?

**rickikardashian** (4): i will listen to kiss me thru the phone instead

**TiltControls** (3): this time it was the drop that was bad instead of the ending! we love progress!! also i should take off points for the stupid name, but at this point I'm willing to overlook superficial details

**vayyiqra** (3): One of the least bad songs on this I guess; I almost even like it

**skargardin** (2): such a good buildup until the drop, literally makes it unlistenable for me.

**mysario** (0): 100 gecs is shitposting in music form so sometimes it hits and sometimes it doesn't

**twat\_brained** (9): this is my new mood for 7:45 AM

**Palutzel** (8.6): dubstep isn't dead

**kappyko** (8): YASS SWEET POTATO FRIES YASSSS

**waluigiest** (8): the shift to the glittery beat towards the end fills me with so much joy

**akanewasright** (7.5): I am conscious of the fact that I‚Äôm doing this song a little bit dirty, and I think a 7 is a pretty good score anyway. But this song goes the fuck off. It‚Äôs not as strong as the other highlights, but the lyrics are iconic, and the ending is wonderful

**dragonsteel33** (7.5): laura les and dylan brady could write das kapital but marx couldn't write 745 sticky

**lightningcrying** (7.5): that outro...... chefs kiss

**tearsinvegas** (7.4): wow I relate to shit I‚Äôm already broke and it‚Äôs only 745 in the morning on a deeply spiritual level

**seanderlust** (7.2): ""fuck sleep and his cousin" asagad;klfj why are these lyrics so funny. this is fun!" - my comment before the outro. dude what the fuck

**bbfan132** (7): liked the production a lot even though this was kind of all over the place haha

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I like the trap beat mixed in here also lyrics are a mood lol but holy the ending I have to drop some points there

**Carinm** (6): Hate the last half, feels like its just random noise

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): NGL it only got good near the end, but those screams were kinda too much.

**pat-rickstar** (6): I'm conflicted about this song, it slaps but I'm uncomfortable

**rickikardashian** (6): i didnt like dubstep when it was popular

**1998tweety** (4): this isn't bad for a gec song until you get to the earr*pe at the end which just tanks the song

**banananaise** (4): making the drop ironic/a meme does not make it actually enjoyable

**skargardin** (3): im so over this album already

**TiltControls** (2): the end was like someone trying out their new soundboard over the noise of 50 dying furbies

**vayyiqra** (1): This album beginning with screeching sounds that get on my nerves was not a good omen in hindsight and oh god I hate that breakdown

This was my second choice of an 11 and I cannot believe it placed this low. I was raised as a conservative Catholic and really grew up with a toxic, skewed idea of homosexuality until I began to discover my own identity. This song flips the rhetoric I would hear every day of my childhood around on its head and it just means so much to me lyrically. "God made me gay" and "Say I'm an abomination, but I'm God's creation" are two of my favorite lyrics ever I'm not even kidding. Not to mention musically, this song also pops off. Definitely going to be my pick for Miss Songeniality

---

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): I'M SUCH A FAAAAAAAAAAG.

**lightningcrying** (11): this song is absolutely perfect. the singing, the production, the religious theme... that fucking bridge... i cant imagine any other song winning this rate, honestly

**addupten** (10): fantastic, best song on the album

**akanewasright** (10): Stellar PC-esque track

**banananaise** (10): dorian said god made me gay so write that down

**Carinm** (10): Literally perfect, absolutely 0 complaints, I love how unedited their voice is in some parts of this, makes it so much more raw.

**plastichaxan** (10): best song on this album but not by far, it's so good

**steelstepladder** (10): Almost got my 11. The power this holds...

**Stryxen** (10): me when god made MEEEEE

**bigbigbee** (9.5): That bridge is fucking SICK!

**seanderlust** (9.1): jfc this sounds so cool

**awhile2** (9): perhaps the most on-brand Dorian song

**mayolizard** (9): period god

**Palutzel** (8.5): queer icon, no one else could

**bbfan132** (8): ‚Äúsay i‚Äôm an abomination, but i‚Äôm god's creation‚Äù is the best line in the rate - they absolutely spilled here

**yatcho** (8): i had to watch the video to really get this song, because it's really inaccessible at first. The song has probably my least favorite Dorian vocal production and that's saying something, but I like the message and the production is really fucking good again.

**dragonsteel33** (7.6): ok i should not laugh but this makes me think of this movie that i watched obsessively as a baby gay

**twat\_brained** (7.6): fuck the bible. LITERALLY

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): The fact this is my first score below 8 for this album, 10 songs in‚Ä¶.

**1998tweety** (7): this is alright

**notceitn** (7): I overplayed this way too much )))':

**runaway3212** (7): I can't believe people use adam and steve as an actual argument. I also can't believe people have the patience to debate with people who say that. I would literally laugh so hard.

**waluigiest** (7): I love the bridge and how it‚Äôs almost choral-esque, but this song is pretty blah to me.

**pig-serpent** (6): This song is a good example of this album's synth work and production being more homogenius than Dorian's performance and lyrical themes are demanding. There's an operatic bridge on this song that would've had a big impact if it went for a more orchestral backing but instead it fails to stand apart from the rest of the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): speak your truth

**vayyiqra** (5): I remember in the 2000s when homophobes said this unironically (maybe they still do) :elmo:

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): i know vocals arent a huge focus of hyperpop but this was like... just beyond annoying and i cant pretend to like this in the slightest

Emily saw Lizzo in her inspirational bag and decided to do it even better. Whenever I am feeling self conscious or having an episode of body dysmorphia, I will put this song on and instantly be healed by Emily's wise words.

**astrologicalangel** (10): this made me feel better today honestly

**bbfan132** (10): motivational queen

**mayolizard** (10): PICK UP THAT CROWN QUEEN

**RandomDKguy** (10): inspirational than fuck

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Motivational anthems have always been a bit hard to pull off successfully, but here Emily really manages to impart some incredibly powerful words of wisdom. When I first listened to this song, I honestly broke down crying. I went to a mirror, paused, looked deep into my own eyes and quoted Ms. Montes. "Don't forget, you are a queen". For the first time in my life, I felt like I was truly beautiful. And she helped me realise that people DO care about me. If i could give this an 11, I would.

**Stryxen** (10): thanks emily :‚Äô)

**TiltControls** (10): Inspirational anthem!

This is probably the most pop friendly / conventional song in the rate, but Slayyyter pulls it off so well. She really has perfected making catchy, infectious pop songs.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): mariah has been awful quiet since this dropped

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this definitely is a bop

**pat-rickstar** (10): I think this might be my favourite song on this mixtape, the bridge and final chorus slap hard

**seanderlust** (10): ENDORPHINS

**skargardin** (10): banger!!!!

**twat\_brained** (10): Mariah is skinny but this is a thread of yarn by comparison

**1998tweety** (9): this is excellent, this doesn't sound like the kind of song slayyyter should be able to pull off but somehow she does huh

**bbfan132** (9): i can taste the sugar and it‚Äôs delightful

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Carly Rae Jepsen could do "Touch My Body" but Slayyyter couldn't do "Emotion"

**vayyiqra** (9): I like when girl sing the fun bleepbloop song [2]

**pig-serpent** (8): One of the more conventional songs here, but it's still good.

**runaway3212** (8): Stan skinny legend Mariah Carey

**yatcho** (7.5): Mariah's wig shifted slightly

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Quickly got a tad bit repetitive.

**kappyko** (7): this is just fine if this wins i hate you all

**mayolizard** (7): hm

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs fun but the lyrics are not good or fresh

**Carinm** (6): Don't like how her voice sounds in this.

**steelstepladder** (6): Do I dislike it? No. Do I see myself ever returning to it? Also no.

**lightningcrying** (5): kinda boring ngl the repetition on the chorus doesn't do anything for me

**notceitn** (4.5): really overhyped tbh

**anothertown** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY5t7J4NCIo

**LesApfels** (10): Pop perfection. I just wanna blast this during a pool party

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I don't know how to describe it, but the context of this track in the album feels weirdly remniscent of Pin on Art Angels (which is also a 10)

**1998tweety** (9.5): ok wow this is excellent

**bbfan132** (9): how have i not heard this until now???? it feels a tad bit messy but it‚Äôs mostly perfect - that chorus is irresistable

**hunnybee12** (9): her voice in the chorus is kinda grating but I like it anyways

**skargardin** (9): mega boppy

**vayyiqra** (9): I like when girl sing the fun bleepbloop song

**waluigiest** (4): this is feel good pop but it‚Äôs so sickly sweet and uninspired that I can‚Äôt handle it, especially within the context of this album

**RandomHypnotica** (9): Eating Disorders are a complex matter, but emily addresses the overall feeling that Hunger enables. There's so many choices on what to eat, it's hard to decide! But at the same time, you also want to complete activities and enjoy the daylight whilst you can, and having to eat takes away from that precious fading time! Emily shows that it's truly a hopeless cycle of hunger and anticipation to live life and have fun, the eternal cycle.

**seanderlust** (8.9): me at all times every day: snaack tiiiiime. i'm hungry! i'm hungry! i'm hungry!

This is the most Britney song Slayyyter has made. I love how it's literally a Britney song from like 2004 but make it hyperpop. She really needs to do more like this, no wonder the gays eat her up.

**yatcho** (10): This is literally Britney cosplay but like, I WISH Britney was making songs this good right now

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): this one just drips w attitude ugh love that

**anothertown** (9): A good 2001-2003 Britney Spears pastiche

**pig-serpent** (9): She nails the vibe on this one so hard the nail is never coming back out.

**awhile2** (8): basically ‚ÄúHella Good‚Äù by no doubt so fwi

**bbfan132** (8): chorus is loud as hell lmao, still enjoyed it! this could‚Äôve been on britney‚Äôs self-titled

**lightningcrying** (8): a bopppp, great chorus and i love how the bridge sounds

**vayyiqra** (8): That synth is FILTHY this is a good throwback to 2000s electroclash

**waluigiest** (8): ‚Äúthey call me toxic‚Äù it‚Äôs so overt at this point it‚Äôs almost parody

**1998tweety** (7): shes a cute filler bop

This is such a banger I can't believe it didn't make day 3. This song is instant seratonin. The musical equivalent of getting rawdogged in the back of a club at 1 am

---

**frogaranaman** (11): shoutout to Tiktok for making this audio thirst traps for men above 30

**bbfan132** (10): perfect :avatwerk:

**hikkaru** (10): horny bop!!!

**kappyko** (10): I'VE BEEN FUCKING MODELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**mayolizard** (10): PERIOD!!!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): this is my anthem what does that say abt me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The unbeatable slut bop. Nothing makes me feel more fuckable than this

**seanderlust** (10): NOT THE ACTUAL SAMPLE OF A PORNO I

**skargardin** (10): an anthem

**twat\_brained** (10): this gets me turnt like nothing else

**vayyiqra** (10): Why is this such a banger? Idk but now I want to pop bottles in the grotto too, whatever the fuck that means

**akanewasright** (9): I BEEN FUCKIN MOOODEEEEEELS

**bigbigbee** (9): I really hate moaning sound effects but this song is so catchy, god damn

**Carinm** (9): Dom Anthem

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): im h-word too!

**dragonsteel33** (9): makes me get railed over a table i listen to it when i'm on the freeway and going like 75

**maxrocks329** (9): I played this for my cousin (who's an Ed Sheeran stan) and she made me turn it off because it gave her a headache

**Palutzel** (9): i want to be daddy af when i grow up

**pig-serpent** (9): This is the worst song on the album. This is the best song on the album.

**RandomDKguy** (9): queen of daddy songs (dorian is king)

**rickikardashian** (9): i genuinely cant tell if i actually love this, but seeing that one moan being sampled was all i needed to give this a good score

**waluigiest** (9): she ate this up wtf

**addupten** (8.5): this slaps, perfect for the whole family

**banananaise** (8): love listening to this while playing professor layton games

**1998tweety** (7): I'm sorry but I do NOT get the love for this track. It's ok but wow it's easily on the weaker end of the album but y'all praise it as if it's the best. I feel like it's another Mitski - Nobody situation where y'all stan just cause of the ‚ú®relatable‚ú® lyrics.

**sarcasticsobs** (7): its funny and fun but not mind blowing

**yatcho** (7): Really rides the line between banger and cringey a little too much

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): the lyrics and theme of this are iconic, but it‚Äôs one of the weakest songs on the album imo

**astrologicalangel** (5): not my fav. but we love a self empowerment anthem

**pat-rickstar** (5): I feel like I want to like this more than I actually do. The chorus doesn‚Äôt flow that well, but the lyrics are hilarious

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): I don't think I'll ever like this, considering the number of second chances I've given out. No.

**runaway3212** (4): This is just a worse 'I Got It'

**anothertown** (1): This is embarrassing
