A perfect closer to the album (despite The Ending being better name-wise sob). The production is so ethereal and the drop is so satisfying

---

**bbfan132** (10): such a euphoric closer

**pig-serpent** (10): Hannah's at her most fleshed out here, with her best verse melody, a strong hook, and a drop that properly climaxes unlike a lot of her other songs.

**TiltControls** (10): very close to that 11. It's a great closer and I especially love the production

**bigbigbee** (9.5): This song has the strongest vocaloid influence to me of any in the rate. It makes me feel like I’m floating in a technicolor night sky with konpeito candy shooting stars falling down around me. I love it.

**1998tweety** (9): this bops

**akanewasright** (9): The perfect closer to the album in my mind. It’s a great, bombastic song, and it perfectly encapsulates the melancholy of the album

**vayyiqra** (9): This album is like eating sugar right out of the bowl and I don't even like sugar but I love this album so figure that out centrists

**banananaise** (8.5): honestly every single song on this album is incredibly singalongable, it's such a cathartic experience

**dragonsteel33** (8.3): really really really good song and a good closer

**runaway3212** (8): I love the buildup.

**skargardin** (8): a great closer, makes up for some of the tracks falling short in the middle

**Stryxen** (8): how does she say baby so quickly but so slowly

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): definitely my favourite from the album but that ending with the squeaky vocals.....why???

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): KKB did it better, sorry

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I'm just rounding out the average with this score.

**steelstepladder** (6): KKB outsold. That guitar at the end is neat though.

**Carinm** (5): Cute but boring

These lyrics HIT omg this is literally dancing on my own but hyperpop as someone pointed out. This is one of my favorites on the album for sure

---

**banananaise** (11): impossible not to sing along while waving your 2009 ipod touch lighter app in the air

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the buildup hello???????!!!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): sad hyperpop hours

**sarcasticsobs** (10): ethereal

**vayyiqra** (10): A mood as I do this alone at 5 in the morning :pensive:

**akanewasright** (9): I love this song so much. You don’t hear many hyperpop song in 6/8, and it doesn’t sound like a gimmick in this song or anything. It’s lovely and deeply memorable.

**LesApfels** (9): Someone here once called Hannah "everyone's favourite sadgirl vocaloid ghost that haunts a music box" and I think about that a lot while listening to this

**seanderlust** (9): this is dancing on my own's sad cousin, and yes that is a compliment

**twat\_brained** (9): so sad yet so upbeat I'm starting to get it

**yatcho** (9): Kind of dancing on my own performed by a depressed android in 2099 vibes

**pat-rickstar** (8.8): I may have inflated my score just a little because I feel a little bad for Hannah knowing she's going to be slaughtered in this rate

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is kind of pretty tbh

**bbfan132** (8.5): kind of lowkey but i enjoyed the production choices and lyrics

**didney-worl** (8.5): Greensleeves whomst

**runaway3212** (8.5): Stream Invisible by Taylor Swift

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Boppy.

**pig-serpent** (8): This song takes the dreamy qualities of Hannah's music and has the song peak in an emotional chorus. The strong sense of direction this song has is noticed among the rest of the album.

**bigbigbee** (7): reminds me strongly of 1) Greensleeves and 2) My Country Tis of Thee which interferes with my enjoyment

**Palutzel** (7): reflections pt 2

**rickikardashian** (7): this uses the same sparkly synth than the other song

**skargardin** (7): relatable

**steelstepladder** (7): This isn't bad but it's kinda forgettable

**waluigiest** (7): I like the writing and some of the melodies are nice, but it doesn’t dig in that much

**Stryxen** (6.5): what does she mean she was born on her own but also v relatable

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): why is Hannah saying everything so…. disjointed? It's like every sylabble needs emphasis, and it just feels so stilted and awkward. She sounds like a vocaloid with bad tuning

**mayolizard** (6): head empty

**lightningcrying** (5.5): her singing is giving me musical theater vibes and i dont think i like it

**kappyko** (4): i know its supposed to be juxtaposed with the depressive lonely lyrics but the way the synth melody follows each se pa rate syllable of the chorus is just aggravating

**anothertown** (3): iont know about this

I was surprised this beat songs like 745 sticky and wudneverstop, but its still a banger. The Dorian Electra remix existing makes this a lot worse because of how amazing the remix is

---

**tearsinvegas** (11): woooOOOOOOOOOoooOOooooo sentimental value

**addupten** (10): almost give this my 11

**astrologicalangel** (10): I am so glad this was the song that got to be over 3 minutes

**hunnybee12** (10): how can a line about dirty dishes be so cute

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this feels like a sugar high even more than the Dorian remix somehow

**steelstepladder** (10): YOU SAY I NEED LOVE CAN YOU GET TO ME NOW

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): of all the albums this is the one song that actually feels like a closing track and i love that

**bbfan132** (9): that outro makes the song, love the glitchiness at the end

**pig-serpent** (9): Dorian Elgectra's remix outsold. Only like 100 copies or so, but still it outsold. Also this version has the best rendition of the speed up at the end.

**TiltControls** (9): the end screeching might have been a bit much, but solid otherwise

**twat\_brained** (9): the intro had me thinking this was Reflections first, now the outro feels like Cascada run through a deep fried nightcore? Now it's just earrape. These ruffnut and tuggnut cosplayers are ridiculous and I love them

**yatcho** (8.5): the ending is what psychosis sounds like

**Stryxen** (8): i put this song on to help me wake up

**waluigiest** (8): the outro really captures the album huh

**Palutzel** (7.7): this is definitely elevated by the remix, weaker song of the album but still great

**InfernalSolstice** (7.5): this would've been a 9 without the outro

**runaway3212** (7.5): This song is really worse when it doesn't have 'DORIAN E-"GEC"-TRA' in it.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is one of the best songs until the ending, which is one of the worse things I’ve heard on the album

**kappyko** (7): its ok

**seanderlust** (6.9): a solid D&B end to the album. i'll take it. though god, I hate the outro

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is decent, an alright closer

**rickikardashian** (6.5): i could sense the loud outro coming

**Carinm** (6): pretty boring compared to the rest of the album imo, the very slow beginning just doesn't work with me, the sudden change to the loud noises just feels annoying, this would be much better if it were not the last track on the album imo.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): Dorian's remix ate. This did not.

**mayolizard** (6): boring unfortunately

**skargardin** (3): I feel nothing

**vayyiqra** (2): I like the breakbeat intro to this. If the whole album had been more like this, I might've liked it but then the awful screechy ending ruins it. Oh well :pensive:

**frogaranaman** (10): this album is perfection

**mayolizard** (10): if I could give this an 11 i would. Nicki you have 12 hours to respond

**static\_int\_husp** (10): queen of ending Nicki and Chance

**Stryxen** (10): hip pop

**TiltControls** (10): Some say? Should be ALL say

**TragicKingdom1** (10): END THEM!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): spill she is definitely better

**plastichaxan** (8): nicki you have one hour to respond

**RandomDKguy** (8): rap game

**skargardin** (8): im crying what IS this

**waluigiest** (8): Emily Montes vs. Chance the Rapper

**RandomHypnotica** (7): Finally we're introduced to Emily's alter ego, "Emily rose", we learn that Rose is incredibly talented, being able to spit fire after only a single hour!!! She reminds us of the controversial selection when pitchfork declare her as the best rapper, over Nicki Minaj and Chance the Rapper. She also gives us some insight into the struggles she faced growing up, such as a lack of education. Truly an inspirational queen

**seanderlust** (7): five years old and having the barbz after her. icon

**vayyiqra** (7): "better than Nicki" Yes

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6): you got promise kid, but don't come for the queen till you can do monster

**lightningcrying** (4): she better respect the people who paved the way smh

**tearsinvegas** (1.3): I’m ready for the nicky feud

This song is so gorgeous, it feels like I'm floating on a sparkly cloud. For some reason this song makes me think of Vanellope from Wreck-It Ralph I have literally zero clue why

---

**akanewasright** (10): One of the best songs on the album easily. The bridge sets it over the edge to “brilliant”.

**bbfan132** (10): loved the buildup/repetition towards the end

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): my love for this song goes on

**kappyko** (10): really love this one

**plastichaxan** (10): the buildup is something else

**Seedub192** (10): palmistry remix w bladee is an 11

**skargardin** (10): literally the catchiest melody i've ever heard

**TiltControls** (10): is it repetitive? yes. do i still love it anyways though? also yes

**vayyiqra** (10): This is so beautiful I love this :uwu:

**seanderlust** (9.6): that bridge is lyrically gorgeous

**1998tweety** (9.5): this album does a good job giving off a sparkly vibe

**LesApfels** (9.5): She straight up turned into a vocaloid halfway through. We HAVE to stan

**steelstepladder** (9): I really like this one! Almost gives me KKB vibes

**bigbigbee** (8.5): The lyrics for this suck SO much, but I think the melody is gorgeous

**twat\_brained** (8.5): literal glitchpop excellence I am in awe miss Diamond

**dragonsteel33** (8): "sometimes i wanna believe in you / then i remember it's you" who the fuck hurt you hannah i just wanna talk with him

**runaway3212** (8): The last two minutes really save this song

**waluigiest** (8): when the beat comes in it does kinda bop

**yatcho** (7.8): major uWu

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The second half is pretty good.

**pat-rickstar** (7): Alright I get it your love goes on…. this song goes on too. The outro does redeem the song a bit for me though

**Stryxen** (7): this really just,,, keeps going

**rickikardashian** (6.7): i liked it by the end but it sure took a lifetime to get to the point

**addupten** (6.5): and the chorus goes on and the chorus goes on and the chorus goes on

**astrologicalangel** (6): this was a 4 until the bridge

**ignitethephoenix** (6): it was decent until the end

**lightningcrying** (6): only gets kinda interesting around the 2:30 mark, but even then it kinda underdelivers. it teases like its going to have a bigger, glitchier production but doesn't go all the way

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song goes on and this song

**anothertown** (5): finally some semblance of a beat comes in ¾ of the way through this song..

**pig-serpent** (5): Wouldn't say I'm diggin the vocal melodies in this one, and the instrumental feels a bit typical. The vocal glitch part at the end isn't anything that can't be found in other PC music songs.

**frogaranaman** (2): yas girl give us first song on GarageBand

I definitely think this song would have placed a bit higher if it wasn't for the phenomenal Fall Out Boy remix. Either way, this goes off and is probably the catchiest song on the album for me. The chorus is crack-infused

---

**anothertown** (11): I WAS TRYING TO FIND! A WAY TO KILL TIME! NOW YOU’RE GONE AND I CAN’T EVER SAY! GOODBYE! https://i.imgur.com/XATnTYG.gif

**awhile2** (11): my most played song of 2019. This shit goes off on my quarantine exercise bike runs

**didney-worl** (10): amazing

**kappyko** (10): YASS SWEET POTATO FRIES YASSSS

**pig-serpent** (10): I normally cower out of mosh pits, but this is one of two songs I reaaally want to throw elbows to.

**Stryxen** (10): i was dying to find a longer version

**Palutzel** (9): the remix is insanely good but this bops hard too, how do they serve like this?

**plastichaxan** (9): remix outsold too

**tearsinvegas** (9): eMoTiOnaL

**yatcho** (8.8): once you hear the remix to this it just isnt the same... a slapper but can't shake that I know it can be so much better

**akanewasright** (8.5): Remix >>>>> original. Especially when it comes to the ending. This version is still really fucking good though

**seanderlust** (8.3): this is pretty good!

**twat\_brained** (8.3): the remix is the best version of this song

**bbfan132** (8): i love their energy so much, i can’t wait to hear more music from them!!

**mayolizard** (8): this is great but both remixes outsold unfortunately

**steelstepladder** (8): Once again heavily outdone by the remix

**TiltControls** (8): actually not too bad

**banananaise** (7.5): "you just copy everything we do" prophetic monarchs

**1998tweety** (7): this is surprisingly good

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this one okay

**Carinm** (6.5): I think the strained vocals kinda bring it down

**ktajlili** (6): the remix is perfect, but the original sounds kind of unfinished?

**RandomHypnotica** (5.1): the bass was also crushed by a mallet I guess

**runaway3212** (5): a bit boring and bland

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Nah, this is just messy and just... uninspired, which is not a word I was expecting to use for a gecs track.

**skargardin** (4): im exhausted

**vayyiqra** (1): I hate the title to this so it puts me off the song a lot, which is irrational I admit, but also I don't like the song either. By this point I am always ready for this album to end

Shakespeare has been real quiet since Dorian sang the line "Masc for Mascara". That is all. 

---

**waluigiest** (11): idk how to properly explain how much I love this song. It is a MASSIVE bop that makes me want to dance, but it also dissects a fair bit of nuance around gender identity vs. expression vs. performance. And the bridge ties it all together without losing any of its magic. It’s hypnotic!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Fuck me the fuck up.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): stan Captain Hook from Once Upon A Time

**kappyko** (10): this is literally femmebot so it's good. also i love the lyrics here

**runaway3212** (10): The way they say glamourize makes this an automatic ten

**twat\_brained** (10): guyline me Dorian

**vayyiqra** (10): I remember in the 2000s when there was Discouse about guyliner and mocking it (it was an emo thing) and not much has changed since then huh / The line "masc for mascara" is hilarious

**pat-rickstar** (9.7): Beginning to get a little worried my scores will be considered sabotage for this album since they're all so high

**maxrocks329** (9): "Masc for Mascara" is the best line from any song ever

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): stupid and fun

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): Bop

**yatcho** (8.5): why wasn't this out circa 2008 when I was swooping my bangs and trying on my sister's eyeliner

**seanderlust** (8.3): men wearing eyeliner is underrated and was wrongfully shamed in the mid-2000s because of a deep-rooted sense of homophobia. in this essay I will

**anothertown** (8): pete wentz 2005-2008: ‘I...worked on this story for a year...and...they just...they tweeted it out’

**bbfan132** (8): love the subversion of gender norms in their songs!

**pig-serpent** (8): I'll be your fem boooooot—wait...

**Carinm** (7.8): very campy and fun track, the vocals feel a little weak to me on this one, and the constant background noise kinda clashes with the quieter voice they're using in this one imo

**addupten** (7.3): satirical bop

**skargardin** (7): a mood

**mayolizard** (5.5): well.

On Pfizer's theme song, Emily sings about the pandemic and how it has impacted her life. Corona IS indeed crazy, as she poetically points out.

**Stryxen** (10): a soft voice over a trap beat - clairo who

**TiltControls** (10): fair

**vayyiqra** (9): trap banger

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): Written in March when we still didn't fully understand the impact of the coronavirus to come, Emily tries her best to warn us of the incoming disaster. "Boom Boom Boom, Blow up", Emily was telling us that the cases were going to blow up, and we didn’t listen! We truly only have ourselves to blame

**banananaise** (8): ok WHERE is she finding these beats... drake better take notes

**1998tweety** (7.5): queen spilled, ended cardi

This did not deserve to barely miss the top 10!! Besides Adam & Steve, this is my favorite song on the album. I love how they are just unabashedly queer...they set such a great example ugh 

---

**pat-rickstar** (11): To me, this is Dorian Electra at their best. Totally camp, theatrical, melodramatic and well, flamboyant! I love this song

**steelstepladder** (11): It needs to go all the way

**bbfan132** (10): absolute banger, they did that!!!!

**bigbigbee** (10): Best song on the album!! They make their natural theatricality shine without being too much (as is the case for some other songs), and the pianos and synths are just amazing here

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is the only Dorian song I heard before the album but it’s great. This another song where all the effects and production work together

**ktajlili** (10): Often a common description for gay men, who are often stereotyped as being "less mainly" and more "feminine" than hetro men, flamboyant embodies a lot of characteristics of masculinity like "taking up lots of space" and "no time for restraint," as Dorian Electra points out. With unique sound and over-the-top keyboard instrumentals, Flamboyant celebrates being fun and over-the-top.

**seanderlust** (10): i think it's great that this song sneaks in references to Lesley Gore's "You Don't Own Me" and DJ Snake's "Turn Down For What"

**yatcho** (10): lyrically maybe the most shallow song on the album but the maximalist production on this is soooo good ABSRDST really snapped

**Carinm** (9): The instrumental and vocals on this track are literally perfection, the literal only flaw is that the lyrics are just soo underwhelming compared to literally every other part of this song.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): a philosophy to live by

**1998tweety** (8.5): this bops, the weird ending works too

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): A bit too mellow and not as "flamboyant" as quite a few other tracks on here are. Still great.

**runaway3212** (8): We love going all the way

**skargardin** (8): :

**waluigiest** (8): “I’m a very flaming flammable guy” same

**pig-serpent** (6): This song has a few cool moments but honestly it doesn't feel Flamboyant (pls don't kill me)

**vayyiqra** (6): This is okay but I expected better for a title track

**mayolizard** (5): head empty

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this has almost no momentum in the middle of the song and doesn't really go far afterwards...

**astrologicalangel** (4.5): I wish I liked this more

This is a song for the girls, gays, and theys and the girls, gays, and theys only. Anyone else can leave

---

**kappyko** (11): who wants to bet on the header for low score comments being "lonely people"

**yatcho** (11): you all BETTER put some respect on Miss Erotica's name in a hyperpop rate

**1998tweety** (10): I love the vibe of this song so much. I feel like I'm at a sleazy club and I'm making eyes with a guy across the room and then we somehow find our way to the dancefloor when the chorus hits and we start dancing. I think this is what gay culture is.

**banananaise** (10): literally gets me dancing like lindsay lohan at an early 2000s nightclub every time

**bbfan132** (10): a total bop and great intro to the album

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is how you start an ALBUM

**ktajlili** (10): Some great songs depict reality with detailed specificity. BFF transports the listener into a fantasy with smoking, "matching juicy lockets," and the perfect, sexy BFF -- the one person you meet that can make you feel sexy, confident, and indestructible when you two are together. Its highly colorful lyrics are elevated through dynamic instrumentals that build and drop at several satisfying moments through the song. Myspace music has never sounded better.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It kinda scares me how much Ayesha sounds like Charli on this song, like I could swear it was her if I didn't know any better

**sarcasticsobs** (10): this was the first slayyyter song i ever heard and almost lost my shit

**twat\_brained** (10): what a debut

**vayyiqra** (10): Me and my bestie have an in-joke because we saw Slayyyter together so we call each other "BFF"

**waluigiest** (10): I want to describe this song as buttery

**Stryxen** (9): ok besties !!

**dragonsteel33** (8.8): rly like the instrumental and i miss ayesha :(

**seanderlust** (8.1): well tell your BFF jill that i'm taking away your phone.

**anothertown** (8): me when my gf and I are gal pals

**Carinm** (8): Stan Ayesha

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is a girls only song!!

**pig-serpent** (8): A good introduction to Slayyyter's style, and every element of the beat contributes what they should be. I think the biggest thing holding this song back is the hook.

**runaway3212** (8): I just want to take this time to say I feel like Ayesha deserved better

**skargardin** (8): B B B B BB

**steelstepladder** (8): Good but I was waiting for it to go next level and it never really did

**addupten** (7.8): missin miss ayesha :(

**astrologicalangel** (7): God I miss Ayesha

**mayolizard** (6.5): idk

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I remember liking this more, but apparently not.

**LesApfels** (5.5): I just don't think it goes anywhere

**akanewasright** (4): I’m aware that this is a hot take, but this song doesn’t stack up against the other tracks in the rate, at least for me. It’s cute though, and I think Slayyyter and Ayesha sound great on it.

I am absolutely gagged this didn't make top 5. This song is literal sugary bubblegum pop perfection and it barely made top 10?? Kind of a robbery if you ask me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): im infatuated and love house-influenced pop how could i give my 11 to anything else

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection.

**bbfan132** (10): sugary bubblegum pop perfection

**hikkaru** (10): house bop

**kappyko** (10): the transition between BFF and this makes it so obvious that this is a mixtape cobbled from singles

**mysario** (10): saved pop music

**plastichaxan** (10): pop girlies will make songs that say oh me oh my and us gays will eat it up

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the absolute peak of the slayyyter aesthetic. It's glossy, pretty and smooth, and it just feels sugary and sexy. a bop in every sense of the word

**mayolizard** (9.5): mwah period

**awhile2** (9): maybe 8

**banananaise** (9): let me give you this attention that you ordered ma'am

**pat-rickstar** (9): The sample in this is so instantly recognisable and somehow I can never remember what song it's from

**anothertown** (8): it’s paint-by-numbers house but there’s nothing wrong with that!

**Carinm** (8): Queen

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Never liked it as much as other people do, but it's cute.

**pig-serpent** (8): Slayyyter and Gaga bringing back this sultry dance pop so far has been doing soceity a favor

**waluigiest** (8): big bop. It feels kind of unsettling tho idk

**yatcho** (8): She's a good time but she's a little basic. I'll be a little mad if this is the highest rated song on this album is the most well known.

**lightningcrying** (7): made me want to listen to XS by rina sawayama

**LesApfels** (6.5): Umru remix outsold

**Palutzel** (6.2): i know the gays are dying for this song but it's just ok..

**runaway3212** (5): This song feels really tryhard to me

**dragonsteel33** (3): it doesn't really work for me and feels very repetitive especially the last third that's just "oh me oh my / i wanna make you mine"

**akanewasright** (2): There’s a part of me that still likes it, but I’ve listened to it so many times that it barely sounds like music anymore. I’m beyond sick of it. I’d give it a 0 if I didn’t have shame

This was the first Hannah Diamond song I ever heard and I've been in love with her ever since. It's such a chill track but you can also bop to it if you want. Glad this made it to the top 10!

---

**moooo566** (11): this was actually the first pc music song i heard, so really it's to blame for all this

**akanewasright** (10): A pretty perfect song. This is like the only Hannah Diamond song I can play for non-PC fans and have them not completely hate it.

**awhile2** (10): hearing this song open PC music vol 2 was the moment I was convinced the movemnt wasn’t just a fad

**bbfan132** (10): trance perfection

**runaway3212** (10): This just works for me, so well.

**skargardin** (10): this production goes off!!!

**twat\_brained** (10): Hannah's best after Part of Me

**yatcho** (10): an absolute classic and one of the first songs that really got me into PC music

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): This is probably her best song imo

**1998tweety** (9): this is nice

**banananaise** (9): honestly the biggest banger in this rate, even if it is a sadbanger

**Stryxen** (9): there’s something different wrong with the “fade. away. from meeeee” each time it’s repeated

**vayyiqra** (9): bop

**Palutzel** (8.1): come on, one of the best songs of the album was released 4 years ago...

**rickikardashian** (7.8): this feels like a hatsune miku song. that’s not a bad thing

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Oh wow, the outro.

**pig-serpent** (7): Most of a chill EDM song that's just here to vibe, Hannah's barely a presence on this song. I don't think it completely pulls off what it's aiming for, but it is coming close.

**steelstepladder** (6): it do be okay

**seanderlust** (5.3): appropriately enough, this one just kind of fades into the background for me. though props for the picture saved on the screen line

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.2): susanne sundfør outsold

Of all the Dorian songs to end up in the top 10 with Man To Man, I did not expect it to be this one, but I'm not mad at it. *cries in unemployment*

**runaway3212** (11): My dad after my grandpa lost all of our family money be like

**anothertown** (10): American Psycho (1999)

**astrologicalangel** (10): me after working one (1) hour

**pat-rickstar** (10): The production on the chorus slapssss

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I don't really like the bridge, but that doesn't stop me from loving the track all the same. Why does Dorian manage to make being a office slave sound so hot?

**steelstepladder** (10): I listen to this while job hunting

**Stryxen** (10): i love dorian so much lol how is this so good

**twat\_brained** (10): i want Dorian's career

**waluigiest** (10): “business and pleasure: I like to mix the two” is a line I think about very often

**bbfan132** (9): these lyrics are awesome and i loved the chorus

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The chorus is kinda flat, despite a yummy bass line. Outstanding otherwise though.

**ktajlili** (9): Personal taste is keeping this from being a ten. I definitely do not like this one as much as Flamboyant, money machine, or BFF. In fact, I didn't even like it at all when I first heard about it. I guess out of context, it's hard to appreciate Dorian Electra's music. However, seeing it in the context of the album + music video, it's a tight, well-written song!

**rickikardashian** (9): i had high expectations of dorian because i liked man to man and career boy…………. well

**skargardin** (9): work anthem

**Palutzel** (8.7): iconic, basically Dorian's breakthrough

**seanderlust** (8.7): i liked this song a lot more once I got what they were getting at. satirizing corporate bro culture with 2010 EDM musical moments >>>>

**notceitn** (8): that bridge 🥵🥵

**pig-serpent** (8): Cute song with one of the more memorable choruses of the album.

**vayyiqra** (8): I can say firsthand this is what the working world is like, so yay for capitalism. Stan Friedrich Hayek!

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): okay i love the lyrics bc they're fun but this song kinda plods along when it feels like it wants to move a bit more

**1998tweety** (7): this is alright

**banananaise** (7): spotify has put this song in my shuffle far too many times for me to really enjoy it anymore

**dragonsteel33** (7): reminds me of rina sawayama's poppier/RnB-ier music idk

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I really like the verses but chorus is eh to me.

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I wouldn’t call many songs on this album boring, but this one is to me.

**lightningcrying** (6.5): the lyrics are kinda meh, i get what they are trying to say but it falls kinda flat. their delivery in the chorus is really fun tho, def got them some points

**mayolizard** (6): I don't have many thoughts uh its cool ig idk sob

**kappyko** (5): the video to this is so good......... but the song is just aight and Ironic Pop Star Critique of Capitalism is so fucking groan-worthy!!!

On the title track of her debut album, Emily holds nothing back and absolutely pops off. The production and her bars make it seem as if she has been in the game 10 years...but it's only been one hour.

---

**astrologicalangel** (10): why does this go off though?

**engifear** (10): yes queen

**frogaranaman** (10): this album is perfection

**ignitethephoenix** (10): fire

**mayolizard** (10): so relatable

**RandomDKguy** (10): they say "A picture is worth a thousand words" but Emily can rap 1000

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Here we see Emily choose to out her full name, "Emily montes" in the title, taking a page from one of popheads favourites, Ms. Rina Sawayama, in order to symbolise her legacy, the family history, and the pressure that comes with living up to their expectations. She's climbing the ranks of celebrity rapidly, and the tense strings and harsh beat represents that pressure she is feeling, she knows she's got the ability, but it doesn't make it any less stressful.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): queen of this TikTok game

**Stryxen** (10): i KNOW yall heard that transition

**TiltControls** (10): Is it just me or do those last few notes sound like the wii shop channel

**plastichaxan** (9.5): dark

**waluigiest** (8): side b to the title track I love it

**seanderlust** (7.7): bars

**1998tweety** (7): tiktok GAME

**akanewasright** (7): The cohesion between the first track and this... ugh her mind

HEY YOU LIL PISS BABY. YOU THINK YOU'RE SO FUCKING COOL? HUH? YOU THINK YOU'RE SO FUCKING TOUGH?

I don't know anyone who loved this song on first listen, including me. This was my intro to gecs and my first thought was "what the actual fuck?" A year later I am still obsessed with this song. The gecs are already a very polarizing group, and I'm not surprised this song had such a high controversy score. This was in the top 3 for much of the rate but by the time all the results were in, it dropped down to #6

---

**engifear** (11): hey little piss baby

**hunnybee12** (11): gecs is the revolution

**mayolizard** (11): best song ever I think. you know songs like that they are stories that people can identify with, you know what i mean anybody.... children were singing this song at graduations, at weddings, at funerals

**addupten** (10): mmmmm piss baby and big trucks

**anothertown** (10): “feel so clean like a money machine” officially proved that similes are not dead

**awhile2** (10): my most played song of 2019

**bigbigbee** (10): This song incites so much headbanging it’s bad for my back

**Carinm** (10): I will never be able to listen to this around anyone else

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): iconic and my non-slayyyter pick to win

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Iconic for all the wrong (right?) reasons.

**ktajlili** (10): Even Laura Less, who wrote the majority of the lyrics, doesn't really know what the song means. And maybe that's the brilliance of it. It doesn't take itself seriously. Yet, 100 gecs captures the absurdity of pop culture so effortlessly you can't help but want to dive deeper.

**lightningcrying** (10): that first verse is so iconic. i think this might be the most accessible song on the album? its catchy af and the song structure is very easy to follow

**pig-serpent** (10): Everyone remembers the first time they heard Money Machine by 100 gecs.

**RandomDKguy** (10): gec

**runaway3212** (10): okay but why do people with such a small truck talk so much shit?

**sarcasticsobs** (10): piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby piss baby

**seanderlust** (10): i hated this song. I fucking HATED this song the first time I heard it. and then it ended up being my number 2 song on spotify wrapped this year.

**twat\_brained** (10): literally invented pissbabies

**richbitchjuice** (9.6): 👋 hey lil 💦 piss 🍼 baby 🥺 you think 🤔 you're so 💢 fucking 😎 cool? ❄️ huh? 😤you think 🤔 you're so 💢 fucking tough? you talk 💁‍♀️ a lotta 🤑 BIG 🕹 GAME 🎲 for someone with such a 👌 small 🚘 truck 🚚 aww 🐰 look 👀 at those 💪 arms your 💪 arms look 👀 so 💢 fucking 🌸 cute 💕 they look 👀 like little 👌cigarettes 🚬 I bet I could 💨smoke 😤 you, I could ♨️ roast you 🔥 and then you'd ❤️ love it 💕 and you'd 📳 text 🔤 me I 💖 love 💘 you ❣️ and then 🕣 I'd 💢 fucking 👻 GHOST 🖕YOU 💀

**bbfan132** (8): dylan brady only makes bops

**skargardin** (8): feel so clean like a roisin machine

**Stryxen** (8): AAAAAAAAAAAAH

**rickikardashian** (7.8): i love having to dock entire points because i hate these loudass outros

**tearsinvegas** (7.6): the song that started it all

**kappyko** (7): this doesnt really feel like single material honestly lol

**ignitethephoenix** (4): ehh it’s catchy but not great

**RandomHypnotica** (3): this really feels like the most "gec" track of the bunch, and how much you like that depends on your overall feelings. I hate it, it feels like it's just some kind of forced edge)

**waluigiest** (3): I gotta be honest. My friends love 100 gecs, and they showed me this song to introduce me to them. And I think this song is really dumb. So it didn’t hook me, and I didn’t try again until the Ringtone remix came out

**1998tweety** (1): awful and cringey

**TiltControls** (1): the end sounds like those jumpscare games mixed with the occasional airhorn

**vayyiqra** (1): vayyiqra 05/04/2020 @STELLAWORM you should be involved in money laundering. money, as we know from centuries of monetarist theory, is nothing more than a socially agreed upon exchange-value issued by fiat from the state, an inherently coercive institution which itself rests on dubious moral foundations. furthermore, in the seminal neoclassical composition "money machine", laura les sings that she feels so clean, like a money machine implying that money laundering is a morally forthright enterprise especially as it relates to the lived experience of transness under capitalism - a system of property relations which systematically marginalizes them and excludes them from access to the means of production and offers them only precarious financial stability. to launder ("clean") money therefore in a systematic manner (the metaphorical "machine" spoken of prior) is a rebellious and indeed revolutionary act against structures of institutional oppression. (in anarchist theory, this philosophy of undermining the state's authority by extrajudicial means is known as illegalism.) in conclusion: be gay, do crimes. secure the bag sis :moneybag: [9 stars]

**RandomHypnotica** (6): TikTok has been an incredibly influential platform in the past few years in the music industry, and I think we can all agree Ms. Montes is the prime example of just how powerful it can truly be. She first uploaded her music as only a little bit of fun, but thankfully the algorithm blessed people, and allowed them to see her pure talent, as the best rapper alive! She's so powerful she even got Travis Scott to retire, because he knew he simply couldn't compete.

**banananaise** (5): a rare misstep from the queen of tiktok and free-to-use trap beats

The debut single. The song that started it all. Was there any other option for a winner? Emily brilliantly capitalizes the L in her first name to show how any rapper that tries and goes after her takes an L. Genius queen

The choice to capitalise the L may represent the "L"oss of innocence she experienced when the world around her came to a halt as the coronavirus pandemic shut down life as she knew it. She paints a vivid picture of her life, allowing us a window into her world, and a tease of the themes to be explored. A truly perfect opener

**static\_int\_husp** (10): queen of being five

**Stryxen** (10): she misses school but she’s stuck inside :(

**TiltControls** (10): ugh what a perfect opener

**TragicKingdom1** (10): most iconic debut single of all time, britney spears who?

I'm shook this placed above Mine but I'm so pleasantly surprised. This is my second favorite of Slayyyter's, behind Cha Ching. As many of her songs are, this song is laced with crack. The glitchy, chaotic production mixed with the conventional pop hooks and melodies is brilliant. She created a bop and a half.

---

**1998tweety** (11): I love Britney, this actually bops so hard wtf.

**hikkaru** (11): every part of this is so catchy and the glitchy production sounds so good. the song that got me into slayyyter and still my fave from her

**akanewasright** (10): The best song on the Slayyyter mixtape

**anothertown** (10): This is her peak, she will never make anything better than this. She and Ayesha took cling clang electroclash and gave it focus and forward motion at 100 miles per hour. The lyrics are pretty juvenile but I don’t care you know the vibes

**awhile2** (10): probably top 10 pop hooks of the 2010s. Would be my second choice for an 11

**bbfan132** (10): this production goes hard

**bigbigbee** (10): This song transported me back to a Limited Too in 2004 and I’m here for it, I’m gonna buy a pink blow up chair and some Neopets merch

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this really is the greatest song britney never recorded

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): M E G A B O P. Ayesha Erotica hardly ever disappoints tbh.

**kappyko** (10): remember when we rated this on the popheads jukebox

**pig-serpent** (10): I never knew that I wanted Britney to make a breakbeat album until I heard this song, and now it's all I want.

**plastichaxan** (10): truly her best song yup yup

**sarcasticsobs** (10): this was the second slayyyter song I ever heard and it DID lose my shit. Still her 2nd best song for me. almost an 11 honestly, just insane

**twat\_brained** (10): DRAG HER SLAY HER READ HER

**yatcho** (9.5): Really got me into pop girls singing angrily over early 2000s production with a tinge of Nu-metal before XS by Rina Sawayama perfected the craft

**seanderlust** (9.2): if 2003 era britney did a cover album of N*SYNC songs and released it on a CD but that CD got damaged

**maxrocks329** (9): I'm pretty sure she owes royalties to Britney for this

**mayolizard** (9): thinking about the jungkook video kat always sends, nobody knows what I'm talking about but yas

**skargardin** (9): we love an angry bop

**Stryxen** (9): ahhh its so intense

**addupten** (8.5): it’s kind of cheesy but I like that

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this is hyperbritney

**Palutzel** (8.1): fuck me up

**vayyiqra** (8): A very good Britney LARP

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): nice blackout britney impression

**steelstepladder** (7.5): It can be a bit too busy at times but still good

**Carinm** (7): Like it but kinda repetitive

**runaway3212** (7): I dislike certain parts but it's mostly fine

**ignitethephoenix** (5.8): my poor ears

**banananaise** (5.5): a faithful tribute to the kind of 2000s song i never really liked that much

DaHumanTorch: # Slayyyter

---

**Overall Average**: 7.502 **// Average Controversy:** 1.859

---

**kappyko** (9.357): maybe the only y2k pop star person that knows how to make a full fucking project

**vayyiqra** (9.071): I really like this album! I didn't think it would be my thing because of her "trashy" aesthetic but there are some real bangers on here and it's consistently fun and catchy. These songs also go off live, I can attest. I wonder how sabotaged this will be Great album!: D

**RandomHypnotica** (8.921): Definitely my favourite of the albums here, it feels like distilled pop adrenaline, visceral and hyper and energetic and fun

**plastichaxan** (8.750): I didn't remember how much I enjoy this album even if it loses steam towards the end omfg

**RandomDKguy** (8.714): slayyyter just slays ok?

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.657): far and away the best album of the batch

**seanderlust** (8.586): slayyyter's sound is interesting. it combines dated sounds from different past eras (early Y2K britney, 2010s teenage dream, a touch of 90s house and 2013 EDM) in a way that feels unique. these are genres that touch on and influence each other, but haven't really been combined like this very much. slayyyter is one of the more radio-friendly artists in this rate (which why she isn't getting more mainstream attention is beyond me), which jives with me personally. I will for sure be listening more in the future (Mine is already on repeat)

**twat\_brained** (8.386): buy Self Destruct so Cathy can buy more OnlyFans subscriptions♥️

**yatcho** (8.300): god her music makes me want to morph into a bimbo with double F tits

**banananaise** (7.857): god her pose on the cover always freaks me out

**pat-rickstar** (7.757): Mostly enjoyable mixtape, my second favourite project in the rate.

**skargardin** (7.643): Really solid project with some obvious filler.

**tearsinvegas** (7.350): this is everything

**Carinm** (7.321): Good album, some amazing songs but also some very very boring ones that drag it down, so many of the songs sound the exact same bc of the production.

**steelstepladder** (7.071): I know a lot of people think the Hannah Diamond album blurs together (which it does) but this album also has its fair share of forgettable filler if I'm being honest :/

**Palutzel** (7.043): horny af

**Seedub192** (7.000): The highlights are amazing but jesus the middle drags

**ktajlili** (6.786): Provocative, but maximalist, Slayyyter shows the potential of becoming a pioneer in hyperpop.

**runaway3212** (6.679): I don't hate this record, but I would be lying if I said I wouldn't rather listen to Pop 2 the entire album long.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6.500): She's mostly a fad, but despite her frequent misses, the bullseyes she hits (i.e. All I Want For XXXmas) are quite good.

**frogaranaman** (6.500): this album is so funny to listen to knowing she’s from Kirkwood, like absurdly funny

**anothertown** (6.357): I can’t help but see this album as a playlist rather than a cohesive project. It’s also totally frontloaded and takes a steep dropoff with daddy af. I used to love Slater and saw her as a huge talent but in the 18-ish months since I started listening to her, I’ve come across such better music in this genre and realize how uneven her discography/this album is. But when it hits (Alone, Cha Ching, Ur Man, Devil) it really hits.

**dragonsteel33** (6.150): 6.2 mean of all the songs LMFAO

**lightningcrying** (6.129): i warmed up to it after the second listen but i still think its a bit weak. it definitely has some bops in it but slayyyter doesnt show a lot of personality, so far its just 00's party girl. but still, its a fun listen.

Dorian's final song in the rate is out. I love this song and how it ends the concept of gender and masculinity, as much of this album does. The opening line is up against NFR as best opening line ever in a song.

---

**astrologicalangel** (11): in my heart this is the winner of the rate

**ktajlili** (11): Masculinity is full of contradiction, and no song points this out in a more clever way than Dorian Electra's "Man To Man."

**rotating3Dtext** (11): “You know I ain't straight/But I'ma say it straight to you” must be one of the most iconic opening lines ever. This is just a perfect, catchy, pop song.

**akanewasright** (10): Oh I really like this. I feel bad bc this is much more traditional pop than some of the other stuff here, but WOW

**anothertown** (10): A perfect song!

**bbfan132** (10): fuck toxic masculinity and traditional gender roles

**Carinm** (10): Love, the lyrics are great, the instrumental is unique, the vocals are unique and strong, the themes are cute, just great.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): finally some good f*cking music on this album!

**plastichaxan** (10): you know i ain't straight but imma say it straight to you :yas:

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "You know I ain't straight, but I will say it straight to you" is SUCH a good lyric

**runaway3212** (10): I love being gay

**skargardin** (10): their catchiest work for me

**yatcho** (10): This is Dorian firing on all cylinders for me. The most cleverly written metaphor with the most concise message, while also being ridiculously catchy on top. AND of course the video is amazing

**pig-serpent** (9): Sometimes ballads can just vibe. And Dorian is killing it here.

**seanderlust** (8.9): we stan encouraging men to share their feelings and emote

**Palutzel** (8.8): soo good, Dorian really delivers

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I enjoy the lyrics and production here. Unlike the previous song everything kind of works together

**rickikardashian** (8): that not-so-high high note? love it

**steelstepladder** (8): rhythmic snapping out of the shadows

**Stryxen** (8): might send this to the guy i'm crushing on lol that would just be funny

**twat\_brained** (8): the more i hear this the less effect it has on me. It peaked when I saw an interpretive performance of this at a gay bar last year though

**vayyiqra** (8): From the title I thought this was going to be a homoerotic joke song, but the lyrics are about men being vulnerable and embracing their emotions and wtf that's wholesome I love that

**waluigiest** (8): bro..... what if we beat each other up ,,. And then I kiss you?

**1998tweety** (7): this is kind of mid idk why it has the most streams. they kinda sound like marina here tbh

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): It kinda falls flat in the chorus like a few of the other Dorian tracks, but this one doesn't have much else to elevate it either.

**mayolizard** (6): noticing a pattern with dorians music where i think "hmm this is good!" and then feel no emotions this is so bizarre and indescribable

**awhile2** (5): was this big on tik tok why does it have so many more plays than all their other songs despite being the worst on the album

**kappyko** (4): the chorus is depressingly boring nvm

DaHumanTorch: # Flamboyant

---

**Overall Average**: 7.230 **// Average Controversy:** 1.918

---

**plastichaxan** (9.033): So consistently good and the lows are not even that low for me, this is truly something else

**anothertown** (8.733): I’m glad that this rate forced me to listen to this album because it’s excellent. The framework of Dorian trying on the different modes of masculinity in each song is such a clear, efficient analogy and critique. Very well executed concept and well executed bops also.

**runaway3212** (8.633): Dorian just works, in everything they do, I really like this album

**steelstepladder** (8.533): If it weren't for the bonus tracks which are kinda eh this would have walked away with an over 9 average.

**twat\_brained** (8.460): okay this album will make me stan Dorian i love it

**pat-rickstar** (8.280): Has a non-binary artist won one of our rates before? I'd love Dorian to be win this rate. They deserve it, this album is banger after banger.

**RandomDKguy** (8.267): I agree with the melon

**waluigiest** (8.200): Even though this album came out last year, it was my most played album of 2020. I found out about it in January and was instantly obsessed. The production is, to put it simply, immaculate. The writing is campy and fun and deep at points, and Dorian really hits on a lot of interesting queer topics and experiences. It’s a wonderful album.

**seanderlust** (8.127): dorian said we are done with gender, and they should say it. I like the dark, moody instrumentation throughout, I love the playing around with traditional gender roles. lyrically I am reminded of MARINA in the sense of being very writerly (which obvs this comment is not lol). I look forward to diving more into dorian's work

**Palutzel** (8.040): such a solid album, banger after banger

**sarcasticsobs** (7.967): kinda falls off around where the original tracklist ended

**Carinm** (7.853): Best overall album in the rate by far. Super focused themes, great vocals, great lyrics, great production, and they do it without having very repetitive tracks or a completely unfocused vision.

**Stryxen** (7.833): the best album here lol

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.800): If Dorian doesn't landslide the entire rate, at least they did win my ballot. The deluxe tracks are dragging this down HARD, however.

**lightningcrying** (7.620): has the best defined vision of all these albums imo. the sound is consistent and interesting throughout the whole album, and dorian stays within their theme of exploring different aspects of masculinity without ever sounding like they are repeating themselves or boring you in any way. the production, as interesting and flashy as it is, never outshines dorian and does not feel like a crutch, which was a problem i had with some of the other albums.

**yatcho** (7.600): Dorian is such a breath of fresh air. For a while I really thought of them more as a visual act with whatever music, but actually listening to the album closely reveals a lot more depth. They're basically a drag act but actually saying something fresh about gender norms, couple that with some really amazing experimental production and surprisingly high quality visuals you get a top notch pop act. The only consistent flaw is Dorian's vocals, they're often harshly overproduced to the point of grating

**RandomHypnotica** (7.333): I'd heard the singles from this album a while ago, but I didn't really like them much at the time. However, listening to the full album was a pleasant surprise, and there is some solid bops to be found on here

**banananaise** (6.967): i swear i listened to this so much when it came out but when i listened to it again for this rate, i didn't recognise like half the songs

**pig-serpent** (6.900): Dorian Electra is a beast on vocals but the snythwork on this album is a bit samey and it honestly feels like a downgrade from what Charli works with. I enjoyed their attempts to branch out more on the instrumentals on My Agenda and I think they have a fantastic album waiting to come out

**vayyiqra** (6.867): I admit I slept on this album because the aesthetics Dorian uses in their work seemed weird and a bit offputting (see: the reactions to their "Edgelord" video) but got into it after hearing Hana play some songs from it on her livestreams (they're good friends). As well, seeing them talk about lofty subjects with Hana ranging from ancient Greek philosophy to quantum physics and the finer points of the garment industry made me gain a lot of respect for them. Dorian is a very smart and clever person and even though this album is a bit uneven and I don't love all their music, this is still enjoyable and well-made music and Dorian is a very underrated artist, I think.

**skargardin** (6.867): They really snapped here. Even though I do not care for the deluxe tracks this is still a solid and innovative project imo.

**dragonsteel33** (6.807): 6.9 idk why but dorian electra has always seemed like the musical equivalent of contrapoints to me and their music reminds me of homestuck LMFAO. i like the album but sometimes their voice gets lost under the instrumentals and my agenda has a much better voice-instrumental balance imo

**tearsinvegas** (6.707): I do love the songs but some are just so grating even though I know that’s the point.

**rickikardashian** (5.400): finishing this album was a task

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.393): there are so many great starts to good ideas on this album but rarely do they ever feel like they're executed successfully. tbh i bumped up my scores a bit on this one just to try and not have one album be like way noticeably lower than the others but i honestly did not enjoy this beyond a song or two

**kappyko** (4.733): its so obvious how much better as a work of satire and musically My Agenda is than this idgi.

**frogaranaman** (3.600): this was like listening to a train wreck

This was the winner of the rate for the longest time, until it just barely dropped to third place. While the remix, featuring many popheads favs, certainly is the better song, the base song is still fantastic and is definitely their most conventional / new listener friendly song.

---

**bigbigbee** (11): The remix outsold SLIGHTLY but the original is right up there. This song is just so cute, so earnest, such a novel but adorable way to express “I love you!”

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): This is just really fucking good

**anothertown** (10): then I crack a smile cuz I love you and id do it all again!!

**awhile2** (10): I’m sorry but Laura les’s part at 1:00 makes this version better than the remix

**Carinm** (10): Amazing song, very cute lyrics and the production is great, love the emotion and strain when she says its always you. literally zero flaws imo.

**kappyko** (10): YASS SWEET POTATO FRIES YASSSS (the final chorus maaaaaakes this)

**pig-serpent** (10): Maybe I'm just drunk as fuck but the breakdown of this song might be the best moment of the album. Wait, I'm completely sober. Yeah, this song rules.

**sandyfishnets** (10): I THINK I MIGHT BE ADDICTED TO YOUR KISSES oh wait

**seanderlust** (10): aw :)

**TiltControls** (10): Okay I'll give you this one gecs

**engifear** (9.8): this was the first 100 gecs song I heard and if I had rated it then, I woulda given it a 3/10, but thank god I kept listening to them.

**Seedub192** (9.5): not a ten because the remix is somehow better

**Stryxen** (9.5): i love the rhythm in the verses it’s so bouncy

**waluigiest** (9.5): it works well as a blend of pretty melodies and more aggressive hyperpop elements. I love the bridge of the original, but it does miss out a bit on the features

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): this made me realize that i do in fact have a special tone & vibration pattern for my cr*sh lmao

**pat-rickstar** (9.2): Insert comment about the remix being better here

**rotating3Dtext** (9.2): the Charli remix was one of my most listened to songs of 2020

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The remix elevates this to a 12.

**plastichaxan** (9): the remix outsold

**rickikardashian** (9): i would give the remix my 11

**steelstepladder** (9): The remix is an 11

**twat\_brained** (9): let me turning this up

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): the remix outsold but this is cute

**tearsinvegas** (8.4): first gec song that clicked with me but definitely one of the most accessible

**1998tweety** (8): the other good song on the album. the charli/kbb/rico remix is surprisingly good, an easy 10.

**addupten** (8): wish i had a boy to set his own ringtone for

**notceitn** (8): still better than the remix!!! I am willing to die on this hill idc

**RandomDKguy** (8): gec charli can you do the chorus please

**InfernalSolstice** (7.5): this is kind of endearing in a weird way although the remix far outsold

**runaway3212** (7.5): Imagine having a boyfriend

**bbfan132** (7): i definitely prefer the remix to this, the original version feels kind of underwhelming

**maxrocks329** (7): I've listened to the remix so many times I forgot that there was an original

**mayolizard** (7): remix also outsold :soobcry:

**skargardin** (7): this is catchy i'll admit

**dragonsteel33** (6.9): i like the remix a lot more but it's a cute lil bop!!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): the remix is better

**akanewasright** (4.5): The remix outclasses this version in every regard for me. I like the production more, I like the vocals more, I like “Charli can you sing the chorus again please”... I just like it more. I’m aware that the middle verse flips the meaning in a clever way, but the remix just makes me happier.

**vayyiqra** (2): The first minute of this is fun and cute and my favourite part of the album (low bar) and then the rest is just boring. The remix is a little better, but only because Cholli and KKB are on it

Our second place song, and the highest rated gecs song, is this massive banger. The way they took ska elements and turned it into *this*. They're either insane or brilliant or (most likely) both.

**RandomDKguy** (10): gec

**twat\_brained** (10): Scuderia Ferrari, 2009 onwards (colorized)

**seanderlust** (9.3): if sublime, blink 182, the medic droid and the people behind caramelldansen collaborated on a track. WHY DOES THIS WORK????

**1998tweety** (9): well. i actually like this oop.

**bbfan132** (9): more ska 100 gecs please and ty

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): every nightcore "remix" on YT that is just a normal song at 200% speed

**skargardin** (4): the guitar is nice

**TiltControls** (3): at least this one is consistent. Unfortunately that doesn't mean it's good

**vayyiqra** (1): A very obnoxious song + idk why it's a fan favourite + I'm tapping my foot to the double-time part but not enjoying it

DaHumanTorch: # 1000 gecs

---

**Overall Average**: 7.489 **// Average Controversy:** 2.158

---

**pig-serpent** (9.200): I listened to this the day it came out and it quickly jumped into one of my favorite albums ever. It still hasn't gotten old in a year and a half of overplay.

**plastichaxan** (9.000): i hate that this probably has my favorite average, but it just makes sense too, each song is pretty strong, even i need help (i know i gave it a 6 but only in the context of the rate)

**kappyko** (8.800): theyre not even that weird lol

**Palutzel** (8.720): unironically one of the best pop albums that i've ever heard

**RandomDKguy** (8.600): gec

**twat\_brained** (8.410): stream food house they're on gecs' label

**runaway3212** (8.400): This album is weird to me because I listened to tree of clues, which I prefer, first, that said it's really good

**Stryxen** (8.350): gec gec gec gec gec

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.270): my favorite thing about this album is just how unashamedly goofy it can be

**tearsinvegas** (7.900): honestly the remix album is a lot stronger but wow what a debut

**bigbigbee** (7.800): This album is the one among these that I wish I could have seen live. I can only imagine the energy in the room for some of these songs. I don’t even understand myself why I love this noisy, metallic beep boop music…but I really do, and I can’t wait to hear more from them!

**ktajlili** (7.800): Defined by abrasive beats, nonsensical lyrics, 100 gecs, pushes the genre into a chaotic territory with an album that fuses popular rap, pop, techno, dubstep, EDM, pop punk styles -- sometimes switching styles every 30 seconds.

**steelstepladder** (7.750): I still don't know how I feel abut the gecs lmao

**lightningcrying** (7.630): there isnt a single dull moment in here. it makes me nostalgic for late 00's internet, listening to crazy frog while i play stardoll, getting viruses from limewire…

**yatcho** (7.580): how this caught on with the straights, i will never know

**dragonsteel33** (7.420): 7.4

**rickikardashian** (7.180): gecs is not my think, it probably never will, but they’re genuinely good songwriters that simply love to produce with everything elevated to a thousand and im so fascinated by the stuff they do

**Carinm** (7.150): Relistening to this made me feel a little underwhelmed, definitely had a stronger first impression compared to now, still has some bops.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.800): I really thought I would hate this, but it's actually much more listenable than I thought

**ElizabethDDoS** (6.600): It's fun.

**banananaise** (6.350): 100 gecs are cool when you listen to one of their good songs once, but listening to an entire album's worth in a row makes me feel like i am in one of the outer (more fun) circles of hell

**pat-rickstar** (6.320): After listening to this a few times, I've decided I generally prefer gecs production for other artists - more Hannah Diamond/100 gecs collabs pleasethe!. I can't take some of these songs seriously tbh as they go too far into meme territory.

**seanderlust** (6.230): look, i'm trying to be fair here so i'm not seen as tanking a score, because I swear that's really not my intention. it's just...I am not a rulebreaker. I am not even a rulebender. that's why cooking gives me such anxiety - I can't just do like "a bit of paprika" - you need to tell me an eighth of a teaspoon or i'm going to have a breakdown. that's maybe why this album is so varied for me. when it works, it WORKS and is some of the better music i've heard recently. this is usually when it follows some pretty long-established musical convention. when it doesn't hit though...it really doesn't.

**TiltControls** (4.550): the common theme with this album was there were some songs I'd bump the scores all up by like 5 if I could cut 30 seconds off each song. There are definitely components that work, but either the drop fails or the ending is trash or something happens that prevents me from actually enjoying listening to it. At least the back half wasn't too bad? Still this is probably the lowest album score I've ever given.

**CreepyMannequin** (4.000): sorry but this is probably the worst album I’ve ever heard lol

**skargardin** (3.800): I genuinely dislike this album so much. Most of it is completely unlistenable to me apart from ringtone and money machine. I get the appeal, but it just is not for me.

**vayyiqra** (1.300): Yes, these scores look like sabotage. This isn't just me hating on this album and bashing it, trust me - I simply don't like it. I don't want to hate it. I've heard it many times, trying to see why anyone would like it, but all I can come up with is that they like the "chaotic" and frenetic energy it has and its abrasiveness. I don't like chaotic or abrasive things, and so this feels like a bad prank, like it was meant to be a parody of popular music but it's not funny. It makes me roll my eyes, like "how droll". It's catchy music, I will say that, but that's the only thing I like about this mess of an album. I tried, really. Since I last rated it months ago, my feelings have not changed. In fact, I gave it a slightly better score this time. I hope this convinces you that I am sincere and my scores are legitimate and I just do not like this band at all. gecgecgecgec

I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS WON THE RATE????? I was expecting early top 10, but the WINNER??? This was my 11 from the start and to watch it start at #7 and slowly rise until it cemented itself as #1 was so exhilarating. Everyone had doubts about Miss Hannah, but she proved everyone wrong and is now a rate winner! That second half when the beat switches is one of my favorite moments in music from 2019, I go absolutely crazy every time. I'm so surprised / happy this won

---

**bbfan132** (11): one of the best covers i’ve heard - that second half is sublime

**plastichaxan** (11): after long deliberation, i chose to give this my 11, i had a contender from each album and this song is truly on another level for me

**Seedub192** (11): this is humanity's crowning achievement

**static\_int\_husp** (11): The drop really goes off. I've seen a local DJ who does hyperpop sets put this one on and it truly makes people go insane.

**addupten** (10): YES MISS DIAMOND the 11 of this album

**akanewasright** (10): This is the best thing on the album and one of my favorite recordings ever. It’s a sort of sister song to Track 10 in my mind (they were released like two days apart), but where Track 10 feels like a hedonistic breakdown from beginning to end, this song has time to breathe at the beginning, which makes the tempo shift halfway through even more jarring, and even more broken. It’s brilliant. Hannah and AG did a phenomenal job.

**banananaise** (10): queen of having the third most famous recording of a song named concrete angel

**Carinm** (10): Love hearing the more abrasive instrumentals compared to the very slow and vibey ones in the rest of the album

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i got a boy is quaking with these transitions

**didney-worl** (10): a JOURNEY

**sarcasticsobs** (10): have heard 1000 versions of this song but i love it every time

**seanderlust** (10): gareth emery lowkey puts out nothing but bangers. shoutout to "sanctuary", the second best song named sanctuary

**steelstepladder** (10): Best song on the album full stop

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): This song honestly saves the album

**vayyiqra** (10): I bet Popheads is going to think this is the only really good song on this album because the second half is the most uptempo part of the whole album but whatever it slaps

**waluigiest** (10): I was ready to be mad, but the beat shift at the midway point is excellent

**kappyko** (9.5): botched pay off imo, would've been better off stealing a page from tielsie's palette

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): FINALLY something interesting here! I'm still not sold on the quieter intro/first half, it did make that drum machine hit that much harder, but it also mislead me into thinking we were about to go REAL hard for the rest of the track

**anothertown** (9): ohh so THIS is what she is trying to do.. ok bop!

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): oh thank god someone turned the bpm up. Also, bury me six feet deep.

**lightningcrying** (9): yes!!! more of this pls

**yatcho** (8.5): really into the way this song flips in the middle, was kind of going nowhere before that

**Palutzel** (8.3): maybe the only highlight of the album

**1998tweety** (8): this could be a 10 if the weird spoken bits and pauses were cut out.

**pat-rickstar** (8): Was the switchup about halfway through put there to wake up the people who fell asleep in Never Again

**pig-serpent** (8): Great pieces of a song, but it really doesn't flow and keeps ruining its momentum. The Appleville version fixes my issues and makes it the 10/10 it deserves to be. Even so, it sets the standard of what I want Hannah Diamond songs to climax to.

**skargardin** (8): banger

**mysario** (7.8): it's v nicely done but its tough to get one refrain to sound good for 5 minutes

**runaway3212** (7): It's really great except the last part

**Stryxen** (7): i actually liked this one but could not tell you why,,, i guess it’s kinda atmospheric

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I was not expecting a beat switch and I do like a good beat switch ... although the ending is too much for me sadly

**hikkaru** (6): there's good in this but tbh it takes too long to build up

**astrologicalangel** (4): this is fine but it didn't need to be 5 minutes long

DaHumanTorch: # Reflections

---

**Overall Average**: 7.566 **// Average Controversy:** 1.755

---

**plastichaxan** (9.340): Probably my fav of the 4 (well unless we count flamboyant without the deluxe tracks), she is so good, her music makes me feel things some other hyperpop girlies don't

**TiltControls** (9.200): Even though I've found out that hyperpop generally isn't exactly my thing, I'm glad I at least discovered this album through the rate

**banananaise** (9.100): if your fave isn't photoshopping her face into a moon, i don't wanna hear about it

**sarcasticsobs** (9.000): best record in the rate, only one without a dud. Impeccably produced, dreamily performed. Just crisp, clean, lovely all around. a joy

**vayyiqra** (8.800): This album is one of the hidden gems of last year. I found it because I was doing a radio show on PC music (I once had a radio show on pop music in the Before Time, and I miss it dearly) and was playing Hannah's singles and put it on as well because the cover was pretty. This is a case where the aesthetic fits the music perfectly, since it is both beautiful and a great "late-night chillout" album. Hearing this for the first time alone in the radio station at night was such a vibe and a fond memory of mine. I feel like Hannah's music is not upbeat enough to be Popheadscore and that's okay, but this album fits a niche where it just hits sometimes. It's adorable. I said the other day that it's the :uwu: emote in musical form, and I stand by that.

**twat\_brained** (8.500): the greatest Hannah not named Montana

**seanderlust** (7.970): it's very pretty! I think of the four albums featured here, I might not revisit this one as much as the other three, though there are definite standouts

**runaway3212** (7.900): A.G. Cook just can't do wrong in my eyes

**yatcho** (7.850): Hannah is probably gonna get smoked for having a lot of ballads in this rate but I'm glad she's here for some actual PC music representation. Her music is very pretty and almost too dainty for hyperpop but I really appreciate it

**bigbigbee** (7.600): I find this album extremely easy to listen to. I listened to a LOT of j-pop and vocaloid music during formative years and this reminds me of that a lot (e.g. Last Night Good Night by livetune). One quibble I have is her lyrics – they are so simple (subject, verb, object, end of sentence) that sometimes they’re jarring for me, especially since her diction is clear and she sings slowly. Someone in discord said it’s like she’s talking to a small child and I agree. However, her production and melodies (gorgeous!) are often interesting enough to mask this issue, and I do really like this album and will definitely go back to it!

**dragonsteel33** (7.410): 7.4 i really really enjoy this album it's my go-to emotional hyperpop and probably tied with 1000 gecs for my favorite on this list

**Palutzel** (7.240): it's a solid album but it's easily overshadowed by the others

**skargardin** (7.200): This was kinda average to me, nothing really stick with me apart from Love Goes On and Fade Away.

**pat-rickstar** (7.100): I just know most of this album is going day 1, and tbh some songs deserve to. However, I feel the quality increases quite a lot in the second half compared to the first, so I hope a few of those songs last.

**rickikardashian** (7.020): this all sounds like a very long song. a nice, cute song, but still, just one very long song

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.000): Y'all set this girl up by putting her against three high-energy albums.

**kappyko** (6.950): one amazing song and some great other songs but not the best

**pig-serpent** (6.950): This album taking forever to come out and the minimalist sensibilities and anticlimaxes on half the tracks paint the picture of an album that should be fantastic, but can only claw at tuffs of greatness from time to time.

**lightningcrying** (6.800): has a very cute sound and hannah's voice is very cute, but that's it i guess. the whole album gave me jigglypuff vibes, which is not really my thing but i can see someone else enjoying it a lot.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.750): Honestly, this whole album feels like generic YouTube stock music from 2012, and not in a great way. The second half definitely picks up, but I still don't find it to be a particularly memorable experience, and honestly half of that is from Hannah's vocal delivery, it just feels really stilted and over-emphasised, it's like a preschool teacher reading a storybook

**Stryxen** (6.550): someone take her fucking keyboard away from her, she keeps making the same song

**steelstepladder** (6.500): I don't hate any of the songs on this album but these songs blur together like a mf

**Carinm** (6.450): Some of these songs sound exactly the same, I had trouble telling the difference between a few of them while listening

**waluigiest** (6.400): I get that Hannah Diamond is important for hyperpop but this was boring

**CreepyMannequin** (5.350): Man it was hard to distinguish songs on this album

**anothertown** (5.350): this album is what happens if you put the modern history of feminine gender performance through a failing AI

**tearsinvegas** (5.290): I also feel like the remixes of this album were stronger than the actual album. I guess I just don’t fw Hannah diamond. Kinda boring.

**frogaranaman** (4.300): idk she’s just a little boring

#Miss Songeniality: Dorian Electra - Adam & Steve

=====

akanewasright: WAIT REALLY? CONCRETE ANGEL WON? 

THIS IS THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME
[/r/popheads/comments/kh0bpq/2019_hyperpop_rate_day_3_oh_me_oh_my/ggis09w/]

=====

DaHumanTorch: Thanks so much everyone for participating and joining me for the reveal!! I had so much fun hosting one of the messiest rates ever
[/r/popheads/comments/kh0bpq/2019_hyperpop_rate_day_3_oh_me_oh_my/ggis2t8/]

Carinm: This rate was a rollercoaster <3

MrSwearword: Congratulations on a successful rate <3

TragicKingdom1: [updated](https://pastebin.com/V13QEFjq)

thank you to quenched for successfully hosting such a messy rate!! now i need to restart my laptop because dorian electra destroyed its audio drivers

=====

skargardin: this top ten was so insanely chaotic, which is fitting for a hyperpop rate I suppose ☠️
[/r/popheads/comments/kh0bpq/2019_hyperpop_rate_day_3_oh_me_oh_my/ggisgyr/]

=====

Carinm: This rate defied all of my expections, hannah didn't get bodied, Dorian didn't sweep, People liked gecs, Slayyyter was first out, cha ching out day 1, what a rollercoaster
[/r/popheads/comments/kh0bpq/2019_hyperpop_rate_day_3_oh_me_oh_my/ggiswgm/]

=====

yatcho: These results were chaotic all the way through but I'm happy with the winner. Thanks for hosting!

TiltControls: [Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1863576184) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) updated! (although not many leaderboard changes this time around)

**SONGS**

Concrete Angel squeaks into the Top 500 ratings at #498. It may be lower than most winners, but it got my 11 so idc.

Also Emily Montes takes at least 3 spots on the top 100 most controversial list with Brand New, Roblox is My Life, and Emily from the West. 800db cloud also enters at spot #99, where it is tied with Toto's Africa.

**ARTISTS**

Slayyyter (#103/236), gecs (#106), Hannah (#110), and Dorian (#154) all take spots on the artist list! 

(If we counted bonus songs Emily Montes would have the highest artist rating of the rate AND the 4th highest controversy of all time. We stan a legend)
  
Thank you immensely to quenched for a great (although with chaotic placements) rate!

1998tweety: I was not expecting Hannah to win the rate but thank God gecs didn't.

cloudbustingmp3: well this might’ve been the most unpredictable rate in like... forever

seanderlust: [DaHumanTorch watching me comment with 100% certainty that Hannah and 100 gecs were going to mostly go out day one](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/daenerys-targaryen-meme-1556127294.png?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.354xw,0&resize=480:*)

pig-serpent: Despite the absolute robberies of 800db Cloud, E-Boy, Daddy AF, and Musical Genius as well as Money Machine just missing the top 5, this is probably the most okay I've been with the results of a popheads rate I followed.  Very good top 5, solid top 10, and I'm happy to see Concrete Angel win.
[/r/popheads/comments/kh0bpq/2019_hyperpop_rate_day_3_oh_me_oh_my/ggj5u87/]

=====

DaHumanTorch: i’m happy at least someone is relatively happy with the results
[/r/popheads/comments/kh0bpq/2019_hyperpop_rate_day_3_oh_me_oh_my/ggj5x4q/]

=====

pig-serpent: I think I must have veeeeerrrrry low standards.
[/r/popheads/comments/kh0bpq/2019_hyperpop_rate_day_3_oh_me_oh_my/ggj79uq/]

=====

shekeepsreceipts: in retrospect playing an actual 90's house anthem in plug before the reveal and getting mehs and comments about having an attention span shorter than 6 minutes was a bad omen for miss slayyyter
