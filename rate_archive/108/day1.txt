https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kfr9wk/2019_hyperpop_rate_reveal_day_1_our_results_are/

Hi everyone, welcome to Day 1 of the 2019 Hyperpop Rate Reveal!! Today I will be revealing **#49-#34** of the main rate and **#17-#12** of the bonus rate. The reveal will begin at 3 EST (or one hour after this is posted). Be sure to join [plug.dj](https://plug.dj/popheads) and follow the results live! We will be relistening to the songs as they go out along with other handpicked bops by yours truly (some of which will be by other hyperpop artists I think deserve some recognition in addition to this rate!)

Some stats:
* There were [80](https://pastebin.com/csCU6GNX) of you who participated - that's more people than there are gecs in gecgecgec so good job!
* The average score was 7.429
* The average controversy score was 1.917 (any song with a score higher than this should be considered controversial)

I'm not shocked this got last place, considering it's just a minute of Laura and Dylan having a manic episode with the tools in their garage. It was too much for most of you, serving 𝓮𝓻𝓻𝓸𝓻 𝓭𝓸𝓮𝓼 𝓷𝓸𝓽 𝓬𝓸𝓶𝓹𝓾𝓽𝓮. I still like it a lot though, it's a lot of fun. Also it's iconic how another song in this rate (Musical Genius) samples it. *insert joke about it sounding like Ross Geller and his keyboard*

---

**bbfan132** (10): not entirely sure what i just listened to but i loved it lol

**kappyko** (10): YASS SWEET POTATO FRIES YASSSS

**RandomHypnotica** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP9y7F_rzzo

**rickikardashian** (10): i’ve been learning production for the past few months………. i feel seen

**Stryxen** (10): it’s funny

**anothertown** (9.5): What else would you expect from a 100 Gecs Interlude

**waluigiest** (9): this shit is so funny

**RandomDKguy** (8): they did more ringtones and unique sounds that the entire Justin Bieber album

**runaway3212** (8): relatable

**banananaise** (7.5): okay i kind of like this one if only because it reminds me of James Ferraro which i am all for

**twat\_brained** (7.2): my 28 personalities at 1:43 am

**Carinm** (7): I would never listen to it outside of the album but its fine in context

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): me emailing the counseling office at my university

**didney-worl** (7): same

**Palutzel** (6.9): how do you even rate this

**CreepyMannequin** (6): bonus point for being the shortest song on the album

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): They should have evolved elements of this into separate tracks, they would have been fire tbh.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this is literally video game music on drugs but I can dig it

**plastichaxan** (6): can’t wait for this to be last on the rate and i complain about it even if i'm giving it a 6

**sandyfishnets** (6): i swear i heard 'i need head immediately' rip

**dragonsteel33** (5.5): me too

**yatcho** (5.5): uhm, chile... anyway so

**ktajlili** (5): I've never seen the point of interludes

**lightningcrying** (5): its fun, but its just segments strung together, not the best moment in the album

**maxrocks329** (5): I get why they skipped this for the remix album but honestly the MIDI saxophone(?) slaps

**mayolizard** (5): girl I'm not a therapist sorry </3

**pig-serpent** (5): At the very least I'm happy this exists.

**InfernalSolstice** (4.5): this was probably the weirdest so far but it's also been the one i've hated the least so far somehow

**skargardin** (4): at least this is short and somewhat tolerable but it also leaves no impression on me so

**akanewasright** (3): This is going to go out early, if not first. I really like it, but also... it’s one of the less song-y songs in the rate. I don’t feel sad thinking about it leaving

**pat-rickstar** (3): After I THINK won the Pollen rate I noticed all of my 11 winners so far start with "I." This is NOT my 11 so therefore it's not going to win

**seanderlust** (2.9): one day someone asked themselves, "hmm.. I wonder if the chaos and mania of an episode of The Eric Andre Show could translate into a three-minute song in a coherent way?" today we found out: no.

**bigbigbee** (2): (RuPaul voice from the John Waters episode) deeply, deeply disturbing!

**frogaranaman** (1): the Ed Sheeran of art school music

**sarcasticsobs** (1): i don’t believe them when they try and say this isn’t trying to be ironic or some other nonsense

**1998tweety** (0): this is so disjointed, it's not even the worst song on the album but WOW they were really messy around here huh

**astrologicalangel** (0): what? What? WHAT?

**steelstepladder** (0): Yeah... you do

**TiltControls** (0): I feel like this is just a collection of sounds taken from various PS1 games and baby monitor audio

**vayyiqra** (0): Not even a song, just some pointless noodling; it's awful. This sounds like me and my brothers fucking around with my dad's Casio synth as kids and randomly mashing keys and thinking it's funny

This is literally a Walmart Live By the Sword, though it's still a banger. Dorian said gay rights but make it medieval! 

---

**bbfan132** (8): banger alert

**yatcho** (8): Another song where the production stands out a lot more than whatever Dorian is saying

**twat\_brained** (7): omg imagine if Under Armour sponsors Dorian's tour just for this song lol

**vayyiqra** (7): Why does the intro to this sound like a meme song; and how has Dorian's music not been memed yet anyway it seems perfect for that

**waluigiest** (7): I love the flute, but the rest is pretty standard at this point of the album

**seanderlust** (6.6): i love the drama in this one. the tension between dorian and the subject is palpable

**runaway3212** (6.5): A wose Live By The Sword

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Not bad but you can see why this wasn't on the main album

**1998tweety** (6): kind of forgettable and just ok

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): The deluxe tracks are definitely some of the weakest

**mayolizard** (5): instrumental saved this

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): No

**pig-serpent** (4): This is on the more standard side of their songs, and it's kinda boring too.

**rickikardashian** (3): im tired

**astrologicalangel** (2): ftom the title I was expecting an emotional ballad tbh. Don't know what that would have sounded like but I would have preferred it to this

In this song, Emily also seems to insert herself into the historically bloody East vs. West debate. She, of course, decided to ally with the West. Or perhaps it is a commentary on how some Western countries, mainly America, have a broken system of healthcare, education, etc. Emily truly leaves it up to the listener's interpretation which I think lends to the short-lived power this song holds. However, when every song you release is a masterpiece, one is forced to get last and unfortunately this one had to take that spot.

---

**frogaranaman** (10): this album is perfection

**RandomDKguy** (10): east is bettr

**static\_int\_husp** (10): queen of the west

**Stryxen** (10): cowboy like me yeehaw

**TiltControls** (10): emily from the west 303 in the house!!

**RandomHypnotica** (8): Emily has an incredibly profound understanding of the effect that the geographical area you live in, or come from can have on one's life, even if it's just a different area of the city, such as in this case, the West

**banananaise** (7): a haunting interlude... this album is a work of art

**mayolizard** (7): red dead redemption who

**vayyiqra** (6): hard

**waluigiest** (5): 3 oh 3???

**seanderlust** (3.8): emily re-igniting the east coast/west coast beef. I can't in good conscience give this a high score :(

**skargardin** (3): im crying at how bad the transitions are

**TragicKingdom1** (3): kinda meh

**bbfan132** (2): idk what this is

**1998tweety** (1): shes getting sloppy and it shows

**akanewasright** (10): My favorite song on the record by far. I love the entire intro so much, but it’s the big chorus that steals the show for me. It’s one of the best moments on the record. I like how clean the vocals were on the remix, but the entire song is really, really good.

**steelstepladder** (10): gecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec

**hunnybee12** (9): gecgeggecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec

**RandomHypnotica** (9): gec

**runaway3212** (9): This is weirdly beautiful in a place where you wouldn't expect it

**bbfan132** (8.5): really enjoying these random sound collages

**engifear** (8): gecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec

**kappyko** (8): YASS SWEET POTATO FRIES YASSSS (oh this is an actual song)

**pig-serpent** (8): It's very easy to forget about this song because of how great the rest of the album is, but man it's still great.

**plastichaxan** (8): this may be a common one but gecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec

**twat\_brained** (8): ...how do they come up with this music?

**lightningcrying** (7.5): just found out its not "gec once again" :( anyways, this is an extremely fun song, such a journey

**Palutzel** (7.5): wtf it's good for some reason

**yatcho** (7.5): 😏

**waluigiest** (7): gecgecgecgecgec

**TiltControls** (6.5): also just a variation of noises, but at least the highs of this song at least make me more willing to tolerate the rough parts. Oddly enough I actually liked the gecgecgec section

**bigbigbee** (6): This is like a modern version of Peking Opera performing the Monkey King story!

**ignitethephoenix** (6): how many comments will be gecgecgec ?

**Stryxen** (6): gecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.4): my brain loading like

**tearsinvegas** (5.1): not as good was I need help immediately

**mayolizard** (5): okkkkk

**pat-rickstar** (5): How am I meant to rate a song a third of which is the word gec repeated over and over

**rickikardashian** (5): this classifies as a comedy track ~~ i would have given this a 10 but then they decided to turn this into a bad song in the middle so i cant even give it a sort of ironic perfect score~~

**sarcasticsobs** (4): fuck the 1st half of this

**Carinm** (3): obviously its a meme but I just don't like how it sounds, even once the actual vocals come in I don't really enjoy the song. The wobbly sound once the vocals come in also actually gives me a headache lol.

**skargardin** (3): anyways

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): Ma'ma this is garbage, except for those 8 seconds starting at 1:04.

**seanderlust** (1.8): .....did anyone else try the chicken? I thought the chicken was lovely.

**1998tweety** (1): you know you don't have to put this on your album, you can just leave it off

**vayyiqra** (1): The "gecgecgecgec" memey part is kind of funny but the rest sucks. It's experimental, sure, but not all experiments are a success

Dorian took one of the highlights of the standard edition of Flamboyant but made it....country? It sort of works but also is one of the weakest tracks on the album

**mysario** (10): the YEEHAW sold me

**notceitn** (10): YEEHAW

**Seedub192** (9.5): How did i live before hearing this godly yeehaw??

**bbfan132** (8): feels like the same song as the main version lol

**runaway3212** (8): Pretty decent, but def worse than the original

**steelstepladder** (8): If Guyliner was so good why isn't there a Guyli- Oh look at that there is

**astrologicalangel** (7): yeehaw indeed

**pig-serpent** (7): This one is pretty standard but also pretty good.

**yatcho** (6.5): The random country influence??? Definitely feels like scrapped ideas from the original

**lightningcrying** (6): gained 1(one) point for saying yeehaw but that post-chorus is so bad i had to deduct it again

**vayyiqra** (6): Guyliner [trap remix] is not needed but it still vibes

**dragonsteel33** (5.7): i feel like if you're gonna do a reprise you have to make it worth it and i just don't feel like they made this distinguished enough from guyliner idk

**1998tweety** (5.5): i find this annoying

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Why

**LesApfels** (5): Guyliner was already perfect I really don't think this was necessary

**Stryxen** (5): I hate hate HATE your hair and makeup today

To close out her debut album, Slayyyter reworked her song Ghost (a 10). This reworked version is definitely not as good and I think she should've just put the already released Ghost on the album. The two extra t's in the title were for how much the quality dropped 😍

---

**bbfan132** (10): i love how the ending to this bombastic album is so sensual and atmospheric… excellent ending

**vayyiqra** (10): The ambient breakdown part is one of the best parts of this album so why doesn't anyone talk about this song

**akanewasright** (9): I actually really like this version of the song. I think it’s a little controversial among fans, but it was the only song I liked in the back half of the album for a while

**seanderlust** (8.5): "go fuck your boring girls cause you can't handle me" WHEW what a line. I like this as a closer. emotional but also still kind of a bop.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Good enough.

**Carinm** (7): Like having a vibey track to end the album.

**mayolizard** (7): u were just a ghaoast to maaaaahhhhhheeeeeeee

**RandomDKguy** (7): ghostbusters who

**1998tweety** (6.5): im not a huge fan of this, feels kind of unnecessary, super repetitive too

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): cute but kind of boring

**sandyfishnets** (6.5): kinda dissapointed with this album closer

**lightningcrying** (6): its alright... i wish the production went harder, as it is now its a bit too lowkey for an album closer imo

**pig-serpent** (6): I like that the more lowkey song adds variety to the album, but there's a reason there isn't more of it.

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): This kind of meh as a closer, wish it ended after Touch My Body

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): kind of a blah closer tho

**hunnybee12** (5): not every album needs a ballad closing track, i promise

**kappyko** (5): i get the appeal but nah

**Palutzel** (5): not the best album closer out there

**waluigiest** (5): yawn.....

**dragonsteel33** (4.8): wow catherine very clever ending your album with a song about getting ghosted

**runaway3212** (3): no

**skargardin** (3): bye

In just 15 short seconds, as many of you pointed out, Emily singlehandedly ended; the Sun, Madonna, Disney, Elsa, Anna, Klondike bars, Olaf, the Frozen soundtrack, and precipitation. Idina Menzel has two days to respond!

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the wordplay :fire:

**1998tweety** (7): cute lil bop

**bbfan132** (7): way better than the shitty movie

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): A different take for Emily, perhaps inspired by the prolific writing style of Kate Bush, using pre-existing media in another medium, in this case the 2013 film "Frozen". She's writing from the perspective of Elsa as a young child, she simply wants to play, but she is now aware of the dangers of her power, due to the near fatal accident that occured with Anna earlier that year. She's lamenting that she's only a child, and has to already grow up and be responsilble, ready for her coronation, with no time to play in the snow

**pat-rickstar** (6): ended elsa and anna

**ignitethephoenix** (5): fuck frozen!

**lightningcrying** (5): im worried for her, disney does not mess around with copyright infringement

**vayyiqra** (5): Do you want to build a snowman?

**plastichaxan** (4): all the references, she kinda genius

**skargardin** (1): deadbanana

I love how horny and campy the lyrics of this song are.

> You got a leak, I can stop it

> You got a hole, I can fill it

> You got a crack, let me seal it

> You need to screw

Literally Handy Manny put make it horny and about letting yourself be used.

---

**plastichaxan** (10): this is a mood

**waluigiest** (10): I think this is a bonus track, but it’s honestly the song that most captures the album essence to me. From the production and industrial sounds to the campy writing, it hits every note. “you gotta hole - I can fill it” is EVERYTHING.

**anothertown** (9.5): me going to the mechanic and not knowing what the hell anybodys talking about

**Stryxen** (9): oh they’re horny horny

**twat\_brained** (8.2): stan Tool

**Palutzel** (7.8): you can feel the transition to the deluxe version, not as strong as the original songs

**bbfan132** (7.5): enjoyable but kind of filler-y ngl

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Cute sentiment, I guess.

**runaway3212** (7): I get why this was left of the original

**dragonsteel33** (6.7): a bit repetitive but not bad

**seanderlust** (6.1): it's clever but it just doesn't quite hit the spot for me

**1998tweety** (6): erm

**akanewasright** (6): Cute, but kinda just... okay

**ktajlili** (6): I like this, but it feels kind like filler.

**pig-serpent** (6): The trap based groove makes this an easy song to bob along to but I don't think it has that much substance past that.

**vayyiqra** (6): These lyrics sure are something :face_with_raised_eyebrow:

**pat-rickstar** (5): Ok this is probably the first song on this album I don't care for

**yatcho** (5): A little disappointed by the production here, this is below what umru and ABsRDST have already output on this album. I get why this only made the deluxe

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): tool 4 you

**mayolizard** (4): i hate this concept actually just subtracting a point for being a mechanic concept this is just strange.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): eh

**hunnybee12** (3): i kinda hate this

**addupten** (2): ummm...boring...but also like the lyrics are so direct

**rickikardashian** (0): i can forgive this abrasive, loud production if it’s a good song, but the hooks in this just arent good and now im stuck listening to a bad song with a production i dont particularly like. i didnt enjoy a second of this

This is definitely me least favorite of the Dorian songs (justice for Under the Armor!!!). I usually like Dorian's vocals but in this song...it wasn't doing it for me. However, if this is the weakest song on the album, then they snapped because this isn't even bad. 

---

**runaway3212** (10): I don't get why this was left of the original

**twat\_brained** (8.9): this is Fade Away on bath salts sign me the fuck up for more of this

**bbfan132** (8.5): pleasant ending to the deluxe version

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): you know what this wouldnt usually be an 8 from me but the last like 5 songs on this album before this are... not quite for me so this sounds much better in comparison

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): This feels like it would belong exactly in the Billboard Top 100 2009. The end really fizzled though

**1998tweety** (7): this is nice but a drop would've really elevated it

**pig-serpent** (7): A bit slower and more dramatic, and I think it does the song well.

**plastichaxan** (7): my Dorian average was set up with the deluxe tracks (except for tool for you but anyways)

**waluigiest** (7): it’s pretty I guess

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I like the more simple generic production, somehow it’s refreshing after the rest of this but I will Dorian had more simple vocals

**LesApfels** (6.5): This church chorus vibe is really cool

**dragonsteel33** (6.3): it sounds like an outtake from slayyyter

**steelstepladder** (6): I see what they were going for but... This is not why I listen to Dorian Electra

**vayyiqra** (6): This is kind of a weak closer but it's alright for what it is

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Ugh

**hunnybee12** (5): i'm not really a fan of dorian's singing style and this is the worst offender

**lightningcrying** (5): i had to listen several times bc i kept forgetting what this song sounded like as soon as it finished

**yatcho** (5): Kind of living for the vaguely euro-dance parts of this. Doesn't really end up going anywhere though. The lyrics are like a Chainsmokers album cut

**mayolizard** (3): Not Good™️

**skargardin** (3): the deluxe tracks just go from mediocre to bad to me

**RandomHypnotica** (9): Covers have always been a bit divisive amongst critics, but that didn't stop Emily.

The fact that this samples the last place song in the rate doesn't make the low placement all too shocking. This "interlude" is a lot more fun than I Need Help Immediately and a lot more catchy and whimsical. Also they spilled with that title. Self awareness!

---

**anothertown** (10): It HITS

**Carinm** (10): Love, literally only complaint is that it is 2 minutes! this would by my 11 if it were literally any longer.

**notceitn** (10): was VERY tempted to give this my 11 ngl

**plastichaxan** (10): they are self aware cause Dorian is, in fact, a musical genius

**1998tweety** (4): i dont know about that

This is probably the straightest song in the rate. It is also, my lowest scored. It was SUCH a banger for the majority of it but that screamo nu-metal outro (whatever that was :skull:) totally killed the momentum the song had. It just becomes unlistenable, especially after the amazing first half.

---

**addupten** (11): THIS GOES HARD

**Palutzel** (11): 100 gecs will have to pay for my hearing aids in a few years, absolutely worth it

**pig-serpent** (11): Every moment of this song is iconic, but I think the meloncholy guitar riff at the beginning of the song is an underrated iconic moment.

**tectec787** (11): one of my favorite songs in a long time. live version slaps even harder somehow.

**bbfan132** (10): best banger ever

**kappyko** (10): the most emotionally affecting song in the rate

**runaway3212** (10): Everything just comes together perfectly

**Seedub192** (9.5): I wish i owned a car so i could crash it listening to this

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): bold and brash

**dragonsteel33** (9): best song on the album methinks really interesting combination of emotional vulnerability and the acoustic equivalent of ketamine

**ktajlili** (9): With staccato instrumentals overpowering distorted vocals, the song climaxes into a 30 second long screaming bridge. It doesn't make sense, but is it supposed to?

**anothertown** (8): “I might go and throw my phone into the lake yeah” – Zoey 101, Spring Break-Up (2006)

**awhile2** (8): one of my favorite college memories is associated with this song. Don’t know what that says about me as a person but it can’t be good

**mayolizard** (8): womp womp womp... womp womp womp... yeahahahhh.... yeahahahhhhh....

**RandomDKguy** (8): gec

**tearsinvegas** (8): yes

**waluigiest** (8): the intro to this song is GORGEOUS and part of me wishes it was the whole song. But the yelling is kinda hype

**steelstepladder** (7.5): That's a heavy cloud

**Stryxen** (7): what is wrong with me

**lightningcrying** (6.8): lmao i keep forgetting that the outro sounds like that, love it

**twat\_brained** (6.5): was great until the end when the five nights at Freddy's minigame voice came in

**1998tweety** (6): this isn't awful tbh, i mean i dont like it but i can at least see why someone would like it

**rickikardashian** (5.5): the first half of this song seems like a good song that i can't enjoy because it sounds like it’s being played on a 5 dollar supermaket speaker

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): The lake line is somehow funny as fuck to me, but the rest is... a mess.

**Carinm** (4): Kinda just boring compared to the rest of the album

**TiltControls** (3): the end sounds like a burping 10 year old is trying to talk to me using a broken walkie-talkie on the moon

**vayyiqra** (1): This is obnoxious + that snare drum sounds like shit tune it please + that breakdown at the end is unbearable

**hikkaru** (0): hate the vocals ❤️

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this song is just unlistenable after the first 30s and the other low key part it’s just noise. I have it on lowest volume right now and it’s still too high

**InfernalSolstice** (0): there is genuinely not a single thing i enjoy about this

**pat-rickstar** (0): Sorry I hate this

**RandomHypnotica** (0): haha get it weed hahaha. I know gecs brand is kinda obnoxious is the point, but this just seems particularly so

pig-serpent: Genuinely shocked to see this gone, but in hindsight I guess I should've seen it coming after all the metal songs in the 90s rate were murdered early on.  
Also what's considered an overall high controversy score, because 2.9 seems really high?

Hyperpop is generally known to be super loud, never boring, and super danceable. This song is none of those things, and is instead a quite beautiful and chill opener. I definitely think this deserved better though am not surprised some found it zzzzz.

---

**runaway3212** (10): If PC Music made a sleep lullaby

**TiltControls** (10): I love how chill this track is

**addupten** (8.5): I adore that outro!

**banananaise** (8.5): honestly a perfect opener for a HD album - alien but familiar, melancholy but beautiful

**notceitn** (8): beautiful

**steelstepladder** (8): Cute lil intro song

**seanderlust** (7.9): it's a little slow to open the album with, but it's not bad. I really like the low harmonies in the second verse

**twat\_brained** (7.6): wait this isn't still gecgecgec is it?

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): very beautiful

**dragonsteel33** (7): very cute it reminds me of my bf lmao

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Sweet.

**rickikardashian** (7): is this a loona ballad

**vayyiqra** (7): Cute :uwu: what a nice intro

**yatcho** (7): Cute as an intro but not really worthy of title track

**bbfan132** (6.5): really wish i could give this a higher score but it doesn’t go anywhere - feels just like a hint of what is to come

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The synths have very neat and dreamy textures to them, but the song doesn't feel like it goes anywhere.

**1998tweety** (6): an alright opener

**Palutzel** (6): meh

**skargardin** (6): as an opener it's fine i suppose

**Stryxen** (6): if the super mario galaxy soundtrack was made in tomodachi life

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): I like elements here, but it feels so incredibly minimal to the point it’s distracting how empty it is

**mayolizard** (5): i don't have a lot of thoughts

**Carinm** (3): Very boring to me

**ignitethephoenix** (3): this boring and also I hate it when people do vocal effects unnecessarily in emotional songs

**akanewasright** (2): I like this song fine, but it’s not really good for anything besides an intro to the album. I adore the rest of the album, and this is not on that level. I like the outro, but the song feels like a jumble of cute ideas instead of a full song. I gave this song a higher score originally but then realized that I would be okay with this song going out first and lowered the score accordingly

**TiltControls** (10): Emily Montes really just said gamer rights huh

**Stryxen** (8): hmm ok interlude i see what ur doing

**akanewasright** (7): The only acceptable gamer

**RandomHypnotica** (7): On this track, Emily explores the crippling and underrepresented threat that is video game addiciton. Roblox has become such a core part of her life, her identity, her routine that without it she feels empty, and the covid crisis has only heightened the stakes, as she plays all day and night, since there are no other responsibilities for her to take part in. Hopefully this doesn't end up becoming an ominiously prophetic track of her eventual downfall.

**seanderlust** (5.4): can't relate; not old enough to play roblox; parents wont let me :(

**vayyiqra** (5): Ava Max

**lightningcrying** (3): bc i know nothing about roblox and i dont want to learn

**skargardin** (3): crying

**TragicKingdom1** (1): roblox who? minecraft ended ha

I was VERY surprised this placed this low. It's so catchy and fun, despite them pronouncing "like" weirdly (is it just me???). Definitely the inferior if the two Daddy songs in the rate however.

---

**akanewasright** (11): I love you, Bonnie McKee (and Dylan Brady, and Dorian)

**sandyfishnets** (11): i got into this song after watching the 4 producers flipping the same sample video and have since then been obsessed https://youtu.be/j4sx0VFbwHU

**steelstepladder** (10): Ah my first Dorian Electra song... Could they be any more iconic

**seanderlust** (9.6): dorian wrote this with the help of dylan brady and bonnie mckee?? no wonder I like this so much. you could say......daddy like. (shudder)

**awhile2** (9): god dorians vocal inflections on this hook give me so much life

**ktajlili** (9): Though not as irrevant as Flamboyant and Man to Man, "Daddy Like" is just as fun.

**notceitn** (9): I forgot how much I loved this song tbh

**RandomDKguy** (9): king of daddy songs (slayyyter is queen)

**vayyiqra** (9): "Daddy as fuck, I feel daddy as fuck" said Dorian, and it was almost as much of a bop as Slayyyter's song was

**bbfan132** (8.5): kind of repetitive but still super fun

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): This is kind of tame for a Dorian song but still, it’s a bop

**twat\_brained** (8.3): well damn so do I

**anothertown** (8): These moments where masculinity devolves into nonsense are some of my favorite on the album

**skargardin** (8): my hatred for the word daddy knows no end but this is a bop all the same

**Stryxen** (8): i like :)

**lightningcrying** (7): the way they sing the chorus is kinda annoying ngl. i absolutely HATED it the first time i heard it, but it really grew on me

**mayolizard** (7): I love this instrumental but what the FUCK are they singing about? this is so confusing? "one. ringadingding." WTF DOES THIS MEAN

**pig-serpent** (7): The hook is a little grating but the synth work on this song is really good.

**runaway3212** (7): I never really got the hype arround this one

**yatcho** (7): this song has always made me feel uncomfy and i can't exactly unpack why. The production is great though

**Palutzel** (6.8): daddy doesn't like that much

**1998tweety** (6): im not sure if i like this or not tbh

**waluigiest** (6): I live for how they say “rent check sent” but the rest is pretty eh

**maxrocks329** (4): The only skip on an otherwise perfect album

**frogaranaman** (3): this album progressively gets worse every song

**kappyko** (3): bruh moment

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): i dont

**ignitethephoenix** (2): not horny enough for this. Also this went on for way longer than I liked

**Carinm** (0): Only track I don't like on this album, super annoying repetition, everything is just forgettable

I'm trying to write a comment right now and I can't think of anything....and I think that says a lot about this song. It's just forgettable compared to the rest of the album. I love the lyrics though!

---

**\_lozzol** (11): we stan a 3/4 bop

**banananaise** (10): a true anthem! THERE'S NO POINT THERE'S NO TIME MAYBE YOU'LL TREAT HER RIGHT

**plastichaxan** (10): the way i have actually cried to this...powerful yup

**Carinm** (9.5): I like the louder instrumental compared to the rest of the album

**yatcho** (9.5): sadgirl Hannah is best Hannah

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): THERE'S NO POINT THERE'S NO TIME MAYBE YOU'LL TREAT HER RIGHT SJBFHSAKHFBKSAFBHJSA

**akanewasright** (8.5): Another stellar Hannah song. I honestly think that it’s a great addition to the Soon You Won’t See Me At All track order here. It was a great single, and it works great in the album.

**seanderlust** (8.2): through this album, it's interesting to watch a creeping post-breakup growth that the lyrics display.

**bbfan132** (8): i enjoyed this quite a bit but it felt like it was going somewhere that it didn’t reach

**vayyiqra** (8): This album is samey I admit but whatever this song is a vibe and it's so soothing

**pig-serpent** (7): Pretty much the typical Hannah Diamond song. It's catchy and has a lot of neat sound design, but it's minimal enough to feel like the song was rendered with half the tracks muted and it putters out at the end.

**rickikardashian** (7): i have no clue if she's australian or if she's just a *bananis and avocaidos* signer but I like it

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is ok

**dragonsteel33** (6.5): i like this one a bit but it doesn't quite move at a fast enough pace for me. not that slow songs are bad but that i still want them to kinda have a trajectory to them

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I kinda don't remember this.

**runaway3212** (6): It's not bad but this really feels like an A.G. Cook song with Hannah Diamonds vocals.

**lightningcrying** (5): i wish there was more personality to her voice on this one, bc it doesnt really work as it is now

**steelstepladder** (5): I sleep

**ktajlili** (4): tedious, boring song

**mayolizard** (4): yas sing in the exact same pitch and inflection the entire song queen

**RandomHypnotica** (3): this is truly boring

This is the song where Emily went full on hyperpop. The production could easily fit on a 100 gecs deep cut and is a fantastic intro to her EP. It scored higher than Musical Genius and I Need Help Immediately sooooooo

---

**engifear** (10): me when i got Ableton Live Lite for free with my Focusrite and wanted to try and make beats

**maxrocks329** (10): Wait this actually sounds like something Vektroid would make

**mayolizard** (10): why is it actually good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Ms. Montes has a BUDGET now! QUEEN! Clearly having been inspired by some of the other entrants in this very rate (the 100 gecs influence is clear, but it's not an outright ripoff). It's impressively bold for her to open the album with a purely instrumental track, but I think it works exceptionally well

**static\_int\_husp** (10): queen of piano

**Stryxen** (10): i actually like this i'm not even joking help

**TiltControls** (10): is this chromatica

**TragicKingdom1** (10): the way this could legitimately be a 100 gecs interlude

I love the irony of this song. She knows she isn't actually that famous among anyone who isn't a member of the alphabet mafia, but that's part of what makes this song so fun. It sounds straight out of The Fame, as one of you pointed out. I only dream of having this level of confidence and delusion!

---

**banananaise** (10): love singing this while unemployed and never going outside, big 'middle aged spinster in a movie telling herself she's young and beautiful while mascara dramatically runs down her face with her tears' energy

**notceitn** (10): pop perfection

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Woah this is a total bop

**runaway3212** (9.5): She really shows how she can be unique here

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): remember when the twitter cigarettes thought they were clever making fun of the tongue in cheek "they play me on the radio" lyric? this is why i still listen to azealia she was right

**kappyko** (9): No they don't

**vayyiqra** (9): A dumb ironic bop

**1998tweety** (8): this is kind of nice tbh but I feel like it could've been a highlight of the album with a bit more work into it.

**bbfan132** (8): i like the fame-esque sound of this song, feels like i’m in a nightclub in 2008

**maxrocks329** (8): This plays in my head every time I get more than 3 likes on Instagram

**skargardin** (8): the "im a celebrity" hook is so empty but the rest absolutely slaps

**LesApfels** (7.5): "Blowing all my money right up my nose" is so iconic

**mayolizard** (7.5): you are not a celebrity but its ok bb we love a fantasy <3

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): chorus chorus chorus

**seanderlust** (7.3): okay, sonically this is mid-tier but this is so specific to 2007 celebrity culture that it gets bonus points. like, i'm never listening to this song on purpose after this rate, but this is VERY britney-paris-lindsay friendship.

**pig-serpent** (7): Pretty basic but I can vibe to this.

**rickikardashian** (6.8): hyper-tiktok by kesha

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I don't remember this already.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): “I’m a furry, don’t touch me” I swear I heard that at the beginning

**Carinm** (4): just kinda boring

**akanewasright** (3): I think this song is fine honestly, but I think it’s the weakest on the album. It’s inoffensive, but it’s the song that I will skip more than half of the time

**anothertown** (2): there’s manifesting, and then there’s this

**lightningcrying** (0): really, really annoying. the lyrics sound like a parody of the rest of the album

This was so robbed!! The lyrics crush me with the brutal honesty and simplicity of them. Invented robotic *bleep bloop* sad bopping

---

**bbfan132** (10): i love her simple yet crushingly honest lyrics, i really felt this

**banananaise** (8.5): anthem for the sad girl winter of the year 3000

**akanewasright** (8): Soon I Won’t See You At All is one of the best things to come out of PC Music, and I’m so happy it’s preserved basically in its entirety right here.

This is the only song on Emily's debut album to last over 30 seconds, clocking in at around a minute. She uses this extra time to really demonstrate her emotion and depression in this experimental ballad. It's so atmospheric and a perfect encapsulation of 2020. One to have on repeat all year long

---

**frogaranaman** (10): this album is perfection

**moooo566** (10): big mood

**plastichaxan** (10): one to cry with

**static\_int\_husp** (10): queen of ballads

**Stryxen** (10): this literally sounds like something kanye would make but good

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): One of the hardest parts of the coronavirus pandemic has been the restrictions on travel, and the stay at home orders. With the longest track by some margin so far at around 59 seconds, Emily conveys the feelings of being trapped and isolated, both socially and physically, and the effects it has on both our mental and physical health.

**pat-rickstar** (9): yup finally a song long enough to count as a scrobble on last.fm

**bbfan132** (8.5): a mood

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): meh she flopped here but the beat is fire

**banananaise** (8): when i was like 10 or something i made up a song that i sang to myself at night about how i wished i could just go away from my family so this 5 year old's one-minute song is weirdly relatable

**mayolizard** (8): not the kidnapper anthem... girl

**waluigiest** (8): this is Billie Eilish

**TragicKingdom1** (6): atmospheric but too long smh

**seanderlust** (5.2): a nod to the opening track of avril lavigne's second album "under my skin"

**1998tweety** (5): is emily tierra wack? cause she tanks on longer songs huh

**vayyiqra** (4): TAKE ME AWAY (TAKE ME AWAY) A SECRET PLACE (A SECRET PLACE) A SWEET ESCAPE

**skargardin** (1): take me away from this album yes

**TiltControls** (1): dua lipa 2020

This is the biggest robbery in the entire rate and you cannot convince me otherwise. I had no idea people didn't like this song. It's my favorite on the album and my third favorite song in the rate!! Her flow is so infectious and I love how the song slowly ramps up until that explosive final chorus. Cha Ching is literally laced with crack, it just does not get old. I hope we get more songs like this on S2

---

**RandomHypnotica** (11): ok this SLAPS the flow is so good, it's bratty in all the right ways, just amazing

**anothertown** (10): I still don’t know whether or not this song is good but I’m giving it a ten regardless

**hikkaru** (10): this reminds me of old kesha and I love that

**kappyko** (10): literally an m.i.a. song

**notceitn** (10): bop

**plastichaxan** (10): brain scratch

**akanewasright** (9): This is one of my favorite Slayyyter rap-like songs.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): white girl rapping done RIGHT

**Palutzel** (9): i feel like a whore and i love it

**runaway3212** (9): This song shouldn't work but it does

**seanderlust** (9): not her calling out the boy waiting for his uber :skull:

**vayyiqra** (9): Why do I feel like "cha ching" is a metaphor :eyes:

**bbfan132** (7.5): this production kind of gives me a headache but it’s still fun to listen to

**pat-rickstar** (7): She sounds so similar to Britney at the start

**pig-serpent** (7): This song is a lot like Candy, but good.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): the beginning is me when I have bad gas

**lightningcrying** (6.8): catchy but also kinda annoying

**twat\_brained** (6): stop reminding me i have spending issues cathy

**mayolizard** (5.5): soobcry

**1998tweety** (5): this is a bit too abrasive for me

**banananaise** (5): cool girl drone cadence so threatening

**Carinm** (5): She sounds so bored

**steelstepladder** (5): Not a huge fan :/

**waluigiest** (5): the intro hurts my head omg

**rickikardashian** (4): hyper-gwen stefani

**skargardin** (4): this song really goes from bad to worse

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): JK Rowling's token East Asian character's name teas.

To round out Day 1, we have my least favorite song on the album. It still isn't a skip, but it definitely is lacking compared to the rest. The perfect word to describe it, as many of you used, is "cute".

---

**vayyiqra** (10): So cute I can't with this album

**yatcho** (8.7): I'm sorry but this is so cute

**seanderlust** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH0Qv8FJC2g

**1998tweety** (8): bops a fair bit

**bbfan132** (8): straightforward but relatable

**kappyko** (7): hey i'm shy

**runaway3212** (7): Pretty good

**rickikardashian** (6.5): do i actually think most songs in this song are a 6-7.5? or do they just sound the same and dk know how to rate this?

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): this is cute but 2shy by shura does this idea much better

**Stryxen** (6): this one’s just a little cutie lol

**ignitethephoenix** (5): somehow I forgot what this sounded like right after it ended ... never a good thing

**akanewasright** (4): Meh. I’ve never cared for this song much as a big fan of Hannah. I think the bridge is cute though. Score would have been higher, but I realized that this is one of my least favorites in the rate.

**pig-serpent** (4): Grating song. The only thing it's making me feel is annoyed. Even so, I don't want to call it a bad song.

**steelstepladder** (4): I wanna kick it like a lawnmower that wont start

Awkward_King: i didnt do the rate and i am hardly paying attention to the reveal so i have *no* right to complain but... cha ching going out is the most offensive thing i have seen all week that is disgusting, one of the top songs of the album it is infectious. the like can opening and breath sounds are amazing and her flow is awesome, this is so rude

anyway maybe it's a good thing i didn't pay attention to the reveal otherwise i may have cried when it went out lmao
