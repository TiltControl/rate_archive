Welcome to day 2 of the Dark Alt Pop Rate, featuring Poppy's I Disagree, Allie X's Cape God, and Grimes' Miss Anthropocene. We'll be starting up about an hour from when this is posted (so most likely we'll start at 4 PM EST)

Today we'll be revealing from #25-#13 (we're not swifties, we just like spooky stuff), which shouldn't take too long considering the decimation of long songs yesterday lmao.

I'll be updating you all in the thread while my cohost, the lovely and sinister u/Awkward_King manages the reveal in [the beatsense room.](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj#/) Trust me - you want to hop on in and enjoy the utter khaos that's about to happen.

But while you're having the time of your life in the beatsense room, keep looking at the thread for banners for each song, designed by king, featuring comments from some of you. Who knows, maybe you're on one.

**Awkward\_King** (10): This is just euphoria to me, idk how else to describe it but it's so light and airy and yet full and just feels like joy, I could honestly listen to it forever. For a seven minute song to, there's not a specific part I'd pick out as dragging on too long for me, it really doesn't feel like seven minutes.

**akanewasright** (9): I really, really wanted to be edgy and 0 this song to piss off some Grimes stans. When the rate got selected that was my plan. I never liked this song much, and Grimes is Grimes, so I was fully prepared to 0 this song… and then I listened to the album with King, his first time hearing it, and he… adored it. Seeing how much he loved the song made me realize “wait… maybe this song is good actually” and it’s only grown on me since. This song honestly got robbed a little, it deserved later day 2 at least. It’s just so lovely and bright.

---

#I adore you

**Brendon-Urine** (11): the kind of life affirming song that will always keep me coming back to Grimes. all of the beautiful pop writing from art angels mixed with hypnotic beats and bird sounds of all things come together to make an actual masterpiece of a song.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (11): This post-apocalypse lullaby by way of Kate Bush's Aerial (2005). It's made me feel comfort many times in the past and I choose to believe that this is a love song towards herself and her artistry

**grey/0x976** (11): ive never yassed so hard in my life

**stryxen** (11): this rate is not going to be a beautiful game after what you’re all gonna do to my poor 7 minute ballad baby

**bbfan132** (10): gorgeous closing track, idc who this is about lol

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (10): After a lot of doom and gloom, we get this bright, vibrant, poppy and pure love song. The ethereal vocals about how in love Grimes is (or was?) are really beautiful, and that driving beat is grand. I also love the background vocals that swirl around the main vocals, and the simplicity of main synths as well. Everything as a whole though works and this really is a beautiful epic track, and a wonderful closer to the album given how the entire album is thematically. Also, "You're so cool cause you don't think you're cool" is an adorable lyric.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Idorit

**nt96** (10): It's like I'm being wrapped around by a warm blanket with sailor moon patterns on it.

**sage** (10): this song is so underrated

**SFbby** (10): The beginning totally ripped off the Mariokart starting sound

**Vultuxe** (10): this song is monumental, it's like 4aem, has everything a grimes fan would enjoy

**wavingwolves** (10): this is actually the best song in this album when you think about it

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): even if the album is pretty flawed overall it has a really good closer, definitely the best song on the main album

**iniekcja\_** (9): "rare love song I actually enjoy" playlist staple

**Island715** (9): very cute song

**mudkip1** (9): here lies what's honestly biggest complaint on the album. i love it so much but it NEVER really delivers!! it gets SO close SO many times. it feels like the successor to realiti in so many ways but completely falls flat once the end of the track rolls around and you realize that the buildup led to nowhere productive. it's sooo beautiful though

**seaofblasphemy** (9): Oh this is gorgeous. Why did I ever hate this album?

**skargardin** (9): the chorus just hits

**TiltControls** (9): It's long, but I think it uses its run time really well (unlike a few of the other songs on the album)

**waluigiest** (9): okay it starts off so beautiful it’s got a contemporary björk feel to it imo

**xavieryes** (9): the beginning is mildly annoying but it gets great afterwards

**jman457** (8.6): Even though its over 7 minutes long it didnt drag really, Great way to end the album

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): why is the instrumental for this someone’s car alarm… wait why is this seven minutes long… wait why is it one of the best songs on the album???

**runaway3212** (8.3): Love how it sounds like she's coming out of the jungle into love

**hikkaru** (8): i don't rly listen to this much bc it's too long for my attention span but it's so nice :soblove:

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): love the positive message of this song after so many nihilistic songs

**static\_int\_husp** (8): *me understanding this song*: "beautiful game? she's talking about soccer right?"

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this probably isn't the right adjective but this song is pretty lol. it drags slightly at the end but tbh i didn't even notice how long it was till the last 30 seconds.

**throwaway7650** (8): starting this song off with a david attenborough interoperation omg? maybe this album really is about climate change... environmentalist QUEEN

**Vromega** (8): In an album full of "artificial sounds", I like the inclusion of the singing birds.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I love the lightness of this in contrast to most of what comes before it

**SamuelMashups** (7.5): Soft porn to my ears.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): this was pretty good unless near the end, then it tested my tolerance

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): Another track that feels unneccesarily long, and is hindered by that length.

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**AHSWeeknd** (7): this’ll probably be day one out because it’s seven minutes long

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): Nature sounds? Is Grimes walking with children in nature? Anyway, this song is fine. Kind of silly instrumentation that reminds me of old-school (like 80s) computer game music my dad used to play. But the chorus is super sweet.

**steelstepladder** (7): for the amount of days a week grimes eats a spaghetti meal

**Sundraliz** (7): :)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): What is up with all these long songs?!?! Like 7 minutes!!! I love the production!

#Idk can I throw it out the door

**UselessTacooo** (7): a good song that would benefit from being shorter. It’s cute in a good way, but it drags on way too long.

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): too boring to be that long

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I like the instrumental to this and the chorus but it really did not need to be 7 minutes long. Editing.

**duochromepalmtree** (6): this song really kept going and going and going. It sounds pretty? Good god why is it so long???

**ktajlili** (6): it goes on too long

**whoisValensi** (6): It has taken me too long to realize the title for this is just a mash of the words "I adore you", why am I so stupid???

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): it's cute but it gets very tedious

**babadork** (5): To long to have what sounds like an accordion car alarm in it

**frogaranaman** (5): synth sounds Boohbah-esque

**CrimsonROSET** (4): we spent the whole time in the listening party about this song talking about 😼 and i think that is more relevant

**BeauMeringue212** (1): I cringed at some of the lyrics here. And it's dull af why did this need to be 7 minutes. This really competed for my 0

**seanderlust** (0): that car alarm sound is not it. also this has no business being seven minutes long

akanewasright: #Grimes said that this song isn't about Elon, by the way... oops?

**plastichaxan** (10): i can rest easy now that i know this song isn’t about Elon whoever gave me that misinformation i hope you’re not having a nice day

**vayyiqra** (10): I just know I'm going to see at least one comment by someone who thinks this is a love song inspired by Elon Musk and I'm going to hate it. Anyway, that's not what this song is. It was inspired by some person yes, Grimes and Hana have said that, but I don't know who and also I feel it doesn't matter. Here is what it is really about: "It’s like if ‘Before the Fever’ is like the climax of the movie, then ‘IDORU’ is the end title. It’s such a negative energy to put in the world, but it’s good to finish with something hopeful so it’s not just like this mean album that doesn’t offer you anything." - Grimes. This is a happy song in which Grimes sings about loving life and seeing the good things about the world which is really needed after a whole album of doomer synthpop about the looming apocalypse, you know? It's beautiful and never feels like it's too long.

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): "You're so cool cuz you don't think you're cool" just makes me think of Elon Musk's ugly smiling mug floating in the heavens, vomit. one of Grimes' best ever productions, big and beautiful and swirling, and then she took a dump all over it with that

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8.5): Great song but I cant help but think that this song is about Elon :/

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): if you don’t perceive who it’s about (Elon definitely thinks he’s the coolest person in the world, don’t be fooled) this is really sweet and cute uwu

**imbaby122** (7.7): birdies!!!! this song is really sweet it shifts the mood of the album. and even though i dont think it needs to be 7 minutes long the 7 mins are filled up well. but minus one point bc it makes me think about how she dored elon musk.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): i knew this one isn’t about Elon because I can’t name a person less deserving of being told they’re cool due to not thinking they’re cool alive on the whole planet

**cremeebrulee** (2): i wish i could see what other grimes fans see in this because i really don't like this :| it drags for so long and the bird (???) sample is lowkey irritating. i think as a love song it falls flat lyrically and any redeeming qualities about it are kind of undone by the fact that it's about elon.

#barrelcat

**bulforster** (11): Oversharing time, strap in. So back in early 2020 I started dating a guy for the first time in a long time and it was going great. He was an exchange student from the states and most of my family is over there so we could relate to each other more than with most British people. I was meant to go back home for the spring vacation and he was meant to go travelling in Europe but since the COVID situation there had got pretty bad his trip got cancelled and we made vague plans to see each other over the break. About a week into the break, the pandemic really starts looming over the UK so uni announces all classes next term would be remote and the US starts getting all its overseas residents to return. Then one evening I'm listening to this song and I get a message from him explaining that he's very quickly got to get on a flight to return the states and he's not coming back and (excuse me getting embarrassingly dramatic for a bit) it just kinda knocks the life out of me. So I sit there and loop the song for like an hour and over the next couple weeks listening to it is pretty much the main way I feel anything. In terms of the concept of the album Grimes claims this song is meant to represent like the dystopian god of internet dating or something but to me in the context of the album it's the airy, blissful heaven on the other side of the nihilistic sludge of Before the fever. I love that there's still a melancholic undercurrent throughout the lyrics (that I adore all of) but specifically culminating in the final line "There you are getting away / Think we finally lose" that still makes me well up in time for the beautiful outro so hopefully it's easy to see why I latched onto it so hard. Anyway TL;DR covid killed my love life and this song was the only thing that made me feel anything for a while

**Awkward\_King** (10): I almost changed my 11 to this over the last week I can't lie, the song is just so happy to me, Grimes' vocal delivery is some of my favourite on the album and I love the simple melody and song structure as oppose to the experimental and constantly changing formats of the rest of the album. It's just such a nice song.

**akanewasright** (9.7): I actually really like this one lol. I don’t know if I can pinpoint why, but it’s just… fun. Dark in a tongue in cheek, edgy way. A few people like… REALLY hated this one, and while I do get why (more than one person made the Marshmallo comparison lmao), I think it’s a lot of fun. Kinda wish this one did better.

#Will miss Grimes when she's not around

**jman457** (11): Mega Bop with quotable AF lyrics

**duochromepalmtree** (10): Catchy, beautiful, and really interesting lyrically. One of my favorite songs in this entire rate.

**jasannn** (10): Grime’s best song here by a mile

**SamuelMashups** (10): I remember when she gave us the files to make our own green screen videos for this track. She's a generous queen.

**seanderlust** (10): I really enjoy listening to grimes' lower register. I wish she would sing mid-tempo songs in it more often

**steelstepladder** (10): those four little beeps are chefs kiss

**stryxen** (10): ugh omg ugh aahhh AHGHHHH

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Grimes has basically burned her entire reputation up already in my eyes, but the moments on this album that I like the best are when she steps back from the A.I. themes and has more human moments like this

**Uberpigeon** (10): This song is about the old album art. I miss it.

**vayyiqra** (10): This is another one of those "hits a little too close to home" songs on this album. The way Grimes can be so nonchalant singing about contemplating suicide is so dark but also realistic - suicidal people who truly want to die often feel nothing about it. Anyway, this is extremely dark so I'll stop here, but sometimes you just need to take a minute to contemplate the void, you know?

**xavieryes** (10): The main reason I decided to do this rate was to give this song an 11... and well I ended up loving the other two albums much more than this one and Poppy almost snagged my 11 while Allie X actually managed to do it. Nonetheless, this is still an incredible and ridiculously catchy song, and whether or not you'll miss it when it's no longer around, it can stay in your head for days.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): the closest thing to an underrated gem this album has imo, this is kinda like Delete Forever’s more blunt, less wistful sister

**cremeebrulee** (9): sounds fake but ok

**IIIHenryIII** (9): wait, why isn't Marshmallow credited in his song?

**runaway3212** (9): me @ 5 years old running away from my parents because they wouldn't let me have dessert without finishing my main dinner

**skargardin** (9): mood

**UselessTacooo** (9): I was not expecting to like this as much as I did. I’m so happy the song didn’t drag on as long as some others. It goes for that short and sweet route that works heavily in her favour.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Oddly accessible, and it took the longest time to grown on me but once it did, I was really into the intrusive thoughts laced with the sound

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): it’s hitting and uncomfartably so

**Vultuxe** (8.5): it's cute

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): I like the kinda pop punk meets electronica vibes going on with this track

**bbfan132** (8): short yet really fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): “You’ll miss me when I’m not around” — Past Grimes warning us about her creativity and talent leaving her when she started dating Elon Musk. But now we’re looking out for that post-breakup comeback album!

**sarcasticsobs** (8): the guitar rules

**throwaway7650** (8): gec gec gec gec (do TWOE for poppy)

**TiltControls** (8): [doubt]

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Wait, why is this actually really depressing?

**nt96** (7.5): Grimes knew she would breakup with Elon and wrote this ahead of time. We love a ~~two faced~~ prophetic queen 😍

**wavingwolves** (7.5): grimes i wish you had no internet presence whatsoever so i could miss anything about you

#Will ghost with no remorse

**AHSWeeknd** (7): is this a hyperpop ballad?

**bigbigbee** (7): shart mix

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): I like the sound of this one with the bass heavy groove, but I have no idea what the lyrics are about. Reading Genius, apparently it's about an angel that kills herself to get out of heaven, but ends up there anyway. Huh.

**iniekcja\_** (7): eh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): a worthy follow up to my name is dark

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): this felt so short?

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): a line from the chorus of "Mugs" by Hannah Kendrich

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): i like it but it isn't giving much

**whoisValensi** (6.5): The lyrics are lowkey a mood and this one sounds good but I'm not blown away tbh.

**fairytalehigh** (6): the rave edition remix outsold, tbh

**imbaby122** (6): the prechorus is so perfect which is kind of tragic because everything else is kinda nothingness to me

**qazz23** (6): Kinda generic, but at least it's short

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): didnt anna kendrick do this in 2012

**seaofblasphemy** (5): I won’t miss this song when it’s not around

**Sundraliz** (4): Same vein as Delete Forever it's just not for me

**Island715** (3): Would be just decent without the chipmunk noises but

**sage** (3): i really dont like the chorus in this + the weird edited vocal thing thats introduced right in the beginning of the song is SO bad

**frogaranaman** (1): why does this have the fucking Marshmello vocal synth in it

**BeauMeringue212** (0): No I won't

**mudkip1** (0): this is the worst song i think i've ever heard i hate the production so much and her voice sounds terrible

#You're gonna miss by by my hair you're gonna miss me everywhere

**akanewasright** (10): This has always been one of my very favorites on the album. Always. I fell in love with it because I thought the vocal style and lyrics in the verses was cool, but something about the song felt kind of… off. Creepy. At some point I, like many of the high scores, looked up the lyrics and realized exactly why something felt off - this song is *fucked up*. Being taken advantage of at a party, but having mixed feelings because you genuinely had a good time is such a complex and deeply sad feeling, but she executes it PERFECTLY. However, it seems the repetition was too much for some of you, which is understandable.

**Awkward\_King** (5): Kind of have a love/hate relationship with this song, on one hand, it's probably the darkest song Allie has ever written, and it is so well crafted, the darkness is hidden in such eclectic swing music. And while I understand the point of the repetition of the chorus and what it means and how you can hear different things in that line, I also think musically it gets quite annoying and I could not listen to this more than a couple times in a row. The "got a devil on my back, it's a tribute to my mother" line is one of my favourite lyrics ever though ngl.

#wasthelifewasthelifewasthelifewasthelifewasthelifewasthelife

**AHSWeeknd** (11): This just doesn’t get old, it’s fresh every time I listen to it

**fairytalehigh** (11): this song is fucked up pop perfection. sadly relatable, disturbingly catchy, STACKED with brilliant details, a bopping beat, it just goes and goes. my favorite Allie X song and a dark alt pop masterpiece.

**joeeswift** (11): this gave me chills when I looked up the meaning behind the song

**xavieryes** (11): I didn't notice how dark this song is on the first listen, but then I actually paid attention to the lyrics and read Allie's own comment on the song... and holy shit the feeling of being so intoxicated you end up being the clown of the party is so relatable to the point it's kinda uncomfortable to listen to this song. That includes the bittersweetness of it: "I am completely destroying myself here... but at least I’m feeling something" is so fucking accurate and the song captures that feeling perfectly. And lyrics aside, it's also a sonically fantastic song, and quite catchy. Choosing my 11 was rough but this was definitely the most impactful song in the rate for me.

**celladonn** (10): Absolutely slaps, such a sinister and stomach-churning bop

**cremeebrulee** (10): i generally don’t do too well with songs about sexual violence but i think the reason why i think i’m able to appreciate / actually revisit this one is because the implication of assault is very subtle lyrically, so it’s easy to ignore if need be but. but the experience of it is kinda found all over the sound of this song. >!for example, the really frantic, nearly anxious chorus of “was the life, was the life” and the last part of the pre-chorus where the music cuts out just before allie says “but i don’t remember anything” just feels exactly like the moment when you realize what has happened to you. obviously, mileage may vary with other survivors, but to me it feels very realistic.!< anyway, good song and most times i just turn my brain off and bop to it dddd

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): A jam highlighting the effects of trauma that our protagonist is beginning to face now, and which was underlying just two tracks ago? Right up my lane

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): took me forever to figure out what this song was about but I’m not gonna stop listening to it

**iniekcja\_** (10): this is a great song to walk to

**nt96** (10): Those additional vocal melodies just ascend me every time.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the songification of [:grinny:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/898463816684277771.png)

**runaway3212** (10): This song really reminds me of all the worst parties

**SamuelMashups** (10): Powerful meaning that I relate to, the lyrics are well developed. I cried when I heard it for the first time.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I love really dancy or high tempo songs that are also just super fucking depressing lyrically

**UselessTacooo** (10): Allie… this is genius. The way the chorus is made to sound like she is saying 3 different things is very creative. One of my favourite tracks in this rate. Also the bass in the chorus? This is too much.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): This is like the dark side of Regulars. Very much… oof.

**throwaway7650** (9.5): it does get really repetitive but the lyrics... haunting tbh

**babadork** (9): There’s something almost menacing about the post-chorus

**BeauMeringue212** (9): The contrast between how upbeat the song is and the tragically dark lyrics always gets me.

**bluehxrizon** (9): The last chorus is stun

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the verses are a serve, but the chorus is a bit underwhelming. The post-chorus is great, and I wish it was the actual chorus.

**Vultuxe** (9): really dark but it bops

**sage** (8.8): i think this song works really well actually

**jman457** (8.5): It explores the memories of hazy night that was fun but frightning

**duochromepalmtree** (8): I just finished reading daisy Jones and the six and something tells me Allie x did too. So very daisy

**stryxen** (8): this song is so heavy lyrically and the production perfectly captures the intensity and this is still growing on me i think

**Uberpigeon** (8): how i feel when my comment gets on the banner

**waluigiest** (8): I think the “wasthelife wasthelife wasthelife” part is annoying but necessary. I think this really captures a looot of the post-party anxiety that I feel

**wexpyke** (8): : the lyrics hit a little too close to home oof lmao

**1998tweety** (7.5): small bop

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): just a lil too repetitive

**TiltControls** (7.5): Love the lyrics, but wish the song itself were a bit more interesting

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I love the bass line. The meaning behind this song though. Ok, harmonies.

#Party poopers... wait that was yesterday

**bbfan132** (7): fun but not as good as most of the other songs

**IIIHenryIII** (7): more like drag of the party

**seanderlust** (6.5): I get the tragic but also pretty complicated meaning but in practice honestly the post-chorus gives me a headache. I know it's supposed to do that to an extent but it's not very pleasant in practice. plus one point for the live performance as that was very captivating

**seaofblasphemy** (6): Catchy but forgettable

**skargardin** (6): It's been a while since I listened to this and I have to say that the pre-chorus is a bit grating. The rest is stellar though.

**whoisValensi** (6): There are implications here... Tho I must say they're handled well... I think... Tho sonically idk how I feel about this one. Like it has its moments but it's also not that super interesting idk.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (6): The album drops off here :(

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): The beat is pretty catchy here, but the song is kinda forgettable for me, and the repetition of the chorus I find kinda annoying. Not a huge fan of this one at all.

**martian\_pet** (5): i like how it starts with the first verse but i dislike the chorus

**bigbigbee** (3.5): Adore the “tribute to my mother” line, dislike everything else, REALLY don’t like the chorus

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): was liking this until the chorus came in and completely ruined any positive thoughts i had

**Island715** (2): what the

**wavingwolves** (1): this is the worst chorus i've ever heard

**buddhacharm** (8.5): lockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockitlockit

**qazz23** (8): Iwasthelifewasthelifewasthelifewasthelife

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): groovy but i got out of breath just listening to the chorus

**vayyiqra** (7): I want to like this more but the chorus is very repetitive and that was hard to get past for me, since that's one of my musical pet peeves. Few artists can make very repetitive music sound good, to be fair. Anyway, the rest of the song is fine. I don't dislike it at all. The lyrics are extremely messed up, by the way, which is easy to miss - read them to get the full impact of the song. I would even say it's one of Allie's darkest songs, and she has a -lot- of them. That made me appreciate the song more and raise its score.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): This is kinda repetitive but it also kinda slaps.

**imbaby122** (4): i think this song is a fan favorite but i don’t get ittttttt. this is the only song on the album i don’t have playlisted. i’m sorry. the repeating post-chorus is cool in theory and makes sense in the song but it’s actually annoying. the hand clapping also hurts my head :( it just doesn’t work for me. the bridge is cool though and i like the bassline.

**steelstepladder** (3.4): normally I can tolerate repetition but this actually makes me want to die. Shame cause the verses aren’t half bad

**Brendon-Urine** (3): wasthelifewasthelifewasthelifewasthelife is incredibly annoying

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is the other song in the rate that I play a lot when I feel depressed. For quite a few reasons, actually. This song is about addiction (opioid addiction specifically), and uh… >!I was very nearly a teenage alcoholic so I can relate to some of the themes.!< But on top of that, it just sounds… desperate and deflated, and even disregarding the themes. It’s a little unsatisfying too, which makes it’s placement understandable, but I’m honestly really pleasantly surprised it performed this well (with several 11s, too, I did not expect that).

**Awkward\_King** (4): While it isn't my favourite song by any means, it is very good, and honestly kinda surprised it managed to make it to day 2, especially over a song much more talked about like Super Duper, but I guess it's uncontroversialness won in the end.

---

#Madame X is a secret agent. She is a dancer. A professor. A head of state.

**bluehxrizon** (11): gorgeous song. a thesis statement. she snapped.

**nt96** (11): It's heartbreaking to see our precious Allie being bereft of her belongings by that dastardly X. But I can rest well knowing that she's has the most precious gift one can hold dear to - My 11❤. A rate win wouldn't hurt though.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an eleven contender. This and Life of the Party are two of the best songs I’ve ever heard.

**runaway3212** (10): Fuck addiction all my homies hate addiction

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Listening to this is a cold chill throughout my body. Without any context, this sounds like it is about a clandestine affair with another person, maybe being emotionally dependent on a sex worker… then you realize it is about drugs. Allie is a master at these allegories that aren’t always super obvious, and at conveying the protagonist’s desperation and loneliness. The darkest song on the album sonically, and maybe second darkest lyrically.

**seanderlust** (10): oh this is gorgeous. 11 contender

**throwaway7650** (10): balladphobia better not do this dirty - this is a 10. the strings!

**UselessTacooo** (10): one of the more captivating ballads I’ve heard in a while. It’s so intimate and dark, which are the ingredients for an amazing song.

**Vultuxe** (10): i looove her piano ballads so much

**imbaby122** (9.7): this song is equal parts drama and heartbreak. like i will perform this and have my main character moment and also sob to this. the strings are so enchanting. the twinkling piano is alluring. THE OUTRO IS UNMATCHED. when all the instrumentation is added it feels like a total breakdown. the metaphor follows through in every aspect of the song and it’s heart-wrenching.

**sage** (9.3): this is such a good ballad, washed l0ve me wr0ng

**Brendon-Urine** (9): would not have guessed this is about the opioid crisis if I hadn't look it up, but this was heartbreaking. she nailed this

**iniekcja\_** (9): I love how cinematic this is

**skargardin** (9): She sounds so good here, maybe my favourite vocal delivery on the whole album.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Wait, this so sad! These Lyrics!!! Pain. Pure Pain. "You fill me up with your emptiness" might just be one of the best lyrics I've ever heard.

**wexpyke** (9): :oof

**xxipil0ts** (9): I wish she would release more slow ballads. This sounds like a Bond song.

**jman457** (8.7): really beautiful track

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): a really good shake up

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it's giving Allie Del X

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): My least favourite song on the album, but it's still pretty good tbh.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): pretty good actually

#A flop. A (bad) singer. A whore.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Given the orchestral backing, the downtempo nature, and the song being an entire allegory for heroin use, this really feels like a song that Lana Del Rey would have done earlier in her career. Would have fit nicely on Ultraviolence.

**SamuelMashups** (7): Meh, it lacks a little bit of spice. The visualizer video was great but it sounds very repetitive in certain areas, especially the post-chorus.

**seaofblasphemy** (7): Decently dramatic

**steelstepladder** (7): sorry but this is the only lady x in my life https://youtu.be/sr9yWp5sDJ0

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.8): this needs to feature in a periodic drama asap

**celladonn** (6): There's some pretty instrumentation and I appreciate the lyrics but this a little boring

**duochromepalmtree** (6): after an album of bangers this one just didn’t excite me. I found myself wishing it would end and that probably isn’t good. Pretty though!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): It makes sense that Allie would write a whole song about a horse, she kinda has “we had horses growing up” energy

**vayyiqra** (6): Musically I don't like this much, but the lyrics are personal to me since I've seen loved ones struggle with drug addiction, including opioids and heroin, so that gives it an emotional resonance to me. I find it hard to listen to though. I need a hug now.

**TiltControls** (5): solve for x = 2x + 3 - 8

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I like the drama but I’m also pretty bored.

**akanewasright** (10): This one is a massive robbery, I’m sorry. On the one hand I understand that the song is 7 minutes long, that the chorus is campy enough to be off putting, and that some people just do not like this sound on Grimes… but I find all of that to be put to good use. The song never drags for me even at it’s length, I love the chorus (and all of the lyrics in general, actually), and this sound is a massive serve idc.

**Awkward\_King** (10): Pun intended but she put fucking drugs in this song it's so addictive, and I am sad about it being robbed this hard. The lyrics are absolutely Grimes on her faux-god camp bullshit and I love it.

#I just smoked a bunch of fuckin PCP

**Island715** (11): my favorite Grimes songs have always been the ones that lean into rock and this just feels like a culmination of all that

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): ABSOLUTE SMASHA

**Uberpigeon** (11): this song should be 20 minutes long

**WhyDoIExistXD** (11): Such an easy standout and one of the greatest in her discography

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I wish the whole album sounded more like this, this goes hard as much as it pains me to admit

**cremeebrulee** (10): “the boys are such a bore, the girls are such a bore” me when i’m a bisexual with high standards

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I really love this song. It really makes you feel like you’re on a drug fueled binge and stumbling around late at night.

**imbaby122** (10): the first grimes song i really loved. distorted screaming is my jam even if no one ever does it better than caroline polachek. also the guitar gives linkin park in the best way like this song is 2000s nostalgia with a very grimes futuristic feel. such a banger. that’s what the drugs are for!

**iniekcja\_** (10): everybody say thank you Grimes

**sage** (10): SMASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Idk if that’s what Grimes intended but… it reminds me of people who think they’re so edgy and alt and ~sticking it to the man~, but are actually conservative at heart and have no political conviction other than empty hedonism, and it’s brilliant for that.

**SamuelMashups** (10): Talented, brilliant, powerful, incredible.

**skargardin** (10): This is awakening my full video game villain fantasy and I love it

**vayyiqra** (10): God, what a mood. "I don't wanna sleep anymore, that's what the drugs are for!" Yeah, that's me on stimulants, I guess. Here Grimes shows a bit of much-needed self-awareness ("you know me as the girl who plays with fire") and leans into the edgy villainous Miss Anthropocene persona. It's an extremely cynical song, but she was basically just making it as catharsis. Anyway, this is the most Grimes thing ever: https://images.genius.com/84e484166999a7fa1c65dcf6a42592b3.588x265x1.png

**veryanniev** (10): it always catches me off guard how incredible the «fireeyaAAAAAAHHH» scream sounds lmao

**Vromega** (10): I was not a fan of this song at first, but it slowly became one of my fave of this album. The chorus makes me quite emotional, i don't know why.

**seanderlust** (8.6): https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xinze3

**jman457** (8.5): Really captures the feeling of this whole rate

**pheromenos** (8.5): i'm just trying to get my green card and i just...bless everyone [host note: this video sends]

**nt96** (8): I'm soaking in reverb right now

**qazz23** (8): I like the industrial sound here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): ok i'm really into this

**thedoctordances1940** (8): as much as I really like it there are just some tiny little things in the song which are annoying, both vocally and in the production and it just stops it from being truly great.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I'm sorry, but the title is giving "I'm 13 and this is deep" vibes. It's a good song though.

**UselessTacooo** (8): I have absolutely no clue what the fuck is happening but bestie I. Am. Ascending.

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): inoffensive

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): she's so edgy 🤪

#Had to be inebriated to get through the song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): I want to like this track more than I do, but I think it has no reason being nearly six minutes long, and like a lot of other tracks here, it feels too overproduced and like there's just a lot of noise in here muddying up the mix. The version that was in Grimes' [apple ad](https://www.reddit.com/r/Grimes/comments/bzawg6/removed_the_grimes_promo_vid_for_the_behind_the/) is a lot cleaner and I wish we got that mix instead.

**bbfan132** (7): a bit too messy but it’s pretty good

**Vultuxe** (7): LOVE the chorus, the rest i'm not so sure

**waluigiest** (7): it feels like classic grimes but again doesn’t feel genuine given her personal life

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): “I never trust the government” Elon’s impact

**frogaranaman** (6): sounds mildly horny. unsure of this energy

**throwaway7650** (5): I'd probably like this a lot more if it was a poppy song

**bluehxrizon** (4): I actually like the louder messier parts better than the quieter ones. Not a fan of this track overall

**mudkip1** (4): a decent chorus inside of a meandering beat that floats pointlessly around and is immediately forgotten once the next track starts

**bulforster** (3.2): I get that she's singing about disaffection but between her droning voice, cringey lyrics and laboring production this is just such a slog to get through

**CrimsonROSET** (3): my hearing is already failing me i do not want to incentivize it

**TiltControls** (3): Sometimes I worry Grimes vocals are my least favourite part of Grimes songs

**whoisValensi** (3): I'm snoozing thru like half this album and it's not even on purpose. After learning that this was supposed to actually be two albums (this and a collabs album) I think I would have liked the collabs album more... Because man these solo songs are just not that good tbh.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): Again, boilerplate Grimes and kind of grating to listen to with the pitched up vocals and such. "that's what the drugs r 4" ...grimes, we don't have to do this.

akanewasright: #[Art Age](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/854173771506253824.png?size=96)

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): The melodies are addictive and her being Kill v. Maim's older, more nihilistic sister does wonders for its replayability

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): This song rules. We get the big heavier nu-metal type chorus here, with the best sing along vocals that kind of remind me of the chorus of Kill v. Maim, and of course songs where Grimes screams in them is always a massive plus. And it's honestly quite ironic that this is the heaviest song written and kinda about insomnia in a way. I also do like the outro as well which basically is an expanded instrumental of the verses.

**xxipil0ts** (8): I forgot that this song sounded so dream pop-esque! This felt like an Art Angels B side!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I can hear the old Grimes in there. Somewhere.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): this feels like it would rip had she made it on Art Angels but it lacks the punch of the songs from that album it reminds me of

#They call me hell, they call me stacy...

**plastichaxan** (10): hi dark i'm poppy (sorry i had to)

**seaofblasphemy** (8): I thought it was c…

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I thought it was Grimes???

**ReallyCreative** (6): isn't your name literally the speed of light? can we make up our minds?

**runaway3212** (6): If a dog sang this, the name would be My Name is Bark

**fairytalehigh** (5): Their name is dark but my gay ass is BORED

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): This was the grower for me, the first five tracks are all great but this kinda blended in until suddenly it popped out to me on its own and it's such a good individual track, the electric guitars are awesome and it has some of my favourite lyrics on the album :D

**akanewasright** (9): This is one of the HARDEST songs on album, it just feels aggressive and without restraint. I honestly haven’t really sat with the lyrics much, beyond knowing “this is probably about the Mars Argo case”, but I know that sonically, this is one of the most powerful in the rate.

---

#Unique snowflakes

**bluehxrizon** (10): Rock excellence and pop excellence

**mudkip1** (10): why is this so good it has no right

**nt96** (10): The way it goes from absolute caustic anger to a sad, airy, sound straight out of The Bends only to go back to anger is just pure bipolar chaos and I'm living for it.

**plastichaxan** (10): me naming myself after poppy and then her releasing this song…

**qazz23** (10): Nice genre mixing here and synth line

**Raykel** (10): The Neon Demon vibes.

**sage** (10): COLLAPSE!

**SamuelMashups** (10): - She finally decided to stop going modern pop to a swing style and went for a different time signature style.

**TiltControls** (10): this 4 song stretch at the start is so fucking good.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): ok the first half of this track is 10/10, the little beat switch unfortunately takes me out of it though (as pretty as it is, it just kills me from looping the first part)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this has such swagger

**throwaway7650** (9.5): she really said "IYKYK" about the meaning of this huh

**1998tweety** (9): now hold AWN, give me more of this

**AHSWeeknd** (9): The contrast is genius

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I can't tell if this is a diss track or a self-hatred anthem. Either way, we head bangin'!

**fairytalehigh** (9): judas priest says hi

**hikkaru** (9): me when taylor announced YNTCD as the 2nd lover single

**imbaby122** (9): lets end wildest dreams heartbeat discourse and open up anything like me heartbeat discourse. love when she brings the track into r/indieheads territory and then jump scares me right after. spooky!

**runaway3212** (9): hate when I'm walking down the street and somebody is wearing a sweater, like ???? I'm already wearing a sweater have some respect

**skargardin** (9): This chorus is so cathartic

**waluigiest** (9): the sentimental bits are stunning. The rest is mostly good too and the contrast is necessary here

**whoisValensi** (9): Take a shot every time someone calls this the Mars Argo song.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.8): Love the heavy guitar and her voice is lovely in the mellow moments too

**endcreditouilles** (8.6): Love is never-ending in me. Take it out of me

**bbfan132** (8.5): i feel like this is what an alt metal song by fiona apple would sound like

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): I scream how this can be looked at like her sarcastic response to her complex relation to Mars Argo. More than that, I like to see it as being about the relationship between Poppy the artist and the person

**seanderlust** (8.5): that grinding bassline on the chorus UGGHHHHH

**jman457** (8.4): Slow and metal parts actually work well together here

**wavingwolves** (8.2): when poppy goes "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" 😻

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I disagree, everyone should be just like you

**iniekcja\_** (8): this reminds me of the time my law professor said that she won't be teaching us to become like her, because she's too great and there's no need for anyone similar

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): slower section didn’t do it for me on this one, but did make that final “breakdown” more impactful

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): This one was really interesting. The bridge(?) was a welcome surprise and I do like the sudden transition, I think

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Ok, but that outro was everything!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.3): I like the spacey, softer moments on this song. Weirdly, I tend to like Poppy's heavier moments but the heavy moments here were giving me the immature side of 00s nu-metal.

#Clones

**bulforster** (7): I'm a bit distracted by the similarities to bury a friend in the first verses.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): this song SCARES ME. but there is some great instrumentation here. Really really cool arrangement. I LOVE the outro.

**steelstepladder** (7): KEEP IT 300 LIKE THE ROMANS

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): the first two minutes is great but then... idk what happens

**UselessTacooo** (7): this song shows the most unused potential. The intro is so interesting, but poppy just flows into the same metal sound the rest of the album has. It sure as hell isn’t bad, I’m just picky and would have preferred the song to be based around that instrumental.

**cremeebrulee** (6.8): i think the transition here from the harsher chorus to that more acoustic ending actually works here but it still feels unfinished idk

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): lyrically one of the best on the album but one drawback of the instrumentals overwhelming the lyrics so much is that not loving the sonics here keeps this from a higher score when it should be high. Maybe it’d be a grower if I kept listening

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): too repetitive

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this song builds really well but that also means i only really like the ending

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): There's more contrast here, with some spaces where you get a heavy beat with some backing synth sample, crunchy guitars, and then a big atmospheric quieter section after a pretty great guitar solo. It's not as great as Concrete regarding the contrast, but I do really love her voice in that more atmospheric portion.

**seaofblasphemy** (6): It’s alright

**static\_int\_husp** (6): I really like the intro and bridge here. The verses are fine, but the choruses just feel generic

**ReallyCreative** (5): the "bridge" is actually really enjoyable but it's unfortunately bookended by blunt force trauma

**Sundraliz** (5): I don't like the gentle bits that's not what I'm here for sorry

**Vultuxe** (5): this reminds me of bury a friend, a lot.

**frogaranaman** (4): oh no not this tri genre shit again

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): it’s fine ig but kinda boring...feel like the bridge slows down momentum (probably the point but that doesn’t mean i have to like it!)

**vayyiqra** (4): I like the shuffle beat on this - a lot of gothic music (e.g. "Personal Jesus" by Depeche Mode) has that kind of rhythm. As with most of this album, I'm not into the screaming or the squelchy guitar lead. There is a really nice "ethereal" moment in the interlude which is probably my favourite part of the album though. I really don't care for the ending though. Overall, very mixed feelings on this song.

**Awkward\_King** (8): One of my most impressive feats was when this leaked like three months early out of nowhere, and I managed to only listen to it like twice and actually waited til the album, because I would not be able to do that with an Allie leak now. I love the progression of the post-chorus, sure the lyrics are kinda cheesy and predictable but the way Allie slowly reveals them is really cool.

**akanewasright** (7.5): I… don’t love this one as much as some of y’all do. It’s grown on me a lot over time, but the chorus has kinda felt a bit less… inspired than some of the best on the album, and a lot of the lyrics feel kind of standard to me. But the post-chorus is one of the best moments on the album, and it is a really fun vibe, it’s just… there’s better Allie on the album.

#Servants of Satan 😎

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Finally, an ethical Melanie Martinez song

**moooo566** (11): i determined this with the trued and true method of literally just flipping a coin

**1998tweety** (10): I mean come on now that bridge and last chorus, she was giving everything that needed to be gave

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Play Banks’ “The Devil” after this. It’s literally a story.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me ordering the same thing at a restaurant every time I go there.

**mudkip1** (10): SING BITCH!

**qazz23** (10): Very hooky chorus

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): A serious 11 contender, I was shook when I first heard the snippet. So sweeping and dramatic. I love how this could be not only be about a toxic romantic relationship, but about a sinister relationship with oneself, and being your own worst enemy.

**throwaway7650** (10): the vocals at the start of the last chorus? I was already sold but now I was SOLD. also stream better the devil I know by kylie minogue

**UselessTacooo** (10): This is the song that got me hooked on this album. Allies' vocals mixed with the production just blend to create a masterpiece.

**Vromega** (10): This chorus is a bop ! Quite addicting

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this song somewhat has >:) energy but i googled and it also might be about addiction so maybe not

**imbaby122** (9): how do u not moan along to this song. seriously asking bc i cant resist sometimes. the adlibs in the last chorus omfg they tickle my brain.

**moonagenightmares** (9): i went insane trying to remember what that bassline reminded me of and finally figured out it was breathe by years&years (live version) so i thought i’d share

**skargardin** (9): It's the "hmmm-mmm-mmmm"s for me

**Uberpigeon** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCEKBqYVaN4

**waluigiest** (9): “but the wicked one is me” hurts

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Bop after bop we love her

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): very groovy and cool and I love the lyrics. A little predictable (the devil I know vs the devil I don’t) but it does a great job capturing what it feels like to be trapped in a dynamic you know isn’t healthy

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): the least memorable track on Cape God for me, it's nice but just kinda… there (that post-chorus is amazing tho)

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): We love the Madonna-print in pop acts making Christianity innuendo sound so tempting

**Sundraliz** (8): it bumps

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): two songs in and this album art encapsulates this album perfectly

**vayyiqra** (8): Definitely one of the lyrically darker songs on the album, which is saying a lot - Allie really likes this theme of being helpless to stop herself from self-destructive behaviours, like on "Old Habits Die Hard" for example. I like how that contrasts with how this is a pretty upbeat song musically.

**Vultuxe** (8): i swear i heard a discord ping sound like partway through the chorus lol. bop.

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): not a huge fan of the melody in the chorus, but i like the lyrical approach here

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): she's always serving with the visuals, isn't she?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I love her voice! This is so catchy, but it's so dark.

**Raykel** (7.2): This sounds like Arctic Monkeys somehow.

**bbfan132** (7): wish i liked this more but it’s a nice song

**bigbigbee** (7): (nods sagely) like when you eat ice cream after dinner even though you know it will give you tummy troubles at 2AM instead of going hungry

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): I like the little bass driven groove again. I just realized, her voice reminds me kind of like Ariana's and Carly's a bit, she does have the strongest voice of these three. Good little tune here as well.

**iniekcja\_** (7): I feel like I heard at least 10 versions of this song already

**Island715** (7): Ignoring lyrics cause I like the cool melodies in that chorus

**SamuelMashups** (7): The guitar in the song is what makes this song a masterpiece.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): this came on shuffle right after Met Him Last Night and I don’t have anything interesting to say but something about that sent me a little

#Being tortured in hell

**wavingwolves** (6.8): i'm kind of a sucker for this kind of religious imagery and thematic but sonically it doesn't do that much for me

**seaofblasphemy** (6.5): Vocals sound good

**whoisValensi** (6.5): The title of this song is me when I look in the mirror.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.3): It's a fine song, but something about it feels like it'd be in a CW show commercial. Something about it feels a little trite, sadly. I think I've heard this song so much from Lorde and the MØ album I really liked in 2014, "No Mythologies to Follow".

**sage** (6.3): this is kinda annoying but its good

**jman457** (6.2): Nice lyrics, but the theater girl vibes are strong on this one

**TiltControls** (6): me coming into this rate having only previously listened to cape god

**wexpyke** (6): : catchy but kind of basic, it got annoying the more i listened to it

**frogaranaman** (5): adds to my "songs about the devil that the devil would potentially torture me with" playlist

**runaway3212** (5): Can't relate I say my prayers

**mrmoody112** (4.5): idk why but i hate this chorus

**SmileAndTears** (4): I can't stand that chorus :/

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): even more boring after multiple listens

#But the wicked one is Brendon Urie

**stryxen** (8): but the wicked one is Me-hee-hee!

**akanewasright** (10): GOD this song is fucking cool. Like… I talked about Fill the Crown’s shifts in style feeling seamless, but this one does it even better. Poppy taking the verses of the song to give what seems to be genuine advice to people in a similar situation to her is honestly really touching, and her defiance in the choruses sells the song completely.

**Awkward\_King** (10): I love this as a pick me up from Nothing I Need, it's got such a good groove to it and the verses are a highlight of the album for me musically. Sidenote but the lyric "Don't go blind from the stars in your eyes" is one of my favourite lyrics on the whole album and is just like a touch of magic for me.

#Lets talk about dogs

**AHSWeeknd** (9): me talking to dogs

**runaway3212** (9): omg I didnt know poppy was into pup play

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): Poppy dives into petplay and these time the energy switchups work for me! Also some of this reminds me of my forbidden guilty pleasure artist Die Antwoord in a good way

**cherryices** (7.5): me to TXT

**CrimsonROSET** (7): are there gonna be any dog training comments or am i gonna be weird for doing one

**Sundraliz** (6): I like being talked to like a dog, +2

**frogaranaman** (5): me to my dog

#Good boys

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’ve heard the term “radio star” used in at least three songs now and still have no idea wtf it means. Anyway the beat on this one SLAPS.

**mrmoody112** (10): this coming on shuffle while i was driving almost offed me

**plastichaxan** (10): if Niki won’t do the rate just to comment Sit/Slay i am doing it myself

**qazz23** (10): That ending scream

**ReallyCreative** (10): probably the best fusion of rock and pop sounds on the album

**sage** (10): the transitions slay so bad

**steelstepladder** (10): love the more metal tracks on this

**throwaway7650** (10): I love listening to the gym leader theme from pokemon X and Y

**xavieryes** (10): one of my multiple 11 contenders

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): I am LIVING for the drum n bass beat with that delicious distroted guitar

**pheromenos** (9.3): that outro though

**imbaby122** (9.2): i dig the beat asf it really drives the song. why does it lowkey remind me of the sinister soundtrack tho 😵‍💫 also distorted screaming yasssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**1998tweety** (9): ok this ate

**endcreditouilles** (9): this really embodies that big tiddy goth gf spirit

**mudkip1** (9): vibing

**stryxen** (9): sit by japanese breakfast so true let’s rate jubilee

**thedoctordances1940** (9): yet another banger

**UselessTacooo** (9): this is definitely one of the more interesting metal songs on the album. That scream at the end was definitely an interesting choice and I love it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.8): I like the way Poppy sings "welcome to the new starry night"

**bbfan132** (8.5): this production is super fun!!!!

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): giving me Underworld, i'm here for it

**whoisValensi** (8.5): Hi so I'm actually attending a listening party for once to do this rate and hey what the FUCK is this video.

**jman457** (8.4): love the trip hop vibes on here

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): vampire techno rave in those verses, pretty chorus

**BeauMeringue212** (8): the bit at the end is so good


**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): I love the intro synth, reminded me of Crystal Method for some reason. The whole outro lyrical portion has a really cool feel to it too, and really along with some nu metal again, this feels like a couple of genres stitched together.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.6): Poppy must have written this song while she was living in a society

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): grew off me after a couple of listens but still good

**IIIHenryIII** (7): unmemorable

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Why does this kinda sound like it could be in a video game?

#Stupid cats...

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): i liked the title a lot so i expected to like this more

**babadork** (6.5): I like it, but it loses me towards the end.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): this is a genuinely weird song but i think i like it??

**Vultuxe** (6.5): i don't mind that it kinda dips in between chill and chaotic.

**duochromepalmtree** (6): there is just so much happening!!!

**joeeswift** (6): I love the message!

**seaofblasphemy** (5.5): Yeah not really into it

**SamuelMashups** (5): - Very noisy, the bass is slightly bleeding. I know that she's trying to put some colors in the production but I'm not digging it.

**TiltControls** (5): The first track on the list where Poppy loses me a little. I don't think the shifts between sounds here are as strong as others on the album

**vayyiqra** (5): I like the beat to this, but am not sure the metre changes in that one part with the weird time signature (I play drums but can't be bothered to work out what exactly is going on there - I think it's 7/8 going into 8/8) work very well. I do hear, improbably, some hints of the band Prodigy in here, who probably no one doing this rate remembers. Anyway, the "clean" parts of this song are kind of nice. Otherwise I'm not big on it. The outro is also a little 2spooky4me.

**Awkward\_King** (11): Can I be honest? I don't have a story for why I'm 11'ing this song, it's just my favourite song in the rate and I think it's really fucking good.

**akanewasright** (10): This was a big grower for me, so maybe it shouldn’t be surprising to me that this didn’t make it that much further. I really love the candy-coated loneliness of the song, and how self awarely miserable it is. It’s campy while also being affecting, knowing that this is largely in reference to Allie’s time suffering with an autoimmune disorder that hit her when she was a teenager, leaving her unable to hang out with people her age and be a normal teen. ~~This also aged phenomenally well for seeing people post beach pictures in June 2020, like god dammit I don’t wanna superspread but :barrelcat:~~

---

#Cool kids who don't leave their bedrooms

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Allie predicted the quartile mood via telling a relatable tale for us introverts

**duochromepalmtree** (10): the theme song for all of us who suffer from seasonal depression but that season is summer

**frogaranaman** (10): me when I don't get dick during pride month

**qazz23** (10): Nice bouncy rhythm

**vayyiqra** (10): June gloom? In my room? It's extremely likely. Last summer and the one before it was quite a bust, so this song hits.

**waluigiest** (10): I have FELT this for two consecutive Junes!!! I play this and just emote!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.7): June Gloom by The Like was one of my favourite songs growing up, and this fits the same bouncy yet exhausted vibe

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): a dark synthpop bop for the sad gays

**jman457** (9.3): bop but make it depressive

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): me… when I'm sad… and it's June…

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): THE isolation anthem, I love how slightly off-kilter everything is from the piano to those melodies in the chorus and Allie's fun vocal

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Invented seasonal affective disorder AND cured it, what can’t she do?

**Sundraliz** (9): Impossible to dislike, right everyone? 👁

**seanderlust** (8.8): based on the genius explanation, this is how i'm envisioning allie when she was writing this song: https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/024/615/Screen_Shot_2017-11-10_at_10.36.15_AM.png

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**bigbigbee** (8.5): me, slightly out of breath - ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba!!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): God I hate the summer. At least cold weather gives me an excuse to stay indoors by myself.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): June Gloom is a very accurate weather forecast every year in San Francisco

**sage** (8.3): this instrumental gets clunky at points but its still rly good

**bbfan132** (8): not the most memorable song but i still liked it!

**IIIHenryIII** (8): us when we were all trying to stay positive during the 2020 pandemic

**iniekcja\_** (8): here's where the interesting part of the album starts

**skargardin** (8): June Gloom, in my room? It's more likely than you think

**throwaway7650** (8): "june gloom in my room" me this past summer so true allie

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Everybody during June of 2020!

**Uberpigeon** (8): late at night at 4am he said hows the weather in your room

**UselessTacooo** (7.8): A fun and non-bothersome bop. You cant hate it, but you can wish it had a bit more depth to it. However bonus points for the meaning I wasn’t aware of until recently.

**imbaby122** (7.5): i really like june gloom! “all the stars are dying like everyone that i’ll ever know” hits astronomically. but i feel like susie save your love and rings a bell do the funky groovy thing better.

**stryxen** (7.5): why did i not think to put this in my june monthly playlist in 2020 OR 2021

**TiltControls** (7.5): June is nice here cause it's usually warm but not boiling (fuck you July)

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i love the distorted lalalala it has going on omfg

**CrimsonROSET** (7): me when i wasn’t out yet watching pride

**Island715** (7): This ones cool too, love the quirky and busy production

#Losers who go out and do things

**Vultuxe** (7): feels slightly like filler, i know some people really like this one and i do but it lacks a little extra oomph. still a jam.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): i had no idea that this was about her autoimmune disease, so it's pretty cool that she wrote a song on that. i just don't find it one of the better songs on the albums unfortunately so i’m never relistening to this.

**seaofblasphemy** (6.5): Decent enough

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): Again I find this song pretty corny and sullen without the wryness or irreverence I was at least feeling in Fresh Laundry. I think it's going for that, but it's SUCH a miss for me.

**fairytalehigh** (6): as a gemini i THRIVE in june, can't relate

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): This one is okay. Sounds like a dark version of a Sara Barellies song at times.

**SamuelMashups** (6): Sorry but this one was BORING.

**thedoctordances1940** (6): just doesn't do much for me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): its fine

**runaway3212** (4): Junge Gloom? In My Room? It's more likely than you think

**whoisValensi** (3.5): I don't have much to say about this one beyond "Wow that came and went."

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): ...

**akanewasright** (10): This has always been one of my favorites on the album, and I’m really glad it made it as far as it did in this rate, since my impressions was that it wasn’t really that loved. But the melody is so hauntingly beautiful, and feels perfectly weary

**Awkward\_King** (7): This is so dreamy and I love that the song sounds like its like being sung through a filter of purpley hazey dreamyness, it's like equal parts ominous and calming.

---

#Literal vampires that disintegrate in the light

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): The beginning is so beautiful omg. This is so catchy and heartbreaking. I love the chorus and the way Poppy's voice modulates when she sings "I". I like the little production touches like the...gargling? in the bridge.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): a really delicate and beautiful song, kinda shoegazey, and it's probably gonna be massively robbed

**runaway3212** (10): The sun is really a toxic person if you think about it, you need to protect yourself from them and in return they do nothing. We as humans should really cut them off tbh be honest

**sage** (10): the chorus is actually so good

**SamuelMashups** (10): - Halloween vibes. Angelic but devilish, just like I like it!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i absolutely am NOT sick of the sun but love this song anyway

**throwaway7650** (10): if a man sang this it would be considered a rock classic

**wavingwolves** (10): how did poppy predict my 2021

**bbfan132** (9.5): :floating: this is gorgeous, i love the psychedelic/sun-drenched take on some of her older stuff

**hikkaru** (9.5): dream pop queen

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): me during my whole life living where the sun won't just take a break

**imbaby122** (9.5): HIT ME LIKE A PILE OF BRICKS. poppy sounds ethereal here the last chorus makes me soar and ascend. so stripped back in the most poppy way. i love.

**TiltControls** (9.5): brb saying a quick prayer against balladphobia

**CrimsonROSET** (9): me when i’m a groundhog

**duochromepalmtree** (9): poppy promoting sun safety! You love to see it! Get your skin checked, kids!

**fairytalehigh** (9): that time where you stop shoving a stranger in the mosh pit, hug a friend and sip some water because GIRL you need it

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I truly do prefer when Poppy does music like this instead of the metal stuff I’m sorry

**Island715** (9): I wasn’t really connecting with the other calm songs on this album but this one attracted me the most. idk it's just a familiar vibe and has such lush production that makes it better

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): fuck Daylight Saving Time amirite

**UselessTacooo** (9): The whole song is so ethereal. It took a long time for me to like, but it’s comfortably settled in my top poppy songs.

**stryxen** (8.9): this sounds a bit like a time n place track

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): An SCP When Day Breaks serve. The vulnerable moments shine through and Poppy lets us know she can do quiet too

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The armies of the five kings at Gibeon when Joshua asks God to stop the sun in the sky so he can continue to slaughter their armies

**plastichaxan** (8.5): so true

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): we could tell from looking at you girl

**moonagenightmares** (8.1): me too

**AHSWeeknd** (8): me when Halloween ends and I expect Christmas to be in full swing, snow and all.

**iniekcja\_** (8): this and the next track are both great but placed after all of those high energy tracks they feel sort of too calm? and that change of pace is definitely needed but it almost feels like the album just fizzles out towards the end

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): i’m vibing

**nt96** (8): Finally, a song for recluses and vampires.

**qazz23** (8): Nice dreamy sound

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): What in the world?!?! This is so different from everything else. I would unironcally listen to this while sitting in the sun.

**Vultuxe** (8): maybe i walked into this album with the wrong impression, this was fine

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): this is easily the most conventional thing here, and honestly it works great as a change of pace & necessary breather after everything else here. Might get dinged for not fitting on the album but I’m here for it

**sarcasticsobs** (7.7): me as a teenage wannabe goth:

**seanderlust** (7.7): this is so moody and brooding, I love it. this song after the preceding eight songs feels like self-isolating after lashing out in anger

**jman457** (7.6): Cute little bedroom pop tune

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): A song for those of us who straight up DO NOT tan.

**celladonn** (7.5): Me in summer

#has 2 houses by the beach

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): it's cute but nothing special

**1998tweety** (7): nice

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Definitely feels like a song about depression, the whole sad indie rock sound with the wet sounding guitars really add to that vibe. It's quite a pretty song overall despite the melancholy.

**whoisValensi** (6): Okay, I'll be real, this one kinda slogs.

**bigbigbee** (5.5): This is a case of Too-Obvious lyrics for me (in the chorus). Love the guitars tho

**frogaranaman** (5): man it just feels like a Pale Waves song

**seaofblasphemy** (5): I’m sick of boring songs

**steelstepladder** (5): The track listing on this album could be better ngl

**Sundraliz** (4): More metal

**vayyiqra** (4): Yeah I don't have much to say about this song so I'm going to take this space to say I feel the complete opposite of sick of the sun. DST just ended and this is my least favourite time of year. Seasonal depression is bad! That plus ADHD is why it took me forever to finish this ballot. Anyway, the song itself is okay, I guess. It's kind of like a mid-tier 90s alternative song, but doesn't really go anywhere. I don't hate it, but I felt like checking my watch during it, and I don't even wear a watch. That's not a good sign, you know?'

#I hate the sunlight, can't stand the warmth

**waluigiest** (7): I’m not! Stream Solar Power!

**wexpyke** (6.5): : evil lorde be like >:)

**skargardin** (6): Me after one (1) Solar Power album listen

**Awkward\_King** (10): God how the fuck did this not make the original album this is fucking brilliant, honestly my second favourite behind Concrete. It's so brilliantly chaotic (hahahahah) while also being measured. This was sitting at early day 3 for so long and I'm so sad it eventually slipped back into day 2 but it's still outlasting most of the regular album, which is awesome. I will say, I have one very minor issue with the song, being that I wish the lyric "I'm happy that the world is gonna end" was instead "I'm happy but the world is gonna end", because I think that takes it from like regular emo, fuck the world lyrics to like more complex how do I fit my own happiness into the end of the world type thing. But that is kind of pedantic it's just a change I wish was there ajksdjkad

**akanewasright** (9): Poppy’s screaming has improved SO much even from the non-deluxe songs. This wouldn’t fit on the album since the main tracklist is so intentionally done, but it’s EXCELLENT and I’m very happy it performed as well as it did. I miss the days when it was day 3, but it performed incredibly well

---

#Happy that the world is gonna end >:)

**babadork** (11): One of my favorite songs from last year. I put it on too many of my playlists.

**bbfan132** (10): this is so so good ugh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I'm so into this. Love that driving intense sound!

**hikkaru** (10): my songeniality vote bc ik y'all're gonna do this one dirty

**plastichaxan** (10): I'M HAPPY THAT THE WORLD IS GONNA END

**qazz23** (10): Khaos x10

**SamuelMashups** (10): Reminded me of an anime opening theme song. Felt like I was going down in the gates of Hell.

**seanderlust** (10): that chorus is so nice after the verse of uh...well, chaos I guess

**throwaway7650** (10): this will be Robbed x4 simply because it's a (more)/deluxe track

**waluigiest** (10): okay now THIS??? this is what I wanted. It gives amazing aggressive exciting energy before it comes up for air

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Was a contender for my 11 its just such an amazing song I wish it was longer

**xavieryes** (10): The bonus tracks here really go hard and this is probably the one that goes the hardest

**xxipil0ts** (10): I love the screams she had here! I'm happy that Poppy has gone metal.

**steelstepladder** (9.6): and y’all say we can’t rate System Of A Down because they’re too rock smh. Nu Metal rate part 2 is coming!!!

**Brendon-Urine** (9): the winner from the deluxe tracks for sure. the chorus melody is so smooth

**celladonn** (9): Easily the best bonus track

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i love you babymetal

**endcreditouilles** (9): thank god it's not just 3

**runaway3212** (9): This song would be better if Grimes did it sorry

**sage** (9): people died

**static\_int\_husp** (9): really love the energy here

**whoisValensi** (9): I'M HAPPY THAT THE WORLD IS GONNA END!!!!! This is the only deluxe track I "claim". Honestly she should have put this on the regular album and idk why she didn't. (Assuming it was something like not having it done in time.)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): x4? do you really think popheads does math?

#Not fully khaotic, but khaos-curious

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This has strong Sailor Moon villain energy!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this was a 10 until the refrain came on...girl just ditch the pop already

**wavingwolves** (8.4): i love this cartoon network animation song

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Khaos x4 is a lot tbh, Khaos x2 was already too much, but at least this isn’t Khaos x7

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This song makes me feel like a true rock n’ roller! It’s a little uncomfortable.

**duochromepalmtree** (8): I would have an absolute panic attack if I saw this song live but it really is incredible. This is probably the best summation of the album. If someone asked me what the album sounds like I’d play this.

**jasannn** (8): feels like a video game song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): thoroughly enjoyable

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): the chad khaosx4 vs the virgin before the fever

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Pokemon gym music instrumental yessss

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.5): Truly Chaotic feat. Britney Spears

**imbaby122** (7.5): the refrain gives mega 2000s energy i like it :)

**jman457** (7.5): pretty solid for the bonus

**TiltControls** (7.5): I really like the last minute of the song, but I still don't know if it's worth justifying the first half

**BeauMeringue212** (7.2): It's giving Sonic Heroes but I kinda don't mind it lol

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): KHAOS KHAOS KHAOS. A cousin to Concrete in sound, but more dread in the lyrics. Still, fun as hell.

**skargardin** (7): these bonus tracks are nice

#Picking up after Poppy's mess >:(

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I'm... disturbed.

**1998tweety** (6.5): bops a bit

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): it lives up to the title

**fairytalehigh** (6): strikes me as a bit too much "i'm not like other girls!"--a vibe poppy thankfully avoids for most of the rest of the album--but the guitars go the fuck off

**UselessTacooo** (6): chaoschaoschaoschaosissoossokwzkjzoaksbduakdd

**Vultuxe** (6): i like it all except the chorus

**IIIHenryIII** (5): it's giving Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi show

**seaofblasphemy** (5): Uh khaos..

**vayyiqra** (5): Well, as abrasive as this is, it does kind of bang. I don't hate it. It does have some screaming which I've been open about hating on this album, which is a drawback, and also a lot of abrupt tempo changes, which I also don't care for. It does at least succeed at being, well, chaotic, so there's that.

**cherryices** (4.2): i could see this being an undertale battle theme

**frogaranaman** (4): maybe metal just isn't my thing

**akanewasright** (11): So. Here it is. My 11, finally exiting. Kinda shocked it made it this far, to be honest. I don’t really know how to describe the situation that led me to falling hopelessly in love with this song without saying too much, because honestly this is something I will not talk about, even with most of my friends. To be as non-specific as possible… let’s just say I had to let go of someone in my life for a little while. Someone I really, really, really loved. I was a complete mess. I was crying hard at least daily, and I was embarrassed of how obviously not okay I felt. Like it seemed like everyone could figure out exactly what was happening to me when I wanted nothing more but to hide it from all but a few people. It was taking genuine *work* to learn how to be okay again, and progress was slow and humiliating. The chorus of the song kind of read my mind about how embarrassing this was. And… the second verse may as well have read my diary and adapted it into a few short lines. This was a situation where there was one song that matched what I was feeling, and I’ll forever be in its debt for being there for me when I needed it. It’s a fantastic closer and song in general, and I’m glad it made it this far, especially as a non single.

**Awkward\_King** (10): God this is a brilliant song, I'd honestly be tempted to 11 this if akane wasn't already. It's so so so well written, so many amazingly personal lyrics that are also relatable on a human level. And musically it's also just catchy as fuck. Probably one of my favourite closing tracks of all time, the "everything I thought I wanted I changed my mind and I forgot it all" is insanely brilliant.

#Scholars of life

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Easily the strongest closer in this rate. And the sheer relatability of these lyrics. Humans really do be screwing up for everyone to see.

**ReallyCreative** (11): I love this song, it's such an amazing closer. I don't anticipate it doing super well in the rate but it's one of my favorite Allie X songs

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (11): Ugh, I relate!!! You can tell how personal of a song this is and I love that. This is my favorite!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That last line floors me every time. Ending the album on that note is perfect.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): The twangy tinges and Allie looking out to the highs and lows of everyday life but with quite an optimistic lookout amidst the unhealthier means heard before makes for a refreshing end

**jman457** (10): This album starts and ends on a real strong note

**nt96** (10): My least favorite subject may be math but I know that the X in Allie X stands for 10 and that’s what I'm giving this song and album.

**pheromenos** (10): i love

**runaway3212** (10): I have no idea wtf this song is about but it feels relatable

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this reaches me in the same way Halsey’s Still Learning does, a self-improvement anthem

**skargardin** (10): ALL IN ALL IN ALL, IT'S JUST A MEMORY

**stryxen** (10): this was the song i would always put on last year for a little pickup its so feel good so nonchalant so relatable so cathartic etc

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): slept on but i am AWAKE!!!!!!!!!

**throwaway7650** (10): really cute song and lyrics, also unfortunately relatable

**Vultuxe** (10): really interesting theme, it's cute, i kept returning to it

**wavingwolves** (10): this song is for gay people who were awful in P.E. and were constantly picked the last for team formations

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): I'm really glad Allie decided to end the album on a more hopeful note, and this track is just a really sweet, and sadly relatable ending.

**bbfan132** (9): very nice outro!!! i enjoyed this

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh this was a lovely little surprise at the end!

**duochromepalmtree** (9): I think this is such a gorgeous closer for this album. And I love the way she describes it. The album is her reflecting on the pain she felt as she was younger but you don’t grow up and immediately heal. She’s still working. It’s still sometimes embarrassing. But it’s worth the progress. I love the hopeful note this song leave us on even as it reminds us how flawed we are.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): One of my favorites on the record. The chorus soars in comparison to the rather stark instrumental of the verses, but the biggest thing for me here is that this song does a wonderful job using space (it makes the chorus pop more). It also serves as a good closing track to me as well.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): that's a really solid closer, but what a horrible title

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is cute

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): the lyrics feel very earnest to me. I really like her songwriting and I think it's a good album closer

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): bop

**imbaby122** (8.2): something about this song gives distinct early 2000s movie vibes. the lyrics are so hard hitting and relatable. sonically the verses aren’t my favorite but the choruses are so lush. the badabadas in this song are much more fitting.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I like the idea of this song and it sounds really nice. I like Allie the best in these sweeping songs with layered harmonies. I could live without these doot-doot-doots (can't live without Wild Side's doot-doot-doots)

**fairytalehigh** (8): sorry i'm learning in public this way, i'm falling for you, i'm falling for you

**SamuelMashups** (8): The message of this song is so meaningful, a lot of people do not want to grow up and learn from their mistakes.

**TiltControls** (8): Learning? In ~~a rate reveal~~ public!? It's more likely than you think

**UselessTacooo** (8): a great closer. Not my favourite from the album but it’s pretty good.

**vayyiqra** (8): Thankfully after the dark and disturbing "Life of the Party" and "Madame X", Allie ends this album on a much-needed upbeat note. I really like the theme of its being about accepting that everyone is flawed and always learning. Can we get more of that here?

**sage** (7.8): bop

**LesApfels** (7.5): It reminds me of the We Bare Bears theme song

#Why does it have to be my least favorite subject...

**seaofblasphemy** (6.5): It’s alright

**frogaranaman** (6): me when I found out Alaska was the 49th state instead of the 50th

**iniekcja\_** (6): it's cute but unnecessary

**jasannn** (5.5): reminds me of In A Dream but not as good

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): not the strongest one in the album

**Island715** (5): pretty mediocre but somehow works better as a closer than madame x

**whoisValensi** (4): I wanted to like this one more, I did. But here I am. Shame that this album is quite varied in quality for me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): aurrkay and we’re back to awfully boring songs

**akanewasright** (7): To be quite honest I’m a little confused as to how this did so well. This has kind of always been my least favorite on the album, and while I still at least *like* it… this song PALES in comparison to the others on the album lyrically and the verse melody is kind of lame. The chorus has a neat little swing to it, and I like the production a lot, but like… you really almost made this day 3. Interesting.

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): Listen, I just find this song so.... idk empty? Compared to the rest of the album. I don't think it adds anything that isn't already shown and frankly I think I'm also harbouring resentment from this being the second song released and me having so many plays of it to try and make myself like it.

---

#Baby I swear it's deja vu

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Deserved a video

**babadork** (10): The combination of the dreamy atmosphere and nostalgia is very effective

**endcreditouilles** (10): this song has me SWEATY

**qazz23** (10): Nice smooth synthy sound (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): so sexxy and hot wow yum

**sage** (10): the production on the verses alone makes this a 10

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I absolutely cannot get sick of this song, it plays at my work and I somehow still don’t hate it

**throwaway7650** (10): groovy as hell, might be my favorite non-ballad on cape god

**vayyiqra** (10): Another song with shuffle beats - I can never get tired of those. It's also just very catchy. In fact - Allie said this song was inspired by "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" by Tears for Fears, one of the best pop songs ever, so that's taste. That explains why I love this. Everything here, the beat, the synths, the bass, the vocals, it all comes together so well, and using a glockenspiel (I'm pretty sure that's what it is) because it sounds like a bell is a genius touch. In fact I'd say the most underrated thing about this album is the instrumental performances on it. Next time you listen to this album try to pay attention to what the bass and synth and drums are doing on this album.

**Vromega** (10): Instantly fell in love with this song. The chorus is absolutely gorgeous.

**Vultuxe** (10): it's such a subtle bop

**wavingwolves** (10): there's something so hypnotizing about this basic ass song

**whoisValensi** (10): I do love a good synth-y bassline, will not lie about that. The usage of bells in this is pretty damn good too. Also this is quite catchy. Defo my favorite from this album so far.

**steelstepladder** (9.9): A 9.9 for the time my last fm got stuck on this song and couldn’t scrobble anything for like two weeks

**plastichaxan** (9.5): is this the moment to talk about how Iris Van Herpen is such an amazing designer like the moment i saw Allie wear the dress she wears in the cover for this i knew this album would slay

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**bbfan132** (9): :daisybop:

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the baseline is fire

**skargardin** (9): The single cover art for this where she's wearing Iris van Herpen couture lives in my mind rent free

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Ok, we're building up. Ooh this ones got a little bounce to it! Ok, but why does this sound like it could be an Ariana Grande song? I think from a production stand point, this one is my favorite from her.

**waluigiest** (9): the harmonies! the bassline!

**imbaby122** (8.7): this is the song that got me into allie x. how could u not with that bass line? soooooo hot and sexy. sooooo groovy and funky.

#Do you get deja vu when this song's with you?

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): giving goth jessie ware

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): the bass

**seaofblasphemy** (8.5): Love that bass bounce

**TiltControls** (8.5): you can ring my bell-ell-ell, ring my bell

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The only negative thing I can say is that it feels a little too long.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): you can ring my bell

**duochromepalmtree** (8): okay this comment is for the one other person who has read the maddest obsession by Danielle Lori so if that’s not you keep scrolling. Hey, how Gianna and Christian is this song!!! Omg!

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): One of the interesting uses of minimal soundscapes in Cape God

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): Another really catchy song that almost feels like a deep electro pop sounding type song in a way. I love this chorus as well, and I bet if you gave this to a big pop name like Ariana, this would have been an easy top 10 hit.

**Island715** (8): Amazing bass all songs need bass like this

**jasannn** (8): yass charlie puth go off

**SamuelMashups** (8): This one is very different from what she usually does. I was quite impressed.

**stryxen** (8): minecraft villagers when there’s a raid

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): love the groove on this

**jman457** (7.7): better songs here but i dig the baseline

**bigbigbee** (7.5): If So You Think You Can Dance were still on, this song would be a banger of a choice. Wait, what? SYTYCD hasn’t been canceled yet? That can’t be right

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's a little dull compared to the rest of the album

**UselessTacooo** (7.1): this comfortably fits into the “your fun but you don’t have a whole lot going for you” category, and tbh I don’t mind. I’ll listen to it, but it isn’t one of the tracks I actively seek out.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): ok corny as hell but this song literally does ring a bell.. that chime line/main melody is RIGHT on the tip of my tongue

**runaway3212** (7): You should not trust bells they're a tool from zeus to distract you from your work so you fuck zeus.

**seanderlust** (7): ivan pavlov be like

#Old News

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.9): I'm a bit torn on this one. I like how it starts and I like the verses, but the pre-chorus and chorus fall flat to me. Again, I like the "lighter" choices that Allie brings to songs (like here, the bell touches), feel corny juxtaposed to her darker lyrics as opposed to an engaging contrast. I think just a mismatch of elements for me.

**frogaranaman** (6): Youtubers at the end of their video:

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): not a bad song just doesn't live up to the previous ones

**Uberpigeon** (6): this single made me think it would be another flop album thank god i was wrong. this chorus sucks though

**cremeebrulee** (5.3): it's just kind of boring ngl

**MoonlightByWindow** (2.5): this album is honestly irrationally annoying me why is it so boring.. i’m seriously judging everyone who said this was their aoty #noshade
