https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/qsi738/dark_alt_pop_rate_day_1_poison_the_children_make/

#[Hey losers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9Rf9rnXMAEUyXU.jpg)

Welcome to day 1 of the Dark Alt Pop Rate, featuring Poppy's I Disagree, Allie X's Cape God, and Grimes' Miss Anthropocene. We'll be starting up about an hour from when this is posted (aka it should start at 3 PM EST)

Today we'll be revealing from #37-#26, which will breeze by because all of the 7 minute songs are going to be day 3, right? Right???

I'll be updating you all in the thread while my cohost, the brilliant and devious u/Awkward_King manages the reveal in [the beatsense room.](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj#/) Trust me - you want to hop on in and enjoy the utter chaos that's about to happen.

But while you're having the time of your life in the beatsense room, keep looking at the thread for banners for each song, designed by king, featuring comments from some of you. Who knows, maybe you're on one.

akanewasright: Because I'm bored and like plagiarizing my friends (thanks to the hosts of the VGV rate and IPR), I would like to propose... a game.

Leave your guess for the top 5 (in order) as a reply to this comment. The closest guess will win Reddit gold

#These will be locked in at the start of Day 2, which should be roughly 25 hours from when this comment is posted

Also list your guess at the points difference between the top 2 in case there's a tie to break

So if anything is unclear or whatever uh... just reply and ask what something means, because I do know how the results shifted over time... I know way too well...

**akanewasright** (3): It‚Äôs kinda hard to write about a song that does so much to try and grab my attention‚Ä¶ and fails. This song has a very good beat admittedly, although it doesn‚Äôt really progress in any way. It sort of meanders, despite the efforts of ÊΩòPan‚Äôs eccentric rapping. Some people were bored, others were confused, and in general very few people enjoyed the song. That being said, this is not irredeemable - it‚Äôs memorable for sure, and some of Grimes‚Äô parts are pretty cool. It‚Äôs just not as good as pretty much anything else in the rate

**Awkward\_King** (3): See this song is so split for me, because I think elements of it are really cool like the spacey production and Grimes' delivery, but I hate to say it but the feature kinda just falls flat for me, idk what Grimes' intended effect with it was but I don't think she's the serve she thinks she is. Ultimately it makes sense that in a pretty strong rate across the board, the song that was divisive and leaned negatively would be first out over the plain boring ones.

---

#Got plenty of rest in the soul

**Sundraliz** (11): I love the atmosphere of this song so so much and the weird foreign babbling it all just does it for me

**AHSWeeknd** (10): ain‚Äôt that the name of a DC character?

**iniekcja\_** (10): sometimes the sequels as just as good

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i didn‚Äôt even know people disliked this until recently

**sage** (10): idgaf this song is so good

**vayyiqra** (10): I was a bit surprised some of you hate this song. I love everything about this: the drumbeat with that cool fill every two bars, Pan's verse (look up a translation of the lyrics, it's bizarre but cool), the vocals that sound like choral music at a Catholic mass (try going on Easter, it's super goth). I do understand that it might feel like it goes nowhere though. Anyway, to quote myself on a comment I made maybe three years ago about "Scream", another Grimes song featuring Pan: "Weird bangers in Chinese are still bangers".

**xavieryes** (10): Aristophanes never fails

**Vultuxe** (9.5): the production shines here, love the chinese

**UselessTacooo** (9): The underrated gem of this rate. The song is creepy, unique, and memorable. PAN‚Äôs lyricism is incredible (if you haven‚Äôt, look up a translation to your language. You will understand what I mean once you do). Maybe I‚Äôm just obsessed with dark pop, but this is a huge highlight. I‚Äôm sure this will be out early, but it deserves so much more.

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i am LIVING

**SamuelMashups** (8): I don't know what the fuck she's saying in the verses but it's half-English. It hits different because of that.

**throwaway7650** (8): belb stole my ~~banner~~ comment so let me just use mine to say that jolin tsai, another taiwanese queen, deserved much better in EAPR

**whoisValensi** (8): ÊΩòPAN makes every Grimes song she's on like 1000x better istfg.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (8): SCREAM's ender

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): I like the industrial-tinged sound of this song. I like Pan or Aristophanes' rapping, it adds a frantic pace to the whole song that creates a cool contrast.

**1998tweety** (7.5): the feature carries this

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): ended the killers

**bbfan132** (7): the production is excellent, i wish the song had a bit more going for it though

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): I know my appreciation of SCREAM is not widespread, but I have to say that Darkseid just doesn't hit like it

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I truly felt when she said bashiihhgddyuikngffdgiknbcdyubc

**plastichaxan** (7): their collabs are always underrated but i have to admit this isn‚Äôt near the best in the rate

**sarcasticsobs** (7): some cool ideas in here, doesn‚Äôt quite come together

akanewasright: # Doesn't move their body anymore

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Yeah I did give this a +0.5 for the Mandarin bits, SUE ME!

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): so torn - I loved this song and played it to death when the album came out but it's soured for me.

**seaofblasphemy** (6.5): Feels a bit incomplete

**duochromepalmtree** (6): this song is honest to God scary but the production is so deep and haunting. It‚Äôs very cool. I listened to this entire rate in the room with my 3 year old (I‚Äôm a great mom) and this was the one that made him finally ask me to turn my music down lol.

**frogaranaman** (6): how many comments are there going to be like "girl idk what they're saying but I'm living for it" not realizing it's an entirely different language

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): So apparently this was a rap beat Grimes had made for a hip hop artist that never used it. The beat itself is great and I like the chorus, but the rest doesn't resonate much with me here. Kinda feels like how Scream from Art Angels didn't really fit the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I feel like grimes and PAN are trying to possess me but this also goes no where ?

**nt96** (6): The weird singing gives me elven vibes amidst an industrial cyberpunk universe, pretty neat I guess.

**qazz23** (6): Guest vocals are ok

**SmileAndTears** (6): I didn't notice there was a feature at first so i thought Grimes was just singing in simlish which... can you blame me? That's totally something she would do

**stryxen** (6): i love this song but it's really not good but i love it. you know?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): points for being interesting

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): What in the world?!?! I have no clue what's going on. Wait, the english lyrics are actually pretty dark. Umm...

**Uberpigeon** (6): nobody moved (their bodies anymore)

**seanderlust** (5.7): spookie

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): y‚Äôknow, it‚Äôs interesting‚Ä¶ or at least what PAN is doing is.

**mrmoody112** (5): i can‚Äôt get behind this featured artist i skip SCREAM and i skipped this for the longest time but the beat slaps

**ReallyCreative** (5): this feels very not for me but also a little amateurish?

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): considering how much crazy fun SCREAM was, I was excited for another Aristophanes collab, but instead we got this wet blanket of a song‚Ä¶ it DOES kinda sounds like something you'd hear at a demonic mass, which fits the vibe Grimes was going for I guess, but it ultimately leaves me feeling empty

**BeauMeringue212** (4): go girl give us nothing

**cashewconstellation** (4): what the fuck

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): There‚Äôs a reason Lil Uzi Vert didn‚Äôt want this

**hikkaru** (4): i genuinely thought the vocals were grimes just being incomprehensible as she usually is until i realized they were not in english

**Raykel** (4): Listen, I loved SCREAM on Art Angels, but this sounds like they were trying to recreate that shock and instead made a pretty boring track.

**whatsanillinois** (4): trap hihats is exactly what grimes needed yeah

**jman457** (3.7): Just a bizarre track and not in a good way, also kind of slow

**imbaby122** (3): the feature‚Äôs delivery gives me anxiety just the way she‚Äôs gasping for air :( the song also doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere.

**bulforster** (2): Pan's rapping doesn't fit the beat at all, which is disappointing since she killed SCREAM.

**mudkip1** (2): what's enjoyable about this? its bleakness is almost stunning. the production on the last minute and a half kept me from giving it a 0

**wexpyke** (2): : this song is borderline unlistenable, how was their last Collab so good but this one so bad?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): The best thing about this song is that it‚Äôs under four minutes long.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): "we don't move our bodies anymore" girl what are you a yoga instructor?

**thedoctordances1940** (0): this song is just ridculously annoying, the rapping or whatever it is is atrocious

**TheQueenOfVultures** (0): To me this song just wraps all of grimes' worst musical tendencies together

**TiltControls** (0): I'm just not feeling this at all. Pan does an alright job and I'd be interested in hearing more from them, but I really don't enjoy the the vocals and production as a combo here

#First things first I'm the realest?

**wavingwolves** (9.3): someone that actually understands chinese told me the rap in this sounds like that one iggy azalea rap and it made me like the song more

**runaway3212** (6): tbh I think of MK saying 'if you understand Chinese, this rap sounds like Iggy Azealia's freestyle' every time I hear this song and I really cannot enjoy it the same anymore

**akanewasright** (3): This was going to be my 0. To be honest, if I was the kind of rater who 0d their least favorite song in the rate, I‚Äôd prooooobably pick this one. But over time‚Ä¶ I guess it grew on me a little. I don‚Äôt think I like it much, but it‚Äôs not *bad*. It is sonically pretty cool, even if it kinda meanders a bit. But yeah this is about the right placement.

**Awkward\_King** (1): sure

#Reaching out for Day 3...

**veryanniev** (11): every time I listen to this I feel like a main character in a sci-fi movie who has to sacrifice herself to save the world from being destroyed, and any song that gives me such an intense cinematic feel deserves an 11

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is really good i‚Äôm gonna fucking hate it when it goes day1

**moonagenightmares** (10): wish i could give 11s to like half this album

**runaway3212** (10): Honestly I really like the concept of this song, like reaching out to new gods is such a creative concept. I dont love grimes usual quirky persona but it really pays off here

**SamuelMashups** (10): I felt like I was levitating. Goddess.

**vayyiqra** (10): Here's a good time to remember that this is a concept album, and this song might seem like a boring skip to some of you, but it's key to that - the whole idea of the album is about how the modern age has replaced religion and literal gods with technology. (Yeah, I know, it's pretentious. Grimes has always been pretentious though. I'm used to it.) Anyway, this is a beautiful song. I love the line about "black attire, yeah".

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this has grown on me too much

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): this would be used in a promo trailer for American Gods‚Äô fourth season if that existed

**Uberpigeon** (9): babe wake up, new gods just dropped

**Vromega** (9): a gorgeous ballad. A pleasing slower atmosphere in the middle of this album

**sage** (8.7): black eyeliner üñ§üíÄ black attire üòàüåë

**imbaby122** (8.5): sounds like a villain song which makes so much sense considering i just read that grimes wanted this to have movie soundtrack energy. one of grimes‚Äô most compelling vocal performances.

**seaofblasphemy** (8): That piano

**stryxen** (8): great song to pretend you‚Äôre in a music video to

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Alright, a nice little ballad. I love the vocals.

**bbfan132** (7.5): i like the atmosphere but i wish it was more fully developed

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): you have to be really talented to make something so interesting and so boring at the same time

**jman457** (7.4): alright, like the lyrics

**AHSWeeknd** (7): this sounds like it was written for some video game, Angry Birds probably.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): there is some very cool sounds happening in this song but it was genuinely BORING to me. And again I cannot hear a word she‚Äôs saying.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): one of the weaker songs on the album imo but still good

**Sundraliz** (7): I like the second half only

#Bro idfk I fell asleep in the middle of the song

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): the concept makes me think there should be something here but this one only kinda works

**1998tweety** (6): a bit of a snooze

**bigbigbee** (6): this song sounds like a tree growing.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): This is a nice little downtempo ballad with some good vocals, but the meaning never really made too much sense to me. It's an ok song.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): the song ended and I have no idea what it sounds like

**seanderlust** (6): i don't think this reaches the epic heights it goes for so it just kind of feels flat

**throwaway7650** (6): your ARTPOP I mean new gods can mean anything - this song

**Vultuxe** (6): kinda forgettable, don't love her vocals here

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): got a cool vibe but just kinda boring

**UselessTacooo** (5.5): It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ interesting? The whole song sounds like it‚Äôs building to this bombastic pop song, but just stays in the same spot the whole time. It‚Äôs anticlimactic, but definitely not bad.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.1): A song that just goes nowhere. The lyrics fall flat to be at trying to be deeper than they are.

**cremeebrulee** (5): i literally can never remember what this song sounds like . it just finished and i still couldn't tell you a single thing about it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): [Grimes I‚Äôm begging you to click on this link](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/enunciation)

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (4): The last thing I want to hear is c struggling through a shoddy piano ballad. Bin it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): boring srry

**TiltControls** (4): it's another Grimes song

**wexpyke** (4): : cool concept but i really dont like the production

**BeauMeringue212** (3): Snoozefest

**fairytalehigh** (3): Coming off 4√ÜM this is like crashing into a brick walled ditch, it completely flattens the momentum and has some of the least inspired lyrics

**frogaranaman** (3): fuck it let's reinstate the Greek gods this round maybe they'll actually smite people this time around

**wavingwolves** (3): what about NO GODS instead

**bulforster** (2.2): Hands reaching out for a better song, this one can't give me what I want

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): This is just nothing.

**mudkip1** (1): builds and builds into nothing! yet again!

**qazz23** (0): Weakest track here, nothing really interesting about it

**RandomHypnotica** (0): this song really epitomizes the missed potential of this album more than any other. Production wise it feels like it never really gets off the ground, it feels muddy and messy, lyrically it feels like an incredibly surface level and shallow interpretation of the theme, where I feel like Grimes thinks she's saying a lot more than she really is. It's just dissapointing in the biggest sense of the word.

**steelstepladder** (0): meet the new gods same as the old gods

**whoisValensi** (0): Holy hell this is boring as fuck. This track goes almost nowhere. I wish I could sit and call this "gorgeous" or something or the sorts but I could use this song as a lullaby and fall asleep in a matter of minutes. I genuinely do not have like anything more to say about this beyond that because I am so bored with this.

**xavieryes** (0): well this is the most boring song in the rate by far

**akanewasright** (10): I don‚Äôt know how to explain how much I love this song, but like‚Ä¶ it feels like dragging your body through an apocalyptic wasteland, not knowing why, but just keeping moving because it‚Äôs what you have to do. This is, of course, a giant mood and [makes the song I revisit a lot when depressed.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851835432886599761/907880887524425748/Screen_Shot_2021-11-10_at_1.34.17_AM.png) But‚Ä¶ I really do wish this song clicked for more people, because I do think it‚Äôs incredibly well done in nearly every regard.

**Awkward\_King** (4): Ok while this song is still kinda drab I'm not gonna lie, it has grown on me, at least more than New Gods or Darkseid did, it sounds almost haunting and the ending release is really cathartic. Still find it boring, but I appreciate what it went for and definitely get how someone would click with it.

#Thank you for giving this a 10 so I didn't have to be alone up there

**vayyiqra** (10): Another song that I'm afraid is going to bomb because it's slow, but it's so great - the mopey, doomerish chorus about the end of the world was such a mood as I streamed this album pretty much every day during 2020, in lockdown with nothing to do.

#This is the sound of the end of the world...

**TiltControls** (9.5): now things are starting to look up again! Love the progression on this track

**cremeebrulee** (9): want a one-way ticket to spiralling? listening to this song in the beginning of lockdown while you hear non-stop ambulance sirens from outside and your parents listening to the pandemic news coverage on full volume in the other room. "this is the sound of the end of the world" like no kidding

**fairytalehigh** (9): we STAN a gorgeous ambient interlude about sapphic sex!

**throwaway7650** (9): not this song being inspired by joffrey baratheon... girl

**bulforster** (8.8): The edgy nihilism works for me here in a way it really doesn't for my name is dark because of how hard she leans in. I feel like I struggle with mortality more than a lot of people and most songs contemplating it just stress me out but somehow Grimes theatrically singing her own death through a thick haze of distortion with honestly very contrived cool is the thing that's most made me feel like it's possible to come to terms with it.

**sage** (8.5): when this is the first grimes song out and we have to act shocked

**AHSWeeknd** (8): is Grimes talking about SARS-Cov-2?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): relevant!

**runaway3212** (8): I love the world ending with a BANG

**SamuelMashups** (8): Heard this one through TikTok, I'm GAGGED; she never disappoints!

**UselessTacooo** (8): the synth on this track is so soothing and simultaneously chaotic? Amazing

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): why is it giving apocalyptic Lana

**seaofblasphemy** (7.5): A nice evocative song

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): "I can make you feel so wet." I...

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): To her credit, it is a very moody track that does kinda sound like what a fever feels like, but it's still not my favourite

#This is the sound of me rolling my eyes

**bbfan132** (7): feels like a very pretty interlude

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): She dabbles further into dark thoughts in order to come up with some of the best lyrics of the album, and the drowned out soundscape right out of Geidi Primes is a callback I'm here for. All this only makes me disappointed that I don't love the full package more

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): This has a sludge type quality to it, the slow, heavy, saturated instrumental is great and hearing Grimes in her lower register again is a plus. The lyrics actually kinda feel like they are about how we are currently in a time right before climate change will hit its worst.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): just felt like filler

**plastichaxan** (7): omg another covid song she really was trying to warn us

**seanderlust** (6.8): this is so menacing

**jman457** (6.7): This song started off good but ended weak

**bigbigbee** (6.5): She‚Äôs a bit in her Hannah Diamond bag here (maybe even a little Porter Robinson, Goodbye to a World) and I like it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): decided to stream a better song (Fever by Beyonc√©) after this so this would live up to its name

**IIIHenryIII** (6): it's ok

**imbaby122** (6): it‚Äôs a really beautiful and haunting song but i wish it built up to something bigger.

**skargardin** (6): Even after several listens, this has never really stuck with me for some reason.

**Uberpigeon** (6): i forgot this song existed

**Vultuxe** (6): feels a bit filler-y

**1998tweety** (5): meh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): Another song that feels formless and not going anywhere. Just droning effects.

**duochromepalmtree** (5): I just get so bored by the songs where she is mumbling. I can‚Äôt understand you babe!

**frogaranaman** (5): me shooting off my "I'm sick" emails before the flu takes over

**mudkip1** (3): it just fuckin floats around!! and goes nowhere and gives me nothing

**nt96** (3): Pretty much the one track I skip every time. It has filler written all over it.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): i didn't even realise this ended i zoned out so much

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Do people normally get extremely bored before a fever?

**whoisValensi** (2): I'm gonna forget about this song immediately after listening to it... I just know I will. It's just that uninteresting. (Spoiler Alert: 20 minutes later when Nick looked over his ballot for errors, he had forgotten everything about this song already.)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's a fucking SMASHA

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): crunchy

**plastichaxan** (9.8): maybe if this was longer than 2 minutes

**bbfan132** (9.5): this needs to be longer but it‚Äôs ok, i still love it

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): WHY COULDN‚ÄôT THE REST OF THE ALBUM SOUND LIKE THIS AND BLOODMONEY!!

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**iniekcja\_** (9): girlboss

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): serving ALICE GLASS in all caps

**bulforster** (8): When I saw people putting "bleep bloop" as their 0 I thought it was some joke or reference I didn't understand, now I still don't understand them and realise they're tasteless.

**seaofblasphemy** (8): A cacophonous bop

**UselessTacooo** (8): This is one of the two good bonus tracks. It‚Äôs really interesting and creative.

**imbaby122** (7): gets a free point bc i have an inside joke with my friends that goes bleep bloop blop and that‚Äôs it. that‚Äôs the whole joke. not necessarily my style but i like the riffs.

**jman457** (7): Bleep Blop the next beep beep

**runaway3212** (7): im a computer im a computery guy everything made out of buttons and wire

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): gotta love an ode to the music this sub likes that doesn‚Äôt sound like that kind of music at all

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): Girl, what are you screaming for? Like seriously calm down! The title is spot on though.

**whoisValensi** (6.5): Okay this is better than I remember it being, but this is also lowkey just "BLOODMONEY" 2.0. It has interesting ideas but I feel like I've already heard them from Poppy. Ya feel?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Well this is awkward‚Ä¶

**duochromepalmtree** (4): this one is a little much for me I‚Äôm not going to lie. This score says more about me than the song probably

**Vultuxe** (4): it's a bit much, unpleasant to my ears, at least it's short

**TiltControls** (3.5): it's... something

**vayyiqra** (1): Oh no. This is the kind of distorted production with too much bass that makes me feel like my headphones are broken, plus the kind of screaming vocals I hate.

**akanewasright** (7): Yeah not gonna lie I can‚Äôt really argue against this placement. This is probably the weakest of the metal songs, and while I do think it bangs (and like the switchup in the middle), it‚Äôs the only one of the metal songs on the standard edition that doesn‚Äôt bring *something* cool and new to the table for me. The outro transition into sick of the sun did raise my score a little though

**Awkward\_King** (4): Ngl this always felt like a rehash of Concrete to me the way it so bluntly switches between heavy rock and dreamy pop, and I much prefer the opener's attempt of it, as much as I hate to say it this one does kinda just sound like noise to me ajksdjkas. Edit: Coming back now it was for some reason used as the Monsters of Rock performance song on Dragula... camp.

#Dentists

**King\_Tyson** (11): That guitar reminds me of another song I can't remember the name of

**endcreditouilles** (10): BLECH!

**qazz23** (10): Yeah just jump from metal into sunshine pop (11 candidate)

**sage** (10): an experience

**skargardin** (10): This is straight up adrenaline bottled up in one song

**throwaway7650** (10): the dentist instructing me to chomp DOWN on those films

**whoisValensi** (10): ABSOLUTE FUNFACT, assuming my memory serves me right (usually does on this stuff), this is the hardest to play live on drums due to all the switch ups! Go Ralph!!!!! (That's her drummer for you kids that are not in the know, tho you should be in the know.)

**seanderlust** (9.3): when I grow a second set of teeth like one of those freaky deep-water ocean fish and I actually can bite my own teeth it is OVER for you hoes

**babadork** (9): Has my favorite transitions

**bbfan132** (9): i love how dissonant and chaotic this is

**nt96** (9): The way my mind went from Metalocalypse to Powerpuff girls in a millisecond is sending me and I don‚Äôt expect anyone to understand it.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): I mean, it's not impossible if I lose one of my teeth first

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): BLEGH

**wavingwolves** (8.7): this song is so dynamic that it feels like it lasts more than what it actually does without ever overstaying its welcome

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): This bright "bite your own teeth" moments works better for me than the "yummy" Concrete thing. I like the balance between both sounds on this song. Very clever usage of bite your own teeth in terms of holding back tears.

**fairytalehigh** (8): when was the last time you went to the dentist?

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): gonna ignore the bridge and that one part of the chorus i don‚Äôt like because the rest is great

**plastichaxan** (8): i AM trying

**runaway3212** (8): okay but imagine you would bite your teeth so hard they all fall out and then you didnt have any teeth anymore, wouldnt that be scary? anyway

**thedoctordances1940** (8): it goes hard but idk it could definitely still be a bit better

**waluigiest** (8): this is fiona apple with a metal soundfont

**bigbigbee** (7.5): It‚Äôs a worm hole, it‚Äôs a mobius strip, it‚Äôs snake eats tail, it‚Äôs the infinity sign, it‚Äôs biting your own teeth

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): this song is extremely fucking weird. But it also legit rocks. AND THAT OUTRO. gained a half a point from me just for that.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.5): Borders on nonsensical but when it goes the noisy way it succeeds and it blasts

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): there was a lot of potential with this one but it just didn't do what I needed it to do

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I wanna know what goes on in Poppy's head, because how are we going from Horror, Scary, Nightmare Land to La La, Happy, Dream Place back to Horror, Scary Nightmare Land all in just a 2 minute and 30 thirty second song?

**xavieryes** (7.5): this is a weird Lorde demo

**1998tweety** (7): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I‚Äôm not exactly sure how to do so

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): ‚Äúbite your own teeth‚Äù that‚Äôs just what biting is, like, you put your teeth together

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why does it sound like she‚Äôs in a haunted house at points

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the final seconds are very entertaining

**SamuelMashups** (7): - Boss bitch anthem.

#I'll have you know that root canal was traumatic!

**cashewconstellation** (6.7): the album is getting kinda... samey by now

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this becoming just a chill track for 10 seconds is the reason i have trust issues

**Sundraliz** (6): I have nightmares about biting down and all my teeth falling out, this song exacerbates that

**UselessTacooo** (6): hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I could do without this but the disco part is fun?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): I don‚Äôt outright dislike this one but I‚Äôm not in the right mood it WILL give me a headache.

**seaofblasphemy** (5.5): Doesn‚Äôt bite but doesn‚Äôt excite

**BeauMeringue212** (5.4): too repetitive for me and kinda fizzles

**jackisboredtoday** (5.4): sorry to the ‚Äúworst episodes of Black mirror 4‚Äùs but this isn‚Äôt it for me. metal flourishes can be cool but this goes far enough into straightforward metal that i‚Äôm not feeling it

**jman457** (5.1): first part is annoying, second part is good

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): Certainty the heaviest song on the record by far, but it also feels the most incomplete at times too. I do love the outro into that orchestral sound

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): what does this song even mean???

**Vultuxe** (5): too much.

**imbaby122** (4.5): i have a couple grievances with this song. i know that incorporating other genres and especially cutesy little ditties into metal is a very poppy thing but there‚Äôs too much going on here. plus the metal is way too metal for my personal taste. like the switching ears and the really heavy instrumental just isn‚Äôt my thing. the outro is so beautiful tho! those strings!!!

**frogaranaman** (3): this is like if the teletubbies did a metal song ???????????????? I can't describe why any further

**mudkip1** (3): this sounds like it could be a song on splatoon

**TiltControls** (2.5): while I appreciate the rocking output on the track, I can't say I'm enjoying this one. Like the opening, this song is really a journey. Unlike the opening I think it's quite a bumpy ride

#Creme and Vayy had essentially the same comment twice in this rate and it truly sent

**cremeebrulee** (0): i ... hate this omfg. the transitions are probably the worst on the album and that one section in 0:38 sounds like the chase sequence number on some cartoon show. it just overall feels like a mess to me and i can't pick out anything redeeming from it.

**vayyiqra** (0): Oh no. I hate this. The abrupt changes in metre are too much and I'm not into the screaming at all, nor the double kick, nor the overly crunchy guitar, nor the repetitive vocals. That's like five things I dislike about music in one song. Sorry! It is genuinely kind of funny that it has a breakdown toward the end, but still I do not enjoy this song at all. Upon relistening to make sure I was happy with my scores, I was very tempted to skip it, and I rarely skip songs. So I guess that confirms it's my 0.

**akanewasright** (6): This is probably the song from the album I revisit the least outside of the full album, although I do think it‚Äôs very pretty (and I love the lyrics). This isn‚Äôt a bad song at all, but this placement feels right to me - and since it never really moved from day 1 all the rate, I think most of you guys agreed with me

**Awkward\_King** (3): Now I'm not gonna say this is bad but it's really never done very much for me, I think Poppy shows she can do slower tempo songs much better on Sick of the Sun and Don't Go Outside, this is kinda just.... flat to me.

---

#All I ever wanted

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Maybe it's just how I'm feeling right now, but I find this so beautiful. It's patient, Poppy sounds beautiful here. The sad lyrics of desperation and neuroticism are relatable too.

**pheromenos** (9): shouldn't be so commonly regarded as the weakest on the album

**plastichaxan** (9): i love how soothing this is right after how exhilarating the first tracks are

**sage** (9): ascending

**throwaway7650** (9): perhaps unspectacular among the ballad-y ones... still nice

**seanderlust** (8.7): "When I said that I'm okay/all the power you had, it just slipped away" >>>>

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): I had a dream I got everything I wanted, and if I‚Äôm being honest it might have been a nightmare

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): definitely a nice little turn in sound from the past 5 tracks, but unfortunately I think it falls a little flat. Still really nice and peaceful though, reminds me of some KKB tracks

**bbfan132** (8): :poohascend:

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): gets better as it goes on

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I like the way it sounds

**jasannn** (8): sparkly synths

**Sundraliz** (8): Enjoyed this song way more than I remember

**Vultuxe** (8): i actually do like this one, it's not quite as ambitious/obnoxious as the others

**wavingwolves** (8): the ending of this is so satisfying to my ears

**endcreditouilles** (7.8): we've reached the anime ending portion of the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This is a nice serene oasis on the album.

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): lyrically strong but there's something missing in the production for me. i do appreciate poppy's willingness to experiment with genre though

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): she really said let me put a pop ballad on the album

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's nice

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I don't know about y'all, but to me an R&B Poppy album sounds pretty good.

**moonagenightmares** (7.4): pleasant but kinda boring

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): this is cute and honestly i love that it's in the middle of the tracklist. i feel like most artists would've ended their albums with a softer track like this, but we love avoiding cliches

**AHSWeeknd** (7): a jump scare among the other tracks

**iniekcja\_** (7): I always forget this exists

**qazz23** (7): Weakest track off the album, but nice spot for a breather

**runaway3212** (7): turns out I didnt need a suit made out of diamonds who could've tunk

**SamuelMashups** (7): - I thought it was SZA that was singing when she opened the song.

**seaofblasphemy** (7): Nice vocal melody but feels a little unfinished

**skargardin** (7): I almost always forget that this song exists in the middle of the chaoticness of the rest of the album. It's pretty though.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): least interesting track on the album really

**vayyiqra** (7): An R&B beat? On this nu-metal album? It's ... I guess about as likely as you'd think given how many times this album bounces between genres. I'm going to be a wag now and make a joking comment that this is city pop. (It's not really. Maybe a little bit?) Anyway this is quite nice, and I needed a break from all the crunchy guitar.

#...this is nothing I need

**cashewconstellation** (6.6): quite forgettable

**celladonn** (6.5): I always forget this one exists

**whoisValensi** (6.5): I would not totally be surprised if this is one of the first cuts from this album because man... It's kinda one note lol.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): beep beep

**duochromepalmtree** (6): meh. Cool and dreamy but there isn‚Äôt a single line that is memorable.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): The first entirely calmer sounding song on the record, it kinda sounds like a mix of a R&B sound and a synth pop ballad. The lyrics, and also with some of the other songs, seem to all be centered around a central theme of anger and sadness upon how her relationship with her old music partnet/producer in Titanic Sinclair.

**imbaby122** (6): i feel like from any other artist i would like this more but it gave me mild anxiety because i was anticipating rock instrumentation. still a pleasant song. a tad boring.

**stryxen** (6): i need something more!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): why does the production at the end sound like a christmas song

**waluigiest** (6): this feels like it comes at the wrong place in the album, and the lyrics don‚Äôt do the emotion justice

**1998tweety** (5): inoffensive but meh

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (5): What she needed was to inject life into this track. More emotion, more noise or more depth, just... something!

**frogaranaman** (5): I mean it's definitely a song

**jman457** (4.3): ‚ÄúI wish there was one song on this album that didnt have any metal on it.‚Äù Monkey‚Äôs Paw: a really boring ass song

**steelstepladder** (4.3): wtf is this I was moshing a second ago

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): a snooze i‚Äôm afraid but it‚Äôs not really that bad just boring

**UselessTacooo** (4): yasss queen poppy serving boring

**akanewasright** (6): This song is really nice and atmospheric‚Ä¶ not much else, but it‚Äôs definitely a neat little song. This isn‚Äôt a very good closer (as MANY of you noted in your comments), but Don‚Äôt Go Outside is so perfect as a closer that it‚Äôs hard to be mad with this.

**Awkward\_King** (6): This is really pretty but I don't have a lot to say about it, would replace Nothing I Need with it though for sure.

---

#Fuck Bill Clinton, this song is good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I really thought there was no way this would be a better closer than Don't Go Outside, but wow she went and proved me wrong. I love the idea of putting this as a nice little bow on the era, and putting this part of her life truly behind her. It's got such a pretty, bittersweet sound to it, and you can really sense the love and pain of this album in one song.

**SamuelMashups** (10): Sad then it goes hardcore, heart-wrenching.

**throwaway7650** (10): this will absolutely fall victim to balladphobia when it shouldn't

**xavieryes** (10): Like many other tracks on the album, this took a while to grow on me, but now I love it. While Don't Go Outside is obviously the offical iconic album closer, this is a great overall departure from I Disagree, and I love how it makes for a great call-back to the first track, with a similar message to the "bury me six feet deep, cover me in concrete" metaphor, albeit more straightforward and less dark.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): wow what a closer! This song is absolutely beautiful. I absolutely feel like an asshole giving this song one of my highest scores for the entire album because it‚Äôs the softest song on the album but it really is just haunting and perfectly sums up the pain of the album. I had to listen to this one a few times to feel like I was ready to move on to the next one.

**fairytalehigh** (9): poppy understood the assignment on this one.

**plastichaxan** (9): this will be a victim of balladphobia and i'll be pissed

**seanderlust** (9): I love the guitar on this one

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this was me before therapy

**Vultuxe** (9): wait this is good

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like the mellower sound of this one!

**sage** (8.5): not a lot to say about this but its really nice

**jman457** (8.2): I actually really like this

**wavingwolves** (8.1): [very this](https://youtu.be/RnYnyYs-tFg)

**BeauMeringue212** (8): I like this more low-key sound from her too, nice closer

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh i‚Äôve been there

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): The best -and most focused- out of the deluxe tracks; also relatable

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): really like this one

**Raykel** (8): The only deluxe track I wish was on the standard.

**SmileAndTears** (8): That was really needed after all those heavy songs

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Wait, why was that actually so sad? Like the lyrics are so depressing.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Oh that moody guitar line is NICE.

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): it‚Äôs really pretty. I wish it built to something a bit more, but I cant really complain too much.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): ~~Don‚Äôt Tell~~ /s, don‚Äôt listen to Bill Clinton

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): kinda a weird choice of a closer

**nt96** (7): Don't Tell

**runaway3212** (7): This is like if I disagree was a worse song

**1998tweety** (6.5): nice

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): am i delusional or does beginning of this sounds like the beginning of final lullaby on after hours ... not this pandering maybe i will bump this up

#I did not ask for this.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): Apparently according to Poppy herself, this track actually is basically the last song of this era. Literally she doesn't want to talk about her past anymore.

**hikkaru** (6): well i don't think anyone really asked for this song

**imbaby122** (6): unrelatable bc i actually talk a lot i‚Äôm a traumadumper. the track is super chill but one note.

**iniekcja\_** (6): I won't

**TiltControls** (6): rate hosts when someone wants to know if the results are any good

**vayyiqra** (6): Honestly I needed a nice song like this after the mayhem of the rest of the album.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): this one stripped out the metal stuff, and I loved that on sick of the sun as a change of pace but this one just feels like it kinda lacks the energy the rest of the album has so its just boring

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): at least it's tolerable

**seaofblasphemy** (5.5): Don‚Äôt put so many tepid songs on your album

**frogaranaman** (5): me when asked about my rate average

**ReallyCreative** (5): idk about this being the closer girl

**skargardin** (5): I like this as a poignant end to the album / I Disagree era, like it serves it purpose fully. That being said I don't personally care for it much.

**whoisValensi** (5): Again, very neutral on this one. Like it's not bad enough to be *bad* but also there's not really anything super good about it.

**akanewasright** (7): I used to not like this song as much, I kinda thought it sounded a bit generic. It‚Äôs nowhere near my favorite in the rate, but it grew on me a lot. The bridge especially is a really cool moment. With that being said, this is entirely a fair placement for it. This is before we hit any song in the rate I‚Äôd die defending, but right on the verge of it.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): See I do like the chorus of this but the verses sound.... I just can't call them camp I'm sorry I can't I hate them.

**throwaway7650** (9): she ended the anti-vaxxers and flat earthers with this one

**sage** (8.8): smash

**bbfan132** (8.5): short but fun as hell

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): the best bonus track. It has those earworm qualities that make you want to listen all the time.

**iniekcja\_** (8): it's giving but it never actually gives

**runaway3212** (8): I think that blood is gross why couldnt this song be named if it flowers or something

**seaofblasphemy** (8): This feels like the ultimate Poppy Song

**steelstepladder** (8): I‚Äôd really love to hear some Babymetal during the reveal

**thedoctordances1940** (8): cool banger

**xxipil0ts** (8): This sounds like it would fit Undertale

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): Yeah this is definitely a bonus track. It's nice, but does nothing that other tracks on the album didn't do better.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): This is a good bonus track. It‚Äôs like the encore an artist might do after ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù the concert with the big closing number (Don‚Äôt Go Outside)

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.5): Imagine if St. Vincent had hopped into this? I can practically hear the Krokodil mash up in my head

**jman457** (7.3): Catchy but reminds me of 00‚Äôs phone commercial

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.2): This song if fine but feels a little bit filler, like it's the Poppy formula I've heard a bit. Still really good and fun though!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): maybe screaming is fun poppy did you consider that

**imbaby122** (7): this song is very satisfying to my ears! i don‚Äôt have much more to say about it

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): once again...don‚Äôt like the chorus as much ahh poppy why must you keep doing this!!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): She's really dragging all of humanity in just a 3 minute song.

**fairytalehigh** (6.5): the mixing could've done so much better justice to poppy's vocals, she sounds like mud in it, it's otherwise great

**TiltControls** (6.5): a fun experience, but forgettable against the album as a whole

#Bloody BORING I think

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): An ok songs with some nice genre mashup again, but it does feel like a bonus track in that I wasn't sure where it would fit on the record itself.

**SamuelMashups** (6): - At first I was not liking it, then I replayed it a few times to make sure. This certainly passes.

**vayyiqra** (6): Well, this has a nice beat. Is that an acoustic guitar? Really? No way. The chorus is pretty cool too with the pitch-bending she does. I didn't mind this.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): of course it's a bonus track

**seanderlust** (5): ok but literally every person I know with this sort of take is like "don't believe the media it's all sensationalized for ratings!! proceeds to get news from twitter"

**Vultuxe** (5): i am genuinely listening to this song and then going to rate it and forgetting too much of it to remember what to score it

**whoisValensi** (5): When I say I have the most neutral opinion on the deluxe tracks beyond "Khaos x4" this is what i mean. I feel like lyrically she achieved everything she wanted to here better on the EAT EP. But sonically this is boring as hell.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): This sounds a little scattered and the hook isn‚Äôt as strong as most others on the album.

**frogaranaman** (3): interesting. can tell why this isn't on the main album because it's ass but also. interesting.

#So :poohascend: I floated into the sky

**runaway3212** (10): I separate the meaning from the song

**SamuelMashups** (10): The angelic tone of Grimes' vocals accommodates so much with the instrumental. I heard this song after hearing her Ashnikko collab. Brilliant.

**throwaway7650** (10): as the last album I listened to in this rate by far (the other 2 I heard in 2020/before DAP), I had no idea what to expect going in but like the other 2, it starts off with a 10. the production on this track is just immaculate and possibly the best in the entire rate, it manages to sound like middle earth and outer space at the same time. this also doesn't drag to me unlike the other longer songs here (including songs that are actually shorter than this). as SHIFTTE is one of my only miss a 10s, I really hope this doesn't get tanked due to... long-song-phobia ig? pleek

**vayyiqra** (10): What a comeback for Grimes. After the wait between Art Angels and this album, when she didn't release much or talk a whole lot about the sound of her upcoming album, I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but this single hooked me. I remember walking home after work (college radio station) at night and playing this song right when it came out, and loving it within the first few seconds of it. This might not be how most of Popheads feels but I love long songs and I love the "ethereal" sound that a lot of my favourite artists (Grimes, Hana, Yeule etc.) do. Also, the music video starting with a reference to Blade Runner, one of my favourite movies ever, only made it better.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this SMASHA!

**bluehxrizon** (9): the ambient serve

**fairytalehigh** (9): me after thanksgiving dinner

**iniekcja\_** (9): me when I eat an entire pizza

**nt96** (9): I like the little nyooom sound she makes in the background.

**sage** (9): slay opener

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): let‚Äôs acknowledge that dark pop songs about pregnancy are fantastic, this and Halsey‚Äôs latest album prove it

**seaofblasphemy** (9): Would love to hear a 10-minute version of this

**1998tweety** (8.5): mood

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): this seems like the song Grimes would listen to while reading Karl Marx

**jman457** (8.3): Its a bit too long but sets the tone for the album really well

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Or maybe gravity was just super strong that day

**bbfan132** (8): really pretty intro, although it‚Äôs not super remarkable

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I like the layering here as well as all the different production details like that skittering...guitar? subwoofer? dubstep wobble? anyway it's good.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): The atmospheric elements are delicious, the length lets it spiral into the whole passion Grimes portrays

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): We start with one of the most unique choices of an opener, mostly because the song is so downtempo and chill sounding with its resonate bass acting as the perfect contrast to Grimes soaring ethereal vocals. It's a great song which I think might stretch out a little bit long, although I really like how peaceful the outro is.

**imbaby122** (8): in true grimes fashion i have been listening to this song for months and still have no clue what she‚Äôs saying. but the melody in the chorus is such an ear worm. i just think this song is so cool and eerie and ominous. it holds my attention until the outro, algorithm mix all day for this girl.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): no clue what‚Äôs she saying most of the time but the vibes are there I guess

**seanderlust** (7.8): making a version of this for stan twitter called "So Skinny I Ascended Into Space"

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): it's a cool opener and does well to build the atmosphere but i just want a bit more

**Vultuxe** (7.5): it's good, i don't love the chorus but the rest is great

**wavingwolves** (7.1): [me rn](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/626601739835015181/905217107883589652/EEC9BE73-3018-42CC-800D-6C4A14A576B1.gif)

**cashewconstellation** (7): nice but kinda pointless

**IIIHenryIII** (7): way too long; it needed to switch it up in order to keep me entertained

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Girl, a six minute song, what?! Wow, she actually has a really beautiful voice. I actually don't even mind how repetitive the lyrics are, because the production is great.

**WhyDoIExistXD** (7): Get's super samey and tiring after a while

#So boring I slept through the song

**Island715** (6): video game loading screen music

**jackisboredtoday** (6): the moody minor-key aura here is nice but what she does with it isn‚Äôt totally working for me

**qazz23** (6): A bit long and doesn't build to anything

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): me after getting fed by allie's album

**TiltControls** (6): I'm not opposed to long songs, but this could've cut the first section in half and lost nothing

**whatsanillinois** (6): so boring i fell asleep on my bed. gottem!

**xavieryes** (5.5): nice but too long and not interesting enough to justify it, around the 4th minute i'm completely bored and just want to skip it

**BeauMeringue212** (5): It's not that bad but it's nowhere near good enough to go on for this long

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): royalty free YouTube background music

**hikkaru** (5): grimes putting "art mix" on the 6 min version and "algorithm mix" on the edited 4 min version is targeting me specifically :smoothbrain:

**mudkip1** (5): here lies one of the many songs that almost finds itself but lacks that oomph to really make me connect with the delivery

**bigbigbee** (4.5): There‚Äôs some cool stuff going on here but whenever this song is on I find myself checking the time until I can get to the next one

**steelstepladder** (4): This is a solid intro that makes me feel ready for the album! The only problem is that I feel ready around the two minute mark and there‚Äôs four more to go.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i really don't know how to rate this

**jasannn** (3.5): it really doesn‚Äôt go anywhere

**whoisValensi** (3): I like long intro tracks... I like Grimes' music... (I think...) WHY DOESN'T THIS WORK FOR ME!?!??! I actually did listen to this album a while after it came out and it went like 2nd to last on my AOTY list last year (aka The bad section, only beaten out by a lil album called TNA for short...). I don't get it tbh. Like I want to like Grimes on this album but mostly everything just doesn't super work for me idk... Sorry for taking out that rant on the first track and not the album comments but like I genuinely am baffled as to how I do not like this song and really this album as a whole.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): So Boring I Fell Asleep

**duochromepalmtree** (0): I wish you could‚Äôve seen my face when I realized this song was SIX MINUTES LONG. And it feels it. This song meanders around and ultimately goes no where. I‚Äôm not even sure it counts as a song?

#Yo momma so heavy she fell through the earth

**ReallyCreative** (10): imagine Grimes' barcode child is in school and some kid comes up to him and says "Your mom's so heavy she fell through the earth"

**celladonn** (7): The other kids at school to X √Ü A-Xii: Yo mama so heavy she fell through the earth

**endcreditouilles** (7): i think i've heard this yo mamma joke before

#Daddy Elon's cummies

**stryxen** (10): a perfect song flawless songwriting but also it‚Äôs about sex with elon musk or something so it cannot be an 11

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): !r1 honey by mariah carey

**Uberpigeon** (8): someone ruined this by telling me it was about elon nutting in her but its a vibe

**bulforster** (6.6): Mariah Carey - Honey is a far superior song about cum.

**wexpyke** (6): : really liked it until i found out it was about being impregnated by elon then it kind of made it gross

**frogaranaman** (3): why do rich people have to buy the most expensive synths to make the worst music possible about getting nutted in by their billionaire boyfriend

**RandomHypnotica** (3): the sad, meandering, instrumental of this song sounds exactly like I imagine the noises that would come out of Elon's mouth during sex.

**akanewasright** (8): I‚Äôm not going to pretend that I don‚Äôt understand why this song did as poorly as it did. I mean that both in the condescending way and in the genuine way. The song is a bit messy structurally, with the outro honestly being the strongest melody in the song, and the ending bridge being abrasive. However, this definitely got tanked because popheads heard a slow ballad, didn‚Äôt look up what the lyrics meant, and tanked. This portrait of a family that loves you but doesn‚Äôt understand you is heartbreaking, and a non-zero number of users straight up didn‚Äôt even realize the subject matter.

**Awkward\_King** (3): Allie and Troye both sound so good on this song, and honestly impressed Troye manages to keep up with Allie, his vocals have come a long way. I find the subject matter really poignant and touching too, just it's not a song I ever find myself coming back to or like wanting to listen to, I feel like the climax isn't as successful as it's trying to be too, I think it's kinda just a cacophany of noise. But I do like the outro.

#People with parental issues

**1998tweety** (11): omg when they both start yelling at eachother I ascend, flashbacks to my childhood

**Vromega** (11): Their voices sound so so good together. One of my fave song of 2020

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It wasn‚Äôt till I was doing this rate that I noticed Gaga has a song called ‚ÄúLove Me Right.‚Äù I love it when my faves contrast

**BeauMeringue212** (10): this is such a good pop ballad, they both sound beautiful on this

**Brendon-Urine** (10): men came through with this rate. Troye and Allie singing together towards the end is stunning

**metanoira** (10): this took some time to click, but it did.

**mudkip1** (10): so good omfg

**plastichaxan** (10): the one time i hope misandry doesn't win

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Is this the song I have my oversharing trauma-dumping comment on, or will it be Regulars? #homeschooledkidproblems

**seanderlust** (10): oh you love me? name every me.

**throwaway7650** (10): first of all, allie's vocals on this song are absolutely insane, props to her (and troye, who complimented allie's voice super well). the meaning behind the lyrics is also unfortunately too relatable to me and I think even if you don't relate to them (good 4 u, happy and healthy etc.) the lyrics paint the situation depressingly well. I also have a bit of an out-there association with this song, which is that it reminds me a lot of lullaby by hofeldt. I performed it in middle school orchestra and have good memories associated with that, which makes this a biased 11 contender for me, idc!

**TiltControls** (10): praying against balladphobia (part deux) and misandry

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Not another amazing song that isn't even gonna make it past day 1 because r/popheads is balladphobic.

**imbaby122** (9.7): my daddy issues anthem. finally someone gets it and not in a ‚Äúlana del rey i want to fuck an old man way‚Äù but in a ‚Äúmy dad left me to have a new family and now he has a baby named after melania trump who was born on my birthday and i can tell he misses me and i miss the fonder memories i have of him but he was also evil‚Äù way. also the vocal performance on this song. omfg. so dramatic in the best way.

**Vultuxe** (9.5): the last chorus slightly devolving into unhinged craziness is excellence and makes the song

**fairytalehigh** (9): love troye's part and those CRASHING cymbals

**IIIHenryIII** (9): she sounds amazing on this track, and Troye is not left behind, they complement each other's voice beautifully. I absolutely love this, but it's still not a 10

**nt96** (9): The chorus gave me Lana vibes until the climax ended up surpassing her in every way, as expected from Ms. X.

**SamuelMashups** (9): Now THAT WAS UNEXPECTED! The combo of Allie & Troye's voices, chefs kiss!

**UselessTacooo** (9): this is such a stunning ballad. This is Allie‚Äôs vocal capabilities fully fleshed out. Also, Troye, someone who I had entirely wrote off as a generic pop boy, slays on this. I‚Äôm a big fan to say the least.

**celladonn** (8.5): Ugh these lyrics, this idea of knowing your family loves you but also knowing that they'll never really understand you or see you as you truly are. Her mind

**cherryices** (8): who can relate WOO!

**vayyiqra** (8): Kind of meta comment not having to do with the song itself, but I really like how Allie and Troye met just because he loved her music, and then they talked online and decided to work together. Friendship goals. Having said that, I feel bad not giving this a higher score because 1. balladophobia and 2. Popheads' weird dislike of Troye means this won't get far. I do like it though and get a strong Lana Del Rey vibe from the chorus. Anyone else?

**waluigiest** (8): but üò´ you love me ‚ù§Ô∏è raw üçÜ

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): This song is working for me. The vocal layering create an ominous effect. I think the directness of this song minus any attempts to me sarcastic (or sad song + boppy music effects thing) makes this song work for me. Her and Tryoe sound good together.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): why does troye sound kind of different here, still good tho

**bbfan132** (7.5): nice duet!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): big lana vibes

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): Way too drawn out and slow for its own good, and while it's not better than Need You in the Allie duet department, I do have an appreciation for how tender each character in this relationship comes across as

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): okay so she does actually know how to make a good song?!

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I don't really expect this to do well at all but it's still cute

#Still talks to their parents

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): Allie and Troye's voices compliment each other really nicely, unfortunately the song itself is a little boring to me.

**jman457** (6.7): Sounds like a Born to die reject

**duochromepalmtree** (6): I was so ready to LIVE for this song but it just sort of happened and bored me. Bummer because I love their voices together but the song left no impression on me.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): Found this to be more of a radio type hit, kinda simplistic, although I guess the vocal performances are nice. Not my favorite.

**ReallyCreative** (6): love the messaging of this, but the song itself doesn't really work for me

**seaofblasphemy** (6): Forgettable duet

**cremeebrulee** (5.7): ok i did enjoy this more after learning its about their relationships to their parents, but it's just so one-note for me sonically that i don't really care for it.

**Uberpigeon** (5): ok so.. I was going to give this a 0... but it turns out its actually good once i get past the awful opening lines. But those lines drag the song down so much for me theyre so annoying and corny idk why i just hate them so much.

**Island715** (4): What the hells going on in that ending

**wavingwolves** (3.8): they both sound SO bad in this i was shocked!

**hikkaru** (3): as someone with a complicated relationship with my parents am i allowed to say this is boring

**runaway3212** (3): I wish they'd love you right... not for you but so I wouldn't have to listen to this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): The worst thing you can be is boring! And getting louder doesn‚Äôt fix that.

**grey/0x976** (0): wow

**sage** (0): this song is actually the reason why the :audience: emote exists

#We hate twinks... apparently

**iniekcja\_** (9): the twink did what he was supposed to do!

**skargardin** (9): For once I can feel Troye emote

**SmileAndTears** (8): I do like the song but I don't think Troye was necessary here. Miss X is doing her best Lana Del Rey impression and their voices just dont mesh, at least not on this song

**LilacDaffodils** (7.5): would be way higher if it has just been Allie. I like Troye but i'm not sure I like a duet for this.

**qazz23** (7): Least favorite off the album, not really feeling the guest vocals

**WhyDoIExistXD** (7): The troye feature was very questionable personally

**CrimsonROSET** (6): oh troye we‚Äôre really in it now

**sarcasticsobs** (5.8): once again, troye does absolutely nothing for me

**steelstepladder** (5): ummm‚Ä¶ this rate was supposed to be no twinks allowed??? Who let this twiggy white boy slip in??

**bulforster** (4.4): I apologise for my internalised twinkphobia

**stryxen** (0): i always blame anything going wrong on troye sivan but this actually is bad because of troye sivan

#Yeah

**whoisValensi** (7.5): Every time someone calls this a "breakup song", Akane loses 10 minutes of his life. And knowing you guys, we're at least up to a few hours.

#People who cost me like a half hour of my life (this one isn't too bad actually)

**TragicKingdom1** (9): twink yearning

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): who‚Äôs gonna break it to her that he‚Äôs gay

**frogaranaman** (0): I am going to fight these twinks and their drab breakup music

**akanewasright** (10): Yeah fuck y‚Äôall for this one. This was top 10 for such a long amount of time and I just wanna go back and reject so many ballots to get it back there‚Ä¶ but alas, you guys can‚Äôt handle fun. I get that the song is radically different from anything else in the rate, and that probably worked against it, but like‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve got some party poopers in the house tonight it would seem.

**Awkward\_King** (10): Now I knew this was controversial but damn, you guys really tanked this huh. I guess it makes sense that such a pop/synth heavy song would be more out of place in a rate full of alt/rock music but it's still r/popheads at the end of the day so this falling and falling throughout the results was a shock. Anyway fuck u/wavingwolves

---

#Doesn't really care, has purple hair, called little miss bliss

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I‚Äôll never forget when she stopped her virtual concert after the line ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stop the music‚Äù I was pressed but it was iconic

**cashewconstellation** (10): SUUUUUUUUUUUUPA DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPAAAAAAAA

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this is such a cool song that is impossible to listen to just once. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm stumbling around drunk at a party feel of people I don‚Äôt even like.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (10): As out of place as this song feels given the entire record itself, it's such a fun little party song that I can't help but adore it. That dark electropop groove and the playful verses are fantastic complementing one another, and that chorus which sounds like a damn nursey rhyme is tremendous. Oh, and it's the catchiest song on the record as well. Everything just works on this song.

**hikkaru** (10): not to be the most basic bitch in the room but i love allie most when she's on some amazing synthy production perhaps with some campy lyrics sprinkled in so ofc this is my fave on the album

**iloveneonlights** (10): This sounds a bit out of place in the album to be honest, but I love it for that

**metanoira** (10): that baseline

**mudkip1** (10): her live performances of this are a serve and a snatch and a slay

**plastichaxan** (10): who wants to dress up as the super duper party people for next halloween i‚Äôll be the lady in the back with a siamese cat and a really really bouncy butt

**qazz23** (10): Very strong hook and melody, especially on the "don't stop the music" line. This will be underrated. (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is just FUN. Who doesn't like FUN? [put a picture of the lowest scores here]

**ReallyCreative** (10): a moment

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): More like Camp God amirite?? The bassline has no right to go this hard, it‚Äôs as heavy as an EBM song, which is fitting since the lyrics remind me of going to industrial/goth parties and discovering the weird characters of the underground scene (but in an extremely whimsical and over-the-top way)

**seanderlust** (10): do you all have those image associations with songs that are entirely random but you can't shake for some reason? anyways this song makes me think of this gif: https://24.media.tumblr.com/8f1bb31a6fe2543848339b93f78df7bf/tumblr_mtk5ddjk2O1rf8zrao1_400.gif

**waluigiest** (10): Every part of this song is flawless.. i want to shake ass 360 degrees

**whoisValensi** (10): This has the same flow as the rap in Madonna's "American Life".

**xxipil0ts** (10): This sounds like a Red Velvet song and I love it!

**bigbigbee** (9.5): No line this year has hit me more viscerally than ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lady in a hat with a Siamese cat and a really really bouncy butt‚Äù

**imbaby122** (9.5): honestly i didn‚Äôt even playlist this song until a couple months ago. she‚Äôs a grower but omfg it‚Äôs so good now that it clicked. THE BEAT. THE BOOMING BASS. THE SYNTHS. THE VOCAL PERFORMANCE. THE LYRICS?!!!! THE ‚ÄúDONT STOP THE MUSIC‚Äù HOOK??!?!?! god. so fantastic.

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): kind of adore the fact that there‚Äôs a lighthearted party song before the more serious one on the album

**bbfan132** (9): kind of reminds me of madonna lol but in a good way

**CrimsonROSET** (9): is the score sections gonna be ‚Äòparty troopers‚Äô and ‚Äòparty poopers‚Äô

**IIIHenryIII** (9): all the haters of this bop are party poopers

**iniekcja\_** (9): this feels like a fever dream

**runaway3212** (9): This song really reminds me of all the best parties

**skargardin** (9): WE'RE SUPER DUPER

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Allie has bars! I love this, it's so catchy. We love a sad bridge! Yes, bring it back! Now I'm just gonna go around singing "SuuuOoOopa, DuueeOoOpa" all the time.

**vayyiqra** (9): I used to hate this song and thought the chorus was really stupid. Now I think the chorus is still pretty stupid, but it's also a major bop. Nothing else in the rate has a groove like this. The bass just slaps, you know? The lyrics are ridiculous, but I'm pretty sure Allie knew that when writing it. I bet this will get a lot of "it's camp" kind of comments. It's definitely not the most serious song Allie's ever written nor the most original (how many songs have you heard about decadent parties?) but it's very catchy and fun.

**sage** (8.5): this song is so fun

**jman457** (8.2): hearing ‚Äúparty poopers‚Äù was a choice, but its a bop though

**Island715** (8): Its camp it's fun etc

**jackisboredtoday** (8): I feel like I should really find this annoying but something about it just works surprisingly well

**SamuelMashups** (8): Childish rhyme, energetic, cute.

**throwaway7650** (8): quirky! but... the bridge... drags... quite... a bit...

**Uberpigeon** (8): tonight i gotta find a rockabilly kissS... MWAH! üëÅÔ∏èüíãüëÅÔ∏è

**Vultuxe** (8): lyrics are a bit quirky but it's a classic

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.5): It's fun and quirky but also I feel like missing something from a proper big Allie bop

**nt96** (7.5): Allie's got an intriguing nightlife.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): cute bop

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): its camp

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): it‚Äôs catchy but I just hate the words super duper I think üíÄ

**stryxen** (6): the more i think about it the less i like it lemme rate quickly before i think too much

**fairytalehigh** (5.5): i'm sorry, the beat goes off and there are some good parts in the second half, but it mostly sounds like the idea of a party by someone who's never been to one. camp? maybe, not it for me tho

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): started off strong but got boring towards the end

**TheQueenOfVultures** (5): I just don't have a lot of feelings about this song

**Vromega** (5): iirc popheads love this song but i've never got the hype arounf it. It sounds too "jerky"

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): wait this is kinda embarrassing, that must be why I never listen to this

**astrologicalangel** (2): the production is great but I find the melody kind of grating for some reason. Maybe it will grow on me

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): imagine that i just posted 5 :audience: gifmojis here

**SmileAndTears** (0): With a title like that I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't... this. I'm not trying to be mean but I can't believe she actually released this lmao

**UselessTacooo** (0): It‚Äôs cute (derogatory)

**wavingwolves** (0): i don't hate fun but i do hate fun when it sounds this horrible

akanewasright: #Y'all have some opinions on poopers

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): I was loving this song in the beginning. I LOVEEE the verses, I think it's fun and (gasp) camp, in a good way. But the chorus kills me. Poopers? Poopers????? The pre-chorus and chorus totally shrink the song for me.

**jasannn** (6.5): it was so good until the chorus came and all i hear is ‚Äúi made a poopsie oopsies‚Äù

**akanewasright** (9.5): Honestly this was REALLY robbed in my eyes. This is, in my eyes, the smoothest of the multi-genre spanning Poppy tracks. Each section, from synth-pop to electro to metal, is really strong, and the shifts between them feel justified instead of random and edgy. While I *love* the edge that the wilder tracks have, this is also incredibly impressive and really damn good.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): Idk how I'd describe the genre of this song, but the harsh rock and kinda airy vocals paired with the almost like... electronic/mechanical breakdown sounding post-chorus is honestly one of my favourite moments on the album, I wish that was a little more tapped into but it's still a brilliant song.

#Enjoys a healthy bit of child endangerment

**AHSWeeknd** (10): love it when a bop like this shows up out of the blue

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Hopefully this sub, which hates children, will relate to this song enough to get it a high placing.

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh!!! this is from the trailer!!! i loved the snippet i heard from it and i'm glad the rest of the song is just as stellar.

**fairytalehigh** (10): this was the moment i realized i loved this album. giving me Sleigh Bells and giving me LIFE

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the chorus sounds SO satisfying

**qazz23** (10): Genre switching and guest vocals are good

**runaway3212** (10): "fill the crown with my head" - a king before he gets crowned probably

**waluigiest** (10): there‚Äôs enough to love here that I‚Äôll ignore the bland lyricism. The genre transitions are crisp, the metal verses rock, the pop chorus is so cleansing. It‚Äôs dumb, but I‚Äôm into it.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): on an album where I think Poppy can lose the plot with some of the genre switchups, this song stands out as very well-executed

**sage** (9.5): i love the glitchy moments

**wavingwolves** (9.5): sky ferreira stans want new music? tell them to just listen to the first 50s of this song and pretend that's sky singing. you won't notice the difference i swear

**endcreditouilles** (9.3): pOIson the CHILDREN

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): this gives cult vibes

**BeauMeringue212** (9): I'm really loving the flip between her light pop sound to the heavier darker sounds. It could easily feel jarring or lame but it doesn't

**iniekcja\_** (9): baptize the children swallowed inside sounds like a cupcakke line

**skargardin** (9): banger

**Sundraliz** (9): My favorite part of this song is the horse in the music video

**throwaway7650** (9): not poppy pulling a reverse taylor with the uncredited ft.

**TiltControls** (9): LOVE the choices on the track! Don't love it as much as the first few, but it's enough to keep me invested and enjoying it

**bbfan132** (8.5): i want more breakbeat poppy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): fill it with what

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I do enjoy this dramatic AF song. These dude's vocals are camp. But it's a bangin song.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): The deep throbbing house beats are great, contrasting with more nu metal as Poppy's voice is backed by a male vocalist who kinda sounds like Marylin Manson at points. It works really well. That weird minor scale sounding riff with the house beats is really cool too.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I like the random moments of dream pop but I guess a pattern with this song (and album) that kind of bugs me is how it switched genres within songs so much. I guess it‚Äôs interesting but it‚Äôs also frustrating as a listener

**bigbigbee** (7.5): What is it with these major key sections at the end of Poppy‚Äôs songs raising the song a full point for me?

**jackisboredtoday** (7): I love the synths, but I‚Äôm surprised that this one going less intense than concrete or bloodmoney didn‚Äôt make it me like it more. I usually like a more cohesive sound & this is nice but this isn‚Äôt quite as wild as some of the best here

**SamuelMashups** (7): - Erotic, sexy. NASA vibes. 7/10

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): is it weird to say a song like this has a pretty melody lmao

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): It's a good song, but I'm worried about the background singer. Like seriously clear your throat or something, that doesn't sound healthy.

#Poisoned child

**duochromepalmtree** (6.5): this one was sort of forgettable for me and I can‚Äôt figure out wtf it‚Äôs about! The part that plays more on the pop sound is obviously my favorite part. Another great outro.

**imbaby122** (6.5): i wish the whole song was the untz untz part i think poppy should really dedicate herself to jessie ware core. the man voice was very triggering for me üò≠

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): the choruses feel like a vestige of the "old" Poppy that unfortunately doesn't work with the rest of her current sound

**WhyDoIExistXD** (6.5): I'm a little iffy on the songs structure but great chorus

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (6): Even with expecting switch ups every minute in this record, this track feels like it operates on two opposite lanes and directions, and neither are feeling fully formed

**1998tweety** (5.5): it's ok

**frogaranaman** (5): this sounds like a 1975 song

**Uberpigeon** (5): r/childfree anthem

**vayyiqra** (5): The intro to this is pretty good, and the metal riff after it is pretty alright. The backing vocals are really not my taste, but if she was going for 90s nu-metal on this, she did at least do it accurately. This is also one of those "mood whiplash" songs that this album has many of and I'm not so big on those. I do like the part with the pulsing synth and the part following it with that wonky guitar.

**Vultuxe** (5): i do like the production in the intro

**seaofblasphemy** (4.5): Bleh. Pretty annoying

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This stars off promising (by which I mean it starts with synths) but once the intro ends there are just a bunch of weird choices. Poppy‚Äôs voice just isn‚Äôt right to carry off a song like this.

**babadork** (3): Those backing vocals are so cheesy.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúfill the crown‚Äù bit and the verses at all...but at least the chorus is good!

**UselessTacooo** (3): how not to make a metal song 101

**jman457** (0): Just a mess of a song, like 3 ideas that dont gel together at all. Love the new wave intro/verse. Like if it was just that it would be a serious 11 contender. Like not everysong has to have a heavy metal sound.

#Huh I wonder who that backing vocalist is

**whoisValensi** (10): Now taking bets on when the uncredited male vocalist on this will finally be revealed! I have my bets on "Never." ~~Especially if it's M. Manson lollllll~~

**seanderlust** (8.5): (the please say sike meme but sike is crossed out and replaced with "that's not marilyn manson")

**Brendon-Urine** (8): heartbroken to have learned that it isn't Ghostemane singing on this :(

**nt96** (8): That's definitely Marilyn Manson in the background and y'all cant tell me otherwise.
