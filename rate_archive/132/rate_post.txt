[Hello popheads](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/866838013626941470/894583399350693968/image0.png)

As we all know, 2020 turned out to be a strangely good year for pop music. We had an abundance of shimmery synths, party ready beats, and whatever the fuck folklmore was, and that helped get pop fans through a notably difficult year. My cohost u/Awkward_King and I know that better than anyone, [having hosted two](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/laytk2/2020_ultimate_ultimate_rate_the/) of the [ultimate rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mjy37h/2020_ultimate_sub_faves_rate/) this year. But… that’s just for the artists who fit the standard for the average pophead. What about all the [theater kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKmoJudkH9Y)? [The spaghetti lovers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECGEE0OgFBM)!? [The robot turned humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGLE5PBdMNM)? 

Enter the Dark Alt Pop Rate a rate full of albums that were too [edgy, weird, or dour to capture the attention of the sub](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2019-04/26/18/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/taylor-swifts-deleted-myspace-comments-and-pictur-2-12057-1556317102-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*)… but somehow still did. From Poppy’s genre hopping rage to Allie’s somber, synthy gloom to Grimes’ wild 
exploration into space travel and getting rawdogged by the richest man in the world, all three achieve their own form of pop excellence. Each a revered body of work in the three women’s eclectic discographies, they fit together perfectly as a trio of dark, alternative albums popheads unexpectedly took a liking to last year, and now it is time to see who comes out on top!

- *Sit/Stay*

Moriah Perieira had made a name for herself as Poppy, with her YouTube oddity/performance art project and bubbly pop sound. But in the time leading up to this album, it became clear there was a shift happening. Her previous album began to feature [metal influences](https://youtu.be/wbQsxWKfTSU) alongside dance pop tunes, her YouTube videos started to get more overtly dark (literally replacing her white background with a black one), and she left Diplo’s Mad Decent to sign with Sumerian Records, a label known for its rock and metal artists. A transition was coming, it was only a matter of when. 

*I Disagree* is a phenomenal album. Calling it a “metal” record isn’t entirely accurate - the album hops between genres and subgenres frequently - but the album as a whole is a loud, powerful statement from Poppy. She has a lot of things to disagree with, most notably her ex-collaborator Titanic Sinclair, whom she split with before the album’s release citing psychological abuse. Many of the album’s lyrics are about his controlling nature and Poppy regaining control and power. The album was received positively by critics and performed well commercially, becoming Poppy’s first entry on the Billboard 200 chart. - akane

> Everything I thought I wanted I changed my mind and I forgot it all  
- *Learning in Public*

A decade ago I truly don’t know if the tight fanbase musical theatre trained, indie-pop artist Alexandra Hughes had built in the clubs and bars of the Toronto music scene would have believed you if you told them she would release a brooding, cinematic alternative album. However having said that, I don’t think a decade ago anyone would have believed you if you told them said album featured Australian teen YouTuber [Troye Sivan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWlmcncmWus) on a mournful ballad about the failures of their parents, or [an up and coming indie rock musician by the name of Mitski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjYoldxFg14) on a whimsical, pensive fan favourite of the album.

But I think it’s a testament to Allie’s talent that despite none of this being what we could have called was coming from her, it makes more sense than anything else could’ve. Really this was always in the stars for Allie, you can see this style all the way back in [Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_xw1JDLN_A), an ominous track full of dark synths sandwiched in the middle of euphoric power pop songs on her first body of work under the name Allie X, *Collxtion I*. Even on her last project prior to Cape God, *Super Sunset*, an otherwise bright, conceptual ep, was the satirical warning song of Allie reminding herself that it’s [Not So Bad in LA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCGfOyrf4Vs). 

On Cape God, Allie features the grandest production she’s ever sung over, but is at her most personal and delicate. The second song on the album, Devil I Know, features lyrics about a toxic relationship, and expertly contrasts Allie’s ability to write a catchy hook with the dark cloud hanging over the song. June Gloom achieves a similar feat, turning a song about growing up with an autoimmune disease and the depression that brings, into the grooviest song on the record. And how can you forget Super Duper Party People, Allie simply narrating her way through her walk round a party over one of the heaviest bass lines I’ve ever heard should not work as well on the same album as a song about opioid addiction as it does. - king

> This is the sound of the end of the world  
- *Before the Fever*

Grimes, formerly known as Claire Boucher, now legally named c after the speed of light, has had an interesting few years, to say the least. She started a relationship with a billionaire, becoming an object of media attention and turning many of her old fans against her. She felt misrepresented and angry, and she chose to channel that in the most Grimes way possible - by coming up with an elaborate concept to allow herself to play the villain.

*Miss Anthropocene* is an album with a strange concept, built around Grimes portraying a series of gods of modern horrors (with the goddess of climate change being the one the album is named after). A strange concept, but one that works, in large part thanks to Grimes’s skill as a producer. The unhinged pop of her previous albums is replaced with something much gloomier, taking inspiration from [industrial music](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/825502764670517318/894344891759476736/unknown.png), folk music, and even Bollywood music on some of the tracks. Despite the troubled rollout and leaks, this is a fascinating evolution for Grimes and one of the most interesting albums of 2020. - akane

# Rules

* **You have to listen to and rate every song.** We will not accept any ballots with missing scores
* You have to give each song a score between 1 and 10. You are allowed to give up to one decimal place for each song (for example: a **7.5** will be accepted, as will a **5.7**, but not a **6.67** or **3.1415926535897932384**). If you use decimals, please use a period/dot ( . ) and not a comma ( , ).
* You may give **one** song in the rate an 11, and one song a 0. This should be reserved for your favorite and least favorite in the rate, to give it an extra boost in scoring. You do not have to, but again, it makes things more fun. NOTE: **You only get one 11 and one 0 in the entire rate**, NOT one 11 and one 0 per album. You cannot give any other scores above a 10 or below a 0.
* **Your scores should not be considered confidential**. We will share them with your username attached to them, and if your score sucks, we very well might publicly shame you for it (all in good fun). This is just to say: keeping your scores secret will not save you from my wrath.
* Use the prepared link/ballot [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose?to=akanewasright&subject=Dark%20Alt%20Pop%20Rate%20Scores&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20I%20Disagree%0A%0AConcrete%3A%0A%0AI%20Disagree%3A%0A%0ABloodmoney%3A%0A%0AAnything%20Like%20Me%3A%0A%0AFill%20The%20Crown%3A%0A%0ANothing%20I%20Need%3A%0A%0ASit%2FStay%3A%0A%0ABite%20Your%20Teeth%3A%0A%0ASick%20of%20the%20Sun%3A%0A%0ADon%E2%80%99t%20Go%20Outside%3A%0A%0AIf%20It%20Bleeds%3A%0A%0ABleep%20Bloop%3A%0A%0AKhaos%20x4%3A%0A%0ADon%E2%80%99t%20Ask%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Cape%20God%0A%0AFresh%20Laundry%3A%0A%0ADevil%20I%20Know%3A%0A%0ARegulars%3A%0A%0ASarah%20Come%20Home%3A%0A%0ARings%20A%20Bell%3A%0A%0AJune%20Gloom%3A%0A%0ALove%20Me%20Wrong%3A%0A%0ASuper%20Duper%20Party%20People%3A%0A%0ASusie%20Save%20Your%20Love%3A%0A%0ALife%20of%20the%20Party%3A%0A%0AMadame%20X%3A%0A%0ALearning%20in%20Public%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Miss%20Anthropocene%0A%0ASo%20Heavy%20I%20Fell%20Through%20The%20Earth%3A%0A%0ADarkseid%3A%0A%0ADelete%20Forever%3A%0A%0AViolence%3A%0A%0A4%C3%86M%3A%0A%0ANew%20Gods%3A%0A%0AMy%20Name%20is%20Dark%3A%0A%0AYou%E2%80%99ll%20Miss%20Me%20When%20I%E2%80%99m%20Not%20Around%3A%0A%0ABefore%20the%20Fever%3A%0A%0AIdoru%3A%0A%0AWe%20Appreciate%20Power%3A%0A%0AEND) to send in your scores. If that link fails you for any reason, feel free to just privately message me (aka u/akanewasright) using the ballot format in [THIS](https://pastebin.com/q62phSpq) pastebin link. 
* If you want to change your scores for nearly any reason whatsoever, feel free to privately message me (once again, my username is u/akanewasright) or king and we will do so.
* If you want to spice things up, you can add a comment next to your score. If you wish to do so, please use the following format:

> Super Duper Party People: 10 Tag yourself, I’m the lady in a hat with a Siamese cat and a really really bouncy butt

* Anything variation from that format will not be accepted. Here are a few examples of what not to do:

> Don’t Go Outside: 10: Did Poppy predict lockdowns? Discuss

> Violence: I’m a pacifist so this is my 0

> Madame X: (0) She copied Madonna, which is supposed to be Lady Gaga’s thing, so... 

* Comments are not required at all, but they are highly encouraged and will make the eventual reveal much more fun.
* If you want to give an overall comment to the album, you can, using this format:

> Album: I Disagree: Me when I disagree

* ***Do not attempt to sabotage songs/albums***. The hosts WILL NOT accept your scores if we have any suspicion that you are trying to mess with a song’s score. If you have any questions about that, King and I would be happy to answer them if you shoot one of us a reddit or discord message.

Thank you for reading, and happy rating!
