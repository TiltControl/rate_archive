#[Hello recovering theater kids and emos](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/866412790738190336/909263244416397312/images.png)

Welcome to the final day of the Dark Alt Pop Rate, featuring Poppy's I Disagree, Allie X's Cape God, and Grimes' Miss Anthropocene. We'll be starting up about an hour from when this is posted (so at 3 PM EST)

Today we'll be revealing from #12-#1, as well as songeniality, [which you can still vote on](https://forms.gle/mjNnps9iDxmQSYgL7) until we hit the top 5 (which isn't very far off, so get those votes in now)

I'll be updating you all in the thread while my cohost, the devilish and delightful u/Awkward_King manages the reveal in [the beatsense room.](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj#/) Trust me - you want to hop on in and enjoy the utter chaos that's about to happen.

But while you're having the time of your life in the beatsense room, keep looking at the thread for banners for each song, designed by king, featuring comments from some of you. Who knows, maybe you're on one.

**akanewasright** (10): Thank GOD this made day 3. It was right on the edge for so long, but this is genuinely one of my favorite songs on the album and one of my favorite album closers ever. I never realize this song is 7 minutes long because every second of it feels *right* to me. And like.. as a theater kid, having a reprise medley at the end of it warms my gay little heart. It feels like Poppy found genuine hope at the end of an album of angst and destruction.

**Awkward\_King** (8): Okay so usually I hate when closing tracks of albums attempt to wrap up the album by literally interpolating the album tracks into the final track, like goodbye by Billie or lesser so Track 10 by Charli, and while I still don't love it here, I definitely think it's done more tactfully and even if it wasn't, the rest of the song is kind of brilliant and makes up for it.

---

#I literally love you so much for 11ing this

**throwaway7650** (11): if a man sang this it would be considered a rock classic [2] dead serious btw. the first section of the song really reminds me of some of the classics from the [decade from the 20th century idk which]s, I love the soft rock sound that builds as the song progresses. the middle section starting around 2:22 is the perfect bridge between the starting and ending sections... and speaking of the end, the callback to concrete and all the other songs is just genius and somehow an emotional conclusion to the album, at least back when (more) didn't exist yet. would love to see this make day 3!

#Quarantine queens

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I wasn’t planning on it.

**babadork** (10): I love the addition of arena rock into the mix.

**bbfan132** (10): love the way the song gradually builds up over time, along with the callback to other songs at the end

**Brendon-Urine** (10): her mind... the medley of dreams

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): Ultimately I love that other elements of the album are interwoven here in the closing track the most. But everything is perfect from the fitting isolation apocalyptic themes to the progression and those solos

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I love this! It’s so cool how it starts off as this eerie post-apocalyptic lullaby and that builds outwards, and the interpolation of the previous songs is just icing on the cake.

**mudkip1** (10): the ending... ugh her mind

**pheromenos** (10): so stunning, if only i had one more 11 to spare

**qazz23** (10): Perfect closer, love the solo (11 candidate)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Part of the trifecta of songs that predicted the pandemic in this rate, along with Before the Fever and June Gloom

**skargardin** (10): I was fully ready to give this a middling score and then the heavy guitar part that I had completely forgotten about kicked in and I ascended.

**stryxen** (10): haha i don’t do that

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): pandemic anthem

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I absolutely love the way this ties the whole album together, bringing back parts of other songs for the second half of this song just works so well and using the melody of I Disagree elevates it to being one of the best tracks on the album.

**UselessTacooo** (10): I could go on about this song for years so I’ll be quick. This is her best song. The end.

**whoisValensi** (10): Oh I love a good long closer Also love a good long opener, ask me about my collection of 5 minute long openers and how two have the same drummer despite being from different artists... Including 1 we're rating right here, right now. ~~This is me saying that after you stream "Flux" you should also stream "We're All Alone" by CRX~~ Anyways, I actually asked Poppy about the interpolations at the end of this track during her AMA here and fuck the way she pulls the callbacks to the rest of the album makes me cry every fucking time. Idk why, it might just be the vocal tone she uses or delivery but like... Phew.

**xavieryes** (10): At first I found it too all over the place and while I usually love songs like this, something just didn't click... until it did. Fantastic closer, some of the best production in the album, and I just love the outro.

**sage** (9.8): living for the idm moments, love the i disagree interpolation at the end

**seanderlust** (9.8): when she interpolates other lines into this moodier track? all right i'm sold this record is amazing

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): This song has a lot of ups and downs for me. But for me, the ecstastic guitar moments and the end are euphoric.

**Raykel** (9.5): I love when the last tracks essentially loops back and refrences the first track, but not only does it reference Concrete- it inlcudes I Disagree too. It also manages to sound like its own song despite using 2 different previous songs in it. Flawless execution.

#*triangle  hit*

**hikkaru** (9): the reprise of it all wow cry gif

**iniekcja\_** (9): the callback in the outro is a great addition

**jman457** (9): Epic conclusion to the album, love the bringing back of the earlier songs

**Vromega** (9): This song is an interesting adventure between a gorgeous intro and outro. Thanks to an uncluttered intrumentation, for once I manage to follow her story

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): when you see a 6 minute song on a tracklist, you know it's either gonna be fantastic or a lingering mess, and this is definitely the former. The different sections of the track keep me interested, it feels like some epic track from a beloved 70's classic rock album, it's just a great closer.

**imbaby122** (8.7): AHHH THE CALLBACKS AT THE END!!!! so broadway this song is literally a production. i wish the transitions were a little smoother but every piece of this song is so captivating i only get thrown off by the transitions a bit. the outro especially is just pure art.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Very pleasant dad rock (sorry IDK the exact genre) transitioning into cathartic callbacks to earlier sounds. A great closer. Keeps with the earlier pattern of ending strong in a major key.

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): okay the first half of this song is cute and pretty and then you have that killer guitar solo and THEN it reprises I disagree!!!!!! I’m obsessed!!!

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I really love the callbacks to all the other songs on this album

**moonagenightmares** (8.3): first half so boring second half so good

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): big lydia deetz “my whole life is a dark room” vibes. enjoyed the “concrete” callbacks

**bulforster** (8.1): The "let it all burn down" refrain is so good it's p much carrying two of my scores.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): You just don’t hear reprises that often in albums!

**cremeebrulee** (8): the outro is a bit corny, but everything up until then was pretty good

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): This basically acts like the perfect bookend for the album, incorporating all of the different sounds used like the quieter intro to the nu metal and the wild guitar solos. My favorite part is how she sings lyrics from I Disagree, Concrete, and other songs at the outro of the song in almost more of a lullaby manner, but with the theme that "Yeah things may suck sometimes, but it's best to make the most of it."

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is a solid album closer

**plastichaxan** (7.8): this is great i’ve just never fully clicked with it, i love everything about it but i don’t go back to it a lot

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): giving me hotel california but in a COVID way

**jasannn** (7.5): A wonderful closer

**TiltControls** (7.5): Think the back half of the track is my favourite, but still solid overall

**1998tweety** (7): nice

**SamuelMashups** (7): - This is giving me Grimes vibes. I like that this is stripped down, even though the song is 6 minutes long, it doesn't sound too repetitive.

**Uberpigeon** (7): let em talk moment

akanewasright: #Now is not the time to give these scores...

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): this should have gotten the quarantine queen comments the Dua songs got… anyway the first act was really interesting but I preferred it when it seemed like an outlier that continued where sick of the sun left off to when it did the big instrumental shifts everything else here does. When every song does a big genre shift then doing it for the finale isn’t a surprising or particularly impressive climax

**seaofblasphemy** (6.5): Guitar go brrr

**Vultuxe** (6): a bit long, but it's okay

**waluigiest** (6): something is not clicking but I don’t really think this needs to be so long

**frogaranaman** (5): cool closer but also somehow immediately forgettable

**vayyiqra** (5): Again, not a relatable title at all - I'm so sick of being inside and in bed. I need to go out more! Anyway, this is a kind of creepy song, so it succeeds at what it's trying to do. I don't mind it. I even like the beat (the electronic-sounding hihats are neat) and the vocals. The random guitar part at the end is very jarring and not very enjoyable to me so that brings it down. I get that a metal-influenced album needs some guitar solos on it, but so far none of the solos have done much for me. Overall this song is kind of just okay.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.9): @dua lipa

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): if only the rest of this song was as good as this guitar

**CrimsonROSET** (4): https://i.imgur.com/SZJWmZL.png

#Pop-stradamus

**endcreditouilles** (10): she was 2 months ahead of her time

**runaway3212** (10): people say predicted covid as if introvertism didnt exist before that

**celladonn** (9.5): DAE lockdown?

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): queen of respecting lockdown rules

**ReallyCreative** (8): pandemic concsious queen

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Girl, what, a 6 minute song??? Oh my goodness, guys, Poppy predicted quarentine! SHE DID NOT CONNECT THE SONGS!!!



**wavingwolves** (6.5): how did poppy predict covid

**akanewasright** (10): I’m just gonna abridge what I wrote for the year end top 100 songs of the year list: Grimes used the ever-loving shit out of this sample. Two of my favorite Grimes songs (Kill V Maim and this) have come from her looking at a movie (The Godfather Part 2 and Bajirao Mastani respectively), and thinking “I can make a song like this, but add a twist to it”. In this case, she made what started as a futuristic version of Diwani Mastani that evolved into this glitchy drum n bass tune. And to be quite honest I love every damn part of it. I love the atmosphere, I love the use of the sample, I love the beat, and I earnestly love Grimes’ vocals on it. I don’t think anyone else could have sung this version of this song but her and had it turn out this perfectly. This deserved top 10, and I’m mad it got tanked out last minute.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): The sample of this is used so well, and then it's one of my favourite moments in the whole album when it drops at "I'm out late at 4am" (also does the like second long drop remind anyone else of Paper Planes because that always sounded alike to me), and the chorus is brilliant to me.

---

#Out late at 4 am [:coolfish:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/828102123064918017.png?size=96)

**iniekcja\_** (11): most of the time I go to a party at someone's place I stay there until 4 AM, Play this track and leave right after it ends

**mrmoody112** (11): accelerating as the chorus hits>>>therapy

**AHSWeeknd** (10): which time zone tho

**bulforster** (10): Bollywood-inspired drum n bass... I swear she's trying to make her genre fusions as qUiRkY as possible at this point... can't deny this fucking slaps tho, who cares the lyrics don't make any sense in relation to the album concept.

**celladonn** (10): Me when I'm out late at 4am

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://i.imgur.com/DxSVGLk.png

**moonagenightmares** (10): i fucking love deewani mastani

**mudkip1** (10): another chaotic gem

**qazz23** (10): 4(+6)ÆM. Really strong hooks and drum/bass, easily the best track here (11 candidate)

**sage** (10): we want more grimes dnb

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): u/awkward_king’s sleeplessness anthem

**sarcasticsobs** (10): get in loser, we’re going raving

**Sundraliz** (10): I remember when she played this at the game awards and it was the first time my gamer friends were exposed to her. They didn't get it :(

**Uberpigeon** (10): late at night at 4am he said hows the weather in your room

**veryanniev** (10): I just love how chaotic it is

**Vromega** (10): Love the production, the arpeges on the back sound like droplets. Grimes' voice is so so beautiful in the verses

**Vultuxe** (10): my fave on the record, it feels like a combination of everything there is to like about grimes

**waluigiest** (10): okay this is an experience

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): C the desi queen

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): she's a genius for that sample i fear (this is what lack of desi pop star representation will do to a mfer)

**1998tweety** (9.5): I love Bollywood music

**hikkaru** (9.5): im always a whore for dnb

**nt96** (9.5): Makes me wanna ride a motorcycle across the highway at night and get a speeding ticket.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): remember for a hot minute when everyone thought the title of this song meant it was actual written for X Æ A-Xii but it's actually just called that because Grimes is QuIrKy and FuTuRiSiC

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): Eclectic queen! Giving D'n'B and Hindi film OST in the breath of a verse-chorus transition. Though I never know what the fuck she's saying at this part

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): Grimes decides to do her best interpretation of drum and bass here for the chorus, and of course it works awesomely as this thing is a rager when the chorus comes in. This coupled with the jungle beats in the verses is fantastic.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this song makes me feel like I just went on a new journey in a popular Japanese game

**imbaby122** (9): THIS SONG IS SUCH A TRIP I LOVE IT. grimes always has interesting inspo she incorporates it so well here. also there’s something very tokyo drift about the nanananananananana part i think that appeals to me at a very primal level.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): flabster [2]

**SamuelMashups** (9): My friend recommended me this song before this Alt Rate Score, straight out of a video game. The buildup is phenomenal and so anticlimatic.

**skargardin** (9): it took me an embarrasingly long time to realise that these are actual lyrics and not just gibberish

**static\_int\_husp** (9): just now realizing this girl released a song saying "You're gonna get sick, you don't know when" right before a respiratory panini. What did she know...

**stryxen** (9): the weather’s been alright it rained today and i’ve been good! thanks for asking grimes

**vayyiqra** (9): For me "least favourite song on Miss Anthropocene" is still a pretty high bar, but I guess it's this one. The chorus has never quite hit with me somehow. However I still do like it quite a bit, and the lyrics are a mood, since I have horrible insomnia and routinely stay up all night, which is awful for your health ("you're gonna get sick"). Also, the Bollywood movie this sample was taken from looks pretty cool - Hana played clips from it on her stream and it's a historical drama set in India with swordfights and cool stuff like that. I want to watch it.

**xavieryes** (9): is this what she's naming her next child

**bigbigbee** (8.5): oh yes! finally, a song to which I can dance like the mushroom in the Hand Crushed By A Mallet (remix) video

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): i need to hear more of this genre from Grimes at some point

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): the drum n bass part makes me want to thrash around and punch shit. maybe i was a kyle in a past life

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): 2am by Gavin Turek remains unbothered

**steelstepladder** (8.1): revs up

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): ngl I'm vibing to this, especially the chorus is very y2k lite version of the "digital hardcore" genre (actual genre, see: Atari Teenage Riot)

**whatsanillinois** (8): gamer music

**BeauMeringue212** (7.7): OK I'll give her her dues, this chorus slaps

**bbfan132** (7.5): it bops but it’s also kind of too repetitive for me

**jasannn** (7.5): aespa is shaking

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Girl, you need to speak up. Ooh, I love the melody. This one has a nice bounce to it.

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): it’s really hard to decide how I feel about the song, but after a few listens it has been stuck in my bad so I’ll give it a favourable score

**whoisValensi** (7.5): Hey guys look it's that song she did at the Game Awards! Thankfully this song is not as much of a flop as Cyberpunk: 2077.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): the production is great but I’m LOOKING at the lyrics and I can’t tell when she’s saying words. Like I can’t understand a thing and I am staring at the lyrics scroll by.

**throwaway7650** (7): her ethnic hip moment... we got loona x grimes, (c)I-DLE next? :mog:

#You're gonna get sick, you don't know when

**seaofblasphemy** (6.5): Energetic but not amazing

**jman457** (6.1): If this were like a minute shorter I would fwi more

**thedoctordances1940** (6): the more toned down part of this song isn't good but the poppier part at least is

**frogaranaman** (5): HOW TO MAKE DNB MUSIC | EASY | FOLLOW ALONG TUTORIAL | CLAIRE BEATZ PROD. [NEW - UPDATED 2020, LOGIC PRO X / FL STUDIOS / ABLETON 11 SAMPLE PACKS IN DESCRIPTION]

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i really wish i knew what was going on here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Halsey, Matchbox 20, Haim…so many good songs named after the hour right before this. Shame.

**TiltControls** (4): I'm glad this rate was already in discussions so I didn't have to worry about people voting this into VGV

**bluehxrizon** (3): the intro is cute but the rest is kind of reductive for her

**seanderlust** (2.9): its like an AI-generated song but all you gave the neural network was an Enya album, a couple obscure 90s DnB songs and that clip of spongebob doing the pioneer dance when they're trying to deliver the krusty krab pizza

**runaway3212** (2): 4am is overrated, 6 am either after pulling an all-nighter or just waking up very early is where it is at

**ignitethephoenix** (0): yeah this kind of song is the barrier I can’t get past with some of grimes music … there’s just too much going on production, her voice is too pitched and messy at parts, and it just comes off very noisy.

**oliviagodrigo** (0): this song makes me think of kids who naruto run in school hallways

**akanewasright** (10): I didn’t expect this song to be as warmly received as it was. It never seems to come up in conversations about Cape God, so I assumed people didn’t like it… but for a while, this was beating Susie, and was actually one of the top two tracks on Cape God. I’m… actually really happy with how well this did, it seems like most people caught onto the stuff I’ve always loved about it - especially with the sweetness and sadness of the subject matter. A few people didn’t vibe with it, or found it generic ~~or missed the point~~, but I’m overall really pleased with how this did.

**Awkward\_King** (10): Now this was a surprise, I did not expect this to be one of Allie's top songs I was ready for this to be robbed, but I'm so pleasantly surprised at the turnout for it. It's such a joyous song, production wise, I'm glad other people feel that too.

---

#Came home 

**mudkip1** (11): she slayed the house down boots mama yes gawd

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): I think its pretty fun :)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Still wondering if she ever came home

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Allie X queen of writing songs about women whose names start with S.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I’M SORRY I DIDN’T EXPECT TO SLUTDROP IN THE DARK ALT POP RATE

**duochromepalmtree** (10): truly crying in the club to this one.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorite songs in the rate and one that I find the easiest to listen to, it’s just so pretty. Do you ever think about how scary it would be if someone in your life just vanished one day and you had no clue what happened to them? And having to search for them not knowing if you’d ever find them? I think Allie captured the slow burning paranoia and sorrow of this well.

**plastichaxan** (10): there's something about this song, and the album in general, but especially here that makes me feel like i'm in an indie movie

**qazz23** (10): Catchy melody

**runaway3212** (10): Not to break from my snappy one-liners, but this song is literally so sweet to me, like leaving a light on for somebody to come back is such a sweet gesture to me. Maybe cause my parents always did it for me, but it's such a cool thing, like I'm sacrificing how well I can sleep for you to make it home safer.

**sage** (10): i usually hate whistling in songs but i love this song

**stryxen** (10): no cos i literally left a light on for you sarah won’t you come home

**waluigiest** (10): I live for the contrast between the slow emotional verses and the danceable chorus

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this song feels like a warm hug, I found the sound of it ~basic~ at first but grew to love it

**throwaway7650** (9.5): the backstory to the song title is kind of funny tbh... waiting for allie's bad blood moment I guess (katy just can't taking Ls huh)

**fairytalehigh** (9): i imagine this is about a pilled out mom waiting for her daughter to come home from a horrible party. your mileage may vary

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): The chorus itself might be a little basic but everything else is a great craft that taps into some melancholic heartstrings like I can hear myself singing this to the memory of an old friend I lost conta t with, or something

**SamuelMashups** (9): Yup, YUP YUP!

**sarcasticsobs** (9): well that’s a chorus

**vayyiqra** (9): Anyone know the word "peregrine"? (I mean, not the bird, nor the hobbit.) It means someone who wanders around a lot and this song reminds me of my best friend, who is like that. I try to help her with her problems and sometimes she just goes AWOL and travels to a random city to run from them. It's frustrating but I love her anyway. Was this an overshare? Eh, that's what rates are for. Anyway, good song.

**Vultuxe** (9): she said this is about a loving but nonsexual relationship and idk i just love that

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): Sarah where tf are you dinner was ready an hour ago and it's cold now

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like this chorus!! it makes the song for me

**hikkaru** (8.5): this song is about Sarah Tonin

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): the most generic pop song on the album but it still sounds fresh

**imbaby122** (8.5): the whistle is second only to bunny is a rider. love love love the whole song but as beautiful as the vocal layering is the bridge is underwhelming

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): the instrumental could be better but it's just a massive bop, insanely catchy pre-chorus

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Who produced this?! This is so good! And that chorus is so catchy!

**wavingwolves** (8.5): me when i'm looking for sarah tonin

**jman457** (8.2): chorus gives me Marina vibes

**SmileAndTears** (8): Wait a minute... does she fish in the lady pond?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this is SO cute and fun

**whoisValensi** (8): Sarah was home... \*dramatic music sting\* *Until she wasn’t.*

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this album would be much much better without the addition of some of the more traditionally poppy songs

**seaofblasphemy** (7.5): Very catchy

**UselessTacooo** (7.2): Allie can we get an alternate version where you don’t want Sarah back home? I think it would slay #foodforthot

**bigbigbee** (7): The bookstore imagery was like an immediate extra point. I feel that not enough songs mention bookstores. It’s very effective.

**frogaranaman** (7): is her last name tonin because girl same

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Fun little song with a nice sparse instrumental in the verses with a big bombastic chorus. Honestly, this feels like you pulled it straight from Emotion Side B in a good way.

#Left the light on and ran up Allie's electricity bill

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I kind of hate how happy sounding it is when the lyrics aren’t that happy

**TiltControls** (7): it's cute but a little forgettable

**wexpyke** (7): : would be an 8 because i really like the lyrics, but i live in a hub for drug addicted runaways and the house beat and chirpy synth melody doesn't really sit right with me

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): susie kind of ended this bitch no offense

**endcreditouilles** (6.4): sarah stay where you are, there's a bee in the house

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): lyrically nice but too peppy for me

**Island715** (6): Giving this bonus points cause the contrast between the sound and the songs theme is so funny to me

**skargardin** (6): I must admit that this has shrunk on me a bit

**moonagenightmares** (5.8): blandest song on the album, bordering on annoying

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): This....EDM-lite? Sound is a big non-starter for me. Otherwise I think the lyrical concept of trying to find a lost friend, truly or metaphorically, is cool. But the sound is a big vibe-killer for me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): instrumental sounds like something i’d hear on british pop radio in summer 2014

**akanewasright** (10): Genuinely I didn’t care for this song for the longest time, and then one day it just… clicked. The dreaming and longing for peace and comfort, contrasted with the turmoil and internal chaos of the chorus… it just hit at one point. While this song didn’t fully click for everyone, it would seem a lot of you guys are with me. This was a lot of people’s favorites, and while enough people didn’t vibe with it to sink it down to 9th, it was nice to see this rise from day 2 towards the end of the running time.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): It's so crisp. I remember when this came out, it was the """lead""" from the era, meaning it was both the first song out and got a video but wasn't really a lead per se, but the video is so subtly haunting and well directed visually, which is something I'm happy Allie finally has the ability to do with her budget. I did not expect this to do as well as it did and while compared to the rest of the album I'm kinda mid on it... I can't say I'm mad to see the surprise turnout for a great song.

#Currently near fresh laundry

**BeauMeringue212** (11): I really love the lyrics and the chorus is ridiculously addictive

**AHSWeeknd** (10): When I say genius-level production, this is what I mean.

**bigbigbee** (10): A song that slowly pulls you into its orbit with its gravity

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): This was a very welcome surprise after the approach that Allie took through some of the bright, maximalist cuts from Super Sunset, giving us domestic existential wonder and portraying it exquisitely through the song's video

**jman457** (10): Great way to open an album

**joeeswift** (10): perfect song to listen to during S.A.D szn

**mrmoody112** (10): i watched the mv when she uploaded it by accident then privated it immediately yup yup

**plastichaxan** (10): i love Allie's music in general but this felt like such a step up and it took me a while how much of a collapse it is

**qazz23** (10): Great opener, haunting and minimalist

**sage** (10): the production on this is so good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Mood! As I get older I just want to live peacefully and unbothered, and Allie put that so beautifully over a soothing trip-hop beat, making mundane details sound like magical incantations. I feel like my laundry is folded and my skin is clear after listening.

**skargardin** (10): Since I got employed and started working a soul-sucking 9-5 job certain songs have really started to hit different huh

**stryxen** (10): i go insane to this song often sometimes just at like 2pm idk how she does it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): she really nails the haunting vibe to this song omg what a great introduction to Allie X

**throwaway7650** (10): such a good opening track, sold me on allie X immediately

**Uberpigeon** (10): dedicating this to that time allie x quote tweeted me

**vayyiqra** (10): You know, it shows Allie's talent as a songwriter that she's able to take such an unusual metaphor and make it so relatable. Yes, I want fresh laundry, and also to not have hard mornings, and a bunch of other things she talks about in this song. Even without the lyrics the instrumental parts of the song are great, but her vocal performance is great and that makes it a 10 for sure.

**Vultuxe** (10): the track that started it all, instantly hooked

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): This wasn't one of my favourites before the rate, but now I've really grown to appreciate it. When that chorus kicks in… [:poohascend:](https://c.tenor.com/v05kjibQ_ZQAAAAd/ascend-winnie-the-pooh-ascend.gif)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): I really like this song. I love the melancholy, wry lyrics. "I want to attend nice parties 'Round my neck and head, thin jewelry" is a nice couplet. I like the synth details throughout the song. I like the dramatic tension between the verses and the chorus. A strong start to the album!

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): i'm a simple gay, i love the smell of a fresh warm towel and i'm deeply familiar with wanting things i can't have. it makes me feel cozy in a sad way?

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): genius

**TiltControls** (9.5): used to be my favourite on the album but has grown off me a little. Still a fun jam though

**seanderlust** (9.3): reminder to do your laundry besties

**moonagenightmares** (9.1): love the folksy singing style

**CrimsonROSET** (9): millennial lifestyle

**iniekcja\_** (9): the song wouldn't be as good had it had a different cover art

**runaway3212** (9): I absolutely loathe washing my clothes, it's wet it's cold my dryer broke so I have to hang my clothes like a caveman absolutely disgusting. However yes fresh clothes are amazing

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Gavin Newsom in the middle of the panoramic be like

**waluigiest** (9): oh she knows I’ve been craving a clean linen candle

**xavieryes** (9): queen of being inspired by towels

**pheromenos** (8.8): no?!

**1998tweety** (8.5): I ascend

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Hits different when you just put on some new undies straight out of the dryer.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is simple but gorgeous in a dark way

**imbaby122** (8.5): the “no” “ah” part is so satisfy. but the rest of the song is also fantastic. haunting instrumental. beautiful vocals. the build up to the first chorus is a little too long for my adhd brain and the badabada’s feel a little out of place and theatery but other than that this song is a dream.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): really soothing, this song grew a lot on me over time

**wexpyke** (8.5): : this song really hit in the right way at the right time when it came out

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): i see she wrote a song about those of us who make the daily migration of moving our laundry from the bed to a designated chair and back each day

**seaofblasphemy** (8): Very strong opener

**bbfan132** (7.5): v pleasant intro

**bulforster** (7.5): I feel like it's a choice, but I do kinda want this song to have a better climax.

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): no? No!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This confused me when it came out because it felt so different from the more shiny synthpop she’d been dropping before and I understand it more now, but I can’t say I love it. I respect the artistry of it though, it’s a big swing that works (just not for me)

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): it's really good but it's just one of those tracks where I feel it should and could quite easily be better

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): What's funny is that I'm literally doing laundry while listening to this song.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): very pretty and haunting but I don’t know that this is a song I’m going to come back to very often

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): I appreciate that the bass is the actually driving instrument of the song here with her lyrics, and all of the little elements of this song are great, from the little orchestral bits to that almost jungle sounding marimba in the background. Allie's singing is quite serene as well.

#Something has to die [:shrug:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/845009029092212776.png?size=96)

**mudkip1** (7): this one's probably the only miss on the album for me, i still like it though

**Sundraliz** (7): no 😩... no 😡!

**whoisValensi** (7): This is nice I suppose. I will say that the visuals in the video for this are quite cool tho.

**UselessTacooo** (6.8): the production is good. That’s all I have :sob:

**SamuelMashups** (6.5): Basic tune, it gets boring at times.

**wavingwolves** (6.3): around the 2min mark i heard some screaming and i was enjoying the eerie tone that brought to the track but then i noticed it wasn't coming from the song, it was just someone passing my street

**babadork** (6): Is the problem that I don’t have my own washer and dryer?

**hikkaru** (6): no....................................................................... NO!!!!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): really like some parts of this song but the rest is not very checks urban dictionary fresh

**frogaranaman** (5): someone in my building started stealing laundry so now I gotta actually dedicate a block of time to doing it I hate it here

**metanoira** (5): im sorry but this is so overrated

**akanewasright** (10): The appeal of this song is kinda hard to describe for me, partially because it clicked with me later into my time with Cape God and partially because it just feels universal. You find a way to blend in with people who’re different from you, and that feels kinda… sneaky, in a way. But spending this much time talking about the lyrics, as good as they are, feels like a waste, because the core of the song is *that chorus.* One of the best in the entire rate, in my eyes, and in many of yours. I’m a little disappointed this didn’t slide into the top 5 like it seemed like it would, but enough people found it boring that it lost out on that.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): It's just kinda the smasha. Yeah okay I find the lyrical theme of "I'm not like the other girls I don't fit in" goofy but like... it's such a bop, it's just an undeniably well crafted pop song and I love it for that. There was constant shakeup with the Allie placements and I was surprised whenever this fell out of day 3 so I'm happy it climbed back up in the end.

---

#Oh what a feeling (stream 1D)

**cashewconstellation** (11): FUCKING BRILLIANT, HER BEST SONG

**qazz23** (11): Very strong chorus and I love the dreamy sound

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Social anxiety but make it a bop! This song is catchy as hell, and yet brings back feelings of deep pain in me. Allie captured the melancholy of trying to change yourself and putting on a performance just to fit in a group (and also putting WAY too much weight on every interaction whe you feel like you “found your people” after years of isolation!)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): this is going to be robbed so hard i don't even want to look

**Vultuxe** (11): oh how much I enjoy her dipping in and out of her lower register and falsettos

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Me when I’m standing outside with other humans

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh its the unexpected smasha

**plastichaxan** (10): oh what a feeling giving this 10s with the regular(rater)s

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we love and respect those rate regulars who do almost every rate… thank you for your service

**runaway3212** (10): Despite what this pretty woman is singing one should not try to hang off buildings, it can actually be dangerous! (for more helpful tips follow @taylorswift13 on twitter)

**stryxen** (10): i was obsessed with this song when i had just moved city and had no friends that was very unfitting of me

**TiltControls** (10): a bop

**vayyiqra** (10): Maybe the best song on this album - the chorus is amazing. Everything about this is excellent in fact, starting with the opening bass riff. That's not even getting into the lyrics, which are about being an outsider and not fitting in, for which you should read Allie's much more detailed explanation on the Genius page for it. Anyway, a great song, one of her best.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): I wish that I could be like the cool kids. Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): she looks like she came straight out of the American Horror Story universe

**whoisValensi** (9.5): You guys actually go out in public and have ways to fake not being depressed????

**1998tweety** (9): that chorus omg she ate

**BeauMeringue212** (9): Impostor Syndrome anthem. love the minimal sound to this.

**celladonn** (9): "Regulars is about trying to reintegrate into society when you've been an outsider all your life. Trying to fit in when you clearly never will. Wanting to fade into the background but also wanting so badly to be seen" WIG!

**duochromepalmtree** (9): I can’t explain what I love about this song but I REALLY love it. It’s Mirrorball’s (Taylor swift) older sister. Which is my favorite song off of folklore. Obviously that tells you what you need to know about my mental state rn.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): I love the chorus for this track, it's catchy as hell. This honestly seems like a 90s pop rock track for the majority of the song, it's such a great throwback, with a great bass grooves and vocal harmonies.

**ReallyCreative** (9): its a jam

**SamuelMashups** (9): Energic song, love the contrast in the instrumental with the whistles.

**seanderlust** (9): "It’s a very universal theme: There’s a lot of people that feel like outsiders. Like, I know how to fake it, I know how to please people, but I don’t feel understood a lot of the time. " - very that

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): can someone PLS tell me what this chorus melody sounds like i'm begging u

**jman457** (8.6): regular show

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Cole Sprouse I'm weird. I’m a weirdo. I don't fit in. And I don't want to fit in end quote

**throwaway7650** (8.5): allie said stream tightrope by janelle monáe and do HCP yass

**imbaby122** (8.2): im just like allie x bc i also just want to be accepted </3 don’t know music but i think those are synths that r so pretty and shiny and fun. such a quintessential allie x song.

**bbfan132** (8): fun song to chill out to

**frogaranaman** (8): probably one of the best chorus on this entire album

**jasannn** (8): I be walking with the cheese, that’s the queso.

**skargardin** (8): bop

**thedoctordances1940** (8): bop

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Ugh, this is so relatable and I hate it! But she's such a good songwriter!

**sage** (7.8): bop

#Hanging off a building [:nOooooOOooooooooOOoOOOOoo:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/832421629220749322.png?size=96)

**UselessTacooo** (7.7): since when did regulars hang off buildings? Did I miss the memo?

**fairytalehigh** (7): love the bass but not so much into the vibe as a whole, she pulls off what she's trying here better on the rest of the album.

**wavingwolves** (7): what is she talking about

**babadork** (6.5): A little repetitive, but I do like the depressed claps

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): This again feels like some empty sullen folorn song I'm not connecting to. I'm guessing it has to do with being around "normies" after feeling like an outsider. There are echoes of early Fiona and Lorde, where tbh their folorn vibe never appealed to me either, so I'm not connecting to this derivative version. The sound is quietly driving and bouncy with the sad lyrics, I've heard this so many times before.

**iniekcja\_** (6): I forgot how this sounded the moment the next song started

**seaofblasphemy** (6): Whatever

**akanewasright** (10): And with that… Allie is gone. The last to arrive, the first to leave. While I do kind of wish a solo song made it farther than this, it’s hard to argue with this being one of the best on the album. And I say one of because in my eyes, this and Regulars are tied for reasons king will explain. But this song… while several people couldn’t distinguish her vocals from Allie’s, Mitski’s pen is absolutely why this placed as well as it did. This was one of Mitski’s first times writing pop music collaboratively, and it’s hard to argue with the results being anything less than stunning. That chorus is as longing and heartbroken as it is angelic and memorable. Allie and Mitski are an incredible pair, and I hope with all my being that this isn’t the last time they team up.

**Awkward\_King** (10): This won the battle within Allie's album in the end. Really there were two rates going on this whole time, who was gonna win the rate out of Grimes/Poppy, and which one of Allie's songs would place the highest and come 7th lmao. This is what I expected it to be and I'm content, Allie proved to have the most consistent album of the three even if her highs weren't as unanimously high, and this song is just exceptional. More Mitski collabs 2022

**imbaby122** (10): forever one of my favorite allie x songs. is the mitski feature a little unnecessary bc they sound the same? yeah maybe but it’s mitski and she sings her heart out god damn it. everything about this song is so captivating. the bass line, the backing vocals, the outro, the guitar riffs, the lesbianess of it all.

**iniekcja\_** (10): all the lesbians did the Oprah scream

**Island715** (10): their voices both work great in this sound i love it

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): SAD GIRL BOPS ONLY

**xavieryes** (10): Obsessed is no longer my favorite diss track against Marshall

**duochromepalmtree** (9.5): we’ve all been in love with a friend who is in a crap relationship. This perfectly describes that feeling while also being so groovy and easy to listen to.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9.5): Two indie queens coming together to maximize their joint slay...

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): we really said fuck sarah's ass huh

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Alright who's Susie?! And who is Marshall? Ooh, I looove Mitski's vocal! This song has got like a little R&B feels to it. Yeah, I get the hype around this song.

**seanderlust** (8.7): they're lesbians harold

**pheromenos** (8.5): i was gonna left a snarky comment about how this song is overrated but you know what? it's not half bad.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is my redemption of sapphic songs after tiktok

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): good for her

**SamuelMashups** (8): This song really opens up on the topic of toxic relationships, the style of the production and the subtle details in the mastering of the song are quite fresh.

**jman457** (7.6): the better collab on here but wish there was a bit more here

**Raykel** (7.3): I cannot tell Mitski and Allie's voices apart. I would've loved more of a Mitski flair.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): There's a nice R&B groove on this one. Only thing is that Mitski's voice actually has a similar timbre to Allie's, so it doesn't really stand out much as a feature to me.

**jackisboredtoday** (7): I kinda like how the beat lopes along, but this is a song that could’ve used a bit more of a climax imo

**nt96** (7): Easily the most iconic song from the album, but is it the best song? No, that's how good the album is.

#The problem Susie's trying to solve

**seaofblasphemy** (7): Catchy but I wouldn’t have any idea Mitski is on it if she wasn’t credited

**skargardin** (7): Something makes me want just a tiny bit more here

**TragicKingdom1** (7): honestly i didnt even notice mitski was on this

**Uberpigeon** (7): me when i cant get marshall in my animal crossing game

**UselessTacooo** (7): it’s a good song, but I don’t understand where everyone gets the “omg yass best song on the album” from. It’s good, don’t get me wrong, but it’s not amazing.

**Brendon-Urine** (6): i had no idea Mitski did any features, she's just alright on this imo

**IIIHenryIII** (6): not a big fan of this one

**runaway3212** (6): Let's Go Lesbains!!!

**TiltControls** (6): Sorry Mitski, but I'm saving my love for another song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): this ending rlly didn't need to drag on as long as it did

#Mitski save your love

**SmileAndTears** (11): Allie gave us a mitski song in 2020 and that alone justifies this album's entire existence.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I love the funk sound to this, Mitski's vocals in this are gorgeous as well

**bulforster** (10): Mitski's on this song, I'm contractually obligated to give it a 10 (Allie is obviously amazing on it as well though)

**martian\_pet** (10): Mitski send tweet

**mudkip1** (10): mitski ATE

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Not only is this one of the most subtley vulnerable and emotional tracks on the record, with fantastic storytelling and lyricism, but the production is of sublime and MITSKI! MITSKI!!! MIIIIIIIIITSKI!!!!

**Vromega** (10): a dream collab between two artists that were meant to work together at some point. Mitski using the higher register is quite surprising but actually really interesting !

**King\_Tyson** (9.3): Mitski makes this song near perfect

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.4): Ah, I get me a Mitski feature. I sure am easily swayed. A nice groovy beat and great singing with Allie and Mitski. Interesting lyric idea of wanting to save the person you're in love with from the wrong partner. Overall a creative, 70's-ish slinky number with some creative lyrics that cover this. They almost sound casual about the whole thing but the whole premise is pretty intense.

**stryxen** (7.5): i love mitski but this song really doesn’t do much special unfortunately

**whoisValensi** (7): You damn kids and your emotional support Mitski!!!!!!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): mitski is here and this outro is nice so

**frogaranaman** (5): I would ignore this advice if it was given to me like this

**static\_int\_husp** (5): sorry Mitski but I cannot even tell the difference between you two

#Creme and Vayy gave the same comment twice in this rate, are they the same person (Pt. 2)

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is just sapphic treat you better

**vayyiqra** (8): Cursed thought: this is basically "Treat You Better" for girls. Going to ignore that! No I'm just kidding, this is a good song, and I never would've expected that Mitski would work with Allie or that their voices would sound really good together. The synth break near the end is also great. Also, again I was kidding about the lyrics. Who hasn't had a friend who was in a relationship that's clearly a bad idea?

 I love this album so much. Allie X has grown to become one of my favorite artists, and this album is easily her most fully realized. Going into this rate I knew she would get robbed a bit - I knew some people found it boring, while the fans couldn’t possibly pick one favorite to unite behind - but I was overall really happy with how she did. Minor spoiler - this is the highest overall album average in the rate, and every song on this album has an 11 (except super duper party people, which honestly surprised me). She’ll get her win one day, hopefully when we rate Collxtion I (He11o and B11tch) or Super Sunset (L11ttle  Things, Sc11ence, and G11rl of the Year). But until then, this was a really solid rate performance from her, considering everything. She left first, but she made a damn strong showing.

**AHSWeeknd** (10.083): Susie, Sarah, and June, let’s get into it! This was my first album after stanning Allie. I loved the whole rollout so much, the photoshoot, the singles, the videos. It was all such genius. More than that, the concepts of the album were my favourite part of it. I was on the edge of my seat to see how Allie would deliver this concept, and to this day I’m floored. It’s an insane album that captures this sort of strange aesthetic in a perfect way. The self-reflective themes are so genuine, and though Allie had explored those themes prior to Cape God, it’s done in a new tone here. To be completely honest, it’s not as if I relate to it but it’s so well written. I honestly feels as if I’m asking Sarah to come home, or asking Susie to save her love, or with the regulars, or watching the woman with the really really bouncy butt. I love it, it’s genius.

**mudkip1** (9.667): my aoty for 2020. i've listened to it so much that i really don't have much else to say about it lol

**throwaway7650** (9.458): I remember the first time I listened to cape god last year (last.fm says 11/20) I was pleasantly surprised at how solid this album was. I saw it get hype as one of 2020's AOTYs and while I no longer think every song is a 10 (repeated listening really exposes which tracks are stronger and weaker huh), cape god is still a *very* good album overall (see my average). also this album and allie in general just exudes major theater kid energy

**qazz23** (9.417): Great production, hooks, and melodies all around; one of my 2020 faves

**Vultuxe** (9.292): 10 cape god is the first record from her that feels complete, each song is feels carefully constructed. i loooove her voice and the visuals, this is actually my most listened to album

**RandomHypnotica** (9.242): A lot of Allie's other projects are solid to me, but lack that magic spark to make me really appreciate them. Cape God took all of the best parts of her prior work, mixed in a healthy dose of emotion and made what is, in my opinion, her best work yet. I am so excited to see where Allie goes from here.

**BeauMeringue212** (9.008): this needs to take over as the sub's new Emotion tbh

**plastichaxan** (8.958): probably my favorite Allie X project, so consistently good, even the songs that are rated lower still have a good rating and are growers, it’s just a really great concept for her and it makes me so excited to see what she does next cause she’s extremely talented.

**moooo566** (8.833): more like cape godDAMN what a good album

**waluigiest** (8.750): I love when a rate reminds me of how good an album is.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.667): This album saw Allie going into some new and exciting soundscapes of more atmospheric, darker venues that in the latter case I feel had been more hidden since the very days of Bitch. I'm really happy I get to enjoy it, and that the visuals knock it out of the park

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.667): This was such a good album! Everything got better the further I got into it. I'm absolutely in love with her voice. It's so... witchy! Like I actually want her to do a Halloween album, because she could totally nail it. And she didn't show it that much, but I know that she's got some pipes because she nailed those high notes. I love her songwriting as well. She has this way of just perfectly explaining things, but in such unique ways! And the production too! It's hard to actually describe what this album sound like. It's like witchy electropop, but there so many other influences and sound too! I think I would probably rate this album as like an 8.5/10. It's a solid project. I totally see myself revisiting it.

**vayyiqra** (8.583): Being a big fan of Allie since her debut with CollXtion I (she is from southern Ontario like me), I was a little let down by this album when it came out. It's a grower though - with the strength of "Fresh Laundry" and "Regulars" I was able to get into the album more after a few listens and now I like it quite a bit, almost as much as CollXtion I and II. Allie was once one of my top artists and while I've cooled off a bit on her, still I like this album a lot. It was definitely one of the best pop albums of 2020 and has some great lyricism on it. I don't have a whole lot to say about it here, but my comments have more detailed thoughts. Anyway, this was my second favourite album in the rate after Miss Anthropocene and I hope to see Allie live someday.

**sufjancaesar** (8.583): Lots of alt-pop bangers on this one! Yet it still manages to be engaging and meaningful. Her vocal tone is amazing as well

**metanoira** (8.542): definitely my favourite album in this rate. a few duds, but great overall.

**ReallyCreative** (8.483): This album is really really solid throughout, but maybe doesn't have quite as high peaks as some of my top albums of 2020. That said, the "filler" of this album is head and shoulders above most, and it's a really enjoyable listen in a lot of different contexts. She snapped.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.333): I feel like this is way more interesting visually than sonically. There isn't a standout track in here, that's why non of them got a 10, but I really love the aesthetic and the vibe.

**skargardin** (8.333): I still maintain the feelings of this being her best album. I love the fully realised concept, the picture she paints with the themes and the sinister production remains pretty stellar throughout. I can't wait to hear what the bonus tracks will add to this album.

**jman457** (8.308): A very consistently good pop record.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.183): definitely the most consistent record of the rate

**iniekcja\_** (8.125): this is one of those sad cases where the aesthetic of the album exceeds the material in quality.. it's still a neat project though with some really high highs and would definitely benefit from being cut a bit shorter

**buddhacharm** (7.750): Camp Cock!

**stryxen** (7.667): lovely album some amazing songs and one song i despise but other than that its extremely consistent

**TiltControls** (7.667): The most consistent of the 3 for me. Though I still think I'd rank 'I Disagree' above it for comparing my favourites, Cape God doesn't have nearly as many skips. Some great stuff on here as always for Allie and I really did enjoy listening to it overall!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.500): Before this rate the only song I had heard off this album was Susie Save Your Love because of Mitski. I love love love that song so I have no idea why it took me until now to listen to the full album. Thank you r/popheads!

**thedoctordances1940** (7.375): It's a good album but i remember enjoying it a lot more than i actually did this time

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7.333): The lightest in the actual dark elements of the three records, with some great bass grooves, and arguably the strongest vocals between the three of them. Allie really shows those off the entire record, and the production is top notch for those deep electro pop sounding songs.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.192): I see myself revisiting these tracks more than poppy, and this album is a way better overall project than Miss A (which has classics but like half the tracklist is so-so at best), but also it didn’t really have a lot of clear high points that the others had so I feel bad about how I’m doing Allie here. Maybe as i keep listening those highs will start to stand out, but for now this is the most solid project here by far, without much in the way of duds, but it suffers from not blowing my mind like the best couple tracks on Miss A or being weird enough that I respect the pure audaciousness like I Disagree

**bulforster** (7.092): So far I've only listened to Allie for rates so her only other project I've heard in collxtion ii and this is definitely an improvement, primarily in the maturity of the lyrics. Plus, I've got to give her major props for delivering us starving mitski fans something during her hiatus.

**Sundraliz** (7.000): A no skips album for me, thanks Allie :)

akanewasright: **jasannn** (6.750): This album is just super mid tbh. Barely any skips but nothing I really want to come back too.

**hikkaru** (6.708): ngl this album isn't for me as much as her prior releases are but it still has a couple songs i like quite a bit

**Brendon-Urine** (6.500): never really listened to Allie X before bc the only songs I ever heard were just kinda... boring, and a couple songs on here are that but I was surprised at how much I liked some songs. Especially the slower ballads. Balladphobia lost with this album!

**frogaranaman** (5.583): why does she sound so depressed throughout this entire thing

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.000): kinda the worst album i’ve ever had to listen to in a rate sorry

**akanewasright** (10): Please, please, please look at the rank graph for this one. I truly cannot impress upon you how long this song was not even day 3. The early ballots heard this song and shrugged - and since most of our ballots came in within the last few weeks, this means this was day 2 for like a month. And I get it - in the same way Super Duper Party People stands out for being too campy and buoyant, this stands out for being so acoustic… but thanks to the number of 11s and 10s that came in within the last few days, it pushed its way into the top 10. I really thought this was going to be the easiest songeniality vote I’ve ever given... and to be quite honest, I wish this was day 2 so I could give it songeniality, because this song leaving the rate without even hitting the top 5 is a fucking crime. This is one of the best songs of 2020 and one that got me through some BAD covid feelings. This 100% would have been my 11 if it weren’t for Allie, and frankly even with Allie it put up a fight. This was robbed, even if it got a redemption arc.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): I was split on this song for a while, but it has really grown for me and the things I was unsure about at first are really charming now. I think the thing I love most about it though, beyond any of the actual song elements, are just how unexpected it is on this album, it shouldn't work at all and yet it does. It's so touching, and that's hard from Grimes when everything she says sounds like a ready made copypasta.

#Guess I fucking love it

**bigbigbee** (11): I feel like this song is “cheating” because it’s one of the only ones I heard first while watching the music video. I think that the MV really adds an extra dimension to the song – it’s about a personal struggle with substance use, but to me it sounds like it comes from a place of resignment/detachment (hence, she’s in space). It’s a different perspective than what I’m used to. I really like it. Anyway, I’m not sure I would understand the song in this way if I hadn’t seen the video on my first listen. However, I can’t change how I feel, and so, 11 here I go!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (11): i’m placing this here at the start of the ballot we’ll see if anything changes (edit: it did not)

**duochromepalmtree** (11): lyrically this is the best song in the entire rate. There I said it! Was not expecting this sound after the first two songs but wow I love it. I had to sit with this one for a minute. Really beautiful.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (11): So Grimes doesn't sing much with her lower register. After hearing this for the first time, I have no idea why because its beautiful. This combined with her normal higher register makes this feel like the best vocals I've heard her do. On top of this, we got a really nice backing beat and lovely acoustic guitars (and a goddamn BANJO) building this fantastic sort of sad sounding instrumental. It fits perfectly with the depressing nature of the lyrics being about the opioid epidemic at the time and artists like Juice Wlrd and Lil Peep dying of it. A tremendous song.

**IIIHenryIII** (11): this sounds like early 2000s Avril going country in 3020

**imbaby122** (11): so yeah i didn’t know the right lyrics to this song until a minute ago but that just speaks volumes to how powerful the production and vocal delivery is from grimes because i cry every time i hear this song. i hear her pain. i’m not a huge grimes fan but knowing about the bango and the friends she lost you can just tell she poured her whole soul into this song. so powerful. pure genius methinks.

**metanoira** (11): claire i am begging u to pls make an entire album of this

**RandomHypnotica** (11): If you'd have told me that Grimes would release a mostly acoustic-styled guitar song about the opiod epidemic and that it would become my favourite song by her, and possibly one of my favourite songs ever I would've called you crazy. But this track… it's just incredible. The lyrics are poignant, real and succinct, the guitar is emotional and intense, and the little production flourishes are fantastic. For as much as I didn't like the rest of the album, this is a career highlight and shows just what makes Grimes a fantastic artist.

**Raykel** (11): Grimes had such a grand concept and so many ideas for this album and most of it wasn't executed in a coherent way, but she nailed it here, I completely understand her vision on this song. It's one of the most personal and honest songs she made, and yet it goes along with her fallen gods fantasy theme too.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): in my top 5 most listened songs in 2020. banjo n bass

**TiltControls** (11): I'm not the biggest Grimes fan, but this is just so good. Love the use of more acoustic sounds mixed her usual styles. Makes the track feel much more grounded than a lot of her other songs. Not that I'm opposed to the usual ethereal stuff, but the combination is so much more interesting to me

**UselessTacooo** (11): beautiful. Simply beautiful.

**bbfan132** (10): such a gorgeous song, country grimes works well here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This kind of laps every other song on the album proper in terms of quality.

**celladonn** (10): Very different from anything else she's done but so good

**cremeebrulee** (10): she ruined this phrase for me omfg i will try to delete emails at work and be like FUCK!!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A great song. Feels like a continuation, sonically, from one of my Art Angels favorites, "California". Just that it's a more low-key and earnest number.

**fairytalehigh** (10): having almost lost my best friend to addiction during 2020, and knowing too many people who i lost to the same, this one cuts deep. one of the most singularly pretty things Grimes has ever made and the best song on the album.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): Perfect for letting the dread set in but maybe even dialogue with the loss of a friend; the song is versatile like that

**grey/0x976** (10): the boots..

**jman457** (10): Fantastic introspective song at such a bombastic

**nt96** (10): I predict this song will be last one out before Grimes is deleted forever off this rate. Perhaps the only one on the top 10.

**plastichaxan** (10): sometimes i forget about her lisp when she sings but this video doesn’t let me forget

**runaway3212** (10): "I too would like to delete this song forever" - somebody who is very tasteless, probably tk or something

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): waiting for a country artist to do for this song what Johnny Cash did for Nine Inch Nails’ Hurt

**seanderlust** (10): if nobody else got me I know sad grimes bops got me. can I get an amen?

**stryxen** (10): everything about this just works and destroys me entirely and i’d never expect this from grimes but its just makes sense

**vayyiqra** (10): Ugh. This is making me upset as it always does. I said in my comment on "Madame X" that I do not do well with songs about drugs. It's way too personal to me, having seen my family members and friends struggle with them, and worrying about them dying. That Grimes had so many people she knew die from them is beyond screwed up and I'd better stop before I launch into a rant about the failures of drug policy in North America or something. Anyway, this is a beautiful song, and I can't believe I didn't really like it the first time I heard it, which was before the album came out. That was before knowing what it was about though. The context changes absolutely everything and makes this into an incredibly tragic and moving song.

**Vultuxe** (10): this was unexpected but i really like it

**wavingwolves** (10): </3

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): gets extra points for being an actual song instead of just ambient noise, but seriously the strings on this one really do a lot of work

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is such a change of pace from everything else I’ve heard from this album, but it’s good? Her lyrics are super solid, and for some reason I could see Taylor doing this lmao don’t judge

**throwaway7650** (9): SHE IS MILEY CYRUS. YEEHAW (you should be sad outsold)

**waluigiest** (9): i only know a bit of her catalogue (OBLIVION 🥵) but this seems quite different, the emotion is striking, and it’s pretty

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Space country omg

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): *woman whose only point of reference for country music is hearing a guitar being strummed* this sounds like a country song

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): good use of banjo

**seaofblasphemy** (7.5): Kind of all over the place but I like it

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): her joanne era

**AHSWeeknd** (7): So TIL Grimes’ name isn’t actually Grimes.

**BeauMeringue212** (7): I actually like the accoustic sounding parts and the production, just wish it was less repetitive

**moooo566** (7): the opening to this sounds really promising, shame it goes back to being the only song grimes knows afterwards

**SamuelMashups** (7): She should make an acoustic album at this point. I love that her vocals crack in certain parts of the song.

**skargardin** (7): For better or for worse, this really sticks out on the album

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Ok, guitar. What in the yee-haw is this?! But these lyrics are so sad though.

#Don't you tell me now that I don't want it... :(

**hikkaru** (6): never rly got the infatuation with this track. i guess her doing a country influenced track like this is pretty neat but it's not near the best on the album imo

**mudkip1** (6): a cute ditty that doesn't fit sonically on this album. grimes continues to lack direction

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): is this the music cowboys in space would listen to

**ReallyCreative** (5): the instrumental is lovely but these vocals do not do it for me

**whoisValensi** (5): Welcome back to "Nick tries to like a song from this album and somehow walks away disappointed" I'm trying guys, I'm truly trying.

**iniekcja\_** (4): come on teletubby, teleport us to texas

**qazz23** (4): delete this one 4ever

**frogaranaman** (3): why are there so many songs that sound like the 1975 in this rate

**akanewasright** (10): We’re well past the start of this rate at this point, but like… this song is SUCH a perfect opener, that hearing this with only four more tracks to go feels wrong. This was my introduction to Poppy in general, and hearing this for the first time was utterly thrilling. Some people found the genre hopping off putting or messy, while others compared it to previous Poppy songs (namely X), but I’m incredibly happy it made its way into the top 5.

**Awkward\_King** (10): Without a doubt my favourite on the album, while I think others have amazing rock elements or amazing pop elements this is 100% my favourite at combining the both and I think does the best job. Idk why but the blunt switch from unsettlingly sweet pop to raging rock really does it for me, and both hooks are brilliant. It's just an awesome and epic opening track, and kinda settled to be mid day 3 for most of this rate which I'm content with.

#Aspiring pavement

**endcreditouilles** (11): final boss-core

**jasannn** (11): yasss run me over

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): i NEED a full song of that last 60 seconds PLEASE POPPY. the rest of the song is a 10 too but that ending is just perfection ugh

**wavingwolves** (11): this is the equivalent of buttercup from the powerpuff girls in song form

**babadork** (10): I especially like the song in the context of her discography.

**bbfan132** (10): i love how this goes in a million different directions in only 3 minutes and 20 seconds lol

**bigbigbee** (10): The 1st part of this > The 3rd part (love a rock song in a major key!) > The 2nd part. I love the ambition of the song being in three parts. I think this song sets expectations for the album well. This isn’t your DAD’S metal album!!!! (guitar riff noise)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yeeeeeesssss an absolute public works anthem!

**bluehxrizon** (10): it was camp.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): the chugging guitars, the vocals (both scream and cleaned), the lyrics, just EVERYTHING comes together on this song

**cashewconstellation** (10): Excellent song, I adore it, I had to pause my first listen of the album just to stream it like 20 times

**celladonn** (10): An 11 contender, I love this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): one of my favorite songs in the whole rate

**hikkaru** (10): that's conk creat babey!!!!!!

**joeeswift** (10): this is the first poppy song I’ve ever head and I’m hooked

**mudkip1** (10): headbanger smasha

**plastichaxan** (10): i showed this to my drag mom for her opinion on the show i’m thinking about doing and she said it was a whole journey and got high to listen to it again

**qazz23** (10): Love the mix of sounds on this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is exactly what I hoped for when I heard "Poppy goes Metal", the asbolutely wild sections of the track from the nu-metal opening, to the bubblegum pop middle, to the After Laughter esque outro, this track is an absolute experience

**runaway3212** (10): Young blood tea is kinda overrated imo, I prefer jasmine

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The only good song that repeats “yummy yummy yummy”

**SamuelMashups** (10): I love the happy chorus and the heavy metal verses/pre-choruses, a twist that I was not expecting. The stereo pannel mixing got me by surprise.

**seanderlust** (10): very BABYMETAL vibes on this one. some of the lyrics are a little 3 edgy 5 me, but I have to admit that "Bury me six feet deep, cover me in concrete, Turn me into a street" goes hard as a line

**skargardin** (10): turn me into a street, please and thank you

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The mix of pop hooks and sick guitar riffs reminds me of Queen honestly. Which, of course, means this is camp.

**throwaway7650** (10): I don't remember exactly when I heard this album for the first time (last.fm says 8/22/20) but concrete being the opening track sold me immediately. the intro gets the hype rolling right away and the guitar goes OFF throughout the song. poppy has a cute rina - WGSUN? imitation/moment and then the song concludes so sweetly with the outro, contrasting the lyrics. the competition is tough but this is probably my favorite opener in the rate, 11-worthy for sure, as are the title track/sick of the sun + ... my 11 :mischief:

**TiltControls** (10): this song is a journey holy shit. Came very close to 11'ing this instead of my actual choice

**Uberpigeon** (10): the latex outfit when shes digging is the best shes ever looked its such a serve

**whatsanillinois** (10): the end of this song rules so hard

**whoisValensi** (10): Everyone say congrats to Poppy on becoming the newest member of Babymetal with this one.

**xavieryes** (10): I was initially a bit mixed on this song because I didn't really like the chorus or the "some people like candy" verse, but it eventually grew on me insanely and almost got my 11. The outro in particular is one of the best moments in the entire rate for me, and there's something just morbidly beautiful about "bury me six feet deep, cover me in concrete, turn me into a street".

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): the only yummy yummy I approve of

**sage** (9.5): what an opener

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): The outro was lovely! She nailed the pop/metal sound here

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): i catch myself singing that last chorus to myself at least once every other week

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Wanting to sleep for eternity is such a mood sometimes.

**bulforster** (9): This is basically X pt.ii and that song rules, so naturally this one does too.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): no girl concrete is NOT tasty it’s just powder and water it can’t be good for you

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): Remember when I mentioned the genre switches? Well Poppy here seemed to say "why not just do it all in a single song!" In a way it sets up what kinds of songs you'll here throughout the album, and the most impressive part is that somehow, the whole song works seamlessly. I do love the bubblegum pop sounding sections, it actually sounds like she is literally singing about bubblegum too, it's hilarious but brilliant.

**iloveneonlights** (9): I don't know how she managed to do it, but she makes me want to be covered in concrete

**thedoctordances1940** (9): the way this switches between cutesy and demonic is so unique and i fucking love it

**TragicKingdom1** (9): this is kinda giving panic! at the disco but it's also better than every song by them

**waluigiest** (9): it’s messy but I’m beginning to really like it

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): I’m not going to lie this song SHOOK me the first time I heard it lol. But I love the way it plays on your perceptions of what it is. It reminds me of the first time I heard welcome to the black parade.

**imbaby122** (8.5): omfg this is the first poppy song i’ve heard since my bubblebath ep phase in 2016 she’s in her deranged era. the chorus is so fun!!! and the outro 😋 crowd chants in songs generally grind my gears but otherwise this was an enjoyable journey.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): i appreciate how all-over-the-place this goes but i’m not gonna lie having visuals helps this one a lot

**cherryices** (8): they paved poppy and put up a parking lot

**fairytalehigh** (8): like a mario party mini game in a mosh pit

**iniekcja\_** (8): I too would not mind a taste of yungblud in my teeth

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): wish this had just been full metal instead of the pop chorus...but the rest of the song is so amaze lemme just ignore it

**nt96** (8): Well damn

**ReallyCreative** (8): this is fun, but it's missing something

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I just experienced so many mood swings listening to this song...

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): this is X but better.

akanewasright: #Would like to stay above the ground thank you

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): I'm conflicted on this one. I love all the heavy parts. The "yummy yummy yummy" cutesy part is......I'd rather not it happens. I get it's probably tongue in cheek but it's so so instictively annoying to me. I like the Beatles-esque "blood in my teeth" bridge though, that's a fun trippy part of the song followed by some awesome guitars. And the part at the end that sounds like Contemporary Christian Music is funny (compliment) lmao

**seaofblasphemy** (7): Poppy x Sheryl Crow when

**jman457** (6.7): I really like God Only Knows interpolation, but the kawaii metal guitar is kind of annoying. Like a Kitchen sink approach

**King\_Tyson** (6.2): Queen vibes with the guitar

**ignitethephoenix** (5.8): her saying chewy chewy and yummy yummy in a metal song sends … but also is just kind of annoying after the first time

**Vromega** (5): There's so much going on in the same song, and at the same time not that much. This messy patchwork is quite confusing, and not in a good way for me, especially as an opener. How am I supposed to enter her universe here, she already lost me

**Vultuxe** (5): it's aight. i don't mind the intro.

**1998tweety** (4): these 2 songs individually aren't bad (the metal half is way better), but splicing them together just drag the whole song down. And the cheering at some point? Girl the narcissism. You're doing too much.

**cremeebrulee** (4): this is was one of the first poppy songs i've heard and i think it's the reason i thought i couldn't get into her, because i was not a fan of this at all. after hearing the album in full, i've realized that the abrupt genre transitions are her ~thing~. and to be fair, this song is not the most egregious example of it on the album. but i wished the sound of this stuck more in the vein of the intro; it’s definitely the most interesting part of the song to me because i really just hate that overly sweet sounding chorus and outro.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (3): I was told I had to explain this score so I'll just say that I thought there was too much going on in such a short period of time though. I liked the make me a street line though

**vayyiqra** (3): Hearing the opening to this album was quite a WTF moment to me the first time I played it.The whiplash when this goes from sounding like Metallica to a DDR song and then it's a metalcore breakdown and then it's like 60s pop. I have to say I don't get the love for this song at all and don't really enjoy it, but it sure is ... creative, I'll give it that. Well, I might get some haters for tanking this song, but oh well. I can't lie and say I like it when I don't.

**frogaranaman** (2): this song sounds like it's constantly trying to out-jerk itself

**akanewasright** (10): I thought this would win. I really did. Maybe that’s my own bias, maybe that’s the fact that it had an early lead and seemed to be the favorite among hardcore Poppy fans, but I was SHOCKED when it took second, then third, then fourth and never regained the lead. Although I can absolutely see why this would be too abrasive for popheads, they are wrong and this would have been a great winner. Every part of this song makes you *feel* Poppy’s righteous anger. There’s this dichotomy of the harder songs on I Disagree, where some bounce from genre to genre with abandon while others blend elements more seamlessly. This fits the latter, but it doesn’t even feel like the song is genre switching when it hits the electronic parts, it just needs that energy to get the point across. This song is brilliant, and I sorta wish it pulled ahead further than it did

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): I remember being in a rate where this was played as an interlude, and being like holy fuck, maybe I was wrong in just writing this album off. It's so grabbing, the way Poppy delivers the lyrics almost like she's reading off of a script to mirror her career (or at least that's how I interpret it) is really cool and this being the fan favourite is very understandable. I think most assumed this was the winner coming into this, I know me and Akane did, and when I tell you it was a tight race up until the very end... This makes for a very good finalist but was ultimately pipped at the post.

**hikkaru** (11): :shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl::shockedgirl:

**iloveneonlights** (11): Anything with a floating crucifix moment gets an 11 in my book

**sarcasticsobs** (11): i am ready to run through a WALL

**static\_int\_husp** (11): lyrics here slap and as do they hyperpop-y sound effects. I absolutely love the one that can only be described as a "!" sound

**whoisValensi** (11): Yeah. Soooooo I knew damn well before going into this rate this would be my 11. There's something insanely badass about fucking lyrically ending someone as shitty as T*tanic with this song while also having to work with them on it and it just goes over their fucking head. This has actually become a "staple" of my semi-non-existent angry playlist because she's mad as HELL on this song and I 100% get that. Literally every part of this song just works for me from that slow intro to that fucked up synth to the absolute barrage of guitars before the end. As the kids say, she snapped with this one.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): hyperpop tease 😍

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I usually can't stand anything remotely resembling metal music. It's amazing the difference it makes when the singer is a fabulous woman instead of a constipated man.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): so so so lucky I got to see Poppy tour this album before covid hit, because this song just took on a whole new life for me. Her energy on stage was like nothing else I've ever seen live

**bulforster** (10): Now this is Music to Scream To

**CrimsonROSET** (10): jesus thee christ

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Hell yea. Love the energy!!! Love the rough AF sound

**fairytalehigh** (10): catholic gay angst noises

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): They don't call her Grammy-nominated for nothing! Like yes they're not an accurate acclaim indicator but also it's free bragging rights

**iniekcja\_** (10): this is literally the yasssification of metal

**Island715** (10): Idk what to write for most of these songs they just go hard

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): okay now THIS is amaze

**plastichaxan** (10): god every beat just really feels like she’s punching me in the chest and it feels amazing

**qazz23** (10): Mix of pop and metal is good (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): everything about this is so incredible, the crunchy breakdown, the delicious guitar, poppy's vocals, this feels like halfway between hyperpop and metal, and it's everything

**runaway3212** (10): "I finally know what it feels like to have my soul sucked out of my body" Okay??? I've made a calculus exam too you're not special

**sage** (10): absolute smasha almost my 11

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): A brutal callout of people who are only moral in the public eye. This made some serious points for my 11.

**seanderlust** (10): I mean yes okay, the chorus goes hard, but I really love the prechorus on this one and asking what you believe when both everyone is around and when nobody is

**skargardin** (10): BEG FOR FORGIVENESS FROM JESUS THE CHRIST

**Sundraliz** (10): This song has so many things in it to love

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): if my 11 doesn't win then i hope this does i have alot of ex emo pent up anger

**thedoctordances1940** (10): BANGER

**throwaway7650** (10): this is quite intense for the new paper mario soundtrack

**TiltControls** (10): If someone told me to point to the track that best encapsulates the feel of this rate, I'd say it's this one. It's definitely a lot, but everything in the track feels like it fits perfectly. And it's just fun to bop to

**Uberpigeon** (10): men 🙄

**wavingwolves** (10): i love when music has random noises cause it sounds just like what's the inside of my head

**WhyDoIExistXD** (10): Literally such an amazing three-track run

**xavieryes** (10): this album has an incredible triad of opening songs

#Been playing nice

**pheromenos** (9.8): beg for forgiveness from jesus the christ

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): is this christian music

**nt96** (9.5): (!)

**BeauMeringue212** (9): Love the distortion on this

**jasannn** (9): its giving cher

**stryxen** (9): g sister christ??

**UselessTacooo** (9): She put her whole popussy in this song.

**grey/0x976** (8.5): slay

**imbaby122** (8.5): female rage and christian slander 🤬🤬🤬 this is such a banger ahhhhhhh!!!!!!

**frogaranaman** (8): can't think of a witty joke so here's a confession. did anyone else think that blood money was like, just red dyed money at first instead of an expression or was that just me

**IIIHenryIII** (8): is this hyperpoppy?

**jman457** (8): solid

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): ...Horror Hyper-Rock???

**waluigiest** (8): is this why grimes dumped elon

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the post chorus / bridge breakdown is a kind of grating but the rest of the song is solid

**seaofblasphemy** (7.5): I believe this song is pretty damn cool

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Continuing the heaviness with the nu metal, but this had an awesome glitchy breakdown in it while Poppy basically was shouting the lyrics. Kinda felt like a heavy version of a Charli track.

akanewasright: #...beg for forgiveness from Jesus the Christ

**cashewconstellation** (6.7): Didn't like it that much

**moonagenightmares** (6.5): the guitar solo was like sweet release from the senseless noise, the only reason the score is this high tbh

**Vultuxe** (6.5): i like the production on the interlude/bridge/thing.

**1998tweety** (6): I like how this sticks to one sound and doesn't switch around

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Drums save this one, the rest is a mess

**ReallyCreative** (6): omg a grimes feature??

**astrologicalangel** (5): the chorus sets off my flight or fight response

**duochromepalmtree** (5): I get the anger but I wouldn’t chose to listen to this twice lol.

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (4): listened to this one a couple of times to try to get it, but couldn't get past how much the production reminded me of generic early 2010s "brostep"; just not for me I guess

**mudkip1** (4): i don't like the lyrics here:/ the 'jesus to christ' line is so corny ddd

**SamuelMashups** (4): I'm hating the overcompressed and screechy vocals, that pissed me off for the most part.

**vayyiqra** (3): This song always felt like "I Disagree 2.0" with the way she sings in triplets over 4/4 bars. I want to like it, but can't get past the heavy distortion on the instrumental breaks - I just hate that sound.

**Vromega** (3): Poppy slamming 20 times the same sentence into my ears hurts my brain and whole body. This song makes me quite uncomfortable. That's the idea maybe ? But tbh i literally do not find any pleasure listening to that

**akanewasright** (10): I can’t even lie I wish this was the top Grimes song. It’s just… perfectly polished and creepy and just… wonderful. It’s hard to explain why you love a song so much when you love it because it just makes you DANCE. And the credit for that goes to i_o as much as it does to Grimes. She writes an incredible topline, but his beat is undeniable. His death was nothing short of tragic, may he Rest In Peace.

**Awkward\_King** (7): I like it, this is a nice song, but the times it was winning was a surprise and ultimately I am happy it didn't in the end jkasdkja.

#Convicted murderers

**cremeebrulee** (11): [i dont have anything sentimental to say about it so just look at this tweet i made a year ago](https://imgur.com/a/7wdVrWs)

**frogaranaman** (11): really the only logical 11 choice for me. RIP i\_o / Garrett, your death still tears me up to this date man :(

**ignitethephoenix** (11): not a grimes fan but this is definitely my favorite song from her. Although that may because because i_O’s production is amazing here

**plastichaxan** (11): god this was just on a new level i have nothing more to say i'll just wait for all the comments about grimes predicting covid or the mask stuff

**runaway3212** (11): Grimes is a class traitor but this song is really very good

**SFbby** (11): That hook of "And I like it like that/and I like it like that" has burrowed so deeply into my brain that it's my first reaction when having to make any and all inconsequential choices.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): not quite on the level of some of the stuff on Art Angels but super layered production and many great hooks which I always appreciate!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): So this is that hyperpop y’all have been raving about

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (10): So my favorite part of this song is actually the dance she does in the music video during the chorus, which is both really impressive and one of the hottest things I've ever seen. The song itself is a great electropop banger with a great beat by i_o (RIP), and some great lyrics which actually does relate to basically the damage humans have done to earth. But this song is insanely catchy, I listened to it on repeat like 10 times when it came out. Still love it.

**iniekcja\_** (10): an iris van herpes dress appears before my eyes every time I hear this

**mudkip1** (10): one of the few shining tracks that, get this - wasn't even produced by her!

**sage** (10): YASSSSSSSS

**skargardin** (10): FUCKING BOP

**throwaway7650** (10): might be basic for giving this a 10 but I'm a [slur] so whatever

**UselessTacooo** (10): dance-club-house-something grimes? Sign me the fuck up

**vayyiqra** (10): I could say "what a bop" but that's not remotely doing this song justice. Grimes has always loved edgy themes, like the dysfunctional relationship between the Earth and humanity that this song is about, and violence in general (see: her collection of swords and knives, which feature in many of her music videos). This is classic Grimes: the simple but hypnotic beat, the "ethereal" vocals she is known for, the music video with swords set in a church. (Fun fact: the dead woman on the altar is her bestie Hana.) Peak Grimes, even. This is an 11-worthy song and it's hard to pick a best track on the album, but this would it on the standard edition. I'm only not giving it my 11 because WAP is there, and otherwise it'd definitely be a lock for that. I think it's also a strong contender to win and I certainly won't be mad if it does. And of course I need to mention i_o's contribution to this song, as a talented musician who seemed like a great guy and now is gone. I'm glad this song is here as his legacy.

**Vromega** (10): What a masterpiece, it hurst me to not give this my 11. Everything is perfect in this song, up to the music video. i_o :sob: :sob:

**Vultuxe** (10): it's very pop and what about it

**wavingwolves** (10): i love when a heartfelt song is followed by a gibberish filled banger

**whoisValensi** (10): Is that a banger I hear?!?!?!?! Honestly major props to i_o for this one. Incredible work here.

**xxipil0ts** (10): It felt like the album would've been better if it sounded more like this.

#Have started a fist fight in their lives

**1998tweety** (9.5): BOP

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9.5): This serving her sole choreography MOMENT is a gag

**iloveneonlights** (9.5): The extra 0.5 comes from the fact that she was wearing a mask in her MV, she's truly ahead of our time even if it's just a few months off

**nt96** (9.5): The PS2 vibes are strong on this one.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): Rest in peace i_o :(

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9.5): Club banger but took time to grow on me

**imbaby122** (9.2): mmm this song is so satisfying. something about the chord progression and the untz untz of it all. makes me want to dance 😎 also it’s giving the club penguin dance dance revolution minigame for some reason.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): just need to say that the music video is absolutely 11/10.

**fairytalehigh** (9): dark, rippling, tickles my trance-slut sweet spot. a total banger in either mix and one of the best expressions of the album's climate change themes. RIP i_o

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): flabster

**pheromenos** (9): the club mix outsold tbh

**qazz23** (9): I like the synths in the middle section

**ReallyCreative** (9): what happens whenever I tell my best friend who is a Grimes stan that she is a class traitor

**sarcasticsobs** (9): hell ya

**thedoctordances1940** (9): The first track on the album that I really like, maybe it's just cause i'm a sucker for arpeggiators

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): it sounds like it was made for a Victoria Secret show

**seaofblasphemy** (8.5): I don’t know how to act

**bulforster** (8.3): This is a very good song but I feel like I'm missing what's giving it a lot of 11 buzz.

**bbfan132** (8): rip i_o :(((((((((

**CrimsonROSET** (8): stream screen violence

**duochromepalmtree** (8): even though this song features grimes and the mumble core sound it has one of my favorite beats on the album

**jman457** (8): Its just a dance vibe

**SamuelMashups** (8): Sexy, simple but so pleasing to hear.

**seanderlust** (8): is this what people on twitter keep waking up and choosing?

**waluigiest** (8): bop bop bop but the concept feels a little…. Idk forced? Underbaked?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/d5tuzg/the_popheads_jukebox_week_135/f0o0xtz/

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): pleasant, but it kinda shrunk on me over time. Still top 3 on this album though

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): and i like it like THAT

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I have no idea what she's saying, but that's ok because the production is sick.

#Got pushed in a locker or something once

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I’m just glad this at least kind of has a chorus.

**BeauMeringue212** (5.5): catchy in parts but kinda gets dull after a while

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): Feels like a regression of Grimes songs I've heard dozens of times before.

**TiltControls** (5.5): there are parts where it starts to get interesting, but imo the song fizzles out without really doing more with the great atmosphere it sets up

**xavieryes** (4): violently boring

**akanewasright** (9): I wanna be a good host and explain the appeal of the song and why it did so well, but… all I can say is that it just sounds fucking *cool*. Like this plays as you break into a high tech building or something. The lyrics themselves are campy as fuck, but in a way that just feels… *good*, like it’s as if you’re not in this world when you’re hearing it, it’s a world where everything in the song is *normal*. Everything is so extreme, so not of this world that you have no choice but to follow along with it. This picked up some hate over the last few days due to it’s association with Elon and Grimes’ relationship, but for the most part, this was earnestly one of the most liked songs in the rate for that reason. It’s a damn strong runner up.

**Awkward\_King** (9): It would've been a great winner but I think it's just as good of a runner up. When I say the race at the top was close up until the very last ballot, the top 4 were constantly switching and this could've won with just a couple extra 10s or something. I'm so fascinated by this song because it's amazing to take such a niche song idea like humans at physical war with technology and like... drive it home so clearly in lyrics that it is almost impossible to misinterpret, but she really did that and it is incredible.

#Submitting to the robo-daddies

**astrologicalangel** (11): undeniable bop

**celladonn** (11): It's only the best song ever

**moonagenightmares** (11): i would 11 half of this album if i could, i chose this because it was the song from this rate i've known longest, have listened to the most and have the most nostalgic feelings about, also it slays

**skargardin** (11): Okay fine, I submit, have my 11

**thedoctordances1940** (11): it completely blows everything actually on the album out of the water, I love how hard it goes

**vayyiqra** (11): Grimes shrieking Did you know this song was inspired by North Korea having a K-pop girl group that sings nationalistic propaganda, and Zola Jesus called Grimes a techno-fascist on Twitter because of it? Wacky stuff! I wish more music fans had the critical thinking skills to understand that songs don't always reflect the feelings of their writers. Grimes wrote this because she is edgy and thinks AI is really cool, it's not that deep. I was thinking of giving "Violence" my 11, but this is getting it for a few reasons: that drop is incredible, the guitar and drums bang so hard, and this is I'm sure my only chance to ever give both Grimes AND Hana, who are besties and are two of my faves, a 11 at the same time. I have to do it to 'em. Anyway, I believe in Miss Anthropocene supremacy. SUBMIT. SUBMIT.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I had to look up the word capitulate but other than that it’s a banger!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Thank you for including this; it salvaged my rating for this album just a bit. Grimes needs to explore the pop-metal fusion more.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i for one welcome our new ~~overlords~~ rate winners, grimes and hana

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (10): Futuristic girl sings about loving the power we'll see from Artificial Intelligence in the future to an industrial nu metal beat. It's as wacky as it sounds, but this song is awesome, although it feels a bit weird now given the Elon Musk relationship which followed. I guess Grimes in a way really did like power in a way huh?

**hikkaru** (10): how thoughtful of grimes to include this fan fave rock-influenced track that didn't end up being part of or sounding anything like the actual album as a deluxe track so that we can have it in this rate in good conscience, it'd be horrible if an artist released one of their best songs in a style that while new to them fit them incredibly well and then it didn't end up on their completely different-sounding album but then they also completely refused to add it onto the album in any capacity despite fans loving it so we had to haphazardly tack it onto the rate with said album even though it wasn't technically on it at all... thank god that hasn't happened

**iloveneonlights** (10): , Wouldn't it be iconic if the Poppy version of this song ever came out?

**iniekcja\_** (10): I was gonna write an entire rant here but it would take to long so to sum it up quickly: Chromatica was boring

**Island715** (10): goes hard

**mudkip1** (10): death metal slayage

**plastichaxan** (10): this was almost my 11 not only because it’s amazing and a collapse etc, but because it meant so much to me to hear new grimes after so long and just at this level, it’s kind of weird that this isn’t really that old but i feel a lot of nostalgia for this song already

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Words cannot express how dissapointed I am that Miss A didn't end up leaning more into this sort of direction (ironically, this feels like it ended up being more of the direction Poppy headed in, even though her feature on this track fell through)

**runaway3212** (10): We Appreciate Pussy

**sage** (10): yes i still love this song but its so overrated 😭 ppl acting like it washes everything on miss a when my name is dark exists likeeee

**seanderlust** (10): the lyrical content of this allegiance to AI banger...maybe the Luddites made some points

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I swear to god there better be a WAP x WAP mashup and we better hear it during the reveal

**stryxen** (10): the outro is one of the most magical ascending moments in music ever is hana even here

**UselessTacooo** (10): oh my god this goes so hard I love it. Grimes give me more

**Vultuxe** (10): a classic and always will be

**wavingwolves** (10): wet things and computers don't go along very well i don't think

**whoisValensi** (10): If you googled "capitulate" after hearing this song, raise your hand. 🙋🏻‍♂️ Anyways this is the best song on this album even if it was smacked onto the deluxe and not the regular album. Before any of the Grimes fans come for me, I will simply see myself out. Au revoir.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): stand up for the one true WAP

**CrimsonROSET** (9): so true

**duochromepalmtree** (9): the lyrics honestly make me roll my eyes but it sounds AWESOME. it’s such a way to close an album. Absolutely my favorite closer of the three.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): something something WAP

**imbaby122** (9): it’s fight to the death gladiator and it’s an absolute rock banger so basically it’s the brit x christina x pink pepsi ad.

**joeeswift** (9): point deducted for making me learn about roko’s basilisk and condemning me to an endless torture

**SamuelMashups** (9): I agree, we appreciate power.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): the definition of saving the best for last

**throwaway7650** (9): sorry HANA but I need WAP (poppy's version) ASAP

**Uberpigeon** (9): theres too many waps this cycle and thats not even counting mine 👅 ah

**waluigiest** (9): serve! serve! Robot serve!

**WhyDoIExistXD** (9): Cyberpunk queen

**TiltControls** (8.5): we love the WAP cycle

**bigbigbee** (8): I remember when this song came out me and my friends were all like “FUCK!! It’s really good.” I kind of admire Grimes for how bald-faced this is, too.

**fairytalehigh** (8): If you ignore the "techno-fascist cheerleaders chanting about Roko's basilisk" concept--a huge if--this song is a banger. It runs a bit too long though

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): A fitting credits roll sequence and although the video is nowhere to be found, at least the lyric one is still so good

**frogaranaman** (8): if WAP wins another rate I swear

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This just doesn’t feel good for my ears but also I’m kinda into it by halfway through

**moooo566** (8): is this ironic? i liked it more when i was sure.

**qazz23** (8): omg the initials spell WAP

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love the chorus and bridge but the rest of the song doesn’t do it for me

**wexpyke** (7.7): : poppy claims that she wrote some of this.....would love to know the whole story lol

**bbfan132** (7.5): definitely fun to listen to but it’s a bit too long

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): I swear I've heard this ine before. I like the feature! And the ending too!

**nt96** (7): Hail Skynet

**ReallyCreative** (7): the absolute gall to make a song with this title Grimes, the absolute gall. I cannot stand this woman. HANA serves though.

#Takes a lot to make them capitulate I guess

**babadork** (6): I liked it much more when it first came out, but it being so literally robots has put me off a bit since then.

**BeauMeringue212** (6): I like how the lyrics play into that futuristic dystopian narrative she's trying to get across, but this song had potential and just kinda fizzled for me

**seaofblasphemy** (5): Look, if you wanna make nu-metal, just make nu-metal

**bluehxrizon** (4): I enjoy Hana on this but the chorus is not giving to me.. Poppy did this sound more interestingly on several tracks

**TheQueenOfVultures** (4): I hate everything Grimes does on this song, but Hana serves so I guess we're at an impasse

**Vromega** (4): As much I love both Hana and Grimes, I feel like the production is "overagressive". The addition of screams on the back, alarms, sirens,... darkens too much the atmosphere

**xavieryes** (2.5): These are the most cringe-worthy lyrics I've ever heard in a Grimes song. Whenever I hear "What will it take to make you capitulate?", "When will the state agree to cooperate?", "Pledge allegiance to the world's most powerful computer", the mind uploading bridge, or "Biology is superficial/Intelligence is artificial" I just feel like throwing up. Grimes is an incredible artist but her overall aesthetic and persona can be pretty gross and pretentious sometimes, and while it usually doesn't leak into the music itself that much, here it's absurdly on the face to the point where it makes the song not even remotely enjoyable for me. The fact that Grimes herself has said she's not sure if she's being serious here or not doesn't help. I just can't take this ambiguously ironic, borderline cult-ish and proselytist ode to the "AI overlords" any seriously... or maybe it's the opposite and I'm actually taking it too seriously lol, but either way I just can't stand it. A shame because production-wise it slaps.

**whatsanillinois** (0): we appreciate my ex hubby elon 😊😊😊 Edit: Especially with Poppy in the mix, Grimes trying her hand at the Nu metal/alt rock is especially dull. The message of the song being basically a love letter to the rich and powerful is especially awful due to her relationship with elon

 Oh Grimes. What an era you had. The constant clownery, the delays, the leaks, and the biggest accolade the album had (the BNM designation) being taken from it mere days after this rate began, just as a final slap to the face. Then there’s the Elon stuff, that I mostly find to be irrelevant to the album but kept getting brought up in comments. Upon further reflection and listens… while I think this is the worst album in the rate, I find this to be an incredibly strong and unique work from an artist that has yet to make a *bad* album. It has a few distinct misses for me, but it has more than enough highs to make up for that. Violence and WAP very nearly won this rate, but in the end got enough low scores to *barely* keep them down.

**vayyiqra** (10.000): It's hard to think of what else I can say about this album. I wrote the Popheads essay for our Album of the Year series on it. There I focused heavily on interpreted the lyrics in terms of its rather ambitious concept, so if you would like to know more about that, please read it if you're interested. (Shameless self-plug: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kr1w1x/popheads_2020_album_of_the_year_5_grimes_miss/) Here though I wrote more casual thoughts on each song, and my feelings have not changed. Grimes is my top artist of all time on Lastfm, this is in my top 10 albums of all time on there, and I have over 1000 plays of it across every version of it, so even though my scores are incredibly high I think I can justify them. I know this album got some polarizing reactions when it came out and not everyone loves it, and it doesn't help that Grimes' zany behaviour makes it hard to stan her at times, or even like her for some of you. I get all that. However, I truly think this is a masterpiece, and even though her concept didn't quite come through on it, the themes she intended are there. Or maybe I'm just biased because it's a sci-fi album and I love sci-fi, and Grimes is Canadian and everyone my age in Canada knows her. Maybe! But the fact is that if I didn't love this album I wouldn't have played it front to back literally over 100 times, so I stand by it. This album is incredible, and Grimes is a musical genius.

**plastichaxan** (9.045): this album was a grower, as a big fan of grimes i don’t really know what i was expecting but was disappointed and time has proven me wrong, this is an amazing album, her concept came through and the songs are way deeper than i ever thought, it’s a bit sad that this era was tempted by her relationship with Elon while none of the songs (i think) have to do with him, but i understand where the criticism came from, i just really enjoy this now.

**stryxen** (8.818): its lows are meh but it’s highs oh my god i have 4 elevens on this album and it hurt to narrow them down

**iniekcja\_** (8.636): this was probably the biggest disappointment of 2020 (the pandemic comes close though), when it's good, it's good, but when it's bad it becomes really drawn out, boring and forgettable

**skargardin** (8.636): This really is such a strong conceptual album.

**Vultuxe** (8.591): 9 grimes feels similar to poppy but i fuck with her voice and production a lot more

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.591): best album in this rate YASS we love you grimes

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8.455): I had gotten pretty big into Grimes, I adored Art Angels and really liked Visions as well. This album has a bunch of really great, and spectacular songs on it, and sonically I really like the entirety of it, but I think it sort of suffers thematically, as it wasn't really the climate change driven record that I think Grimes was going for initially. It could probably have to do with the numerous delays this experienced, at times it felt like it would never come out. Still though, I love that she ended up having a heavier vibe to her songs on this album, taking a page out of Poppy's book, while also having her trademark experimental nature to the songs.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.364): I guess this is my favorite album of the 3 in this rate. Grimes is also the only one of these artists I could see myself stanning. Her talent is undeniable. I'd love to see Delete Forever or Idoru taking the crown.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.273): She may come across as living in a different world completely every time she speaks, but c can still crank some fascinating and expansive pop to leave us stunned

**cremeebrulee** (8.255): yeah fuck this rate for making me admit how much i like this album 😭 i think putting these songs on rotation during early lockdown made them so much more enjoyable— they’re so tied to the feelings of fear and anxiety i had then, it just exacerbated the apocalyptic vibes here. i realize grimes is a whole ass mess, i would be lying if i don’t admit that her music just HITS sometimes.

**runaway3212** (8.209): Okay fun fact when this rate was due I had an exam that partly featured stuff about the Anthropocene and when it started happening, honestly really interesting stuff that question on the exam was the only one I got right

**AHSWeeknd** (8.182): Grimes’ production is insanity. This is so good, I’m definitely gonna get into more of Grimes’ music.

**sufjancaesar** (8.182): Not familiar with Grimes but I vibed with this more than I expected! Feels like the music that would play in the nightclub of a campy, sci-fi video game set in a future dystopia. So…overall an enjoyable listening experience asjsjkd

**throwaway7650** (8.091): ah, grimes... for all the discourse around her (and elon) in the past few years, I listened to her very little before this rate. I apparently heard delete forever last april and then once earlier this year along with 4ÆM and WAP but I didn't recall anything about them until I listened to miss a as an album. like I said in my comment for SHIFTTE, I had no idea what to expect for this album but I did like it overall. some songs do drag and grimes' voice is an acquired taste but production-wise this album blows the other 2 away and conceptually this album also knocks it out of the park - I wasn't sure where she was going to go with the "anthropomorphic goddess of climate change" theme but it works (for the most part, I don't acknowledge new gods :mischief:)! as controversial as she is, grimes really is an *artist* and I can't get too mad at her potentially winning the rate (but if another WAP that I gave a 9 wins... well, if I had a nickel for every time that happened, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice, right?)

**jman457** (7.945): This album surprised me. While there was a couple duds, it holds it own in Grimes discography

**Brendon-Urine** (7.818): I feel like this album definitely COULD have been better, but I'm not mad at all. It's still awesome.

**metanoira** (7.709): i have a love-hate relationship with grimes but she gives what needs be gave (most of the time)

**buddhacharm** (7.682): I don't know where to plug this besides here but do y'all remember the rumors that Grimes bit Poppy while in-studio leading to their short-lived feud? Lmaoooo

**waluigiest** (7.636): I’m sorry but the concept of this album will always feel disingenuous when the artist was dating one of the richest, exploitative people on earth.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.545): this probably has my highest average but its so completely supported by only a few songs that just blow me away and make up for a higher percentage of songs I just don’t care for… my average might not reflect my feelings on the album as well as I’d like it to but that happens when an album has a few stunners

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.318): That was not what I was expecting. I had always heard that Grimes was "weird" in her music, but I didn't think it was gonna be like this. I hadn't heard a single Grimes song before this, so I was going into this completely blind. I will say though, that I LOVE her voice! It's so ethereal and haunting and cool! Her lyrics are great too! The record definitely got better the farther I got into it. The turning point for me was "New gods" and I just loved everything after that. I feel like the best part about this album for me though was the production. She is a great producer. I think this is my least fav of the three albums in this rate, but I still like it a lot. I would probably rate it like a 7/10. I feel like it'll grow on me overtime and I just need to let it sit with me for right now.

**Sundraliz** (7.273): She's good at creating an atmosphere you cannot deny it

**bulforster** (7.236): This is such a weird album to judge because about half of it is straight up bad then the other half contains some of my favourite songs period.

akanewasright: **RandomHypnotica** (6.827): My first exposure to Grimes was actually doing the rate with Art Angels in it way back in the day (on an alt account), and I ended up really loving the album, it was my favourite in that rate, and it actually ended up being the first Vinyl I purchased when I decided to start collecting. When WAP was first released, I was excited for the next album to drop, and I was very into the sound, but eventually, as more singles kept dropping, a feeling of worry began to sink in. I wasn't feeling a lot of these. And when the album ultimately released, I was left dissapointed. I don't think it's a terrible album, but she definitely didn't deliver on the concept side of the album, and a large part of the album just feel like the pretentious side of her coming out. BUT, when it delivers, it's incredible, and I wish we'd gotten more tracks along those lines.

**steelstepladder** (6.736): this is worse than I remember :/

**moooo566** (6.636): its really hard to rate this when grimes songs all sound the same and its not even that good

**thedoctordances1940** (6.591): It's not a bad album by any means, there's definitely some really good stuff here, but it is kinda disappointing

**hikkaru** (6.545): pitchfork regretting their bnm for this album right when the rate went up i have to laugh

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6.364): I liked Grimes better when I knew less about them

**jasannn** (6.273): Maybe Pitchfork was right to decrease the score.

**TiltControls** (6.227): This album was super mixed for me. There's definitely some solid stuff here, but also a lot that I don't really care for (which is how I felt about parts of Art Angels as well actually...) Anyways discovering Delete Forever made it all worth it even if I'm still hoping half of the album gets destroyed day 1

**Roxieloxie** (5.909): it wasnt even good music for my sims to woohoo too

**qazz23** (5.818): Pretty uneven album, some bangers like 4ÆM but a lot of filler on the second half

**whoisValensi** (5.545): At least I'll always have Art Angels...

**mudkip1** (5.455): why does she insist this is her best album? there are some good moments sparsely scattered throughout that never feel fully realized. almost every single track misses the spark that grimes has achieved on many of her earlier songs. miss anthropocene feels incomplete and blurry - a dull, unpolished rock that could be so beautiful if more attention were paid to it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.273): Man I felt kinda bad scoring this but it’s just so much worse than the other two albums in this rate.

**frogaranaman** (5.091): fuck you Grimes that white album cover is fucking hideous

**akanewasright** (10): Uh… yeah I didn’t expect this at all lmao. This crept up to first early on with no 11s and no really low scores. That changed in the last few days of the rate, but this kind of won because very few people hated it. It doesn’t have the divisive genre switches of Concrete or the abrasiveness of Bloodmoney, and while it very much does not have the edge that won those two songs as many 11s as they have, it still has an incredible guitar line, a great chorus, and biting lyrics. I’m surprised, but not at all disappointed. I have NO idea how this win will be perceived by all of you, but uh… I’m hoping it’s as surprising as I think it’ll be, but yeah.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): This was a surprise at first but it does make a lot of sense now I've had time to let it settle. This is definitely more palatable than Bloodmoney, and I think is definitely a more touching take and representation of the album. Overall a song so directly in defiance of the abuse Poppy received is a fitting winner for a rate that tackles those themes so much, even if it is a bit of an upset, it won due to how agreeably good it was.

---

#Pyromaniacs

**martian\_pet** (11): It's such a cool song

**seanderlust** (11): does anyone else think pyromania is a good thing? I love poppy, I think she's a really interesting artist

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “burn it all down” Poppy is Khaleesi confirmed

**bbfan132** (10): this was the song that made me go “oh shit” when i heard it, so good

**bigbigbee** (10): I’ve never been so happy to not understand Japanese as when my friend listened to this song for the first time, wrinkled her nose and said “that’s the most awkward possible phrasing for that sentence ” about the opening line “watashi wa anata ni dōi shimasen”. To my uneducated ears, it sounds great! Anyway, I choose ignorange, wouldn’t change a thing, great job Poppy, gold star

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I can't get over how good the guitar riff is.

**cremeebrulee** (10): best track of the album no question and one of the few that feels fully realized.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Great, bracing song. Good use of tension and dynamics. It's fun and a banger. Lyrics are biting

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song is completely awesome. I cut a narc out of my life recently and this is so my new theme song for that relationship. This song is awesome (and I love the reprise later in the album!!!!)

**endcreditouilles** (10): i too want to light everyone on fire and go about my day

**frogaranaman** (10): probably the best song on the album, riff fucks super hard

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (10): I watch a lot of wrestling, like A LOT. So when Poppy showed up to perform this on WWE NXT, without actually knowing her, it was a hell of a trip. Just a petite blonde girl vibing to this heavy nu metal track with these dark lyrics was so awesome. And it wasn't like she was doing some sort of nu metal cosplay, it was legit some great guitar work.

**hikkaru** (10): peak humour is someone saying something u disagree with and then sending this album cover in response

**IIIHenryIII** (10): me whenever my ex-best friend finished talking

**mudkip1** (10): EVERYONE got up EVERYONE moved EVERYONE did something

**nt96** (10): I think we ALL disagree

**plastichaxan** (10): letting it all burn down is such a concept let’s kill the rich bestie

**qazz23** (10): That riffing

**runaway3212** (10): storytime: I had a teacher who would never allow us to say 'I disagree' because that would "kill ideas" but he was a shitty teacher anyway, shoutout to poppy for personally coming to my school and killing him

**sage** (10): the industrial sounding moments are so good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I love how this is about the music industry but could also be a fuck you to Titanic and other abusers, which is true of many lyrics on the album. This track is just so empowering, and so was watching Poppy evolve as an artist to the point where is she is today.

**stryxen** (10): well basically it’s one of the best songs i’ve ever heard

**thedoctordances1940** (10): An absolute banger, the chorus will get stuck in my mind for weeks

**throwaway7650** (10): I support this being our reaction to poppy losing the rate

**TiltControls** (10): reminds me of something I'd play in Guitar Hero then get super hooked on immediately after

**wavingwolves** (10): poppy: i'm sorry for being a weeb / me: some crimes can't ever be forgiven

**whoisValensi** (10): Some people just wanna watch the world burn... While listening to this song I am one of those people, but also I am holding the lighter cause I started the fucking fire.

#[Disagrees with a lot of things](https://youtu.be/wa2cLs5DzFY?t=26)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): "I disagree everything you believe is a tragedy" -- me talking to any family member about politics.

**UselessTacooo** (9.3): Holy. Fuck. I remember listening to this album for the first time thinking Concrete was just a little bit of fun experimentation with the metal sound and she would go back to pop, but boy was I wrong. This is so heavy, and it sounds perfect. I’m taking away a little bit for the questionable inclusion of Japanese, but outside of that this song is nearly flawless.

**iniekcja\_** (9): iconic title track

**RandomHypnotica** (9): me with every rate's results

**skargardin** (9): LET IT ALL BURN DOWN!!!!!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i love how her voice sounds almost sweet in the chorus and then its jutxaposed w that nice screaming in the middle verse

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): still don’t get the japanese thrown in here but the rest rips

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): music video seems like a knockoff version of "queen" by perfume genius, but lyrically it's an A+

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I'll disagree if this song doesn't make it to at least day 3.

**jman457** (8.3): Really like the vibe here feels like one complete thought

**BeauMeringue212** (8.2): More pop sounding than I was expecting but I'm not mad at it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): agreen’t

**ignitethephoenix** (8): so true queen let popheads burn down

**SamuelMashups** (8): Creepy but repetitive. Sounds similar to Concrete, the music video added a nice touch to the song.

**seaofblasphemy** (8): I disagree with anyone who gives this a low score

**imbaby122** (7.7): omfg this chorus is so good ughhh i wish i liked the verses more. they feel a little empty it really slows the momentum of the song for me.

**ktajlili** (7): The refrain is a banger, but the bridge is so cheesy!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): me when the results come in and allie loses

#Enjoys agreeing, I guess

**Uberpigeon** (7): I disagree with the way you 11 bloodmoney

**cashewconstellation** (6.5): Didn't really vibe with it, I think the chorus is weak

**wexpyke** (6.5): : not sure how i feel about the japanese part

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Not my favorite? There are fun moments but the actual song itself is all over the place and the chorus is kinda annoying

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): don’t like the chorus again!!

**vayyiqra** (6): Well, the chorus to this song is the only part of this album that tends to stick in my head, so it deserves some points for that. The crunchy guitar riff is kind of fun too. Poppy also throws in some random Japanese for some reason and continues her faux J-pop schtick from Poppy.Computer. Weird move! Not sure why that's there.

**Vultuxe** (5): i don't know it sounds just like the last one.

**astrologicalangel** (4): I don't super love the singles from this album, I feel like they don't represent the rest of the songs very well

**Vromega** (4): Overall not fond of the instrumentation. The chorus is fine i guess but the verses are for me a nightmare to listen to. Resisting the urge to skip is at least worth it for the bridge

**1998tweety** (3): Japanese sweetie

**Overall Average**: 7.661 **// Average Controversy:** 1.779

Thank God I can finally talk about how this album performed as a whole with trends and everything, because WOW that shit was interesting. First of all - the rumors are true, some people just *did not like this album*. At all. Through a completely unscientific combination of eyeballing the averages and reading ballots as they came in, this had the most divided reactions out of any album in the rate. The other album's haters usually could get behind more songs than the haters of this one. And it’s not hard to see why - the sound is pretty plainly divisive, and a lot of the stuff that turns others off is what intrigues the core audience of it. HOWEVER - nearly everyone at least kind of liked the title track. A few people swooped in at the last second with negative scores, but it won because the fans liked it and the usual haters were like “okay I can get into this”. This album is dear to my heart and honestly helped me get through a really shitty semester, and I’m happy it performed so well.

**throwaway7650** (9.786): what a fantastic album, the rock/metal sound wasn't something I'd expect myself to like so much but poppy really did that with I Disagree AND (more), which is excellent and will be robbed btw. more than half of this album is 10s to me - this rate has really strong material in general so most cuts could probably be considered robberies but I will *suffer* as this album goes out, especially my 10s/11. all 3 albums have deserving winners but I'm rooting for poppy to win it all. I Disagree is definitely one of 2020's AOTYs and I should've listened to it way earlier last year, mb poppy

**qazz23** (9.500): I like the genre switching on the album, it's very chaotic but still compelling; the bonus tracks are good also

**plastichaxan** (9.257): Poppy, as an artist means a lot to me, i literally decided to name myself after her and this album perfectly captures why, it’s never the same thing, even in a single song it’s always switching up keeping you at expectation of what’s coming next and breaking those expectations and that’s just what i want to do as a person and as an artist.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.236): I deeply regret that it took me until this rate to listen to this album, it's absolutely incredible and one of my favourite 2020 releases I think. The bonus tracks are really the only thing taking down my average here, and it's not even by that much.

**hikkaru** (9.107): this album kinda holds a special place in my heart for making me way more open to harsher guitar work and vocals. turns out i like metal i just hate men screaming. women can scream at me all they want though

**whatsanillinois** (8.857): great but bonus tracks are kinda :/

**AHSWeeknd** (8.857): What an album! I really didn’t expect to like it so much. Honestly a 10/10

**sufjancaesar** (8.786): This album really screams liberation. You can tell what it’s about without really focusing on the lyrics because truly sells that rule-breaking, angsty vibe in production - the lyrics make it that much more moving. On the whole it superbly captures the agony and ecstasy discovering oneself. Unfortunately, the bonus tracks don’t match up to the rest

**iniekcja\_** (8.571): This was the project that actually made me interested in Poppy as a musician, it's really impressive how she constantly reinvents herself and the art just keeps getting better. It's definitely not as great as Flux but works both as a lovely stepping stone and a good album by itself

**sarcasticsobs** (8.479): this was going to be my highest rated record since the moment this rate was announced, poppy snapped

**skargardin** (8.286): Poppy's best work so far no doubt. Even if Poppy never returns to this particular sound (I mean there's Eat I guess, but as an album whole), I'm glad that we got this incredibly fresh project. Poppy's artistry really is so unique.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.250): Just a fantastic album, not really any major misses, really good from back to front and some absolute bangers

**oliviagodrigo** (8.214): the entire project is obviously borrowed from japanese rock/heavy metal and i usually hate when white artists profit off japanese culture but she’s clearly not making a profit so it’s ok

**stryxen** (8.100): the only album here i didn’t know well beforehand and it’s probably the best lol

**buddhacharm** (8.000): Me when I dis- **GUNSHOTS**

**moooo566** (8.000): thank you for making me rate this i forgot how good it was

**celladonn** (8.000): Loove this album, probably one of my most played of last year. The bubblegum metal sound is super fun!

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.964): Though my "least favorite" of the three, Poppy having her most versatile sound moments here was a joy to hear. I think with it, and all the things happening behind the scenes, she really set her foot on pinning her songwriting, I think

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.929): I usually cannot even tolerate metal music. But combining the heaviness of metal with the levity and sweetness of pop music…it just works so well on this album! My girl Poppy is a true artiste.

**mrmoody112** (7.821): my go to album when i feel like disagreeing

**Brendon-Urine** (7.714): Poppy.Computer is still my fav album of hers, but the fact that she went from that to this in less than 3 years is one of the coolest transitions in music. The best part is that this album is still so undeniably Poppy, even with a complete genre change.

**bulforster** (7.579): This album (not including the bonus songs) doesn't really have a bad song on it. I don't know why I waited until now to listen to it when I was all over her first two. Her messing with song structure can get a bit tiring on some songs but when it works, she kills it.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.571): I had no idea Poppy made music up until this album came out, and more surprising than that was finding out that she's actually pretty good. This is a really solid album and it did its job: made me interested in following whatever she puts out there.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.536): Wow... talk about a rollercoaster of an album! I'm just glad that I knew a couple of songs from this album going into it, so I kinda had an idea of what it sounded like and wasn't completely thrown of by it. The original version is definitely a no skips album, but I didn't really like deluxe songs. I see why they weren't included on the album. I actually liked it a lot more than I thought I would. I think if I had to score this album as a whole, I would give it an 8.5/10. I can see myself revisiting this album every once an a while, whenever I'm just angry for no reason. Overall, even if it's not entirely my sound, I really loved this album.

**TiltControls** (7.464): Loved the album! My average was much higher on the first pass, and then I realize I was listening to the standard edition. The bonus edition songs brought the score down a bit, but still really enjoyed the album! Glad I did the rate since I might have passed this by longer if not for that!

**bigbigbee** (7.321): “it’s minor key….HAHAHA got you it’s in major key now!” the album. (I really like this technique so I like the album a lot)

**ReallyCreative** (7.179): this album has a lot of fun moments but I more often than not feel like there's some polishing that could be done to really elevate some of the songs in the 8 range to 10s. It's a fun, bold effort, though.

**metanoira** (7.150): there are so many gems in this album but it does fall flat in quite a few places. she has so much potential and im excited to hear more material from her!

**mudkip1** (7.107): this album is extremely unbalanced but i think that makes me like it more? she clearly is experimenting her head off here and it's a neat experience to listen through. not all the songs land but they don't all have to!

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7.000): The best way to explain this album is if you were at a music festival and you had an indie pop artist, a bubblegum pop artist, and a nu metal band all playing at the exact same time. It's wild how the genre changes at times, but the album does maintain a mostly aggressive nature to its sound, which contrasts to Poppy's airy vocals quite nice.

=====

akanewasright: **jackisboredtoday** (6.914): I like this album a lot for what its going for and how out-there it is, and I’m keeping that in mind when I score it, even though its kinda a lot to take in sonically in a way that means I may not return to it a lot

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.857): god this album would have legit been straight 10s if she just leaned fully into the metal and ditched the pop...i know i’m saying this on POPheads but

**jman457** (6.843): I feel like there are too many ideas on this record, a more streamlined focus on what it is would make this record a lot stronger.

**veryanniev** (6.793): if you love this album and yet you’ve never listened to IC3PEAK then I don’t know what you’re doing with your life

**cremeebrulee** (6.500): i definitely have a lot of respect for poppy, especially after reading through the backstories of some of these songs and learning they're mostly about her emancipating herself from a toxic partner and becoming the truest version of herself. i don't vibe with it sonically at times and it's definitely my least favorite of the albums here, but i did save and enjoy a few tracks (i disagree, fill the crown, don't go outside). this has always been one of those projects that i've been meaning to listen to in full, so i'm glad this rate has given me a chance to do that!

**Vultuxe** (6.000): 5 it's hard for me to sit through a poppy album, she leans towards a side of alt pop that is (far) beyond my taste, it feels like satire but it's not. I do like some things though. 5 for indifference

**wexpyke** (5.857): last concert I saw before covid :( it was really fun

**frogaranaman** (4.929): sounds like if that one Twitter bot that watches 1000 hours of a sitcom then writes a script did the same thing but for a nu-metal album

**vayyiqra** (4.286): Well, this is embarrassing. Poppy is an old fave of mine, I loved Poppy.Computer and her bizarre YouTube channel, and liked Am I a Girl? I like metal sometimes, and similar genres like industrial. In hindsight her ending that latter album with a foray in metal was kind of a bad sign for me though, since I liked "Play Destroy", but "X" was a little too heavy for my tastes. This album is basically her taking those tracks as a jumping-off point for a whole album of industrial-sounding pop-metal that is kind of impressive in how it leaps between genres, but there's also the problem that I just don't like this album. I've tried, I really have. I was worried about my ballot being rejected, in fact, which is why I wrote a comment for every song. I also have heard the whole thing front-to-back several times and found comments I made from months ago where I consistently say that I don't "get" this album or care for it. If you love this album, more power to you. I know some of you won't like Cape God or Miss Anthropocene, both of which I enjoy, so fair enough. I kind of wish we'd rated some other album in place of this one, but it was popular enough to justify it, I guess. Anyway, I feel kind of bad I didn't look more into this album's lyrics, which might have helped, though I know the basic narrative is about her mistreatment by Titanic and I can empathize with that. (Seriously, screw that guy.) It's just that sonically, this was not what I wanted from Poppy at all. I really just prefer her older stuff, that's all there is to it. I even tried to keep from being too harsh with my score, but her average is still low. I did everything I could to make myself like this album and it just didn't work. Oh well, not everyone has to like the same things.

I'm really, really happy with how this went. Massive thank you to King, one of the best people I know, for saying yes when I asked you to host with me in July. I love you so much, and I don't think I could have done this without you

Thank you all for participating, for showing up to the reveal, and for making me laugh and smile with your comments. And honestly thank you so much to TK and the rate committee for thinking of me for this rate. 

I'll be eagerly refreshing the thread waiting for Tilt's stats, because we might have some interesting ones on our hands... I hope at least.

TiltControls: Thanks for the great hosting Akane & King!!!!!!! Amazing rate and amazing reveal!! (And amazing OC shitposts! We love irl performances!!)

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates!

#**Songs**

I don't think many people expected **I Disagree** to sneak ahead and pull out the victory but I am here for it!!!

Though with the surprise comes a slightly lower than normal average. Between all rate winners it currently holds the 6th lowest average and the 2nd lowest average for Winners 3 cycle rate winners (only beating Concrete Angel). Still, this could mean almost anything come actual Winners 3 placement (ex. Juice was bottom 10 scores-wise and still placed 2nd overall)

And across all songs I Disagree is rated 559th overall (out of 6332 songs)

#**Artists**

Well **Allie** landing on the earliest exits list isn't exactly what I would've predicted at all. She sits in a super tie with Madonna (Music), Kelsea Ballerini (The First Time), Lana (Honeymoon), Fall Out Boy (Folie a deux), and Solange (When I Get Home) for artists that couldn't quite crack that top 6 (in 3 album rates). However she is the only artist on the earliest exits list to also have had the highest album average in her rate. So with that and the horse girl win it's almost the same as making top 5 right?

Average-wise we've all rated these women before, so no new additions to the list - but let's see how they've changed. 

(Also we continue the streak of one of the artists for the current rate landing right next to one of the artists in the previous rate - Jolin in this case!)

* **Allie:** 72nd out of 277 artists (previously 95th)

 * Tied With: Robyn, Missy Elliott

 * Below: Tegan & Sara (by 0.001 point)

 * Above: Foster the People (by 0.002 points)

* **Grimes:** 91st out of 277 artists (previously 64th)

 * Below: PVRIS (by 0.004 points)

 * Above: Maren Morris (by 0.007 points)

* **Poppy:** 112th out of 277 artists (previously 128th)

 * Below: Jolin Tsai (by 0.004 points)

 * Above: The Killers (by 0.006 points)

(Also for our guests, Troye moved down one spot and Mitski moved up two spots)

#**Rate**

For the overall average it ranks at 36th out of 129 rates. 

It also gets in the top 10 for highest 11 spread with 75.68% (28/37) songs picking up an 11!! This makes it the third highest album rate to do so, after the 2013 Ultimate and 2020 Sub Faves rate

#**Albums**

So the album page is still a WIP for a bit longer, but I have been working on a slightly better implementation of album tracking! I'll probably get some proper stats for it around All Star season but if you're curious how these 3 albums (roughly) place:

* **Cape God:** 72nd out of 293 albums

* **I Disagree:** 128th out of 293 albums

* **Miss Anthropocene:** 169th out of 293 albums
