https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/sx8inh/kpop_girl_group_smackdown_reveal_day_3_got_no/

# [A tale of things to come](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837510667652300830/895682425038983249/20211007_021455.jpg)

Here it is. The final day. [What you've all been waiting for](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0F2-wTss_E). Who will reign supreme in Day 3 of the Girl Group SMACKDOWN! Rate? You'll find out soon enough! But first some notes from me, and my co-hosts /u/wavingwolves and /u/rickikardashian.

Yesterday we saw a lot of groups sadly make their exit - only the biggest and the best remain. If you missed the Day 2 reveal and want to catch up, [HERE](https://old.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/swh7ph/kpop_girl_group_smackdown_reveal_day_2_are_you/?sort=old) is the link to the thread! 
***

Today we will be revealing songs placing at **#15-#1**.

We'll be starting at **3pm EST**, an hour from now.

**Y'all know the drill:** We will continue using **[pubby.club](https://pubby.club/~/ripplugdj)** for our reveal today. The platform looks a lot like our late plug.dj and **you'll need an account to be able to follow the reveal**. It takes no time to create one!

In case of it not working as well as we hope, we will use **[Beatsense](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj?ref=beatster&u=P17763eac1c32)**!

**Make sure to keep this thread open**, as we will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out. Be sure to look at the banners and rank graphs, as we spent a lot of time on them </3

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): I’m honestly so surprised that both Dreamcatcher songs made day 3? Not that they don’t deserve it, because they definitely do, but outside of their dedicated fanbase they’re not really a hugely-known group in the K-pop sphere. But Scream is so good, I’m usually not an EDM fan but they make it work. The only thing that drags it down for me is I’m not really a big fan of the rapping.

**wavingwolves** (7.1): I'm NOT the biggest fan of Dreamcatcher, actually far from it, but from their songs that mix rock elements with EDM but for some reason this one did work on me. I'm surprised it managed to get a spot on Day 3 after all, but maybe I shouldn't. It is at least pretty different from most of the rate, being your cup of tea or not, and for that I think it does deserve some kind of attention.

# Headbangers

**celladonn** (11): Absolute banger, show me another group that is doing it like this. Scream is what I'm going to do if this song gets paid dust

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (11): The standout track that immediately grabbed me!

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (11): if there’s a group that deserves my 11 it’s them

**moooo566** (11): This is the song that brought me back to kpop after not listening to anything for like 5 years. Aside from being the perfect pop song for my inner power metal listener, it feels like music from a better universe, slightly to the left of our own, where the music industry is actually happy to put hefty budgets and a lot of effort into niche concepts because they're interesting and fun. I mean, I know it's all still about the money, but it's easier to forget when we get tracks like this.

**thedoctordances1940** (11): i just absolutely fucking love this song, the pop-metal edm fusion works so well and it's just an incredible chorus

**1998tweety** (10): now THIS is a serve. Love this sound, it really makes them stick out compared to other ggs.

**2l82bstr8** (10): the potency of that chorus though

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is so good it made me like Deja Vu less because this is so much better. Dreamcatcher suffering from success.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i do want to scream! The yassgrenade has dropped!

**DefaultPophead** (10): They deserve a ten just for the vibes, honestly. This is the only song that made me want to know what the music video looked like and immediately looped when it ended.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): They didn't have to go that hard but they did and I am grateful for it

**Gonza\_90** (10): Dreamcatcher is so great I swear

**hikkaru** (10): really close to getting my 11 it just gets me pumped

**intheaftermath** (10): this was somehow cinematic??? not something i expected from an artist with a profile header of a girl group in pastel dresses

**ivyleaf33** (10): i was incredibly close to giving this my 11 - it grabs you right from the intro and never lets you go

**lady\_sable** (10): genuinely think that a dc queendom performance would kill me

**milkywayinradius** (10): i have developed a Dreamcatcher sword fetish..

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when this goes out

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSSS

**sarcasticsobs** (10): jfc the instrumental during the chorus is *insane*

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ok after listening to these two songs i'm doing a dive into Dreamcatcher's discography wew

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i disagree by poppy but if it was good

**terrencelovescum** (10): brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before.

**thegirlin512** (10): I love the vibes and the beat of this.

**whoisValensi** (10): I was like halfway expecting screamo lol.

**Zypker125** (9.8): Getting a high-fantasy epic as a concept was already 10/10, we need more of more of it in K-Pop. While the chorus drop wasn't my favorite at first, the intensity and cinematic instrumentals drive the song forward to create an epic banger. Amazing choreo and MV, and this was easily my favorite era of Dreamcatcher. This era blew them up in terms of popularity, and I can't say I'm upset at it at all.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): devil... eyes... come...

**BooksAndWhisky** (9.6): This is not a song this is an experience

**TiltControls** (9.5): aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

**toyletpauper** (9.5): Goes insanely hard, being the best blend between k-pop, metal, and EDM.

**yatcho** (9.2): This song is only just a *tad* too over the top to be perfect for me. They fucking SNAPPED in the MV

**-mczrv-** (9): execution is top tier

**akanewasright** (9): “I just wanna make you scream” it’s really not hard to do that, I’m a fucking coward

**anothertown** (9): feels camplike

**bespectacIed** (9): post hardcore queens yup

**ebooks#5454** (9): i appreciate the male eye candy background dancers in this one, other kpop girlies keep up!

**frogaranaman** (9): I DID NOT EXPECT THE METAL INFLUENCES THERE WHAAAAAAT

**PSSST12** (9): Dreamcatchers output is so fucking excellent I should definitely check them out more

**RaphaelArthur** (9): very audacious song, amazing vocals, catchy and unique beat

**Round\_Log401** (9): The instrumental is so cool, love their voices.

**rubbie** (9): Whoever had the idea of spicing up the usual DC sound with EDM-style production is a genius, this is probably my favourite song by them.

**savemeaseat143** (9): I appreciate that Dreamcatcher always releases songs perfect for my Halloween playlist

**throwaway-7650** (9): love this album, stream jazz bar and in the frozen

**waluigiest** (9): Muse sounds good here!

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I’M SAILOR PEG! AND I LOST MY LEG! CLIMBING UP THE TOPSAILS, I LOST MY LEG!

**billie\_\_** (8.5): i really appreciate dreamcatcher for being one of the few kpop groups with a consistent, recognisable, and really good sound.

**bulforster** (8.5): oh no is misandry towards disembodied demon voice going to tank this one

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this feels very halloween-y

**rikarikachan** (8.5): Dance....metal?

**superr\_rad** (8.5): None of these bitches are doing it like Dreamcatcher. Not a single one!!!! I absolutely love this concept and how it connects to Boca and Odd Eye, and the b sides on these albums are also incredible!

**Victerade** (8.5): aged kinda bad but a banger

**agentofscranton** (8): silent night >>> scream

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): doesn't go as hard but it still bops

**BasedButta** (8): a bit better but i prefer almost any other title track from them

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): with the rock style and the title I do kind of wish they'd had like a full-on breakdown with screaming and heavy guitars, but this was still fun!

**pornypete** (8): Scream's an exception. Great song! Those Dami parts!

**Roxieloxie** (8): pirate music yass

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): s p o o p y

**welcome2thejam** (8): Do I actually like them, or I am just happy for this change of pace? The world may never know

**SkylarV** (7.7): An okay song by DC standards, not their strongest title

**ke1per** (7.5): the drama!

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Rather good dark dance pop song and it would be event better if the metal parts of the song were better performed.

**seanderlust** (7.5): I would have slayed this on guitar hero 3

**thGnerd** (7.5): I really enjoy the almost djent feeling it gives

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Guitars should have been turned up, like, if they’re gonna do the metal thing they should just do the metal thing

**Cooler\_lin** (5.5): i like the first verse and prechorus but i didnt really like the chorus...rest of the song was kind of forgettable imo

**DaBigBoi** (5): Devil. Arse. Come. Women dun die.

**wavingwolves** (10): Ah, the sudden hit! Rollin', a 2017 song, became a huge hit on the charts after this [compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfHWIqJkEf4) of them performing it for the South Korean military became viral in Korea. It's hardly uncommon for girl groups to perform for the military, which is mandatory for roughly 2 years for Korean men, but no group ever found this level of popularity by doing it. Song is great too and I was into it back in 2017 as well.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): I actually HATED this song. I hated it in 2017 and hated it just a month ago. I was considering giving it my 0 when this rate was first announced. And then with every listen of it that I did, my score just kept going up. What can I say…it’s just a really fun song and I can see why the Korean GP stan so much too.

# [Loved the year of 2017](https://c.tenor.com/4YyKFhHNkd0AAAAd/soobtolis-soobin.gif)



**brokebutter** (11): BRAVE GIRLS YOU READY EXCLAMATION MARK

**Sloaneyy** (11): Lollin' Lollin' Lollin'!

**-chilazon-** (10): The sound of summer for 2021! This will be iconic for many years to come!

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop

**akanewasright** (10): how do you hate a literal rush of sunshine?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN!

**becca** (10): ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the most special things to happen in kpop ever. Like idk how can you feel anything but intense pride and happiness for this song and everything it represents. Truly an iconic, lighting in a bottle moment. You can't recreate this

**bluetriangles04** (10): Seeing everyone doing this dance in the K-Pop world was like watching one of those Disney crossover shows.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): i’m so glad they finally got recognized

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): their up & down moment... iconic, legendaric, spectacular. i scream my lungs out with minyoung during that last JUST ONLY YOU!!!!!!!!! every time

**cremeebrulee** (10): this choreo is giving the track team warmups

**Esh\_Kebab** (10): The most surprising thing about the whole Rollin saga is how the song didn't already smash back in 2016.

**fadedblue09** (10): my most played song of 2021 being a 2017 song….ugh their power

**lady\_sable** (10): i'm so glad that brave girls are finally getting the attention they deserve

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): I LOVE IT. Bop. I don’t understand how they stayed nugu after dropping a song like this

**mengzhongmeng** (10): brave girls 2017 were already successful in my mind, deepened -> high heels -> rollin' was a great run!

**metanoira** (10): this is everything RIGHT with tropical house

**Nixon4Prez** (10): Rollin' finally getting what it deserved was the best part of 2021

**notallslendermen** (10): The perfect summer bop

**notarobot3675** (10): go girls!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this smashing 4 years later was like witnessing the second coming of christ

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this song deserves everything

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Me and my friends were obsessed with this song in 2017 because we knew what was up!

**rubbie** (10): Love the girls' surprise success story, the song is obviously killer too - that chorus is irresistible.

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSSS!

**skargardin** (10): ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN

**superr\_rad** (10): this has always been a good song, im so happy Korea randomly picked it back up in 2021! The choreo is iconic too.

**Tazzachar** (10): Okay I added this to my playlist, the Kygo sampled chorus makes this song super catchy

**thegirlin512** (10): Another eleven contender. It's super catchy and I love it. Even my non pop/kpop loving friends and family like it to, which is very impressive.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Yeah, that's a monster hook

**whoisValensi** (10): I was ahead of the curve on this one, you guys are all late.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): is this indie

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): it's a little shouty and dated but you can't help but forget the world around you and dance when listening to it. no wonder it became a sleeper hit, it's absolutely infectious (and the sumemr rebranding was the right call, they really had those girls gyrating their hips crouched in heels on wooden stools for no reason)

**bulforster** (9.5): The production sounds like it's trying to sell me cheap holiday tickets on youtube so props to the girls for slaying so hard over it, the brash vocals really sell the chorus.

**Cooler\_lin** (9.5): A CLASSIC, for EVERY event!! happy vibes only! i sang along the whole time, shoutout to minyoung she ate

**dlong56655** (9.5): love that they got their moment

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): https://c.tenor.com/qUq4XIrBWKUAAAAC/ru-pauls-drag-race-rpdr.gif

**rikarikachan** (9.5): God, whose idea was that arm/elbow move lmao, iconic. This is pure serotonin.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): “i wanna you, you, you” kpop is not in a dearth of great prechoruses, and the payoff to the first half of the actual chorus in this song is one of the highest, if not *the* highest, in this rate.

**Awkward\_King** (9): stream simbi

**bigbigbee** (9): I am thrilled for Brave Girls that this blew up but feel slightly uncomfortable when I watch the MV and think about the reasons why it did. I don’t think I’m a prude and I love sexy choreography, but the way that girl groups are brought to the army to “inspire the troops” has never sat super well with me. That being said, that’s my own personal discomfort, and I don’t hold it against Brave Girls whatsoever. I really like this song.

**BooksAndWhisky** (9): Virality deserved, tho the fact that this is a vampire concept fucking sends

**brpr425** (9): So happy this gave them the recognition they deserved!

**chancehugs** (9): I'm so happy this song got the recognition it deserved. Minyoung's vocals really popped off here (but honestly when have they not)

**cuttackone** (9): yeah this a classic

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The way Rollin is so beloved by the Korean military, the same way Carly Rae Jepsen’s Run Away with Me is beloved by Popheads…if only we can get RAWMe to get #1 on Billboard as the Korean public did with Rollin’

**ebooks#5454** (9): you could tell me this was a chloe ting ab workout video and i'd believe you

**en#8502** (9): back when i first heard this before it was this popular (DID YALL HEAR THAT? I'M SO COOL AND UNIQUE!) i didn't appreciate it as much as i do now 🤔 but honestly this has to be my favourite dark horse stories ever, probably, along with "Up & Down" (but at least that didn't take 4 years)

**Gonza\_90** (9): Ended Limp Bizkit

**huntyphobic** (9): TOO FUN!!! Deserved the virality. Brave girls you will always be famous.

**jasannn** (9): you kinda had to be there

**JohnnyToby** (9): actually really cute?? Love the little dance

**savemeaseat143** (9): I love a comeback story

**xedophobic** (9): hope to be dragged out of my flop era like this song was

**SkylarV** (8.6): Solid song, carried by great production

**-mczrv-** (8.5): love to see it

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): my big boast is that I was bumping this from the day it came out

**ke1per** (8.5): very smooth build into the chorus and a fantastic post chorus

**Round\_Log401** (8.5): Discovered this song when I first got into kpop in 2017 & I was like why is noone talking about this?

**Victerade** (8.5): saved the girlies career a summer bop

**yatcho** (8.5): Cute high energy song, glad to see they got recognition in Korea

=====

ggsmackdown: **BasedButta** (8): it was a worthy revival and the choreography makes it better but the verses leave something to be desired

**DefaultPophead** (8): This song definitely lived up to the hype.

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Its sung at funerals graduations homecomings proms

**mimins** (8): viral for a REASON. great even if it is not my personal taste

**moooo566** (8): im glad it worked out for them, this is good and deserved to do well

**PSSST12** (8): a little bit generic but ngl its fun and the redemption arc was great so

**sabooyah** (8): I looooooooooooooove the vocal arrangement for this song it's so unique!

**vayyiqra** (8): Love that little melody

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Quite a bop

**throwaway-7650** (7.9): we LOVE the EXID-fication of brave girls, WJSN NEXT!

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): the little song that could

**anothertown** (7.5): i would kill to be mindlessly shopping to this song in the middle of a weekday right now

**billie\_\_** (7.5): i would take a bullet for brave girls i would kill to have yujeong smile at me.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7.5): not my type but that choreo deserves an extra point five

**ivyleaf33** (7.5): i was so confused when i heard my non-kpop fan friend playing it last year, this still feels like that niche gg stan favorite to me

**RaphaelArthur** (7.5): basic but catchy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This instrumental really needs a little more punch to it.

**cherryices** (7): oh this MV makes absolutely no sense with the song

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Cute song and I always love it when a small Kpop group gets a chance to break through but if we’re being honest this is Day 2

**lalafairy18** (7): I can't play this song in public because I don't trust myself to contain the urge to do the choreo for the chorus part

**MimisChoice9763** (7): good song

**seanderlust** (7): "every single day, rolling in the deep" - top 40 radio stations in 2011

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): first i've heard from them and thoroughly enjoyable!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): its cute

**Zypker125** (6.9): Funny enough, the turn-off of the song for me is that the "ROLLIN ROLLIN ROLLIN" parts sound way too high and basically sound like borderline screaming to me, despite Main Vocalist Minyoung trying her best (They almost made the same mistake in Chi Mat Ba Ram).

**prada** (6.5): cute

# [Rollin'... out of here!](https://c.tenor.com/mx3wMp-DLq4AAAAd/txt-soobin.gif)

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i’ll be honest i dont remember this one and i listened to it 3 times already

**DaBigBoi** (6): Past BG members rollin’ in their graves and punching the air.

**moonagenightmares** (5.8): i still dont understand why out of all the great forgotten 3rd gen gg songs this one blew up

**ChickyDipper** (5.5): I'm so happy for them that they finally gained success after their hardwork but Rollin' is still a very average song to me 😬

**apatel27** (5): Pretty safe with the vocals

**Flippantry** (5): Let's just say, this didn't go viral because of the quality of the song itself...

**SatC1** (4): I didn't get on the hype train

**DaHumanTorch** (3): that chorus is so unbearable oh my god. what on earth are y'all hearing

**pig-serpent** (3): I'm rollin' my mouse over a different song and clicking it.

**pornypete** (3): I didn't get this blowing up at all

**sage** (2.7): this fawking snooze omfg its so annoying

**GREY** (2): i still cant believe this out of all the forgotten kpop songs had a sudden surge in popularity wheres the love for girlkind

**Stryxen** (2): are they like kpop jess glynne

**majid** (1): wtf

**terrencelovescum** (1): the chorus is just so grating and annoying to my ears. something's off idk :(

**Overall Average**: 7.793 **// Average Controversy:** 1.939 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/du4eqja.png)**

**wavingwolves** (9.050): The miracle group! They managed to hit big 10 years after their debut and countless member line-ups. They were truly living the dream of every nugu group out there, and good for them. While both songs they have in the rate are great, I also highly recommend [Deepened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_pC3KXT2r4) for how good it is and [High Heels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF2Pg5dbYN4) for its campiness.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.250): I don’t know a huge amount about Brave Girls apart from a few of their songs, but I think we can all agree that their story about finding success after several years of nugudom is pretty heart-warming. I’m glad that they’re actually booked and busy now, and also that the success of Rollin’ enabled the better song (We Ride) to find some success as well!

**welcome2thejam** (10.000): After reading their story, happy to give them the perfect score (thanks to them only having two songs, but an accomplishment is an accomplishment!)

**bespectacIed** (10.000): queens, my mothers

**-chilazon-** (10.000): Soooo happy for them! Everyone loves a good underdog story! Hope they keep up the success, I love their recent summer album!

**pieisawesome123** (10.000): After We Ride and Chi mat ba ram would be the true contenders for my 11, alas they are not here though :(

**runaway3212** (10.000): honestly I hate the capitalist lie of 'just work hard and eventually you'll get rewarded' and im not the biggest fan of the military either. However I would be lying if I said I didn't find brave girls' rise to fame incredible touching, them performing for military men, who are stuck in a difficult situation for more than a year, for basically nothing and travelling to remote army bases to perform and then after like 5 years of this and almost disbanding finally being rewarded for all this hard work, it's just genuinely really heartwarming.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.750): their story literally makes me cry I’m so glad they’re finally being recognized

**whoisValensi** (9.250): Am I allowed to say I'm proud of Brave Girls? Because I really am. I've been a long time fan of 'Rollin'' and to watch it blow TF up last year was fucking surreal. I am so glad they've been given another chance not only by the Korean GP but K-Pop fans as a whole.

**Cooler\_lin** (9.250): I am seriously so grateful for their revival, i genuinely thought we ride was going to be their disbandment track

**agentofscranton** (9.250): their story is so iconic - weki meki next please!!

**ebooks#5454** (9.100): holy shit they're so hot

**fadedblue09** (9.000): Currently my favorite girl group atm. We really need more groups that can handle mature concepts to balance the abundance of teen crush concepts

**ke1per** (9.000): great production

**throwaway-7650** (8.950): although I don't love rollin', rooting for them to make day 3

**rslashpoopheads** (8.750): Where's Chi Mat Ba Ram AKA the song of the summer?

**vayyiqra** (8.500): Don't know this group well but they're neat.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.250): It’s amazing how that one viral video of Brave Girls performing Rollin would really change the tides for the group. I am so happy they are included in this rate! (Brave Girls bias: N/A)

**dekubaku** (4.000): Not my taste of music but I'm glad for them for their newly found fame.

**pig-serpent** (3.000): These girls aren't just brave, they're heroes! There is nothing these brave girls wouldn't do for their country. These girls died in Afghanistan defending my freedoms and I will never forget that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): I honestly just find this song very boring. It’s not horrendous or anything but quite frankly I don’t see why this is so loved? Both this and Bad Boy fall in the camp of very overrated RV songs to me. I’m gonna be mean and say I’m glad it didn’t even make top 10 <3

**wavingwolves** (0): There's something about these dark sounding and looking girl group concepts that Western fans would *always* cream themselves over that I never enjoyed much, after all I was an original cute/bright concept fan, but this one takes the cake for me, the biggest example of how much these kind of concepts can bring mediocrity to the table. Sometimes groups can pull it off well, my favourite example being [Fingertip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1n_1jrUEjU), which is a more dark looking concept compared to what GFRIEND had done previously that still hits because it sounds sleek and different. Red Velvet themselves pulled more darking sounding and looking concepts better before, with the biggest example being Bad Boy. But this? This is bland. This is probably the blandest thing Red Velvet has ever released as a title, and I failed to understand the reaction it got upon release and I continue to not understand the acclaim it continues to have now. It sounds bad, it sounds cheap, it sounds muddy and unpolished and it features what is probably my least favourite chorus in the rate. The pre chorus melody + how high Wendy sounds to me is also incredibly unpleasant. I've said it when discussing RBB, but I find the use of high notes in K-Pop annoying sometimes and I think just because a group member is capable of going high it doesn't mean they should. This is also one of the examples of that for me. And now, SM Entertainment winning streak comes to an end. Better luck next time!

# Reveluvs

**-chilazon-** (11): LITERALLY ONE OF THE BEST KPOP SONGS OF ALL TIME

**-mczrv-** (11): this song is everything to me

**becca** (11): Yuh! AND KPOPHEADS WILL BURN FOR HATING THIS SONG.

**bespectacIed** (11): So here I am again, condoning the "only SM wins kpop rates" narrative ... \*jisoo pretty savage voice\* maybe I'm the problem?? But I can't give my 11 to a more emotionally impactful song than this. Psycho is a topnotch song from its haunting but sleek arrangement to its well-executed concept, but we all know it's more than that. I am/was a red velvet fan so this has a bittersweet tone to me, what with its connection to their loooong hiatus and wendy's injury. But this song was also one of my fondest pre-covid memories, this being THEE kpop smash hit during that liminal space between the coronavirus onset (late December 2019) and the official start of the pandemic (March 2020). This song was a reminder for me of those final, beautiful, normal times we've had before plunging into this entirely different way of life. And I know it's entirely too much to put that on one song, but it's true, Psycho is that song. I am still waiting for "hey now we'll be okay" to finally ring true two years after, but you know what??? I think we will be okay.

**ChickyDipper** (11): I'm betting on this winning the whole rate too

**DraculaWeekend** (11): Pop perfection, chills everytime I hear it

**Hwaiting\_\_** (11): Possibly the best kpop song period.

**Jhe116** (11): Popheads darling Red Velvet is going to flop so bad in this rate so I need Psycho to redeem everything

**Kwcty6888** (11): contender for best kpop song of all time

**milkywayinradius** (11): everything about this song is amazing: the vocals, the visuals, the melodies, the choreo, the instrumental, the vampy lipstick and the looks. it's extremely stylish. HEY NOW, WE'LL BE OKAY

**PSSST12** (11): Wbk its between this and FANCY for the rate winner, but Imma give it to psycho just because of that voice crack version from tiktok

**savemeaseat143** (11): I am a loyal fan and I will give this song what it deserves.

**ulalka** (11): This was a very hard decision

**universemates** (11): The song that made me a reveluv. It's a bittersweet era because even though the production, the melody, the vocals, the aesthetic are all 10/10, Wendy got hurt soon after the song was released. It's fitting in a way that their last message to us before their 1.5 years hiatus was "hey now we'll be ok".

**xedophobic** (11): robbed of a proper promo period sbs gayo daejeon will pay

**2l82bstr8** (10): more unsettling than the actual Halloween song. I love how the synths in the back always seem kinda off

**babadork** (10): Wendy and Seulgi both sound amazing on this song.

**bookthieving** (10): tbh it's more like an 8.5 but i was just so happy that red velvet were making good music again

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): literally slayed. the last good thing before covid

**chancehugs** (10): That high note. You know which one.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): tbh they were right we WILL be okay

**cuttackone** (10): a cultural reset

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): From what I read about Red Velvet, there is a common criticism they received in their earlier years that the group’s tackling of two opposite concepts is confusing. There have been attempts to mix the concepts together in some of their albums but I feel like Psycho is the best song that showcases both their “Red” and “Velvet” sides really well thanks to its sophisticated, mature lyrics benanth a heavy pop production. The fact that this song remains their most streamed song on Spotify should say a lot about how Psycho is one of their signature songs ever.

**Esh\_Kebab** (10): Wendy is absolutely perfect on this track.

**huntyphobic** (10): I think red velvet peaked here. Choreo slayed, vocals slayed, concept slayed, too good.

**JsaKim** (10): will be iconic in like 10 years

**ke1per** (10): she is that bitch, has always been that bitch, will always be that bitch

**KoolFunk** (10): could have easily been my 11 if not for Irene's stylist.

**lady\_sable** (10): the way that this era still has a death grip on my brain cells

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): THEIR MOST ICONIC ERA IDC. Literally such a great song. I can’t listen to it quite the same way after tiktok though

**mengzhongmeng** (10): only question is why they didn't keep the strings from the mv for the streaming version? mv is one the best in the industry

**moonagenightmares** (10): YOU GOT ME FEELING LIKE A PSYCHOOO PSYCHOOOOO

**Nixon4Prez** (10): Fuck SBS

**notarobot3675** (10): they did that!

**rubbie** (10): Masterful, stunning, jaw-dropping.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): unbelievable. the percussion in the chorus, hell ya. styling in this video is insane. “i'm original visual”

**SatC1** (10): WENDY

**superr\_rad** (10): there’s a reason why kpop fans go crazy over this song. It’s incredible!! The production, the vocals, the music video aesthetics… god damn perfect all around.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): easily my favourite red velvet song it is just SO GOOD

**throwaway-7650** (10): the MV version with the strings/synths is an 11 I fear

**vaguelycatshaped** (10): Iconic

**whoisValensi** (10): I just think that everything about Seulgi during this era... But also wow wish those added synths/strings from the MV were in the streaming version, real missed out opportunity. (This is me saying that I technically rated the MV version idc. It's like a 10 either way but those added synths/strings are fucking lush as hell.)

ggsmackdown: **xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): why did i only learn today that that one tiktok sound comes from this song…also why did i actually burst out laughing when i heard her sing the first note

**1998tweety** (9.5): RV had a bit of a rough patch with RBB into Zimzalabin and then Umpah Umpah, so Psycho came at the perfect time and delivered just what was needed. International fans tend to prefer their Velvet side (and I'm no exception) and for good reason. That's not to say their Red songs are bad, I actually think it's more that their Red songs are more experimentally and adventurous, so when RV sticks with R&B or something more balladesque, it's less divisive. I love this song but my one critique is that last chorus needed to be longer and that the chorus from the MV feels a bit more full. I'd love an orchestral version of the song.

**BasedButta** (9.5): ok apparently the spotify version doesnt have all the instrumentals so i thought this would be a seven at most but i kinda fucking love it now

**Zypker125** (9.5): This will probably win the rate, which is fine I guess, I would prefer something else to win though so hopefully we see an upset

**bluetriangles04** (9): Psycho is a classic, tried and true pop song melded with the Red Velvet quirkiness which makes it a surefire bop.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (9): seriously the girl with the the high notes im frothing

**ebooks#5454** (9): i would 10 this BUT i seem to have a streak of kpop songs ruined for me bc school peers of mine decide to perform dance covers. one year in uni, 5 girls from our school's kpop club performed this for a banquet. the entire hall was :audience: like i mean complete radio silence i shit you not, it was so awkward. and i was wondering why no one was reacting bc our school tends always hype up performers. but then i realized that earlier in the night, the Official KPop Dance Group at our school had performed and they got BEEF with the kpop club. the Official Kpop Dance Group is also full of trained dancers and students who are members of many other dance classes and groups on campus while the Kpop Club is uhm...well...a bunch of cringey koreaboos? that seems harsh to say but some of these members be flat out wack maybe disrespectful to korea? :skull: they also got like the worst graphic designs/flyers i've ever seen. one of the dancer's was also my close friend's ex who was a mess of a handful...its really the way this club picked its 5 most problematic people to perform this. let the record show, they never performed at another banquet again i think. oop! that being said, this song is awesome vibes i do like it.

**rikarikachan** (9): YESS RED VELVET. I don't personally love this one, vibe-wise, but it's really good.

**Round\_Log401** (9): Really good song, would even say one of their best. Unrelated to the situation this really is Wendys song she looks & sounds spectacular.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i think red velvet finally broke the curse of all songs named psycho sucking ass

**Victerade** (9): its good but tbh i dont like it that much... the styling at this era was amazing but the song isnt exactly my thing

**yatcho** (9): this is great for later era RV

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.6): Great instrumental and longevity but slightly too boring for people to be hyping it as their best track. Also obligatory FUCK SBS

**en#8502** (8.5): meh this definitely grew off me a little

**ivyleaf33** (8.5): easily one of their best velvet title tracks

**notallslendermen** (8.5): If this were the version from the music video I'd give it a 10, the chorus just sounds so empty without those synths.

**thegirlin512** (8.5): Okay I know this song, and it's the only RV song I knew before the rate. I like it. Especially the chorus. It's super catchy. Verses are a bit more forgettable.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): posty outsold but this still bops

**toyletpauper** (8.3): If it was the MV version, it would go up a half point.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): gaslight anthem

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): it's just a brilliant chorus innit

**billie\_\_** (8): when they say hey now we'll be okay i...

**celladonn** (8): OVERRATED! But still very good

**CrimsonROSET** (8): sigrid could do psycho but red velvet couldnt win BBC'S sound of 2018

**lalafairy18** (8): Solid velvet track, but I still believe Bad Boy reigns supreme

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): oh she's sweet (velvet) but a psycho (red)

**2dina3dworld** (7.9): this is very white bread but like,,, it’s not terrible. It just sounds empty, but what is there does kinda slap

**bulforster** (7.8): bop!

**jasannn** (7.8): Y’all psycho if you think the version with the annoying strings in the chorus is better.

**dlong56655** (7.5): this is fine but MASSIVELY overrated

**RaphaelArthur** (7.5): amazing vocals but not catchy beat

**astrologicalangel** (7): I really want to like this song but every time it starts all I can hear is Secrets by OneRepublic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is definitely good! I just don’t care about it at all!

**fadedblue09** (7): Would like this more of it wasnt such a note-by-note copy of Bad Boy

**intheaftermath** (7): it's cute and does the cuteness well but I think RV shines when they play with harmony

# #psycho #monster

**Cooler\_lin** (6.5): i got tired of this track pretty fast and it is really generic to me, seulgi ate down tho

**prada** (6.5): this aged so bad errrr… yeri easily outslayed the other fad members as usual though

**brokebutter** (6): i used to like this song but its actually so boring

**GREY** (6): imagine my shock when red velvet served best disbandment song ever only for them to crawl out of the grave just to release queendom

**mimins** (6): I like the verses and about halfway through the chorus but I don't like the second half of the chorus and I think the rap is horrific. Ending is nice though. I would love to see Blackpink do this concept tbh

**pornypete** (6): It's a decent song. But it gets a bit repetative for me

**sabooyah** (6): Painfully average and sounds like a OneRepublic song circa 2009. I like the ending though!

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Omg why does the beginning part remind me of that off key Stay Gold tiktok remix 😭

**DefaultPophead** (5.5): Song is only this high because Seulgi sounds absolutely gorgeous in it. The song is almost great and then they add the weirdest, most questionable noises.

**frogaranaman** (5): I'm sorry there's like one scene in this music video that looks like the Look What You Made Me Do dance scene and it's sending me for some reason SKDHDKSH

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why do they use that ugly boom and the intro from Julia Michaels - Issues?

**JohnnyToby** (5): if this was the yt version it would be a ten idk WHY SM took off multiple instruments for the Spotify version BOOOOO

**skargardin** (5): the way the worst festival title is the most successful

**welcome2thejam** (5): Between this and Post Malone's I think I'm just lukewarm on slow paced songs named Psycho

**akanewasright** (4): I can’t get over the English demo lyrics being “you got me actin like a psycho, psycho, got me doing shots of NyQuil, NyQuil”

**Awkward\_King** (4): i cannot explain this on literally any logical level but i want to make a portrait of a lady on fire fan edit to this

**flavasavavandal** (3): Just something about that slow plodding beat makes this borderline unlistenable

**hikkaru** (3): overrated beyond belief omfgggg the way the other two reve festival titles clear this

**metanoira** (3): i prefer their red tracks and this is just mid. also stan twt hyping up that terrible bg cover made me dislike this more.

**pig-serpent** (3): Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles, Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble, Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines, Buy myself all of my favorite things, Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch, Who would have thought it'd turn me to a Psycho?, Rather be tied up with calls and not strings, Write my own checks like I write what I sing

**SkylarV** (3): It's just so slow and boring...

**Stryxen** (3): why is the among us card swipe failed sound effect in this

**vayyiqra** (3): I feel bad because I know English isn't their first language but the chorus is built around a word that makes me cringe. Aside from that, it's just not a fun or catchy song to me. Not why I listen to RV.

**DaBigBoi** (2): Instrumental is really muddled throughout tbh…and the chorus is a letdown with how monotonous it feels. I also don’t like the title itself.

**sage** (1.8): this chorus is so horrendous omfg i cried . when this places top 10 i will not be having it

**CaptainDaisyG** (1.5): I think the reason why my RV scores are so low is because everyone talks about how good they are, which just makes the disappoint hit harder.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Literally the worst song they've released.

**terrencelovescum** (1): where's the news and the media? except it's where's the strings and the synths? really should be a 10 but this is for sm for not releasing the mv version as the official version on streaming versions. i genuinely thought my phone was broken the first time i heard it on spotify.

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (0): I genuinely do not understand why this song is their biggest, it is my least favorite

**letsallpoo** (0): the worst chorus of their career

**runaway3212** (0): NAURRRRR!

ggsmackdown: # Red Velvet

---

**Overall Average**: 6.933 **// Average Controversy:** 2.344 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/OhzQ7pv.png)**

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.500): I used to be a REALLY big Reveluv, like they were in my top 3 groups and I was obsessed with their discog. This rate pretty much covers the time period where I unstanned because I wasn’t feeling the music so much. I think a big part of it is that I don’t like what happened to both their “Red” and “Velvet” sides. The decrease in quality from Dumb Dumb and Rookie to Power Up and Umpah Umpah, and from Automatic and One of These Nights to Bad Boy and Psycho…what a shame! At least we have their trademark wacky songs like RBB and Zimzalabim here <3

**wavingwolves** (4.960): A group known for their discography, which is indeed good if not a little overrated, but that had a bit of a rough time when it comes to titles during the period we covered. I don't we are past it, with Queendom being released last year and being very unexciting to a lot of non-fans, but even in this period they still managed to have some of their best b-sides to date, which is why I would fully recommend people to check out their full releases around this time, even if you might not have enjoyed their titles that much. My personally favourite mini is the Rookie mini and my personally favourite full is The Perfect Red Velvet (or The Perfect Velvet, whichever), which had songs already covered in the previous girl group rate, but are still worth a listen.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.740): greatest girl group of all time... kinda killed me to not give them my 11 again but they've been my most scrobbled artist the last 3 years in a row so they'll survive

**-chilazon-** (9.200): Just queeeeeennnss. Genuinely such a great discography. I'll try not to be biased, but their songs are too good!

**notarobot3675** (9.000): my ults and the group that got me into kpop

**universemates** (8.920): they have my favorite discography in this rate (and possibly in kpop) but their title tracks are usually hit or miss for me. If you have free time, I encourage you to dive into their immaculate b-sides!

**xedophobic** (8.800): sometimes they're very queerbaity and a bit cultural appropriationy but they deserve that!

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.560): Irene is my favorite member because I too hate men

**sarcasticsobs** (8.440): a weaker contingent of songs was picked to sabotage them (outside “psycho”), i just know it

**savemeaseat143** (8.420): my ult (:

**anothertown** (8.400): my first ult :(

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.380): The day SM gives them the f(x) treatment is the day it is officially time for me to haul my old ass out of kpop

**cremeebrulee** (8.100): this group is so obsessed with near death in their videos it’s a bit alarming

**TiltControls** (8.100): Ignoring RBB I really really really loved their songs here

**ebooks#5454** (8.000): this group makes me crave red velvet cake every single time i don't even like cake

**Alumineous** (7.800): I prefer vanilla.

**sublimeMusic** (7.800): I am unsure how many songs of theirs I would rate ten but they consistently give an average of 8 on all their songs including b sides which I think is better overall

**bulforster** (7.780): bops!

**throwaway-7650** (7.780): only one (1) song dragging down the average. #RBB_OUT

**vayyiqra** (7.600): I guess the group I'm stanning for in this rate, as the one I've listened to the most. Hot take but RV's visuals (their MVs and artwork) are sometimes unpleasant and not to my taste. However they make some real bangers and have a very solid discog. I wish we weren't rating two of the few songs by them I don't like much.

**Zypker125** (7.440): I was low-key hoping that one of RV's B-sides would be on this rate so that I could use my 1's, but their title tracks are usually passable.

**bespectacIed** (7.200): Oh how the mighty has fallen..... no further comment

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.100): After going through their full discography, it’s really easy to see why K-pop fans say that Red Velvet has the best B-sides among their girl group peers. While their song entires for this rate don’t match the quality with their entires in the first K-pop song, they are still amazing (except RBB) nonetheless and I am sure if some of their B-sides are included in this rate, Red Velvet would have a higher chance to win. (Red Velvet bias: Seulgi)

**MToms** (7.000): Of the Big 3 I had heard the least of their songs, and it definitely influences how I feel. The more you listen the more you get to love songs.

**brpr425** (6.800): They have one of the best discographies in K-Pop, so it pained me to give some low ratings this time around.

**hikkaru** (6.800): zzb and umpah x2 smash but i'm not looking forward to the other 3 lasting way too long

**ke1per** (6.700): the bravery is exquisite

**anzunagi** (6.600): I like to pretend ReVe Festival Day 1 & 2 don't exist

**SkylarV** (6.580): Used to stan but they haven't really been to my liking the past few years

**whoisValensi** (6.400): RV... RV... RV... What can I say? Well, I think I'll start by saying their output has been all fucking over the place for me recently. I mean you can see that immediately from the 0 to 8 to 10 to 4 to 10 set of scores I produced for this set of songs. (If Queendom was here it would be like a 4...) I get they're supposed to be like "the diversive group" (tho really are they anymore when it comes to SM groups????) with their different sides, "Red" & "Velvet", but I feel like they're stuck in a cycle of "this is good" to "this is bad" with almost every other release. But at the same time when they get it right holy shit they get it right. And while it's probably a bit obvious; I've always preferred the "Velvet" side to the "Red" side, I can only just hope that they can get back on track with some of this stuff... (Particularly the summer songs... Can we get back on track with those...)

**RiviereDeMemoires** (6.400): I would have chosen different songs for them like Dumb Dumb or Red Flavor or Bad Boy

**runaway3212** (6.400): We already rated their strongest singles however they still have some absolute bangers here and I still really enjoy their vocals a lot.

**fadedblue09** (6.300): Save for a couple of embarrassing misses, i don't get why their later stuff should be that polarizing

**welcome2thejam** (6.200): Read comments saying Red Velvet couldn't get their actual best tracks picked for this rate, and based on my average scores, I suppose I'm inclined to agree. If y'all got the deep cut recommendations though, I'm all ears

**rslashpoopheads** (6.200): I feel like I either love or hate every RV song.

**donutseer** (6.000): poor representation here, they have dozens of better songs.

**AxymHeart** (5.800): I tend to like the Velvet more than the Red

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.300): what the fuck happened here

**thegirlin512** (5.200): Full disclosure, I'm not a RV fan. I never got the appeal. Maybe this rate will change that? (Spoiler: No. It didn't.)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.900): before i did this rate i was under the impression that red velvet was the only kpop group i actually loved. after doing this rate i realized that it was just russian roulette

**pig-serpent** (4.800): The impression of kpop I had before I really looked into it was that it incoherently jumped between 5 genres every song with poor transitions and overall sounded like a huge mess. I no longer think that's true for kpop as a whole, but it's certainly true for most Red Velvet songs.

**bookthieving** (3.200): when i started stanning red velvet in 2017... we were all so happy that day... it's hard to imagine how terrible things would soon become

**apatel27** (3.000): All of these just sound like bad cover versions of better songs

**dekubaku** (2.400): I'll be frank that I was never really into RV. Liked their songs but after the Irene scandal, it became difficult for me to truly enjoy the songs. Sad!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BANGER!! I was obsessed with this the moment I heard the switch-up in the chorus. Standard K-pop ballads suddenly turning rock/metal is something I didn’t know I needed. Great MV too.

**wavingwolves** (8.1): It's good! I love a good slowburn-y song and the way this song grows and progresses is really interesting to me. I find it to be a really charming song too and, even if at some points I'm not the biggest fans of the vocals, I find the overall delivery to be really good. Again, I'm far from a Dreamcatcher fan, but their run in this rate was really interesting to see, so I can't be super mad about this landing here.

# #TeamOlivia (do the 2021 Ult rate)

**AxymHeart** (11): Perfection

**CrimsonROSET** (11): remind me before the reveal if i want to swap this to my 11 or not

**lady\_sable** (11): siyeon's voice gives me fucking chills

**nt96** (11): Rating 65 songs when most of them sorta blended together was as challenging as it was banal, this one, however, stood out the most. Perhaps it was the guitars? Maybe it had an edgier soundscape? Who knows? They understood the assignment and made sure they stood above the rest, and for that reason, they get my 11.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i feel like that gif of winnie the pooh ascending every time that chorus hits. pump that key change into my fucking VEINSSSS

**Zypker125** (11): I mean, what else is there to say? Combining an intense, cinematic rock chorus with sentimental ballad-like verses is pure genius and no K-Pop song has ever been able to replicate its magic. It's aggressive, it's gritty, and yet it's sad and emotional at the same time. This may not be my favorite Dreamcatcher song (that would go to either Mayday or Chase Me), but I think this is Dreamcatcher's most *cinematic* and ambitious song, and even though I love some other songs in this rate, there's just no other answer for what my 11 would be.

**-chilazon-** (10): Starts out dreamy and magical, and then the way the chorus hits . . . Also, "so now, I'm holding this pain"

**akanewasright** (10): Olivia’s looking kinda quaint right now

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): damn this goes real fucking hard

**ChickyDipper** (10): they had no right to make something so beautiful

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love the drama

**ebooks#5454** (10): this is like dramatic video game music and i love that for them

**hunnybee12** (10): the kpop horror concept peaked here. everyone still trying should just give up now

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh this gives anime opening vibes

**metanoira** (10): THE DRAMAAAAA

**mimins** (10): the mv is stunning, like I felt inspired to paint a few of the screenshots. I adore the storytelling because you rarely see that in kpop mvs these days. I adore the rock elements too and the general progression of the song also feeling like a story. I nearly gave this the eleven but I realized it sounded better on tv speakers compared to headphones.

**poemforsmallthings** (10): This song is just gorgeous with its haunting vocals, the way it builds up to that explosive chorus, the key change and that outro I can't not give it a 10

**PSSST12** (10): The contrast with the piano and the rock verses is SO GOOD

**RandomHypnotica** (10): my favourite moment in the rate was hearing this for the first time and not having any idea what to expect

**reiichitanaka** (10): If I was taking the MV into account this would be my 11, because Utena is one of my favorite anime of all time and the references just killed me

**rotating3Dtext** (10): it’s giving anime opening

**savemeaseat143** (10): I just love all of their output and this one has great drama, intensity, and build-up

**seanderlust** (10): okay wait this goes OFF. some rock music is valid

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): during the first verse i was like UGH i'm gonna hate this but then the chorus happier than ever'd me

**throwaway-7650** (10): not a ballad but balladphobia is still in play I fear

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Oh my god SLAAAAY! SLAY! I was a sucker for TXT’s emoboy schtick so of course this just hits all the right notes for me!

**waluigiest** (10): I was ready to write this off until the chorus came in…. Excellent

**whoisValensi** (10): Note to self, listen to more DC, just do it.

**xedophobic** (10): the layers.... they're layering

**1998tweety** (9.5): Every song named Deja Vu slaps.

**intheaftermath** (9.5): sounds just like cruel summer :/ someone get taylor that writing credit ASAP!!! /s

**ke1per** (9.5): very Michelle Branch meets Amy Lee meets K-pop

**yatcho** (9.5): I love a group with a flair for the dramatic. the piano and rock elements mixed with kpop is just *chef's kiss* to me

**2l82bstr8** (9): a spiritual experience, though it stops and starts a little too much

**anothertown** (9): there's some kind of chord in the final chorus that sends me to heaven tbh

**apatel27** (9): Finally some good fucking food. Crazy what happens when you try doing something other than a basic bitch edm beat and keep it cohesive

**bigbigbee** (9): Extremely unnecessary key change aside this bangs

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9): this one i get!

**cremeebrulee** (9): this is hot

**ivyleaf33** (9): where did they even get the budget for this mv??? stunning, showstopping, incredible, etc.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): Well this fucking rules!

**moooo566** (9): there was a thread the other day about whether the age of music videos was over, and everyone talked about streaming and mtv, but the real answer is just that we don't use enough swords in our music videos

**nosnoop** (9): A bit awkward if you cannot even pronounce the title of the song properly....  Good song otherwise, would have been a 10.

**sabooyah** (9): Anime opening, movie soundtrack, fmv backing track, angsty fanfic inspo, yeah they did that.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): more rock in kpop, plz.

**thegirlin512** (9): It's so sad and dreamy I love it.

**SkylarV** (8.8): Great meld of stylings, a rock ballad title that works surprisingly, the key change at the end is inspired

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.6): Dreamcatcher never miss and that’s a fact

**celladonn** (8.5): One of Dreamcatcher's weaker title tracks imo, a bit too much buildup for not quite enough payoff. But still great.

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Even though this feels very dated, as in like music I listened to over ten years ago, this is unlike anything I've heard in kpop before. I like how it gets heavy but they still maintain those gorgeous vocals.

**Victerade** (8.5): amazing song! love silent night from the b sides

**becca** (8): its aurkay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Evanescence realness!

**Cooler\_lin** (8): pretty vocals and rock instrumental in the chorus>> i wish there were more rock sections! love the outro

**en#8502** (8): the escalation is so good

**Flippantry** (8): Not a fan of this sound but I can appreciate where they're coming from, this is a well-made and performed song

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love how do they do pop rock, I feel like kpop doesn’t do that as much (or at least no other songs in the rate do)

**imasalesman** (8): I’ve never heard a dreamcatcher song before but this is so good omg

**runaway3212** (8): yasss

**terrencelovescum** (8): now this is different! poppy-esque in the slow verses then switch to rockier chorus then back and forth.

**TiltControls** (8): This sounds a backing track for a 2000s kingdom hearts amv on youtube (affectionate)

**bulforster** (7.6): Should I have gone through an evanescence phase to get this one?

**chancehugs** (7): Teenage angsty me would've given this an 10. Now I've mellowed abit but I still like it.

**GREY** (7): yassed a bit

**RaphaelArthur** (7): great vocals etc but not for me

**welcome2thejam** (7): ARE YOU READY TO ROCK IN A DRAMATIC SYMPHONIC FASHION

**sage** (6.9): the chorus being amaze while the verses are boring as hell

**BasedButta** (6.5): dreamcatcher has done way better than this many times this one is a bit too grand and doesnt rock out enough apart from the last chorus

**note\_2\_self** (6.5): I appreciate DC for being unique in kpop but Im not super into the music

**flavasavavandal** (6): They’re serving Evanescence when they should be serving Within Temptation

**pornypete** (6): Last few DC titles have been a bit meh for me. Leez/Ollounder are great, but when they do everything, every time, it gets a bit predictable.

**slimboyfriend** (6): Headbanging? In MY k-pop girl group rate??

**DaBigBoi** (5.5): I don’t know why my cousin recommended DC to me when I was an orbit. I just wish the percussion went off a bit more

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): the chorus feels weirdly anticlimactic

**frogaranaman** (5): do the 2021 ultimate rate

**huntyphobic** (5): just sounds kinda outdated

**LesApfels** (5): I love the rock sections and hate the slow ballad sections so this score is a compromise

**mengzhongmeng** (5): not my cup of tea but I appreciate that they found their niche

**rslashpoopheads** (5): One of their more boring songs.

**vayyiqra** (5): From the photos I saw of them, I'd have thought this group made something other than Evanescence-like piano rock ballads

**pig-serpent** (4): On paper this song should have my 11, but I'm not feeling this at all and I'm not sure if I can explain why. Everything about it feels too calculated to work as metal, and the song feels like a novelty more than a real song. On top of that, I find that drums are often the most important part of metal, especially in more groove or core based genres, or any song that wants a big epic chorus, and the drums on this song sound awful. The low pass filter breakbeaks sound dirt cheap and throughout the song the drums lack enough punch to stand above everything else in the song. They sound like a complete afterthought.

**cuttackone** (2): genuinely hate this group

**prada** (0): the most annoying song to ever exist

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.000): I like some of their earlier titles (Good Night, Chase Me), then over the years I just stopped checking out their new releases. Turns out I was wrong for that! This was my first time hearing both Deja Vu and Scream, and I can confirm that they’re both mega-bops. Also Spotify autoplayed Jazz Bar which is another mega smash so maybe I should listen to The Tree of Language.

**wavingwolves** (7.600): I've said this on both of my comments for their songs, but I'm very much not a fan of Dreamcatcher most of the time, so for them to get a good average for me just tells us about the specific selection we had for this rate. They ended up being the group that managed to have all of their songs make Day 3 and the reason for that is that most of the actual Popheads userbase felt compelled by their sound in some way, even if they were not enamoured with it they could give them props for doing something different in style compared to all other groups. It's very deserving, in that regard, at least!

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10.500): I will make them famous myself if I have to. They don’t have a single bad song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10.500): im not even gonna lie the only reason i did this rate was so i could give dreamcatcher a 10.5 artist average

**Zypker125** (10.400): I mean, they're clearly the girl group that's outputting the best discography/music and it's no contest for me. Deja Vu & Scream aren't my favorite DC songs, and yet they're still by far my favorite of the songs in this rate.

**whoisValensi** (10.000): Despite eating rock music for breakfast daily, I've never really checked out DC. Probably time to change that lol.

**AxymHeart** (10.000): I'm in Insomnia too, discography is unmatched!

**hikkaru** (10.000): my rock/metal queens omfg my straight half jumps when dc comes on

**reiichitanaka** (9.750): I'm probably too biased to make any constructive comment tbh, they're my favorite girl group, hands down.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.500): v. happy this group has carved out a dedicated little niche

**ebooks#5454** (9.500): every girl ik has said they're super gay for this group and i agree completely

**ivyleaf33** (9.500): surprisingly influential group for their limited reach in sk

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): deja \/u (pretend \/ = 11). stream good night + fly high

**-chilazon-** (9.250): Hope they get to keep doing their thing for a long time!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.000): No one told me there was a punk rock K-pop girl group! I think I’ve found my new faves

**anothertown** (9.000): i have a new "this will be my selegend moment" everyday but when we rate their 2021 mini and it all goes out before day 3 it will be my selegend moment

**toyletpauper** (9.000): One of my favorite group sheerly out of their consistency with great songs back to back to back. Gorgeous girls, great musical direction, captivating choreo. They deserve so much more attention, even though I know they will forever be niche.

**vaguelycatshaped** (9.000): Those are definitely DC's strongest tts from the last few years, some of their other tts would have received lower ratings but I can't give less than a 9 for those two

**runaway3212** (9.000): pls give me back my dream thank u very much

**-mczrv-** (8.800): <3

**apatel27** (8.500): I guess their lack of local success stops the rest of the scene from trying to innovate which is a shame

**ke1per** (8.500): they love swords

**Round\_Log401** (8.500): Truly one of a kind in kpop, love that they are bringing their own aspect to it.

**rikarikachan** (8.250): I wish the anime rock vibe worked for me, I really do. They're super unique.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.100): This rate was my chance to finally check out Dreamcatcher after I was floored by their cover of BIGBANG’s BANG BANG BANG. Their music really describes their concept so well and wow, I think I’ll check their discography soon because these songs are giving Harry Potter realness. (Dreamcatcher bias: Dami)

**welcome2thejam** (7.500): Usually don't go for this symphonic alt metal (?) type flavor of rock, but it marries nicely with the K-pop sound and choreography

**bespectacIed** (7.500): "What about dreamcatcher?" if u get u get it

**donutseer** (7.500): another all-round talented group with strong+beautiful vocals, they can pull off a variety of styles.

**fadedblue09** (7.250): I love this group but I’m not sure if these songs would've been my picks.

**Tazzachar** (7.000): I am just so happy there is a kpop girl group doing this genre, and they’re really good at it

**sublimeMusic** (6.500): i havent really liked their title tracks but love their b sides

**pig-serpent** (5.750): I normally love when metal is incorporated into other genres but Dreamcatcher's understanding of metal is surface level at best and feels like cultural appropriation at worst.

**dekubaku** (5.500): Their music is not exactly my taste but I think their sound is very strong.

**rslashpoopheads** (5.500): Most of their songs sound the same but in a good way.

**vayyiqra** (4.500): Another group I don't know - is their thing being "edgy" and kind of influenced by rock and metal? Is that why they wear black a lot? I can't say I liked them a whole lot but they were different at least.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BANGER!!! This song is sooo fun omfg, easily one of my fave MMM songs. I wish it could have snuck into the top 10 somehow but I'm glad it made day 3 regardless.

**wavingwolves** (6.1): This is my favourite song by them in the rate, but even so it's not saying much. I find this enjoyable to some point, but I don't really love it. I think their delivery is the best part of it by far, but sonically it fails to be anything exciting or interesting for me, even if it has a good hook. The verses are kind of sparse and make the song feel like it draaaaags a little bit. Still, they managed to almost make top 10 and I guess this does say something about the favouritism people have for them! Including my insane co-host, I won't cite names.

# 50 year olds who want to be considered hip 

**1998tweety** (11): I mean come on now. Gay rights??? Like this is THE serve, the BEAT, the vocals, the lyrics, the INTRO???? So much sass so much confidence, pure cμnt. The other girls are NOT doing it like this.

**astrologicalangel** (11): I honestly spent so long debating the merits of this over Dingga, but ultimately Hip is their signature song, nothing else can top it

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (11): the sound?? the energy? the concept? hit different

**intheaftermath** (11): There's so much to this song that makes it work so well. The crowd vocals during the chorus are so engaging. The vaguely 1920's electro-swing instrumental sets it apart from anything else in this rate, which is very 2010's synth dominated. I play this song on loop all of the time and it never gets old, it's that perfect blend between exciting and comforting that prevents it from getting too stale or overwhelming on repeat listens.

**waluigiest** (11): this beat??? Is nutty. It’s such a charming refreshing song

**anothertown** (10): cunt

**Awkward\_King** (10): oh my GOD

**bespectacIed** (10): BOP

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I love the part where it sounds like one of the girls spits on the listeners.

**bluetriangles04** (10): KICK IT!

**ChickyDipper** (10): the final stage of the yassification of MAMAMOO

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this electroswing moment... i lose my shit every single time!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): HIP will always be my favorite song from Mamamoo because this defines the group so well while also evolving themselves from simply more than a vocalist group. This song is also unapologetically feminist as fuck, which is so significant considering how sexist South Korean society can be with how they treat female idols. Also, Hwasa’s literally spitting when ending her verse is just to iconic.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): click me, click me~

**hikkaru** (10): 💋👛👠💅🐈🐈🐈

**hunnybee12** (10): i want to live in the universe where this was their disbandment song

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): I could listen to it non-stop

**notallslendermen** (10): My most listened to kpop song of 2020, just perfect

**notarobot3675** (10): iconic incredible visionary and so on and so forth

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this was the only mamamoo song I knew going into the rate and I thought all their songs would be this good (I was wrong)

**rikarikachan** (10): this song is actually the reason why I can remember head shoulders knees and toes in korean

**Round\_Log401** (10): Dare I say maybe their best title track, choreo, mv, styling up until now. Starry Night till HIP was their best era as a group imo.

**sage** (10): how the hell did they go from releasing the worst music ever to this cunty slay

**skargardin** (10): no other song has ever served this much cunt

**superr\_rad** (10): this shit is iconic idk what to tell you

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): hwasa in this video is the reason im gay

**thegirlin512** (10): This is a gorgeous sophisticated sounding bop. The chorus elevated it to a solid ten for me. Very catchy and I will listen to it again

**throwaway-7650** (10): it's just the serve... hwasa and the rest of MMM did that

**vaguelycatshaped** (10): The only kpop choreo I, as a horrid dancer, learned, also this song is a certified BOP

**vayyiqra** (10): This is Boa's "Jazzclub" for this rate (compliment). Also, I like the chaotic video.

**welcome2thejam** (10): What a wild, fun listen. They bring so much energy and attitude, probably the best pop rap track of the rate

**xedophobic** (10): chef's kiss honestly

**savemeaseat143** (9.8): it's good but I wish other songs of theirs could've gotten similar hype

**agentofscranton** (9.5): cacapoo slayed unfortunately

**anagalisgv** (9.5): iconic

**celladonn** (9.5): This is so fun, one of their best songs for sure

**thGnerd** (9.5): Fantastic song, mamamoos best

**yatcho** (9.5): theyre at their best when theyre just serving cunt and having fun

**-chilazon-** (9): This song is iconic, what a diss to the haters!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): bop

**becca** (9): HIP.. HIP.. YUH

**bookthieving** (9): solar's shego cosplay at mama 2019... ngl i was obsessed

**chancehugs** (9): An absolute bad bitch anthem. This song really makes me wish I can twerk so that I can twerk to this song.

**JohnnyToby** (9): it bops what can I say

**lady\_sable** (9): moonbyul's voice...wrow

**majid** (9): this sounds like juice

**pig-serpent** (9): I love the slight electroswing twinge

**runaway3212** (9): YASSss

**Stryxen** (9): im voguing

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): this has a lot of the same problems as Gogobebe but there's so much more interesting stuff going on in the back and it's not afraid to get silly

**akanewasright** (8.5): before listening I thought the “ethnic hip” thing came from this song, because??? I guess I thought one kpop gg had all the racism scandals instead of having them spread out

**en#8502** (8.5): the lyrics have some .... choices but other than that it's pretty good

**ke1per** (8.5): best raps so far with a very funky guitar

**mimins** (8.5): a banger!!! my favorite recent mamamoo song!! the confidence!!

**prada** (8.5): SING IT WHEEIN

**seanderlust** (8.5): the pitched down "hip" reminded me of something that I couldn't place for the longest time and finally it clicked: https://youtu.be/4eyeYobGOcA

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh

**cuttackone** (8): KICK IT

**mengzhongmeng** (8): their best song post ahh oop!

**rubbie** (8): A classic obviously, but I feel they have released better songs

**TiltControls** (8): the bright spot of these tracks and even then it still has a bit too much going on

**useless-sheep** (8): ella lee zot ani washed… give it a listen

**Victerade** (8): BANGER! or used to be... why do all of their songs age so bad

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.9): [Turns out I actually wrote like a LOT about this song back when it came out and I don’t feel the need to repeat myself so I’ll just link that](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/e2hj3o/the_popheads_jukebox_week_145_still_taking_song/f8x9eti/)

**bulforster** (7.8): impressively streamlined

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): love how funky this one is

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): I thought they were talking about their hips for the longest time, but the lyrics are actually about how they want to be considered hip. Solar, you are not that old!!!

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): A whole vibe. Not the best musically, but one of the most lowkey enjoyable in the rate.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Kinda a grower tbh but I still dont consider it to be their best like most people do

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): could’ve been a 10 if it was produced even slightly competently

=====

ggsmackdown: **brokebutter** (7.4): was obsessed with this song when i was getting into kpop not into it anymore

**jasannn** (7.2): one of the better recent mmm songs but its repetitiveness is holding it back

**Bryoneehhh\_** (7): it was a slay at the time

**PSSST12** (7): its ok but this one never really clicked for me.

**RaphaelArthur** (7): catchy but tries too hard so a bit annoying

**sabooyah** (7): The hook is addictive honestly.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Fabulous by Sharpay vibes

**billie\_\_** (6.5): ok a little energy for once, nice.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I was obsessed with this when it came out but in retrospect I think it's one of their more forgettable songs.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): this rap made me feel like a bad bitch

# Actual hip people

**BooksAndWhisky** (6): I don’t understand the hype about this song it’s just… fine

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): This group really loses it for me in the verses, which don’t work for me

**ebooks#5454** (6): its the deeper voiced rapper member with the lilac hair's interludes for me //swoon

**cremeebrulee** (5.8): this is kind of dry ngl

**SkylarV** (5.5): Don't care for the song much, but the instrumental is pretty catchy

**whoisValensi** (5.5): Yeah I still don't get the fucking hype about this song lol. Seriously it's like a big "Well okay that just happened" to me. Like... Good for you I guess if you like it, but I don't think I'll ever get what people really see in this song lol. I will give it one thing tho and that's that Hwasa's whole "The president's airport outfits spark rage" easter egg thingy in the music video, because idk how many people know this, but she was getting shit for her airport fashion and that for a while. And they just took that and turned it around into a bit of a in-your-face go fuck yourself moment which is great. Fun lil detail.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): is it though

**apatel27** (4): Makes me want to listen to Caravan Palace instead

**GREY** (4): hello :)

**terrencelovescum** (3): started off well until the chorus hit. my mind kept finishing hip hip with hooray.

**Zypker125** (2.1): Remember when Mamamoo was a group of 3 of the best Main Vocalists in K-Pop? I can't, because they get awful songs like this that have little in the way of vocals.

**BasedButta** (2): bad breakdowns and its just the same three chords over and over and over and over sorry this is bad

**Overall Average**: 7.096 **// Average Controversy:** 2.108 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/7iOzbcj.png)**

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.125): I can’t believe they have my highest average lmfaooo. I was pretty familiar with all of these except Dingga so I already knew I liked all of them, but they're definitely not my fave girl group so I'm surprised. Maybe I need to do a discog listen! Also Moonbyul's album from this year was actually pretty good.

**wavingwolves** (4.275): Once upon a time, when MAMAMOO were known to do jazz-based sassy concepts, I liked their music. After the way their music changed once the immense success of Starry Night, a song I literally can't stand, happened, though? Eh. It's just not for me. They kind of have some of my least favourite music by a girl group, really, and even if once upon a time I also liked the members a lot because I found them so charismatic and funny, there's a lot I can't really overlook. In any case, I think they did a lot better than most people would expect and they were a group that was able to maintain both a strong fanbase and general public attention for a long time and that's no easy feat. Props to them!

**1998tweety** (10.000): Resident MMM stan coming in to one again say that MMM has one of the best discogs in kpop, especially among ggs. Their bsides have ALWAYS slapped. Get into it x

**MToms** (10.000): Don't know them as much as Big 3 groups but I have been instantly attracted to them and their sound since my first listen a while back.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.700): they could’ve become a worldwide famous group if they weren’t you know… racist :/

**AxymHeart** (9.500): Some of the Best in the Biz

**-chilazon-** (9.375): ICONS I tell you. They're ICONS.

**nosnoop** (9.250): The real queens of K-pop, Korean treasure.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.175): vocal and charisma queens

**bespectacIed** (9.000): i have a huge soft spot for the mamamoo girls and i wish them well

**Alumineous** (9.000): Names can be misleading.

**thegirlin512** (9.000): So I've been meaning to get into Mamamoo, and I think I'll have to now. These songs aren't all quite my style, but I still want to hear more.

**throwaway-7650** (9.000): see: u/OliviaGodrigo's comment in the smackdown post

**moonagenightmares** (8.950): i can’t believe mmm has one of my highest averages

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.750): I can definitely see the comparison of Mamamoo and Little Mix in a sense that they are both vocalist groups serving bop by bop. Ngl, some of their earlier tracks are kinda hard to get into but I am glad the songs I liked from them ended up in this rate especially HIP. (MAMAMOO bias: Hwasa)

**Round\_Log401** (8.750): Queens, in my top fave groups.

**rikarikachan** (8.450): YES MAMAMOO my power vocalist feminist icons

**yatcho** (8.050): MMM has always been a bit mid for me since idrc about vocals but they still serve it as well as any seasoned group should

**runaway3212** (8.000): Honestly I love MAMAMOO's performances more than the music itself

**vayyiqra** (7.750): It's kind of funny because I had a phase a few months ago where I randomly tried to broaden my K-pop listening habits and tried force myself to like Mamamoo and told my friend how I got frustrated that I didn't like them much. Despite that I do like some of the songs in this rate and they are one of the more distinctive-sounding groups out there with their retro and Latin influences.

**bigbigbee** (7.750): They were much better and more unique between their debut and roughly 2016 or so, when they had that classy, fun, jazz-influenced concept going on…but the hosts were nice and picked their good songs from the past few years

**sublimeMusic** (7.500): gotta love consistency

**rslashpoopheads** (7.375): Honestly I would consider these 4 of Mamamoo's worst songs that's how good they are!

**cremeebrulee** (7.275): do these girls know each other? it just seems like these are 4 random hot girls doing their own thing in the same set

**anarkyah** (7.250): Had an absolutely insane 3 song run

**ke1per** (7.125): weak bridges, great rap

**brpr425** (7.000): I absolutely love them! None of the songs I'm rating from them this time around are favorites but they're so talented that all of their songs are at least pretty good

**dekubaku** (7.000): Love their energy. Their performances are much better than their MVs and HIP is simply iconic!

**pig-serpent** (6.750): A new favorite that I'll have to explore more of. It's cool that they have a lot of alternate versions of their songs, and the two I've heard have both been better than the originals.

**sabooyah** (6.750): I really miss Mamamoo's early jazzy pop sound, I feel like their releases now just blur together.

**fadedblue09** (6.625): Definition of a powerhouse group

**welcome2thejam** (6.000): Two outs, an infield single, and then HIP hits it out of the park

**pieisawesome123** (5.500): I have a strong preference for their older songs

**pornypete** (5.500): unfornute picks for me again. Where Are We Now is a solid 10 for me, but it's the only title of theirs I find myself playing regularly

**donutseer** (5.250): after Piano Man, have become poor man's Spica.

**BasedButta** (4.750): not a fan of their music at all but i will try to be nice

**SkylarV** (4.625): The only group on this that I've only listened to their titles, never appealed to me much

**TiltControls** (4.625): I blame Ru's new album title

**toyletpauper** (4.625): Nothing by MAMAMOO has amazed me. I’d say my favorite songs by them are Decalmonie and Piano Man, but since they don’t do that style anymore, they have gone down in favorability IMO.

**ebooks#5454** (4.375): s/o to these girls for legit having good sexy moves (non-objectification)

**whoisValensi** (4.250): Man, what happened to MMM. I mentioned this in my Gogobebe comment but I really do feel like I truly experienced their "Golden Years" with stuff like 'Melting', 'Memory', and 'Pink Funky'. I mean maybe I'm old and jaded (Probably am.) But like... wow idk what happened to MMM. I have said that like many times over but it's like almost astounding to me how hard they like... Fell off in my personal opinion. I mean I get growing as an artist but like, I think I'll just stick to the old MMM for now because wow they do not make stuff as good as they used to anymore in my humble onion lol.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): Who said that hags can't slay? Apink is a group that had a long journey, from very cutesy concepts like [Mr. Chu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5H-GvnNz2Y) and [NoNoNo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspqQuuuGIw) to suceeding at making the shift to elegant mature music (produced by star producing duo Black Eyed Pilseung, known as BEP) like [I'm so sick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4oHuML9U2A), [Eung Eung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=499YUeNoYVE) and this! A lot of people have a deep preference for this kind of sound coming from them, I'm not one of them but I can admit it does slap, so can many of you, since this is top 10.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): It's a good song but err...I was basically hoping it would eventually fall out of the top 10 and it just never did. An L for me.

---

# Hag fans!

**sarcasticsobs** (11): so close to pop perfection, baybeeee (that designation of “perfection” goes to “%% Eung Eung”). the part of the choreo with the intertwined arms still confuses me. love their voices so much, they each bring something special for me. i want to be best friends with bomi

**-chilazon-** (10): Apink hitting it out of the park. How do they make it look so effortless. I think this song has magic powder in it to make it so appealing

**-mczrv-** (10): congrats Apink for dropping three S tier songs in a row!! (was also obsessed with the slowed+reverb version for a brief period in time, maybe still am)

**2l82bstr8** (10): I had to walk back on calling another song "one of the classiest songs in the genre". this is THE classiest example of the genre

**agentofscranton** (10): Wonder Girls are dead. 2NE1 is dead. Sistar is dead. f(x) is dead. SNSD are (for the most part) dead. But, Apink is still standing. Apink is one of the lucky ones.

**AssailantArcturus** (10): i once claimed that this song is the best song in kpop after taking the crown from rv psycho and idk if i still stand by that but i heavily considered giving this my eleven

**becca** (10): ASLAY I FUCKING LVOE YOU OHMYKTFOC

**bespectacIed** (10): This needs to be a top 3 like Eung Eung was on the 2nd gen rate or at least crack top 10, istg. Truly the last great 2nd gen group song, wow. One of their best songs ever too. APINK IS BACK btw.

**bluetriangles04** (10): Throwback to my PANDA friend telling me Black Eyed Pilesung produced this song in Discord Voicechat and me hearing it as the Black Eyed Peas because of my ceiling fan making a god awful noise

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): Disco-lite for bad bitches only

**bookthieving** (10): only apink can serve soty 3 years in a row!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this was fighting for gay rights and people were killed

**GREY** (10): slaypink (NOT BP.) we love yew!

**ke1per** (10): the instrumental on the opening and post chorus is stellar, it'll be stuck in my head for life and I'm okay with it.

**nosnoop** (10): Would have my 11 if not for MAGO

**pornypete** (10): did I mention 2020 soty material

**rslashpoopheads** (10): APink served more with this trilogy than most people do in their entire lifetime combined.

**sabooyah** (10): I love the textures each of their vocalists add to the song. This song gets stuck in my head all the time.

**SatC1** (10): comeback please

**throwaway-7650** (10): apink + BEP = perfection. stream I'm so sick and %%

**vivianlight** (10): Their trinity of songs these last three years is unmatched

**yatcho** (10): Apink the hidden gem of Kpop and proof that no one does it better than the 2nd gen girls, they just have IT. Their current string of singles is unmatched and the other girlies better watch out for their next drop

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): immaculate synthwave vibes

**en#8502** (9.5): black eyed pilseung slaying again

**prada** (9.5): yass

**RaphaelArthur** (9.5): incredibly beautiful and divine vocals, very beautiful and catchy song, sadly too repetitive

**toyletpauper** (9.5): Modern, a bit weird, and a bit sexy. Mixing all the amazing things that from their two previous releases (I’m So Sick & Eung Eung) to make their best track yet.

**1998tweety** (9): they always serve and this is no exception

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9): not eung eung??? sick

**celladonn** (9): This is one of those songs that gets better every time you hear it

**Cooler\_lin** (9): of all the songs in the new APINK rebrand i like this and "I'm so sick" the most. love the whole song, the violins>

**imasalesman** (9): Idk why but I get pirate vibes from this song

**mimins** (9): amazing!!! show stopping!!!

**Nixon4Prez** (9): Apink pulled off the greatest concept shift in kpop history

**rubbie** (9): the main synth-line is so beautiful, it makes the song for me

**TiltControls** (9): I love the production on this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I’ve never bought into the whole “Apink are better post-rebranding” concept because cute concept songs are valid! they are! but this is good

**lady\_sable** (8.5): i love that apink are still going strong after all these years

**Tazzachar** (8.5): very groovy

**billie\_\_** (8): eung eung would've got a 9.

**chancehugs** (8): Bomi's vocals really popped off during the chorus. The hand choreo hitting r/all after trending on r/blackmagicfuckery will never cease to amuse me.

**savemeaseat143** (8): it's a good song but I think I'm getting tired of onomatopoeia

**thGnerd** (8): Apinks recent music has absolutely been killing it for me

**vayyiqra** (8): catchy synth line

**Victerade** (8): banger but aged bad

**waluigiest** (8): the instrumental is so satisfying

**anothertown** (7.5): this feels like it wants to be 2 different things but i like it for having that driving synth line

**bigbigbee** (7.5): they’ve served more in the past and this is definitely my least fave of the “new Apink” songs, but I still jam a bit and I LOVE!!!! Yoon Bomi.

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): I feel like this is going to be a grower. Too bad I left this rate to the last minute.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.2): this production is very fun

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): and nothing less

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she’s cute

**cuttackone** (7): pretty good

**PSSST12** (7): ngl I don't see the hype around this song??? Eung eung and Im so sick definitely outsolded.

**Round\_Log401** (7): The instrumental especially stays stuck in your head, good summer song, queens of the elegant aesthetic.

**runaway3212** (7): yass

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pretty cool dance pop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): This is nice but it kind of blends into the crowd here.

**Awkward\_King** (6): this is pretty and dreamy

**DaBigBoi** (6): BEP kinda remade this song with So Bad but made it better with STAYC.

# The only BEP we know is Black Eyed Peas

**SkylarV** (6): I just don't think the hook is that catchy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): it kinda sounds like music that play at the mall

**whoisValensi** (6): This should be hitting every mark for me but it's missing something and idk what lollllll. Video is pretty tho, can say that.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): not particularly good

**akanewasright** (5.5): I’d make a comment calling this song “dumb da dumb dum dum” but I’ve liked worse songs than this

**Zypker125** (5.4): A major disappointment and letdown after Eung Eung, which was easily one of the best K-Pop girl group songs of all time.

**lalafairy18** (5): I like how they sing dumhdurum

**thegirlin512** (5): I mean it's cute I guess?

**sage** (4.4): this isnt even bad but its so boring, %% washed

**apatel27** (4): Is there a rule in k-pop that there must be a some vocalisation of the beat no matter how boring it is

**terrencelovescum** (4): cute bridge but absolutely hate the synths in the chorus

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): I actually prefer Voice (the Korean version) for some reason, but nonetheless this is a really nice song. I’m not surprised this is the highest-placing LOONA song here as I feel like it’s kinda hard to dislike this? A few of you must disagree with me based on your scores asjdfjd but it’s just a very simple, sweet song.

**wavingwolves** (7.3): Contrary of how I felt about Why Not, this is a song I like less now than I did upon release. I think the thing that hit at first was the fact this was their first bright promoted release in a while and people really missed this side of LOONA. Same thing with the release of [HULA HOOP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnpUv1Vj5MA), which isn't a great song (in my opinion, obviously), but it's cute and that's something LOONA does it well and fans have missed it. I actually still think they pull off brighter concepts as a group MUCH better than darker edgier ones, which is why I pray everyday they find their way back to them at least for one more title. I also much prefer Voice (the Korean version) over this version, it sounds like it has less vocal processing and overall it just sounds better in Korean than in English.

# Nicholas Copernicus fanclub 

**AssailantArcturus** (11): im not sorry we got go won vivi and yeojin center time and lines its very important to me

**BasedButta** (11): FUCK YEAH awesome song that does its thing very well with lyrics that resonate with me

**chancehugs** (11): What can I say. Amazing production, amazing vocals, amazing line distribution, amazing choreography. Vivi and Gowon got justice here. This song makes me feel like eleven.

**dlong56655** (11): I like the Korean version better but this song is one of the best pop songs in recent years.

**sabooyah** (11): This is so good. One of the best kpop girl group English tracks. The only Loona full group song that has ever come close to the masterpiece solo tracks of Kim Lip's 'Eclipse' and Yves 'New'. One of the few tracks on this list that I could listen to on repeat.

**toyletpauper** (11): This is my 11. Just the perfect LOONA comeback, even though it wasn’t a comeback. And it’s not even my favorite LOONA title track. A song that gives hope.

**-chilazon-** (10): SUCH a great song, one of my faves for 2020! Honestly, contender for an 11.

**2l82bstr8** (10): the perfect pop song

**akanewasright** (10): I fucking died

**Alumineous** (10): You know, I really like Yola's Starlight. And this gives me exactly the same vibe just in a KPop way. There's something so beautiful to this starlight metaphor when being around someone you love so much.

**anagalisgv** (10): imo best English song in kpop

**anzunagi** (10): More like this pls BBC

**Awkward\_King** (10): oh my god this is.... maybe i will stan loona

**becca** (10): YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic song in orbitlandia. One of their best and most commercially successful eras ever, kinda lured back some fans they lost from So What and Why Not lmao. Thank u hosts for stopping at STAR and not including PTT btw. I don't have the thick skin for the vitriol it will draw lmaoooo

**bluetriangles04** (10): Star is really solid as an English single for LOONA, and I have found myself to enjoy it a lot more than their output afterwards.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented english

**en#8502** (10): i prefer Voice really but it's the same song so whatever

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): For some reason I feel like this is gonna get done dirty, but I guess that’s just LOONA’s vibe

**GREY** (10): at least they have 1 slay post jaden exodus

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): again the choreography, the vocals, the beautiful visuals. It should be a crime how underrated this song is

**notallslendermen** (10): Some of the best english lyrics in a kpop song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): finally LOONA went back to what they do best, bops

**Roxieloxie** (10): I've been trying to find this song again since groovy bot on discord shut down and I actually gasped when it started, that alone makes it a ten

**RReg29** (10): Their best song

**SatC1** (10): saving grace

**SkylarV** (10): Crazy good, synth-pop perfection

**terrencelovescum** (10): a hit! fully english songs from kpop are usually cringy but this was really well done! gifting this a 10 out of respect for their financial situation.

**thegirlin512** (10): BRB, off to listen to the rest of this album. If it doesn't live up to Why Not and Star, I will be very cross because I really like these songs.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Has a bit of that K-pop-y quirkiness but still sounds pretty badass!

**waluigiest** (10): the vocals and the drama are crisp here

**welcome2thejam** (10): Well-tread ground (at least compared to pop over here), but still a super clean & overall great version of it cause the chorus hook's always sung well and is just undeniable. You could toss this on the radio and it'd take a long time for me to get sick of it

**whoisValensi** (10): Welcome back to "Songs Nick has Cried to More Times Than He'd Like To Admit", you may be noticing a theme or smth.

**yatcho** (9.7): It gave me hope again to hear something just as good as the best of the pre/debut era. Slight points off because I like the korean version better

**lady\_sable** (9.5): jinsoul please answer my texts

**Tazzachar** (9.5): An actually good English release, I usually don’t care for english versions of tracks originally recorded in Korean

**TiltControls** (9.5): songs that mention starlight are for some reason almost always good (stream yola)

**rikarikachan** (9.3): Yo, what?? This is a banger. Is this why they all say stan LOONA?

**-mczrv-** (9): v nice

**BooksAndWhisky** (9): WHY WOULD YOU NOT MAKE THIS YOUR TITLE TRACK????? Docking a point because I think the Korean version sounds better

**brokebutter** (9): should have been the title track voice is still the superior version tho

**ChickyDipper** (9): this song was in my mind when I was asleep for weeks after they released it

**Cooler\_lin** (9): another contender for top song, reminds me of aly and aj's newer stuff

**cuttackone** (9): in loona we stan

**hikkaru** (9): US POP RADIO TOP 40 SMASH!

**intheaftermath** (9): it's knocked down a peg because it's overplayed in my college's dining hall

**ivyleaf33** (9): just a gorgeous song

**ke1per** (9): the War of the Worlds tripod explosion noise in the chorus build is my favorite part

**nctdreamsqd** (9): A fun lighthearted song that is perfect for summer.

**pornypete** (9): One of my favorites from 2020. Kinda feel like giving it a 10, but since I always put on Voice instead, I'm subtracting a point for the English version!

**rubbie** (9): Great stuff, very much a perfect pop song. Should've spent more time with this one.

ggsmackdown: **savemeaseat143** (9): I listened to voice religiously in November 2020

**seanderlust** (9): I think this is my favorite LOONA track here. what can I say - i'm a sucker for extended light metaphors.

**superr\_rad** (9): this is one of very few Kpop English songs that I think is superior to the Korean version. They even did a mv for it, and its one of my favorite LOONA mvs!! Im obsessed with the little docking choreo before the song starts!!

**jasannn** (8.8): Wow, K-pop has really improved on their english versions.

**Victerade** (8.7): AMAZING SONG i prefer the korean version but it still slays

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): a massive bop, the chorus could just go harder and it'd be perfect

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): of all the kpop english language songs i’ve heard this is probably the only one that sounds like its actually trying

**vaguelycatshaped** (8.5): This album as a whole is really solid tbh, also this song is really fun to sing

**bulforster** (8.4): definitely their most polished song in the rate

**MimisChoice9763** (8.4): it's so captivating although the chorus could have been a tiny little bit better

**throwaway-7650** (8.3): a cute gift to the fans. desperately hoping this isn't #day_3

**1998tweety** (8): Bop

**AxymHeart** (8): I really enjoy this song, seems underrated

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): neat English single

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This isn’t reinventing the wheel or anything but man is it catchy fun!

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8): it was kinda boring for loona standards but it was their last good bside

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): It’s rare to hear an English track that is better than its original Korean version. I am glad Star is LOONA’s first radio hit in the U.S.

**mimins** (8): if I ever go to a nighttime ball like cinderella, this is my first dance song

**RaphaelArthur** (8): very beautiful and catchy song

**vayyiqra** (8): Another very good 80s throwback

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): cute but I took damage sitting through the previous 3 songs so I cannot come to love this as much

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): I prefer Voice tbh, the English feels clunkier. I also think it's a bit too simple for my liking but still good.

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Generic? Yes. A bop? Absolutely!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This chorus is some long lost obscure 80s pop fantasy

**cremeebrulee** (7): this deserved to go to the blinding lights-core section of the rate

**CrimsonROSET** (7): stan loona

**ebooks#5454** (7): you could tell me this is blinding lights and i would believe you

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (7): Cute

**pig-serpent** (7): The pop part of this synthpop song is really well done... But the synth part not so much. The instrumentation is super bland and holding the song back.

**runaway3212** (7): yas

# The Catholic Church in the 17th century

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (6): i would listen casually mayb

**Zypker125** (6): I'm partially convinced people like this song so much because it's their copium for LOONA not having any other good singles that year (since most people did not like So What and Why Not, they have to turn to Star as their savior LOONA single of 2020)

**frogaranaman** (5): oh fukc there's twelve of them

**JohnnyToby** (5): heard this at a Ralph's recently

**sage** (4.9): this is like the most nothing song ever

**moonagenightmares** (4): kpop songs in english were a mistake

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): further evidence that english versions of kpop songs are vastly inferior vocally and lyrically

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Well this one isn't irritating at least.

**fadedblue09** (3): Interesting how a supposedly groundbreaking group is getting praise for singing a song that's virtually indistinguishable from the other synthpop songs of 2020

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): i think this was made for 3 year olds

**prada** (1): errrr…at least it gave me some sleep thank you poona caring queens

**PSSST12** (1): Who gave them the weeknd's scraps 😭😭

**wavingwolves** (8.9): Banger, but doesn't deserve the top spot as an ITZY song! I'll stand by that! Still, banger. The [shoulder move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRMBnc9pCSk) was instantly recognizable and a scene stealer. It had everyone and their mothers trying to master it. I still often do it in front of the mirror while I brush my teeth because I humbly think I look good doing it, what else can I say?

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): I wish I could see what other people see in this song but I just don’t. The “WANNA BE ME ME ME” chorus is so grating to me. At least they released Mafia In The Morning so this is no longer my least favourite title from them. Actually I think my dislike for this song has decreased ever since that came out and I realised this could have been a lot worse…

# Self loving people <3

**maskchachki** (11): not even a stan but this song is still so good.

**rubbie** (11): Perhaps my favourite kpop song of the past few years. That dance break followed by the final chorus is astonishing.

**-chilazon-** (10): This one almost got my 11! My absolute favorite Itzy song!

**2l82bstr8** (10): the best they've ever sounded. I love how spunky and bratty it is and captures perfectly that kind of teenage rebellion they always went for

**akanewasright** (10): This being the best song ever made ~~and yet 24hrs off the same mini is better~~

**anagalisgv** (10): iconic comeback

**becca** (10): SHOULDER MOVE RYUJIN.

**bespectacIed** (10): Doesn't hit hard when sung by already conventionally attractive women who are successful in life and career but wow this is a bawppp

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This chorus is next level. It’s so good I’m still giving it a 10 despite the verses being just whatever.

**bluetriangles04** (10): Still my favorite ITZY title to this day, so many iconic things to list. Ryujin cutting her own hair and that shoulder dance, Yuna saying "fuck those high heels!", Chaeryeong being hunted down by murderous drones, and the list goes on.

**bookthieving** (10): throwback to beginning of quarantine when everyone was breaking their shoulders doing this choreo

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): itzy used to be so good

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I listened to this playlist so many times thinking if something would top this for my 11 and it ~~just never happened~~. It’s just a bomb of happiness, confidence and just fun! Joy! Feel the rain on your skin, let the sunshine in, shake some ass! Edit: it did happen after thinking about it but the thoughts stand

**cuttackone** (10): and then they just blew everything out of the water

**DaBigBoi** (10): Hook after hook after hook!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): WANNABE remains my favorite ITZY track to date because of its upbeat instrumentation, great vocals, and its catchy empowering message. I feel like I am in the minority when I say this is possibly one of the best K-pop songs released in 2020, almost close to Psycho.

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (10): Iconic

**frogaranaman** (10): this is such a yasss

**GREY** (10): am i crazy or does this sound exactly like alcohol free omfgg

**hunnybee12** (10): you just had to be there!

**jasannn** (10): i cant be the only who tried to doing the Ryujin shoulder dance while drunk right?

**JohnnyToby** (10): This song broke my shoulders and kept me alive that first week of covid

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): not their best title but definitely their most iconic comeback. They were the moment. Also one of the best dance breaks of the 4th gen

**mengzhongmeng** (10): I totally get that itzy's sound isn't for everyone but I think that this noisy production, "I just wanna be me"-themes and colorful styling concepts suits them so well! it just works, a lot thanks to the girls' performances

**notarobot3675** (10): a classic

**PSSST12** (10): A HIT. an 11 contender and Itzy's absolute best song. Ryujin invented LGBT rights with that shoulder dance.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): watch this get the same placement as the spice girls in the vh1 rate

**sarcasticsobs** (10): this comes out the gate *HOT* and does *NOT* let up. obsessed since it came out. first half of chorus is near immaculate. and i love when yeji hits a higher note on the “나야” in the final chorus

**skargardin** (10): I JUST WANNA BE ME!!!!

**Stryxen** (10): oh i yelled

**superr\_rad** (10): BEST ITZY SONG I SAID WHAT I SAID!!! This was the first itzy mv and song that I watched and it’s a perfect introduction to the group. Ryujin’s iconic shoulder move, yeji’s note change in the final chorus, that part of the mv when Chaeryeong turns around and all the drones drop, I screamed!! I love this song so much, none of their releases since this one hold a candle to it tbh.

**thegirlin512** (10): To date, the only ITZY song I actually love. It's so catchy and fun. We don't speak of the English version though.

**vayyiqra** (10): Why does every Itzy song in this rate have a bassline that goes way harder than it has any right? Someone pay their producers more.

**whoisValensi** (10): Trans Feelies: The K-Pop Song.

**MimisChoice9763** (9.5): love everything except for the dance break bit

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): the nicki minaj edit of this on youtube is would be a 10

**yatcho** (9.2): I hate to say it but they really snapped here...

**sage** (9.1): the lgbts love this one a little too much

**1998tweety** (9): I bit basic but whew it bops. The chorus is AMAZING.

**bigbigbee** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OTAOE7ubE8 queen.

**celladonn** (9): When the guitars kick in in the second part of the chorus...!

**chancehugs** (9): ITZY's most melodic song and one of their best IMO. To give this anything less than a 9 would be to disrespect Ryujin's shoulders.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (9): this was so catchy right from the beginning love it

**DraculaWeekend** (9): That shoulder dance really hurts

**ivyleaf33** (9): one of my favorite dance breaks for sure

**JsaKim** (9): Live by their words of just wanna be me

**lalafairy18** (9): I've heard this song about ten thousand times by now and it still hits

**Roxieloxie** (9): this is wannabe

**thGnerd** (9): Best itzy song by FAR in my opinion

**xedophobic** (9): the ryujin shoulder dance has me on a chokehold unfortunately

**brokebutter** (8.9): their best title track

**-mczrv-** (8.8): makes me feel much better!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.7): the chorus is so infectious

**toyletpauper** (8.7): Amazing chorus. Amazing dance. Great album too. Best Itzy comeback so far.

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.6): I fear they peaked musically here and it’s been downhill since

**dlong56655** (8.5): I still don't know how to to do that shoulder dance

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): can’t relate but still good

**ke1per** (8.5): knocked from a perfect ten by the dance break

**terrencelovescum** (8.5): my shoulders are moving!

**Zypker125** (8.4): The whole second verse was by far one of the most cringe-inducing talk-rap sections in all of K-Pop, but the choruses save it.

**ebooks#5454** (8.3): yea i remember cutting my dyed hair in the bathroom mid panic attack, ahh good times

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): bitch me too!

**BasedButta** (8): their best ever with sick shoulder moves but please stop slowing down the song for no reason

**ChickyDipper** (8): this is truly Ryujin's song and no one can take it away from her

**en#8502** (8): Spice Girls wishes they can do the shoulder dance

**Nixon4Prez** (8): RYUJIN SHOULDERS

**pig-serpent** (8): Really cool bassline on this one. The only ITZY song I'm positive that I like a lot.

**RaphaelArthur** (8): great song, bad vocals

**sabooyah** (8): Their best title track. The only one that's okay to listen to with headphones, all their other songs are like 'active' songs where I have to be exercising or socializing to enjoy them, directly in my ears they are so grating. This one doesn't feel that way which is nice, good even.

**Victerade** (8): good

**welcome2thejam** (8): Turning around on it, could be a banger club anthem

# Spice Girls did it better! 

**mimins** (7.5): very good sound it suits them but also ailee's cover was waaayyy too good.

**prada** (7.5): cute but aged

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this is rlly specific but i love when songs do that thing where they briefly sound as if theyre playing in another room and then slowly change back into their normal sound

**Jhe116** (7.3): Jesy Nelson can learn one thing or two from Ryujin on how to pop those shoulders

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): this is fun but the rapping in the middle threw me, like it is not good 😬

**Round\_Log401** (7): This one is more chill for Itzy & thats probably why I like it lol.

**notallslendermen** (6.5): Liked this a lot when it came out but I rarely listen to it these days, it just got boring fast

**seanderlust** (6.5): this was a grower for me for sure

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): okay this one's alright

**bulforster** (6): this is competent but just so lacking in personality, especially for itzy

**intheaftermath** (6): this might be the fault of the small sample size, but compared to other groups, ITZY's first 3 entries seem a lot less distinct from each other compared to the samples of the other groups.

**runaway3212** (6): ya

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): There’s a really good rock song buried in here somewhere… I can hear the electric guitars…

**apatel27** (5): Really don't like the generic chorus or the rap part

**Cooler\_lin** (5): i really like the use of guitars all throughout :D

**savemeaseat143** (5): as someone with healthy self-esteem, I don't think I need this

**fadedblue09** (3): This is their best song??? Interesting….

**Awkward\_King** (2): if i were this song id wannabe something else too

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): more like wannaPEE i dont like this it's grating

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): https://twitter.com/katya_zamo/status/537312391542083584?lang=en

**SkylarV** (2): Hate the chord progression in the chorus

**moonagenightmares** (1): obnoxious

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Vomit.

**imasalesman** (0): I genuinely can’t understand why this song is so loved

# RYUJIN MOVE YOUR SHOULDERS!!!!


**becca** (10): SHOULDER MOVE RYUJIN.

**jasannn** (10): i cant be the only who tried to doing the Ryujin shoulder dance while drunk right?

**PSSST12** (10): A HIT. an 11 contender and Itzy's absolute best song. Ryujin invented LGBT rights with that shoulder dance.

**chancehugs** (9): ITZY's most melodic song and one of their best IMO. To give this anything less than a 9 would be to disrespect Ryujin's shoulders.

**xedophobic** (9): the ryujin shoulder dance has me on a chokehold unfortunately

**Nixon4Prez** (8): RYUJIN SHOULDERS

**Jhe116** (7.3): Jesy Nelson can learn one thing or two from Ryujin on how to pop those shoulders

ggsmackdown: # ITZY

---

**Overall Average**: 7.376 **// Average Controversy:** 2.131 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/h0McV00.png)**

---

**wavingwolves** (9.075): My third highest average in the rate for what it was up until 2021 my favourite 4th gen group. Even if I don't find their most recent output very exciting or appealing, I still love all of their music from the eras we covered, and I still love them as performers and think they're still the best when it comes to that from all the 4th gen groups. They have unmatched energy and charisma and it's always fun to watch them, even when I don't like the music much. If you liked their songs here, I recommend checking it out their full projects too, which are mostly enjoyable. My favourite b-sides include the pop rock influenced [WANT IT?](https://youtu.be/UMfJoFnR4Ew), [CHERRY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aaml8qpQHg), the SOPHIE penned classic [24HRS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vPHXn91vd8) and the more bright [SURF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jsdo5PtMrIs).

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.625): ITZY are kinda wasted potential to me. I used to be a really big fan when they first debuted - I loved Dalla Dalla (+ Want It) and Icy (+ the B-sides on that album). And then Wannabe came along, which was less good but at least I loved Ting Ting Ting so I stuck with them, and then ever since Not Shy I just haven’t been enjoying their title tracks or any of their B-sides :sob: Which is really a shame because I love the girls! Anyway, I’m not surprised that Wannabe ~~undeservedly~~ placed the highest out of these songs as it is their poppiest, less abrasive song in the rate.

**GapeCod** (10.250): I'm delusional.

**cremeebrulee** (9.800): this is the cunty part of the rate

**vayyiqra** (9.750): Itzy are a band I've seen hyped up a lot. I like them, I have listened to them, but not dug into as much as some other groups here. They're fun though.

**hikkaru** (9.750): this rate's time cutoff being right before they went to shit omg i cheered

**bespectacIed** (9.500): There's not one title track of itzy that I didn't absolutely hate on release day and came to stockholm syndrome me into obsession later. I am dead serious. They're 5 out of 5 now.

**vaguelycatshaped** (9.500): their title tracks never miss

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.350): Stan talent stan itzy. I will defend them to my grave

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.250): ITZY is like a good mix of f(x) and Blackpink with a dash of that JYPE charisma that is present in most of their groups. For a group following Twice’s footsteps, I really think ITZY did a really great job making themselves stand out with their title tracks that define the group and thier concept really well. (ITZY bias: Ryujin or Chaeryeong)

**bigbigbee** (9.250): I often complain about how (in my opinion) K-pop’s overall shift towards considering the global market made the music and concepts both more problematic and also worse. However, personally, I wouldn’t criticize ITZY in this way. To me, they really feel like a K-pop group that is modernized…but not to the extent where it feels like they’re sacrificing some of the “je ne sais quois” that I like about K-pop. It helps that I think they released four excellent songs in a row right at the beginning of their existence.

**whoisValensi** (8.500): I WANNA MAKE IT!!! ITZY NO LIMIT!!! I'll admit it took me a while to give ITZY another go since I heard their debut and was like "meh" and then listened to 'ICY' and was like "meh". But then I got a little *too* into '마.피.아. In the morning' and decided it was time to give them another go. Good thing I did because they've grown to be one of my favorite 4th gen groups. (Also big shout out to everyone who said 'It'z Me' is their best Mini cause ur right.) Also yes I seriously love the 'DALLA DALLA' remix from the fucking 'ICY' Mini more than the original track, just ads that extra umph.

**yatcho** (8.400): itzy is kpop junk food like its so empty and really bad for me and I try to resist but its so sweet and addicting and i hate it

**akanewasright** (8.375): ITZY - proof that artistic evolution in K Pop isn’t linear

**ebooks#5454** (8.075): s/o creme for playing these non-stop

**-chilazon-** (7.875): Not always my style music, but I really like them! Honestly I WANT to like their music more than I actually like it most of the time. Especially in 2021 they started to go downhill for me, but that doesn't matter for this rate.

**anzunagi** (7.500): I cannot wait to give my future 11 to In the Morning

**MToms** (7.375): their songs have lots of odd noises, similar to Red Velvet. I like them as a group though, I first saw them through Ryujin's viral shoulder dance. I wonder if JYPn will overshadow them...

**AxymHeart** (7.250): I like the group members more than their discography

**dekubaku** (7.250): Best debut by a gg IMO. Dalla Dalla was that song! IMO, their subsequent releases paled in front of their strong debut. Liked their 2021 releases though, especially MITM.

**bookthieving** (7.000): the way i stockholmed myself into stanning itzy just because they performed on the same night of kcon as a bunch of my faves and i wanted to get my money's worth

**Round\_Log401** (6.750): Oh Itzy, love the girls. Like their concept of being different & that being cool & them sticking with this young fresh image. However their music is the epitome of sounds being mashed together for me. I respect what they are doing, however it's not for me.

**ke1per** (6.625): too many dance breaks

**throwaway-7650** (6.625): itzy is one of the most polarizing ggs and my scores reflect that

**bulforster** (6.550): I do like how their obnoxiousness is much goofier and seems more self aware than the other obnoxious groups in the rate who are often exhaustingly self serious.

**sabooyah** (6.500): If you can understand Korean Itzy's lyrics are kind of insufferable lol.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.250): Honestly I find ITZY kind of annoying but their songs are annoying bangers.

**-mczrv-** (6.150): if the below feels a little harsh pls know Nobody Like You is a 9.2 at minimum

**welcome2thejam** (6.000): Pop rap can be a bit of an uphill battle for me, and nothing this group does really pushes em over that hump

**pornypete** (5.750): They don't really make music for me for the most part. But it all seems very well produced. The 2 major exceptions have been Mirror and SURF both of which I LOVE.

**runaway3212** (5.500): Sadly I do #not get the hype

**anothertown** (5.125): not shy the mini was maybe my least favorite release of 2020 and put me off of itzy unfairly.. really hit or miss though

**pig-serpent** (4.750): Probably the group I have a read on the least. Couldn't decide how I felt about any of their songs and I'm sure during the reveal I'll go back and question all the scores I gave them. I love them or I hate them, but I don't know which.

**apatel27** (4.000): For all the quirks the songs don't really have much to come back to

**fadedblue09** (3.500): Apparently they're a love it or hate it group, and based on what I've heard, I'm in the latter camp sadly. Kudos to them for nailing their concept and finding success but unfortunately their music just comes off as aggressively unpleasant. I guess I'm not JYP trash as I thought I was

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3.000): well at least they're interesting

ggsmackdown: # LOONA

**Overall Average**: 7.299 **// Average Controversy:** 2.197 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/6Op7CGA.png)**

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.500): A surprisingly strong average from me here. I’ve never considered myself an Orbit, but I think all 4 of these songs are pretty good! I love a lot of their solos and earlier group work, and funnily enough the switch to girl crush didn’t really bother me (So What is like my favourite song from them lmao). What did bother me was when their B-sides started becoming pretty meh, and then PTT came along…but that’s a discussion for another rate.

**wavingwolves** (5.475): I'm a classic case of an ex-orbit that followed LOONA during their pre-debut years and then got disappointed with their post-debut output, with the exception of [+ +] which I still enjoyed a lot. Most of their work after that was disappointment after disappointment, especially So What. Still, the work from them I do like I *really* like, and in this rate it's Why Not, probably because I enjoyed [12:00] a fair bit. Even if we are back at square one with the release of [&], I can admit they had a few highlights during the period we covered.

**bespectacIed** (10.000): My ults who fell off, but always my ults nonetheless. I seriously started my weaning off of kpop when loona's releases became subpar but I will always be an orbit lol it's on my genetic makeup at this point

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.875): stan Loona or die. It’s 2022 and if you don’t wanna save these girls from disbandment you’re immediately homophobic

**glitter408** (9.750): I love loona so much

**AssailantArcturus** (9.625): they're my ults my besties im biased what can i say

**thegirlin512** (9.375): Never listened to any Loona song other than PTT, and I'm glad that wasn't in this rate! Their other songs were so much better.

**vayyiqra** (9.250): The virulence of "stan Loona" put me off this group for a while but now I think they're pretty good. Not a band I listen to often, but they truly don't have any bad songs.

**lalafairy18** (9.250): I'm an orbit so beware

**whoisValensi** (9.125): I'm so sorry LOONA for any shit I ever talked about you lol. I will say... I'm not too too sure about this new direction they're going in. I feel like I almost stockholmed myself into liking 'Why Not?' at sometimes if that makes sense. While 'PTT' is......... it's a song. (But also that's not here so get ready for that opinion in the future I'm sure lol) I feel almost like I missed the "golden" age of LOONA cause I was too busy thinking Cute Concepts were flooding the industry too hard and now look I miss that shit and I'm getting a lil tired of Girl Crush lol.

**cremeebrulee** (9.100): ricki how do i become a fulltime orbit

**JsaKim** (8.750): I ended up stanning loona oh no

**note\_2\_self** (8.475): They are my ult group but god the title tracks past Butterfly leave a lot to be desired

**ebooks#5454** (8.400): i understand why everyone says STAN LOONA now...i've been converted...

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.250): Oh man, the evolution of Loona since their dominance in the first K-pop rate has been quite sad tbh. I still eat up their newer releases but it’s no doubt that their pre-debut tracks are much better in comparison. Still, I hope Popheads still gives Loona a chance as they continue to evolve as a group. (LOONA bias: Chuu)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.250): they're alright

**brokebutter** (8.000): one of the best discographies in kpop

**SkylarV** (7.975): My current ult group, their recent titles though...

**hikkaru** (7.875): poona

**donutseer** (7.500): their pre-debut music is top k-pop.

**BasedButta** (7.375): annoying predebut master race fan checking in

**runaway3212** (7.375): One day I will become so obsessed with Loona lore, but for now I just love their music

**sublimeMusic** (7.250): stan loona

**-chilazon-** (7.125): Prefer their softer songs, wanna check out more from them

**ke1per** (7.000): why ask 'why not' when you could just ask 'what happened?'

**BooksAndWhisky** (6.925): Y’all were better as soloists

**anothertown** (6.875): when i see blockberry creative it's over for both of us

**toyletpauper** (6.800): My current favorite group, however I am one of those fans that does prefer their older stuff and generally despises most of their newer stuff. And I genuinely love the girls and what LOONA once stood for, so I really do hope with every comeback they find success.

**welcome2thejam** (6.750): Found out they have fictional group story lore? Which tbh makes me way more interested than I would be otherwise

**Round\_Log401** (6.750): I love the idea of LOONA but their group songs have just never hit for me.

**throwaway-7650** (6.750): FUCK NCT [127]! AND SM ENTERTAINMENT! **FUCK MEN**!

**bulforster** (6.575): they really haven't had a great title since their debut huh

**yatcho** (6.550): Probably my favorite group of all time, but the drop in quality in this time period was so jarring. Star/Voice is a gem but these everything else has truly ushered in their flop era

**slimboyfriend** (6.500): So this is the LOONA of stan LOONA fame

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.250): this is the group y’all tell people to stan in the reply sections of people mourning their loved ones?

**pig-serpent** (5.500): They write some okay tunes but they seem extremely basic. I don't get any sense of what makes LOONA LOONA and not just any other assorted group of kpop girls.

**apatel27** (5.250): Another case of wasted talent. Comparing these to odd eye circle & Loona 1/3 is day and night

**fadedblue09** (4.750): One day I'll understand why popheads and RYM nerds love this group so much but so far I'm warming up to them

**rslashpoopheads** (3.500): Maybe if they released a good song as a group they wouldn't be broke and in debt!

**mssone1993** (3.000): I put low scores for most LOONA's songs as the songs are quite generic for me. There are no stand out parts/hooks that made me like the songs except for maybe Butterfly where the chorus was quite catchy but not enough for me to score it higher.

**dekubaku** (2.250): Can't say this about many or even any other group but pre-launch songs are way better than post-launch songs. Why is Heart A11ack not here? Low average for Loona cuz I guess the songs pale when compared to their previous outputs. And will get lynched for this but PTT is the best Loona title track.

**wavingwolves** (10): One of the top tiers 4th generation groups we have, STAYC have come far here and are considered one of the most consistent and widely liked groups currently active. They had a lot of hype even before their debut for being a group produced by the duo [Black Eyed Piseung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Eyed_Pilseung), who are known for having a lot of big hits and very well critically received tunes under their belt (fun fact: SO BAD is only one of three songs produced by the duo in the rate and all of them managed to get top 10, since the others are Fancy and Dumhdurum). I think SO BAD is an amazing song and also features such a rush of a chorus, I can't fault anyone for falling head over heels for it and making it place here.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): As someone who largely finds STAYC kinda overrated, I can admit that this is a great song (and also their best!). But I wonder if recency bias is at play here, because I definitely would not say it’s worthy of being top 10…

# 4th gen stans 

**en#8502** (11): except this song is SO GOOD woah i cheered. WE LOVE YOU BLACK EYED PILSEUNG!

**-chilazon-** (10): This is just SO GOOD. Also when I first listened to this, I was pleasantly surprised that the lyrics did not include another "I'm so bad" moment

**-mczrv-** (10): SO GOOD

**1998tweety** (10): one of the BEST pop songs I've heard. STAYC GIRLS. 11 contender.

**2l82bstr8** (10): I can't give this an 11 and it's killing me. I'll just pretend it's because of Yoon's horrible blue wig

**agentofscranton** (10): black eyed pilseung are gods actually

**akanewasright** (10): They make me happy, what can I say?

**alwayswords** (10): everyone say thank you bep

**anothertown** (10): Stayc girls........................

**AssailantArcturus** (10): i am in love with yoon idk her real name

**BasedButta** (10): JAM this one needs earbuds and i need a second eleven to give away

**bluetriangles04** (10): SO BAD MORE LIKE SO GOOD

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): i wanted to give it my 11 but i associate it with the worst time in my life so

**ChickyDipper** (10): one of my favourite songs in recent years because it's so ridiculously catchy

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): stayc girls... it's going to late day 2/early day 3!

**Gonza\_90** (10): So good

**GREY** (10): those slayc girls have yet to miss.. just a bunch of queens truthfully

**KoolFunk** (10): I'm in love with these 4th gen girl groups

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the title is definitely not describing this mega smash!!!

**reiichitanaka** (10): Those ROTY awards were totally deserved

**savemeaseat143** (10): STAYC is one of the best rookie groups out there right now

**seanderlust** (10): STAYC girls, its going down!!! I like the arpeggiated string faintly in the bg

**skargardin** (10): STAYC GIRLS!! IT'S GOING DOWN!!

**superr\_rad** (10): I went through like a 4 month obsession with this song where I listened to it at least once a day, it was my #3 song played this year on my unwrapped (I switched to AM in May too so that’s not even the full year of tracking lmao). StayC is an amazing nugu and I cant wait to see what they have in store for us!!!

**Tazzachar** (10): So much potential with this group, they are my favorite rookie group, and I have a feeling they will score very well next rate

**terrencelovescum** (10): STAYC GIRLS ITS GOING DOWN! amazing from the start with the tagline to the verses to the prechorus to the chorus all the way to the end.

**throwaway-7650** (10): ASAP grew on me a ton but this is still their best title tbh

**Victerade** (10): THEIR BEST TITLE TILL THIS DAY. dnb banger i hope young love outsells it

**whoisValensi** (10): There's a *lot* I could say about STAYC (including how this almost got my 11 lol), but I think I'll keep it brief and say they have me the most excited I've been for a new group in a long ass time. An electrifying debut, solid stuff following it up, yeah I love them. In conclusion tho, ***STAYC GIRLS, IT'S GOING DOWN!***

**Zypker125** (10): Almost was my 11 (was between Deja Vu, So Bad, and Tag Me), Pop perfection, Black Eyed Pilseung know what they're doing when they're making these tracks and this is in contention for BEP's best song. Really looking forward to seeing where HighUp Entertainment goes next, I think they're clearly the most promising company in K-Pop and will rise in the next few years.

**BooksAndWhisky** (9.7): The arpeggiating synths had me gagged from the first second

**toyletpauper** (9.7): The synth pads in the chorus are everything! Great melodies, too. One of the best debuts in k-pop I’ve heard.

**sage** (9.6): this would be a 10 but it feels like its missing something

**ggal2020** (9.5): cue “slayc girls it’s going down!” comments

**thGnerd** (9.5): Best STAYC song in my opinion and a fantastic debut

**yatcho** (9.5): i dont think there's a throwback synth concept i wont eat up at this point, like I wasnt really on board with what I heard from STAYC before and here comes this song and its really going down now

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): it’s going down, indeed. very excited to see where this group heads. very much love sieun and j’s voices

**anagalisgv** (9): is anyone else reminded of Miley Cyrus' Fly on the Wall from Sumin's first couples lines

**bespectacIed** (9): The song that launched one of the most iconic tags in kpop ever oh wow. For here onwards, we are all stayc girls and everything is going down!!! P.S. Stereotype >>>>

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): False advertising with that title…

**brpr425** (9): More like SO GOOD amirite

**chancehugs** (9): This song took a long time for me to click with for some reason, but once it did I couldn't get enough of it.

**jasannn** (9): amazing even if it doesnt have the lasting power of ASAP and STEREOTYPE

**lady\_sable** (9): easily the best debut of 2020

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9): you have to listen to it a couple of time to like it completely

**nt96** (9): What can I say? I'm a hoe for DnB.

**pig-serpent** (9): I'm a simple woman. I hear breakbeats, I give good score.

**poemforsmallthings** (9): “Isn’t going down a bad thing? We want to go up in our career,” said STAYC's Sumin

**PSSST12** (9): contrary to its name this is so good. However ASAP and stereotype is where its

**RaphaelArthur** (9): some parts still sound weird but overall it's great on every aspect, amazing song that is like a mix of eung eung and la di da

**Round\_Log401** (9): So good. This is what I personally like, youthful & fits their age but doesn't babyfy them.

**runaway3212** (9): YAssss

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): so bad more like so good!!!

**ke1per** (8.5): so good though

**rikarikachan** (8.5): I kept raising this score the longer the song went on. It builds really well through to the end

**brokebutter** (8.3): amazing their best title track still

**AxymHeart** (8): Took a few listens, but I love it now

**billie\_\_** (8): still their best by far.

**bookthieving** (8): "isn't going down a bad thing? we want to go up in our career."

**cuttackone** (8): stayc did a eleven with stereotype if it was included it would be that song so bad was a great debut but they outdid it twice

=====

ggsmackdown: 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I am more of an ASAP fan myself, but SO BAD isn’t so bad as STAYC’s debut song. They have huge potential as a group. Also, it’s hard to resist their iconic “STAY C GIRLS, IT’S GOING DOWN” catchphrase.

**ebooks#5454** (8): staycgirls itsgoingdown staycgirls itsgoingdown staycgirls itsgoingdown staycgirls itsgoingdown staycgirls itsgoingdown staycgirls itsgoingdown staycgirls itsgoingdown

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is good but it would be better if it weren’t so… ‘80s?

**ivyleaf33** (8): the most a k-pop girl group has been claimed by the gays since loona

**lalafairy18** (8): I WANT YOU SO BAD

**mimins** (8): wow I love mid tempo songs actually

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): This was good, but I doubt I am ever going to think about it ever again.

**notarobot3675** (7.5): not my favourite from them but a really solid debut

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): nah it's decent

**Cooler\_lin** (7): love the retro vibe again, feels different from the other songs and reminds of a slower, less hype version of La Di Da. Very catchy

**CrimsonROSET** (7): maybe its good

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (7): ASAP supremacy but this was still good

**mengzhongmeng** (7): the stayc girls have it! strong debut but everything they've done after has been amazing

**sabooyah** (7): I'm shocked that this song isn't more popular than ASAP honestly.

**thegirlin512** (7): Cute, but it dragged a bit towards the end.

**TiltControls** (7): I hope people don't tank this just so they can make an obvious joke

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s cool

# 2nd and 3rd gen hags!  

**DaBigBoi** (6.5): I prefer their other titles (seems unpopular), but this is good! Something about the song just lacks impact for me. I do like that all the members have very distinct voices.

**hikkaru** (6.5): so overrated

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): no, just kinda meh

**LesApfels** (6.5): Is it just me or do they sound pissed off while singing

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Not putting ASAP or Stereotype feels like sabotage...

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): it has a really good underlying beat but the melody just feels like it was written by an ai

**anzunagi** (6): but ASAP and Stereotype are perfect

**becca** (6): this is literally the only stayc song i don’t like.

**bulforster** (6): the dnb production is interesting but the song is still kinda just there

**Esh\_Kebab** (6): Not since Felix from Stray Kids have I been as shocked by a deep voice in K-pop as I was with J from this group.

**vaguelycatshaped** (6): Not my cup of tea but I understand why it's beloved

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): idk what to think about this so i'll rate it in the middle. the chorus is catchy tho.

**Awkward\_King** (5): i wanna play neopets

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (5): higher than the emoji movie at least

**dlong56655** (5): So Mid

**fadedblue09** (4): The Weeknd influences are too uncanny for me to ignore

**SkylarV** (4): I love this song until this chorus starts and then I hate this song, truly a testament to how much a key/chord progression matters in a song's composition

**prada** (3.5): i’m not seeing what people see in stayc i fear…

**dekubaku** (2): I know Reddit loves StayC but I truly do not get their hype.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): WHAT. AN. ERA!!! From song to MV to album to styling, I was in love with it all. I initially came into this rate thinking this would obviously be my 11 and although I ended up giving it to OMG’s SSFWL instead, I still absolutely love this song. I’m really happy it did so well as I know that some people don’t care for it, so I’m pleased it was able to get all the way to #6. (As an aside, this is definitely my favourite album from TWICE so check that out if you’ve never heard it <3)

**wavingwolves** (10): THEIR BEST SONG IN THE RATE! Deserved to be their highest song in! I remember this getting some middling responses upon release and people wrote it off as a redone of FANCY, and a less good version of that. I truly don't see it and I think this is a better song in every way. One of my favourite TWICE songs and the song I have most scrobbles for in the whole rate, Feel Special has a perfect title for a song like this. I find it to be so elegant and sparkly while still managing to be such a warm song. Several people have stated to have cried to this and I can understand it. In a sea of songs about loving yourself, I find this to be one of the most special ones. It speaks of how powerful the feeling of being love can be for your worth as a being, and I don't think that ever fails to be true.

---

# #FeelingSpecial #FeelingBlessed

**2dina3dworld** (11): this song is the musical equivalent of being right next to someone but not being able to say a word. And it gets me right in the feels every time because that’s where I’m at in one of my relationships. What can I say? What do I want to say? What do they want to hear? At this point, I don’t know.

**agentofscranton** (11): the greatest pop song of all time actually

**anarkyah** (11): More than Fancy, I think this is THE track that solidified their growth and transition as artists, going more mature while keeping their fresh and bright staple

**DaBigBoi** (11): Ahh this song holds so many memories with me. I had just become a full-fledged fan of theirs, and Mina was on her hiatus (a tough time for onces). I was transitioning into the next stage of my life around new people and surroundings. Then, they dropped this, and I knew at that moment it would become my favorite title track of theirs. I love the scenes in which they look at each other lovingly, and Jeongyeon looks at herself. The instrumental for this is so bouncy, sleek, and layered at the same time. It truly is special.

**slimboyfriend** (11): this song is so powerful that if it were played on top 40 radio, Americans would realize how good k-pop is and stop calling y'all koreaboos

**you2009** (11): smoking the shit that made twice feel special

**1998tweety** (10): A perfect song, I remember this came out around the time that Mina was taking a break due to her mental health, so this song having "farewell" vibes made that all more impactful. 11 contender !!

**anothertown** (10): there is an entire galaxy within this song, it is a loving assault on the ear

**bespectacIed** (10): Smash hit, iconic, kinda melancholic, but still very TWICE

**bluetriangles04** (10): This song is embedded in TWICE's legacy. The emotional importance this comeback had for the fandom upon its release, and even today still will echo for the rest of TWICE's career.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): i almost gave this an 11 but fromis won out but this was show stopping literally their best title track it slayed so much and i want to stab myself in the heart every time i hear it because nothing else can express my feelings towards it

**chancehugs** (10): This song did wonders for my self love.

**ChickyDipper** (10): great song and a really moving video too

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): After the cultural reset that is Fancy, most people didn’t expect that Fancy would actually meet its match so soon when Feel Special was released. While Fancy serves as a precursor to the group’s evolution, Feel Special is where it showcases the group’s maturity the best. Everything we love about Twice remains here with Feel Special as this song feels like a tribute to their Onces as well to themselves as a group. Musical-wise, 2019 is an iconic year for Twice thanks to the releases of Fancy and Feel Special.

**en#8502** (10): i love the lyrics

**fadedblue09** (10): If Fancy is TT 2.0, then this is Likey 2.0. The former are the straightforward cute songs you expect from TWICE, while the latter really show what TWICE are capable of: the ability to use their brand of bubblegum pop while conveying an underlying deeper and surprisingly emotionally complex message.

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (10): My fave and the fits were so good

**glitter408** (10): imo one of the best twice title tracks

**hikkaru** (10): i think i like this more than fancy

**hunnybee12** (10): this song has been there for me emotionally more than my parents ever have

**intheaftermath** (10): ok ok this sounds so bad but when I was in HS and feeling down, I'd play Cookie Run and turn on a playlist of super vibrant kpop songs to make myself feel better - this was one of the first few on the playlist... I've Pavloved myself into loving TWICE

**ivyleaf33** (10): guaranteed to reduce me to tears when i listen to it at like 3 am during exam season

**jasannn** (10): WE LOVE YOU MINA :uwu:

**JsaKim** (10): My favourite song about self love

**KoolFunk** (10): Yes

**lalafairy18** (10): One of the best pop songs of our generation

**mengzhongmeng** (10): this song makes me FEEL SPECIAL and also sad and lonely and just very emotional, sana looks phenomenal

**mimins** (10): pop perfection again!!! timeless!!!! show stopping!!!!!!!

**notallslendermen** (10): It's so hard to choose between this and Fancy as their best song. 2019 was such a great year for Onces

**PSSST12** (10): This didn't immediately hit me like most of twice's Title tracks but it grew on me tremendously plus that choreo is so good.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when someone submits a ballot to a rate i’m hosting (do 2021 ult btw)

**Round\_Log401** (10): Feel Special > Fancy any day. I don't know how a song is able to sound expensive but they did it.

**runaway3212** (10): YASSS

**sage** (10): their uk garage slay omfg

**SatC1** (10): twice peaked at Fancy/feel special. nothing they have released before or after has even come close

**savemeaseat143** (10): this is one of my favourite TWICE songs.

**Stryxen** (10): woman red dress dance emoji

**superr\_rad** (10): I adore the elegant concept for this song and the meaning of the song makes it that much more uhhh special. JYP has a lot of writing misses but he nailed it with this. I wasn’t around when it was released but learning about Mina’s struggles with anxiety that she took a hiatus for around this time made the song even more beautiful and meaningful than I already felt it was on the first listen!!!

**vaguelycatshaped** (10): My queen and the best Twice tt no I don't take constructive criticism

**whoisValensi** (10): I have cried to this songs more times than I'd like to admit and you just have to live with that knowledge. \*2 minutes later:* GODDAMNIT I'M CRYING AGAIN lol. It's like every time I watch the video and read the lyrics in the subtitles I sob so badly lol... Help me.

**xedophobic** (10): this song has a special place in my heart for being the last kpop song that was released before i went on a nonstop trauma journey

=====

ggsmackdown: **yatcho** (10): Might be a little corny lyrically but idc idc, this is perfection

**notarobot3675** (9.9): one of my all time favourites from them

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): that plucky synth bass is a work of genius

**bulforster** (9.6): this flows so well, would be a ten if the rap was just a bit stronger

**-mczrv-** (9.5): I feel special every time!

**becca** (9.5): YEW MAKE ME FEEL SPECIAL

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): This is just pure serotonin.

**brokebutter** (9.5): one of their best titles

**throwaway-7650** (9.4): both this and fancy are overrated, I said what I said

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): has grown off me slightly but still great

**anagalisgv** (9): the drum fills in this ... chef's kiss

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this feels like the slightly uglier twin of Fancy (but like still really pretty just like their features aren’t like your stereotypical perfect symmetrical faced person)

**lady\_sable** (9): probably my fave choreo from them

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9): literally iconic. But listening to fancy and this back to back kind of feels like the same song

**rslashpoopheads** (9): A good song that's elevated by one of the most beautiful music videos in kpop and a great choreo. Also Jihyo is so hot.

**sabooyah** (9): I like this song better than Fancy but I can objectively agree that Fancy is a better banger.

**terrencelovescum** (9): jyp finished off 2019 with a one two punch combo a la serena williams. jesus will return to earth the day kpop realizes that a song can be good without someone "rapping" on it.

**thGnerd** (9): The best twice song by far

**WebGlittering2894** (9): had an actual positive impact in my life

**welcome2thejam** (9): A fun chorus goes a long way

**BasedButta** (8.5): great but kpop songwriters need to stop making rap breakdowns that slow the bpm down to a halt

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): it's just a massive bop innit

**2l82bstr8** (8): kind of already dated when it came out, but I love the groove

**BooksAndWhisky** (8): Instrumental SLAPS girlies just need to take the pitch down a notch

**Cooler\_lin** (8): almost as good as fancy but it reminds me of fall and fancy reminds more of summer, i love summer.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): there was so much glitter that my laptop lagged

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i don’t <3

**cuttackone** (8): its fancy again but emotional

**JohnnyToby** (8): their best line distribution, Dahyun kinda slayed here

**moooo566** (8): granted i never paid much attention to them, but this is the only twice song ive heard that i wanted to listen to a second time

**pig-serpent** (8): This song is kinda a lot but it's not bad.

**rubbie** (8): Good song, more mature and I like the production too. However, this doesn't rank among Twice's best imo

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): https://twitter.com/peachstatepapi/status/1324683762341392384?s=19

**Victerade** (8): same as fancy

**bigbigbee** (7.5): It’s a little plain but in a way that grew on me the more I listened for this rate

**ke1per** (7.5): the second verse kills the momentum a little for me

**RaphaelArthur** (7.5): great song but bad vocals

**rikarikachan** (7.5): I'm sorry, this was the Twice song that started their terrible terrible trend of shitty English rap bridges. This would be a 10 if not for the bridge. Everything else about it is amazing.

**toyletpauper** (7.5): A bit lower energy than I'm used to from Twice, but a nice song to listen to every once in a while.

**billie\_\_** (7): again, mina brings it all together.

**DefaultPophead** (7): This is fun, but nothing special...

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I’ve kinda warmed up to this since it came out but I still kinda have the same problems with it, it feels slight compared to their best work. The start of the chorus is euphoric but the rest of the song is just kinda there to prop it up, it rests on its laurels too much. Also the rap verse feels jarring, which is a shame because they usually have great rap verses.

**GREY** (7): went the mature route in literally the yassiest way possible omfg SANA PEN UNMATCHED SIT DOWNNNNNNN BLACKPINK RED VELVET!

**TiltControls** (7): this song isn't really all that special, but it is good



# #FeelingAverage #FeelingBad

**vayyiqra** (7): One song where I don't quite get the hype. It's like, fine? I like the verses more than the chorus.

**MimisChoice9763** (6.9): I enjoy this song quite a bit but it doesn't really click with me

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): why was the Just Dance routine for this song so bad

**SkylarV** (6.5): It doesn't feel special, just average

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): the instrumental reminds me of this video https://youtube.com/shorts/t4vFFLC4jZw?feature=share

**-chilazon-** (6): Ok, so I wanna love this song because the lyrics are so meaningful, which is why I even rated it this high, but the instrumental is just way too busy and grating, it hurts my ears.

**frogaranaman** (6): there is no straight explanation for this song

**pornypete** (6): This was a bit of a letdown after the crazy run of title tracks they were on for me.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.7): it's fine but i don't really like the chorus

**moonagenightmares** (5): i keep forgetting how this sounds the second it ends

**akanewasright** (3.5): This song is fine but  I can never remember what it sounds like, ~~and now that it’s in my ears, the melody sounds like fancy but worse~~

**apatel27** (3): 'Rap' part absolutely ruins the song. Talking over a beat isn't rap, get that into your damn heads kpop producers

**Zypker125** (2.7): Incredibly overrated, the verses and melody are a nothingburger.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): GIRL WHO INVITED ALVIN FOR THAT FINAL CHORUS HE SHOULDVE BROUGHT SIMON AND THEODORE TOO

**thegirlin512** (2): Same criticisms as Fancy. 2nd Twice song I ever heard, just to give them a fair chance after Fancy. I just didn't get the hype? Still don't. It's not my style. It gets a 2 because I don't dislike it as much and I think the lyrics are cute.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): Honestly, [this is all I can think about when it comes to this song.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75afad88f2ad09ba50a452805c933ab0/4833ee57adadee1f-27/s540x810/4351bd904017edf5e113570eb7884f62c8d91207.gif). Here TWICE takes upon themselves to obliterate singer Dua Lipa and they do it flawlessly. In all seriousness, of all the Blinding Lights-lite songs, this might be my favourite. I think what most works for me is the energy and charisma the bring with this it, and, well, the fact the song bops too is hard to miss. They didn't change the game or turn any tables around, but they cemented their place and dipped their toes in the nu-disco style which has worked well for them. Eyes Wide Open, the full album this song is on, is also a marvelous work and probably my favourite full of theirs because the highs are SO high. Songs like the sophisticated [Up No More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgylz1pLFE0), city pop darling [Say Something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qgylz1pLFE0) and the smooth [Believer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UD-NryVdDts) still remain some of my favourite b-sides of theirs.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): Although I definitely prefer Feel Special and Fancy to this, I still think this song is great. But it’s not even top 5 on Eyes Wide Open to me, so my own bias meant I was very surprised that this even reached top 5 of the rate :sob: But it’s TWICE doing retro, what’s not to like? Also I had to say that the yellow outfits in the MV are super cute.

# SOMEBODY STOP THEM!!!!!! CAUSE THEY CAN'T STOP THEMSELVES!!!!!

**lost-ln-the-echo** (11): I feel like this might be a bit of a basic choice as it's one of the more well known songs on here but it's just such a bop, the chorus is ridiculously catchy

**thegirlin512** (11): RISKY RISKY WIGGY WIGGY FOR THE WIN! One of my favourite songs of all time, this song was the first Twice song I heard and loved. I was so surprised when I realised it was a Twice song, and it's what actually convinced me to give the group another chance. It was my 4th most played song in 2021 and top 10 in 2020. Obviously, it has to have my eleven.

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I put the playlist on shuffle and this was the first song that played… and let me say it was all downhill from there. The chorus is so catchy and infectious, and of course the instrumentation is at the right level to complement the song and doesn’t go too overboard (which I’ve come to realize is the main reason why I didn’t vibe with most of the rest of the songs in this rate lol)

**-chilazon-** (10): Risky risky, wiggy wiggy, this is an emergency! You know, this song grew on me since I first listened to it. I was gonna give it a 9, but listening to it now, this song is such a 10!

**agentofscranton** (10): nayeon's vocal chords fighting for their life

**anzunagi** (10): almost my 11!!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): kinda sounds similar to physical but that's not a bad thing

**babadork** (10): This song’s production really takes advantage of the group having so many members.

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the best products of kpop's Weekndification era (narrowly beaten by MAGO). This is stellar. Cry For Me cleared this though

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me when I drive past Taco Bell on my way home from work.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the weakened waddled so twice could gallop

**DaBigBoi** (10): What a terrifying time lol. Fancy won a lot of fans, but this song came out when people were back to being comfortable coming at TWICE. I didn’t get the hate since I loved it at first listen! Dula Peep’s Physical has this amazing thumping retro beat that can’t be beat…until TWICE came along.

**en#8502** (10): i was so satisfied with this release because it came out after [REDACTED] and i was so worried that their title track quality will go downhill

**frogaranaman** (10): bad bitches like this song

**glitter408** (10): this album is so good

**GREY** (10): future nostalgia being one of the most overrated albums ever so NAYEON MIND decided she would latch onto the hype and give us an actual hit like omfg! Shes truly an inspiration

**hikkaru** (10): did NOT wash physical, but it's still amazing

**ignitethephoenix** (10): blinding lights core

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://gfycat.com/detailedcelebratedguanaco

**JohnnyToby** (10): Thank you Dua for Physical

**ke1per** (10): retro perfection knocked from first place by the rap

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): I LOVE the girlboss vibes of the song. Really nice contrast with the previous two

**mengzhongmeng** (10): song and choreo are top tier but the mv is a bit too messy, too many aesthetics all at once

**notarobot3675** (10): they did what they had to do with this era

**PSSST12** (10): A CULTURAL RESET. an 11 contender. That chorus was relentless, and the choreo? *chefs kiss*

**reiichitanaka** (10): I'm just very biased towards 80s synths I guess

**RReg29** (10): They nailed this retro sound with a monster chorus

**terrencelovescum** (10): it's hard to follow up after fancy and feel special but they really tried. the way blinding lights is just so good any knock offs automatically sound good as well...

**thedoctordances1940** (10): absolute smash

**TiltControls** (10): Wait this is just Physical (but better tbh)

**yatcho** (10): They DEVOURED this concept! Some might has its just a Fancy rehash but to me it goes a step beyond in ferocity throughout the whole song. The MV goes a step beyond too, the choreo is so fucking fierce and Momo's bob alone is enough to make it their best

**rikarikachan** (9.7): It was a risky risky wiggy wiggy pop emergency when twice hopped on the synthpop train. It doesn't bop quite as hard as some of their cuter songs but the production is just chef's kiss

**sage** (9.7): one of the best songs to come out of the retro trend.. washed FLOP DI DA

**throwaway-7650** (9.7): great (and I hate to say it, but physical > ICSM)

**BasedButta** (9.5): now this is a good rap breakdown also the last chorus so good i think i may love songs that feature screaming around

**seanderlust** (9.2): I kind of wish they leaned a little harder into the 80s power pop tropes this song feels like it subtly references

**1998tweety** (9): She's cute, a step up from Bore & Bore

**2dina3dworld** (9): Twice talking about their next few songs “I can’t stop me (from releasing bops)”

**KoolFunk** (9): lovin the retro sound

**lady\_sable** (9): obsessed with the way jihyo says "lose myself"

**Round\_Log401** (9): I don't know one Twice song that isn't catchy as hell. They executed the 80's sound perfectly. I think most of kpop went the very literal & fun approach (eg. Dynamite-BTS, Mago-GFRIEND, So Bad-STAYC) which isn't bad. Twice captured a darker more mysterious Blinding Lights side.

**runaway3212** (9): yassss

**SkylarV** (9): Proved to me Twice could still be good post-Fancy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): ok i've only heard a few songs from TWICE and i never got into them bc i found their songs to be  too bubblegum for me, but after this rate i need to do a dive bc this slaps

**Victerade** (9): BANGER TITLE BANGER ALBUM i love it

**waluigiest** (9): anyone else hear blinding lights

**whoisValensi** (9): I mean 'HELL IN HEAVEN' & 'UP NO MORE' are better but they're not the title tracks so...

**-mczrv-** (8.5): TWICE simply can’t be stopped

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): classy, groovy and elegant. a different kind of excellence for them, but it suits them just fine. gets unbearably shrill too many times for it to get a 10 though
[/r/popheads/comments/sx8inh/kpop_girl_group_smackdown_reveal_day_3_got_no/hxr5g2o/]

=====

ggsmackdown: **anagalisgv** (8.5): I enjoy this song a lot but the ad libs at the end are a bit much

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Inspired by a specific 80s synthpop sound established in The Weeknd’s Blinding LIghts, I Can’t Stop Me showcases Twice’s continuing evolution as a group as they explore mature feelings of temptation in this song that still feels Twice, just different. It’s impressive how this group can change up concepts and still be good at them as they were with their cute concepts.

**mimins** (8.5): a certified bop. its one of my favorites out of their entire discography

**toyletpauper** (8.5): A solid interpretation of the new 80’s vibe popular during 2020. Fast paced, melodic and catchy, with little to no sections that falter it.

**akanewasright** (8.3): not my favorite blinding lights/physical rip off in the rate but it’s real good

**becca** (8): yas?!

**billie\_\_** (8): extremely good chorus, feel like killing a man rn.

**DefaultPophead** (8): It's trend-hopping, but at least it's good, right?

**nt96** (8): Lets see if the raters will

**pornypete** (8): and a great return to form with ICSM!

**savemeaseat143** (8): I understand why it's liked but I find it overhyped

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): god im a sucker for 80’s influenced songs

**vayyiqra** (8): Very good 80s throwback

# Wish they could stop TWICE, probably. And maybe Dua Lipa

**Bryoneehhh\_** (7.5): i know a lot of ppl loved this but it was a kinda boring take on retro. still slayed though

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): love the retro vibe but just not on the same level as the other two

**Jhe116** (7.5): I just don’t get the appeal

**metanoira** (7.5): i like this but them making nayeon wail and her unnecessary high notes at the end kinda ruin it. EWO is their magnum opus but this does fall in the bottom half of the album imo.

**nctdreamsqd** (7.5): I like the song but some of the member vocals were not my preferred color for this song.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I was gonna give this a lower score, but the chorus stayed in my head for days until I decided to raise the it

**bigbigbee** (7): I didn’t like Physical that much

**CrimsonROSET** (7): who are you the police

**RaphaelArthur** (7): great song but bad vocals and bad mixing

**rslashpoopheads** (7): One of their better recent songs, though I don't really love it as much as most people seem to.

**rubbie** (7): All "Physical" similarities aside, this is a fun bop, but I'm way over the 80s retro trend at the moment, and already was at the time of the song's release.

**sabooyah** (7): I love this song but it's surprisingly forgettable.

**Stryxen** (7): ok this one does blinding lights well

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Can we just like… take a break from this particular ‘80s sound palate unless we’re gonna knock it out of the park? I’m tired

**MimisChoice9763** (6.2): I like the melody and it flows quite nicely but the vocals sound a bit unpleasant at times especially in the chorus

**bulforster** (6): the girls are trying but this chorus thinks it's way more bombastic than it is

**pig-serpent** (6): The chorus is catchy but the whole song is just similar enough to Dua Lipa's Psychical that it makes me wonder why I'm not listening to Dua Lipa's Physical instead.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I liked this song back then but in consistent with my disdain for the overdone retro synth pop that plagued 2020 kpop...well

**brokebutter** (5): hearing nayeon struggling so hard to hit her notes on the last chorus pains me

**thGnerd** (5): Song was also boring to me

**flavasavavandal** (4.5): Can I listen to the version of this song that successfully goes off and not this milquetoast version

**apatel27** (4): Where's the oomph? Extremely derivative 80s throwback song

**SatC1** (4): I am not a fan of the vocals in this song

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): something about the vocal production of this song is awful throughout the song

**Awkward\_King** (1): oh it appears i accidentally opened last years ultimate playlist instead

**corguri** (1): black eyed pilseung wanted a quick buck


# RISKY RISK- [GUNSHOTS]

**bluetriangles04** (10): Risky risky, wiggy wigi this is a pop emergency!

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): Risky risky wiggy wiggy this is an emergency yeah that’s right besties! Definitely their best title track since 2017

**chancehugs** (10): Risky risky wiggy wiggy, this song is a pop emergency.

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): RISKY RISKY WIGI WIGI THIS IS AN EMERGENCY

**ivyleaf33** (8.5): eternally pondering the meaning behind risky risky wiggy wiggy

**sarcasticsobs** (8): RISKY RISKY WIGGY 위기 THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. personally can’t stand nayeon’s high notes, they bring down an otherwise *fantastic* song. the pre-chorus rules.

**imasalesman** (6.5): Risky Risky Wiggy Wiggy

**bookthieving** (6): 🚨 RISKY RISKY WIGGY WIGGY THIS IS AN EMERGENCY 🚨

**lalafairy18** (6): Risky risky wiki wiki

**LesApfels** (5): Oooh, I'm blinded by the risky risky wiggy wiggy

**Zypker125** (8.3): RIP English grammar "I can't stop MYSELF"

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): This actually isn’t a perfect 10 to me, but I still really adore it! This song (and album) were what reintroduced me to TWICE after some time away from them, so of course I’m thankful for that. I also can’t not say what an amazing concept change this was, it really felt like a natural musical progression. Onto its placement - I’m sure we’re all shocked it didn’t even place top 3, especially as so many people thought this was definitely the winner :sob: Especially as I think the groups specifically in the top 3 are pretty surprising.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): Did someone say... the most obvious winner we could've had? Well, look at where it ended up! Missing top 3 entirely! Don't you love when surprising things happen in rates? Anyway, I don't even know what to say about FANCY that hasn't already been said. It was a game changer for TWICE, a stepping stone on their career as they started to really pull off more elegant and mature concepts, coming right after YES or YES. It was massively well received internationally, even though it wasn't received half as well in Korea compared to their previous work and how bombastic it was for non-Korean fans. Still, it marked a really high time for them as performers and artists, with the Fancy You mini being a project just as great as this song. It is a little overrated? Yeah. But overrated things are still good... well, at least, sometimes...

---

# Good luck booking that Fancy win you speak of 

**alwayswords** (11): manifesting fancy win while its instrumental is trending on tiktok FANCY TIMELESS CLASSIC

**hunnybee12** (11): if this doesnt win, r/popheads unleash a curse just like the one released onto the world after the 2019 MAMA awards where it lost SOTY. just saying.

**akanewasright** (10): yeah whatever I don’t mind this winning at all

**bespectacIed** (10): This song will break the "only SM wins popheads kpop rates" curse, I fear. As it should. There's really nothing else to say about Fancy except that it's THE perfect pop song. This song and its parent album are special to me cuz imo this was TWICE's ascension into being the number 1 kpop act, quality-wise. From this point onwards they will refuse to release anything that isn't a quality bop. Except More and More lol jk

**celladonn** (10): This will probably win and I'm fine with that

**hikkaru** (10): one of the most obvious winners we've ever had?

**poemforsmallthings** (10): If there's someone who can stop Psycho from winning it's you Fancy

**yatcho** (9.5): Massive  bop, cultural reset, etc etc. I DO like the next two singles better but i will not be surprised or mad if this wins it's just so powerful

**TiltControls** (8.5): Seems to be a frontrunner and definitely wouldn't mind it winning

**bulforster** (8.4): what a boring winner

**throwaway-7650** (8.4): I'm going to be mad af when this wins... literally view 2.0

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is going to win probably and i will be very whelmed

# The one person that got it right 

**CrimsonROSET** (7): good luck on all stars!

# Onces, who lost YET AGAIN! </3

**anothertown** (11): They did some kind of dark magick to make this

**bluetriangles04** (11): Fancy is, still for me, TWICE's magnum opus title track wise. The way they came back after Yes or Yes/TBTIED with this song which was a mixture of something brand new for them while still packing a traditional sugary sweet TWICE chorus with layers of their personality buried underneath, was perfect for their direction and couldn't have went better among the international fanbase at the time. (I still remember the iconic, Twitter viral Jihyo fancam from this era.) This instrumental has to be one of my all time favorites in K-Pop, and for good reason. On top of that, the mini album is one of their best and I definitely recommend a listen through if you haven't.

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): truly one of the greatest pop songs of all time

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): Ah yes, Fancy was the cultural rest that K-pop needed and I personally wished I was a Once during this era because it’s that excellent! This song retains the same bubblegum sound that Twice excels at while showcasing their mature evolution as a group. At this point, if you are not into Twice after this song, I have to seriously judge you. To give this a song less than a 9 would be a crime.

**ggal2020** (11): the song that got me into kpop and forever the best track by the best group!

**Gonza\_90** (11): This song got me interested in K-Pop, one of the most amazing pop songs ever

**ignitethephoenix** (11): honestly one of my favorite kpop songs, I remember I was trying to work and then I looped this song like a bunch of time for energy and it worked!

**jasannn** (11): I feel sorry for my ex-roommate who had to hear and see me sing and dance to this song for over a year

**KoolFunk** (11): Perfect, funny that they would release their worst and best singles back to back.

**metanoira** (11): THE kpop moment of 2019 argue with a wall

**sublimeMusic** (11): thirty seven days until I see this live

**Tazzachar** (11): This song never gets old, it’s a true pop masterpiece

**terrencelovescum** (11): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it. quintessential. the epitome and embodiment of kpop. we need to add this to the voyager golden record. nasa, make a voyager 3 and send it off with solely fancy on it. i fail to see why any aliens wouldn't be impressed by it.

**vivianlight** (11): I've been singing along this song two years straight non stop

**-chilazon-** (10): Perfection! Twice at their absolute best. I love the message/tone of the song as well. Also, Momo is GORGEOUS!

**1998tweety** (10): literal pop perfection, I've been a TWICE fan since most of their post-debut career and I always thought their music was a bit more "kid-ey" compared to some of their contemporaries like RV, but this song felt like the perfect evolution. It served cμnt but the kind of cμnt you would expect from TWICE. A definite contender for my 11.

**2l82bstr8** (10): their big shakeup moment. the energetic push and pull in this is just masterful. (also the best they ever looked, just in general)

**agentofscranton** (10): my first TWICE comeback as a ONCE and cemented them as my favourite pop act

**Awkward\_King** (10): cliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this might be one of the greatest kpop songs of all time

**babadork** (10): I like the more mature concept, and it isn’t too dramatic of a change from what they were doing before.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): i loved this so much. it was the shit back in the day. it’s lost just enough charm to take it out of the running for an 11 though

**ChickyDipper** (10): this song not doing that well in South Korea is a **CRIME**

**Cooler\_lin** (10): FINALLY i was suffering there for a bit, REAL MUSIC! FUNERALS, WEDDINGS, BIRTHDAYS. A big contender for top spot

**cremeebrulee** (10): love ya!

**cuttackone** (10): their blossoming moment

**DaBigBoi** (10): I used to be so confused as to why people thought this was where they started to transition and mature specifically, but I’ve learned that wearing black does a lot.

**ebooks#5454** (10): mhm chef's kiss what else is there to say!!!

**en#8502** (10): ahead of its time...

**glitter408** (10): fancy is iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended iggy fadzalea and charli SUX but Reba does remain unbothered

**MimisChoice9763** (10): My favourite title track of theirs and one of the greatest in Kpop I believe

**notarobot3675** (10): twices magnus bopus

**note\_2\_self** (10): Fancy is that bitch tbh

**nt96** (10): Thanks ryxn

**pornypete** (10): One of the best songs of 2019 easy!

**PSSST12** (10): If only psycho wasn't in this rate this would be my 11 no contest. One of twice's absolute magnum opus. Its basically a musical version of euphoria ( the feeling )

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i have waited years to do this (note: he changed his 11 later)

**rslashpoopheads** (10): The one. The only. The legendary. The Fancy. Back in 2018 I thought Twice was already on the slow inevitable decline of their career trajectory and then they came out of nowhere to release one of, if not the best song of their career.

**rubbie** (10): Such a good song, so damn catchy, it doesn't get much better than this.

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSS!

**sabooyah** (10): Truly a banger for all ages.

**SatC1** (10): twice peaked at Fancy/feel special. nothing they have released before or after has even come close

**skargardin** (10): I feel like life hasn't been the same since I first heard this

**superr\_rad** (10): absolutely perfect pop song. Every second is a hook. The chorus takes you on a fucking journey. Jihyo’s note after the bridge!!!! Dahyun’s rap!!! Just a perfect song.

**sage** (9.7): overrated but less overrated than .. certain frontrunners

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I thought I didn’t like this anymore but I was wrong! Just a fantastic song

**ke1per** (9.5): I never want it to end

**Kwcty6888** (9.5): the song that really got me to pay attention to them

**rikarikachan** (9.5): Fancy, ooh

**xedophobic** (9.5): showstopping incredible etc

**toyletpauper** (9.3): This song has so many elements that almost make it perfect. The chorus is absolutely killer and so so so catchy with its simple lyrics and choreo. And the verses are fast paced and addictive, which is also nice. But where I do think it falters a little bit is its intro and outro, and a flaw that can be found within many girl group songs, especially Twice songs which are high-pitched vocals. The point of high-pitched vocals isn’t always that bad as I am accustomed to them now as a k-pop and Twice fan, but I definitely know when I first listened to Fancy, I was a bit thrown off by the vocals.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): pink-haired chaeyoung had me in a vice grip. great song, too. shoutout mina

**SkylarV** (9.2): The definitive Twice track, still their best song

**anagalisgv** (9): fancy ooh!

**AxymHeart** (9): Start of my fave Twice eras

**chancehugs** (9): This song makes me feel fancy (sorry).

**ivyleaf33** (9): i remember people being so scared this was gonna suck, so thanks jyp for pulling through with the consistent bops

**slimboyfriend** (9): It's telling that this was one of the only songs in this rate that I knew beforehand and I liked it enough to listen to over 60 unfamiliar k-pop songs of.... varying quality for this rate

**whoisValensi** (9): Thinking about Doja Cat reacting to this. IDC if there's a chance it's fake it's iconic. Also yeah wow this video is iconic. Especially Chae's Houndstooth outfit and I say that as a Momo guy.

**-mczrv-** (8.6): the outfits!! The m/v!! the chorus!! Iconic

**billie\_\_** (8.5): i really like mina's voice in this track. she always adds some melancholy, even to their brightest tracks, it's nice. dahyun and chaeyoung's rapping/sing-talking style really works here too.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.5): Yurina carried this song on gp999 I’ll never forget her. I barely listen to this song but I really like the chorus

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This got slightly overhyped to me I fear. A bop tho for sure.

**savemeaseat143** (8): it grew on me after a few listens but I think Feel Special was the better comeback that year

**thGnerd** (8): An all time twice classic

**vayyiqra** (8): Has someone made a mashup of this and "Lovesick Girls" because they are almost the same tempo

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The bubblegum synths had me scared it was gonna be another corny song but it’s actually really pretty and sweet!

**Victerade** (8): also aged bad for me LOL but a great song and a great mini

**welcome2thejam** (8): There's an "oh" sound in the background that sounds way too much like that one sound from Nelly & Kelly Rowland's Dilemma. But anyway, this is good

# The contrary of fancy like

**BasedButta** (7.5): i dont really get the hype as twice has much better songs like the next two and likey

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Fun and much, much better than what I've heard from these guys at first. Probably could rate higher, but this score feels right!

**pig-serpent** (7.5): It's certainly upbeat but it's failing to stand out in any real way.

**seanderlust** (7.5): this is so sugary sweet! it's fun and bright and a great listen

**becca** (7): never really got the hype this song got but I still know the entire choreography?

**frogaranaman** (7): idk any of their names but the girl in the paperclip scene is serving cunt

**RaphaelArthur** (7): great song but bad vocals

**waluigiest** (7): like applebees on a date night

**BooksAndWhisky** (6.8): The pitch and instrumental annoy me because of how squeaky and relentless they are idk why everyone’s always gagging for Fancy #SignalWasBetter

**Zypker125** (6.5): Super overrated, they wear fancy outfits on stage yet the song itself is very poppy and upbeat, it's so dissonant.

**moonagenightmares** (6): the opening always tricks me into thinking this song is going to be really good but that chorus is awful

**Stryxen** (6): package holiday advert music (neutral)

**nctdreamsqd** (5.5): I like the verses but the chorus was not my favorite.

**apatel27** (5): Wish there was actual power in their voices to carry the song, the pay off to the final bridge was pathetically weak

**GREY** (5): There was not a day in spring 2019 where you wouldnt see this song all over you tl, the grip fancy had on gg stans and bg stans was truly a moment in history

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i like the production but thats it

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This song ruined TWICE! I’m not gonna pretend like it’s the worst song in the world but it’s so overhyped and nondescript, it’s got one decent hook but that’s kinda it

**2dina3dworld** (3.5): this just sounds very half done. The vocals don’t feel properly corrected, the instrumental feels too one note in places, and the pre chorus mixing sounds unfinished. The drums are also REALLY REALLY annoying.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2.5): i really wanted to like this since everyone else seems to…but it just really didn’t hit for me. also can’t stand the ‘fancy’ at the end of the chorus, sorry about it. anyways, stream The Feels instead

**useless-sheep** (2): i rly used to hate this… it’s ok now but the chorus still sounds too chipmunked to me. definitely doesn't deserve to be called one of the best kpop songs ever as so many like to say!

**duckson89** (0): : I'm usually fine with TWICE's higher pitched vocals (such as TT and Likey), but in FANCY it's especially egregious, making it unlistenable to me.

**thegirlin512** (0): This was the first twice song I ever heard, after after hearing how much people hyped this group I was so confused. It's just not that good of a song? Is this really the best that Twice has to offer? That and the green screen music video were so off putting that I didn't give Twice a chance for another year. Chaeyoung's and Jeongyeon's were the only parts I liked of this song.

ggsmackdown: # TWICE

---

**Overall Average**: 7.685 **// Average Controversy:** 1.971 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/qc0c2GH.png)**

---

**wavingwolves** (8.740): A group I've followed pretty much since debut. They were the juniors of my favourite boy group at the time and several of their members already had recognizable faces to me because of how much they featured [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sAoKmg7qPI) [their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eISomx-VMow) [MVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_DX64EwH9M) quite often. Their debut Like OOH-AHH was an immediate hit for me, stupidly catch and with a stupidly addictive choreo to follow. The girls were extremely charismatic and fun to watch, and they quickly amassed quite the fanbase, especially with their first comeback CHEER UP, which was the biggest song of 2016. For some time they kept their bright and cute sound and look, but the thing about cute concepts is that they have an expiration date of sorts and at some point the group needs to mature. TWICE did it wonderfully, in a way that still maintained a lot of the energy and personality that made them big, but with new elements being brought to the table. I personally will forever prefer the titles from their cute period, my personal top three being TT, What Is Love? and Signal, but I can't lie and say I adore their b-sides a lot more now, with [Up No More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq8kFdQbrNU), [Love Foolish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeFXRIJXYZo) and [Hot](https://youtu.be/JOswKXwfJ_s).

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.700): My favourite girl group! Although they’ve had good albums since the beginning of their career (in my opinion), their output since 2019 especially has been knocking it out of the park - their albums are usually extremely consistent. I love the girls too and I’m glad they had such a strong showing here,  they really deserve it.

---

**anarkyah** (10.040): You’re never gonna find a group with songs as catchy and addictive as theirs, absolute earworm experts

**bluetriangles04** (9.960): TWICE has been my ult group for a staggering 5 years. Through their evolution, there have been many breakthroughs (pun fully intended) and TWICE have become a cornerstone of 3rd Gen K-Pop and K-Pop as a whole. Say what you want about them, but you can't deny that every comeback they bring something new to the table and put their own spin on it, and I can't help but love them as a group for constantly evolving with their own music. If you haven't, do listen to their bsides and support budding lyricist queen (pun fully intended again) Kim Dahyun!

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.500): really hoping they don’t disband this year

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): as much as I want fancy to lose, I would love for twice to win!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.200): Ah yes, this is the group that turned me into a full K-pop stan. The way Twice evolved so much since their debut showed how iconic they are and the songs chosen for this rate are truly some of their best in this discography. My OT9 girls better win so they can finally end SM’s reign of terror in the K-pop rates. (TWICE Bias: Dahyun)

**anothertown** (9.200): BB Cream Papapa, Lipstick-eul Mamama

**glitter408** (9.200): I love twice

**hikkaru** (9.100): and when they sweep

**ChickyDipper** (8.800): I want it known that Cry For Me is my rightful 11 and would have destroyed every song in this rate 😡

**brpr425** (8.800): Lots of great songs recently! As someone who is both a weeaboo and a Koreaboo, I love them so much

**-chilazon-** (8.800): Always bops from Twice! For real, I love how you can always depend on Twice for a lovely, catchy pop song.

**Round\_Log401** (8.800): I could literally write a whole thesis about how perfect their transition was. The slow build up was so well done, it didn't feel like we were dropped into cold water, instead we slowly matured with them.

**toyletpauper** (8.760): Although, I’ve known k-pop for a while (late 2000s/early 2010s) through family/media. I only really got into it 2016 thanks to TWICE, and as such is the first group I can say I stanned. So they hold a place very near and dear to me.

**slimboyfriend** (8.700): I feel like such a normie because I went into this race blind having not listened to almost no k-pop in the last 9 years and I came out of it loving the most successful k-pop group in this rate. But their songs are so good!!

**ebooks#5454** (8.500): this group makes me love women

**sarcasticsobs** (8.420): the progression of TWICE’s career has been gladly welcomed by me at least

**yatcho** (8.400): I didn't take TWICE too seriously last GG rate because they were in their cutesy era but WOW did they level up since then. One of the few groups who I make sure to check every release for now

**TiltControls** (8.400): A selection so good that I actually went to check out their other stuff (Summer Nights is a fantastic album btw)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.400): fun

**brokebutter** (8.180): its been downhill since feel special

**pig-serpent** (8.100): Hadn't listened to any TWICE before this and I'm really liking what I'm hearing. Will have to check out more of them.

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.100): Come back to save the day cute Twice I’m begging you

**SkylarV** (7.880): I don't stan but they have some great songs, both titles and b-sides

**bespectacIed** (7.800): 3 years ago on the first kpop rate, I was a TWICE hater. Fast forward to now, they're the most consistent kpop act and my number 1 group. Now that's POWER.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.800): This is a good selection of Twice songs.

**whoisValensi** (7.600): I feel like from my scores and maybe my average alone, you can tell there was a real turning point for me with TWICE w/ 'Fancy'. I went from only really liking like every other title they put out to just consistently liking their titles. Looking forward to their output this year as it may be their last bit of output as 9... (Gotta love contract renewal years...) But at the same time I do wonder if I should go back and revisit their old stuff...

**Tazzachar** (7.600): Yes I ult TWICE, Momo best dancer of this generation.

**runaway3212** (7.600): Twice is literally such a good group ugh, they have everything, quality and quantity. Their songs arent as consistent as they were at the start of their career but god they still hit it out of the park so often

**vayyiqra** (7.400): One of my besties says Twice are the most overrated K-pop girl group and I can kind of see why he thinks that. They're good, I like them, don't get me wrong, but I don't quite feel the hype for some of their material. Maybe I need to listen more? Idk but they do have a lot of good songs.

**ke1per** (7.300): I appreciate the variety in Twice but I much prefer the maturity of the final 3 songs to the twinkling gooiness of the first 2.

**welcome2thejam** (6.600): Outside of the Dance the Night Away misstep, these are all great tunes

**Alumineous** (6.400): They lack the special sauce.

**mimins** (6.300): the definition of hit or miss for me

**fadedblue09** (6.300): it's so impressive to see how far they've grown but at their core they still have what makes them feel special (heh).

**akanewasright** (6.260): Twice is a really good group, but because I’m friends with kpop stans, I know that they have quite a few deep cuts that outsell these. Still, they are a very good and very consistent group and I like them a lot

**thegirlin512** (6.200): I listen to an unhealthy amount of Twice, but I have a love hate relationship with their songs. When they hit they hit, but their misses are definitely misses. Also, Cry for Me was a single released in 2020? And it wasn't here? How could you, rate organizers? How could you.

**donutseer** (5.800): Feel Special album is their best and a rec for any pop music fan.

**apatel27** (4.800): Bit too straight laced and generic for a lack of a better term. All their songs feel extremely safe and as if someone took SNSD and scrubbed down the edges even further

**dekubaku** (4.800): Surprised that my average for TWICE turned out to be rather... average. I liked TWICE's earlier song. Reddit will disagree with me but Cheer Up is one of the best kpop songs. What is Love is also right there. I guess I didn't vibe with their latest title tracks.

**OliviaGodrigo** (4.800): i hope their US endeavors tank so they can stop taking scraps from white artists. like you gotta be desperate if you’re taking scraps from zara larsson and anne-marie i’m sorry

**duckson89** (4.200): TWICE titles are a true hit or miss for me. Unfortunately during this period there were more misses.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Is this better than Blinding Lights? YES!!! 

**wavingwolves** (4.5): IN NO WAY BETTER THAN BLINDING LIGHTS!!!!! !!!! Unappealing, if I'm honest. At the time of release this gained such strong praise and I couldn't get it, especially because it was coming during a phase where a lot of similar retro concepts were happening and this paled in comparison with every single one of them. I don't hate it, but I never found it exciting. It's also disjointed, which Everglow songs tend to be, but it doesn't really go well with the Blinding Lights-lite music style they were trying to pull here, unfortunately.

---

# I'M ONDA

**cremeebrulee** (11): stop comparing this to blinding lights!!! it’s better!!!!!

**frogaranaman** (11): they bodied

**ImADudeDuh** (11): its the motherfucking SMASHA WHEWWWWWWWWWWWW

**ivyleaf33** (11): instantly obsessed with this on first listen. not only is the song absolutely flawless and incredibly catchy, but the mv and concept fit it like a glove. choreography is iconic and glorious. this is just everything tbh.

**reiichitanaka** (11): My favorite song of 2020. In a perfect world this would have gotten the Korean GP attention and they could have added my girl Yena to the group without terrible popularity imbalance. But Korea slept on them so she's going solo, and I'm torn.

**Round\_Log401** (11): THIS! One of 2020s best songs. Choreo, mv, catchiness, styling all superb. The dance break where they're voguing, never seen something like this in kpop.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): I can’t even hear haters of this song, so true!! The biggest challenge getting the rate started was resisting the urge to just loop this, tbh

**whoisValensi** (11): This is the only acceptable "Blinding Lights" copy, admit it. ~~Tho my hot take is this is better than 'Blinding Lights' lol.~~ Anyways, 👏🏻 EVERGLOW! 👏🏻 FOREVER! 👏🏻 LET'S! 👏🏻 GO! 👏🏻

**-chilazon-** (10): Deserves an 11. Love this song so much in every way. EVERGLOW FOREVER LET'S GO

**2l82bstr8** (10): a literal masterpiece

**agentofscranton** (10): is it just blinding lights? yes. does it still fuck like a bullet train? yes.

**akanewasright** (10): I’d call this yassified blinding lights, but blinding lights was already pretty yassified

**anagalisgv** (10): this is the song I show my friends who don't listen to kpop to get them interested

**AssailantArcturus** (10): banger alert

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): holy fuck this slaps hard

**BasedButta** (10): OHHH SHITTTT SO GOOD this would be my eleven but the sucky breakdown after the fist chorus was a fucking sin and must not go unpunished

**bespectacIed** (10): Everglow following up their blackpink-lite EDM threats with this moody synthwave perfection, are they madddd??? I stanned so hard. Everglow forever let's go!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is POP music!!

**bluetriangles04** (10): a potential candidate for my 11, LA DI DA is the perfect love child of the K-Pop Scene and the revitalization of retro synthwave in pop music brought on by Blinding Lights.

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): They served severe cunt with this one, I can find no faults

**bookthieving** (10): maybe the best chorus in the entire rate

**celladonn** (10): The absolute serve

**chancehugs** (10): Another bad bitch anthem. Onda finally got some respect here.

**ChickyDipper** (10): I would let Sihyeon step on me

**Cooler\_lin** (10): if this had a better climax/high note she would have beaten out everybody. this instrumental..

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is so good what happened last time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): okay this is a bit Blinding Lights-core but it GOES HARD

**en#8502** (10): wonder if they will also get sued for singing "this one is for the players and the haters"

**Esh\_Kebab** (10): HOLY SHIT THEY GAVE ONDA LINES ON THIS ONE

**Gonza\_90** (10): Is this from Kung Fury?

**GREY** (10): IT GAVEEE woke up in the gay gene is everyone had the dolls yassing all over twitter

**hikkaru** (10): i didn't like anything from everglow until this SYNTHWAVE SLAY!

**hunnybee12** (10): this ⬇ is 😮 to all ❗ the 🔚 players and 😵➕ the ➕😜 haters: i 😎 don't give 🚨 a what 😤

**ignitethephoenix** (10): blinding lights again paving the way, will this end up winning also?

**intheaftermath** (10): i usually despise anti-haters songs but this is so freaking good... maybe the real sick beat was Everglow's gorgeous use of synth...

**jasannn** (10): i’ve grunted in public too many times bc of this song

**lady\_sable** (10): aisha supremacy

**lalafairy18** (10): And now the best song to come out of the 80s trend in kpop

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): only bops for real

**mengzhongmeng** (10): got no time for haters, got lots of time for this song

**mimins** (10): literally perfection.. the 'IM LIKE!' and 'HUH!' in the chorus make me irrationally happy...and the dance break!!!

**notarobot3675** (10): yet to match this song for me

**note\_2\_self** (10): perfection again soty

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Abel Makkonen Tesfaye UR SO DUN!

**pornypete** (10): 2020 soty material

**PSSST12** (10): such a well made pop song. Didn't hit at first but Im a fan now lol.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): blinding lights core in that it's gonna be a smash winner!!!

**RaphaelArthur** (10): not perfect but close, extremely great sound and has relaunched kpop into the right direction

**RReg29** (10): A killer retro track to pair with ICSM by Twice

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I will never forgive everyone for letting this flop and forcing them to go back to their old sound again.

**runaway3212** (10): YASSS1

**seanderlust** (10): these instrumentals are giving blinding lights and, like in blinding lights, they slap

**skargardin** (10): everyone say thank you blinding lights

**superr\_rad** (10): I feel like this song is the best of the best of the 80’s synth renaissance of 2020. When I have it on in the car or my airpods, I immediately feel like im a badass superhero or something. The UGH!s really elevate the song so much, and the choreo is giving Cher!!!

**terrencelovescum** (10): abel released blinding lights and all of korea said lemme try! plus the voguing...GAY RIGHTS!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): we love blatant attempts to cash in on blinding lights hype

**thegirlin512** (10): The intro might be one of my favourites from this rate as is the chorus. Eleven contender.

**throwaway-7650** (10): this isn't just the korean blinding lights, it's **better**!

**TiltControls** (10): The vocals on this are something else. That chorus especially

**vivianlight** (10): Masterpiece

**yatcho** (10): i really didnt think they had such a hard serve in them, egg on my face fr

**toyletpauper** (9.9): From the first note, the vibe is everything. Some weak points, but it’s strong points are exceedingly amazing.

**Zypker125** (9.6): This redeemed Everglow from Dun Dun. Also, the black latex outfits were hot (esp. Sihyeon's).

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9.5): it was a slay for the retro trend

**ebooks#5454** (9.5): EVER-GLOW FOREVER LETS GO!!!!!!

**rikarikachan** (9.5): everglow forever let's go ha(ok but seriously, top 5 k-synthpop releases)

**Victerade** (9.5): aged a bit bad but still an amazing song and their best title!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): synthpop queens. gorgeous chorus, love the little “la di da di da” repeating by EU during it. second verse is my favorite part.

**DaBigBoi** (9.2): The rap and lyrics deduct from an otherwise amazing rush of retro.

ggsmackdown: **-mczrv-** (9): cue the applause

**cuttackone** (9): i cant fathom how everglow was THIS bad then was THIS good for a brief second then went back to being THIS bad immediately

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As much as I liked DUN DUN, I am definitely not surprised that many K-pop stans prefer LA DI DA. The production of this sounds astounding thanks to its 80s synthpop sound that complements Everglow really well. Honestly, if there is a mash-up of this and I CAN’T STOP ME, we got ourselves a #1 hit!

**flavasavavandal** (9): The duality of Everglow

**JohnnyToby** (9): ty the Weeknd

**Nixon4Prez** (9): Sure it kind of copied Blinding Lights but that song is great and so is this one

**notallslendermen** (9): What can I say, I'm a sucker for retro concepts

**poemforsmallthings** (9): #ThankYouTheWeeknd

**vayyiqra** (9): Everglow please shout more stuff over synthpop

**welcome2thejam** (9): EV-ER-GLOW FOR-EV-ER LETS GO is also a contender for best song moment in this rate, got my ass going "Hell yeah baby Everglow forever" about a group I just discovered eight minutes ago

**SkylarV** (8.8): This song was representative of K-pop's 2020 retro wave for a reason

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is definitely a bop but it really is a poor man's Blinding Lights. Sorry to say but you can clearly tell it's meant to capitalize on the new (old?) sound pushed by BL but is changed a bit so they're not exactly the same, but all the changes just make it worse.

**anothertown** (8.5): it's giving kim petras turn off the light

**ke1per** (8.5): wrote in my notes 'don't mind the raps aaaand I spoke too soon'

**prada** (8.5): boppy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.1): love it but it's not DUN DUN

**astrologicalangel** (8): I don't care for the verses but that chorus goes off

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): liked the sound effects would listen again

**pig-serpent** (8): I want to hate on one of the snythwave songs in this rate because all of them have generic synth choices and weak atmosphere, but dang all three of them are really catchy and well written.

**Roxieloxie** (8): i like this song but it stresses me out because it sounds like they are at war, like i feel like im an extra that just stumbled into a massive dance off between two divas and im just trying to avoid being hit in the head with a diamond

**sabooyah** (8): Catchy and fun! Wish the chorus was slightly different but maybe I'm being picky.





# The Haters they were talking about

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Sounds epic but I really don’t like all the “ladida”s and ESPECIALLY the “haters” line. Wait, did they just say “Shake it off”?? Uhhhhhh

**sage** (7.9): literally one of the most overrated kpop songs ever i wish i could give it a lower score but it bops. kpop for people who dont like kpop-core

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I was like SO excited for this song to come out because it felt so fresh, and I still think that it’s a really objectively good comeback…but the Physical / Blinding Lights clone sound has grown off me in the past year (and I personally think it’s done better elsewhere; even in this rate alone, with So Bad).

**savemeaseat143** (7.4): ah yes kpop 80s revival

**becca** (7): aurkay

**rubbie** (7): Another variation on the "physical"/"i can't stop me" retro vibe, nice chorus though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): it sounds like a rave.dj mashup of blinding lights and black widow

**waluigiest** (7): the chorus was a great start but the rest feels disappointing

**thGnerd** (6.5): Cringe english ruins track

**bulforster** (6.2): I'm afraid I can't hear what y'all do in this one over the Cher Lloyd grunts

**Stryxen** (5): it’s fine… i don’t get how this is a front runner it's just fine. the chorus slays a few boots

**apatel27** (3.5): Terrible chorus

**DefaultPophead** (3.5): The worst of the "Blinding Lights" wannabes. Not even Sihyeon's lovely voice could save this train wreck.

**cloudbustingmp3** (2.4): got no time for this song

**anarkyah** (2): Slight improvement from Dun Dun but not by much

**Awkward\_King** (0): im sorry because i dont think it is the objective worst song in this rate i just.... i cant enjoy it because all the elements i like i find are done better in the style it is a pastiche of uiewjsdjk. like i dont find it to be a problem with a lot of the blinding lights/physical children of the rate but this just has several elements i dont like too, so it feels like everything i like about the song i cant even attribute to the song itself, and i enjoyed dun dun so much

**useless-sheep** (0): blinding lights/physical copy #38472, corny haters lyrics, vaguely grating vocals…

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.750): LA DI DA was the first song I actually enjoyed from them (no, I didn’t like Bon Bon Chocolat), which took me by surprise because at that point I’d effectively written EVERGLOW off as a group I was never destined to like. And then First came along but we ignore that asfjgl but I LOVE Pirate!! They’re so hit-and-miss for me, but Aisha is forever 🥵

**whoisValensi** (10.500): Dudes, I FUCKING LOVE EVERGLOW!!!!!! Seriously, probably my favorite 4th gen group out there rn (aside from STAYC but seniority rights or whatever lol) Every title they've put out since their first comeback (not debut tho...) is like a solid 10 for me instantly. They genuinely have like such a fucking power to create these insane bangers, even if they change up their sound a bit. So yeah! Love them! Maybe we'll get that first album this year...

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10.000): I feel like they have like 5 songs, but all of them are good

**moonagenightmares** (10.000): these scores making me look like an everglow stan

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): ~~...the only group to get an actual 10 average from me~~

**reiichitanaka** (9.750): Image wise they’re like, Blackpink 2.0, except they get to show off much more regularly (and with better, less same-y songs).

**TiltControls** (9.500): Another group that I loved in this rate (well even though they only had 2 songs). Love the energy, love the production, love the vocals - it's just all so good

**AxymHeart** (9.500): One of the groups that made me love Kpop

**Round\_Log401** (9.500): One of my fave groups. So well rounded, each one of them brings something different to the group. All of them have so much stage charisma, always have great B-sides & their debut is still one of my top faves.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.250): Everglow gets a lot of unnecessary hate because K-pop fans have a problem with the group being managed by a Chinese company as well as the accusations of buying YouTube views in their music videos. It’s really a shame because, among the girl groups doing the girl crush concepts, Everglow stands out the most with their songs. Their concept is not exactly mind-blowing but at least they are bringing something new to the table with their music. (Everglow bias: N/A)

**-chilazon-** (9.250): they've got so much potential, can't wait to see more of thm in the future

**Cooler\_lin** (9.000): if y'all added bon bon chocolat it would have been a wrap for everybody else

**BasedButta** (9.000): the two songs picked are their best by far good job whoever chose em as im not a fan of any of their other ones

**toyletpauper** (8.650): Love their b-sides and they have really crisp and consistent title tracks that I do believe gets more hate than it deserves.

**vayyiqra** (8.500): Running out of things to say after hours of this rate but this band is cool need to listen to them more !

**bespectacIed** (8.500): BP's eldest daughters but ykw,,, they do serve from time to time. Rooting for the girls, they're talented and pretty

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.250): I fear they’re never leaving nugudom

**rslashpoopheads** (8.250): I love Sihyun.

**-mczrv-** (8.000): No Good Reason is a great reason to give Everglow a listen

**pig-serpent** (8.000): I'm not sure they're doing anything the other groups aren't doing, but they're certainly doing it well.

**GapeCod** (8.000): shiver me timbers

**ke1per** (7.500): raps are hit or miss

**Zypker125** (6.400): They sometimes release amazing songs (Bon Bon Chocolat, La Di Da, Pirate), sometimes release meh songs (Adios, Dun Dun, First). Really a group that runs hot and cold for me.

**donutseer** (6.000): La Di Da is exceptional in their discog, thanks to the retro trend.

**dekubaku** (5.500): I don't vibe with their sound but I definitely enjoyed La Di Da. Pity that they didn't play on the retro trend a bit more.

**fadedblue09** (2.500): Apologies to their fans but I honestly have never enjoyed any of their titles (thank god the atrocious Pirate wasn't here). On top of being not really into their concept, their vocals and production are just unremarkable for me

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BANGER!! This song is so sweet but kinda oddly sad at the same time. Also the period where this was actually winning the rate for some time was the best timeline, just because fromis_9 winning a rate on r/popheads is too iconic.

**wavingwolves** (10): This is not only my favourite song in the rate, but also a song I kind of payola'd in myself with no much reason besides the fact it was kind of a cult classic in some circles and the fact it's one of my favourite k-pop songs of all time. I made the right choice, clearly, since it places here. It would get my 11 if it didn't fell a little short as a package (considering visuals + concept + performance) for me, which is why MAGO got my 11 and this didn't, even though I find both spectacular songs. Still, to see this get this high here is truly amazing! Love Bomb as a song is full of the most euphoric feelings and also has the best chorus of the rate. It's exhilarating, just the type of music to make me feel a little bit invincible.

---

# Supportive of fraud 

**billie\_\_** (11): this song takes me out at the knees every single time i hear it and i still listen to it basically everyday. the chorus is somehow both wildly hyperactive and heartbreaking at the same time. a heavenly bridge. a perfect song actually.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Who needs to feel actual romantic feelings towards anybody when you can just leech off the serotonin of songs like this??

**BooksAndWhisky** (11): Deceptively cute yet forlorn. The paragon of cute concepts, deserves an 11 for the bridge alone

**bookthieving** (11): love bomb 🤝 russian roulette: ~~r/popheads kpop rate winners~~ bubblegum kpop songs with stuttering vocal effects and violence as a metaphor for love

**Bryoneehhh\_** (11): fromis i am rooting for you to win this rate. please get out of nugudom even tho ur under hybe and become the main pop girls of r slash popheads PLEASE i am manifesting it please have there be a fromis full discography rate next

**bulforster** (11): nuclear level detonation of the yassgrenade

**Cooler\_lin** (11): i really didn't want to make my favorite song be one of the first songs i listened to but my notes when i first listened to this track for this rank are as follows: "Best chorus BY FAR!!!! REAL MUSIC!!!!! That post bridge........THIS OUTRO 10/10"

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): pure bliss

**flavasavavandal** (11): This is so fucking cute, I didn’t even think I was going to give a 10 in this rate but this is so just so exquisitely sweet and I want more. The little pops in the chorus, the fucking outro. Ugh I’m so happy I found this song

**Frostbite522** (11): peak kpop

**Nixon4Prez** (11): The best kpop song, period. Pop perfection.

**notallslendermen** (11): One of the best gg songs of all time imo. I love everything about it- the verses, the bridge (!!!), the repeat of the opening refrain before the final chorus, the way it manages to sound both upbeat and melancholic at the same time. I really wish this had been their breakthrough hit- it's completely perfect from start to finish.

**plastichaxan** (11): yeah i dont think i had any other choice in the end lol

**RandomHypnotica** (11): fromis_9 if you read this I am free on Friday night and would like to hang out. Friday night is when I'm free fromis_9 if you would like to hang out.

**welcome2thejam** (11): I will say I liked it slightly better before looking up the translation; the sound and the fantastic MV gave off a feeling of apprehension that I think could've added an interesting layer. But in this case, it's not worth deducting points for not being something it never claimed to be, and Love Bomb deserves the accolades anyway with great performances, structure, and an all-timer chorus. Just the hypest shit possible. It's explosive, and when that final one hits, Love Bomb just blows me away

**-mczrv-** (10): devastating

**1998tweety** (10): I've been saying it over and over again but whew what pop perfection. Check out the rest of their discog cause they have several serves like this (their new EP slaps). 11 contender !!!!!

**2dina3dworld** (10): it may have bombed in the charts but it love bombed in my heart ❤️❤️

**2l82bstr8** (10): my day was instantly brightened by this song. pure unbridled chaotic joy

**agentofscranton** (10): fromis and iz*one are proof that every survival group should be rigged cause like, look at the material

**akanewasright** (10): I kinda hate the imagery in the video but this song is so goddamn fun I can’t help but love it

**anarkyah** (10): Pop at it’s best, bright and catchy

**AssailantArcturus** (10): another eleven consideration

**Awkward\_King** (10): i wanna do poppers

**bespectacIed** (10): Not this nugu-ish survival show group coming out swinging with a BOP as good as this. What a moment. Everyone really rooted and celebrated for them. Still does, btw!

**chancehugs** (10): This song should've gotten an all kill and pushed them to A-tier territory. How this song did not get them their a win (or 9) is beyond me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): armchair psychologists on social media QUAKING at the power of this bop

**DaBigBoi** (10): If only they could stop making disco pop to return to quirky pop bangers like this. The sense of melancholy in an explosion of sugar they’ve made is such an evocative feeling.

**en#8502** (10): this club has everything.... love, bomb, camp, amazing-ness....

**fadedblue09** (10): One of my favorite groups atm. Just a bubblegum delight. Probably wouldve been my 11 if I was logical

**ggal2020** (10): fromis_9 will be the cure to 4th gen’s girl crush disease

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): one of the best Kpop songs/music videos of all time, full stop

**hunnybee12** (10): smasher

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this makes me feel happy

**JsaKim** (10): this song is too overlooked

**mengzhongmeng** (10): bridge is heaven, mv is so cute

**notarobot3675** (10): very cute!

**PSSST12** (10): A HIT the production on this one is to tier and the bridge???? Yas queen skinny legend versace boots the house down etc.

**rikarikachan** (10): I want it! I love it! This is peak annoying-cutesy bop. I love this shit. Am I really only allowed one 11? Stan fromis y'all

**rubbie** (10): kinda the same type of song as RV's "power up" I guess: hyperactive hook-filled tune whose sugary chorus defies all ideas of reason or taste. But taste and reason don't matter when the damn melodies are this brilliant

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSSS!

**sabooyah** (10): Disgustingly good.

**SatC1** (10): uwu

**seanderlust** (10): SO FUN. hyperactive and boppy.

**skargardin** (10): ITS THE SMASHA

**SkylarV** (10): Transcendent pop perfection, not my favorite fromis song but definitely their best

**superr\_rad** (10): THIS SONG IS AMAZING!!! I’m glad fromis is seemingly getting paid their dues this year but more people should definitely know about this song. I had to stop listening to it while driving cause I cant stop moving during the chorus and I almost wrecked lmao

**thGnerd** (10): The song that put fromis9 on the map and kind of blew up

**toyletpauper** (10): Quirky-licious. Such an amazing backing track/instrumental, especially the mind-melting chorus.

**vivianlight** (10): One of my favorite song ever it almost got the special score

**yatcho** (10): Just an explosion of energy from the start, this is the most fun song in the rate and exactly why im into kpop

=====

ggsmackdown: **b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.6): not sure what score to give this so I'm just gonna give it the funny number and move on

**anagalisgv** (9.5): justice for love bomb it deserved more!!

**BasedButta** (9.5): they really got it right with this one

**cherryices** (9.5): saerom hates her job she’s just like me

**JohnnyToby** (9.5): gyuri carried!

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): possibly the most bubblegum song in the rate...and it works!

**Victerade** (9.5): ONE OF THEIR BEST TITLES shouldve given them their first win but dm also slays

**throwaway-7650** (9.3): the chorus washes the rest of the song so hard

**alwayswords** (9): Mnet’s ‘Idol School’ (Fromis 9) was manipulated 233 times

**apatel27** (9): The bridge & chorus and the drop doesn't disappoint

**celladonn** (9): This is so fun

**CrimsonROSET** (9): we love whiplash in interludes

**ivyleaf33** (9): the hi-hat going off on my left ear in the chorus though, why???

**jasannn** (9): maybe r/kpop does have taste

**lady\_sable** (9): this was a cultural reset

**lalafairy18** (9): The chorus of this song feels so sad for some reason

**RaphaelArthur** (9): really great song, so unique, catchy and beautiful chorus

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i just thought it was the best chorus i ever heard

**vayyiqra** (9): Goofy fun

**whoisValensi** (9): The obvious as fuck green-screen in this video is camp. (And I say that because wow there is some bad Chroma keying in there...)

**Zypker125** (8.8): Kinda overrated, the rap break and the bridge don't do anything for me, but the last chorus's ad-libs are still magical as always.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.7): not my thing but not bad. It’s catchy after some time

**poemforsmallthings** (8.6): that bridge + last chorus... beauuutiful

**-chilazon-** (8.5): Pure catchiness, but repetitive as hell

**prada** (8.5): bop!

**TiltControls** (8.5): I love the MV for this one. No idea what's going on but it looks so fun

**savemeaseat143** (8.4): lolololove bomb

**sarcasticsobs** (8.1): didn’t grab me until that chorus, whew lad

**brpr425** (8): The chorus always makes me smile :)

**ebooks#5454** (8): this m/v is a fever dream

**frogaranaman** (8): chorus just reminded me to put on some lip balm

**pig-serpent** (8): Very cutesy but with a lot of more popping and screeching parts that give the song depth. The song's fairly creative in that regard and it makes the cute parts even cuter.

**pornypete** (8): not as carzy about it as some, but it is a great song

**Tazzachar** (8): This is my favorite type of kpop song, high energy and up tempo

**thegirlin512** (8): Okay this one is cute and smiley. Not a fan of the intro though.


# Uhh.. It bombed!

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): it's so nearly amazing but there's just something missing

**becca** (7): aurkay i guess.

**DefaultPophead** (7): Wouldn't play this on my own, but if it came on shuffle, I'd turn it up.

**mimins** (7): I know giving this lower than a 10 is slander but I do not vibe with it that much...It is a good song but not that good!!!!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): the rap slapped

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Very video game-y. I like it

**universemates** (6.8): internet psychologists' newest favorite word

**sage** (6.3): the bridge brings this up a point or two other than that its kinda mid.. dkdk and glass shoes CLEARED !

**cuttackone** (6): never returned to this decent song

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (6): Kinda mid

**ke1per** (6): harmonies are very pretty, bridge doesn't do it for me

**rslashpoopheads** (6): This song has just never really clicked for me but since reddit is obsessed with it it will probably get top 5.

**nt96** (5): This bombed alright

**ChickyDipper** (4.5): I still don't get the love for this song, I'm sorry guys 😭

**GREY** (4): kpop stans acting like love bomb is the 2nd coming of christ when its not even top 3 title track from them aurrr who's gonna tell these lgbt people that DKDK exists

**Flippantry** (3): Emphasis on the bomb


# Has anyone counted? I'm curious

**terrencelovescum** (2): my god how many times can one repeat love bomb

bespectacIed: Good top 2. MAGO got this in the 👜, i think. Better song and the sympathy votes were still coming in fresh (fly high, angles 🕊️)

But anti-establishment (underscoring the main girls) and inferiority complex (overscoring the nugus and the no-mores) really won in this rate

**throwaway-7650** (9.438): aespa having the only sub-9 score in this section... fuck SM [2]

**whoisValensi** (8.313): Hmmm I'm not sure how to handle this "group" comment because there's a lot of groups here without much of a general theme. I mean you have some 3rd gen icons, some 4th gen debuts, etc. etc. It's a very mixed bag with a mixed quality that defines it I suppose. I will say, I do look forward to seeing what the 4th gen groups here put out in the future for the most part. Maybe I should give Fromis_9 another go. And once more, I FUCKING MISS EXID.

**runaway3212** (8.125): In order, Weeekly is overrated, STAYC is iconic and I love them, Aespa is the best thing since sliced bread, EXID is super exciting always, APINK and CLC im not super familiar with but what I've heard is super great. Fromis 9 did more for kpop than BTS, APRIL outsold May!

**vayyiqra** (7.875): A bit surprised Aespa only got one song in here. But I don't know most of these groups other than the names.

**donutseer** (7.875): April has solid music with strong vocal writing and their last one Da Capo is a rec!

**rslashpoopheads** (7.500): Exactly queens.

**wavingwolves** (11): I truly can't believe a song I gave an 11 to actually gets to win a rate I'm hosting, what a dream come true! I haven't even had an 11 win since 2020 with Your Best American Girl! Honestly, it took so much deliberation and playing my five 11 contenders (this, Love Bomb, Oh! My Mistake, Very Very Very and Secret) over and over for me to decide on what song to put my weight behind and I chose this because, ultimately, I just wanted to support GFRIEND, who were for a long time my favourite group along TWICE. I knew this would be their only chance to get any flowers in a rate and I feared for them after they got done so dirty last Girl Group Singles rate (they were out before Day 3 in a rate with their best songs!), so I'm deeply happy about this. GFRIEND have disbanded now and this was their last song together and it's truly bittersweet to see them disband when they had reached such high highs as a group, so I feel a little avenged to see them get their flowers here, right now, with this song. This is also the first time a K-Pop song is able to break the 9 average and I can't say it isn't deserving. WE WILL MISS YOU FOREVER, GODFRIEND!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): And we officially have our winner of this rate! Can anyone really say that it isn’t deserved? Like so many of you mentioned, what an amazing song to disband with. This is also our first K-pop winner that’s broken a 9 average; thank you GLEGENDS!

# I wish I had written this 

**GREY** (10): words cannot explain the joy, the serotonin rush, the brain tingles i go through during this 3 minute and 19 second slay.. actually im not done this is one of the best song ever made. Top 10 ultimate slays in this ever expanding universe. No just think about it we've come so far in life, from the first yass particle developing into the home we know now. From the dinosaurs roaming the land we walk on to Pangea changing the game and leaving triceratops shook.. to the cavepeople to gravity being discovered to light being created to technology to automobiles to tvs to phones to this point in time where someones brain can decide to put together different instruments and sounds to create an experience that brings me oh so much excitement and happiness. Thank you Godfriend for your contribution to society, you will never be forgotten in my heart and many more across the globe <3


# Magicians, wizards, witches, mages, people who speak latin languages, etc

**2l82bstr8** (11): pure unadulterated luxury. throwing champagne on your glimmering skin and sequin outfit. making out with someone in a navy crushed velvet bedspread. maybe, somewhere deep inside, you suddenly understand how someone could think capitalism sounds like a good idea

**akanewasright** (11): on at least one occasion I have been in public in my pajamas, feeling embarrassed about myself and my existence and put this song on to calm my nerves. And you know, it doesn’t work at all, but the song slaps

**anagalisgv** (11): queens of having TWO incredible choruses!

**nosnoop** (11): The only song to deserve a 11!  No contest.

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): i kinda get why they disbanded… showed up and popped their pussies on stage just to debut at like #48 on gaon but this song will go down in history as one of the greatest k-pop songs of all time

**rotating3Dtext** (11): this is just like, a perfect pop song that I could show my friends who know nothing about kpop.

**SatC1** (11): yesssss! great way to go but sad they did.

**SFbby** (11): Yuju on that stripper pole>>>>>>>

**skargardin** (11): the best kpop song to come out of the retro trend, we HAVE to stan!!

**superr\_rad** (11): This is one of those songs that I loved from first listen. The beginning synths that draw you in.. the addicting vocals… the amazing chorus!!!! The fun choreo, the super hot video (Yuju on the pole took me out instantly) and the disco aesthetics. I am still mourning their disbandment because this song showed so much potential for their mature concept that we will never see followed through ☹ probably one of the best final comebacks for any kpop group and the song that got me into the rest of their discography!!

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): the best song by any k-pop girl group and i will not take any arguments on that

**yatcho** (11): Throwback synths were a true epidemic in kpop for a few years and they did it the absolute best since Wondergirls. They truly came into their own this era and it completely floored me how confident and sultry they could be. Giving this my 11 as justice for their untimely demise, RIGHT as i got into them

**-chilazon-** (10): Wow! Gfriend went out with a banger! Ugh now I'm so saaaad, whyyyyy did it have to be their last one

**-mczrv-** (10): tops the highest of tiers, I apologize on psycho’s behalf

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection idk what else to say, that chorus is IMMACULATE. We love a disbandment song. 11 contender

**2dina3dworld** (10): *insert that gif of that girl dancing that Ricki always uses*

**agentofscranton** (10): greatest disbandment single of all time

**alwayswords** (10): hybe hit the SLAY button

**AssailantArcturus** (10): the song that made me get into them leading to me listening to all of their songs and them becoming a top five group of mine JUST TO DISBAND FOUR MONTHS LATER

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): okay now this is the good shit

**BasedButta** (10): god

**becca** (10): AGAIN GSLAY

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the best releases of the decade, I'm not joking. GFRIEND's fate was damn cruel. Much hyped acquisition, releasing the best materials of their career, everyone having such high hopes for their future sonic direction... only for them to release the greatest disbandment song of all time. Fly high, angles.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The sheer number of disco-themed music videos that came out in 2020…

**bluetriangles04** (10): Best disbandment song ever.

**bookthieving** (10): yes you!

**brpr425** (10): I forgot how good this was until I relistened, definitely can't give it anything lower than a ten

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): im still so upset that they disbanded

**bulforster** (10): they had to disband after this because it's dangerous to operate at this level of slay for too long

**celladonn** (10): They really put their whole GFrussies into this

**chancehugs** (10): Blinding Light's effect. Only Gfriend can make me jam to the words "Hakuna Matata" unironically

**cherryices** (10): somebody make a decent mashup of this and drunk-dazed please!! rave.dj isn’t cutting it

**ChickyDipper** (10): one of the best kpop songs ever made

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is how you go out with a bang!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wait…….

**cuttackone** (10): magic was happening

**DaBigBoi** (10): This is the song that plays when the witches in The Witch start floating because their coochies be levitating to the beat.

**dlong56655** (10): They went out with a bang(er) at least

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember Buddies speculated that MAGO was possibly going to be the end of GFriend, or at least in their universe arc or something. I wonder how these Buddies feel that their thoery is correct in some way? Anyways, GFRIEND’s disbandment is a huge shock especially since they are positioned to be HYBE’s biggest girl group. Oh well, at least GFRIEND gave us this bop as their de-facto disbandment song. As the hosts of the rate would say in the rate post in non-verbatim, they served cunt and vanished like queens.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the most acclaimed song in the rate according to the singles jukebox

**intheaftermath** (10): literally so legendary

**ivyleaf33** (10): the retro trend was one of the best things to hit kpop in recent years, and this song is one of the reasons why

**jasannn** (10): was it the yassification that made them disband?

**JohnnyToby** (10): it's so yummy!

**ke1per** (10): could do without the hakuna matata in the chorus though

**KoolFunk** (10): Is this their last title track? Wow. What a way to go out!

**Kwcty6888** (10): perfection

**lady\_sable** (10): it really does suck that gfriend disbanded after their best era

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): gfriend i miss you so much

**pornypete** (10): the whole trilogy was spectacular. I was crying Apple soty all the way until MAGO dropped

**PSSST12** (10): Gfreund said Gay rights with this one. Although Rough remains their masterpiece, this was such a good last comeback for them.

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh theres disco in this rate?

**RReg29** (10): Best song of 2020 tbh

**rslashpoopheads** (10): In a perfect world they would have released 10 songs of this instead of 10 songs of Glass Bead.

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSS!

**sage** (10): flop di da and i flopped stop me are over.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): i mean if you’ve got to go out, what a freakin’ tune to out on (don’t be confused, i'm still mad). just barely missed getting my 11. the guitar during the pre-chorus and chorus slaps. yuju, step on me. sinb, murder me.

**savemeaseat143** (10): all the elements of the song work really well for me. I love the chorus a lot

**seanderlust** (10): when MARINA said "all my friends are witches" this is what she thought she was serving.

**Stryxen** (10): why does this sound like my crown

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): how have i literally never seen anyone mention this song when they discuss great kpop songs. this is literally pop perfection

**Tazzachar** (10): The “Hakuna Matata” part in the chorus is really smooth, I was really disappointed this turned out to be their final release considering how solid it was

**thedoctordances1940** (10): massive bop

**thegirlin512** (10): The chorus is probably one of my favourite 2020 releases in kpop. It sucks this was their last song because I really liked it and it made me excited to see where they were going musically.

**throwaway-7650** (10): the rate winner in a just world... unfortunately we live in an unjust world where they are DISBANDED. GONE. FOREVER. MAGO MAGO.

**toyletpauper** (10): New 80s disco perfection.

**ulalka** (10): I would give this an eleven too if I could

**welcome2thejam** (10): Finding out they broke up soon after this checks out, it feels like they crammed every last hook they had left into the chorus

**whoisValensi** (10): Hate the fact that this is the last song they ever released but like WOW what a fucking song to go out on!

**terrencelovescum** (9.9): they went away with a BANG! taking a tenth away for the hakuna matata in the chorus. i hated that song in lion king.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): wait they served here after like three mid songs

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): This is by far the song with the best instrumental in the rate

**anothertown** (9): YES YOU!!

**bigbigbee** (9): living for the RPDR season 1 filter on this MV

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (9): WDYM THEY DISBANDED TTTT

**DefaultPophead** (9): I almost forget about my crippling depression when I am listening to GFRIEND!

**Nixon4Prez** (9): GFRIEND knows how to go out with a bang

**TiltControls** (9): This has such a sleek sound to it

**vayyiqra** (9): This sounds like it was written by Abba (compliment)

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Certified bop… wait, "Hakuna Matata"???

**Victerade** (9): when it clicked it really did!

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.9): A disbandment song for the ages

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): yes you!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): seeing how much hype this got I was a little underwhelemed tbh. It's a bop tho

**anarkyah** (8.5): And so this shall remain their disbandment song……

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): has anyone told them they ate that bc like.... this so pussy

**billie\_\_** (8.5): perhaps the best use of hakuna matata in kpop.

**RaphaelArthur** (8.5): somehow basic but so beautiful and catchy

**rikarikachan** (8.2): Ah, GFRIEND's 80s song. The year of the synthpop revival was a good one.

**flavasavavandal** (8): It’s a nice song and all but it sounds better suited for the nu-disco rate

**reiichitanaka** (8): Of course the one Gfriend song I like is the one with the disco influence.

**rubbie** (8): I thought I'd heard this before but apparently not? Anyway, nice nostalgic tune, superbly written, although it doesn't compare with their classic anime-style songs imo.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): ooo i loved this

**mimins** (7.5): really enjoyable plus nice music video

**prada** (7.5): slay

**Cooler\_lin** (7): definitely their best track on here and I had it stuck in my head for a while after i heard it! catchy and funky, bassline is nice and the bridge>

**sabooyah** (6): The most memorable of the four tracks (although that's not really saying much).

**Zypker125** (5.8): Something something Yuju's pole dance and outfit was hot something something

**Round\_Log401** (5): Not bad, I understand why people like it but it's also not exciting for me.

# The only negative comments this song has 

**SkylarV** (5): This song does not fit the brief, it just doesn't work for me

**apatel27** (4): Mix is weird

**vaguelycatshaped** (3): Maybe I'd like it more if it hadn't been released after 32978 other retro concepts

ChickyDipper: If I'd known Fraudmis would have gotten this far I would have given them my ZERO! I can't be that mad though because Mago is a very deserving winner. Fly high GFRIEND, thank you for dropping this absolute bop and then disbanding because you knew you'd never possibly top it 💔

Thanks for the great rate, rate mods! It was very fun even if I now suspect the musical palette of 95% of the participants  ❤

# GFRIEND

wavingwolves: A group that had their breakthrough because of a very viral [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag2R7Mt8yI8) of them performing in an wet stage and falling over and over again! A miracle group, really, and my favourite too! Honestly, I just love everything about GFRIEND and I think they are and always have been such strong artists with what I consider the best title track run of the history of K-Pop and probably the most consistent group in terms of performance, choreography and concept as well. They were one of the groups that truly changed the game for the next generation when it came to dance, having many viral moments based on their very [precise](https://youtu.be/SBSeNveqpx0) and [syncronized](https://youtu.be/hihBGtZCij0) movements. Even the reason why 2x time speed dancing became popular is [GFRIEND](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRCOldQ3l8)! I also genuinely think all of their titles  ~~apart from Fever~~ are good to amazing, and most of them actually range from great to outstanding to me, so to see them do well here makes me happy!

MoonlightByWindow: WE MISS YOU GODFRIEND!! Gone too soon but never forgotten :( I’m mad that I really only looked into their discography after they disbanded, they had so many incredible songs. Obligatory FUCK HYBE.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.825): Gfriend's disbandment will never not hurt. Such an iconic group

**-chilazon-** (9.750): So sad they disbanded :( I love their earlier releases but their new style is so good too! Wish they got to explore more, they were just getting started!!

**brokebutter** (9.600): they've never made a bad song

**yatcho** (9.425): One of the most tragic victims of the 7 year curse, they would've been one of the greats if they got to continue

**throwaway-7650** (9.250): they literally served cunt (twice) and then died. FUCK HYBE

**sarcasticsobs** (9.050): COME BACK

**agentofscranton** (9.000): I'm still reeling from the fact that they've actually disbanded - horrendous day for the kpop industry

**TiltControls** (8.875): One of the strongest tracklists for this rate. Some really great stuff here

**whoisValensi** (8.750): Oh look another group I owe an apology. You know I actually listened to 'Rough' again a while back and went "FUCK I WAS AN IDIOT CHILD". I genuinely feel like I need to give them a whole new evaluation because like I get it now. I get why there were (and even arguably even tho they disbanded, still are) big. I think the thing I just regret the most is not giving them that chance before they disbanded. Thankfully at the time of writing the first VIVIZ EP dropped the other day so I think I'll go listen to that and Yuju's EP back to back. But like yeah... My apologies to everyone I've ever disappointed with my GFriend scores from the first K-Pop GG rate... I was very in the wrong.

**bespectacIed** (8.750): A celebration of life 🕊️ This is for my peoples who just lost somebody

**BasedButta** (8.750): RIP to these legends that almost never missed

**welcome2thejam** (8.500): Of all the groups in this rate, I want to dive into their work the most. Very strong set of songs in this rate

**RReg29** (8.500): Not the most famous but perhaps the most consistent girl group of all time

**runaway3212** (8.500): Thank you GODFRIEND for existing and making all our days better

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.375): For a non-Big 3 group, GFRIEND truly left a huge mark in the K-pop scene with their discography. Even though I am not a Buddy (yet), I am still upset at how GFriend suddenly disbanded before they even reached their seventh year as a group. At least the group is succeeded by Viviz now as the remaining members continue GFRIEND’s legacy. (GFRIEND’s bias: that member who did the pole dance in the MAGO video)

**bulforster** (8.325): they lived, were very consistent, served astronomical levels of cunt one time, then died

**AxymHeart** (8.250): Unfortunately found out about them after the disbandment announcement. Looking forward to their separate future works!

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.075): okay this is one of the groups that has REALLY grown on me since the last rate may they RIP but also stan yuju and viviz

**toyletpauper** (8.075): One of my favorite groups. Consistently amazing songs from debut. #JUSTICE4GFRIEND #FUCKHYBE

**donutseer** (8.000): best at what they do, and then they changed to pull off mature concepts as well.

**knarff21** (8.000): First time hearing all of these

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.750): just found out about gfriend disbanding….. damn that shit sucks

**ke1per** (7.750): love the lack of rap but like Twice I appreciate the more recent tracks to the earlier two

**vayyiqra** (7.500): I guess now is as good a time as any to admit that for an embrasssingly long time, I did not understand the difference between GFRIEND and (G)I-DLE. Smh fake fan.

**bookthieving** (7.500): we hate you hybe!

**rikarikachan** (7.400): I will admit GFRIEND's newer stuff didn't hit me as hard as their older stuff did but damn, what a shame that they're over.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.375): rip in peace

**SkylarV** (7.125): Gone too sudden and too soon (Crossroads conspicuously missing from this is pretty sus...(it's a 10 btw))

**ebooks#5454** (7.050): only ever heard the song ROUGH by them so i assumed they only made sad depressed girl music

**fadedblue09** (7.000): Sad I got into their music late but I have no regrets. I should listen to VIVIZ soon.

**RiviereDeMemoires** (7.000): I would have included Me Gustas Tu for them

**ChickyDipper** (6.950): watching old GFRIEND music videos just makes me sad now

**dekubaku** (6.500): Still can't believe they have disbanded. Their last two albums are simply stellar and sad that the group was gone at their peak.

**Cooler\_lin** (6.375): y'all could have cheated for this group wtheck

**mimins** (6.375): I do not remember what a single one of these songs sound like after listening to them multiple times

**rslashpoopheads** (6.250): They had a good run but it could have been even better if they had just kept releasing Magos.

**Round\_Log401** (6.000): Was never a fan but I respect them & their music.

**reiichitanaka** (5.750): I’m not saying they’re bad, just really not my taste : I find their type of music boring, even if it’s totally listenable, and I don’t think it highlights their vocals at all which is a shame for a group with such strong vocalists.

**pig-serpent** (5.625): A perfectly serviceable group that occasionally has some strong melodies, but overall I find them kind of average.

**anzunagi** (5.250): I promise this is not sabotage I haven't liked any of GFRIEND's music outside of Fingertip and Apple

**moonagenightmares** (4.800): here comes boring ass gfriend

**sublimeMusic** (2.500): They are so boring musically

MoonlightByWindow: **THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO SUBMITTED!!** I hope you all had fun during the reveal and it was an enjoyable experience. After everything GODFRIEND's gone through, I think we can all agree to give them this. ~~Also I'm much more satisfied with these results than BG rate~~

Once again, a big thank you to everyone <3

welcome2thejam: Super fun rate! This was basically my first foray into K-pop and I found some new fave songs and stuff to check out amongst it all, so I'm very happy to have done this. Enormous thumbs up to the rate hosts too for all the work and the banners and the reveal, was a blast even if I didn't understand like 95% of the in-jokes

Anyway, I gave MAGO one of its 116 (!) 10's, so I'm happy for its win, and Love Bomb for All Stars 6!

TiltControls: Thank you Ricki, Gucci, and Belb for an amazing rate! Y'all truly killed it with every section of hosting

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

#**Songs**

Congrats to **MAGO** for pulling out such a dominating win! Despite the slow climb of scores through the rate, MAGO has become the 1st Kpop song to crack the 9.000 average barrier. Across all songs it holds 277th place, right between Clean Bandit's Rather Be and Kelly Clarkson's Breakaway

For more good news, **Fancy**, **LOVE BOMB** and **Psycho** all score enough 11's to make it onto the top 25 leaderboard! Fancy and LOVE BOMB are tied for 18th with Bad Romance (from its 2nd win) and Psycho is tied for 23nd with two winners from last year: View and Immaterial. Psycho is also notably the only song on there to not have made the top 10. Previously the record for 11s for a non-top 10 song was set to 12 with The Veronicas' Untouched, Car Seat Headrest's Bodys, and Charli XCX's forever, and anthems.

On the other leaderboard, **Ice Cream** picked up enough 0s and then some to rocket its way into 2nd place for most 0's. With 41, it only sits behind Dua Lipa's Boys Will Be Boys which still holds the record by a good margin with 58 

#**Artists**

Lots of artists getting new updates this time around! (G)I-DLE and Apink have enough songs to be ranked now and the rest had been previously placed, though all of them have songs coming from other rates influencing their placements. Rankings for artists are out of **290**. Artists directly above and below placements are given for context

* 213th: OneRepublic (-0.010 points)

_

* 225th: Selena Gomez & The Scene (+0.006 points)
* **226th: MAMAMOO** (previously 225th)
* 227th: King Princess (-0.012 points)

_

* 257th: Nelly (+0.003 points)
* **258th BLACKPINK** (previously 211th) 
* 258th: The Neighbourhood (tie)
* 260th: Shakira (-0.002 points)

_

For non-average score stats, Blackpink just *barely* misses the most 0's list. Right now they're sitting around 11th or 12th so they better hope no one decides to put Ice Cream in all stars.

I don't know exactly how it went that time (I haven't read the rules/results). That time they focused on less groups, while this time they tried to include more groups. Anyway there are a lot of polls in this subreddit so I guess there are other kpop themed on the way or already done but that I don't know about lol, I'm new to this world.

I think the Smackdown was made to focus on more recent tracks (past 5 years-ish) not covered by the other 3
