# Hello, ARMYs... wait, I mean, Blinks? Onces?

[Welcome](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/837510667652300830/895682424187539546/20211007_021858.jpg) to Day 1 of the Girl Group SMACKDOWN! Rate. Brought to you by [ME!]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO1Nl9ErTsI) and my co-hosts /u/MoonlightByWindow and /u/rickikardashian,  it will surely be a day to remember. I hope everyone is ready to deal with the possible outrage and sadness of fans claiming their faves deserved to miss Day 1 entirely because of the greatness of their music. 

***

Today we will be revealing songs placing at **#65-#41**.

We'll be starting at **3pm EST**, an hour from now.

**VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION:** We will be testing **[pubby.club](https://pubby.club/~/ripplugdj)** for our reveal today. The platform looks a lot like our late plug.dj and **you'll need an account to be able to follow the reveal**. It takes no time to create one, though. 

In case of it not working as well as we hope, we will go back to **[Beatsense](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj?ref=beatster&u=P17763eac1c32)**!

**Make sure to keep this thread open**, as I will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out and it will feature the best banners anyone has ever seen in a rate, believe me.

ChickyDipper: As I think I said in the comments of my rate, my money is definitely on Psycho to win this whole thing. But then again there are some truly great songs in the mix so there could be an upset! I had about 6 songs that I had to cut down to work out what to give my 11 to and it was really, really hard to decide 😬

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): Remembering when this first came out and I looped it 30 times to try and convince myself I liked it then I just never listened to it again :( From the looks of it, a lot of y’all knew from the get-go that this is a terrible song! I honestly didn’t expect it to get THIS many 0s but I can’t say it’s not deserved. “Mona Lisa kinda Lisa” will always remain iconic.

**wavingwolves** (1.5): Here's an almost record breaking song with the second most zeroes ever gotten in a rate, only not being able to beat Boys Will Be Boys by Dua Lipa. In all honesty, though, I've been shuffling the SMACKDOWN! playlist a bit this past week and this is one of the songs that most often play when I do that, which led it to grow on me a liiiiiittle bit. I guess it CAN be enjoyable in the absurdism of the lyrics and delivery, but I think people might have taken it a too seriously. I'm to blame too, and I don't fault anyone in not find enjoyment in this, but the way Lisa rhymes Lisa with Lisa... yeah, that was post-camp good if you think about it...

---

# Know what BLACKPINK means when they say "get the bag, get the cream"


**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): objectively this song is probably one of the worst songs in the rate but I find it extremely hilarious so it gets my 11

**LesApfels** (11): This song is an addiction. I've been absolutely obsessed since the day it came out.

**Roxieloxie** (11): i hate this song so much its one of my favorite things ive discovered in 2020 I dont know how to explain it but yeah

**agentofscranton** (10): this would've been a sub 5 score pre-gp999 dance performance - that performance opened my third eye to this song

**Awkward\_King** (10): keep stealing my flatmates ice cream but its so good i just KNOW they puttin cum in that shit

**bespectacIed** (10): people who hate this are just miserable, sorry. This is lighthearted sugary raunchy pop, it's not that serious!!! Will always be an apologist for this, i love the clunky and corny lyrics lool mona lisa kinda lisa needs an icecream man that treats ha = shakespearean

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Songs about ice cream are always good I’m sorry but that’s just a law of nature

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CoSupjZVYAATGt9.jpg

**prada** (10): MONA LISA KINDA LISA NEEDS AN ICE CREAM MAN THAT TREATS HER!

**Round\_Log401** (10): I'm constantly reading that this song is a skip for so many but I love it SO MUCH! Maybe bc I was craving a sweeter side from BP again. But you honestly shouldn't let the sweet sound fool you.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i'm doing this rate solely to give this song a 10 and hopefully raise it's average by .3. it's funny bc everyone i know irl thinks this song is a cute, fun bop and everyone online seems to hate it but i LOVE IT

**thegirlin512** (10): I don't get the hate this song gets, tbh. Again, catchy. It's basically the definition of bubblegum pop. I love Lisa and Selena on this. I didn't expect those two to go together so well but they did. It does really sound out of place on their album though and I've never been able to get over that.

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes this song blows. These are some of their worst lyrics (Moses? wtf?), the rap is awful, and the whole song being built around a metaphor about ice cream being vaguely sexual is uh weird. Nevertheless, it's catchy and you know what? Sometimes I need a laugh and this song is hilarious. This is the meaning of post-good.

**pig-serpent** (9): Some of you have never been eaten out by a scary clown in a 6 Flags Fright Fest Dippin' Dots stand and it shows.

**runaway3212** (9): yassss

**-chilazon-** (8.5): So funnnn! Love this song, but some of the lyrics are just a bit too on the nose for me. I especially love Jisoo's parts and Lisa's iconic rap.

**akanewasright** (8): fuck me why do I like this

**astrologicalangel** (8): yes I have bad taste I know

**becca** (8): Only because of Lisa’s rap at the end!

**metanoira** (8): im sorry that you're all DEAF

**throwaway-7650** (8): one of the most disappointing comebacks ever [2]

**2dina3dworld** (7.8): can I justify my score for this as “camp” and move on?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Ariana song writing coming through 😍

**yatcho** (7.6): This is really cute for the most part, I just wish there was a little more energy. Selena is great in this though and she kills the MV too (even though shes obviously NOT on set with BP)

**celladonn** (7.5): Absolutely fucking godawful

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): #selenafirstwin

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): something something post-good

**imasalesman** (7.5): Kim Dayeon ate

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): Selena absolutely succeeded in making a better food-themed song than her ex, ignore that the bar was super low

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It just depends on the day how much I enjoy this. Sometimes it’s post-good. Sometimes it’s present-bad.

**BooksAndWhisky** (7): Kidz Bop Ariana Grande teas

**hunnybee12** (7): overhated TBH

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (7): it’s actually embarrassing how disappointing this song is considering the artists. I almost gave it an 5 but gp999’s version actually made it entertaining

**slimboyfriend** (7): Here, Selena Gomez demonstrates the Law of Conservation of Energy: her presence neither adds nor detracts from this song; she simply exists.

**bulforster** (6.8): Selena basically plays the straight man for me here, she makes the stuff that makes me hate the other blackpink songs hilarious in comparison.

**anagalisgv** (6.5): :/

**bigbigbee** (6.5): The "blaccents" in K-pop are often very bad but this song is a new level. Honestly, I think this is catchy though, especially Selena’s parts

**notarobot3675** (6.5): its not an amazing song but it gets extra point for being something slightly different for them lmao

**whoisValensi** (6.5): ................fuckthissongforbeingcatchy. It's not even GOOD... I think. But also WOW you sure can tell that one part was written by Ariana cause that 100% was supposed to be a round of "yuh"s.

**-mczrv-** (6): chillin like a villain yea ra ra RA

**billie\_\_** (6): i actually like this more than i usually like bp lmao it's objectively really annoying but that's better than boring.

**chancehugs** (6): I hated this song at first. It has since grown a little onto me and now I tolerate it.

**ChickyDipper** (6): I'm convinced that including this was a sabotage attempt on Blackpink's overall score lmao

**Cooler\_lin** (6): boring but i enjoyed lisa's verse entirely too much, also it reminds me of summer so...

**cuttackone** (6): i just wished i knew what she ment when she said she was good with the cream

**GREY** (6): literally only giving this a six cause of the meltdowns on twitter when it got revealed this was a selpink collab and not aripink LOLOLOLOL

**KoolFunk** (6): this is better

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): don't get me wrong I  love Ariana, but you can really tell that she worked on this and I do not mean that in a good way 😭 this does get a few points purely because I think some of the lyrics are really funny. Play the part like Moses gets me everytime

**sabooyah** (6): This came out a year too early. If this had come out summer 2021 it would have blended in perfectly with all the lowkey chill summer tracks that were popular instead of clashing with all the retro disco 2020 summer songs.

**savemeaseat143** (6): at least we got lavender haired Rosé...

**skargardin** (6): I was going to give this a 1 but then I listened to it again and.. it kind of hit?

**superr\_rad** (6): I know this will get dragged better by other comments but this song is just a mess. I kind of liked it on first listen but I didn’t return to it as much as their other songs from The Album. Selena also doesn’t add anything to the song, I wish her lines went to Jisoo instead.

=====

ggsmackdown: **ivyleaf33** (5.5): bops a bit but also what even was this

**ke1per** (5.5): lyrics are nonsense but it's fun as hell

**mimins** (5.5): not a big fan of the chill summer song but its aight

**pleasegivemeasword** (5.5): I'm sorry Selena

**rikarikachan** (5.5): ok, i kinda liked this when it came out. it kinda sucks but it also kinda bops. Yes, I'm rating it higher than KTL and HYLT.

# Raters kinda Haters

**Alumineous** (5): I don't even know why I dislike this. The song is just kinda stupid...? But all the girls look so good in the MV and the animals look happy so there's that.

**anothertown** (5): The fridge.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (5): it’s cute but like ???? why ???? was this necessary ???

**mengzhongmeng** (5): it's fine, it's pretty cute but the lyrics... the ice is not in the fridge selena!!!

**moooo566** (5): everyone in this video is trying so hard to be sexy and they're just not managing it. also the song isnt very good.

**RaphaelArthur** (5): extremely disappointing collaboration, boring, repetitive and a bit dissonant but blackpink and selena vocals save it

**rubbie** (5): 'Ice-Cream' by Hyuna is much better.

**Stryxen** (5): …it’s good if you were expecting it to be bad

**waluigiest** (5): “catch me in the fridge right where the ice be” every score from 0 to 11 flashed before my eyes

**babadork** (4.2): I do actually like how Selena Gomez’ voice fits in, but it would be better if the song was good.

**MimisChoice9763** (4.2): Too one note for me

**1998tweety** (4): I vividly remember the day this came out. I'm not the biggest BP or Selena fan but I do enjoy a fair bit of their music so I was anticipating this song a fair bit. Some drama in my life the night it dropped so I was already in a somewhat sour mood and was really looking forward to a serve, and....I did not get that. The song feels very half-baked and some parts (especially the 2nd verse) feel very lazy. I will say though that I actually kinda lived for just how sexual this song is. Like there are several lyrics alluding to sucking cock and guzzling cum (I also theorize "play the part like Moses" having to do with sex while she's on her period, and for "double-dip" there's like 4 different things that come to mind), which might be a bit jarring, but ANYWAYS the song was a bit disappointed even though its has grown on me a little bit.

**anzunagi** (4): what COULD HAVE BEEN. I'm so mad this song is so mediocre

**bluetriangles04** (4): My mom literally forces me to play the "Ice Cream Chillin' song with that girl who was in the Wizards of Waverly Place" every time I drive her anywhere. Pain aside, the song has grown on me like an odd fungus and I can find some areas of redemption even in the festering sea of obviously Ariana written lines that don't really fit the BLACKPINK girlies such as "Get it, flip it, scoop it, do it like that, ah yeah ah yeah" (replace the yeahs with yuhs)

**CrimsonROSET** (4): do you think selena using that fabric to tie her hair is what inspired her to do the spanish album

**glitter408** (4): i like the performance on girls planet tho LOL

**lady\_sable** (4): sour candy outsold

**pornypete** (4): Don't think there's a single kpop/western collab that's hit me tbh.

**rotating3Dtext** (4): haha

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): its so weird to me that of all the blackpink songs this is the one that’s considered the weakest. i mean its not a good song by any means either but at the very least i can tell it apart from all their other work

**Victerade** (4): no

**welcome2thejam** (4): Everytime I hear that final slo-mo "iiiice crrream" I'm reminded of that Mary Kate & Ashley slowed down "put it on the pizza" youtube meme

**toyletpauper** (3.5): Boring song that I tried so hard to like.

**sage** (3.3): i used to defend this song because its really not that bad but their singing is so bad omfgggg

**frogaranaman** (3): I still hear "you can gobble dick 'cause you know you love me" in the chorus

**JohnnyToby** (3): the way the girls planet version is better than this, ty dayeon and ruan

**SatC1** (3): selena Gomez stole the show

**SFbby** (3): Terrible but also absolutely catchy, and prompts me to involuntarily say ice cream chillin chillin when getting ice cream

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Did they put the ice right next to the Lali Salami?

**DefaultPophead** (2.5): I really like this song but that Lisa rap is the worst thing I've ever heard.

**Flippantry** (2.5): Knocked off half a point for Selena Gomez's factually incorrect lyrics, ice is not found in the fridge

**Zypker125** (2.2): I've listened to the Girls Planet 999 version a lot more than the OG version. I'm sure r/popheads loves Selena Gomez, amirite

**dlong56655** (2): Ariana wrote this as a prank to Selena I swear

**Gonza\_90** (2): No thanks

**notallslendermen** (2): The only decent part of this song is Lisa's rap

#Now the 1s section 

**DaBigBoi** (1.5): I just find it ironic that people were shading her at the time. You don’t need a good voice to make a good song either. Selena ate the girls up, I’m sorry. (Pun intended)

**apatel27** (1): Acting sexy doesn't work if you use the same pick up lines as pre teens

**bookthieving** (1): i once tried cucumber ice cream and it was simultaneously bland and deeply unpleasant

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (1): The thing I really dislike about Ice Cream is that the group’s attempt to be cute and sexy at the same time feels so grating and jarring that does not fit well for Blackpink. It’s like the girls including Selena are trying so hard to sing this song like how Ariana Grande intended, almost feels like this song is a literal Ariana reject. The only saving grace of this song was Lisa’s second verse and nothing else. And oh, Jisoo not having enough lines in this song is a fucking crime.

**ebooks#5454** (1): god who is this even for

**flavasavavandal** (1): post good is just another way of saying not good

**hikkaru** (1): everyone thinking this was aripink and then being devastated when it was revealed to be SELPINK it was hilarious omfg

**huntyphobic** (1): This is super terrible, another mish-mash; awkward combination of sexy and cutesy, I hate this a lot. The voices don’t compliment each other at all.

**Nixon4Prez** (1): why?????

**plastichaxan** (1): i tried to enjoy this in a camp way i really did

**reiichitanaka** (1): I'm not giving it a 0 because it's not completely unlistenable, but let's be honest even their charisma can't save it

**sarcasticsobs** (1): rosé, sweetie, i’m so sorry

**seanderlust** (1): okay i want to note at this point in my ballot that i am really actively trying to like BLACKPINK. their collab with gaga was very good and i remember liking some of their songs. none of them are in this ballot so far

**terrencelovescum** (1): the lyrics...they're not serious. they're not serious. they're not serious. squints at the songwriting credits and seeing ariana and victoria monet and squints harder. they got set up, your honor!


# And the 0s section

**2l82bstr8** (0): it's the 2nd worst song ever recorded. Bebe Rexha has the 1st and 3rd and has composed for Selena Gomez before so I'll just pin this on her

**alwayswords** (0): selena ate the pinks up

**anarkyah** (0): I already don’t like the rest of their songs by that much, but I feel this one is them at their true worst.

**BasedButta** (0): goddamn you for making me listen to this again god i mean its so bad have you ever paid attention to the instrumental i feel like im gonna go crazy

**brokebutter** (0): horrid

**cherryices** (0): sounds like it’s running on 10% battery

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (0): I can't believe my rating but she rhymed Lisa with Lisa

**cremeebrulee** (0): get the bag get the creme(’s 0)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): This song is very empty-sounding and annoying. Even the looping instrumental is annoying.

**DraculaWeekend** (0): The crossover we didn't need

**en#8502** (0): fuck this song

**intheaftermath** (0): there is SO much wrong with this song... why the incessant AAVE? Why does Selena almost sound like she's in another room? Who the heck cleared this instrumental? I know The Album is already too short but it could've cut these 3 minutes. Stream The Moonies cover instead <3

**milkywayinradius** (0): wow i got whiplash going from something like How You Like That to this... i don't think selena was needed in this boring song.

**note\_2\_self** (0): No

**nt96** (0): I'm lactose intolerant Salina, fuck off

**PSSST12** (0): I'm sorry, i liked almost all of blackpinks TT's on the first listen but this is just simply ASS.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): this song was so embarrassing Selena stopping releasing english songs

**RReg29** (0): A genuine travesty they were forced to do this It G Ma level garbage

**rslashpoopheads** (0): Okay actually this is even worse than HYLT LMAO.

**SkylarV** (0): Wasn't sure if I'd use my 0 or not, but this song, man... I like k-pop because songs like this one practically don't exist at all in the genre, it's just so far removed from what k-pop is in my mind, it's an affront to what makes k-pop great

**thedoctordances1940** (0): Yeah there's just nothing good about this, it feels so lazy, the beat is one of the most irritating sounds i've ever heard, the lyrics suck and they just don't sound like they care, which is something i can't say about their laughably bad stuff at least

**TiltControls** (0): people weren't kidding about this being rough

**ulalka** (0): Awful lyrics weird vocals unfair line distribution unnecessary collab

**wy#0101** (0): suddenly i'm lactose intolerant...

**xedophobic** (0): die

**you2009** (0): I scream U scream I scream U scream I scream U scream I scream U scr-

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): I remember when this first came out I literally hated it and told all my friends what a bad song this was, and then not even 2 hours later I ended up looping it and it was in my top 5 for Spotify Wrapped 2019 so yeah…I don’t love it as much now but I think this is a classic BP song, so your enjoyment of it will probably directly correlate with whether you’re a general BLACKPINK enjoyer. Also I will die on the hill that this is much better than Ddu-Du Ddu-Du.

**wavingwolves** (6.9): OVERHATED! This song grew on me initially because of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF67YTK2whA) Brazilian brega remix and then because it feels like a redone of [Blind Bling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUFw8wTzF_I) by iKON, which I enjoy a lot, not even in a ironic way. People seem to hate the horns, but they remind me a lot of Brazilian funk from the 00s which is super nostalgic, since it was one of the most important genres of music for me growing up. It reminds me of the kind of music that made me love music and for that I find it at least a tiny bit special, even if it's clearly not everyone's cup of tea.

---

# Horny people (fan of horns)

**-chilazon-** (10): PERFECTION! Probably my favorite Blackpink track. Especially love the "We all commit to love" part. Blackpink is so good at combining badass vibes with sincere vulnerability.

**babadork** (10): It might be because I first got interested in kpop with YG groups back in the early 2010’s, but this is close to being my Platonic ideal of a kpop song.

**becca** (10): SLAY THIS LOVE! The jenlisa part in this remains superior

**GapeCod** (10): NOUGAT YOU ARE

**Round\_Log401** (10): Can't lie on the first listen I was underwhelmed by the drop & chorus. Kept growing on me & became one of my fave BP songs. The styling is stunning.

**rubbie** (10): Banger that almost single-handedly made me fall in love with kpop again.

**thegirlin512** (10): Love the MV, love the song, and I love everybody's parts. Quintessential Blackpink song, even if Rose needs to practice better road safety. Wear your seatbelts, everybody!

**RaphaelArthur** (9.5): genius song, great vocals

**whoisValensi** (9.5): Is it Ddu 4x repeated in a new way once more? Yes. Do I really give a shit? No. Do I have over 100 plays of this? Yeah yeah yeah yeah... Tho I will say I've never quite liked how fast it seems to get to the outro and how fast that goes. But it's a still banger so...

**Zypker125** (9.1): Straight banger and one of BP's best title tracks, the fact that this is one of the most divisive ones will never cease to amaze me.

**bespectacIed** (9): Yeah it's generic and grating but man this was a collosal moment in kpop, no one can lie. The horns are iconic. Their Coachella rock  arrangement is the stuff that makes legendary performers

**bluetriangles04** (9): This era brought us Jennie dressed as Lara Croft and DKWTD; after utterly stockholming this song, I have to say it holds up even today as a solid title in BLACKPINK's discography.

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (9): underrated

**intheaftermath** (9): I love this outro so much it's unreal

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9): this was the first k-pop dance I learned so it holds a special place in my heart. The trumpets will always be iconic

**PSSST12** (9): Not gonna lie this was a 10 for me upon debut but it sorta aged for me so I'll deduct one point

**rslashpoopheads** (9): The best of the DDDD trilogy and I am battle hardened and prepared to fight anyone who thinks otherwise and when this goes out Day 1 the only people you'll be embarrassing are yourselves!

**skargardin** (9): One of their best titles I fear

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): this is the worst thing I’ve ever heard (affectionate)

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I love the horns. I don’t always like the “Blackpink sound” that they’ve used since DDDD but this is the best version of it for me.

**celladonn** (8.5): I think I've just heard this so many times that I've forced myself to like it

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): it’s camp

**lady\_sable** (8.5): forcibly reminded that we're still waiting on jisoo solo 💔

**MToms** (8.5): gateway drug into kpop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): k-word this love just doesnt have the same effect does it

**ggal2020** (8): the first kpop song I ever saved to my phone <3

**Jhe116** (8): Could be a 10 but it just never lands with that chorus, the ending is so good like it’s such a waste opportunity

**mengzhongmeng** (8): those water-sun shots of jisoo are SO gorgeous

**notallslendermen** (8): Always thought this song got too much hate

**reiichitanaka** (8): Probably the last time I enjoyed a BlackPink title track + Jennie's Lara Croft outfit in the MV fits her very well

**sarcasticsobs** (8): rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum, puuuuum. jisoo in the video for the pre-chorus though. another great pre-chorus. ending is also great, except for that like elephant noise going on in the background. also, rosé

**waluigiest** (8): all I can think of is that formerly homophobic child from Kids React

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): like many blackpink songs, the breakdown is the best part

**anagalisgv** (7.5): I wish I could enjoy this more but alas

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): this song unironically sounds like a zoo

**toyletpauper** (7.2): I’d say probably the weakest out of the infamous Blackpink “trilogy” (not counting Pretty Savage), but it still has a very cool outro and still a nice song. However, were these songs (DDDD, KTL, HYLT) worth the year long hiatuses? Absolutely not.

**chancehugs** (7): Technically it's a better song than Ddu-du-Ddu-du, but 4D had such an impact that KTL felt like an imitation.

**Cooler\_lin** (7): there is this high pitch static that i cannot ignore and it was killing my brain cells, i love the prechorus and second verse but it is still one of there weaker titles

**cuttackone** (7): its richard wagner but with 808s

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): I have a mixed relationship with this song. On one hand, Kill This Love is the era that made me a Blink. But at the same time, this feels like a watered-down rehash of DDU-DU-DDU-DU. I would say that the trumpets gave this song some life and the rap verse of Jennie and Lisa are iconic beyond words. But other than that, that’s the nicest thing I can say about this song. Not bad, but not excellent either.

**ivyleaf33** (7): the outro outfits were impeccable

**mimins** (7): I love the outro and prechorus but the rest of the song is average. still enjoyable though

**notarobot3675** (7): obsessed with the pre-chorus

**sabooyah** (7): This is D4 but without the impact. Not the best, but is it possible for BlackPink to release a truly bad song? Nah.

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): its giving marching band

**poemforsmallthings** (6.7): I have to be completely honest. I dislike the chorus as much as the next guy but Jennie's first verse and the prechorus mean so much to me as a person they make it impossible for me to be a hater. Sorry

**BasedButta** (6.5): respectable overall although im not a fan of this kind of chorus which is a shame as the rest is quite good

**milkywayinradius** (6.5): HOT SINGLES IN YOUR AREA

**yatcho** (6.5): the transition from twice to this song was a jumpscare... Look im not a BP anti but their style of 2012 beatdrops got old after their first EP and I just cant believe thats what they keep going for in almost every release. That said this is probably the best version of that BP style song

**Bryoneehhh\_** (6): it used to slay.

**glitter408** (6): not my favotie

**nt96** (6): yuh

**savemeaseat143** (6): this was when I realized we'd never get a song like Whistle again

**superr\_rad** (6): This is probably one of BP’s most average songs. I like Jennie & Lisa’s rap in the second verse and rose & jisoo’s prechoruses but the chorus is so weak. I think this is an issue with a lot of BP songs.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): probably my least favourite blackpink song which is fitting bc it was the most underwhelming era for this. awful chorus. the verses and pre-chorus slap tho.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is my favorite Boombayah

ggsmackdown: # The unaroused (not fan of horns)

**BooksAndWhisky** (5.3): The elephants in the final chorus send so they get funny haha points for that

**MimisChoice9763** (5.3): I like the grand intro and ending but it falls flat inbetween for me

**2l82bstr8** (5): pales in comparison of every other version of their formula. there's no underlying groove to latch onto

**billie\_\_** (5): the last like... 40 seconds of this are a far better song than the rest of it.

**lalafairy18** (5): Never fails to jump scare me when it comes on shuffle

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): absolutely love the intro but the rest of this is pretty underwhelming. And the rapping is iffy at best

**pig-serpent** (5): I love the "Blackpink in your area Songname Loud noises BACKPINK YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH" formula as much as the next person but this song isn't it.

**vayyiqra** (5): After thinking this was the weakest comeback ever, now I think it's ... okay. The chorus is weak, the fake-sounding horns are abrasive, it's not a good song, but it's not as awful as it seemed when it came out.

**-mczrv-** (4.5): a little dramatic but the dance break in the spiked circle?? (name of contraption escapes me) kills

**DefaultPophead** (4.5): It's okay, but extremely disappointing as someone who used to be a fan.

**ke1per** (4.5): the prechorus is fantastic but the bridge kills the love for me

**TiltControls** (4.5): There are some neat parts during the song, but I think just too much of it is just kind of clunky to work properly

**apatel27** (4): guylookinginfridge.gif

**bookthieving** (4): why do these horns sound like a dying elephant

**LesApfels** (4): They really made us wait a whole year for an inferior version of Ddu Du Ddu Du

**rikarikachan** (4): There's good parts of this. It gets points for being better than How You Like That.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): more like kill my ears whats going on with the trumpets in this song

**nctdreamsqd** (3.5): I don’t like the stylistic choices made on the member’s singing for certain lyrics.

**1998tweety** (3): D4 was a smash but this was disappointing. The chorus deflates all energy the song had. The last chorus is HYPE though, we just needed more of that energy.

**agentofscranton** (3): shit! rose and jisoo's pre-chorus saves it from being a 0

**Awkward\_King** (3): this is a bad song i just fucking love the beginning of the chorus and last like minute of it

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): let's kill this song! *shitty synth horns*

**en#8502** (3): kill this song

**GREY** (3): blackpink would be the first group to name a song "slaybak"

**jasannn** (3): not even the jisoo-rose pre-chorus can save this.

**SatC1** (3): this was so boring I wanted to cry

**brokebutter** (2.3): sorry this song annoys me the rum pum pums are especially bad

**sage** (2.3): the high pitch noise is so camp its their harsh noise era

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): This is just…uncomfortable in several ways.

**DaBigBoi** (2): I just find the instrumental very underwhelming. I don’t even mind that it repeats the Teddy/Blackpink formula. It’s better than D4 tho.

**hunnybee12** (2): in retrospect I can't believe this was the song that got me into kpop. this.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): mama this is garbage

**Stryxen** (2): cunty (very smelly cunt)

**terrencelovescum** (2): this would've been kinda cute if it was released in the early 2010s.

**thedoctordances1940** (1.8): i just don't get how blackpink are so popular, I can't take them seriously for the life of me. Their choruses are so often just absolutely abysmal and this is no exception

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): several bad choices were made here

**ebooks#5454** (1): let's kill this rater

**fadedblue09** (1): those poor elephants

**flavasavavandal** (1): I gotta be honest, the song loses some (ok a lot) of that melodrama when all 4 of the girls are singing about the same thing, but the thing that kinda kills this song is just kinda doesn’t care with any of the transitions, like the different sections of the song will just start (the transition from Lisa’s rap to the pre-chorus is particularly egregious, or how the chorus just appears out of nowhere) without any thought of how these sections go together and it feels actively disorientating. And that chorus just sucks, the horns sounded better on Industry Baby. But this is probably the Blackpink song which had the most potential, if more love was put into this, it could’ve been definitely gotten to the anthemic break-up anthem it wanted to be

**frogaranaman** (1): what in the Tom and Jerry trap is the second chorus music video scene

**JohnnyToby** (1): lord there's just no redeeming qualities

# Did anyone ordered yet more 0s for BLACKPINK? 

**akanewasright** (0): I liked one Blackpink song in 2019 so I was really excited for this one to come out and fully Blackpink-pill me. I remember walking across campus to my next class and watching the video, hoping I wouldn’t disconnect from the wifi… unfortunately I was really confused as to why I didn’t like it

**anothertown** (0): this is stinky

**hikkaru** (0): this is so awful and lifeless

**huntyphobic** (0): The way this is actually unlistenable, it’s genuinely impressive. It’s like it was designed in a lab to combine the worst instruments and trends in music together.

**metanoira** (0): this sucks the rest of this mini is so much better

**seanderlust** (0): this manages to be both unremarkable and remarkably bad at the same time. it goes for banger but misses the mark on all fronts. the MIDI horns feel empty, the vibe is just...weird. i'm a little surprised that this one is the track that really put BP on the map tbh

**throwaway-7650** (0): one of the most disappointing comebacks ever

**vaguelycatshaped** (0): I hate this song with a passion I'm not sorry


# Jules, who gave this song their 11 

**runaway3212** (11): Avante Garde, post-good, abrasive masterpiece, music of the future, insanity in song form, Zeus and Poseidon on a collab, bionic, so iconic people forget about it, etc.

# Someone who's life was changed by Jules' words

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Jules called this “post-good” and I think that actually changed my life

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): [Yeah…](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/795406960089497611/943252228347670559/unknown.png)

**wavingwolves** (8.1): Did I despise this on release and thought it sounded just like at least three songs they had already released? Yeah. Did it only grow on me during my time watching [GirlsPlanet999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE_VqSbF11c)? Yeah. But is it a banger? YEAH! There's just something so enjoyable about their performance of this song. I don't think it's the best thing I've ever heard, it's obviously hardly original and even BLACKPINK themselves had already done this before, but none of that really takes away the enjoyment from the song. At least, not anymore.  BLACKPINK struck a formula and they are consistent with it, I think people feel this is a bad thing, but from a certain standpoint it's understandable why it gets done. This works for them, they continue to find success with it, so why change? While they did change it up a bit for their next title with Lovesick Girls, I wouldn't be surprise if their next release went back to the formula once more, especially since it has yet to fail them, and I don't think anyone else should be surprised either.

# Look up to the sky, it's a 10? It's an 8? 


**becca** (10): STILL ONE OF THE BEST SONGS OF 2020 IDGAF?!

**bespectacIed** (10): giving it a 10 cuz the line "look at you, now look at me" is such a gaaaaggg. Like BP knows they birthed a lot of daughters in kpop but they will always be the standard

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Okay yes, I am a Blink that will defend How You Like That. Yes, it sounds similar to DDU-DU-DDU-DU just like how Kill This Love sounds similar to D4. However, what makes this song stand out was its minimalistic trap production that complements Blackpink as a group. Surprisingly, this song is kinda hard to cover for some reason which says a lot about how much Blackpink owned this song. It may not be the best song in their discography but How You Like That defines Blackpink as a group very well.

**GREY** (10): i cant name a better song beginning to end this is an adrenaline rush in mp3 format, it makes me want to slam head first through every building in manhattan, it makes me feel like i could fly through space at any given moment, i ascend everytime it plays

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): I actually didn’t pay attention to this song when it first dropped and I low-key feel like it’s not that good but I really enjoy it

**plastichaxan** (10): i yassed so hard purrr

**PSSST12** (10): THE GIRLS THAT GET IT GET AND THE GIRLS WHO DONT- *gunshots*

**RandomHypnotica** (10): idgaf what anyone says “look up in the sky it’s a bird it’s a plane” is camp af, and that last outro???? ASCENDING!!!

**RaphaelArthur** (10): genius song, insane beat and great vocals

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSS!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the intro is so dramatic and for what? this song is all over the place, I live for the chaos

**thegirlin512** (10): I love this song. Repetitive in parts, but it's just so darn catchy? Perfect exercise song too.

**throwaway-7650** (10): BRING OUT THE BOSS BTCH (stan doja)

**whoisValensi** (10): Ya know what, I'm just gonna expose myself for this one... FUCKING HOW YOU LIKE THAT??? I VERY MUCH LIKE THAT!!!!!! Like WAYYYYYYYY too much like that. Also the uhhh "Plain Jane get hijacked" line lives rent free in my head. This is still my favorite of the singles from 'THE ALBUM'.

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): it's just fun. it gets the groove right, switches up in ways that are interesting and make sense, they're all giving good performances and just sound confident, and the production isn't overpowering this time. it doesn't get everything right but it gets nothing wrong. so far, the best use of their formula

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this song is so dumb but it slaps I’m afraid

**anzunagi** (9): sometimes the teddy formula hits

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I think they’re bullying me…but like in a slay way.

**Cooler\_lin** (9): banger

**cuttackone** (9): it was very overhated! i would be fine if they just re-released this song ad infinite, its just that good

**hikkaru** (9): they finally made something good after dddd and ktl omg

**lady\_sable** (9): lisa did not come to play!!

**milkywayinradius** (9): even though i'm not really a big BP fan, i can't deny that this song is sass.

**mimins** (9): a queen!!!! iconic, graceful, and only speaks the truth!!!

**Round\_Log401** (9): Honestly by the time HYLT got released I was a little sick of BP constantly releasing those hard hitting songs, I was craving something like AIIYL again. In the end it once again was just too good for me to not love.

**rubbie** (9): Teddy recycled his previous beats, tweaked them a bit, the result is another banger. Guess that formula really does work.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): this song is v divisive i feel but i've always enjoyed it. love the last minute, easily the best part

**vayyiqra** (9): Idk why, but I love the drop to this. It's very catchy, a little ~wacky. Good use of repetition.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): okay had i submitted scores at the beginning of voting this wouldve been my 0 but it has CLICKED lately

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): I was reading up on this song and was about to make a comment on how Teddy really must be on autopilot at this point, but then I saw a source describing the hook of this song as “braggadocious”. I hate that. Something about that descriptor seems very “fellow kids”. Can someone at YG please issue a formal apology for that?

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): funny thing about HYLT is that I HATED this song upon release. BLACKPINK would go on to release Ice Cream which led me to both reconsider my dislike for HYLT and also appreciate this song a lot more than I had before.

**sage** (8.2): why is their singing so bad i cant

**chancehugs** (8): I'm a hypocrite because I said KTL is an imitation of 4D and this song also felt like an imitation of the former 2. But the final breakdown of HYLT absolutely slaps. Ajayll's reaction of that part lives forever rent-free in my head.

**ChickyDipper** (8): The bridge is great and saves a kind ofdisappointing chorus

**jasannn** (8): Although it’s more derivative than KTL, its simplicity works and I find this more fun.

**ke1per** (8): this would be a perfect ten if not for that outro

**sabooyah** (8): Legendary, fun, culture shift, icons, beauty, fame, fortune, humility, pride, banger, bop, hate her cuz u aint her type track.

**skargardin** (8): the beat drop is actually so flavourful..

**superr\_rad** (8): this is a grower! Maybe because “look at you, now look at me” is so iconic you can’t ignore it

**waluigiest** (8): I’m obsessed with how it’s not cohesive at all

**LesApfels** (7.5): Enjoyably deranged. I started unironically enjoying it after making a video where a guy falls off a mechanical bull with the chorus playing in the background

**toyletpauper** (7.3): I really like the general vibe of verses, and probably has my favorite pre chorus of the Blackpink trilogy.

**brokebutter** (7): was obsessed with this song for a week when i was first getting into kpop

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): whats kpops obsession with Hana Dulset who is she anyway

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): Blackpink scores always go down when I listen to the English lyricism in a team full of fluent and native English speakers.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): this wasn’t even the first time they went bada bing bada boom

**JohnnyToby** (6.7): yurina slayed

**Zypker125** (6.7): Everything about this song is amazing, except for the god-awful chorus drop, which pretty much tanked the score for me.

**anagalisgv** (6.5): I still remember the excitement and anticipation of waiting for the music video to come out promptly following by my heart sinking the moment I heard that weak ass beat drop

**BooksAndWhisky** (6.5): Look up in the sky it’s a bird it’s an occasionally fun song to shake my flat ass to

ggsmackdown: 
**mengzhongmeng** (6): the concept teasers for hylt were so amazing, jennies two-toned hair with the blush...? stunning. and then we get another same-looking mv and a same-sounding teddy track

**nt96** (6): Look at me giving this a 6

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): someday oli london is gonna praise lisa on twitter and i’m just not ready for that day

**slimboyfriend** (6): is this not just the last song but slightly worse

# Oh, it might actually be some 5s and 3s

**Bryoneehhh\_** (5.5): i literally forgot how this sounded for a minute

**-chilazon-** (5): I really WANT to like this song. It's got so many good moments, so many parts I genuinely love. But I can't STAND the chorus. I've heard it described quite accurately as the sound of a transformer farting.

**agentofscranton** (5): xia yan from gp999 totally ate lisa up on this btw

**akanewasright** (5): This is also Not Good… but at least I understand the appeal

**Awkward\_King** (5): for some reason this plays before every fucking youtube video i listen to but its a good song i just hate it

**bigbigbee** (5): Stop yelling at me, I’m just trying to eat my dry cereal

**DaBigBoi** (5): I remember being unamused by this song. It’s just what you’d expect. I don’t like it.

**ivyleaf33** (4.5): it was impossible to escape this song when it came out omg, i think it's permanently embedded in my brain

**MimisChoice9763** (4.5): I just don't vibe with this musical side of theirs

**astrologicalangel** (4): I'm so sorry blinks pls don't come for me

**billie\_\_** (4): i'm sorry i'm tired.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): I really dislike the line “look at you now look at me”. It all sounds so forced.

**DefaultPophead** (4): The song almost makes me feel like a badass, but that wanes quickly and I just get sick of listening to it.

**ebooks#5454** (4): i remember when this first dropped and i just started hysterically laughing

**LilacDaffodils** (4): when I listened to this song my first thought was "I didn't realize kill this love was this long" so take that how you will

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): it's genuinely astonishing how dated this song sounds

**notallslendermen** (4): The autotuned farts ruin it for me, sorry

**welcome2thejam** (4): Oof, I'm definitely not feeling that chorus drop. Shame cause it actually does work for me once they spice it up for the outro

**thedoctordances1940** (3.4): yeah it's not a good sign when a chorus is so bad it makes me just start laughing, but it also does have some good parts so i'm gonna spare it the 1 i originally gave it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): yeah this really is just a less bad version of kill this love

**BasedButta** (3): roses parts save this from an even lower score

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I’m sorry all I can think about is that video where BLACKPINK are working at McDonalds

**apatel27** (2): This is a 2020 song...

**cherryices** (2): actually this is kind of a sister song to bang bang bang i think

**huntyphobic** (2): Sounds super bad and miss-mashed, is hard to listen to but has a few redeeming qualities. I fully believe if any other gg made releases like this they would get dragged.

**KoolFunk** (2): D4 is probably my least favorite blackpink song and they actually went and made it a trilogy.

**Nixon4Prez** (2): Like KTL but without any of the good parts

**yatcho** (2): This is barely a song

**terrencelovescum** (1.5): here we go again. same old shit. nothing new.

**bulforster** (1): the outro made a single (1) point.

**frogaranaman** (1): this song singlehandedly put me off from kpop for a year

**rslashpoopheads** (1): The worst of the DDDD trilogy, the worst of BP's discography, the worst release of 2020 and one of the worst of kpop.

**SatC1** (1): I'm sorry that chorus is horrible

**seanderlust** (1): I think this is supposed to be empowering, which makes the choice to have a multimillionaire saying "look at you, now look at me" feel really off

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): what an absolutely ugly sounding song

# Hey, did anyone ask for yet more BLACKPINK 0s? Here they are! 

**1998tweety** (0): I'm not even gonna bother typing an essay about this cause I'm sure everyone else has me covered. It's kinda annoying how some of y'all will gag over this mediocrity while passing over so much amazing kpop. This is less targeted to people actually doing this rate but I so often with people who are new to kpop and only listen to BP and BTS' recent output which are both painfully mediocre. I'm not saying that you need to go out and explore the whole genre and listen to everything to find out what you like most, but it is somewhat annoying as someone who loves the genre to constantly see mediocre to straight-up bad songs grab all the success and headlines that should be going to out acts.

**flavasavavandal** (0): Worst song in the rate by a wide margin. Worst Blackpink song in the rate from first listen. And that was an easy choice, see Kill This Love, Ice Cream and Lovesick Girls announced themselves as not good from the first few seconds, HYLT tried to trick me into liking this from the first verse with that exhausted weary feeling only to sweep that off the table in record fashion with that guiro-like instrument signalling the start of that appalling chorus. Where the song transform from post-breakup to anti-hater

**ImADudeDuh** (0): mawma… this. is. garbage.

**Jhe116** (0): It is so bad, I want to give it a zero, and that’s possible, so I give it a zero

**rikarikachan** (0): The first time I heard this, I thought I was about to be converted from BP hater to BP stan - for about 30 seconds, and then the drop hits. The amazing first verse makes the shitty recycled Teddy drop so much worse. It's more like a 2 or a 3, but I'm giving it my zero out of pure spite. How dare this song make me believe it was gonna be great.

**Roxieloxie** (0): this is kinda horrid

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): The fact that Ari tried to rehash a lead single once and failed so spectacularly she had to revamp her whole era, meanwhile our friends the Pinks are on their, what, 4th iteration of Boombayah, and they’re the new future of the K-Pop industry? badabingbadaboom

# People who were polite enough to answer the question asked  

**pig-serpent** (8): I like it a good bit actually, thanks for asking.

**-mczrv-** (7.5): apparently quite a bit!

**Stryxen** (6): IDGAF

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i don’t

**dlong56655** (4.5): I don't like it very much tbh

**TiltControls** (4): I don't

**sarcasticsobs** (3.8): i don’t like that! i *will* not talk about lisa’s rap! the girls look amazing again, though (*cough* jisoo in red *cough*). still don’t get the one second clip of rosé putting on a ski mask that is never referenced again in the video. similar to “kill this love”, the ending is probably my favorite part

**celladonn** (3): I don't!

**en#8502** (3): thanks for asking, i definitely did not like that

**wavingwolves** (4.2): Their worst title by miles, a song I highly dislike even if I can't find it in me to fully hate it, but we thought it deserved a chance to be here just for being different from every single thing they ever released and for still finding its fair share of success. I genuinely can't think of a worse trend to ever strike upon the K-Pop industry than Tropical House. I can think of maybe two songs of this genre I enjoy, and for years groups tried its own version of it and we had to sit through the tragedy every time. The only time I suffered MORE from a Tropical House song getting to one of my favourite groups was when TXT released [We Lost The Summer](https://youtu.be/kwy0nR1_SBQ), an atrocious song penned by none other than Charli XCX. In any case, FEVER SEASON, the mini this song features in, has some of their best b-sides and I really recommend the full listen even if you disliked this too.

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): Thank God this era of tropical house in K-pop is over. Fever is for sure one of the worst songs we got out of that time, which is saying a lot considering the abundance of material.

---


# This is correct, actually 

**GREY** (10): this audio experience is pretty unpleasant but it has the gfriend midas touch so that instantly made this timeless and a 10 you either get it or you dont and if you dont get it thats on you


# Stream [DONGKIZ - Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABFlF4OznK0)

**seanderlust** (10): yeah i'm with lil uzi vert on this one GFRIEND goes off

**-chilazon-** (9.5): Nice chill summer song! Mix of old and new style Gfriend

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): These girls have such lovely voices, wow. I have the feeling that I could play their whole discography and have so much fun. I'm not going to read about them. The last thing I'd want to know about is if they had any bullying scandals lol let me live in peace.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.5): such a good song. The best vibes

**ggal2020** (9): gfriend’s best song in this rate

**notarobot3675** (8.5): i love the entire mini but the title track was one of the weaker trackers for me

**savemeaseat143** (8.5): I've never heard a bad song with this name

**becca** (8): This song is good yas

**flavasavavandal** (8): It’s a nice song and all but it sounds better suited for the anime rate

**pornypete** (8): tropical edm is hit or miss for me. But OREO are such amazing producers they make it work

**superr\_rad** (8): this definitely came out when tropical house was super trendy, and even though Gfriend hopped on the trend, it still feels like a Gfriend song. This whole mini album is actually really good!!!

**thegirlin512** (8): NGL, I kind of want an instrumental version of this. I love the vibe.

**vayyiqra** (8): Doubt anyone on Popheads knows them but that instrumental break makes me think of Yellow Magic Orchestra (Japanese synthpop band from the 70s, very influential).

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.7): Really picks up in the back half but unfortunately never reaches great heights

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): kinda an awful instrumental but i can't make it not bop

**BasedButta** (7.5): one of the best attempts at tropical house in kpop with a very good pre chorus shame it couldnt be another genre it just kills the mood youknow

**Victerade** (7.5): their weakest title imo, still a slayer but well... yeah

**1998tweety** (7): Shes cute

**2l82bstr8** (7): their sellout era just wasn't very memorable or inspired enough to bring their fans with it. not a bad song but you can almost hear how much better all the elements could've gone together

**Bryoneehhh\_** (7): some may hate it. i think it slays

**ke1per** (7): very unexpected and dynamic

**note\_2\_self** (7): Okay but very late on trop house trend

**RaphaelArthur** (7): amazing vocals but the music is not interesting

**SkylarV** (7): Average song, but I love the leading lines of the chorus

**Tazzachar** (7): I actually increased my score a little bit because this song ended up getting stuck in my head the next day

**throwaway-7650** (7): the teasers slayed so bad... and then there's the full song

**welcome2thejam** (7): The chorus drop sounds like something that would annoy me if I heard it on the radio every so often, but the rest of the chorus is great and there's more than enough fun elements here to make up for it

**whoisValensi** (7): The way I had to go back and listen to this because the first time I listened to this I was interrupted by my dad who thought it was in Chinese and when I corrected him he said "There's not that big a difference between the two." Hate my fucking family wooo! Anyways this bops, but only a lil bit. Not as strong as other offerings I've heard from GFriend.

**rikarikachan** (6.7): Good energy, aggressively 2019. Remember the tropical house trend?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.6): she was fun

**BooksAndWhisky** (6.5): The musical equivalent of really pretty wallpaper

**TiltControls** (6.5): A bit of a weak link out of the GFRIEND tracks imo, but still alright

**Zypker125** (6.2): DONGKIZ, Enhypen, and even JYP all released better songs with the same title.

**apatel27** (6): Wanted their vocals to soar a little more. Feels weirdly restricted

**chancehugs** (6): Sunny Summer was a better summer song.

**Cooler\_lin** (6): also forgettable but slightly more tropical

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (6): apparently this year hit diff these are the same girls wdym

**CrimsonROSET** (6): great vibes beautiful vibes

**cuttackone** (6): solid but never felt the need to revisit

**intheaftermath** (6): the exciting instrumental on Time For The Moon Night uplifted this group so much, but they sound almost bare without a fuller backing track

**mimins** (6): this one and apple had parts I liked but something felt missing

**pig-serpent** (6): An alright upbeat dance number. The drop is fairly memorable but this one isn't doing much to stand out to me.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): generic in all the worst ways… that drop…

**runaway3212** (6): yaa

**sabooyah** (6): Again, good but forgettable.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It's pretty most of the time but ruined by those generic-ass EDM synths

# Stream idk [ENHYPEN - FEVER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7d6Dt17yHk) since I personally dislike this song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): that is a very mid-to-late 2010s drop

**ivyleaf33** (5.5): top 10 anime betrayals when gfriend of all groups jumped on the tropical trend

**2dina3dworld** (5): when this came out I was already really sick of trop pop so I couldn’t get into it, and now the trop pop sound is so dated to me that it’s distracting

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): whatever

**en#8502** (5): this isn't Sunrise... 🤨

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the drop reminds me of 2014-16 trop pop

**imasalesman** (5): the song that killed their careers… rip gfriend

**MimisChoice9763** (5): doesn't do anything for me

**notallslendermen** (5): I'm so glad the tropical house trend is over

**PSSST12** (5): gosh the trop house phase of kpop was unbearable to watch.

**RReg29** (5): The descent into tropical toot toot sounds make this GFriend's "weakest" single but it's still decent enough overall

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): it sounds like one of those generic edm producer x female pop singer collaborations they play on the radio to fill up air time

**vaguelycatshaped** (5): Some parts sound a bit like an anime opening for some reason

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I’m sorry this sounds stock.

**frogaranaman** (4): what in the 2016 trop pop drop

**jasannn** (4): unlike most kpop songs, it gets worse and sounds even more empty as the song goes on

**akanewasright** (3.5): …they sound nice at least?

**DaBigBoi** (3.5): I actually blame Big Hit/HYBE’s acquisition of Source Music for why this horrible song that Buddies themselves hate has so many streams.

**poemforsmallthings** (3.4): Everyone who has ever complained about all their songs sounding the same even though having a signature, distinct sound was obviously working for the group is to blame for this

**DaHumanTorch** (3.3): nothing could've prepared me for how bad the drop would be

**metanoira** (3): this is everything wrong with tropical house

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Okay Fingertip did not deserve the hate it got this deserves it instead.

**terrencelovescum** (3): kinda forgettable. liked the little breath before the bridge.

**sage** (2.8): proof that sometimes you just need to stick to what works and not try new things

**fadedblue09** (2.5): what is with summer comebacks and the way they drain the soul of kpop groups

**anarkyah** (2): This sounds early 2010’s and not in a good way

**prada** (1.5): thanks for poop break again omg

**Awkward\_King** (1): girl what

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Y’ALL DID THIS ONE SO DIRTY!! This is literally the second best RV song here (behind Zimzalabim), it’s just so fun. The memories of walking home from school while having Irene scream into my eardrums at 80% volume <3 Also this is so much better than Bad B0y idc idc

**ricki** (3): [red velvet trying to copy a fifth harmony and getting eaten up by them….](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlkFTxnizyk) i would have disbanded right there

**wavingwolves** (1): I think high notes are sometimes massively overrated in K-Pop. At times I think SM Entertainment needs to take a step back (ha) and ask themselves if they need to include a high note just because their singers can deliver. They got Irene screeching throughout this song like nothing else and it's the farthest thing from pleasant. Same thing happens with a few aespa songs, in particular Savage, but that's a comment for a possible 2021 K-Pop Singles Rate. Anyway, every time I listen to this I'm just baffled by the fact it left the studio at all. You already had Bad Boy, was it there a necessity to try to pull this mess off? It also probably features my least favourite chorus of the entire rate. Wait, no, that might be yet another Red Velvet song...

# [This RBB](http://beccasafan.github.io/rbb/content/media//tweets/2016/01/tweet-41//tweet.jpg)

**-chilazon-** (10): Omigod Wendy is such a powerful vocalist with those whistle notes! All of them fully deliver here

**akanewasright** (10): EEEEEEEEEEEE

**becca** (10): no need for an explanation im a reveluv

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): camp classic and one of the greatest bridges in the last 5 years

**DaHumanTorch** (10): irene ending mariah and ari omfg

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Instant 10 for those whistle notes tbh

**PSSST12** (10): this is always ragged on as one of red velvet's worst songs but its kinda fun? The girls that get it get it I guess.

**sage** (10): THEY ATE THIS SO BAD OMFG the bridge is so amaze

**bluetriangles04** (9.9): .1 docked off for the pain my ear drums feel whenever Irene blood-curdlingly screams, even though its interesting for sure. The bridge of this song and the breakdown before the last chorus are what really makes this song amazing for me.

**BooksAndWhisky** (9.5): The Simone Biles of vocals

**Alumineous** (9): There is a DOLPHIN in this group.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9): i will not stand the slander of this song!

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (9): love the concept and sound omg

**CrimsonROSET** (9): halsey when she first saw g-eazy

**flavasavavandal** (9): This was the first song in the playlist where I was like, wait wtf maybe kpop good actually but Red Velvet whispering just sends shivers down my spine (complimentary)

**lady\_sable** (9): these vocals holy shit

**mengzhongmeng** (9): I'm a huge fan of spooky/halloween concepts and this is really cute. the mv is literally two sets and a puppet but the girls are serving so I'm not too concerned

**rslashpoopheads** (9): IDK why everyone hates this because it absolutely slaps. Riffphobes begone!

**runaway3212** (9): Yass

**Victerade** (9): same as power up! it might be cheesy but who cares i love their vocals at this one a very fun song once again

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): he’s really really really really really really bad boy

**savemeaseat143** (8.6): I wasn't a huge fan of this song when it came out but it's grown on me a lot.

**BasedButta** (8.5): funny song but it works its good

**ggal2020** (8.5): it’s giving

**milkywayinradius** (8.5): wow that bridge and those 3 whistle notes

**-mczrv-** (8): because it went there and delivered imho

**1998tweety** (8): My hot take is that this is actually a great song. There are a few changes it could've benefited from like literally being released a few weeks earlier, but I much prefer it over Power Up.

**agentofscranton** (8): this is camp idc

**anothertown** (8): It's only a matter of time until this is on drag race

**AssailantArcturus** (8): and im dead serious

**bespectacIed** (8): Overhated. It is indeed too shouty and all over the place but this has one of their best BRIDGES ever.

**cuttackone** (8): this is just the amount of insanity i want in k-pop

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): I would never listen to this song when I have a headache but I do really like it

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Underrated

**ivyleaf33** (8): velvet concept, but imo this could be a red song

**Kwcty6888** (8): honestly it’s years and I still don’t know how I feel about this song

**notarobot3675** (8): i get why this is not a popular rv song but listen... that bridge.

**poemforsmallthings** (8): Lived in the shadow of both Bad Boy and Power Up and didn't get a single win on music shows but smart people were always on her side

**reiichitanaka** (8): If it weren’t for their incredible vocals, this song just wouldn’t work, but their harmonies alone sell it imo

**RReg29** (8): Vocals in this one are beyond killer

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I was a really bad boy, which is why I'm a girl now

**Stryxen** (8): it took a few listen but wow it’s so camp omg when she screeches eardrums were burst (positive)

**Treecoh** (8): original is far superior

**whoisValensi** (8): Oh is this song ever a grower (seriously it took me like a year and a half to like this one). Also I'm still scared of my neighbours thinking the scream in this song is real so I always play the intro and outro super quietly and then blast it for all the parts in-between lol.

**babadork** (7.8): A lot of this song’s rating might be that I love the screams.

**universemates** (7.7): One of my least favorite RV title tracks but RBB is actually my favorite RV mini-album. Butterflies-So Good-Sassy Me is an amazing 3 tracks run.

**mimins** (7.5): don't tell the reveluvs but I like this one more than bad boy

**xedophobic** (7.5): acoustically confusing and a disappointment from bad boy but "1, 2, 5" is enough for me to give it a 7.5 (in all seriousness it's a good song if you don't think of it as a sequel to bad boy)

**sarcasticsobs** (7.3): bummer that the refrain can’t hold candle to the rest of the song. great bridge.

**SkylarV** (7.3): I never want to listen to this, but its not that bad really, just a bit out there

**bulforster** (7.1): bop!

**2l82bstr8** (7): it's stuff piled on top on more stuff piled on top of some more stuff. but it kinda works. (I love the choreo for this too)

**astrologicalangel** (7): that fucking high note bumped this song up a whole point tbh

**glitter408** (7): theres elements i like but the screaming is too much for me

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why make this when bad boy exists

**jasannn** (7): i was so deep into my reveluv phase i made my non-kpoppie friends watch the mv with me even tho i knew it was a mess

**rubbie** (7): Although I'm not a big fan of the song (that chorus could do some work imo), I have to applaud RV for their impressive versatility

**welcome2thejam** (7): Stop calling me that I'm trying my best

**alwayswords** (6.7): irene please my poor eardrums

**celladonn** (6): I remember seeing someone say that this entire song sounds like the last 30 seconds of an Ariana Grande song and they were so right

**chancehugs** (6): We get it, he was a really bad boy. By the 10th 'Really Bad Boy' I was annoyed with song, and it wasn't even halfway done.

**ChickyDipper** (6): It's the inferior Bad Boy in their discography

**frogaranaman** (6): would totally get dicked down by a werewolf too

**ke1per** (6): somehow reminds me of Alien Ant Farm's 'Smooth Criminal' and I won't be elaborating any further

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): I feel like Fifth Harmony could've absolutely released this in like 2015

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (6): this song is a mess with nice vocals on top

**moonagenightmares** (6): why did sm do this

**nt96** (6): Girl is someone getting murdered in the background?

**RaphaelArthur** (6): not for me but amazing vocals and I love the synthpop fan-remix

**sabooyah** (6): Why was she screaming though? This would have been a 7 without all the screaming.

**SatC1** (6): doesn't live up to bad boy but its not bad

**superr\_rad** (6): I really like this music video but the song is kind of just average, especially for red velvet. Irene’s shriek is super iconic tho!

**useless-sheep** (6): i have to give this song a little credit for actually having good styling… a first for red velvet i fear

**MimisChoice9763** (5.8): it's interesting but those screams in the back kill all of my will to listen to it again

**thedoctordances1940** (5.7): focus but not quite as bad but still not very good

**seanderlust** (5.5): oh my god (whistle tone scream) he's a really bad boy! - me when my cat digs up my plants

**terrencelovescum** (5.5): mariah?! the rest of the song is kinda forgettable.

**yatcho** (5.5): Way too repetitive for me. The whistle scream (???) at the end was camp though

**Zypker125** (5.2): TFW they release this Halloween-centric song at the tail end of November.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): The chorus is pretty flat

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why did they make this title an acronym

**slimboyfriend** (5): I don't want to hear that many "really"s in a song unless I'm listening to Carly Rae Jepsen

**thGnerd** (5): Disappointing

**waluigiest** (5): it’s giving fifth harmony

**DaBigBoi** (4.5): “Oh my god, he’s a really bad boy” - Me when I’m horny

**rotating3Dtext** (4.5): i don’t really know why this song exists

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): this is a fifth harmony song

**Cooler\_lin** (4): truly too much screaming and i thought the sax (?) was annoying but i really liked the prechorus

**en#8502** (4): this song was the prophecy to the high note battles aespa has in every song

**GREY** (4): the wig on mawma im shaking the sis periodd omfg :sob: :rainbow: omfg sis.. shes cracked but thats the slay snatch on periodic table fr like .. im sayin

**pig-serpent** (4): There are a lot of song ideas on here that don't really go well together. I hate the distorted brassy sound, the drum beat doesn't work with the rhythm of the instruments, and there's too much obnoxious vocal gymnastics that don't feel at home in the song. On top of that, everything is too loud, making the song incoherent sensory overload.

**rikarikachan** (4): Oh my god, it's a really bad song. (All right, 1, 2 ...5?)

**Round\_Log401** (4): It's a little all over the place for me. The mv concept is really cool but why at the end of november?

**thegirlin512** (4): NGL, it kind of sounds like somebody was being murdered and/or tortured in the back of the recording studio. Anybody know what was the screaming about?

**TiltControls** (4): on a scale from 1 to 5 reallys - how bad is your boy?

**vayyiqra** (4): One of their worst songs, there are some good ideas but I can't stand the ear-splitting vocals and the chorus is boring. On this mini my favourite song is "Sassy Me" which I think outshines this by a lot.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I have a sneaking suspicion that a K-pop girl group’s definition of “really bad boy” is very different from everyone else’s definition

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): sponges

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3.5): the screams are fun but i find this  cringe

**bigbigbee** (3): Every time ~~Wendy~~ edit: Irene sings a """"""whistle note"""""" in this song my score goes down by 1

**billie\_\_** (3): what did red velvet do to you to get these song picks?

**hunnybee12** (3): remember that christina aguleria and demi lovato collab where they just screamed over each other for 3 minutes

**skargardin** (3): RBS (Really Bad Song)

**vaguelycatshaped** (3): Not a bad song but not for me

**throwaway-7650** (2.2): the screams are unlistenable now #sorry

**lalafairy18** (2): I feel like this song never goes anywhere

**fadedblue09** (1): SM really didn’t learn with The Boys huh

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): this song is SO bad, I was shocked to see people on Discord say that they like it! Normally I try to be more polite about these things but I don’t get it! This is just tuneless noise! I think the thing that stokes the fire of my hatred for it is the English version, being able to actually understand the lyrics puts a huge spotlight on how bare and disjointed the song actually is. Like there are literally only **9** lines in this entire song that aren’t some variation of a repeated “all the girls say” or “he’s a really bad boy.” This is the bottom of the barrel for Red Velvet

**JohnnyToby** (1): now this is just a bad song why wasn't (regular) bad boy here so rude

**apatel27** (0): Why create a song that is just 15 second snippets of every track from Dangerous Women

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): This is significantly more irritating than any of the BLANKPINK songs in this rate tbh.

**bookthieving** (0): rv are so iconic for baiting fans into thinking they were releasing a sequel to bad boy, one of their most acclaimed songs and a huge fan favorite, only to release this mess instead

**DefaultPophead** (0): The whistle at the start really scared me and the song kept getting worse. All the noises they make made me cringe from nausea. I doubled over in pain when they whistled again. By the third whistle, I switched this song to my 0.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (0): SM’s experimental title tracks has always been a mixed bag. At best, these experimental tracks turn out to be iconic like SNSD’s I Got a Boy and aespa’s Savage. At worst, they just sound jarring like NCT 127’s Flute. I am sad to report that RBB is a really really bad song. The production is very chaotic in a not so good way where a group of full great vocalists actually sound annoying here. I really wonder why these people at SM think RBB should be a title track for their biggest girl group. Thankfully, this atrocious title track does not define the rest of the excellence that is the RBB album which I highly recommend people to check out. There’s a reason why bad singles should not automatically determine the quality for the rest of the album!

# :well:

**2dina3dworld** (1): someone pointed out this sounds like Boyz and now I’m fuming because I cannot unhear it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): this is just the kpop version of boyz by jesy nelson

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): I’M SO BAD!!! Clearly some of you agreed with the song’s self-assessment, as this finishes at a very meagre #60. Personally, this is actually my fave LOONA (group) title - I didn’t even care that they went girl crush because this song is such a banger.

**wavingwolves** (1): I constantly think about u/cloudbustingmp3 comment on Cherry Bomb by NCT 127 back during the Boy Group rate that reads "this score (note: it was a 1) is for what this song singlehandedly did to LOONA's title tracks". It even got a [banner](https://i.imgur.com/I7pZ6VK.png) back then and it has lived in my head in the most rent free way possible every single time I have to think about So What in specific, so that's all I'll include here. I just really really really despise this song.

---

# So what? SO GOOD!

**2dina3dworld** (10): Unpopular opinion, this is far better than Why Not. I prefer the instrumental and the hook on this one, it really reminds me of OEC.

**bespectacIed** (10): Oh boy this is gonna be a tough one for me. This was the start of the great orbit exodus lmfao. Yeah this was a rough spot in their discog and I am not defending them... but I will always remember this fondly because the day they got their first music show win was the VERY START of COVID quarantine where I live. That day will always be my timestamp between the pre-COVID and post-COVID world, it makes me emo just thinking about it

**cremeebrulee** (10): SMASH!!!

**Gonza\_90** (10): I love how LOONA woke up and chose violence

**hikkaru** (10): the start of their downfall? maybe but i love this idc

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg this is their love on top

**prada** (10): I’M SO BAD

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSSS

**sage** (10): they ate this so bad maybe we dont want monotree

**thedoctordances1940** (10): this is so bad I fucking love it

**whoisValensi** (10): OH HELL YEAH! Best LOONA title track imo.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.7): got me vibing so hard. Such a good clubbing song. I’m only not giving it a 10 so I don’t seem too biased

**anagalisgv** (9.5): listening to this while working out makes me feel like I can do anything

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9.5): the girls that get it get it and the girls that don’t don’t

**thegirlin512** (9.5): This song makes me want to get up and dance. I love the beat. This is going into regular rotation.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): wtf let’s goooo this *bombastic*

**2l82bstr8** (9): always a tough sell having to come back from exploring new territory to do what everyone else is doing. but absolutely not as bad as your average LOONA stan would have you believe

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): overhated and the BRIDGE!!! yas

**ebooks#5454** (9): you could tell me this was a Stray Kids m/v and i would believe you

**imasalesman** (9): RIP Old Loona :(

**lady\_sable** (9): kim lip fucking owned this era

**plastichaxan** (9): would be a 10 if that intro was with the song omfg i moved

**vayyiqra** (9): Mainly like this because the bass goes hard

**xedophobic** (9): i love overstimulation when done right

**ChickyDipper** (8.8): I still don't understand the hate for this song

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i feel like im being abducted by gay aliens

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): I kept thinking that they were about to yell "Hai Si Ja, Hold tight"

**Victerade** (8.5): i actually like it LMAO they carried their old sound so much better but i dont hate their girl crush sound too the chorus is a lot of fun imo

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I love songs that give me a chance to shout.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): so maybe i will start a war

**CrimsonROSET** (8): stan loona

**JsaKim** (8): IM SO BAD

**lalafairy18** (8): The bridge goes crazy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): how lowkey chaotic this is

**TragicKingdom1** (8): RedOne could've produced this

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): i always hear that second line in the chorus as “i’ve been acting gay, so what??”

**-mczrv-** (7.5): m/v is a literal trip

**ivyleaf33** (7.5): not sure if the concept change suits loona, but the song slaps and that's what matters

**notallslendermen** (7.5): I wasn't a fan of this when it came out because it was so different from their other songs but its grown on me

**yatcho** (7.5): I don't really hate this song as much as most orbits, them going full bad girl was welcome at the time and it's held up pretty good compared to the next releases. This is when it was clear they were starting to run out of ideas though cause those this did not hold up to what those epic teasers were making me expect

**Jhe116** (7.3): Reason no. 1 why we need Jaden Jeong back. He may be difficult to work with but he knows better not to force the girls to rap

**apatel27** (7): Take out the garbage rap parts and this is a good song

**celladonn** (7): This has grown on me, even though it's not really the type of music I want from LOONA and "I'm so bad" annoys me... it bops a little bit

**chancehugs** (7): I still bop to it, but it's a bit too 'shouty' for my liking. Vivi really got paid dust here.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): It’s hard to say whether I like this song or not. I like this song because it’s catchy. But at the same time, I was thinking “Is Loona falling victim to becoming a girl crush group?”. Nonetheless, I’ll give this a generous 7 just because I don’t skip this song when it plays on shuffle

**DraculaWeekend** (7): This song is confusing but I think I like it

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (7): Less so

**Kwcty6888** (7): honestly this song kinda tires me out

**rikarikachan** (7): Eh, it's fine

**skargardin** (7): It's really not as terrible as I remember it being huh

**superr\_rad** (7): realistically, I know this song is a mess. But I love the bridge so much I listen to the whole song just for that part.

**SkylarV** (6.7): Its not that bad, but it doesn't really fit them that well conceptually

**BasedButta** (6.5): i can cope with this

**RaphaelArthur** (6.5): very bold song, great delivery but music on the borderline of noise

**savemeaseat143** (6.5): I am so tired of girl crush

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): its giving charli xcx in her sucker era

**bulforster** (6): the rapping is just so clunky, like why is chuu the only one to get a rap line with any flow

**DaBigBoi** (6): So what? So bad? So good? Honestly it’s just fine-good if anything.

**PSSST12** (6): grating. I dont know what the fuck happened with this group but they fell off hard

**rubbie** (6): Used to think this sounded like Itzy, which I don't quite hear now except perhaps in the production, but I still find the song a bit messy and slightly unfocused.

**welcome2thejam** (6): It's good, but the music video starts with dark imagery as a disembodied voice says "Do not accept the fate of the moon" and that creates a check this song can't cash

**MimisChoice9763** (5.9): some parts work some don't

**BooksAndWhisky** (5.7): When they said “I’m so bad” they were talking about the song. God tier bridge tho

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): this is just aggressive, I kinda want to love it, but at the same it sounds awful

**ke1per** (5.5): quite the departure in sound, prechorus rocks though I wish it went somewhere

**vaguelycatshaped** (5.5): I hated it at first but it's fine actually

ggsmackdown: # The girls said it themselves... it's bad

**Alumineous** (5): A lot is going on in this song and it's just too much.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): BTS and p!nk >>>>

**Cooler\_lin** (5): i literally got whiplash listening to this right after butterfly, its catchy kind of and has a nice bridge but..

**cuttackone** (5): im so sorry darlings but this was not it

**frogaranaman** (5): why do I feel like a lot of kpoppies would have had a dubstep phase in 2012

**pig-serpent** (5): My question every time I try to figure out what the big deal with LOONA is.

**Round\_Log401** (5): Personally don't like this trend of songs sounding more like a lot of different sounds on top of each other than it having an intended direction. It's so overwhelming & it always feels a little random. I get why people who enjoy that like this, not a bad song just not for me.

**agentofscranton** (4.5): whitney chuuston working overtime to salvage loona's company and their title tracks

**brokebutter** (4.2): the bridge is perfect but its not worth listening to the rest of the song to get there

**1998tweety** (4): meh

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): No no no please leave dubstep back in the past where it belongs!!

**-chilazon-** (3): Never liked this song. So aggressive and overwhelming. Why do girls in kpop always have to call themselves "bad"? Just doesn't work. The chorus is kinda catchy, which is the only saving grace for this song.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): "I'm so bad!!!" well...

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Why did Loona just decide to stop releasing good music as soon as they became a group these bitches really don't wanna share their good songs with anyone else.

**terrencelovescum** (2.5): it's like bbc forgot they had 12 people in the group. i hate how much potential they waste from the intro tracks.

**huntyphobic** (2): Didn’t deserve a win, it still haunts me

**akanewasright** (1): is this a song or a series of shrill noises? ~~no really I want a chorus here so bad and yet~~

**anarkyah** (1): I love Loona I really do, but this change in sound really didn’t vibe with me and following Butterfly with this feels offensive honestly

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): The funniest thing about this is that they literally say it’s bad, I can’t get over that

**GREY** (1): i cant believe i was so far up loonas ass at one point i actually convinced myself this song was good LMFAOOO esp after they gave yves that fuck ass bob omfg you arent yeojin it didnt give

**JohnnyToby** (1): they do NOT sell bad like chuu is right there

**hunnybee12** (0): idc how good the bridge is every other second is god awful

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): this song genuinely makes me cringe, which i can’t say about most kpop songs even if they are bad. it sucks even more knowing how good the b-sides are for this mini album, and bbc had to go with the washed up itzy song that reeks of trying to hard to ride the girl crush wave but ultimately sounds as badass as kidz bop

**thGnerd** (0): Loonas worst

**Zypker125** (0): This is truly "Try-hard, the song". This is when LOONA truly started to go downhill by doing pandering girl crush instead of the cinematic songs that made them stood out. "I'm so bad" makes me cringe every time I hear it.


# People complaining about NCT, SM and Lee Soo Man

**throwaway-7650** (7.7): well, this song started the NCT-ficiation of loona I fear

**sabooyah** (5): Lee Soo Man PLEASE save this garbage for NCT.

**bookthieving** (3): this is nct's fault

**SatC1** (3): sold their soul to sm


# People who try to remain positive in the face of tragedy 

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): when this was first released I was like “I’m not sure about this”, but now that PTT exists, this is really good in retrospect.

**en#8502** (8): PTT wishes

**mimins** (5.5): very messy and loud. needed a quieter instrumental during the verses as a down period. I prefer paint the town

**toyletpauper** (2): At this point, LOONA became my favorite group when this was released… The disappointment. At least I like the most of the album unlike ~cough~ PTT/& ~cough~.

**fadedblue09** (1): Yikes. At least PTT had HaSeul

**wavingwolves** (7.2): Full disclosure: I spent YEARS disliking this song. YEARS. But then last year I stumbled upon a compilation clip on twitter of various idols dancing to this and once I heard this song again it kind of hit me in a "why is this bopping now?" way and from then on it simply grew on me. I still don't love it, but I do think it's super fun and I actually really like to follow the choreo along as I listen to the song. And, of course, the fact it gave us [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1PkVf8veuA) Jihyo isn't something I can fault either. That was her shit!!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): I HATE THIS SONG!!! I literally unstanned TWICE when it came out because of how awful I found it. I remember when the MV teasers first started coming out and I was like “hmm…not sure if I’ll like this from these snippets but I’ll be optimistic, I’m sure the full song is better!”. And was it? NO. The verses and prechorus just aren’t good enough for me to ignore the horrendous drop, hence this is my 0. The only saving grace was everyone realising how beautiful Jihyo is…

---

# Horn-y and also summer-y

**2dina3dworld** (10): I got asked out for the first time while listening to this song, so anything less is a crime

**JohnnyToby** (10): I am DANCING

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): it never fails to put me on a good mood

**throwaway-7650** (10): loving the random pterodactyl at the start

**TiltControls** (10): why is this rate starting off so strong. this isn't fair to the rest of the songs!

**toyletpauper** (10): My absolute favorite Twice song. The song is just pure serotonin and always gets you in a cheerful, dancey mood. An 11 contender.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.2): so cute

**bluetriangles04** (9): NAYEON WEARING A FUNERAL OUTFIT AT A BEACH PARTY IS ICONIC

**brokebutter** (9): dahyuns verse is the best of her career

**ebooks#5454** (9): this m/v is how Lord Of The Flies should have gone

**LesApfels** (9): I certainly DO want to have some fun

**pig-serpent** (9): Incredible carefree summer fun! So full of energy but is never overbearing!

**Round\_Log401** (9): summer pop perfection.

**thegirlin512** (9): Cute summer bop. What else is there to say?

**sage** (8.9): SLAY THE BOOTS AWAY

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.8): ok this is so much fun, a straight banger

**-chilazon-** (8.5): I love a good summer bop, but it's standard Twice fare. Doesn't stand out compared to some of their other songs.

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is adorable and it makes me happy but I can’t give it a 10 because I’m not gonna be sad when it leaves JSHDHDB

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): This is so bouncy and fun

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): We stan TWICE’s Coachella moment!

**rikarikachan** (8.5): Peak summer bop

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): this is really cute

**becca** (8): DANCE THE SLAY NIGHT AWAY??? Love this summer smash hit!

**bigbigbee** (8): I don’t like the visual direction TWICE’s MVs took after this. Not all of them are bad but I so prefer the “freshness” of everything up to and including this one. Anyway I really like this song! Love a summer moment

**dlong56655** (8): Jihyo was such a star this era

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I saw this video about how “this video actually has a HORROR concept!” which posited the theory that several of the girls are actually ghosts who caused the wreck that stranded the rest of TWICE on the island and now they’re keeping the girls there hostage and I’m like honey this is barely a horror concept… a horror concept would be if there was like a mad scientist lab on the island and they hooked the girls up to robot limb enhancements that forced them to “dance the night away” against their will and they weren’t discovered until years later, their broken and twisted bodies still being puppeteered by the machines in an endless dance even as they rot and fall apart. So now I think about that every time I hear this song, which is more than I can say for a lot of the songs in this rate.

**runaway3212** (8): yass

**seanderlust** (8): the translation of these lyrics are so cute omg. if it's accurate then this song is adorable! yes TWICE. I will throw a party behind the moon with you.

**Stryxen** (8): this song prevents any thought from happening while it’s playing (in a good way)

**vayyiqra** (8): Definitely fun and has a nice groove.

**Victerade** (8): ages kinda bad but its an ok song fun chorus

**waluigiest** (8): this is corny as hell. Can you play it again?

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): they love a tropical theme huh

**2l82bstr8** (7.5): generally not my favorite of theirs - I really don't like the melody on the verses, and it feels like they're struggling to get it too. but it's fun!

**alwayswords** (7.5): jihyo latina

**anagalisgv** (7.5): it's cute but a little shouty for me

**BooksAndWhisky** (7.5): Hard to go wrong with summer concept Twice

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute and fun but maybe just a bit too cute

**lady\_sable** (7.5): this has never been a huge fave of mine (and listening to it in winter kinda kills the vibe) but still very fun!

**reiichitanaka** (7.5): TWICE I’m not part of the Jihyo cult, but this era made me I understand why it exists.

**apatel27** (7): Shout out Louie Crown

**Bryoneehhh\_** (7): it would be cuter if this rate was done in july of 2018

**celladonn** (7): It's very basic but I won't act like it isn't fun

**CrimsonROSET** (7): well it’s only filmed on daytime so i have questions

**cuttackone** (7): nice but nonessential

**Gonza\_90** (7): omg I love Van Halen

**jasannn** (7): Momo’s voice here haunts me every night

**RaphaelArthur** (7): nice and catchy but too simple

**SatC1** (7): this song is so fun. the choreography is infectious.

**Zypker125** (6.7): The start of when it became clear that JYPE had no idea what to do with Chaeyoung anymore, rip.

**agentofscranton** (6.5): I don't think it's nearly as bad as some people make it out to be - but it's still their worst title track

**babadork** (6.5): I have been trying to think of what song for children this reminds me of since the rate started.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): They can bring the personality and cuteness as always but this chorus is pretty weak.

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): I'm glad they got a vacation out of this mv

**en#8502** (6.5): me when i'm on a desert island

**nctdreamsqd** (6.5): The song is catchy but I wish it had a few more layers of vocals or synths to make it sound fuller.

**notallslendermen** (6.5): One of their weakest title tracks imo, just pretty generic compared to their other songs. The styling in this era was 10/10 though

**savemeaseat143** (6.5): it's fine. not a huge fan of the chorus.

**1998tweety** (6): it's a fine song but kind of underwhelming

**AxymHeart** (6): I think it's the horn sounds that throw me off

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (6): is this the swimsuit episode of kpop hehe

**DefaultPophead** (6): Sounds like a Kero Kero Bonito x Spongebob collab, but a little worse...

**intheaftermath** (6): it's nice, just not as memorable as their other offerings

**ivyleaf33** (6): catchy but twice's "tropical" concepts are never as good imo

**rotating3Dtext** (6): it’s fun but why are they screaming

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Honestly I was a huge DTNA apologist when this came out but it's definitely the worst of the Twice songs here. The song is super catchy but the chanting gets rather grating after a while.

**rubbie** (6): This is a fun, summery bop but doesn't really grab me - apart from the melody that reminds me of Gainsbourg, strangely enough

**SkylarV** (6): A fine song, just doesn't do anything for me

**TragicKingdom1** (6): this is serving cricket wireless commercial

**vaguelycatshaped** (6): It's fine but def not my favourite twice tt

**whoisValensi** (6): Yeah it's been years and this one still doesn't really do it for me. At all... I mean I guess it's cute and summery and all but \*sigh* I'm not feeling it.

**xedophobic** (6): my least fave twice title

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this one sounds like an s club 7 song (im british this is a compliment)

**billie\_\_** (5.5): half of these points are for the jihyo fancams this era gave us.

**frogaranaman** (5): I thought this melody was from Phineas & Ferb

**GREY** (5): cleared boring ass red flavor

**notarobot3675** (5): this might be controversial but this is one of my least favourite twice title tracks - its fun but I do find some of the instrumentals during the chorus to be grating

**thGnerd** (5): Song was super boring in my opinion

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): OH GOD NOT THOSE HORNS 🤢

**yatcho** (5): cute but i have VERY high standards for Twice so these cutesy songs reminiscent of their old style just dont do it for me

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): the instrumental in the chorus is just really irritating, otherwise it is kinda a bop

**Tazzachar** (4.5): This is one of TWICE’s least exciting comebacks imho, bootleg Alcohol-Free

**-mczrv-** (4): dance the night away from this instrumental hehe

**Cooler\_lin** (4): the baby voices sound so dead in the first verse,,,I like the chorus kinda

**ke1per** (4): I appreciate the vibes but the bridge and prechorus really don't do it for me

**mengzhongmeng** (4): my least favorite twice tt... not bad, it just doesn't compare to their other amazing songs

**note\_2\_self** (4): Instrumental chorus no likey

**plastichaxan** (4): this is kinda annoying i don’t like this drop

**skargardin** (4): Not this being WAY worse than I remember it being...

**bulforster** (3.6): offensively mid

**bespectacIed** (3): they wanted to do something fun, something for the summertime, something for the girls to u know, skip

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this seems like a demo of a song that isnt even that good

**KoolFunk** (3): this is their 2nd worst title track

**RandomHypnotica** (3): it’s giving copyright free youtuber intro music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): it sounds like a song that would play as the bgm for a commercial advertising a trip to the bahamas and based on the music video i’m guessing the was the intention? also it has one of those mostly instrumental choruses that i hate the majority of the time

**PSSST12** (2): twice's worst song if more and more doesn't exist

**sabooyah** (2): Contender for the most annoying, completely devoid of joy, feels like im listening to them fake happiness while they stare at me with dead eyes track.

**welcome2thejam** (2): Hits the unfortunate sweet spot of being unremarkable yet annoying. Also, I tried not to let the MVs influence ratings too much, but that zoom-in/zoom-out camerawork in the chorus is the worst, please leave whoever made that decision on that island

**BasedButta** (1): theyre so cute but ugh the song

**fadedblue09** (1): not this zumba song

**terrencelovescum** (1): the production in the chorus is almost as bad as dahyun little part at the end. more and more is light years better than this.

**chancehugs** (0): I never liked this song. I don't understand why people like it. The elephant trumpet chorus is so annoying. Chaeyoung's only lines are the words "Dance The Night Away". Absolute snorefest.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): you know the iconic michelle obama "hey queen" video? the negative "hey flop" edit is how i feel about this song

**mimins** (0): screaming crying throwing up shaking my god this song sucks so bad. just disappointment all around and easily one of the most uninspired things I've ever heard

**MimisChoice9763** (0): This song reminds me of those boring EDMish summer songs that dominated the radios in Europe for like half the 2010s

**moooo566** (0): nothing about this song is in any way good. i can only assume their management forgot they'd promised a release and then all they could find was the reject pile from a disney-channel-style show that got cancelled halfway through the second season. its not even bad in any interesting ways. i rated this 3 last night but i woke up still annoyed and had to go back and change it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): Definitely the weakest out of the MMM songs here. It's not bad at all and I find it very enjoyable, but it has song-for-the-fans energy. Still, it was kinda robbed!

**wavingwolves** (4.4): This isn't completely atrocious, but it's still a little far from being a song I can find it myself to like. I can appreciate the way their music very clearly appeals to a female audience and how this release in particular is all about women having unapologetic fun and I think they're able to pull it off well, MAMAMOO always have been a group full of personality and it does shine here. Despite all that, I still mostly dislike how this sounds.

**-mczrv-** (8): jealous of Wheein’s neon green tracksuit

**anagalisgv** (8): cute!

**astrologicalangel** (8): they did Moonbyul dirty with that pink jumpsuit tbh

**thegirlin512** (8): I'm having a hard time getting over the title, but it's still quite a good song! Not as good as their others.

**Cooler\_lin** (7): super catchy, instrumental is kinda similar to egotistic but i really like the melodies

**mimins** (7): I like this song but I always forget how it goes

**sabooyah** (7): This was fun when it first came out but is surprisingly forgettable.

**superr\_rad** (7): i like this song but i sometimes start singing egotistic when the chorus comes in.. they sound super similar to me lol

**Zypker125** (6.9): My Korean study-abroad host family would constantly play this song, even as their alarm clock, and it kinda sold me on the song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): kinda bland like egotistic but a tad more fun

**Awkward\_King** (6): i love how innapropriately kpop lyrics insert like self love phrases into their songs it truly brightens my day

**cremeebrulee** (6): for the love of god can someone fix that one girl's boot

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): do they mean bebe in the Moira Rose sense or

**PSSST12** (6): ehhhhhh a little bit generic for them

**RaphaelArthur** (6): not very good

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A bit annoying

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): the ella ella ella ella hook has already been done to perfection

**BasedButta** (5.5): catchy respectable chorus

**thedoctordances1940** (5.3): :midaf:


# People in suits and ties? Idk


**akanewasright** (5): This is okay, but also finds the direct mid point between boppy and boring

**bulforster** (5): what akane said

**chancehugs** (5): Something about this song just didn't click with me.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): great gowns, beautiful gowns

**frogaranaman** (5): who the fuck is advertising their house party with that professional of a flier

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This mini-album has some fantastic B-sides but this track has always left me cold

**hunnybee12** (5): shrek soundtrack vibes

**ImADudeDuh** (5): me on the side of a marathon when I see Bebe rexha run past me

**ke1per** (5): strange bridge and weak chorus

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.5): Too many noisy details I dislike in the production. And the adlibs in the verses irritate me

**ivyleaf33** (4.5): it's there, i guess

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): There’s some song this reminds me of…I think it’s by Bebe Rexha. I am not gonna put in the effort to find out.

**welcome2thejam** (4): Legit thought that was gonna be the "woah Kenny" producer tag at the start and was about to be so shocked

**apatel27** (3): bad bollywood movie tie in song vibes

**cuttackone** (3): nah im just not into mamamoo

**fadedblue09** (3): Failed attempt at a semi-cute concept. Wheein's solo from this mini was a slay though.

**GREY** (3): my ex was obsessed with mamamoo, solar was his bias, i bought him blue;s cause it was his fav mini and during the relationship i stockholmed their discog. This isnt related to my gogobebe score i just felt like sharing

**JohnnyToby** (3): not even Reina could save this with her screams

**pig-serpent** (3): So I accidentally added the rock version to my playlist, and I like that one a million times better.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): not a fan srry

**whoisValensi** (3): I snoozed. Seriously what the hell happened to MMM. Starting to think I really lived thru their "Golden Years" not realizing those were the "Golden Years". So that's very fun.

**maskchachki** (2): i hate the tropical-house sound of these mamamoo releases sorry.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): its giving marshmello & anne-marie - friends

**terrencelovescum** (2): the nine slash six part completely ruined the song.

**TiltControls** (2): This isn't working for me in the slightest

**DaBigBoi** (1): People will hate Friends by Marshmello & Anne-Marie and listen to the exact same song in Korean.

**ebooks#5454** (1): i-- no

**sage** (0): they always had the ethnic hip spirit

**slimboyfriend** (0): Somehow every part of this song is grating to me

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): You know what, I actually love this song. Literally after every single ballot we got I would keep checking to see if Dingga had finally moved above Gogobebe. And we got there eventually so I will count this as a personal win!

**wavingwolves** (5): From what I could gather, the word *Dingga* comes from the Korean expression *Dingga Dingga* - which means to something close to "lazily enjoying your free time". This song, just like gogobebe, is a song about people, women in particular I would say, having fun, enjoying their time beyond work and social obligations. It's something that MAMAMOO pulls off well, but sonically it still doesn't really hit home for me fully. I can't say I dislike this this, but I also don't like it either, so... it's a perfect 5 in my book.

# Drink like a like a...

**1998tweety** (10): This is a bop. It's funny cause I remember when this dropped as a pre-release single, a lot of fans weren't vibing with it too much, but after the much more disappointing Aya dropped, fans realized that Dingga is a big bop. I will say though....girls with your past you are playing with FIRE with a song title like that....watch it x.

**cremeebrulee** (10): wtf this is lowkey so fun

**-chilazon-** (9.5): ugh it's so good

**akanewasright** (9.5): “like a like a like a fish” so true mamamoo are flops

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): so tired

**ebooks#5454** (9.5): wait this is like really fun

**notarobot3675** (9.5): i like to have fun

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.3): catchy song but it's missing something

**anagalisgv** (9): this is such a cute pandemic anthem

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): ...like a fish???

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): We stan a quarantine anthem bop, even if the lyrics are kinda all over the place sometimes.

**intheaftermath** (9): do NOT know what is happening with this cover art but I kinda love it

**thegirlin512** (9): Perfectly good song, decently catchy too.

**vayyiqra** (9): this is future funk (don't question this)

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): LIKEALIKEALIKEAFISH! I wish that lyric didn’t exist cause otherwise this is a 10

**-mczrv-** (8.5): like a fish!!

**vaguelycatshaped** (8.5): So playful and catchy I love it

**bulforster** (8.3): Depending on where they live, fish either drink a lot or pee a lot. In the sea, a fish’s body is less salty than its surroundings, so it loses water across its skin and through its gills via osmosis. To stop themselves dehydrating, marine fish drink masses of seawater and produce a trickle of concentrated urine. When migrating fish like trout and salmon move into rivers and lakes, they face the opposite problem and risk absorbing too much water until eventually their cells begin to swell and burst. To avoid this, they switch from being heavy drinkers to plentiful urinators.

**sage** (8.2): literally just watered down hip but it still gives

**ChickyDipper** (8): this song always reminds me of Dumdi Dumdi by (G)I-DLE for some reason

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): only because it's retro and preppy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait a slay perhaps?

**DefaultPophead** (8): This would actually get my lazy ass dancing at a party!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Did you know that there’s no unified term for furries whose fursonas are fish (fishsonas)? Like theoretically it would be “scalies” but that term mostly describes people with reptilian/amphibious fursonas. Thank goodness MAMAMOO wrote them this bop though

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the lyrics chosen to be sung in English kind of send me but this does bop

**RandomHypnotica** (8): the best song in this rate involving ice cream in the lyrics… by far

**runaway3212** (8): Yasss

**superr\_rad** (8): super fun groovy song! I watched a stage of this song where they had the letters of the title move around on the screen behind them and I almost had a heart attack at one point cause it got really close to another word…

**Victerade** (8): same as others

**xedophobic** (8): like a fish(????????)

**savemeaseat143** (7.8): it's a fun song

**jasannn** (7.7): of course i enjoy the retro mmm song the most ctfu

**yatcho** (7.7): why ARE you acting like a fish??

**2l82bstr8** (7.5): it's so weird that a disco-inspired Mamamoo song isn't their best or an 11 candidate but nobody's at their best element here

**throwaway-7650** (7.1): I don't hate it but hope this song flops like a fish tbh

**chancehugs** (7): This song gives me funky fresh vibes. Initially I thought they were singing "like a bitch" in the chorus, and was disappointed to later realise they were singing "like a fish".

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): it's not bad but not too great

**Cooler\_lin** (7): definitely the most different from the others. it felt more like mamamoo's take on an iz*one track and the eatery was terrible

**cuttackone** (7): really liked this one a lot actually, sad the dancebreak aint on spotify

**mimins** (7): its chill its cool its sweet

**pig-serpent** (7): Those little popping noises during the dance breakdown are everything.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): This song is like pure unadulterated essence of Mamamoo.

**sabooyah** (7): Forgettable. Still good I guess.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i enjoyed this

**en#8502** (6.5): this one is just clunky

**ke1per** (6.5): another weird bridge and another fantastic rap

**RaphaelArthur** (6.5): good song and great production but basic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): …drink like a fish?


# ...Like a fish???? 


**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): lemme never type this songs title before i make an unfortunate typo

**Zypker125** (6.2): Dingga deez nuts, hahahahah *Jumps off of cliff*

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is perfectly fine but there’s no real reason to come back to it. It’s like having fish for dinner.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (6): forgettable retro

**Roxieloxie** (6): i want to 0 this for the spelling of this alone

**2dina3dworld** (5): *yawn*

**becca** (5): They fell off.

**DaBigBoi** (5): Bland but not terrible.

**GREY** (5): :kiss: :purse: :cat2:

**PSSST12** (5): mmm's latest releases was just not it for me sadly 😭😭

**Round\_Log401** (5): Kinda underwhelming imo. Nothing new & exciting. It's probably bc the past releases have set the bar so high.

**skargardin** (5): Well.. at least we're not rating AYA

**BooksAndWhisky** (4): I usually love kpop takes on retro but this is so boring and repetitive

**whoisValensi** (4): Well that's some unfortunate Romanization... Especially considering that time they did Blackface for a Concert VCR (Video shown between concert "acts/chapters" in a K-Pop concert.) set to Uptown Funk... While this song may be about having fun, I am not having fun. I think I miss the old MMM too much...

**TiltControls** (3): This song feels a little all over the place and not always in the fun way

**prada** (2): help

**terrencelovescum** (2): drink like a fish? i don't have gills. absolutely not.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): Like a fish?????????????? There’s like no energy in this song at all

**corguri** (0): nothing for magapoo.

**frogaranaman** (0): what the fuck is this

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Kind of like the best song ever actually? I was obsessed with this the moment it came out (and I do enjoy ReVe Festival Day 1 as well) and imo it’s one of SM’s best “experimental” songs. It’s always been polarising so I basically expected it to land somewhere around here even though it deserved so much better.

**wavingwolves** (10): DONE ABSOLUTELY DIRTY! This is one of my favourite titles by Red Velvet and it's by far their best song in the rate. I personally really love the progression of each chorus as the song goes, ending on such an amazingly high climax. I find this song perfect in what it brings to the table: a switch up, a bold structure and sound and the excitement I was missing from this era of the group. I guess it was too intellectually forward for people, which is why it ends up placing here. :////

# Cultists, witches and sympathizers of the occult


**ebooks#5454** (11): zimza11abim !!11!! yass lets give it up for Tro11s World Tour!!!

**akanewasright** (10): someone I know compared the chorus to msmsm by Sophie and I can’t unhear it

**becca** (10): no need for an explanation im a reveluv

**bluetriangles04** (10): ARE YOU READY FOR THIS???? Zimzalabim is the kind of unbridled fun that I wish SM producers would focus on honing instead of their current direction.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): quirky masterpiece i hope this wins to see people get mad

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the girls who get it get it. it's a song for intellectuals

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (10): just because I DID NOT EXPECT THAT CHORUS and almost choked on my champorado

**DaBigBoi** (10): My sim when they hit the club

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this song being LACED, literally one of the catchiest choruses ever

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Now, this is how you do an SM experimental track! After the disaster that is RBB, Zimzalabim is actually the title track that gets all of the notes right. The most important in making an experimental song is that it should be…you know…listenable, which RBB failed to be. With Zimzalambim, the production is all over the place in the best way possible and it matches the chaotic energy of a wild amusement park shown in their ReVe Festival Day 1 concept. Its hypothesizing anti-drop hook in the chorus accelerates the chaotic energy of the song further. I am aware that Zimzalambim is a controversial track among ReVeluvs but I really think this is one of the best songs in their discography because it defines Red Velvet’s commitment to experimenting with their music and concepts and Zimzalabim highlights this commitment very well.

**glitter408** (10): i love this song idk why it got so uch hate tho wendys green fuzzy outfit is horrible

**GREY** (10): maybe it was the mlm gene in me but the second i heard this song i was yassing

**jasannn** (10): En, DNI

**Jhe116** (10): An undeserving 10 but I want to watch the world burn

**lady\_sable** (10): people that hate zimzalabim are the weakest link

**LesApfels** (10): You're not gonna get this song the first time you hear it. After the second and third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?'. It sounds nothing... nothing like anything that's out right now.

**metanoira** (10): CAMP

**moooo566** (10): iconic. they wrote a song that does EVERYTHING. do we even need to listen to other kpop songs?

**notarobot3675** (10): i am one of the apologists who believes this is one of their best eras. there are dozens of us!! dozens!!

**PSSST12** (10): once again SM proving that they are the company that understands the concept of CAMP. intellectuals only I fear.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's hypnotising (yes this is a pun because i like it)

**reiichitanaka** (10): It's weird, I like weird, and weird is what they do best

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSSSS

**sage** (10): avant garde. experimental hiphop. noise pop. art pop. neoclassical darkwave.

**skargardin** (10): WHEEERE HAVE YOU BEEEN... ALL MY LIII-I-IIIFE

**slimboyfriend** (10): I'm not super familiar with the k-pop landscape, so after my first listen-through of this playlist I looked up some release threads for my favorite and least favorite songs on here and I was dumbfounded when I saw how universally hated this song was on release. It's not camp, it's just good!!

**Stryxen** (10): love this fleet foxes song

**terrencelovescum** (10): camp! like seriously camp! witches flying around in a circle around a bonfire near a pentagram? CAMP!

**TiltControls** (10): How could I be ready for something as beautiful as this?

**vaguelycatshaped** (10): Haters gonna hate but this song is a BOP

**vayyiqra** (10): Cling-clang hyperpop masterpiece; goes extremely hard.

**whoisValensi** (10): LOOK MOM I'M SUMMONING DEMONS WITH RED VELVET!!!!!!!

**BooksAndWhisky** (9.8): Y’all WEREN’T ready for this Zimzalabim! This truly feels like a gigantic roller coaster ride and I love it

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): korean women of experimental

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): this makes good breakdown music, don’t ask me *how* I know that

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): i relish in the chaos. when they go high during the last “zimzalabim” chants? hell ya. also specifically love irene in the 2nd verse and that like 4 seconds of “real” bass at 2:33

**yatcho** (9.1): the girls that get it, get it and the ones that dont, dont

**-chilazon-** (9): Didn't really know what to rate this because it's so weird but also so good but also maybe too weird? But in the end "so good" wins

**-mczrv-** (9): thankful to have an audio-visual representation of my brain on TEAMS + lockdown! thanks zimzalabim!

**2l82bstr8** (9): a cult classic

**chancehugs** (9): For some reason I was hooked onto this song from the first listen. Wendy's high note in the bridge gives me life.

**hikkaru** (9): mario plotting something evil with zimzalabim in the background

**KoolFunk** (9): This and RBB take the top 2 spots for the most beautiful bridge.

**mengzhongmeng** (9): didn't like it at first but it's a bop. their worst era styling wise, joy's braids and most of wendy's fits are not it

**MimisChoice9763** (9): it feels like I'm under this song's spell

**notallslendermen** (9): This grew on me a lot,

**rotating3Dtext** (9): camp.

**waluigiest** (9): *pitch perfect audition voice* zimzimzimzim

**xedophobic** (9): zimzalabim zimzimzalabim zimzimzalabim zimzim zimzalabim zimzimzalabim zimzimzalabim zimzim zimzalabim zimzimzalabim zimzimzalabim zimzim zimzalabim zimzimzalabim zimzimzalabim zimzim

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.8): any song that has me vibing to a word like zimzalabim has all my respect

**note\_2\_self** (8.8): Innovation iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I wasn’t sure what to expect but I actually really liked this, I think it’s camp [complimentary]

**Kwcty6888** (8.5): ???

**bulforster** (8.3): bop!

**Victerade** (8.3): i hated it at first but we have a love hate relationship currently. the very repetitive chorus sometimes get boring but the key word here is sometimes

**throwaway-7650** (8.1): it's no IGAB/red light/next level but it grew a lot

**1998tweety** (8): Are you ready for this?

**anagalisgv** (8): I can't say I particularly enjoy the song but I do love that it exists

**Awkward\_King** (8): what does zimzalabim mean i cannot find in the dictionary and the z section isnt very big so i feel like id notice it, please help i feel silly xx

**dlong56655** (8): I like when they're weird

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Activated the reptilian part of my brain when I first listened

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Let’s call it polarizing and move on.

**superr\_rad** (8): I’m a ZZM sympathizer. I like how quirky it is, the girls really sold the concept (could do without Joy’s box braids tho, SM and CA name a better duo…). I like songs that feel like theyre summoning a demon!

=====

ggsmackdown: **celladonn** (7.5): Their post-good moment

**ke1per** (7.5): bridge is stunning, the final chorus is everything, and the outro is the second everything

**savemeaseat143** (7.2): it's camp!

**anothertown** (7): Obama chuckled. "You mean the Chaos Emeralds?"

**bigbigbee** (7): It’s SO good until the chorus, but I feel very intimidated by the chanting. it literally unsettles me

**JohnnyToby** (7): now THIS with bass boost makes  more sense, I can slut drop to this

**JsaKim** (7): weirdly addicting

**Nixon4Prez** (7): Is it awful? Is it a masterpeice? Both at the same time?

**nt96** (7): They heard Sussudio once and ran with that gibberish idea and took the bassline from Where Have You Been. ok

**pornypete** (7): Divisive song it seems like? But it's one of my favorite titles from them, behind Peek-A-Boo

**Round\_Log401** (7): It's weird & a lot but that's the point.

**RReg29** (7): A poor man's I Got a Boy but still a lot of fun

**rubbie** (7): Very much sounds like "I Got A Boy"'s even weirder lil sister, it's a nice effort I suppose in terms of homage/deconstruction, and an interesting tune in its own right

**Tazzachar** (7): I actually increased the score because the hook got stuck in my head and I originally ranked this a 5

**Zypker125** (7): The chorus is catchy, the rap isn't too god awfully offputting, and the fun dance break is enough to get this a 7, despite my hatred of SM experimentalist songs.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): i really didn't know what to give this, it's kinda terrible but also really fun and idk I can't bring myself to hate it

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.6): I was gonna ask who came up with this but I remembered it's from SM this is like their whole thing

**astrologicalangel** (6.5): wow I was expecting this to be way worse based on peoples' reactions

**RaphaelArthur** (6.5): incredible but as much highs as lows

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): the drop here is kinda lifted from Where Have You Been

**Alumineous** (6): What in the Jesy Nelson is this title.

**bespectacIed** (6): Experimental queens. The bombastic final chorus tied the craziness of the rest of the song but idc... I still can't make up my mind if this experiment was successful lol. This will have the highest controversy score for sure

**cuttackone** (6): i was really excited when it came out but all other festival songs lasted longer

**Gonza\_90** (6): Choices were made

**ivyleaf33** (6): serving f(x) reject

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): the way they say zimzalabim is the best part

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i was honestly going to give this a 10 until i heard the chorus

**brokebutter** (5.8): i used to hate the chorus i and now i dont mind it but eeehhhh

# They were, in fact, NOT ready for this... ZIMZALABYE!

**thegirlin512** (5.5): Okay but it's kind of catchy?

**rikarikachan** (5.2): points for creativity but no. I'm sorry but "You'll like it after you listen to it more" is not a valid excuse for a song

**BasedButta** (5): but a ten for entertainment value it still cracks me up

**ChickyDipper** (5): It kind of felt like I was on acid went I first watched this MV but over time ~~I've forced myself to~~ learned to like it

**CrimsonROSET** (5): now get to work bitch

**intheaftermath** (5): at no point was someone like "hey, these verses and pre-chorus are awesome!!! maybe this zero effort grating chorus isn't the right choice!"???? Even just using the last chorus would've made this song an easy 8

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): not feeling this but I do think it would be funny if artists started using made up spell words in songs

**moonagenightmares** (5): the us military can probably use this song as a torture device

**toyletpauper** (5): All 5 of those points are for it’s iconicness, because otherwise, it would be a straight 1.

**welcome2thejam** (5): I don't even know if I like this song but it's been living in my head so hard that "Are you ready for this? Zimzalabim!" is starting to sound like a threat

**seanderlust** (4.3): "throw all your worries/over the flat earth" B.o.B. remix when

**anarkyah** (4): Since this song feels like multiple songs, I actually like Some parts but it is still too disjointed for me to enjoy entirely

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Zzzzzimzzzzzalabim

**lalafairy18** (4): However this song goes everywhere

**mimins** (4): I could like it!!! I see potential!!! but something is missing and that something is MAJOR

**nctdreamsqd** (4): The chorus is catchy but I don’t like anything else.

**SkylarV** (4): The start of this song is actually not even that bad, but the chorus just ruins everything good it had going for it, no saving it from that mess

**pig-serpent** (3.5): Completely nonsensical songwriting. The chorus is terrible and the upbeat parts are Woka Woka (This time for Korea).

**apatel27** (3): I Got A Boy but make it faux edgy

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): this is certainly a song

**DraculaWeekend** (3): We jumping and popping we zimzalabim

**en#8502** (3): i do not know what everyone see in this song. it sucks. #SORRY

**flavasavavandal** (3): People say this sounds like something that SOPHIE would produce and I don’t get, this sounds like shitty electropop circa 2009-2012 (specifically Where Have You Been) and only Kesha could pull that off, and as much as I do actually like RV, they are not Kesha

**Flippantry** (3): "Are you ready for this?" No Wendy, we weren't.

**milkywayinradius** (3): zimzalabim exists in the kwangya, you guys just don't understand

**agentofscranton** (2): pls i'm begging sm stans to love themselves and stop forcing themselves to like songs like this

**billie\_\_** (2): like you could've given us sunny side up.

**rslashpoopheads** (2): Okay fr y'all need to stream this remix it's literally the yassification of Zimzalabim... its Zimzalabimbofication if u will... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X52JMVxHqdw

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Help I thought the creepy remix on tiktok was the real song I… I think I prefer that one more…

**DefaultPophead** (1.5): This is popular? People actually like this? I'm crying this band makes me physically ill.

**bookthieving** (1): truly impressive how each section of this song is worse than what came before it

**frogaranaman** (1): what

**SatC1** (1): bad experiment

**thGnerd** (1): Terrible

**AxymHeart** (0): I just can't.

**babadork** (0): Hearing “are you ready for this” causes me anxiety.

**CaptainDaisyG** (0): Every song this song beats takes a year off my life. Let's assume I live until 85...

**Cooler\_lin** (0): i really want to get behind this track as i usually like songs that are on the camp side of things but the cult edits were right and not in a good way

**Esh\_Kebab** (0): I can already hear someone type "but it's camp", and bitch, if this is camp, I want to go home.

**ForgetfulAsf** (0): What an abomination

**Funkydollop33** (0): abomination

**sabooyah** (0): It is simply not worth sitting through this song just to enjoy the 12 second joy of a bridge.

vivianlight: I gave Zimzalabim a 7. I was actually obsessed with it when it was released but I'll admit it aged worst compared to other weird/chaotic/weirdly funny track imho. So I stick to a medium score and opinion. I still think it's iconic in its way and something very, very Red Velvet.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): I like this song, I think it's a fun Halloween-y tune and I usually really love fun slightly creepy concepts when pulled off by K-Pop groups. Do I LOVE it? No, TWICE has done this better with TT years before, but this was a cute moment still. A lot of people docked points for their interpretation of the song, and I can't really fault them for seeing it as an "anti-consent" song, but I do think the idea of "love" being beyond choice is framed as creepy because this is, well, being portrayed as creepy in a creepy Halloween concept where they play it up on the music video quite a lot, which is why it doesn't really bother me at all and I won't be docking any points for that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): This coming right after Dance The Night Away…sigh. Girls Planet 999 actually made this song grow on me a bit, because having to hear this song constantly in rehearsals and eventually the performances made me lowkey Stockholm it. If I rated this back in 2018 this probably would have been a 2. Anyway, it’s kinda cute now! It’s (probably) still in my bottom 3 TWICE title tracks but I no longer hate it. Still, I think this is an appropriate placement for it.

# Yass or YASS


**2l82bstr8** (10): at some point I thought this WASN'T one of their best songs. some people are just wired wrong

**celladonn** (10): People get upset about these lyrics being anti consent even though the video clearly has a slight horror theme where they're meant to be a bit evil and creepy... anyway I love problematic songs when they slap

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): girls planet 999 made me love this song. The beginning gives me unexplainably second hand embarrassment though

**pig-serpent** (10): This song immediately hit me with "instant classic" energy.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): making a non consensual bop would be a big no-no if it didn’t absolutely fuck

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i’m SORRY as a jeongyeon fan this is important to me ok?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this sounds like a song people would make yandere amvs to

**throwaway-7650** (10): this anti-consent #ANTHEM... when it's right it's right

**bluetriangles04** (9.8): #JUSTICEFORDAHYUNSFAKEBANGS

**-chilazon-** (9.5): Nearly perfect song, but I don't like the part where they say "It's simple, Y. E. S." That bit i too chanty and always gets on my nerves. My one nitpick for an otherwise perfect song.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9): i never got the hate

**bulforster** (9): so true!

**DaBigBoi** (9): Point deducted for the lyrics, but the production is rlly fun! Such an underrated mini too.

**hikkaru** (9): YASS OR YASS! -1 point for their refusal to acknowledge consent but it really is a bop

**LesApfels** (9): Queens of affirmative consent

**rubbie** (9): Twice's BEP-produced songs are so iconic that, as a result, I tend to overlook the rest of their singles sadly. This is perhaps the best of them, I love the chorus bursting with catchy melodies. Should definitely listen to this one more !

**skargardin** (9): BOP ALERT

**superr\_rad** (9): I think I like this song a little more than the average person does, I adore the mv aesthetics and the song is just a bop all around!!!

**thegirlin512** (9): I always forget this song exists, but it's honestly one of my favourite Twice songs. The music video isn't the greatest tbh, but I'm doing my best to ignore it for the rate.

**Victerade** (9): iconic

**rikarikachan** (8.8): How about, yes?

**sage** (8.8): YAS or YAS

**SkylarV** (8.7): Great song, very Twice, verses and bridge are a little weak IMO

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): problematic favourite

**agentofscranton** (8.5): much higher on this than I was when it first came out - maybe it's that 2018 pre-apocalypse nostalgia filter

**toyletpauper** (8.5): It aims and executes for a carnival-esque vibe incredibly well. Just a very solid song.

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.2): The lyrics are creepy as hell so I pretend it’s post-cringe camp or whatever to enjoy the chorus in peace

**anothertown** (8): Gaslighting anthem

**Awkward\_King** (8): i choose yass

**brpr425** (8): I don't think this song is AMAZING but it's one of my most looped TWICE songs so I almost rated it even higher just because of that

**corguri** (8): YASS OR YASS

**CrimsonROSET** (8): but how do i say no

**DaHumanTorch** (8): YASSSS or YASSSS

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Yes or Yes might be a mid title track in Twice’s standards but I think this establishes an important career point for Twice as they slowly stray away from cute concepts. In order for us to get Fancy, we need to get Yes or Yes. This song balances Twice’s the signature cute concept while also exploring the possibility of tackling something a bit mature in their music.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Is this camp yes or yes

**intheaftermath** (8): not big on the verses but that chorus is stellar!!! The "YES OR YES" feels like what Taylor (sorry, I know) wanted to achieve on "GO! FIGHT! WIN!" but couldn't

**lady\_sable** (8): jyp give jeongyeon more lines I am no longer asking 🔪

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): Yes!

**RaphaelArthur** (8): very catchy and unique but feels messy overall

**RReg29** (8): A very underrated Twice bop

**slimboyfriend** (8): Coercive consent... but it bops

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): they put crack in this  melody

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): their anti Meghan Trainor slay

**babadork** (7.6): I thought I was overthinking it until I saw them creepily smirking at me in the video.

**anagalisgv** (7.5): not a fan of Mina's English intro but otherwise cute

**becca** (7.5): I only really Yass to certain parts of this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I once saw someone say that this comeback felt “unnecessary” and I kinda agree with that, like I bop to it but if it disappeared I would not notice

**jasannn** (7.5): I remember lowkey thinking Twice was gonna get cancelled for these lyrics.

**thGnerd** (7.5): The intro ruins the song

**yatcho** (7.5): similar to DTNA for me but at least this is really catchy and upbeat. You guys did them such a favor picking this over More & More :sob:

**1998tweety** (7): consent anthem

**AxymHeart** (7): Thank GP999 for this song growing on me

**ivyleaf33** (7): i can't listen to this without thinking of the schoolboy cover

**notallslendermen** (7): Are the lyrics problematic and weird? Yes. Is it still a bop? Also yes.

**nt96** (7): How about a Possibly Maybe?

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I never liked this song except for the goofy armpit dance until I heard it on GP999 and now I can respect it.

**seanderlust** (7): the illusion of free choice by TWICE

**welcome2thejam** (7): Mabel Pines "Do you like me?: yes, definitely, [or] absolutely?" energy

**-mczrv-** (6.8): delivers on the kpop nostalgia

**Zypker125** (6.8): We stan non-consensual lyrics

**en#8502** (6.5): teach your kids consent everyone!

**huntyphobic** (6.5): Mina giving nothing in the intro kinda funny

**TiltControls** (6.5): I feel like I'm limited for choice here

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): blurred lines could never

**bespectacIed** (6): Torn with this. this was a cute bop and the mv concept is super fun but we honor consent in here!!! twice gaslighter era

**bigbigbee** (6): “I respect your opinion, I reject the discourse” - /u/nyoom

**vayyiqra** (6): This is a brain-off rate so I'm not going to overthink the lyrics and argue "um actually that's kind of toxic to be that demanding" or something. Idk this song's alright I guess. I'm not sure the breakdown at the end was needed but the chorus is fun.

**ke1per** (5.5): an improvement but nothing to write home about

**savemeaseat143** (5.5): the mv being filmed in Vancouver justifies this songs existence

ggsmackdown: # [CLC - No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZO8guhtnFw) oh wait wrong song sorry

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): this makes me very uncomfortable

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): No is a complete sentence.

**chancehugs** (5): This was actually an 8 the first time I heard it, but then I read into the lyrics and it just felt kinda... rapey? If this song was sung by a boy group they would've probably been cancelled so fast. Imagine a guy saying you can only choose Yes or Yes.

**cuttackone** (5): there is almost no twice song i dont care for but u picked the one

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (5): It mostly gets a low score so the lyrics being so pushy even if I think the song is clearly meant to be like “check this box if you like me or dont” while only giving yes as an offer.

**mengzhongmeng** (5): song is fine but dubious consent is never a great concept

**plastichaxan** (5): ok this was fine but the lyrics are something… and i’m not usually one to pay attention to them

**PSSST12** (5): MEH. a little bit generic. This is basically just a halloween version of what is love but worse

**Gonza\_90** (4): what the hell are those lyrics lmao

**GREY** (4): not really

**lalafairy18** (4): Although Yes or Yes isn't my favorite, I can't deny how perfect it is at representing Twice's concept

**SatC1** (4): The mina intro best part

**whoisValensi** (4): Lol I fucking hate this song and idk why. Man I really just did not fully get on that TWICE train until like... Fancy and after. Anyways, TWICE said WTF is consent. Tho I must say I'm currently trying to setup a new phone and I wish it was simple as a Yes or Yes, but instead it's like 50 "NOs".

**JohnnyToby** (3): ENERGY UP! The only good part in this nonconsensual song is the bridge

**mimins** (3): its boring and a failed cute concept sadly

**moonagenightmares** (3): oh that beat is so bland…

**Roxieloxie** (3): girl

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): consent WHO

**sabooyah** (2): No matter how many times I listen to this song I always forget it immediately after. And then I listen to it again and remember why I forgot it.

**terrencelovescum** (2): NO and NO. cute choreography tho.

**MimisChoice9763** (1.5): I don't know it feels a bit too safe and boring to me

**akanewasright** (1): these lyrics I’m-

**Cooler\_lin** (1): just terrible, forgettable in their discography and just annoying overall

**DefaultPophead** (1): Consent is sexy. This isn't sexy.

**runaway3212** (1): this song is both annoying and like a bit harrassement-y? Like it feels weird on so many levels

**KoolFunk** (0): speaking of.. I hate it, too positive, way too generic sounding imo, also questionable lyrics, I like having options

**wavingwolves** (7.9): This is ITZY's weakest title in the rate (but not in their discography anymore, thanks to their 2021 output), so I can't be mad at it placing the lowest, really. It kind of started a descend in quality on their work too, which made me truly sad because I always enjoyed their music and especially their titles a lot! This is still what I consider their last really good release, both in terms of project (Not Shy mini has my favourite b-side of theirs, [SURF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrOUHA464OU)) and title. I also still think they are filled to the brim with charisma and they can even turn a middling song into something more with the full force of their talent as performers!

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): I don’t dislike this song but I feel like it’s annoying and just has no impact whatsoever. Generally I think this is probably one of their most “forgotten” title tracks - say what you will about ICY but at least it packs a punch! Since I never see anyone talking about it, I assumed that this would place the lowest out of the ITZY songs and it looks like I was right.

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): honestly bangs

**PSSST12** (9): not gonna lie wasn't feeling this on the first listen but their performance absolutely elevates it.

**rubbie** (9): Fantastic song, although it seemed like a disappointment at the time (understandable, given the group's previous singles!), but I've always enjoyed it and thought it was a solid tune with some killer moments - especially that bridge.

**terrencelovescum** (9): this reminds me to restock my nutmegs. the ITZY adlib did the heavy lifting in the song.

**bulforster** (8.8): they play off each other so well here and seem the most in control of their talents.

**yatcho** (8.7): this is girl crush taken to obnoxious levels and yet I still love it what does that say about me...

**intheaftermath** (8.5): I think I liked this one just because it sounded the most unlike the other three. the really subtle chorus harmony is so good

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): “This pussy talking ITZY, NOT SHY WASH ME, ITZAAAAAAAAY”

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): Banger

**ebooks#5454** (7.5): i think there's a big difference between not being shy and committing crimes...

**jasannn** (7.5): a little disappointing compared to their first 3 titles but it still screams itzy (or ITZAYYYYYYYY) in good way. the pre-chorus is amazing and the chorus is iconic.

**Victerade** (7.5): ok

**whoisValensi** (7.5): THIS PUSSY TALKING ITZY NOT SHY WASH ME ITCHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

**1998tweety** (7): shes alright

**becca** (7): I like this song… sometimes

**CaptainDaisyG** (7): The best eight song run was all the GFRIEND and ITZY songs in a row. They could be the top eight and I wouldn't complain! This might seem like a low score for an ITZY fan, but I am trying to be fair. This song wouldn't be as good to me if it wasn't by the girls tbh

**ChickyDipper** (7): it's not exactly  good but wow it's catchy... ITZAAAYYYYY

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): not chai nutmeg itchyyyyyyy

**CrimsonROSET** (7): not wolf not me itzy

**cuttackone** (7): just to go back swinging

**DefaultPophead** (7): The worst of their four singles in the rate, but still quite fun.

**ke1per** (7): bridge is lovely and extra points for no dance break (say dance break one more time)

**seanderlust** (7): the instrumental sounds like one of the instrumentals ari would have used when she was trying to remake problem

**superr\_rad** (7): I didn’t like this song at first, I thought it was too noisy. But the verses save it for me!

**thegirlin512** (7): The other ITZY song I like. I think it's catchy and suits the member's voices a lot better.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (6.5): extra points bc cowboy hat

**ivyleaf33** (6.5): can't help but think of the memes whenever i hear this now

**mimins** (6.5): why did they rob the poor delivery guy... I like the ITZZAAAYYYYYY in the chorus but other than that its giving icy part 2

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Can’t relate. I hate talking to people.

**GREY** (6): this instant slay being attached to their worst mini . . . Okay

**Round\_Log401** (6): Once again so much going on but also hella catchy. Obsessed with the 'Itzeeey'.

**Stryxen** (6): ohhhhh this is why that emoji is called mileynotshy

**-chilazon-** (5.5): This was the start of Itzy's title tracks really going downhill for me. Again, I really want to like it, and there's parts of it that really slap, but the chorus is just too grating for my taste. But I'm glad that there's people out there who love it!

**-mczrv-** (5.5): Not Sure! First hand experience hearing this out loud at a bubble tea shop was a little jarring ngl

ggsmackdown: # Yes shy, yes me, ITZEEEEEEEEH 

**dlong56655** (5): Chaeryoung's "Itzyyyyyy" is the only part of this song I like

**frogaranaman** (5): imagine getting shot by the ITZY girls

**rikarikachan** (5): Sorry girls..

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): not my fave by them. i just really don't like the chorus

**TiltControls** (5): can't relate

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): That chorus is SO determined to ruin the rest of the song

**MimisChoice9763** (4.8): this song annoys me and Idekw

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): it's alright but my mom once walked in on me listening to this song so I have to deduct points from it for reminding me of that embarrassing event

**Roxieloxie** (4): i think itzy are the shawn mendes of kpop i will not elaborate

**runaway3212** (4): nauur

**sabooyah** (4): Not as fun as the others. Very childish, cringey, corny.

**savemeaseat143** (4): not for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): what is it with kpop songs and always ruining otherwise decent songs with the worst chorus you’ve ever heard

**apatel27** (3): Garbage drop. Something even No Copyright Music wouldn't even put out

**Bryoneehhh\_** (3): the downfall of itzy. in my mind they disbanded after wannabe

**Cooler\_lin** (3): the (ITZAAY) part in the chorus is the best part of the song and the only part worth listening back to. the rest of the song is annoying

**flavasavavandal** (3): Them drawing out that “ITZZY” in the chorus is such a momentum killer, lucky for them Not Shy didn’t have much momentum with that honk of a synth line

**Nixon4Prez** (3): Not Good

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): this is like the home alone 4 of itzy’s singles

**pig-serpent** (3): That badass wild west rock song that plays in the MV before the actual song starts? I'd rather be listening to that.

**Zypker125** (2.8): Not Shy to say this song is trash.

**2dina3dworld** (2.5): me when I have head lice be like "Itchyyyyyyy"

**anothertown** (2): song is ass

**thedoctordances1940** (1.8): just a genuinely awful chorus

**JohnnyToby** (1): not good

**wavingwolves** (7.1): A better song than LA DI DA, but worse than both Bon Bon Chocolat and now Pirate. Well, at least it isn't Adios or First, right? In any case, I think this is just dumb fun and even if I wasn't the biggest fan of it at release I can see the appeal. I especially like the breakdown at the end and I think Mia is a very charismatic performer, which makes it a little more understandable as to why she gets so much center time.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): Er…what to say about this…Congrats to Mia for getting half the lines and screen time to herself, I guess!

---

# [DUN DUN](https://youtu.be/-8lDYrvTILc)


**akanewasright** (10): idk why I drag blackpink’s noisy ass songs and slut drop to this

**becca** (10): UR SO DUN… DUN DUN

**bluetriangles04** (10): insert the classic Mia + Friends joke here; but in reality, Dun Dun showed the strength of EVERGLOW and their consistency in releasing uptempo empowering music by their 2nd comeback.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the song has such a simple premise but like they snapped, idk who this man is but they are done for sure

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): a bop. I can never get it out of my head after I listen to it

**moonagenightmares** (10): aisha ate

**RaphaelArthur** (10): incredibly great on every aspect

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSS!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): look up the definition of banger and u will find this song

**throwaway-7650** (10): mia and the girls did that, she #ATE the dance break

**whoisValensi** (10): Me and my 200+ plays agree that this song is not dun dun dun dun dun dun~

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): still can't believe I used to dislike this song

**ChickyDipper** (9.5): this song is what plays in my head when I kill little kids on Fortnite

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.5): If there is a non-Big 3 girl group that nails the girl crush concept perfectly, it would be Everglow and DUN DUN shows that they excel at this concept.

**thegirlin512** (9.5): The chorus is kind of addictive, but I love the rest except for the second verse.

**anagalisgv** (9): the first chorus where everything pulls back except for Yiren's voice and then all the instrumentation comes back at once ... so good

**Esh\_Kebab** (9): Ah, yes, Everglow. A group of five artists, and their orange-haired friend who is tragically mute, apparently.

**metanoira** (9): the girls who get it...get it

**seanderlust** (9): In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups. The police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories.

**TiltControls** (9): The music stopping wit the 'DUN's works so damn well here

**-chilazon-** (8.5): Abrasive but in a good way, the chorus is what truly elevates this song.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): the amount of streams this has is baffling because i truly feel like it came and went with like no noise whatsoever?

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8.5): y’all hate this when adios is RIGHT THERE??

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): EU kills me. give onda more to do. chorus doesn’t let the prechorus down here. bridge is nice, i like the back and forth during it

**Victerade** (8.5): ONE OF THEIR BEST TITLES I DONT MAKE THE RULES ages kinda bad but who cares slayed super hard

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): ~~dangerously close to~~ so bad it's good territory

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**Cooler\_lin** (8): this was my first time hearing this song in full and when i tell you i danced the whole time...

**frogaranaman** (8): this could have been a slap house song and I wouldn't have questioned it

**mimins** (8): the 'your so dun dun dun dun dun' in the first chorus will live in my mind for the rest of my life.

**pig-serpent** (8): You're so dumb dun dun dun dun is pretty funny. Great performances all around.

**prada** (8): YOU’RE SO DUN!

**PSSST12** (8): I like this beat drop gurl crush songs about being a baddie sue me 😭😭

**rikarikachan** (8): This wins, like, a whole extra point for the "you're so done" before the first chorus drop

**Round\_Log401** (8): I expected something different from the teasers tbh. Chorus is my least fave part but the 'dun dun' part is literally one of the best things I've ever heared. Also the rap parts are insanely good. Love the styling.

**rubbie** (8): Good stuff, love the energy. I know for many people the messiness is part of the appeal, but I wish it'd been streamlined a bit.

**terrencelovescum** (8): jayz bopping my head and squinting. this is such a lazy song but im just gonna ignore that and have fun.

**vaguelycatshaped** (8): Whenever I remember this song I'm like 'heeeh I don't really like it' and then I actually listen to it and I'm like 'THAT'S A BOP i'm grooving baby'

**vayyiqra** (8): watch the drum go dun dee dun-dun dun dee dun-dun

**bigbigbee** (7.5): This song is kind of dumb but it grew on me immensely

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): I’m not in love with this but man that instrumental line gets in your head.

**mengzhongmeng** (7.5): obsessed with the instrumental after 3:02

**thGnerd** (7.5): Good edm track that is just there to turn up loud

**-mczrv-** (7): it’s a lot, but I can respect it

**AssailantArcturus** (7): i actually really love everglow but dun dun and adios are to me just worse versions of first and pirate so

**bespectacIed** (7): i unironically live for this lol so catchy

**chancehugs** (7): I preferred Adios tbh. This song feels weirdly unpolished.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what the fuck is that noise

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The chorus of this is good I just wish the rest wasn’t… screechy noise

**nt96** (7): Are all their songs named after sounds?

**pornypete** (7): Grower. But it grew!

**savemeaseat143** (7): it's catchy

**2dina3dworld** (6.8): this song gives random nugu girl group with a budget of $10 teas

**Stryxen** (6.8): there is a 50/50 chance the drop makes my body reflexively yass or convulse in disgust

**BooksAndWhisky** (6.5): EU and Mia ate this

**ivyleaf33** (6.5): is anyone else bothered by the mixing here?

**ke1per** (6.5): can't really appreciate the shouty bits here though I usually love shouty bits

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Hard to swallow pills: Mia deserved all her lines and screentime because she ATE that prechorus it's the only good part of the entire song.

**yatcho** (6.5): you cant tell me this wasn't produced by an AI

**sabooyah** (6): Also forgettable.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): This sounds like it could be big on tiktok

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (5): not a fan of the choreo but mv looked good

**cuttackone** (5): it slaps but its so awkward

**lalafairy18** (5): Ever since First came out dun dun feels kind of childish to me. eu's rap verse hits though

**waluigiest** (5): I hope they play this at basketball games

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): you know what else is done? my patience for this song

**en#8502** (4): dun dun dun dun dun dun ever make me listen to this song again (jk it's not that bad but i just wanted to make this joke)

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): this song’s dum dum dadum dum

**Zypker125** (3.2): By far Everglow's worst track, the chant chorus drop trend-chasing is awful.

**brpr425** (3): Another song where the drop totally ruins it for me

**DaBigBoi** (3): After this rate, I’ll probably be DUN.

**DefaultPophead** (3): Not feeling it, sorry. Not enough of a bop to offset the lack of an IT-factor.

**dlong56655** (3): Bon Bon Chocolate absolutely slaps and everything else they've released has been overproduced garbage

**sage** (2.1): its like everglow were intentionally making the most annoying songs possible

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.5): fitting title because that's what i was waiting for the entire time this was going

**maskchachki** (1.5): the song is annoying and grating.

**anarkyah** (1): I feel like there’s not even a catchy part here between all the noise

**flavasavavandal** (1): I hated this on first listen, just out aggressively in your face it is, like get out of my face if that’s your excuse of a chorus with horrid synthwork

**GREY** (1): this song is genuinely so awful omfg imagine my shock and horror when i couldnt escape this shite for a good month

**wavingwolves** (8.3): I find this song SO good and I don't understand its placement, but I guess we will have to live with it... It's pure and unadulterated happiness and it's the kind of song I can't really sing along without smiling at least a little bit. I think Lovelyz always pulled off bright concepts the best, Kei in special really shines through here! I also really love their vocal delivery here and production here. It feels really clean but still slightly unpolished in a way that adds to it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): Not gonna lie, it did take a few listens for this song to actually get into my head but once that chorus clicked, it CLICKED! I can’t believe this is literally between DUN DUN and [redacted], y’all did this song so dirty.

# Which day? DAY 3???? 


**poemforsmallthings** (11): they were so great... perfect girl group with a perfect discography. Take my 11

**Awkward\_King** (10): wednesday

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That post chorus breakdown is such a serve!

**DaBigBoi** (10): That post-chorus instrumental is actually so heavenly. Literally one of my favorite groups, and I hope they don’t get done dirty by this rate, but they probably will be.

**GREY** (10): its giving slaybak

**hunnybee12** (10): i've never heard this before but it's fucking great. i only knew lovelyz from queendom and well...

**pieisawesome123** (10): This song desersves so much more recognition than it got

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSS

**TiltControls** (10): This sounds like it could be the intro to a lighthearted romance movie (complimentary)

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): I love this chapter of shingeki no kyojin. which? both!

**savemeaseat143** (9.1): a classic late 2010s kpop song

**-chilazon-** (9): Wow I like this. Even though Ah-Choo is catchier, their voices have so more nuance in this one.

**2l82bstr8** (9): classy, adorable, quirky and interesting

**pig-serpent** (9): Lovelyz have the perfect name because they really nail the breezy, cute, summer aesthetic.

**rubbie** (9): those synths in the background are sublime. (Produced by sweetune, which explains it)

**seanderlust** (9): this kind of gives me CRJ vibes

**SkylarV** (9): One of their few good titles

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.9): served for the gays with this one

**bulforster** (8.7): HAA those punchy chorus synths slay me HWOO

**en#8502** (8.5): the serotonin boost from this song is unreal

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I do like this song, it’s probably their “sugariest” title track (which is REALLY saying something) but as a big Lovelinus I can’t help but wish that “Destiny” or “Now, We” were here instead since they’re more important to the group’s discography.

**sage** (8.4): the 5 second intro is the best part of this song

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): a bop that i will immediately forget about once i've finished the rate (ok i listened to it again during a listening party and yeah it is really good but i can't say i remembered it, maybe i should change that though)

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**DefaultPophead** (8): What a shame that these girls are disbanding. Devastated :(

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): On, the chorus sounds so lovely. (No pun intended)

**PSSST12** (8): its surprisingly good ngl

**rslashpoopheads** (8): DIA - Woo Woo

**sabooyah** (8): Fun I love it, wish it was layered better though.

**superr\_rad** (8): They perfectly capture bright concepts, this is so uplifting

**thegirlin512** (8): Not as cutesy as ahchoo, but sweet just the same!

**Victerade** (8): good song but kinda forgettable for me

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): intro went brazy, the chorus and pre-chorus were great but i thought the verses were kinda boring

**mimins** (7.5): this song got better the longer it went on

**whoisValensi** (7.5): Starting to think I was too harsh on the "cute" concept as a young child a few years into K-Pop. In a post-everything is girl crush world, you miss gems like this more than you thought you would.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.2): this is much better, way more fun!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): april 24th

**prada** (7): well

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s cool

**Zypker125** (7): Lovelyz's best title track easily.

**BasedButta** (6.5): great chorus

**ivyleaf33** (6): the verses really drag this one down

**mengzhongmeng** (6): [YASS!! Lovelyz Mijo Confidence is LIT!! She is so FUNNY!! 😂😂](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_W8piGtLiI)

**metanoira** (6): i would never listen to this again but its palatable

**RaphaelArthur** (6): not much to say, not sure why it's here

**terrencelovescum** (6): ok, im moving a little in the chorus.

# Which day? Day 1, it seems.

**BooksAndWhisky** (5.7): The chorus deserves way better verses

**becca** (5): mid

**CaptainDaisyG** (5): Such a shame. They could've had my highest average if this song didn't lowkey suck a bit.

**note\_2\_self** (5): I had to relisten to this one because I forgot about it

**ke1per** (4.5): on the dated end of the dated-retro spectrum

**-mczrv-** (4): just not the genre of kpop for me

**chancehugs** (4): Weirdly reminds me of Twice's Dance The Night Away which I despise. Otherwise pretty inoffensive.

**cuttackone** (4): lovelys are a one hit wonder tho

**Round\_Log401** (4): Simply not my taste.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i dont think theres a single original concept in this song that hasnt been done better elsewhere in this rate

**wavingwolves** (6.3): As much as I personally LOVE the colourful and fruity (not like that, unfortunately) concept of this, I can't find it in myself to love the song itself. I'm sure I enjoyed it a lot more during release, but it has grew to become a RV title I find merely okay. It's definitely fun and all, but it does pale a little in comparison with other Red-side releases, which have been mostly my favourites by them, especially Dumb Dumb, Russian Roulette and Rookie.

**MoonlightByWindow** (2.5): I basically can’t name a single summer song I’m a huge fan of, so that was already one strike against this song. I just find this song so…nothing? Literally nothing exciting happens here, it’s something ~~un~~forgettable~ This was truly the start of the end for my Reveluv days </3

**Stryxen** (11): i like this song a lot it makes me happy

**-chilazon-** (10): Sooo catchy!! Love it when RV gets wacky

**Awkward\_King** (10): i play mario then i take a nap

**becca** (10): no need for an explanation im a reveluv

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): GO MINION SONG GO WE LOVE YOU

**fadedblue09** (10): I dont get why people hate this. This is like the lovechild of Red Flavor and Russian Roulette, and one of the better summer comebacks of the last few years

**intheaftermath** (10): the harmonies on this one sound excellent, they really nailed that arcade minigame vibe!!!

**metanoira** (10): summer velvet is peak velvet. also all the new reveluvs getting pissed about this song after jumping on from the bad boy train will never not be funny.

**rikarikachan** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG peak annoying cutesy bop babananabababanananan

**rslashpoopheads** (10): This is their best song and I will die on this hill even though I am literally the only one who thinks this.

**rubbie** (10): The kind of song that is filled to the brim with near-universal melodies, to the point where it becomes almost annoying, but it's delivered/produced so perfectly it's quite addictive instead.

**sage** (10): i have never understood why this song is so controversial its literally so inoffensive and an absolute SMASHA

**seanderlust** (10): okay between this and russian roulette, RV has really mastered the art of the earworm, huh

**vayyiqra** (10): :hanawinsExcite: One of their most fun songs, this one gets you pumped.

**brokebutter** (9.7): easily one of their top two title tracks

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): invented bananas

**notarobot3675** (9.5): an underrated tt from red velvet imo

**nt96** (9.5): omg I thought sparkles were flying out of my computer, but it was really cuz it overheated and combusted. ICONIC

**SkylarV** (9.4): Classic red title, no complaints from me

**-mczrv-** (9): this song goes so hard and for what??

**bluetriangles04** (9): BA-BANANA BA BA BANANA NANA

**chancehugs** (9): I did not like Red Flavor, so this song is Red Velvet's quintessential summer song to me.

**DefaultPophead** (9): This is so cute! This is what I thought TWICE would be like. I might just have to stan! NVM just checked out the rest of the Red Velvet songs. it all goes downhill from here. Wish me luck on my journey to becoming an anti.

**runaway3212** (9): yassss

**skargardin** (9): wait.. this is so cute OMG!!!

**TiltControls** (9): wow the gamers are really taking over huh

**Victerade** (9): I WILL DEFEND THIS SONG TILL THE DAY I DIE! do we hate having fun why do people dislike this song

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): ba banana baba banananana

**universemates** (8.7): The production and verses are excellent but I have to dock points off for "ba-ba-banana" and "go go airplane"

**throwaway-7650** (8.6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9EHdp1ynUU

**akanewasright** (8.5): why is this MV like one third “oddly satisfying” compilation

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Among the girl groups who does summer title tracks perfectly, I have to give it to Red Velvet. The best part of their summer tracks including Power Up is that these can be played in anytime even when it’s not on summer time. For Power Up specifically, this song is quite refreshing as they serve as the opposite to the the typical Latin-pop sound that K-pop likes to use when doing summer concepts, while maintaining its singature Red Velvet style.

**lady\_sable** (8.5): rv invented the concept of summer

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.5): such a cute song

**xedophobic** (8.5): ❤ summer anthem also the mango/pineapple (i forget) juice in the m/v makes me hungry to this day

**babadork** (8.4): This is both ridiculous and very catchy.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): everything about this has pen pineapple apple pen energy

**2dina3dworld** (8): this is… kinda bug and kinda snax (do AS5)

**Alumineous** (8): It would be really funny if this song was about the dick. They do say banana a lot and, well, the title.

**anothertown** (8): their minions era

**bigbigbee** (8): I DO wan it, I DO wannit wannit wannit wannit

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8): it’s cute!

**mengzhongmeng** (8): a great red summer concept and song, but it's not their best. mr. e and blue lemonade from the mini are some top tier b-sides!

**jasannn** (7.8): fuck Yeri’s and Wendy’s stylist here

**Kwcty6888** (7.8): fun but generic

**bulforster** (7.7): bop!

**DaBigBoi** (7.5): “B-Banana, b-b-banananana [...] Let’s power up!” - Me when I’m horny

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUZGTfEQqqI

**ivyleaf33** (7.5): fun, but can't really beat their earlier red title tracks

**LesApfels** (7.5): Justice for #Cookie Jar

**sarcasticsobs** (7.3): ba-banana ba-ba-banana-nana, ba-banana ba-ba-banana-nana

**BasedButta** (7): haha this is so cute

**cuttackone** (7): ba na na na BA NA NA NA NA

**en#8502** (7): this is what Gru plays when he summons his minions

**JsaKim** (7): banananananananana

**notallslendermen** (7): One of their weakest tt's but still fun

**PSSST12** (7): Red Flavor's uglier and dumber sister I fear.

**RaphaelArthur** (7): great vocals but a bit flat

**rotating3Dtext** (7): ba-banana ba ba. i had forgotten about this song.

**Round\_Log401** (7): If you don't get hype from 2:42 onwards wtf?

**slimboyfriend** (7): Another song that I was gonna rate lower but pulled a Stockholm Syndrome and got stuck in my head too long

**superr\_rad** (7): I don’t love this song as much as their other TTs but its definitely fun and bright!!

**yatcho** (7): even a mediocre RV release is mostly just a catchy bop

**2l82bstr8** (6.5): better than I remembered it but I fear those stupid little minions have ruined bananas for me forever

**pig-serpent** (6.5): The chorus of this is mostly really good but I don't like the yeah-ea-eah part. Walks a thin line between upbeat fun and annoying and it's falling off in both directions.

**thGnerd** (6.5): Ba banana

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): kinda bad kinda just pure camp

**DaHumanTorch** (6.3): no one: minions:

**Zypker125** (6.3): Umpah Umpah is the much better version of this

**1998tweety** (6): I personally find this song underwhelming even though I know it was actually a pretty big hit. It's not an awful song but they do have a high bar to match.

**agentofscranton** (6): minions-core

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): this is so cute it borders on annoying

**CrimsonROSET** (6): it’s giving troom troom, it’s giving 5 minute crafts, it’s giving tasty

**flavasavavandal** (6): Please refrain from using bananana in your song, Gwen is the only person allowed to do that

**ignitethephoenix** (6): is this supposed to sound like video game music

**lalafairy18** (6): I love Red Velvet songs that sound like a video game

**bespectacIed** (5): cutesy but on the low end of their title tracks. minion ass song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This is sure a K-pop song.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): Banananano

**frogaranaman** (5): the mv felt like a Target ad

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): as a gamer, I’m offended

**MimisChoice9763** (5): sounds too childish to me

**welcome2thejam** (5): Nintendo Switch commercial-core

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): Caroline Polachek - So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings timestamp 1:59

**moonagenightmares** (4): this was a Choice

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): feel like i just listened to this song and don't remember anything about it so

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Unlike LOVE BOMB which sound like a video game in a cool way, this sounds like a video game in a cringe way

**ke1per** (3.5): very catchy but the bridge ruins the vibes

**anarkyah** (3): Tried to recreate Red Flavor and failed

**apatel27** (3): Sounds like a bad idol song

**mimins** (3): i do not think they pulled this one off

**sabooyah** (3): The only banana song I wanna listen to is by Gwen Stefani.

**SatC1** (3): imagine releasing this after bad boy

**terrencelovescum** (3): bananas are a bottom tier fruit along with watermelons and cherries.

**thegirlin512** (3): I mean it's not bad? 3 seconds after finishing it though, and I genuinely can't remember what it sounded like.

**GREY** (2): ? Okay

**Cooler\_lin** (1.5): ever since this song dropped i could not stand it and i was dreading listening to it again for this rate. the harmonies were nice at least

**JohnnyToby** (1): I can't get past the first 2 seconds without cringing so sad bc the chorus chords are kinda cool

**whoisValensi** (0): Stop trying to make ~~fetch~~ Red Flavor 2.0 happen!!!! Seriously wow wtf. Also somehow this song is very annoying to me. I blame the BA-BANANA BA-BA-BANANA shit, reminds me of fucking minions. Like maybe I psyched myself up for another summer bop too hard back in the day, but like yeah even on future review aka going back to this song years since it originally released it really does not hold up for me at all in anyway and it hasn't grown on me either. So yeah, easy 0 from me since the minute I saw it was in the rate and going back and actually listening to it for the rate hasn't changed my mind, fun!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Is this better than Savage? YES!! Is this better than Next Level? NO!! But I do love this song - I totally understand why people dislike it but it's such an earworm. I'm excited to see where aespa progress as a group.

**wavingwolves** (3.5): I'll admit, I switch on this song A LOT. Upon release I hated it, then after a month I was like "well, it was fine, actually", then I went back to hating it again once Next Level was released and I found out what it was like to actually enjoy a song by aespa, then Savage was released and I found out how it was to actually hate a song by aespa... and now I just dislike it again, but I don't hate it. The choreo, MV, performance of this, though? Yeah, all bad, which just further cement my feelings about Black Mamba at this time. Also, the lore stuff is kinda camp if you think about it...

# [MY NAEVIS WE LOVE YEW!](https://youtu.be/RilkY0Ir1jI)

**moonagenightmares** (11): great debut i still remember watching the mv 40 times in a row when it dropped

**-chilazon-** (10): aespa is my favorite girl group!! But for real, I love this song and I never get tired of it. It's hard to describe what I love so much about it. It's so different from sounds I've heard before, it's so catchy but never annoying, I love that they use the full range of their voices, just everything.

**AxymHeart** (10): Aespa's best title track imo

**GREY** (10): Where do i even begin to explain how absolutely amazing aespa is. It all started with their nonsense lore, i was hooked the second i heard the word "kwangya" bless my ears. SingSing serving the second she stepped into that recording booth oh i know she was feeling herself! Also teehee is it just me or does beltner literally sound like celine dion here? Both of them are some of my fav singers ever :heart_eyes:

**intheaftermath** (10): this is my little brother's favorite kpop song because he likes fun facts about poisonous creatures. So here's a black mamba fact for you! Did you know that black mambas can reach 14 feet in length? Crazy!

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): call me basic but this is actually the only aespa song I listen to daily. Also it was the only era Giselle was decent at dancing. After all dancing skills left her body along with the capacity to think before speaking

**PSSST12** (10): once again SM proving that they are THEE standard when it comes to kpop innovation by inventing kwangya and Naevis 😤💅

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSS!

**terrencelovescum** (10): perfect in every way.  the instrumental is just godly.

**thegirlin512** (10): I loved this one from the first listen. The "monochrome to colours/this is evo evolution" part is so addictive. Also, I don't know how I managed to sprain my ankle doing the TT choreo but not this.

**Treecoh** (10): this song is kinda awful but it bops

**Zypker125** (9.8): This is by far Aespa's best title track, I don't understand what drugs everyone else is on when they bandwagon onto the Korean GP's love of Next Level (Savage is solid but is ruined by the awful "rap" chanting/shouting verses, but that's for another rate).

**anagalisgv** (9): sorry guys this is so good

**AssailantArcturus** (9): i am in love with ning yizhuo

**ChickyDipper** (9): my naevis why can't I do that big drop dance move in the chorus without falling over 😭

**dlong56655** (9): Praise be to Naevis

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I feel like a debut track did a great job when the song can perfectly introduce the group and what they stand for. For a track that’s supposed to introduce us the world of KWANGYA, I thought this track did a good job establishing aespa’s lore. While their succeeding tracks Next Level and Savage are obviously superior, Black Mamba remains a bop and is a perfect debut track for aespa.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is like blackpink music but good

**vayyiqra** (9): Why is this group so polarizing? (They are, right?) This is cool!

**Victerade** (9): ONE OF THEIR BEST! the amount of hate it got was undeserved

**brokebutter** (8.9): once it clicked i had this on repeat for hours

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop, Next Level stomped though

**ebooks#5454** (8.5): why they got k/da character personas tho,,,

**lady\_sable** (8.5): sm vocals are unparalleled

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): I mean it's no Savage but this is still pretty great!

**poemforsmallthings** (8.5): they're singers... they SING

**prada** (8.5): MAMAMAMAMBA

**RaphaelArthur** (8.5): audacious, unique but mostly amazing vocals

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.3): i wish we were rating next level or savage but anyway. this is such a hard dance on Just Dance also

**akanewasright** (8): why did this grow on me, I was having fun dragging it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I feel like I shouldn’t like this chorus but I definitely do.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8): it was a good debut

**Cooler\_lin** (8): Banger! I sweat every time i listen to this track because i always dance to it. I really needed a great high note from some of these tracks and miss Ning delivers!

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): that choreo is so wild

**CrimsonROSET** (8): just dance classic

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): I thought this was a Kobe reference when it came out

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Good debut

**hikkaru** (8): that synth bass is sick

**milkywayinradius** (8): needs more kwangya

**mimins** (8): I like the choreo and I love the drop plus the visuals

**rslashpoopheads** (8): When the bass kicks in on the second half of the chorus whew.

**rubbie** (8): Never expected these girls to have such an amazing 2021 from this song, but this was a great debut nonetheless

**superr\_rad** (8): still my favorite aespa TT, its definitely their most uhhh regular TT?? The choreo is super cool but I cant imagine them doing that for concerts lmao, smacking the ground 3 times during the song.

**whoisValensi** (8): Starting to wonder if this is their best title.... I mean I love Savage and all but also like idk fam... Need them to make more stuff like 'YEPPI YEPPI' tbh. Also if we could just get them to drop the æ-members shit... But at the same time... let's just make sure SHINee don't drop a "KWANGYA" in a song first tho, cause I will rage. (Side-note: I'm watching the video and wow their styling was SHIT this era, man. The best outfit is Ningning's hacker computer outfit w/ the green top, and even then it's not that good...)

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): it gets stuck in my head, but the chorus doesn’t work much for me except for the background bass/synth. i love the girls but haven’t *loved* a title track yet. do love the way winter pronounces certain words though

**universemates** (7.9): One of the weaker aespa songs but I still give it a somewhat high score for my girl Ningning. Anyways give the whole Savage mini album a listen, hands down my favorite kpop release of 2021.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I wonder if anyone has made a Kobe tribute reel with this song playing in the background

**jasannn** (7.8): i almost broke my back attempting to this dance

**-mczrv-** (7.7): impressively underwhelming and overwhelming at the same time!

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i fear i like this more than ive been told i should

**ivyleaf33** (7.5): aespa has great music as long as you keep the cc off and never search up the lyrics. please never release english versions of this stuff sm, i'm begging you.

**LesApfels** (7.5): SM get rid of the weird unnecessary concept challenge

**Round\_Log401** (7.5): Was a little overwhelmed in the beginning, took me a year to like it but so catchy.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): it bops (even the chorus) but I can't with the lyrics

**vaguelycatshaped** (7.5): My least fave tt of theirs but still great with a lot of badass energy

**cherryices** (7.2): oh this is just word salad

**2l82bstr8** (7): dishwater

**anothertown** (7): naevis hive rise up

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): what's the deal with this group

**BasedButta** (7): interesting musical choices here but i hate this mv

**cuttackone** (7): aespa is the greatest kpop group out right now and black mamba is the only song that doesnt show it

**DefaultPophead** (7): The discord hyped this band up so much. They also swear that this song pales in comparison to their recent works. I wanted to score this lower, but there was a really cool five second run in there that I really dig.

=====

ggsmackdown: **DraculaWeekend** (7): This is surprisingly the least terrible aespa song

**ggal2020** (7): worst song in their discography. yes worse than forever. but it still hits.

**ke1per** (7): got much better as it went on

**rikarikachan** (7): It's a solid debut. Better than Next Level.

**sabooyah** (7): Fun! The ending is the best part.

**skargardin** (7): A solid song if you block out all of the kwangya bullshit

**SkylarV** (7): Such an SM song, misses the mark a bit but still interesting enough

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The concept of KWANGYA is so funny to me. Like the label is trying to make this super deep and complicated extended group universe but my understanding is that nobody actually knows what the hell it’s about

# 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍


**yatcho** (6.2): you can't convince me these girls are the new big group, SM are trying to hard at this point im not buying it

**chancehugs** (6): I thought this song was kind of uninspired tbh, and all the Kwangya and ae references felt really shoehorned. Really glad they went hyperpop after this.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): when savage gets rated and wins... iconic

**Roxieloxie** (6): idk man, yassifeied mark mothersberg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): well. its not the worst aespa song i’ve heard

**seanderlust** (5.7): this was a 2020 debut? it feels dated

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): I don’t mind this song, the verses sound cool. But the chorus is very underwhelming, especially with the clapping build-up.

**pig-serpent** (5.5): This would be fun in a club but I wouldn't listen to this in my room.

**savemeaseat143** (5.5): thank you this group for freeing me from my SM bias

**apatel27** (5): please for the love of god just use an actual chorus

**becca** (5): another song i use to yass to and then it got old

**bespectacIed** (5): An okay debut, catchy. It established their ridiculous off-putting concept quite well, so there's that. But Next Level is such a monumental iconic song, flop mamba feels like a fever dream

**RandomHypnotica** (5): it's just so… nothing

**frogaranaman** (4): mv looks like it was filmed in the metaverse

**TiltControls** (4): 🐍

**anarkyah** (3): I feel like there’s a catchy part here but it’s not found in their voices nor melodies, just in certain parts of the beat

**billie\_\_** (3): miss when sm's experimental stuff was also good.

**BooksAndWhisky** (3): I blame Kwangya and this song for global warming

**lalafairy18** (3): Looking back on aespa's debut compared to their comebacks, SM played this really safe

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): sometimes i tremble at the thought of them in the future being 27 years old still singing with their Miis about sinks in kwangya

**DaBigBoi** (2.5): Lee Sooman will not win!!!

**dekubaku** (2): Kinda disappointing as debut but they more than made up for it with Next Level.

**en#8502** (2): this is what corporatism would sound like if corporatism was music - lacks personality, a front only to showcase their nonsensical "cinematic universe" that they have crafted – so painfully pretentious

**fadedblue09** (2): Ehh I'm sure they'll do better next time

**thedoctordances1940** (1.7): wow this is even worse than i remembered it, just so ridiculously annoying

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): genuinely one of the most confusingly bad songs I’ve heard in my entire life although I do think it’s kinda hilarious how Aespa songs literally contain lore dumps in the actual lyrics

**sage** (1): this song is so horrendous omfg fawk aespa, one of the worst debuts i can think of

**2dina3dworld** (0): this is just boring background noise. Also the mixing on this is fucking terrible, the instrumental has an 8D effect but it’s so noisy and the wall of sound effect used just makes it headache inducing. The mixing has the unfortunate effect of making them sound like they’re being recorded singing on a karaoke machine too. And don’t get me started on how Kwangya is such a bad example of world building ~~actually now that you ask, it lacks structure and consistency, and is an inaccessible concept for the casual viewer. Of course, you can have good worlds without one of those, but Kwangya lacks all three. That’s not on the girls though, that’s on the higher ups at SM~~

**vivianlight** (0): It's bad and very bland in the effort of being innovative

**wavingwolves** (7.5): I really love the synth-work here, especially in the chorus. I think it's a really well produced song, sounds really sleek and elegant while still being super fun. An improvement from Power Up, the former RV Summer Song, and it deserved a bit better here. I won't complain because this rate has the chance of being the revenge SM Entertainment artists had it coming after doing *so* well in every ~~main~~ rate it featured one of their artists. They might still win after all and get the last laugh after a Day 1 massacre? For sure, odds might still strongly be in favour of Psycho, who knows! Not me, one of the hosts! But that's their only chance, and for that I find it a little funny.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): It’s not a bad song but similar to Power Up (and Red Flavor, which was in the first GG rate), it’s a RV summer song which I just don’t really care about. Some parts of it are fun, hence why I didn’t give it a bad score, but it’s not particularly exciting. Evidently a lot of you felt the same way!

---

**vayyiqra** (11): Idk why, but this is the RV song I've listened to most. It's energetic, catchy, fun, it's an earworm.

**Awkward\_King** (10): me watching willy wonka and the chocolate factory

**becca** (10): no need for an explanation im a reveluv

**DaBigBoi** (10): This will really need any high score it can get.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This song is SO FUN I cannot get enough!!!

**hikkaru** (10): it's safe yeah but omgggg it bops so much

**mengzhongmeng** (10): my fav red velvet summer comeback! love the part with lyrical references to their older songs

**metanoira** (10): once again, summer velvet NEVER misses

**prada** (10): KOREAN HIGH NOTE UMPAH UMPAH UMPAH UMPAH UMPAH

**PSSST12** (10): We love High school musical in this house.

**seanderlust** (10): reading the translation, are red velvet leading a man to drown to his death in this song? the Sirens WISH they could sell like this tbh

**skargardin** (10): BOP!!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): the way I wrote an essay about this in #rates

**waluigiest** (10): each part of this song is well done

**ChickyDipper** (9.5): an underrated bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): I remember everybody was so disappointed with this when it came out because it felt like a basic SM summer comeback but I think it was just a victim of the hype, as time has gone on I’ve really come to love it. It’s so fun and really captures a feeling of carefree adventure

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.5): such a bop

**Victerade** (9.5): BANGER! best mv song from their reve festival triology. it never gets old for me even tho how repetitive it is and i really appreicate that

**sage** (9.3): wait this is growing on me..

**SkylarV** (9.2): Something unforgettable~

**Zypker125** (9.2): The superior version of Red Flavor, feel free to @ me

**anothertown** (9): umpah umpah is good. i WILL be on the right side of history

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this is SO sweet and fun

**en#8502** (9): this is good! idgaf!

**flavasavavandal** (9): This is just an S Club 7 song

**Kwcty6888** (9): I miss summer

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Another banger that gets maligned for no reason when all it did was serve summer bop.

**welcome2thejam** (9): The little "ding!" in the second verse might be my favorite song moment in the whole rate

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): why did I remember this being horrible? it's lovely. a great summer bop

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8.5): it was kinda forgettable but it slayed

**LesApfels** (8.5): The mv came out like half an hour before one of my finals and I had the chorus stuck in my head while attempting trigonometry

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): high school musical 2 vibes

**TiltControls** (8.5): I don't really love the Umpah Umpah effect, but the rest of the song is so good it doesn't really matter

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): god it's just so much fun

**MimisChoice9763** (8.2): enjoy the HSM vibes very much

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): it’s *cute*,  idc. their harmonies are fantastic. the verse bass is sick.

**2dina3dworld** (8): I once had a dream that I drowned while this played in the background

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a good song that definitely isn’t “forgettable” but I wouldn’t go all the way to “unforgettable” either.

**brpr425** (8): Hot take but this song is a great time! It always puts me in a good mood and I've looped it quite a bit.

**bulforster** (8): bop!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the parts where they umpah are the worse parts, makes me think of oompah loompahs. Everything else is good

**lalafairy18** (8): Underrated bop

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this song might be about sex

**SatC1** (8): this cute

**vaguelycatshaped** (8): Love its energy

**xedophobic** (8): it was a cute moment!

**-mczrv-** (7.8): enjoy this song more than expected every single time

**ggal2020** (7.5): even their worst song fucks

**jasannn** (7.5): Why did Twice’s Scientist steal this prechorus?

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): this was better than i remembered

**notarobot3675** (7.5): a cute song that reminds me of highschool musical

**yatcho** (7.5): even a mediocre RV release is mostly just a catchy bop [2]

**chancehugs** (7): I feel like I would've loved the song more if they didn't make it so cute. The rap calling back their old songs was cute, but not very exciting.

**Cooler\_lin** (7): i love the summertime and this song reminds of summer so...also its catchy and really fun to sing along to

**CrimsonROSET** (7): girl just go to the beach the rain isnt gonna stop you

**cuttackone** (7): REALLY underrated

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Umpah Umpah really took a while to grow on me. Even then, the song is quite weak as it doesn’t particular stand-out in their discography. This is not a bad song but it’s one of those songs that I wished it was better and knowing Red Velvet, they can definitely do better.

**ebooks#5454** (7): i almost would prefer if they were saying "oompa loompa" instead bc wtf is an umpah umpah

**frogaranaman** (7): I wanna know what the process is behind writing kpop songs I just KNOW the concept boarding on this one is hilarious

**milkywayinradius** (7): i don't like the word umpah but then again that's how i felt about jopping and now i'm always jopping

**mimins** (7): a nice song to listen to if you're just chillin

**pig-serpent** (7): They really thought they were on to the next Oogga Chakka here. The rest of the song is pretty good, but both the Umpah and the Ooh pa pas are dragging this down quite a bit.

**RaphaelArthur** (7): great song but not memorable enough for some reasons

**sabooyah** (7): Average good, but forgettable.

**superr\_rad** (7): I feel similarly about this song as I do about Power Up, there just seems to be something missing. The chorus definitely saves it tho

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this makes me want to go on holidays

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): K-pop groups will make the coolest song you’ve ever heard and then instantly make it 100% more lame by calling it “Oompa Loompa” or some shit EDIT: OK I looked at the lyrics and apparently "umpah" really means something in Korean so this song gets a pass

**cremeebrulee** (6.8): this did not feel like a real song

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (6.5): they just wanted to enjoy summer

**ke1per** (6.5): traumatized by RBB to think that synth in the intro was another whistle note

**LilacDaffodils** (6.5): sounds like a live action disney song. Still cute

**Round\_Log401** (6.5): This took me two years to like. Not my fave but catchy. Sounds like a HSM song.

**savemeaseat143** (6.5): it's times like these when I wish more people knew about their b-sides

**toyletpauper** (6.5): A bit boring, but still a nice song.

**rikarikachan** (6.4): Whatever, summer bop, could do without the umpah umpah part

**-chilazon-** (6): It's good but also meh. Contrary to what the lyrics say, this track is pretty forgettable. Also the umpah umpah part is annoying, which I'd be more forgiving of if I liked the rest of the song more.

**bespectacIed** (6): wholesome

**Nixon4Prez** (6): Red Flavor this is not

**rubbie** (6): Fun bop but I feel I've heard that chorus a hundred times before already.

ggsmackdown: # Are you sure this is something unforgettable, girls? Some people don't seem to agree!

**astrologicalangel** (5.5): this is so much more annoying than Zimzalabim I'm sorry

**BasedButta** (5.5): really average its the definition of yeah i guess i can listen to it if i have to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): everytime they say umpah umpah it reminds me of the beginning of hooked on a feeling

**terrencelovescum** (5): love the prechorus. the umpah umpah turned real "you wouldn't let anybody speak and instead". would've been way higher without those unrelenting umpahs.

**thegirlin512** (5): I like the intro and the prechorus.

**RandomHypnotica** (4.6): this song is someone grabbing the edges of your mouth and forcing it into a smile

**1998tweety** (4): This is not as bad as I initially thought, but it is a bit underwhelming. Video is cute though.

**apatel27** (4): Advert music

**BooksAndWhisky** (4): If this was my alarm tone I wouldn’t even need to snooze I’d just sleep right through it

**runaway3212** (4): naurrr

**whoisValensi** (4): What did I fucking say about trying to recreate Red Flavor! Good news, it's better than Power Up. Bad news, it's still bad. But at least I wouldn't mind this one if it came on in the background or smth I guess.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): They really set themselves up with “something unforgettable"

**bluetriangles04** (3): After the insane comeback of Zimzalabim, I suppose a balancing act had to occur, but it led to the most boring title track in Red Velvet's discography. Although it has redeemable parts within the pre-chorus and the buildup, Umpah Umpah is a stain on Red Velvet's discography during the 3 day series.

**GREY** (3): HATED FOR NO REASON! A cute song for the summer but now?.. lol

**JohnnyToby** (3): there was a time where I really thought RV would never make a good song I was so afraid

**DefaultPophead** (2): This has to be a joke at this point. If this song reflects their discography, I'd rather give up kpop than dive in. And yes, that means giving up my meow meows, GOT7. I'd give them up before listening to Red Velvet again. I'm sorry, Yugyeom.

**wavingwolves** (6.9): An unapologetic lesbian song? In my Girl Group rate? It's more likely than you think!! I like this a fair bit and it's probably the song I most enjoy from the last few releases from (G)I-DLE. They kind of lost the footing for me after their first few releases, but I do like both this and Lion and I understand the appeal of them as a group, and I also understand what might make their music unappealing as well. The members have very distinctive unique voices and Soyeon absolutely kills at being the face of the group, and in this song in particular her charisma shines through. Her energy here is unmatched, she really owns this song like no one has a right to.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): I actually LOVED this song when it first came out but within half a year it had already aged like milk for me LMAO. I still like it somewhat but the empty chorus does ruin things for me a bit. Minnie served the house down boots mawma btw

---

# OH MY GOD!!!! OH MY GOD!!!!

**mimins** (11): the progression into the chorus....i ascended!!!! it just got better and better!! plus the mv......a hit!!! a banger!!!!

**-chilazon-** (10): One of the best choruses in kpop. This song is such a journey

**1998tweety** (10): the structure for this song is kinda weird but I love it. wlw anthem

**becca** (10): their best song?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Valley girl realness!

**Cooler\_lin** (10): i was fighting for my life between this and three other songs as my favorite. I started doing the ranking for this on 01/04 but after I heard this song I took a break and listened to it on loop for three days. the storybook intro/outro> the antidrop > just wish the final chorus matched the outro rather than getting more upbeat

**DraculaWeekend** (10): That slurp in the rap verse is iconic

**GREY** (10): thee hyperpop slay omgg i cant with those silly xcx stans running around listening to that beep boop dog shit when this anthem exists

**lady\_sable** (10): soojin is so good here...cube stop fucking over your ggs challenge

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): the oh my Gooodddd~ is beyond iconic. Classiest dark concept ever.

**mengzhongmeng** (10): hot hot hot sapphic anthem

**moonagenightmares** (10): gay

**reiichitanaka** (10): Lesbian anthem aside, it’s a fucking great song. Not quite as good as Lion, but close (Lion would be my 11 if it was in the rate)

**rubbie** (10): Queen stuff. Soyeon is a genius.

**runaway3212** (10): YAASSS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): that awkward moment when I expected to hate this, based off its reputation and not loving the last two Idle song… and then I became fascinated by this weird-ass experience. Yes it’s messy, yes they’re trying too hard, yes it’s camp.

**savemeaseat143** (10): I remember seeing people complain that it builds up to nothing. I disagree, the lowkey chorus is perfect. This was the first Idle song I heard and I watched so many of their stages for it.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): lets go lesbians

**thegirlin512** (10): This is another eleven contender. It's one of my favorite releases from 2020 for a good reason. (Plus it makes my little lesbian heart very happy.)

**whoisValensi** (10): LET'S! GO! LESBIANS! (I'm allowed to say that since my mom thinks I'm one. But jokes are on her I'm trans and like men.)

**ChickyDipper** (9.8): this would be a 10 (possibly even my 11) if not for Soyeon's lick at the end of her rap

**CaptainDaisyG** (9.5): I feel an intense need to protect this song.

**KoolFunk** (9.5): I doubt there's anyone on this list as talented as Jeon Soyeon.

**rikarikachan** (9.3): Oh my god indeed

**anothertown** (9): this is sooo twilight soundtrack

**chancehugs** (9): The way they sing "Oh my god" is weirdly orgasmic. I could totally imagine a sensual rework of the song like Beyonce's Crazy In Love for 50 Shades of Grey.

**DefaultPophead** (9): Oh my god this stands out from the other songs on the rate. Could've been my eleven if that weird slurp rap verse from Soyeon was cut. Anyways, I've never heard kpop like this. Very interesting. Genuinely think Minnie might be the best vocalist in kpop right now. Don't let me know if she has a bullying scandal, but please tell me if she's funny.

**JohnnyToby** (9): awr gahd

**ke1per** (9): the church bell, the ominous bass transition to that bright piano, the anti drop, the harmonies on the back of that bridge are *muah*

**notallslendermen** (9): Iconic sapphic anthem

**rotating3Dtext** (9): lesbian song

**Round\_Log401** (9): Have never heared a song like this before, so different, creative, mysterious & eerie. So aesthetically pleasing.

**superr\_rad** (9): as a sapphic, I love the English version. Minnie opening and closing the song is just so beautiful and haunting, it really communicates the feeling of desperation. oh god

**terrencelovescum** (9): the bass drop in the chorus? lovely! wait the AKALI THAT GIRL, KALI GO GRR girl is in this group...it's all coming together.

**waluigiest** (9): one of the best choruses of the rate

**BasedButta** (8.5): oh hell yeah whos the lesbian that wrote this

**TiltControls** (8.5): This song just sounds so cool I don't know how else to describe it

**vaguelycatshaped** (8.5): It grew on me a lot

**2dina3dworld** (8): This song was an ambitious change in direction for Siouxsie and the Banshees, but I don’t hate it

**akanewasright** (8): This is horrendous, but in a fun way

**ggal2020** (8): soyeon marry me please

**ivyleaf33** (8): yuqi's voice is a blessing to kpop

**Jhe116** (8): Not really feeling this one but points for making a gay anthem

**metanoira** (8): sapphic

**PSSST12** (8): ehhhhh a little divisive but It grew on me

**sabooyah** (8): So different. The mixing on this is crazy and the instruments and layers were masterfully arranged.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i love how dark and ominous this one sounds

**DaHumanTorch** (7.8): aur moi gawdddd

**Zypker125** (7.6): This has one of the weakest choreos of 4th gen, the members barely move around in the choreo at all and it is so clear that they are relying on the backup dancers to make the choreo look interesting.

**2l82bstr8** (7.5): there's three different good songs here and none of them go well with each other (sure I already hear you saying "but it's kpop what did you expect" but sometimes the dissonance works and feels intentional. this just doesn't)

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): gay rights

**en#8502** (7.5): this is the WORST example of an antidrop EVER. you had such a promising verse and prechorus (thus 7.5) just for you to fuck it up like that ikyfl

**prada** (7.5): bop but not as boppy as it used to be

**RaphaelArthur** (7.5): amazing vocals but music not catchy or full enough

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): should’ve rated “lion” so i could’ve given it a TEN, dammit. again, i mostly liked the prechorus and the rap verse. final chorus was best chorus

**Victerade** (7.5): aged bad

**anagalisgv** (7): i cannot with the 'oh my gaaawd'

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): wait is this song gay I need to know

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): im scared

**cuttackone** (7): soyeon kills it but its more show than substance

**welcome2thejam** (7): I like the rap verses better with this more understated beat, and they still keep the capacity to ramp things up in the pre-chorus, not to mention this anti-drop actually feels worth it after the build

**pig-serpent** (6.5): This is just okay but the fact that it's not trying to overwhelm all my senses is worth a lenient rating.

**yatcho** (6.5): some elements of this are great especially the prechorus but that non-chorus just sucks up all the energy

**cherryices** (6.4): prechorus is the best part of this. also the blatant homosexuality

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.1): the beat and chorus is fun but also  kind of bland

**agentofscranton** (6): lesbian?

**Bryoneehhh\_** (6): it was lesbian and that was it

ggsmackdown: # aur my gaurrrrrrrrd........


**hikkaru** (6): aur my gaurrrrrrrrd........

**ignitethephoenix** (6): queens of not knowing how to do a chorus

**lalafairy18** (6): I never really got over that slurping sound at the end of the rap verse

**Roxieloxie** (6): while listening to this group i found out that ariana grande wrote both ice cream and motivation and i think that was more interesting that anything sonically that happened

**rslashpoopheads** (6): It's a little known fact that this song actually served as the inspiration for the infamous 2013 album Artpop by Lady Gaga.

**skargardin** (6): oh my god what an anticlimatic chorus

**vayyiqra** (6): I mostly like this but the half-tempo chorus was a bad idea

**poemforsmallthings** (5.9): This song frustrates me. I like how the prechorus escalates until it feels so grand and intense but the anti-drop never really worked for me here. But Minnie sounds great


**bulforster** (5.6): I want to be kinder to this one because it's at least trying stuff but it has such a nothing ending that dropped the score by like a whole point on its own.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this sounds like a song that would get slowed down for a movie trailer

**ImADudeDuh** (5): out of all the people in the world

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I was chilling until the first “oh my GAWWWD” and I don’t think I ever recovered

**apatel27** (4): What an anticlimatic chorus

**hunnybee12** (4): the slurp ....

**RandomHypnotica** (3.6): outside of the choruses this is nice… but those choruses… actually sickeningly bad

**DaBigBoi** (3.5): The chorus seriously kills so much momentum and then goes back to the verses expecting us to be fine with what we heard.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Oh yikes that chorus was not it

**throwaway-7650** (3.3): anyway lion outsold. stream it (and OMG - guerilla)!

**brpr425** (3): The drop kills this song for me, not a fan at all

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): The chorus of Oh my god I really hate

**flavasavavandal** (3): bad combination of awkward and dour

**thedoctordances1940** (2.8): tf is this bro

**frogaranaman** (2): this sucks sorry

**SatC1** (2): I don't like this sound. didn't enjoy lion either

**cremeebrulee** (1): this actually sounds like it’ll build up to something decent and in comes the worst hook of all time

**sage** (1): they really made a song called oh my god boring as fuck... they were the blueprint for adele

**SkylarV** (1): They made some choices with this song and I do not like any of them

**Stryxen** (1): omfg she sounds like camila bye

**bespectacIed** (0): /tyra banks voice/ this is so bad, I wanted to give you a zero, and that IS possible, so I give you a zero

**BooksAndWhisky** (0): If pretentious wine drinking strictly classical music listening Bukowski loving folks were a song they would be Oh My God

**ebooks#5454** (0): genuinely did not think i'd give a zero to a non-blackpink song and i genuinely did not think i'd find a group i'd hate more than blackpink; this m/v is unnerving like straight up makes me uneasy i think the artistic vision got lost in translation but moreso video aside,,,,,,,tHE SONG ISN'T REALLY THAT GOOD EITHER augh i was really hoping that wouldn't be the case but OH MY GOD ON GOD THIS IS BOOTYCHEEKS it attacked me and my family personally and made me hate women even more than how bp made me

**jasannn** (0): kpop girl crush at its worst

**wavingwolves** (10): Discord #rate'rs seem to feel really strongly about this song if the messages I saw there are to show... Still, it's not that controversial and managed to be late day 1, which I'll take it as a win anyway. I personally have always loved this song and I have always loved EXID.They're an incredible group with a a really strong discography and sound that are deeply missed because no one else does now what they were doing when they were active (well, apart from Apink with [Dilemma](https://youtu.be/RP4lbSymeZ4), a song released just this week which actually reminds me of I Love You in structure, but might be more enjoyable to the haters since it's missing the voice sample). In any case, this was an amazing release and I deeply miss them and their cunty charisma and pussy popping music.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): A shame that EXID's music was basically all misses for me in this time period - if we rated one of their earlier songs instead, I probably would have given that a 10. The main thing for me with this song is how annoying the hook is, I like everything else djsjs. LE remains queen!

# [체리블렛 (Cherry Bullet) - 'Love So Sweet' MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OZPwJdl_4w)

**fadedblue09** (11): My favorite group! Honestly I have no idea how they’ll fare this time with such a stacked list (and apparently some people hate this). Anyway, this song pretty much captures their brand perfectly: each member is distinctive in their own parts and yet it all comes together in the end. Up to this day, I’m still looking for groups that give the same vibe as they do.

**rikarikachan** (11): I LOVE YOU LIKE LALALALALALALAL AH YEAH This song is my JAM. BEST EXID SONG. Thank you thank you thank you for including it. The 11 had tough competition and this song won out because oh my god, it's I Love You by EXID. It's literally perfect.

**-chilazon-** (10): I've never heard this before but it's DELICIOUS

**-mczrv-** (10): love you too! Top tier song and top tier m/v

**2l82bstr8** (10): just the most gorgeous chorus

**akanewasright** (10): Yeah this sounds like an Old Navy ad song but maybe I’d go to more Old Navy’s if they had this playing!!!

**becca** (10): EXID WE LOVE YOU.

**bespectacIed** (10): So fun and colorful. Not my fave song of them tbh but im giving a 10 as a prayer circle for their comeback... cuz EXID legit has one of the strongest discogs in kpop, I am not kidding. They're up there at the top 5 with rv, loona, snsd, f(x) for me. Street is a top 5 kpop album of all time too

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i love the house influence in this soooo much ugh EXID are like in my top 3 girl groups and i love them so much

**lady\_sable** (10): feel like pure shit just want them back x

**mengzhongmeng** (10): ummmm hani in the second verse is a major serve, mv is great love when they let the girls get a bit fun and dirty

**rslashpoopheads** (10): All Up & Down clones are 10s in my book.

**sage** (10): YASSSS EXID QUEENS we miss you

**throwaway-7650** (10): the beat during hani's part after the 1st chorus... I died

**vivianlight** (10): My favorite song from this group

**whoisValensi** (10): Ah finally some representation for my elders!!! Now my 7+ years a K-pop fan ass doesn't have to feel so alienated out here with all these newbie groups!!! /s Oh and one more thing... Guys I think I want EXID back... I MISS THEM. I miss a lot of 2nd Gen and early 3rd Gen groups aaaaaaaaaa

**xedophobic** (10): intense flashbacks of this being on loop yup yup

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): i miss them so much. a group with one of the most rad collection of distinct voices

**bigbigbee** (9.5): don’t get me started on my “more sexy concepts in k-pop, but like the ethical kind, but PLEASE more” rant, I’ll just bore you and my coffee will get cold

**celladonn** (9.5): Bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): A good song, feels like something from a forgotten ‘00s Europop diva. My only complaint is that the transition between the verses and the chorus is too abrupt but both individual pieces are good so I can overlook that.

**1998tweety** (9): bop farewell song

**billie\_\_** (9): incredibly consistent quality for a kpop group, exid rarely missed and i miss them.

**bookthieving** (9): we need more drunk girl in a bathroom energy in kpop

**DaBigBoi** (9): That sample is genius idgaf

**ivyleaf33** (9): i need a fun, mature girl group with great music to step up and fill the void that exid left asap, i miss them so much already.

**RaphaelArthur** (9): catchy, strong identity and amazing delivery

**seanderlust** (9): https://rave.dj/gG5IWnX0FKQfuA

**toyletpauper** (9): I Love You uses the same template as most of their title tracks since the fame from Up & Down. And it’s a great format. Although I do prefer Up & Down, I Love You still shines amazingly with a great chorus and even better verses.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.8): the chorus is what saves it for me

**dlong56655** (8.5): I miss them

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Finally, some fucking delicious food.

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.3): Nobody will ever match your big dick energy

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): everything about this is camp

**chancehugs** (8): It's a good song. I like it.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): we love to see mommies getting over a hangover

**DefaultPophead** (8): Oooh that hook really gets you... I don't like this song but it possessed me and made me give it a high score.

**ebooks#5454** (8): mentally ill bitches rise up !

**en#8502** (8): still remember when i first heard this and i was absolutely floored by that repetitive hook. #SORRY

**ke1per** (8): very catchy, great verses

**mimins** (8): the girl with short hair in the mv is so pretty and cool omg also this song is soooo second gen I love it

**rotating3Dtext** (8): the mv is amazing

**rubbie** (8): I can hear flashes of greatness, perhaps it's the classic melodramatic chorus, or the annoyingly catchy "lalalala" that follows, idk but it somehow works

**runaway3212** (8): Yasss

**sabooyah** (8): Everything about this is so second gen kpop I love it. LE is still an underrated rapper.

**savemeaseat143** (7.8): never underestimate the power of kpop songwriters to make a great hook

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): The *i love you like lalala* part and the chorus are so catchy. Hani's part in the second verse..she did that. I just wish the chorus matched the vibe of the rest of the song a bit better.

**MToms** (7.5): would be more if not for the grating hook

**anarkyah** (7): Very unique

**BasedButta** (7): great chorus with some unusual verses but it came out good enough

**brpr425** (7): Parts of this song are amazing and parts are kinda annoying but it averages out to be a pretty good song

**Bryoneehhh\_** (7): i remember being obsessed with this but i don’t get it now

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (7): their least interesting song tbh

**nt96** (7): Love the beat switch ups, but that I love you refrain is annoying af

**prada** (7): cute

**vayyiqra** (7): how many "la"s is that did anyone count

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): To me there’s a very big discrepancy between the “I love you like la la la” sound and the rest of the song, like it sounds cool but also a bit out of place

**Victerade** (7): aged soooo bad for me im sorry

**Zypker125** (7): EXID's best song easily (which says a lot, I know).

**moonagenightmares** (6.7): exid has great songs but this aint really it

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I can't tell how annoying that hook is

**2dina3dworld** (6.4): the “I love you like” part goes on for far too long, it would’ve been cute if it was once or twice or maybe a bit shorter but it goes on for fucking ever.

**apatel27** (6): 2010 vibes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): The “I Love You Like La La La La La” is fun…the first few times.

**DraculaWeekend** (6): I wish the chorus was like the verses

ggsmackdown: # [4MINUTE(포미닛) - 싫어(Hate) MV](https://youtu.be/D_F9HUTYnl0)

**ggal2020** (6): the first time I ever listened to exid was during a bad trip and now everytime I see them do that hip thrust dance I feel dark forces around me. exid has never done anything wrong but I can’t stand them. also hani’s movie was bad and not as gay as promised. UPDATE: I listened to up & down on loop for the last month and I love it now. this song still isn’t that good though.

**Nixon4Prez** (6): Not their best, not their worst

**SatC1** (6): miss them

**thGnerd** (6): Relatively boring to me 

**TiltControls** (6): I can't say the feeling is mutual unfortunately

**intheaftermath** (5.5): I'm so torn on this one. I LOVE the chorus, it's so happy and sounds like Valentine's Day. But god, I hate the "I Love You Like" beat

**anothertown** (5): now this is wacky

**ImADudeDuh** (5): if you love me like this, i’d want a breakup

**Awkward\_King** (4): i like the hook and thats kinda it

**cuttackone** (4): never cared about it

**DaHumanTorch** (4): girl that chorus was horrific. the verses did tug at me a little though

**ignitethephoenix** (4): half this song is terribly annoying and the other half is just mid

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): ngl this is a little boring

**GREY** (3): i would consider k wording someone if hani asked me to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): the instrumental is reminding me of friday night funkin. i hate friday night funkin

**waluigiest** (3): I love you like a La La La La La La love song

**hikkaru** (2): NO!!! I HATE YOU

**lalafairy18** (2): Although the "I love you like" part is catchy I feel like they used it wayyyy too much in the verses

**welcome2thejam** (2): The "I love you" hook is so grating that it brings everything down hard. MV's pretty fun though

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): this is pretty annoying

**flavasavavandal** (1): Haha that vocal sound thing is bad enough but every other vocal line is underwhelming

**Stryxen** (1): what the FUCK is this every time i thought it was as bad as it gets it got worse

**thedoctordances1940** (1): fucking hell there's so much wrong with this, every part of the song feels completely disjoint from the rest and then the mixing makes absolutely no attempt to transition them. On top of that the chorus also has utterly atrocious mixing, it literally sounds like it's coming out of phone speakers and then there's still that annoying sample/vocal things idk that's also terrible. Who approved this?

**thegirlin512** (1): I don't get this one. Bad vocal affects, weird lyrics, and a boring instrumental.

**bulforster** (0): the way this song shifts from annoying to boring so fast and so often

**CrimsonROSET** (0): that sample sounds like a tiktok audio that should be exterminated

**pig-serpent** (0): Weird voices and poor production make this song extremely grating to listen to.

**terrencelovescum** (0): GO TO HELL NAUGHTY BOY AND SAM SMITH!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): CLASSIC EUROTRASH!! The girls that get it get it and the girls that don't...

**wavingwolves** (6.2): I'll be honest and say I don't really know what to say about DIA, really. They have one of the most boring discographies I've ever heard, the first few albums feel like the same song over and over with the titles trying to make up for it but not suceeding, and they have a really messy group organization on top of it, with 4 members being out of the group at this point in time and their most popular member being on hiatus since the release of this song. Two members of this group went to Produce 101, a little after their debut in DIA, probably to gain more traction and attention. One of them, Chaeyeon, made to the line-up and Huihyeon, who went by Cathy, at least got very decent screentime. Chaeyeon end up being very popular both in the show and even more during her time in I.O.I. She was the reason why the concept of [ending fairy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/784125484166152232/944032484901941268/unknown.png) (designed term to the member who gets the last few seconds of a performance in the form close-ups to their face) got so popularized in the K-Pop industry, when [a clip of hers](https://npomv.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/172d23462a5df1c9eb736ca2ffd683a9.gif) at the end of a Produce 101 [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2JrPCGwEE) became viral. Also, they named their fans "AIDs" which will be forever both hilarious and an extremely poor choice.

# WooWoo > Superlove

**Awkward\_King** (11): this smacked me over the head, the intro brought me back in after i was kinda losing steam in the rate and the chorus is like electric i love it, no brain no thoughts only pussy and pussy only

**anothertown** (10): omfg that cheerleading mix synth is SO good

**bluetriangles04** (10): WOOWA is absolutely one of my favorite songs of all time, and for good reason. A dance pop masterpiece, delivered by a K-Pop group I thought was sure to fizzle out long ago thanks to their awful label. Thankfully, DIA has stuck around in the end to release a multitude of some pretty interesting music, whether it be songs stirring beef with Tinashe, iconic enough to lead to a contestant of Produce 101 covering it as their entry song RIGHT IN FRONT of participating DIA members, or paired with a Harry Potter concept with god awful CGI.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): forgive me tinashe for i have sinned

**en#8502** (10): i can't believe i didn't like this back then what the hell was wrong with me

**GREY** (10): aid nation we won. Queen cathy saw an opportunity to steal from a nugu artist and snatched it! Used the funds made from that thievery to make another anthem oh shes a business woman! Obsessed with her mind

**JohnnyToby** (10): I can't help but giggle when hearing the intro thanks to Twitter but like fuck it it's good ty chaeyeon and cathy

**pig-serpent** (10): Good blend of 90's rave music and 10's rave music.

**sage** (10): absolute smasha they served camp

**throwaway-7650** (10): ended momoland and their shitty comebacks after baam

**whoisValensi** (10): DIA is probably one of the most interesting Post I.O.I groups to me because their stuff never particularly took off and I think the most talk I've heard about them is the time they copied Tinashe's entire 'Superlove' video and song... Anyways this is a banger. Imagine if we were rating Mr. Potter tho, that would be iconic lol.

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): MBK IS THE WORST ENTERTAINMENT IN THE KPOP INDUSTRY. DIA DESERVED BETTER! DIA WILL REMAIN IN OUR HEARTS <3 - nccv3

**bulforster** (9.3): mario party minigame type beat

**Zypker125** (9.3): Shoutouts to the rate hosts for picking DIA's best song by far.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.2): good song. Wrong released time

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): their tinashe cosplay is better but this is still great

**1998tweety** (9): BOP ended Tinashe

**anagalisgv** (9): hold on I've never heard this song before but it's so good??

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oowa owaa owaawe

**PSSST12** (9): eventhough they are kinds mid as a group this kinda bops ngl

**RandomHypnotica** (9): that post chorus is equal parts obnoxious and catchy

**runaway3212** (9): YAS!

**waluigiest** (9): so bad it’s good

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): what the *hell*, dude???

**yatcho** (8.8): ok I only knew them from their mediocre Tinashe ripoff, this is a bop actually

**RaphaelArthur** (8.5): great song, addicting and fun, but could be better

**Victerade** (8.5): v fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is one of my favorite synth lines/breakdowns (???) in this rate.

**chancehugs** (8): Really dig the mix of trance music with middle eastern influences.

**DefaultPophead** (8): The hook kinda sounds like a Crash Bandicoot sample remixed for a runway show and I'm living for it.

**pornypete** (8): manifesting DIA cb this year!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): aint woowa kim petra’s ad lib

**vayyiqra** (8): didn't Loona already do this song "Wow" :zany_face:

**BooksAndWhisky** (7.5): What the hell is the rap verse after the chorus

**ChickyDipper** (7.5): Your AIDs miss you DIA 💔

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): bass goes crazy..a little party banger, great chorus

**thGnerd** (7.5): I also think DIA deserved better

**SkylarV** (7.4): This prechorus/chorus a-section really savages this otherwise mess of a song

**akanewasright** (7.3): This beat fucks but it does most of the heavy lifting here

**apatel27** (7): Some choices were made for the beat. Some of which work pretty well tbh

**BasedButta** (7): i appreciate the effort but its nothing special feels like a missed opportunity because the chorus is great

**becca** (7): dia we miss you.. kinda!

**bigbigbee** (7): Of all the IOI groups, I think that DIA has the best run of title tracks (maybe tied with WJSN). Unfortunately, this is my least favorite of all of them :’( It’s still clearly really good though, and I understand why people would LOVE this (I love electrotrash too, it just doesn’t 100% click for me here)

**ivyleaf33** (7): i like to think listening to kpop's made my noise tolerance pretty high, but this was just erring on the side of too much

**mengzhongmeng** (7): fun!

**mimins** (7): good song but I forget what it sounds like until it comes on again

**rubbie** (7): Shinsadong Tiger already perfected this type of supreme dance pop with T-ara back in the day, so he's treading on known territory here, but it's still a fun tune.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Gonna 1v1 you to this track

**jasannn** (6.8): Momoland but making it in a club

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I really wish I had been filming myself when “The Boots” ended and this began because I literally looked like the lady doing math meme… like what is this team, what’s happening here… oh wait the chorus hit okay I get it now… wait okay the post-chorus is happening it’s bad again… okay wait the second verse is happening and it’s worse… thank you for reading this summary of a reaction video that doesn’t exist

**ke1per** (6): retro snake charmer vibes

**Roxieloxie** (6): what in the tom and jerry

**sabooyah** (6): Overall good, but doesn't really grab my attention nor do I remember it well after listening to it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s okayyyyy

ggsmackdown: # Tinashe alt accounts 

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.8): all i can think of is that compilation of Owen Wilson saying wow

**poemforsmallthings** (5.7): chaeyeonbot we miss you dearly

**moonagenightmares** (5.4): mr. potter outsold

**babadork** (5.3): I love a retro throwback but combining the Mortal Kombat theme with the soundtrack to A Night at the Rockbury might be taking things too far.

**thegirlin512** (5): It's not bad but it's not very catchy. The intro and verses fall a bit flat compared to the chorus.

**-mczrv-** (4.5): hmmmm

**2l82bstr8** (4.5): I can't stand DIA in any capacity sorry to all the AIDs

**alwayswords** (4): worst beat drop in music history

**Bryoneehhh\_** (4): i do not get it

**letsallpoo** (4): this song is fun for like the first 10 seconds. also tinashe

**bespectacIed** (3): This song was a menace on stan twitter lol

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (3): sounded like the preset backtrack on my thirty dollar keyboard

**cuttackone** (3): dito

**frogaranaman** (3): this made me anxious idky

**Round\_Log401** (2): Respectfully, I think it sounds cheap & feels outdated. I really don't like the instrumental part of the chorus where they don't sing. They look very pretty though.

**Flippantry** (1): This was a chore to listen to

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Me: I want T-ARA. Mom: We have T-ARA at home. T-ARA at home:

**terrencelovescum** (1): just beyond messy and obnoxious. the random flute part in the middle. the circus like intro. turn off the radio - mdna.

**wavingwolves** (9.1): Didn't like this upon release, grew to like it because I had to relisten to it because of this rate and now I love it. I especially love it because of the instrumental and production here, in specific because of that one descend synth that comes on during the verses that makes my brain itch a little bit. Still, I think that overall this was a pretty strong era by them and it made me regain hope that I would come to enjoy their music again as I once did before, since I actually liked the [12:00] in way I hadn't since the release of [+ +]. But, well, the following release was...

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): Admittedly a song I didn’t really care for when it first released, but when the rate was first announced I was listening to the playlist and was like “wait actually this song is a bop”. Honestly I’m not sure why this song kinda flopped here, I think it was something fun, something for the summertime…

---

# What do you mean why not? It's a YASS for us

**MimisChoice9763** (11): it grew enormously on me the song sounds like an epic sci fy movie especially the last drop

**TiltControls** (11): This sounds like 3 songs frankenstein'd together but luckily all 3 of them are also 11s

**akanewasright** (10): I keep thinking this song is like a continuation of so what’s sound but then I remember that it has like… enjoyability

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): yeah

**bespectacIed** (10): I unironically adore this, so damn catchy and stupid and FUN. I expect nothing more from kpop. 12:00 is an excellent album btw 10/10 fuck the haters

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): the girls that get it get it and the girls that don’t don’t but x2

**cherryices** (10): hyunjin baby you are giving me the cha cha slide and i love you for it!

**fadedblue09** (10): This song finally convinced me to see the appeal of Loona. ThE disorienting structure threw me off at first, but it's fun and the wackness allows them to show  off some personality

**glitter408** (10): this song is so catchy

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i heard the “lets pump it up!” part from gay memes before i knew what this song was

**KoolFunk** (10): I had a hard time listening to every song because I kept coming back to this one

**lady\_sable** (10): congrats to loona for being the first artists to film on the moon!

**lalafairy18** (10): didadumdidumdidum

**sage** (10): this song is so gay

**thegirlin512** (10): I love the intro and the beat. Another danceable bop.

**vayyiqra** (10): There was this viral tweet about how many songs by girl groups have them claiming to be "bad girls" for no reason and now every time I hear a song that does it I lol inside. Anyway, this song is a banger.

**waluigiest** (10): this??? Now this is pure joy

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.8): no one does lore like Loona

**en#8502** (9.5): LET'S PUMP IT UP!

**pleasegivemeasword** (9.5): this song is overhated

**anagalisgv** (9): the key change and instrumental additions in the last chorus are so fucking cool

**Awkward\_King** (9): i feel like i could beat up anyone who fought me rn

**cuttackone** (9): loving the witchy vibe and the bridge is otherworldy and a banger

**ebooks#5454** (9): DEE DA DUP DE DUP DE DA LET'S RATE IT UP!!!

**JsaKim** (9): OOH LA LA AH WAE AH WAE AH WAE

**PSSST12** (9): This is a rehash of some of their works but its fun.

**runaway3212** (9): Yasss

**sabooyah** (9): I feel like they took an Itzy song, aged it up slightly and made it better! I'm surprised at how much I like it. Very carefree and for some reason reminds me of 2012? In a good way.

**superr\_rad** (9): an underappreciated bop!!! I think a lot of Orbits that were around from predebut - xx eras aren’t keen on LOONA’s girl crush concepts but they pull it off so well. Di-da, dum-di-dum, di-dum. Dum, dum, dum, di-dam

**Tazzachar** (9): The hook in the chorus is perfect

**brokebutter** (8.8): fun song fun era fun choreo whats not to like

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): didadumdidumdidum dumdumdidum

**LesApfels** (8.5): The production on this didn't have to go so hard

**vaguelycatshaped** (8.5): One of the only 2 Loona tt I actually added to my playlist, and I love the build-up at the end

**jasannn** (8.2): Loona is lucky this song finally clicked with me last month.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): the bridge is the lowpoint for me, it’s *fine* at best i guess. liked the rest. and i'd be lying if i didn’t say “di da dam di dam di dam, dam dam dam di dam, ooh la la a wae a wae a wae, ooh la la waewae an dwae an dwae”, doesn’t get stuck in my head for *hours*

**2l82bstr8** (8): this one, I can understand the criticism for. there's just not a lot to it

**agentofscranton** (8): where does dwee da dam dee dam dee dam dam dam diggity dam fit into the loonaverse lore

**chancehugs** (8): This song is a hodgepodge of onomatopeias (ooh la la, di dum dum) and it oddly works. Gowon really got paid dust here.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): exactly now lets go cause a riot

**DaHumanTorch** (8): let's pump it up!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Why Not is basically the kind of song I was wishing to hear from So What. There are a bit of the common characteristics I see from Loona’s earlier music in this song while there is an attempt to make this more appealing to the mainstream public. I don’t think this song best defines LOONA the best, but I think this is still a good song nonetheless.

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Better

**GREY** (8): yes

**mimins** (8): this is really fun actually. i guess it has the down period I was craving from so what

**rikarikachan** (8): Huh, this is boppier than I thought. Good chorus drop.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): @NSWGOV let me go clubbing

**terrencelovescum** (8): the tweet saying that it sounded like a cunty version of the hampster dance was way too spot on and horrifying.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): this is the Kpop solar power

**-mczrv-** (7.6): yea why not!

**-chilazon-** (7.5): This one was so hard to rate. It's way too overwhelming, but I also kinda like it? It got better the more I listened to it.

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Just a bunch of fun! Would dance if I wasn't absolutely lazy!

**notarobot3675** (7.5): another song where i agree with the criticisms but for some reason it really works for me lol

**prada** (7.5): camp but in a meh way

**whoisValensi** (7.5): I'm gonna call this a trash bop because that's lowkey what it is. [Anyways shout out to Voltaren!](https://youtu.be/-IeP0iXTKqg)

**bulforster** (7.3): the bass drone wubbing all over the place during the outro is the best part

**poemforsmallthings** (7.3): https://twitter.com/ZeroColors_/status/1331062107484274689

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The verses and bridge really deserved a better chorus than this…

**bluetriangles04** (7): Three points docked for the horrendous "Ooh, la-la, awae awae awae"

**DaBigBoi** (7): I remember listening to the leak and being in disbelief at how disappointed I was. Glad that’s changed (maybe)!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): If they just focused in on the parts of this that are good it would be great

**ivyleaf33** (7): the mv aesthetics and my obsession with anti-choruses saved it for me

**MToms** (7): had heard only the humpty dumpty part before

**pig-serpent** (7): This would go off at a club but I wish there was more to this song.

**RaphaelArthur** (7): very good song but not very strong

**savemeaseat143** (7): at least Vivi got lines

**SkylarV** (7): Like So What, not bad, but a bit out there from them

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): better than the last two but it seems very try hard

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I think that being so annoying that you circle around to being catchy is an underrated technique, and it worked here

ggsmackdown: # Because they didn't like it :(


**toyletpauper** (6.5): This song could be so good, because I absolutely love the spacey vibe thing that’s in the intro and the final chorus. It’s just the normal chorus is pretty stupid.

**1998tweety** (6): the "ooh la la" part is the one saving grace of this song.

**BooksAndWhisky** (6): Better than So What, but I still can’t take the chorus seriously

**ChickyDipper** (6): ooh la la oh wei oh wei oh wei

**frogaranaman** (6): MIDSOMMAR ON THE MOON HELLO????

**Jhe116** (6): Reason no. 2 why we need Jaden Jeong’s difficult ass back because the girls still can’t rap

**notallslendermen** (6): I like the verses a lot but I just can't deal with the chorus... please let them have a real chorus for their next cb

**Round\_Log401** (6): Same here. The whole 'Di Da Dam' part is SO GOOD.

**skargardin** (6): well

**welcome2thejam** (6): A handful of this rate's entries are confirming how important nailing (at least not fumbling) your drop/anti-drop is, and this is a prime example. That anti-drop at the start of the chorus annoys the hell out of me and makes me actively dread the build-up on subsequent listens, even if the rest of the chorus is fantastic and it does thankfully recover enough to keep a positive overall score

**billie\_\_** (5): inexplicably reminds me of crazy frog.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): stan loona

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): they cannot be serious with that di dum dumdidum di dum chorus…

**BasedButta** (4.5): at least its not paint the town

**apatel27** (4): God that chorus is so annoying

**ke1per** (3.5): killing the moon was a bad idea

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3.5): kind of sounds like one of those bad mashups where you can hear too much of both songs and they don't really go together and it just sounds like a mess

**Cooler\_lin** (3): i know miss kim lip was mad when she heard this demo

**JohnnyToby** (3): r u a bad girl or not make up ur mind ladies

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): From the second I first heard this sound on tiktok I hated it… It’s like the 2020s version of the Trololo song

**flavasavavandal** (2): This is just So What’s ugly little sister with a worse chorus and less fun

**SatC1** (2): loona is not nct

**Zypker125** (1.7): They REALLY started to lose me when they reverted to the whole "I'm a bad girl" trend, instead of doing the creative pieces that they had been doing beforehand.

**maskchachki** (1.5): just a bad song. loona's music quality took a nose dive after jaden left.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Why was Loona included in this rate when we could have just included Chuu - Heart Attack and Choerry - Love Cherry Motion.

**throwaway-7650** (1): the reaction the flute in the NCT sticker tiktok teaser got was me to the chorus of why not? when it leaked along with the rest of 12:00

**yatcho** (1): It was was BAD for them when they dropped this itzy reject. Really cant find any redeeming qualities

**wavingwolves** (9.5): I have said this a billion times already, but gawd... if there's a group that deserved better it was Pristin. Honestly, no one that followed K-Pop back in 2017 would expect the ball to be dropped so hard by Pledis when it came to this group. Sure, Pledis was already known for not having the best business decisions, but Pristin truly had the potential to be grand from the get go and they were getting more than enough push for that before they even debuted. Pledis was getting some money from both the success Seventeen found at the time and also from both Nayoung and Kyulkyung making the I.O.I line-up. Kyulkyung, in particular, was *very* popular. Five other members of the group also participated on the Produce 101 survival show, and some were even able to get some good screentime out of it despite not making it in the end. They had massive pre-debut presence as Pledis Girlz, with the members featuring in OSTs, holding concerts, releasing covers and even a promotional single called [WE](https://youtu.be/9TMDWIy6-Jc) that helped to introduce the members. They even [produced](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/784125484166152232/944026366385483876/unknown.png) and [composed](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/784125484166152232/944026534660935730/unknown.png) their own music! And then, what happened? Well... No one can give you a straight asnwer, really. The one thing I'll tell you is that they had some messy times, brought on a lot of discourse, then were put into a hiatus they never left. Well, unless we count their time in [PRISTIN V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z3iyydFevQ), a sub-unit of the main group, their latest release under the name Pristin, that was all. Wait, no, not all, though! After the disbandment announcement, some of the members of Pristin went on to release a song called [DRIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_qrsewuTwo) under the group name HINAPIA, but they never released anything under that group again and disbanded the following year. 

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand PRISTIN. Their references are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of their third eye most of the opinions will go over a typical Kpoppie's head. There's also PRISTIN's artistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation - their personal philosophy draws heavily from SEVENTEEN drama, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of PRISTIN's minds, to realize that they're not just fierce- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who call PRISTIN bad truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the art in the WEE WOO MV "Breaking News: WEE WOO WEE WOO" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as PRISTIN's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a PRISTIN tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for Woozi's eyes only- and even he has to demonstrate that he's within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

**bespectacIed** (10): These post IOI songs making me sad from all the wasted potential smh. This was a smasher. Pristin tugged on twice's cutesy wig a little, they had such a promising future. Even the subunit Pristin V made one of the best kpop songs ever (Get It). Sighhhh

**bigbigbee** (10): It’s dumb as hell but it stands out in the sea of girl groups, and it’s perfect for me

**bluetriangles04** (10): IWILLNEVERFORGIVEYOUPLEDIS

**GREY** (10): i owe bumzu my life. You put your bussy into everything you do and i dont thank you enough for it. I love you my meowest

**JohnnyToby** (10): I blame we like for their downfall

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): deserved so much more

**rikarikachan** (10): they! are! pristin! annyeong~ Cutest freakin' song. Pure cutesy serotonin. jo, ah, hae, neol joahae, bu buuu

**rslashpoopheads** (10): My Joker moment was looping the teaser for this song 400 times the day before it came out.

**Zypker125** (9.3): Pristin's (two) title tracks were incredibly solid, and in general I think it goes incredibly understated how *talented* Pristin as a group was (nearly every member was incredibly well-rounded in vocals/dance/rap, and they had BY FAR the best facial expressions in the business when they were active, especially within the scope of 3rd gen groups)

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): ["I'd like to blow the balloon called you"](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/871872478513881129.gif)

**anzunagi** (9): What could have been I hate pledis

**becca** (9): oh i love this. UR MY SUPER SUPER HERO?!

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9): pristin was UNDERMINED hashtag kill pledis

**hunnybee12** (9): #PLEDIS_WE_NEED_ANSWERS

**lady\_sable** (9): pristin deserved so much better. fuck pledis all my homies hate pledis

**RaphaelArthur** (9): really great song on every aspect but could be better

**welcome2thejam** (9): Absolutely losing it at the "BREAKING NEWS: WEE WOO WEE WOO WEE WOO" in the MV

**whoisValensi** (9): #PRISTINDeservedBetter!!!! While their stuff may not have been everyone's cup of tea, they really crashed and burned so fast because Pledis sucks, and that sucks. And everything after the group too and has been... well if you know you know but wow some of these girls really got fucked over a bunch of times.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.9): such a shame they disbanded so easily. They had so much potential

**brokebutter** (8.8): top tier debut

**ChickyDipper** (8.8): from an objective standpoint this song is absolutely terrible. But it's also amazing. Wee woo wee woo wee RIP Pristin

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.7): It’s camp goodness, the girls that get it, get it

**-chilazon-** (8.5): This song is super weird . . .

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (6): I used to listen but grew to hate it lol KyulKyung was the only one I was there for

**thGnerd** (6): This song got worse with age

**throwaway-7650** (6): dino. https://gfycat.com/AmusingTatteredBluefintuna

**toyletpauper** (5.5): I would always be a PRISTIN fan but damn, was it hard with their discography…

**-mczrv-** (5): probably deserved better still

**DefaultPophead** (5): There is very little redeemable about this song. Only reason why it wasn't lower was that I had already scored most of the songs by this point, and I didn't think this was worse than the songs below it. If this was the first song I'd heard, it might've been as low as a two. And I probably wouldn't have cared enough to change it.

**fadedblue09** (5): Apolgies to Seventeen's sistren but this did not stand out to me

**pig-serpent** (5): I like the guitar, but overall the song sounds hollow.

**Round\_Log401** (5): Was never a big fan of Pristin, they're fun, just not my taste, catchy though.

**notallslendermen** (2): I'm sorry but this song is just awful. Pristin deserved so much better than this shit, such a waste of talent.

**terrencelovescum** (2): im sorry i just can't take the wee woo seriously

**bookthieving** (1): pristin should've debuted with roller coaster and this is a hill i will die on

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (0): I find no silver linings in this song. I hope I never hear it again.

**wavingwolves** (10): DESERVED BETTER! Especially now that this has the title of their disbandment song. As someone who's a big fan of the Lovelyz kind of sound and concept in its bright forms, I was slightly cynical of the idea of a darker concept being brought to the table, since a lot of the times what that does to a group is to turn them into its most mediocre form. In this case, I was surprised. I also understood the need for Lovelyz to mature, especially after their participation on the reality show [Queendom](https://youtu.be/9xtoBvavaEI) (where they were up against (G)I-DLE, MAMAMOO and OH MY GIRL for the first time before this rate and where they also deserved better than what they got), and I think they were able to mature their sound and look without leaving their signature sound behind completely. The key change and last chorus in this is absolutely magical too and it deserves to be talked about a lot more than it does!

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): This is the worst Lovelyz song in the rate to me. Even then, it’s by no means bad and I do still like it. For me personally, the key change at the end does a lot of heavy lifting and without that my score would probably be lower but whatever! As far as disbandment songs go, there are worse ways to exit.

# ObliviATEEEEEE!!!!!!

**anothertown** (10): smasher with an anti-drop and a key change RIP Lovelyz

**becca** (10): YASSSSSSSS BEST DISBANDMENT SONG

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): they need to come back

**GREY** (10): "oh we're beyonce"

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): you can really see how much they've matured over the years

**waluigiest** (10): the chorus is delicious

**whoisValensi** (10): I think I hear something... And I like it. HOLY SHIT THAT KEY CHANGE BITCHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**throwaway-7650** (9.8): they lived they served cunt they died (this is apple too)

**brokebutter** (9.7): concept change done well and the bsides are amazing

**AssailantArcturus** (9.5): rip lovelyz but obliviate is a banger

**bulforster** (9.5): that delicious post chorus really pushes this one over the top

**prada** (9.5): ohbleeveeATE!

**Victerade** (9.5): SLAYED AS MUCH AS THEY CAN BEFORE THE DISBANDMENT girl crush+christian music and they somehow made it work

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): served for the gays again

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**akanewasright** (9): the producers watched a few ASMR videos and wanted that energy

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I’m a big “cute concept” fan so I was nervous when they announced that Lovelyz were going with a more mature direction but I think they did a good job with this one, mainly because despite the darker tone they still stick to more or less the same sound palate that they always have (just dirtied up a bit). A shame they were so unceremoniously disbanded because I’m very curious what their next move would have been after this.

**hikkaru** (9): i hope lovelyz said trans rights after they made this the song title

**metanoira** (9): THIS was their unemployment song???

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): obsessed with the last chorus

**-chilazon-** (8.5): Pretty cool, smooth, don't love the second part of the chorus, but love everything else. The key change is pretty cool.

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): They really just decided to sing their hearts out, huh?

**fadedblue09** (8.5): oh this is a serve

**intheaftermath** (8.5): they really do sound a lot better when they're not sick <3

**poemforsmallthings** (8.2): They've never made a bad song but I can't believe this was their disbandment song

**rikarikachan** (8.1): Sick bass

**sage** (8.1): its good but like their weakest title

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This song has two choruses for the price of one!

**pornypete** (8): Maybe my favorite album of 2020. Obliviate is the weakest song on it imo, but it's still great.

**PSSST12** (8): They tried something new and it works for them.

**vayyiqra** (8): I went from "why are they saying 'obliviate' so weirdly" to " is that even a word outside of Harry Potter" to "who cares this slaps" so quickly.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Maybe not as distinct as the bubbly sound of Ah-Choo but personally I found it easier to listen to

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): wasn’t *that* into it until the little switch near the end

**BasedButta** (7.5): groovy but its missing something to make it shine

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): wishing i could another 5 on the end of the number but i cant and 7.6 is an ugly number. their best song on this rate, love the key change to a lower key

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): i-i-i-i-i obliviate when you call my name

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.4): gilderoy lockhart did it first

**yatcho** (7.3): Now I LOVE when a GG transitions from cutesy to more mature concepts, but the cute songs were better I fear

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): like fashion store music but DRAMATIC

**DaBigBoi** (7): I can’t tell if people will rate this higher than their other titles because it sounds more modern and less like them or if it’ll get lower because of this.

**dlong56655** (7): this chorus slaps, the rest is not very memorable tbh

**frogaranaman** (7): stop why is this so fucking fun

**ke1per** (7): another satisfying thwacky percussion line

**mimins** (7): the way they pronounce obliviate kills me but its a good song

**runaway3212** (7): yas

**sabooyah** (7): The key change was nice!

**2l82bstr8** (6.5): this change in sound didn't suit them at all. deserved a better send-off

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): wait i was being mean but maybe that key change ate..

**ivyleaf33** (6.5): this was the first song i hadn't heard before on this rate - i don't think i missed much, though

**RaphaelArthur** (6.5): good but sounds like a b-side

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): this song wildly fluctuates between really good and kinda bad and I don't know what to make of that

**Zypker125** (6.2): I want to like this song, but the "down down stop it" drops sound god awful.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): that’s not a word is it

**en#8502** (6): i only learned the other day that "obliviate" was an actual english word. kpop is teaching me english and yall want to call me brainrot?!

**LesApfels** (6): I keep hearing "are we Beyoncé?" instead of "obliviate"

**Round\_Log401** (6): A little more my taste but still lacking a little bit of spice.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): It's no IU - Obliviate.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That key change was not smooth

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): wow I wish I liked this more but the production is kinda messy

**bigbigbee** (5.5): grew on me a bit, I think I was disappointed that they changed their image that I thought this was bad, but it’s not, I just miss innocent concepts

**BooksAndWhisky** (5.3): The beat is hard carrying an otherwise very underwhelming song

**chancehugs** (5): I kinda dig the production going on, but the song feels like it goes nowhere.

**cuttackone** (5): iu did that song way better

**ebooks#5454** (5): hermonie pointing her wand to her parents in book 7 like

**flavasavavandal** (5): what happened to the nice sweet girl group that sang Ah-Choo

**jasannn** (5): if only these dub wubs were accompanied with a better melody

**lalafairy18** (5): WOAHH that last chorus

**note\_2\_self** (5): Why are there multiple kpop songs based on Harry Potter Tarantellegra and Mr Potter

**rubbie** (5): this is a mess sorry. that darker sound doesn't suit them at all.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): well. at least they tried something different

**thegirlin512** (5): Is this meant to be their transition to a darker sound? Honestly it's adorable, but the cutesiness of the vocals doesn't go with the beat and it sounds a bit discordant.

**-mczrv-** (4.8): I promise it’s not personal!

**skargardin** (4): this is rough i fear

**2dina3dworld** (3.7): please don’t make me spell obliviaite again

**pig-serpent** (3.5): This rate doesn't have as many songs that are four unrelated, incoherent ideas that insist on making a song together anyway as I was expecting, but they're still here and they're as bad as I expected.

**apatel27** (3): Please stop it with garbage drops.

**JohnnyToby** (2): sounds very loona

**terrencelovescum** (2): interesting album title

**wavingwolves** (8.1): Yes, this is NOT a title, but we had to include because of the sheer amount of success it amassed on the Korean charts. Despite it not even being promoted at first, it was one of the most successful K-Pop songs at the time after becoming a viral hit. I have always liked Dolphin because I love silly songs, especially if they sound this bright and saccharine filled, and I think OMG as a group is able to pull it off particularly well, cue to [Banana Allergy Monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9r_1ys2ec). But, of course, the most enjoyable thing this song has brought to the world was [this fancam](https://youtu.be/NTDTHIyNWLk) of TXT's Soobin and just for that this song deserves better than what it got! FOREVER THANKFUL FOR ITS EXISTENCE!!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): I don’t understand why this was so popular? It’s a catchy, err, children’s song but you can do stupidly catchy K-pop songs with at least a little bit of oomph (see T-ara’s Roly Poly). This isn’t even fun. I do like the bloopers idea of the MV though.

**Round\_Log401** (10): I don't know what they put in this song. One of the best songs of 2020, played this like crazy.

**Roxieloxie** (10): My airpods started glitching BAD during the chorus of this song but I just assumed they were trying to do something quirky with the production

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSS

**Zypker125** (6.1): I swear people only really started liking this song after they heard it was popular on the Korean charts.

**BasedButta** (6): its cute

**BooksAndWhisky** (6): Idk OMG have way better cute songs in their discography so this one doesn’t stand out

**celladonn** (6): Catchy central melody but there's not much else to this

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): eh

**cremeebrulee** (6): the video is cute but other than the chorus this is kind of forgettable

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i can understand why this was a deep cut

**ke1per** (6): very fun, weakest Oh My Girl rap of the bunch for sure

**lalafairy18** (6): It's so addicting

**alwayswords** (5.7): this song sounds so empty

**2l82bstr8** (5.5): just flat and boring sorry

**DefaultPophead** (5.5): The subtle water sound in the background just sounds like they have a lot of saliva in their mouths. Yuck.

**apatel27** (5): wtf is this chorus. Can't tell if it's good or bad though it reminds me of 'quirky' white pop bands trying to sound indie from mid 10's so leaning to latter

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): listening to this group for the first time, none of these songs are bad but they're just kind of boring? They just feel pretty generic to me

**skargardin** (5): honestly after several listens I still struggle to remember this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): kinda boring

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): what a waste of a good buildup

**intheaftermath** (4): I didn't care for this group as much as the others but dang, that is some stunning cover art! I just really love the colors used in it, the board game is eye-catching as well.

**SkylarV** (4): There's absolutely zero(0) climatic resolution in this song, I can't stand it

**sublimeMusic** (4): I like this song but I think about if I had to listen to it three times in a row I think I would go mad

**fadedblue09** (3): I used to prefer this to Nonstop but I find it really annoying now

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Sometimes Kpop songs are like “if it’s ear catching or weird then we’ve done our job” and then they forget that they have to… like… sound good too

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): damn that ending dragged

**mimins** (2): I'm too grown for this I think

**SatC1** (2): soobin killed it

**sabooyah** (1): This song for toddlers. I know because I have spent an incredibly large amount of time listening to toddler music with toddlers. The worst part is that I don't even think the toddlers this song was made for would like it that much, especially when they got bangers like Baby Shark.

**terrencelovescum** (1): they ran non-lexical vocables DOWN to the ground. i don't think a single song has managed to make da da da work.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): this is a very biased opinion. I’m not even gonna lie but the hold dolphin Soobin still has on me is embarrassing. Akong I miss you every Friday

**throwaway-7650** (10): da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da! we love you soobin

**PSSST12** (10): Soobin is so fine

**sage** (8.9): soobin ate

**seanderlust** (8.1): ok yeah that one performance with soobin made me like this a lot more

**becca** (6): Soobin ruined this song btw

**poemforsmallthings** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-tlU9mboyg&ab_channel=KBSWORLDTV

**GREY** (0): this is genuinely so bad like omfg holy its appalling that anyone is yassing over this (the anyone being a certain discord server i wont name names they know exactly who they are.) holy shit im listening again and its scary how bad this is.... im sorry even soobin loml king of the world couldnt save this dumpster fire that escaped wm basement

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): I remember when this song came out over summer while I was in another country with no WiFi, so me and my brother (shoutout to Prada) used some random McDonald’s free WiFi to download this song and listen to it later. So when we get home we listen to it, laugh at the “THEY KEEP TALKING / I KEEP WALKING” part, and then when it ends we kinda just stare at each other for a moment until my brother goes “...I kinda like it though?” And he was RIGHT! This is just a stupidly fun song.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): This song is crazy, especially considering this was what JYP Entertainment decided that should be ITZY's first ever comeback after Dalla Dalla. I think it was genuinely the perfect follow-up song, just a major slay. It's sad to see it leave so early on when it deserved to be at minimum the second highest song by them here, but a song like this is bond to catch some haters along the way. The production could be almost classified as experimental, it's just genuinely so dynamic and fun, probably the thing that most caughts my attention. The colourful concept and amazing choreo just adds to it, making it a colossal achievement of a song.

**prada** (11): i see that i’m ISLAY!!!!!!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic ryujin move aside, this is a huge bop that no one could escape. Itzy vs imaginary haters part 2

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Every part of this song is just obscenely catchy.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): the way this owned my life in the summer of 2019

**cremeebrulee** (10): great song for annoying ppl

**DaBigBoi** (10): Bussy and the beat so hot ITZY had to cool it down with ice.

**hikkaru** (10): they keep talking 🗣🗣🗣 i keep walking 👠👠👠💋💋👛👛

**ivyleaf33** (10): call me tasteless, but i was obsessed with this - made it my entire personality for a good month

**jasannn** (10): i loved this song so much when it came out, my friend and i spent the whole summer saying hey hey and beep beep at each other.

**notarobot3675** (10): this and dalla dalla always duke it out for my favourite itzy track but i love the bridge on this one too much

**sage** (10): the chorus production is literally one of the most insane things ive heard in a kpop song, 11 contender

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): what else is there to say about this song other than "it slaps"

**TiltControls** (10): BEEP BEEP

**whoisValensi** (10): I think my neighbours might be sick of this song because for like a month straight I couldn't stop playing it. Ain't my fault it's fucking catchy and fun to dance around the house to.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): underrated quirky banger

**AssailantArcturus** (9.5): probably even more unpopular that i think icy is amazing

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i love the verses

**bigbigbee** (9.5): The person who wrote that lyric REALLY thought they did something. and they did omg

**mengzhongmeng** (9.5): the neck breaking step is iconic, i'm obsessed

**Victerade** (9.5): EVEN BETTER THAN DALLA DALLA ME THINKS! THEIR BEST TITLE ACTUALLY

**1998tweety** (9): experimental SERVE. I did not like this at first but whew it grew

**2l82bstr8** (9): this one's almost experimental? I love that specific mish-mash of sounds. it doesn't land well all the time but it just goes on without looking back and doesn't miss a beat

**bookthieving** (9): both the song and its choreo are so bouncy

**lady\_sable** (9): ryujin killed it

**RaphaelArthur** (9): extremely catchy, addicting and unique beat and good delivery

**rikarikachan** (9): I'm gonna say it, this is the best ITZY song.

**rubbie** (9): The kind of sophomore "slump" that consolidated and refined their style into something instantly recognizable. Wish every group had one.

**vayyiqra** (9): bleepbloop

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.7): still a bop though

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): the prechorus, c’est magnifique

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): These guys have such fun vibes. I am willing to overlook things that normally annoy me. That's a good sign. Or maybe the whistles in "Really Bad Boy" destroyed my hearing.

**ebooks#5454** (8.5): i'd fucking wear a ballgown to the diner yea i'd be that bitch

**akanewasright** (8): Why is this chorus like two steps away from “let’s have a kiki”?

**anagalisgv** (8): so bouncy

**BooksAndWhisky** (8): I almost like this more than Dalla Dalla except the dance break and the pitch at which they’re singing genuinely hurts my ears

**cuttackone** (8): they kept up swinging

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I better not see ICY come out at Day 1…

**en#8502** (8): THEY KEEP TALKING! I KEEP WALKING!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i see

**PSSST12** (8): again, a divisive song saved by their performing abilities. I gotta give itzy the respect for being such awesome performers.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i dont think i was mentally prepared to watch the music video for this one and seeing the captions say “yass” less than 5 seconds into the song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it bops but also is slightly grating but I can ignore it

**-chilazon-** (7.5): Sooo catchy but just too noisy for me! But I still like it

**brokebutter** (7.5): ppl who hate icy think mafia in the morning is a good song

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): In the video there's a shot of them opening the door to a freezer and alongside the Ben and Jerry's there was a box of Annie's macaroni and cheese

**terrencelovescum** (7.5): the bass line? the prechorus? perfect. the shout out to my mama took me out and not in a good way.

**chancehugs** (7): The ad libs in the dance break was kinda annoying ngl. But I love the hook and the chorus really grew on me after being initially noisy.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I SAID BRRRRR IT’S COLD IN HERE

**JohnnyToby** (7): I could not listen to this when it dropped but now I see that I'm icy

**RandomHypnotica** (7): phoebe bridgers level pun

**Roxieloxie** (7): this is aslo wannabe but worse but i like the beat more

**runaway3212** (7): yas

**sabooyah** (7): Again, fun, yes incredibly childish, corny, but still fun.

**savemeaseat143** (7): it has a nice prechorus

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): This is the worst take I will have this rate, but this kinda sounds like Sat in Your Lap by Kate Bush

**billie\_\_** (6.5): when yuna broke her back for this song i was like ok i get it now.

**ke1per** (6.5): love the funky breakdown in the chorus, could do without the dance break

**mimins** (6.5): its good but not great. could have been more fun

**Tazzachar** (6.5): I like the spaceship sounds in the chorus

**anothertown** (6): you know what? I DO see that i'm icy

**BasedButta** (6): something in here sounds exactly like my childhood home telephone ring but the actual song is a bit repetitive imo

**ChickyDipper** (6): I think this beat is what it sounds like in a blender

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (6): thanking your parents in a rap is the only proper way

**intheaftermath** (6): hey hey hey!

**MimisChoice9763** (6): I don't like the chorus

**Nixon4Prez** (6): If DALLA DALLA was annoying

**pig-serpent** (6): I go back and forth between annoyance and thinking it's really fun. I guess this is what y'all call camp here?

**rslashpoopheads** (6): The instrumental has a lot of fun noises.

**superr\_rad** (6): I tried to love this song. I really did. I just cant get into it. Its too chaotic and disjointed for me to catch on to anything. The girls still served though.

**becca** (5): I’ll leave it at that!

**Cooler\_lin** (5): catchy, not the best and could be better but overall it is a bit of a grower

ggsmackdown: # Don't see they're icy </3

**DraculaWeekend** (5): This mv really ruined this song, which wasn't that good either

**frogaranaman** (5): it doesn't really look that cold in the music video tho

**GREY** (5): uh okay! Yes :P

**seanderlust** (5): not crazy about this one. the chorus is a serve (they keep talking, I keep walking :velmaserve:) but everything else I could keep or leave

**welcome2thejam** (5): It's like I'm driving down a hill and ITZY cut my brakes

**fadedblue09** (4.5): This was okay-ish but got really annoying in the end

**SkylarV** (4.5): Starts off well enough, but just doesn't manifest into anything good

**thedoctordances1940** (4.2): i really get the appeal and i kinda wanna like it but sometimes it's just too much

**Zypker125** (4.2): I'll never forgive this song for helping to bring chant-noise choruses into K-Pop.

**Round\_Log401** (4): It's catchy but it's also A LOT.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This song is a lot of noise

**bulforster** (3.6): why is there a section that stops the song so they can play bop it for a bit

**-mczrv-** (3): tbh the whole experiences makes me a bit stressed

**hunnybee12** (3): knets were correct for creating a petition to stop jyp from writing itzy titles

**throwaway-7650** (3): my ears are bleeding at that note at the end... it's so out of tune

**Jhe116** (1): IT’z so bad, I want to give it a zero, but that’s not possible (because I already gave it to HYLT), so I give it a one

**thegirlin512** (1): I have listened to this at least ten times to see what people saw in it, but it's just so forgettable that I can't even remember the chorus. Honestly, feels like Dalla Dalla pt2, which wouldn't be so bad if Dalla Dalla was actually good.

**agentofscranton** (0): i was ready to stan after dalla dalla but icy was so wank that i feared for the itchy girls - a repeating cycle that's repeated itself for them unfortunately

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): this is one of the most annoying songs I have ever heard

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): In recent years Kpop songs have become increasingly fractional, songwriters just throw everything at the wall and hope that some of it sticks because they know people will keep streaming it for one killer part. This is the apotheosis of the failures of that ethos, despite this song trying a million different things none of them are enjoyable.

**nctdreamsqd** (0): I just don’t like their vocal tone on this song and I find the instrumental really grating.
