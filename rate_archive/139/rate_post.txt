[Hello](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/837510667652300830/870848957847330876/20210730_225949.jpg?width=482&height=427) and welcome to the K-pop Girl Group Smackdown rate!! [We three hosts](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/ryQnQjPRJOkRrwH3dwJFdT9D3Qv3IxDxtMk2ZjoZTPw/https/media.discordapp.net/attachments/626601739835015181/919242933650223165/ezgif-1-bce8bcb0cc89.gif) (u/MoonlightByWindow, u/rickikardashian, and u/wavingwolves) are delighted to announce that we will be at the helm for this rate, picking up where the sub’s very first (!!) K-pop rate left off.

A lot can happen in three years, especially when we’re talking about K-pop. Since the first Girl Group Singles rate, we’ve seen the disbandment of robbed legends GFRIEND ~~hopefully that encourages y’all to not rob them here~~, the start of a whole new generation, and BLACKPINK finally released their first full album! 

Along with these changes, the amount of K-pop fans on this very sub has also grown but we encourage anyone to participate, even if you’ve never heard a single K-pop song in your life – we hope it will be a very fun and enjoyable experience regardless :)

***

### But where’s *this* song?!

As with any grab bag, there are questions over why a certain song made it over a different one, or why a group has more songs than a different group. Thankfully, as mentioned before we basically just picked up where the Girl Group Singles rate left off. This means we only had a time frame of two years to encompass – all 2021 songs have been saved for the 2021 K-Pop Rate, as the sub hopefully moves to annual K-pop rates as planned. Therefore any major title track from a big group in this time period, bar 2021, was included in this rate (although we had to cut some songs that people don’t really care about from said groups…sorry More and More!). 

To ensure fairness and also give a spotlight to lesser-known groups or songs, the maximum number of songs any group could receive was **five**. K-pop has so much to offer and we wanted to showcase that!

A big thank you to Nick (u/whoisValensi) for the amazing playlist cover!!

## TWICE

One of the biggest K-pop groups ever, TWICE are a juggernaut on all fronts. Although their status exploded in Korea in 2016 with their hit *Cheer Up*, it wasn’t until 2019 when they started to see the same growth and love outside of East Asia. *FANCY* marked a turning point for the group as their transition from a cute concept to a more mature one. The song remains one of their most popular title tracks – will it help TWICE to do better than their previous showing in the 2018 rate?

1. [Dance The Night Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm5iP0S1z9w&)
2. [YES or YES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAKsZ26SabQ&)
3. [FANCY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOHB85vDuow&)
4. [Feel Special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ymwOvzhwHs&)
5. [I CAN’T STOP ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM4CkVFmTds&)

## BLACKPINK

Famous (or infamous, depending on how you look at it) for the “Teddy [formula](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/795406960089497611/926250890711679006/Screenshot_330.png)”, BLACKPINK have been global stars ever since their arrival on the scene in 2016. Contrary to other groups, they leave plenty of time in between releases in order to build up maximum hype. As a result, their discography is still very small which means we didn’t even have to cut any singles from the rate (and it’s also why they only have 4…). As they said themselves on their B-side *Love to Hate Me*: you either “love ~~to~~ or hate me”.

1. [Kill This Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S24-y0Ij3Y&)
2. [How You Like That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioNng23DkIM&)
3. [Ice Cream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRXZj0DzXIA&)
4. [Lovesick Girls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyRsYk0LyA8&)

## Red Velvet

No doubt that Red Velvet have had a rough couple of years recently – they didn’t even have a single comeback in 2020! Luckily, we still had enough songs to choose from. Known for their dual concept (“Red” songs being the more upbeat, obnoxious pop songs, while “Velvet” songs are smoother and more R&B), Red Velvet managed to cinch a win with the Red song *Russian Roulette* in the first iteration of this rate. Now that they’ve, er…basically abandoned the concept (isn’t that a rite of passage for all K-pop lore at this point?), it may just be anyone’s game now. Or not! Will they continue the streak of SM artists winning every K-pop rate on the sub?

1. [Power Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiHSVQy9xN8&)
2. [RBB (Really Bad Boy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWJUPY-2EIM&)
3. [Zimzalabim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBnGBb1wg98&)
4. [Umpah Umpah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHS9E6JFja8&)
5. [Psycho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR8Mrt1IpXg&)

## LOONA

As u/rickikardashian can corroborate, the LOONA hype in certain ~~gay~~ spaces of the Internet has perhaps led people to think they’re bigger than they actually are. But they’re definitely one of the most popular groups on Popheads and the supply-and-demand model exists for a reason! ~~Orbits be thankful Paint the Town couldn’t be here~~

1. [Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEOCbFJjRw0&)
2. [So What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEo5bmUKFvI&)
3. [Why Not](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6li05zh3Kg&)
4. [Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW-AIXAnLcE&)

## OH MY GIRL

Although OH MY GIRL were always a successful mid-tier group, it wasn’t until 2020 that they really blew up. The monumental success of both *Nonstop* and *Dolphin* (which gave us this [delightful stage](https://youtu.be/0-tlU9mboyg)) was something to behold, which is why we decided to add *Dolphin* in the rate too despite it being a B-side. *Closer* is also one of the few pre-2018 songs in the rate, as we felt it deserved to be here and see if the cries of “so underrated!!” would carry it forward…

1. [Closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isUudT58Xfk&)
2. [5th Season (SSFWL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udGwca1HBM4&)
3. [Nonstop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDjQSdN_ig8&)
4. [Dolphin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaRTMjLdiDw&)

## GFRIEND

Well-known for their brand of sentimental and dreamy pop music, GFRIEND decided to shift to a more mature concept in 2020 with the releases of *Apple* and *MAGO*. Although they unfortunately [disbanded](https://hypebeast.com/2021/5/lil-uzi-vert-mourns-disbandment-kpop-group-gfriend-info) before they could show us [more](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/795406960089497611/926513125619032084/Screenshot_331.png), we’re grateful that they left us with such a stellar discography.

1. [Time For The Moon Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XyBa8QsVQU&)
2. [Fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zll7O1v63aY&)
3. [Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQSse3b2ge4&)
4. [MAGO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmBYPXGqtss&)

## ITZY

After their explosive debut with *Dalla Dalla* in early 2019, ITZY have certainly left an impression on everyone who listens to them. Their style of music may not be for everyone but one thing’s for sure: you’ll almost never be bored.

1. [DALLA DALLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNfTK39k55U&)
2. [ICY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndvqTc4P9I&)
3. [WANNABE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE2h3lGlOsk&)
4. [Not Shy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTowEKjDGkU&)

## Brave Girls

If you told your average K-pop fan in 2018 that Brave Girls would be guaranteed spots in a K-pop girl groups rate, I’m sure they would have looked at you very strangely. Perhaps one of the biggest cases of a sleeper hit ever, *Rollin’* was a total flop in 2017 (as well as Brave Girls overall…) then became a nationwide hit in 2021 after a compilation of Brave Girls performing it for the South Korean military went viral. Brave Girls now continue to enjoy mainstream success - will Popheads like them as much?

1. [Rollin’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cZrxpK2EAQ&)
2. [We Ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HjcypoChfQ&)

## MAMAMOO

One of those groups who found far more fans in Korea than in the West for…various reasons, MAMAMOO were essentially known for being “not like the other girls” (Korea’s Version) (From Rainbow Bridge World). Although they started their careers playing around with a more jazz feel, over the years they’ve pivoted to a traditional K-pop sound. The jury’s still out on whether they’ll fare better on Popheads with this new sound.

1. [Egotistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHtxTSiPh5I&)
2. [Gogobebe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp56JdkmE9s&)
3. [HIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhTeiaCezwM&)
4. [Dingga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfl9KIX1WpU&)

## IZ*ONE

Formed from the MNET survival show Produce 48 (the third season of Produce 101 – more on that later), IZ*ONE were hugely successful for the 2.5 years they were active. With large fanbases in both South Korea and Japan, the group split their time between making music in both Korean and Japanese. After enjoying great success in both countries and being one of the groups to usher in the 4th generation of K-pop, the group disbanded in early 2021 after their contract ran out. Still, in the short time they were active they definitely left their mark on the industry!

1. [La Vie En Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZwr2a_lFWY&)
2. [Fiesta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDEFolvLn0A&)
3. [Panorama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8GaQdW2wHc&)

## (G)-IDLE

Home to one of the most talented idols ever in one Jeon Soyeon, (G)-IDLE smashed right out of the gate. Their debut song, *LATATA*, was extremely successful and (G)-IDLE (Idle for short) have easily managed to stabilise that early domestic success. IDLE also have a strong international fanbase, although they may be more renowned for [one specific moment…](https://www.asianjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SoyeonEthnicHip-600x377.png) 

1. [LATATA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mQk7Evt6Vs&)
2. [HANN (Alone)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKNXn2qCEws&)
3. [Oh my god](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om3n2ni8luE&)

## WJSN

WJSN, or Cosmic Girls, are a fan favourite. Since their debut in 2015, they’ve carefully maintained their particular style of dreamy pop music while still branching out and keeping things fresh. Their unique Zodiac concept also means they consistently have gorgeous MVs, and if all of that isn’t enough to convince you there’s always the [Chinese lesbian billionaires](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/05/16/this-viral-story-about-a-chinese-lesbian-billionaire-couple-was-an-amazing-hoax/).

1. [Secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uJxJ7tSi1w&)
2. [Save Me, Save You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wOBbRu3OOc&)
3. [BUTTERFLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftyLwZ68LnU&)

## Lovelyz

Lovelyz may not be for everyone with their particular style of cutesy bubblegum pop, but any K-pop fan worth their salt has heard at least the chorus of *Ah-Choo*. An infectious pop song where the narrator details how she feels like sneezing whenever she sees her crush, *Ah-Choo* was a big hit for Lovelyz. Lovelyz would maintain this particular flavour of quirky pop music for several more years. It wasn’t until 2020 that Lovelyz tried a darker concept with *Obliviate*...and then they promptly disbanded. But at least they tried something new, right?

1. [Ah-Choo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7qisJ_KuYI&)
2. [That day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40Z9-kr504w&)
3. [Obliviate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GUqqRzIZgw&)

## Dreamcatcher

Another group with a distinct brand, Dreamcatcher are known for incorporating rock and metal influences into their discography. They never quite saw the same levels of success in Korea as perhaps other groups in the rate have, but they definitely have solid fanbases in other areas of the world such as Europe. In fact, there are plenty of ~~straight men~~ people out there who proudly proclaim that the only K-pop they will listen to is Dreamcatcher!

1. [Deja Vu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W761DtH1oRg&)
2. [Scream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKlGHHhTOsQ&)

## EVERGLOW

It could be said that before 2020, EVERGLOW were more known in the wider K-pop sphere for accusations of ripping off BLACKPINK, inflated YouTube views, and incredibly uneven line distributions than for anything to do with their music. It wasn’t until synthpop banger *LA DI DA* released that they truly came into their own and the song received widespread praise from both general K-pop fans and critics.

1. [DUN DUN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoYKBAajoyo&)
2. [LA DI DA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeI992mvlEY&)

## 2020 Debuts

Hundreds of K-pop groups debut every year – it’s part of the life cycle, what makes the world go round etc etc. Only a small number of these debuts (and new groups) see any actual success. So of course we’ve chosen three debut songs from three of the most popular rookie groups, all for you to rate!

1. [Weeekly - Tag Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Moq0aOiTUOA&)
2. [STAYC - SO BAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMe1c4UegBY&)
3. [aespa - Black Mamba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeerrnuLi5E&)

## Retirement Home

Since this is a rate looking at songs released in the past few years, naturally most of the songs will be from newer groups that haven’t hit the dreaded 7-year mark. But there’s always room for our favourite hags who continued to release music in this time period! As well as groups that haven’t officially disbanded but basically have, of course.

1. [EXID - I Love You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAdmzjsFVQo&)
2. [Apink - Dumhdurum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqzTRK5GPWQ&)
3. [CLC - No](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvhpjERxJlQ&)

## Bops that deserve their time in the spotlight…

Arbitrary picks? Yes! But we felt that these songs from less wildly successful/popular groups fromis_9 and APRIL may be right up Popheads’ alley, and they deserve a chance to shine.

1. [fromis_9 - LOVE BOMB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SK6cvkK4c0&)
2. [APRIL - Oh! My Mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2MhwXZ8IgM&)

## I.O.I / Post-I.O.I Groups

Remember that brief Produce 101 mention? One of the many ways K-pop is different from the Western music industry is its overt use of survival shows, where ordinary citizens can vote for a trainee they like to be in the final line-up of a K-pop group. Said group will then be formed for a certain amount of months or a couple of years before ultimately disbanding. In 2016, paid television channel MNET perfected this formula when they created the show Produce 101 – and the groups I.O.I, Wanna One, IZ*ONE, and X1 in its four seasons. The show was hugely popular and so I.O.I were able to piggyback off of that popularity. After just ten months, I.O.I disbanded and members of the group branched off into their own groups under separate companies. Unfortunately none of them ever reached the heights of I.O.I but at least they gave us these bops.

1. [I.O.I - Very Very Very](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdxvD7r58ng&)
2. [PRISTIN - WEE WOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLfHuClrQdI&)
3. [Gugudan - The Boots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3KSD5sI0OM&)
4. [DIA - WOOWA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnXIPDp9xIM&)
5. [Weki Meki - Picky Picky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1taLXjVxB4U&)

# Rules

* **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song listed.** If your ballot is missing any scores it will not be eligible and you'll be sent a message asking you to fill the missing scores in.

* **Each song should be assigned a score between 1 to 10.** Decimals up to one point are allowed but any further is a no-no – 6.5 is fine, 6.55 is not.

* **You can use ONE 0 and ONE 11 for the entirety of the rate, for your least favourite and most favourite song respectively**. These are optional but encouraged if you feel some type of way about a given song! **Comments are also very encouraged** but not required for such scores.

* **Please be sure to submit your scores using the prepared message format linked [here](https://tinyurl.com/mtwhcked)**, this makes it infinitely easier for us to record your scores using the rate machine program.

* **Comments are encouraged and much appreciated!** (but not required) and can be added to any song by simply typing after inserting your score, like so: 
> I.O.I - Very Very Very: 10 This song is very very very good

* **This is the ONLY correct way to write a comment**. Please do not include colons (e.g 10: This song is…), dashes (e.g 10 - This song is…), or anything else after your score/before your comment as it breaks the program.

* Conversely, if you want to include comments for a **specific group**, you can do so by adding a colon after the "Group: [name]" line in the ballot. For example:
> Group: Red Velvet: I prefer Victoria sponge

* **DO NOT SABOTAGE!** Hopefully this shouldn’t be a problem as we trust you guys ~~(famous last words, right?)~~, but if we notice that you’ve given one group all 10s and a particular rival group all 1s, we reserve the right to reject your ballot and/or ask you to change your scores. If you *really* hate all songs from a certain group, please leave comments explaining why you hate them. Ultimately, please just rate all of the songs truthfully – this will make the whole process a lot easier and more fun for everyone involved! 

* If you want to change scores or add comments at any point, feel free to send this Reddit account (u/ggsmackdown) a message. All three of us are also active on Discord, so if you have Discord you can find one of us in the Popheads Discord at gucci#6629, r1cki#2434, or wavingwolves#1728.

* You can use the message link to send your scores, or through copypasting [this Pastebin here](https://pastebin.com/83AkUNS0) into a Reddit message to this account.
