DilemmaOfAHedgehog: As someone who’s probably a blink since I got into K-pop because Jennie is hot ~~and I wanted to look up celebrities in music in 2016 that didn’t involve magazine bringing up trump bc escapism~~  I’m disappointed they got slaughtered despite that I gave them really mid scores and my zero bc I hate their raps and I just hate ice cream so much

But also my mom made empanadas with chorizo and papas filling and I’m rooting for gidle (though I consider oh my god being eliminated as hate crime against me as a queer catholic)

Edit: I didn’t think the rate chose the best red velvet songs but them losing so many makes me feel like you guys hate fun

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/nse9Z9uA)**

---

**wavingwolves** (8.1): One of the most memorable debuts of the past few years, it received a lot of immediate praise and it was even a mild hit on the Korean charts. It written and produced by Soyeon, (G)I-DLE's own leader and main rapper, which isn't super common in the industry, especially for girl groups, even if members of various groups started contribuiting more and more in their own music as the years went on. Soyeon went own to write and produce most of (G)I-DLE's titles as well.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): Weirdly, I didn't like this much when it first came out but it's grown on me over the years. As a debut, it establishes the group's identity very well. I just know CLC were fuming when they saw their hoobaes' debut song be more successful than any of their songs adjsks

---

# I LOVE YA!

**-chilazon-** (10): Umm, this is my first time listening to this song, but like, new fave? Omigosh? It's so good? Soyeon is a genius

**agentofscranton** (10): their ethnic hip has never sounded as good as this

**bluetriangles04** (10): One of the best 4th Gen debuts, LATATA was a good peek into the direction of (G)I-DLE and where they would be headed, with the unique lower register of members shining in the pre-chorus. also #JUSTICEFORSOOJIN

**ChickyDipper** (10): an *iconic* debut, Soyeon really knew what she was doing with this one 😍

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I LOVE YA

**GREY** (10): on jah?

**Nixon4Prez** (10): GOAT debut song

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Another great debut song; they really came out of the gate running, with a strong identity from Day 1. And that’s 80% thanks to Soyeon, who deserves every ounce of praise she’s ever been given

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): EVERY DAY EVERY NIGHT LA TA TA

**bespectacIed** (9): so good. brava of a debut

**dlong56655** (9): they're a group that for me peaked in their debut year and has been completely mid since

**fadedblue09** (9): Ngl this sounds generic but I feel like I might end up liking this anyways skksksff

**JohnnyToby** (9): soyeon and yuqi did THAT

**JsaKim** (9): was such a strong debut

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9): props to Soyeon for writing, producing and choreograph the song

**RaphaelArthur** (9): catchy, steady, excellent production

**Round\_Log401** (9): Remains one of my fave debuts. Love the choreo so much. Soyeons rap! Very aesthetically pleasing mv, the way it plays with colour is beautiful.

**throwaway-7650** (8.7): the #worst debut song in the rate (excl. black mamba)

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): don't have any strong feelings for this one but it's lovely

**anothertown** (8.5): well im bopping

**savemeaseat143** (8.2): very understandable why this became popular

**sarcasticsobs** (8.1): yuqi has the coolest voice, it’s absurd. i actually love the vocal timbre of everyone in this group, even the shuhua just repeating the chorus here

**becca** (8): EVERYDAY EVERY NIGHT LA TA TA

**BooksAndWhisky** (8): Imagine peaking at debut with a trend hopping song

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8): it’s aged …. not that well

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): this year loved the latin thing

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Fav debut song ever probably

**ke1per** (8): love that moody tropical house vibe

**lady\_sable** (8): it's so cool that soyeon wrote & arranged her group's debut, that's really uncommon in the kpop industry (esp w/ girl groups)

**mimins** (8): its so fun and catchy and unique

**PSSST12** (8): Fantatastic debut song. Soyeon remains one of the most talented kpop idols EVER.

**rubbie** (8): great song, I prefer when they do moodier tunes though

**sabooyah** (8): The impact this debut had.....jeesh.

**vayyiqra** (8): Trop-pop (good)

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): another classic i fear, just among the classics this is probably my least favorite

**Victerade** (7.5): aged bad

**Zypker125** (7.4): Shoutouts to Soyeon carrying this group on her back from the start.

**chancehugs** (7): It took a long time for this song to grow on me, mostly because I had no idea what 'Latata' meant.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the mv could be akane and his roommate if they were tumblr roommates

**prada** (7): good

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Basic but cool.

**runaway3212** (7): yas

**-mczrv-** (6.9): not my preferred vibe but I respect it

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.8): it's cute

**billie\_\_** (6.5): every gi-dle song reminds me of hate by 4minute except not as good.

**MimisChoice9763** (6.5): don't like the chorus verses are fire though

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): this sounds like every cyprus entry in eurovision the past couple of years

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Another example of good verses being let down by meh chorus.

**DefaultPophead** (6): This song had my greatest fluctuation in the rate. It started low, immediately shot high, and went low again. This is where we ended up. The rap verse is AWFUL and I want to tank this song, but my god Minnie's repeated two lines are eleven worthy.

**en#8502** (6): always found this song kinda mid but i saw everyone yassing over it back then so being the sheep and bandwagon rider i was i ended up listening to it for some reason.... life is amazing!

**frogaranaman** (6): that cover art FUCKS

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): is this cultural appropriation

**thegirlin512** (6): Not bad, but not special or catchy. The instrumental is pretty though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Generic-ish


# EVERY DAY! EVERY NIGHT! LATAT-[GUNSHOTS]

**DaBigBoi** (5.5): Shuhua ate up the latata’s maybe.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5.5): okay but there are a few points where the vocals sound kind of off?

**yatcho** (5.5): they're so painfully mid to me

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): yeah this is not very good

**apatel27** (5): Sounds like a trend chasing song from 2014

**cuttackone** (5): dont get why this blew them up this much it feels kinda generic

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I don’t really like the rap in the middle

**nt96** (5): Not the kisses being off rhythm, that alone docked points lol

**whoisValensi** (5): I'm convinced that there just isn't a 4th gen debut song I find amazing outside of STAYC's 'SO BAD' cause wow this song is boring as hell to me still!

**bulforster** (4.1): there's nothing terribly wrong here it's just severely lacking in energy

**Awkward\_King** (4): its a song

**BasedButta** (4): boring and a bit too empty of sounds if that makes any sense

**ivyleaf33** (4): those tropical synths irritate me to no end

**lalafairy18** (4): I like the prechorus a lot

**akanewasright** (3): this is kinda nothing.

**pig-serpent** (3): The limped reggeaton beat I've ever heard.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): for a 3 minute song it sure dragged

**terrencelovescum** (3): kind of a rollercoaster where i was like oooh this is cute to hmm idk to wait a min but in the end im gonna settle for no.

**brokebutter** (2.5): boring but also annoying

**sage** (2.1): the way this is their best title track

**ebooks#5454** (2): you could tell me this was a dj snake song and i would believe you

**Stryxen** (1.9): girls what is this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): in a rate where even the "bad" songs display varying levels of camp, the worst crime is boring mediocrity, and this is totally unremarkable. There’s nothing offered here that wasn’t done better elsewhere in the rate.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): BOP! All of the girls served here imo. This is a very MAMAMOO song to me, I think it suits them quite well. Don't @ me but it was a bit robbed here.

**wavingwolves** (1.6): Their worst song in the rate, and by a large margin, I have no idea how this managed to even get to Day 2. Everyone and their mothers already said this below, but if you want to listen to a good version of this song just check [AOA's version](https://youtu.be/JXC7rtAVOzM) out and you won't look back. Actually, if I had rewatched this before scoring I would have dropped 0.6 points, it's just THAT good and makes this version pale in comparison in a way that's just sad.

---

**Esh\_Kebab** (11): I will never get over the ad-libs in this song. They altered my life.

**-chilazon-** (10): Just too good. Sultry and perfect.

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, this is pure cμnt. That chorus, the sultry vocals, the rap verse, the bridge, whew what an era this was.

**2l82bstr8** (10): could've been just another tropical-inspired song (an absolute banger of a song tbf) but their performances really elevate it into something else

**Alumineous** (10): Smasher.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): This was hot

**fadedblue09** (10): The definition of scorching vocals

**lady\_sable** (10): i have nothing intelligent to add here im just gay

**notallslendermen** (10): This song turned me into a fan, love it

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): god everything about this song is so good.. mamamoo put their whole udders into this song

**PSSST12** (10): mamamoo's best song I fear. That latin vibe in the instrumentals was IT.

**Round\_Log401** (10): Replayed this like crazy. Their voices sound so good. Moonbyuls rap part is so good. Love the styling.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): masterful chorus, great guitar. solar in particular gets me hype in this. who am i kidding? they all do. truly an 11 contender for me

**savemeaseat143** (10): perfect exhibition of their top tier vocals

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.7): very different from other k-pop songs

**anagalisgv** (9): by far my favorite Latin-inspired kpop song

**becca** (9): A SMASH

**bespectacIed** (9): BICHO MALO so iconic

**thegirlin512** (9): I just love their voices on this song. It's not quite my style, but I might go check the rest of this album out anyway.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): A sassy bop

**throwaway-7650** (8.9): stream prayer in C I mean starry night from 4S,4C

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The chorus to this one is a firecracker I just wish the verses had a bit more spice… you can’t deny that MAMAMOO brass though!

**ke1per** (8.5): love the harmonic rap and that yummy guitar

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I originally had this at like a 5 but this bop got a lot better on multiple listens.

**chancehugs** (8): The song is hot. The video is hot. Listening to it makes me feel hot.

**ChickyDipper** (8): the beginning of the yassification of MAMAMOO

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): I will forgive this years obsession with latin now

**DefaultPophead** (8): I already love Hwasa, so I'm very excited to hear stuff from her band. This was good!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Mamamoo and summer latin-pop are a perfect match tbh.

**pig-serpent** (8): Kpop is often five different engines firing at all cylinders, and reggeaton is often too sparse to be effective dance music. Turns out when you put them together they balance out each other's flaws. Personally I think the Blistering Sun version is even better. Those horns!

**RaphaelArthur** (8): amazing vocals and great beat, excellent production but overall not so memorable

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Work it!

**rubbie** (8): Not a stan or anything but I really like how Mamamoo occupy their own unique lane in this increasingly saturated music landscape.

**superr\_rad** (8): im so gay for these fine ass bitches

**Victerade** (8): aged bad but got me into them so

**yatcho** (8): A g-idle song but when they do it it's actually good

**KoolFunk** (7.5): I love Mamamoo, I just wish some of  their songs wouldn't sound so safe so I could love them even more.

**BooksAndWhisky** (7.4): I’m a slut for Latin influenced kpop songs, sue me. Also Wheein sounds stunning here

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): this feels like a music video that would come out of an antm challenge

**anothertown** (7): i think this just made me nostalgic for trop pop

**BasedButta** (7): the girl that gets the rap parts kinda slays and carries hard this is their best song

**Cooler\_lin** (7): this was the first song i listened to after iz*one and thank god i needed depth and vocal technique after listening to panorama

**flavasavavandal** (7): This is just a Little Mix (specifically with Jesy) song

**ivyleaf33** (7): bops a bit

**prada** (7): we wanted the slayoslay version!

**rotating3Dtext** (7): bicho malo

**runaway3212** (7): yas

**Zypker125** (6.8): Why can't Mamamoo get title tracks that flex their vocals more, I want to see some flashy high notes and ad-libs.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (6.5): it used to be cute not so much anymore

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): When I get on the pole, people call me a whore, but when Solar gets on the pole, it's art

**bulforster** (6.1): sure

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.1): inoffensive but very bland for MMM standards

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is… interesting!

**vayyiqra** (6): Every time I hear the chorus to this I think of "Play" by Jolin Tsai which is a better song I fear

**billie\_\_** (5.5): i'm sorry i just find mamamoo really uninteresting.

**TiltControls** (5.5): I know if I love all the musical choices here

**Stryxen** (5.2): this is a rosalia song

**lalafairy18** (5): I think this sound really suits mamamoo

**whoisValensi** (4.5): They want what Olivia Hye has.

**Roxieloxie** (4): how are you racist and dont have good music, pick a struggle

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i found this a bit boring??

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): sounds like theyre trying way to hard to get that song of the summer award

**apatel27** (3): Lots of uninspired noise

**terrencelovescum** (2.5): i think i heard a little hot girl summer. completely forgot the song as soon as it finished.

**cuttackone** (2): this kinda sounds terrible lmao

**ebooks#5454** (1): this was a lot...like fifth harmony in the work from home m/v a lot...

**GREY** (1): lol

**plastichaxan** (1): “it’s no fun” me about this song

**sage** (1): mamamoo releasing 4 absolutely horrendous titles back to back is so funny


# Did anyone try the [AOA](https://youtu.be/JXC7rtAVOzM) version? I thought the AOA version was lovely

**mengzhongmeng** (6): aoa ate this song

**mimins** (6): aoa's cover in queendom ruined this song for me. I do not listen to this version at all because aoa's is just too perfect. like its still a good song but like wow. aoa man.

**sabooyah** (6): AOA's cover of this song is so much more enjoyable, Mamamoo got ate up on their own track.

**brokebutter** (5.6): aoa did it better

**jasannn** (5): AOA version outsold

**DaBigBoi** (0): How AOA took this from a 1 (well 0) to a 10 is beyond me.

**wavingwolves** (8.3): Yeah, I don't know why Starship didn't put Pantomime as the title either, it was a massive missed opportunity for sure, but this song is still good and it's miles and miles better the other butterfly we have in the rate. This especially movie montage-like during the verses but then it grows to be a kind of a little epic piece. I think this is really fun and I really like the more synth-y parts and the pre chorus build. With that said, I can understand it being the lowest WJSN song in the rate, it is my least favourite too, but it did deserve to be at least above a certain other song, c'mon!

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): One of the WJSN titles I don't really care for, which is a shame because this mini album is great. The chorus with "BUTTERFLYYY YEAHHH YEAHH"  is kinda grating to me and makes this the worst WJSN song in the rate, which most of you agree with.

---

# [Ujungs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZDbUq2ecCU)

**GREY** (11): one of if not the best song ever made in the history of recorded and unrecorded music. It truly takes the mind of someone with intense critical thinking, a good grasp on avant garde art, and an unconventional way of thought to understand the many layers beneath the surface of Butterfly by WJSN. Its absurdist performance art not meant for the masses to consume but for a select few of us that have the mental capacity to fully appreciate the audio experience that is Butterfly by WJSN. NALA! LIKE BUTTERFLY!

**agentofscranton** (10): this isn't even the best song on this mini album but it's still better than most girls' entire discographies

**DaBigBoi** (10): The anti-LOONA in that the choreo is kinda meh but the song is amazing.

**ggal2020** (10): christian girl kpop will always be the best music ever made

**rubbie** (10): galactika never miss, I love the chorus on this, it's so uplifting

**welcome2thejam** (10): In the battle of this rate's two Butterfly's, this one stings like a bee

**CaptainDaisyG** (9.9): The slightly more superior song titled "butterfly" in the rate (and the best WJSN song by far). Hopefully it's a contender.

**BasedButta** (9.5): really good by the books bright loud song

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.5): I like the final part so much

**1998tweety** (9): pop perfection yet again.

**bespectacIed** (9): the inferior butterfly song in this rate but still great.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9): why is their best track aka as you wish not here ????? i hate you

**chancehugs** (9): Rise main vocalist Yeoreum.

**DefaultPophead** (9): Oops just typed that number without thinking. What's the point of changing it? Let fate decide.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): There are so many songs called butterfly… and I love all of them :)

**hikkaru** (9): when this released i was too infatuated with pantomime to pay attention to this but it's good actually wow

**prada** (9): who said their best single omg

**bulforster** (8.8): Blows loona out of the water I fear... That descending synth line in the chorus is pure ear candy

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): Pantomime an 11 but this is so good

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): the better butterfly in the rate :noitstrue:

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): the superior butterfly song in this rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): this chorus is so good

**thegirlin512** (8.5): Bop alert! I liked the beat of this one much more than the other two.

**Victerade** (8.5): stole from gfriend and slayed pt2.0!

**throwaway-7650** (8.2): the inferior butterfly AND WJSN song in the rate. u.u

**seanderlust** (8.1): @ grimes take notes THIS is how you make music when you've got billionaire money

**2l82bstr8** (8): it's a very pretty song but it was dated by the time it came out and just not very fresh in general

**akanewasright** (8): The drums on the chorus are SO cool

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): this isn't loona

**becca** (8): one of their more weak songs but it’s still good!

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): uwu

**cremeebrulee** (8): cute but loona cleared

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the superior butterfly in this rate

**RaphaelArthur** (8): amazing vocals, beautiful song but could be much better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): god its just so pretty!!!

**TiltControls** (8): wait haven't I already rated a butterfly before. anyways this is also a bop

**brokebutter** (7.8): cant believe starship didnt choose pantomine as the title track however butterfly is still fun

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.7): oooo she's a bop!

**notarobot3675** (7.5): this mini was incredible but the title track was the weakest track for me, still cute tho

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): loona outsold in so many ways omg

**-chilazon-** (7): Feels too crowded with sounds and too high-pitched. Nice chorus tho.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Not there being two songs with this title in the rate and me feeling pretty much the same exact way about them. Pretty good but not great.

**frogaranaman** (7): daisybop

**glitter408** (7): the title track is meh but the other songs on this album as SO GOOOD

**lalafairy18** (7): the chorus is GREAT very poppy. I like that little riff in there

**mimins** (7): interesting sound, I dig it

**pornypete** (7): Decent song! But Tra-la stole the show for me on Neverland!

**runaway3212** (7): yas

**sabooyah** (7): I like the synths in the chorus!

**whoisValensi** (7): Well, it's not LOONA, but it's still quite nice.

**celladonn** (6.5): Pretty fun chorus makes this a bit less boring than their other songs

**Cooler\_lin** (6.5): intro was great once again. i love the piano throughout the song. i dont like the vocal melody in the chorus all that much but i liked the climax

**en#8502** (6.5): the inferior Butterfly in this rate

**ke1per** (6.5): verses don't do much for me but the chorus is great

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): I thought this was the Loona song for so long.

**anothertown** (6): not as good as the other butterfly in this rate unfortunately

**apatel27** (6): Just tired of giving 5 or lower to songs. At least it doesn't raise expectations too much

**cuttackone** (6): its alright

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this ended loona but like barely

**Nixon4Prez** (6): Bland and underwhelming. You skipped As You Wish but included this??

**PSSST12** (6): like the guitar riff at the beginning but nothing much was happening.

**rikarikachan** (6): Sorry (/)-(\)

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ehhh

# Orbits

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): proper mixing matters besties

**ivyleaf33** (5.5): this is the type of song that will make your ears hurt after a couple listens on headphones

**SkylarV** (5.5): The better song from this album is HOLA

**dlong56655** (5): the vocals on this track are so weirdly mixed

**pig-serpent** (5): I E I E I, No This ain't my butterfly.

**terrencelovescum** (5): expected a much better song considering its title. the cover is pretty tho so plus one for that.

**sage** (4.7): this song feels so lifeless and bland

**BooksAndWhisky** (4.5): A mess, and not in the "slightly obnoxious but fun" Itzy way

**Zypker125** (4.1): The inferior Butterfly of this rate, and that's saying something

**Awkward\_King** (4): apparently they can

**Round\_Log401** (4): Same

**jasannn** (3): its a fine song on paper but this song annoys me so much. the melody. the harmonizing. that annoying synth. the mid-MV. this is one of their worst title tracks. Justice for Happy!

**sublimeMusic** (3): i havent kept up with them in years but what is this chorus and why do they sound like that especially the last syllable of butterfly what is this it sounds bad

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): The best of the "retirement home" songs imo, CLC served a bit here. The NAUR chorus is oddly catchy. Also gonna take this moment to plug their song Where Are You?, which was released after Hobgoblin because Cube really had no idea what they were doing with this group.

**wavingwolves** (4): This should've been a Day 1 cut, I swear. I know I enjoyed this song a bit more upon release, but I can't find it in me to like it now. I don't think it's the worst thing I've ever heard, but it's also a far cry from a good CLC song like [Hobgoblin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9OxRFab6o4), [Where Are You?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khEW_JABKjw) or even [Pepe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qmsJbJasfo) in its campiness. I also don't really care for the possible message in this, it sounds more corporative than anything else, especially coming from women wearing high heels and full faces of make-up.

---

# Day 2? Yes.

**-chilazon-** (10): They slay this kind of song. The bridge is everything.

**1998tweety** (10): the song that saved their career (for like 6 months lol). I was not expecting such a serve from CLC. Thank you Soyeon. 11 contender !!

**2l82bstr8** (10): every single melody in this song is a chorus

**AssailantArcturus** (10): no and where are you are in the category of heavily overlooked clc songs that are actually their best songs if you take out songs that are called me

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): The extremely successful girlbossification of CLC, we love to see it

**DaBigBoi** (10): So nice of Soyeon to hand her best song to her seniors.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the word cunt spontaneously appeared in the Oxford dictionary when this came out

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (10): this is the only kpop album or Ep I’ve ever bought

**fadedblue09** (10): at first I wanted to question this pick and then I'm like "oh wait nvm this slaps"

**GREY** (10): gonna pretend this was the disbandment song instead of #that shit

**hikkaru** (10): they lived, they served cunt, then they died

**ivyleaf33** (10): well, at least "ethnic hip" means that cube had some serious bangers left for clc

**KoolFunk** (10): iconic

**metanoira** (10): (stream mermaid by yeeun)[https://youtu.be/liyK4x4NQ1g]

**notarobot3675** (10): i am not as big of a fan of clc as some people but this was so good

**RaphaelArthur** (10): extremely audacious, very unique and catchy, incredible delivery and great voices

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Banger.

**SatC1** (10): iconic

**Stryxen** (10): i dont know another song that makes me laugh with how strange it is so i can’t hate it. is this good? naur. i just love it

**terrencelovescum** (10): if the entire song was just the korean no part, i would honestly give this an 11.  i don't even care about the rest of the song, the no part is just so entrancing

**throwaway-7650** (10): 청순? naur. sexy? naur. aegyo? naur. 착한 척... red lip? #NAUR.

**whoisValensi** (10): I think it was around this era where I realized Seungyeon is god. Best wishes to Yujin with Kep1er tho!!!! So proud of her for being able to redebut!!! Shame CLC never fully saw success because they really did deserve it.

**sage** (9.8): Slaybak? Yass. Werqing? Yass. Diva? Yass. Boots Down? Yass.

**akanewasright** (9.5): The way this group is probably dead and now we’re just going to be punching it’s decaying corpse this rate

**TiltControls** (9.5): where was this when I was being asked to choose YES or YES

**toyletpauper** (9.4): Red lip? No. Earrings? No. High heels? No. Bad song? No.

**-mczrv-** (9): M/V timestamp 2:42

**anothertown** (9): absolutely destroyed meghan trainer here

**bespectacIed** (9): Fly high, angles... Yujin is at least thriving on kep1er but I wish the rest are too, especially Yeeun aka one of the cuntiest fiercest idols to have ever debuted :(

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I originally had this at a 5 but then that “Red Lip? NAUUURR” part happened at the end. I went back and relistened and it jumped up four points.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this song... yes

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): the way soyeon fed this to clc and they chewed up every last crumb

**PSSST12** (9): kinda generic but still goes off so

**TragicKingdom1** (9): slutboppiest song in the rate award

**vayyiqra** (9): kind of based and written by Soyeon so

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.9): another group Cube didn’t know how to promote. I’m so happy Yujin was able to re-debut

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): this did NOT go where i was expecting in a *good* way

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): Red lip? No. Earrings? No. High heel? No. Handbag? NO.

**yatcho** (8.8): gay catnip

**agentofscranton** (8.5): good for yujin getting a second chance but seungyeon and yeeun are too talented to wither under cube.

**becca** (8.5): RED LIP NAUR?  EARRINGS NAUR? HIGH HEEL NAUR? HAND BAG NAUR?

**bulforster** (8.5): pussy

**prada** (8.5): bop but EXTREMELY overrated

**superr\_rad** (8.5): one of very few feminist-leaning songs we get in kpop!! Clc are those bitches, fuck cube!!!

**Victerade** (8.5): RED LIP NOW! EARRINGS NOW! HIGH HEEL NOW! HAND BAG NOW! material gorwl song of kpop

**billie\_\_** (8): yeeun owns this song, her slow whispered bit is unbelievable.

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Red lip NO!

**JohnnyToby** (8): that chorus is so good

**moonagenightmares** (8): THE OPENING DJSDSKDNJS ??? its camp

**runaway3212** (8): Yasss

**waluigiest** (8): boosted my score because it’s camp

**welcome2thejam** (8): Do I specifically know why this in-your-face, over-the-top style track works better than others that do that in this very rate? No.

**BasedButta** (7.5): iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I can’t believe they copied Megan Trainor’s flow

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): when they said no to aegyo I felt that

**seanderlust** (7.3): red lip, drank, earrings, drank, sit down, no, stand up, no

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): fun camp moment

**apatel27** (7): It's different at least

**Bryoneehhh\_** (7): not hobgoblin or black dress??? sick

**chancehugs** (7): I remember this song was part of a trend to not have a final chorus. I hated this trend. I'm glad it got CLC their first ever win, but it's not my favorite song.

**Cooler\_lin** (7): another song where the instrumental went crazy... the bridge and chorus> a great song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): is this the origin story of the high heels emoji

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): If I don’t hear some Meghan Trainor during the reveal I’m gonna be pissed

**note\_2\_self** (7): I like Me better

**rikarikachan** (7): Meh, not my favorite CLC song. But, CLC is (was...) one of the few girl crush groups that pulls it off.

**RiviereDeMemoires** (7): I would have chosen Black Dress for them

**reiichitanaka** (6.5): Something about the “No”s just doesn’t work for me, a pity because there are other parts that are great - probably my least favorite Soyeon song has had a hand on.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): but consider for a moment....... yes

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Can’t decide if the whole “Lipstick? No?” thing is annoying or actually genius

ggsmackdown: # Day 3? No

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.9): i think i like it? but i don't really like it?

**anarkyah** (5): Bold but it fell flat in some parts

**DefaultPophead** (5): I wanted to like this, I really did *high heel emoji*

**en#8502** (5): me after listening to this song:

**ke1per** (5): I don't love the delivery on the chorus but the final 1/4 of the song is great

**Round\_Log401** (5): This one is difficult. I LOVE the message, more of this in kpop! But I just can't get myself to like the sound of it, really dislike the talking part. The song sounds very choppy to me, it just doesn't flow for me. I really wanted to like this one. I really like them as a group, they're so talented, I feel like they're literally THE underrated group & I think it's bc they've been getting meh songs throughout most of their career. They all have the talent, the company just doesn't seem to want to put time or money into them.

**sabooyah** (5): Average.

**mimins** (4.5): sounds like 6 different bad songs. I liked the chorus and ending a lot though

**bigbigbee** (4): i think the recurring ""red lip? no. high heel? no."" is weird considering they're in red lips, high heels, full glam in the MVs and stages. I know it's not a song about judging people who like that stuff, it's more like "I'm not interested in these things / I'm bored by them", but I’ve still never thought it fit. I also think that only 2 members of CLC max can pull off the haughty disdain thing. plus CLC can be really nasal which i can only get past when I like the music better. but the song is OK.

**GapeCod** (4): Red lip? No. Earrings? No. High heel? No. Land back? Yes!

**cuttackone** (3): people hyping clc always just wanted to root for any kind of underdog

**intheaftermath** (3): if i wanted to hear someone chant beauty-related words, I'd play Just Dance [Toddrick's Version]

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i liked the intro to this so much more than i liked the actual song :(

**bookthieving** (2): mitski wrote "should've been me" about clc's representation in this rate

**ebooks#5454** (2): giving meghan trainor a light job for her money

**pig-serpent** (2): I love when "What's the name of this song" and "Should I listen to it" have the same answer.

**2dina3dworld** (1): this is what people who don’t like Blackpink thinks Blackpink sounds like

**Zypker125** (1): This is by far CLC's worst title track in their "girl crush" era. ME and Helicopter are absolute flames, for example.

# Wait, no??

**celladonn** (10): Day 1? No

**lady\_sable** (9): cube entertainment? NO

**ImADudeDuh** (8): rate winner? No (probably)

**anagalisgv** (7.5): naaaauw

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): No

**nosnoop** (7): Too many No....

**nt96** (6): NAOOoouuuww

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): is it good? no

**DraculaWeekend** (3): This song? No

**ggal2020** (3): red lip? no. earrings? no. high heels? no. handbag? no. comeback? no! clc stayed in nugudom because they made bad music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): :naur:

**SkylarV** (2): No, just no. The title is exactly how I feel about this song

**thegirlin512** (2): This song? No.

**cremeebrulee** (1): naur

**wavingwolves** (4.8): Their biggest song in the rate... and also their worst. They got rid of their more orchestral sound in favour of... whatever this is and it worked! This song was a huge hit for them, the biggest in their careers but I can't say the pay off was worth if it sounds like this. This song has at least grown on me and I think the main ''NONSTOP'' hook is really catchy, so I can understand why this had so many people into it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): The fact they literally had an amazing streak of title tracks since their debut up until Nonstop…yet THIS is the song that brought them so much success :skull: To its credit, “saljjak seollesseo nan” kept getting stuck in my head for a good six months after this came out but I just HATE this trop pop drop.

---

# Cowboys 

**-chilazon-** (10): One of the best choruses in kpop! Also, "Iiiiii have to go to the bed by niiiine" so cute

**bluetriangles04** (10): The hype behind Nonstop was well deserved.

**chancehugs** (10): That chorus is an absolute earworm. Purple's one of my favorite colors so the MV having a purple color scheme gives it brownie points. Mimi absolutely popped off here.

**ggal2020** (10): back to school commercial music but make it good

**GREY** (10): a certain discord server making my blood boil whenever this absolute slay gets .nped and i have to deal with 5 downvotes and someone named "roman roy updates" telling me how absolute ass it is and how its the worst song theyve ever heard in their entire life from birth to right now

**JohnnyToby** (10): Ruan u SLAYED thank you

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): amazing. Show stopping. The chorus hypes me up so much

**PSSST12** (10): a little basic compared to their previous work but it works.

**Round\_Log401** (10): Literally one of the best songs of 2020.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): God this song is so fucking addicting nobody has done it like this since Sistar.

**2dina3dworld** (9.7): wow I love this song, there’s no way a survival show could ruin this for me!

**AssailantArcturus** (9.5): i just think that mimi

**ke1per** (9.5): love a board game concept

**TiltControls** (9.5): I wasn't expecting the song to actually stop. I feel lied to by the title

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): that postchorus...yeah its a hit

**becca** (9): YASSSSSS HYOJUNG ATE WE LOVE YOU HYOJUNG.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9): i loved it when it came out

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (9): it was great already then sudden yeehaw

**KoolFunk** (9): unexpected, I like it.

**pig-serpent** (9): I'm so used to tropical house being one of the blandest genres of music that my brain isn't quite sure how to process a tropical house song actually being a fun summery jam. It lives up to the potential of the genre I didn't know it had.

**thegirlin512** (9): Like a perfect combo of Dolphin and the others, this one was really cute. At least, until whatever that alleged rap was.

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): hard to argue with that synth melody, and letting Mimi rap her ass off was a good idea for their new direction

**ChickyDipper** (8.5): I too have to go to the bed by night, very relatable

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I know this is divisive among Miracles but I really enjoy this a lot. It's tropical house injected with the right amount of bubblegum rush

**MimisChoice9763** (8.5): a banger

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): utter earworm, and a *tropical* one at that!

**Victerade** (8.3): i didnt like it a single bit at first but were on better terms now. the repetitive beat in the background is v fun

**-mczrv-** (8.2): iconic m/v thumbnail

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**bigbigbee** (8): I don’t think that this is that GOOD, but I get why it was a huge hit - it sticks in your head. And that stickiness worked on me as well

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): SALJAK SEOLESEO NAN!!

**rikarikachan** (8): It's fine if a bit generic, got totally overshadowed by Dolphin. Great (post?)chorus/drop

**savemeaseat143** (8): upbeat pop!

**BooksAndWhisky** (7.8): Only the Grinch would dislike this cute happy bop

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is cute

**apatel27** (7.5): I can vibe with this. The drop doesn't disappoint like others in this rate. The tropical house sound really helps.

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): A song with great vocals, generic production, and awful rap! Classic kpop!

**en#8502** (7.5): not a bad song but i didn't expect them to change their sound so much

**Zypker125** (7.3): This song would be CRUCIFIED if a boy group did it and be labelled as "generic/bland", but because it's a girl group it'll get a pass.

**bulforster** (7.1): not very ambitious but still cute

**bespectacIed** (7): fun

**CrimsonROSET** (7): so much monopoly in these MVs! And for what!

**RaphaelArthur** (7): good vocals and catchy but almost generic and outdated

**skargardin** (7): cute bopper

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this is fun and the rap was v enjoyable

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pretty fun to listen to

**whoisValensi** (7): Hmmmm maybe I should go back and give them a try again cause is better than I remember it being. Still not as "slay", as the kids say, as their early early work but this is fun I guess!

**babadork** (6.9): Is the teddy bear supposed to be lecherous?

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): yassified ted

**seanderlust** (6.6): Mimi really said "idk write your own verse i'm tired"

**BasedButta** (6.5): not really a fan but im glad this made em famous

**ebooks#5454** (6.5): now that teddy bear...what's his story?

**Cooler\_lin** (6): this is what izone were striving for with their last two tracks (i listened to the artists backwards btw) fun, catchy but nothing special to me

**kaguraa** (6): Their strong suit is NOT summer songs

**runaway3212** (6): ya


# PLEASE, STOP!!!! STOP IT NOW!!!!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): hmmm i kinda hate this chorus

**intheaftermath** (5.5): how do you write like tomorrow won't arrive? how do you write like you need it to survive?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This is simultaneously doing a lot and not really doing that much. Also yee haw.

**celladonn** (5): Really do not get why this was so popular

**ivyleaf33** (5): come thru budget, but i definitely miss the ethereal concept

**note\_2\_self** (5): For some reason this one annoys me

**slimboyfriend** (5): The instrumental chorus hook sounds like Better When I'm Dancing by Meghan Trainor which is a song that will play on loop when I die and am condemned to endlessly wander the aisles of Target in hell. So I'm pretty indifferent to this.

**throwaway-7650** (5): FUCK this (it broke OMG's 10/10 run of title tracks)

**anarkyah** (4): Very catchy chorus but ultimately boring for the rest of the song sadly

**anothertown** (4): now who left a royalty free beat in the playlist

**cuttackone** (4): tbh i really never liked omg before dun dun dance

**dlong56655** (4): This blew them up but its kinda bad

**frogaranaman** (4): lotta nonsense in this song

**mimins** (4): it was...something.

**SkylarV** (4): There's good trop-house, but this song isn't

**Awkward\_King** (3): i liked it when their music sounded like princess peach could win a minigame to it

**DaBigBoi** (3): For a song titled nonstop, it really stops at the horrid beat drop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Unnecessary rap breaks that destroy the momentum of the song… why do we keep allowing them to happen?

**prada** (3): this aged so bad but mimi queen of effort-rapping it’s ok queen

**moonagenightmares** (2): oh that is so fucking bad

**sabooyah** (2): Very squeaky throughout and I hate it.

**terrencelovescum** (2): the chorus would fit right in mario kart soundtrack. coconut mall maybe?

**sage** (1.3): horrid ass song omfg this never ends

**pornypete** (0): It pains me that THIS song was their big break, and Remember Me (the masterpiece) was ignored.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Easily the best lineup from any Produce 101 show. Literally so many SLAYERS here, plus Sohye who laid the groundwork for untalented-but-charming contestants in future seasons. This song is so amazing too - when JYP gets it right, he gets it RIGHT.

**wavingwolves** (10): MADNESS!!!!!! This is one of my favourite songs ever, a massive 11 contender, it makes me go fully feral and it's one of the most addicting songs I've ever heard. It's literally a perfect song in every single way. I love their voices and chemistry together, I love the production, I love the vocal melodies and their delivery, I love how each member gets a little moment to shine, I love how I can never get tired of this song and I even love the JYP intro here because I find it funny. It's also by miles and miles the best song I.O.I have ever released and also the best song from a Produce 101 group EVER. Sorry to Wanna One (who came the closest with Energetic) and to IZ*ONE, but it's the truth!

---

# More More More

**hikkaru** (11): this song is so good even jyp eats on that intro

**huntyphobic** (11): Best song ever made and I’m dead serious

**JohnnyToby** (11): You can feel Sejeong's pain in Her ad libs. rip ioi the perfect group

**2l82bstr8** (10): the rare kind of song that's all things to all people

**agentofscranton** (10): the pure rush of adrenaline from nayoung and mina's raps should be studied

**AssailantArcturus** (10): i just think that chung ha

**bigbigbee** (10): This is in a competition with Energetic for best song to come out of any Produce 101 group. It sticks in your head and it has iconic point choreography (something that I really miss in K-pop!); it feels like EVERYONE was doing the neomu neomu neomu dance

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That chorus is very very very catchy.

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): 3m27s of nothing but pure serotonin

**dlong56655** (10): IOI will always be so special to me you had to be there

**GREY** (10): demon in the center i jumped but its okay SOHYE slay prevailed as per

**PSSST12** (10): Listen, your not gonna get it a first few times . . .

**rikarikachan** (10): neomu neomu neomu, neomu neomu neomu neomu neomu neomu, neoooomu neomu neomu

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSS

**skargardin** (10): this is such a smash im obsessed

**throwaway-7650** (10): so kind of JYP to donate a PAK to i.o.i from twice <3

**whoisValensi** (10): You motherfuckers fail to realize how much of a MOMENT this song was if you weren't there at the time. I mean... the biggest girl group at the time, collabing with fucking JYP?!?!?!!?!? That's a fucking MOMENT. Thankfully I was there at the time and can tell you that, yes, it is still a MOMENT to this day lol.

**en#8502** (9.5): IOI! JYP! FINALLY! YALL READY?

**ggal2020** (9.5): the only kpop song where I physically cannot stop myself from doing the dance when it comes on

**1998tweety** (9): this is lowkey one of the songs that got me into k-pop. My brother would play a bunch of kpop songs and I was like hold awn this kinda bops. The I.O.I girls kinda deserved more compared to the other Produce groups but oh well we will take what we can get.

**BasedButta** (9): NOMUNOMUNOMUNOMUNOMU

**ChickyDipper** (9): I still have no damn idea what's happening in this music video but god I love it

**cuttackone** (9): slaps to ridicilous degree

**jasannn** (9): this is 3rd gen Kpop’s Gee.

**Nixon4Prez** (9): I miss I.O.I so much :(

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): bop

**superr\_rad** (9): try listening to this without getting the chorus stuck in your head. That’s right, you cant!!!!

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.9): not my favorite but it’s definitely an iconic debut

**sage** (8.8): bop

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): absurd how easy this got stuck in frickin head

**Cooler\_lin** (8.5): this was the first song i listened to when i started this and i forgot how good it was.

**Victerade** (8.5): repetitive but a slayer

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): very very very good

**bookthieving** (8): had to deduct a point for the jyp jumpscare

**chancehugs** (8): Love how everyone got a chance to shine, and Mina's rap hits hard. The fadeoff at the end feels anticlimatic tho.

**DaBigBoi** (8): I don’t rlly love Somi, but I have to thank her presence in I.O.I for allowing JYP to have a hand in this hit!

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Used to jam

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): this is a bit like eating a can of frosting by itself but like… I’ve done that before I guess so I can’t judge

**lady\_sable** (8): i miss themmmm

**mengzhongmeng** (8): iconic set of girls and the digipedi mv is great, fun times!

**moonagenightmares** (8): their one good song

**RaphaelArthur** (8): catchy and unique song but big disparity in the vocals

**rubbie** (8): the JYP tag took me by surprise, but this is a pleasant track. Some parts veer on the annoying side of catchy though

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this would be the sound on a tiktok that says "if you like this song you have adhd"

**billie\_\_** (7.5): love a hyperactive kpop moment. still the best produce group.

**mimins** (7.5): another classic!

**Round\_Log401** (7.5): It's iconic, it's weird but I like that. One of the most catchy songs I've ever heared.

**TiltControls** (7.5): It's one (1) very worth of good

**ivyleaf33** (7): rewatching this and knowing where the girls are now is so strange

**rotating3Dtext** (7): I swear we rated this like 3 times already

**sabooyah** (7): Their best title track hands down and they were only going uphill, a shame they had so little time as a group.

**terrencelovescum** (7): the blueprint for love4eva. the chorus is just a bit too repetitive.

**toyletpauper** (7): A bit annoying but addicting.

**-mczrv-** (6.5): not really my vibe but the chorus likes to sneak into my thoughts from time to time

**Esh\_Kebab** (6.5): The rap verse blows the rest of the song away.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): As much as I love IOI their discography was pretty bad for a top tier GG. Should've just released ITSP as a single and called it a day tbh.

**thGnerd** (6.5): Neomu Neomu Neomu

**Zypker125** (6.5): Fell out of love with this song recently, it's catchy but it just stays in the exact same tone throughout and feels incredibly one-dimensional, even for K-Pop standards.

**Awkward\_King** (6): why they tickling me i dont like that

**CrimsonROSET** (6): very very very very very very

**DefaultPophead** (6): Very annoying, I'm sorry. If this makes it past the first day, I'll die a little on the inside.

**ke1per** (6): voices are a bit too nasally for me to enjoy a chorus with a lot of 'u's in it

**pig-serpent** (6): We stan Thanksgiving queens. They gobble gobble gobble.

**vayyiqra** (6): kind of annoying but catchy

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Yes, the lyrics are kinda stupid but that doesn’t matter when you have a song as good as this :) This song is so sweet and, for the 6th time, I am going to say we need this sound back!! Also whoever produced this bridge…I am going to kiss you on the mouth.

**wavingwolves** (10): THE PRODUCTION IN THIS!!! I'm eternally obsessed, especially once the chorus hits and you fully get to the marvellous synths, ugh. It's immaculate and if the world was a little bit fairer this would be a top 15 song. I'm sure this sounds pretty different from the rest of the rate when you consider it's only one of two songs released in 2015, since we decided to include some songs that the first rate missed to give them a proper opportunity to shine, but I think that might have worked against them when it came to new ears. Still, Lovelyz deserved better than to be the first group to be completely out of the rate and I'll never forgive any of you.

# People who are standing in the right side of history 


**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This song is magical, it’s hard for me to collect my thoughts on it but the thing that really gets me is how it feels so… genuine? Which isn’t really something I usually say about Kpop songs but there’s real emotion here in the performance and in the lyrics that it feels like the music is bringing out. This really captures what being young and “in love” was like for me: sweet, sincere, *silly*, and a little sad. There’s melancholy here, much of the song is more about longing for someone and dreaming of love but being unable to get it, but then the music explodes into these moments of pure joy that make the whole ordeal worth it. The sad piano breakdown (a callback to the gorgeous intro to the song) that leads into the semi-a cappella section where they kick back against the ennui and SLAM the music back into existence… there’s so much power there. The music is surprisingly more sophisticated than you’d expect so I don’t expect this to get too far because of how subdued and restrained it is but make no mistake, this is the zenith of the “innocent concept” song.

**2dina3dworld** (10): *insert comment about the current panorama*

**2l82bstr8** (10): the first super-spreader event in recorded history (and also the best)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): In a rate full of adorable songs…this might be the queen.

**throwaway-7650** (10): me suggesting this as an interlude for blow... my mind

**pig-serpent** (8.5): This is really cute!

**yatcho** (8.5): wait this MV is a Wes Anderson short

**savemeaseat143** (8.4): great song but I don't understand the sneezing angle

**seanderlust** (8.3): Your words like "You are my special friend"/I hate them/My half-written letter and/my love that I never got to tell you" the girls are YEARNINGGGG!!!!

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): I like cute things

**-chilazon-** (8): Nice sweet song, a catchy classic. Just a bit too shrill, but it works. Love the instrumental

**dlong56655** (8): honestly their only song I can even remember

**JohnnyToby** (8): cute

**Nixon4Prez** (8): Eternal classic

**nt96** (8): OMG THEY GOT CORONA

**bulforster** (7.8): the somewhat fuzzy vocals make this just a little too cutesy for my tastes

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Certainly not my favorite Lovelyz song but perhaps their most iconic, and just really cute, tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this gives me video game end credit music for some reason

**lady\_sable** (7.5): idk how they didn't get their first win for this

**rikarikachan** (7.3): I didn't know a song could be too cute for me. Points for being a classic

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.1): bless you

**apatel27** (7): It's cute

**billie\_\_** (7): an especially nice bridge.

**Cooler\_lin** (7): as groovy and catchy as ever. the instrumental is like nerds and cotton candy soda for your ears. I love how the bridge took a darker turn just for a key change to happen right afterwards.

**ebooks#5454** (7): is this,,,a song about a sneeze???

**MToms** (7): bless you

**TiltControls** (7): Gesundheit!

**vayyiqra** (7): go sneeze girl

**Zypker125** (6.8): Man, these lyrics are cringy AF and it's hard to get over (which idk why, this is K-Pop I know, but for some reason I find these especially reductive, ex. "I found someone I'd like to cook for").

**chancehugs** (6.5): I thought I would hate it based off the name, but surprisingly I didn't. Wouldn't add it to my playlist, but wouldn't skip it.

**en#8502** (6.5): tbh i don't think you should be around a guy that makes you sneeze but yall stay safe 🙏🙏

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): bless you

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): making light of respiratory symptoms? during a pandemic? :/

**anothertown** (6): the chorus is really fun and charming especially the half acapella one right after the bridge! but everything else falls apart around it

**PSSST12** (6): i mean if this is one of their best songs I ca understand why they never found much success.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): these lyrics are kinda camp

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ah, I recognize this song from one of those dumb k-pop lyrics youtube compilations. That can’t be a good sign…

**welcome2thejam** (6): Cute, but a bit too sugary for my tastes

**wavingwolves** (9.433): I love Lovelyz as a group since they have the type of bright ethereal synth-filled and slightly weeb-y sound that I always gravitate towards. Other groups in the rate do it just as well, WJSN and GFRIEND are particular favourites of mine, but Lovelyz feels like a diamond in the rough for being even more underrated compared. A group that have recently disbanded, they have my highest group average together with WJSN and I'm incredibly bummed out about their performance here on top of everything else. #JUSTICEFORLOVELYZ #FUCKWOOLLIM

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.167): Queens! Sad they disbanded especially as Obliviate isn’t even bad. I need to finish that discography listen I was doing ages ago because I only got like two-thirds in (Baby Doll best B-side ever btw). Obviously their music isn’t for everyone but Ah-Choo at least deserved better…

**thegirlin512** (7.667): Came in blind, came out a potential Lovelyz fan.

**vayyiqra** (7.333): A group I've never heard of but they're alright. No comments head empty.

**pig-serpent** (7.000): Great cuteness factor. I can imagine the men who are way too into Kpop loving this group.

**welcome2thejam** (6.667): Not sickeningly sweet, but enough that the first two songs probably won't hit unless I'm specifically searching for that sound. This section was nice though cause I essentially got to watch their sound mature over these three videos.

**knarff21** (6.667): First time hearing all of these

**sabooyah** (6.333): I actually really dislike Lovelyz as a group but these songs aren't bad!

**anzunagi** (5.333): Twinkle is also a bop and a half

**rslashpoopheads** (5.000): The death of pure cutesy GGs is much appreciated.

**ke1per** (4.500): I appreciate the 2012-2018 K-pop vibes but it surely is not for me

**dekubaku** (4.333): Checked them out for this rate. Obliviate is clearly better than the other two. Wish we had more of this direction from them.

**mssone1993** (3.833): Thank god for the change in direction when they came back with Obliviate. I am personally not a fan of cute concepts and some of their members make me cringe with their forced cute expression so that kinds of turned me off a bit.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): A classic older GFRIEND sound, complete with melancholy lyrics about love you can’t have. I think GFRIEND were really at their best with these kinds of songs, no one could encaspsulate that sentimental feeling like them.

**wavingwolves** (10): I'll admit to being deeply biased when it comes to GFRIEND because I love them so much, but gawd, this is a masterpiece to me. TFTMN has one of my favourite GFRIEND instrumentals, slightly ominous, moderately fun and incredibly magical. I lose my mind over the [intro](https://youtu.be/PfMIkyJdxYw) and [outro](https://youtu.be/PfMIkyJdxYw?t=212) movements they do during this song and I love the more [playful](https://youtu.be/PfMIkyJdxYw?t=107) [moments](https://youtu.be/PfMIkyJdxYw?t=118) of it as well. From their titles that feature their classic signature sound, I think it makes for one of the strongest, but not everyone was as much as a fan of it as me.

# Moon Night enjoyers 

**apatel27** (11): Heads above everything else here

**RaphaelArthur** (10): masterpiece, amazing vocals, amazing music even if it's not my style

**sage** (10): literally so amazing i fucking died

**Stryxen** (10): time for the slay

**throwaway-7650** (10): bam bam bam bam bam!!!!! [korean]

**TiltControls** (10): Disney talking about their media plans in 2022

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): this feels like it could be a Cardcaptor Sakura opening (vote anime opening themes)

**rubbie** (9): The songwriting level on display is incredible, classic japanese-style song but the melodies never stop jumping at you.

**runaway3212** (9): YAsss

**SkylarV** (9): One of their best songs, really solid

**superr\_rad** (9): I have a feeling Godfriend is going to be underestimated in this rate, I hope I’m wrong but this song is just so good!!! It feels so emotional, Yuju’s vocals are insane as always, and I love the running choreo they do in the chorus!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Big hell yeah to their string use

**savemeaseat143** (8.8): the verses are really standard but there's something I love about the chorus

**KoolFunk** (8.7): I didn't know they disbanded :(

**yatcho** (8.7): They haven't quite come into their own by this point but its still a strong song and I freaking love their orchestral, anime-opening stuff. It just hits that sweet spot for me (Labyrinth and Crossroads do the same and should've been rated too!!)

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): v. sweet

**milkywayinradius** (8.5): this is definitely the opening for an anime about friendship

**Victerade** (8.5): christian horsegirl music done right!

**1998tweety** (8): Anime serve

**2l82bstr8** (8): adorable. the production and arrangements remind me a lot of classic J-pop (which isn't always a good thing, but in this case it definitely is!)

**BasedButta** (8): cant pinpoint why but its a very pleasing listening experience

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This stands out in a nice way from most of the rate.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Oh this is giving me Mario Kart Rainbow Road teas.

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Idk why but this reminds me of BTOB's I'll Be Your Man

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this sounds like a song for a jrpg

**skargardin** (8): this is growing on me with each listen omg

**whoisValensi** (8): It's actually time for me to maybe listen thru GFriend's discog.

**celladonn** (7.5): I like the strings!

**ggal2020** (7.5): more pretty girl music

**mengzhongmeng** (7.5): gfriend did this retro feeling, sweet and innocent concept so well!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I don't care for it all too much until the end

**toyletpauper** (7.5): Solid but not my favorite song under this style by them. Much prefer Me Gustas Tu, Rough, Navillera, etc.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.3): this lacks some of the OOMPH their other titles have but its still decent classic gfriend

**BooksAndWhisky** (7.2): I have no specific feelings about this, it’s nice and hits the spot

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): this is an anime ending theme

**akanewasright** (7): this is one of those songs that is Good but also not for me really. This is someone else’s 10 and I can respect that person

**anagalisgv** (7): this song makes me sad lol

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): sounds kinda like a chill anime or video game theme in some parts

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): this is an anime opening i love it

**dlong56655** (7): Makes me nostalgic for their 2015-2017 concept

**rikarikachan** (7): It feels a bit like a weaker version of Rough (which is an 11/10)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ive seen music videos from actual lesbian artists that had less homoeroticism than this mv

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is just a shoujo anime opening. I can literally hear the part where the title card shows up

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): i mean she’s cute

**ebooks#5454** (6.3): this video is too funny even tho i don't think its supposed to be (tag urself: the girl hugging the rocks)

**Bryoneehhh\_** (6): i kinda forget this as soon as i finish it

**chancehugs** (6): I appreciate the quality of the song, but it just wasn't for me.

**Cooler\_lin** (6): sounds like an anime opener but is pretty forgettable unfortunately

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (6): I think this would be good for an anime ost or something similar

**flavasavavandal** (6): It’s a nice song and all but it sounds better suited for the anime rate

**mimins** (6): it was good on first listen, but average

**nt96** (6): I'm assuming it’s the opposite of Sun Day?

**PSSST12** (6): more forgettable version of rough. They tried bringing back the sound that made them famous but failed to do so sadly.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I think I'm the only one who thinks Sunrise is the better version of this song.

**sabooyah** (6): Good but forgettable.

**terrencelovescum** (6): come on vocals! that's about it

**thegirlin512** (6): This is a really pretty song to listen to, but honestly I don't think I can remember a single part of the tune after it ended.

ggsmackdown: # Christians (Sun Day fans)

**MimisChoice9763** (5.9): sounds too similar to Sunrise which is in my opinion the better song

**cuttackone** (5): am i mad for liking crossroads WAY more although its just a tired retrain?

**frogaranaman** (5): it is moon night right now I love her

**ke1per** (5): very JRPG battle music

**pig-serpent** (5): This song spends its entire runtime threatening to turn into Snow Halation.

**vayyiqra** (5): Something about this is a bit too syrupy for me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4.8): it was okay

**-mczrv-** (4): SSFWL 2.0…

**becca** (4): ...I’m sorry I hate most of gfriend’s songs before 2019

**Round\_Log401** (4): There's nothing wrong with it but there's also nothing exciting about it for me.

**Tazzachar** (4): Anime opening credits theme

**LesApfels** (3.5): It's only 3 minutes and 46 seconds, but it felt like an eternity

**DaBigBoi** (2): I feel like the melodies are fine. Good even, but something about the percussion feels the same type of quiet throughout. The chorus could have started with a stronger drum, for example.

**prada** (2): poop break2

**vaguelycatshaped** (1): Really not my type

**sublimeMusic** (0): I feel like this is the b side for every girl group in existence that has a somewhat decent vocal line and needs album filler

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Dumdi Dumdi was actually in the rate over this, but I pushed for HANN to be included instead as it's so much better. Thank God I did as I can't imagine Dumdi Dumdi doing better than this, no shade. I love this song, it was truly such a MOMENT when this dropped. If you know you know.

**wavingwolves** (9.1): One my personal favourite titles by (G)I-DLE, I find this song really addictive and I think it deserves to be at least a few placements higher but I see their sound wasn't for everyone. I do like the way they manage to have a dynamic signature sound and I think it's at its best in this song in particular. Since this is their highest placing song, I see most of you agree!

---

# HANN! 


**RaphaelArthur** (11): masterpiece, extremely beautiful, unique and catchy music, amazing vocals

**vaguelycatshaped** (11): The perfection that is Hann was only surpassed by other songs from idle, thank you Soyeon my queen my saviour

**2dina3dworld** (10): I originally was going to choose my 11 from my most scrobbled song… this would’ve been it but while its a great song, it’s faded on me in the past few months.

**2l82bstr8** (10): how can a song this corny still manage such elegance and class?

**brpr425** (10): Ethereal and perfect. I almost gave this one the eleven!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): maybe the ethnic hip girls made some points here

**GREY** (10): imma just shout HANN and hope da gun jams

**ke1per** (10): love the anger, I feel like a rebound

**PSSST12** (10): their best song before they dropped lion.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Exactly the right proportion of words to FU FU FUs. (@Senorita)

**throwaway-7650** (10): their best title along with uh-oh (+ stream K/DA!)

**whoisValensi** (10): Lol yeah I don't see them topping this anytime soon. What a tune, what a fucking tune. That whistling just gets me going and this is extremely catchy so like yeah... Easily my favorite from them even if I can't really put it into the right words lol.

**-chilazon-** (9.5): Also new to me, also very, extremely goodddd

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Their best song, and they have many good ones

**notarobot3675** (9.5): this whole mini really impressed me

**1998tweety** (9): now THIS is the serve

**becca** (9): I like this song a lot tbh I don’t get why most people don’t like it!!! Soojin we miss u

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Definitely my favorite of the (G)-IDLE songs in the rate

**ivyleaf33** (9): it may be the embodiment of ethnic hip, but wow this is a great song

**mimins** (9): i loooveee the intro and the 'HANN' in the chorus i can actually listen to it all day

**prada** (9): deserved the latata success more!

**rubbie** (9): Stunning. This is the moment where I complain about "Lion" being absent, but this is almost as good.

**runaway3212** (9): YASSS

**sabooyah** (9): Beautiful, unique, and the choreo gets stuck in my head just as much as the song does.

**savemeaseat143** (9): the "Hann" is my favourite part of the song

**superr\_rad** (9): I really think every part of this song is good. I don’t like the choreo but that might just be because its kind of hard. This song wont feel the same without soojin, that’s for sure ☹

**vayyiqra** (9): Sometime last year I went down a rabbithole of those "words that are impossible to translate" and one was the Korean word this song is titled after. "Resentment" is kind of close I think but read this to get the full nuances: https://g-idle.fandom.com/wiki/HANN_(Alone)

**-mczrv-** (8.8): always loved this song but after watching the m/v I can see why the hype drops off lol

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.8): I like the chorus but it bores me a little bit

**Victerade** (8.7): aged bad but still an amazing song!

**en#8502** (8.5): HWAAAAAAAA.... oh wait wrong song

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): the rap break in this is great (typical). enjoyed the chorus bass guitar

**poemforsmallthings** (8.2): I was obsessed with this bridge when I first heard it and I'm obsessed with it now

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): cool whistling

**chancehugs** (8): Unlike Latata, this one caught onto me instantly.

**Cooler\_lin** (8): way too catchy. The instrumental during the rap part of the 2nd verse, the prechorus, the chorus> it's the way i bite the air when we (yes me and g-idle are singing this together) say 'HANN!' I just wish there was a bigger climax

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): no words

**CrimsonROSET** (8): girls dont wear black on the desert box it’s still hot!

**cuttackone** (8): this closing seconds are everything

**DaBigBoi** (8): Cursive singing, cursive whistle, they should have taught me cursive in grade school. I never used it from then on.

**seanderlust** (7.9): I really like when they sing in their lower registers here!

**MimisChoice9763** (7.8): very elegant which I love

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): HANN (Alone) has some interesting production here. This might be a grower for me.

**ggal2020** (7.5): and if I say soyeon carries this whole group…

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Oh I really like the chorus of this one. Foooooo foo-foo!

**DefaultPophead** (7): I want to love this because it had great moments, but something feels off. Love hearing Minnie's voice again, though!

**note\_2\_self** (7): too many fuuu fuuus

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): is this cultural appropriation [2]

**anagalisgv** (6.5): this is the inferior version of HWAA

**Round\_Log401** (6.5): I know everyone loves this but one of my least favourite title tracks from them. Can't pinpoint why.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): I considered 0ing this on first listen, not gonna lie. It’s still lowkey annoying, but I have to admit some parts do slay and the chorus sticks in your head

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): this is pretty g

**Zypker125** (6.3): Honestly, Hwaa is the better version of this track.

**BooksAndWhisky** (6): I’m sorry I truly cannot get over the way they say boo. The whistling is the best part of this song


# HANN???????

**ignitethephoenix** (6): what is this chorus

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): ehhhh

**thedoctordances1940** (5.6): kinda bad but also there's some good production and some nice melodies in there

**BasedButta** (5.5): the sparseness is better used here than on the previous song

**intheaftermath** (5.5): I know they're the same person but Soyeon REALLY sounds like Akali on this one... she's phenomenal but I'm just not a fan of the composition

**Bryoneehhh\_** (5): what

**lalafairy18** (5): This song feels like oh my god and hwaa combined

**SkylarV** (5): An okay song only because of the chorus

**thegirlin512** (5): I really like the intro, but the rest is a little meh.

**bulforster** (4.9): not another snoozefest of a chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (4): https://soundcloud.com/penceravid/hanh

**JohnnyToby** (4): can't stand the whisting tbh

**bespectacIed** (3): that one iconic tweet saying "imma just scream HANN and hope the gun jams" .... IF YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): this song feels like im sinking and no one is pulling me back out

**ebooks#5454** (2): you could tell me this was a clean bandit song and i would believe you

**thGnerd** (2): Idle suffers extremely hard from the fact that they just make random noises in almost all of their title tracks for no reason

**sage** (1.8): this is so bad omfg soyeons pen needs to go... the only good songs shes been involved with are no and DESSERT

**terrencelovescum** (1): the whistles and those high pitched sounds in the chorus...it's gonna be a no for me.

**Stryxen** (0): now why did they put that one sound that sounds like my home phone in thot i was getting a call and that stressed me out fuck this song

ggsmackdown: # (G)I-DLE

---

**Overall Average**: 7.062 **// Average Controversy:** 2.153 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/S1ynrZh.png)**

---

**wavingwolves** (8.033): (G)I-DLE is an interesting group, to say the least. They can be polarizing internationally, especially because of the discussions over their use of different international [genres](https://www.asianjunkie.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/SoyeonEthnicHip.png). Despite that, they have found a moderate level of success and have a pretty stablished brand and reconizable members. Last year, they managed to even have a chart topping song with [HWAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3szNvgQxHo), their last comeback to date and the last song they'll ever release with former member Soojin, who went to leave the group after bullying controversies were brought up against her. If you liked their music here, I highly recommend their projects, their b-sides are at times even better than the titles, and check out their next comeback that'll be out next month!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.000): Another group where I would eagerly check for each new release and now their music has kinda fallen off for me :skull: And it doesn't help that Slayer Of The Group Soojin had to leave! Soyeon is amazingly talented though and I love seeing more female idols be involved with production and songwriting.

**-chilazon-** (9.833): I only knew a few of their more recent songs before this, but I am DEFINITELY going to do a full run through of their discography now. Jeon Soyeon, the woman you are.

**AxymHeart** (9.667): Talent runneth over, Soojin will be missed

**mimins** (9.333): i recently discovered them and fell completely in love. what a discography man.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.267): Cube I hate you so much. Free my girl Soojin she did nothing

**reiichitanaka** (9.167): One of my favorite things is kpop is when the music takes advantage of contrasting voices, and Soyeon definitely knows what she’s doing in that department. For me their voices are a huge part of what gives (G)I-DLE’s songs their unique flavor.

**ke1per** (9.000): who hurt ya'll

**dekubaku** (8.667): Wonderful group. Soyeon did a great job with this group and all members bring something unique to the table. Plus, unpopular opinion but Dumdi Dumdi is better than OMG.

**runaway3212** (8.667): First off all fuck u cube, second off these girls are super cool and I genuinely hope that more girl groups become more involved in the creative process

**Cooler\_lin** (8.500): this lineup was cheating idc idc

**whoisValensi** (8.333): Oh thank god 'Senorita' wasn't in this rate I'd give it a 2. Now I'll admit, (G)I-DLE were doing the ol' "I like every other song they put out" thing for me for a while but I think I'm at a point where I just consistently love their output (except 'HWAA', didn't like that one and 'DUMDi DUMDi' kinda exists lol, MAYBE WE ARE STILL 50/50 ON THAT OUTPUT AFTER ALL IDK LOL). Thank fuck it took less time than TWICE did lol. Beyond that I don't think I got too too much to say about them beyond 'HANN' was an 11 contender.

**Round\_Log401** (8.167): I love them so much. They have some of the most unique voices in kpop + they have Soyeon, one of the best rappers + her writing & producing. Soojin girly, I miss u!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.833): Any group that is self-produced will automatically catch my attention. The song selections of (G)-IDLE group are truly excellent and brought something a really unique sound for 4th gen girl groups. Soyeon is a freaking genius producer tbh. ( (G)-IDLE bias: Soyeon)

**vayyiqra** (7.667): A group I know from their links with K/DA, lol. (Speaking of which, who were ROBBED in the EP rate.) Idk why it took so long to listen to their solo music but it's good.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.667): I feel like they've been in limbo ever since Hann but Dumdi Dumdi was fun.

**throwaway-7650** (7.333): justice for uh-oh/lion (and most K/DA songs with idle tbh)

**fadedblue09** (6.167): Among these 4tb gen "girlcrush-lite" groups, they're probably my favorite, very distinctive vocals and Soyeon's reputation speaks for itself. The one thing I'm letdown is their production choices which I find really generic

**pig-serpent** (5.833): Finally a restrained group. Sometimes their restrait will lead to boring songs but when it works (or is just okay) I'm thankful for it after everyone else in this rate.

**welcome2thejam** (5.667): Nothing bad, but nothing standout either. Can't imagine myself remembering much about this bloc by next month

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5.500): I liked them better as part of K/DA

**donutseer** (5.333): CLC-lite, with half the quality songwriting and composition.

**Tazzachar** (5.000): This is a group I am not familiar with, the rapper is one of the best in this generation based on first listen

**apatel27** (4.333): Why do all these sound almost a decade old despite being released within the past 4 years

**toyletpauper** (4.167): None of their tracks I’ve liked so far. Not my style. And I don’t think Soyeon is a bad producer however, because she has made CLC’s No so I don’t understand why I don’t like any of G-IDLE’s songs. If I had to give a reason, its that I feel like most of their songs rely too much on their great vocals/rap ability, that I feel like the production is a bit lazy. I really want to like them, but nothing they have shown gives me a reason to.

**bespectacIed** (4.000): fly high, angles??? Maybe? Or not? Soojin damn it you were one of the fiercest girls in the game, i was rooting for u we were ALL rooting for u

**ebooks#5454** (1.333): pls just stay in korea for your m/v's bc these feel like cultural appropriation acksskdslld

**wavingwolves** (6.8): Their best song in the rate, I said what I said! I guess people found this too derivative of their previous songs listed, which I can understand, but I think this is much more nice sounding and it kind of elevates their signature sound to the highest degree possible, since their group contract was up not long after and they didn't manage to get the chance to try to top this ~~if you don't count [D-D-Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5zFbngjX-k), that is, which is actually better than this song~~.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): This is definitely my favourite IZ\*ONE song ~~although that isn't saying much~~. It's pretty cute but I stopped listening to it like 3 days after it released. It deserved to place the highest out of the 3 IZ\*ONE songs!

---


# Ringing their bells

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (11): Infused with crack and it needs 80 grammys

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): banger!

**becca** (10): BEST DISBANDMENT SONG

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): this is one of the best disbandment songs ever… one of the best songs ever i dare say. hurt me so bad to not give this an 11

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I can imagine how the release of Panorama might be a bittersweet feeling for IZ\*ONE stans but they are lucky that this bop serves as their disbandment song. IZ*ONE served and went out with a bang with Panorama.

**en#8502** (10): this song is a mess, but a good mess. like the kind of mess that makes you go yasss slay

**GREY** (10): genuinely a perfect pop song

**ke1per** (10): very satisfying thwacky percussion and a gorgeous final chorus extension

**Nixon4Prez** (10): IZ\*ONE's sound distilled and perfected

**PSSST12** (10): the only miss in their discog is the swan song i Fear. .

**runaway3212** (10): YAASSSSS!

**sage** (10): my izone.. we miss you..

**Tazzachar** (10): The beat goes off hard in this song especially in the intro, pre chorus, and chorus

**terrencelovescum** (10): started off with a bang and just kept on going.

**whoisValensi** (10): I am like 85% sure I saw the premiere of this song while watching an awards show one year, MAMA I think. Thought it was an interesting track then, still is.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.8): the Wonyoung walk memes made me a fan not gonna lie

**-mczrv-** (9.6): gets me every time

**DaBigBoi** (9.5): O\*ZONE

**yatcho** (9.2): another serve, crazy they disbanded so quickly they're showing the skill and confidence of a well seasoned group here

**chancehugs** (9): IZ\*ONE really perfected their sound by this comeback. Such a shame it was their last.

**glitter408** (9): iconic

**jasannn** (9): noisy done right

**poemforsmallthings** (9): It's loud and overwhelming to the ears and I love it so much

**Roxieloxie** (9): covid music but fun

**rslashpoopheads** (9): A little shrill but still a banger.

**Victerade** (9): an amazing disbandment song tbh they put their izussy into this song then disappeared

**xedophobic** (9): a bit similar to fiesta but it makes my brain tick more

**1998tweety** (8.5): big bop [2]

**akanewasright** (8.5): ~~weakest iz\*one song perhaps (could grow on me)~~ it grew on me

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): me taking photos in my boring ass kitchen for no reason:

**bulforster** (8.5): the only one of their drops in the rate to properly pick up the momentum of the song

**ChickyDipper** (8.5): a great song but I still wish they had lowered the pitch of some of the members down a bit because my god is some of it high and shrill

**JohnnyToby** (8.5): something's up with the weird mixing especially in the chorus

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): this is literally a #worse mashup of violet and fiesta

**bespectacIed** (8): shoot! take a panorama sooo iconic

**RaphaelArthur** (8): beautiful song with strong beat but sounds overproduced overall

**thegirlin512** (8): Strong for a final single.

**intheaftermath** (7.5): it's really exciting but almost too exciting... it's so hyper that the chorus doesn't "pop" as much as it could with a more tame verse

**notallslendermen** (7.5): I'd like this more if it weren't pitched so damn high

**CrimsonROSET** (7): *points to fiesta* they’re the same picture

**DefaultPophead** (7): Might not be one of my most highest scoring songs in the rate, but it's getting added to my personal playlist ASAP.

**hunnybee12** (7): knowing what wonyoung is capable now in ive her izone vocals make me cringe

**rubbie** (7): The melody during the chorus is quite nice, reminds me of GFriend a bit

**BasedButta** (6.5): its good but i could really live without it theres nothing noteworthy here

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why are their voices so high pitched



# Refuses to take a panorama so they can promptly forget about it 


**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Sometimes just being loud is not enough.

**pig-serpent** (6): What is there to say about this one?

**prada** (6): mediocre song and annoying vocals

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): idk it doesnt really do anything particularly special

**TiltControls** (6): There are some nice parts but the song just falls a bit flat for me

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The synths are a bit grating

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): I was so disappointed when this came out because it sounded like a bland version of the rest of their title tracks. Still feel the same about it, sorry 🤷‍♀️

**mengzhongmeng** (5.5): it's fine, nothing new, nothing special

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): there was so much going on idk what to think. like it's not bad but ??? maybe just not for me

**BooksAndWhisky** (5): Can’t stand some of the members’ voices in this (but the instrumental is great)

**Zypker125** (4.6): I still can't stand Hitomi's/Nako's/Sakura's/Hyewon's/Wonyoung's vocals, I find them either too nasally, squeaky, overly high-pitched, and/or weak-sounding, and they legitimately bring down all of IZ\*ONE's songs for me. Nothing against them as people, but in terms of their vocals I can never enjoy them.

**2l82bstr8** (4): there's better ways to go deaf but this is alright I guess

**apatel27** (4): It's just loud

**billie\_\_** (4): all of these iz\*one songs sound basically identical.

**-chilazon-** (3): Again I have the same issue as Fiesta, way too high pitched, too many sounds, it hurts my ears.

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): um anyway

**cuttackone** (3): i like ive why cant i get into iz\*one

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i do not like this

**mimins** (3): if fiesta was high and processed, this is that but on multiple monster energy drinks

**Round\_Log401** (3): Fiesta's sister. Respecfully I can't.

**Cooler\_lin** (2): the beginning instrumentals are so nice but the vocals ruined the song for me unfortunately. i want some depth, the instrumental had so much potential D;

**sabooyah** (2): Those extremely processed, pitched up, incredibly high vocals especially in the chorus though...jail time for whomever did that.

**celladonn** (0): Like an even less good version of Fiesta. I really don't like anything about this

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): I do actually like this, I think it has a great nostalgia factor, but at the same time it’s just kinda meh to me? I never feel the desire to go listen to it and actually I’m kinda surprised this is the BP song that easily performed the best. But on second thought, maybe not so surprising as it is their least BLACKPINK-sounding song and I gather you guys aren’t a fan of that lmao

**wavingwolves** (1): Considering this is the highest placement for BLACKPINK, I guess my opinion that this is the worst song of theirs in the rate is unpopular? Honestly, this feels like a song some intern at YG Entertainment found in a HD hidden in a random cabinet from back when 2NE1 was still up and kicking and consequently gave it to Teddy who released it because he had nothing better to give BLACKPINK anyway. And yeah, even though this is a song that *finally* has a full sung chorus I still can't appreciate because said chorus is horrible to my ears. Chanting choruses were always bad, but this might be one of the worst examples of that. I'm also personally not a fan of Rosé's voice at all, and in this I think it sounds particularly... rough. Yeah. Better luck next time, girls!

---


# BUT I DON'T CARE, I'LL DO IT OVER AND OVER!!!

**pig-serpent** (11): A great blend of their over the top EDM production and high femme pop sensibilities. The bouncy big room house synths work wonders behind the chorus and I'm amazed more songs don't combine styles like this.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): first time i listened to this i got goosebumps. still feel the same way. easily in blackpink's top 3 songs and the "born to be alone" feels very fitting for the lives they lead.

**-chilazon-** (10): No words. Blackpink at their absolute best aaahhhhhh

**2l82bstr8** (10): this is their rebel yell

**agentofscranton** (10): just when I thought I was done with the blackstink girls they drag me back with this

**Alumineous** (10): Hmm, they definitely struck gold when they found Lisa. Her timbre is just so captivating. Anyway, this got me nostalgic for a high school love I didn't even have lol

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is my 11

**becca** (10): SARANGHAE SLIPPIN AND FALLING.  SARANGHAE KILLING UR DARLINGGGGGGG

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I can’t relate to this at all because I love being alone but it’s still a slay.

**celladonn** (10): Finally... a BLACKPINK song that is actually good instead of post-good...

**ChickyDipper** (10): it's up there with As If It's Your Last for their best title track, so good.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i have like 200 plays on this song i cant give it a lower score

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (10): Pop perfection tbh

**frogaranaman** (10): okay now where was this three songs ago

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): you bet your ASS I pump this while I’m riding my bike throughout the city aimlessly sad

**Gonza\_90** (10): This song goes SO hard

**hunnybee12** (10): perfect places but good. lorde wishes she could write lyrics with as much emotional impact as jennie. "no doctor can help when i'm lovesick" 💔😞

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): I feel like this song could be the intro of a Disney channel show. It’s actually such a cute song I really like it

**metanoira** (10): this is sooo new romantics energy blackpink pls stop w the beat drops

**mimins** (10): the summer song trend I WISH we got! The last chorus is fantastic and gives the best 'late summer just finished hanging out with friends and am now looking out the taxi imagining myself in a music video' vibes

**rubbie** (10): superb song

**thegirlin512** (10): I was so tempted to give this my eleven. It's a nice change of pace for the album when compared to the previous singles. Kind of like a mix of Kill This Love and Stay if that makes sense?

**throwaway-7650** (10): the one #good thing david guetta did in 2020

**welcome2thejam** (10): Finally, a drop with some actual weight and power behind it, and a chorus worth screaming out behind the wheel on a nighttime road

**thedoctordances1940** (9.7): idc i absolutely love this

**akanewasright** (9.5): Blackpink is good when they sing competently made songs

**Cooler\_lin** (9.5): this outro is so damn good

**ke1per** (9.5): the early to mid 2000s click-clack-pop in the chorus is *chef's kiss* and the final chorus extension is beautiful

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): huge bop!

**Tazzachar** (9.5): A “fun” song for BLACKPINK, it deviates a lot from their more hardened and edgy concept of this era, and I just enjoy this concept more

**yatcho** (9.5): Easily their best song for me, im glad they finally sang through a chorus with no crunchy beat drops

**Zypker125** (9.5): Proof that Teddy can still make awesome tracks, this one follows more of the As If It's Your Last vocal-chorus template, which is an A+ formula for me.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): it's literally a kesha song

**-mczrv-** (9): loved it

**1998tweety** (9): we love their redemption

**AxymHeart** (9): Wasn't sure about this song at first, but once it clicked, I loved it.

**brpr425** (9): A really fun song and a refreshing change of pace! Definitely liked this and Pretty Savage the most off their album.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9): literally their best title track behind whistle yup yup

**chancehugs** (9): The chorus is cathartic AF and the Lisa-Jennie rap makes me feel like a bad bitch. If Jisoo was allowed to belt a high note in the bridge this song would've been a 10.

**cuttackone** (9): one of their best

**hikkaru** (9): basic as hell but it does bop i fear

**ignitethephoenix** (9): it’s definitely one of their best songs

**ivyleaf33** (9): perfect for lipsyncing along to alone in your room. obsessed with the rap part.

**JohnnyToby** (9): first time I heard it I had bass boost on and dear gawd I was so lovesick

**JsaKim** (9): Reminds me of 2009 and 2010 pop songs

**KoolFunk** (9): finally something different, thank god, no offense to Teddy, he's a great producer

**lady\_sable** (9): rose I would die for you

**rotating3Dtext** (9): no love letters, no xs and os, no love never my exes know, no diamond ring that’s set in stone, to the left better left alone!! didn’t wanna be a princess, i’m priceless, a prince not even on my list, love is a drug that i quit, no doctor could help when i’m love sick!!

**sabooyah** (9): While this isn't as good as Katy Perry's 'Teenage Dream', it makes me feel the same way I felt a decade ago listening to Teenage Dream in high school. Those vibes and the tone are unmatched and hard to replicate, love and respect this song it is so underrated especially the ending!!

**terrencelovescum** (9): this is actually fun! nostalgic of the early 2010s pop music scene without sounding dated.

**thGnerd** (9): Not a big BP fan but this song was fantastic

**vayyiqra** (9): I think this is the one (1) BP song everyone agrees is good. The hook is amazing. I just wish the song didn't end abruptly.

**SkylarV** (8.6): Far and away their best song, imagine if their discography were more like this song...

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): can blackpink get back into the studio soon and do something like this again

**TiltControls** (8.5): There's still something missing, but this is still a really good track

**anagalisgv** (8): bringing back the 2010s when we've barely left them is a bold move but it's cute

**BasedButta** (8): good

=====

ggsmackdown: **bluetriangles04** (8): This was definitely an interesting choice for a comeback post HYLT, but with the guitar in the background and the background vocal callbacks, its very reminiscent of older YG groups, 2NE1 and BIGBANG (Missing You + Let's Not Fall In Love specifically) My enjoyment of this song though is particularly disrupted by the mixing of the instrumental during the chorus.

**ggal2020** (8): blackpink’s best song?

**jasannn** (8): I really tried to stockholm this song since it was their “best” song in a while but I still ended up dropping it.

**notarobot3675** (8): reminds me a bit of "as if its your last" which is my fave song by them, it gets extra points again for veering away a little bit from their standard formula

**PSSST12** (8): I know blinks often raves about this song and everything but its pretty whelming for me.

**RaphaelArthur** (8): not impressive but still great

**rikarikachan** (8): I gotta give them this one, it's good.

**vaguelycatshaped** (8): Their best song imo unless you count On The Ground

**BooksAndWhisky** (7.5): She’s catchy, energetic, and a welcome return to Blackpink’s Pink side

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): Not going to lie, I was quite surprised by how much love this song gets even from those who don’t identify themselves as Blinks. Lovesick Girls feels like a refreshing track for Blackpink as there are no previous songs that capture this feeling of nostalgia from them. Ironically, the nostalgic feeling also makes this song feel a bit outdated in the sense that this screams 2015. The progression of the song is what makes me listen to this song in full. Overall, Lovesick Girls is a nice song in their discography, but if if I were to introduce to my non K-pop friends to Blackpink, I would not pick Lovesick Girls as the first song for them to listen to.

**en#8502** (7.5): stop crying rosé

**milkywayinradius** (7.5): to be honest, i would be eating this up if it were by 2ne1

**savemeaseat143** (7.5): it's fun at first but it just becomes more basic after a few listens.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I swear I heard this exact song in a forever21 in like 2015/2016

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): a bit dated but it reminds me of the early 2010s so I like it

**ebooks#5454** (7): club anthem for depressed bitches like myself

**huntyphobic** (7): Listenable, boppy, flows well (except the rap being shoved in there)

**MToms** (7): worst part is the chorus

**rslashpoopheads** (7): A bop!

**SatC1** (7): such an improvement but can we go back to playing with fire

**skargardin** (7): It's cute

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): More of this please, Teddy


# No love letters, no 11s or 10s 

**billie\_\_** (6.5): nostalgia for my kesha blackout drinking era and a real chorus make this my fave bp title track

**DefaultPophead** (6.5): Almost a really good song. Almost.

**intheaftermath** (6.5): I will defend that Pretty Savage should've been a single as much as Swifties will defend Cruel Summer. It's nice but less exhilarating than better Blackpink material

**seanderlust** (6.3): i'll take it

**bookthieving** (6): imo the girls' voices (especially rosé's) just fit this sound better than their usual girl crush bangers

**DaBigBoi** (6): I used to rlly like this! The fact that the chorus was sung and had a nice pop chorus was a pleasant change. But for some reason the production has really fallen off for me. It feels hollow. Maybe some more substantial synths or percussion could help.

**MimisChoice9763** (6): it's not really my taste but I like the end portion

**prada** (5.5): not this early 2ne1 reject

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): its fine i guess. i liked the rap verse

**anarkyah** (5): The only song of their I truly didn’t dislike since the first listen and I realized it’s because they broke from their usual formula, which kudos to them. It almost feels nostalgic to a type of 2013-15 music so there’s that in it’s favor!

**apatel27** (5): Why do they sounds so distant from the mic during the chorus

**bespectacIed** (5): Their title track being the third single released dampened the hype a bit. And it's such a generically 2012 EDM song. No bueno

**fadedblue09** (5): really underwhelming than I remembered

**flavasavavandal** (5): Oh, by the way, which one’s Blackpink

**GREY** (5): roséiana grande your essence, charisma, unique vocals, and overall slayery is unmatched. I wish i could fly to korea and be your personal foot stool. Anything for you my queen my entire world my rock my lifeline my love my hope and my happiness.

**LesApfels** (5): I guess I like the guitar?

**nctdreamsqd** (5): I like the instrumental and the vibe of the song.

**runaway3212** (5): naur

**Stryxen** (5): i just cant even bring myself to dislike it omfg what is wrong with me

**whoisValensi** (5): You know what. This is Meh as HELL. I've tried to form an opinion on it for what a year? two years? now and I got nothing. I mean I guess I'm glad they decided to branch out and try new things but like... maybe don't do this again. ALSO HOW DARE ROSÉ FUCKING SMASH AN EPIPHONE GUITAR IN THE MUSIC VIDEO!!!!! THAT IS HOMOPHOBIA IDC!!!!!

**LilacDaffodils** (4.5): not a bad song just not my style in general

**2dina3dworld** (4): I love abcdefu

**bigbigbee** (4): I understand why people would like this but for me it is just competent

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): teddy said let me remake Heroine but boring

**ImADudeDuh** (4): I feel bad cause I thought this was good but relistening im just whelmed

**bulforster** (3.2): this is so boringly competent, disappointing.

**DaHumanTorch** (2.5): and i'm sick of this fucking song

**sublimeMusic** (2): I find this song immature in a way that makes me feel old

**sage** (1): literally one of the worst kpop songs ive ever heard everything about this is SO bad. bp having a total of like 3 good songs is so funny

**majid** (0): one of the worst songs i've ever heard.

**plastichaxan** (0): i naured

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.500): Immediately losing 3 songs then having their 4th song unceremoniously go out in day 2…I’m afraid this is the definition of a poor showing. Tbh y’all kinda did them dirty akdsfkjds. I have a complicated relationship with BLACKPINK, I think a few of their songs do actually slap but I feel like they’re not…actually good songs? And then the songs I don’t like, I’m just kinda meh on them. The Album was a big disappointment but that’s on me for expecting BLACKPINK/Teddy to try something new and exciting. Also Jennie if you read this I’m free on Thursday night and would like to hang out, please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I am free

**wavingwolves** (4.375): A lot of people had a lot to say about BLACKPINK, so I won't bore anyone with my own takes that have already been said by someone else and in a much more eloquent way. I'll say instead that their performance in this rate was a surprise to me. I mean, none of the hosts really considered them to really have a frontrunner song, but to catch full bottom 3 plus to go out so early on compared to other groups while still being by most metrics the most known k-pop girl group? Yeah... I guess their success isn't up to par with how their music is received by music fans.

**thegirlin512** (10.000): My favorites. 4D is the reason I like kpop. There isn't a single member whose voices I don't enjoy. Yes, my ratings here will be high, but I listen to most of these songs like once a week so is anybody surprised?

**Round\_Log401** (9.500): So cliché of me but even after exploring a lot of kpop BP remain my fave. Don't know how else to phrase it, I simply love bad bxtches.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.000): this list has more songs than Black Pink’s entire discography… but I wish blinks a very nice comeback someday soon

**AxymHeart** (9.000): I'm a Blink but I'll be objective

**dekubaku** (9.000): Great aesthetics with a very strong sound. Loved The Album (despite this awful name) None of their recent releases is as strong as Ddu Ddu Ddu but they remain great releases nevertheless.

**runaway3212** (8.750): I think that Blackpink is so popular they sometimes get undeserved hate. They are not the only thing kpop has to offer, nor the best thing. However they are by far the most popular kpop group outside of Korea. All that said, I fucking love blackpink so much, the absolute iconicness of them doing the least and still breaking records it's so fucking funny.

**bespectacIed** (8.500): no matter how subpar and infrequent their music is, they will always be my girls, sorry. No one in kpop has more jenny say kwan, charisma, and gravitational pull than these 4, they will always be the IT girls.

**-chilazon-** (8.375): Hope they have a comeback soon :(

**vayyiqra** (8.250): Blackpink are way overhated. They make cheesy and often cringey music and hardly ever release new material, but have you thought that they are ... post-good? No jk I know they're kind of trash but it's like ... they're my trash. They make enough bangers to keep me interested.

**pig-serpent** (8.250): Basically the reason I'm kinda into kpop. Their crossover hits are really good and a lot of their songs are 80% of the way to hyperpop, which is just the best pop subgenre. I don't think this is their strongest showing of songs, but it's still a solid bunch for me to root for.

**Alumineous** (8.000): They have the special sauce.

**whoisValensi** (7.750): Love 'em or hate 'em you can't deny BLACKPINK are the moment. While I'm not the biggest fan of how we seem to barely get songs from them (I mean they've been around for how long now... and we only have how many songs...), I do pretty much consistently like their output. While I do now find 'THE ALBUM' a bit mid on further review, I do appreciate the fact they tried to switch it up from the formula of rehashing 'DDU-DU DDU-DU' 50x times, it feels kinda boring at times. They've almost accidentally carved themselves a niche of being "bad bitches" and when they don't do that it feels a bit off, if you get what I mean.

**slimboyfriend** (7.000): Omg I used to listen to 2NE1 in high school; I didn't know they were still around!

**throwaway-7650** (7.000): in another timeline I'd be Ice Cream: 1 and/or LSG my 11

**ke1per** (6.875): catchy but it feels like they struggle to find a place to ...end?

**brpr425** (6.750): Love the girls, but a lot of their newer songs are growing old for me.

**BooksAndWhisky** (6.575): BP's music is 70% their attitude and 30% actual music but that 70% is very very hard to replicate

**ivyleaf33** (6.500): theoretically i shouldn't like most of their music but yg production quality always hits just right for my ears

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6.375): As a Blink, it’s not going to be nice seeing how the group might not survive in Day 3 welp. Regardless, I am grateful that Blackpink was my gateway into getting into K-pop so they have a special place in my heart. (BLACKPINK Bias: Rosé)

**welcome2thejam** (6.250): Apologies to my Blackpink-stanning cousin. Would need to listen to more, but based on these songs, I forsee a Black Eyed Peas type trajectory of their tendencies being too much of an obstacle personally. However, they are very capable of putting out an occasional golden track that'll keep me paying attention, so there's still hope!

**mssone1993** (6.125): I usually do not like BLACKPINK's songs at my first listen but slowly I always started to appreciate the songs possibly due to heavy promotion and good choreography.

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (6.000): I wish their Coachella live performance had an available album or Ep to stream

**notahedgehog666** (5.925): Would have preferred to see Pretty Savage in their song choices

**OliviaGodrigo** (5.750): 1

**akanewasright** (5.625): You know what, at least they’re never boring

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.500): everything blackpink has ever released is either bad or ironically good

**fadedblue09** (4.750): I hope there's a parallel universe out there where PLaying With Fire is their biggest hit instead of this timeline where we’re stuck with these Dddu/AAIYL clones

**hikkaru** (4.750): they're so hit or miss it's ridiculous

**reiichitanaka** (4.750): They’re definitely charismatic and engaging performers, too bad YGE is wasting their talent by giving them the bare minimum of lackluster music

**pornypete** (4.750): I do love certain BP songs. AIIYL, Forever Young, and especially You Never Know. But I'm not too hot on any of the selected.

**pieisawesome123** (4.500): I think I just don't enjoy BP songs that much, don't quite vibe with them, so, sorry for the low scores here

**rikarikachan** (4.375): Ugh, Blackpink. I swear I've given them so many chances to be better than they are, and I've never been anything but kind of unimpressed.

**TiltControls** (4.250): there are some decent-good parts in all of these, but it feels like it's all just a little too much at times.

**rslashpoopheads** (4.250): I loved BlackPink at debut but their songs went way downhill once they ran out of old 2NE1 demos.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4.000): Honestly Blackpink is so hilarious. It’s like their label tried so hard to make a memeable bad bitch group but totally forgot to actually invest in good music. Their singles all sound the same, their lyrics are incredibly bad and cringy (especially confounding since a lot of them were written by NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS), and even their solo works have ranged from lackluster to a complete disaster (unless you’re Jisoo, who has yet to have solo music but STILL managed to stumble into a nationwide controversy somehow). I honestly love them. No other music act has kept me so thoroughly entertained with their antics. Whenever I see the name “Blackpink” in the news or in new music, I always know that something absolutely insane is about to happen.

**donutseer** (3.750): definition of modern pop mediocrity.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.625): still not entirely sure if i actually listened to four different songs or just one song played four times

**ebooks#5454** (3.250): this group makes me hate women

**duckson89** (3.000): We're tired of their formulaic production and horrible rap lyrics (SORRY LISA).

**bulforster** (3.000): post-good indeed

**apatel27** (3.000): 2NE1 died for this... At least bring the edge and uniqueness they had but I guess it did prove the execs right that people only care about looks.

**SkylarV** (2.650): Their style really doesn't mesh with me, but LSG... I can fuck with that

**moonagenightmares** (2.375): dont attack me for these scores take it up with teddy

=====

ggsmackdown: **flavasavavandal** (1.750): I feel like at this point I have to ask the question, why are they so big? I mean they barely release music, and when they do it isn’t good. 3 out of the 4 songs are obnoxious without the colour, bombast, presence, personality or charisma to back it up, but even if they did, I think most of these songs would just barely become passable. They just sound like wet farts.  I even went back to listen to some of their other songs and they are just so much better (well maybe not Whistle). I’m just starting to wonder if Blackpink are just some elaborate ruse for music video directors to flex their creativity (and even then the mvs could be better

**anarkyah** (1.750): I already have a bias against them which I admit but I went with in with an open mind! Still, it just seemed to solidify what I already thought but I hope my comments are enough to justify these scores

**wavingwolves** (4.5): Ah, this is a very memorable moment. Back in 2019, after some investigation, police found proof of voting manipulation from the producers of MNET survival shows [Produce 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produce_101) (which formed the groups I.O.I, Wanna One, IZ\*ONE and X1) and [Idol School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idol_School_(2017_TV_series) (which formed fromis_9) and it became a [major scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnet_vote_manipulation_investigation), with the producers involved being fined and sentenced to prison for fraud. It was proven group line-ups were manipulated with some trainees being pushed completely out of the final groups while others made the cut instead. While all of this was happening, IZ\*ONE, who was one of the most successful active k-pop groups at the time, was about to release their first full album in November of 2019, but with the amount blacklash from the public against the proven fraud it was pushed back. Their future looked uncertain, a lot of people deemed them not worth of their careers, they went into discussions about their future as a group. In the following January it was agreed they would continue and in February their first full album was released with FIESTA as the title. Guess what? It became a hit.  The album broke records, topped charts, became Platinum and was overall a big success, both domestically and overseas. IZ\*ONE proved they were too big for the scandal to actual take a shake them. But, well... does that mean I like the song at all? No, I just find the context much more interesting than the song itself. The M/V for this surely is gorgeous, but I wish the song was half as pretty. I actually used to really hate this song because I think the chorus is pure noise, and even if I like my fair share of noise in my music this doesn't make the cut. The drop is just so ugly sounding that even if I like the verses and pre-chorus quite bit I'm just not able to get behind it. But yeah, like every other song in this rate, this grew on me. I can manage to stand it in a good day.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): Don't really feel anything about this. The horns and vocals are kinda terrible but I'm just so whatever about this song I couldn’t even be bothered to tank it. Great choreography though!

**becca** (10): WE LOVE YOU SLAYZONE

**bespectacIed** (10): LVER but amped up tenfold what's not to love. it's our fiesta

**GREY** (10): the pussy part of 2020

**Jhe116** (10): I feel like the result would not do this song justice but this is truly their magnum opus

**JohnnyToby** (10): chaewon really ate this era up like maybe it's ok she was rigged in

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): the choreography is impeccable. Gp999 made it my favorite song

**poemforsmallthings** (10): IZONE were at their lowest... barely survived Produce 48 rigging scandal, disappeared off the face of the Earth for months, almost disbanded early... They came on this bitch mad as hell

**PSSST12** (10): the choreo in this one. . A collapse I fear

**sage** (10): omfg this fucking smash the drop is kinda the worst thing ive ever heard it eats so bad

**BasedButta** (9.5): girl that starts the second chorus has a sick voice i love it

**anothertown** (9): The political compass of music has this on the lib-right corner and alice gas on lib-left

**chancehugs** (9): The wait for this comeback was gruelling thanks to the whole Produce 101 controversy but it did not disappoint (well, maybe Hyewon's lack of lines did). Glad to see the J-line getting respect here.

**ChickyDipper** (9): Chaewon, Eunbi, Yuri and Yena on this song... perfecto 💋

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (9): Amazing

**intheaftermath** (9): I'm not familiar with this group but whoever sings the Fiesta line in the chorus has such a sweet voice. She's so talented and the delivery of the chorus really elevated this one for me

**lalafairy18** (9): This song never fails to put me in a great mood

**notallslendermen** (9): My personal favorite song of theirs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the hyperpopification of iz*one

**thegirlin512** (9): You can hear that the producers have figured out everything a bit better in this song compared with their debut. I'm in love with the instrumental too, btw.

**Victerade** (8.7): A BANGER! WILL ALWAYS BE A BANGER!

**anagalisgv** (8.5): imo the purest encapsulation of the IZ*ONE Sound

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): These girls might have the best energy in the rate. I really want them to do well.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): that *plucking* in the chorus, got me going real good

**2l82bstr8** (8): if you don't have any propensity to headaches it's actually really fun

**Awkward\_King** (8): why did the crazy kazoo horns have to come in

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): this is so grating (complimentary)

**en#8502** (8): me when i go to the circus https://www.reddit.com/r/kpophelp/comments/jt0lfw/what_song_is_this/

**RaphaelArthur** (8): great song with strong identity but sounds a bit messy at some parts

**terrencelovescum** (8): wait i think i hear something! kinda loving this song and the cover is cute too.

**xedophobic** (8): chaewon my beloved

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I was really feeling this until that… clown horn drop? It just never got the momentum back after that.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Huge sounding Future Bass EDM POG.

**whoisValensi** (7.5): I can't believe I like... accidentally avoid IZ*ONE during their entire run... cause fuck this is some good stuff.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): surprisingly, the song called fiesta is NOT an ethnic hip moment

**CrimsonROSET** (7): *points to panorama* they’re the same picture

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): the pre-chorus is everything

**prada** (7): bop but these vocals are INSUFFERABLE.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Need that infernal squeaking to stop cause it's keeping it from a 10

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): somehow i don't hate the drop?

**akanewasright** (6.5): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851835432886599761/939978726899347488/Screen_Shot_2022-02-06_at_3.19.06_PM.png https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851835432886599761/939978727109034014/Screen_Shot_2022-02-06_at_3.19.26_PM.png

**jasannn** (6.5): a little too much going on even for me

**runaway3212** (6.5): yaa

**rikarikachan** (6.3): I feel like I liked this one better in 2019

**cherryices** (6): actually there is something about this instrumental that gives undertale OST

**ke1per** (5.5): weird, not super-pleasing transition from bridge to the final chorus stalls it for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I do not enjoy whatever those demented trumpet sounding things on the chorus are.

**Cooler\_lin** (5): love a good intro, post rap second verse is a nice section but some of the girls genuinely sound like children im sorry

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (5): I was wondering how quality the Spanish lyrics were going to be just for it to be one word lol

**mimins** (5): I could've liked it if it was not so high and processed

**rotating3Dtext** (5): more like siesta

**sabooyah** (5): The chorus is super messy.

**superr\_rad** (5): i dont really get this song :l its not catchy enough to justify those chorus sounds

**Zypker125** (4.9): I still can't stand Hitomi's/Nako's/Sakura's/Hyewon's/Wonyoung's vocals, I find them either too nasally, squeaky, overly high-pitched, and/or weak-sounding, and they legitimately bring down all of IZ\*ONE's songs for me. Nothing against them as people, but in terms of their vocals I can never enjoy them.

**moonagenightmares** (4.7): god i hate production like this in kpop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4.5): not a fan of the vocals

**-chilazon-** (4): It's so high-pitched it hurts my ears. And whatever that shrill instrumental sound is in the second part of the chorus, it's all just too much for me. Way too many sounds going on. Got a bit of a nice hook, but that's the only saving grace.

**celladonn** (4): This is kind of inoffensive and unremarkable yet annoying

**ebooks#5454** (4): they should've sang in spanish

**Round\_Log401** (4): Sorry for repeating myself but so much sound mashed together. The mv is pretty but so much colour, pattern, every corner is packed with stuff. Honestly the choreo is impressive but even there, so much going on. Sensory overload.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Violeta and this are too noisy.

**plastichaxan** (2.5): we got latina representation but at what cost

**cuttackone** (2): this one is even worse

**fadedblue09** (2): Why does this sound like Got7 - Lullaby  thrown in some blender or whatever

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): A Girl Like Me is better but this ~~is Rickiyola~~ is also a massive banger! Gugudan were truly done so dirty in their careers, they released so many bangers but got paid dust each time.

**wavingwolves** (10): I was already typing out how this was yet one more cunty disbandment song in the rate but I just remembered that they actually went on to release one more song and it ended up being the worst song of their career. Well, in any case, this is a pussy popper and the right way to do a "a girls are wearing black now!" concept. I'm not the biggest fan of whistling in songs, but it does work here and I think the chorus vocal harmonies are some of the best in the rate, if not the best. They were so incredibly underrated, even if all they did was serve slay after slay and then they DIED. They also had some of the [worst line distribution](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/784125484166152232/944459842481967114/unknown.png) ever and even before the existence of Everglow.

# #TeamSejeong

**2l82bstr8** (10): it's SUCH a cool song and it's so SUBTLE about it too. you can't go wrong with it

**akanewasright** (10): fuuuuuuuuck this is good

**bespectacIed** (10): SMASH. One of the best nugu songs ever. Talented brilliant never been heard before. What a sad path from "sejeong and mina and friends" to "sejeong + backup dancers" to nugudan to finally gugudone :/ Fly high angles

**ChickyDipper** (10): in another universe this was their huge breakout song because it's so good

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i need to make the joke...this slayed the house down BOOTS omfg 💋👠👠

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (10): So good rip my times tables girls

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): That chirpy synth playing the countermelody during the chorus is genius! Actually the composition of the chorus and the way all of the elements bounce around each other is just… chef’s kiss

**GREY** (10): This song is that last bit of your favorite food left on the plate. It's the pussy part of the music industry. It's that sweet and savory snack just waiting for you at home after a long day. It's the blunt you've been saving for the right moment

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): literally so good. A crime that it didn’t get the recognition it deserved

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): https://i.imgur.com/ZXMhC42.png

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): they served with this

**rslashpoopheads** (10): It's crazy that Sejeong and this song couldn't get them even a little bit of traction.

**sage** (10): KILLED THE BOOTS 💋👠💅

**seanderlust** (10): i'm such a sucker for a new jack swing beat in a kpop song

**whoisValensi** (10): Funfact this song is very easy to loop. Source: Well... *let's just say out of the 85 gugudan plays I have 79 of those are this song.*

**Jhe116** (9.5): This is excellent. Jellyfish did the girls so dirty like they had this and A Girl Like Me was a minor hit too like what were you thinking

**savemeaseat143** (9.5): it's very pleasing to my ears

**throwaway-7650** (9.2): hit the #SLAY button (击杀按钮!) and kill the boots

**1998tweety** (9): mature sex serve

**agentofscranton** (9): sejeong feat. gugudan

**Awkward\_King** (9): whos whistling please stop or at least calm down a little thank you maam

**ggal2020** (9): nugudan I will fight for you!

**hikkaru** (9): down house

**huntyphobic** (9): JUSTICE FOR NUGUDAN

**ignitethephoenix** (9): really loving this, Kesha and all those country girls who did these boots are made for walkin

**ivyleaf33** (9): somehow i completely forgot about how good this song and concept was

**Nixon4Prez** (9): Worst line distribution in history but still a great song.

**RaphaelArthur** (9): amazing vocals, really great song

**Victerade** (9): BANGER! jellyfish will burn in hell forever for how they managed them

**Stryxen** (8.9): 👠👠👠👠👠👠

**babadork** (8.7): This is my favorite of the songs that I was completely unfamiliar with before the rate. “Not That Type” is a bop, too.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.7): this bridge is the moment

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): um yes queen skinny legend versace boots the house down slay queen hunty mama and oop daddy work gugudan snatch my wig

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8.5): hypnotizing sound and moves also plus pts for cowboyish hat

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): hell ya, what a groove

**superr\_rad** (8.5): this group deserved so much more!!!

**bulforster** (8.2): slay

**anothertown** (8): dora the explorer's monkey friend serving

**becca** (8): again another cute song i had never heard before!

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8): okay this one slayed

**chancehugs** (8): I like this song. I also like Sejeong. However I would've loved if she didn't sing half the song and the other members had more things to do. Mina was in IOI too ffs.

**DefaultPophead** (8): I appreciate this song. Makes me want to slip on my high-heeled boots that I don't own!

**mimins** (8): I like it a lot!

**poemforsmallthings** (8): They had the saddest career of all post IOI groups even when Pristin and DIA were right there

**PSSST12** (8): Justice for GUGUDAN 😭😭 but not that type outsold tbh.

**thGnerd** (8): I absolutely adore Gugudan's tracks

**welcome2thejam** (8): The Boots is made for dancing and that's just what I'll do

**billie\_\_** (7.5): gugudan were my fave of the post-produce groups but i still took off a point because the acapella teaser they did for this song was just so beautiful that when the song actually came out i was a little disappointed.

**Cooler\_lin** (7.5): a fun track! miss sejeong on this, a vocalist! great outro

**en#8502** (7.5): great track from Sejeong and the Scene

**DaBigBoi** (7): JELLYFISH IS THE WORST ENTERTAINMENT IN THE KPOP INDUSTRY. NUGUDAN DESERVED BETTER! NUGUDAN WILL REMAIN IN OUR HEARTS <3 - nccv3

**runaway3212** (7): yasss

**sabooyah** (7): Obsessed with Kim Sejeong's voice til this day.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): it kinda reminds me of a fifth harmony song at points but like. a good one

**thegirlin512** (7): I like the whistling in the background and the song itself is fun.

**TiltControls** (7): I know it had no reason to be included over this but Wonderland would be an easy 11

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Generic but in a not bad way

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): shes cute ig

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): That whistling is really bringing this song for me.

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): girl….. The boots

**jasannn** (6.5): As the only song in the rate I wasn’t familiar with, I am… whelmed.

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Do people normally whistle at your boots?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.3): this was MUCH more enjoyable than the last two songs

**Zypker125** (6.2): Gugudan's weakest title track. A Girl Like Me though? Flames. Wonderland? An absolute banger of a debut, fuck the haters of Wonderland, it was an amazing song to debut with.

**-mczrv-** (6): gugudan is a pretty sick name ngl

**ImADudeDuh** (6): House Down

# #TeamSomi

**JohnnyToby** (6): too bad Sejeong's own group never released an impactful song

**nosnoop** (6): Even though I am a fan of Sejeong, this song is really not very memorable.

**Round\_Log401** (6): Catchy chorus, not fully my taste but good.

**rubbie** (6): Nice, but I feel like there are dozens of similar nugu-ish kpop tunes out there every other day.

**cloudbustingmp3** (5.8): chococo outsold

**ebooks#5454** (5): puss in boots where

**ke1per** (5): unremarkable

**apatel27** (4): That whistle sounds familiar

**BooksAndWhisky** (4): Why is this so monotonous where is the ENERGY why does this song never head anywhere

**cuttackone** (3): nah im sorry its just kinda mediocre

**sublimeMusic** (2): I routinely forget nugudan ever existed

**CaptainDaisyG** (1): I hate this because it could've been so good, but they missed the mark badly.

**terrencelovescum** (1): can't stand whistles in songs anymore.

DilemmaOfAHedgehog: I wasn’t expecting my average for Blackpink to be a six but I also hate ice cream and I care more about lyricism for rates then for streaming and I think Lisa’s English raps are all incredibly badly written that coast on her charisma and Jennie’s aren’t that good either

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Take me back to when this was released and people would spam this on Twitter and be like "omg y'all have to check this new Weki Meki song out, it's so good!!". Weki Meki also have so many bangers, I'm glad they're still fighting to stay afloat as a group.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): Ahhh, [married](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdYbtDdXgAE80qs.jpg) queens Doyeon and Yoojung got the top spot for the Post I.O.I section, which ended up not even being that high! This actually is deeply upsetting but whatever! I'll count as win for the sapphics because someone has to see the silver lining of it. It's probably no coincidence the group that managed to get the highest compared to the others of that section is also the one group that's still active, right? Well, in any case, congratulations because they do deserve to keep going to release more slays like [Who Am I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XW1vPb6rI8).

---

# Not picky at all, just appreciators of good music 

**Islands** (11): can’t relate to the lyrics sorry Doyeon

**SkylarV** (11): Wasn't sure if I was going to use my 11 or not, but I can't not give it to this, it's a truly perfect song is every sense

**2dina3dworld** (10): me when I’m at a restaurant be like “I’m so picky picky picky”

**agentofscranton** (10): as one of five ki-lings in existence I can't in good conscience give this a sub 10 score

**AssailantArcturus** (10): that scream in the middle of the song is the best part

**bespectacIed** (10): COOL deserved but this is indeed their most iconic. i love the weme girls so much and i wish them all the best. Stream Metronome aka their best tune

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): Everyone wanna be picked by her

**chancehugs** (10): As Rebecca Black would say, "Oh, my god, I love this song. This is my jaaaam!"

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): When you’re this good you deserve to be picky!

**GREY** (10): psa for those frauds over at ichillin headquarters: you can take a masterpiece and try to recreate it but you will never be better than the original. You cant put on the weki meki hat and pretend to be weki meki it just doesnt work that way

**Jhe116** (10): Teen crush quintessence, imagine how life would be had Fantagio debuted them with Crush followed by this

**JohnnyToby** (10): this should've been their debut

**metanoira** (10): can we have an ioi reboot to make doyeon famous again pls

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is hyperpop

**Round\_Log401** (10): UNDERRATED, song & group.

**sage** (10): i love gotya by ichillin

**SatC1** (10): can't believe they lasted the longest. love them so much

**terrencelovescum** (10): they went to the farrah abraham school of auto tune and passed with flying colors. really need to see them in a studio with SOPHIE and ag cook.

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream IDLYG, metronome, tiki taka, and #COOL!

**anagalisgv** (9.5): I love this sassy concept I wish they would lean into it even more

**whoisValensi** (9.5): Weki Meki is a very fun group name to say. At least their name matches their sound too cause they're a pretty fun group. I too tho am Picky Picky as proven by my scores lol.

**brpr425** (9): When this song first started, I thought it was going to bad but I was so wrong

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (9): they became a school rock band

**fadedblue09** (9): There's a reason why they're the only post-IOI group who made it this far (besides WJSN that is)

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (9): A Bopper for the girls something light and cute

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9): post-I.O.I groups deserved better to be honest

**Nixon4Prez** (9): Weki Meki deserves better

**thGnerd** (9): Weki Meki's hits REALLY hit

**vayyiqra** (9): I got into Weki Meki kind of a bit because Thejas liked them and no one else did but they unironically are good and I like this one a lot

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): infectious chorus. underrated group, imo

**en#8502** (8.5): pick me pick me pick me up

**-mczrv-** (8): Weki Meki has bops!!

**1998tweety** (8): a cute bratty bop, they have better songs like Cool and Crush though.

**BasedButta** (8): love these girls but omg their instrument miming at the end is so fucking funny also the song is good basic fresh pop very welcomed

**Cooler\_lin** (8): the way this was originally a 6 and then moved up because i kept listening to it after the fact..it's too catchy and fun like..a banger truly

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8): cute and funny

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Why was this so good??

**milkywayinradius** (8): good song to end the rate playlist bc my scores reflect that I'M SO PICKY PICKY PICKY

**rslashpoopheads** (8): This song is so iconic.

**rubbie** (8): Love this mess, probably would've liked it even more a few years ago

**toyletpauper** (8): I'm so picky, picky, picky.

**Victerade** (8): forgot how it sounded like but i remember liking it too lazy to relisten

**savemeaseat143** (7.9): so true Weki Meki I am so picky

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I don’t think this is like THAT good but I really like it, while acknowledging that I’m horribly biased because I am a huge stannie for Choi Yoojung and Kim Doyeon

**billie\_\_** (7.5): i feel like weki meki debuted with a concept that would only become really popular about 2 years later with itzy, etc, which is a shame. this song is a lot of fun.

**mengzhongmeng** (7.5): not their best (that would be oopsy) but it's a good song

**vaguelycatshaped** (7.5): Great discovery from this list

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): i’m so freaky freaky freakyyy

**Awkward\_King** (7): i think this one doesnt make sense its upsetting

**Bryoneehhh\_** (7): this used to be cute but now it’s kinda annoying

**bulforster** (7): me trying to give out fewer scores above 9 this rate

**CrimsonROSET** (7): me looking at my scores and finding nitpicks

**DefaultPophead** (7): I'm sad. I really wanted to like this. I guess I did, but I thought it would be really up there. I just HATE the squeaking throughout.

**ivyleaf33** (7): there are parts of this i absolutely adore, but the chorus fell a bit flat

**notallslendermen** (7): Really wish this had been their debut song, I think this would have been far more successful

**RaphaelArthur** (7): catchy and fun song but vocals could be better

**seanderlust** (7): #Hotplace #Daily #Selfie

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): charli xcx would slay on this beat i can tell

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’ve always appreciated how ahead of the curve K-pop is with incorporating hyperpop elements in their songs

**welcome2thejam** (7): Wasn't feeling it, then it goes off nicely in the final chorus

**ChickyDipper** (6.5): this is SABOTAGE! The Weki Meki members are already poor and starving yet here you rate pickers are choosing one of their worst songs to show possible new fans!! Oopsy, Cool and Siesta I am so sorry 💔😭

**Zypker125** (6.2): It's an actual crime that Weki Meki literally INVENTED the concept of teen crush (https://youtu.be/bCaMcVXIPEU?t=293), but it got fucking laughed off by everyone, and now it's by far the most popular GG concept and people think ITZY invented it for some reason. Unpopular opinion but Weki Meki's first three songs of I Don't Like Your Girlfriend, La La La, and Crush was one of the strongest debut trifectas of all time, it's a shame that people hated it and thus they reverted back to more standard pop music such as Picky picky.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the rate committee be like

**nt96** (6): Me doing the rates and figuring out my 11 (not this song)

ggsmackdown: # Now the actual picky ones


**PSSST12** (6): for the hype that thia song gets amongst kpop circle, its surprisingly a let down.

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is an experince and i want off

**TiltControls** (6): I'm not picky with my music but I'm not feeling this

**DaBigBoi** (5.8): I can’t speak on Fantagio because I love the ASTRO members, but FANTAGIO IS THE WORST ENTERTAINMENT IN THE KPOP INDUSTRY. DIA DESERVED BETTER! DIA WILL REMAIN IN OUR HEARTS <3 - nccv3

**babadork** (5.7): Even though I didn’t like this song, I ended up listening to their entire discography and really liking it.

**becca** (5): love weki meki but i can’t stand this song 99.9% of the time

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Yeah…I wouldn’t pick this one.

**huntyphobic** (5): Farrah Abraham ate that intro up.

**mimins** (5): pretty average

**poemforsmallthings** (5): I know I gave some of the most hated songs in the rate a higher score but at least How You Like That makes me feel something which never really happened with this song

**sabooyah** (5): This song is 100 percent average for me.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i feel picky rating these songs... at least this one is catcy

**ke1per** (4.5): don't love the opening + post chorus + outro

**akanewasright** (4): there’s a joke in here about me being a picky and not liking this song, but I cba this isn’t worth the energy

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): i am picky picky picky

**cuttackone** (4): not with the songs apparantly

**lalafairy18** (4): I REALLY really like the "i'm so picky picky picky" part, but everything else kind of feels like a drag to get through

**runaway3212** (4): naur

**2l82bstr8** (3.5): the opening lines are so cool and I wish they'd done something cool with it instead of making it into an assortment of shouts and catchphrases

**Flippantry** (3): Ending on a pretty weak note after a playlist of so many bangers, sad

**pig-serpent** (3): The bassline is the only part of this song I like, and I swear I recognize it from another song. Maybe Squarepusher or something? When's the IDM rate?

**thegirlin512** (3): Not very catchy, and it's forgettable. Chorus definitely falls flat.

**sublimeMusic** (1): I routinely wish I could forget weki meki existed so much wasted potential

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.600): This being the best section of the rate omg who said that

**wavingwolves** (8.840): My co-hosts and I watched Produce 101 Season 1 together last year. It was a rewatch for me, but it could very well be my first time watching, since my opinions were so different from the time it was airing. It was very a very enjoyable time and we are introduced to many wonderful girls who went on to make some really wonderful music. I was #TeamSejeong through and through and gugudan is still out of these groups the one that has my favourite discography, followed by Weki Meki. Looking back, it's weird to think about how big I.O.I was for the year they were together as a group, how influencial they were to the industry and how unfortunate most of theirs careers as groups ended up being. Somi continues to be the most successful of all of them, even after dodging debuting in ITZY, and Chung Ha was doing well for a while too, but they couldn't be included since we couldn't cover soloists here. I have said this about most groups out today, but I swear they deserved better here too.

**whoisValensi** (9.700): I feel like 1 song alone fails to really showcase just how much of a MOMENT I.O.I was. The first Produce group, the big one, the show everyone was watching (tho it took me til last year to do that lol). I could probably go on, but I feel like directing you to go check out their titles and all that should suffice. It's unfortunate really tho that many members have faced rocky Post-I.O.I careers (i.e. never really getting that same level of fame, getting fucked over multiple times over with debuts, etc. etc.), but I do hope they can look back at I.O.I with nothing but love because it really was a moment and they really got it ALL in that moment. Truth be told if nothing else I just hope everyone is happy with where they are at right now.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.200): nothing but respect to the first produce group

**throwaway-7650** (9.040): if I was an ioi-nator I would've been so bitter

**bigbigbee** (8.600): It’s a real pity (and this is no one’s fault) that these Produce groups largely fell through the cracks in prior K-pop rates, because I think that a lot of them have excellent music (DIA and WJSN especially). I’m so grateful to the hosts for including this section!

**Cooler\_lin** (7.700): even though the bag was fumbled so many times during their extremely short run, if things were better for them (and they had better tracks) they would be the closest thing kpop has gotten to having another snsd

**welcome2thejam** (7.600): Ended up liking most of the post IOI groups' songs more than the original

**runaway3212** (7.600): tbh none of these groups reached the high highs of IOI but they're overall still pretty good. Stream Kep1er

**Zypker125** (7.500): Pretty solid discographies tbh, Gugudan's disco is one of the best girl group discos, Pristin's is pretty good as well, I.O.I and Weki Meki were solid. DIA's is eh, but that's still an overall solid batting average.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.100): Free them. FREE THEM!!!

**bookthieving** (6.200): should've just snuck chungha in here so i can 11 gotta go

vivianlight: Picky Picky should have made it to Day3 💔

Anyway if you like good pop music with a quirky touch, check out their whole [I Am Me EP](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nFseFZDUY9k6UdlRL4xiXdIUNPeH6Z498) released last November. I basically fell in love with this group thanks to this EP and their singles which are perfect, especially Picky Picky, Crush and Tiki Taka.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): Another banger from WJSN! At this point, they really know their lane and stick to it. This is one of my favourite songs in the rate, they just do this sound so well.

**wavingwolves** (10): The definition of timeless, I swear. This song is perfect in every single way. I'm always a sucker for any kind of magical girl concept and they pull it off like no one else in the industry was able to. It also has the type of sound that became basically extinct post-2019 and I miss it SO dearly! We need it back! NOW!

# Weebs

**sage** (11): this is kinda one of the best produced kpop songs ever and its not even their best title track (la la love)

**useless-sheep** (11): i will admit that i first listened to this song because i saw a compilation of all the touchy parts in the choreo (which is amazing btw.) best song ever

**1998tweety** (10): literal pop perfection

**2l82bstr8** (10): a soft bop with beautiful vocal performances

**agentofscranton** (10): at least once a day i'll space out with nothing in the head except for 'butakhae'

**becca** (10): i love this song so much like genuinely.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): light academia is my SHIT

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): wait I’ve never listened to much WJSN before but they’re kinda serving omg, Cosmic Girls take me away~

**GREY** (10): dont get me started on how absolutely breathtaking this era was like hello? Dawoncé Knowles Carter is that you? The amount of cuntery extract that was injected directly into the vein of this mp3 file top tier slayery anthem is far too much. Beat after beat vocal slay after vocal slay oh its just timeless! Exy Thee Stallion we love yew! Idc if you have 1 and only 1 flow if sumn isnt broke dont fix it! and Yeoréum Dion my queen of queens where do i even start? I owe you my entire life and more. I would throw myself off the empire state building if you asked me to, i would devote my entire life to you if thats your wish, i would personally track down yormdays and commit heinous crimes that would end with me in a life sentence if thats what you wanted my Aphrodite my goddess my life support my everything. And last but not least Dayoung. Thee Dayoung that continues to amaze and impress in every aspect.. you can turn an absolutely awful dog shit song (Unnatural) and make it SOTY (Slay of the Year) like that takes some serious talent that many of the dolls in the industry just dont possess! Starship doesnt deserve you queens.

**jasannn** (10): anime opening slay

**notarobot3675** (10): iconic tbh

**runaway3212** (10): yasssssss

**throwaway-7650** (10): [11] so most of my comments for this rate are low-effort but let me use this comment to talk about SM,SY. as one of my top 10 most-scrobbled songs of all time (at #10 with 337 as of when I finish the ballot), it's no *secret* that I love this song. the chorus is just... perfect to me. I also love the prechorus with eunseo/yeoreum/luda and the bridge into the final chorus is just :despair: dayoung you are such a queen. missing OT13 💔

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.6): super classy

**RaphaelArthur** (9.5): sublime song, amazing vocals, excellent musicality and unique production, but something about it doesn't take off as it should

**brokebutter** (9.4): it only gets better with time

**akanewasright** (9): omg is this a codependency anthem??? [note: it is not]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This video makes me feel like I’m part of some particularly fabulous cult.

**ke1per** (9): a much better version of Secret

**Nixon4Prez** (9): Pure WJSN perfection

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Yup, this is the stuff.

**savemeaseat143** (9): this song has the qualities that keep me listening to kpop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): its just so ethereal

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.7): Killer chorus, hasn’t aged a day. Great way to mature your sound without resorting to derivative girl crush

**note\_2\_self** (8.6): Bonus for impeccable styling

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): apparently wjsn cant make a bad song

**en#8502** (8.5): the saviour complex is really strong in this one 🙏

**TiltControls** (8.5): I really love some of the softer vocal moments here

**Victerade** (8.5): stole from gfriend and slayed!

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): not blowing me away or anything but it really just is a bop

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8): it was a slay

**Cooler\_lin** (8): the intro made my jaw drop instrumental was fantastic and it had a beautiful outro. just wish it was more catchy but this song was a pleasant surprise

**ivyleaf33** (8): tthe mv is everything

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Cute and harmless. The short raps should've been cut, but the vocals were really angelic, so why not give it an eight? NVM just lowered it lol

**rikarikachan** (7.5): This ticks all the boxes but doesn't click with me?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.2): this song is really cool??

**-chilazon-** (7): it felt a bit overcrowded and I wasn't really feeling the chorus, but I kind of like it in a chill way

**chancehugs** (7): I thought it was just OK.

**whoisValensi** (7): Also very nice. I think my overall opinion rn of WJSN is "very nice music."

**2dina3dworld** (6.9): I promise I did not score it this way just to have the funny number

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): wow they released butterflies at the end of the video, we love a teaser

**BasedButta** (6.5): same comment as their previous one


# Christians 

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Sounds half baked

**bespectacIed** (6): overrated tbh...

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (6): prep school magic yet not hogwarts yay

**mimins** (6): cute but bland

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): meh

**DaBigBoi** (5.5): Production here is better for me than Secret, but I don’t think the melody is as strong.

**apatel27** (5): They sound bored while singing

**prada** (5): wellx2

**PSSST12** (5): boring and forgettable

**sabooyah** (5): Average.

**SkylarV** (5): The better song from this album is I-Yah

**thegirlin512** (5): I liked from the rap segment on

**Zypker125** (4.3): We love the over-saturated color-seizure MVs.

**cuttackone** (4): not saving this song tho

**pig-serpent** (4): Shame a video this good was wasted on a song this boring.

**Round\_Log401** (4): Don't like this one as much, can't really find something that stands out to me.

**terrencelovescum** (4): hmmm...meh

**LesApfels** (3.5): I literally forgot this was playing

**lalafairy18** (1): Its nice but nothing special

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): One of my favourite debut songs in recent years. Weeekly as a group are really charming and I’m glad they’re seeing some success. It’s just a shame that this is the only song I enjoy from them :/

**wavingwolves** (10): I can't emphasize enough how wonderful this song was upon release. It gave me the feeling I had found a delicious bottle of cold water after walking through a dessert for days. It was fresh like nothing else being done at the time and for that it still holds such a dear place in my heart, since I miss more cutesy concepts being done. I love the cheerleader-like chants in this and I love how dynamic this song is. I know a lot of people have a problem with the introduction of the rap verse during the second chorus, but I really enjoy that too and I don't think it really takes anything out of the song at all, it adds to the dynamism of it if anything!

# She's Cheer Captain

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this takes me by surprise to claim my 11. high octane, major earworm, Girlfriend-era Avril Lavigne vibes with the chant, great concept...

**akanewasright** (10): I’m still proud of playing this during ult ult and turning some people on to this song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): u/runaway3212

**brpr425** (10): One of my favorite K-Pop debuts ever! I'm loving them as a group and excited for their future releases

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): bring cute kpop back 2022

**cuttackone** (10): a perfect debut

**DaBigBoi** (10): I just know the others agreed to quit the weekday names and didn’t tell Monday the memo. MEOW MEOW!

**GREY** (10): WAIT A MINUTE.

**hunnybee12** (10): after schoo11 coming to demolish the 2021 kpop rate iktr

**Nixon4Prez** (10): God damn what a debut.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): are Weeekly the drama???

**rikarikachan** (10): screams cheerleader chant unintelligibly nyanyanyanyanyanya

**SkylarV** (10): Such a fun, exciting, and unexpected song, especially for a debut, everything just works, it's a shame Weeekly has fallen so far away from this sound...

**welcome2thejam** (10): Fearful I was about to get "Avril or Gwen at their corniest" energy off the beginning, but by the time the chorus hit I was all in

**Zypker125** (10): Almost was my 11 (was between Deja Vu, So Bad, and Tag Me), Weeekly is an incredibly strong rookie group and I think they easily have the best facial expressions of ANY girl group in K-Pop atm (and I've watched ~3000 fancams of ~500 idols and ~50 groups, so I've done my research), they're extremely dynamic and energetic on stage.

**ebooks#5454** (9.8): sweet! fun! yes! i like it!

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.8): I should really listen to more Weekly songs that aren’t after school

**-chilazon-** (9.5): Amazing debut from one of my fave groups! They're just sooo talented, and they keep getting better! Hope they comeback soon.

**ChickyDipper** (9.5): this song sounds like pure childhood joy bottled up

**notarobot3675** (9.5): super cute!

**alwayswords** (9.3): pick me anthem

**sage** (9.3): slay debut

**throwaway-7650** (9.1): love this outside of the breakdown. (t)rap OUT

**2l82bstr8** (9): weak bridge and the nya-nya is a but much but I love the energy here. I can't remember why I disliked this

**AssailantArcturus** (9): i am in love with shin jiyoon

**bespectacIed** (9): clunky lyrics that will not age well but what a cute debut for a good, wholesome group. They have a bright future, After School is soo fun

**bookthieving** (9): u/weeekly

**chancehugs** (9): That hook is so addictive and fun to chant along to. This song never fails to give me an energy boost.

**ggal2020** (9): single handedly revived the cute concept!

**intheaftermath** (9): shoutout to when Weeekly released a song called After School and at least like 6 people thought After School released a song called Weeekly? good times. stream after school

**jasannn** (9): one hell of a grower

**PSSST12** (9): never paid attention to them but wow this is surprisingly good.

**rubbie** (9): Love this, catchy all around. Especially liked how the rap part is relatively calm while the rest is full of relentless fun.

**superr\_rad** (9): if after school is pop perfection, this is pretty damn close to it!!! Such an amazing debut, they really haven’t missed at all and im so excited for what else they have in store!! Also i dont know their names yet but whoever is dropping bars in the second verse is one of my fave nugu rappers! 4th gen female rappers are no joke tbh

**TiltControls** (9): this feels like it could fit in a sonic game and i don't know why

**Victerade** (9): BANGER! i love the dance break and the rap

**yatcho** (8.7): this is great for a rookie group doing a childish concept, they have a  lot of potential

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute

**anagalisgv** (8.5): I'm not a huge cute concept fan but they seem like they are genuinely having so much fun I can't not support it

**anothertown** (8.5): naturally i love stupid songs with girls chanting in them

**en#8502** (8.5): except don't. you need to soft reveal me

**Tazzachar** (8.5): cute af

**moonagenightmares** (8.3): “so gayyyy” so true queen

**2dina3dworld** (8): don't tag me! I am afraid of people perceiving my existence and having opinions of me that may be negative!

**BasedButta** (8): sorry if im starting to sound like a broken record pretty people that are reading this but god why the slow breakdowns this would be soooo much better without them just edit them out and the song would become an anthem

**CrimsonROSET** (8): don’t @ me

**DefaultPophead** (8): My first instinct was to rate this really low, but thankfully, I ignored that instinct. This is a bop and a half.

**fadedblue09** (8): Currently have my sights on this group after they covered EXID's Every Night. I must say,I love the early Red Velvet vibes

**sarcasticsobs** (8): “after school” outsold, but this was nice

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The “Nyah nyah nyah nyah” is just no… but the rest is pretty good!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): catchy but feels like a cheerleading song

**brokebutter** (7.6): it got a little annoying after overplaying it but its a solid debut and fun song

**becca** (7.5): aurkay

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): Tag Me is giving me early Twice vibes.

**lady\_sable** (7.5): such a cute debut! they remind me of 2nd gen girl groups

**pig-serpent** (7.5): The first 10 seconds of obnoxious cheerleader stuff convinced me this song was going to suck, but the rest of it is really good. But man, those opening few seconds.

**RiviereDeMemoires** (7.5): I would have chosen After School

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): im kinda living for the school idol aesthetic

**thegirlin512** (7.5): Not the strongest, but a cute upbeat song that seems like a fitting debut.

**thGnerd** (7.5): Overshadowed by after school

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): cute moment

**AxymHeart** (7): Really fun, After School is my fave

**billie\_\_** (7): parts of this are so good, i want to just cut + paste the rap and dance break and put them somewhere else.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I’m not crazy about the song but I am obsessed with the matching sweater look in this music video.

**BooksAndWhisky** (7): The chorus is straight crack inject it into my aorta rn

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (7): this song intro reminds me of the pop rocker woman that song skater boy

**ivyleaf33** (7): fun and catchy way to say "i'm not like the other girls"

ggsmackdown: 
**seanderlust** (7): I'm not sure if south Korea has an old navy equivalent but if so this is probably used in their back to school campaigns

**slimboyfriend** (7): ok I'm getting some avril vibes here (from her early melissa period)

**vaguelycatshaped** (7): A solid debut

**whoisValensi** (7): Remember when there was a rumour all members of Weeekly would be named after week days? Imagine saying your bias is Tuesday. Imagine that.

**savemeaseat143** (6.8): After School is better

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.7): she is catchy!

**agentofscranton** (6.5): i worry that after school was just a flash in the pan moment for weeekly because their other titles are just super meh imo

**RaphaelArthur** (6.5): good vocals and catchy but not much to say

**-mczrv-** (6): kinda annoying, but in a fun way!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): credit for having a different sound but it doesnt quite work for me

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (6): classic school idol that isnt in school pretty refreshing

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): unfortunately this is too childish even for me

**runaway3212** (6): ya
# And I'm on the bleachers :/ 

**poemforsmallthings** (5.7): Momoland I'll never forgive you

**mimins** (5.5): if I listened to it enough I would like it more but I do not want to listen to it anymore

**apatel27** (5): It's fine but pretty generic, feels likes they've got a checklist of what a k-pop song should be and are just following that

**Cooler\_lin** (5): painfully forgettable, i literally forgot to write about it was genuinely shocked to see it here. re-listened to it and yea...i see why i forgot, nothing special about it

**Flippantry** (5): The dance break instrumental elevates this otherwise forgettable song

**frogaranaman** (5): STOP BEING SO GAY??????????

**Round\_Log401** (5): I like the first half of the chorus. I personally don't like the shoutiness of the song + I'm just personally not a big fan of aegyo. I don't like it when cute concepts lean into the baby-like cuteness.

**sabooyah** (5): The verses are horrible but the chorus is so catchy!

**ke1per** (4.5): could do without the rap but the bridge is lovely

**prada** (4.5): overrated and snooze

**anzunagi** (4): but After School is that jam

**lalafairy18** (4): That rap verse feels like a completely different song

**bulforster** (3.9): this is quite annoying tbh, the whistling in the production is especially grating. still kinda boppy tho

**flavasavavandal** (3): please Mickey is the only song that can exist that sounds like it should be played exclusively for cheerleaders

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Not putting After School feels like sabotage...

**waluigiest** (3): the longer I listened the more confused I got

**terrencelovescum** (1): this chanty type of song is the music equivalent of minions.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): It's...fine? I literally have nothing to say about this song, I don't feel strongly about a single thing.

**wavingwolves** (3.6): Oh, the song that was supposed to go to CLC and instead landed with IZ*ONE only to become the major hit CLC never had? Yeah, I can't even lie, I hated this song from the second it dropped and if this rate was happening in 2018 this would most likely be my 0. It actually grew on me after all these years because I discovered I'm capable of enjoying the verses even if I find the chorus completely repugnant. In any case, the girls all look and sound great here (especially Eunbi) and I actually really like the choreo for this. Bigger groups who can serve choreo are always a gift!

# The French 

**2dina3dworld** (10): wow, this is not a cover of the Edith Piaf version which I have in a rate idea that you can vote for next cycle but it does bop all the same!

**agentofscranton** (10): they never really ventured out of the formula they established with la vie en rose but god what a fuckin formula it was. if it ain't broke don't fix it.

**anzunagi** (10): what a debut

**bespectacIed** (10): one of the most explosive debuts of all time. Everybody was gagged, everybody fainted, everybody stanned immediately.

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): SMASHED it out of the park right on debut! Everything about this is chef’s kiss, from the concept to the powerful pre-chorus to the fake drop in the chorus to the brief harmonies in the bridge

**brpr425** (10): An amazing debut! I admit sometimes I wish it was given to CLC instead though

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): literally slayed best debut of the produce groups

**DaBigBoi** (10): [Korean slayage] ROSE! https://youtu.be/h_BaeeZbg-E

**en#8502** (10): living for horrible french pronounciations in kpop

**ggal2020** (10): izone ate it up more than clc ever could

**GREY** (10): That moment in time where cheshires were convinced clc wouldve munched this harder than SLAY*ZONE omfgggg that was embarrassing for them

**PSSST12** (10): The choreo of this song. . Something LGBT happened that night when I first saw the mv. Couple with that light almost airy instrumental, this is one of the best kpop debut songs out there.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Can we popularize this concept instead of Teen Crush?

**sage** (10): ROSE.

**thGnerd** (10): Biased because WIZONE but one of the best debuts

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'm an ioi-nator but this clears their discography

**lady\_sable** (9.5): still one of the best recent debuts

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.5): not a personal favorite but I respect how iconic this debut was

**xedophobic** (9.5): it would've been a 10 if it weren't ripped from clc

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): why does the mv take place in that one room from twin peaks

**1998tweety** (9): pop perfection

**ChickyDipper** (9): a great debut song

**dlong56655** (9): one of the great debut eras

**ivyleaf33** (9): one of the best debuts in the past few years, the perfect concept for the perfect song

**JohnnyToby** (9): this caused a major shift actually, not a ten bc nako and Hitomi deserved more lines

**ke1per** (9): rappy parts fit really well, great last chorus

**sabooyah** (9): I! Love! This! Song! SooooOOoooO addicting the only thing that could make it better would be some stronger vocals but you know what? I don't even care this song slaps.

**SkylarV** (9): Beautiful pop song, the anti-drop is *chef's kiss*

**sarcasticsobs** (8.7): i keep harping on the prechoruses in these songs and i will not stop. kwon eunbi, especially

**-mczrv-** (8.5): this song shouldn’t be this good lowkey

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): idk why people don't like this one. the voice mixing is a hard-sell but their performances are so full and bright, it's hard not to get swept up. it's a bit downtempo but I think it's the right call for this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): This chorus doesn’t quite live up to the rest of the song but I really like the overall sound of this.

**dilemmaofahedgehog** (8.5): It sucks to me that clc got close enough to have this song to start teasing it in their socials god cube is a mess. Good song though

**reiichitanaka** (8.5): Very strong debut… that they stole from CLC, a fact that makes them

**savemeaseat143** (8.4): all around great kpop song

**-chilazon-** (8): So, I like this song. I think it's impossible to totally dislike this song completely. But it's just a bit too over-produced and busy for me, and too high-pitched.

**celladonn** (8): Pretty much everything else this group released was Not For Me but I do like this song

**chancehugs** (8): This song makes me feel luxurious.

**DefaultPophead** (8): This is really cute. Really like their energy!

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (8): Great

**jasannn** (8): that double chorus :deadbanana:

**MToms** (8): chorus antidrop is probably my least favorite part

**RaphaelArthur** (8): great unique beat and melodies but could be better carried

**Round\_Log401** (8): I watched the entirety of PD48 & I did not expect this AT ALL. Nobody did I think, which is also why it is so great, apart from that it's just a great song.

**runaway3212** (8): Yasssss

**thegirlin512** (8): Oh THIS is why IZONE is so popular. A bit cluttered sounding in parts, but I love the instrumental.

**TiltControls** (8): wow I can't believe this was secretly another french rate in disguise

**whoisValensi** (8): Remember kids, this was almost a CLC song, REMEMBER WHAT THEY TOOK FROM YOU.

**bulforster** (7.6): the guitar drop is an interesting choice after the buildup and I don't hate it but I think it's holding me back from loving the song a bit.

**anagalisgv** (7.5): as a French speaker, the lyric 'my la vie en rose' does slightly bother me tbh

**Victerade** (7.5): their weakest title if we dont count the jp ones me thinks cube shouldve kept it for clc they carried it better

**yatcho** (7.5): How many frickin girls are in this group...? Anyway clearly new to them and that was a pretty good introduction song

**becca** (7): just like for not shy I like this song.. sometimes

**Cooler\_lin** (7): catchy and refreshing instrumental, nice bridge. vocals could be better but i appreciated them in the climax/ending

**CrimsonROSET** (7): pink like the color of your

**frogaranaman** (7): kinda slaying in that red

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Edith piaf outsold

**rubbie** (7): Not sure what to think of this one. It's typical of the kpop songs of the era, breezy and summery and fun and expertly constructed yet somewhat unsubstantial, it's like the melodies have trouble landing for me

**superr\_rad** (7): this song is really lovely, i just wish the chorus was stronger.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): minus 1 point for not being an actual cover of the edith piaf song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I think I like it?

**Zypker125** (6.6): I still can't stand Hitomi's/Nako's/Sakura's/Hyewon's/Wonyoung's vocals, I find them either too nasally, squeaky, overly high-pitched, and/or weak-sounding, and they legitimately bring down all of IZ\*ONE's songs for me. Nothing against them as people, but in terms of their vocals I can never enjoy them.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): middling

**pig-serpent** (6.5): It's catchy but also not very exciting.

**ebooks#5454** (6): they should've sang in french

**ImADudeDuh** (6): grace jones and gaga ended these fads, i fear

**intheaftermath** (6): the prechorus was way too intense for that chill chorus and it put me off in listening to it

**mimins** (5): the 'ROSE' in the chorus!!!!

**prada** (5): well

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): wasn't bad but it was really just background noise

**waluigiest** (5): …why did I think this would actually be a cover?

**Overall Average**: 7.444 **// Average Controversy:** 1.950 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/tacGhOH.png)**

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.000): No offence to IZ\*ONE fans but all of their title tracks are just so Nothing ™ to me. The songs aren't terrible but I don't really care about them either. Truly no thoughts head empty. But stan Chaewon.

**wavingwolves** (4.967): Well, they managed to beat their senior Produce group, I.O.I, so props to that, I guess! IZ\*ONE is far from my favourite group for titles, that's for sure. While they do have a very distinctive sound it's 90% of the time a miss for me. I just found the drops ugly-sounding and abrasive in a way that doesn't work for me at all, but their b-sides are diverse enough for me to find something I like in their discography, which I actually consider quite solid with tons of highlights.

**Frostbite522** (10.000): My favourite group, so am a bit biased

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.767): such a shame they disbanded I really believe they could’ve become the second most successful group to come out of a survival show after twice

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): SSOTS over panorama and I'd give them a perfect 10 average

**bespectacIed** (9.333): fly high, angles! Wonyoung and Yujin, you'll always be famous. Chaeyeon deserves better. For the rest, i wish them an ounce of luck

**-mczrv-** (9.200): a little sad SSOTS isn’t here for me to give it the 10 it deserves but I understand

**xedophobic** (8.833): chaewon i miss you

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.667): Among the female project groups, IZ\*ONE established the standard of bringing songs that will be remembered for generations even if the group’s lifespan isn’t quite long. I really like how the group brought back some of the bubblegum sound that is missing in this current generation of K-pop. Such a shame they couldn’t last long as a group but at least they served and went out with a bang. (IZ*ONE bias: N/A because I don’t know the members well enough)

**brpr425** (8.667): As a Nako fan since 2013, it's crazy to see her as an internationally recognized K-Pop member! So happy for her and so glad IZONE got a lot of bops

**yatcho** (8.567): hugely impressed by this group, a real shame they didnt last very long I would love to see more of them

**whoisValensi** (8.500): This just in, idiot man misses another entire group during their lifespan because he's an idiot. Truth be told, at the time I checked out their debut and was like "Eh okay whatever" and at the time I was very "out" of K-Pop (Mostly due to things that had happened in December 2017 taking a very long and hard toll on me...) As for their first comeback, I'm sure I skipped over it. And as I got "back" into K-Pop (very very slowly yet surely... Like it took til like late 2020 to really fully bounce back...) I had always heard talk of IZ*ONE, YET I never quite felt the need to check them out? I can't say I'm sure what led me to do that, I'm assuming it was a feeling of "Eh I've already missed so much of their stuff what's the point" especially knowing they were a Produce group and that's like... Limited time only, get 'em while they're hot lol. But idk I kinda wanna go thru their stuff because this is all pretty solid.

**thegirlin512** (8.333): I think I've been sleeping on them for too long. NGL, I kind of wrote them off because of the rigging stuff, but their songs are apparently good so?

**MToms** (8.167): Great songs overall, maybe a bit too high pitched and electronic for me but always enjoyable.

**ke1per** (8.167): songs sound very similar, but if it's not broke don't fix it

**runaway3212** (8.167): Kep1er coming to win 2022 kpop tbh but

**vayyiqra** (8.000): Don't know much about this group except that they have a lot of members. They're pretty good, nothing groundbreaking but fun.

**BooksAndWhisky** (7.867): If this is the end result then maybe… rigging good?

**rslashpoopheads** (7.667): Undisband them right now!

**reiichitanaka** (7.333): Rule #1 of survival show trash like myself : don’t get attached to the contestants, let alone the final group. My top two picks made it but I still didn’t follow them closely. Their overall discography is better than Wanna One’s though (Energetic was great, the rest was… lackluster)

**toyletpauper** (7.300): Just a good group. None of their title tracks has amazed me but they are nice to listen to, and get stuck in my head every so often.

**welcome2thejam** (7.000): Would've come out with a much higher group average if the first two songs didn't each have a super annoying element. Panorama kinda won out in this group just by not doing anything to upset me

**pig-serpent** (6.667): They write some decent music I guess but not enough for me to really register them as their own group.

**rikarikachan** (6.500): IZ tends to be a little too shiny and pristine for me. The real bangers were the b-sides, like Airplane and Love Bubble (yes, really)

**LesApfels** (6.167): You guys did Secret Story of the Swan so dirty

**donutseer** (6.000): Violeta is their best track. WJSN-lite, without the vocal prowess.

**dekubaku** (6.000): I don't follow any produce series so I'm not too much into this group. LVER slaps though!

**apatel27** (5.333): Some variety would be nice

**-chilazon-** (5.000): It makes me really sad because I like the girls, but I can't stand most of their music. Way too high pitched, too many sounds going on for me. It's nothing wrong with them; I just can't handle it.

**Round\_Log401** (5.000): I will miss them for their choreo a lot, so complex & always so in sync. Also really liked their colour concept.

**fadedblue09** (3.500): Maybe one day I'll learn to appreciate Produce groups from a purely musical level...but maybe not now

**anarkyah** (2.333): I’m shocked I didn’t like their songs that much. Although they were nice to listen to, they seemed all to be very similar and boring?

vivianlight: I'm honestly proud team IZ*ONE. Too little time to really got invested in them properly but they somehow still got a lot of my attention in 2019/2020 until their eventual disbandment. 

I get why their title tracks sound may not be for everyone but it was perfect imho and I deeply miss a concept and sound like this in current groups.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): What a banger! It was truly over for the other girlies when ITZY debuted with a song as good as this. I’ve always loved this song, the only part I disliked was the “keep your chin up” bit but even that’s grown on me.

**wavingwolves** (10): One of my favourite debuts ever and still probably my favourite debut song from a 4th gen girl group, sorry Weeekly! I can't explain exactly what it is about this song I find so exciting, I just do. The second the beat drops and the "d-dalla dalla dalla" starts I'm sold, every single time. This was extremely polarizing upon release, but it was an immediate hit for me from the get go and it never lost its magic. I understand the biggest problem people seem to have with this song is the overall bratty attitude on the delivery and the chant-y breakdown. It reminded me right away of the signature [lemme see! how you gonna treat me! ain't no easy! think about it TWICE!](https://youtu.be/cGoibt-MxDA), another instant hit for me, and that's a well of a reference for a song to have.

# Love themselves 

**CaptainDaisyG** (11): One of my most played kpop songs ever.

**2dina3dworld** (10): best music video involving someone standing on a car hood

**bigbigbee** (10): I know, I know that it's literally an NLOG song...but I kind of appreciate the brazenness of it. It doesn't feel obnoxious to me. I also think that this is one of the best debuts ever; it stands out from the field, and you also really get a sense of who ITZY is.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): this was such a good debut. a cultural reset

**celladonn** (10): Now this was an instant classic

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i love ~~myself~~ this song!!!

**DaBigBoi** (10): I’ve listened to quite a few debuts from all generations, but this remains one of if not my favorite. https://youtu.be/ulPLH90hap8

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Now…this is how you do a debut track. Dalla Dalla alone is one of the reasons why Itzy deserved the crown as monster rookies in 2019.

**en#8502** (10): they're not like the other girls yall

**jasannn** (10): the casual kpop fans thinking this song is messy when the structure is pretty easy to identify. i laugh.

**JohnnyToby** (10): it's been in my top ten end of year most streamed songs list for like 2 years now

**LesApfels** (10): What an entrance!

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): it's fun!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): self loving queens

**Round\_Log401** (10): I was beyond overwhelmed on the first listen. This grew on me so much but it also took a good year.

**rubbie** (10): All-time great debut. Fun, unpredictable, catchy af.

**vayyiqra** (10): god that bass is awesome

**waluigiest** (10): something shifted

**sage** (9.7): its too avant garde for some people to get it..

**anagalisgv** (9): I love everything about this except the cheerleader bridge lol

**BooksAndWhisky** (9): Alexa play Megan’s Piano

**DefaultPophead** (9): Okay yes, I'll buy what you're selling.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the I love myself makes me think of hailee Steinfeld.. her impact

**notallslendermen** (9): The chorus is so addicting

**nt96** (9): Sucky Sucky 5 Dalla Dalla

**skargardin** (9): such a stron debut

**superr\_rad** (9): I really feel like itzy’s debut concept was so refreshing compared to many other ggs. They really said self love !!! they’ve obviously strayed away from that concept since not shy, but these girls are so powerful and I love that JYP set them up with an empowering teen crush concept before getting into love songs as TTs!

**Victerade** (9): WE NEED FUNZY BACK. one of the best debuts at 4th gen

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (8.9): you have to listen to it a couple of times to get used to it but we love the self-love Anthem

**brokebutter** (8.8): really fun

**-chilazon-** (8.5): Great debut! Just not exactly my favorite style of music, but it's still a bop. A little bit too chanty.

**2l82bstr8** (8.5): a bit one-note and I dislike the breakdowns, but a lot of fun. it's really striking how they've stuck with their original, very well-defined concept from the start

**anothertown** (8.5): i would be interested in seeing an effortpost about elevator ding samples

**astrologicalangel** (8.5): this song singlehandedly got me into k-pop

**lady\_sable** (8.5): absolute banger of a debut

**mimins** (8.5): still their best song imo. its so much fun and has cohesive layers

**rikarikachan** (8.5): This feels like such a throwback. It's not perfect but it's, as they say, a certified iconic bop.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): still my favorite of their choruses. not wild about the bridge.

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**becca** (8): love the dance to this song

**bespectacIed** (8): Itzy vs their imaginary haters and nonexistent insecurities Part 1 of n lmaooo. I am bitter that this was their debut, not Want It which is better and the one actually used in their debut teasers

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I really like the performance and melody on this but that instrumental is not great.

**Cooler\_lin** (8): a fantastic debut, i still dance to it everytime i hear it.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i love you too

**cuttackone** (8): they came out swinging

**dlong56655** (8): Yeji really did that

**ebooks#5454** (8): i once had to edit a dance video of this from my college's official kpop dance group so i heard this opening 50 million times and it still haunts me

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the bridge gives me cheerleading vibes

**rslashpoopheads** (8): What a banger of a chorus and a not banger of verses.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): I love Hailee Steinfeld omg

**Stryxen** (8): girl its just fun! It’s festive! Sometimes you want to be in that mood.

**terrencelovescum** (8): seeing the english translation of the lyrics in the mv is always a mistake because god they're terrible...

**bulforster** (7.8): I would really like this if there wasn't that verse where they just take turns breathlessly shouting a couple lines each

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): obnoxious and annoying but also kind of a bop?

**RaphaelArthur** (7.5): great and inovative song but bad vocals

**reiichitanaka** (7.5): A good debut is one that establishes the group’s identity, and in that sense Dalla Dalla’s a great one.

**seanderlust** (7.5): this grew on me over time while we were rating this. it's a basic pop song with a basic pop message of "love yourself in all the ways you're different" but it's a very well-executed version of that concept

**TiltControls** (7.5): parts of this I really love, but overall it's more towards good instead of great

**savemeaseat143** (7.4): it has an amazing hook

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): wow what an absolute mess

**BasedButta** (7): iconic

**chancehugs** (7): Trust JYP to make Ryujin lead rapper and then give her 1 out of 5 rap verses in the whole song. Good song otherwise.

**ChickyDipper** (7): the chorus shared between Yeji and Lia is by far the best part of this song and just about manages to save the cringy chanting

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): love the fits

**ivyleaf33** (7): i didn't like this song when it came out, but it's definitely grown on me a lot

**MimisChoice9763** (7): very catchy

**sabooyah** (7): Fun! Childish, but fun!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it's not ICY but it's enjoyable

**akanewasright** (6.5): me when I have money idk I didn’t read the translations

**fadedblue09** (6.5): The chorus is a delight but it's the only part I can vibe with….and yet it's still the one song I probably like from them

**thGnerd** (6.5): Everyone loves this song but I never really got it

**whoisValensi** (6.5): .........Sorry but I think I like the DALLASK remix more than the original lol. Idk why but that remix just hits some mark for me that the original doesn't, whoops!

**flavasavavandal** (3.5): I’m sorry, usually vocals aren’t gonna kill it for me unless there’s a specific effect or technique but what were those opening vocals. Combined with production that feels out of sync with ITZY, just an ugh song

**apatel27** (3): Pretty forgettable. It's not genre shifting if the transitions are stop start. It's just snippets shoved together

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): This song feels pretty by-the-numbers, and I don’t like the chorus. The k-pop songs sounding very early 10s EDM pop can be very hit-or-miss for me

**PSSST12** (3): this is absolutely unlistenable to me even now but somehow its their most succesful song. Go figure.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): oh god not girlboss kpop

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): I was in love with this song from the minute it came out. The city pop here is just done so well and I love the emotion in their voices. This is personally my favourite song from them (although I haven’t heard many). I’m really happy that this ended up placing much higher than I thought it would. Brave Bros we love you sometimes!

**wavingwolves** (8.1): This IS city pop! Another song that found success later than its release, this time back in 2020. Sleek, elegant and catchy, they really shine here. The music video also serves "done with a 200 dollar budget" and I love it.

---

# Likes car advert music

**Alumineous** (11): I'm going through a lot of city pop albums right now. Hmm, I literally hear city pop vibes. Like, that BASS GUITAR and the slight funkiness that channels Toshiki Kadomatsu. Wait, I just checked out the music video. They... THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE???!

**glitter408** (11): i love this song sm

**-chilazon-** (10): So dreamy and retro! Also I really like the lyrics. I really love the 80s wave that hit kpop in 2020. Honestly, Brave Girls pulls off different concepts so well.

**2l82bstr8** (10): such a soothing, harmonious song

**bespectacIed** (10): city pop excellence

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): CITYPOP PERFECTION HELL YEAH

**chancehugs** (10): This song has a very calming and cathartic effect on me for some reason. It's one of my go-tos when I'm feeling anxious or down.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): city pop excellence

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this absolutely shitting all over rollin

**dlong56655** (10): This song also blowing up just makes me so happy because it is easily their best

**GREY** (10): gay synth song you already know im yassing!

**Hwaiting\_\_** (10): One of my favorite songs ever

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is better than rollin’

**mimins** (10): city pop perfection your honor

**Nixon4Prez** (10): Citypop perfection

**pornypete** (10): but I'm glad it did, and led to this! As well as After We Ride! Crazy good songs

**PSSST12** (10): YASSSSSS this should have gotten the clout rollin did 😤😤

**RandomHypnotica** (10): is this city pop

**rubbie** (10): Absolute fucking bop. Some people love to meme him but brave bros >>> your favourite producer.

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSSSSSS

**sage** (10): is this what yall were hearing in rollin bc this is literally so much better

**seanderlust** (10): this is so smooth!

**throwaway-7650** (10): deserves to place higher than rollin', let's do it raters

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I love this! It’s like listening to Doja Cat guilt-free!

**Victerade** (10): THEIR BEST SONG! city pop done perfectly literally perfectly verses chorus production their vocals i love everything about this song actually!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Very on-brand for me to do this rate to learn more about K-pop and come a coin flip away from giving my 11 to the city pop song. Anyway, this has been in my head for the past few days: killer groove, catchy as hell, good performances, fantastic driving music (and it damn well better be given the subject matter). And okay, maybe a little part of me is still riding the high of the Plastic Love win that'll highly rate anything remotely city pop

**ke1per** (9.5): gorgeous retro bliss but a weak bridge drops it a little

**lady\_sable** (9.5): i'm always a slut for city pop

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.5): it breaks my heart thinking this was supposed to be their last song

**vivianlight** (9.5): Underappreciated almost masterpiece

**brokebutter** (9.2): ive overplayed this one but its still good

**ebooks#5454** (9.2): OMG CITY POP

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): I like the sound a lot

**-mczrv-** (9): a complete vibe

**1998tweety** (9): shes sophisticated

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): this is city pop

**Cooler\_lin** (9): city pop banger, i think this better than rollin' but I have to give miss rollin' her props

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The fact that this hasn’t had the success “Rollin’” has is just proof that sometimes storylines are more important than quality because this is the superior song

**milkywayinradius** (9): chill nighttime song

**notallslendermen** (9): You can never go wrong with city pop

**notarobot3675** (9): this is such a lovely chill song

**sabooyah** (9): The best kpop citypop song!

**Tazzachar** (9): City pop fans losing their minds on this one

**thGnerd** (9): Would be considered a way better song if Rollin didnt take all the attention

**vayyiqra** (9): Yes this is city pop (and good)

**yatcho** (9): You can tell they had NO budget for this video and its taking me outtt but they still did what they needed to, synthwave will always sound good to me idc how tired it is at this point

**intheaftermath** (8.5): I know Rollin' is their big culturally important song but this chorus is so much better

**prada** (8.5): deserved the rollin hype more

**whoisValensi** (8.5): Oh so we're in our city pop era now, eh? While it's not the strongest city pop offering I've ever heard, it's still good so. I can't give it too much shit.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.1): we enjoy a chill, jazzy tune here, don’t we?

**becca** (8): great song!!

**Bryoneehhh\_** (8): i wish after we ride was here because it would literally win this rate

**DaBigBoi** (8): We move

**DefaultPophead** (8): I can see myself replaying this. Really good follow up single from the girls.

**en#8502** (8): typical city pop-ish song, and it did not disappoint!

**fadedblue09** (8): I randomly stumbled this song on r/kpop last 2020 and I thought I 'd never hear from them again

**ignitethephoenix** (8): omg their future nostalgia era

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): iS tHiS cItY pOp?

**bulforster** (7.9): this album art... oh they were *flop* flops, the song deserves better.

**ggal2020** (7.8): we’re stealing your car!

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): Paired with some pacing issues, We Ride is still a chill bop.

**celladonn** (7.5): Great vibes but a bit forgettable

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): It’s like trying to be awesome but falls closer to mid, nice vibes though

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): We vibe.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): if you couldn't tell yet I'm a slvt for retro

**CrimsonROSET** (7): soft disco, like watered down

**RaphaelArthur** (7): great vocals, nice music

**SkylarV** (7): Pretty chill, relaxing listen, but I want a little more excitement than it offers, especially as a title track

**Stryxen** (7): we ride more like we died

**thegirlin512** (7): Pleasant.

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): citypop but without the distinctive vocal tricks that make citypop tick

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): ok does this basically sound like the say so instrumental yes but the say so instrumental IS good so like....

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): A retro-themed music video? In 2020? Revolutionary. Song is nice enough tho.

**TragicKingdom1** (6): we love rihanna's most iconic single

# Gay people (can't drive)

**ivyleaf33** (5.5): this was kinda bland tho sorry brave girls

**BasedButta** (5): a bit too dreary doesnt make me feel anything

**cuttackone** (5): i dont think they will be a consistent thing

**frogaranaman** (5): is this like a car centered girl group or something

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): it's fine

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): I'm just really fed-up of this summery guitar tone that seems to have been really popular these last few years

**apatel27** (4): Not everyone needs to do an 80s throwback song. Especially not a city pop throwback if there's no charisma in your voices

**Zypker125** (3.1): We going going going we rideeeeeee..... oh wait, that was the Enhypen song.

**pig-serpent** (3): I'm glad there's kpop songs aimed at pleasing my grandparents.

**terrencelovescum** (2): we ride, when we ride we ride...wait it's not the rihanna song. it's not nearly as good either.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): I like this a lot less than I used to, mainly because the chorus is a bit annoying to me now but the rest of the song is so good I overlook it. Still, I think it’s a great song and everything about this era was so quintessential LOONA for me. I feel like this is when they really formed a group identity ~~and then the girl crush came along~~. I actually expected this to do a biiiit better but #21 isn’t a bad placement!

**wavingwolves** (4.5): I have never really liked this song, but I also can't really find it in myself to hate it. I think what really brings out the love for it is the [performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADJorSdTRCI) of it, which is great, but the song fails to reach that high in its own. Parts of this are way too high pitched for me to take any enjoyment out of it and I feel as if this sounds older than what actually is.

# Orbits

**brpr425** (11): I didn't get the LOONA hype for a while, but this song completely changed my mind! Beautiful and one of my favorite K-Pop songs ever.

**lalafairy18** (11): I genuinely don't know if I'll ever love another song as much as I love this one

**missmawma** (11): (its perfect)

**anagalisgv** (10): the song + music video + choreography all together are truly transformative

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): good

**bespectacIed** (10): This was a moment. The whole global empowerment, "we are all loona" bit is so cheesy in retrospect but that shit made me cry!

**bluetriangles04** (10): MonoTree come back home...

**brokebutter** (10): everyone says this is their best title track but hi high is better

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): it was such a cultural reset but if it had been hi high instead… would’ve gotten the 11 i fear i hate sabotaging loona sorry

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): an 11 if we were rating choreo

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (10): crystal clear direction and cinematography

**cuttackone** (10): this is one of the songs of my life

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Butterfly is definitely an interesting title track to push but I feel like this song really showcases Loona’s versatility really well. I wish we could get this kind of song back from them.

**glitter408** (10): best loona title track

**GREY** (10): one of the best songs ive ever heard imagine my disgust when they werent even nominated for best gg choreo that year OMFGGGG i cant believe the silly orbit in me even thought they had a chance

**huntyphobic** (10): One of the highest highs in LOONA’s discography… this was tew good I fear. PTT got me worried they will never go back to this sound doe :(

**Jhe116** (10): MonoTree could do no wrong I don’t care what others say

**ke1per** (10): mystical, whimsical, melancholy and the rap knocked it out of first place again

**Kwcty6888** (10): a perfect song. Would’ve gotten my 11 if not for psycho

**lady\_sable** (10): absolutely beautiful and transcendent, this era was loona at their peak

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): the choreography is impeccable and the MV is so beautiful

**notarobot3675** (10): this whole era by them remains unmatched

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i can’t believe this MV invented transitions

**Round\_Log401** (10): This one, I LOVE. Sounds beautiful, message is beautiful, the choreo is mesmerizing. The representation in the mv is beautiful.

**sage** (10): absolute slay

**SatC1** (10): the peak

**savemeaseat143** (10): I am definitely letting the choreo impact how I feel about the song but So What?

**skargardin** (10): their best wbk

**Stryxen** (10): it was just one of the best songs of all time really

**throwaway-7650** (10): the MV is more diverse than loona's fandom on twitter

**vayyiqra** (10): Cute and has that "ethereal" sound I love. The bass in the drop is cool too.

**note\_2\_self** (9.9): Only because Pyscho and Fancy exist Otherwise perfect

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): the squealing is a lot but everything else is pitch perfect. (and don't get me started on the choreography of the decade)

**thGnerd** (9.5): Loonas best

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): this mv is really gorgeous, i definitely bumped up the score cause of it

**1998tweety** (9): the fucking serve. The production on this is immaculate

**Alumineous** (9): Goddamn, that chorus. They cut me in half with those gorgeous vocals.

**astrologicalangel** (9): this video is so satisfying to watch

**becca** (9): flyyyy like a butterfly

**chancehugs** (9): That high pitched "Fly like a butterfly" in the chorus could've been really annoying, but it's an absolute eargasm. Love the whole ethereal vibe of the song.

**en#8502** (9): the superior Butterfly in this rate

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (9): Production was so good

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I always forget about how good this is but then I click play and they start cooing and that DROP hits and I’m an Orbit all over again

**rubbie** (9): I can def understand why Loona got into money trouble, this mv looks pretty damn expensive ! the song is also gorgeous ofc

**whoisValensi** (9): The choreo of this is so pretty yeah... I'd suggest looking it up if you haven't before.

**ebooks#5454** (8.6): you could tell me this was a early BTS song/m/v and i would believe you

**anothertown** (8.5): Wings =) Wings =)

**mimins** (8.5): beautiful mv and aesthetic song! choreo is also iconic.

**TiltControls** (8.5): love the high parts here!

**jasannn** (8.2): the better butterfly

**SkylarV** (8.2): This is more fully realized as a performance rather than as just a song

**seanderlust** (8.1): the "wing, wing" part is really cheesy to me idk why

**-chilazon-** (8): Beautiful song! Some parts in the chorus are a bit too shrill for me

**KoolFunk** (8): This video is gorgeous

**prada** (8): WINGS WINGS

**terrencelovescum** (8): mariah who?

**thegirlin512** (8): This is a really pretty song! I love the instruments and the production especially.

**Victerade** (8): aged worse than milk but still amazing concept

**yatcho** (8): Unusually mature and restrained for a kpop release (especially compared to hi high), the MV and especially the choreography are some of the best ever. I just wish I could say I loved the song more, it sounded dated on release and has not aged the best since

**toyletpauper** (7.7): It’s a very thematic song and I do like it, but since it’s a bit more chill and a monotone vibe, I do have to be in the right mood for it. However, this comeback was everything with the album, teasers and music video.

**-mczrv-** (7.5): I SHOULD love this song

**BasedButta** (7.5): way better than i remembered actually especially with mv

**2dina3dworld** (7.3): the breakdown takes up too much of the song, but there’s a very solid song hidden within

**rikarikachan** (7.3): I get why so many people like this. I don't like future bass drops, but I get it. Could do without some of the squeaky high notes.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): cute for the most part, chorus is not really that good but also i kinda like it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I really like the chorus on this but the verses are just a little…loud?

**BooksAndWhisky** (7): I think the choreo brainwashed me into thinking I like the song more than I actually do because it’s been years and the chorus still gives me headaches

**Cooler\_lin** (7): probably could have gotten a much higher score if it didn't have that "fly like a butterfly" that was 6 octaves too high in the chorus

**DefaultPophead** (7): They all have such lovely voices, but I know they also have much lovelier songs

**flavasavavandal** (7): I didn’t realise that Kygo produced kpop songs

**mengzhongmeng** (7): choreo is stunning and the mv as well, but i just find the "wings wings" and "fly like a butterfly" in the chorus a bit grating

**MimisChoice9763** (7): I enjoy the ethereal feel to it

**MToms** (7): first listen, not a fan of EDM

=====

ggsmackdown: **PSSST12** (7): All of that hype and for WHAT?

**RaphaelArthur** (7): good song but a bit repetitive

**sabooyah** (7): I love everything except that super high pitch in the chorus.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I wish I could score this higher but all the “weengs weengs” sound so ridiculous

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): not a huge fan of the chorus

**ivyleaf33** (6.5): dance and outfits are iconic, but the song isn't much

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I'm new to k-pop--does every group keep one girl around for the whistle tones whenever they need some in a song?

**akanewasright** (6): I generally like early loona quite a bit but this is so generic

**CrimsonROSET** (6): stan loona

**dlong56655** (6): I've never gotten the hype for this one

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Where do they keep getting these giant ass building sets. Where.

**sarcasticsobs** (6): not into the drop chorus. cold take: song is alright but choreo outshines

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): stunning vocals

# Ujungs

**alwayswords** (5.7): this song was ruined for me after i saw the chorus called a got7 beat drop

**Zypker125** (5.7): The squeaky high pitched "Fly like a butterfly" vocals actually hurt my ears.

**DaBigBoi** (5.5): Honestly wish there was more singing, but it sounds nice.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): This song was starting off well for me, but the way they sing “wings, wings” I really dislike. It brings the song down for me for being so distracting.

**fadedblue09** (5): This is probably the most classic LOONA of the songs here, but tbh that makes it less of my taste. I dont like how half of the song is just [instrumental drop]

**sublimeMusic** (5): this is my least favorite title track and I think I might be the only one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): girl what the hell is that falsetto

**bulforster** (4.6): why did they make it sound like mosquitoes were singing the chorus with them

**apatel27** (4): Smooth little track until the ugly edm drop. Why do they have to ruin every damn song with an edm drop

**ChickyDipper** (4): the choreo is beautiful but I've never really liked the song that much

**vaguelycatshaped** (4): I know this song has a great meaning or whatever but I don't like it I'm sorry

**runaway3212** (3.5): NAURRR!!

**bigbigbee** (3): I can't score this song high because the first time I heard it was someone singing it in a discord voice call (no one else was talking) and they were awful. and here's the thing - this song sung badly and this song sung well are NOT that far off from each other (the missing ingredient is pitch correction). because of that I can't hear this song and not also hear that person's screechy warbling in my mind, to the point where I actively avoid this song

**frogaranaman** (3): Youtuber outro music ass chorus

**pig-serpent** (3): Remember when every pop song had a mediocre future bass drop that missed the point of what made the genre popular in the first place?

**JohnnyToby** (2): it's just screeching tbh...

**Awkward\_King** (1): one of my flatmates has gonorrhoea rn and i would rather be him than listening to this song

**harumiyo** (0): the high-pitched vocals sound like the noise my horse made when it died

**ignitethephoenix** (0): oof this song is not it. Between the pitchy high vocals in the chorus and dated production drops, this is kind of messy. At least when BP sounds dated they are having fun, nothing fun about this

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): I LOVE SONGS ABOUT BEING IN LOVE!! I wasn’t expecting this to be my 11 but this song just does everything right. It’s so bright and happy, I just love it. Very sad that no one has managed to replicate this, not even OMG themselves :/ I also really love the MV, the choreo, and the styling…they just didn’t miss once.

**wavingwolves** (10): Ever wondered what a 5th season would be? OH MY GIRL did too and they decided it would be LOVE! Yeah, the acronym stands for Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, Love if you were wondering. This song is magical, I'm a huge sucker for the this kind of big, ethereal and timeless sounds some girl groups ~~used to~~ do. It always makes something in my brain itch deliciously and this song is no different. The build up from the verses to the chorus is so satisfying and I'm eternally obsessed with the synth-work of this song. It's just a slay.

---

# Enjoyers of the season of love <3 which is now since Valentine's day was here <3

**duckson89** (11): : nothing else like this one

**throwaway-7650** (11): fuck the tag change (and last.fm pro)

**BasedButta** (10): this right after remember me made me think they were the second coming of kpop christ

**bookthieving** (10): the best iteration of oh my girl's signature magical/wistful sound. the synths and percussion give the song a more modern and fresh edge, while the vocal melodies and strings make it feel even more grand and timeless.

**brpr425** (10): I feel like I'm transported to another world listening to this song!

**chancehugs** (10): Now this song is heavenly.

**DaBigBoi** (10): The song that got me into them, amazing. Very much like an anime opening. The double chorus was a surprise that rlly made the song dynamic. Bridge is wild too! Wish they would make more songs like this nowadays.

**en#8502** (10): this song makes me so happy you guys have no idea... it transcends me into dimensions

**fadedblue09** (10): Masterpiece

**ke1per** (10): again, great juggling of the rap and vocals

**lady\_sable** (10): those high notes...

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): I love the magical girl/fairy vibe

**notallslendermen** (10): Such a beautiful song + concept

**poemforsmallthings** (10): Magical, fairy tale-esque OMG can save us

**PSSST12** (10): I miss this kind of sound in kpop so much. The sonic landacape of this song just takes me to other places.

**RReg29** (10): Just fantastic

**rslashpoopheads** (10): This is a perfect song.

**sage** (10): SLAY SLAY FOR WERQ LGBT

**SatC1** (10): love my fairies

**seanderlust** (10): I always go back and forth on looking up translations because I have no gauge on how reliable they are but if the ones on genius are accurate then the lyrics here are honestly really pretty

**thegirlin512** (10): This is so pretty!

**welcome2thejam** (10): "Video game end credits music" energy

**whoisValensi** (10): Oh this is pretty! I think I missed this when it dropped but wow yeah they really don't do concepts like this anymore!

**BooksAndWhisky** (9.6): The orchestral double chorus knocked me the fuck out like this is hands down my favourite instrumental in kpop

**bulforster** (9.6): this is a musical epic omg

**anagalisgv** (9.5): when Hyojung's 'lalala' part comes in I ascend

**AssailantArcturus** (9.5): bora killed this in gp999 that's all

**Bryoneehhh\_** (9.5): this was such a slay for them

**Jhe116** (9.5): Excellent double chorus, but Windy Day remains that girl

**Victerade** (9.5): THEIR BEST TITLE ME THINKS! i love the gfriend buleprint

**jasannn** (9.2): the double chorus still gets me every time

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): this kind of song always gets to me. strings!

**1998tweety** (9): chorus is majestic

**bigbigbee** (9): Fun (?) fact that I learned from a Korean-speaking friend. The chorus is translated “If it’s love, you’ll know it at a glance / You can recognize it without being confused” (cr: colorcodedlyrics.com), and this is consistent with other translations I’ve seen. But in Korean, those two lines are not stated as facts, but as things that the singer has heard before, i.e.: “I’ve been told that if it’s love, you’ll know it at a glance / that you can recognize it without being confused”. As a translation nerd, I think that’s a really cool nuance; it reframes this song as someone realizing that what they’ve been told is true when they see the person they love

**flavasavavandal** (9): There is a euphoria to this song, kinda stan

**MToms** (9): GP999 exposure effect

**pornypete** (9): They were on a crazy run there for a while. This whole album is fantastic.

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Again, absolutely gorgeous song with awful rap. I hate when groups shoehorn it in.

**ggal2020** (8.5): pretty girl music

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): this is so dramatic which i like but also kinda cheap sounding at times

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): wait this is a serve

**2l82bstr8** (8): it sounds a little unenthusiastic for what I imagine it was going for (love the outfits for this though)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The chorus is a little disjointed from the rest of the song but otherwise it’s a serve.

**celladonn** (8): Omg I love that N.K. Jemisin book

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me when someone asks when my hero academia is ending

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Anime opening vibes

**GREY** (8): WHAT THE HELL BINNIE SLAYED!

**intheaftermath** (8): is the L the fifth season? what the heck does it stand for then? Lautumn?

**ivyleaf33** (8): everything about this gives me magical girl vibes and i am so here for that

**runaway3212** (8): yass

**slimboyfriend** (8): These strings are straight from the opening of a Final Fantasy game

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I think it sounds really sweet and warm!

**-chilazon-** (7.5): Reminds me of early Gfriend in a way. But it's almost too much of a good thing? Like the chorus goes a step farther than it should. Bordering on saccharine

**RaphaelArthur** (7.5): great song but not for me

**SkylarV** (7.5): A fine song, good even, just not my favorite

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): great gowns, beautiful gowns (this isnt me trying to be shady towards the song this is just my genuine reaction to the music video)

**anothertown** (7): famously mad men had the best 5th season of all time

**pig-serpent** (7): I hate saying that songs sound like anime openings, but could you blame me if I said that about this one?

**rikarikachan** (7): I think this would be a 10 if the whole song sounded like the postchorus

**rubbie** (7): Fairytale soundtrack for lonely dreamers, technically on point but leaves me cold.

**TiltControls** (7): slip sync for wyour life

**toyletpauper** (7): A bit boring, but not bad.

**waluigiest** (7): Cedar Rapids, Iowa

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.8): ooo she's catchy

**Zypker125** (6.8): Shoutout to Rayeon's and Bora's high notes of this on Girls Planet 999, they HARD carried each of their 9-member teams on their shoulders

**babadork** (6.7): I love the whispering parts, but you can tell this is corny without even turning on the English subs.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): should've ended after the 3rd season tbh

**becca** (6.5): aurrrr.

**MimisChoice9763** (6.5): I enjoy it but I wouldn't come back to it

**astrologicalangel** (6): I know this isn't the point but those sparkly blue dresses in the MV are so cute

**cuttackone** (6): cute but thats it

**dlong56655** (6): So many OMG songs blend together for me and this is one of them

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): The chorus of this has such lovely anime energy but this has always just felt half-finished for some reason?

**mimins** (6): the second half of the chorus should have only been part of the last chorus. it felt like the climax came wayy to early

**skargardin** (6): I like the hook but the rest leaves a bit to desire for me

**terrencelovescum** (6): didn't spark anything in me but +2 for the album cover.

**vaguelycatshaped** (6): Discovered through GP999, yeah it's good

ggsmackdown: #  People that love winter or something 

**prada** (5.5): it’s a song

**apatel27** (5): very J-Pop including the weird rap part and being a minute too long

**Cooler\_lin** (5): kind of forgettable but it had some highlights

**Round\_Log401** (5): Same reason. The chorus sounds good.

**akanewasright** (4.5): where the fuck did that chorus come from im

**-mczrv-** (4): less of an experience…seriously struggle to remember this song lol

**JohnnyToby** (4): Say thank you Manami (and Bora)

**sabooyah** (4): The chorus and verses sound so disjointed? Even though I like them separately I hate them together.

**wavingwolves** (10): An instant [sapphic](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/784125484166152232/944282537109364776/unknown.png) classic, sorry, I don't make the rules. Their best concept and probably best M/V too, I was instantly mesmerized by this once it dropped. It also features one of my favourite choreos by GFRIEND (which is what I say about most of their songs, since when it comes to choreo they're my favourite girl group to follow), with the [first verse](https://youtu.be/BmTZ39P9vEc) having some of my favourite formations they've have ever done and the last [chorus](https://youtu.be/BmTZ39P9vEc?t=169) being completely different from the rest too. The all black [outfits](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ce/02/b8/ce02b87b22e0f8eeff14e56b54bb53b8.jpg) and dark styling were a moment too, especially for Yerin and Yuju. All in all, some people couldn't fully get behind the wee woo ya ya ya, and I can understand that, but I find it so catchy that I'm personally down for it in any case.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): A bop! Although I’m more of a fan of their earlier songs, I think this concept change actually really suited them. I love the sultriness of both the song and the MV. I’m just not a huuuge fan of the “weeee woooo wow wow wow wow” chorus because PRISTIN did it better, amirite ladies?

---

# Eve&Eve/Adam&Adam 

**anagalisgv** (10): the first time I heard this song I thought it was just fine but then the chorus would not leave my head for DAYS!

**anothertown** (10): this shit is rockn!! wtf

**becca** (10): RIGHT GSLAY. UMJI WE LOVE YOU

**brpr425** (10): wee oh wa wa wa wa

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): this was so good for them after floproads jk i loved crossroads

**CaptainDaisyG** (10): I almost made this my ten, but I love ITZY too much. If this is a day one cut, I'll decease.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this was THEE song that got me to do a 180 on this group. absolutely mystical and ethereal and so DRAMATIC!!! we need multiple 11s

**DaBigBoi** (10): This apple’s so juicy, Yuju put her whole Yujussy into this song.

**GREY** (10): at 2:41 when yerin shouted "commie" she was talking about anyone with a 6+ loona average

**ImADudeDuh** (10): “color me, color me, color me” is this a Lizzo interpretation???

**lady\_sable** (10): this is such a cool concept

**metanoira** (10): synthpop masterpiece

**notarobot3675** (10): 2020 was gfriends year tbh

**sage** (10): their best title, an 11 contender

**SatC1** (10): the choreography, styling, vocals, EVERYTHING

**throwaway-7650** (10): do #NOT stream the walpurgis night version of apple pls

**TiltControls** (10): the beat on this has this hypnotic nature to it. why is it so good

**Victerade** (10): BANGER ALERT BANGER ALERT a very interesting song both production and concept wise i love it to death room of mirrors even better tho

**whoisValensi** (10): Oh wow okay this is amazing WTF. Ur telling me everyone me just let me sleep on GFRIEND like this what the FUCK.

**yatcho** (10): Such an unusual song (for a big company GG at least), this really grew on me. Love the coven vibe of the MV

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.8): I love the lesbian witches theme

**sarcasticsobs** (9.7): wonderful guitar and percussion on this, and of course, vocals. those notes at the end of the first part of the chorus? hell ya

**-mczrv-** (9.6): can’t believe GFRIEND outdid themselves in a matter of months…

**-chilazon-** (9.5): I didn't like this song when it first came out, but it REALLY grew on me. They slay this concept.

**BasedButta** (9.5): one of those songs that are made even better by the mv

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): This is both super cute and really cool. I really like this band! Greatest find of the rate for me.

**RaphaelArthur** (9.5): incredibly beautiful, powerful and audacious but the mixing could be better

**prada** (9.2): NOW ON TO THE GOOD MUSIC!

**1998tweety** (9): The fucking SERVE, we love evolution.

**bespectacIed** (9): I hate remembering how much I was so hyped for gfriend's pivot to a more mature sound, only for shit to hit the fan immediately

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The only thing holding this back for me is that I’m not completely on those “wah wah wahs” in the chorus.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): we love some honey crisp vocals GET IT IT’S A TYPE OF A

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Rate lore: this was going to be the interlude after “Apple Tree” was eliminated in the Neo-Soul Rate but then it ended up getting third place so I scrapped it in order to keep momentum going into the Top 2

**ke1per** (9): 'Don't Fear the Reaper' vibes

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): this was such a serve

**runaway3212** (9): YASS!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): THE BASS RIFF??? HELLO??

**waluigiest** (9): it’s almost like Allie X?

**en#8502** (8.5): i thought that this concept was rather interesting and refreshing

**2dina3dworld** (8): at some points the instrumentals and adlibs in the background get distracting, but it’s otherwise a solid song

**bulforster** (8): the slow burn of this one really makes it stand out in this rate

**chancehugs** (8): So glad they left their anime opening vibes behind. This song feels like an unorthodox hoe anthem in a good way.

**ivyleaf33** (8): god i hate hybe vocal processing so much - like goddamn, gfriend was a group that absolutely could sing, why would you do their voices dirty like that?? glorious concept change though.

**lalafairy18** (8): This song is soooo dreamy and delectable

**Round\_Log401** (8): The best title track they've ever released imo. Mv is so aesthetically pleasing, the styling is great! It's catchy.

**RReg29** (8): You're contractually obligated to do exaggerated hip swaying while listening to this one

**superr\_rad** (8): this song definitely stands out in their discography, its such a nice transition song into a more mature concept for Gfriend. Their vocals are so intriguing, it makes so much sense the album is called Song of the Sirens bc I would abandon all ships to get closer to their voices!!!

**terrencelovescum** (8): i heard the guitars in the beginning and my ears immediately perked up.

**vayyiqra** (8): god I love shuffle beats

**welcome2thejam** (8): I think this group seem like really good friends :)

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): i like that it doesn’t sound like anything else i’ve heard so far

**ebooks#5454** (7.9): doesn't sound like any other group's sound i've heard before !!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): so dramatic I thought I was watching an episode of euphoria

**rikarikachan** (7.7): Why the hell don't I like the dark synthy culty trancey 6/8 song?? I feel like I should like this better than I do. MV is 11/10 though.

**savemeaseat143** (7.7): I wouldn't mind hearing it in a playlist

**seanderlust** (7.7): while the instrumental is just okay imo, the lyrics (or at least the translation) really shine here

**SkylarV** (7.5): This would be so much better if the chorus b-section had some actual substance in the lyrical melody(or lack there of)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.3): i am enjoying the groove

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): fiona better

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): WEEWOOWAHWAHWAWA red and brown haired girl POPPED OFF

**PSSST12** (7): they tried something new and I respect that.

**sabooyah** (7): Better than the last two! Still forgettable.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): waowaowaowa

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I am begging K-pop to learn a second Biblical anecdote, NU’EST kings for their awkward David and Goliath rap

**Cooler\_lin** (6.5): feels like a fiestar song except fiestar would have done it better

**pig-serpent** (6.5): I wish this song was more built around the fast guitar playing from the intro.

**vaguelycatshaped** (6.5): I guess I could say I like it

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): This song is just so cuuute! It's an all-time favourite song of mine, I miss this kind of dreamy sound in K-pop so much. The way that they introduce Yeonjung to the group in this MV is really cute too <3

**wavingwolves** (10): A PERFECT song and my favourite song from them in this rate. I'm at least glad it managed to take the top spot, but it still saddens me to see this go before the top 10. This song, together with OH MY GIRL's Closer and Lovelyz's Ah-Choo, is a song we decided to add for considering it was too much of a misstep for not being on the first Girl Group Singles rate, which is why it was released considerably earlier than most songs. There's something so warm about this, since the first time I heard it I was so struck by how it managed to feel almost nostalgic without really missing out on the novelty this type of ethereal, magical and kind of weeb-y sound. This was also the song that introduced [Yeonjung](https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20170326/f77dfa1e2fdf057aa95f69a7da1ec849.gif) as a member after she managed to debut on I.O.I and was added to debut after their debut.

# Secret keepers 

**JsaKim** (11): GREATEST GIRL GROUP SONG OF ALL TIME

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): inject this into my veins

**agentofscranton** (10): exy's rap is better than crack actually

**akanewasright** (10): I want more songs that are half video game half disco

**bluetriangles04** (10): Secret is one of the K-Pop songs I have somehow, found myself sobbing my eyes out to when it played on shuffle. Secret is one of their best titles, and overall one of the best first comeback songs in K-Pop.

**chancehugs** (10): The opening instrumental hooked me in and never let go. What a perfect song. The MV is an absolute experience.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the climax!!!!! a moment in herstory!

**corguri** (10): close contender for 11. but fiesta slays tew hard

**CrimsonROSET** (10): if you like this your are forced to do anime opening themes i’m sorry i don’t make the rules learn to respect a culture (weeb culture) that isnt your own!

**en#8502** (10): this is #1 on the Outer Space Hot 100 actually

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m such a sucker for that chip tunes sounding synth in songs, especially when mixed with strings like this. Love the sense of adventure in this one too, anything that sounds like it’s from a magical girl anime is automatically a bop

**glitter408** (10): so good

**GREY** (10): a timeless classic. I feel bad for new kpop stans... their poor impressionable minds are being melted with their constant consumption of songs such as Sticker, Hot Sauce, Thunderous, Dun Dun, PTT etc to the point where they cant listen to actual art and enjoy it without becoming rabid and running back to abrasive songs listed above just to get their fix and calm back down

**jasannn** (10): yasss fairy space girl boss

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (10): rip the Chinese line

**mengzhongmeng** (10): euphoric! also LOVE how they used the mv to introduce yeonjung, it's so cute!

**Nixon4Prez** (10): Incredible MV, even better song

**poemforsmallthings** (10): FLAWLESS! REAL MUSIC!

**PSSST12** (10): issa cute bop i give them that

**sage** (10): wjsn have one song and its an amazing one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): im a simple gamer. i hear a song with chiptune in it, i automatically give it a 10

**Cooler\_lin** (9.7): i am biased with this song and i dont care. i married this song in another life. this song plus the mv> it was so hard to not make this the top track but i had to be honest with myself for the sake of this rate.

**2l82bstr8** (9.5): absolutely adorable and a fire rap verse

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): waiting for people to dish their secrets in the comments (not me tho I have no secrets)

**-mczrv-** (9): already amazing and the m/v made it even better

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**becca** (9): SLAYYYYYYYY

**lady\_sable** (9): i can't believe this song is 5 years old

**rikarikachan** (9): The fact that this still bops this hard 5+ years later

**rubbie** (9): Lovely melodies, they manage to turn yet another cutesy song into something pure and ageless

**welcome2thejam** (9): The goddamn chiptune video game shop music

**whoisValensi** (9): Oh that was super pleasant! Yeah I don't think I have anything/much to say beyond that.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): vocals! funk! ya can’t go wrong!

**throwaway-7650** (8.8): stream WJSN chocome - HMPH! (and WJSN THE BLACK)

**dlong56655** (8.5): It's insane that they had 12 members but Yeonjung's vocals was sorely missing in the debut

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): BOP

**RaphaelArthur** (8.5): great song, very beautiful and great vocals

**Victerade** (8.5): the whole album is very interesting production wise i rlly like it

**BooksAndWhisky** (8.4): Lush, ethereal, whimsical, dreamy, SO gorgeous

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): just a really cute bop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This sounds great but also after multiple listens I can’t really remember how it goes at all.

**brokebutter** (8): cute and fun

**skargardin** (8): bop

**vayyiqra** (8): Yes this is city pop

**-chilazon-** (7.5): Good song, didn't blow me away, but it has a nice chorus

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Really fun, but I have a feeling that they would've scored much higher from me if I didn't listen to them right after IZ*ONE and (G)-IDLE.

**intheaftermath** (7.5): would probably be higher if it wasn't in the same rate as Power Up

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Based synth palette

**Bryoneehhh\_** (7): wjsn gets better. i promise

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): somehow mixed every genre in nineties anime with wistful angel wamen

**ebooks#5454** (7): music prod wise? very bee and puppycat vibes!! i like it picasso

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I like the instrumentation with the chiptunes a lot!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.8): this is v cute

**BasedButta** (6.5): pleasant but whatever really

**cherryices** (6.5): oh this is video game music… someone tell me what game

**DaBigBoi** (6.5): I just wish the graceful, elegant production was grander and put more at the forefront.

**mimins** (6.5): good song but its giving bargain bin girls day

**TiltControls** (6.5): A little forgettable, but kind of sweet

**cuttackone** (6): its fine

**Round\_Log401** (6): Like I said, not my taste but I can see the appeal

# Dispatch 

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Gonna be honest I've been traumatized a bit by this song.

**sabooyah** (6): This sounds like it was stolen from Girl's Day's discography, justice for Girl's Day honestly.

**celladonn** (5.5): Fine but pretty forgettable. That's how I feel about most of this group's stuff.

**runaway3212** (5.5): yaurs

**SkylarV** (5.2): The better song from this album is Bebe

**apatel27** (5): pretty boring

**frogaranaman** (5): this is cute but not much else

**KoolFunk** (5): Nah, this is just not my type of music

**prada** (5): well

**fadedblue09** (4): This literally peaked with the intro

**JohnnyToby** (4): was this before yeungjung

**ke1per** (4): funky (in a bad way) rap feels out of place

**lalafairy18** (4): Its cute its groovy

**terrencelovescum** (4): meh.

**thegirlin512** (2): I don't like the intro and I don't get the rest of the song.

**Overall Average**: 7.428 **// Average Controversy:** 1.795 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/hio7ecj.png)**

**wavingwolves** (9.433): WJSN, known as Cosmic Girls as well, had a zodiac centered concept where each of the 12 girls (13 after some time, 10 after some more)with each of the girls being from a certain a zodiac sign to be able to represent it. Their company actually forged the birthdays of a few members to be able to fit the concept, and for some reason it isn't very uncommon that companies or members themselves will chose to lie about their date of birth. In any case, I think the idea of they having an official birthday and a real one is super camp information for one to have, which is why I'm including it here. They're also the one Post I.O.I group (thanks to [Yeonjung](https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/20170326/f77dfa1e2fdf057aa95f69a7da1ec849.gif)) that managed to both stay together and still find enough relevancy to have a spot on the rate. WJSN has my favourite group discography of all industry at this point in time and it deeply saddens me to see them out before we even reach Day 3. I love knowing I can play most of their work back to back without worrying about hearing something I won't like because most of their music is so consistent and deeply exciting. They have some of my favourite b-sides ever too, like the fan favourite [Pantomime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNocuufXiI) (the first song from them we [rated](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/rv96hw/ratemas_rate_reveal_day_2_you_better_watch_out/hr4hnho/)), the dreamy [You You You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8lm-6kqNZs) (which has, in fact, the title of my favourite b-side of them), the playful [Babyface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2wCxfJrMqU), the city pop influenced smash [You Got](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McmfrWlPOqo) and, of course, the infinitely quirky [Luckitty-cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFkVUdb4w5o). If you liked their titles, make sure to check out a full project from them! There's no way you won't find something not worth your time.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.000): WJSN are such a consistent group for me. Although they've misstepped a few times, most of the time I can be confident that they're going to serve quality. They've really mastered their specific style of music and I'm glad that they're steadily growing more popular! Their subunits are also amazing, HMPH! and Easy are both 11s.

**agentofscranton** (10.000): these girls should be absurdly popular and it's baffling that they aren't

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.000): definitely gonna have to check more of these girls out. between this rate and their song in ratemas theyve been 4 for 4 with me in terms of hits

**OliviaGodrigo** (9.000): their b-side catalog is almost on par with red velvet’s

**throwaway-7650** (9.000): pantomime AND SM,SY in their discography? I FUCKING STAN

**-mczrv-** (8.767): shoutout to those that suggested WJSN to fill the IZ*ONE-shaped void their discography is top tier

**bulforster** (8.500): their ratemas song was also great, can they make a bad song??

**welcome2thejam** (8.333): Solid trio of tracks, and I can't think of anything in their songs I strongly disliked

**vayyiqra** (8.000): A cool group I need to listen to more. I like Chinese pop and think it's underrated so this group being half Chinese and half Korean had me interested.

**whoisValensi** (7.667): Oh the Cosmic Girls, have always loved that name. Now if I could just stop confusing them for GWSN and vice versa lol.

**rikarikachan** (7.500): Another group I should like more than I do. I love synths and EDM/house beats. Hmm. Puzzle Moon slaps tho

**donutseer** (7.333): strong discog, and all-round talent, with some of the best b-sides, especially recently. Pantomime is an 11.

**AxymHeart** (7.333): This rate opened by eyes for this group, so thank you!

**anothertown** (7.167): famously, happy moment (2017) is my favorite kpop release of all time. but we want the subunits in the rate.

**-chilazon-** (7.167): I like their voices, but I feel like they could benefit from a bit less overcrowded song production and not all singing so high.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.167): This is one of the few GGs I've just never cared for at all but they have a good concept and they deliver on it!

**toyletpauper** (7.067): I’d say Unnatural is probably my favorite title track, otherwise they haven’t had any title tracks that have been outstanding hits to me, similar to IZ*ONE. Just good, nothing more. I do like some of their b-sides.

**bespectacIed** (7.000): we just sold nothing will never not make me laugh even though they've sold quite ok eventually lol

**knarff21** (7.000): First time hearing all of these

**ke1per** (6.500): bright and funky in a good way

**ebooks#5454** (6.000): this isn't a kpop group, its literally a group of magical witches

**sabooyah** (6.000): For a 10+ member group I feel like their voices sound way too similar.

**Tazzachar** (6.000): I low key ult EXY, she’s my favorite rapper in kpop right now, something about her style is so cool

**SkylarV** (5.233): The albums these songs are from all have b-sides that are better than the titles, which is kind of a WJSN thing IMO

**fadedblue09** (5.167): I only know this group because of some of their faking their birthdays to match their zodiac concept

**dekubaku** (5.000): Fairly okay-ish group but their Chocome subunit is soooo good!

**Round\_Log401** (4.667): Personally not my taste but I think they are really unique in & out of kpop.

**anzunagi** (4.667): I also tend to not gel with WJSN outside of unnatural, happy, and boogie up

**lalafairy18** (4.000): Can we talk about how WJSN never miss with their album covers

**mssone1993** (4.000): I feel like WJSN's recent songs are much better than these. If only Unnatural is included here I would rate that song as 9 but other WJSN songs are misses for me. I only liked Save Me, Save You due to their performance at MAMA.

**wavingwolves** (10): Finding out this was in fact a song initially written about God makes a lot of sense in hindsight, I can't believe I never caught up on it before, but it's kinda funny. Weirdly enough, the thing about the CLOSER [performance](https://youtu.be/QQLPFsgrWvY) is that when seen from above it features the formation of different zodiac signs, which are usually aligned with "Paganism" by christians. I don't know exactly what led to this artistic decision, but I'm grateful, it is nice to look it from above, even though this isn't usually how choreos are seen. In any case, the dance looks good from any angle, with a lot of elegant, smooth and swift movements to follow such a delicate timeless song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): CLOSER…I’M CLOSER…I’M CLOSER…I’M CLOSER. They truly went off with this one, it’s so ethereal and transcendent. Shoutout to Mimi for serving with her rap here too. I’m glad this song has been receiving some attention in recent times and has kinda become a GG cult classic.

# Stole a mattress from their roommate back in Boulder

**bigbigbee** (11): Such a special song! The person who wrote this (Laura Brian) hasn't written much else, I think, which is a pity. This feels like Oh My Girl’s signature song, to me; they have similar ones, but this one is the original and the one I always come back to. I really like when groups are able to establish a clear niche, and while I definitely don’t hate their new songs, I really hope that they haven’t given this sound up. It’s innocent, but not cutesy; to me, it doesn’t feel like something that has to be restricted to young idols.

**-chilazon-** (10): New song to me, Ohmygod this is BEAUTIFUL

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection. The bridge is auditory edging, the lyrics are a perfect match too. And then we get the big finish with that chorus, masterfully made masturbation music by music masters. 11 contender !!

**agentofscranton** (10): the absolute pinnacle of the fairy / elegant concept

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): here's how closer can make another all stars

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Why are songs with this title always so good??

**BooksAndWhisky** (10): Christian Girl kpop giving me the goosebumps with that transcendental bridge

**bookthieving** (10): a masterclass in kpop storytelling and packaging (song + choreo + mv + lore). the song is dreamy and magical, and the lyrics describe the feeling of wishing on a star to be closer to someone. the choreo imagines the girls as those stars in the universe [coming closer together to form constellations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az2m83uBOBI). and the music video interprets the song's longing as nostalgia, a wish to be closer to your youth. it's a cult classic for a reason!

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): i’m so glad this is here because it was sooo slay and yas

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this deserved to be their breakout smash tbh

**en#8502** (10): honestly i need ethereal-sounding kpop songs back.... i miss them

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Can we make “ethereal fairy pop” a genre?

**hunnybee12** (10): kpop's jesus walks

**Jhe116** (10): They said the choreography of this iconic song forms different zodiacs signs when viewed from top: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az2m83uBOBI

**JsaKim** (10): almost the greatest girl group song of all time

**Kwcty6888** (10): tbh they’ve never topped this

**mengzhongmeng** (10): come on come on come on come... one of the best fairytale concepts

**rikarikachan** (10): this is my fucking jam

**RReg29** (10): Don't forget to watch the overhead choreo version

**runaway3212** (10): YASSSS

**SatC1** (10): can we go back to this sound

**savemeaseat143** (10): I don't really listen to OH MY GIRL but I love this song so much

**throwaway-7650** (10): #ENDED the chainsmokers (never started actually)

**TiltControls** (10): wait I thought closer was an all stars thing. ah well. anything called Closer it's getting a 10 from me

**ulalka** (10): I would give this an eleven too if I could

**whoisValensi** (10): Can you imagine having a song this good in your discog? And it being your first comeback after debut? PHEW. What a fucking track. Have honestly loved it since I heard it back in 2016 cause wow. [Also sidenote, check out this overhead view of the choreo, they form the zodiac signs!](https://youtu.be/QQLPFsgrWvY)

**thedoctordances1940** (9.8): incredible

**2l82bstr8** (9.7): a little overrated but people have overrated much worse songs much more intensely so ¯_(ツ)_/¯

**-mczrv-** (9.5): a beautiful experience

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.5): literally magical. The rap part was unnecessary for me though

**MimisChoice9763** (9.5): it encapsules that fairytale feel like no other Kpop song

**universemates** (9.5): I've never been the same since I found out the song was originally about being closer to God. Christian pop you win this round.

**toyletpauper** (9.3): Super ethereal and produced amazingly. A favorite for sure.

**apatel27** (9): Good but reminds me of a UK hit but can't put my finger on it.

**DraculaWeekend** (9): This was so pretty but why are they giving me 2nd gen vibes

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (9): Their OG song for me

**lady\_sable** (9): this is so dreamy

**pig-serpent** (9): Excellent Sultry Synthwave song.

**poemforsmallthings** (9): best Mimi rap verse ever maybe

**PSSST12** (9): almost a perfect song just ruined by the rap.

**skargardin** (9): the hook >>>>>

**thegirlin512** (9): This one is pretty in an ethereal sort of way.

**2dina3dworld** (8.8): Chainsmokers outsold, Chainsmokers flop, Closer stale topic

**babadork** (8.7): It took some time to decide how to rate this. It starts out a little bland, but it is amazing for 30 seconds in the middle.

**Cooler\_lin** (8.5): my ex (secret by wjsn broke us up when she dropped) it is very mystical, fairytale sounding without being forgettable. the vocal ad libs with the rap verse towards the end>

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): I really like this, but the unnecessary "generic kpop rap girl" verse was very weak. Could've been an eleven contender if it just left it out.

**ke1per** (8.5): rap placement is fantastic

**seanderlust** (8.5): that part where we get the muffled "I promise I won't walk away" like that one spoken part of oops I did it again

**sarcasticsobs** (8.1): oooh, cute

**akanewasright** (8): in a ranking of all songs called closer, I’d put this somewhere between the Chainsmokers and nine inch nails.

**anothertown** (8): now this is cute..

**BasedButta** (8): pretty good religious sounding song

**kaguraa** (8): Iconic

**maskchachki** (8): never heard this before but it slays.

**RaphaelArthur** (8): very beautiful and reminiscent of 2nd gen

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Honestly r/kpop losing its mind over the choreo formations being zodiac signs from above will never not be funny because it just looks weird from the front which is how you view choreo. Anyways this song is a banger but also wildly overrated considering how amazing OMG's discography is.

**rubbie** (8): Perhaps it's because the other songs so far were all more recent, but this stands out, sounds like a lost classic from around 2008. There's a bit of a timeless feel there, which I find quite arresting.

**superr\_rad** (8): this is my first time hearing this song and i love how ethereal it is!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the vibes on this one are immaculate

**terrencelovescum** (8): beautiful vocals and melodies.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Very ethereal and calming to listen to

**Victerade** (8): it aged kinda bad but still slays

**anagalisgv** (7.5): this was originally a contemporary Christian song and it shows

ggsmackdown: **ggal2020** (7.5): one day I’m going to get gay married to mimi from oh my girl no I’m not delusional why would you say that

**hikkaru** (7.5): insert chainsmokers joke

**mimins** (7.5): I love the vibes in this one but it got a little repetitive by the end

**vaguelycatshaped** (7.5): Got recommended this song recently and damn the person was right this song is pretty good

**sage** (7.1): i used to think this was painfully mid but its slowly growing on me..

**anarkyah** (7): Pleasant surprise!

**chancehugs** (7): Contrary to popular opinion I thought this song was just good. Not heavenly, although the girls try the best to sound that way.

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (7): so pure i started peeing holy water

**dlong56655** (7): this is good but not as good as some people make it out to be

**flavasavavandal** (7): ~~this song is really nice and pleasant but it doesn’t really elevate itself that much~~ manifesting The Chainsmokers’ song being played as the interlude

**ignitethephoenix** (7): kind of boring but not bad

**lalafairy18** (7): I really liked the rap in the bridge

**Zypker125** (7): Gets too repetitive and droning at parts. Nice vocals and instrumentals though.

**bulforster** (6.8): this is nice enough but it doesn't really go anywhere

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): im crying, she crew too, we both crode

**ivyleaf33** (6.5): but the bridge still gives me shivers every time

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): aww this is cute and simple

# Was the roommate 

**CrimsonROSET** (6): it’s giving dcom

**TragicKingdom1** (6): hey

**ChickyDipper** (5.5): pretty but it doesn't really stand out

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I just watched the video after listening to this song like 5 times--are all of these girls 12??

**cuttackone** (5): didnt care to much about it

**frogaranaman** (5): just cum already then ?????

**GREY** (5): good lord it doesnt end.. ive heard 20 minute songs that feel shorter than this

**intheaftermath** (5): just not as exciting as a lot of other songs here

**jasannn** (5): i was so ready to stan this song after i heard r/kpop stanned…

**LesApfels** (5): Listening to this made me sleepy

**nt96** (5): Social distance sweaty

**Round\_Log401** (5): Innocent concepts are probably my least fave BUT I do respect it. The chorus & the part where they go 'closer, I'm closer' has a nice sound to it, not bad but wouldn't listen to it.

**sabooyah** (5): Cute I guess, but boring. The ending is kinda nice.

**DaBigBoi** (4): I never rlly understood the massive hype around the song, even when I was a bigger fan of OMG. I liked it more then too, it’s kind of grown off.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): boring but the last rap gives it an extra point

**SkylarV** (3): Does not engage me, really weak hook

**alwayswords** (2): zzzzz

**ebooks#5454** (2): are we closer to the end of this

**RandomHypnotica** (2): so SO many other closer's outsold

ggsmackdown: # OH MY GIRL

---

**Overall Average**: 7.398 **// Average Controversy:** 1.960 **// [Rank Graph](https://i.imgur.com/Uno11oD.png)**

---

**wavingwolves** (8.225): A group we decided to highlight both because of their recent success in South Korea with Nonstop and Dolphin and because they were undeservingly missing from the previous Girl Group Singles rate line-up, which is why we have a 2015 song here to make up for it. They came quite far, missing out Day 3 just by a bit, but hopefully gaining some new enjoyers along the way!

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.000): I have mixed feelings on OH MY GIRL. On one hand, I’m pleased they’re finally getting the success they deserve. On the other hand, I just miss their earlier style of music so much!! I feel like they really nailed that particular style of quirky pop music and I just want that music back, especially because no one else is doing it. Like, Windy Day really is the eternal 11. One day I’ll find a way to rate it.

**mary (ricki’s sister)** (9.875): MC Arin I miss you everyday

**-chilazon-** (9.250): I knew I liked them, but I didn't know I LOVED them! Gotta check out more!

**knarff21** (9.000): First time hearing all of these besides Dolphin

**throwaway-7650** (9.000): dun dun dance was cute but we need their SSFWLs back

**whoisValensi** (8.875): I won't lie, I miss the old OMG. While their new stuff is alright, their backlog to like debut thru to Coloring Book (minus A-ing tho never liked that one) is so so so solid to me. I will say, finding out SSFWL was from 2019 shocked the hell out of me tho because you genuinely don't see concepts like that anymore and even tho it's 2022, 2019 is like still so "recent" to me.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.875): Queens of never releasing a bad song! [Furiously erasing their PORORO collabs]

**pig-serpent** (8.750): Normie Music (Complementary)

**dekubaku** (8.750): Super-underrated, especially on Reddit. A great group with a very strong discography. Check out Dear Oh My Girl!

**rikarikachan** (8.750): I cannot believe the group that just released Shark also released Closer and Dolphin

**ke1per** (8.500): surprisingly incorporates the raps better than anyone so far

**runaway3212** (8.500): Oh My Girls's music is all like so nice, even for the songs I dislike, it feels like stepping into a warm bath

**MToms** (8.125): they show up more often on my spotify mixes

**sarcasticsobs** (8.075): where is “dun dun dance”?!?!

**brpr425** (7.750): They have some great songs. I'm excited that they've been getting more and more recognition!

**fadedblue09** (7.125): Wished Secret Garden was here too

**welcome2thejam** (6.750): Mixed bag, I guess. Two mildly okay songs that felt kinda weak and unmemorable, but also a super fun track and a dope sweeping epic.

**bespectacIed** (6.750): mid

**ChickyDipper** (6.625): Justice for Dun Dun Dance AKA their best song!!!

**apatel27** (6.625): Cut out the rap parts and they'd be pretty good

**toyletpauper** (6.575): Not a fan of their newer songs; much prefer their older stuff like Coloring Book, Windy Day, Secret Garden, etc… Though, I don’t think their new stuff is horrible; just a bit boring, especially compared to their older stuff.

**vayyiqra** (6.500): Idk anything about this group and have no comments on them. They're alright though. Very 2010s sound with the trop-pop influences.

**yatcho** (6.325): they're cute but almost none of their stuff does it for me sorry to say

**reiichitanaka** (6.250): Mimi should definitely get more praise for her rap skills because they definitely add something to these songs

**sublimeMusic** (5.750): I loved their first few title tracks and then they kind of fell off

**ebooks#5454** (4.875): the evolution of this group thru 4 songs alone?? nuts

**cremeebrulee** (4.525): i’m not sure why, but this group’s songs just did not hit for me … it felt a little stagnant all the way through

**mssone1993** (3.875): For Oh My Girl, I am not a fan of their overall concept. It feels pretty bland for me although I personally like some of the members especially Arin but I just could not get into their songs at all. Their latest song (i.e. Dun Dun Dance) was an improvement at least, and NonStop was listenable so I can rate it as 5 at least.

**sabooyah** (3.000): I promise I do not hate Oh My Girl their music is just. Not For Me.

**wavingwolves** (10): I'm sorry, but if the music is THIS good I will choose to separate the art from the artist this time around. This is my second most listened song in the rate and since it was released all the way back in 2018 I get completely addicted to it at least once a year. There's such a magnetism to this and the best way I can describe the chorus is EUPHORIC. The synths are out of the world and the song is so quirky and charming, I literally can't find any faults in this and it did deserve at minimum a place in the top 15 and it maddens me it missed it by this little. Well, April, better luck next time! Maybe someone will draft a rate around artists that end up having Bullying controversies in 2021 and you'll finally find a way to get a top spot. I'll be cheering you on.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): A gay cult classic similar to LOVE BOMB, this song juuust misses day 3. I don't LOVE it but I can definitely acknowledge its greatness. Sad how APRIL were on the path to success (not with this song though, RIP) but then, err...that happened...

---

# Bullying supporters 

**AliFlowMoo** (11): the last 4 notes are absolutely necessary to get out of the craziness of this song

**ke1per** (11): what is there say that April has not already said? She is the moment. There isn't a part of this song I don't love. The bridge is a standout.

**mengzhongmeng** (11): this is it, this is IT! the beat, the vocals, the lyrics, the energy this song has makes me feel a bit insane. THE perfect pop song

**nvtoph** (11): SOTY don't @ me

**-chilazon-** (10): What a masterpiece. What a shame.

**-mczrv-** (10): almost too good

**agentofscranton** (10): a very reluctant 10 considering a lot of the evidence seems to point to these girls (bar rachel and chaekyung) being horrid people but a bop's a bop - just wish it wasn't made by them

**AssailantArcturus** (10): okay yes fuck four of these girls BUT this song is amazing

**bespectacIed** (10): whew we know this group crashed and burned for good reason but I cannot make this song not bop :/ So so good. Oh My Mistake is a fitting memoir title for the bullies

**billie\_\_** (10): this was my most played song ever on last.fm 3 only months after it came out. slightly sinister synth pop is the only thing i ever want to listen to, thanks.

**Bryoneehhh\_** (10): they were the retro trendsetters. too bad nobody payed attention

**chancehugs** (10): I usually hate cute songs, so the fact that I'm ok singing along to this song in a cute voice should tell you how much I love it.

**Cooler\_lin** (10): another classic in my books, the bridge for this one gave love bomb a run for her money

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I've known this song for like 2 years and it's absolute sweet perfection

**en#8502** (10): overrated. stream LALALILALA

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song is such a banger but I’m tired of people just ignoring all of the fantastic music APRIL put out before it… “The Blue Bird” is one of my favorite Kpop songs and they have other bangers like “April Story” and “Tinkerbell.” That said I also kinda get it because they pandered hard to the p*do crowd with those (like WAY more than a lot of other “innocent” concept groups) but like the songs slapped.

**GREY** (10): april having yas slay discog and turning out to be thieves, cheaters, tax evaders, and bullies is proof we cant have anything nice

**hunnybee12** (10): oh april...

**Jhe116** (10): The whole album The Ruby is bubblegum pop essence. Also their album Prelude and the title track April Story (along with the mv) are MASTERPIECE. It’s such a shame that there are 4 bullies in this group, and I feel so bad for Rachel and Chaekyung

**JohnnyToby** (10): this has to make it to day 3 somehow

**PSSST12** (10): Damn april is trash as a group but this is a gem 🥴🥴

**rikarikachan** (10): Fucking masterpiece

**rubbie** (10): i swear i gasped out loud when the chorus started, which doesn't happen often; that melody is insane

**sage** (10): me thinking this wasnt that good Oh! My Mistake

**Stryxen** (10): we should re-platform bullies if they can serve like this

**sublimeMusic** (10): there is a mashup with girl front on youtube that is my favorite thing ever

**yatcho** (10): Pure bubblegum excellence, this song is like an exquisite dessert its so sweet but excellently balanced to not drown you in it. Perfect sound for a more innocent group like April

**BooksAndWhisky** (9.8): Could’ve just sat in your corner making cult status bops like this but no y’all had to bully someone and end your career

**throwaway-7650** (9.6): the chorus synths are the pinnacle of music tbh

**dlong56655** (9.5): Bullying queens

**ggal2020** (9.5): rip queens you deserved so much better

**Zypker125** (9.4): I wonder how many "group bad/bullies" jokes we're going to see in the comments.

**1998tweety** (9): sophisticated mature bop

**flappybirdisdeadasf** (9): Addicting

**jasannn** (9): ty for that r/kpop comment on the apink %% mv thread for showing me this song

**KoolFunk** (9): uhh, this is catchy

**prada** (9): didn’t deserve the disband

**sabooyah** (9): The best straightforward no frills mid-tempo bop.

**vaguelycatshaped** (9): An outlier considering my usual tastes but it just has something magnetic

**welcome2thejam** (9): Dope production, and they sell the attitude well

**savemeaseat143** (8.9): something to bop your head to

**akanewasright** (8.5): so… in case you missed it, due to complicated reasons, a shit ton of kpop songs were taken off Spotify for a few weeks last year. Except we didn’t know if they would be back. And in that time I remember my good friend Ricki, cohost of this rate, trying and failing to set a reminder to pirate this song for his local files, but the bot seeing “April” and setting the reminder for the month instead of the half hour he asked for. Anyway this song is nice

**anothertown** (8.5): rip.. i liked love clock

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): cute!

**BasedButta** (8.5): really love how it keeps adding more layers to the chorus

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): It’s okay, ladies!

**ChickyDipper** (8.5): so toxic and yet so good

**2l82bstr8** (8): overrated tbh

**AxymHeart** (8): Surprised at how much I like this song!

**Creative\_Ad\_5792** (8): retro without the retro huhu but plus pts for mean girls inspired phone scene

**CrimsonROSET** (8): maybe rickiyola spilled

**DefaultPophead** (8): I really hope this isn't one of the first to go out. I have day one vibes from this, and that makes me really sad.

**mimins** (8): a classic!

**nosnoop** (8): Not a fan of APRIL until I experienced their amazing VR music videos

**RaphaelArthur** (8): great song, super catchy and beautiful

**thGnerd** (8): Underrated song by an unfortunately dead group

**vayyiqra** (8): This intro made me think of Sarah Bonito lol

**Victerade** (8): fun but very plain and forgettable at the same time

**bulforster** (7.9): cute!

**celladonn** (7.5): When I saw the title I thought this was the "Oh my gun is up your bussy" song but that's Oopsie My Bad by Nature

**ivyleaf33** (7.5): the ad-libs in the last chorus are everythingg

**notallslendermen** (7.5): Great song but it's kind of tough to listen to after their scandal :/

**babadork** (7.4): I really like most of the song that isn’t them saying the title.

**Awkward\_King** (7): im on a cloud

**runaway3212** (7): yas

**terrencelovescum** (7): love the prechorus but the chorus is missing something idk

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Good but also a bit basic

ChickyDipper: Thinking about it Aisha had a bullying scandal too that was never cleared up and Everglow still have a track in it. Maybe bullies *do* win

Kinda makes me laugh though that as far as I know Irene is the only one who apologized and got that apology publicly approved by her victim even if her fans are still being pissy about it

ChickyDipper: Dreamcatcher are the only group with nothing knocked out so far right? Go go go my broke irrelevant queens 🥰

There were some **wrong** eliminations today ~~(like Lovesick Girls going so early you whores)~~ but my 11 is still in play and so are 3 of the other songs I was very close to choosing.

My money is still on Psycho to take the crown 👑

bespectacIed: What a mess...

gugudone, izg\*one (i prefer priz\*one but it's more fitting). wemeking no money. even jailpril. ALL DESERVED BETTER

we just sold nothing had a good run. 

I didn't know oh mid girl had this much shooters? came out of the woodwork lmao

fraudmis_9 still hanging with one of the best songs ever and representing the nugus. We love to see it!


The main events are rightfully intact though. Day 3 will be a bloodbath there will be hurt feelings for sure (including mine) and i can't wait

vivianlight: I may be the only one bloody happy for Dreamcatcher lol I'm sorry but they are queens and Deja Vu (especially) is one of the quintessential kpop songs imho. 

Anyway my results to the poll about most robbed/not robbed songs is an error lol I think wrongly voted for Mago to be here to Day3 wrongfully despite it having my 10 lol. Errors when you vote without checking twice to have selected right. 

I voted for most robbed song for Egotistic! But Closer and Time For the Moon Night were there and same for I Love You (EXID). All robbed. All 10 for me lol.
