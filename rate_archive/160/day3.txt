---

**akanewasright** (10): One of Cardi‚Äôs big strengths as a performer is her raw likeability, and this song doubles and triples down on that. Serving as the Cardi origin story, she finds a way to spin her story, already pretty well known, into gold. Like she‚Äôs talking through all of this and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôd watch the shit out of this movie.‚Äù And it ain‚Äôt half bad as a song either, full of Cardi‚Äôs signature one liners and charismatic delivery. It‚Äôs entirely unsurprising to me that this is Cardi‚Äôs top deep cut, beating out several singles, but I am pleasantly surprised this made day 3, even if its just the first cut of the day.

**cremeebrulee** (10): I‚Äôve always adored these sort of autobiographical, confessional songs, so ‚ÄúGet Up 10‚Äù was always an early favorite from IOP. Cardi‚Äôs storytelling skills here are absolutely captivating and the delayed chorus feels extra rewarding by the time it comes in. Also I‚Äôm not sure why the title has confused people; my assumption was always that she counted the first time she ‚Äúgot up‚Äù prior to being knocked down as one of the 10, which is how it adds up. Regardless even without the number in the title, my score would have easily stayed the same.

---

## **Yeah**

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the people who comments ‚Äúget up [score]‚Äù are inventing comedy before our eyes

## **ü•Å**

**1998tweety** (10): More like Get Up 11. she did NOT have to go off that hard

**IIIHenryIII** (8): more to get up 8

**plastichaxan** (7.5): More like Get Up 7.5 hahahaha

**prettybirbkotori** (6): more like get up 6 (its fine idk i dont love the flow at the start)


## **We gon win**

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Never would I have expected a power ballad from Cardi B. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a power ballad but still.

**amr** (10): kinda sad she didn't reference "a hoe never gets cold" in this autobiography of a song but it's ok

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is what they say to me when i fall over

**bogo** (10): yeah haha i gave it a 10 and it's called get up 10 but this song is actually really good, it's the only song on here where you really get to hear cardi get personal and she sounds hungry as hell and it's super awesome. really wish there were more songs on this album like this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): HOLD UP WAIT A MINUTE, Y‚ÄôALL THOUGHT I WAS FINISHED?!?!?

**fadedblue09** (10): a powerful intro to the album, definitely feels like a statement. wish the rest of the album followed this

**jay** (10): yuppppp

**nt96** (10): the score's right there

**runaway3212** (10): yeah she spilled

**seanderlust** (10): "real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs" is such a hard line tbh

**throwaway-7650** (10): insanely strong album opener, wasn't expecting this from cardi

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Slay (sorry I just finished the drag rate idk how to speak like a normal person anymore)

**WaneDriptoc** (10): that's right cardi b. like i feel like in im a hypereal video game simulation with that horn and this narration; but it all tracks and this broad be speaking her mind and going full hog in real time. i love this so much i like almost cry when the horn comes in. just rawly so "fuck it we'll do it live". the stakes are so high and we're getting up.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh, I just know the student athletes went crazy for this one

**BaconShoes** (9): fantastic introduction to the album

**noavocadoshere** (9): unexpected chills only a minute in. strong opener. for better or worse, cardi's right that she's never been a fraud in her mf life. that transition + second half? whew. i can already tell this album launched a thousand IG captions.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): a perfect introduction to the Cardi B lore

**UselessTacooo** (9): she wishes it was a 10 :pointing_laughing:

**sydschoon** (8.9): fucking BANGER

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): It‚Äôs not my favorite song on the album but it‚Äôs 100% the best pick for the intro track.

**flava** (8.5): question for the culture. Now that Cardi B, Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion have had a rate where they claim to ‚Äúget up‚Äù or ‚Äúwin‚Äù every (or more) time they get knocked down (an empty mathematically impossible flex, Cardi). where are the rates with rap girls who don‚Äôt get up every time they get knocked down, or don‚Äôt win every bet, maybe only 5 out of 6 instead of 10 out of 9. For the depressed gals who can‚Äôt get out of bed until its past 10am.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): definitely her hardest song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): oh wow a number in the title i wonder what kind of imaginative comments there will be here

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): introspective rap rate omg‚Ä¶

**gt\_official09** (8): that beat switch was a bit insane

**MassiveThief** (8): awesome intro. feels like a huge thesis statement

**slimboyfriend** (8): idc if she didn‚Äôt write a single word on this album because she spits like she did

**Stryxen** (8): Fun! Ate! YASS!

**shipperondeck** (7.9): i won't playlist but it's a good intro

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): One of the Dreams and Nightmares-alikes that comes closest to recapturing the energy

**Bordersz** (7.5): The Meek Mill sample is everything. Only downside is it is 1 minute too long like damn.

**starla\_** (7.5): this works really well as an opener and an introduction to Cardi for the listener who doesn't know her story. also "only thing fake is the boobs" is a top tier line

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre winning this one

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): ‚Ä¶ it was very tempting to give this a 10 just for the joke

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it's a good opener and encapsulates the energy of the album v well

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i get knocked down but i get up again you‚Äôre never gonna knock me down

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): she‚Äôs too ratchet but where‚Äôs clank

**TiltControls** (7): cardi trying to manifest scores here i see

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6.5): cardi intimidates me but in a good way. Her flow is good but production is boring me idk

## **Probably knocked Cardi down one of those 9 times**

**frogaranaman** (5): nice try Cardi B! you won‚Äôt bait me into giving a score to this song based off the song title with this one

**Roxieloxie** (5): I remember I heard this song on the radio once and I was like ‚Äúoh I guess this is why I‚Äôve never heard this song before‚Äù

**camerinian** (4): don't ask me why I thought of Macklemore's The Heist album. We all had phases ok

**oscarbrierley1** (4): the sibilance on this is so bad, every time she say bitches it sounds so garbage (she says bitches a lot). Also "the only thing fake is the boobs". If You say so Cardi.

**vayyiqra** (3): Unfortunately not a 10 (original joke surely)

**akanewasright** (10): GOD this song was so fucking robbed. This was my alternate 11, and I wish everyone ‚Äúgot‚Äù this song like I do. I fully and completely understand hearing the glitchy production and being turned off, but GOD I think this is such a fantastic direction for Megan. This is the only Megan song I could describe as ‚Äúhyperpop‚Äù, and like‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt lie I want more. She absolutely DEVOURS her verse, as does Young Thug. I know his distinctive style is divisive, but MAN he works so well here.

**cremeebrulee** (10): we need the hyperhip-hop album NOW MEGAN!!! what a fucking moment this dropping was! I was so amped to see Megan take on a riskier sound and then absolutely kill it. Young Thug also has one of the best guest verses in the rate, I‚Äôm so so glad this managed to slip into Day 3 last minute.

---

## **Mm, mm just like that**

**1998tweety** (11): they mothered

**BaconShoes** (11): this song is bonkers and I absolutely adore it. Megan‚Äôs hyperpop-adjacent moment

**Hulnia** (11): young thug you will always be famous ‚ù§Ô∏è

**plastichaxan** (11): This does make me pop that cat what can I say

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I didn‚Äôt like her single choices but this still went off.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Listening to this in the rate playlist makes me like it even more than I did already. It‚Äôs like the last stand of good taste.

**camerinian** (10): w + ratio + hyperpop synth + thugga verse better

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i need meg to do more songs with this type of beat this is easily one of her best ever songs

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): need the A.G. Cook remix to this

**frogaranaman** (10): they got the Skrillexussy on the beat

**gt\_official09** (10): love industrail hip hop

**hikk** (10): WE WANT THE INDUSTRIAL HIPHOP ALBUM!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): if you don‚Äôt like this then you aren‚Äôt galaxy brained enough

**jay** (10): yuppppp

**RandomHypnotica** (10): miss you cohostie </3

**ricki** (10): please win

**Roxieloxie** (10): im joking myself back from being h word on main Megan pleas return my calls I‚Äôm begging

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this gets an extra point for the cheshire cat costume in the video

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the beat and music video are kinda perfect huh

**WaneDriptoc** (10): she wore fucking latex for the video because she knew she had a rubbery-ass beat. but it's jeffrey...my boy jeffrey...who's clenching the ten here. any time that man is featured im gonna give an auto 10 because #freeyoungthug. FUCK bullshit rico charges. FUCK american law trying to incarcerate him on horseshit. it truly does make me sick to my stomach. he straight up up'd the standard for flow and delivery in the 2010s. he made fucking jeffrey and gave like a huge whiff of that energy to this cut. which imo, is somehow the best cut on the album! insane it was left for last! im the only person who feels this here prolly! i dont' care im getting baked and listening to jeffrey and putting on a dress.

**Awkward\_King** (9): i am sorry i will die on the hill that the intro to this is just a harder no pude by lido pimienta https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaY5N1g2ZEk

**runaway3212** (9): this random skrillex beat

**shipperondeck** (9): why did i think this was way earlier in the album?? anyway thugger ate as he does

**UselessTacooo** (9): This production is so good wtf

**prettybirbkotori** (8.5): god i wish she had gotten rico for this one

**DirtyRat583** (8.1): omggggg sophie i didnt know you were on this üòç

**Bordersz** (8): Production is top tier and unique.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): thugger's features getting a 0 streak: OVER

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): I like my share of thug songs but his verse being in the middle really drags down a great meg performance for me on this one

**sydschoon** (7.4): I personally thing young thug does a lot of damage to this track...in a bad way

**bogo** (7): we need megan to hit up a.g. cook stat


## **Please stop**

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I don‚Äôt really listen to Thugger does he always sound like this

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why phrase it like ‚Äòpop the cat‚Äô also why not just fit the singles in the album outside is a nice closer

**fadedblue09** (6): well that was disappointing

**IIIHenryIII** (5): what a lackluster closer

**oscarbrierley1** (5): is this hyperpop? jk it seems to go one forever and is so repetitive.

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): i'm so tired of her saying real hot girl shit

**nt96** (4): "cream that pussy like mayo" EW

**flava** (2): this is second rate featuring Doja Cat in 2022 that Young Thug has shown up in and coincidentally it also the 2nd time i tank him

**noavocadoshere** (2): if this album had ended on outside, i would've been happier than i am now. absolutely killer production here but good news definitely could've done with some trimming.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this sounds fucking bad

**starla\_** (0): I really can't stand Young Thug

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): Doja's music is always at its best when its unrestrained and goofy like this, like these lines are so silly (trying to imagine Doja's parents going through her at phone at age 24 sends me) but the chorus is genuinely really alluring. It's such a good balance of who Doja is personally and makes for a great opener to this album, even when its a less serious than the other two album's. 

**akanewasright** (8): This is one of the true quintessential ‚ÄúDoja Cat‚Äù songs to me - something goofy, a little unhinged, and straddling pop and rap. This song is a weird balance of ‚Äúpolished Doja‚Äù and ‚Äúunpolished Doja‚Äù, which means it‚Äôs not one of the Doja songs I come back to as frequently as some others on both sides of the spectrum, but it‚Äôs a great opener and a definitive song for her.

## **rip bktidalwave  ü´∂üèΩ**

**DaHumanTorch** (11): thoughts on doja cat? she's trash i'm not talkin about that girl

**amr** (10): queen of brooklyn bktidalwave deserves a posthumous nobel peace prize for singing OHHHHHHHHHH WHATA  TIME TO BE ALIVE. LIVING IN THE FUTURE BLINGING ON MY HOT. LINE. on ig live every 10 seconds before the lockdowns like I U had to be there to understand the happiness that woman gave the world in very uncertain times

**jay** (10): rip bktidalwave

**pikajake** (8): OOHWHATATIMETOBEALIVE rip bktidalwave

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): thoughts on doja cat? i'm not talking about that girl ‚ô´what a time to be aliveeee, living in the future blinging on my hot line *middle finger*‚ô´

## **We're just gonna ignore that line**

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): why did you see this guy on dateline doja‚Ä¶what did he do to get on thereü§®

**ImADudeDuh** (0): so are we ignoring that this man she is singing to is canonically a murderer/predator? Nicki still managing to find her way into the rate üòç

## **Wish you here right now**

**gt\_official09** (11): she slayfully rejuvenated her lucious cunt with pussy wipes, allowing the mother ocean to slowly spill out of it and fully soak itself into her new album she then harnesses the power of the mother lake to self lubricate which she then fills with said moist pussy. it's a cycle, much like the water cycle: the mother cycle

**Stryxen** (11): for the song and the activity

**Awkward\_King** (10): the most doja cat tiktok viral pop rap song to ever doja cat tiktok viral pop rap song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Cyber Stockholm Syndrome but make it a healthy relationship.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://twitter.com/DojaCat/status/1257896926252433408

**DirtyRat583** (10): doja cat esex pioneer iktr

**fadedblue09** (10): very bright, bouncy opener

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song is probably a product of tinychat

**plastichaxan** (10): She‚Äôs just like me fr

**ricki** (10): rate reveal in omegle when

**runaway3212** (10): You're my best view u/awkward_king

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this video release was my official introduction to Doja and i fell in love

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): hits different after the chat room scandal

**UselessTacooo** (10): the fact that people don‚Äôt like this song blows my mind

**vayyiqra** (10): Weird how this song, outside the context of its lyrics, sounds kind of cute and wholesome, then the lyrics make you think it's just about [redacted], but then I've also heard an argument the lyrics are quite sad, and then that leaves me thinking about Society and the role technology plays and blahblah [thinkpiece]. Good song! "What a time to be alive" is so right. When I was a little kid we didn't have internet at home and that wasn't even 25 years ago. Now I think I've met at least half the women I've dated on the internet. Makes you think ... really makes you think. (I'm just doing a bit here it's not deep)

**BaconShoes** (9.5): a perfect mix of pop and rap, and doja has so much personality

**TiltControls** (9.5): a playful bop and great opener

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): haha get it it's funny because sh- [GUNSHOTS]

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): omegle anthem???

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this beat is so fucking good

**jasannn** (9): having bouncy ass synths really fits the title of the song

**MassiveThief** (9): this feels so perfect for doja. catchy, funny as fuck lyrics about a unique topic, and I wish this album was more up this alley

**1998tweety** (8.5): id like to

**celladonn** (8.5): This hooks in this are so good

**starla\_** (8.5): a cute bop but the mixing is super weird and it's distracting

**bogo** (8): oh so this is the "i like the view" song‚Ä¶ i'm embarrassed that I know that meme

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): showing feet

**nt96** (8): we stan a horny, chronically online queen

**prettybirbkotori** (8): i miss when this song was big but it still indeed fucks

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8): she is so weird and so fun

**seanderlust** (8): "can't scroll down cause some of them dicks" PLSSSS she gets it

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): this is like superorganism‚Äôs album but from first person and that‚Äôs what music is supposed to do I guess

**sydschoon** (7.8): loooove this song, best choice for the opening track

**camerinian** (7.5): the devastating push and pull between the first chorus being so dreamy and seductive and the second chorus unfortunately saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs break the internet‚Äù

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): I love and hate this at the same time

**hikk** (7): my cyber sex experiences have all just ended in me being rly bored :/

**isthesweetestcon** (7): is cyber sex still a thing or is doja as old as i am

**shipperondeck** (7): imaging fucking a robot

**impla77** (6.4): I think we all agree that Ralph breaks the internet was a completely unneeded sequel

## **https://twitter.com/noreaga/status/1264681543320166401**

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): its an interesting song at least, less catchy than I expected after hearing about it & that dateline bit is WEIRD but there‚Äôs something interesting

**frogaranaman** (6): are we allowed to make a chat rooms joke here

**throwaway-7650** (6): a really disappointing opener given how good the other 2 are

**noavocadoshere** (5): i fear it's no for me dawg, especially as the open. need to know's older sis that people mistake for the younger one bc she's taller and has a baby face. very chill, bubbly, the kind of song you'd comment #mood under.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The way the other two girls use their opening tracks to talk shit and be badass, meanwhile Doja does‚Ä¶ this‚Ä¶

**welcome2thejam** (5): Woah Doja, save it for next week's rate

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Doja really said ‚Äúendure this opener to hear the rest of the album.‚Äù

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): you can‚Äôt convince me that Cyber Sex is sexy. I refuse to believe that it would be anything but awkward and weirdly puritanical.

**akanewasright** (9.5): I‚Äôm a little sad to see this one go - I really love both Doja and Gucci‚Äôs verses on this track‚Ä¶ but it would appear I‚Äôm pretty much alone in the latter category. This has been a complaint since the album dropped, when Doja blurred out the name of this feature, leading to pop stans getting their hopes up for a collab from someone like Nicki, but I really think Gucci slayed his verse and was the perfect fit to continue Doja‚Äôs energy on this song. iI get why this missed the top 10, but it could‚Äôve stuck around and I‚Äôd be happy.

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): This one has always been a cute little bop to me, maybe a little outshined by some of the other singles on the album. But I'm always reminded of how pleasantly charming it is when it comes on. Also Doja splitting to the beat in the MV is something I think about way more often than a normal person should.

---

## **I like it like that, I like it like that**

**DirtyRat583** (11): i Amn just........... a funky litle song. Thatse It . I Canot change this

**oscarbrierley1** (11): so bouncy and fun. I probably love it the most because it didn't become a huge hit, so it didn't get overplayed.

**1998tweety** (10): served

**BaconShoes** (10): i think it‚Äôs impossible to not twerk at least a lil when listening to this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Where is the anime content warning for this music video. An absolute megaslay of a song tho.

**ricki** (10): looking for video editors that will make velocity edits of me looking how to this song

**shipperondeck** (10): not my 11 bc this is a summer bop and it's november

**Stryxen** (10): insane front to back and even the video prolongs the slayage as long as possible into the very last beats of the outro. Changed the world

**seanderlust** (9.5): inside of me there are two wolves fighting. one of them hates dr. luke, one of them loves gucci mane

**CrimsonROSET** (9): doja has the most consistent features in this rate its not even funny

**jasannn** (9): I remember hearing this for the first time at my friend‚Äôs party at college and I really tried shazaming it while being drunk and 50 people talking in a small ass apartment.

**throwaway-7650** (9): I'm sure the solo version is a 10 just like juicy

**vayyiqra** (9): Idk why I always think this is going to be mid I like the hook a lot and Gucci isn't a guy I care for but his verse is fine I guess. This is catchy! It's fun!

**Bordersz** (8.5): It is too SHORT.

**noavocadoshere** (8.5): i'm wholeheartedly convinced that the features for our rap girls will be my least favorite parts of this listening experience.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): A man holding back yet another song it‚Äôs sad

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): Doja Cat showing her Nintendhoe roots by making a song about her Wii

**AHSWeeknd** (8): STOP WITH THAT FUCKING DOCTOR. WHY IS THIS SHIT SO GOOD.

**WaneDriptoc** (7.8): this is also pretty good booty music.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/953/499/eeb.png

**impla77** (7.5): Another solid if not particularly inventive song

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): BRRR

**frogaranaman** (7): they both ate this beat up so hard, sucks Luke is on it

**gt\_official09** (7): not my fav but still really fun

**IIIHenryIII** (7): mooo

**Roxieloxie** (7): best feature in the album. This is another one I had to hear ten million times tho

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): if this was 2020 i'd give it a 10 but i'm pretty over it now. giving it a decent score because i was obsessed at one stage.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): she knew what she was doing with that anime music video

**sydschoon** (6.9): dadadadadadats my shiiet

## **That's ~~my~~ shit**

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): say so's ugly sister

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I think she set this up by putting it next to Say So

**bogo** (6): this song grew off me a bit, good chorus but everything else is a bit weak

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): Gucci being on this album is so random, stream Lemonade (Gucci‚Äôs version) but yeah this song is a little awkward.

**prettybirbkotori** (6): i like this song but i‚Äôve never been like crazy for it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I can never decide if I totally love this song or totally hate it

**ImADudeDuh** (5): they really tried to push this while pretending streets wasn‚Äôt doing anything

**sa5m\_i\_am** (5): eh whatevs it‚Äôs a skip for me

**starla\_** (5): this has unfulfilled potential

**runaway3212** (2): this was already bad but then gucci mane's verse came in and it descended

**cremeebrulee** (5): honestly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ this should‚Äôve lost

**akanewasright** (1): Honestly this song deserved worse KLJFDSJKLDF like I think some of you guys just didn‚Äôt hear any of the lyrics. I can understand finding this song catchy/liking the production (although I found it way more annoying coming back to it after a few years), but holy hell, these lyrics are awful‚Ä¶ especially that jungle fever line. Some of these songs are saved by their features, this one just makes it worse.

**1998tweety** (10): latine gang ate

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): yes this is bad but have you considered that it's camp

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): nightmare blunt rotation

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): south of the ranking*

**MassiveThief** (6): could be WAAAYYY worse

**rotating3Dtext** (6): please. please not jungle fever

**babadork** (5.3): I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to listen to this, but it works better than I thought it would.

**DirtyRat583** (5): white boy busting it down sexual style

**Frajer** (5): Ed Sheeran should go to jail for saying caramel thighs

**jasannn** (5): these lyrics and the white-washed sound are oof but the vocal harmonies are great.

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): Ed should have kept this in the drafts of his brain ‚Ä¶ that being saying said it is catchy just extremely cringe

**indie\_fan\_** (4.5): I mean i suppose there's nothing inherently terrible about this song but also nothing good

**bogo** (4): how was ed sheeran able to release this without getting significant backlash, these lyrics are very uncomfy

**vayyiqra** (4): This is such a spectacularly ill-conceived idea. How and why does it exist; but the most baffling part is how it's somehow not as awful as it sounds, but mostly just kind of "whatever".

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): cardi's verse on this is so weirdly mixed like ?

**celladonn** (3): the jungle fever line...

**noavocadoshere** (3): i'm just sad. i want to be fair about cardi's involvement ofc but these are some of the most generic collabs to suffer through to hear cardi. at least the mv for this looked like fun for everyone involved.

**slimboyfriend** (3): Not ‚ÄúTe amo mami‚Äù....

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): never heard this song before this rate but a european friend told me he heard this song all the time and how much he hates it and uhhh yeah he was right! this is pretty bad!

**UselessTacooo** (3): hmmmmmm

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): The "guacky-molo" of pop music

**sydschoon** (2.5): i can't comprehend why Ed Sheeran and Cardi B are on a track together

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): He legally shouldn‚Äôt have been allowed to release this.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): my toxic trait is I really like ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Care‚Äù remix ft. Chronixx and Koffee but this song makes me hear what everyone else hears on this album

**prettybirbkotori** (2): zoboomafoo ass beat

**sa5m\_i\_am** (2): if I could give a double zero I would. Could music sound more generic?

**seanderlust** (2): i do not need to hear cardi telling me that ed sheeran has "jungle fever"

**Stryxen** (2): PFFFFFFFFFFFFFT

**AHSWeeknd** (1): I‚Äôm not one to hop on the Ed Sheeran hate train, but I never understood this. Like what is this.

**BaconShoes** (1): this is so‚Ä¶

**flava** (1): no i will not explain

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): ears

**ImADudeDuh** (1): living through this charting was traumatizing

**jackisboredtoday** (1): you can‚Äôt stop me from putting this as a 0 i refuse to be silenced. if this was changed to a 1 that was not my decision

**oscarbrierley1** (1): i didn't need ed sheeran to talk in spanish and try to act sexy. i'd never heard it before so i thought it was going to be a commentary on refugees or immigration, but no its a sex song.

**plastichaxan** (1): This bonus rate was specifically made to torture me wasn't it

**ricki** (1): this is just latina galway girl

**runaway3212** (1): This is beyond terrible and somehow also on every radio station in the netherlands

**shipperondeck** (1): caramel thighs???????? wait wtf this song is just fucking exoticism ed sheeran when i find you??????????????????????????????! the idea of being propositioned by ed sheeran is literally making me sick right now

**starla\_** (1): yuck

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): if I had a time machine, I'd stop this from being released before anything else

**TiltControls** (1): I'm usually an Ed defender more often than not but I cannot excuse this

**cremeebrulee** (10): This song just fucks idk what else to say!! Doja changes her flow her so seamlessly, it's easily her most impressive song off technical skills alone. The section where it just speeds up before immediately cutting to her murmuring "Do I make you horny baby?" under her breath... like damn!! It's no wonder this day never left Day 3 once we started collecting ballots.

**akanewasright** (9): God‚Ä¶ This is like *the* song to prove Doja‚Äôs prowess as a rapper. Not to regurgitate a take I‚Äôve seen from everyone from pitchfork to your local Doja stan, but she‚Äôs channeling Kendrick Larmar *hard* here and it‚Äôs fucking incredible. Literally everything about her verses - the lyrics, the delivery, the flow switches - all of it shows off her raw, easily underestimated abilities. However‚Ä¶ this may be confirmation bias, but I do think the beat feels a little stale at times. Like it‚Äôs a cool idea that drags on for too long and never feels *alive*. It‚Äôs not a real knock against this song, since Doja finds the perfect way to imbue this song with life with just her delivery, but it is something. But still, this is one of *the* Doja Cat songs for me.

## **Knows how to spend some money**

**jay** (11): YUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP.

**amr** (10): another song I first heard in an edit probably the first doja song that had me actively listening to her even if it was just this one

**Awkward\_King** (10): the HOLD this song had on me.... doja's third verse added 10 years to my life, god i thought she'd never top this and then she dropped boss bitch

**BaconShoes** (10): a total vibe, her flow is amazing, i love the lyrics, it‚Äôs just great

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Deserved to be a mega-smash ugh.

**Bordersz** (10): The 2nd verse is everything. She SNAPPED.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): maybe best opening line in this entire rate

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the hold this has on twitter when it dropped oh it's a classic

**DirtyRat583** (10): she put that pen to WORK love the lyrics here

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this is like chaotic good idk i don‚Äôt play dnd

**gt\_official09** (10): the mother cycle continues, some of her best bars are on this and probably my fav flow from her.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite songs from her, this is what got me into her music more

**oscarbrierley1** (10): a masterpiece.

**plastichaxan** (10): I too have a money kink she‚Äôs just like me fr

**shipperondeck** (10): what a cool song

**Stryxen** (10): always been my favourite doja song, her flow and the wordplay and the instrumental are all so unique and simply impressive and I know every word at this point without ever trying to learn the lyrics. I don't remember what I commented when I 11d this in up and coming rap Girls but i probably spilled so: see that

**throwaway-7650** (10): https://twitter.com/sleezyjamie/status/1578170499116728322

**UselessTacooo** (10): one don‚Äôt pick up the phone you know he‚Äôs only calling cause he‚Äôs drunk and alone

**bogo** (9.9): this deserved to be a big hit but also it kinda didn't for... reasons

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): this song is kelly approved (this song RULES)

**fadedblue09** (9): Goes hard while managing to be super catchy

**ricki** (9): maybe the thirst trap side of tiktok is good given that it made this go viral

**1998tweety** (8.5): she was in her kendrick bag with this one

**noavocadoshere** (8.5): YOU GOT A FAKE CHAIN ON CHANGE THAT. do yourself a favor if you haven't and watch the boiler room performance for this one. an absolute experience.

**TiltControls** (8.5): this rules

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): A near-perfect blend of meme song and good song

**sydschoon** (7.3): said play w my pu$$y but don't pay w my emotions

## **Plays with these scores**

**prettybirbkotori** (6.5): the song comes out swinging and then doesn‚Äôt quite live up to that promise

**frogaranaman** (6): don‚Äôt pick up the phone

**starla\_** (5.5): okay but kinda boring

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): I kinda dig her nightcoreified vocals more

**camerinian** (4.5): that chorus definitely needed a bit more time in the oven

**Roxieloxie** (3): one of the host has heard me express this many times but my rommmate freshman year pre Covid had an Alexa and she would play stuff on speaker and she became obsessed with this song and I had to hear this so many fucking times per day

**akanewasright** (10): Thank fuck this made it to the top 10 LKJDFSLJKFSD. This was an immediate favorite of mine, even though I understand why other find the ‚Äúbodyodyody‚Äù hook irritating. Hell, my initial reaction to finding out this was being pushed as a single with a video was [bafflement that they chose this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851835432886599761/1051337698138411028/Screen_Shot_2022-12-10_at_10.20.02_PM.png). But like‚Ä¶ of course it was. I tend to subscribe to the idea of ‚Äúit‚Äôs often more important to be memorable than it is to be nice or pleasing to the ears‚Äù, and this is a song that exemplifies it - it uses a truly invincibly repetitive hook as a vehicle for some of the best bars on the album. Hell, I think all three verses on the song are among the very best in the rate. This was always gonna get hated on, but thankfully, it wound up doing pretty well in the end.

**welcome2thejam** (9): I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control. I want a perfect Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody, ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody, I want a perfect soul

**sydschoon** (8.2): bodyodyodyodyodyodyody

**TiltControls** (10): the one bad thing about not being on beatsense anymore is that we can't see the screen covered by various 'odyodyodyodyodyodyody' bubbles

**camerinian** (9): my enduring memory of this song is when I used to caption TV and I did the Grammys the year Megan and Cardi performed, and when I was prepping this song I was delighted to find out that one line of "body-ody-ody-etc" fit the maximum allowed length of two lines of captions. I had to censor "titties" because it was a daytime broadcast and apparently *that* would have been the thing the rest homes objected to, but I'm glad the audience wasn't forced to get lost in a neverending stream of captions that just said "ody-ody-ody-ody". This is so niche I'm sorry

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): bodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodyodydody

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): look, ive tried, ive TRIED to get used to that bodyodyodyodyody chorus but‚Ä¶i cant do it ok it sounds terrible theres no other way to say it i hate it and it ruins ever good quality that this song otherwise has, and it certainly does it help that it feels like that chorus takes up more than half the song

## **Look at how I bodied that**

**static\_int\_husp** (11): this is kinda dumb but it is the most fun song in the rate

**1998tweety** (10): insert adele comment

**402man** (10): [don't say you love the anime if you haven't read the manga] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ2xtWgBlzk)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Lil Ju went off here, this is honestly underrated.

**amr** (10): [jay voice] YUPPPPPPPPPPP

**BaconShoes** (10): BODY CRAZY CURVY WAVY BIG TITTIES LIL WAIST

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ugh there‚Äôs nothing quite like a well executed dumb ass chorus.

**bogo** (10): this song is very 2020 (it references tiger king for crying out loud) but it slaps idc

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me when someone asks what the name of the dog in Garfield is

**DirtyRat583** (10): hm i wonder when she wrote and recorded this

**flava** (10): I mean if I looked liked Megan I would be tempted to [REDACTED] too

**frogaranaman** (10): that one 2022 film with the gay father everyone is obsessed with

**gt\_official09** (10): and she bodied it !

**ImADudeDuh** (10): you know, my original comment was gonna be ‚Äúiconic onic onic onic‚Äù without all the spaces, but I realized if I did that, it would just be ‚Äúiconiconiconiconic‚Äù which just looks like ‚Äúicon‚Äù a bunch of times in a row

**plastichaxan** (10): There is not a day of my life that goes by where I don‚Äôt think of this song

**ricki** (10): where‚Äôs the mitski collab

**runaway3212** (10): Jack Antonoff actually remixed this beat for labyrinth

**seanderlust** (10): "Real hot girl shit! Being a real hot girl is just being a person who is the life of the party, who loves to turn up, have a good time and spread positivity, and is just unapologetically them. Ah!" - the bible

**starla\_** (10): top tier gym banger

**Stryxen** (10): EASILY a song of all time I can't believe there was a time before this song existed

**throwaway-7650** (10): IF YOU'RE GONNA LET ME DOWN LET ME DOWN GENTLY DON'T P-

**vayyiqra** (10): I was told once that men hate this song; luckily for you hotties I'm not like other boys :relieved:

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): megan literally does not give us a second to breathe in the verses its fuckin hit after hit

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): my brain cells travel from my head to my booty when I listen to this song

**Bordersz** (9): Extremely catchy. Her pics really got us through the quarantine tho.

**Hulnia** (9): i‚Äôm so glad i gaslit myself into not minding the chorus omfg

**nt96** (9): hearing the mashup of this and Jump Up Superstar changed me for the better

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9): its infectious and yet I never get tired of it. Twerk anthem

**WaneDriptoc** (8.2): we're ALMOST earning those horny noises, we're ALMOST getting to windowlicker territory with this one. this is a good sign that we as a society, are on the cusp of getting out of our theoretical "long 90s" that has almost destroyed progress

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): the instrumental on this sucks‚Ä¶ Megan manages to pull it off but the instrumental is very sparse and I‚Äôm a moaning as backing vocals anti

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Alexa play *Custom Made (Give It to You)* by Lil‚Äô Kim

**noavocadoshere** (8): nom nom nom, eat it up.

**prettybirbkotori** (8): whether you like or hate this song depends entirely on the hook, and i think it goes crazy

**shipperondeck** (8): the only reason this is not a 10 is bc i cant do moaning in songs at all üò≠üò≠ i swear im not a prude it just makes me mad uncomfortable

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i didn't like this when it was released but i enjoy it now

**UselessTacooo** (8): I remember the first time I listened to this I was blasting it from my room and my mom thought I was watching porn

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Is anyone else kinda bothered by the moaning?

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): kinda annoying, kinda fun. unironically i think the moans are my favourite part.

## **~~Ate it up and~~ gave it back**

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): that hook is infectious, but in a virus kinda way not a brainworm

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): this chorus is grating but the beat and the verses are the best on the album so far‚Ä¶ sadly

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): Trinity The Tuck be like

**indie\_fan\_** (5.5): dope ass verses held back by arguably the most irritating hook on this album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I see a lot of my besties love on the song and I think I‚Äôve given this a better score in another rate. The verses are fun, but I think I have to have the boring take on ‚Äúody-ody-ody‚Äù being pretty annoying. This opinion changes all the time and I think it lands on annoying today, I‚Äôll probably regret this later, or not! My most surprising score to myself tbh

**MassiveThief** (5): the kind of song that's good for exactly 1 listen

**jay** (2): heard this on release night and thought the chorus was sooo bad, imagine my shock when that nightmare app latched onto it and gagged

**jackisboredtoday** (1): roxie implored me not to 0 this and i decided to spare it my 0 for them

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): too much body

**fadedblue09** (0): this is so mind-numbingly bad

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): I think a lot of people expected Streets to be Doja's last remaining track, but honestly I was SO sure it was going to be this even with the laundry list of baggage it has. If you read the comments, people have so much reluctance with admitting they enjoy this song and I feel pretty similarly. I definitely appreciate this song as a time capsule of pre-lockdown times‚Äî really the first thing I think about when it plays is my then roommate showing me what the Moooo! girl had been up to, during a time when I didn't know what a Dr. Luke production credit or popheads discord rates channel or coronavirus was. This sound has been done to death since, but at the time it came out, it was relatively fresh to me, so I still have the positive connotations from that time. Anyway, look at the rank graph for this one, it make me chuckle.

**akanewasright** (0): Good lord 

 So I don‚Äôt like this song anymore, and that‚Äôs largely because of the song‚Äôs impact on pop music as a whole. For one, one of it‚Äôs stalest producers has come back to produce woefully unoriginal beats for the likes of Latto and Nicki Minaj. For another‚Ä¶ ugh. 

 Disco as a genre largely evolved from funk. That is a massive part of why Disco (at its best) is one of the most lively genres we have. Or even when it doesn‚Äôt quite have funkiness, it should still have some kind of edge, or strong emotionality, or just *something* to set it apart. And this production just feels lifeless. The chorus and first verse are too lightweight to really land for me, and it all just makes me go ‚Äúbleh‚Äù. Obviously Doja‚Äôs second verse injects some life into the song, but it‚Äôs not enough to save it for me, especially considering how this song made this funkless, soulless, lifeless version of disco the default. There are loads of flop attempts to remake this song all over western pop and k-pop, and I‚Äôm just *done* with it.

## **https://twitter.com/DojaCat/status/1257896926252433408**

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): I feel like I owe several apologies for thinking this is the best song in the rate‚Ä¶ it unfortunately is my personal favourite

**pheromenos** (11): i don't even have tiktok i'm just a twink

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**BaconShoes** (10): I cannot deny the groove

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yes it‚Äôs watered down to be as palatable to the general public as possible, but luckily for her I‚Äôm basic AF!

**Bordersz** (10): The harmonies on this is heavenly. The flow is insane. The cultural impact of this song is insane. Literally everyone and their mothers jacked this sound.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): dont look

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this song ruined Western music AND k-pop but it still rocks I am so sorry

**DirtyRat583** (10): this was inescapable when it was massive so thank god it was good

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): if this doesnt make top 10 popheads you are BONES!

**gt\_official09** (10): is it overplayed? yes but i think it still holds up and when it dropped it was such a moment.

**hikk** (10): it gives unfortunately

**IIIHenryIII** (10): fuck dr. puke, also the superior version is an 11 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw_7UrqzNUg

**jasannn** (10): I haven‚Äôt visited this much since 2020 but the tik tok dance will be embedded forever in my head.

**noavocadoshere** (10): it's clear why this song became the sensation it did. listening to this, my pores are clear. my faux plants are thriving. my bank account isn't in the red. this song is pure pop perfection.

**prettybirbkotori** (10): I MEAN COME ON??

**ricki** (10): seeing doja being able to fully develop into the star i always knew she was thanks to this song has been one of the most exciting industry related things ive been able to witness

**shipperondeck** (10): a modern classic

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): nothing to say that hasn't been said

**sydschoon** (10): we all know what this song did for society

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): me turning off my morals for three minutes and fifty-nine seconds so i can vibe

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): shoutout to the German cover by Selphius, it fits surprisingly well

**throwaway-7650** (10): this was as impactful to dua's success as "go girl give us nothing!"

**UselessTacooo** (10): the best TikTok dance ever I said what I said

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes I know you're all sick of it, yes I know you're all sick of "disco" [citation needed] revival, no I don't care it's still a great song

**bogo** (9.9): there are several very good reasons for me to hate this song that i will not get into but in spite of all that i really, really like this and can see why it became such a big hit, it's really fun. still gets a petty 9.9 though

**indie\_fan\_** (9.9): My petty ass removing 0.1 with that long ass outro

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): this was the moment this kept the people fed during the pandemic, but I am also tired of this song

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Cute but Kiss Me More improves on this

**starla\_** (9.5): I need ass and titties

**Awkward\_King** (9): i remember being on the bus with my friends in the beginning of 2020 and listening to this song and them being like "you know this is a tiktok song right" and i was like what does that even mean. if i only we knew* then. (*knew how much the song would blowup and *knew what was in store for 2020)

**musical\_pyn** (9): idc that it's overplayed, this is still such a bop

**oscarbrierley1** (9): its lost a bit of its shine because it was so overplayed, but i knew when i first listened that it should be a hit.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9): love this but I wish I knew what it was about exactly. Yes im dumb but it‚Äôs fine

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): this is going to be in my head for weeks now

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I gave this a 9 the last time so I had to think, should I rate it higher? And then I heard the outro and remembered why I didn't give it a 10. It's too damn long! And boring!

**WaneDriptoc** (8.4): i think this could have fit on the 4th daft punk LP

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I love this song but I hate that physician.

**plastichaxan** (8): Giving this such a scary 8 because this would be a really bad winner but like she ATE

**TiltControls** (8): the bonus rate shouldve been adele remixes

**welcome2thejam** (8): Nah, the hard rock version still takes the spot for me

**impla77** (7.8): This song is catchy, radio friendly and takes no risks. I like it

**ImADudeDuh** (7): thinking about the nicki remix

## **https://twitter.com/DojaCat/status/1325596244916412416**

**Stryxen** (7): I have over played this a little but I also never really loved it that much in retrospect

**Roxieloxie** (6.8): sorry enough time has passed  that I haven‚Äôt heard it that I like this again

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): fine radio bait but the main impact of the song for me is this tiktok of laura dern dancing to it https://www.youtube.com/shorts/d9tqA7bgfx0

**camerinian** (6): man sometimes we are just too generous to any song with a disco beat huh

**runaway3212** (5.5): I've heard this wayyyy too much despite streaming it myself like 3 times

**RandomHypnotica** (5): stream skylar spence

**apatel27** (3): Just tired of it at this point

**jay** (3): feels like its 40 minutes long

**flava** (1): we hate sterile disco

**MassiveThief** (1): literally just "hey we have a catchy chorus!!!! verses? huh? who cares! chorus!!!!!!"

**frogaranaman** (0): hosting a rate with ‚ÄúSay So‚Äù is almost like a messy right of passage. it‚Äôs basically the horcrux of radiofan15

**akanewasright** (10): Man, I‚Äôm so fucking happy this song got all the love it deserves. I‚Äôve seen this song described as the heart of the album, and I really like that reading of it. Megan‚Äôs bars show the difference between her and lots of other people in her position - she will always strive to lift up other women. The chorus in particular has a line I pulled out for the rate writeup - ‚Äúwhy you wanna do the bad bitch wrong/bout to make this *every* bad bitch song‚Äù - that exemplifies this. Unlike a number of other empowerment songs of this kind, she doesn‚Äôt just focus on her own empowerment (which would be rad on its own, don‚Äôt get me wrong) - she genuinely sees her empowerment as something that can and should be shared. That was and is so refreshing, and the best part is that she makes it all sound cool as fuck. Part of that is her ever-excellent flow, and part of that is a fucking BRILLIANT sample. Whoever decided to flip this Jazmine Sullivan song deserves their ass eaten idc

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): Pleasantly surprised at how well this one performed‚Äî it was pretty stable in the Top 5 until the last few ballots, which is really impressive for a deep cut. Now let's get a Jazmine rate in already!!

---

## **Vote Confessional R&B next cycle!**

**indie\_fan\_** (11): that Jazmine sample is a subtle, but still perfect addition to the track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When we get Megan‚Äôs Tale on H3aux Tales, Even Mo‚Äô Tales >>>

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): PLEASE VOTE FOR CONFESSIONAL R&B NEXT CYCLE IT FEATURES JAZMINE SULLIVAN HEAUX TALES DELUXE, ARI LENNOX, KEHLANI AND SUMMER WALKER PLZ PLZ PLZ

**TiltControls** (10): WHERE IS THE JAZMINE RATE IVE BEEN PROMISED

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): as much as i love this song, it kinda feels overshadowed by its sample. every time i listen to it i just want to listen to holding you down by jazmine sullivan.

**throwaway-7650** (8): curtis mayfield/diddy/jazmine sullivan/missy elliott/etc. is this AS6

## **It came after Mac's but I think about this all the time too**

**camerinian** (8.5): wait what's the timeline for this album's release and Mac Miller's album called Circles that had a track called Good News

## **Bout to make this their song**

**letsallpoo** (11): cannot overstate how much I squirted when I first heard this

**MassiveThief** (11): the clear winner on this album/rate. the sample, the flow, the lyrics - it's all perfect.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): IF ANYTHING DESERVED SINGLE TREATMEANT IT WAS THIS SONG. argubly my favourite megan song, she just did what she had to do.

**Awkward\_King** (10): THIS is how u use a sample, literally the perfect sample

**BaconShoes** (10): gets my ass moving in circles truly

**bogo** (10): WHY YOU WANNA DO THE BAD BITCH WRONG?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): is this a reply to post malone

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorites from here

**nt96** (10): should be called Loop cuz thats what I have this song on

**seanderlust** (10): circles second verse :handshake: how to be a heartbreaker :handshake: new rules' prechorus -> slay lists

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): dunno how much of my enjoyment is the sample and how much is megan. great song though

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh shit! It's a bop

**starla\_** (9.5): I love the sample on this and Megan sounds great

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): :frogdance:

**AHSWeeknd** (9): The way Megan carries poor production.

**runaway3212** (9): This beat... this flow... she deserves all her flowers

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9): this goes hard damn. Why have I not listened to this before.

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended fad malone

**WaneDriptoc** (8.5): anytime i think of good news my mind goes to "cigarette juice"

**prettybirbkotori** (8): few years later and i still come back to this song, it is pure fun

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): certified among us twerking gif banger

**UselessTacooo** (8): THE SAMPLE MAKES ME SCREAM (in a good way)

**vayyiqra** (8): fun

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Boppy

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Cute but I'd rather be listening to the Jazmine song this is sampling

**frogaranaman** (7): crazy how this song did so many weeks in the top ten

**IIIHenryIII** (7): no circles then

**jay** (7): yupppp

## **Why'd you want to do a bad bitch wrong?**

**sydschoon** (6.3): beat goes hard, meg spitting fire, not my favorite track tho

**noavocadoshere** (6): s'okay. i feel like i should but i just...don't like it.

**slimboyfriend** (6): it‚Äôs like fine for pop Megan

**cremeebrulee** (3): Unlike GLY, this song felt entire avoidable so I don‚Äôt think it deserves worse than it. Interestingly enough, this was in last place for quite some time since there were a few GLY defenders that moved it away from the bottom spot.

**akanewasright** (2.5): These songs being the bottom 2 (or top 2, depending on how you see it) of the bonus rate felt predetermined, even if it had serious challengers (south of the border was doing worse at some point, I swear). As for this song being #2‚Ä¶ I mean it‚Äôs because Megan actually tries to save the song here. Does she succeed, resoundingly not, but at the very least, spending her verse effectively telling Adam Levine that he‚Äôs a piece of shit is WAY more listenable than anything in Girls LIke You. Plus, this is my own experience, but I did not have to hear this anywhere near as much as fucking Girls Like You, which was inescapable at its peak. Still, this song is dreadful radio filler. Good riddance!

---

**TragicKingdom1** (8): the sheer bewilderment of "how'd you figure out how to call me through the TV??" makes it unironically the best line in the rate

**Bordersz** (7): It is actually a bop....perfect radio fodder.

**sydschoon** (7): maroon 5 is corny but Meg improves this track w her feature

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): completely unmemorable radio filler but passable enough that I didn‚Äôt really change the station because of it either. Maroon 5 has been bad for awhile but there‚Äôs way worse hits than this one

**Frajer** (6): I don't want to hear about Adam Levine having naked women in his bed

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): this song is weird, that‚Äôs all‚Ä¶who approved this


**402man** (5): shes so androgenius like if a good song ("What Lovers Do") and a bad song ("Girls Like You") had a baby <3

**throwaway-7650** (5): ...bebe rexha?

**vayyiqra** (5): Again, I'm only giving this a 5 as a bit, since I refuse to think about this in any depth

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this wasn‚Äôt that traumatizing but i still don‚Äôt like it that much

**noavocadoshere** (4): sighs into oblivion. megan thee stallion ft. maroon 5 would only be slightly better. my score is for meg's involvement and meg only.

**BaconShoes** (3.5): megan saved this a bit

**babadork** (3): I‚Äôm annoyed that this rate informed me that this song existed.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I‚Äôd call this AI generated music but I don‚Äôt want to piss off the robots.

**prettybirbkotori** (2): only maroon 5 could sand down megan this much

**runaway3212** (2): What voodoo does maroon 5 to get these girls on their songs

**seanderlust** (2): that sounds really hard for you adam. to have beautiful women in your bed. thank you for sharing your struggle.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): ok

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): This song is absurd

**starla\_** (1.5): this isn't as bad as Girls Like You

**static\_int\_husp** (1.5): this is very slightly better than the other M5 song but still trash

**1998tweety** (1): meh

**Awkward\_King** (1): girls like you was bland this is vile

**bogo** (1): nobody sounds like they're remotely even trying here

**DaHumanTorch** (1): go girl get that bag i guess

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): embarazzing

**flava** (1): Megan, girl, what the fuck are you doing, you didnt need to give Maroon 5 another hit

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): save

**frogaranaman** (1): this is the Megan Thee Stallion song Taylor Swift knows

**IIIHenryIII** (1): I don‚Äôt have any excuses for this one

**jasannn** (1): trashy corporate mess

**nt96** (1): this is why we need pretentiousness in music cuz we're not gonna sit here and act like this is radio worthy. We got struggling artists putting their whole artussy into their music for scraps while Adumb and the Moron 5 get paid doing the below minimum. And Megan, how are you gonna talk about spreading Good News then do some shit like this? girl talk about hypocrisy. Don't EVEN get me started on you, RATE HOSTS. How dare you not allow us to give out 0s when this exists!? This is unforgivable and yall aren't seeing the pearly gates AT ALL. Apparently Covid isn't doing her part so I figured we all said fuck it and tried finishing the bitch's job by holding hands, singing Kumbaya as we nosedive into the abyss? Haven't I suffered enough??? Merry Christmas I guess.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (1): no

**shipperondeck** (1): being subjected to another modern maroon 5 song in the same rate is like having your kneecaps smashed and then getting pantsed. how did they peel the bloody pants off? why did they even bother except to further insult you? the answers to these questions are unknown

**Stryxen** (1): you did me dirt, why? cos what did i do? like

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): if i hear this song one more time at work i‚Äôll commit manslaughter

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): Megan is phoning this in, but Adam Levine has been phoning it in since 2008

**UselessTacooo** (1): I actually feel physically ill listening to this

**welcome2thejam** (1): Absolutely not


## **https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/265/962/2b6**

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): there is literally zero reason maroon 5 needs to be in this rate the same amount of times as SZA

**slimboyfriend** (4): I can‚Äôt believe you made me listen to two Maroon 5 songs in a rate about women

**impla77** (2): not more maroon 5 pls

**TiltControls** (1.5): i only have enough energy to deal with maroon 5 once per a rate

**AHSWeeknd** (1): STOP WITH THE MAROON 5.

**DirtyRat583** (1): maroon 5 again? was this necessary. this one isnt even a little bit good üò≠

**plastichaxan** (1): One Maroon 5 song wasn‚Äôt enough for this torture

**akanewasright** (1): And here we have it! Our big winner/loser! As obvious as it may seem that this would be the bottom 1 of the bonus, it was actually a really close race until the last few days of the rate. I always thought this would pull through, considering the number of you guys who tried to give this song a 0, but a few people giving the song a 10 early on and a few others hating tracks like South of the Border and Beautiful Mistakes more than this changed things up. But in the end, I‚Äôm happy we were able to come together and crown this as the worst song of the rate.

**cremeebrulee** (1): it‚Äôs the fucking anti-smasha

---


**Hulnia** (10): this and maps are their only good songs

**TiltControls** (10): some people know that i have no shame when it comes to songs i like. those people are wrong and this song is why

**DirtyRat583** (9): if this was made by an indie girl u people would eat it up but because it wasnt u dislike it hm

**IIIHenryIII** (8): c‚Äômon, it‚Äôs not that bad

**Frajer** (7): Cardi ate but I can't rate a modern day Maroon 5 song higher than a 7

**jasannn** (7): i enjoyed this song quite a bit the summer of 2018, before I joined popheads. In hindsight, it‚Äôs pretty empty and super inoffensive but I still don‚Äôt mind this song. It‚Äôs the only Maroon 5 song I have saved now.

**slimboyfriend** (7): honestly‚Ä¶. They‚Äôve made songs that are more grating

**bogo** (5.5): idk i get that it was way overplayed in 2018 but i don't really agree with the sentiment that this is the absolute worst thing maroon 5 has ever released, there's several maroon 5 songs that are WAY worse than this including another song in this bonus rate

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I don‚Äôt think this is terrible, but it‚Äôs definitely not good either

**vayyiqra** (5): I'm only giving this a 5 as a bit, since I refuse to think about this in any depth

**indie\_fan\_** (4): Look, i always thought the solo version was fine. Not great or standout, just ok enough for a radio song. Then Cardi jumped in and made the song much worse.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): yeah it's bad and solely saved by cardi's energy but it's not the worst song in this bonus rate

**UselessTacooo** (4): gag

**RandomHypnotica** (3): mic the snare's maroon 5 ddd came out the day i am filling this out idk if that's a positive or negative but you should all subscribe to mr snare

**sydschoon** (2.7): not sure why this feature exists?

**Awkward\_King** (2): idk anymore

**BaconShoes** (2): I don‚Äôt like this at all, not even the Cardi part I‚Äôm sorry. The chorus is catchy, but that kinda makes it worse since I don‚Äôt enjoy it

**musical\_pyn** (2): stream the st. vincent remix!!

**runaway3212** (2): This is beyond terrible

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): sigh

**1998tweety** (1): meh

**402man** (1): no.

**AHSWeeknd** (1): Rate organizers, how could you add this here

**apatel27** (1): It sounds worse than a bad Ed Sheeran song

**babadork** (1): A lot of my hate for this is for the video. I do not like that this is trying to position itself as being pro-women by sticking a bunch of women in the music video. If I was allowed and Drake didn‚Äôt have a worse one, this would be my 0.

**DaHumanTorch** (1): musical terrorism

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): this is the ‚ÄúPokemon Go to the Polls‚Äù, ‚ÄúParks and Recreation‚Äù, ‚Äúnicecore‚Äù and ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù of pop/rap crossover music. Neoliberal millennial nightmare, should be bullied any chance it gets. Gray music video set purgatory.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): my

**ImADudeDuh** (1): living through this being #1 was traumatizing

**impla77** (1): I was thinking Cardis verse could save this a little but no.. no it doesn‚Äôt

**MassiveThief** (1): absolute L of a song

**noavocadoshere** (1): why am i listening to maroon 5 post-songs about jane/it won't be soon before long? couldn't even throw us a bone with bruno mars or normani, smh. crying.

**nt96** (1): this caused the pandemic

**sa5m\_i\_am** (1): fucking hate this song and fuck you guys for including it lol. The whiny sound of Adam Levines voice hurts my earssss

**static\_int\_husp** (1): Adam Levine's voice is just the worst, I wanna fall asleep to any modern M5 song

**Stryxen** (1): YASSSSSSSSSS

**throwaway-7650** (1): the guitar strumming... jumpscare

## **https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/002/265/962/2b6**

**flava** (1): please just lemme 0 the fuck out of this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): It‚Äôs fowl, FOWL that people are not legally allowed to give this a 0.

**plastichaxan** (1): Putting this in a place where I can‚Äôt 0 it is so sick

**prettybirbkotori** (1): i am doing the bonus rate just to express how much i hate this song, i would give it a 0 if i could

**shipperondeck** (1): cant believe you fuckers are making me scrobble maroon 5

**starla\_** (1): I would give this a 0 if I could. Why are there 7 people in Maroon 5? Why do they have Snapchat filters on their faces on the album cover? Did Adam Levine really not know what "red pill" means???

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): you said we can't use our 0 in the bonus rates?

**Verboten\_Prince** (1): Everything about this is 0-worthy

**welcome2thejam** (1): You'll all pay for the warcrimes of this bonus rate

**akanewasright** (11): Man‚Ä¶ This is my favorite Doja Cat song, and probably one of my favorite songs ever (if you go by pure play count‚Ä¶ [yeah](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851835432886599761/1051341689127698502/Screen_Shot_2022-12-10_at_10.36.11_PM.png)). This kind of redefined what I could expect from a Good Doja Cat Song. It might be the first Doja song I really loved that was completely genuine, emotional, and sincere. Like yes, there‚Äôs the rap verse to add some levity (‚ÄúNO FINAL FANTASY CAN WE END THESE GAMES‚Äù), but even that‚Äôs largely pretty open and sincere. It‚Äôs this sexy, pleading love song, but with a deeply sinister edge thanks to an immaculately dark beat from Blaq Tuxedo. It‚Äôs hypnotic and sinister, just like her love for this man, and I can‚Äôt get enough of it. This and ‚ÄúSay So‚Äù were neck and neck for Doja‚Äôs top song before a barrage of 11s for this came in at the last minute (along with a tanking or two for ‚ÄúSay So‚Äù) to seal it for ‚ÄúStreets‚Äù. All of Doja‚Äôs songs had strong contingents of people who did not understand or enjoy them. I understood this from the moment the rate began - hell, I have a few friends who find this song very boring! But I‚Äôm glad this song emerged as the Doja song that the most people loved, even if it still had plenty of detractors. This song even cinched the honor of having the most 11s in the rate (CREME PLEASE TAKE THAT OUT IF I‚ÄôM NOT SUPPOSED TO REVEAL THAT YET) (creme: i think ur fine dhfdhfd), which is more than enough for me.

**cremeebrulee** (11): I did wonder if 11ing this in a ‚Äúrap girl‚Äù rate was something of a copout, but at the end of the day, this is my favorite song here by a large margin. Doja switching between moody R&B and a quick-witted rap break is so effortless; I love how she essentially serves as a feature to herself. Not to mention the production here is to die for, I want to drown in that opening drop ugh!! This song was pretty much the Levitating-print for me: it was an early fave when I first got into the album and I was so pumped when it got to be a hit later down the road. It‚Äôs a true testament to Doja‚Äôs versatility and star power‚Ä¶ I only wish it could‚Äôve done a little better as her last song. Regardless, this song got a LOT of love and a lot of you thought this was would be a Top 3 lock, so it's definitely well-appreciated. Here's to hoping that DC4 is the project that gets Doja to start breaking Top 5 in album rates.

## **Go to horny jail**

**throwaway-7650** (11): pls disclosure I will have your babies (yes both brothers at once)

## **It's cause it samples the song, Streets Is Callin by B2K!**

**shipperondeck** (3): why is this called streets when "streets" are not mentioned once. in fact it's about not being on the streets actually. this has bothered me for years

## **There ain't no scores like you**

**Bordersz** (11): A modern R&B classic. It reminds me of Drake's Marvins Room so much.

**camerinian** (11): this literally wasn't my 11 at any point until I heard it after drinking ‚Öî of a bottle of white wine cos I'd opened it to make a pasta and didn't have fridge space to keep it chilled, and following those circumstances fuck this track is so hot. I‚Äôm not gonna say anymore because I don‚Äôt dare go horny on main, but Doja fucking nailed this

**CrimsonROSET** (11): the fact this wasn‚Äôt the single right away?? and it took like 2 years for it to be one?? insanity

**fadedblue09** (11): this feels very FKA Twigs-inspired

**jasannn** (11): I became a bit gayer the month the tik tok trend for this song came out

**noavocadoshere** (11): if there's one thing this song is gonna do, it's stay on my playlist. the og album cut, slowed + reverbed, sped up, live performances. never gets old. she's for the streets, truly.

**ricki** (11): ill be honest, i dont wanna overthink my 11. im assuming this is doja‚Äôs best chance to win so im putting my eggs in this basket and hoping for the best

**sa5m\_i\_am** (11): I have played this maybe 1000 times nothing can compete with the drop and her voice here. Such a vibe.

**starla\_** (11): this is it, it's the smasha

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): who else ascends when the beat comes in

**UselessTacooo** (11): The media was attacking her left and right. All she had was a rare-breed papa and a dream. She had one chance.

**vayyiqra** (11): Nothing else on this album or in this rate beats the contrast between the upbeat, bouncy, slightly wacky rest of the album and then suddenly this moody, atmospheric, brooding track comes on and it's like "wait what the fuck is this song [positive]" and it rules

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Doja Cat purposely acts like a troll online, because if she didn‚Äôt, and acted like a sexually-active popstar all the time the world would implode. Like, do you hear this?? This isn‚Äôt normal. She could easily murder anyone just by being hot and stuff but instead she‚Äôs like ‚Äúfart‚Äù which balances it all out. AND on top of that, she held that Eyes Wide Shut theme party, kino queen. This message has been sponsored by the users of r/DojaCat.

**BaconShoes** (10): such a vibe omg. It‚Äôs a stunning song. I love how her singing sounds here and her rapping is great too

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When I recruit 40 people from r/askreddit to do this rate, tank Beyonce, and then this wins.

**bogo** (10): this sounds sexy as hell

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Burial please remix this

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): im so sorry my meow meow.

**gt\_official09** (10): yeah she just absolutely decided to make one of the songs ever and called it a day

**ignitethephoenix** (10): sinister twerking

**impla77** (10): any song referencing final fantasy will get a 10 from me

**jay** (10): yuppppp

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me: hey i know you like games with a good story so here's one of my fav- 

 doja: NO FINAL FANTASY 

 me: :(

**runaway3212** (10): thank u to that one tiktok user who performed the worst version of the best verse of this song

**seanderlust** (10): oh thank GOD that man isn't involved with this one because dear lord it slaps

**Stryxen** (10): :oopsithinkipooped:

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): strong 11 contender, will never forget doja just being about to start a new era and this going viral

**welcome2thejam** (10): This is at least a good nine streets ahead

**1998tweety** (9): sensual sex bop serve [2]

**hikk** (9): the disclosure remix is also a massive slay

**plastichaxan** (9): Glad to finally get why this was such a hit cause I swear I didn‚Äôt really get it until now

**WaneDriptoc** (8.2): post-weeknd vibe. why does she have to keep changing outfits every minute? doja this fast fashion shit is NOT good for your wallet OR the enivronment! plz think about what you doin!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I didn‚Äôt know that that ‚Äúdamn papa you a rare e, no comparing‚Äù audio was from this song for like 5 months

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this is such a good r&b vibe and then the rap verse comes in and ruins the mood‚Ä¶sorry im docking points for that

**sydschoon** (7.1): nice slow track but not my fav

**TiltControls** (7): where were all these gamers during vgi?!?!?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Moody vibes

## **Send your location (I want to fight)**

**celladonn** (5): Where does all the love for this one come from? I don't get it

**frogaranaman** (5): the Party Favor remix of this is nuuuuuuts

**Roxieloxie** (4.5): this song has never done it for me I‚Äôm sorry akane and creme I know you all love this and the milk and it‚Äôs just never done it for me. It‚Äôs fully there and exist for me

**IIIHenryIII** (4): too vibey

**Awkward\_King** (3): this is not my fave doja song but i do admire how much it stands out in her discog, ive accepted i just prefer her over quicker, livelier beats. the vevo performance of her doing this in milk though >>>

**prettybirbkotori** (3): lyrically not her best and i really just don‚Äôt think this is the sound for her

**akanewasright** (10): I‚Äôm honestly over the moon that this got to the top 5, because for the longest time the top 5 was 4 Megan songs and I Like It, and that‚Äôs boring as hell to reveal. Not to mention, this song absolutely deserves all the 10s it got. There‚Äôs a reason this song was as big as it was: Cardi‚Äôs persona and delivery were immediately established with this song, and as this climbed up the charts, a true star was born. I don‚Äôt even wanna talk about the song much more because I would rather just slut drop to it instead. This had a few prominent tankers, and I didn‚Äôt even know if this would even make the top 10 for a hot minute. Thank god the 10s showed up.

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): While WAP may have taken the crown of being Cardi‚Äôs most notable song now, I can‚Äôt forget how much of a moment this song was when it dropped. It just exudes such captivating bad bitch energy and honestly it‚Äôs a great introduction to the general public on who Cardi is and how she got here. I especially love the rapid fire last verse, it‚Äôs such great way to conclude the track. I fully expected this to be Cardi‚Äôs last remaining track, or even a contender for the top 3‚Ä¶ but it ended up floundering a little more than I expected. Still, it‚Äôs one of the few songs here that never left Day 3, so cheers to that!

## **Making money moves**

**runaway3212** (11): God this song is so fucking powerfull

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Cardi queen

**apatel27** (10): Only boring people hate this

**BaconShoes** (10): THE SMASHA!! What an iconic moment. I also really like the UNIIQU3 remix

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yeah right picture that with a Bodak.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the earth moved

**DirtyRat583** (10): the bitches that didnt like this when it was first released were living in the past. bodak yellow was the moment and it ushered in a new era u had to be ready and 99% of people were not ready

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this was really popular with the farmer girls at my high school, which feels strange because this was rural NZ where most of the drama would be a major plot point in a B Grade Lifetime movie

**gt\_official09** (10): a classic, we all remember where we where when we first heard this, a moment for the culture even if u will!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this chorus still fucks

**jay** (10): yuppppp

**joeeswift** (10): certified classic!!

**noavocadoshere** (10): EASILY. THESE EXPENSIVE THESE IS RED BOTTOMS THESE IS BLOODY SHOES

**nt96** (10): I remember when Janet Jackson was on tour and she switched What Have You Done For Me Lately to this. The world wasn‚Äôt the same after that

**OutrageousWorldTour** (10): an immediate classic

**prettybirbkotori** (10): i mean come on

**starla\_** (10): I remember hearing this back in 2017 and thinking she'd be a one hit wonder for sure. Obviously I was wrong

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): strong 11 contender and probably my most played song in the rate. it took a while to click for me but once it did GODDAMN

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): "I make money moves!" I say as I debate which steam sale game to spend 9.99 on

**throwaway-7650** (10): the impact this had on (sub)urban high schools everywhere

**UselessTacooo** (10): musical.ly could not handle her power

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah this is the only 10 I've giving this album because the instrumental really is good and she kind of nails her verses and it's very memorable. I didn't "get it" until I heard it in a bar one night and thought "what's that song that's really dark-sounding and cool - oh it's that, alright fine this song is Good In Fact"

**WaneDriptoc** (10): Look...we all have a tale with this one. Mine's waking up at 5:50 and eating hummus toast and ham to sleepwalk to a coffee shop and open and listen to top 40 radio by 6:20 AM once, if not twice a week. So an incredible amount of songs I developed stockholm syndrome with when I wasn't washing dishes to listen to like...minutemen or e2-e4 or aquadrunkard shows. Bodak Yellow was one of those songs until I took a hit at a friday party out of a humongous bong named kristoff and realized two things: "1) yeah this lady has points and this beat sleepwalks with power like i aspire to. 2) oh this is the energy and ruthless deliery that like 60% of the IV population is looking for". shit CHANGED everything for everyone and it truly was just that much of a slapper. end of discussion it was life changing if you were at that moment in a social environment with young people.

**Bordersz** (9.8): Iconic. Flow, the chorus, the beat, "I DONT GOTTA DANCE I MAKE MONEY MOVES". Only negative is Kodak's flow on this...

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): a cultural reset for the female rap game (do not let Nicki find this comment)

**seanderlust** (9.5): there was this video a while back of a whole crowd of people rapping along to bodak yellow that convinced me that cardi was going to be huge. and for good reason - this song goes OFF

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this dethroning LWYMMD (song acronym bot can explain) was a moment the culture shifted

**MassiveThief** (9): legendary

**ricki** (9): this opened the door nicki was working her hardest to keep closed and sealed

**shipperondeck** (9): well, a classic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): honestly one of the best debut singles of all time, is that a hot take? idk but it shouldnt be

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): this is like that High School Musical song but with money moves

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): It's not her best but it's still a catchy song with funny quips, truly a great introduction to a future icon

**camerinian** (8.5): actually mad how Cardi just came out fully formed like that. Like no warmup, no awkward starting period, just straight fire straight away.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8.5): its fun its fun

**flava** (8): she came into the game, ripping off Kodak Black‚Äôs flow and doing it better than him, and gave the people what they wanted, g

**slimboyfriend** (8): Imagine telling yourself before this album came out that Cardi B wouldn‚Äôt be a one hit wonder and that Bodak Yellow would only be like the 6th best song on her album

## **Bloody**

**1998tweety** (7): this is fine but soo overrated

**frogaranaman** (7): red

**plastichaxan** (6): This is fine I just wish there was a switch at one point or something but like :shrug:

**sydschoon** (5.5): I know this is the song that put Cardi on the map, but imo it's not her best on the album

**Awkward\_King** (5): this is one of the earliest songs i remember being old enough to perceive like.. how much of a moment it was. it grows off of me a little every time i hear it so im simply gonna stop listening to it bc it deserves better!!!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): love cardi but this is literally the same beat for 4 minutes.

**amr** (4): this really solidified my need to keep up w pop music in realtime again cos that was one of my most underwhelming first listens in recent memory like I probably would've loved this in 2017

**oscarbrierley1** (0): I've been forced to listen to this too many times in clubs and at parties. I hated it when it first came out and i hate it now.


## **r/indieheads Transplants**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I‚Äôm not gonna put the copypasta to spare Akane but let it be know I am thinking it

**welcome2thejam** (8): I'm too tired to riff on the Bodak Yellow indieheads pasta just pretend it's here and I did something clever w/ it

**bogo** (7): so this is what it's- [GUNSHOTS]

**celladonn** (7): I will admit when this topped that pitchfork list that year my initial reaction was not dissimilar to that indieheads copypasta. But I'll still vibe to this

**RandomHypnotica** (2): i just do NOT like this song, that pinging little synth in the background throughout feels piercing and annoying, the lyrics feel like something cardi has done much better since, i don't like her flow either, it feels almost like it's constantly being stretched back and forth, like she's trying to catch back up to the beat? and the track as whole just seems to really linger on and on for it's relatively short runtime. if i REALLY hated creme and akane i would put the copypasta here now.

cremeebrulee: ## **[Tilt I can't believe you were the only one to send this in full](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/828103328999276555.webp?size=240&quality=lossless)**

**TiltControls** (8): So this is what it‚Äôs come down to, huh?

With the crowning of ‚ÄúBodak Yellow‚Äù as 2017‚Äôs single greatest piece of music, Pitchfork has finally completed their transition from pretentious indie rag to absolute, unsalvageable garbage. Maybe I‚Äôm just old and out of touch. Maybe the children are wrong. But I have no idea how a song with such a generic beat and such a generic flow and such generic, mindless lyrics like ‚ÄúBodak Yellow‚Äù is even considered a decent piece of music, much less some groundbreaking work of art.

It‚Äôs obvious at this point that Pitchfork has changed, and for the worse. This wouldn‚Äôt have happened even five years ago. Back then you could have critiqued Pitchfork for their writing or their attitude or their politics, but their lists? Their lists contained some genuinely forward thinking, boundary pushing music. When they made a list it felt as if they were really trying to reward the best music of the year. Don‚Äôt believe me? Their top three songs of 2012 were Usher‚Äôs ‚ÄúClimax‚Äù, Frank Ocean‚Äôs ‚ÄúPyramids‚Äù, and Grimes‚Äô ‚ÄúOblivion‚Äù, three songs that were unique, innovative, and overall well-crafted pieces of pop music. Let‚Äôs go back even further, to 2007. Pitchfork‚Äôs top three songs from that year were Panda Bear‚Äôs ‚ÄúBros‚Äù, Battles‚Äô ‚ÄúAtlas‚Äù, and LCD Soundsystem‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll My Friends‚Äù. There‚Äôs no way, absolutely no way at all, that you can tell me that ‚ÄúBodak Yellow‚Äù deserves to be ranked among any of those songs.

And you know what? I actually like some of this list. In the top ten alone I really like ‚ÄúBoys‚Äù and ‚ÄúGreen Light‚Äù and ‚ÄúDNA‚Äù. But the songs that I do like are simply overwhelmed by the amount of trash elsewhere. And it‚Äôs not even as if these ‚Äútrash‚Äù songs have some redeeming qualities here and there. It‚Äôs not as if they‚Äôre songs that, while well-executed, just fail to connect with me. The reality is that, try as I might, I simply cannot fathom what makes a song like ‚ÄúBodak Yellow‚Äù or ‚ÄúXO Tour Llif3‚Äù an enjoyable, forward thinking piece of music. I can‚Äôt even fathom what makes those songs ‚Äúdecent‚Äù. To me they just sound like absolute, unmitigated, garbage.

So yeah, I‚Äôm getting older. What might have connected with me ten years ago may not connect with me now. But Pitchfork has also changed. And in their attempt to gain a larger audience they‚Äôve shed the bulk of the avant-garde music that might‚Äôve scared off some of their potential audience (could you even imagine something as weird as the 12 minute long psychedelic odyssey that is ‚ÄúBros‚Äù cracking the top ten in 2017?) in favor of music that largely panders to the lowest common denominator.

Congratulations, Pitchfork. I hope all that extra ad revenue is worth it.

**akanewasright** (10): This song being up so high was honestly shocking to me, but perhaps it shouldn‚Äôt have been. LIke‚Ä¶ who the hell is gonna tank a song like this in this rate? I‚Äôm honestly astonished by the ease with which Megan absolutely DEMOLISHES Tory Lanez - she hits on everything, from the gun he used (‚Äúyou shot a 5‚Äô10‚Äù bitch with a .22, talkin bout bones and tendons like them bullets wasn‚Äôt pellets‚Äù) to his so called level of fame (‚Äúyou‚Äôre not popping you just on the remix‚Äù) in just one verse, before she moves on to his supporters and her antis. She didn‚Äôt even need a second verse to take him down, she just uses it as a victory lap. This never really made it to the top 3, probably because it‚Äôs not as much pure *fun* as the songs above it, but it made it all the way up here with no scores under 5 and the lowest controversy in the rate, and all of that without being a single. That‚Äôs fucking incredible, and is a win of its own.

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): What a fucking opener, Meg just gets straight to it and just fucking ANNIHILATES Tory. I'm so glad this got as high as it did and that we as a community can just support her unabashedly; I often forget that these sentiments aren't really shared in the general public.

**akanewasright** (10): And with that, the song I thought could pull off a dark horse rate win at #3. The upper end of the rate used to have an uninterrupted string of Megan songs with this at #2 behind another Megan song, so while I wish this had done a little better from the perspective of a fan‚Ä¶ as a host who had to make things exciting to reveal, this had to go. But GOD this song fucking rules. Every bar is just endlessly entertaining (vote for the anime rate), and really shows off Megan‚Äôs skillset over an excellent sample.

**cremeebrulee** (10): We unfortunately part ways with Good New's lead single now, and what I think genuinely might be Megan's best solo song. It's got that iconic sample, an endless supply of braggadacious punchlines, and an incredible opening line that hypes you the second you hear it. The love for this is definitely apparent, it got a ton of 11s early on, and it never left Top 3! It even held first place for some time and it would have been a spill of a winner tbh.

## **FUCK BEING GOOD, I'M A BAD BITCH**

**martian\_pet** (11): I had this job where by the end of the day my mind was toasted, and I was still an hour away from home, however one day I came across this song (it had passed me away somehow) and I started playing it religiously every day as soon as I left work like only once at full volume, my day was shit and I was fried but for two minutes and thirty four seconds I was a BAD BITCH and everything was okay.

**prettybirbkotori** (9): this song‚Äôs energy does not let up for a single second

**akanewasright** (10): This song‚Äôs place in the rate was pretty much always in flux, right up until the very end. It spent a while swapping places with ‚ÄúGirls in the Hood‚Äù, and from there it kept gaining points as ‚ÄúSavage Remix‚Äù lost them. Until the very last ballot, there was only a 10 point difference between this and the winner. That gap widened with a last minute 0, but this song got *incredibly* close to winning. And it would have deserved honestly! This was a true moment in pop culture, it felt like everyone knew it and probably liked it. Hell, the lowest score on this was a mid-5 (from my cohost) up until the last ballot. But nah, I think everyone on this song kills it - Benito, Balvin, and ESPECIALLY Cardi B, who lays down one of her most fun verses here. This was always gonna be Cardi‚Äôs top song, and I‚Äôm glad this gave Megan a true challenger.

**cremeebrulee** (5.7): This placement was genuinely a nightmare for me because I‚Äôve never really been too /into/ this song. I think its pacing is exhausting. While Cardi‚Äôs first verse is an album highlight and the perfect setup for the rest of the track‚Ä¶ it just runs out of steam once the chorus comes in. That and the two features just make this song seem SOOO much longer than it actually is. (Honestly, if you cut out J Balvin‚Äôs especially mediocre verse, maybe I would bump this up a few points.) But weirdly enough, I found myself appreciating this song for being able to be Megan‚Äôs only real competition (without it, we would‚Äôve easily had a Indieheads-Beths-style sweep). At one point, the gap between this and Savage was only like 9 points, and I was almost rooting for it to overtake Megan‚Ä¶ even though I don‚Äôt like the song itself?! I think that‚Äôs honestly just part of Cardi‚Äôs charm‚Äî she‚Äôs just the underdog that you want to cheer on.

White guys suddenly discovered pastel colors. Pumpkin Pies; DISCARDED! Flan and Coquito is taking over! Mashed Potatoes? ARROZ CON POLLO Y GANDULES FOREVER BITCH. Maria, Irma? Retired, Broke & irreparably STINKY. We Latinos are the true hurricanes. Walls? Dilapidated, crumbled, POOF! BEGONE! Trump was secretly throwing saggy, musty ass (and dust) to this in his private room wearing a wired headband, a satin knot front crop top with bell sleeves, leopard print booty shorts and 6-inch Louboutin pumps, wishing he had an iota of adobo on his unsalted cracker, but to no avail. We came, they saw, they collapsed harder than that old woman in that life alert commercial. End of story.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): how can I not love this song, j balvin mentions lady gaga

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): This song is a PARTY. The sample is great, J Balvin and Mr. Bunny are great, Cardi references Mario for whatever reason, it's beautiful.

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now, LATINE GANG

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I wonder if she asked Bad Bunny and J Balvin what their lyrics meant.

**BaconShoes** (10): Amazing use of the sample, the beat bangs, the features are fun, cardi is thriving, it‚Äôs just a great time

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I think hearing this on the radio nonstop back in 2018 numbed me to how much of a megabop this is.

**bogo** (10): do not make thirst comments about bad bunny do not make thirst comments about bad bunny do not make thirst comments about bad bunny

**camerinian** (10): blatant pandering to the cultural moment in 2018 to get a crossover hit with an obvious sample and features that Cardi has no business working with. How does it *still* slap so seamlessly even after all this time

**CrimsonROSET** (10): thinking about how cardi is the last person in this song we‚Äôre covering a full project of

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): in my gringa bag, going crazy to this and 3 minutes in just to yell LADY GAGA!!!

**DirtyRat583** (10): whats that? men cant make good music? hmmmmmmm

**fadedblue09** (10): my favorite Bad Bunny song

**hikk** (10): omg i haven't really heard this since 2018 tbt

**ignitethephoenix** (10): honestly this song is so good it probably should win the rate but it will probably end up at 2nd cause someone tanked

**ImADudeDuh** (10): thinking about how I gave this a 5 in the popheads jukebox while confusing bad bunny and j balvin‚Äôs verses and then I gave it my 11 in two separate rates

**jay** (10): yuppppp

**pikajake** (10): LISA's dancing made this song a 10

**plastichaxan** (10): I didn't ask to be born latina no m√°s tuve suerte

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh my god. i DO like it, how did she know??!?!?!?

**ricki** (10): the main reason i didnt want this rate to pass was because i didnt want this to lose for a 5th time

**runaway3212** (10): just such a slay song

**seanderlust** (10): BYE not j balvin saying he's going to knock off our wig

**shipperondeck** (10): this one is for bad bunny flopping in winners like how dare you all........

**starla\_** (10): the best song on the album

**Stryxen** (10): the part in the outro where they take turns saying I like it like that is so corny crossover episode coded

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my pen? Bitch I‚Äôm Sonic.‚Äù ‚Äúbout my coins like Mario‚Äù well https://media.tenor.com/9z3rpvYfoDIAAAAd/sonic-and-mario-kiss.gif

**throwaway-7650** (10): :latinas:

**TiltControls** (10): and she didn't even do vgi smh

**UselessTacooo** (10): carried 2018 radi

**WaneDriptoc** (10): With Bad Bunny and J Balvin in tow, Cardi B shows us why the three-way is ALWAYS a good option

**welcome2thejam** (10): Kids Bop cover is the 11

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): a moment tbh and deservedly

**sa5m\_i\_am** (9.5): fun and instant classic

**sydschoon** (9.5): this song was innovative, it fucking BANGS, and she somehow got bad bunny AND J Balvin?????

**DaHumanTorch** (9.3): bad bunny shouting out lady gaga is the gay agenda

**Bordersz** (9): This ran summer of 2018 like inescapable. It  is a banger. One thing is I forget J Balvin was on this bc the radio edit, edit his ass out perfectly.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): this song is a party and my ears are the pinatas

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): a fantastic song but i'm just a little tired of it. my only complaint is it drags a little at the end

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): where was this in the mario movie trailer

**impla77** (8.5): I was going to look up the translation, but that‚Äôs not really the point is it?

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): I like this song but I hate whenever it comes on in publicly cause now I gotta be a villain and eye down white people  like I‚Äôm L from death note to not say the n word

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Someone on a popcast episode said this song was basically the product of a record label executive board meeting so thank god for corporate greed!

**gt\_official09** (8): such a hit i remember this being everywhereeee

**isthesweetestcon** (8): i still unironically still like the balenciagas that look like socks

**prettybirbkotori** (8): the hits are hits what can i say

**MassiveThief** (7): Cardi goes hard and I love the beat but Bad Bunny is just not it on this song

**noavocadoshere** (7): this is a fun one, but i'm not really feeling it.

## **Okay see, it's not just me who hates J Balvin on this**

**flava** (6.5): on one hand, Cardi B. on the other hand J Balvin referencing Mi Gente

**indie\_fan\_** (5.8): Get Jos√© the FUCK outta here and this song woulda immediately improved

**vayyiqra** (0): Unfortunately I do not like it at all, which is too bad because I like Bad Bunny, but this song is just deeply annoying to me on a visceral level. I get the appeal, I just can't get past how it makes me flinch. Don't ask me to explain why, I truly don't know

**akanewasright** (10): And here we have it, our winner. Tied with ‚ÄúStreets‚Äù for the most 11s in the rate with as many 10s as second place. This was‚Ä¶ alarmingly close to losing a few times for such a clear, predestined winner. For the first months of the rate, it was winning with a 9.9-ish average, and then in the last week, a few people sent in ballots that dropped its score drastically. And yet‚Ä¶ this never left the top spot after the first few ballots. Even as people tried to bring it down (some of them with truly BAFFLING reasoning), it just couldn‚Äôt stop. This song really is all that. Completely deserved winner, happy to see it do so well.

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): Yes, this was obviously always going to be the winner but surprisingly it did not have the lead everyone thought it would have. Especially after seeing this maintain a 9.9 and no scores below a nine for literally weeks with thirty-ish ballots, seeing it now be crowned the winner with a 9.3 and only a 16 point gap between I Like It feels *just* a bit whelming. Even then, I can't say this isn't an undeserved winner since this remix truly redefined what makes for a good collaborative remix these days. Beyonc√© and Megan have such perfect synergy, with Bey balancing Meg's confident, bad bitch energy with some much-needed sensuality that the original track lacked. They'll definitely make for some competition in Winners 4, which is when we will see them next!

## **[well](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Em7JbIWVoAA3WHj.jpg)**

**TiltControls** (11): if this doesn't get 10.792 again I'm going to be very disappointed

**Stryxen** (10): when this wins with a 10.8 average AGAIN YASS

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): yeah like i wouldn't be surprised if this had an average of 10


## **Classy, bougie**

**AHSWeeknd** (11): Only Beyonc√© can hold up with Megan on Megan‚Äôs own song.

**bogo** (11): yeah who am i kidding, this is the 11 and it will always be the 11, it's way too iconic

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): due to this song we don‚Äôt have to crack down on the glaring privacy issues of TikTok, as a treat

**flava** (11): the remix that should‚Äôve ended the pandemic

**Frajer** (11): Beyonc√© reminding people she's from Houston is my favorite genre

**hikk** (11): everyone died

**ignitethephoenix** (11): now this is how you do a remix, everyone else needs to take notes

**welcome2thejam** (11): It's the goddamned banger (okay)

**1998tweety** (10): they mothered

**amr** (10): lesbian national anthem

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is one of those times i wont even be mad when this (hopefully) predictably wins. it is just that good. its perfect in every sense of the word; an already great song, remixed featuring a legend, the remix entirely restructures the song, making it more dynamic, iconic lyrics, its perfect your honour its actually perfect.

**BaconShoes** (10): i mean it‚Äôs an iconic Texas slay collab moment

**CrimsonROSET** (10): sigh

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i'll be gagged if this isn't the winner

**frogaranaman** (10): I assume this wins

**gt\_official09** (10): what a moment two texan queens coming together to make such a great bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): does anyone else remember when this started scrobbling under Beyonce? ajnadfvkj

**jay** (10): YASSSSSSSSSSSS

**noavocadoshere** (10): beyonce is so extra for no reason, busting out with that OOOOOOWOOOOOOAHOOOOO in the middle of this remix and i love her for that. flawless. perfection. no slander against this holy union between the stallion and queen bee shall prosper.

**nt96** (10): winning Fortnite matches and bustin it down to this while your fallen enemies watch. This is the future Liberals want.

**runaway3212** (10): Beyonc√© still that bitch

**seanderlust** (10): that two piano chord loop is delicious and an absolute guaranteed way to get me hyped up.

**shipperondeck** (10): changed the game wbk

**starla\_** (10): the original Savage is an 11

**sydschoon** (10): BANGER ALWAYS

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): real shit

**throwaway-7650** (10): if only we did this rate before I overplayed

**vayyiqra** (10): Those piano chords give this a bit of a jazz-rap feel and I love that genre also this collab just rules as a concept

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Don't mind me just living in my fantasy universe where I can pretend this isn't the obvious winner

**Bordersz** (9.9): One of the best remixes I've heard in years.

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): I prefer the original but not in a beyonce ruins this way more the original reminds me of like the last moments before my freshman year was ruined of my friend joining this group of girls doing the tiktok and that‚Äôs such a period and this is something else bits still fucking amazing though don‚Äôt get it twisted

**impla77** (9): This is pretty iconic!!

**isthesweetestcon** (9): getting tiger king flashbacks but the song still slaps

**prettybirbkotori** (9): it‚Äôs a hit that feels obviously tacked on but how can you not love it

**camerinian** (8.5): don't get nostalgic for the pandemic charts don't get nostalgic for the pandemic charts don't get nostalgic for the pandemic charts don't get nostal-

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): getting a beyonce feature is so iconic.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8.5): instant classic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Obviously a slay but the original version is better tbh. This version always felt a little too crowded.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): fortnite got me tired of this one, but if I‚Äôm being honest, I was never a big fan of it

**musical\_pyn** (8): I don't actually love the song itself but beyonce is just so perfect here I have to give it a good score

## **Bitch, what's happening**

**ricki** (7): i was so happy listening to this rate only for this to come up and ruin the mood because i had to face the fact that nothing else was winning

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): Okay hot hot hot take, this did not age well. I would rather hear the solo version than Beyonc√©‚Äôs, and that‚Äôs not a normal thing to hear

**MassiveThief** (6): in the wise words of queen B: "ok"

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): sigh‚Ä¶i already know this is gonna win the rate in a landslide and that literally everyone other than me loves it but i just feel *nothing* from this remix. the original savage was already a perfectly good song, sure it was short but sometimes 2 minutes is all you need to make an impression, and that‚Äôs what it did! its a great song and one of my favorites from meg. but this remix takes away the thing that i loved the most about the original: how short and sweet it was, and instead drags it out to almost double its original length with verses from beyonce that quite frankly i do not care for and just bring the song down for me. and more of a personal issue, but the ‚Äúokay‚Äù adlibs beyonce does in the chorus gets grating REAL fast for me. i dont know, i just dont see in this what everyone else does, i really wish almost any other single from this album was the frontrunner instead but alas

**DirtyRat583** (4): beyonces adlibs are genuinely so annoying. i want to love this, because the original Savage is AMAZING, and excluding that beyonces pretty good on this, but she put far too much work into this song and not in a good way

**Hulnia** (2): the original is so good but i really don‚Äôt like beyonc√© on it. like normally i don‚Äôt care about lyrics but her‚Äôs are so terrible here omg. and her voice sounds so off like she‚Äôs literally the best vocalist in the mainstream what actually happened here. at least she‚Äôs made renaissance to make up for it ‚ù§Ô∏è

**WaneDriptoc** (0): "claustrophobic". which I guess I could say for a ton of the album, but here Im waiving a surrender flag as passing my comfort zone. coming near the end of an album where the steam is running out...no they coulda left this off and as a 7". the 2020 trend of "one GIANT pop star works with another GIANTER pop star" is gonna suffocate me by 2025 prolly. look, i gave it a 5 at exchange because it just sorta existed to me and now i just don't think for a beyonc√© feature we're really earning or warranting it as a real special one; not even paula's ingenius burial comment can make me go "i wanna listen to this :)". im rounding down to an irrational hate 0 in honor. i know a bunch of people are looking at this going "you fucker". but i rate from the heart and i refuse to be anything but honest here. it just ain't my thing and if it played in the right circumstance I'd have to leave the room and go play minesweeper on my phone or skip rocks or some other shit. idk. big up to her grammy win tho!

**Overall Average**: 7.381 **// Average Controversy:** 2.050

**akanewasright**: This album is honestly pretty inconsistent for me, but when it‚Äôs good, its FANTASTIC. Doja Cat is one of the finest pop superstar we have, and this album retains a lot of the scrappy energy from Amala that I think she lost on Planet Her - just pure, goofy fun. People in the discord server pretty immediately predicted that this would get the highest overall average in the rate, which I guess it did in the end, but I don‚Äôt think people guessed it would get shut out of the top 5. Because all of her big contenders had people who actively hated them, Doja it didn‚Äôt have a prayer of making it much further. Still, she‚Äôs got the highest album average of the bunch, and that‚Äôs something to be proud of at least. ~~At least she‚Äôs got ‚ÄúBoss Bitch‚Äù~~

**DirtyRat583** (9.392): while amala IS better you cant deny the yass that this album is.

**vayyiqra** (9.083): An album that grows on you, let's see if Doja gets uh what's a metaphor for a bad thing happening to a cat. Sent to the vet. or something. again. I hope not! Critics and music nerds don't seem to have a high opinion of Doja's albums but this one is lots of fun idc! Maybe she uh has nine lives you know

**402man** (8.467): The funniest part about this album is that, despite being one of my most listened to albums of 2020, I only consistently listen to about half of the songs on the album - I didn't even listen to "Streets" until it became viral because I always tune out after "Talk Dirty". The run between "Bottom Bitch" and "Talk Dirty" is one of my favorites across any album, those four songs defined the year for me. I do come back to this album more than *Planet Her* because it reminds of that sweet spot in the early pandemic when everyone was biding their time, anticipating the virus would wither away so we could spend the summer making up for lost time ~~(which some people did anyway but I digress)~~. #justicefortiatamera

**fadedblue09** (8.333): Really enjoyed this album! My Doja knowledge prior to this was limited to Planet Her + a bunch of her early hits but this shows that her music is worth exploring and she‚Äôs a talent to look out for. Doja has a strong personality that keeps her audiences engaged, whether she‚Äôs doing rap, pop or R&B. It‚Äôs a shame that most discourse around her music is limited to her associations with a certain Swede, when her talent is already enough to say who she is.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.167): This album and Songs for You by Tinashe were the soundtrack of the last winter and spring before covid for me, which was a good time. so i'm probably going to be more kind on some of the more mid songs on the album because they're sentimental.

**sufjancaesar** (8.125): FUCK DR LUKE! That said, this is a solid album and an old favourite. It‚Äôs dreamy, glossy, unique and catchy throughout, maybe for the wrong reasons sometimes. But I‚Äôm charmed by it I can‚Äôt even front.

**plastichaxan** (7.867): The LGBT+ urge to comment ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just like me fr‚Äù in every song

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7.708): very solid and fun album that has a ton of catchy songs. So versatile as well. I‚Äôve never seen Doja as a direct follow up to Nicki (Doechii is closer for me) so the aesthetic is a bit dated for me but im glad she‚Äôs grown into her own more as time has progressed with Planet Her.

**bogo** (7.650): this album is really fun and much better than planet her, doja has actual personality here

**AHSWeeknd** (7.500): I like both of her albums in theory, but I wouldn‚Äôt really go out of my way to listen to them.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.292): more than anything else, i just love how much *fun* doja cat has with her music, you can really tell she‚Äôs enjoying what she does and it makes even her less good songs worth a listen.

**throwaway-7650** (7.083): I held off from streaming this album in full for years after I found out dr. l*ke was all over the credits and honestly... I wasn't missing out on too much. rules is a bop (not sure I ever streamed it full before this rate) and addiction was my favorite discovery here but overall there's barely any stuff I like that l*ke didn't touch. still super happy that doja shot to stardom from this era (say so remains a really good song unfortunately) and she did get my 11 but as an album, the other 2 cleared hot pink for me. I think I gave planet her a similar average actually so hopefully I can *love* her next album!

**WaneDriptoc** (6.917): my old roomie bought a doja cat shirt in summer 2k19. i never fucken got it. lowkey still don't even though it's great to understand "oh yeah she makes pop music i've heard and is pretty fun". exceptional shitposter that seems to just want to fuck around. endearing but also will rarely return to! about as good as parklife, jubilee, and guppy.

**sydschoon** (6.617): This album is indeed very hot, very pink.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.583): The only person here that can actually rap AND sing? (don‚Äôt get mad you know it‚Äôs true) Doja is pretty hilarious but also kinda cringe, and her lyrics are a bit‚Ä¶ lacking in maturity, so to speak. The throwback production sounds nice the first few times but starts to feel gimmicky after a while‚Ä¶ definitely NOT worth having a certain someone make this record‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt hate Doja, she‚Äôs fun and self-aware, and I think she knows what it takes to write some serious hits.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.500): the album starts off pretty solid but loses all the hype midway through, and we‚Äôre left with nothing but frustration

**Hulnia** (6.250): why does it randomly get bad at the end? üò≠

**prettybirbkotori** (5.542): the promised hot pink starts to turn beige when the second half hits

**MassiveThief** (5.500): always thought this album was disappointing. similar the Amala, the first song is really good and then it falls off hard.

**flava** (5.000): team please give Doja some competent people to produce her music

**akanewasright**: This was by far the album I was least familiar with coming into the rate, and I was a bit concerned that it would underperform a bit going in. Part of that is admittedly because I sort of think it‚Äôs the weakest album in the rate (I was not at all surprised to see like She Bad going out second), and part of it is because I knew that her album was the least pop in the group. Initially, it wasn‚Äôt doing very well at all, but as the rate went on, her top songs started to creep up. A deep cut of hers made day 3, the ever iconic Bodak Yellow crept up into the top 5, and finally, as the last few ballots came in, I Like It began to genuinely challenge Savage‚Äôs lead. At its peak, it was less than 10 points away from taking the lead from Savage Remix. The gap widened by the end, but I was happy to see I Like It flourish. I do think that Cardi‚Äôs album is the weakest, but her charisma, her one-liners, and her pure force of personality really do a lot to make this album stand out as a great debut.

**WaneDriptoc** (9.677): i used 2 believe we were forever waiting on a take from the afterlife; a confirmation on whether or not indeed Mark Fisher would have loved Cardi B. Well honestly I don't need that anymore because I could just rent the CD myself, listen to the album about 6 times, see a bunch of people bitch about it online, do some readings, do some other listenings, take my asinine takes and knowledge, and sorta just figure out if I would actually love Cardi B. And the truth? I think Invasion of Privacy is a colossally brilliant slab of automatically 2k18-dated hip hop for a massive pop audience about what it means to scale up when you don't realize you are going to SCALE the fuck up. critics may be too gung ho about where it stands in the greater scheme of things, but it was because nothing like this was supposed to exist and actually work. Cardi B truly sounds raw. Her flow, accent, and rhymes are not genius "king james bible" shit, but a real hustle logic that comes from a place and region that is honestly alien to me and this offers like the measliest of a breadcrumb into. Even if she occasionally sounds just as shocked at times that this is all coming together as much as every beat and feature around her, but also with a raunchy vocab of like 255 words she sorta just keeps self-actualizes and dunking at every necessary moment. She genuinely be riveting in ways I didn't anticipate. Trap's versatility is no bug, but a genuine feature--this is an African warrior sound that can be an equal-opportunity playing field for any and everyone, if they know how to self-actualize in their verses. And what a shocker! Her rhymes and rhythms are a special kind of hat trick that truly captures what happens when you go from rags to riches and also have NO clue what the fuck happens next, but also can eternally kiss off and fuck off anyone; she self-actualizes. And I do like that Cardi B seems absolutely baffled by and drawn to conspicuous consumption throughout the album, but never in a way that feels like "depressive hedonism". It's truly a joyous album that is made all the better by features from Migos and Bad Bunny and Kehlani and 21 Savage and even fucken wife guy Chance who show up and let Cardi work it and still come out on top. Rap still moves fast; everything captured here is like a polaroid of a glorious coronation, and I damn fucking enjoyed it.

**throwaway-7650** (8.185): cardi's rapping doesn't stack up with the other 2 so I had low expectations going in but I was very pleasantly surprised! yass

**AHSWeeknd** (7.923): This album isn‚Äôt as loud as I thought it‚Äôd be

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.769): An album that has high highs but meh lows. It gets a lot of praise but I (and many people) disagree that it‚Äôs ground-breaking or anything. It doesn‚Äôt have to be! It‚Äôs only goal is introducing the electric, exciting personality of one Belcaliz Almanzar, and it does that *very* well.

**Frajer** (7.654): I love Cardi but you can tell this came out a few years ago

**OutrageousWorldTour** (7.538): I am admittedly a huge fan of this album. It‚Äôs just so much fun and I have a lot of good memories attached to it. I don‚Äôt really care about ghostwriters or whatever - the songs bop and that‚Äôs all that matters to me.

**DirtyRat583** (7.492): pop base comment stans hate this girl like she doesnt make perfectly mediocre music. put your energy somewhere else girlies

**402man** (7.423): A solid first album, one that does a good job at showing Cardi's place in the industry. There's definitely a lot of room for growth, and her later releases have been more memorable ("Press", "Up", and "WAP") in particular.

**fadedblue09** (7.346): Listening to this made me realize Cardi‚Äôs rapping style gets really repetitive and stale after a while no matter how fun her personality is. Half of the songs feel like Bodak Yellow clones and the other half were‚Ä¶.cute attempts at doing something else. I get why critics hyped her back then, given how dry the female rap scene was at the time, but I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs outshone by her contemporaries.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.923): Cardi came out of nowhere and delivered a great debut

**sydschoon** (6.892): The album errrybody slept on when it dropped, one of the most underrated hip hop albums of the 2010's imo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.885): for a lot of people im sure they‚Äôre gonna say this is the worst album in the rate, but honestly i had a lot of fun with it. sure it has its fair share of misses but the songs i like on here i *really* like, and cardi has so much personality on every track which makes it a joy to listen to

**Bordersz** (6.623): This album did not deserve a Grammy at all. Insanity how timing, sending in a confectionary basket can land you a Grammy. Scammys.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6.231): its alright but I prob wouldn‚Äôt listen to it again.

**sufjancaesar** (6.115): Cardi‚Äôs ability to sell some generic beats, mostly underwhelming features and okay songs is mad. Her personality is one-in-a-million and the impressive selling point of an otherwise mediocre album.

**plastichaxan** (6.077): I like Cardi verses just fine but this was just a combination of features that did not work for me and songs that felt like they were done to bank on her success and put out an album, still a lot of good elements here but shrug

**flava** (5.962): there are too many men on this album

**bogo** (5.692): cardi b gets a lot of unwarranted sexist hate from miserable internet people and is definitely fairly overhated but at the same time, this album isn't all that great unfortunately. cardi isn't really versatile enough here to carry a whole album and while there are some great bangers on here there are also a fair amount of duds here as well that are a chore to listen to. it's a really mixed bag.

**prettybirbkotori** (5.615): for an album called invasion of privacy there is very little uniquely cardi here

**indie\_fan\_** (5.008): I think if Cardi made more music along the lines of Get Up 10 and Red Barz, she'd have more potential as a rapper. Because the way this album stands now, the amount of critical acclaim this record received baffles me to this day.

**oscarbrierley1** (4.769): I had only listened to the singles before the rate, i will only be listening to Ring after the rate. I find her and her catchphrases entertaining, but i find her songs annoying for the most part.

**vayyiqra** (4.615): Yeah, sorry Bardi gang. I have tried to like this album and don't think it's for me. I don't like Cardi's voice at all. I tried to be nice and respectful while commenting because I don't want to be a hater but I don't enjoy this album.

**akanewasright**: Megan is such a fucking gem‚Ä¶ I could rave for hours and hours about her prowess as a rapper, her resilience, and her pure charisma and likeablility, but I think I‚Äôve already said enough over the course of my host comments. While this album is‚Ä¶ a bit uneven, to say the least (having 3 songs of the bottom 5 definitely hurt her average here), and her going in more of a TikTok/pop friendly direction was understandably divisive among some longtime fans, her pure abilities as a rapper set her apart from the other two. She swept the bottom 5, but still wound up with the most songs in the top 10. Hell, at some point, I was worried that day 3 would be boring because of how hard Megan was sweeping. Cardi rose to the challenge, but even her biggest hits couldn‚Äôt outpace Megan. We knew Savage was going to win, but I didn‚Äôt see it coming how well this album would do.

**throwaway-7650** (8.318): some songs grew off me since 2020 but good news remains my favorite project here, as I expected. many highs, only a few lows (including my 0 unfortunately), and a ton of personality - it's easy to see why she's running hip-hop, men included. still need to tune into traumazine oops

**Roxieloxie** (8.071): https://twitter.com/allreactionvidz/status/1386380732822605826?lang=en

**AHSWeeknd** (8.059): Something For Thee Hotties may remain my favourite Megan album/mixtape but this is still a bop.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.882): I‚Äôve been a Megan stan since 2019, Tina Snow EP and Fever being her two best projects so far. I think SUGA was her and her (ain‚Äôt shit) management trying to build more and more with her hype, and when Savage became a breakout TikTok hit, ‚ÄúGood News‚Äù I think was trying to make Megan too pop and too TikTok and do it ASAP to capitalize on her popularity. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so mixed with some of her worst songs. However, a lot of the songs here I forgot how much I do enjoy, just quintessential Megan, so I‚Äôm glad I got to revisit those!

**402man** (7.688): There's some really fun tracks on this album but all the criticisms that it was made for Tiktok are... not without warrant. That being said, Megan being able to release this album is a testament to her resilience, and she truly does deserve better from both the industry and the rap community.

**bogo** (7.353): megan overloads her album a bit with some less than stellar filler tracks, but it's still a really fun time

**vayyiqra** (7.235): As a follower of Christ I preach the gospel which is Old English for "good news". Therefore I must also support Megan Thee Stallion. Real talk though I'm so tired I don't have many comments for this album and I'm getting burnt out after doing the last two albums but I promise I do like it! Megan is just so charismatic it's hard not to find something fun on here. 17 tracks is awfully long though so I was kind of struggling and don't feel my scores aren't settled but whatever I just needed to get my ballot in.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.218): there are more forgettable tracks on here than I remember but man the best moments are so good. Definitely the best album here

**sufjancaesar** (7.088): Megan is crazy talented and it‚Äôs on full display here. Her charisma and flow loads the album with catchy and fun bangers. There‚Äôs some effective sampling and production choices too. A bit of filler could be shaved down from this tracklist though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.000): So‚Ä¶ this is a surprisingly mid album to me? There are some bops but idk, the rest seems forgettable. Megan has a big fun personality, but I don‚Äôt think she shows it off as well as the other two do on their respective albums. At least Meg is still the one out of these three I‚Äôd most want to chill and watch anime with.

**WaneDriptoc** (6.918): i just bought a 40oz 805 cerveza i can rate this properly now no overdubs [e: yeah its a real 6.9/10 just like doja. this rate is good because you can totally stan one of these gals and not feel that way about the others even though they are all making "good" music].

**prettybirbkotori** (6.912): the album is the good news but the bad news is the amount of awful features

**oscarbrierley1** (6.882): the length of this album reeks of label interference. it could've been 12 tracks and been much better for it.

**DirtyRat583** (6.847): swing and a miss

**camerinian** (6.706): Thot Shit would have been the easiest 11 ever y'all have no idea

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6.618): Some solid tracks, some boring stuff too. I hope Megan gets to work with better producers in the future because she has IT

**Hulnia** (6.412): bye this is the most inconsistent album i‚Äôve ever heard

**fadedblue09** (6.029): This album is so frustrating to listen to. Megan is a really skilled rapper, probably the best among the three even, but almost every song has an offputting element that drags them down. Whether it‚Äôs the mediocre songwriting, the terrible production, or the questionable feature choices, it‚Äôs almost like she wants to sabotage herself throughout the album. Without a doubt a talented rapper, but ultimately it means nothing if she ends up wasting it on songs like these.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.941): easily the most mixed bag of all the albums here, the good songs are among some of the best in the rate and the bad songs are among some of the worst, and rarely does it ever seem to fall into the in between. i really like meg as a person but her music has always been really hit or miss for me and this album doesn‚Äôt really change my mind on that

**IIIHenryIII** (5.853): for whom? I, for one, did not vibe with this at all

**MassiveThief** (5.765): VERY frontloaded and just bloated in general

**sydschoon** (5.712): Now this is REAL hot girl shit
