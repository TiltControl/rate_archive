Hello ~~[bisexuals](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/872172420910444585/1050824779088805988/Screen_Shot_2022-12-09_at_9.20.03_AM.png)~~ everyone and welcome to the first day of the Main Rap Girls reveal!

A few weeks ago we asked you to score songs from Cardi's *Invasion of Privacy*, Doja's *Hot Pink*, and Megan's *Good News*. Today, we will reveal which of those songs have made up the bottom 14 **(#42 - 29)** of our main rate! We will also be revealing what made the **top 3** of our very acclaimed bonus rate!

Please join us in **[the Queup room](https://www.queup.net/join/main-rap-girl-shit)** at **3:30pm ET** (roughly an hour from now), where my cohost /u/akanewasright will be revealing the results live! We have plenty of original material planned, so it'll definitely be a fun time.

Here are some overall statistics for the rate:

* Number of participants: [91](https://pastebin.com/zdBd1SdA)

**cremeebrulee** (9): I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been put in a position to defend a Dababy song but Listen. This song is unfortunately great. DaBaby and Meg just genuinely have good musical chemistry together (listen to Cash Shit and try to disagree) and I love how their verses are inverses of each other. And even without DaBaby‚Äôs appearance, Meg has the natural charisma to pull this off, baby noises and all. ‚ÄúHis friends and his dad hate me / I broke his little heart he a crybaby ‚Äù gagged me a bit, sorry. While I do think there‚Äôs some other songs that deserved this last spot more, I‚Äôm not /that/ fussed about it coming last.

**akanewasright** (3): I‚Äôve never been very fond of this song, but like‚Ä¶ I do think that DaBaby‚Äôs actions have affected the reception of this one. I think there is *some* good in this song, and if DaBaby wasn‚Äôt who he was, he might be placing like. 4th last instead. But I can‚Äôt lie I don‚Äôt like this and never have. I think there are so many possible singles on this album, and when this got a video it felt like a waste to me. DaBaby and Megan have good chemistry ~~although she has good chemistry with everyone~~, but I just find this dull as hell

---

## **WAH WAH WAH**

**DaHumanTorch** (10): WAH WAH WAH

**Stryxen** (10): WAH WAH WAH

**Hulnia** (10): ughhhhhh why did dababy have to be so good on features? üôÑ

**BaconShoes** (9.5): i can‚Äôt make it not bop

**ricki** (9): dababy really could have been the gay approved rapper that collaborates with all our favorite girlies, but he had to go and be homophobic and stubborn about it

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): she looks so good in this video I‚Äôm sorry

**Awkward\_King** (8): they could never make me hate you

**frogaranaman** (8): that sample gets stuck in my head so often. but then my mind mentally connects it into ‚ÄúCrank That (Soulja Boy)‚Äù???

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ngl i still like this, but i get why its the first song out

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8): slaps

**1998tweety** (7.5): i must begrudgingly admit he ate

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): whoever decided to have that child squeaking in the background should be sued

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): she‚Äôs a fan of Melanie too???

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): its no Cash Shit but man‚Ä¶ they had real good chemistry & similar bars-but-make-it-pop sensibilities‚Ä¶ if only he weren‚Äôt‚Ä¶. well, him

**402man** (7.3): Why do I feel like this is going to be a high ranking for this song

## **These raters and their scores hate me**

**Frajer** (6): the rise and fall of DaBaby is fascinating

**impla77** (6): Backing sample reminds me of a low budget horror game

**musical\_pyn** (6): I really wish I disliked this more

**nt96** (6): Its giving water scented pussy

**prettybirbkotori** (6): thus begins the trend of songs where megan devours and her feature flounders

**runaway3212** (6): DaBaby more like CryBaby - Meghan probably

**slimboyfriend** (6): embarrassing for da baby to be homophobic and not even talented

**seanderlust** (5.5): i think this is a really good example of why dababy's career tanked so quickly - after his out-of-nowhere homophobic rant, i just don't think he was good enough to have staying power in spite of that. his verse here is a good example - it's fine. not great, not bad - just fine.

**babadork** (5): I have disliked DaBaby from the beginning of his career, and he ruins this song. I do like the beat and Megan‚Äôs portions.

**throwaway-7650** (5): is that saweetie I'm hearing saying that hook... like

**plastichaxan** (4.5): Ma‚Äôam this is a popheads rate

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): two minutes of this and dababy is more than one. the other minute is ok

**UselessTacooo** (4): everything I know about DaBaby was not learned by choice

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶was DaBaby always this bad?

**welcome2thejam** (4): Taking a ride in the DaBaby car one more time and driving it off the bridge

**starla\_** (3.5): no thank you to DaBaby and this is too short to have a real impact on the listener

**sydschoon** (3.5): this song bangs but it lost 3 points solely because I fkn hate DaBaby and any song he touches

**bogo** (3): fuck dababy! dude has one flow and it sucks

**DirtyRat583** (3): fortunately for megan and the feature i am excellent at separating the art from the artist. unfortunately the art is not very good

**fadedblue09** (3): utterly generic

**hikk** (3): even disregarding dafloppy, im not really a fan of this beat it's like . uncomfortable sob

**indie\_fan\_** (3): This would actually be much better if those annoying ass baby sounds were taken out

**oscarbrierley1** (3): i'm trying to ignore dababy. idk this song is just kinda boring. my favourite part is when she goes wahwahwah.

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): Glad we've left the DaBaby Era

**TiltControls** (3): really don't care for the production here

**vayyiqra** (3): :frowning2:

**Bordersz** (2.5): I never liked the song. The "cry baby" and baby aesthetic was always weird as hell to me. Shame bc the beat goes hard.

**camerinian** (1): I don't know about the rest of you but personally I try and avoid crying during sex

**flava** (1): every morning I wake up in cold sweats thinking about the fact that this exists, and that people allowed for this to exist

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): anyways

**jay** (1): collateral damage for dababy terrorism

**MassiveThief** (1): for some reason I always thought I liked this song but listening to it now I hate it. DaBaby's verse is horrificly bad

**shipperondeck** (1): sorry to tank megan but dababy sucks in every megan song that isnt cash shit

**WaneDriptoc** (1): im still reeling financially from all the money i invested in dababy's 2021 lollapalooza performance that was cancelled

**AHSWeeknd** (0): With or without DaLoser this song is awful.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): I‚Äôm listening to this one time for the rate and then Jesus willing I am never hearing this man‚Äôs voice again.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not strong enough for this I just don‚Äôt want to listen to it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): you know it‚Äôs bad when DaBaby is of course the #1 embarrassing part of this song but all the other factors are not far behind

**noavocadoshere** (0): the only good line here was the "her friends and her mom hate me/lay down on the bed, do the crybaby" that meg later flipped and repeated. what a terrible, pointless song with a terrible feature. nothing about this works for me.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): it is impossible for me to mentally seperate this title from melanie martinez. thankfully, this song is bad anyway.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): man... how did we fuckin listen to DaBaby for 2 years

**sweetnsoursauce11** (0): i fucking hate the crying sounds wow i forgot how much i loathe this song why was it a single why is it on here. it's even after my favourite megan song which makes it worse

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): aside from the fact that dababy sucks and shouldn‚Äôt be here, the beat here is probably one of the worst of all time, in what circumstances did anyone think that sampling BABY NOISES was acceptable for a song about sex, it genuinely makes me sick to listen to

# **Can we get a storytime**

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): this is simply a fan strip club bop y‚Äôall just don‚Äôt get it. I have only been to one (1) strip club one New Years Eve and my friend accidentally shot a firecracker in a waitress‚Äô face and we promptly had to leave.

# **Kpop comments**

**amr** (10): required viewing to fully understand the complexities of this song: https://twitter.com/nereris/status/1408305728167636998

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Please, I thought YG was that Blackpink record label

**runaway3212** (8): YG ruining things like always

**ricki** (2): yg didnt have enough terrorizing the kpop industry, he was aiming at the western audience too

# **Other comments**

**throwaway-7650** (10): YG is giving kim petras in unholy but make it a chorus

**WaneDriptoc** (10): easily one of the funniest fucking cuts on the album and still equally cunning. If you came out of a strip club circuit and you're gonna be a big rapper, your debut album is contractually obliged to include a "booty" cut on it. And "booty" is a psuedo-genre that evolved out of techno that specifically beefed up the bass and found a home in...strip clubs! How shocking! So if you can just accept it on that level, then we'll go ahead and beef up the drum machines and the bass all the way to wumbo. Also you're gonna start hearing YG just keep repeating "dat ass. dat ass. dat ass." until it becomes so beautifully meaningless--its just some sick babble on top of a fun beat; its "becomes jazz" when he then switches between "she bad", "she swag", "gucci bag" (amongst other bags), varying lines about consumption more or less. But god DAMN if Cardi B didn't clutch it on her verse that has all the energy of little mac about to take on Mike Tyson in a game of punch-out. the jesus wept line slaps, the lil' "huhs", the reference to a mixtape(?) that sounds like a call to horny times. this song is magic for its near 4 minute run time. oh to be at coachella when she did this ditty pregnant while twerking! it'd be my 11 if drip weren't in this. y'all hate fun i fear.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): it's like kreayshawn meets will.i.am meets cardi

**Awkward\_King** (9): FACE DOWN ASS UP I GOT PERFECT POSTURE

**jay** (8.5): yupppp


**BaconShoes** (7.5): kinda forgettable, but also good for a lil twerk moment

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I was gonna rate this lower but some of these bars are too good‚Ä¶ ‚Äúshorty says it‚Äôs all hers, why her thighs don‚Äôt match?‚Äù ‚ÄúWeave long, pussy bald, suck his dick through his drawers, lick the balls just because‚Äù

**Stryxen** (7): camp

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it's fun but repetitive

**babadork** (6.2): YG is probably on the track more than Cardi is, but he might as well have only said ‚Äúdat ass‚Äù repeatedly, because it‚Äôs the only thing that made an impression on me.

**1998tweety** (6): not bad but prob the most forgettable song on the album

**nt96** (5): its giving 2018 Soundcloud.

**shipperondeck** (5): yg supports bisexuals (by talking really close to the mic apparently)

**starla\_** (5): forgettable

**vayyiqra** (5): This really doesn't need to be this repetitive but at least it's funny especially when Cardi quotes the Bible. Couple of extra points because this made me chuckle a bit

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): "Listing brands" is one of my least favorite genres of rap songs

**seanderlust** (4.5): sorry but this chorus is so annoying. respect to YG but this is not it

**jackisboredtoday** (4.4): grocery bag

**celladonn** (4): This chorus is just too monotonous

**gt\_official09** (4): too repetitive for me i fear

**ignitethephoenix** (4): this song justifies all those people who were mad that this won hip hop AOTY at the Grammys

**noavocadoshere** (4): i see cardi decided to be subversive, and save the worst for last. i'm time traveling back to 2011, colored skinny jeans are on the horizon and travis porter is popular.

**camerinian** (3.5): look I'm sure this pops off in the strip club, but I'm trying to think about putting a score on this while I'm in the supermarket

**fadedblue09** (3.5): could've sworn this was like 6 minutes

**sydschoon** (3.5): I like YG but this feature is not it sis, first track on the album that is not enjoyable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): if someone told me this song was written in 10 minutes i would believe them

**prettybirbkotori** (2): world‚Äôs most insufferable hook?

**UselessTacooo** (2): I don‚Äôt know how I listened to this in full

**Hulnia** (1): is this what trap sounds like to eminem stans?

**isthesweetestcon** (1): that hook‚Ä¶.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (0): the hook is so bad im crying


# **well**

**welcome2thejam** (10): He Good

**frogaranaman** (9): shibe, shibe, shibe, shibe

**CrimsonROSET** (5): cardi b bad cardi b bad cardi b bad cardi b

**TiltControls** (4): on this? kinda

**IIIHenryIII** (3): dis ass

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Lazy comment

**bogo** (1): they're talking about the song

**flava** (1): he (YG) bad too

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): more like he down bad

**hikk** (0): this song bad

**plastichaxan** (0): Song title says it all but my God I can‚Äôt stand YG in this

**akanewasright** (7): I can‚Äôt defend this KJDFLSJKLDFS I‚Äôm sorry, I think this is cute and it makes me laugh, but this was a very bad choice for her to include on the album. I have to assume that she turned in a bunch of songs to her label and they went like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make her album worse and force this one on.‚Äù And yet‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt hate it. It‚Äôs too innocent to its own badness for me to feel anything but vague affection for. This is camp in its truest form, it‚Äôs just not very pretty.

**cremeebrulee** (0): I really tried to stockholm myself into liking this one (see tweet ricki linked), I think it was literally on the 6th listen when I decide I couldn‚Äôt do it. Megan singing was already kind of horrible, but the ‚Äúlalala‚Äùs take this up to war crime level. I tend to dislike most rap girls‚Äô pop pivots (some of Cardi‚Äôs cuts in this rate and Nicki‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Night Is Still Young‚Äù come to mind), but this one just feels so juvenile and strange.

**Awkward\_King** (10): megan cannot sing.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): If Don't Rock Me to Sleep has a million fans, then I'm one of them. If Don't Rock Me to Sleep has one fan, then I'm THAT ONE. If Don't Rock Me to Sleep has NO fans, it means i am still alive but have probably just decided to stop pretending it is good.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i'll defend this song idc if it's an unpopular opinion it's so fucking catchy and megan's singing is NOT as bad as ya'll think. tell me this doesn't get stuck in ur head

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is a good song idc all the 0s can go to hell idc

**1998tweety** (9): yall will rob this but at least it stands out on the album

**DirtyRat583** (9): why was this not a single. yes it would have peaked at like #31 but like it would be a good number 31!

**hikk** (9): i DO wanna see some fucking h&m!

**camerinian** (8): my rational, critical mind is telling me that Megan should not be making sung pop tracks, but unfortunately my popheads chimp brain is gay yelling too loud to hear what's being said

**plastichaxan** (8): The beginning of this just made me realize Megan could make an album so camp with her singing I really want it now

**fadedblue09** (7.5): this was refreshing, even if it's obviously some filler pop song

**babadork** (7.4): Most of the points are for the pre-chorus, which I think is really great.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7.2): this is kinda.. not that bad‚Ä¶

**Bordersz** (7): Love singing Meg, she should lay off the autotune and just learn how to properly sing.

**Roxieloxie** (7): ü´Ç it‚Äôs okay Megan you‚Äôre still a hot girl but I can take care of the vocals in our relationship

**vayyiqra** (7): 7

**welcome2thejam** (7): Not sure if this totally works for her, but I appreciate the swing

**noavocadoshere** (6.5): my taste is questionable bc i really wrote this off, but it grew on me the more i listened to it despite the lyrics. it's what i would've wanted crybaby to be: lighthearted and fun. a breath of fresh, unexpected air. it's filler but much appreciated filler, luv.

**amr** (6): I like everything but the chorus I can't lie

## **Put to sleep**

**celladonn** (6): This isn't exactly good but it's kind of cute

**CrimsonROSET** (6): she tried!

**oscarbrierley1** (6): this song kinda feels like a waste because she sings it. its a really fun beat, but she can't really sing and that's fine she can rap, she should leave the singing to the singers. if she had an r&b girlie sing it would be top tier on the album.

**seanderlust** (5.7): i don't mind megan trying something new and singing at all! i just wish the hook was stronger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This isn‚Äôt as bad as people were making it out to me but yeah she cannot sing.

**nt96** (5): I wanna like this but there's something off-putting about this song that I can't put my finger on

**UselessTacooo** (5): Meg you don‚Äôt need to sing we didn‚Äôt ask for this üò≠

**MassiveThief** (4.5): not a huge fan of this sterile kinda pop sound from Megan

**starla\_** (4.5): this is not good

**AHSWeeknd** (4): Megan was out here living her 80s fantasy.

**BaconShoes** (4): it‚Äôs cute and all but yeah

**DaHumanTorch** (4): "i'm a big girl so i won't cry"....like 5 songs ago: WAH WAH WAH

**impla77** (4): Who proposed the singing idea?

**indie\_fan\_** (4): The way this would be catchy as hell if someone who could actually hold a tune would sing this

**sa5m\_i\_am** (4): wtf is going on here meg‚Ä¶

**shipperondeck** (4): yeah... :/

**TiltControls** (4): megan's the one in danger of rocking people to sleep with this track

**WaneDriptoc** (4): WAY too hard a pivot into commercial.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): who forced her to do this‚Ä¶i know this is not something she decided she wanted to do voluntarily

**sydschoon** (3.3): not good, unfortunately not the worst track on the record

**flava** (3): It‚Äôs not that i dont think Megan should ever sing, it‚Äôs that she should‚Äôve probably chose to sing something that doesn‚Äôt require a flawless singer to do

**jasannn** (3): she sounds like she‚Äôs singing karaoke.

**jay** (3): blah blah blah lah lah lah

**musical\_pyn** (3): megan you don't have to do this it's okay

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): This is embarrassing who's making her do this

**prettybirbkotori** (2): she tried something different so i feel bad disliking it as much as i doüò≠

**Stryxen** (2): lol

**bogo** (1): what is this H&M fitting room music-core shit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): be serious

**frogaranaman** (1): there always has to be one flop of the album üíî

**apatel27** (0): The Synthpop revival and its consequences have been a disaster for the music industry.

**gt\_official09** (0): yeah im sorry meg love u but...we going to pretend we didnt hear that!

**Hulnia** (0): this sounds like it was made for the credits of a kids movie lol

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this song should have never been released, like we don‚Äôt need every rap girlie to sing especially when they aren‚Äôt a vocalist at all

**IIIHenryIII** (0): am I the only one getting an early Lady Gaga vibe from the first couple of lines?

**runaway3212** (0): what was the reason

**slimboyfriend** (0): Megan if you‚Äôre reading this pls don‚Äôt do this again

**akanewasright** (6): I‚Äôm gonna be honest, I‚Äôve never heard a single lyric in this song outside of Megan‚Äôs verse and the title line. I was taken aback by the comments about the ‚Äúsmall vagina‚Äù line because I‚Äôd literally never taken that line in at all. But even without that‚Ä¶ Megan has a pretty good verse on an ‚Äúalright‚Äù song. I‚Äôd consider this a cool discovery of a feature if it wasn‚Äôt literally a song on Megan‚Äôs album that she was billed first one. It‚Äôs not *bad* (not that bad at least), but it‚Äôs not really her song. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm gonna miss it very much.

**cremeebrulee** (3.3): Meg being relegated to essentially a feature here does not do this song any favors, since she‚Äôs very easily the best part. I almost wish she saved that verse for something else instead. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not too familiar with dancehall as a genre, but this is very much one of the more forgettable ones from the songs I‚Äôve heard. I would love to hear her do another dancehall song in the future, maybe with fewer sperm lines from the guest feature.

## **/r/ihavesex** 

**runaway3212** (8): yeah this isn't really a meghan track but who cares when it bops like this

**starla\_** (8): 2 points off for the word intercourse

**vayyiqra** (8): has anyone else noticed a lot of songs in this rate are kind of well you know ... nsfw ... ?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): ok you literally just gave up on trying with the title here meg

**impla77** (7.2): Is being told you have a small vagina a compliment?

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**frogaranaman** (7): need

**shipperondeck** (7): i forgot how over the place this album is

**indie\_fan\_** (6.9): do I even need to say it?

**noavocadoshere** (6.5): this is as questionable as how many drinks if "mixing the weed and liquor is creating the chemistry". but i do appreciate that meg tried something different here.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6.5): feels like an interlude not really a full song

**seanderlust** (6.5): "sexual intercourse" is such a corny hook but popcaan's voice is so smooth i don't mind tbh

## **Virgins**

**BaconShoes** (6): decent enough, but slightly out of place and it doesn‚Äôt feel like Megan‚Äôs song

**bogo** (6): despite the fact that megan sounds like the feature here and popcaan has some _interesting_ lyrics on here i still think it's kinda decent

**CrimsonROSET** (6): get it this song is about sex

**jay** (6): yuppp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i wish megan did more with the jamaican influence here, as it is she sounds a little bit out of place with the rest of the song

**welcome2thejam** (6): Thought the the title was Interlude and had my finger ready by the 1-5 keys

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Sounds like a Pink Friday outtake

**Stryxen** (5): obsessed with the way this album randomly falls off

**WaneDriptoc** (4.5): too horny, too streamlined, i feel like im in a la quinta pool. how the fuck i get here?

**babadork** (4): I can‚Äôt take the chorus seriously, but it‚Äôs not goofy enough for that to be the song‚Äôs appeal.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Megan took so long to show up for a sec I forgot what rate this was.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): you know it‚Äôs bad when me, Jamaican pophead and crusader against popheads‚Äô dancehallphobia admits this song kinda sucks.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): ‚Äúthat pussy good from birth‚Äù let‚Äôs not phrase it like this!

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Wincing at every line in this, it just gets worse and worse‚Ä¶ Who approved "long cocky"????

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): why did Megan let this man just mumble about small vaginas on this song

**isthesweetestcon** (3): would be better with more megan‚Ä¶

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): ok i hated this two years ago and it's nice to know i still hate it. the first minute drags soooo much and megan's part is the only thing that saves it from being a 0 bc it is actually v good. the rest of it i hate tho just to reiterate

**UselessTacooo** (3): nope

**Awkward\_King** (2): its not even that much of a dud its just less dynamic than the rest

**Bordersz** (2): Did not like this at all. Mustard was a letdown, and the sound was too different for me.

**flava** (2): the biggest crime of this Megan Thee Stallion song is that it is barely a Megan Thee Stallion song

**gt\_official09** (2): this is a song that surely exists!

**IIIHenryIII** (2): zzz

**MassiveThief** (2): who's braindead idea was it to have "sexual intercourse" repeated over and over as a hook

**prettybirbkotori** (2): a song this about sex should not be so completely unsexy

**camerinian** (0): why is this here. why did Meg/the label feel it necessary to give dancehall a try when that's clearly not where her strengths lie. why does it take over a minute for Megan to even show up. why is Popcaan on this album when he is so much worse at sex bars than Meg is. why does this beat sound so busy and stressful. why, on a Megan Thee Stallion album, am I suddenly grossed out by the idea of sex when it hasn't been a problem at all at any other point. I'm just astonished that a track can fail its assignment so badly in comparison to everything else and on its own. yuck.

**ricki** (0): dont refer to a vagina as tiny ever again in your life

**sydschoon** (0): this song never should have seen the light of day

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): ok this wins the worst feature in the rate award. cant believe im giving she bad a 1

**throwaway-7650** (0): same issues as cxh - catch up I fear

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ngl, it‚Äôs such a bop, and Megan enhanced it so well.

**Awkward\_King** (10): im very ill atm and quite unstable and emotional tell me why i started tearing up when this began its so beautiful

**bogo** (10): y'all better not fucking rob this this time or i will turn into a crazy person

**throwaway-7650** (10): butter bonus rate I miss u

**ignitethephoenix** (9): if this doesn‚Äôt win the bonus rate ‚Ä¶ xenophobia

**noavocadoshere** (9): i actually have managed to avoid the full song and it's remix until now, so this is a first listen. everything about this is a lot of fun. a v. cute song!

**sufjancaesar** (9): please let this win

**sydschoon** (8.8): we all know this is the remix collab we needed

**indie\_fan\_** (8.7): i'm one of the few on the sub that never disliked butter, dunno what to yell ya

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): When this rate gets 500 ballots because someone went rogue and promo-ed it on stan twitter.

**impla77** (8): kinda felt slightly like a collab picked out of a hat but still slaps

**plastichaxan** (8): I hope this wins the bonus it‚Äôs the best song in it by far

**vayyiqra** (8): dudes rock

**babadork** (7.7): I‚Äôve been very anti-men this whole rate, but I like BTS.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i cant believe you guys had to wait until a remix with a woman came out for you to admit this song is actually good, ill go down as a butter defender until the bitter end

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): MOPS the original

**1998tweety** (6): megan ate

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): BüëÖtter

**flava** (5.5): it‚Äôs just butter but someone with personality and charisma joined the song

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this sounds bigger than it actually is

**akanewasright** (6.5): I put off writing this comment because‚Ä¶ what is there to say? This song is just there. Cardi‚Äôs alright, Chance is Chance, it‚Äôs just completely unremarkable. I don‚Äôt think many people will miss this when it‚Äôs gone.

**cremeebrulee** (5.2): I think the fact this album *even* has a Chance feature dates it immensely. I can't lie, I think his verse is cute in a "lemme use this in an Instagram caption" sort of way, but it's not a standout on IOP.

---

## **Living their best life**

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): stand up to wifeshaming x

**welcome2thejam** (9): Man, remember when the reaction to his appearances was "Oh god, it's Chance the Rapper!" and not "Oh god, it's Chance the Rapper"

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): that chorus is REAL corny but it's kinda weirdly endearing at least

**WaneDriptoc** (8.1): god damn it cornball chance at it again!!!! "i turned Ls into lessons" is swirlie worthy, not skirt worthy. the man was truly a menace and needed to be dealt with. fortunately though, cardi b let's the notorious wife guy self-own himself later. because as many people in the youtube comments will tell you, "Cant believe people say she can't rap.. She has so many obvious and hidden messages..." which yeah sure. i appreciate that again, she just been through some things from dental surgery to drugs and making ends meet. she just punching up and name dropping beyonce and flowing pretty flawlessly. turns a 4/10 track into a 8 because again, this rawly didn't have to work, cardi (and megan and doja tbh) just dunks so naturally; almost all the guys who show up on this album should be sent to cornball island to duke it out.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): chance sweetie rhyming pompeii with dante from the devil may cry series?

**OutrageousWorldTour** (7): I find Chance‚Äôs parts really weak on this

**Roxieloxie** (7): Listening to them sing about living your best life while I‚Äôve been in line for the polls for 40 minutes

**runaway3212** (7): yass cardi but naurrr chance

**Bordersz** (6.8): Nice storytelling, loved Chance's verse.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): endearing energy from chance back when ppl liked him but this could‚Äôve been shorter

**noavocadoshere** (6.5): remove chance from best life and it would easily be a better song. cardi b and the b stands for back, because she carried best life.

## **Turned their Ls into low scores**

**starla\_** (6.5): not a highlight

**BaconShoes** (6): kind of a bop?

**gt\_official09** (6): cute but nothin really interesting

**ricki** (6): i know cardi was giggling writing that tom and jerry line

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): eh not for me bored me

**slimboyfriend** (6): ever since chance entered his Wife era I‚Äôve been getting less able to tolerate even his older stuff

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's fine, it's inoffensive and a bit of a manifesting anthem

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): "You need some Little Caesar's Pizza, I be hot & ready" She has such a way with words

**1998tweety** (5.5): Chance is just not my taste

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): anyone else forget that Chance was on this album on a relisten

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): why is chance here

**sydschoon** (5.2): would have been a higher score but since Chance dropped the big day I can't take him seriously anymore

**frogaranaman** (5): Chance feature was a jump scare

**UselessTacooo** (5): why the hell is this boring shit so long

**AHSWeeknd** (4): And Cardi?

**bogo** (4): looking back on it this should've warned us about the big day cause uh, chance is not good on this

**fadedblue09** (4): Chance the Rapper‚Ä¶.that's a name I haven't heard in a while

**IIIHenryIII** (4): well‚Ä¶ Chance stole the spotlight but couldn‚Äôt save the show

**MassiveThief** (4): chance has always been annoying huh

**prettybirbkotori** (4): this feels unfair because i find chance the rapper fundementally corny but the lyrics are also a mess

**seanderlust** (4): chance rapping about living his best life...man...you know when you're watching a greek tragedy and you feel that dramatic irony where you know something the characters don't?

**Awkward\_King** (3): chance's verse is the highlight here and i should NEVER be saying that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): The warning signs for the Big Day were there.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): this is a macklemore song in disguise

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the trainwreckords episode of Chance the Rapper is gonna serve

**isthesweetestcon** (3): but she makes a good point about twitter

**jay** (3): yu

**plastichaxan** (3): I told y'all (I'm a misandry)

**Hulnia** (2): i‚Äôm so glad the big day finally got rid of chance üóø

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): stop the men

**vayyiqra** (2): Verse 1 has maybe the worst lyrics in this rate

**camerinian** (1): not even considering the fact that it feels like a lifetime has passed since Chance was considered a top echelon rapper and all of his adlibs and quirks just feel super corny and forced, like, it's mad the dissonance between the chorus, which should be super celebratory and excited about this new life, and the verses which are super fucking defensive and bitter. It's not simple "dust off the shoulder" type shit, it's actually fucking pissy and obnoxious. Oh and the beat sucks and doesn't help the drab tone for what should have been a simple flex track. What the hell even happened

**throwaway-7650** (1): chance being a worse singer than cardi

**nickl00** (0): I do not like chance at all

**shipperondeck** (0): she really been fighting the twitter ppl for her whole career lmaoooo

**noavocadoshere** (7): if when your ex gets into a new relationship was a song. it's giving you're up at 2am on the fake acc you made for the sole purpose of befriending his new girlfriend so you could scrutinize every detail of her selfies. her latest post is from national comic book day, and she's sporting your ex's spider-man tee with leggings. so basic. you scoff, "bet she thinks tom holland is the best spiderman," before clicking on another selfie.

**vayyiqra** (7): The second of the "next-level mid" tracks, it's kind of boring but some of her lines are mildly amusing

**welcome2thejam** (7): Good but hell if this isn't a tired ass guitar sound

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.8): chorus is catchy

# **Does not come from these people** 

**1998tweety** (6.5): snooze a bit

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6.5): it is a song that I have listened to

**WaneDriptoc** (6.5): those are some chill mac demarco gtrs

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Why do Doja albums end so weirdly

**BaconShoes** (6): prob the least interesting on the album, but not bad at all

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is a ‚Äúcute 6‚Äù if I‚Äôve ever heard one.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): bestie this could have been scrapped and the album would have been excellent

**shipperondeck** (6): nice but it's not quite there

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): So many of these songs sound nice and smooth and then Doja ruins the mood by talking about pussy

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): stream Blood Orange & Carly instead

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Least favorite on the album, feels out of place

**Bordersz** (5): Forgettable.

**frogaranaman** (5): straight people fascinate me

**IIIHenryIII** (5): another mid one, ffs give us some bops

**Roxieloxie** (5): this back run is not good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): doja singing this to megan when she inevitably does better than her in this rate

**seanderlust** (4.5): "the best pussy come from wifey" - turning points usa

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): doja would've voted cruisin' for a bruisin' for songeniality

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): boring Steve Lacy-ish guitar type cut, clogging the Spotify POLLEN playlist vibes

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): would fit perfectly on planet her! (mid af)

**jay** (4): yup

**sydschoon** (3.8): another forgettable track imo

**camerinian** (3): astoundingly forgettable

**prettybirbkotori** (3): they wrote a good hook and then forgot to make the rest good

**impla77** (2.4): Is she referencing spiderman??

**cremeebrulee** (10): I think this is honestly my Good News 11? (I guess it's good I ended up giving it to something else seeing how much this flopped lol). I just love how chill Meg's flow is here, how catchy the chorus is, and Lil Durk's verse is honestly a really nice complement to Meg's.

**akanewasright** (9): Any song with a male feature was kinda doomed in this rate, so I had my expectations for this song very low, so I‚Äôm really happy with how this did. A few people saw what I saw in this song, which can be summarized as ‚ÄúGET HIS ASS MEGAN!!!!‚Äù She and Durk have *excellent* chemistry, and the back and forth of the chorus fucking eats. This deserved better, but I‚Äôm happy some of you guys liked it.

---

## **Last night was a movie bro**

**runaway3212** (10): Normally men feel so out of place on meghan songs but here lil durk just works, love the interaction between them

**WaneDriptoc** (9.1): "im talking asmr let me chew it..." is fucking cunning. anyways this is also booty music and this is gonna go out after She Bad isn't it? and it's about just as much fun tbh...both should be in the top ten imo

**BaconShoes** (9): makes me wanna throw it back hello

**Bordersz** (9): Standout track. Love the chemistry between the two. It has a nice level of raunchiness without being fake.

**jay** (8.5): yupppp

**bogo** (8): wasn't expecting much from the durk feature but he actually works pretty well here

**throwaway-7650** (7.9): what akanewaswatching on sunday night:

**babadork** (7.7): I like the he said/she said element of this song enough that I‚Äôm not going to say anything bad about Lil Durk.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): ‚ÄúLet me hear you chew it‚Äù I love her but that line makes me wince each time

**frogaranaman** (7): Megan Thee Stallion could make Avatar but James Cameron couldn‚Äôt make ‚ÄúMovie (feat. Lil Durk)‚Äù

**ignitethephoenix** (7): love it when the strip club has good chicken wings

**fadedblue09** (6.5): mostly unimpressive until she switches up halfway

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): fine but way more replacement level and less catchy than the rest of the album up to this point

**starla\_** (6.5): pretty good


## [**The movie in question**](https://youtu.be/KydqdKKyGEk)

**CrimsonROSET** (6): lil durk would go to the strip club for chicken wings

**RandomHypnotica** (6): its an upgrade from weyes i guess...

**shipperondeck** (6): experiencing tay keith burnout

**1998tweety** (5): lyrically this is gross, enough of this shit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Hello I‚Äôm visiting from the future and Megan has two EGOTs. Not for this song tho.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the dude has Megan right in front of him and he compliments the club‚Äôs chicken wings? what???

**impla77** (5): Would eating pussy actually make a good ASMR sound?

**prettybirbkotori** (5): i get why the feature is here but he does bring the song down for me

**sa5m\_i\_am** (5): im bored ngl. Not crazy about the feature either. My booty isnt shaking

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): How come almost every time a male rapper gets featured on these songs he makes things worse

**UselessTacooo** (4.5): they sound so tired ‚ò†Ô∏è

**Awkward\_King** (4): i overhated this, in reality its like.. fine

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): men ruin everything

**MassiveThief** (4): "shake that booty bitch shake that booty bitch shake th-" plEASE shut up

**nt96** (4): what you need is some adrenaline cuz wow durk you sound tired af

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): THE CHICKEN WINGS LINE??? LMAOOOOO

**camerinian** (3): durk what the fuck are you doing

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): soz but this is the definition of filler and adds nothing to the album. this would've been a fucking fantastic album if the songs like this were cut

**sydschoon** (2.2): pretty trash, Lil Durk made it worse

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): songs without men featuring: barely two minutes. song with men: almost four minutes. why

**noavocadoshere** (1): didn't think that lil durk's feature would make me MISS chance the magician. good god. a song that could've been saved had it been 2mins and solo bc meg isn't bad here. if i hadn't already used my one allowed zero, this would've gotten it.

**musical\_pyn** (0): this was legitimately the only song in this rate I wanted to skip so badly

**akanewasright** (6.5): I was generous in giving this score, since I skip it most of the time I listen to this album, but I do like Doja‚Äôs first verse‚Ä¶ ~~clearly a lot more than most of y‚Äôall do~~. But yeah this is one of the least remarkable songs on the album. It‚Äôs just kind of boring for most of its runtime. There‚Äôs a reason why this is the only Dr. Luke produced song Doja has ever made that the label he founded didn‚Äôt put out as a single.

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): It's pleasant, but it also kind of exists. Also did not realize this was Luke produced so I probably won't go out of my way to listen to it when it doesn't have any memorable qualities.

## **Shine bright like a diamond**

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): not her using the spank you very much line for the second song dlsichoahskg

**BaconShoes** (8): i like how it kinda builds up throughout

**CrimsonROSET** (8): dun dun dun duuuuuuun

**gt\_official09** (8): common autotune

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this grew on me much later than the rest of the album but now the chorus is heavenly

**UselessTacooo** (7): I wish I could make a comment about this but it‚Äôs just that unremarkable

**vayyiqra** (7): Here the album falls off a bit but this is still like "next-level mid" filler you know it's fine

**WaneDriptoc** (7): "I find it rare that in a whole album, all of the songs are perfect" - i mean basically everything here is like a 5 or higher tbh so honestly its a perfect 7.4. #shinebrightlikeadiamond

## **Dull**

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): ok i think these choruses are a little too grating unfortunately, and that chorus gets old quick

**1998tweety** (6): filler

**bogo** (6): not as fun as the other songs on this album imo

**jay** (6): yuppp

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): it didn‚Äôt offend me

**Stryxen** (6): mhm

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This autotune was a choice

**starla\_** (5.5): the autotune isn't really necessary

**AHSWeeknd** (5): The autotune wasn‚Äôt necessary‚Ä¶ neither was the doctor

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): More like Dull.

**frogaranaman** (5): e - View outsold

**IIIHenryIII** (5): d-d-dun-dun is the only thing preventing me from giving it a lower score

**sydschoon** (4.9): meh

**shipperondeck** (4): i used to pretend to like this idk why. it's bad. all i like is the autotuned parts of the verses

**Awkward\_King** (2): doja's insane talent almost saves this song... almost

**throwaway-7650** (2): please doja never use autotune again... blaming this on dr. luke ofc

**prettybirbkotori** (1): so forgettable it feels unfair to rate because i already don‚Äôt remember it

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): there's nothing on this one worth remembering

**akanewasright** (9.5): So uh‚Ä¶ creme and I conceived this bonus rate of having all of the big and uh‚Ä¶ controversial pop features from these artists that happened roughly around the time of their albums coming out. This excludes a bunch of rap hits the performers featured on. The issue with this is that Doja Cat has been WAY more careful than the other performers in the rate to not embarrass herself with her features. She generally selects features very carefully, which means there weren‚Äôt as many options, ~~especially ones that would be funny to put in the rate~~. We needed a third pop song from Doja, and this happened to come out *right* around the time *Hot Pink* came out, so it seemed like a perfect fit. I‚Äôm glad this didn‚Äôt win, because this pick sorta felt like payola from the two of us, but I‚Äôm happy it made it pretty high. Support a *Sunshine Kitty* rate, I promise there are better songs than this on that album!

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): This was definitely host payola on our parts so I‚Äôm glad to see this get second place! Doja‚Äôs verses here feel reminiscent of her stuff in Amala and it slays. Just overall cute, groovy, unexpected collab

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Tove Lo and Doja‚Äôs voices go perfectly together.

**BaconShoes** (10): when two powerful forces of slay collide on an album that is centered around a stoned kitten who also serves as a metaphor for sunning your vagina‚Ä¶magic happens.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): gonna tell myself this is Ibiza music knowing I‚Äôll forever be too poor to find out

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): not you <3

**shipperondeck** (9.5): finally a good song

**noavocadoshere** (9): i see tove lo and doja cat and i'm gonna enjoy it before it's even started. this is a phoned in verse for doja imo, but hey. my heart goes dum dum for them.

**starla\_** (9): this was a good Tove Lo era

**seanderlust** (8.5): [E‚Ä¶](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/008/Screen_Shot_2018-04-25_at_12.24.22_PM.png)equally lost

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): wtf how have i never heard this before it's so GOOD

**1998tweety** (8): they mothered

**vayyiqra** (8): It is nearly the year of our lord 2023 and we're listening to a trop-pop rhythm on a song by Tove Lo and the weird thing is, it's pretty good somehow?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): not the best from this album but still Sunshine Kitty rate WHEN

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): honestly as far as tove songs go this is not my favourite but in this bonus it might as well be Habits

**bogo** (7): with a title like that this song is destined to tie at #2 or something

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A bit of a bop

**welcome2thejam** (7): If I graded this bonus on its own curve this would be a 10

**sydschoon** (6.6): i fucks w it, nothing crazy tho

**nt96** (6): bear's ok, dont like Toovaloo's voice tho

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): its a song but not sure its the best from either artist truthfully. it does nothing for me

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): literally had no clue this existed, somehow it‚Äôs very forgettable though

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): this song is such a nothingburger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Gotta do my best to not give a mediocre song too much credit because of what it‚Äôs surrounded by.

**frogaranaman** (5): title describes both of them on the track

**plastichaxan** (5): Damn not even the Tove Lo song in the bonus is good

**prettybirbkotori** (4.5): i like both artists here but this is not the beat for them

**Awkward\_King** (4): im sorry tove

**IIIHenryIII** (4): equally forgettable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): the best part of this song was the music video when doja‚Äôs voice was coming out of tove lo‚Äôs fursona

**TiltControls** (4): eeee-heee eeee!

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Tove Lo‚Äôs label cashed in that last check from Habits huh

**runaway3212** (3): Doja tries her best but she can't save this song

**akanewasright** (4): I usually like it when Cardi‚Äôs lyrics get really out of pocket (‚Äúboth you bitches pussy I think y‚Äôall should scissor‚Äù from ‚ÄúTomorrow 2‚Äù is funny as hell, for example). But this song is just too dour and serious for me to enjoy any of the weird curveballs she throws at us. LIke I can‚Äôt really do anything but take ‚Äúthinkin bout stabbin you‚Äù completely seriously, and then I start going :/

**cremeebrulee** (4): ~~This is a Summer Walker song.~~ Yeah, I obviously can't condone everything she's saying in this track, but it does capture that very specific type of anger you get when you've been betrayed. But I feel like the chorus absolutely deflates anything this has going for it. (I also did not realize that wasn't Cardi on the chorus until embarassingly late).

---

## **Summer Walker stans**

**1998tweety** (10): I know this objectively is probably not that good but she ate it up

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly this is a fucking banger, shoutouts to the chorus vocals

**gt\_official09** (10): actually so amazing absolutely love cardis delivey on this one

**throwaway-7650** (10): not the guest vocalist being a songwriter for lea michele

**babadork** (9.7): I don‚Äôt remember liking this song so much when this came out, but it really grew on me doing this rate. There are a lot of vicious lines in this song, but somehow ‚Äúcall your mama phone, let her know she raised a bitch‚Äù is the best one. The vulnerability of hearing her singing voice really adds to the song.

**isthesweetestcon** (9.5): officially my favorite cardi b song

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): this might be my favorite discovery of the rate. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs perfect but it hits a certain vibe the rest of the album doesn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs cool for that.

**fadedblue09** (9): probably benefits from following several mediocre tracks, but I enjoyed this! The chorus is very Doja-ish too

**IIIHenryIII** (9): it‚Äôs always the fucking phone, why are cheaters so dumb?

**runaway3212** (9): a better album than Cardi

**WaneDriptoc** (9): this one could have sucked so bad but again...this Cardi B lady like is really truly so goddamm cunning through verses about someone cheating on her. She's so pissed she'll serve you a bowl of cereal with bleach BUT she's also so disappointed in you because you didn't cheat on her with a bad bitch, just a regular ho. Her ability to trap men in rock and a hard place scenarios really top tier. i jus wanna be ali tamposi saying "ITS KILLING ME KILLIN ME KILLIN ME OH!"

**TiltControls** (8.5): the chorus really elevates this for me

**noavocadoshere** (8): here we go again, being won back with the more vulnerable tracks.

**seanderlust** (8): toxic relationship banger. also the better infidelity cut on this album

**plastichaxan** (7.5): This is kinda camp this is what Camila thinks she serves

**sydschoon** (7.5): one of my favs on the album. this track is raw, honest, and emotional which is very rare to see in this genre of music. a nice change of pace imo

**impla77** (7.3): Theres a lot to unpack here

**frogaranaman** (7): this is literally just a Doja Cat song

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i acknowledge this isn‚Äôt healthy for a relationship, there can I give it a good score now?

**oscarbrierley1** (7): revenge porn slay??? The morality of some of the lyrics are questionable, but her singing sounds decent so i'll give that a pass.

## **Does not know their partner's passcode**

**starla\_** (6.5): who is singing this chorus?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): i mean like it's a filler song but it's not a bad filler song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): SHE SAID IT SHE SAID THE ALBUM TITLE IN THE LYRICS

**indie\_fan\_** (6.4): Love the verses, can't stand the singing in the hook

**BaconShoes** (6): not my favorite chorus moment, but not a bad song

**Roxieloxie** (6): well

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): I‚Äôm so sad :( I‚Äôm going to murder you brutally :(

**Bordersz** (5.5): Nice sample, lyrics toxic as hell.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): i forgot this track existed so i thought this was the sza collab and was promptly horrified that they autotuned sza into a white girl.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The aggressiveness of the lyrics contrasted with the lofi music and chorus is so hilarious

**welcome2thejam** (5): Hate this chorus, it's got a "really annoying electronic/alternative-ish song that plays on tiring phone or computer commercials" sound

**camerinian** (4.5): I appreciate that Cardi is conveying a lot of dark feelings in a really authentic manner for her and I see that, and also aesthetically I have no desire to listen to this again

**RandomHypnotica** (4.4): i see what she was going for... but it didn't work, it comes across like some sort of diet love the way you lie

**prettybirbkotori** (4): probably the most generic track on the album but the singing is really good? i was shocked that that‚Äôs cardi

**AHSWeeknd** (3): ‚Äúkeep it‚Äù ‚Äúit = cb2‚Äù /s

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): we absolute need to leave this kind of chorus in the 2010s

**ricki** (3): 6789998212

**amr** (2): :).

**bogo** (2): cardi sounds really unpleasant and downright toxic on here, i do not like it at all

**shipperondeck** (2): lyrics are funny but otherwise this is so bland

**Awkward\_King** (1): im sticking to my guns in 0'ing ring but this is kinda making me laugh ngl

**jay** (1): y

**vayyiqra** (1): The worse, more boring, more toxic counterpart to "Ring", I really hate this song. All the lyrics are bad but the chorus is also so bizarre and out of place; it makes me think "this sounds like it could be a goddamn Melanie Martinez song" (?!) which is so cursed.

**akanewasright** (7.5): I‚Äôm honestly surprised people don‚Äôt like this one, like that seems like a lot of feelings to have about a song like this to me. It‚Äôs easily the least remarkable song in the front half of the album, but I never feel a need to skip it or anything. Regardless, this very much makes sense as a day 1 cut, and I get why it‚Äôs leaving now.

**cremeebrulee** (6): In a rate with a plethora of male features, Smino seems to almost fade into the background of this one, I'm really struggling to recall anything from his verse after the song ends. This chorus is also mildly irritating, it's definitely bottom 3 on the album.

---

## Good kitties

**Awkward\_King** (10): if smino gonna do one thing its gonna be kill a feature

**IIIHenryIII** (10): yes please

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): Doja Cat is contractually obligated to say kitty in all her sex songs

**UselessTacooo** (7): lelelelelelelelelelelelleleleeee lelelele

**sydschoon** (6.5): production goes off, good feature, not the biggest fan of the chorus/hook

**bogo** (6): this is what justin thought he was doing on yummy

**frogaranaman** (6): cats when they lie

**Hulnia** (6): i like most of this but that chorus is disgusting omg

**jackisboredtoday** (6): The verses here are solid but this hook feels so clunky it brings them down

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): one of the weakest on the album for me but it's still better than average lol

**amr** (5): U never know what energy smino is gonna bring onto a song he's like the personification of a swing state

**jasannn** (5): this would‚Äôve worked better as an interlude later in the album

**starla\_** (5): annoying

**welcome2thejam** (5): every rate about doja cat getting accepted as if ratcom didn't find evidence of cannibalism in her mid song she made in 2019

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): Cardi learned from the Beyonc√© school of collaborating with your partner more times than any of your fans want you to‚Ä¶ but more times than Bey are those collabs are pretty good. This song‚Äôs hook is infectiously catchy, it‚Äôs probably why I saw it parodied in every way possible on social media in 2018.

**akanewasright** (7): This song is basically just a Migos song, so I‚Äôm not too surprised it‚Äôs just day 1, but I am happy to see some appreciation for it. Migos were, in fact, pretty good, and their part of the fun is honestly a lot of fun. I‚Äôm not as into Cardi‚Äôs part, but she‚Äôs not bad here either. This is a bit of a shrug and a ‚Äúyeah its cute‚Äù for me, but since I basically adore 95% of what‚Äôs left in the rate after this, I get why this had to go now.

---

## **Came through typing, type type**

**WaneDriptoc** (11): saintly 11 dispatched to one of the most brilliant pieces of post-Culture work the Migos showed up on. I've been told the Migos were brilliant artists make an era spanning concept work about "dabbing" that kept flirting with mainstream attention and culminated in Culture 1. Truly they had a "im gonna call it jazz" delivery that is wickedly exuberant and playful and sorta the world bended to their will for a second in mainstream pop music. If Cardi was gonna go big AND also marry noted "Father of Four" Offset, then she was gonna need to have a migos cut that has real talent show energy for the start (the opening beat sounds like it was made on a playstation in a hazy basement and I love it). Somehow though, Cardi B is perfect in sync with them and their whole deal. Which is needed because this is really just a cut about some guys being dudes blowing steam about being famous and trying to stay above the snake line. And yeah it just turns into a migos song that just slaps tbh not really sure what more to say there besides i like the interplay of their voices and the effects that make it feel like stones skipping or all the hitmarkers of a well timed stealth bomber racking up a multi-kill. In the face of takeoff death, the entire thing feels even more like a real document of a moment where "yeah this was a thing going on in pop that was a moment". prolly one Im romanticizing too much, but GOD DAMN can't do drip drip like this again!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): u/WaneLietoc‚Äôs love of this song has rubbed off on me

## **Ice**

**runaway3212** (10): This being super repetitive but me still stanning hard

**BaconShoes** (9.5): had me shakin my booty in my chair doing my work

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I‚Äôm surprised this wasn‚Äôt a single.

**bogo** (9): takeoff's verse on here is really great, may he rest in peace

**celladonn** (9): DRIP DRIP

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I think I prefer the white washed version, aka bejeweled

**Roxieloxie** (9): Migos :) <3

**shipperondeck** (9): not to be misogynistic but just make this a migos song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.8): this song grew on me so much throughout 2018. the chorus is simple and infectious

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I wanna hear a cover of this song on panflute

**sydschoon** (8.3): I GOTTA STAY OUTTA GUCCI, IM FINNA RUN OUTTA HANGERS

**prettybirbkotori** (8): is it bad that this is a better migos song than a cardi b song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): "Mac & cheese in the bowl, how it sound? I got that gushy" and that my friends is what we call foreshadowing

**welcome2thejam** (8): "Mac n' cheese in the bowl, how it sound / I got that gushy" What Did She Know?

**MassiveThief** (7.5): takeoff went hard. RIP

**seanderlust** (7.3): RIP to takeoff, who also incidentally has my favorite verse in this song

**1998tweety** (7): served a bit

**CrimsonROSET** (7): those fortune cookies look like lemons

**jay** (7): yuppp

**Bordersz** (6.7): Takeoff's verse added 1 point to the song. His verse slid. Cardi's ad-libs were better than her verse.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): can we get a plumber in here (not mario)

## **Water**

**camerinian** (6.5): god Migos really saturated their market super quick huh

**starla\_** (6.5): RIP Takeoff. This track is a bit more low-energy than I'd like

**nt96** (6): its ok. Rip Takeoff tho

**OutrageousWorldTour** (6): I wish Migos weren‚Äôt on this

**UselessTacooo** (6): this is why you dry off with a towel

**vayyiqra** (6): The adlibs are really funny but they add character

**amr** (5.5): I appreciate the vibe but the hook is pretty annoying like I'm not having fun sorry. wane don't look

**AHSWeeknd** (5): peak 2018 production

**frogaranaman** (5): this is one of those ‚Äúyou had to be there‚Äù songs. unfortunately, I was not there,

**ImADudeDuh** (5): not me learning that WAP wasn‚Äôt the origin of Cardi saying mac and cheese is what good pussy sounds like

**Stryxen** (5): hate the chorus a little ngl but the verses are good and I wanna say this will still grow on me. 4 years later

**TiltControls** (5): I wish the production was a little more pronounced cause it is good but it fades into the background behind the bass

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): you guys should probably call a plumber

**ricki** (4): why is migos the best part of the song:(

**throwaway-7650** (4): jack harlow type beat

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3.5): filing ‚Äòmigos rapping drip drip‚Äô under ‚Äòsounds i wish i can unhear‚Äô

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): none of these verses sound complete

**gt\_official09** (3): idk about this one! the ICE part sends though

**isthesweetestcon** (3): too many drip drips

**noavocadoshere** (3): came through drippin' droppin', dripp drippity drop.

**indie\_fan\_** (2.5): Yeah migos outshined Cardi here. Also, this beat giving elevator waiting music.

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): words ruined by the internet part 6523

**akanewasright** (7): This score is honestly a little generous, but I am a bit more positive on this than some people (creme for one). I think a lot of it is pretty compelling honestly, the verses have some solid storytelling in them. I think I gave them a little more credit than is warranted because I do have similar issues to this as I do with Thru Your Phone, but they‚Äôre solid ‚ÄúCardi shows another side of herself‚Äù material. A good third single to show that she was a three dimensional performer. But man‚Ä¶ Cardi B truly cannot sing at all. This song has 4 notes in it and she still can‚Äôt pull that off. It‚Äôs just nails on a chalkboard. I was probably a little generous to this because the SNL performance, where someone sings over her, is excellent and iconic as hell.

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): I used to hate on this more when IOP first came out, but I think I've softened on it over time. Even then I just can't take this as a song too seriously sorry üò≠ This production just feels so clownish (derog) and that chorus feels so clunky. I feel like there must've been a way to rewrite this into a song that could actually showcase Cardi's talent because the lyrics are definitely sincere and well-written, it's just a shame they're delivered like this.

---

## **11'd Ex Factor**

**joeeswift** (11): her best song, she'll never top this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i fucking hate infidelity with a burning passion, and im so happy that cardi made a song about her anger towards the subject as well, its so vulnerable and raw and that truly makes it stand out in the rate

**amr** (10): it feels a bit blashpemous to like this as much as I do but it's so fun I really can't hate

**CrimsonROSET** (10): a two time rate LOSER (three if you could nice for what) (four if you count this)

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): This song made me self-conscious that I don't know the name of many people that I have slept with

**throwaway-7650** (10): going to pretend this is the SNL performance so to give it a 10

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Not sure why I have a soft spot for this, it‚Äôs very minimal and her singing isn‚Äôt exactly the best‚Ä¶ and yet it still speaks to me. It‚Äôs a rare moment of vulnerability on an album full of confidence and swagger

**WaneDriptoc** (9): i appreciate that so much of this album may or may not be about noted "father of four" offset and how much cardi b may or may not want to destroy noted "father of four" offset; for cheating more or less. this is a lady with all lowercase lyrics that are rlly ALL CAPS feelings

**noavocadoshere** (8.5): i'm so thankful i decided to look up the tommy and keisha reference to be certain bc i thought she was referring to tommy and keisha from belly and was confused...excuse me, my age is showing lol.

**starla\_** (8.5): as cute a bop as exists on this album

**impla77** (8.3): the vitriol in the verses is so engaging, I wish the chorus was better

**gt\_official09** (8): she gagged him!

**isthesweetestcon** (8): in her walter white tread carefully era

**runaway3212** (8): Honestly she doesn't have a ballad voice nor does this seem to be a particularly wise song but! it slays so have you considered that?

**1998tweety** (7.5): underrated, the 2nd verse ate

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i think cardi's verses are kinda weak here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): this is enjoyable but missing a little something special to give it a higher score

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): [be careful... the floor and the wall just switched](https://youtu.be/beBYb83lvkk?t=150)

**BaconShoes** (7): Not my favorite, but it was a moment and I appreciate the emotion and writing behind it. Maybe not her singing as much

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): Cardi wouldn‚Äôt last a day in LE SSERAFIM

**welcome2thejam** (7): Honestly the hook is super catchy, I think I'd like this more if it didn't feel like the opposite of what I want from a Cardi B track

## **Comments with a fragile label on it**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I actually like the chorus of this quite a bit but the rest of the song is pretty boring.

**sydschoon** (6.2): not the best singing from Cardi, but extra points for the emotion that comes w the song

**bogo** (6): cardi really needed a guest singer on the hook because she is not a good singer

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the verses are okay but not a fan of Cardi‚Äôs singing I‚Äôm afraid

**plastichaxan** (6): Extra points for saying culo and putas!! That's the latina representation I want

**seanderlust** (5.5): i hope the stealing accusations aren't true - i would hope cardi has the common sense to not steal something so thoroughly unremarkable

**AHSWeeknd** (5): It‚Äôs tracks like these that make me want to comment ‚ÄúAnd Cardi?‚Äù In PopCrave‚Äôs replies

**camerinian** (5): what tone is this song even going for

**fadedblue09** (5): the flow and delivery here sounds awkward

**flava** (5): Cardi‚Äôs vocal performance here is serving the shakey emote

**IIIHenryIII** (5): are you sure that‚Äôs not a threat?

**oscarbrierley1** (5): her singing sounds particularly bad on this to me. like theres no production or anything to even attempt to make her vocals sound good so it just sounds like a demo. throw any r&b singer on the singing part and it would immediately be an eight, because the rap part and the instrumental is quite good.

**prettybirbkotori** (5): i forgot this song existed but i remember liking it more than this

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): how many times will we rate Ex-Factor before it finally wins

**vayyiqra** (5): Uh I like the Latin influences but all her lyrics are in one ear and out the other

**Bordersz** (4.5): She cannot sing, but the song is catchy and the sample+production is fire.

**apatel27** (4): The Lauran Hill sample ain't it

**shipperondeck** (4): dont like her singing

**UselessTacooo** (4): omg circus horns let‚Äôs go to the clown store

**ricki** (3.5): she should have gone on ig live instead of making this

**jackisboredtoday** (3.1): this is cardi‚Äôs version of right thru me except she‚Äôs way less capable of watering herself down for pop radio in appealing ways

**frogaranaman** (3): ?

**jay** (3): yu

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): this sounds horrible, she was so indie for this

WaneLietoc: getting worried people didn't listen to the cardi b album on CD 5 or 6 times at 8:15 AM in the morning, via a honda fit car stereo system, with the bass turned up to +5 and the treble at +6; like if you did this im gonna garauntee you'd give some cuts .2, maybe .5 more points and not say things like "this production is clownish". well...maybe it is tbh! but no one likes a sad clown creme, they just want a soundcloud

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): This was not just Jaguitions promo I promise, obviously we had to put Meg & Doja‚Äôs one collaboration in this bonus rate. I‚Äôm gonna be honest, 34+35 is one of my ‚Äúhead empty, no thoughts‚Äù songs so this‚Ä¶ also just kinda exists. Doja‚Äôs 69 lyric is pretty funny, and the three of them look like they‚Äôre having fun in the MV, but honestly I don‚Äôt seek this or the original song out that much. Ngl, I was pretty sure this was going to win the bonus just off Ariana‚Äôs name alone, but shockingly enough that did not happen.

**akanewasright** (6.5): I actually like 34+35 alright, and I mostly like Meg and Doja‚Äôs verses‚Ä¶ it just feels weird and unfocused to me. I think we knew this would be top 3 in the rate just by virtue of the names involved/it being the least hated big hit here, but I do think it‚Äôs the weakest of the ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùgood‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù songs in the bonus rate, so I‚Äôm glad it eventually settled as #3

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Doja and Ariana kill it every time, add Megan and I‚Äôm deceased.

**Awkward\_King** (9): im ngl i cant analyse this its just fun

**nt96** (9): = 4+5

**welcome2thejam** (9): If I graded this bonus on its own curve this would be a 40

**starla\_** (8.5): this song is kinda cringey but this is the superior version

**sydschoon** (8.1): better than the original forsure

**BaconShoes** (8): a jam tbh

**musical\_pyn** (8): a good remix in my bonus rate? it's more likely than you think!

**noavocadoshere** (8): it's ari and meg and doja. has some memorable lines but overall doesn't really...do much for 34+35. i still don't know how i feel about this, but i'm always, always, always here for more collabs between our girls.

**impla77** (7.6): two main rap girls for the price of one

**Bordersz** (7.5): A lot better than the original verson.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): remix is definitely better than the original but the original wasn‚Äôt amazing lol

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7.5): meh its ok but I don‚Äôt run to play it. the refrain is super catchy tho

**TiltControls** (7.5): the production sounds like its from a forgotten wii channel

**bogo** (7): wow, can't believe we're rating the wii shop channel music again so soon

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): sure i guess

**plastichaxan** (6.9): Doja and Megan really saved this song but I was not going to miss the joke

**runaway3212** (6.9): the original eats this up

**babadork** (6.8): I do like this more than the original.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Remember when this remix got a music video but POV didn‚Äôt?

**vayyiqra** (6): This really doesn't need to exist but it's not awful

**akanewasright** (6.5): I was a little generous to this, but there are moments where I find this song enjoyable. Not very many, but it has grown on me from when I first heard it. I mostly just find this boring, but

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): The chorus teeters between annoying and kinda good for me, tbh now it's sounding kind of good but I think exposure therapy just works really well on this album for me.....

**AHSWeeknd** (10): You can hear the Nicki inspiration here, but Doja does it better

**welcome2thejam** (10): Glad Jason Derulo related trauma doesn't prevent me from thinking this sounds fantastic

**noavocadoshere** (9): this is like a lullaby for dirty talking, and i love it.

**TiltControls** (9): the background vocal loop on this is so good

**CrimsonROSET** (8): [twitter draft] nebby fancam to ‚Äòi be in my bag‚Äô

**Frajer** (8): horny bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): jason derulo has been real quiet since this one dropped

**1998tweety** (7): half of this is really annoying and the other half is good

**Awkward\_King** (7): i kinda think the production never really lives up to the first 40 seconds but its still good

**BaconShoes** (7): i kinda forget about this one sometimes, but it‚Äôs pretty good

**gt\_official09** (7): she's just that girl

**runaway3212** (7): this isn't good but im very entertained by it

**Stryxen** (7): takes a little too long to get as good as it does

**throwaway-7650** (7): her vocals sound so angelic on this song omg. we ignore the rap

**akanewasright** (3): The popular consensus on this song seemed to be ‚ÄúCardi isn‚Äôt great, but Kehlani‚Äôs part is pretty good,‚Äù and‚Ä¶ I have to admit I‚Äôm a little confused by that. I really like Kehlani in general (stream blue water road), but I find their chorus kind of limp. The bridge is good, and I do love the way they sound on the song, but this is one of their weaker features, and Cardi kind of matches that energy.

**cremeebrulee** (2.6): Misandry on this sub is so unchecked, why did y'all let one of Kehlani's worst features almost get into Day 2 djfghsdkfjhd

---

## **Will be streaming Blue Water Road after this**

**runaway3212** (10): kehlani has one of the best voices in pop music we need her to be a main pop girl

**seanderlust** (10): kehlani sounds so gorgeous here UGH. stream blue water road

**throwaway-7650** (10): kehlani parent of all time

**WaneDriptoc** (9.2): omg cardi b brought non binary icon kehlani in to talk about ghosting. i love this binches so much! no fucking reason for this to be so sensual and absolutely oozy but god i need a 32oz dry irish stout to cry through this one; fuck this song has strong "i wanna fuck my ribs" energy that only the mr. spriggs bbq advert ever achieved. RING RING RING RING!!!!

**402man** (9): Cardi B's "4 Minutes"

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Kehlani carried

**1998tweety** (8.5): a bit repetitive but this deserved to smash a bit

**starla\_** (8.5): I can't give anything with Kehlani a low score

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): kehlani did what they had to do

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): kehlani you can make my line ring any time

**TiltControls** (8.5): one of the more catchy slow songs from Cardi thanks to an amazing Kehlani feature

**BaconShoes** (8): Kehlani singing is much better than Cardi. They sound great together and it‚Äôs a vibe

**gt\_official09** (8): major slay

**noavocadoshere** (8): excuse me cardi and kehlani, why haven't you collaborated after this?

**oscarbrierley1** (8): i probably like this because its predominantly kehlani. when cardi has someone to handle the hooks she can do a good song.

**vayyiqra** (8): Oh yeah I keep forgetting there's this one song deeper into this album I like because I really like the instrumental melody and the interplay between Cardi's verses and Kehlani's singing on the hook

**shipperondeck** (7.9): kehlani carry

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this is just a kehlani song ft. cardi b

**fadedblue09** (7.5): cute, but this would have been better as a Kehlani solo track

**jay** (7.5): yuppp

**amr** (7): I thought I heard some chirping but I have to hand it to them

**CrimsonROSET** (7): blondie:

## **Wouldn't pick up the phone**

**frogaranaman** (7): Kehlani is singing like someone doing a Kehlani impression here

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): if this was after money bag it would be a 10

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It‚Äôs cool but not exactly memorable

**welcome2thejam** (7): I really enjoyed the Kehlani album from this year! Shame I didn't like this as much

**sydschoon** (6.5): Kehlani feature really uplifts the song, but it's much slower than the previous tracks

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Cardi is just not the best at projecting vulnerability. I like the Kehlani hook tho.

**bogo** (6): kehlani carries

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): kehlani kinda ate this up icl‚Ä¶

**ImADudeDuh** (6): kehlani is like the single step above bubbling under pop stars, they‚Äôre like Hot 100 bottom 50 pop star

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): there isn‚Äôt enough going on here for me truthfully but kehlani does try on the chorus

**Bordersz** (5.5): Chorus is not catchy at all and brought it down a point. I love Kehlani's verse. I really like Cardi's 2nd verse.

**Roxieloxie** (5): I only like kehlani on this

**TheQueenofVultures** (5): kinda dull

**UselessTacooo** (5): only here for Kehlani idc

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): not everyone needed to make a SZA song I promise

**plastichaxan** (4): I thought this was the SZA song I was so scared I wasn't liking it

**IIIHenryIII** (3): someone on Genius said they get a Chris Brown vibe from this, now I can‚Äôt unhear it

**prettybirbkotori** (3): on first listen i thought this was boring and i stand by that

**camerinian** (2): like, this is maybe the worst hook in the rate. How was a Kehlani chorus not an instant slam dunk.

**Awkward\_King** (0): who told them ANY of this was a good idea like
