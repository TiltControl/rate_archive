---

**akanewasright** (10): GOD this song was fucking robbed. This was my immediate favorite when I first heard the album, and it‚Äôs stayed pretty high up there for me ever since. I get why this got some tankings - Megan isn‚Äôt exactly a singer (although while I think her voice works for this chorus), and I see how the AH in the hook could get grating - but FUCK this song is just too much fun. The beat is a blast and a half, and Megan bring the energy to match it. This is the most ‚Äúhot girl summer‚Äù song on the album, no I will not elaborate.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): Meg at her most carefree, I had to smile a bit. Like a lot of you mentioned, the "tongue out like üëÖ", is just really fun. The rest of it is pretty mixed to me (the rodeoOoOoOo sure is something), so I'm okay with it starting off our second day.

---

## üëÖ

**welcome2thejam** (10): I like when she goes "Ah üëÖ"

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I truly love it when she goes ‚ÄúAh üëÖ‚Äù

**CrimsonROSET** (7): an extra pronounced tongue emoji for this one

## **Every possible take you can have on this line:**

**Bordersz** (9.5): Ride him like a RODEOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): ‚Äúride it like a rodeoooo‚Äù saves this from being too forgettable

**sydschoon** (1.2): ride it like a rodeOOOOOOO....SO BAD!!!!!

## **Werk** 

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is literally the only time Megan sounds good kinda-singing a hook

**WaneDriptoc** (9.5): need her to open for hed pe

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): is this sexcercise

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**BaconShoes** (8.5): more booty shaking music

**fadedblue09** (8): Second half of the album has been refreshing so far

**starla\_** (8): Body part 2

**DirtyRat583** (7.9): a lil nas remix of this would go insane

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): simplistic but a good time anyways

**UselessTacooo** (7): she‚Äôs going off but she‚Äôs also doing nothing

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): carried by the sass in megan's delivery

## **Flop That**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Megan singing jumpscare.

**bogo** (6): why the hell is this only 2:14 megan i'm begging you to make your songs longer

**frogaranaman** (6): alternate reality Missy Elliott

**runaway3212** (6): filler

**throwaway-7650** (6): ok I get why some of y'all say megan shouldn't be singing ever

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Mid-gan Thee Stallion

**camerinian** (5.5): of all the hooks that Meg decided she had to take on herself

**noavocadoshere** (5.5): i have fatigue from all the references to sex and innuendos. but i love meg's samples and call backs. she nails the nostalgic/old school vibe with certain tracks v. well and work that is proof.

**gt\_official09** (5): cute but nothing special

**IIIHenryIII** (5): just forgot to work on the song

**jay** (5): yuppp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): theres not a single part of this song that‚Äôs memorable

**shipperondeck** (3): sorry this is just ?????

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): Probably the first instance of a song in this rate growing off me. I loved this when Good News first came out, it's a great anthem against slut shaming, like she's right I am the streets!! (I'm really not). Over time, I think I just ended up preferring some of the other album tracks more, but it's a still a gem of a song.

**akanewasright** (7.5): I do like this as the ‚Äúofficial closer‚Äù to the album with 3 bonus tracks at the end - it serves as a bit of a look into ‚Äúwho is Megan Thee Stallion‚Äù while still being a pretty fun rap song. The polygamy bar makes me laugh, and I genuinely really like the lines about her switching up her wigs. But‚Ä¶ yeah this making day 2 seems right, and I probably wouldn‚Äôt have minded too much if this went day 1.

---

## **Cause when we're shopping and bopping we're**

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ‚Äúsometimes i like to shop sometimes i like to bop‚Äù wow‚Ä¶shes just like me

## **WE OUTSIDE!**

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is such a post-covid and pre-omicron anthem tbh aweee

**noavocadoshere** (10): i'm inside as i listen to this, but this makes me feel like i'm outside. i'm not looking it up but this sounds like it sampled a video game or something v. memorable, and i can't place my finger on it. oh well. i enjoyed this one a lot. my second fave behind what's new.

**welcome2thejam** (10): What is this is JRPG music she's rapping over, this a Siivagunner track?

**WaneDriptoc** (9.1): i'll let the hot girl shit slide here. WE OUTSIDE!

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): real piano shit

**throwaway-7650** (9): a good closer but not as good as don't rock me to sleep would be!

**jay** (8.5): yupppp

**CrimsonROSET** (8): if meg is streets she‚Äôs also getting my 11 i guess

**prettybirbkotori** (8): i like hearing her switch up her flow and it paid off because this song is fun

**runaway3212** (8): yass

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i forgot how enjoyable this song is very nice

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Okay so she can sing a little‚Ä¶

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): i'm beginning to think this track doesn't sample kero kero bonito...

**AHSWeeknd** (7): same

**BaconShoes** (7): a bit of a jam

**frogaranaman** (7): cute closer (in the back seat of your rover)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the way she is rapping about being the streets over a Zelda ass instrumental; versatile queen

## **Indoors**

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): the beat is really pretty, but she sounds so monotonous.

**bogo** (6): bit of an underwhelming closer

**jackisboredtoday** (6): this is passable but it suffers from being placed next to two way more memorable songs on either side of it in the tracklist

**Roxieloxie** (6): I wish I was outside of this voter center

**seanderlust** (6): this sample :cozy:

**shipperondeck** (6): this would be good if someone else performed it ughhh i hate to say that i love u meg

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): what are those windpipes during the choruses i only just noticed them DSJDSJDSK

**sydschoon** (5.5): another meh track

**apatel27** (5): wtf was that polygamy line

**sa5m\_i\_am** (5): its alright but idc

**starla\_** (5): George Michael outsold

**IIIHenryIII** (3): stay there

**akanewasright** (9.5): I get why this was divisive, but MAN this song fucking eats. Like yes this is brash, possibly ear splitting, and not pretty at all, but MAN it‚Äôs just a load of fun. Cardi leaning into the parts of her voice that make her a little annoying honestly alongside a beat that leans into annoying synths is honestly a perfect fit, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for anything‚Ä¶ even if I understand why many, many participants would.

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): This has definitely got the most interesting production on IOP, I looooove the video game-esque beat and Cardi‚Äôs flow here is just so fun and unfettered. It genuinely grows on me with each listen. Maybe Akane and I should‚Äôve rigged this to win ‚Ä¶

## **Cyberpop Participants (extensions until Monday btw)**

**hikk** (8): bleep bloop this should be in cyberpop

**nt96** (8): That Trampoline line took me out, anyway, do the Cyberpop rate!

## **Drag Rate Participants** 

**musical\_pyn** (8): wait is this the serena chacha song???

**plastichaxan** (7.5): Need Serena Cha Cha on this beat

**seanderlust** (4.5): note to self: make a ravedj of this with drag money

## **VGI Participants**

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): she rapping over mario sound effects but she never quite levels up

**ImADudeDuh** (1): why is lavender town theme playing

## **Up-And-Left Rap Boys Participants** 

**slimboyfriend** (7): I see somebody really liked Gucci Gang‚Ä¶

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): makes me think of gucci gang

**bogo** (7): this is a playboi carti song, like does anyone else hear it

## **Everyone else**

**BaconShoes** (10): it‚Äôs just an absolute banger i‚Äôm sorry. MONEY BAG MONEY BAG MONEY BAG!!! UNH!!!!

**camerinian** (10): the textbook definition of "dummy hard"

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love when rappers rap over arcade music

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): feeling like a millionaire listening to this (i have $14 on my account)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): nothing to say other than slaps and i love how anxiety inducing the chorus is

**UselessTacooo** (10): i have nowhere else to spill but last week i had sx with this guy in his apartment and it was so good! unfortunately we had to stop because his boyfriend caught us. -__- anyways.. today the guy i was having having sx with before getting rudely interrupted said that i should get my sweet a** to his apartment since they have talked about their issues and now they want to have a threesome with me. apparently they're gonna stuff both their d1ks in me at the same time. the thought of two dicks in my bussy terrifies me but at the same time makes me really hrny. i am now on my way to their apartment and the excitement is killing me! anyways Money Bag for the win!

**WaneDriptoc** (9.5): god im so pissed there's not a good deranged as fuck youtube comment to put here; just the guy teling ppl to keep streaming it to keep it on the charts lol. this shit bangs. warrior sound.

**gt\_official09** (9): wow the production was quite a smahsa

**Hulnia** (9): that beat should‚Äôve gone to someone else but she still ate

**shipperondeck** (9): fun beat

**MassiveThief** (8.5): beat goes hard

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): d tier monopoly piece

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (8): When Cardi goes off, she GOES OFF

**CrimsonROSET** (8): xo is actually hugs and kisses cardi please stop ignoring physical touch

**frogaranaman** (8): songs for paying off credit card debt

**jay** (8): yupppp

**TiltControls** (8): the 2nd best cardi song starting with money is still a good accomplishment

**sydschoon** (7.7): banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This is pretty obvious album filler but I‚Äôm having fun.

**ricki** (7): this is one autotune plugin from being considered a hyperpop classic

**runaway3212** (7): kinda filler but kinda slay

**starla\_** (7): decent but not amazing

**Stryxen** (7): I wish she did more with this delectable beat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): if this had more autotune on it this would basically be a hyperpop song

**amr** (6.6): not anything special but I smile every time she says "with them pretty ass twins U look like beyonc√©" like :D

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): I keep it juicy juicy I eat that lunch

**IIIHenryIII** (6): ‚ÄúI been broke my whole life‚Äù, this line hits home more than it should

**noavocadoshere** (6): i enjoy the production on this one but money bag feels like it should be the intro for money, which i like sm better. someone mash up money bag + money like miguel + pnd's girl with the tattoo/break from toronto, pls and ty.

**vayyiqra** (6): bleep bloop

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): More like Filler Bag

**fadedblue09** (5): annoying and monotonous

**akanewasright** (7): Ah yes. The one that started it all. The Doja song that finally broke her through to the hot 100. Her first direct collaboration with Dr. Luke. I can‚Äôt lie, I really do like this song. The involvement of Doja‚Äôs frequent collaborator Yeti Beats is probably a major part of that, because this really feels like one of the last glimpses of Amala‚Äôs scrappier version of Doja that we got, and that‚Äôs without talking about the verses, which absolutely EAT. The version of the song that became a hit, however, replaces Doja‚Äôs second verse ~~one of the most fun verses she‚Äôs ever done~~ with a feature from infamous rapper and Kylie Jenner ex Tyga. Personally I think his verse is‚Ä¶ *fine*, although I greatly miss the Doja verse. A number of you guys feel a lot stronger about this than I do! I was honestly *shocked* this song never made it out of day 2 since it was such a moment, but I guess sometimes blowing up leaves a target on your back.

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): I remember when this music video went viral on Twitter and thinking, "uh sure. That is a song alright." Both this version of Juicy and the original on Amala have been middle of the road Doja songs for me‚Äî she's done funnier stuff, she's done catchier stuff, she's done more interesting stuff. I don't hate it or anything, but it's clear that a lot of people do, hence its very subpar performance here.

## **Have fat asses**

**amr** (10): male features don't exist if U're delusional enough btw

**DirtyRat583** (10): the amala version is better but u cant deny that this is a smash hit

**fadedblue09** (10): Ending this album with a banger

**gt\_official09** (10): something for the summertime ! something for the girls to get ready and party to

**jay** (10): YUPPPPP

**ricki** (10): pretending this is the tygaless version<3

**sa5m\_i\_am** (10): keep it juicy it bops

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i cant believe i have to defend TYGA of all people but fuck it, i think his verse is overhatted. like, would i rather be listening to the original? yes! but its not the worst thing in the world, its perfectly serviceable and doesnt ruin the song at all, which is already a massive banger to begin with, and if anything im just glad the remix managed to make more people familiar with the song and let them enjoy it.

**vayyiqra** (10): :flushed:

**plastichaxan** (9.9): Taking 0.1 for Tyga but he wasn't that bad I just prefer the other version

**402man** (9.5): If this was the original this would've been my 11. Thanks Tyga >:(

**camerinian** (9.5): the ballot doesn't acknowledge Tyga and therefore I refuse to either

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): shrunk on me a tad bit still a bop

**noavocadoshere** (9.5): it's true, you can't trust a big butt and a gemini-i-i. a great closer.

**1998tweety** (9): bop even though the remix is a downgrade

**Bordersz** (9): I would give it a 10 if it was the solo version. SMH. Tyga verse isn't bad on its own, it's bad compared to Doja's verse.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): tyga-less would be a 10

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): pretending to score the Amala version

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): the solo version is a ten. the verse that tyga replaced was better, but his reach got the song on the charts which i will give him props for.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Did somebody say Juice!? [hurls you into popheadscirclejerk, an abyss from which you will not return unscatched]

**BaconShoes** (7.5): wait til you see it from the back back back back back

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): like "Like That" i was obsessed in 2019 so i can't give it a low score but it hasn't aged great for me

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): this could be noticeably higher if we were doing the original but alas

**AHSWeeknd** (7): ‚ÄúHe like the Doja with the Cat‚Äù such a simple yet meaningful line.

**bogo** (7): they had to go and ruin a perfectly great song by putting tyga on it

**IIIHenryIII** (7): where‚Äôs the juice?

**jasannn** (7): the main hook is forever imprinted into my mind sadly

**pikajake** (7): but 10 without tyga

**prettybirbkotori** (7): putting this on the album is kind of cheating but it‚Äôs a bop so who am i to complain

**RandomHypnotica** (7): why is this the only track not to have the feature tag in the title

**shipperondeck** (7): tyga was so unnecessary here

**throwaway-7650** (7): this is what I expected from lush life's production to be from that title

**hikk** (6.5): she will never be lizzo

**CrimsonROSET** (6): damn it tyga

**frogaranaman** (6): Tiktok overplayed this for me üòî

**Awkward\_King** (5): TYGA STAY AWAY FROM HER (her being the second verse)

**Stryxen** (5): i have been struggling to form any opinion on this for like 4 years now

**UselessTacooo** (5): how not to close your album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I think this was Doja Cat‚Äôs first song to chart on the Hot 100? :audience:

**Roxieloxie** (4): oh I‚Äôve heard this one before

**runaway3212** (4): why is tyga here

**sydschoon** (2.5): sorry i really hate Tyga...never got the hype for this song

**WaneDriptoc** (2): wait this one was a bad idea wait the album was doing so good for so long wtf is happening here.

**starla\_** (1): I would like this if it weren't for Tyga who is incredibly irritating

**flava** (0): Tyga is one of the most unlistenable artists to ever exist, his voice just exudes a black hole of personality and presence and it sucks the fun out of any song he has ever featured.

**seanderlust** (0): boooooooo dr luke and tyga boooo tomato tomato

**TiltControls** (0): I'm sorry to my friend [REDACTED] but there was a period of a few months that whenever we'd hang out he'd play this song and after that long I kinda grew to hate it

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): now why does this actually sound kind of a good to me on a relisten‚Ä¶ like it‚Äôs still forgettable and the lyrics are questionable, but the guitar is giving a bit

**akanewasright** (3): Honest to god I thought this one would do worse. This as an ‚Äúoh no‚Äù moment for me in terms of Bebe Rexha‚Äôs career - I‚Äôve liked a few of her songs, hated others - but this song being substanceless (but aspiring to be deep) made me go ‚Äúoh, so this album is gonna be insufferable‚Äù which‚Ä¶ it was, as one of 8 people who heard it. I‚Äôll get into this more later, but Doja Cat is generally very careful to not do embarrassing features, so her being on this song is a little bewildering until you remember that Bebe and her share a manager. And to be honest, Doja doesn‚Äôt embarrass herself at all - she kinda salvages the song with her verse, which is honestly more than can be said of most of the trash collabs, which is why I think this placed as high as it did.

---

**1998tweety** (10): they mothered

**throwaway-7650** (10): happy late birthday soobin

**starla\_** (9): this is really good for a Bebe Rexha song

**UselessTacooo** (9): don‚Äôt laugh it goes off

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Doja did what had to be done

**DaHumanTorch** (8): jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly on a plate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i'm giving this an extra point bc my boyfriend loves it and i'm giving it another point for JELLY JELLY ON A PLATE SUNNY SIDE UP I GOT EGG ON MY FACE

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Wow I actually like a Bebe Rexha song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Doja elevates this song

**BaconShoes** (7): the bop that almost was, the song that they tried so hard to make into an event and it just wasn‚Äôt

**DirtyRat583** (7): i understand why this album completely flopped now

**vayyiqra** (7): This bassline kind of slaps and is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. In fact what the fuck this song is kind of good?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): ‚Äúfor the girls with lighter eyes‚Äù now Bebe Rexha got me thinking about Toni Morrison, ma‚Äôam I‚Äôm supposed to be laughing at the bad music you put out but now I‚Äôm THINKING

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I kinda feel sorry for Bebe, she just keeps releasing mid songs

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): this is certainly a generic song that I will never play again

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Upsetting. But I won't give up. My career was built on failures and not following the mold. I won't stop. I never have and never will. I still believe in this album. And I still will push. No matter what.

**amr** (5): this pink panther ass instrumental

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Gotta do my best to not give a mediocre song too much credit because of what it‚Äôs surrounded by.

**runaway3212** (4.5): Okay but what was bebe thinking with that second verse

**flava** (4): Im convinced this bonus rate manifested I‚Äôm Good (Blue) hitting the top ten and I will never the hosts for this

**impla77** (4): I‚Äôm giving pity points to this

**noavocadoshere** (4): sunny side up, i got egg on my face. phoned in 2. when doja's really not feeling a verse, you can tell. i don't even think it really fit rexha's overall theme, but i'm not gonna re-listen to confirm that. one and done.

**welcome2thejam** (4): Maybe I'll give this a solid score just for being competent [One "jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly" later] Nah

**bogo** (3): Upsetting. But I won‚Äôt give up. My career was built on failures and not following the mold. I won‚Äôt stop. I never have and never will. I still believe in this album. And I still will push. No matter what.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): bleeding

**plastichaxan** (2): I‚Äôm jealous of whoever skipped this bonus rate I‚Äôm already in too deep

**Stryxen** (2): girl shut the hell up girl (not you doja)

**sydschoon** (1.2): this song garbage imo

**Awkward\_King** (1): bebe rexha you deserve everything bad that happens to you

**frogaranaman** (1): I would not date someone like this

**ImADudeDuh** (1): living through this being #1 on the r/popheads charts was traumatizing and embarassing

**prettybirbkotori** (1): i‚Äôm not a production snob but the mixing feels so odd on this song, not that that would have saved this mess

**RandomHypnotica** (1): salem ilese core

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): I'm trying to describe this track, why do I kinda wanna call it cute?? Like I love how you can almost HEAR Meg smile while she's chanting the chorus and I think it's just a well-rounded collaboration between the three of them. Kind of deserved a bit better.

**akanewasright** (8): MAN this was kinda robbed. Hot Girl Meg is one of Megan‚Äôs most *fun* personas, and seeing her paired with City Girls is a joy (even if, as usual, Yung Miami is a little off beat). It‚Äôs a raunchfest made in heaven, with a typically great beat from Megan‚Äôs most consistent collaborator LilJu.

---

## **City Girls Up**

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Sometimes I really do just sit down and wonder how Megan is so talented. City Girls didn‚Äôt hold up though.

**amr** (10): songs U can't listen to without having Ur tongue out for 10 seconds at a time

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): yung miami is sooo funny

**starla\_** (9): I love City Girls so I have to give it to this one

**noavocadoshere** (8.9): this is fun! that pregnant line is so awkward lol, but this was v. much needed. do it, do it, do it!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): https://rave.dj/0uS-KgwwpO5ZYA

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Is Hot Girl Meg an actual artist or is this a J Cole Kill Edward situation?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): real cold girl shit

**Roxieloxie** (8): I‚Äôm also a cold bitch (I‚Äôm stuck in the voter line next to the air conditioner )

**welcome2thejam** (8): Feels like they're trying to hypnotize me to do it on the dick

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I don‚Äôt get why she just didn‚Äôt name it *do it on the dick*

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): something about the way they say the ad libs makes me laugh. i would probably rate it higher without yung miami's verse, shes just not as good as the others.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7.5): chorus is too catchy, wasn‚Äôt expecting this to grow on me

**Stryxen** (7.5): they forgot to credit Cher Lloyd for her outro

**1998tweety** (7): i feel like this couldve gave more

**ricki** (7): boy this pussy talk

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I should stan but I‚Äôd rather listen to Clipse - Grindin idk

**frogaranaman** (6): what if I want the whole thing

**cremeebrulee** (10): This absolute of a jointslay between two queens WOW!!! I fear everyone is incorrect because this is 100% the better SZA feature in the rate. Every line of this is just cocky, quotable perfection. ‚Äúleave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue‚Äù is almost Shakespearian. I really hope these two pair up again (and not just for a Summer Walker remix) because this has been my favorite IOP song for years.

**akanewasright** (9): SZA‚Äôs chorus here isn‚Äôt her best work per say (I think it‚Äôs alright, nothing too special), but Cardi‚Äôs verse? Some of her best. The number of fucking out of pocket lines here and there are just truly something to behold. A lot of y‚Äôall were really not into the chorus though, and there was a much more pop-inflected SZA feature later that probably hurt this song in comparison.

---

## **Someone should let them know**

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): sza you need to say "i do" to releasing SOS

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): sza when you ask her if she knows when the album is coming and its opposite day (authors note i hope this ages badly)

## **Thank you Jules**

**runaway3212** (10): SOS IS OUT NOW!!! LISTEN TO IT!!!

## **Bad bitches**

**AHSWeeknd** (10): ‚ÄúPussy so good, I said my own name during sex!‚Äù A line worth an eleven.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): SZA singing the chorus is probably the most memorable thing about this but I feel like Cardi‚Äôs performance in this is one of the best in the album too? 11 contender

**throwaway-7650** (10): a 10 for the blue balls line alone (and SZA is mother ofc)

**WaneDriptoc** (10): I didn't talk about how much I love the lyrical flow to I Like That. the way Cardi lists off what she likes has this flirty libido and POP to it that I Do

**1998tweety** (9.5): they mothered

**BaconShoes** (9): boppppp. SZA and cardi ate this

**starla\_** (9): a highlight

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): another song i forgot how much i liked till i played it again

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I want more SZA over trap beats

**Stryxen** (8): dating someone with the same name as me to relate to the Pussy so good I say my own name during sex Line. Gay people are exhausting

**camerinian** (7.5): "leave his text on read, leave his balls on blue" is the bar in this rate I most want tattooed on me

**jay** (7.5): yupppp

**nt96** (7.5): SZA giving us her resplendent gibberish once again

**seanderlust** (7.5): "only time that i'm a lady is when i lay these hoes to rest" have you ever heard a sentence verbally spoken that just feels like it's got the 100 emoji at the end of it?

**Awkward\_King** (7): scissor

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ok i like this but why is it a prerequisite to have jail time

**noavocadoshere** (7): cardi has the WEIRDEST transitions here. you'll go from a party track to heartbreak and now this...idk how i feel about this one. not the strongest closer, but not the weakest one either. eh.

**shipperondeck** (7): did not know sza was on this album until now

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Badass but as an ending track‚Ä¶ meh

**sydschoon** (6.8): SZA really elevates this track

## **Got left on read**

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): they sound fine but idk why we needed this Mystic Stylez ass horrorcore production for this. ‚ÄúLeave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue‚Äù‚Äôis hilarious tho

**gt\_official09** (6): kind of underwhelming for a closer but cute.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I don‚Äôt

**vayyiqra** (6): "I say my OWN name [...]" is a good line I will give her that

**Bordersz** (5.8): I do not like SZA's flow on this at all. Cardi is ok, lyrics are a bit ehhh.

**402man** (5.5): The worse of the two SZA songs in this rank (and honestly one of my bottom 5 SZA songs). Thru Your Phone is a better ending.

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): SZA's worst song? the most generic song with the most unmemorable beat.

**amr** (5): we need the sza love me do by the beatles cover

**ricki** (5): cardi hired so many songwriters and none of them could come up with a proper chorus?

**welcome2thejam** (5): That did not hit as much as I'd hope from a Cardi/SZA teamup

**bogo** (4): what a waste of a sza feature on this

**prettybirbkotori** (4): i like basically everything sza puts out. not this tho

**indie\_fan\_** (1.3): SZA the only somewhat tolerable part of this song

**akanewasright** (10): Man‚Ä¶ I wish this song stuck around a little longer. I get why this gets cut now - Doja isn‚Äôt rapping in the style that people like best, the autotune proved to be divisive, a LOT of people couldn‚Äôt get past the way ‚Äúbottom bitch‚Äù is used here - but MAN this is just a lot of fun. Doja and Yeti Beats are a killer duo, and them choosing to flip this Blink-182 sample feels like a continuation of the scrappy Doja I fell in love with on Amala. She went for something cool, something kinda out there, and I really think it paid off for her. Not to mention the video and performances for this song fucking RULE, like she absolutely devoured.

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): I can appreciate Doja trying something different here and melding punk and hip-hop together, but this song feels very one-note throughout its runtime. It gets points for being as WLW as it is, but I just wish it were a little more interesting to listen to!!

---

## **Drag rate's longevity is unparalleled**

**impla77** (5.5): This is reminded me of ‚ÄòBoy is a bottom‚Äô- I didn‚Äôt want to me reminded of that

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this boy is a bottooooooom oops wrong rate

**plastichaxan** (6.5): Bottom song of this month in rates is not as fun as the last one

## **Loves women**

**amr** (11): I originally wasn't going to 11 this going into the rate but I remembered last year I was at the mall and to ward off an anxiety attack I had a playlist of this sandwiched between 2 mitski songs (francis forever, a pearl) and 2 nct 127 songs (chain, simon says) on loop all afternoon so basically I have this song to thank for me not throwing up that day. <3.

**BaconShoes** (10): I like this kind of shift in sound, it totally works for her and she really shows her versatility on this album

**Frajer** (10): the Blink 182 sample iconic

**Stryxen** (10): what the hell was that

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i WISH this got the success the other singles did but whatever it's such a banger anyway

**vayyiqra** (10): The fact this song exists is so absurd and funny and all the "ooh"s are funny, idk

**welcome2thejam** (10): Catchy, fun, great beat, love the background chorus vocals, just a good time

**camerinian** (9.5): I don't know why Doja telling me to wipe the spit off her nuts got me so good but yes ma'am

**WaneDriptoc** (9.1): oh wow I know this one this takes me back. it's deeply funny when they cut to the game room and it just feels like everyone is trying to cosplay as nu-metal but also they're just cyberpop skaters.

**celladonn** (9): How did I not realize before now that this samples What's My Age Again

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i always thought she was saying mooo and it was a cute callback

**gt\_official09** (9): gay rights!

**babadork** (8.5): Stumbled on the theory that this isn‚Äôt about wlw, and I‚Äôm confused now

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): I love everything about this except that random autotune on the bridge.

**runaway3212** (8.5): Doja comitted to saying every gay men related word

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.3): bottom shaming? üòØ

**sydschoon** (8.2): OOoooOooo

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This is what I imagine The 1975‚Äôs songs sound like

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this is just mooo! without all the fun

**isthesweetestcon** (8): i can‚Äôt give any lower to a song that samples what‚Äôs my age again

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8): I just like it because its gay. Like a modern take on an Avril Lavigne song idk lol

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): did NOT expect this sample to work at all when I saw it listed but i‚Äôm shocked how solid it fits in this beat

**TiltControls** (7.5): the music is a lot more restrained than i thought for a track titled bottom bitch

**ignitethephoenix** (7): nice melody but I hate the use of autotune on this song

**prettybirbkotori** (7): yee (and i cannot stress this enough) haw

## **https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eet0MwuUYAAe9l7.jpg**

**MassiveThief** (6): sample is cool. not huge on the song tho

**Roxieloxie** (6): I like the music video for this more than the song sorry

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Uhh in what universe is calling your friend a "bottom bitch" a compliment?

**seanderlust** (5.5): i didn't even clock the blink sample until i looked it up

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): DON'T LET DOJA CAT ANYWHERE NEAR AUTOTUNE I BEG

**bogo** (5): there is no heterosexual explanation for this song

**ricki** (4): homosexual community dont make a gay sex joke challenge [IMPOSSIBLE]

**jasannn** (3): four songs in and im really confused by this tracklisting. this sounds like a track 9/10 filler

**noavocadoshere** (3): i still feel the same about BB since first listening to it. it feels like filler. it's just there as a song.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): in my headcanon this is what Sucker sounds like

**shipperondeck** (2.5): i remember being so disappointed when i first heard this

**indie\_fan\_** (2): The autotune here is grating to me + the hook gives me children's animated tv show melodically speaking

**cremeebrulee** (10): YASS!!!! This is just the sort of explicit, filthy music that Cardi just excels at making. So many quotable lines here (minus the unfortunate lawyer one), though I agree with everyone that the ‚Äúmake the pussy crack a smile‚Äù one is a highlight. What‚Äôs also really cool about this track is how it flips the meaning the meaning of the song it samples from; the term ‚Äúchickenhead‚Äù is a pretty derogatory term for women, but Cardi uses this song to completely own her sexual nature.

**akanewasright** (9): Honestly I‚Äôm a little sad this didn‚Äôt make it further, I just think this song fucking eats. I understand some of the criticisms (particularly of the jewish lawyer line), but man‚Ä¶ Cardi‚Äôs just at her best when she‚Äôs just making noises. Half of the low scores have never watched ‚ÄúCardi B‚Äôs Star Wars‚Äù and it shows.

---

## **Pops their pussy**

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it‚Äôs tracks like these that make me want to comment ‚ÄúCardi queen‚Äù

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is the closest on the album cardi comes to like a lil kim track and i think it really works for her

**BaconShoes** (10): it‚Äôs just a smash, what can I say

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this song is so much fun and a standout track/my favorite aside from bartier cardi. i hope this isn't done dirty

**jay** (10): yuppppp

**RandomHypnotica** (10): idk wtf a bickenhead is, but i support it if it sounds like this (unless it's something bad then ignore me)

**seanderlust** (10): the second verse...dr seuss wishes he wrote these rhymes

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Aside from the anti-semitism it's pretty good!

**WaneDriptoc** (10): good for cardi taking a dirty south classic and doing her signature flow under it; shit is funny and bombastic. when we get to the part about "popping", my mind goes to the video of the song she did for one of the nick jr animated shows. I'd like to think she included this on her audition tape and that's how she got the role

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): real ones know this is one of the best songs on the album

**fadedblue09** (9): is GUAP the predecessor of WAP

**plastichaxan** (9): I love a song that paints a good visual and this one may have just won with the entire verse that leads to "Spread them asscheeks open, make that pussy crack a smile"

**slimboyfriend** (9): ‚Äúget it from my momma and you don‚Äôt know where your daddy at‚Äù? stupid unimportant unattractive AND unemployed??

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): so glad I looked it up because I thought guap was just her imitating chicken noises but it is apparently slang for money. Actually is it both in this song? I vibe anyways

**noavocadoshere** (8.5): okay, okay. you won me back. cardi makes music for the girlies who adored brooke valentine and danity kane. hi, hello, it's me.

**starla\_** (8.5): the precursor to WAP

**nt96** (8): I Got Beans, Greens, Potatoes, Tomatoes Lamb, Ram, Hogs Dogs, Beans, Greens, Potatoes, Tomatoes, Chicken Turkeys Rabbit, YOU NAME IT!!!!!!

**ricki** (8): yeah this pussy talk

**shipperondeck** (8): thought i would hate this... ok the spread the cheeks line was bad

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i always forget how much i like this song till i listen to it again

**1998tweety** (7.5): the verses on this are great but the chorus is just ok

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): between this song telling you to pop your pussy at church and doja cat telling you to get into it (yuh) if you go to church, i am appreciating the new rap girls‚Äô mission to make church more yass and slay

**IIIHenryIII** (7): chickenhead is better, why listen to this???

**prettybirbkotori** (7): lyrically not my favorite but i thought it was fun i liked the beat

**sydschoon** (6.9): spread them ass cheeks open let that pussy crack a smile :D

**CrimsonROSET** (6): [twitter draft] during elections im a bidenhead / during the world cup im a beckenhead / during chemistry im a beakerhead / in fire emblem i‚Äôm a rickenhead

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): iconic sample tho

**frogaranaman** (6): that ‚Äúboy please, whatever!‚Äù in the background HITS

**gt\_official09** (6): cute moment

**isthesweetestcon** (6): some of the more repetitive songs aren‚Äôt for me but i‚Äôll make an exception for the guap guap

**runaway3212** (6): this is good but also kinda gives half the energy of the rest of the album

## **Squawk**

**Bordersz** (5): She should be banned from saying "pop that pussy".

**throwaway-7650** (5): cock

**vayyiqra** (4): Maybe this is because I'm in a state of bereavement and have been up all night and running on literally no sleep and it's 9:30 in the morning, but this song is really confusing and chaotic and my head is buzzing; I have no idea what is going on in this song sorry I'm baffled

**MassiveThief** (3): SUPER annoying hook

**oscarbrierley1** (1): this is so annoying to me. i didn't need to here chicken noises for the majority of a song.

**OutrageousWorldTour** (1): annoying

**bogo** (0): this may be a bit of a reactionary 0 due to recent events and i apologize for that but like, fuck the lawyer line, it's offensive and antisemitic and leaves a real bad taste in my mouth. plus the rest of the song isn't even good enough to make up for it, honestly it's kinda annoying to be honest. just a shit song overall

**cremeebrulee** (4): make sure to stream sg lewis' new album AudioLust & HigherLove out january 27th 2023

**akanewasright** (1.5): I swapped this in the bonus rate for Sweetest Pie at the last minute, both because there‚Äôs a chance we might rate Traumazine next year and because I took a listen to it and went ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôll be some competition for the bottom spots in the bonus rate.‚Äù Admittedly, I was a *little* harsh on this song initially - it is not *that* bad - but man, this made it a bit too far/didn‚Äôt make it low enough. Meg phones it in, Lisa Lisas, and this feels mostly interchangeable with Taki Taki, the last DJ Snake/woman rapper collar.

---

**jay** (10): baila whatcha want dance for you..

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i fucking love this song idc if it was underwhelming for alot of people. megan ate and Lisa deserved a song like this for her actual solo no i'm not fucking bitter YG

**seanderlust** (8.5): This beat got me doing the sexy kermit dance in my kitchen

**starla\_** (8.5): even Lisa's verse is decent

**AHSWeeknd** (8): such an‚Ä¶ international song.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): i like how they had to put "of blackpink" next to lisa so we didn't confuse her with... lisa lopes? lisa simpson?? like really how many other famous lisa's can there be

**TiltControls** (8): while it's a collection of artists that look like the names were pulled out of a hat the song does sound good!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): truly drawing names out of a hat here , classic DJ Snake

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): this lineup looks like a Popheads Jukebox post

**welcome2thejam** (7): The audible groan I made when this video made me realize I'm attracted to Lisa of Blackpink

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): weirdly catchy

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): kinda hilarious that DJ Snake has twice now used a rap girl and pop girl to get online gays excited about a new single only for it to be a trick to force them to listen to Ozuna

**IIIHenryIII** (6): slightly good

**runaway3212** (6): You know what it could be worse

**shipperondeck** (6): i thought lisa was talking to a sexy girl and not referring to herself as one and i was gonna be like omg so trueeee bi queen but never mind

**vayyiqra** (6): Hey it's another collab of random big names just like "Taki Taki". This guy is not real; I don't believe for a second this wasn't autogenerated by a computer program to make mid BGM for nightclub bathrooms. But also it's weirdly listenable, decent even. this is the uncanny valley of music i'm scared

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I didn't realize Lisa was the secret 4th rap girl in this rate?

**noavocadoshere** (5): this is the most random collab. like, it really doesn't make sense even if you tried to connect the dots. my score is for the saxophone in this and the production. i am happy to have reached the end.

**throwaway-7650** (5): men

**1998tweety** (4): taki taki >>

**BaconShoes** (4): this is so random like what

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Lewis?

**prettybirbkotori** (4): how is the megan verse my least favorite thing here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): they created the lineup of this song using mad libs

**sydschoon** (3.6): never understood the hype for this song

**plastichaxan** (3.5): Was kinda tempted to give it a 5.6 for the name joke but I prefer honesty

**Awkward\_King** (3): im just kind of overwhelmed at this point

**bogo** (3): what the fuck is that awful midi saxophone that shit sounds terrible

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): me.

**frogaranaman** (3): ehhhhh

**DirtyRat583** (2): i dont think i have ever heard a song with absolutely 0 effort put into it. wow.

**sa5m\_i\_am** (2): its a song yep with lots of people on it but that doesn‚Äôt make it better

**Bordersz** (1): Couldn't wait for it to end the whole time, and Lisa's verse is the worst. Production was smooth but forgettable.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): living through DJ Snake trying to make Taki Taki 2 was traumatizing

**akanewasright** (10): God, I‚Äôm starting to think some of you guys hate fun. I see the features here getting hated on and like‚Ä¶ are we hearing the same thing? I don‚Äôt know how you hear Big Sean say ‚Äúhow many besties done up and left me‚Äù and not call it the best song ever made. In all seriousness, I do think this song deserved way better, and that both Megan and her features brought their A game to their verses.

**cremeebrulee** (10): ROBBED!!! This song starts and does NOT let up once, like I'm hyped for its entire runtime. I can't even pick out who has the best verse between the three of them, though "40 inch weave black weave like Morticia" is probably my favorite line. I honestly don't understand how some of y'all can hate Big Sean's or 2 Chainz's verses, but the misandry curse doesn't account for talent I suppose.

---

## **About to go crazy**

**Awkward\_King** (11): meg youre INSANE for this track how are you gonna have a beat this fun and hold big sean at gunpoint to deliver his best verse in years and have two verses yourself and it not feel too long or anything youre fucking CRAZY like ive never eaten so good mother mother mother

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Big Sean has always had it, they‚Äôve gotta collab more

**BaconShoes** (10): It‚Äôs just such a jam like‚Ä¶ I am about to go crazy here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): these are my avengers

**frogaranaman** (10): damn what bills did they have to pay in the studio here

**RandomHypnotica** (10): absolutely obsessed with the west coast hip hop vibes here, incredible cut

**runaway3212** (10): honestly they all spilled

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the better of the two songs on here that have child vocals in the background

**babadork** (9.3): My rating for this song changed a lot based on how much I was able to ignore 2 Chainz that time I listened to it.

**1998tweety** (9): the men kinda ate this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This production is kind of absurd. I like it tho.

**jay** (9): yupppp

**TiltControls** (9): probably the most evenly matched collab in the rate. all 3 insert so much fun to the track

**seanderlust** (8.7): the absolute ballsiness of referencing tory on the song that features big sean

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): anything will sound good after that.

**bogo** (8): miles better than the [REDACTED] song that i refuse to listen to

**CrimsonROSET** (8): do we think meg and goku would work out like he‚Äôs on hot girl shit i think they‚Äôd be a cute couple

**Frajer** (8): fun sample

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): idk if this is unpopular opinion but i actually really enjoy this one

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): Meg is the standout on this but also shout out Big Sean, so underrated to hear him & 2 Chainz as some of the more charismatic and funny on purpose rappers of the 2010s

**shipperondeck** (7.8): love the morticia shoutout but... big sean's gonna big sean

**Bordersz** (7.5): Big Sean's verse elevated the song.

**MassiveThief** (7.5): got me shakin ass

**starla\_** (7.5): pretty good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): im gonna pretend 2 chainz verse isnt here‚Ä¶megan and big sean ate

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): I just realized this song has a Dragon Ball reference. foreshadowing for the Sasuke line omg

**Hulnia** (7): both of the features are always hilarious to me fsr

**impla77** (7): we‚Äôve all seen the pictures she looks absolutely beautiful. Um and he‚Äôs (x2) there

**UselessTacooo** (7): I try so hard to like this but then Big Sean and 2 Chainz show up and the skip button looks really pleasant

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Big mental breakdown vibes

**WaneDriptoc** (7): "in the escape room" type scenario as the team has 3 minutes to solve the puzzle and are desperately about to flop. megan's got the cypher pattern on lock (pretty much as she has the entire album) but big sean & 2 chainz are SLACKING on the puzzle and they may not get out!

**welcome2thejam** (7): Go crazy? Don't mind if I do! Ah ü§™

**ricki** (6.8): she‚Äôs so crazy omg i love her

**sydschoon** (6.8): fire beat

**plastichaxan** (6.5): A collab with men??? That‚Äôs decent??? I‚Äôve heard it all

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6.5): I wish I could love this more because her flow is good but the production is lacking. Give Megan Timbaland and Danja! Or WondaGurl or Boi-1da ‚Ä¶ I understand with the drake beef the latter might not be possible tho ugh

**gt\_official09** (6): the chorus gets a bit repetitive but fun verses

## **Besties that done and left me**

**nt96** (5): not too crazy about this one

**prettybirbkotori** (5): ‚Äúbig sean and 2 chainz sent their verses within like 2 days‚Äù oh im sure

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Dear lord this album is bloated AF

**IIIHenryIII** (4): me listening to the last three songs

**indie\_fan\_** (4): I can't hear anything past whatever the hell that beat is

**noavocadoshere** (2): pls. i beg the girlies to leave these features off. the production is this song's saving grace.

**akanewasright** (7): I can‚Äôt lie, this has never been one of my favorites on the album. It grew on me eventually, but I still somewhat hold the belief that its one big line is the only truly excellent part of the song. But MAN what a line. ‚ÄúInvest in this pussy, boy support black business‚Äù is one of the very best bars in the rate, and that line carried a lot of your scores.

**cremeebrulee** (7): I'm honestly impressed this made it so high? For some time this was actually comfortably in Day 3 and even in the Top 10. I didn't realize it was such a fan fave. I think this placement is a little more reasonable for it.

---

## **How does that line go again?**

**DaHumanTorch** (10): "invest in this pussy boy support black business" she was so unserious for this üò≠

**frogaranaman** (10): the first time I heard the ‚Äúsupport Black business‚Äù line I just about wept over the fact that nobody thought of it earlier it‚Äôs iconic

**gt\_official09** (10): invest in this pussy boy support black business, literally should be studied in colleges.

**throwaway-7650** (10): INVEST IN THIS PUSSY BOY SUPPORT BLACK BUSINESS üó£Ô∏è

**sydschoon** (9.8): INVEST IN THIS PUSSY BOY SUPPORT BLACK BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): *invest in this pussy, boy, support black business* ok this has to go down in history as one of the best lines ever

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ‚Äòinvest in this pussy support black businesses‚Äô maybe top3 bars in the album

**Roxieloxie** (8): invest in black business

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): the ‚Äúsupport black business‚Äù line singlehandedly makes this song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): the ‚Äúinvest in this pussy support black business‚Äù line made me up the score here

## **Spend it on a bad bitch**

**prettybirbkotori** (11): THIS IS MY SOOOOOOONG I DO NOT CARE no other song makes me feel like a bad bitch quite like this one

**Awkward\_King** (10): fun fact this beat is actually sampled from an early 2000s webbie track that has a remix w an absolutely *amazing* trina verse https://open.spotify.com/track/1cFDZAhZts81G7qeRYuS6r?si=0a5f71a8a0f740f3

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Megan please bring crunk music back I am begging, the Webbie sample has me hype

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): megan rapping about sugar babies on this kids‚Äô game show music type beat is so funny

**noavocadoshere** (10): 100% could see a dance team would using sugar baby for their performance song. i love it.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she's just like me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is so much fun, the delivery is great and so many funny lines

**impla77** (9.5): we love knowing your worth

**shipperondeck** (9.5): 90s king of fighters type beat

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I forget how much i love that little hook in the production

**runaway3212** (9): I love when meghan doesn't even try to do pop

**seanderlust** (9): the movie/story linef ljkllkdfsf

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I love capitalism

**plastichaxan** (8.5): What I'm trying to be tbh

**BaconShoes** (8): the jam is jamming

**camerinian** (8): this beat making me wanna throw hands in the Pok√©mon stadium

**hikk** (8): i think this is a fun beat

**jay** (8): yupppp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): im trying to get rich‚Ä¶.er is the most underrated line in this entire rate

**bogo** (7): why does this sound like game show music

**sa5m\_i\_am** (7): its fine

**starla\_** (7): this would be great with better production, it sounds really dated

**WaneDriptoc** (7): this one got those hype horns that gives strong "going to the high school football field to watch a strip show" energy

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): the Instagram chat bots in my DM‚Äôs

## **Broke**

**AHSWeeknd** (6): @ whoever the producer was, this instrumental isn‚Äôt as killer as you think it is, turn it down.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): real sugar baby shit

**welcome2thejam** (6): Help why does this sound like what plays when the rival appears out of nowhere to battle you in Pokemon Red/Blue

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): a fun little interlude that went on too long

**fadedblue09** (1): this felt like a waste of time?

**akanewasright** (10): I was aware going into this rate that this song, one of my earliest favorites from this album, would be inherently divisive because of the whistling (and Meg following the whistle with her own hook), but MAN this song is fancam bait in the best possible way. You can almost feel the glittery quick cuts on the beat as she keeps going. Megan‚Äôs verses are fun as hell, but with a sense of red hot swagger that only adds to this song‚Äôs viral potential. I‚Äôm happy this got some love from some of y‚Äôall, it absolutely deserves.

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): I might be deaf for real because I didn‚Äôt hear those whistles until all the comments pointed it out?? Anyway, this is such a good deep cut. That hook just kicks you in the face and each subsequent line is just flex after flex. ‚ÄúTurned the whole world into a savage‚Äù like WHEW. I loved a lot of the features on Good News, but I really appreciate this one for just having Meg on the full runtime, it‚Äôs such a treat.

## **Pophead's politest**

**CrimsonROSET** (8): not much Megan what‚Äôs new with you

**bogo** (7): not much tbh megan how bout you

**noavocadoshere** (10): hot girl alert! hot girl alert! *whistles*

**prettybirbkotori** (10): one of my favorite meg songs, the beat and lyrics are so much fun

**throwaway-7650** (10): she really called me out with that credit card line... like omfg

**UselessTacooo** (10): I think she‚Äôs yelling at fantano fans

**WaneDriptoc** (9.1): the way she can land a "fuck....you!" or "what's...NEW?!" is akin to Roadhog chain hook'ing someone and blasting their ass in overwatch. FANTASTIC flow.

**BaconShoes** (9): just a great time

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**akanewasright** (10): This was on the cusp of day 2 and 3 for so long, I was so sad to see this drop down at the last moment‚Ä¶ But I was happy to see a lot of people get into this song, since I feel like it doesn‚Äôt get the love it deserves. It took a minute to grow on me, but its delectable production, fun lyrics, and brilliant rap verse all firmly set it as my favorite deep cut on the album. Sad to see it go, but happy it made it so far.

**cremeebrulee** (10): Now how was this one of the few tracks on Hot Pink that didn't go viral on Tiktok!! This is sultry perfection with so many intricacies to appreciate. The "Look." before the post-chorus? UGH!!! Also the entire "I'm just a little bit / just a little bit more" section is such a delicious earworm, it's really no wonder this is one of my most played songs on the album. There were moments this snuck up to Day 3 and I desperate wished it managed to stay there.

## **Get these raters lit**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): When this goes viral on TikTokTwo in 2025 and becomes a top 10 hit on the Amazon Prime 100 >>>>>>

**amr** (10): a song I've listened to more in my head than in real life

**Awkward\_King** (10): this feels like it could be such a slay tove/doja collab

**CrimsonROSET** (10): A GOOD SINGING VOICE? IN THIS RATE? HOLY SHIT

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): these lyrics are Lana coded to me, Amala think about what you‚Äôve done. I love it though, I need to think about what I‚Äôve done

**fadedblue09** (10): This song really showcases her versatility like wow

**ImADudeDuh** (10): what the fuck why is this so good and i have never seen this mentioned anywhere before

**UselessTacooo** (10): I AM ADDDDICCTEEEEYEYEYEDDDDDDD

**vayyiqra** (10): See this is a banger and it also passes my stringent test for "songs with lyrics that use addiction as a metaphor that aren't cringe (rare)"

**sa5m\_i\_am** (8.5): oh I guess I haven‚Äôt listened to this album‚Ä¶ thought I had because id heard the singles so many times but guess I‚Äôve only listened to Amala and Planet Her? This grew on me in a good way. A bit funky yeah? Its a groove.

**bogo** (8): this has a bit of a bossanova-ish sound that i fuck with a bit

**jasannn** (8): I was not expecting more funky production. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): the other weak song on the album for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): doja please dont ever try to do falsetto again

**WaneDriptoc** (6): the lyrics + beat combo don't entirely hit my q-zone; still pretty admirable. gotta appreciate getting into vices and being frustrated at how much you enjoy weed. been there doja.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the verses are fire, especially the second one, but the chorus falls flat

**runaway3212** (5): this is good but im very bored

**prettybirbkotori** (4): well produced but i don‚Äôt think it plays to her strengths

**akanewasright** (3): I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs controversial (at least among this audience) to say that I have not been impressed with most of Blackpink‚Äôs material for a long time, and this song is no exception to that. This isn‚Äôt the worst song in the bonus rate (for me) by a longshot, but I‚Äôm not impressed by this at all, and Cardi‚Äôs verse doesn‚Äôt redeem it at all for me. This does make me think though - it‚Äôs kind of crazy that 2/3 of the rappers in this rate have Kpop collabs and neither of them are Doja Cat. Like this is a woman who sings, raps, dances, and generally keeps a very light and feminine image, and you‚Äôre not busting down her door to get her on a song? Like maybe Twice can try and pick up on the momentum of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZogwmhamrH0) or something.

**cremeebrulee** (2): this is definitely a Blackpink song with a Cardi feature.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don‚Äôt know why people hate on Blackpink, they‚Äôre good

**Awkward\_King** (10): honestly yeah

**Hulnia** (10): bye it‚Äôs kinda giving love machine by girls aloud

**jay** (10): yup classic

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): deserved single treatment idc

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'm blink

**IIIHenryIII** (9): it sounds like what a blackpink song sounds like

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): maybe it‚Äôs relative but in relation to the other songs in the bonus rate this is a masterpiece

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): "an all night hug" vs "touch that lil dangly thing that hangs in the back of my throat"

**TiltControls** (7.5): this might be the most i've ever liked a blackpink song

**sydschoon** (7.2): I do like this song ngl, but maybe that's just because I identify as a BLINK

**BaconShoes** (7): It‚Äôs kind of a bop but also not the best

**Bordersz** (6.7): The first singer sounds like Demi Lovato w/o the notes or power though. I need Demi to cover this. This sounds like an outdated throwaway Demi song. I had an uncomfortable sense of deja vu listening to this.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): how is this the best song in th bonus rate ajdjdf

**oscarbrierley1** (5): i don't want the blinks to dox me so i'm not going to comment.

**starla\_** (5): the bananis and avocadies singing on this is puzzling

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): how do blackpink fans not get tired of them releasing the same 3 songs over and over

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): This isn‚Äôt the worst song in the bonus rate but it may just have the most out of place feature.

**bogo** (4): someone save these girls from yg's clutches so they can release actually listenable music more often

**UselessTacooo** (4): I bet you if you make me sweat I‚Äôll still be on fire üò≠

**welcome2thejam** (4): What a nothingburger of a song

**ricki** (3.5): the "something bout me's taking you higher" has the same melody as "let me be your superhero" in nmixx‚Äôs o.o

**Stryxen** (3.2): ‚Ä¶ hearing something

**DirtyRat583** (3): -1 point for the shit storytime blackpink put on this song

**ignitethephoenix** (3): why do all the North American artists collab with Blackpink, we need the Twice or Loona pop girlie collabs!

**jasannn** (3): rose and jisoo saving the song as always

**plastichaxan** (3): Bet you wanna skip this bonus rate

**runaway3212** (3): Blackpink was my third played artist of 2022 I was so embarrassed

**vayyiqra** (3): Even as a Blackpink apologist (they're post-good): yeah this kind of sucks

**noavocadoshere** (2): from the club to the tub...i hate wasted potential of features more than anything, and THIS is absolutely wasted. just lazy. this is the song that comes on when you're cooking, and your playlist is on shuffle but you're too busy trying not to burn your apartment down so you let it play.

**prettybirbkotori** (2): i‚Äôm not a blink in the slightest but i just know they had to stockholm syndrome themselves to stream this one

**RandomHypnotica** (2): this is so nothing like it's not even interesting enough to be background music

**sa5m\_i\_am** (2): I like blackpink most of the time‚Ä¶. Idk wtf this is or why it exists truthfully

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): are

**akanewasright** (10): Some of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt appreciate a 21 Savage verse like you should. Like how do you not hear the hot sauce lines and just smile? Either way, both him and Cardi nailed it. This was a great vehicle for her to prove herself as more than a one hit wonder, and she took it and rode it as hard as she could.

**cremeebrulee** (8): This was a pretty decent follow up to Bodak‚Äî I especially dig the sinister sounding production and the tongue twister-y verses. Also I‚Äôm not sure why but the phrase ‚ÄúCardi got your bitch on molly‚Äù makes me crack the fuck up. 21 Savage also serves on this, though that doesn't save him from the male-feature-apocalypse...

---

## **Cardi is doing what**

**DaHumanTorch** (10): CARDI PUT THE PUSSY ON OFFSET

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): offset listening to this like üëÅÔ∏èüëÑüëÅÔ∏è

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): girl we get it‚Ä¶you put the pussy on offset

## **21 is doing WHAT**

**frogaranaman** (10): 21 puts hot sauce on her tittes, Drake puts hot sauce in his condoms. they are not the same

**shipperondeck** (10): i will always rate 21 highly here... yes i heard the hot sauce on tiddies line

**bogo** (8): that's a pretty wasteful way to use hot sauce, savage

**MassiveThief** (8): "I pulled the rubber off and I put hot sauce on her titties" thanks 21, very cool!

**camerinian** (7.5): the terror of waiting to find out where 21 was gonna put that hot sauce after taking off the rubber

**sydschoon** (7.1): i put hot sauce on her titties

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): so I'm sitting there, hot sauce on my tiddies

**vayyiqra** (4): I'm sorry sir you put hot sauce on what now

## **In a 'rari**

**musical\_pyn** (11): idk, I just think this song embodies the spirit of this rate the best, Cardi is very solid and 21 is an excellent and well-used feature

**AHSWeeknd** (10): 21 did something for me here

**amr** (10): dr seuss U're nothing btw

**BaconShoes** (10): When this came out, it kind of cemented for me that she wasn‚Äôt just going to be a one hit wonder because it was such a bop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I sent my bitch to the store 'cause we ran out of soda

**gt\_official09** (10): girl she absolutely devoured savage verse also is super fun and love his adlibs

**Stryxen** (10): omg hiiiiii 21 <3 *giggles cutely while kicking feet*

**UselessTacooo** (10): LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**WaneDriptoc** (10): oh for fucking fucks sake negativland voice ITS ANOTHER PERFECT CUT. like what da fuck is it about this broad and her flow? she literally like using a barrett with acog on Afghan and just spawn camping the haters going off about getting to bang offset and being rich and cool. Even 21 savage is like..."okay Imma take copycat off and put painkiller on so I hold a chance" here for the verse where he says "im in a gang and i love banging chicks that think im hot shit bc i have a rich car". its just unabashedly over the top pulped out and somehow...yeah the conspicuous consumption MAKES A POINT. Ice on them Cardi B Cartier frames, bitch.

**runaway3212** (9.9): This is perfect but 21's verse is so fucking bad

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): will never not chuckle at 21 savage british

**Bordersz** (9.5): Chorus goes crazy as hell. Her flow is INSANE. Production is FIRE. Everything. 21 is the worst pick for this song bc his energy sucks all of the energy out of the song. I hate it.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt eat pussy I‚Äôm fasting‚Äù is driving me irrationally mad but the hook is so catchy

**1998tweety** (9): this would be a 10 without some of 21's horrid lines. The chorus goes OFF

**CrimsonROSET** (9): fast and the furious energy

**IIIHenryIII** (9): ‚Äúcartier cardi‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt have sounded better

**ricki** (8.5): i will forever associate this song with that one tiktok jock that got viral for getting one of his thirst traps dueted by a girl being like ‚Äúhey:) instead of being shirtless at a gas station, could you instead do your part in our project? you havent done anything‚Äù

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is not one of 21 Savage‚Äôs best verses but Cardi is great here.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): the 21 savage verse is the limpest rap verse i‚Äôve had to listen to omfg.

**jay** (8): yupppp

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i did not get this song when it was released but i get it now

**welcome2thejam** (8): I would like to party with Cardi

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): Please tip

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): something about this title is hurts my brain like... it should either be barti cardi, or bartier cardier

**flava** (7): Times Cardi says Cardi - 48

**prettybirbkotori** (7): this woman knew how to pick a single god damn

## **On molly**

**plastichaxan** (6.5): There was no need to have this many men in the album she‚Äôs great on her own

**impla77** (6.3): i don‚Äôt need to know your relations with offset thank you

**starla\_** (5.5): I have to be in the right mood to enjoy this song and I'm not in it today

**noavocadoshere** (5): cardi jackson if you nasty. i really can't choose whose feature was more annoying, chance or 21...21...21...

**nt96** (5): how you gonna have savage in your name but your giving mellow yellow nothingness?

**oscarbrierley1** (3): 21's verse has some really weird lyrics, at least that part is interesting. the rest is extremely repetitive. the words upset and offset have lost all meaning.

**akanewasright** (9): This was always on the edge of making day 3, but in the end it didn‚Äôt *quite* pull through. Personally‚Ä¶ I think this song could‚Äôve easily been a massive hit if it got a push. *Good News* featured a few turns to pop for Megan that didn‚Äôt work super well, but I think making a pop-rap song with a SZA chorus (especially with that Adina Howard sample) was a slam dunk to get her on pop radio. It‚Äôs not the best reflection of Megan‚Äôs true range of skills as a rapper, but it is a very well done pop song.

**cremeebrulee** (5): Eh, it's honestly been near the lower end of my ranking of Good News songs. I don't think it brings anything new with the sample (like I would just rather listen to Freak Like Me) and Meg doesn't quite have any memorable zingers like she does on other tracks. I'm okay with seeing it not make Day 3 tbh.

## **https://open.spotify.com/album/1nrVofqDRs7cpWXJ49qTnP**

**UselessTacooo** (8): SZA my beloved where is SOS

**throwaway-7650** (10): SZA's mother again for releasing SOS [confirmed]

## **Kinky**

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i loved Freak Like Me before it was cool on this side of the internet (aka before the Todd in the Shadows episode) and Megan/SZA is the perfect combo for a modern spin on it. not groundbreaking but expertly ass shaking

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The instrumental couldn‚Äôt keep up with Megan, but SZA and Megan go well together

**Awkward\_King** (10): scissor

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is so much better than the other SZA song in this rate. Honestly gun to my head I cannot even remember what that one was titled.

**bogo** (10): we love sza

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly sza really brings this together

**fadedblue09** (10): Finally some good fucking music

**ImADudeDuh** (10): THREE QUEENS MAXIMIZING THEIR JOINT SLAY (i am including Adina Howard)

**oscarbrierley1** (10): freak like me always eats in any situation. i'm surprised it wasn't made a single because to me its one of the more radio ready songs.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i love when i can't understand what sza is saying

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Freak Like Me is one of the best songs of the 90s

**seanderlust** (9.5): i need more SZA and megan collabs ASAP

**WaneDriptoc** (9.1): "on that dilla shit?" clippy the paperclip voice are you SURE megan?

**BaconShoes** (9): freaky girls to the dance floor!!!

**jay** (9): yupppp

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): real freaky girl shit

**nt96** (8): oh wow I can tell what SZA is saying!

**RandomHypnotica** (8): the superior SZA cut here

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Great sample, song is okay

**welcome2thejam** (8): Yeah this was the better one

**ricki** (7.8): congratulations on your good use of sza as a feature in this song, which is not easy to get, not everyone in this rate has that

**prettybirbkotori** (7.5): i like sza on this song more than megan but the whole song is still great

## **Vanilla**

**shipperondeck** (7.2): i wanna like this more but it just feels all over the place

**noavocadoshere** (6.5): idk what meg did, but sza's pronunciation is crystal clear on freaky girls. otherwise, it's just there for me. idk if meg + sza compliment each other but would be open to a future collab with this duo.

**frogaranaman** (6): exorcist movies trying to decide who their next protagonist is

**sa5m\_i\_am** (6): its alright but nothing special.. expected more from SZA truthfully

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): a shame it‚Äôs only the girls cuz the song ain‚Äôt
