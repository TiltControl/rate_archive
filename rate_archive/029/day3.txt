An introspective but sarcastic song, Smile Like You Mean It feels like a rehash of other Killers songs to me. It‚Äôs still pretty good, because the Killers are very good by default, but not my favorite from the album. However, I love the bridge when he sings, ‚ÄúAnd someone is calling my name‚Ä¶‚Äù It‚Äôs very interesting and paints a picture in your mind of your own memories and how you‚Äôre becoming older, too. 

---

##They do mean it

**agentofscranton** (10): finding out the meaning of this song really helped me realize why die-hard Killers stans have such an affinity for it

**shineflyer** (10): I can't even verbalize why this song is so good. The instruments just melt together to make an emotion I can't even recognize. It feels like one of those songs that just represent life as a whole.

**LuckyKidA** (9.5): Remember when The Killers played this song on The OC? It was dope.

**scoutfincher** (9.5): I really adore the way the opening riff builds up and just explodes into a burst of energy and killer (pardon the pun) synths. The chorus is simple but powerful in its own way. The bridge is so good and so is the outro. It‚Äôs such a cool song about growing up.

**bigtimesurreality** (9): Another catchy af song!

**carvelbabel** (9): Ok real talk, I cried to this song ‚Äì really this whole album but also specifically this song ‚Äì a few too many times when my 7th grade boyfriend broke up with me to get with the captain of the junior high cheerleading team (seriously where tf was taylor when I needed her in 2004??). It‚Äôs fine though at least I had Brandon Flowers to convince 12-year-old me to change my ways while I was still young and that I‚Äôd grow up and find a man to help me understand lmao

**anemonone** (8.5): Love the guitar

**1313Harbor** (8): The Nordstrom near me loves to play this song for some reason.

**Mrachnie** (8): I really love the use of synthesizers on this one.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Killer This Song Sounds Like: Jack the Ripper

##Not worth smiling over

**vapourlomo** (8): The whole first half of Hot Fuss is untouchable, but if there's a weak link, this is it. Not saying Smile is a bad song; it's got a nice melancholy vibe, but it simply isn't as grabbing as the four songs surrounding it.

**enecks** (7): I find it hard to smile on command. One of the many reasons I despise being in photos.

**themobiler99** (7): Love the instrumentation and lead guitar, love his damn voice, great mid tempo number, but not a standout.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): It lacks lyrically, but it's a decent song otherwise.

**mokitsu** (6.5): i was too busy writing my Mr Brightside comment to listen to this but it seemed nice!

**MrSwearword** (5): for a 2004 album, this is some dated as fuck 1997 alt-rock realness

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i get a really weird perverted vibe from the lead singer here when he says to smile like you mean it

One of my favorite songs from the Killers and also a part of the murder trilogy. This song describes the aftermath of ‚ÄúMidnight Show,‚Äù where he killed Jenny, and takes place in the police station when he‚Äôs getting interrogated by the police about it. But like he says, ‚ÄúJenny was a friend of mine!‚Äù

You can hear him agonizing over the murder in his voice ‚Äî ‚ÄúShe said she loved me! ‚Ä¶but, she had somewhere to go.‚Äù A fantastic opener to a fantastic album. Also, this song‚Äôs baseline is amazing. 

---

##Luckier than Jenny

**agentofscranton** (10): an angry bop

**atlastata** (10): That bassline is incredible.

**enecks** (10): This bassline makes me quiver like when people PM me furry porn

**vapourlomo** (10): It's like Law & Order: The Song! Except way sleeker and more Vegas-y. Brandon Flowers would win an Emmy for this deliciously evil performance, fyi.

**anemonone** (9.5): I love songs with a storyline, and this particular one is so interesting. Sets the mood perfectly.

**bigtimesurreality** (9): Love the "space-y" intro and also this song is catchy af!

**rickikardashian** (9): the guitar pattern is amazing yas

**1313Harbor** (8.5): With this song, the Murder trilogy is complete. ‚ÄúShe couldn't scream while I held her throat‚Äù are the superior lyrics that Brandon sings live, and that‚Äôs mostly why I love this song: the secret murder.

**scoutfincher** (8.2): I love songs that tell a good story. This song gives me the chills, from Brandon‚Äôs delivery to the dark synths and guitar riffs, and the helicopter blades and police sirens in the intro are really cool.

**sletrab07** (8.2): A strong intro to a strong album. The ‚ÄúOh, come on‚Äù lyric was made for crowds to chant it back, it‚Äôs anthemic.

**carvelbabel** (8): Despite the dark subject matter being potentially risky this is a solid debut album opener. Also, the bassline is iconic. Not my favorite song from a lyrical standpoint but I do like how they would sometimes switch up lines during live performances to make it seem like the singer did or didn‚Äôt kill Jenny.

**jamesfog** (8): The production is a little muddled

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Killer This Song Sounds Like: Ted Bundy

**shineflyer** (7.3): the bass is so good. They probably could have used a better synth on the verses, but every other choice is pretty damn golden.

ü§îü§îü§î

**dropthehammer11** (7): A nice opener. But seriously how is this dude not British?


##Not a friend of mine

**Mrachnie** (7): Starting your album with a song about strangling your ex isn't the best idea. The verses are REALLY good and i love love love the bassline, but that chorus is a dud.

**MrSwearword** (7): good opener but the vocals feel drowned out by the production (yes, even through his screaming)

**NapsAndNetflix** (7): pretty generic killers sound here, nothing amazing but nothing bad either

**themobiler99** (7): Does a great job of establishing the sound of the album. A rock sound with both a heavy guitar presence and a heavy synth presence. Great vocals, ok lyrics. Who‚Äôs Jenny anyway and why do I care?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Decent start. Instrumental at the end is nice. Sounds like he killed Jenny though?

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Good opener, but far from the best on the album

**mokitsu** (6): a biT boring

I view this song as a precursor to Fix You‚Ä¶an introspective song that‚Äôs sort of part ballad but part soft rock at the same time. However, while it‚Äôs not as good as Fix You, it‚Äôs still a classic in its own right. Like other songs on the album, Chris asks big questions about life and also shares his human struggles with getting through it all. 

---

**carvelbabel** (10): I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for this one. I just think it does such a good job of capturing a lot of different complex emotions really succinctly.

**mokitsu** (9.5): a damn blassic

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): King of making repetition sound heavenly. Also looking forward to reading some assays about this song.

**dropthehammer11** (9): A nice, brighter contrast to the opener.

**shineflyer** (9): chill, yet dramatic. the strings and organ sound cool together, and the drum intro is iconic tbh

**vapourlomo** (9): Yes, the lyrics are stupid and meaningless, but that doesn't matter when you're singing along at the top of your lungs. Chris Martin manages to make even the most random words drip with emotion.

**bigtimesurreality** (8.5): A good, catchy guitar rift and the organ that's in the background for some parts is a nice touch.

**sletrab07** (8.2): If it hadn‚Äôt been written first, I wouldn‚Äôt have picked this for lead single. However, that guitar/drum riff is pretty classic.

**anemonone** (8): Why am I crying? This song touches me, the way Chris sings sounds so longing...

**CrispyEggs123** (8): I almost love this song, I don't for some reason

**Marshynarsh** (8): Such a relaxing song

**Mrachnie** (8): I like this song a lot. It's very catchy and the lyrics are emotional.

**MrSwearword** (8): this song may be whiter than a Hillshire Farm turkey sandwich with Hellmann‚Äôs mayonnaise on Wonder bread, but at least it is a Coldplay song worth recognizing.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A classic Coldplay album track here. It‚Äôs one of the better ones off this album imo, a wistful pop rock bop that just hits all the right notes and has this really nice texture to it.

**whatyourheartdesires** (8): I am not a fan of Colplay so somehow I completely forgot about this song but it is really good

**themobiler99** (7.9): Good single, but hasn't aged as well as their best. Great first drum pattern to learn when you‚Äôre picking up the instrument.

**scoutfincher** (7): The lyrics are a bit simplistic, but I don‚Äôt mind because the song sounds really mellow and pretty.

A smooth, jazzy classic. This song is Maroon 5 at their best, and is one of the best songs of the whole decade, honestly. 

---

##Never want to leave

**hdhdhdhdh** (11): anthem of important early relationships you'll ultimately outgrow

**themobiler99** (11): This song. THIS SONG. THIIIIIIIS SOOOOOOONG. Always been and always will be my fav Maroon 5 track. Perfect kick drum sound, i know it‚Äôs a weird thing to pick up on but it‚Äôs true! Those piano chords are iconic. The mumbly ad libs and little occasional female voxs and spoken word bits sprinkled here and there are a great plot device. ‚ÄúI liike thaaat.‚Äù AND THERE‚ÄùS A SAX/GUITAR HYBRID SOLO? BONKERS! And it goes without mentioning that the melody is perfection, the lyrics are gorgeous and meaningful and perfect and the singing is transcendental god tier levels of awesome. One of my favorite pop much moments ever is the end of the bridge, the way Adam sings ‚ÄúMay not know that may be Allllllll IIIIIIII Neeeeed.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt come across in text but it‚Äôs just orgasmic.

**agentofscranton** (10): if you'd told me back in the 00s that the same band that made this song, would eventually make trend-chasing trop-pop like Don't Wanna Know, i would've shat on your feet

**anemonone** (10): I heard this song at a coffee shop one Sunday morning. It felt so perfect, it's a great Sunday song; bright, shining, and warm...Definitely a ten.

**carvelbabel** (10): Easily one of THE best songs of the early 2000s in general. Amazing in every way ‚Äì lyrically, instrumentally, production wise. Sunday Morning is everything good in this world. This is where I would insert the Lady Gaga ‚Äútalented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before‚Äù clip/gif if that were a thing in rates.

**CrispyEggs123** (10): This is peak Maroon 5 tbh

**ExtraEater** (10): just 36 years before Maroon 5 released their debut, The Velvet Underground released Sunday Morning as a single. this song has no relation to that (as far as i can tell), but i gotta say, they're both just as good. yeah that's it.

**MihaMijat** (10): There isn't much I can say about this song, it's just amazing and everybody knows that.

**mustangs16** (10): such a sweet, happy song that just always makes me smile

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Do I even need to justify this one? It‚Äôs such a feel-good sound, and it‚Äôs a staple of every TJ Maxx now and forever. This is probably their best track, a smooth blissful explosion that just is impossible to deny is great. If you give this song a bad score I‚Äôm making sure you not only get banned from the sub, but your respective country.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): The words I can use to describe this song is relaxing and refreshing for some reason. I also love the little jazz influence on it too.

**poppinmmolly** (9.5): this is a great little song

**enecks** (9): A slick bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): i'm cramping too much to think of what to write but i like it for some reason

**1313Harbor** (8.5): That shoutout to The Killers - ‚ÄúCome and rest your bones with me‚Äù. Nevermind that the song Bones came out in 2006.

**scoutfincher** (8.2): This is a really sweet, lovely little song about spending the day with your love. Totally feels like something you could actually play on a weekend morning to relax. And I‚Äôm a sucker for a good saxophone in a song.

**MrSwearword** (8): I‚Äôll be nice and credit him for delivery [and not a goddamn thing else]

**rickikardashian** (8): why do they have some rock that goes off and some other more jazzy/soul songs

**sletrab07** (7.8): Their best chord progression/bridge, to be honest. Fun fact: I once masturbated to this song. Not, like, directly. It was just playing on the radio during.

**mokitsu** (7.5): is this a HIT? sounds like one

**shineflyer** (7.5): wish my Sunday mornings were like this.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): song is ok but the album is starting to get repetitive.

**DraculaWeekend** (7): Cute, feel-good song

**dropthehammer11** (7): This song is like a joyful stroll on a sunny day in the city

##We prefer Mondays

**Mrachnie** (4): I don't really care for the saccharine songs on this album. They feel fake and insincere

**vapourlomo** (2): I watched a lot of American Idol as a kid, and this song has been ruined because of all the faux-bohemians that covered this song with an acoustic guitar. Easily my least favorite Maroon 5 song. I'd rather listen to their current, sell-out era stuff.

What can I say about this song besides the fact that it‚Äôs a perfect slow ballad love song? Cliche lyrics or not, it is. I‚Äôll let others do the talking on why. 

---

##No longer outside in the pouring rain

**MihaMijat** (11): As some may know, this is not only my favorite Maroon 5 song, but my favorite song of all time. From the first time that I have listened to it, to this day, I love it just as much. An iconic song, one of the biggest classics of the 00s, pop-rock perfection, that made sure I always remained a stan, no matter how many Don't Wanna Know's they release. Just hope people don't do this wrong because their modern stuff is not nearly as good as this.

**mustangs16** (11): I literally cannot describe how much this song means to me. It‚Äôs my favorite song E V E R. It got me through a really rough time in my life and helped me heal emotionally. Sometimes it makes me cry a little, but in general it makes me feel strong and I just. Yeah.

**Nfranklin50** (11): Honestly everything about this song is so good and iconic. When he puts that little extra run on the lines in the verses is so just great. The melody is gorgeous, the chorus is amazing, his vocals are amazing. This song is like the definition of 2000's and love to me

**rickikardashian** (11): this song is the reason I got myself to do this rate

**agentofscranton** (10): I remember being real emo back when I was like 8 or 9 and just listening to this song and staring out the window longingly

**anemonone** (10): There's just something about the way this song makes me feel... such good memories, too

**Damoojo** (10): An iconic bop. This was literally the only song I knew from this album.

**dropthehammer11** (10): Such a smooth, pleasant song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is the best Maroon 5 song and I don‚Äôt think many people can disagree on this. Such a beautiful songs where you can really feel the emotions.

**piccprincess** (10): TINK TINK TINK TINK TINK

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is probably the best chorus in the whole rate. It‚Äôs so sprawling and beautiful, each line unraveling more and more of this love between them, and it just strikes a chord with people. Every time I listen through Songs About Jane, I always get a little bittersweet, because I wish Adam would make songs like this again. It‚Äôs selfish to ask that, but there‚Äôs some shred of humanity here that makes the song feel less like a song and more like an autobiography.

**themobiler99** (10): Lyrics that get better every year I get older and a melody that will be remembered in 50 years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not always rainbows and butterflies it‚Äôs compromise it moves us along‚Ä¶‚Äù is one of the best lines ever. I love the way the guitars and pianos build up subtly in the background of the verses. The bridge gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. ‚ÄúI know that goodbye means nothing at all, CUZ THAT KID MAKES ME CATCH HER EVERY TIME SHE FALLS.‚Äù GOOSBUMPS. Oh and then the guitars come on super thick and majestic in the last hook. And the backing vocals at the end! AHHH! This guy arranges.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Can you believe this is the same band that made Sugar?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.9): honestly this is a lovely song and i think it's cute but it's kind of forgettable like i usually don't like sappy songs but this one's adorable

**enecks** (9): A nice sentiment

**poppinmmolly** (9): a wonderful song about a prostitute.

**scoutfincher** (9): This is a really solid ballad with a cool bossa nova vibe. It does a good job selling me on Adam‚Äôs longing for this girl. It's very beautiful.

**vapourlomo** (9): Gorgeous, super-catchy, what more could you want from a pop ballad? I'm sure somebody will have crazy personal story about how important this song is to them...I just think it's a pretty great song.

**Mysario** (8.5): I hate myself for liking any part of this song

**carvelbabel** (8): The song itself is perfect. It‚Äôs beautiful, timeless, amazingly written, and has a touchingly sincere feel to it. But the music video. Oh god, the music video. Don‚Äôt even get me started on that fucking music video; I can rant for hours. Why would you take such an innocent song and completely decimate it with such a dumb concept? I mean, get with any rich milf you want if that‚Äôs what floats your boat but you know what would be great to do before that? BREAK UP WITH HER DAUGHTER FIRST BEFORE GETTING WITH SAID MILF. Or you could, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶. ENCOURAGE THE MILF TO LEAVE AND DIVORCE HER ABUSIVE HUSBAND AND GET HER SHIT TOGETHER BEFORE YOU START HAVING SEX. It‚Äôs not rocket science to not be a shitty person - break up w/ current partner/spouse, THEN ask the milf with the broken smile if she wants to stay awhile and she will be loved. (I mean you‚Äôre still sort of trash for getting with the mom of your current gf but the least you could do is break things off with her first). Speaking of which, what the hell is wrong with that messy woman? Terrible mother. God I hate that music video so much. Maybe I‚Äôd be more forgiving if this was a song ABOUT CHEATING but it‚Äôs not!! There were so many concepts that could have been done for the music video to this song that would have been so beautiful but instead they gave us this horseshit. This song would be a perfect 10 if that asinine music video never existed but as it is, the song is slightly tainted for me every time I hear it because associated memories of that imbecilic video make me triggered (clearly lmfao).

**LuckyKidA** (7.6): The only decent song Maroon 5 has ever recorded.

**sletrab07** (7.6): Classic story. Again, the chorus of the song has dated poorly. The vocals definitely save it, though. I always love that outro.

##Not lovin‚Äô it‚Ñ¢

**Banananaise** (7): inferior to the true 2000s romantic masterpiece, James Blunt's "You're Beautiful"

**shineflyer** (7): I liked it, let's not jump to "loved." Even if it is the side of M5 I'd rather the GP didn't jump onto like they did, it's still a sweet little tune.

**mokitsu** (4): adam's annoying ass nasal voice ruins this completely...

**Mrachnie** (4): I guess i don't mind the instumental? Adam sounds so sappy and i just don't believe these lyrics coming from someone who has lyrics like "I have the tendency of getting very physical, So watch your step cause if I do you'll need a miracle"

**MrSwearword** (1): I honestly detest this song; all the comments of Levine sounding like a castrated chipmunk come from this song and in this case, they‚Äôre right.

**DraculaWeekend** (0): Worst song on the album and possibly ever

**milkywayinradius** (0): The lyrics did not age well, couldn't roll my eyes harder at them

Ah, up tempo Maroon 5 after all those slower love songs! Here Maroon 5 is angry and you can *feel it*. This song was a fantastic opener and let‚Äôs you know right away that Adam is having relationship struggles, which he will document all throughout the album.  

---

**piccprincess** (11): The panting sound in the chorus is a recording of me because Adam Levine makes it harder to breathe

**anemonone** (10): One of the best early 2000s bops, great drums, great vocals, great everything!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): goddamn this is a great "fuck you" song

**MihaMijat** (10): An amazing, iconic debut single. Really shows that they work amazing in edgier, pure rock songs

**Mrachnie** (10): Wow, this is a GREAT way to start an album. I like how the lyrics portray a relationship that is unhealthy for both sides. Also that chorus is incredibly catchy.

**mustangs16** (10): the perfect song to open up an almost perfect album

**poppinmmolly** (10): I fuckin love this song

**shineflyer** (10): They kicked off this album so hard. Just fuck me up. I'd still consider this my favorite Maroon 5 track.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Easy 10. A fierce, smart pop song. From the breaths after the chorus to the loud guitar work, it‚Äôs a damn fire introduction to an album, and luckily for listeners, it doesn‚Äôt go downhill from here.

**themobiler99** (10): GOAT POP ROCK INTRO TRACK EVER COME AT ME BRO. The filtered bouncy alien drums on at the beginning are perfect, Adam‚Äôs delivery is perfect, the lyrics are legit good. Fuuuuuck this song encapsulates every that Maroon 5 was and still should be. You‚Äôre not fit to fucking tread the ground that I am walking on if you don‚Äôt give this song the respect it deserves.

**bigtimesurreality** (9): Sexy-love the panting! The album starts out strong- this is an old favorite of mine. And that guitar-heavy bridge is heavenly.

**callmetidle** (9): **What happened? What the fuck haapppeeennned?**

**mokitsu** (9): a bop and a half

**vapourlomo** (9): It feels so weird to hear Maroon 5 make a straight-up RAWK song, but hey, Adam Levine pulls off pissed-off well. It would be nice to hear them try another song like this, but it'll never happen :(

**mirandacrocsgrove** (8.7): a really good can opener followed by a stronger song

**scoutfincher** (8.2): This song has a great bassline and I love how frustrated Adam sounds here. The sounds of hyperventilating during the chorus are an interesting touch too.

**carvelbabel** (8): Omfg is it not the sexiest thing ever when his voice lowers and kind of tenses at the end of the first chorus‚Äôs ‚Äúis there anyone out there cause it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to breathe?‚Äù

**MrSwearword** (8): mainly because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to their label for wanting another song.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): wow this is so much more pleasing to listen to than the killers

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Promising start.

**sletrab07** (7.3): I always confuse this song with Rob Thomas‚Äô¬†Lonely No More. The song is one of their classics, no doubt, but those guitars are just dated. Time hasn‚Äôt been kind to this song, which is held up by some strong melodic writing in the chorus.

**enecks** (7): I still don't like Adam's vocals

**1313Harbor** (6.5): Even though it was 15 years ago, this one suffers from radio overplay for me.

This song just *rocks*. The baseline is incredible, the production keeps you moving, Brandon‚Äôs exasperated voice pierces through you and makes you feel his agony.

**enecks** (11): Yeah I like this more than Mr Brightside. That bassline in the chorus makes me quiver like -redacted-

**Mrachnie** (11): This song is nearly perfect. That is all i have to say.

**1313Harbor** (10): Makes me feel like I‚Äôm dancing furiously in the club. The bass line gets me so hyped.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Truly iconic

**JonathanSloanAUS** (10): This brings me right back to Year 1 at school, everyone was obsessed with this.

**sletrab07** (10): Now, THIS is the best song on Hot Fuss. It has the story element of Brightside, but with an instantly iconic melody. It‚Äôs not often you come across a song where both verse AND chorus have instantly recognisable melodies, yet STM gets the double rainbow.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Killer This Song Sounds Like: Charles Edmund Cullen

**themobiler99** (10): Second greatest indie singalong track ever? I still remember this song playing at a 7th grade dance and though I‚Äôd heard it before, I really heard the lyrics for the first time and was briefly paralyzed. ?Boyfriend that looks like girlfriend? February? Who‚Äôs rushing? Whatever let‚Äôs jam and definitely not talk to any girls all night!

**vapourlomo** (10): This song should replace "Viva Las Vegas" as the city's unofficial anthem. It's so catty and glitzy and ridiculous and I love it.

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): relatable

**bigtimesurreality** (9.5): This is straight up pop and it's really fun to sing along to

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I love the verses of this song and how intense they are. The chorus is pretty iconic and great too.

**anemonone** (9.2): B O P

**shineflyer** (9): would rush a Russian around again. It's dance-rock at it's finest. The chorus is a bit of genderfuck, which I'm down with. The bassline is deep within my heart as well. I can see it being a bit cheesy for some people, but I still adore this.

**scoutfincher** (8.5): Man, this song is great. Another strong, synth-laden track with an awesome bridge that gives me goosebumps whenever I hear it. And ‚Äúsomebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looks like a girlfriend that I had in February of last year‚Äù and ‚Äúnever thought I‚Äôd let a rumor ruin my moonlight‚Äù are just solid lines.

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): Very catchy hook and riffs here

##Didn‚Äôt learn their name

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): this sounds like love drunk by boys like girls to a point that i actually thought that's what it was. anyway that other song is better

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): The hook and the bridge are very nice, but once again the lyrics are quite underwhelming.

**mokitsu** (7): the verses >>> the chorus

**Marshynarsh** (4): This was always a very eh song to me, pretty generic, overplayed and sub par to the amazingness of Mr. Brightside that became a hit shortly after

~~*Wow it‚Äôs almost like the lyrics aren‚Äôt literal*~~

**MrSwearword** (4): good verses but that chorus fucking blows. So what if someone‚Äôs boyfriend looks like a ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù? Jackass

This song is up there with The Black Parade as one of the most iconic anthems. It‚Äôs five minutes long but it never gets boring; you can scream along the entire time. 

---

##Most iconic line tbh

**scoutfincher** (11): My all-time favorite Killers song. I absolutely enjoy the intro. I love the delivery. I love ‚ÄúI got soul but I‚Äôm not a soldier.‚Äù I love the way that choir of vocals kicks in during the bridge. It‚Äôs just so, so good.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I GOT SOUL BUT I'M NOT A SOLDIER

##We‚Äôve got a soul

**1313Harbor** (11): I will forever be obsessed with this song even if it‚Äôs clich√© to love it.

**carvelbabel** (11): This song is so slept on, should have won a Grammy, and is possibly my personal favorite Killers song of all time. OF ALL TIME, Y‚ÄôALL. I mean seriously, that slow buildup in the beginning, the perfect marriage of alt-rock and synth-pop, and if the song‚Äôs message is taken literally re: the destruction and despair that war causes and the lasting effects it has on those fighting said wars, it is truly haunting and beautiful esp. in today‚Äôs political climate ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs nowhere else to run, is there room for one more son?‚Äù, ‚ÄúOver and over, last call for sin. Everyone's lost, the battle is won, with all these things that I've done‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got soul but I‚Äôm not a soldier‚Äù.

**CrispyEggs123** (11): One of my fave songs ever...

**Marshynarsh** (11): Such an amazing song and probably my all time favourites of The Killers


**anemonone** (10): Mormon king slay me! His vocals here are always what stood out to me, the staccato style especially, so unique.

**berober04** (10): I don't think there's a more perfect 5-song than Jenny to All These Things. Everything just clicks together, and while I know there are more songs to go, this truly feels like the perfect capper to that stretch.

**bigtimesurreality** (10): I love the lo-fi effects. The choir "I got soul" and "you gotta help me out" parts make this another classic Killers anthem! Andy, You're a Star:

**DraculaWeekend** (10): I GOT SOUL BUT I'M NOT A SOLDIER

**mustangs16** (10): this would be getting my 11 if Songs About Jane wasn‚Äôt one of the other albums, tbh. It‚Äôs like one of the best songs to scream/sing along to.

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): honestly hot take but this is the best killers single sorry mr brightside, sorry human, sorry the man.

**poppinmmolly** (10): if I was allowed another 11 this would be it. It's an amazing song with different parts. Like Bohemian Rhapsody or Welcome To The Black Parade. I love songs like that.

**themobiler99** (10): Perfection, iIwould marry this song if it were legal and would support me financially. Unfortunately I‚Äôll have to settle for screaming along to it at the top of my lungs. Am I the only one who can‚Äôt decide which layer of the harmony to sing along with during the ‚ÄúI got soul‚Äù breakdown?

**Mrachnie** (9): I really like this. I'm not religious so i can't exactly relate to the lyrics, however they seem very personal and emotional.

**shineflyer** (9): i've got soul, boy, but i'm not a soulja boy. (but for real, that chorus that joins in? rad af. And Brandon sounds great with filtered vocals.)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Killer This Song Sounds Like: Luis Garavito

**vapourlomo** (9): I don't like this song as much as I did in high school when I thought it was ~so deep~, but it's still a fantastic U2 knockoff.

**sletrab07** (8.5): Such strong melodic writing/Flowers‚Äô distinctive voice makes it pop.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): It's certainly an ambitious song. There's a lot going on and it sounds pretty good. Gets repetitive near the end, but not enough to have a negative impact on the song.

**JonathanSloanAUS** (8): This went off live last week. Given me a whole new appreciation for the song.

***Someone‚Äôs cranky***

**ExtraEater** (7.5): "I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier". Of course. Yes. Right. It is wrong to assume somebody is a soldier just because they have soul. I'll have to keep that in mind. Make sure I don't forget it please. Repeat it over and over. Reinforce this important point you're trying to make. Seriously, he could be singing "I've got toes, but I'm not a toaster" and it would be no less ridiculous. "I've got feet, but I'm not a foetus", "I feel pain, but I'm not a paintbrush", "I stay home, but I'm not a homo", "I make sense, but I'm not a censor". "All These Things That I've Done" is a reasonably enjoyable song despite the obvious flaws, and is somehow comfortably one of the highlights for me, despite often making me laugh. There are a few reasonably enjoyable songs on this album. The lyrics frequently seem stupid or utterly meaningless to me. I prefer it when I don't really notice them. They are not a strength, obviously. I'm not a toaster. I just wish this had more soldier... I mean soul.

##Um, what?

**MrSwearword** (7): it doesn‚Äôt do anything interesting until about a minute in. From there, it‚Äôs fine.

**mokitsu** (5.5): filler

I really don‚Äôt have much to say about this song beyond the fact that it‚Äôs a pop classic. This song cemented Maroon 5 into what they are now: a band that can put out crap and still make it go #1. While this is partly to do with them being general trend chasers, I believe it also has a nostalgic component to it: people hear Adam‚Äôs voice on the radio and it takes them back to the times where they were releasing songs like this. 

---

##Can‚Äôt say goodbye anymore

**MrSwearword** (11): sanction me or Crimea river; I like this corny ass song a lot.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): SO GOOD

**dropthehammer11** (10): Such a bop. One of the first pop songs I can remember

**MihaMijat** (10): Honestly a masterpiece that started their careers, and a 00s classic for a reason.

**mokitsu** (10): iconic legendary etc!

**Mrachnie** (10): I love the keyboard and the lyrics of this song. I am scared i might like this album.

**Nfranklin50** (10): This melody has been stuck in my head my entire life

**poppinmmolly** (10): this song was one of my favorites as a child. Every time this came on the radio in the car my parents would turn back to me and say "it's your song, Molly!" the song really holds up!

**rickikardashian** (10): [me trying to sing the main vocals, the choruses, harmonies, fringe, guitars and bass]

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): yeah it's a bop even if adam levine's voice is whiny

**shineflyer** (10): The Groove(R). Pop royalty.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Love the drums here so much. Adam just like murders his delivery here, and it‚Äôs seriously just pop rock brilliance. The chorus is super iconic, one of the most noticeable and catchy ones from the album, and it goes back and forth between angst and heartbreak. I‚Äôve you never sang along to this, then I really have no words for you. This is an essential part of living in America during the 2000s.

**themobiler99** (10): Seriously this album has so many perfect melodies, and This Love is no exception, especially the verse melody. I still do this song at karaoke all these years later. Classic single, classic music video. I never got the double meaning of ‚Äúkeep her coming every night‚Äù when I was a kid, but now I sing it with extra sauce because mmmm yes. Iconic intro too, what a stupid simple but stupid great riff. Oh and that bridge!!!!!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): An iconic song, an iconic video. Easy 10.

**vapourlomo** (10): The second-best Maroon 5 song (after "Makes Me Wonder"). Normally, I hate Adam Levine's pretty-boy sleaze, but it works really well here. Probably because he owns it and just makes a slinky, legitimately funky pop jam.

**anemonone** (9.3): Fun song, and I like the narrative. Helps set the scene. After about the 1000x time, though, it does get a little annoying!

**Marshynarsh** (9): Never realised how dirty this song was while sing it multiple times on singstar party

**Banananaise** (8.5): bonafide children's party hit

**scoutfincher** (8.5): I love how soulful and funky this song sounds. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, sexy, and such a great jam.

**enecks** (8): Nice instrumental

##This song is taking its toll on me

**whatyourheartdesires** (6.5): I'm not a fan of this production

**carvelbabel** (6): Okay controversial opinion time, This Love is one of the weaker songs on this whole album. I try to appreciate it ‚Äì it‚Äôs arguably M5‚Äôs biggest hit, beloved by the general public, received worldwide critical acclaim, won a Grammy‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs never been one of my favorites. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like it. I mean, it‚Äôs okay. Fun, catchy, upbeat. Just never really got what all the fuss is about this song. It was perfect for that one scene in White Chicks though.

**Overall average**: 7.533 // [All averages](https://pastebin.com/a8HErUEG)

---

**Marshynarsh**: I was introduced to this album by a friend that burned it for me, a couple of solid hits however a few of the songs sound to familiar to each other for me.

**CrispyEggs123**: This album was a pleasant surprise, some misses though

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: Decent. The singles are very good and there are some memorable deep cuts. Has aged well. Average: 7.88

**jamesfog**: An all around fun album!

**Nfranklin50**: Idk I feel like this was a great album but for me it was way too hyped up. I was expecting 12 songs of She Will Be loved level bops but I didn't get it. Still a very good album tho

**shineflyer**: Sorry, the old Maroon 5 can't come to the phone right now. But yeah, not to be repetitive, but DAMN was the rest of Maroon 5's career a disappointment in comparison with this album. It strikes me especially hard how much worse Adam's voice has gotten; it's like he forgot he had a lower register once. It still has one thing in common with modern M5 though: too much filler.

**agentofscranton**: I miss Maroon 5 back when it was Maroon 5 and not Adam Levine and the Maroon 4

**Mrachnie**: This album is a weird mix of songs about abusive relationships and saccharine lovesongs, and while i'm not sure it all works together as an album, it has many great individual songs. ##Janeplzcomeback

**Banananaise**: I listened to Maroon 5's albums for the first time in my last year of high school, and I liked them in a neutral 'this is listenable' kind of way. so when I was in an after-school French class, we were all supposed to talk about our favourite things and I said my favourite band was Maroon 5 - but it was French class (and I try so hard at everything) so I said "marron cinq" which I now realise means "brown five". the teacher told me i shouldn't do that and my classmates (all at least a few years younger than me) looked at me with such contempt. I can't listen to Maroon 5 anymore

**anemonone**: One of the best pop rock albums of the decade, obviously. It's hard to put how much I enjoy this album into words. It's not that I have a personal connection to the music, it's just that the songs are so fun and interesting! The album is a perfect balance of rock, jazz, and pop influences, and includes songs like "Harder to Breathe" that go hard, songs like "She Will Be Loved" and "Must Get Out" that are chill-er but still jammable, and just fun throwback style songs like "Sunday Morning". I fucking love Adam's voice- he delivers on every. single. track. I really appreciate good vocals. Every song on this album is about a girl, and I love that. The lyricism and musicality allow us to explore their relationship in depth, and it's incredibly entertaining. No lie, I was dancing through my apartment revisiting this goldmine- how could I resist? (p.s. my original comments for the songs got lost after the page refreshed rip me)

**atlastata**: When this album came out, I listened to it more than I'd like to admit. Some of these tracks actually hold up.

**sletrab07**: 7 Probably their best album, but it contains way too much filler. Half the album feels inessential. Their classics are classics, though.

**carvelbabel**: I progressively got sadder listening through this album with every song that went by. Maroon 5 used to be SO damn good. Songs about Jane is them at their best but the next couple albums were great as well. Their recent stuff is‚Ä¶fun to listen to on the radio but feels incredibly impersonal. Like I get every album needs some radio friendly songs but their recent albums have felt extremely calculated and driven by the principle of what will top the charts and be profitable. I haven‚Äôt liked any of the singles off of Red Pill Blues so far (what a horrific album name. Yikes). I hope M5 comes out with another Songs About Jane type of album at some point. Just a generally beautiful and sonically cohesive album.

**DraculaWeekend**: Where did Maroon 5 go wrong?? Also, I can't believe this album came out in 2002 because it held up SO WELL

**mustangs16**: one of my favorite albums so if i seem biased in my scores...I AM

**Mysario**: I think if this album came out now, it wouldn't do as well as it did 15 years ago - I mean, who even plays guitar solos anymore? Top tier album though!

**callmetidle**: God I can‚Äôt listen to this because it is so much better than their current stuff. If Sugar is one of their biggest recent hits, why does Adam think all the songs have to be terrible?

**scoutfincher**: The singles are really good, though this album pleasantly surprised me by also having some deep cuts I enjoyed a lot. There is some boring filler near the end but it's mostly filled with good jams.

**rickikardashian**: I wasn't really excited with listening to a Maroon 5 album, but this is legit so fucking. Some songs are very similar with each other but they all have something distinctive that makes them unique. I didn't expect to love the album as much as i did

I think this is the first Coldplay song I heard. In 2017, it‚Äôs still as fresh as ever. It has one of the most iconic instrumentals of all time (dat piano riff), and the rest of the song doesn‚Äôt fall short in comparison. Like AROBTTH, Politik, and GPASUYF, this song also battles with existential questions (‚ÄúAm I part of the cure, or am I part of the disease?‚Äù), but manages to also be a up-tempo pop song that you can dance along to at the same time. An easy 10.

By the way, towards the end of these results, this one came *so* close to being #2 in this rate. In the last set of 5 or so submissions, it went back and forth with being #2 and #3. Luckily it took it‚Äôs rightful spot at #3.

üéπ üéπ üéπ

**dropthehammer11** (11): The piano line is completely timeless. This song is perfect.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This song has one of the most iconic piano riffs out there. Easily one of my favourite Coldplay songs (tbh probably songs in general) of all time.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): One of the most memorable instrumental ever, you can't even argue against that. Also his voice in this gives me the cummies :O

**1313Harbor** (10): Just found out that this song was inspired by Muse which makes me love it even more. This piano riff was one of the first things I taught myself to play by ear.

**carvelbabel** (10): One of their very best. I mean seriously that piano? Those lyrics? Everyone should love Clocks and that‚Äôs final.

**JonathanSloanAUS** (10): Find me a more iconic piano riff

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This was like one of my favorite songs as a kid. It was in running contention with Sunday Morning for my 11, and it‚Äôs one of their best songs period. The piano is just flawless, and only Chris could handle a song like this, weaving together some of his best lyrics over a crashing set of drums. It‚Äôs a masterpiece, plain and simple, and a highlight of this album and their career.

**sletrab07** (9.7): The definition of iconic. Everybody knows THAT piano riff.

**scoutfincher** (9.5): The piano riff displayed throughout this song is absolutely wonderful. The entire song feels epic, like something soaring into the sky, or like the world is spinning. It really adds to Chris‚Äôs feelings of confusion and anxiety in the verses. The chorus does sound incomplete but in the song‚Äôs context, that‚Äôs the beauty of it. And that outro is so great.

**themobiler99** (9.5): This guy named Chris Iverson who I went to high school with would always play this song and Don‚Äôt Stop Believing every time he‚Äôd see a piano. Other than that I‚Äôll just say Clocks was never my favorite but it's obviously god tier and a classic. Also this is the first Coldplay song I can remember hearing and knowing who it was. I‚Äôd obviously heard Yellow before but made no connection. And it took Viva la Vida for me to become a fan, so Clocks holds a weird middle ground.

**anemonone** (9): Iconic piano riff, the song is so grand and I love it!

**enecks** (9): That piano riff is unfuckwithable.

**Mrachnie** (9): The piano melody is iconic, and while the intro is a bit too long,it makes the whole song feel just so complete. I feel like if i had to pick one song to represent the album, i would choose this one because it works the most as a stand-alone track.

**vapourlomo** (8): As a Coldplay fan, I'm qualified to say this: "Clocks" is kinda overrated. The piano riff is spectacular and rightfully iconic, but there's no real emotional weight to it or a killer groove, like the best Coldplay songs. Here's a real hot take for y'all: "Speed of Sound" is a bit better.


##Inferior song smdh

**jamesfog** (10): David Guetta and Kelly Rowland did it better. [*editor‚Äôs note*: !BAN]

**mokitsu** (10): when love takes ovaaaaaaaaaaa yeaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh

**rickikardashian** (10): Inb4 WHEN LOVE TAKES OVERRRRR YEEEEAAAAHHH that song is a bop tho


##The rest

**MrSwearword** (10): distinct and rather pleasant, especially for them

**agentofscranton** (10): this is one of those songs where halfway through I‚Äôll start it again because I feel like I didn‚Äôt appreciate a certain aspect enough, it‚Äôs five minutes of pure pop-rock euphoria, it‚Äôs easily one of coldplay‚Äôs best, definitely an 11 contender

**bigtimesurreality** (10): This is an example of Coldplay doing what they do best (IMO) which is anthem rock!

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Ahead of its time

**CrispyEggs123** (9): Iconic but far from being my favorite Coldplay song


**Mysario** (9): The only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time: love, values, and of course, the pyramids - the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it.

**callmetidle** (8): This song is what the entire album is aiming to be

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): chris martin has nice voice but he's fucking horrible at singing

**shineflyer** (6): this song kind of just drones on. when people talk about Coldplay being bland, this is probably what they mean. I assume they were going for atmospheric, but the synths sound a bit too muddy. It's still a nice piano part, though.

Finally we‚Äôre here. My 11. This song is perfection and I‚Äôm glad popheads recognized talent for once! A story of a man who realized too late that he lost his love, this song describes him reaching out to her and apologizing. This song hits people because it can also be applied to the broader context of life. ‚ÄúNobody said it was easy / No one ever said it would be this hard / Oh, take me back to the start‚Äù can be applied to not only a relationship that didn‚Äôt work out, but anytime you felt you were over your head doing something and just a reset button on life. 
 ‚ÄúQuestions of science / Science and progress / Do not speak as loud as my heart‚Äù is one of my favorite lyrics ever‚Ä¶what is more powerful than love, after all?

---

##Good taste squad

**Damoojo** (11): Deserves all the 11's!! Now excuse me while I go curl up in a ball and cry.

**mokitsu** (11): this is one of the best and most recognisable ballads ever...so emotional

**agentofscranton** (10): i‚Äôve never even been in a relationship but this song makes me feel like I‚Äôve royally fucked up and if you‚Äôre out there non-existent boyfriend, my bad

**atlastata** (10): Also doubles as one of the few decent Glee covers. No, I will not turn on location.

**bigtimesurreality** (10): I'm trying not to cry üò¢ The lyrics are simple but they're still affective- they apply to any relationship and that kind of universality is one of the reasons why this song is so well loved.

**DraculaWeekend** (10): Perfect song for staring off into the distance while pretending you're deep and mysterious

**dropthehammer11** (10): A chilly, beautiful ballad. Wonderful track

**enecks** (10): Oh god this song always finds me at my lows. Suicide attempts, rejections, people not accepting my identity, breakdowns. I don't know if things will get better for me. I want to hope that things improve. But then again I get hit, and somewhere in my cycle of painful lows, I find this song. This haunting, melancholy song about a failed relationship and regret always finds me. In a way I welcome it - it's a friend when I lack one in real life. I never listen to it in good times because I want it to still have that impact for me in bad times. The bad times in my life are becoming more common. And at the end of this rant/therapy session I have to say that this is an incredible song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is definitely one of Coldplay‚Äôs best songs, if not the best. The lyrics, the emotion, and the build up throughout the song is amazing. It also has a very timeless feeling, and it‚Äôs a song I‚Äôve been listening to for years now, and I still love it just as much.

**jamesfog** (10): Glee did it better. [*editor‚Äôs note*: !BAN]

**Marshynarsh** (10): TAKE ME BACK TO THE START. One of the all time greats for songs to cry to. On top of that it came with an iconic music video that just made everything even more somber

**Nfranklin50** (10): This is peak music tbh

**rickikardashian** (10): the number of times I cried to this song in like 8th grade is just ridiculous

**scoutfincher** (10): This is an absolutely beautiful piano ballad. It never fails to evoke strong emotions from me every time I hear it. It‚Äôs such a heartbreaking analysis of an ended relationship and the symbolism of using the logical nature science to try to understand something so emotional as a breakup really works for me.

**themobiler99** (10): One of their best ever, GOAT music video, GOAT emo, GOAT song to play on the band room piano when you're in 9th grade. Chris has never been one of my top favorite lyricists, but here man he channeled some supernatural perfection.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): It's just so beautiful <3

**vapourlomo** (10): sobs for 20 straight minutes NO I'M NOT OKAY

**sletrab07** (9.2): Martin‚Äôs howl of a vocal line at the end is wrenching. Simply classic, what else needs to be said?

**carvelbabel** (9): Overplayed, but an absolutely beautiful song to its core.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Probably the biggest song from this album besides Clocks. It‚Äôs a classic, but it doesn‚Äôt quite shake me like the latter does. It‚Äôs the best of the bumbling buildups on the album, but it still doesn‚Äôt feel very unique. That said, it‚Äôs a classic Coldplay track, and in terms of the style they have in this era, they don‚Äôt do it better on any track.

**LuckyKidA** (8.2): http://78.media.tumblr.com/51880d02f89a3661d05cb4858c774cd1/tumblr_o9f8yauIV21s9l8tco1_500.gif

**Mrachnie** (8): Everybody knows this song. It's very emotional in both the lyrics and Chris's delivery.

**shineflyer** (8): I forget how good this song actually is a lot of the time. the instruments are balanced really well so that nothing is overpowering.

##Bad Taste Squad

**anemonone** (6): There's just nothing interesting about this song at all. It's repetitive and boring, and doesn't build to anything worth the wait...

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): idk i know this is a popular song but i've never heard this before and it's annoying

**MrSwearword** (0): not only is this a bad song, it‚Äôs a bad song that on singing shows, gets used and abused more than white privilege in the U.S.

**Overall average**: 7.461  // [Everyone‚Äôs averages](https://pastebin.com/EUge2dzf)

---

**Marshynarsh**: Somehow have never listened to this album in full before now, I started liking coldplay with their album X & Y although a couple of songs on this one were my all time favourite Coldplay songs

**CrispyEggs123**: The best & most consistent album among the three

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: The best album in here by far imo. Chris Martin just has a better voice than Brandon and Adam, and some of the instrumental are among my favorites ever. Lyrically superior as well. Average: 8.73

**Damoojo**: A great album!

**jamesfog**: Kind of a chore to get through TBH.

**Nfranklin50**: Honestly IDK what I've been doing my whole life. I've never heard a Coldplay song I didn't like but I've never listened to a whole album of theirs. I'm legit blown away by this

**letsallpoo**: **why are these songs all so long. like calm down there lana del rey** 

**shineflyer**: It's unfortunate that I finally get to talk about how I like Coldplay and not be ridiculed for it... but it has to be AROBTTH, which is probably my least favorite of their albums. Still, Coldplay should get more love.

**Mrachnie**: This is probably my favourite album in the rate. It feels much more mature than the other ones, both sonically and lyrically.

**anemonone**: This album bores me. I don't really have much to say; none of the tracks can really keep my attention for very long. It's not that I don't like slow/sad songs, it's just that these are basic, and there's nothing endearing about Chris' voice or the strumming of the guitar or anything to really give these songs any character. It's all just... meh.

**atlastata**: I've literally never listened to a Coldplay album all the way through before. Cross that off my bucket list. Not a bad album, either.

**sletrab07**: 9/10. One of the most cohesive albums ever written. The theme of ‚Äòurgency‚Äô permeates every single song, whether in lyrics or instrumentation. This was a band who was stepping out of the (inaccurate) Radiohead comparisons and planting a flag on top of Britpop Mountain.

**carvelbabel**: I have a whole new appreciation for this album. I hadn‚Äôt listened to it all the way through since‚Ä¶2007 maybe? I always loved the actual music itself, but I feel like I ‚Äòget‚Äô the content of this album a lot better now than I did as a pre-teen. Honestly, I know that it‚Äôs easy to poke fun at this album and Coldplay in general for being boring or fake-deep or whatever people like to say about them but in my opinion, this is an incomparably beautiful, truly sincere, trailblazing album that defined the early 2000s. My overall favorite of all three in this rate actually. There is true soul and feeling in every song, although pop bops they are admittedly not.

**DraculaWeekend**: **I heard these guys inspired Radiohead**

**mustangs16**: this was the first time I‚Äôve listened to this album (well, first two times, I listened twice before rating) and I was pleasantly surprised by it. Definitely lags towards the end, though, which a lot of albums tend to do.

**Mysario**: While the first half is iconic, the second half teeters off into boring territory, but it's well worth it when the trip ends at Amsterdam!

**callmetidle**: The weakest album here imo; the only one I would argue doesn't deserve the title of "classic". Coldplay is kinda boring, but sometimes, they make it a strength. Here though, it just feels like a lack of identity, like they hadn‚Äôt really figured out what makes them special. I think it‚Äôs way too gray(or grey) when Coldplay at their best is a very pleasing, if not kind of faded, pallet of colors.

**scoutfincher**: There are some dull tracks in here, but not as many as I was thinking there'd be. A lot of songs here are really beautiful and deal with some interesting themes.

**rickikardashian**: Coldplay have a few of my favorite songs and they're amazing making hits, but they also make music so boring sometimes it makes me want to sleep. This is the case, besides a few songs, the entire album I just really boring and samey sounding. There's nothing exciting or fun, and literally every song sound alike the ending of a cheesy movie

Ah, the ubiquitous Mr. Brightside. What can I say about you that hasn‚Äôt already been said? This song deserves #1 and all the other awards, honestly. It‚Äôs perfect from the opening notes to the very end ‚ÄúI neverrrrrr.‚Äù It elicits emotion in everyone who hears it but it is also anyone - of any age - can jam along to it at the same time. The verses are repeated, but it manages not to take anything away from the song ‚Äî if anything it makes it all the more stronger. A timeless classic. 

---

##GOAT

**agentofscranton** (11): i can only speak from my experience so i may be inaccurate, but being a university student here in the uk, and just generally having lived here my whole life, Mr. Brightside will always be that song. It‚Äôs the song you always here on a drive with your family, it‚Äôs the song you bop around to in your room with nobody watching, it‚Äôs the song that everyone‚Äôs got on their pre-drinks playlist, it‚Äôs the one song that gets everyone going in the club, it‚Äôs the song at least one group of drunk students are chanting on their way home. Everyone here knows the words, and when that guitar intro comes on you can bet your ass at least half the room will lose their shit, it‚Äôs synonymous with growing up in the UK, it‚Äôs forced its way into the soundtrack of our lives and I‚Äôm glad it did

**anemonone** (11): No explanation needed, greatest song of all time

**atlastata** (11): I'm a white dude who was born in the late 80's. Sue me. This song is still phenomenal.

**berober04** (11): Let's be honest, was I going to give this anything other than an 11 considering how much I hype this up in the UK chart threads? It's perfect, timeless, and even if you don't know what the song is called, you know it. Everyone knows this. Even if 18 year old me, going to clubs for the first time ever, thought Brandon was saying "eagle eyes". This is my favourite song of all time, and I hope it gets the love it deserve in this rate.

**DraculaWeekend** (11): If this song doesn't win the rate then I'm done

**jamesfog** (11): Iconic... a UK smash hit

**JonathanSloanAUS** (11): Perfection.

**milkywayinradius** (11): **This as my go-to karaoke song plus my best Lorde dance impression and copious amounts of alcohol is the best time**

**poppinmmolly** (11): honestly this is the pinnacle of music. This is a genuinely good song. That opening riff awakens something in me and it makes me feel some kind of way. It's amazing.

**shineflyer** (11): I didn't want to be a normie and give this my 11, but let's be real. It's the definition of anthemic. The lyrics are gold, and the synths make me feel like I'm flying. You'd think it would have gotten old on me by now but, nah. It's been doin' just fine.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): Killer This Song Sounds Like: The Zodiac Killer (In all honesty, this is one of the greatest songs of all time, literally a record that has soundtracked an entire generation, a group of people that know every single lyric, dance to this song every time it comes on, and get their kids in on it so they can relate to it to. It‚Äôs one of the most important indie pop songs of all time, and as much as I love the band, they‚Äôve never been able to recreate the magic that they had with this track. It‚Äôs one of the most visceral songs I‚Äôve ever heard, and it feels so poetically written and natural that it feels less like a song and more like a dance. The easiest 11 I‚Äôve ever given.)

**vapourlomo** (11): Forget the memes for a second and just remember how perfect this song is. There's a goddamn reason this song has stuck in the cultural consciousness for so long: It's a BANGER. Mr. Brightside is highly relatable, filled with histrionics, and features an anthemic, super-sticky chorus. In terms of '00s indie rock, I'm not sure there's a lot better.

**whatyourheartdesires** (11): she's touching his... CHEST NOW is a part that I always shout even louder. Perfect song and the girl in the music video is Iza Miko's biggest role ever

**1313Harbor** (10): King of procrastination Brandon Flowers: ‚ÄúI remember being in the studio, recording the demo but still writing the lyrics. I was procrastinating, and that's why the second verse is the same as the first one, but it just stuck.‚Äù

**carvelbabel** (10): The easiest 10 in this rate. Even all the mainstream popularity and nostalgia aside, this is straight up just a timeless perfectly formulated anthemic bop.

**dropthehammer11** (10): If this has anything less than a 10 average I'll be truly shocked [*Editor‚Äôs note*: be shocked bitch]

**enecks** (10): This is incessantly iconic. It is one of the best songs ever.... but The Killers have 1 better song.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): An iconic song. I love how upbeat it sounds even though it‚Äôs not a happy song. Truly deserves to chart for like over 10 years

**Marshynarsh** (10): From start to finish this song this song is so good to sing along to, and I am yet to find a person who doesn't get hyped up when it comes on at a party

**MihaMijat** (10): My inner emo always jumps around and shouts this song every time it's on, it's just one of those classics that everybody knows and likes.

**MrSwearword** (10): guyliner rock that has aged really well

**mustangs16** (10): iconicccccc

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): I know the word is thrown around a lot but this song is literally iconic

**scoutfincher** (10): This song is absolutely iconic from the moment the opening riff starts. It‚Äôs got such a bombastic, anthemic sound to it. Brandon‚Äôs emotional delivery during the chorus is so good. It‚Äôs such an enjoyable song to listen to.

**themobiler99** (10): Greatest indie singalong track ever? I think so, especially for my age group (22-26). Just a classic in every sense, amazing lyrics breaking down insecurity, jealousy and paranoia and what a damn melody. Also can we talk about the fingerpicking electric guitar beautifulness in the intro and throughout?

**bigtimesurreality** (9.5): Summed up in one word: Anthemic. Most of us have heard this song about a million times but it still holds up.

**Mrachnie** (9): This song is absolutely iconic. Hate it or love it, everyone knows this song. It will also probably win this rate which i'm at peace with.

**sletrab07** (8.6): Disregarding the meme, this is a strong song. The melody is 75% the same note and the rhythm is monotonously repetitive. The story in the lyrics helps the song succeed despite the uncreative melodic writing.

---

##Not feeling the hype


**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): It's a good song, for sure. I'm not quite sure why it's so successful though, since it's not super memorable or super catchy. Don't get me wrong, it's a good song. But I don't see the "it" factor.

**rickikardashian** (7): ...the song isn't bad but is this really what has stayed a decade on the UK charts?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i'm being 100% honest when i say i have NEVER in my life heard this song until right now, monday, october 2, 2017 at 6:55pm. and this song is nothing special. i mean the prechorus is annoying but somehow the most memorable part of the song. but i mean hey. at least this is probably less bland than the 10 other songs here.

---

##Grab your pitchforks


**mokitsu** (0): first of all...NO this is not sabotage. I don't have any emotional connection to any of these artists/albums/songs. However I do think this song is heavily circlejerked upon. It is way too repetitive, the guitar riffs sound dated and the whole song brings me back memories of my high school bullies, and bad high school memories in general. I do think The Killers have good songs, but this one is not it.

deleted: # Hot Fuss

---

**Overall average**: 7.547  // [Everyone‚Äôs averages](https://pastebin.com/izhn33Rh)

---

**Marshynarsh**: So many memories from this album, it was the first one I would listen from start to finish on over and over again. It includes a few of The Killers All time greatest songs and I don't thing any of their other albums have been as generally like to the general public

**CrispyEggs123**: Some of my all time faves here but this album is a bit top-heavy

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: It's alright, but not something I'm likely to go back to. Probably the most underwhelming album in the rate. Average: 7.18

**jamesfog**: This album has absolute classics, but some of the songs sound muddled.

**Nfranklin50**: I didn't know what to expect going into this but man this was way above my expectations. It's a bit front loaded and the more upbeat songs are way better but I'm a fan

**shineflyer**: I'm afraid of having bias on this one, since it's one of my favorite albums ever. But, there's a reason for that - it's really, really good. Like, I don't know that either of the other albums stand a chance in comparison for me. I'll do my best to be fair, but giving this album higher scores overall might be the honest thing to do for me.

**Mrachnie**: This is a great album, and while it took a dip in quality in the second half, i still think that this is peak early 200's pop-rock.

**berober04**: When I was 11, I used to race scalextric cars weekly. The guy who ran the club would occasionally play music over the speakers, and because Hot Fuss was only recently out, we'd hear it quite often. One time, we were doing a 24 hour race, and I remember loading my iPod touch up with Hot Fuss and racing at 3am, singing the "I got soul" refrain from ATTTID over and over again. The last time I went back was for a charity event, local businesses sponsoring teams and such. I was brought in as a ringer for a team, and since I was the equivalent of a ringer, I won of course. That was the last time I saw my grandad before he passed, and he got to see me at the top. There was no Hot Fuss playing that day, but it was in my head each time I got up to race. This album means so much to me, I hope you see it in the regard that I do.

**Banananaise**: this is my first time listening to this album despite being very familiar with the most successful singles (and the album art for some reason). I feel kind of disappointed - most of the tracks outside of Mr. Brightside and Somebody Told Me feel like filler - the only other songs I really liked were On Top and Believe Me Natalie.

**anemonone**: The Killers literally invented glamorous indie rock and roll. This is one of my favorite albums of all time. I've never heard another album that even comes close to capturing that Vegas nighttime vibe like Hot Fuss does. From front to finish, there's absolutely nothing I'd change about this album. No filler, whatsoever. Honestly, the Killers were iconic from the get-go, and if I could give this album straight tens I probably would lol.

**atlastata**: I'd put the first six tracks of this album against the first six tracks of any other album.

**sletrab07**: 7.8 An almost iconic album that is let down by its second half. Still, their best songs are on this album.

**carvelbabel**: I‚Äôd forgotten how collectively incredible the first half of Hot Fuss was until I was listening through it again all these years later. The album as a whole is good, but there is something really, really special about those first five songs.

**DraculaWeekend**: This album is not as good as Sam's Town, but it held up better than I thought it would

**mustangs16**: as good as this album is, it‚Äôs still only like...the third best killers album tbh

**Mysario**: Every straight white male you talk to will have this in their top ten albums, but for a good reason!

**callmetidle**: It‚Äôs inconsistent for sure, but the peaks here are so strong and so plentiful that this is still their best album. Some of their other albums are more consistent but have less moments that I just have to come back to.

**scoutfincher**: This album is wonderful (wonderful), even though the second half isn't wholly as strong as the first. I love the new wave-inspired sound of it. It's always been one of my favorite albums.
