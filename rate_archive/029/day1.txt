[RATE REVEAL] Early 2000s Rock Reveal, Day 1: Songs About Flops
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7do24z/rate_reveal_early_2000s_rock_reveal_day_1_songs/

[Hey guys](https://gph.is/2dqn5YO)! Welcome to Day 1 of the 2000‚Äôs Pop Rock Rate Reveal! I‚Äôm [strawberryswing1](https://media.giphy.com/media/mpn2ZFnaYA8y4/giphy.gif) and I‚Äôll be your host for this evening. 

Does this sub hate Coldplay and Maroon 5 as much as they say? Do the singles from these albums hold up well, over ten years later? Let‚Äôs get into it and find out!

Some notes:

* The countdown will begin at about 5 PM EST.  
* 58 people participated in this rate!    
* 7 people chose not to give 11s  
* Only 8 people gave 0s  
* **I‚Äôll be revealing songs #34 to #24 today**  
* The average score was **7.5134**.  
* The average controversy score was **1.6854**. So anything above that should be considered controversial. Not very controversial in all, though! \#GoodTasteRate  
* Follow along live in [our plug.dj room](https://plug.dj/popheads/) if you can!  
* Enter in my game in the comment section below to win a prize!  
* Remember that this is all for fun! It's okay to be messy, but be nice to each other.  

I will be revealing tomorrow‚Äôs scores around 3:30 PM EST (this isn‚Äôt a set time because I might not be able to leave work quickly enough but I‚Äôll try my best) and on Sunday I will reveal the scores starting at 2 PM EST.

TheKneesOfOurBees: I am like the 1% that is Team Parachutes, but this is def their 2nd best album, not to mention it is their most consistent (even if it only edges P slightly)

tbh this is the main reason i didnt participate, my average for Rush would have been v high and for SaJ it would have been very low and i dont think coming into a rate with that state of mind is a good idea

ignitethephoenix: SaJ I think is peak Maroon 5. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did but I think that‚Äôs maybe because their new music is so low effort and poor lyrically. Still I‚Äôm definitely rooting for Coldplay this rate and I hope people like it as much as I do.

Probably my least favorite Coldplay song of all time, I‚Äôm not even upset that this is the lowest ranked song in the whole rate. The mixing is bad. It sounds like it wants to be metal but it isn‚Äôt ‚Äî the whole song sounds so *rough*. 

---


SCREAMING

**mirandacrocsgrove** (5): is this about Selena‚Äôs vocals

---

##Whisper some more into my ear

**Mrachnie** (8): This song is surprisingly unconventional (for a Coldplay song). I love the instrumental and the slightly manic tone of the whole song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Another shorter late album track with some nice vibes and lyrics. It‚Äôs a little too close to some of the other sounds on the album but it‚Äôs solid.

**enecks** (7): This sounds kinda different to the rest of the album in a good way


**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): idk i guess i liked it even though it sounds dated. could've ended 20 seconds sooner

**vapourlomo** (7): Kind of a mess, but kind of a banger?

---

##Even a whisper is too loud for this trash

**sletrab07** (7.8): The only filler track on the album.

**bigtimesurreality** (7): I don't like how the drums overpower the vocals- I know that's probably the intended effect, but I don't it find a pleasant one. I love the xylophone (?) outro, so that makes up for it.

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): This song goes nowhere, but I actually kind of like it? I also may have thought that I was listening to Radiohead again

**CrispyEggs123** (5.5): The only song I would skip on the album...

**scoutfincher** (5): I wasn‚Äôt totally feeling this one. There‚Äôs not much to it besides the hook and bridge, and honestly, it‚Äôs not super interesting.

**carvelbabel** (4): Not a huge fan of this one ‚Äì my least favorite on the album ‚Äì but I do enjoy the instrumental ending after the singing is over (lmao I swear I‚Äôm not being shady) so I‚Äôll throw a few points its way.

**mokitsu** (3.5): uh i'm NOT feeling this..

**MrSwearword** (3): just goes nowhere for me

**themobiler99** (3): One of the songs I always skipped when I was 15. Still elicits no feelings whatsoever.

**shineflyer** (2): I'm not sure if that was a song or a door bell.

**hdhdhdhdh** (0): this song always sounds like my cd is skipping and i'm not sorry about this rating

The closing song for the album, the Killers went for a slower song with optimistic lyrics but a depressing melody. Him repeating *everything will be alright* can be too much if you‚Äôre paying close attention to the song, but I find this song is a great song to listen to in the background after some of the more lively songs on the record. I especially love the way he sings *Then you took me by surprise / Dreaming bout those dreamy eyes*. Popheads found it too boring though, and rated it second to last of all the songs on the album.  

---

##An alright song

**anemonone** (10): So atmospheric. This song means so much to me, more than I can put in words. It's helped me with my anxiety a lot. Special place in my heart, forever and always.

**piccprincess** (10): I needed this

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): Best song in the album.

**bigtimesurreality** (8.5): A nice ending, given the lyrics. I think the Killers do the lo-fi sound nicely and I like the spacey electronic feel of this track.

**shineflyer** (7.7): spacey as fuck. i'm always down with songs that feel this peaceful and otherworldly. it's a nice anti-anxiety track
**mokitsu** (7): okay this is a pretty good song...very experimental, i dig it!

**vapourlomo** (7): It sounds seasick, but this might be a good thing in this case? This might be one of the most experimental songs the Killers have ever tried, and they at least stick the landing partially.

---

##Everything is not alright

**CrispyEggs123** (7.5): I like the idea of this song but I'm not quite in love with the song itself...

**jamesfog** (7): Drags on too long

**MrSwearword** (7): they try to end on a semi-ambient note but this album peaked WAY too early

**Mysario** (7): imagine making this song and deciding this would be a good closer to a nearly flawless album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Killer This Song Sounds Like: John Wayne Gacy

**sletrab07** (6.8): The closing track is predictably downtempo and somewhat half-cooked. The song is hampered by listless vocals and a random combination of tambourine and sleigh bells.

**themobiler99** (6.5): Great tune, but I wish there was more song to fill out the almost 6 minute run time. Pretty slow and lacking in meat. Doesn‚Äôt detract from my enjoyment of the song, but it does detract from its score.

**berober04** (5): as an ending to the album, I get it. It just falls a bit flat compared to the energy of the rest of the album.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): Weak closer on an otherwise pretty decent album

**Mrachnie** (5): This is surprisingly chill for a Killers song. It's also not very good.

**scoutfincher** (5): This just sounds dull and not the best album closer in my opinion. I wish Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll had been on the US version of Hot Fuss because that would‚Äôve been a fantastic way to end it. Maybe if the vocal delivery and production were better then I‚Äôd enjoy this more.

**carvelbabel** (3): I‚Äôve never been a fan of this one. It might be the only song in this rate I actively dislike. The incessantly repetitive background instrumentals (particularly the cymbals) really irk me for whatever reason and lyrics are fairly uninspired but 3 points for ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dreaming ‚Äòbout those dreamy eyes‚Äù cause that‚Äôs cute.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): wow this could not have taken any longer my stomach is cramping i'm just glad it's over

Easily the worst song off of Hot Fuss imo, I‚Äôm surprised this isn‚Äôt the lowest ranked from the album (though it was for a while). This song has a very indy rock sound to it, which a prominent guitar repeating the same notes loudly in the background. The song is sarcastic in nature ‚Äî he doesn‚Äôt actually like Andy. Or‚Ä¶does he? ‚ÄúIn a car with a girl, promise me she‚Äôs not your world‚Äù can be interpreted that he‚Äôs mad at Andy because he wants to be with Andy, and he‚Äôs jealous of the girl. Either way, this is the definition of an album track, and it fails to really build up to anything interesting. 

---

##Star shining bright

**themobiler99** (10): Wonderful wonderful vocals and concept. I love the gay and/or gender swapped aspect of it, because it plays so naturally with the subject matter and at the end of the day it doesn‚Äôt even matter who the narrator is, it matters who Andy is. I just love the subversion of it all, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a star‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.but I‚Äôm the only one who thinks so because objectively you‚Äôre prolly a dick.‚Äù Did I mention the vocals are legendary. Every time Brandon goes up the octave on the hook a new baby is conceived somewhere on the planet.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): idk who this andy guy is but the riff sounds boss and it hits that nice part at the end like a muse song

**Mrachnie** (8.5): Probably my fav use of guitars on this album. They lyrics are either very sarcastic or very gay and i'm okay with both of those options.

**anemonone** (8): The chorus is great, I really like the guitar

**carvelbabel** (8): I remember thinking as a kid that this song was boring and filler and frankly, it kinda is at first listen but after further inspection it is revealed to be a masterclass in sarcasm and trolling of mean jocks who peak in high school. Varsity football captains everywhere are quaking.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): The guitar is this song is pretty cool.

**mokitsu** (7.5): seems pretty anthemic!

**scoutfincher** (7.5): I love how sarcastic this song is, especially when you know the backstory that Andy was a jock who used to bully Brandon in high school. The verses are fine but I really love the chorus, especially the backing female vocals.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): I feel like I need some sort of backstory for this one, but it's pretty touching and memorable as it is.

**shineflyer** (7): this song used to feel too slow for me. but then it became my favorite song for being exhausted, so idk. It's a jam.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Killer This Song Sounds Like: Andrew Cunanan

**rickikardashian** (6.5): the last part won this song an extra .5

**bigtimesurreality** (6): First half is memorable, the guitar part is reminiscent of a White Stripes song, which I like. The last minute or so, not so much.

**vapourlomo** (6): Points added for getting really weird. Points deducted for the song kind of being all over the place.

**DraculaWeekend** (5): I don't know what this song is but it somehow has more energy than all of A Rush of Blood to the Head [*editor‚Äôs note*: üò°üò°]

In this song Brandon pleads with Natalie to have a fun night out, and by extension live her life: have fun at the disco, and in extension follow her dreams. Another filler track, it fits the sound of the album well, but also isn‚Äôt as memorable or noteworthy as the songs on the first half of the album.

##They believe him

**anemonone** (9.2): I absolutely adore the choppy vocals in this song, the drummers are Killer

**Banananaise** (8): add a lil trumpet for that classic big band flair and I will give any song at least an 8 tbh

**mokitsu** (8): seems like a panic! at the disco song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Killer This Song Sounds Like: Paul Knowles

**enecks** (7): This reminds me of the No Man's Sky OST

**scoutfincher** (7): Another song that tells an interesting story. Reading that this song is about a go-go dancer who died of AIDS in the last days of disco gives the lyrics a tinge of sadness for me.

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): HORNS

**shineflyer** (5): not a bad track, but not one I've found myself going back to over and over like some others on the album. nice brass toward the end, though.

---

##They don‚Äôt believe him

**sletrab07** (6.8): I disagree with the choice of kit for this song; it clashes with the space-rock feel that the song is going for. The odd addition of a brass ensemble feels a little out-of-place.

**themobiler99** (6): I appreciate the long intro here, its a nice mood setter. I love the vocals on this album, and they make up for some arguably duff lyrics on occasion, but this song has easily the stupidest lyrics of the bunch. I have no idea what the song is actually saying, and I know the lyrics and can sing along the whole time. That‚Äôs saying something. I dig the horns at the end tho.

**Mrachnie** (5.5): This is weird. The bridge is the only good part of it. Also trumpets are very out of place.

**bigtimesurreality** (5): A lackluster attempt at indie, sorry :(

**carvelbabel** (5): An objectively lovely song about taking control of your own path and living life to the fullest but...it bores me every time I listen to it.

**vapourlomo** (5): It tries to sound a lot more epic than it actually is. Here's what it actually is: more Hot Fuss second-half filler.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4.5): idk i guess the trumpets are ok but like.... mediocre

**MrSwearword** (3): couldn‚Äôt keep my attention; turgid and lackadaisical

Another one of Coldplay‚Äôs longer tracks. Chris sings in a slightly higher register here, which some find annoying, but I find an interesting change. They add in some orchestra instruments to make this song stand out a little from their other songs. Overall, the song can be considered filler but is alright nonetheless. 

---

##Sun is shining bright

**sletrab07** (8.8): The use of Indian instruments at the opening signals Coldplay‚Äôs foray into world music. The octave-doubled vocals in the verse are so roomy.

**bigtimesurreality** (7.5): Kind of just an average Coldplay song, not too memorable. I like the guitar + orchestra combo in the chorus.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): pretty, a little boring though.

**Mrachnie** (7): This is a very high score considering i LOATHE love songs which aren't dark or sad. The only thing i don't like about it is how both the intro and the outro are wayyy too long.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Another moody 5 minute track that is good but boring enough that I can‚Äôt be assed to give this more than a 7.

##I‚Äôm more of a night person

**mokitsu** (7): forgettable!

**enecks** (7): This song is like daylight itself - I appreciate it but I avoid it and rarely seek it out.

**jamesfog** (8): Another long song...

**scoutfincher** (6.5): I love the guitar riff in this song, but the rest of the song is a tad boring for my taste. Not a big fan of Chris‚Äôs vocals on here.

**MrSwearword** (6): slightly above average but not by much

**rickikardashian** (6): I really can't stand his vocals

**vapourlomo** (6): Coldplay has mostly moved away from these atmospheric songs, and honestly I'm okay with that. It wasn't their strength. This one's okay anyways.

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Honestly thought this was a Radiohead song

**mirandacrocsgrove** (5): 2011 Maroon 5 is shaking

**callmetidle** (4): oh my god this song just keeps going

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): i fell asleep on my first listen for real actual sleep

**anemonone** (3): It's so offputting, not enjoyable at all, dislike the way the song burst into loudness in places

**shineflyer** (3): this song played for two minutes before i realized it. but I like the bass vocals in the song, you don't get to hear enough low male vocals around.

**themobiler99** (3): This is daaaaaaaaaAaaaaaaaayliiiighttttt, it‚Äôs repeeeeeEeeeeeteeeeeeeeeetiivvvvvveee

This song starts out by being a typical white boy with a guitar love song, but it grows into something more as the song goes on. The chorus kicks up halfway through the song and adds a bit of a kick to it. 

---

*Editor‚Äôs note: this isn‚Äôt about Gwen*

**agentofscranton** (8): this is cute and all, but doesn‚Äôt Gwyneth Paltrow have blue eyes?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I can‚Äôt listen to this song without thinking about how he‚Äôs not even with Gwyneth Paltrow anymore so it‚Äôs awkward. It‚Äôs cute otherwise.

---

##The spotlight shines upon you

**themobiler99** (10): Sublime, goosebump inducing, absolutely wonderful in every way. ‚ÄúI came here with a load, and it feels so much lighter since I met you girl‚Äù is one of the most perfect romantic lines in the history of songs. In an older era this would have absolutely become a standard that Frank Sinatra and shit would cover.

**vapourlomo** (10): This song is absolutely gorgeous and perfect. I normally LOATHE acoustic guitar ballads, but Chris Martin sounds so genuine here (compare that with Adam Levine, who always sounds like he just wants to sleep with you...Brandon Flowers just sounds like a deranged madman). It's painfully romantic. Total wedding first-dance material.

**sletrab07** (8.7): I love that Martin wrote this song about his guitarist. It‚Äôs the most British-sounding song on the album.

**mokitsu** (8): really cute..

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Sounds like a Father John Misty song, I wonder what he would have to say about that.

**carvelbabel** (7): Sweet, fluffy, cute, but nothing special tbh. But it‚Äôs a perfect fit for its middle of the pack place of the album. After so many heavy songs in a row, it was nice hearing something upbeat and happy.

**CrispyEggs123** (7): kinda cheesy

**MrSwearword** (7): nice guitar but the vocals bore me to death

**scoutfincher** (7): My least favorite of the singles on this album, but it‚Äôs still a sweet little love song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Little more acoustic here. It picks up towards the end, which is great, but it takes a bit of time to get there.

**Mrachnie** (6.5): Another love song yay! It's pretty nice, though it isn't much of an event.

**rickikardashian** (6): I guess this is cute

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): the guitar chords are a little annoying but the song makes me feel warm and it gets better as it goes

**anemonone** (5): Boring as hell, but I like the lyrics, they're cute

---

##They deny you‚Ä¶

**bigtimesurreality** (5): This is the token "one acoustic song on the record" track. It's kinda forgettable.

**enecks** (4): Honey you are a rock? How stoned were you when you wrote these lyrics

**shineflyer** (4): we r/countryheads now. JK, this sounds like a scrapped track from Parachutes.

**jamesfog** (0): The quintessential White Guy With Guitar song... it's nothing special.

A slow, sexy song. One of the better album tracks in my opinion because it doesn‚Äôt have the problem of the instruments overtaking the song. This song sets a mood really well ‚Äî it‚Äôs dark and sultry. However, it runs into the problem of having too long of an outro.  

---

##Taking this one to the grave

**mustangs16** (10): some people i know have been surprised that maroon 5 tend to record songs so blatantly about sex these days and when they do i‚Äôm always just like.....uhhh have you heard Secret lmao

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): very very nice. The lyrics are pretty good, but the best part of the song is the first minute or so.

**1313Harbor** (9): So nice and mellow - I think it fills out the album really well.

**anemonone** (9): Sexy instrumental, the song vibes

**CrispyEggs123** (9): Maroon 5 doing sexy well whaaaaaa???

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): this made me emotional idk why

**mokitsu** (8): one of the best songs so far

**Mrachnie** (8): This is one of the slower songs on the album, and while it suffers from the same problem as the other do (Adam's voice just isn't interesting enough to prevent it from being boring) it has a great melody and doesen't try hard to be sweet.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A little slow on the buildup on this one, but when it picks up, it really does. The longest track on the album, but it‚Äôs worth the wait.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This just made me think of pretty little liars lol

**carvelbabel** (7): PLL theme song WHO?? I could do without the almost 50 seconds of pointless eerie music before the actual song begins but once it does‚Ä¶damn. Lyrically simple, but it‚Äôs amazing how much depth and life Adam‚Äôs voice brings to this song. Where did this Adam Levine go?? Bring him back!

**enecks** (7): This is pulled off better than I would've thought

---

##Can‚Äôt be trusted

**themobiler99** (7): Completely unnecessary minute and a half long intro. Good R&B/Alt-rock hybrid slow bop though. It‚Äôs not a great song but I can‚Äôt help but like it because the vibe is brings something totally different but still appropriate to the album.

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): The intro is so unnecessarily dramatic. Still good tho

**sletrab07** (6.5): This song should have really been cut down, the intro was 2x longer than a Coldplay intro.

**scoutfincher** (5.5): The instrumentation is very chill and almost hypnotic, but the song itself is kinda boring. Definitely filler material.

**shineflyer** (5): filler track. but a decent filler track.

**vapourlomo** (5): It looks like these guys are shooting for 'mysterious and sexy' and land in 'boring.'

**MrSwearword** (2): Levine, the Casanova; it‚Äôs a character, but one that should‚Äôve been axed immediately upon inception.

I adore this song and I‚Äôm honestly surprised it did so poorly in this rate. This is the best song on the second half of Hot Fuss. The production is interesting and fun, and I love how it manages to balance the synths with the actual live instruments. I suppose the chorus isn‚Äôt the most catchy out there or anything, but the other verses make up for it. The buildup to the last 30 seconds is phenomenal, and then it slowly ends with ‚Äú‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm fine, oh.‚Äù

##Tops IRL
**themobiler99** (8.7): Underrated and underplayed, I fucking love the synth here. Very different type of vocal melody and rhyme pattern in the verse here than on the songs that have come from before. I also love the groove during the hook. Oh and if that‚Äôs not enough, there comes the bridge/outro/b section/whatever and it is so different and awesome!

**scoutfincher** (8): This is such a fun track that always puts me in a good mood.

**shineflyer** (8): i am shimmmied and shook

**anemonone** (7.8): Catchy as hell, love the lead-in to the chorus, and the bridge

**bigtimesurreality** (7.5): This song sounds robotic or digital to me. I think it's really fun and the chorus is particularly well done.

**Mrachnie** (7): The sythesizers on this are a bit weird but i still like it.

**CrispyEggs123** (6.5): I like the chorus I guess

##True Popheads Bottoms

**carvelbabel** (6): This song is just kind of‚Ä¶there on the album. Far from their best work in my opinion but I suppose it‚Äôs cute and upbeat and I wouldn‚Äôt turn it off if it came up during a random playlist or on the radio.

**mokitsu** (6): filluh

**rickikardashian** (6): the beginning made Me think it was a Britney song

**vapourlomo** (6): Most of Hot Fuss has aged really well, but that opening synth SCREAMS mid-00s. Beyond that, this is a solid, if unremarkable album cut.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): The lyrics sound like they're straight out of a 2010s EDM song. The instrumental is interesting, but a step down from previous songs. Song goes on for too long without presenting any new ideas. Overall, the bad outweighs the good.

**enecks** (4): Can't relate to being on top smh

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): this song is annoying but the key change was cool

**MrSwearword** (1): like the average Top Model winner, no you‚Äôre not

A slow, pop-rock song with soft guitar plucking in the background, Must Get Out is a song that just doesn‚Äôt manage to go anywhere. 

---

##Want to get out

**MihaMijat** (10): Didn't deserve to flop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Sleeper single right here. It‚Äôs a beautiful, heavenly track, and I just love how Adam gives us that chorus. The beat here is really great too, and there‚Äôs not much more to say.

**anemonone** (8.2): Beauty in simplicity. Love the lyrics.

**enecks** (8): **Me talking to my closet like**

**rickikardashian** (8): this sounds like a song on a romcom my mom would love

**Mrachnie** (7): This song is nice. Unlike She Will Be Loved, i believe it, and the softer instrumental fits the subject.

**scoutfincher** (7): It‚Äôs a pretty cute song, not much else I can say.

**themobiler99** (7): Doesn‚Äôt work as a slow number in the way ‚ÄúShe Will Be Loved‚Äù does. The chorus is good but overall I think it just drags the pace of the album down a notch. Still love it tho.

**shineflyer** (6): those super-soft plucks on the verses are life

**carvelbabel** (5): Kind of comes off as filler on an album of this quality, but a great song on its own.

---

##Alright with staying in, tyvm


**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Ugh I hate that chorus

**vapourlomo** (5): Not bad, but I forgot how the melody went about a minute after I stopped listening to it.

**CrispyEggs123** (4.5): Kinda bland...

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): this is boring but still better than the killers and my stomach hurts

The Sun is a fine song to listen to in the background, but nothing more. The jazzy sounds keep it interesting. It doesn‚Äôt have anything catchy about it‚Ä¶just another filler track. The solo vocals in the bridge is nice though, but it takes to long for it to appear ‚Äî by the time the more interesting parts appear I have been bored by the song enough to skip it.  

---

##Enjoying the warmth

**MihaMijat** (10): An amazing song that deserved to be a single and become one of their classic songs

**rickikardashian** (10): this feel a like asking adding any Amy Winehouse would have sung and I'm loving every part of it

**themobiler99** (10): most underrated track on the album, easily one of my favorite vocals on the whole disc. The lyrics are some of my fav on the album too, maybe because they were the easiest to relate to when I was 10 years old when this album dropped. Either way it‚Äôs always stuck with me and they hold up. I love how he stretches out multi-syllabic words into different notes along the melody line (see ‚Äútrying to re-cre-ate i-ma-ges‚Äù). The bridge is a highlight as well, omg he says SEX!1! God I could listen to this one on repeat all day.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I adore the instrumental here, it‚Äôs really dope, and the track just oozes sass. The outro is really nice, and it‚Äôs really nice to hear all these lush instruments work in harmony. The moments without Adam here are great too.

**anemonone** (8.6): What a great melody!

**1313Harbor** (8): I‚Äôd never heard this song before this rate and I honestly love it. The bass line is super groovy.

**scoutfincher** (8): This is a really chill, optimistic song about moving on from a breakup. I like it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Pretty cute. Nice outro too.

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): funk me harder papi

**CrispyEggs123** (6.5): The bridge is good‚Ä¶

---

##Melted by the heat

**shineflyer** (6.5): Adam, if you're only "several" miles from the sun, you're dead. Sorry to be a downer, but... that's science, man.

**sletrab07** (6.4): The intro is literally the exact same as¬†Tangled, only with a reggae drum beat. This album desperately needed culling.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): we're only 7 miles from the *crying in agony. sauwn

**mokitsu** (5): a biT forgettable

**MrSwearword** (5): too boring to like or hate

**vapourlomo** (3): I was in a band in junior high with a few other guys, and all of us had WILDLY different tastes. The bassist was normally really into super technical stuff (think Coheed & Cambria), but for whatever reason, he LOVED Maroon 5 and really wanted us to play this song. Since I was the singer, he expected me to rock an Adam Levine falsetto. I couldn't. He got angry at me for it. I got angry at him for wanting to play some lame faux-funk garbage. Eventually, we gave up and stuck to badly playing junior high garage band classics like "Song 2" and "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" and "Seven Nation Army." I forgot that "The Sun" even existed until I listened to it for this rate, and all that junior-high angst came crawling back. I'm sure it's a decent enough song, but it's forever ruined for me. Sorry. Nice guitar solo, though.

Warning Sign is a typical Coldplay song: a slow love song with rock elements to it. It has a nice melody to it. The lyrics don‚Äôt break any barriers, but they tell a classic story of realizing you didn‚Äôt realize how good you had it in your old relationship, and you want to get them back now that you appreciate them more. 

---

##Have open arms

**Banananaise** (10): beginning of the song: ok, sure. by the end of the song: AND I'M TI-RED / I SHOULD NOT HAVE LE-ET YOOOU GO

**vapourlomo** (10): I think this might be the most underrated Coldplay song. It's crushingly heartbreaking. The whole idea of looking for a "warning sign" for when a relationship might abruptly end is a highly relatable one, and it's clear that Chris Martin isn't over it yet. Tragic.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Really long track, but one of my favorite Coldplay album cuts. It hits all the notes and it‚Äôs just a really great listen. I don‚Äôt really know how to explain why I like it so much but it just has a lot of hazy atmosphere.

**themobiler99** (9): Great little song. I think it was a bad choice placing it right after Green Eyes, because it‚Äôs been overshadowed, but it stands on its own well.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Really pretty and emotional.

**scoutfincher** (8.2): It‚Äôs a lovely song about missing an ex-lover. The way Chris sings ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù just gets to me, and I adore the outro.

**mokitsu** (7.5): cute

**enecks** (7): My entire life is warning signs that nobody around me saw.


**shineflyer** (7): that reversed guitar sound is really cool. that ending piano section is sweet. and I'm a sucker for anything that says "I miss you" in it.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): this kinda sounds like the last song but maybe better

**bigtimesurreality** (6): I like the way this song builds up and falls back down again. It is kinda slow and drags in the beginning, but then when Chris sings, "The truth is I miss you" it starts to get pretty interesting.

---

##Missed the sign

**jamesfog** (7): I have no strong feelings on this one

**Mrachnie** (5): Wow i love filler!

**MrSwearword** (5): bored by the vocals but the production is lovely

**DraculaWeekend** (4.5): I forgot how boring the last half of this album is, and this song didn't help
