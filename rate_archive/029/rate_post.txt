[RATE] Early 2000’s Pop-Rock: Hot Fuss vs. Songs About Jane vs. A Rush of Blood to the Head
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/73qjy9/rate_early_2000s_poprock_hot_fuss_vs_songs_about/

[Hi everyone!](http://gph.is/2vua357) I’m strawberryswing1, and I’ll be your host for this rate. 

&nbsp;


The Killers, Coldplay, Maroon 5. For this rate we’ll be rating three of their earliest albums — two of the albums are the band’s debut albums, while Coldplay’s is their second album. They were all released in the 2002-2004 time frame. While being “rock” bands, they used catchy enough production and lyrics to have their singles chart on the Billboard top 40. (Coldplay’s “Clocks” only hit #29, while “This Love” and “Mr. Brightside” made top 10.) Fifteen years later these bands are still selling out stadiums and have devoted fanbases that still [buy their albums in numbers your fave has never seen](
http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7981900/the-killers-first-no-1-album-billboard-200-chart-wonderful-wonderful
). All three of these bands have their newer songs played on the radio to this day, but none of them sound the same now as they did when they first appeared (:eyes:).

So, let’s get back to basics and hear all three bands in their most “classic” eras...

### [The Killers - Hot Fuss](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KVf7fsWEL.jpg)

Hot Fuss is the Killer’s debut album, released in 2004. While the Killers are from Las Vegas, many people note that they have a sound that’s similar to British rock. Funnily enough, “Mr. Brightside” has done better in England than in the States, staying on the UK Top 200 charts to this day. Hot Fuss is described as an alternative rock/indie rock/new wave album. While the album only reached #7 on the Billboard 200 chart, and the lead single only reached #10, *Hot Fuss* is constantly labeled as one of the best debut albums of all time. “Mr. Brightside” especially has stood the test of time, with the band saying that it’s popularity keeps growing. Unfortunately, it may have been a little too ahead of its time to be appreciated. The album gained 5 Grammy nominations but did not win any. It has only a 66 on Metacritic. The Killers were noted for having a distinct, alternative sound in their very sonically cohesive album that set them apart from other bands at the time. Hot Fuss remains one of my favorite albums of all time to this day.

###[Maroon 5 - Songs About Jane](https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music3/v4/bc/0a/b3/bc0ab3da-9d18-aa63-9db9-4f8d9276b543/UMG_cvrart_00602537943869_01_RGB72_1500x1500_14UMGIM27076.jpg/600x600bf.jpg)

Oh, Maroon 5. Soccer moms had no idea what was going to hit them when this debut album was released in 2002. With songs like "This Love" and "Sunday Morning," it was no question the band would become a huge success. The band hit the sweet spot between having songs catchy enough to dance to while also having lyrics about heartbreak that can resonate with anyone.

And succeed they did, as this sub knows All Too Well™. Songs About Jane had tremendous success, hitting #15 on the Billboard 200 year end chart. The first 4 singles all made it into the top 40. The album was also generally well received from critics, and earned the band 2 Grammy's. While Maroon 5 is criticized for being too manufactured today, all but a few songs were only written by Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael (the keyboardist), and they were almost exclusively produced by Mark Wallace. The songs on this album feel genuine to the listener and a bit more than just a typical top 40 song about love, which is why they are still loved to this day.

While the singles are more polished pop-rock, I'd say the rest of the album is a bit more aggressively rock.

### [Coldplay - A Rush of Blood to the Head](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6e/Coldplay_-_A_Rush_of_Blood_to_the_Head.jpg)

A Rush of Blood to the Head is Coldplay’s second album and a favorite among their biggest fans today. This album is their most “rock” within their discography. While their debut album was more acoustic based while having that “white male singer-songwriter” vibe, this album is a bit more rough around the edges. It takes on topics beyond love and heartbreak, notably “Politik,” which was Martin’s response to the 9/11 attacks. This album is more piano and electric guitar based than their debut. Out of all their album’s, it remains Coldplay’s highest ranked on Metacritic, with a score of 80. A Rush of Blood to the Head is one of most sold albums of all time in their home country of England, ranking #32. It is 4x platinum in the US as well. It won Coldplay several awards, including 3 Grammy’s. While AROBTTH is not one of my favorite Coldplay albums, its singles are absolutely timeless. My high school's chorus sang "The Scientist" at our graduation, causing tears all throughout the stadium.

###Rules

Most of you probably know what to do by now. But even if you do, please read through this through anyway, because some things have changed:

- **I’ll start with something that’s actually a suggestion and not a rule:** I recommend listening to all albums at least once without rating them to soak them in. Then, return at a later time to re-listen and assign scores to the songs. Don’t procrastinate, trying to rate them in a rush makes the whole experience less enjoyable. There are only 34 songs in this rate, so it's not that bad.

- Actual rules now: **Listen to EVERY song and assign it a score from 1 to 10, inclusive. You may use one decimal — 9.7 is allowed, 9.75 is not.** You can change your scores at any time - just PM me again. I don’t like discord so please do everything over reddit. I’ll send out conformation replies saying I’ve officially got your scores. I’ll be checking that they aren’t too low or high and are in the proper format so the conformation will not be immediate, please have patience with me. [Send your scores in using this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=strawberryswing1&subject=2000s%20Rock%20Rate&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Hot%20Fuss%0A%0AJenny%20Was%20A%20Friend%20of%20Mine%3A%0A%0AMr.%20Brightside%3A%0A%0ASmile%20Like%20You%20Mean%20It%3A%0A%0ASomebody%20Told%20Me%3A%0A%0AAll%20These%20Things%20That%20I%27ve%20Done%3A%0A%0AAndy%2C%20You%27re%20a%20Star%3A%0A%0AOn%20Top%3A%0A%0AChange%20Your%20Mind%3A%0A%0ABelieve%20Me%20Natalie%3A%0A%0AMidnight%20Show%3A%0A%0AEverything%20Will%20Be%20Alright%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Songs%20About%20Jane%0A%0AHarder%20To%20Breathe%3A%0A%0AThis%20Love%3A%0A%0AShiver%3A%0A%0AShe%20Will%20Be%20Loved%3A%0A%0ATangled%3A%0A%0AThe%20Sun%3A%0A%0AMust%20Get%20Out%3A%0A%0ASunday%20Morning%3A%0A%0ASecret%3A%0A%0AThrough%20With%20You%3A%0A%0ANot%20Coming%20Home%3A%0A%0ASweetest%20Goodbye%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20A%20Rush%20of%20Blood%20to%20the%20Head%0A%0APolitik%3A%0A%0AIn%20My%20Place%3A%0A%0AGod%20Put%20A%20Smile%20Upon%20Your%20Face%3A%0A%0AThe%20Scientist%3A%0A%0AClocks%3A%0A%0ADaylight%3A%0A%0AGreen%20Eyes%3A%0A%0AWarning%20Sign%3A%0A%0AA%20Whisper%3A%0A%0AA%20Rush%20Of%20Blood%20To%20The%20Head%3A%0A%0AAmsterdam%3A%0A%0AEND).

- You are allowed to give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is one song for the entire rate, NOT one per album. These are **optional** and are meant to signify your favorite and least favorite song. 

- Your scores should NOT be considered confidential. I’ll probably be posting lists of all scores received for each song as it’s revealed. 

- **I will be enforcing a minimum average for this rate.** That means that if your average for any given album is below a certain threshold, I won't accept your scores and you'll have to resend them. I also reserve the right to reject your scores if I think you're intentionally trying to sabotage the results and not just rating songs based on how well you like them. You're allowed to dislike an album, but you're not allowed to be obnoxious about it.

-  Also don't give every song on an album a 10 or something like that. Have some nuance in your scores.

I'll be using Poo’s program and I suck at this computer programming stuff, so for Poo’s sake make it easy for me so I won’t have to bother him too much with questions.

- You may (and are encouraged to!) include comments with your scores. To include a comment, just write it directly after your score, like this:

> Green Eyes: 2 Chris, Gwen has blue eyes what are you doing get out while you can she sticks rocks up her vagina

- **WRITE IT IN THE CORRECT FORMAT.** It's there for you in the private message link, just add number then optionally space then your comments. Space it correctly!

- Please don't write tons of excessively long comments for multiple songs. I want to include everyone's comments but if they get too long it becomes hard to do so.

- You may (and are also encouraged to!) include comments for particular albums. Feel free to write assays for these. **To include a comment, add a colon and write it directly on the album line**, like this:

> Album: Songs About Jane: Why can’t they be making songs like this now instead of this trop-pop crap?????? Jane plz come back we beg you.

PM it all to me. Then just sit tight until the reveal begins some time in November!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask below. I'll be accepting scores until the end of the month. For now we’ll say the due date is **November 1st**. I’ll give out extensions if you ask nicely but please make my life easier and just get it done before the end of the month.
