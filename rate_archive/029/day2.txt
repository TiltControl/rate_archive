As a big fan of the song, ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Go Home Without You,‚Äù I was a bit disappointed to find out that this song was indeed, not that song. The fake live audience is indeed a *choice* ‚Äî I feel like they‚Äôre trying to make this song a statement that they are indeed a rock band despite their poppier singles. It is still one of the better album tracks. I like the way he quickly sings ‚Äúit don‚Äôt matter, because I ain‚Äôt coming home.‚Äù The instruments and Adam‚Äôs vocals pair really well. It could be improved by being shortened a little bit. 

---

**anemonone** (9.2): Omg those vocal runs!!

**enecks** (9): mmm those synths at the start mmm yummy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Another snarky track from Adam here - a flurry of guitar and some revenge-addict vocals marks this late album cut that just works.

**CrispyEggs123** (8.5): Good song but Harder To Breathe is a better version of this...

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): good

**DraculaWeekend** (8): Why did they make this a faux-live version? WHY??

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Love the funky guitar on the song. But the ending... was this performed live or did they add that post production?

**Mrachnie** (7): This song is weird. I like the piano in this, but the melody kinda never goes anywhere? And in the lyrics Adam seems suspiciously focused on telling his ex that he's "over" her to the point where it seems he isn't.

---

**themobiler99** (7): I like it but it‚Äôs not special. Tangled and Shiver already do way better at this same type of song, so this one doesn‚Äôt really HAVE to be here Also wtf is with the fake crowd noise at the beginning and throughout?

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): It's funky and interesting, but the applause in the background is annoying.

**scoutfincher** (6): The constant cheering in the background is very distracting and annoying. But despite the crowd, this track is decent.

**1313Harbor** (5): Is this a fake live recording? It‚Äôs distracting.

**atlastata** (5): What is this, a fake live track?

**shineflyer** (4.5): putting audience cheers throughout the song is a kinda cool choice. it paints a picture

**carvelbabel** (5): I‚Äôd probably rate this one this a little higher if it weren‚Äôt for the stupid dubbed fake audience cheering sprinkled throughout the track to make it sound like a live performance. Who are you trying to fool hunny?

---

**mokitsu** (5): filler

**vapourlomo** (5): This reminds me of an off-brand Red Hot Chili Peppers. I already don't like RHCP, so this isn't doing anything for me.

**MrSwearword** (4): Levine, if I used and abused you I‚Äôd be like you and the band using and abusing the same beat on most of this album

One of the strongest album tracks, I think this could have been the last single from this album. It has Maroon 5‚Äôs distinct sound, really nice instrumentals, and a good buildup to the chorus. The guitar is really groovy. 

---

**themobiler99** (9.5): Nearly god tier. Great staggered singing in the verses, the subject matter of the song may be a bit yawn, but the lyrics fit it perfectly and creatively. The chorus is amazing, I love the climbing melody and the close harmonies in the ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done you so wrong‚Äù section. The first instance of the chorus is better though, when Adam goes into the higher octave and American Idol mode some of the magic is lost.

**DraculaWeekend** (9): That "ROUND HERE" falsetto riff gives me chills

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Love the buildup in the chorus, the background vocals, and the instrumental here. It‚Äôs a really strong non-single, and I can‚Äôt get enough of his high notes here.

**scoutfincher** (7.5): Interesting to see a song from the perspective of the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù who‚Äôs apologizing for the things he‚Äôs done, though I wish he was a bit more specific about what exactly he did that was so shameful. And this song is pretty groovy.

**Mrachnie** (7): I like the lyrics and the use of choir, but can Adam please decide if he's a hero or a villain?

---

**mokitsu** (5): a biT forgettable

**MrSwearword** (5): Levine‚Äôs vocals are so tepid and uninspiring and just half-assed like the beat

**shineflyer** (5): a nice background music jam. (also, is anyone else hearing a bit of the chorus for Kylie's Spinning Around in this? or is it just me?)

**vapourlomo** (4): This sounds like some mediocre white-boy funk band slumming it in a Holiday Inn lobby.

I absolutely love the guitar on this song. The beginning where it‚Äôs just the guitar and the other instruments join in is so great to me. Less dark of a subject than the other songs on the album, it‚Äôs a breath of fresh air which helps the album have a variety of tracks while staying cohesive at the same time. 

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Killer This Song Sounds Like: Andrei Chikatilo

---

**mustangs16** (10): this is a bit of a weird song but i love it an awful lot

**vapourlomo** (9): This song is a nice break from the glam and snark of Hot Fuss to showcase the band's adorable sincere side. It's like a less ironic version of a Strokes song.

**shineflyer** (8.5): this feels so sweet to me. maybe because the lyrics connect so strongly for me.

**1313Harbor** (8): Not very memorable, but I always like it when I hear it.

**scoutfincher** (8): This just sounds so bouncy and fun despite the subject matter. I love how desperate Brandon sounds.

**anemonone** (7.5): Super simple and cute

**themobiler99** (7): A much warmer song than most on the album. It suffers by comparison, simply because it‚Äôs not a pure classic like many of the tracks here. But it‚Äôs very enjoyable.

**Banananaise** (6.5): in Australia this song was replaced with Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll which is equally forgettable now that I am well and truly past my 2000s alt indie phase

---

**DraculaWeekend** (5.5): Sounds like a Strokes song

**vapourlomo** (9): This song is a nice break from the glam and snark of Hot Fuss to showcase the band's adorable sincere side. It's like a less ironic version of a Strokes song.

---

**bigtimesurreality** (6): This kind of dips its toes into the indie sound of the time but it doesn't really shine. I like the vocal harmonies in the verses though.

**Mrachnie** (6): Kinda filler tbh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): The album is starting to get repetitive already. Song is forgettable.

**MrSwearword** (3): yeah fine, whatever this is kinda boring as shit

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): lmao the stereo effect at the beginning is so bad i could do that in audacity. anyway this song is boring

This song represents a lot of my problems with the album as a whole. The instruments sound too rough and loud. The subject matter has been repeated a million times in different ways on this album alone. 

---

**Mrachnie** (9.5): This is dramatic in the best way possible.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Oof the piano here. And the way it just like explodes then drops, then goes back to a well-needed dramatic instrumental break.

**themobiler99** (9): Great guitar riffage. Man I wish they still made music like this, THEY WERE GREAT AT IT. Good lyrics, great vocals, really good hook. Comes at a weird position on the album though, not sure how it could have been worked into the tracklist better.

**anemonone** (8.5): Adam didn't come to play; love the raw anger. I feel this one.

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): So much attitude in this song. Love it

**enecks** (8): A nice groove

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): sounds good bros

**MrSwearword** (7): at least this sounds different compared to the album but goddamn this is barely above average

**scoutfincher** (6.5): This is definitely another funky kiss-off to an ex-lover jam, but I wish the chorus was a bit punchier and more emotional.

---

**sletrab07** (6.4): OK, the album is beginning to drag at this point. This song feels like too much filler.¬†Harder to Breathe¬†does everything this one does, but better.

**vapourlomo** (6): Adam Levine has always done a good job of expressing bitterness, and although the song itself isn't anything special, Levine shines here.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): fillerish

**shineflyer** (2): k, this sound's gettin a bit generic guys. you gotta throw me a curveball at some point.

With this album, I was having trouble distinguishing the songs from each other. This song is a representation of that ‚Äî yet another song with about the same instrumentals, vocals, and subject matter. It‚Äôs not *bad*, but not great either. I wouldn‚Äôt reach for this song on it‚Äôs own. The chorus is nice. 

---


**MihaMijat** (10): The most underrated song from the album, it's so sweet and chill, and deserves as much praise as the other masterpieces on the album

**MrSwearword** (10): sure, it‚Äôs the same recycled beat but I think I can give full marks to the most pleasant of the recycled mess

**mustangs16** (10): honestly, this is my second favorite song on this album and i‚Äôm going to be quite disappointed if it doesn‚Äôt at least make it into the top 20

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This closer just flows. Adam is in pain here, and you can just hear it all over the chorus. I always forget about this track and find my surprised upon relistening.

**enecks** (8): nice

**poppinmmolly** (8): this song was in Love Actually

**CrispyEggs123** (7.5): Cute song, I like the guitars

---

**themobiler99** (7): Not the sweetest track. Sounds like a track meant for another band that Maroon 5 accidentally wrote. I don‚Äôt skip it, it‚Äôs still ok, but why end the album with this?

**scoutfincher** (7.5): This is a decent album closer. It sounds so soulful with a tinge of sadness.

**anemonone** (7.8): Great melody, Adam's vocals carry it well, but I feel like it was a weak closer :(

---

**DraculaWeekend** (6.5): Boring verses but the chorus and guitar solo redeemed it

**mokitsu** (6.5): ok this sounds like 80% of the album...not bad but not good either

**Mrachnie** (6.5): This song seems like a good way to close the album, with it's theme of letting go and saying goodbye. However, it's not much more than just a statement and doesen't work outside of the album's context.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): feeeeheaal. goodnight everyone

**vapourlomo** (6): It's a solid closer. Nothing special, but not too bad.

**shineflyer** (4): the filler tracks at the end of this album have made me numb to figuring out what number to give each song.

I‚Äôm disappointed this didn‚Äôt make the top 15. It‚Äôs such a lively song. It immediately gets you going. Like other songs on the album, it‚Äôs about murder (with this song describing the murder itself), and you can get the vibe that there‚Äôs something *bad* going on with the way Brandon sings ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs trying to persuade the audience. He plays around with his voice here, too, and it‚Äôs great ‚Äî he screams out ‚ÄúInto the midnight show! Faster!,‚Äù and smoothly tells us, ‚Äú*I know what you want*.‚Äù It ends with him desparely exclaiming, ‚ÄúShe said she loved me!‚Äù He is upset that he killed her, but more upset over Jenny‚Äôs wrongdoing. The ending ‚Äúif you can keep a secret‚Äù reminds me of the PLL theme song, ‚ÄúTwo can keep a secret if one of them is dead.‚Äù Unfortunately for Jenny, she ended up dead.  

---


**themobiler99** (8.8): Big change of style fro the rest of the album as far as the instrumental goes. Heavy guitar work that just works. Great vocals as usual. The song does possibly blow it‚Äôs wad too early though. The first ‚ÄúDRIVE FASTER<BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOI-EEEE_OOOYYYYY‚Äù is a top moment on the album, and the song doesn‚Äôt have anywhere to go after that. Still great though. I like the outro because I‚Äôm an outro whore but as far as outros go this one isn‚Äôt all that necessary.

---

**scoutfincher** (8.5): I love how dark this is. Brandon sounds absolutely sinister on here and I love it. It ties into Jenny Was a Friend of Mine in a really cool way if you pay close attention to the lyrics. The synths in the outro sound perfectly eerie. This song perfectly ties into Jenny Was a Friend of Mine as it portrays the actual murder of Jenny.

**1313Harbor** (8): Second part of the Murder trilogy. I love how ominous these lyrics are.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Killer This Song Sounds Like: Jeffrey Dahmer

**Mrachnie** (7): I like the raw sound of this. Also another song about murder. I guess it's fitting given the band's name?

**vapourlomo** (5): Another song about murder! But not as memorable or good as the first one.

---

**enecks** (8): I once stayed up at midnight to bid on some furry porn. I lost that bid.

---

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): i skipped this and then realized i'm not allowed to do that and i had to go back. idk why i even did that. it's not that bad.

**shineflyer** (6.5): is this Franz Ferdinand?

**MrSwearword** (6): at least this had production on its side

**bigtimesurreality** (5): I like the lyrical concept of this but it doesn't have a very strong hook.

This feels like a less catchy version of Harder to Breathe. Another song where the instruments are too loud and take over the song. 

---

**DraculaWeekend** (9): That guitar solo!!!

**themobiler99** (9): Amazing but not god tier. Sick guitar riffage, sick drum patterns, and I love the octaved vocals in the chorus. Maybe the best use of that kind of harmony on the album.Adam going up the octave in verse 2 is a great changeup too. His ‚Äúfeel your heart begin to race‚Äù delivery I just realized is like a proto-proto-proto-animals-mals howl.

**anemonone** (8.8): Oooh super fun instrumentation

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I really love the guitar riff in this song.

**mokitsu** (8): this is really good, okay..they snapped

**Mrachnie** (8): I really like the guitar on this.

**shineflyer** (8): harmonies, guitar, jazzy electric keyboard, and Adam Levine sounding like a singer instead of a soft alarm clock.

**carvelbabel** (7.5): Can we talk about the guitar in this song?? I have to struggle to even hear the actual instruments in their more recent stuff.

**scoutfincher** (7.1): The Indian-inspired guitar riffs are really cool and add to the sexy feeling of the song.

---

**CrispyEggs123** (4): The guitars almost distracted me from the fact that this song is a mess... also Coldplay did it better.

**LuckyKidA** (3.4): My favorite Coldplay song.

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Not one of the more iconic tracks on the record. The piecemeal delivery is very similar to This Love‚Äôs and it is way less interesting, imo.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): It's alright. Nothing too exciting though.

**vapourlomo** (7): It's got a bit of bite to it for sure. Not much else to say.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i feel like this song is generic and sounds like the others and the backing vocals... they don't sound good

**bigtimesurreality** (4): This just doesn't work. It sounds extremely messy/all over the place.

**MrSwearword** (1): just for the uttering of ‚Äúenjoy the taste I leave in your mouth‚Äù; it sounds awful from him.

This song is absolutely beautiful. The lyrics are full of imagery and sound like poetry. It doesn‚Äôt get boring, even though it‚Äôs one of the longest songs, it builds up into a powerful verse, then comes back down for Chris to plead about his troubles. A great title track. 

---

**mokitsu** (10): soooo intense....i fucking love this

**Mrachnie** (10): This song is so massive. The lyrics paint an image beautifully and the instrumental is only making them shine.

**themobiler99** (10): The chorus here is transcendent and I love the lyrics (in a cosmic early 2000s way). Very successful at taking the slow moody vibe the band really wanted to work with but actually also being a song with meat and substance. I fucking love the way Chris sings ‚ÄúHoney‚Äù in the hook. Such a little thing but it gives me the tinglies.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This is my least listened to song from the album, but I‚Äôm not sure why? It‚Äôs really good and I think I should listen to it more.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Poetry tbh

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): lol this is so dramatic it kinda scared me. that chorus is strong tho

**carvelbabel** (8): This song is a grower. This should have been the closer to the album but I digress.

**scoutfincher** (8): I love the imagery presented in the song with the couple‚Äôs relationship and troubles presented as a house, and ‚Äúblame it on a rush of blood to the head‚Äù is a cool phrase. I really appreciate the hook.

**vapourlomo** (8): Probably the best Coldplay song about arson.

**bigtimesurreality** (7.5): I really appreciate the message of this song, but it's not as powerful as say, Politik. I do like the way it kind of winds down the album, it transitions nicely into Amsterdam.

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A damn good title track. It‚Äôs probably the most complete thesis of the album, and feels like a bombastic climax for the entire project.

**mustangs16** (5): kind of disappointing that the title track is one of the weaker songs on the album

---

**enecks** (7): It gets there

**rickikardashian** (7): It literally healed forever to get good

**shineflyer** (5.5): I was afraid of this being blander since it's almost 6 min long, but it wasn't bad. Wasn't amazing either, though.

**anemonone** (4): There's some cool parts, but the song is unnecessarily long

**DraculaWeekend** (4): zzzzzz

This song was actually a single, but it didn‚Äôt perform well. It‚Äôs an interesting sound for Coldplay - the acoustic guitar has an Indian sound to it almost, and they mix it with electric guitar as well. The lyrics are interesting, too, ‚ÄúWhen you work out where to draw the line / Your guess is as good as mine‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhere do we go, nobody knows‚Äù touch on subjects of morality, religion, and the afterlife. This song is a stand out from the rest of the album‚Äôs sound, though it‚Äôs not my favorite. 

---

**sletrab07** (11): This is, simply, one of the most well-written songs ever recorded. Every little element is delicately perfect. The placement on the album, the length, that descending chord progression, that GUITAR RIFF, the persistence of the drums, the slinky vocal line, the build-up in the bridge. GUY‚ÄôS BASS LINE LITERALLY INVENTED SEX, YOUR FAVE COULD NEVER.

**dropthehammer11** (10): A fun, bouncy song with a nice mix of acoustic and electric.

**Mrachnie** (10): The guitar riff on this song is nearly perfect. The lyrics are exactly what i would call "real deep".

**bigtimesurreality** (8): I like the key change from the verses to the chorus.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): The repetition near the end isn't as powerful as it is in In My Place, and the transition from first to second person isn't as clever as Chris probably thought it was. A good song regardless, though.

**vapourlomo** (8): The on-album cut is a solid, minor-key jam. However, when they play it live, it becomes an absolute MONSTER. I wish the studio version of this song reflected that intense energy, but it's a pretty great song nonetheless.

**scoutfincher** (7.6): The lyrics are thought-provoking and I dig the darker tone of this song as well as the mix of acoustic and electric guitars.

**anemonone** (7): Not interesting enough to be that long, but it has some cool guitar parts

**shineflyer** (6.8): maybe just a bit longer than it needs to be, but it's got a cool and creative melody to it, and i'm always down for acoustic guitar in my Coldplay song.

--- 

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is kinda long and really nice but it doesn‚Äôt stick out to me as much as the other tracks on this album imo.

**carvelbabel** (6.5): Okay, even my crazy Coldplay stanning ass can admit that this one starts off really boring and can put you to sleep unless you muscle through the first minute and a half to get to that lit chorus.

**rickikardashian** (5.5): why is he singing out of tone, this is the exact same tone from yellow and the scientist

**MrSwearword** (5): cute, but so not fitting of Coldplay in my opinion.

**themobiler99** (4): Way too long and nondescript to be allowed. I have no idea what they were thinking with the construction and sequencing on this album.

Is anyone actually reading these?? Okay, whatever. A Rush of Blood To The Head is Coldplay‚Äôs most rock album, a growth from their mainly acoustic singer-songwriter sound of their debut album, Parachutes. They plunge head first into their new sound with the starter song *Politik*. Heavy guitars and angry lyrics paced out with pockets of Chris‚Äôs lone voice singing softly in between the noise, Politik is an angry call to action written after the 9/11 attacks. Coldplay actually included [this note](https://imgur.com/qaVbXqj
) about it in their album lyric book, and have remained a very charitable band to this day.

**CrispyEggs123** (10): The best opening track in the rate... That outro is beautiful...

**dropthehammer11** (10): Such a great opener. Tender, sensitive track with some bombastic guitars

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of the more underrated songs of Coldplay‚Äôs. I love the the steady drums and the change from soft to intense throughout the song. Just an all round good song that I hope people will appreciate.

**MrSwearword** (10): just for the opening being so well produced; Chris Martin‚Äôs singing does nothing but play subordinate to the beat but the beat is so great.

**anemonone** (9.5): This song surprised me with how good it was. I'm head-banging to a Coldplay song, that's a first... I just wish we saw more of this on the album

**bigtimesurreality** (9): This is a good intro to the album; its tone is quite haunting and I think that it's a good way to introduce the themes of despair, worry, and discontent that are in the album.

**DraculaWeekend** (9): Chills at that intro

**enecks** (9): What a rush of blood to the head! hahahaha I have no sense of humor which is tough because that's my sole coping mechanism

**Nfranklin50** (9): this sounds a little beatlesy and I love it

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): STRUM STRUM STRUM STRUM STRUM STRUM STRUM STRUM

**vapourlomo** (9): Those opening post-rock guitars are so unlike Coldplay, but they really work here! Pissed-off Coldplay is a rare treat, enjoy it when you can.

**sletrab07** (8.7): Fascinating lyrics, especially when you contextualise it with its 9/11 inception. The ‚Äúgive me love over this‚Äù bridge is achingly moving. Fuck variety, Coldplay‚Äôs over-the-top 30-second held note of an outro is legendary.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Strong opener. Godly outro.

**carvelbabel** (8): Brilliant opener.

**Mrachnie** (8): I like how this song switches between being really energetic and being really chill. The lyrics take on a subject that is still relevant to today's reality.

**jamesfog** (7.5): It kinda feels like this song builds up to something that never happens

**mokitsu** (7.5): a cute intro, goes on for too long imo...

**Mysario** (7.5): I don't think this is a bad song, just a bad opener to an album

**rickikardashian** (6): at the end it good better but the beginning was just bad

**scoutfincher** (5.5): I appreciate the message of the song, but I do wish it had stronger lyrics and more interesting delivery. As it stands, it‚Äôs not really saying that much about the world post-9/11 because the lyrics are quite vague. The repetition of the chorus is pretty cool, though, like a call to action, and I like the song‚Äôs intro.

**shineflyer** (5.5): pretty. not too interesting, but pretty.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): chris martin sounds like kermit the frog lol

**themobiler99** (4): Not a great start, I literally only listen to this song when I'm specifically listening to the whole album. Fake deep lyrics, barely an acceptable mood setter.

Amsterdam is, simply put, a beautiful and powerful song. An underdog in this rate, for the longest time this was ranked #10, but it fell as the last submitter‚Äôs scores came in. I‚Äôm happy popheads appreciated it. While it does start out slow, and you think, *here we go, another long Coldplay song*, it booms into a moving song. It closes the album with the hopeful note, ‚ÄúStood on the edge / tied to a noose / but you came along and you cut me loose‚Äù.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love this song so much. It one of the songs lyrical that really hits hard for me. It‚Äôs such a powerful song.

**mokitsu** (10): very gorgeous power ballad! a highlight!

**vapourlomo** (10): I've always felt that Coldplay typically has underwhelming album closers, but that's not the case at all here. Amsterdam starts slow and gorgeous, but when it begins to slow-burn. When it hits that climax, it feels like a sledgehammer. Power ballad executed to perfection.

**themobiler99** (9.7): I‚Äôve always loved this style of simple ballad way more than the normal person probably does. It‚Äôs not perfect like the Scientist and I guess the arrangement isn‚Äôt very interesting but the melody and vocals carry the whole thing with amazing power.

**Mrachnie** (9.5): This song is absolutely amazing! The lyrics somehow say so much while saying so little. The whole song feels like a build-up to the 3d verse which is such a satisfying culmination to the song and the album as a whole.

**sletrab07** (9.5): Their most underrated song by far. One of the only songs that can get me to cry.

**scoutfincher** (9): Chris‚Äôs voice is so beautiful and dreamy on this track. It‚Äôs a sad track because he feels so hopeless and in need of help, but I also love how it implies the power of love helps him and gives him hope. "I know I'm dead on the surface, but I am screaming underneath‚Äù is such a great, powerful lyric that really stuck with me. A very lovely album closer.

**bigtimesurreality** (8.5): It sounds like a standard piano ballad at first, but the transition is amazing. And I like that the album ends on a high note- "you came along and you cut me loose" is a good way to end it.

**enecks** (8): Like Amsterdam I wish I went to this song more.

**MrSwearword** (8): at least the piano work is lovely

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A ballady closer that opens up near the end, which makes for a pretty nice ending to this album.

**shineflyer** (6.5): Chris Martin plays a pretty piano. I wish the song had a better melody, because there's a lot I like here, but the lack of a strong melody means I probably won't remember this as well.

**DraculaWeekend** (4): If you weren't already asleep by the end of the album, then this song probably did it for you

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3.5): eh this is boring and too dramatic and the final chorus's volume boost scared me

**anemonone** (3): His voice is precious but this song is bland
