**skargardin** (6): And here's our first day 2 cut. There's some really interesting production going on here and the vocals during the chorus are heavenly, but personally, I was waiting for it to go bigger even if the vibes are definitely there. Submitted by u/you2009

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the vibe this sets up is so fucking cool

**gwykiki** (7): the vibes are immaculate, it's just missing a little something

**awry** (6): i feel like even though there's this progression to the sound (pizzicato strings go legato, the hi-hats kick in etc), there's just not enough happening here. not a bad song though

**imbaby122** (6): kinda movie soundtrack vibes… or like maybe something my eccentric uncle would play in the car. not necessarily my type of music but i can appreciate it.

**runaway3212** (6): this kinda feels like a vocal undertale battle theme

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This song feels like an endless build-up… Where is the shouty chorus??

**skargardin** (9): I feel like this is one of those genres where you're either going to love it or hate it with no in-between. I love this eurodance moment, it's so silly and fun. I could see myself going off to this in the club for sure. Submitted by u/MassiveThief

**CarlieScion** (8): THE GUITAR?

**skargardin** (7): I really like the vocals here, but there's something about the way that they're produced that makes it not work as well as it could, like it's too heavy on the autotune. Otherwise it's really solid, I absolutely love the guitar and just .. the overall vibe of it. Submitted by u/gravityrushing

---

**seanderlust** (10): stan luana

**throwaway-7650** (10): me when I'm asked who won the 2021 electronic pop rate

**jsonphile** (9.5): okay so songs I don’t know very rarely get higher than a 9, just because I haven’t had the time to fully appreciate it, but this song blew me away when I heard it. The singer is just so passionate and has such a gorgeous voice, the instrumental is great and rises and falls with the song, and a killer key change. It just misses a 10 because it uses the four chord progression every song uses-it uses it well, but come on change it up

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): woah....... lemme saving

**anothertown** (9): such an early 2000s pop rock slay

**DefaultPophead** (9): Luana, girl, you're killing it.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): ok ms kelly clarkson

**runaway3212** (9): Yass

**TiltControls** (9): Reminds me of some of the pop-punk power ballads of the 2000s in the best way

**camerinian** (8.5): loving the 2000s pop backing on this. Not sure about that key change though

**synyyy** (8.5): key change dammit

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): this sounds like about 10 different songs i know but i can't figure out which ones but like they're songs i like i think

**1998tweety** (8): bops

**afs** (8): I was convinced there would be a reggaeton beat somewhere

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): That key change isn’t completely necessary but I’m still passing.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait i like this a lot!! Come on acoustic

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): It’s in your heaaaaaad, in your heaaaaaaa- oh shit wrong song lol

**shipperondeck** (8): when key changes are good

**SmileAndTears** (8): Is this supposed to be a cover of Zombies or....?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.9): ugh why is this so short! this would’ve been so good if it was a minute longer

**PAHC** (7.5): guitar goes quite hard and so does key change

**pig-serpent** (7.5): The acoustic part of this song is amazing and I wish it stayed like that. The electric parts are still good but I think the song would’ve been better without them. Also the key change is rough.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This sounds like a BLACKPINK song

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): Really upset with how autotuned her voice is given how good the melody and production are

**qazz23** (7): decently catchy but a bit too polished

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): If anyone has any recs for Spanish-language rock songs I am listening

**slimboyfriend** (6.9): I like it but it kind of has that sheen of bad Christian rock

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Lovely vocals, but the percussion is unnecessary

**MrMoodle** (6.5): kind of weird vocals for the style but i get the 2000s nostalgia vibes from it. too short and the key change felt unearned lol

**NecroDolphinn** (6.5): I wasn’t expecting the more rock instrumentals to come in, but I pleasantly enjoyed them. Sadly, pleasant enjoyment is the best I can say about this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it’s giving high school musical ballad

**nt96** (6): its ok but the autotune gets a bit too grating for me

**starla\_** (5.8): this is okay

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.5): it's okay i guess

**awry** (5): okay ig

**welcome2thejam** (5): Decent pop rock

**imbaby122** (4): i do like a key change. i do not like an acoustic guitar. let’s leave it at that.

**skargardin** (9): Patti's delivery on this song for me, totally takes it to the next level, like this absolutely slaps. I wish this could've placed a bit higher but here we are. Apparently her vocals weren't for everyone, a shame! Submitted by u/static_int_husp

**CarlieScion** (3): no comment

---

**awry** (10): ahhh i love this song so much! the character she embodies is portrayed in such a fun way, and the build-up, and the slow-down! jesus found bald and beardless!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I feel so cultured right now

**jman457** (10): Patti walked so girlies like Tori and Fiona could run

**pig-serpent** (10): With apologies to pussy and weed, “Jesus died for somebody’s sins but not mine” is absolutely the best opening line in the rate and possibly of all time.

**qazz23** (10): love this version - she makes it her own and the buildup is intense

**ReallyCreative** (10): vaguely sapphic rock song with biblical themes? Well mark me down as religiously traumatized AND gagged

**steelstepladder** (10): I swear to all that is holy if y'all rob Patti Smith I will do something to get us posted on r/subredditdrama

**Stryxen** (10): what an amazing opening line, and gorgest song, must listen to this album

**WaneLietoc** (10): rock on patti this one still rips bc its just her and the boys getting down and making real guitar bar rock ditties about kissing girls bc your a girl too ! you think this was an og? just that first part really but that re-contextualization rules and totally gets me going. the guitar is nuggets-core. michael stipe stayed up all night eating cherries and realized he wanted to be a rock star. THAT'S how powerful this ditty was in the 70s it invented new rock stars.

**PAHC** (9.5): fantastic discovery

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): okay ms patti

**starla\_** (9.1): I'm gay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Let’s go lesbians!

**jsonphile** (9): okay if we sang this in church I’d enjoy it a lot more

**nt96** (9): ended all of your queer faves in one fell swoop

**synyyy** (9): Fiona apple before Fiona apple

**Verrem** (9): ahead of her time obviously

**yearofthesoup** (9): i used to wonder why anyone would name their child Gloria until I heard this song

**camerinian** (8.5): god I love a song that just feels like it’s always building to something bigger

**NecroDolphinn** (8.5): I love Patti Smith

**shipperondeck** (8.4): iconic

**imbaby122** (8): patti went crazy on this track im obsessed with her vocal performance it’s so cunt.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): what do you mean this isn’t about the hippo from Madagascar

**welcome2thejam** (8): Kinda grown off me, tbh. Climax still smashes of course

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): g l o o i a

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): "Jesus died for somebody’s sins but not mine" is an iconic line, but this goes on too long and it’s not hitting like I remembered [EDIT: hi horse girls… I only just realized that I was streaming the live version and basing my score on that… Not that the live version is bad by any means, the energy goes off, the album version just sounds tighter to me and I would have rated it higher. I am so sorry for my mid Pitchfork score.]

**BasedButta** (7): funniest song in the rate

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i’ll take ‘biggest placement jump if we had rated this on indieheads’ for 200 alex

=====

PrimaryCrusaders: Good news for you /u/anothertown, she literally has a song called "Rock N Roll (N-Word with the Hard R)". I was *very* surprised to find out it was a real song and it's no wonder the label automatically rejected it as the lead single.

Because the Night is the superior Patti Smith song imo (and even then it's solely because of the Cascada version)

**CarlieScion** (10): more like the r10ver am I right

**skargardin** (8): I have a soft spot for Aurora's music and this song is no exception. Her vocals are otherwordly as always and the shimmery synths are to die for. Apparently some are of the opinion that her voice doesn't necessarily suite synthpop and I have to highly disagree. Submitted by u/uberpigeon

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Honestly I hate nature and being outside in any capacity but this song is a YAAAASSSSS.

**Stryxen** (10): love, a little corny and generic but it’s really fun. I used to listen to this album and paint a lot during lockdown <3

**Uberpigeon** (10): this song changed my life by making me stan aurora and therefore introducing the struggle of me trying to convince popheads shes not mid

**TiltControls** (9.5): This is so good! I've heard a few AURORA tracks before but this is by far the coolest so far

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Norwegian brilliance strikes once again.

**ReallyCreative** (9): ok synths!

**seanderlust** (9): YOU can cry, I had my tear ducts welded shut. we are not the same

**vayyiqra** (9): Aurora's music is so pretty I feel bad for not liking her more also hi legend /u/PeachPlumParity

**akanewasright** (8.5): 1989 for the quirky girls among us?

**starla\_** (8.5): ethereal

**synyyy** (8.5): don't wanna cry

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): kkb outsold

**DaHumanTorch** (8.3): baby queen and taylor swift comparisons in the rates channel i'm so sorry aurora sweetie

**afs** (8): Eminem found aged 139

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): i used to listen to this song a lot 3 years ago and it still holds up pretty well

**DefaultPophead** (8): Feels like a song that'd have a movie tie-in.

**nt96** (8): I stan a gluten free, non-GMO version of Bjork

**pig-serpent** (8): The synth pallet is a little cheesy but I love the hook enough to look past it.

**qazz23** (8): love the vocals during the chorus

**rslashpoopheads** (8): theme song to Melted, the sequel to the hit movie Frozen II

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Everything I see reminds me of her (Caroline Polachek)

**itsabop** (7.9): I can cry...

**shipperondeck** (7.8): i've been meaning to get into her. very pretty honestly

**jman457** (7.7): a good synthpop song but pretty par for the course for Aurora

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): ctrl+f ’white woman synthpop’

**NecroDolphinn** (7.5): The build to the chorus is so enjoyable I just wish it had the tiniest bit more heaviness to it if that makes any sense. Regardless, Aurora’s voice remains so heavenly.

**PAHC** (7.5): marina love + fear but make it girlboss

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): count of songs I'd give a 10 if someone else sang it: 1

**awry** (7.2): not hating on aurora or anything but i if i didn't know it was her, i would immediately think it's ionna lee lol. maybe those pasty white ethereal scandi girls should change up their beats sometimes!

**plastichaxan** (6.5): i think it’s time for me to admit i don’t like aurora as much as you’d think if you take a look at my lastfm

**anothertown** (6): bloodless

**camerinian** (6): hmmm yes this Aurora song is made of Aurora song

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Sometimes a gay person will say “why isn’t everyone streaming _____ it’s pop perfection!” and then they’ll link it and it’s yet another synthpop song that sounds exactly like this.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Odd, I can see the version of myself that adores this and its "shout this out its cathartic" potential, but I'm tired at 1am and its just not hitting

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Sounds like Sia attempting to be ethereal

**slimboyfriend** (5.1): boneless bjork

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i’ve heard so many aurora songs and i think she’s just not for me, i’m sorry

**frogaranaman** (5): are you supposed to feel like you're drowning listening to her music or

**imbaby122** (5): ok who gave aurora the synths? or was she always a synthpop artist but her cottagecore persona threw me off the scent? either way please take them away from her it feels wrong.

**ricki** (5): mother river

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is like if halsey sang style by taylor swift

**WaneLietoc** (5): she seems like she's a nice pixie girl who can fix you. personally tho I'll let Jenny Hval solve those issues. "endearing mid".

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): the verses are nice but the chorus isn't doing it for me

**2dina3dworld** (4): I’m sorry but Aurora doesn’t do it for me

**runaway3212** (4): dollar store Florence + The Machine

---

**flavasavavandal** (10): a song I knew before going into the rate. I've been a fairly big fan of Jetty Bones since ‘-’ in 2019 and her combination of theatrical drama and pop-rock/emo can hit like a truck. And even though this isn’t the song I think about when I think of Jetty Bones. Still one of their best though, still hits, still wonderfully theatrical and desperate.

**qazz23** (10): like the bright synth sounds (there's even 🎷!) and this is quite catchy - one of my favorite debuts from last year

**ReallyCreative** (10): come on synth-BOP

**rslashpoopheads** (10): carly rae jepsen

**seanderlust** (10): go OFF SAXOPHONE!!!!! this is so fun and cute and charming that i'm honestly not sure why it isn't a bigger hit. maybe it's that the lyrics are lowkey kind of sad?

**steelstepladder** (10): I'd like one of my charity submissions to escape day 1 please and thank you

**welcome2thejam** (10): Alright Carly you can stop the act we know its you, you didn't even change the hair color for gods sake

**celladonn** (9): One of last year's most underrated albums for sure

**CrimsonROSET** (9): wait this is so good? one of my faves discoveries

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): When this started I instantly reached to copy and paste the comment I’ve been using for all of the faceless synthpop songs submitted but tbh this slays actually, good job to this artist.

**TiltControls** (9): This is a ton of fun and has been growing on me since I first heard it.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): sounds like a modern cindi lauper song

**afs** (8.5): cute synthwork

**jman457** (8.5): just nostalgic fun

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Kinda gives me CRJ vibes

**PAHC** (8.5): girl sounds like discount chvrches but this is great

**synyyy** (8.5): popheads will eat this one up won't they

**thedoctordances1940** (8.3): there's absolutely nothing special about this but i'll continue to just eat this sound up

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): breezy little bop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a little basic but I’m enjoying it quite a lot. Very on brand for me.

**gwykiki** (8): i'm still pro the 80s revival

**ImADudeDuh** (8): fun

**imbaby122** (8): so much synth pop in this lineup and you know i’ll eat it up every time.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This is such a dope song. The little synth motif during the song reminds me of the Censored Song by jacksfilms for some reason.

**SmileAndTears** (8): not bad but not as punchy and colorful as the best 80s throwbacks

**throwaway-7650** (8): @ BETTY JONES YOU'RE BONES.

**Uberpigeon** (8): jetty boner

**vayyiqra** (8): nice new wave-ish song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Yes this sounds very Popheads-core

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is cute!

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): snail mail if she went pop

**shipperondeck** (7.6): this is pretty fun actually

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**awry** (7.2): it's wild how you can tell that this was inspired by emotion side b, even though emotion side b was simply just an ep with a couple of 80s inspired pop songs... such a short collection of songs with a rather non-specific theme shouldn't have a vibe as tangible as it does, and yet the first thing i thought when i heard this song was "omg emotion side c"

**DirtyRat583** (7.1): a cool little indie pop song, cant hate it TOO much

**itsabop** (7): Sax really makes it

**ricki** (7): https://i.imgur.com/M5rHuVG.png

**slimboyfriend** (7): it’s like she has all the poppiness of CRJ and the vocals of Allie X but doesn’t quite know how to put them together

**2dina3dworld** (6.8): this is very 2010s CRJ, Robyn-esque synthpop. I don’t care if it’s from 2021, it’s like their little sister

**babadork** (5.9): I like it, but I think it’s missing one more element to be really good.

**WaneLietoc** (5.1): yeah sure. i do like that there's a new type of pop star who wears blazers and dances. modern feminist.

**Stryxen** (5): what i feel about this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its giving target back to school fashion commercial music

**starla\_** (4.5): eh this is okay

**apatel27** (3.8): Nothing original about the song

**skargardin** (7): Somehow this song had completely managed to escape me until this rate. I don't mind this at all even though it's not my favourite out of the Fetty Wap songs I've heard. One thing you can't deny is that this is catchy as hell. /u/Roxieloxie

**CarlieScion** (5): its no trap queen

---

**akanewasright** (10): THE BEST SONG TO EVER EXIST OMGGGGG

**bridgemoney** (10): Changed the game.

**camerinian** (10): crazy how Fetty Wap started and ended an entire era of pop rap entirely by himself

**celladonn** (10): This is so damn fun

**cremeebrulee** (10): YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÁAAAAAA BABY

**CrimsonROSET** (10): FETTY WAP YOU’LL FOREVER BE FAMOUS

**flavasavavandal** (10): Man 2015 was just fucking stacked, can we go back

**frogaranaman** (10): this is one of the greatest songs of all time

**ignitethephoenix** (10): freshman year college vibes DON’T ROB THIS BECAUSE ITS A MAN THAT RAPS

**Roxieloxie** (10): im very well aware that sending a trap pop song to a popheads rate was a death sentence especially considering that my original submission arguably could've won, but man. I've been trying to get a rate with this song in it passed for like 2 years but i've seen the metrics for the grab bags that have been sent in and yall really dont want that! I already know this is gonna be day 1, undeservedly, im so sorry that yall were crying to lana or whatever summer 2015 instead of throwing ass to this. Anyway can we get this in another rate so it can do better.

**steelstepladder** (10): Fetty Wap had 2015 in his HAND

**WaneLietoc** (10): i knew a bro who made fetty wap his life and integrated 1738 into everything; down to an in n out order. still a great bop.

**xavieryes** (10): a classic

**itsabop** (9): Who can forget this, I absolutely loved dancing to this while drunk a few years back

**MassiveThief** (9): violently 2015

**pig-serpent** (9): Fetty Wap was the first trap artist I got into, and he made me understand the appeal of the upbeat, dancier side of the genre, which led to me later getting into the moodier stuff. It pains me that he fell off like crazy after 2015.

**runaway3212** (9): Fetty actually has such a nice voice

**seanderlust** (8.7): I got this soda

**starla\_** (8.5): this is the better Fetty Wap hit

**wavingwolves** (8.1): she's no trap queen but she's pretty still...

**anothertown** (8): i got a glock in my rawri xD

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): 2015 feels about 25 years ago at this point…

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this classic, the absolute HOLD it had on frat bros everywhere

**ReallyCreative** (8): very clearly dated but in a non-derogatory way

**TiltControls** (8): Gotta complete the number chain

**welcome2thejam** (8): Missed the meteoric rise & fall of Fetty Wap, but I get the appeal from this

**imbaby122** (7.5): 1738 is my angel number.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): put me in the section with the rest of the comments referencing the song title (wbk raters have no originality so)

**slimboyfriend** (7.3): omg I never knew this song had a name

**jman457** (7.2): it was crazy how ferry wap was everywhere in 2015 and dropped completely from public conscience almost immediately

**1998tweety** (7): idk what to say the chorus bops hard despite the lyrics

**afs** (7): wetty fap

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): kinda funny how fetty wap was everywhere for like a few months and then randomly wasn't

**hikk** (7): 2015core pop rap is fun

**jsonphile** (7): there’s something so strangely cute about the line “she walk past I press rewind to see that ass one more time”

**PAHC** (7): fetty wap knew his way around a hook in 2015

**vayyiqra** (7): lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I guess it’s entertaining to listen to?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.7): AYE, I GOT A GLOCK IN MY ‘RARI

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): pretend there's a 2nd decimal place with a 9 here

**ricki** (6.7): 9

**babadork** (6.5): Fetty Wap’s contribution is great, but each Remy Boy did not need his own verse.

**DirtyRat583** (6.5): this song is so 2015 - aka its not very good

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): this song just reminded me I'm moving back to college this week

**DefaultPophead** (6): [.79]

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): 7 9

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I actually like Fetty Wap's parts but the feature was unnecessary

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): They really wasted this beat on this corny Saturday Night Live original song sounding delivery! Where’s Ego Nwodim to whip these boys into shape?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i have to admit i have never heard this song outside of the chorus before 😭

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): this is a good beat but I don’t really enjoy the rapping - it doesn’t really have that much dynamic. Also Fetty Wap is very hit or miss

**awry** (4): you can tell i'm not straight bc my first thought was "charli would eat this beat up"

**Stryxen** (4): a random mashup of this was one of my most played songs on spotify in 2016. what was that about

**BasedButta** (3): his singing is funny tho i like it

**rslashpoopheads** (3): what happened to him

**yearofthesoup** (3): the hey what's up hello song was marginally better but they're both bad lmao fetty deserves one hit wonder status

**synyyy** (1): this is not nice

**skargardin** (10): I was pretty shocked by this placement, I thought it was a Day 3 lock? It seems like some of you want this to stay in the past. I for one still love Avril's hits and this is no exception, an instant rush of serotonin. Apparently we hate having fun around here! Submitted by u/akanewasright

**CarlieScion** (1): oh my god I hate this

---

**1998tweety** (10): when I was a kid I didn't like her cheating on her partner, but now its a slut bop

**akanewasright** (10): The way early 10s Avril Lavigne was a defining pop star for me

**astrologicalangelel** (10): certified classic

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is REAL rock music. The male gender should take note.

**hikk** (10): this is just so fun

**ignitethephoenix** (10): honestly such a classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song only makes me think of this Robin Skouteris mashup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA9u6jq3nSI

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Why haven’t we rated more albums from her?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): wtf do you mean "all my life I've been good", wasn't your entire career built on being a rebel???

**rslashpoopheads** (10): she said what she had to

**runaway3212** (10): Iconic legend we forgive you for your last album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i will never apologize for being emo

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): literally changed lives

**throwaway-7650** (10): this hell is a good song y'all are tasteless af

**Uberpigeon** (10): she wasnt allowed to say fuck but she made a bop anyway

**xavieryes** (10): one of the best #11 peakers of all time

**BasedButta** (9): aaaaah why do i always fall for this kind of song

**CrimsonROSET** (9): avril sweetie you have not been good all your life

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Wish she could still make music this good

**itsabop** (9): What the bop

**plastichaxan** (9): classique

**NecroDolphinn** (8.5): Is this song objectively that amazing? No. Do I hear the opening synth stabs and almost start crying? Yes.

**nt96** (8.5): Me looking at this chaotic playlist

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): pure nostalgia

**TiltControls** (8.5): I don't think it matches up to her 2000s era tracks, but it's still probably one of her best of the next decade

**jman457** (8.3): a big “guilty pleasure” song

**afs** (8): this was the pioneering gaslighting girlboss

**anothertown** (8): i kept thinking we rated this already but i think i've just seen it as a reveal transition song 2 or 3 times lol

**DirtyRat583** (8): i have a nostalgia for this song that forces me to give it a good song even if it isnt THAT good

**fadedblue09** (8): one of the two gold songs on this snoozefest album. Also "love hurts whether it's right or wrong" is the peak of her songwriting

**imtotallyfine\_jpg** (8): Remember back in 2011 when I used to listen to this all the time as a preteen and fantasizing about my rebellious teenage phase

**ricki** (8): the scene where avril leaves the store without paying and the guy has to pay for her almost turned my 11 year old self into a meninist

**Roxieloxie** (8): akane said i will dark horse my way into top 5 of this rate and what about it

**synyyy** (8): shit avril don't cuss kids may be watching you

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): Its ‘Girlfriend’ if you took all of the charm out of it and also had Avril sing the first verse at gunpoint but idk I kinda like it :))))

**seanderlust** (7.5): https://twitter.com/catchfireswift/status/1292460958858776580

**cremeebrulee** (7): my reaction when this song makes top 5:

**DefaultPophead** (7): There isn't many Avril songs I can tolerate, but I like this one.

**imbaby122** (7): it really was just hit after hit for avril back in the day. but with the nostalgia lens off this is the song where avril started to lose her cool factor.

**lagozzino** (7): I always expect this song to rock harder than it does. I'd love to hear it with some Love Sux style heavier guitars and drumming.

**pig-serpent** (7): Music for destroying carnival game booths to.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The Panty & Stocking AMV for this song will never not be iconic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6HXriudHKY)

**ReallyCreative** (7): literally on the knife's edge of camp and cringe, ultimately a bop but she was TWENTY SIX when this was released....girl could rent a whole car and we got this....

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Every day I thank God that he didn’t make an emo during the early 2000s… So many things I would have regretted

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): i mean at least it's better than Girlfriend even if every electropop song from that time hasn't aged the best

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): sounds like the kidz bop version of itself

**wavingwolves** (6.1): thinking about this avril lavigne fan that was my crush for literal years and how i used to stalk her twitter all the time around the release of this album... hope she's well...

**awry** (6): there's something insanely satisfying in that crystal clean autotuned vocal run in the chorus... caroline polachek-esque should i say

**frogaranaman** (6): why does this instrumental make me feel like I'm listening to a nursery rhyme

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (6): Avril isn't terrible but she also isn't so good that she deserves all this reappraisal she's been getting

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): i've heard barely anything from avril but this is cute

**PAHC** (6): the yassification of miss avril lavigne

**shipperondeck** (6): i never really liked her music when i was younger but i thought she was cool. (my parents didnt let me listen to this one tho bc, yk, "hell")

**babadork** (5.5): Avril looks really cute in glasses. That’s all I got.

**qazz23** (5): feels kinda generic, not as good as her other hits

**yearofthesoup** (5): I always remember this song being way worse idk I think I'm just weirded out by proto- hyperpop Avril

**WaneLietoc** (4.2): YOU DONT NEED TO BE CRAZY PLEASE JUST COME HOME AVRIL WE STILL LOVE YOU STOP DRIVING LIKE THAT NONONONONONONONONNO

**jsonphile** (4): this song is one of those songs that if I’m in the exact right mood it’s a total bop, but otherwise it’s incredibly irritating and stupid. I like a lot of Abril Lavigne songs, but she has many songs like this, including Hello Kitty, Girlfriend, and (I’m sorry) Sk8er Boi

**Stryxen** (4): the high energy moments fall completely flat for me but the verses have potential. it’s like listening to a really jarring mashup

**apatel27** (3.1): Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss

**Gonza\_90** (3): My thoughts exactly

**steelstepladder** (3): The line from this to Hello Kitty is shorter than you'd think

**vayyiqra** (3): Avril's music is best left as nostalgia from the past for me

**2dina3dworld** (2): this was step one towards her releasing Hello Kitty and I will not hear differently

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): "sorry i ruined our relationship, i just felt like it"

**starla\_** (1): I hate this song, it's like Girlfriend if it was bad

**CarlieScion** (3): I’m so sorry sapphire but this is bad

---

**anothertown** (10): one of my favorite missy elliott joints that are outside of her own discography, just iconic

**MrMoodle** (10): i’ve heard like two solo mya songs and both of them are like two of the best songs i’ve ever heard and then i just stopped listening there

**nt96** (10): This song is like…WO! This woman's talent is truly on another level and is one of the very few dancers who can go toe to toe with Janet Jackson. The fact that she doesn't get the same recognition as her contemporaries is simply unfathomable. We need a Mya rate NOW!

**ReallyCreative** (10): we really had no idea what we had back on this era of dominant poppy R+B, the early 2000s are so slept on

**WaneLietoc** (10): she does a tap dance in the middle for america. she looks like orville peck reclaiming him from sub pop. rock on mya.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Honestly, I believe her

**qazz23** (9): nice almost forgotten about '00s bop... this song is like... wo!

**shipperondeck** (9): always loved how she said wo

**steelstepladder** (9): pronouncing Mya like a 20's gangster

**jsonphile** (8.5): for some reason I like every part of this song except the “wo”

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.4): Excellent groove from Missy Elliott here, gotta love the random-as-shit tap dancing breakdown in the music video

**skargardin** (10): I will always have a soft spot for the Evanescence classiques and this is no exception. Evanescence kind of defined my middle-school years as an angsty teenager. As such, I'm sad to see this is a somewhat low but respectable Day 2 position. Submitted by u/seanderlust

**CarlieScion** (5): kinda boring as far as evanescence songs go

---

**1998tweety** (10): omg this goes OFF

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Bring back yassified nu-metal.

**itsabop** (10): Call me when you're slaying

**lagozzino** (10): Controversial opinion maybe but this is their best single. Their first album is still their strongest, but this one song owns my ass for life.

**nt96** (10): my inner emo's pussy is throbbing erratically

**plastichaxan** (10): a classic that will be robbed i can feel it

**ReallyCreative** (10): YASSSSS

**seanderlust** (10): this is the song that kicked off a serious evanescence/emo rock phase for me in high school. when i think of songs that perfectly portray righteous anger, i think this. the bassline is delicious, amy sounds incredible, this is honestly one of my favorite all-time songs. i know this would inevitably go out day 1, maybe early day 2 and i have made peace with that. stream dynasty by rina sawayama.

**TiltControls** (10): If I was less lame and didn't 11 my own submission this probably would've gotten it. Great amount of passion behind the track and just a ton of fun to fake belt to

**WaneLietoc** (10): seems like a hotel lobby background winner

**xavieryes** (10): ironically i'm rating this song while drinking but still fantastic and a classic

**steelstepladder** (9.5): Weird Blondie/Conan Gray mashup but I'm here for it

**afs** (9): this makes me feel like a 9 year old

**anothertown** (9): "Hey Ebony!" shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Draco Malfoy! "What’s up Draco?" I asked. "Nothing." he said shyly.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the fact we’ve rated a full evanescence album will never not be funny to me

**jsonphile** (9): I never had an edgy emo phase in middle school but listening to this makes me nostalgic for that phase of my life that never actually existed

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Omg Amy Lee has a Soul Voice© too???

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.8): such an amazing track

**BasedButta** (8.5): This song sent me on a trip I can’t believe I still enjoy them this much after all these years

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Suddenly, I'm back in primary school.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): her voice always is so good

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I never thought I’d see the day when I recognize an Evanesence song as unironically good

**starla\_** (8.5): 12 year old me was belting this out

**synyyy** (8.5): nice work I guess

**ImADudeDuh** (8): not one of their best but its good

**pig-serpent** (8): A solid example of what made Evanescence, even if this was never my favorite of their catalog. The bridge is a bit too "going under" and it feels like they calmed down just a little too much.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): conspiracy time: this song and why’d you only call me when you’re high by arctic monkeys are two different perspectives of the same incident

**jman457** (7.7): Kelly Clarkson if she was yassim-ified

**imbaby122** (7.5): amy lee you will always be famous.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The parts of this where the electric guitar isn’t playing are so good

**PAHC** (7): shes christina aguileraing everywhere!!!

**yearofthesoup** (7): the vocals, the empowerment wauw

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): yass

**awry** (6): call me beep me if you ever loved me :(

**qazz23** (6): this isn't terrible as far as butt-rock goes

**ricki** (6): selena gomez outdid

**rslashpoopheads** (6): one of the Evanescence songs of all time

**wavingwolves** (6): the prequel of why'd you only call me when you're high by arctic monkeys

**welcome2thejam** (6): Even grew up when this band got big, but doing the k-pop rates rewired my brain so much that my first reaction was "oh hey, proto-Dreamcatcher"

**DaHumanTorch** (5.3): why did she sound like fergie for the first 15 seconds

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): bring me to life slaps but this is just meh

**frogaranaman** (5): sounds like an Evanescence song!

**thedoctordances1940** (4.4): transitions don't really work well and just kinda feels toothless

**camerinian** (4): …maybe we don't actually need that 2000s rock revival

**runaway3212** (4): honestly I kinda hate evanescence

**vayyiqra** (4): Not one of my faves by them

**Stryxen** (3): not for me. do not like the vocals and the instrumental is kinda dull

**apatel27** (2.6): Never had an emo phase so no emotional attachment to this song

**gwykiki** (2): sorry

**Uberpigeon** (2): i hate this genre

**skargardin** (9): I had been meaning to check out Jon's album from last year but never got around to it, so I was happy to discover this during the rate, it's so much fun! I definitely have to check out the album at some point. Submitted by u/babadork

**CarlieScion** (8): this guys took some notes from Prince lmao dfknjfs

---

**babadork** (11): His album was one of my favorites from last year. Batiste is very gifted at blending genres, and I think he makes more old-school music very accessible even for someone that doesn’t have a lot of experience listening to those styles. I’m still not sure that “I Need You” wasn’t the single that would fit better with popheads.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): vote for soultimate

**jsonphile** (10): this man is a national treasure. I just love seeing someone as passionate as he is about music, and this song, like many on his Grammy award winning album, is an absolute bop

**Roxieloxie** (10): hold on this is really good :listening:

**xavieryes** (10): strong 11 contender

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): GRAMMY-winning Jon Batiste does it again.

**gwykiki** (9.4): oh this is fun

**WaneLietoc** (9.1): wanna have a bbq and do backflips to this. that CRAZY jon batiste fella is at it agaiN! he needs to bring that low end to the colbert late show.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): aoty

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Lizzo is so pissed off she didn’t write this first

**starla\_** (8.5): I haven't actually heard anything from this album before but I really like this

**Stryxen** (8.5): it sounds so much like car advert music (not a bad thing) . actually it works here very well. dancing!

**TiltControls** (8.2): I still need to check out his stuff and this is making a great case for it

**1998tweety** (8): maybe he did deserve those Grammys

**camerinian** (8): easily the best song in this rate that works despite sounding like a JCPenney commercial soundtrack

**fadedblue09** (8): Tbh I wish I liked this more but it's a soulful, danceable bop

**frogaranaman** (8): yeah, I get why he won the Grammy

**qazz23** (8): nice classic soul and funk sound

**runaway3212** (8): love the marvin gaye energy here

**synyyy** (8): my grammy would listen to this, not the grammys

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): my mom actually sent me the music video to this one once and told me how much she enjoyed it. i never would’ve expected to see this winning an aoty grammy 4 months later

**vayyiqra** (8): This is good in fact

**welcome2thejam** (8): This is a sparkling water commercial

**afs** (7.5): CAN'T STOP THE FEELING!

**imbaby122** (7.5): after watching the grammys let me just say that if jon batiste wasn’t such a bundle of joy, gratitude, and kindness, this song wouldn’t land for me.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): grammy discourse aside, this song kinda sounds like clothing store commercial music but it's still kind of a bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Definitely love the mix of classic funk/soul with the trap drums.

**ReallyCreative** (7): not the best from this album but it's fun

**shipperondeck** (7): get dowwwwwwn together

**throwaway-7650** (7): an artist that has more grammy awards than BTS

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This sounds so… plain. Idk what else to say. Good on Jon Batiste though, I always had a soft spot for him

**Verrem** (7): bass go brrr

**DirtyRat583** (6.8): grammys-core

**jman457** (6.8): I feel would like this better if he didn’t just star in an Amazon commercial

**ricki** (6.5): this sounds like it would have killed it in the despicable me soundtrack

**lagozzino** (6): This would be a top tier song with a better singer on it

**seanderlust** (6): who left the comment on genius highlighting the start of the refrain with "what does this mean?" wym girl aren't you supposed to know!!!

**slimboyfriend** (6): Too disney-fied for my taste

**PAHC** (5.5): its insane they gave a grammy for happy 7 years later

**awry** (5): this is all a matter of personal taste but i really dislike such clean production on a motown/soul type song. it reminds me of meghan trainor lmao

**MrMoodle** (5): this definitely has grammy-winning vibes but i’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not

**pig-serpent** (4): This does nothing for me.

**yearofthesoup** (4): why does this man exclusively make music for old navy commercials

**BasedButta** (3): i respect this style, but this one is just too noisy without a real verse

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): It’s like if Blurred Lines traded most of it’s boppiness for ethical lyrics. I’m sorry.

**SmileAndTears** (3): Oh I've heard this in an ad before... sorry i have nothing nice to say about this song

**skargardin** (7): This song unfortunately kind of blended together with the rest of the rate for me. But on relisten I fear like I might've been wrong to overlook it. Sure it doesn't exactly thread any new ground as far as indierock goes, but this is excellently produced and paints a really soft soundscape. I could see myself returning to this in the future Submitted by /u/welcome2thejam 

---

**jman457** (10): just pure indierock bliss

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): crying

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh this is GOOD good

**throwaway-7650** (10): /me sobs :sob: :zsob: :soblove:

**welcome2thejam** (10): I'm a simple man. I see an Asian band put out actually fun dream pop that activates the 7/4 Shoreline loving part of my brain that always makes me imagine myself coasting down the highway with the windows down and breathtaking views around every corner, and I submit it to a rate so I can give it a high score. See? Simple. I put this on during a morning flight right when we took off, and maybe it was the two hours of sleep talking, but I def cried a little bit

**starla\_** (9.9): I love this

**camerinian** (9.5): this is why I love the charity rates. I might never have discovered this band but now I'm so excited to hear what else these guys have. Whoever submitted this should be very proud

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): devoured

**wavingwolves** (9.5): oh this is great... thank yew @ submitter

**1998tweety** (9): this is nice

**DefaultPophead** (9): Love another hidden gem!

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (9): yay good indie pop shit

**NecroDolphinn** (9): This song is beautiful and energetic and wow.

**Stryxen** (9): awesome discovery

**afs** (8.5): you've heard of crying... now get ready for SOBS?

**MassiveThief** (8.5): this is great!

**PAHC** (8.5): banger. love the lofi production and the chord progression on the chorus is so good

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I feel like I’m doing college radio again

**awry** (8): beautiful, soft sound

**frogaranaman** (8): this is me bait

**ignitethephoenix** (8): oh this is nice, shout out to whoever picked this

**qazz23** (8): nice dreamy and jangly feel

**synyyy** (8): this is also ok

**vayyiqra** (8): really nice vibes

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Omg more viiiiiibes (that sounds sarcastic but I honestly really like this)

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): you mean like janky cel-shaded 3d animations?

**imbaby122** (7.5): ooooo those last 30 seconds!!! very niceee! love a good indie pop/rock tune.

**plastichaxan** (7.5): this will definitely grow on me but for now it is what it is

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): neato

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Very pleasant!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): perhaps a bit slay maybe i can get into this

**steelstepladder** (7): I can see this growing on me but for right now it's a cute 7

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): this is just about the best a song can be without me thinking it's good enough to listen to in my own time (aka a 7). almost want to raise the score .1 for this but i'm feeling petty right now and there are other songs that deserve my points more

**TiltControls** (6.7): It's nice. There are a few cool moments (especially the end) but I wish it had more.

**WaneLietoc** (5.4): yeah cool fits and vid, decent execution of the washed out captured tracks post-mac sound, but it ain't really my thing. lost half a point for that amoeba bag NO STOP.

**runaway3212** (5): not every song in this run could be a hit

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): The cover art for this is super cute!

**pig-serpent** (3.5): That bridge is good but it’s too late in a boring song for me to care.

**CarlieScion** (9): v good and vibes

**skargardin** (9): This is giving very Europe radio-core and I'm not mad at it. Purple Disco Machine is so good at distilling the tried-and-true radio-ready pop formula and perfecting it with just the right amount of production flair. Sophie Scott of indie-pop band Sophie and the Giants does a great job here with the vocals as well. This is simply a good time and all-around megabop submitted by u/frogaranaman

---

**frogaranaman** (11): bear bars love this song and for that I am thankful

**Roxieloxie** (11): i very vividly remember my friend messaging me one night where he was very drunk and i was very much going through it and telling me to listen to this song and I didnt have the energy to convey to a non sober person that I wanted nothing else but to cry so I just did and you know what, I really really enjoyed it. I told him i'd listen to the album in full and never did! so hopefully giving a good score makes up for that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2gA_kWieYE

**steelstepladder** (10): BOPOLINA!!!

**TiltControls** (10): Somehow this completely passed me by given the number of plays its got on Spotify, but I've been addicted to this track since first hearing it.

**xavieryes** (10): (very creative comment incoming) i'm hypnotized by this song

**camerinian** (9): this gives me such warm fuzziness that I honestly wasn't sure this type of disco pop could do for me anymore, holy crap

**jsonphile** (9): any song that reminds me of Florence and the machine is a win for me

**SmileAndTears** (9): Oh? mega bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is very nice

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): this is a nice find!

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**afs** (8): is the cover art purple disco machine

**fadedblue09** (8): Generic but for some reason it clicked with me

**imbaby122** (8): bruh i’m running out of ways to compliment disco songs without using the word groovy 😿

**qazz23** (8): nice synthpop sound, but needs a bit more to stand out

**synyyy** (8): that cover art is not a good look bestie

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): How is this so big and I haven't heard it before?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I usually find producer driven EDM pop to be a little bit faceless, but here there’s no but actually I still have that problem. Sounds cute though.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.3): Pretty decent, though I feel like the production could’ve been amped up just a little bit more, maybe add some crash cymbals or something.

**BasedButta** (7): sure

**PAHC** (7): p boppy, like the funky guitar quite a bit

**rslashpoopheads** (7): neat

**Stryxen** (7): a significant slay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): technically yes this is good but it’s missing something to me that makes it really stand out from the rest

**awry** (6.5): i like the vibe but without the vocals, this would sound like royalty-free music

**starla\_** (6.4): this has potential to be a banger but unfortunately remains a bop

**CrimsonROSET** (6): oooooh i’m blinded by the light

**throwaway-7650** (6): not the EDM/nugu vocalist I'd submit

**WaneLietoc** (6): not as good as rihanna's diamonds but I like the Just Dance energy here

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Where is the disco??

**welcome2thejam** (5): Pretty okay retro bop

**pig-serpent** (3): I love the first 10 seconds but everything after that is whatever.

I didn't see much discussion on this at all during the rate, which may be why it ends up with a respectable Day 2 position despite being an absolute BANGER that deserved a little more, in my opinion. Maybe it really was just okay, okay. Submitted by u/lagozzino

**CarlieScion** (6): okay!

**lagozzino** (11): My submission for this rate and my anthem for 2022. In another universe "I'm the happiest sad girl you'll ever meet" is used as a quote in everyone's tumblr bios.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.9): Sorry, did I just hear her say “the floor is lava?”

**TiltControls** (7.5): Didn't love most of the album, but this was one of the better tracks for sure (and Beside Myself which is my SOTY so far)

**2dina3dworld** (7.3): fitting title

**Gonza\_90** (7): The name fits perfectly

**PAHC** (7): the elongated "f" on "knife" is insufferable but the production is neat

**pig-serpent** (7): I love how upbeat this song is with those guitar stabs, but I have no idea why Lights is singing like that because she sounds so much worse than she used to so I’m knocking a few points off.

**qazz23** (7): not much stands out from similar electropop sounds, i guess this is just "okay" (sorry)

**jman457** (6.7): catchy chorus, but i cringed at the floor is lava line

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): ooo she set herself up for the people who aren’t impressed by this song

**ricki** (6.5): i love the fault in our stars

**anothertown** (6): dull and who oked (lol) this chorus

**awry** (6): this song is okay, okay?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Decent Decent.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): okay is about right

**DefaultPophead** (6): Very fueled-by-ramen-core in ways that are both fun and unflattering.

**shipperondeck** (6): okay i guess (sorry)

**WaneLietoc** (5.4): pretty chill tbh needs some more throbbing bass though none of this airtight nonsense!

**starla\_** (5.1): something about Lights has never really clicked with me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): this chorus is such nothingness

**camerinian** (2): getting a lot of "the label would like you to make this more TikTok-ready" energy from this one

**skargardin** (9): This is another one of my favourite discoveries in the entire rate. I was pretty shocked to see  that they only had around 600 monthly listeners on Spotify, so if you liked what you heard here, go give them a stream and support! Submitted by u/ghost-quartet

**celladonn** (11): omg poly anthem... this is an absolute bop and my favourite new discovery of the rate so it gets my 11

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Maybe it’s tacky to 11 my own submission but w/e. I keep going “maybe I overrated this, maybe people won’t like this and I should have sent something else” but then I get halfway through the rap verse and I lose my absolute mind

**BasedButta** (10): pretty good disco!!! and this time i really like the lyrics too! (this means more in a rate such as this, where i feel like most songs are here because of the lyrics)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Open communication is sexy! Many are saying this!

**Gonza\_90** (10): Great discovery

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): The production, the songwriting, the vocals, the 80s synth-pop vibes… absolutely immaculate. THIS is how you do modern-day 80s pop.

**CarlieScion** (10): slay!

**skargardin** (9): Okay this is absolutely beautiful, as so many of you have already stated, she's definitely mother for this. Submitted by u/qazz23

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): whoever sent this in you have amazing taste…kadhja bonet is so underrated!!

**MrMoodle** (10): SUCH an awesome discovery thank you to whoever submitted this

**qazz23** (10): This is my submission - I really like the retro-soul/funk and psychedelic sound of this track. Her beautiful vocals and classy arrangements along with the harmonies are a nice touch. Childqueen was one of my favorite albums of 2018.

**ReallyCreative** (10): more like Mother Most Certainly oh my GOD

**starla\_** (10): incredible, show-stopping, etc, complete bliss

**welcome2thejam** (10): Fun discovery, sick jams, and love that held note going into an incredible back third. Soothes my ears.

**WaneLietoc** (9.4): it says there's a tape option on the audio but they never did one?? what. anyways, huge dunk on the "vibe" sound that Captured Tracks/Mild High Club toyed with. Stakes are smoother here. It all feels too good to be true that Fat Possum put this out and she's on Ninja Tune with PVA & BCNR.

**akanewasright** (9): more like mother DEFINITELY

**frogaranaman** (9): would hear this while I'm drinking a $17 cocktail at a Brooklyn speakeasy

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Kinda wild that one of the first rate ideas I pitched was Lianne La Havas vs. We Are KING vs. Kadhja Bonet, I was so ahead of my time

**throwaway-7650** (9): SHE SWAM IN THE MOTHER LAKE... maybe

**vayyiqra** (9): I love funk music

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.8): I love the city pop vibes on this one. Could’ve used more string and brass arrangements though.

**awry** (8.5): love this groove and the harmonies. there's no maybe, miss kadhja - you're definitely mother.

**shipperondeck** (8.3): beautiful

**wavingwolves** (8.1): oh wow i love this... thanks to whoever submitted it!!!!!

**DefaultPophead** (8): Maybe people will have some sense and get this to day 3!

**fadedblue09** (8): I'm not sure what this song is for but it sounds sweet

**just\_thonking** (8): Indecisive stans be like

**plastichaxan** (8): what she served tbh

**Roxieloxie** (8): mother maybe more like zoe kravitz aunt

**slimboyfriend** (8): I thought this song was actually from like 1974

**SmileAndTears** (8): she was indeed mother for this

**1998tweety** (7.5): so mother for this

**BasedButta** (7.5): pleasant

**celladonn** (7.5): I would not have guessed this came out in 2018, has a much older vibe

**synyyy** (7.5): mother come pick me up im sleepy

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): how many mother lake jokes is there going to be

**DirtyRat583** (7.2): wait this is sort of a slay

**afs** (7): mommy perhaps

**anothertown** (7): this opened strongly but lost steam for me

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): nice and smooth, nothing more nothing less

**imbaby122** (7): vibes.

**PAHC** (7): one minute without saying mother challenge

**ricki** (7): when idk if my fave is slaying or not

**rslashpoopheads** (7): okayy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): how many comments for this will just be MOTHER!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Ooo very retro

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I’m sorry I can tell this is well made and written but I’m just kinda bored.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): huh!

**TiltControls** (5.5): Picked up steam in the end, but I still couldn't really get drawn into it. Though I'm interested to check out the rest of their stuff

**runaway3212** (3): omfg I hate her voice

**CarlieScion** (10): now why did everyone suddenly tank this

**skargardin** (10): The one time we're rating Drake and it happens to be one of his in my opinion standout and best songs, we decide to tank it, good job popheads! For the last part of the rate I actually got worried that it would tank all the way into day 1 but thank god the latter ballots showed some taste and pushed it back into the upper 30s. Doesn't make it any less of a robbery but still. Submitted by u/MoonlightByWindow

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is one of three good Drake songs

**agentofscranton** (10): why would he not choose to slay like this on a daily basis

**akanewasright** (10): Drake can serve sometimes, as a treat

**cremeebrulee** (10): we gotta start campaigning this for songeniality NOW

**CrimsonROSET** (10): fuck y’all this is great!! None of this ‘only like the paramore cover’ bullshit own up to liking this!

**frogaranaman** (10): this was his coming out song actually

**gwykiki** (10): unfortunately drathan did well with this one

**ignitethephoenix** (10): going to ignore the intro redo, and remember that this is one of Drake’s best songs

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): never would have thought that i’d send a DRAKE song to charity lmfao but well. it’s a total smash what can i say

**nootnoot781** (10): sorry x

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): A little fruity…

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): I'm a basic bitch

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I wish honestly, nevermind was just this song 14 times over

**ricki** (10): as someone that spent their formative years falling in love with any guy online that showed one bit of human decency towards me, the phrase “passionate from miles away” hits a little too close to home

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i am transported into a different dimension for 4 minutes every time i listen to this song

**throwaway-7650** (10): and the girl with basket of fruit in question? GUCCI

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes Drake has made good songs before

**wavingwolves** (10): if you get it you get if you don't get it you don't get it

**welcome2thejam** (10): When Drake's on, he's on. Maybe the ultimate "vibes 🌊 🌊 🌊" song

**apatel27** (9.9): Drake at his best

**runaway3212** (9.5): I get why drake wants to restart this song cause it's fawking amazing

**slimboyfriend** (9.2): back when Drake didn’t wanna waste a good beat

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): outsold the real fruit

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): Truthfully, Bleach

**celladonn** (9): Much as it pains me to give Drake a good score this is very nice

**Gonza\_90** (9): Drake can be good when he tries

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (9): the only good Drake song

**TiltControls** (8.7): Drake has released a ton of forgettable songs over his recent career, but this is definitely not one of them

**DirtyRat583** (8.1): unironically one of drakes best songs

**starla\_** (8.1): stream yaeji

**afs** (8): honestly the intro was better than all his later stuff sans currents' creaky beat

**ImADudeDuh** (8): really did not need that intro, but a good drake song

**jman457** (8): one of a handful of good drake songs

**NecroDolphinn** (8): I hate how much I love this song

**synyyy** (8): honestly... you know the rest

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This could have been a masterpiece without any of the skit shit but Drake's ego was determined to not let that happen

**1998tweety** (7.5): chill

**PAHC** (7.5): this was my first ever drake scrobble. not worth it but still good

**anothertown** (7): turn up the bassoon. i can't hear the bassoon

**camerinian** (7): incredible how this track on Drake's "playlist" project is loaded with one minute of fuckery that's guaranteed to ruin the energy of any other playlist

**rslashpoopheads** (7): maybe lesbians deserve rights after all!

**steelstepladder** (7): There's so much unneeded shit duct-taped to this otherwise great song

**imbaby122** (6.5): ugh this song is actually good. but i cant rate it higher in good conscience because first of all it’s drake and he lowkey always sounds bored and second of all my little sister enjoys this song and i don’t trust her taste at all bc she listens to 2 female artists.

**itsabop** (6.5): Not a huge Drake fan, but this one is fine

**jsonphile** (6.5): well this sure is a Drake song

**bridgemoney** (6.2): Hayley Williams did it better.

**fadedblue09** (6): I have no strong feelings on this

**pig-serpent** (6): It's fine. Not his best song but far from his worst.

**SmileAndTears** (6): why does it take a whole MINUTE for the song to start? who forced me to listen to this i just wanna talk

**xavieryes** (6): yep, it's a Drake song.

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): Drake's ability to turn an incredible genre into glorified elevator/on hold music is nothing short of superhuman

**shipperondeck** (5.5): sorry ive seen so many memes of this that it made my opinion of this song go from meh to more meh

**just\_thonking** (5): This sounds.... passionless

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): it's fine

**qazz23** (5): don't care for this, too vibe-y and pointless intro

**awry** (4.5): nothing about drake excites me

**WaneLietoc** (4.2): drake is a nice boy who likes rihanna

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): THIS is the good song on More Life?? I will continue to not listen.

**DefaultPophead** (4): Song is good-ish, but points were deducted for the sheer fact that he's an utter freaking creep that should leave women alone instead of singing about them.

**flavasavavandal** (4): no Drake dont sound too into your music, you wouldn't wanna raise make me do more than nod my head

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): At the end of the day, wherever this places, it still has over a billion streams

**TragicKingdom1** (2.5): possibly my hottest take of all time is that this song is boring as FUCK and it has never once interested me. stream literally any other drake song please

**amr** (1): yaeji better

**BasedButta** (1): this asshole made 7s of decent beat and instantly went THAT’S ENOUGH I DON’T WANNA MAKE MUSIC THAT’S ACTUALLY GOOD NOW DO I? and repeated that shit for the entire song. And in the process tarnished the name of one of the most epic fruits of all time, god damn it

**plastichaxan** (1): i was so bored

**shipperondeck** (11): VOTE BRITISH INVASION RATE SO YOU CAN 11 A SONG FROM RIO TOO

**2dina3dworld** (10): I am an 80s lover

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): I'm just realizing that Duran Duran and Darude(?) (the sandstorm song) are two totally different groups

**qazz23** (10): love that post-punk guitar lick and the bassline too (11 candidate)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): but WHEN are we doing the rio rate we deserve

**vayyiqra** (10): these dudes rock

**WaneLietoc** (10): Duran Duran's Rio is a canonical cokewave classic. yeah they saw David Sylvian and the Japan boys and just stole their look without really understanding what Japan had been building towards. in fact, Tin Drum and Rio are basically just insane inverses of each other--one album is a liminal masterpiece/fever dream, while the other is the greatest set of coke bangers collected on an 80s album. Im glad I paid a $1 for Rio. and this cut def proves me right.

**babadork** (9.7): I never watched the full music video for this song until this rate, and the little clips I’ve seen did not do it justice. It’s much weirder than I was expecting.

**awry** (8.8): male gaze more like male slays!

**afs** (8.5): guys do the new wave rate

**imbaby122** (8.5): this mv made me feel things when i saw it on watchmojo top 10 raunchiest music videos as an 8 year old… like muddy lingerie clad women come on. bisexual awakening. the song is good too i suppose.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): straight music for gay people

**DirtyRat583** (8.4): was the lead vocalist gay? they should have been gay if they werent because straight people have no right making good 80s music like this

**seanderlust** (8.1): where's girls on film passing the bechdel test? where's THAT song???

**1998tweety** (8): the girls are girling (but this time on film)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i can tell this is gonna be robbed because popheads can’t recognize men can make good music too

**DefaultPophead** (8): Great, but I've listened to it too many times and it's not something that gets better every time.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Maybe dads made some points

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Hungry Like the Wolf would have been the 10 if it was here

**jsonphile** (8): it’s no Rio but it’s a fun song

**runaway3212** (8): this song isn't gay but it feels gay

**starla\_** (7.9): it's the male gaze

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.7): nothing defines the words “glitz and glamour” more than this song

**fadedblue09** (7.5): NWG impact?

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): Duran Duran is an alright group.

**itsabop** (7.5): Hungry Like the Wolf outsold this, still a bop tho!

**synyyy** (7.5): this is less duran and more durian

**jman457** (7.1): cute little 80’s song

**just\_thonking** (7): Could do without the annoying intro

**PAHC** (7): see ya later

**pig-serpent** (7): I want this to hit so much harder than it actually does.

**Stryxen** (7): i really like this but it’s a bit too monotonous for its score to be any higher

**welcome2thejam** (7): Hey don't pull Dolly by the hair, awful to see charity pick-on-pick violence

**BasedButta** (6.5): exactly how I expected a band called “duran duran” to sound like, it’s almost uncanny

**wavingwolves** (6.5): i like girls and i like films and i also like girls on film...

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is definitely a song that came out in the 80s.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's me. i'm girls.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is very 80s

**TiltControls** (5.5): I don't know if this was in a commercial, or a game, or just kept getting played on radio around here, but something in this song always give me a feeling of overplay. A definite classic though, and if Hungry Like the Wolf or Rio are ever rated both will be great scores from me. Also it's better than the vamps at least

**Roxieloxie** (5): i think the girls should stick to tv

**throwaway-7650** (3): blaming this song for the vamps - girls on TV

**Uberpigeon** (3): i listen to this every day at work and it has not endeared me to it

**SmileAndTears** (2): i am SICK AND TIRED of 80s music. please make it go away

**skargardin** (9): Honestly I forgot to write a comment for this prior to the reveal so I don't have a lot to say here I'm afraid. I will say though that it's a pretty synthy song that I could see growing with relistens. And hey, it managed to make it all the way to the top 30 so that's not something to scoff at. Submitted by u/celladonn

**CarlieScion** (8): more like _8_485 am I right

---

**pig-serpent** (11): The physical and emotional picture this song paints is absolutely beyond words. It's the audio form of a limital space; one that is larger than most and covers an entire town. Despite the soothing and dreamlike textures, you can tell that the narrator is unwelcome here, and much of it comes from the overwhleming sense of regret she has that pours through every note and lyric to this song. There's so much left unsaid, and so much yet to be processed that Hangar demands multiple listenings to dig into the hidden feelings of the narrator, her past, and her relationship with her driver. There's enough depth and conflict present in this song that I have become obsessed with every little detail as if it's a puzzle, and that's why I decided it was my favorite song of 2021 among very tough competition.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): easiest 11 of my life ever, i had never heard this song until a couple months ago but it immediately captivated me with its lyrics and sound. just a magical experience the whole way through

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Is it profiling for me to call this weeb music?

**celladonn** (10): My fave song of last year! I'm so glad to see that there's some other fans of this song on this sub

**DirtyRat583** (10): i feel like i should be crying but i am ascending into heaven instead

**hikk** (10): when i first heard this i was like oh , a cute little synthpop song ... basic, but nice ... but upon revisit after revisit it just kept growing. something about it is so alluring, from the production subtly increasing in intensity to the robotic yet emotional delivery of the lyrics it's just so amazing. "this place is suffocating, i'll still be here in five years ... where i made every mistake" like UGH...........

**runaway3212** (10): I love charity rates for getting to hear amazing stuff like this

**Stryxen** (10): stunning, makes me cry every time. There’s still a lot i haven’t put into words yet.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): this is one of those weird "it's the artist's best song but least representative song of their work" moments. but like this song is absolutely incredible

**throwaway-7650** (10): I swear I've heard this exact song in the TWOE bonus rate

**seanderlust** (9.5): I love how overwhelming the soundscape feels

**TiltControls** (9.5): Probably one of my fave discoveries of the rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): I was very much judging a book by it's cover here, because I was totally expecting this to be some hyperpop song by a boy that looks like finn wolfhard

**wavingwolves** (9.1): this song makes me sooo nostalgic for no reason.. maybe it's just bc i'm a capricorn idk...

**itsabop** (9): There really is something about this

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Pretty!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Future soundtrack to the third act downer montage before the climax of a teen coming-of-age movie

**slimboyfriend** (7.8): Hybrid indie girl and pop punk boy vocals

**amr** (7.5): not what I expected this song to sound like at all based on the title and artist name

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this would be so amazing if the singers voice was just the slightest bit less nasally

**imbaby122** (7.5): solid synth pop tune but can we start writing songs about never wanting to leave your hometown for the attachment issues girlies?

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): wait this is slaying

**PAHC** (7.5): bop but like its not quite great

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's cute but the vocals just aren't clicking

**jman457** (7.4): its alright, somethings off though

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this one goes out to anyone who tanked portal in vgv, keep that energy

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I keep saying people talk about how this was such a great discovery and I’m like y’all really weren’t following Underrated [FRESH] Threads, huh?

**MrMoodle** (7): music for people who think liking stardew valley is a personality trait tbh

**qazz23** (7): pretty decent synthpop, bit too polished and nothing really stood out about it

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): idk the lyrics are cute but the production feels one-note

**1998tweety** (6): this is just talking

**2dina3dworld** (6): can’t believe I’m starting off this rate by being both quirkyphobic AND indiephobic

**anothertown** (6): it's fine

**DefaultPophead** (6): Not bad, but don't really care if I ever hear it again.

**NecroDolphinn** (6): I like the backing beat but the vocals just really annoy me for some reason and bring down the whole song which sucks

**rslashpoopheads** (6): not quite the smash I was expecting from the first 10 seconds

**WaneLietoc** (5.5): im scared of her. anyways filming in suburban strip smalls?! hyperpop is the cinema verite of our time when you think about it

**awry** (5): it's missing a scottish accent and a random V instead of an U in the artist name

**BasedButta** (5): nothing? but okay to listen to ig

**frogaranaman** (5): stream of consciousness tracks don't really do it for me often

**skull\_xbones** (11): awesome song!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): This entire rate was basically a game of “Which song is gonna take away my 11 from Jolene? Turns out the answer is this! This just hits so so many right notes for me. It’s funky. It’s poppy. It’s romantic. She’s a talented, emotive singer. Portuguese is literally the sexiest language you can sing in (at least in my opinion). The little creepy sounding theremin-y synth playing in the background of the chorus is perfect. This song is perfect. Plus, it’s a reminder to everyone who thinks that they’ve already found all their favorite songs of all time: Somewhere in some corner of the world, maybe far from where you are, there exists a song that’s the perfect addition to your list. To me, that’s Abalou.

**xavieryes** (11): ABALOU, ABALOU, SACUDIU, BALANÇOU, CORAÇÃO É SÓ FELICIDADE, ABALOU, ABALOU, ISSO SIM É AMOR DE VERDADE 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

**imbaby122** (10): this song is radiating throughout my entire body and i think i have superpowers now.

**just\_thonking** (10): So close to my 11. Hatchlings stay winning

**pig-serpent** (10): I love Hatchie putting the pop in dream pop. One of the catchiest songs in the rate.

**ReallyCreative** (10): STREAM GIVING THE WORLD AWAY

**steelstepladder** (10): this album absolutely deserves to be rated

**Stryxen** (10): slayed

**PAHC** (9): i ADORE hatchie. i will forever try to make her happen

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Out of all the songs in this rate that have “Stay” in the title, this is easily the best one out of all of them

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): hatchie really got some of the best songs and then the albums are just like good but underwhelming

**gwykiki** (8.6): i assume that u/eklxtreme submitted this one and finally got me to listen to a hatchie song. it's lovely.

**MrMoodle** (8.5): kinda bored of this brand of indie pop generally but the chorus melody carries hard

**synyyy** (8.5): enchanting

**itsabop** (8.1): Sonically pleasing

**starla\_** (8.1): this is my least favourite Hatchie project but still good

**2dina3dworld** (8): I’m sorry Hatchie, but this isn’t the same level of bop as Giving the World Away

**runaway3212** (8): much better than the last stay with me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ugh fine maybe the hatchie hype is deserved :(

**vayyiqra** (8): Horrific album cover, nice song

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I’ll stay with you Hatchie 😢

**jman457** (7.9): I’m just glad I discovered her new album, might be a personal AOTY contender

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): ok Ms. Hatchie go off

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): hatchie is so good tbh

**qazz23** (7): decent synthpop sound but prefer the most recent album

**TiltControls** (7): It's nice, but it's not standing out to me as much as others

**wavingwolves** (7): gagged sam smith

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): I feel so unaustralian for not really liking hatchie

**WaneLietoc** (6.5): In spring 2019 I blind bought the Sugar & Spice cassette tape from DDW. WAY too bright for me. Truly knocked me on my ass in the bad way. by summer, I was being asked by radio promotors if I was charting Hatchie's Keepsake. I was not. Stay With Me isn't overwrought or bad by any means, even its video VERY clearly emphasizes that Hatchie knows the vibe she's doing. Club + shoegaze can go together and should. Yet, where he 2022 album has at least dug into some post-Curve crevices, returning to this Keepsake cut doesn't impress me. just dreamy mid. but hey! im a sucker.

**akanewasright** (6): I would have given a 10 to without a blush but this is fine

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Sometimes a gay person will say “why isn’t everyone streaming _____ it’s pop perfection!” and then they’ll link it and it’s yet another ~~synthpop~~ shoe gaze song that sounds exactly like this.

**Uberpigeon** (6): a nothing song

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Her lastfm tag says 'shoegaze' and I automatically assume it's a red flag

**apatel27** (2.5): Everything about it is weak. Weak dnb beat, weak voice that doesn't even match the song and weak progression

**CarlieScion** (11): I can’t not give this my 11 when presented with the opportunity

**skargardin** (10): The fabled shitpost very saddly misses out on making it to day 3. Submitted by /u/rickikardashian 

Now let's hear about the creation of this legendary shitpost from u/breadvelvet themselves!

"so i made this for a plug.dj night way back in 2017. when i had the time and was way more involved with the subreddit, i used to love making these kinds of lil videos for themed nights, and i remember one of mine i was particularly fond of, “dangerous woodwind” (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AUvzNhWPdQ), actually getting a decent amount of traction. for this one though, i really wanted to use “Snow Halation” from Love Live as a base, kind of paying homage to the tradition started by SiivaGunner, one of my favorite YouTube channels out there. at the time, folks on the subreddit were still very much dunking on The Chainsmokers’ whole deal (still in awe at the amount of mileage we got out of a mere 17.34 inches), and so i went with “Closer” for the vocals. the key for the vocals was just one or two semitones off of the “Snow Halation” instrumental, with roughly the same tempo anyway kind of made the audio for this project in about two hours. (side note, i truly have no memory of loading up the “Side To Side” vocal track on this project. when i was revisiting this it kind of jumpscared me a little bit????) BUT i ended up spending six days attempting to put together visuals that could get past youtube copyright. this was especially frustrating because i made this video on a limited free trial of adobe premiere, was teaching myself how to edit this on the fly, and i was nearing the end of the trial period. rent was due, etc, etc
but anyway i am genuinely really thankful and amazed that some people out there remembered and got enough enjoyment out of this video to save and reupload it after it got more copyright strikes (which i didn’t even know about until this rate!). admittedly there’s still some rough edges on here, you can def see where i had to cut between different versions of the animation sequence, and i’m still not really satisfied with how clunky the “side to side” animation bit loops. but i think enough time has passed where i’m more fond of and less frustrated by the jankiness lol. i also want to take this time highly encourage everyone reading this to check out the comments under the lyric sheet for "Closer" on Genius. someone 6 years ago described halsey's vocals as "fetus" and to this day it haunts and vexes me as to what they meant by that. if anyone has any leads lmk"

**awry** (11): iconic. historic. a collapse. none of my mashups can compare

**CrimsonROSET** (11): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Closer (JPN Version). The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Nicki's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation - her personal philosophy draws heavily from Barbz University, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Closer (JPN Version) truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Nicki's existencial catchphrase "Wrist Icicle Ride Dicc Bicycle," which itself is a cryptic reference to getting good dick in aerobics class. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as RandomHypnotica's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a μ's tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Anyways, vote for the anime rate.

**ricki** (11): what do you know about comedy if after you reveal #3 at a rate reveal you dont play the minute long drum roll and then this

**static\_int\_husp** (11): this is such an iconic piece of popheads culture I would be remiss if I didn't 11 it

**synyyy** (11): all aboard the dicc bicycle, we are going to find out who sent this one

**1998tweety** (10): the end part where I hear like 5 songs at once? Ascending.

**afs** (10): Close your £eyes. The year is 2016, The Chainsmokers debut their hit single “closer” playing on someone’s phone in a park on a sunny summer day, that park is filled with 100 people of every age and ethnicity, playing Pokémon go and looking anxiously for a Laura’s fabled to have been seen in the area. In the distance someone is showing their friend a meme of Trump making another gaffe “lmao, look at this clown, he should just drop out already Christ, it’s embarrassing”. Now wake up. Put on your N85 rated mask, listen to president Donald Trump’s COVID-19 announcement and get to work, the toilet paper is finally arriving in the store for restocking, and if you aren’t quick enough you’ll get stabbed for it or worse, coughed on.

**agentofscranton** (10): it's changed the course of human history

**akanewasright** (10): the best song to exist

**anothertown** (10): dicc bicycle

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride dicc bicycle ride DICC BICYCLE RIDE DICC BICYCLE RIDE DICC-

**BasedButta** (10): GOD WHEN THE SIDE TO SIDE HITS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): If this wins the entire subreddit ascends into heaven.

**bridgemoney** (10): The height of human accomplishment.

**celladonn** (10): Literally this brings me so much joy every time. Wrist icicle ride dicc bicycle.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i can’t believe i’ve been on this hell sub for long enough to be nostalgic for a previous era of rates

**flavasavavandal** (10): people say God rested on the 7th day, but she actually made this and decided to wait until the right time to drop it

**frogaranaman** (10): THIS ONE IS FOR PLUG.DJ

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this changed my life

**Gonza\_90** (10): Best song ever

**jman457** (10): if this wins, can we stop rating the original shitty one

**just\_thonking** (10): An actual masterpiece. Any mashup that improves the original song deserves a 10, but this goes above and beyond

**MassiveThief** (10): i cry laughing every single time

**moooo566** (10): the dictionary definition of something being greater than the sum of its parts. iconic. unsurpassed. the pinnacle of shitposting. also its fun.

**MrMoodle** (10): unironically this sounds insanely fucking good. the only part that doesn’t fully work for me is when nicki’s verse starts and she’s still in the key of side to side while the snow halation instrumental has switched up, but that’s only like a few seconds. also the guy from the chainsmokers’ relaxed vocals mesh really well with this? i thought he was just boring in the original closer but apparently anime intro music is where he shines. i dunno what it is but i’m frightened of the genius involved in making this mashup

**nt96** (10): Amongst the pantheon of Pophead's greatest achievements throughout the years, this one shines the brightest, reaffirming why I love doing these rates in the first place. Thank you Hypnotica.

skargardin: **PAHC** (10): um actually, halsey stole a MATRESS not a SWEATSHIRT. disgusting.

**pig-serpent** (10): Snow Halation memes will never not be funny.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): deserves to win this rate

**RandomHypnotica** (10): easily the most iconic thing any pophead member has ever made, simply art

**ReallyCreative** (10): all rise for the playing of our National Anthem

**Roxieloxie** (10): when this wins omg

**runaway3212** (10): obviously

**seanderlust** (10): i'm probably never getting another opportunity to give this masterpiece the 10 it deserves

**SmileAndTears** (10): iconique

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): an absolute plug.dj (rip) classic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): ph classic

**Uberpigeon** (10): dick bICICLE ❄️

**wavingwolves** (10): if you get it you get it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Needs its own wing in an art museum somewhere where it can be preserved for future generations

**babadork** (8.5): I feel bad for all the other joke songs for having to go up against this masterpiece. How is Elmo supposed to compete with this perfection?

**NecroDolphinn** (8.5): The Ariana cameo was very surprising

**imbaby122** (8): oh wow i gasped multiple times. so many twists and turns.

**itsabop** (8): Help this is a blast back to 2016 popheads

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): There’s an actual Japanese version of Closer on the Japanese release of “World War Joy” and it doesn’t go as hard as this mashup does. Seriously, why does this work so well???

**WaneLietoc** (7.8): glad I got mikgazer on cassette which is one of the funniest 2010s shoegaze releases. it yassifies and animes shoegaze and MANY american ditties could use that, like our friends left chainsmoker and right chainsmoker. together, the chainsmokers now have a real song.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): look this is absolutely iconic but this should not make day 3 I’m sorry I can’t give this an ironic 10

**2dina3dworld** (7): the Closer meme is dead and should stay dead but this is fine

**DaHumanTorch** (7): dicc bicycle!

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (7): I have no idea who or what breadvelvet is, but this is pretty cool and way better than the original song

**jsonphile** (7): points for creativity I guess

**qazz23** (7): easily better than the original

**camerinian** (6.9): flesh splats wetly

**krusso1105** (6.5): Initially very confused this wasn't actually in Japanese

**DirtyRat583** (6): …why?

**nootnoot781** (6): alright it ain’t that funny now

**DefaultPophead** (5.5): Funny because I think I aged 10 years.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): everyone’s gonna pull the shocked pikachu face when this makes it to the top 10 off of meme scores alone

**lagozzino** (5): one of you really paid money to make us have to listen to this and... i respect your hustle.

**MToms** (5): Is this a pop heads fan made creation? The score given is due to the sum of its parts being greater than than the whole.

**apatel27** (3): IM@S > LL

**gwykiki** (3): why is it christmas

**plastichaxan** (3): okay this got better towards the end where it was a mess but i refuse to rate it higher than this

**starla\_** (2.5): I still hate this song but this is at least an improvement over the original

**shipperondeck** (2): ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????hypno please clarify

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): This is so stupid but not gonna lie when Side to Side came on I kinda had a moment

**Verrem** (2): why would you do this? You could have picked any song, ANY SONG, and yet you picked this?!? anyways, big improvement over the original.

**fadedblue09** (1): no

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): we dgaf

**rslashpoopheads** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G-AuLXhTN4

**slimboyfriend** (1): I'm just...... tired
