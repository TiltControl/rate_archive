Charity Rate IV Reveal, Day 1 - 0 Thing
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/wyfxoc/charity_rate_iv_reveal_day_1_0_thing/

Hello, and welcome to the first day of the Charity Rate IV reveal! We are your hosts /u/skargardin and /u/CarlieScion and we are stoked to bring you the results! Thanks to you all, during the most recent charity drive, popheads raised a whopping $2078.34 for the Transgender Law Center which is absolutely amazing! As a bonus, people who donated $15 or more was allowed to submit a song for the charity rate, the results of which we'll be revealing starting today! 

Today we will be eliminating the first 26 songs (**#77-#51**). [The reveal will be held in queup](https://www.queup.net/join/charity-for-the-sake-of-rating-flops) so be sure to follow along to watch the results LIVE and some shitposts in between.

**[All scores](https://paste.ee/p/ophzP)**

---

**CarlieScion** (10): it truly is halloween

**skargardin** (0): Are we surprised? This was dead last for the entire rate, with good reason if you ask me!!! Even though it's just a puppet show sketch it makes me highly uneasy with its idiosyncrasies. Personally, I'm struggling to see why this was submitted even as a "joke" entry but to each their own. Submitted by /u/DaHumanTorch


---

**DaHumanTorch** (10): not everyone is going to get this the first time they listen. an avant-garde, experimental, horrorcore, spoken word, synthpop commentary on the terrors of capitalism and greedy landlords in the housing crisis but viewed through a childlike halloween lens filled with colorful characters and even a rap sample in order to create entertainment and humor for the audience while simultaneously radicalizing them? literally masterful, this is the kind of thing melanie martinez thought she was doing with cry baby. this is the closest we are going to get to rating the communist manifesto so do not do this dirty!

**DefaultPophead** (10): Legitimately terrified me, hence the score.

**flavasavavandal** (10): a camp 10

**MrMoodle** (10): there’s a new main pop girl in town and she’s looking for candy

**nt96** (10): I can NOT wait to see the controversy for this. I'm literally shaking with anticipation.

**plastichaxan** (10): how is this a 0 for y'all this is a masterpiece

**steelstepladder** (10): this happened to my buddy eric once

**Stryxen** (10): side eyeing people tanking this like why

**synyyy** (10): and here I thought the xiu xiu one was gonna be the weirdest one

**thedoctordances1940** (10): no exactly, fuck landlords!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): I was entertained

**WaneLietoc** (10): oh cool 8 minute copypasta ditty? sound collage? I have a sound collage tape from hallmark-oh it's a girl talking yeah shure. wait ppl be dying. wait we got a hip hop ditty. oh its a podcast concept piece? YEah 10000000% in on this a real winner. this is why I log on.

**celladonn** (9): I'm in hysterics

**BasedButta** (8): how the FUCK do i rate this. I went from hating it at the start to having a lot of fun with the little show later on. Like it.

**slimboyfriend** (8): I’m kind of obsessed with this narrative

**awry** (7.5): laurie anderson finally got invited to yo gabba gabba

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): I was expecting MLP-adjacent, not "competing with Xiu Xiu and Yoko Ono for fever dream of the rate"

**qazz23** (7): weird sketch with some musical bits interspersed but likely won't listen again 🎃

**babadork** (6): I feel like I was ripped off. I could maybe be into this if there was a puppet show to watch.

**welcome2thejam** (6): I don't wanna talk about it

**pig-serpent** (5.5): Assigning a number rating to this feels like a sin, and this is as close to abstaining as I can submit.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.3): i used a random number generator to decide my score for this one. i genuinely don't even know what i listened to like this doesn’t even technically count as music

**CrimsonROSET** (5): is there a ? rating i can give this

**hikk** (5): hm
[/r/popheads/comments/wyfxoc/charity_rate_iv_reveal_day_1_0_thing/ilwnjuz/]

=====

skargardin: **NecroDolphinn** (5): What the hell. Seriously what the hell. This was seven minutes of my life I will never get back. I’m giving a five because it's kind of iconic though and I respect the choice

**PAHC** (5): youve got to tank the obvious winner

**anothertown** (3): so what's this..

**itsabop** (3): Quirky only goes so far luvs

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): i can't give this a 0 because i actually laughed out loud at the bitch better have my money interpolation

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): help what is this

**seanderlust** (3): why in the world is this on spotify??? bestie it's an audio format

**1998tweety** (2): this gets a 2 for the camp factor

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Am I gonna die in 7 days?

**Gonza\_90** (2): When does the song start?

**krusso1105** (2): The only thing keeping this from a 1 was that I listened to it the whole way through out of sheer morbid fascination

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Oh fucking hell I am NOT dying tonight… Sorry whoever submitted this but I refuse to listen to this the whole way through, I don’t believe in ghosts or anything but there is SOMETHING in this track that makes me feel like I’m within 3 inches of death

**fadedblue09** (1.5): The piano bit in the middle is the saving grace

**gwykiki** (1.5): effective bait

**DirtyRat583** (1.3): who submitted this 2007 youtube video????? 🧍🧍

**2dina3dworld** (1): this witch is incredibly based but unfortunately we’re rating on music and the music here is pretty much non-existent. It’s not even a song, it’s a skit with a soundtrack. It’s only saved from my zero because it’d be kinda stupid to zero this when there’s much worse in this rate that’s supposed to be an actual song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): Sure.

**ignitethephoenix** (1): I just have so many questions ….

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i feel like im watching the lost episode of a kids show where the characters just start screaming and their eyes bleed with HYPERREALISTIC BLOOD

**imbaby122** (1): who is the audience for this? it’s a little charming tho and the horror is kind of effective…

**lagozzino** (1): I love pretentious experimental bullshit, one of my favourite Neubauten songs is a 20 minute piece where the singer reads a grocery list over the sound of bed springs being hit, and even I think this is too obnoxious.

**MassiveThief** (1): what

**ricki** (1): im not listening to this

**Roxieloxie** (1): so glad this came on directly after 679 so at least i dont have to fear that popheads would send that out first

**rslashpoopheads** (1): the fetty wap song wasn't on the playlist and I literally sat through 4 minutes of this thinking it was him

**shipperondeck** (1): ?

**skull\_xbones** (1): uhhh wtf is this?

**starla\_** (1): no

**Uberpigeon** (1): i know its a philosophical debate "what is music" but i think we can all agree this is not music

**Verrem** (1): this is not music and I listen to Swans

**yearofthesoup** (1): is this music? I guess 1 pt for community care vs landlords tho

**afs** (0): I was debating on using my 11 but then it got old so I made it a 0

**akanewasright** (0): Fuck landlords but my god this was horrible

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): i'm sorry to whoever submitted this but i find this genuinely unlistenable

**bridgemoney** (0): what.

**camerinian** (0): the worst part about this is somehow the opening soundscape is actually a good intro, only for it to become "your 6 year old niece and nephew (of course it's the twins) want to do a show at the family reunion and no one wants to tell a kid they suck so you just sit there for 25 minutes while these kids do bad improv with their stuffed toys and you're dying inside waiting for the chicken to roast so your uncle who lucked out on kitchen duty can finally put everyone out of their misery"

**cremeebrulee** (0): a sleep paralysis episode

**frogaranaman** (0): initiating a mental health check on whoever submitted this one

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (0): I have to believe that this was submitted to troll us. Well, congratulations, I hate it. It's possibly one of the worst "songs" I've ever listened to, and I've listened to a lot of weird shit.

**jman457** (0): um ok……. Wasnt even fun in a camp way

**jsonphile** (0): this is not a song why am I listening to this. And why is it so long?? No I’m sorry but I would like to listen to an actual song not a silly puppet skit for children WHERE I CANT EVEN SEE THE DAMN PUPPETS

**just\_thonking** (0): Hate this, sorry

**pleasegivemeasword** (0): i'm so sorry but what the fuck is this

**RandomHypnotica** (0): ...

**ReallyCreative** (0): I was going to give this a 10 for being an iconic anti-landlord anthem but ultimately decided that it would be better suited making the lowest rated songs of all time list. Make no mistake though, this is a perfect song.

**runaway3212** (0): maybe landlords have a point

**SmileAndTears** (0): wow that was really funny and not obnoxious at all im so glad i had to listen to this

**static\_int\_husp** (0): this is genuinely one of the most agonizing 7 minutes I have had to listen to in a rate

**TiltControls** (0): I would probably enjoy this more if it were some random Youtube video that came up and not a requirement for a music rate

**TragicKingdom1** (0): why

**vayyiqra** (0): I don't care if it's anti-landlord that does not mean something can't also suck

**wavingwolves** (0): the worst 7 minutes of my entire month i think

**xavieryes** (0): idk wtf this is and i don't want to find out

**CarlieScion** (3): surely a song

**skargardin** (3): Yeah I'm sorry this just sounds unfinished to me, almost demo-like. Like I get what they were going for, but the execution isn't really there I'm afraid. It's no wonder that it ended up where it did in the rate, despite it having its few defenders. Submitted by u/elleswood

---

**starla\_** (9.3): extremely good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Yes this sounds like it was recorded on a potato, but you know what I like potatoes they’re filling, nutritious, and delicious.

**afs** (8.5): was this the birth of lofihyperpop...

**awry** (8): such an interesting sound. kind of like the lo-fi sound of alex g but combined with early grimes or idk animal collective? i really like this psychedelic sound even if the vocals sound like they were recorded on a 2010 laptop mic (they probably were tbh)

**SmileAndTears** (8): cute

**synyyy** (7.5): stuff like this is why I don't sing

**MassiveThief** (7): pretty cool. I wish the production were a bit cleaner but it's well written

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): pretty slay actually

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's pretty cool but it gets eaten alive in this rate

**runaway3212** (7): hyperpop

**steelstepladder** (7): Too many people are gonna dismiss this but with better production this would really fuck

**anothertown** (6): jesse

**camerinian** (6): I don't wanna be the guy to say "no you don't get it, it's meant to sound like shit", but

**plastichaxan** (6): is this shoe gays

**qazz23** (6): a bit too laid back for me

**throwaway-7650** (6): it's really not bad, a bit good, even!

**slimboyfriend** (5.9): I feel like I’d like this more in the context of an album

**itsabop** (5.5): Confused by this one, but it's alright

**DirtyRat583** (5.2): they should try to sing directly into the mic next time

**flavasavavandal** (5): I guess I can appreciate what it is going for but that vocal mixing is rough

**Stryxen** (5): it’s alright, i see the vision

**welcome2thejam** (5): Puts the "lo" in lo-fi

**jman457** (4.7): I’m sorry but the sound mixing is so bad on this

**DefaultPophead** (4.5): I'm happy for them, but I'm not sure I'm happy to hear them. This is surely someone's hidden gem, though!

**WaneLietoc** (4.5): love seeing kristin rytter's lo-fi/slacker drum machine project getting rated as it deserves. it's got a melody and some ideas but she doesn't connect them at the end of the chorus :/

**celladonn** (4): This is Krysten Ritter? You'd think she could afford some better recording equipment

**CrimsonROSET** (4): this sounds like a demo

**fadedblue09** (4): The garage production is intrigiin

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_sPV2I0gk8

**ImADudeDuh** (4): i don’t like that vocal filter and I find this kinda boring in general

**nt96** (4): they really put their day 1 energy into this

**pig-serpent** (4): This song feels misaligned to me. I get the vibe it’s going for but sometimes one instrument is a little too loud or there is obvious clipping in the vocals that’s dragging it down, and while reverb may have been cool and original in 2005 the overall texture of her guitar tone is very nothing.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Sounds like a rough demo that they decided was good enough to release commercially

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I always dislike when people sing all drunk-sounding like this… like they don’t care enough about the music they’re making to actually put effort into their singing…

**PAHC** (3.5): mixing is a mess i gotta be honest

**imbaby122** (3): welp this song felt like listening to a bit of nothing.

**RandomHypnotica** (3): there's a really nice song in here, buried beneath a terrible lo-fi aesthetic

**TiltControls** (3): There's a solid foundation here, but I think as a whole it feels a bit all over the place

**yearofthesoup** (3): Walmart Tegan & Sara

**DaHumanTorch** (2): it's giving that video of the group of girls singing just give me a reason

**Uberpigeon** (2): this sounds like when my headphones arent plugged all the way in

**Verrem** (2): naaaaa but what is this mixing, painful to listen to

**xavieryes** (2): the title is interesting. the song, not so much.

**akanewasright** (1.5): This could’ve been a 5 or 6 if it was produced well. I’m sure this was an artistic choice, but sometimes the artists make bad choices

**1998tweety** (1): sorry but the quality of this is not that great

**MrMoodle** (1): recorded on my iphone 3gs

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): i’m scared

**ricki** (1): ok

**rslashpoopheads** (1): no what is this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): uhm

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): did they record this inside a microwave

**vayyiqra** (1): I like Krysten Ritter but this is bad

**wavingwolves** (1): okay indie sarah brand

**2dina3dworld** (0): not to start poser discourse but I like lo fi, and to me this sounds like it was recorded in a proper studio but purposely mixed to sound ‘cheap’ and it doesn’t work!

**BasedButta** (0): ew dude, that’s… dreary. and stupid.

**lagozzino** (0): honestly out of everything in this rate this is the only song I haven't been able to bring myself to replay. yes, I'd actually rather hear the spooky halloween sound fx song again than this.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): this is JESSICA JONES??? I almost took back my 0 for the entertainment I got from that realization

**seanderlust** (0): i feel like i need an explanation on why this was sent before i say what i really think :sob:

**thedoctordances1940** (0): i hope this is meant to sound ironically bad, like even if i just find the production ridiculously annoying i can get the appeal, if it's meant to be serious, well...

**CarlieScion** (3): maybe men should stay away from making music

**skargardin** (1): The first dare I say divisive song gets cut. It had quite a ride during the rate, but never managed to climb out of the lower 60s. Even so, I think the graph is a testament to how divisive it is. Clearly there's a lot to take in on first, and even repeat listens with its abrasiveness, and that seemed to be too much for most raters to ovecome, myself included. This is not something I would listen to again. Submitted by /u/Plastichaxan

---

**plastichaxan** (11): yes, I’m 11ing my own submission, I don’t care, it is genuinely my favorite in the rate and while yes, this is a lock for bottom 5, I didn’t submit it to be liked I just wanted to see the controversy/reactions people had to this so yeah sdfjsfkj

**2dina3dworld** (10): ITS A BAD TIME TO BE XIU XIU IN THIS CHARITY RATE

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I never want to hear this again.

**MrMoodle** (10): i don’t know if i actually like this or if i just needed this because it’s crunchy enough to scrape out the my little pony trapped in my brain

**steelstepladder** (10): Girl with basket of slay

**Stryxen** (10): YASS YASSSSSS YASSSSSSS YASSSS YASSSSSSSSSS

**synyyy** (10): as a xiu xiu stan I do not want to show this album to anyone

**thedoctordances1940** (10): thistbh

**afs** (9): this is an Unsong and I live for it

**flavasavavandal** (9): experimentalheads unite

**nt96** (9): This is gonna ruin Pophead's ears and I'm ok with that :)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): an ass shaker

**awry** (8.5): yeah this is real difficult to judge after just one listen (i'm in a hurry lol) but after scanning the lyrics, this song seems to be about sexual trauma and the feeling of shame? a heavy subject. the combination of the absurdist lyrics and the hurrying, panicking beat makes the song feel very dizzy and almost scary

**slimboyfriend** (8.3): if this is a parody of all the indieheads-core bands that have British men rambling over a stale loop then I like it even more, esp. The part about the floppy boob

**wavingwolves** (8.1): girl with a basket of fruit. girl with a basket of fruit. girl with a basket of fruit.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): with my shield i will protect xiu xiu

**frogaranaman** (8): intentionally increasing the controversy score on this one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): no one knows what it means, but it’s provocative, it gets the people going

**WaneLietoc** (8): i hate engaging with internet about certain bands and the certain comment sections have about 2 variations of the "i listen to or engage with popular abrasive music" that spawn from it--fuck off and listen to bill nace instead of making dipshit jokes about this. spare me the eye roll tell me something new. basket of fruit sounds like a 2006 deathbomb arc album that got a radio ready mix/master for 2019 bandcamp. cool, whatever. okay now that we got that settled, what an unsettling image well delivered.

**camerinian** (7.5): as the only song in this list brave enough to say “pee-pee” I have no choice but to endorse

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Extra points for being intriguing.

**celladonn** (7): so true

**Gonza\_90** (7): https://i.redd.it/2dsdl2jzthq51.jpg

**NecroDolphinn** (7): Harsh noise rate when??

**qazz23** (7): a bit too weird and annoying vocals, liking the tribal sounding drums though

**Uberpigeon** (7): nothing marina didnt do already

**welcome2thejam** (7): Afraid of being haunted by the FROGHOST if I don't give this a positive score

**DirtyRat583** (6.2): death grips

**pig-serpent** (6): I thought this was super cool at first and every time I hear it I like it a little less… actually that’s how I feel about every Xiu Xiu song, but especially this one.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5.6): help

**PAHC** (5.5): i can respect the effort put into this i hope

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): i liked it better when this was pumpkin attack on mommy and daddy

**bridgemoney** (4.9): Not feeling the vibes here.

**jman457** (4.3): I like weird, but this just felt a little pintless

**akanewasright** (3): I was kinder to this the last time I heard it, but it’s been 5 fucking hours and I have to deal with this? It’s obviously a well made track but god this is not for me

**anothertown** (3): no x

**ReallyCreative** (3): not even going to try to come up with a smartass comment for this one let's just keep it moving

**runaway3212** (3): I hate this but I also kinda love it but I hate it more

**seanderlust** (3): boy with an immediate need to talk to his therapist (me)

**SmileAndTears** (3): 👁👄👁

**Verrem** (3): venn diagram of people who likes this and Death Grips is probably a single circle

**imbaby122** (2): yeah what the fuck………………..

**jsonphile** (2): what I mean what am I listening to

**starla\_** (1.5): Xiu Xiu is fucking weird

**1998tweety** (1): this is NOT music

**astrologicalangelel** (1): this came on shuffle and I nearly had a heart attack

**BasedButta** (1): I get it but… no. I feel tempted to 10 this or whatever so it doesn’t go out first (the existence of this kind of song is needed imo) but I can’t lie to myself, the listening experience is horrible

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I feel like an Adult Swim cartoon character having a bad acid trip

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (1): indie infiltration of the worst kind

**MassiveThief** (1): not my preferred flavor of experimental unfortunately

**RandomHypnotica** (1): im sorry, this does not work at ALL for me

**ricki** (1): im not listening to that

**Roxieloxie** (1): dkminecart

**shipperondeck** (1): Girl With Basket Of Fruit

**skull\_xbones** (1): uhhh wtf is this?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): you can tell they really thought they did something

**TiltControls** (1): Gotta apologize to poppy but this is really not a thing I enjoyed listening to in any capacity

**vayyiqra** (1): This song makes me think "I hope Jamie Stewart got the help he needed"

**babadork** (0): I seem to either hate of love Xiu Xiu songs, and this is one of the ones I hate.

**hikk** (0): soOoOooO0o0ooo RANDOM xD

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I’m afraid my brain is not advanced enough to be enlightened by whatever the fuck is going on

**ImADudeDuh** (0): I know that I can’t throw too many stones cause I live in the glass house of “I gave Black Country, New Road - Sunglasses an 11 before” but girl. . . . . . . . . . . .

**rslashpoopheads** (0): black midi who? squid who?

**throwaway-7650** (0): it's funny that "xiu" (修) can mean "fix" in chinese because that's what I think their ears need some of after hearing this

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): I like music I can listen to

**skargardin** (3): Things sure happen, such as being a bottom five entry in a charity rate. I just don't have much to say about this track really. Which I'm sure speaks to its low placement in the rate. Submitted by /u/flavasavavandal

**CarlieScion** (2): who thought this was gonna be a good idea to rate here

---

**MrMoodle** (10): the instrumental sounds like something that would play in a fight scene in season 1 of buffy i love it

**plastichaxan** (10): oomb (one of my besties) played this in beatsense once and i was hooked since

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song sounds like a witch putting a curse on you, but also it's sexy? (or maybe i've just discovered a kink idk)

**synyyy** (10): i fear this along with xiu will be day 1

**WaneLietoc** (10): real music by real fellas. Coil's story is easily one of the saddest of industrial lore: two lovers with their own vices. They kept making several great albums though and sleazy and geoff were unrivaled. goodness what a ditty this is.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.3): slays a lot but probably will not do well

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Do I really like this or did I only enjoy it because the worse song in the rate was before it in the playlist?

**imbaby122** (8.5): just casual easy listening huh. also wtf is up with ohio what’s the appeal there i have so many friends who go to school in ohio.

**2dina3dworld** (8): I hate spoken words in songs! Except when it’s this song

**BasedButta** (8): this is hype as hell, but uh i dont think i really want to listen to it

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is freaky but in the correct way

**lagozzino** (8): Who submitted this? As thanks I wanna take a trip down the anal staircase with you

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): wait this is absolutely eating

**qazz23** (8): i kinda like the vocals and the industrial sound (this likely won't do good lol)

**ReallyCreative** (8): did this bitch really ask what's going on in Ohio

**camerinian** (7.5): this felt like bumping into an old classmate on a night out after a dive bar show and you've not seen them in like four years and you've never seen them so shit faced so they just unload every fucking thing they're feeling on to you and like it's nice to see them but those mulled wines you had are wearing off and your potato wedges are getting cold, you know like when the sour cream starts to melt and run, and you really just want to pull your phone out and call the Uber but like you don't wanna be the asshole in the situation cos you don't know if they'll remember this encounter and hold it against you. So anyway yeah evocative vibe haha

**nt96** (7.5): this band inspired Autechre, let that sink in

**jman457** (7.3): very strange but I kind of liked it

**nootnoot781** (7): AJayll_i_dont_know_what_the_fuck_i_just_heard.mp4

**vayyiqra** (7): Pretentious as hell but weirdly compelling

**welcome2thejam** (7): This song sounds like it will be responsible for my death

**PAHC** (6.5): babe im kinda drunk i think i slayed someone

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Ohio sucks but it has Cedar Point and Kings Island so I guess it's a wash overall.

**seanderlust** (6.5): i have had this conversation verbatim with someone who was way drunker than 9:30 PM would usually dictate one to be outside of a club

**afs** (6): that was a fucking lie

**astrologicalangelel** (6): I have no idea what is happening but girl I am living

**awry** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERXq3r1Kq0Q

**celladonn** (6): Me when things happen

**DaHumanTorch** (6): it's giving tatianna same parts

**shipperondeck** (6): sis calls this penis music

**Stryxen** (6): you will NEVER be flossie OR the unicorns

**DirtyRat583** (5.5): i feel like im getting cursed

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): wtf is happening in this song, did she burn some guy's house down or something i can't tell

**frogaranaman** (5): what I assume r/nosleep posters listen to

**MassiveThief** (5): well... it's interesting i guess

**runaway3212** (5): things like this going out day 1

**slimboyfriend** (5): There's this overflow of tension and then she just goes "What's it like in Ohio?" lol

**steelstepladder** (5): Coil in a Marvel movie be like "well... things just happened"

**Uberpigeon** (5): this is what i sound like in the vc at 4am

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Wut

**starla\_** (4.7): this is annoying, like you're trying to have a conversation in a room full of loud machinery

**babadork** (4): Someone on YouTube made a fanvid for A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night using this song, which I think kind of helped sell me on it. They cut 20 seconds and it still only kind of works, but it’s enough for this to not be my zero.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): i guess this did happen cue laughter roll credits produced by carliescion

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I think I’m being cursed by a witch right now

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): i dont think i’m smart enough to get the appeal of this

**fadedblue09** (3): this is unsettling

**NecroDolphinn** (3): I like industrial but what the hell is this. Maybe if Closer (Nine Inch Nail’s Version) was in this rate we could have better industrial rep. At least the instrumental develops a little bit.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): wtf is this song.

**jsonphile** (2): it’s too much for me

**throwaway-7650** (2): me explaining why I need an extension for every rate

**TiltControls** (2): It's cool for a listen, but I didn't enjoy the sound enough to ever want to revisit unfortunately. Definitely interestingly made though!

**yearofthesoup** (2): wtf the vibes are awful what with so many mentions of Ohio

**1998tweety** (1): i go to /r/popheads to get away from stuff like this

**anothertown** (1): girl..

**cremeebrulee** (1): this is making my skin crawl sorry

**rslashpoopheads** (1): whoever submitted this WILL be hearing from my lawyers

**SmileAndTears** (1): I have several questions for the person who picked this song

**static\_int\_husp** (1): I do not know what I just heard

**xavieryes** (1): listening to this whole thing was painful (yes even more than the Yoko Ono song)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Well maybe they shouldn’t.

**CarlieScion** (3): maybe women too

**skargardin** (1): From one abrasive track to the next, Yoko Ono was also incredibly divisive. As was the case with Xiu Xiu, I think this proved too much for most raters. I will commend Yoko for stirring up so much emotion with such a simple question though! Submitted by u/bbfan132

---

**WaneLietoc** (11): yoko ahead of the post-punk curve by about 8 years here with a jumpy, angular-driven yapper of an anthem. Would not sound out of place on Metal Box, which is the highest complement you can really give any post-punk; this is a song where you have to follow the dub bass and dance to that and drums (while brushing your teeth to the guitar). Saintly 11 dispatched out of mad respect for making real hot shit music like this. now you can go on bandcamp and listen to a derivative.

**2dina3dworld** (10): only hot bitches get Yoko Ono, shout out to Piper

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I never want to hear this again.

**cremeebrulee** (10): she just gets me

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): honestly it’s slaying

**plastichaxan** (10): not even 1 minute in she outsold anything the beatles ever did

**ricki** (10): she sounds like the ghost from mario

**runaway3212** (10): when she just screams :heart_eyes:

**steelstepladder** (10): Me when my submission goes out day one

**Stryxen** (10): i knew i’d give this a 10 before i even knew what it sounded like

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): My favourite Beatle is Yoko.

**nt96** (9.5): The strongest, slayyest energy ever put into Day 1

**apatel27** (9.4): Anyone that says they love hyperpop but tanks this are posers

**anothertown** (9): so "why" did you submit this? so that a bunch of 19 year old gays could have a little ki over the old screaming crazy lady and have a place to put their zeros?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): this kinda rips tbh

**jman457** (8.6): walked so the Bjork and Grimes girlies could run

**wavingwolves** (8.6): why indeed

**camerinian** (8.5): this was a very funny jumpscare to get in the middle of the supermarket

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Love that the B-52’s are being rated twice this month <3

**starla\_** (8.5): Yoko One is the real 5th Beatle

**bridgemoney** (8.1): Me when a rate I submit to popheads doesn't get picked.

**BasedButta** (8): idk. i kinda like it. sorry?

**moooo566** (8): i only know yoko ono by reputation and i was ready to hate this but honestly? it's pretty good. if i didn't know it was 50 years old i'd think it was some pandemic era hyperpop/experimental thing.

**NecroDolphinn** (8): Harsh noise rate when??

**pig-serpent** (8): My unironic first reaction to this was "Wait, I don't remember anyone submitting Black Midi."

**qazz23** (8): whyyyyy so much screaming, whyyyyy is the bassline so good

**slimboyfriend** (8): Ok Yoko go off

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me when i stub my toe

**welcome2thejam** (8): Why is Yoko Ono as hard as it gets

**celladonn** (7.5): me whenever i'm faced with a minor inconvenience

**itsabop** (7.5): This describes how I feel every morning when I wake up but in song form

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): this is what curses in jujutsu kaisen sound like + a beat

**akanewasright** (7): idk if I’m liking this but I am having a good time listening

**DaHumanTorch** (7): this has ripper roo from crash bandicoot energy

**MrMoodle** (7): cute summer bop

**babadork** (6.5): While I like this and would give it closer to an 8.5, I do feel like I need to take my dog’s 0 into account, and she hates this song.

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (6): I don't hate these vocals the way most people do, but I also don't particularly like them

**jsonphile** (6): why more like why does this actually kinda slap?? Like yeah, Yoko’s voice is absurd and annoying, but like it’s got a decent groove

**RandomHypnotica** (6): the 2018 version kinda outsold

**SmileAndTears** (6): 👁👄👁

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): girl i don't fucking know

**fadedblue09** (5): is this an exorcism

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): well it's creative

**TiltControls** (5): Why? Why not. Also I was going to give this higher due to the camp value, but given how stacked the rest of the rate is it's hard to follow through

**afs** (4): I agree

**CrimsonROSET** (4): oh

**hikk** (4): why not?

**imbaby122** (4): mhm okay gonna need some time to digest this. it’s got a nice funky beat tho.

**flavasavavandal** (3): Yoko, what are you doing girl?

**Gonza\_90** (3): elmoglitch

**PAHC** (3): oh no! a witch!!

**synyyy** (3): nice title

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): At first I felt really guilty not liking this cause I thought maybe this was her form of catharsis after John’s death, in which case I would have respected it a lot more. But nope, this was released a full ten years prior when John was alive and breathing so I have no qualms in hating this

**thedoctordances1940** (2.8): yeah, why?

**seanderlust** (2.5): ms. ono please stop doing that you're scaring the hoes

**ReallyCreative** (2): asking myself the same thing after hearing this, omg her mind

**MassiveThief** (1): this would be so so good if it weren't for... y'know...

**PrimaryCrusaders** (1): ok, three questions: 1. wtf is this song, 2. why are there so many weird songs in this rate, and most importantly, 3. WHY IS SHE SCREAMING

**Roxieloxie** (1): can i have a 4th 0

**rslashpoopheads** (1): i literally thought this was the same song as the xiu xiu one

**shipperondeck** (1): HEEEEEEELP NOT THIS RIGHT AFTER GIRL WITH BASKED OF FRUIT

**vayyiqra** (10): trust

**starla\_** (8.1): stream popheads

**qazz23** (8): good flow overall and vocals especially in the second half

**shipperondeck** (8): deserves way more attention tf

**thedoctordances1940** (8): trust

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.2): the lyrics "19/21 with no license bitch" hits too close to home for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Very cute.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): love how dreamy this production is. I think my least fave part is the rapping but it’s solid shout out to this discord user

**pig-serpent** (7): Fairly pleasant emo rap. I can dig it.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): I really like the choruses, super chill, but I'm not a fan of the verses

**jman457** (6.1): it was good until It got a little too typical sad boi shit

**awry** (6): i really like the instrumental

**babadork** (6): Even though he mentions being 21 in this song, I feel like making a mean comment would be picking on a teenager.

**DefaultPophead** (6): Hope you got some fans from this, Isaiah.

**MrMoodle** (6): i’ve got a hunch the person who submitted this is probably the actual artist behind it, so, uhh, i’m sorry lol, just not really my vibe

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's cute but does get a little lost in a rate with this many heavy hitters

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): a little rough around the edges but its nice for what it is

**Uberpigeon** (6): izeezus ur so brave for this

**WaneLietoc** (6): chill

**welcome2thejam** (6): So which vibes playlist is this one on?

**DirtyRat583** (5.8): i have heard this song a million times before

**afs** (5.5): can this have a no rap version too

**synyyy** (5.5): drake and half alive met up but during the pandemic

**Gonza\_90** (5): Boring

**rslashpoopheads** (5): tell 'em, Naegi

**1998tweety** (4): this is ok

**anothertown** (4): is this someone promoting their own song

**imbaby122** (4): i appreciate another 19 year old without a license but this just isn’t for me.

**seanderlust** (4): it takes a lot of courage to submit one's own songs to the whim of popheads raters, a group that collectively decided slumber party by britney spears is better than the entirety of lemonade by beyonce, so kudos for that! it do take nerve. i really like the background instrumentals! the pinging sounds make for a really floaty and dreamy atmosphere that i always love. if i could give you a couple pieces of feedback, for me your voice sometimes tended to overpower the background instrumentals a bit too much, and also maybe go a bit deeper or get more specific with the lyrics. what motivates the drive to do great things? how does that pressure manifest in you? how do you show up for your friends that you put your trust in? don't be afraid to be detailed and a bit less direct. also as one last note, if this ends up leaving early just bear in mind that a lot of these songs are near and dear to a lot of raters' hearts. my personal submission is a song that has been with me for nearly two decades for example so rating your song - which again is lovely! - against a song that so directly speaks to me almost feels like a bit of a setup :soobcry:

**throwaway-7650** (4): iz I'm so sorry but the rap is giving kpop/4th gen boy group

**akanewasright** (3): I like the beat quite a bit, but I thought the vocal could be a lot more confident. Like this isn’t a song to belt over, but idk it felt shaky to me

**ImADudeDuh** (3): fine but its very obviously someone’s first self produced, self written song

**slimboyfriend** (3): I would work on the lyrics, the flow, the singing, and the vocal mixing… But the beat is cute!

**PAHC** (2.5): the beat is giving xylophone lessons

**Roxieloxie** (2): this is about to be the most uncomfortable 3 minutes in queup when this goes out

**runaway3212** (2): forgettable

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): not the plagiarism of Lizzo amongst other issues

**BasedButta** (1): for me, just ew. but I can see this being good for whoever in this world is able to like to these kinds of songs

**TiltControls** (1): I don't know if it's bad, but it's a stacked rate compared to the other classics submitted it falls a bit short

**Verboten\_Prince** (1): I wanna trash this song SO bad but like, this is the only song on this singer’s Spotify. This dude only has 80 monthly listeners. Bashing titans like Taylor and BTS and Bieber is fun, but to do the same to a small artist like this just feels like bullying. So I’m gonna hold my tongue and say this is not for me AT ALL, but I hope that Izeezus, like all small artists out there, finds lots of success and makes lots of people happy doing what they love.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i like how the spotify tag specifies this is the non rap version but he still raps

**ReallyCreative** (8): [Non-Rap Version] implies the existence of a [Rap Version] which judging from the bridge would be a disaster

**CrimsonROSET** (6): WHERE IS THE RAP VERSION DANE??

**Gonza\_90** (6): ,5 I wonder how the Rap version sounds

**awry** (5.5): removed .5 for the blatant lie in the spotify tag. that is NOT a non-rap version.

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): screaming at the [non-rap version], the submitter really had popheads in mind (EDIT: he rapped.)

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): the "[non-rap version]" in the spotify title is vaguely ominous, especially considering this does have a rap

---

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**2dina3dworld** (10): is it stupid to give a 10 to a kids song sung by a puppet meant to represent a three year old child? Yes. Does it put a smile on my face? Yes. Does that justify it? Yes.

**akanewasright** (10): this would be the 11 if we rated the “Elmo’s World” version

**astrologicalangelel** (10): it's what a legend deserves

**DefaultPophead** (10): Instant serotonin boost.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): “to think he wrote this alone” “he wrote the music / he wrote the words” Beyoncé is in shambles

**itsabop** (10): Your faves could never

**jsonphile** (10): listen I had a stuffed animal Elmo when I was a little child and I took it with me everywhere so I have to give this a 10 for my first best friend but also big bird and snuffleupagus should get off this song more Elmo please

**MrMoodle** (10): i always thought minions were hilarious before it became an ironic meme to go to the minion’s movie or whatever. like say banana in a funny voice and i’ll fucking lose it 9 times out of 10. tbh i think people who don’t find the minions funny are like 90% incels. anyway this is good for the same reason minions are, his voice is funny and cute

**WaneLietoc** (10): "TO THINK HE WROTE DIS ALONE." stfu BIG BIRD. ELMO LIVES WITH D.I.D. TO COPE WITH UNSPEAKABLE PAINS. ELMO IS A CHAMP THO AND HAS AN UNFATHOMABLE EAR FOR POP MELODY AND COLLABORATION. BIG BIRD IS A FUCKEN SELL OUT PLAGIARIST CHUMP

**Gonza\_90** (7): quagelmo

**gwykiki** (7): i'm rating this based on what it's supposed to be, and it's decently high quality for simple children's music

**PAHC** (7): cute although i am terribly afraid of elmo so ill have to lower this by a point

**TiltControls** (6.2): Would've been higher if Elmo weren't brought down by the other two. Friendship be damned, he could be the next big thing in music if he were to go solo.

**DirtyRat583** (6.1): honestly i expected worse

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Kermit outsold.

**starla\_** (3.5): when I was little I had a Tickle Me Elmo toy and that thing was fucking annoying

**DaHumanTorch** (3): when i was little i saw snuffleupugus on tv and he terrified me so bad and i had a recurring dream that he inhaled me through his nose and ate me FUCK snuffleupagus

**CarlieScion** (2): sometimes hyper pop is bad part two

**skargardin** (1): Maybe it was just too ahead of its time for certain people... I for one thought this was terrible but lo and behold, it's got its stern defenders and it even snatched up an 11! Submitted by sage#8949

---

**afs** (11): THIS is what is wrong with society. Fuck your 'oHh Mee OHHH myyyyy', this is true political commentary from an OXFORD Masters student. With the power of Sarah Brand, we will take down capitalism, burn Apartheid Clyde at the cross Gaga used for some ditched MV and most of all make One Direction reunite. This is the only way to get rid of Pilgrim Harry.

**2dina3dworld** (10): I feel like I can’t comment on this because im American and despite it sounding like Shoes, this is actually a very deep and heavily political song. I'm not being ironic or sarcastic here. It’s a criticism of capitalism and the American Dream hidden between a hyperpop sheen that makes it seem silly and innocuous.

**awry** (10): to be honest? releasing this after red dress was a watershed moment in pop music. politically active icon. send this to taylor, let her learn

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): literally genius, sarah brand outsold all your faves

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The girls who get it, get it.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i tried to submit the communist manifesto to this rate and it wasn’t allowed, but its ok because a better version got sent methinks

**DaHumanTorch** (10): no like WHY is this song so good what happened in that studio

**MrMoodle** (10): oh

**pig-serpent** (10): You like this ironically, I like this unironically. We are not the same.

**plastichaxan** (10): i wanted to make my comment a line from the song but every single line is so quotable like… her mind… the impact this song should/will have on society should be extraordinary like whoa

**RandomHypnotica** (10): genuinely one of the most brilliant songs written this decade

**ReallyCreative** (10): iconic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): i mean this song is just perfect in every way, brilliant lyrics contemplating the economic hardship facing so many americans today, one of the catchiest hooks ever written and mindblowing hyperpop production all in one song??? like what's not to absolutely love about this

**throwaway-7650** (10): just increasing the controversy score

**vayyiqra** (10): based

**WaneLietoc** (10): Loved my gap jacket in 8th grade. loved my old gap pants. last went there just before 4th of july 2021 with my friend as he looked for some shit. mid warehouse vibe. anyways potent video and truly fantastic slab of "no but sure" that is too clean and rail to get on hausmo or orange milk. still a gut 10.

**wavingwolves** (10): swallowed mother lake

**itsabop** (9): This hyperpop track is so good

**jman457** (8.8): Karl Marx who?

**synyyy** (8.5): if this gets day 3 this proves Sarah brand has been manipulating us all along

**akanewasright** (8): camp

**camerinian** (8): the aneurysm I got when I realised this is the same girl who made Red Dress. Also the aneurysm I got while hearing this

**celladonn** (8): woke hyperpop queen

**hikk** (8): U NAUGHTY BISCUIT ........ UR TESTING ME

**imbaby122** (8): she’s a little off beat but she’s got the right spirit!!! she’s like gfoty if she ran a political campaign.

**just\_thonking** (8): Unironically the best political song in recent memory

**nt96** (8): A Sarah Brand x Farrah Abraham collab would be a gamechanger for pop, but are we ready for that conversation?

**PAHC** (8): i love how you can literally understand barely 1/5 of the lyrics, it makes it better

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): She saw all the gays joking about her doing hyperpop and decided to take it seriously and man, it's such an upgrade. The bridge and final chorus is utterly bonkers.

**welcome2thejam** (8): If there were no rate laws against it, I would score this an $æ₩}õ that's how much this song defies numerical valuation

**shipperondeck** (7.6): this sounds like a vocaloid song gone wrong

**slimboyfriend** (7.3): she has made some points while sounding like GFOTY circa early 2010s

**SmileAndTears** (7): that's extremely vaaliiiiiid

**BasedButta** (6): reeeeaally not my kind of song. also I’ll regret saying this but the hard autotune part sounded pretty good. the ending is cool too

**DefaultPophead** (6): I know its supposed to be bad, but it ain't THAT bad.

**qazz23** (6): don't care for the hyperpop bits but i liked the rap and dreamy part near the end

**seanderlust** (6): this feels like a very informed farrah abraham

**starla\_** (5.8): I...love novelty shit and this is almost good

**DirtyRat583** (5.3): if nadia oh put in 70% effort

**anothertown** (5): girl with a master's degree from oxford you'd think you could do better than sociology 101

**CrimsonROSET** (5): to quote a classic, she’s speaking facts but she’s also just speaking

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): the thing about rapping is you have to be able to do it

**TiltControls** (4.5): I'm not the biggest hyperpop fan unfortunately, but I can recognize this was a really well made track. Unfortunately there's just too much power in the rest of the list for me to place it above most other songs

**rslashpoopheads** (4): gay people will hear music like this and think it's the funniest thing ever

**apatel27** (3.7): I get what she's going for but it's just not good

**fadedblue09** (3.5): There were parts were I enjoyed this unironically :(((

**1998tweety** (3): this would be lower but the chorus bops a little bit

**frogaranaman** (3): there's like three different ideas going on here and none of them are congealing together

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I wanna find something in this to get mad about but like… it’s not well written enough for me to even have an opinion on it

**ignitethephoenix** (2): why is this protohyperpop 💀

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this sounds like a drag race queen’s music (derogatory)

**lagozzino** (2): yknow what, I'm glad she's having fun. she's making garbage but she's clearly having a great time making it.

**steelstepladder** (2): Chin Up High energy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): this is like if 100 gecs were asked to write an ad jingle for the next democratic presidential nominee

**jsonphile** (1): the whiplash I got from going from a beautiful piano ballad from Sara Bareilles to…this. Like I get that she’s supposed to make intentionally bad music but…red dress was bad in a fascinating way and I might’ve given it a 10. This is just ass, intentional or not.

**MassiveThief** (1): hyperpop is dead

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): Why

**Roxieloxie** (1): this is like american aespa

**RandomHypnotica** (10): they came, they slayed, they served cunt, they ate

**runaway3212** (10): finally relatable content

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Okay maybe the bourgeoisie made just a few points.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): it's eating i'm afraid

**qazz23** (8): fun dancey sound, but mostly prefer the first album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ru paul’s drag race lipsync-core

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.8): Voguing so hard rn, Jack Harlow could never

**Uberpigeon** (7.8): hypnotica ur so nasty for introducing me to this song because it gets stuck in my head ALL the time and then when i listen to it im always unimpressed........ but its ALWAYS PLAYING IN MY BRAIN

**TiltControls** (7.7): It's way too catchy for its own good. I've had it randomly pop up in my head a few times now

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): “Money Can’t Buy You Class” but by a real artist… somehow that makes it worse

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): is rate-reveal-core a genre yet?

**camerinian** (7): I really love Confidence Man in theory

**awry** (6.5): we love to hear the tiktok robot voice rapping

**babadork** (6.4): The deep voiced guy makes it better than other songs like this that popheads gets me to listen to.

**1998tweety** (6): ended Jack Harlow

**MassiveThief** (6): succeeds in making me feel like the baddest bitch.

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): camp

**PAHC** (5.5): best wrapping of leonardo dicaprio's name to fit a rhyme

**ricki** (5.5): slut pop reject pile

**jman457** (5.3): it was kind of annoying but ended nice

**celladonn** (5): Feel like I should like this more but I'm not really vibing with it... I find the deep voiced "first class" kind of jarring

**DirtyRat583** (5): it sounds like its trying to get me to like it but it just isnt trying hard enough

**imbaby122** (5): this feels a little low energy and low effort… like a song that would be written for a sketch in a comedy tv show. but points for the way dicaprio is pronounced and the twinkly sounds at the end.

**afs** (4.5): how is this worse than jck hrlow

**WaneLietoc** (4.2): "People fail to see how absurdist and high-concept this band is. It's intentionally ridiculous and over the top, taking hollow, corporate dance-pop and taking it to an absolute comical extreme. It's kinda like what Meatloaf is to 70s rock. There's no pretext of creating anything "profound" or "personal", but therein lies the point; it completely embraces its role as pure, unabashed entertainment. Post-modern performance art that can be enjoyed both on a surface level as a goofy dance track, and as a sophisticated comment on the diminishing artistic merit of modern popular music." yeah okay sure "i get it", but I can listen to fucking scritti politti and actually have just flat out better music. some stuff is just "high concept, but forgettable" mid.

**MrMoodle** (4): production is slick but this is corny tbh

**pig-serpent** (3.5): While listening to this I had a vision of a bunch of people going crazy for this for 5 seconds, then halfway through continuing to dance halfheartedly while waiting for the dj to change to something else and this immediately soured on me.

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): Not feeling this song, but I checked out their other songs out of curiosity and they’re quite good!

**Roxieloxie** (3): out of respect for the person who sent this i will not articulate why i dont enjoy this

**shipperondeck** (3): dee cuhpree ohhh

**synyyy** (3): you got the bitch part down that's for sure

**anothertown** (2): they want what Double Take has

**frogaranaman** (2): I get it but I also fucking hate it 💀

**jsonphile** (2): sorry I’m a basic economy class nerd

**NecroDolphinn** (2): It's like Slut Pop but somehow worse (and unfortunately catchier)

**SmileAndTears** (2): this is begging to be played in an ad (obviously derogatory)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): me when someone asks me what the song hit number 1 on April 18, 2022

**flavasavavandal** (1): you can't force yass and slay like this, you have to be born with it and these Con Men just weren't. Stop falling for their scams

**rslashpoopheads** (1): no, please, tell me more

**xavieryes** (1): Jack Harlow outsold

**CarlieScion** (10): so true

**skargardin** (10): What are you all DOING?! This is an absolute travesty and robbery, I can't belive how dirty this classique was done. I remember this actually back from when it was on the radio and I kind of re-discovered it through this rate so that was a lovely personal highlight for me. I absolutely love the abrasiveness of the drums, icon shit. Submitted by u/darjeelingdarkroast

---

**vayyiqra** (11): An amazing song! Electroclash classic, Canada-core, an old favourite of mine. Peaches is also based as hell. Please listen to her music.

**2dina3dworld** (10): wow I can’t wait to see the controversy score on this one

**anothertown** (10): get help if you don't like this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): love the positive message that this has!

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): 12yo me discovered this when harry styles recommended it and my life was forever changed

**MrMoodle** (10): the vibe of this song is just right

**RandomHypnotica** (10): innovator

**ReallyCreative** (10): unfortunately I had to stop doing this once the pain was actually gonorrhea

**starla\_** (10): runner-up 11 contender

**slimboyfriend** (9.7): Play this in The Club today and it will STILL go off

**seanderlust** (9.5): stay in school cause it's the best. suckin on my titties

**awry** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRrum4UbowY

**BasedButta** (8): i know this is supposed to be a weird song but i really like the beat (and love the cymbals)

**qazz23** (8): I like the rough and mostly minimal sound, a bit repetitive though - the pounding bass and the rapid cymbal hits give it a nice touch 🍑

**Stryxen** (8): this will now forever and always be my 110000th scrobble

**jman457** (7.8): Is it bad that I liked the Sex education cover better

**itsabop** (7.5): Classic

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.2): the lofi tape quality and raw/live production really adds a lot to this song

**camerinian** (7): I alternate between "wow this actually sounds like garbage" and "if this came on at a party I would probably lose my shit" and I'm not really sure where I fall yet

**fadedblue09** (7): Got annoying towards the end but it's bearable

**Uberpigeon** (7): what.... right... oughh... what

**WaneLietoc** (6.4): that sounds like a rez rail shooter drum

**wavingwolves** (6.2): expected this to be a lot more out there than it was but it's still cool

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Sex on the beach is vastly overrated. Getting sand in the vagina is not helping with any pain.

**bridgemoney** (6): It's...educational?

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i dont think i will

**DirtyRat583** (6): walked so slut pop could... walk slightly faster?

**DefaultPophead** (5.5): So many horny songs I can't enjoy because Citi Zeni destroyed my libido.

**1998tweety** (5): idk about this

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this song peaks at the first verse.

**TiltControls** (5): Not my favourite track here, but got me thinking I should maybe check out Peaches another time

**afs** (4.5): outjerked

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): the first half of this is just a jessi song tbh

**babadork** (4.4): I was not happy to remember that Impeach My Bush was the best Peaches album and that this is really annoying.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): it's just... boring?

**NecroDolphinn** (4): The Sex Education rendition keeps the iconic lyrics without the annoying instrumental

**PAHC** (4): ...girl you were 32.

**shipperondeck** (4): ah one of these modern hyperpop adjacent acts- wait WHAT

**synyyy** (3.5): I wonder if Ms peaches looks back at this and wonders if its cringe

**hikk** (3): i love music like this generally but honestly im just bored at this song

**jsonphile** (3): okay I kinda hate how this sounds but I love the performance of this in sex education so it gets a couple of points for me

**SmileAndTears** (3): ???

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): im sure that someone out there is gonna find this hilarious, unfortunately that person is not me

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): sorry guys but i don't like this song at all! the production is really barebones and peaches just sounds really annoying

**gwykiki** (2): sorry this run of songs is just not for me

**ignitethephoenix** (2): this song sounds like a Jon Lajoie song from 2007

**imbaby122** (2): my sister found our latin teacher’s spotify and this song was on one of her playlists… she wore a mask to class that said “not flexin just texan”… and she was a kacey musgraves stan. i think she’s probably on popheads but that’s just me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): This isn't even good ironically

**apatel27** (1.1): It's giving private school 'punk'

**frogaranaman** (1): I am a Peaches anti and I am not afraid to admit it

**pig-serpent** (1): I would let you all call the vocals camp (which they mostly are) but this is the worst beat I’ve ever heard in my life.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): suddenly I'm a virgin

**WaneLietoc** (10): im gonna sigh and gasp and kick and shove and throw up when this dies in 58th place or some shit. i don't have time to explain why I dont have time to explain why green gartside is a high-iq pop genius who Had Some Ideas. Cupid & Psyche is the big brain answer for "favorite 80s pop" bc its not about just loving the instrumental on a pure "good instrumental" level, its about deconstructing why pop so good with lyrics that are really just love songs about love. it's all meta its all a meticulous little dollhouse. and yet it's STILL white boy funk. like bro was so scared to tour this until decades later cuz they couldn't make the sounds in '86. he's still touring it in clubs at least as of last year. I hope I get to see him do it one day. just truly a remarkeable masterclass of nailing a sound really and still winking and nodding so hard every spoofy playlist wannabe could take notes from. if you gave this a high score hi hello thank you omg valid. if you gave this a low score idk plz tune your ears or look at a mirror idk just look away from me i sad.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): obsessed with this vocal androgyny

**shipperondeck** (8.2): an 80s song

**afs** (8): this doesn't sound like uretha

**babadork** (7.2): I like this more after reading the Wikipedia page for the song, which doesn’t seem entirely fair.

**frogaranaman** (7): good groove

**rslashpoopheads** (7): boppin

**1998tweety** (6): not for me

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i think there are many more things i should do like aretha franklin

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This sounds like Prince (derogatory)

**throwaway-7650** (6): aretha SWEETIE...

**PAHC** (5.5): a bit boring and mismatched, and definitely overlong

**CarlieScion** (10): pussy eating kings

**skargardin** (3): Sorry to my fellow Europeans and other Eurovision stans, but this lost its novelty completely for me after like a week. Maybe them not qualifying wasn't such an upset after all! Also, I wonder how many of you had no clue that this was from Eurovision in the first place. Submitted by TakeOnMeByA-ha

---

**2dina3dworld** (10): can I vote for him for prime minister of NZ? I trust him

**akanewasright** (10): ❌🥩🍽🥗🐈

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): lol of course it's from eurovision

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This didn’t make the Eurovision finals because it lost camp votes to a song about eating fruit. I guess we see where Europe’s priorities lay…

**CrimsonROSET** (10): SO ROBBED! This outsold the wolves eating bananas and FOR WHAT

**just\_thonking** (10): It's objectively a bad song but I am giving it a 10 for the audacity, the message, and the controversy score

**MrMoodle** (10): the meat industry doesn’t want this reaching day 3

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ABSOLUTELY HIGHWAY ROBBERY, HOW DID FUCKING NORWAY GET IN OVER THIS

**SFbby** (10): Shrek's personal anthem

**Stryxen** (10): wait i forgot this is still so camp beyond the first line. eurovision you will never be famous for not qualifying this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): robbed eurovision kings, i wasn’t going to submit this song originally but we were never gonna rate this otherwise anyway plus seeing popheads reactions to that opening line is something i just have to see first hand

**thedoctordances1940** (10): vegan anthem of course it's a 10

**throwaway-7650** (10): latvia be like: CAN YOU EAT PUSSY LIKE THAT?

**vayyiqra** (10): based

**WaneLietoc** (10): huge "guy who did the lorne michaels hire me for snl tik tok". lowkey based.

**seanderlust** (9.3): perhaps if al gore had sang this in 2004's an inconvenient truth we all would have listened :pensive:

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is like an alternate universe Yung Gravy song. Anyways, this would be garbage but this guy honestly sells this performance as much as you can.

**nt96** (9): Global Warming: Ended, Wildfires: Extinguished, Veggies: Eaten, Girlies: Scalped, Me: Penetrated

**SmileAndTears** (9): i am in shock

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is so bad I love it

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): To whoever submitted this song, thank you so much. I was so entertained reading the Eurovision live thread and now I get to finally experience the wonders of salad and pussy first-hand!

**welcome2thejam** (9): This feels like a parody of a parody of a Lonely Island parody of Eurovision songs

**itsabop** (8.7): ROBBED at this year's Eurovision

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): he’s just like me except for the eating pussy part

**shipperondeck** (8.5): im not saying it's good but i fully enjoyed it

**afs** (8): this song is how the eggplant emoji sounds like

**bridgemoney** (8): This is how we fight climate change.

**flavasavavandal** (8): excuse me while I purposefully spill 10 tankers worth of oil into the ocean as revenge for this

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (8): conflicted here because this song rips but the lyrics are fucking dumb and I don't like the guy's voice

**xavieryes** (8): i thought this was gonna be a lame shitpost song. it turned out to be a good shitpost song.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.7): thanks to whoever sent this in bc I didn't know it was on Spotify

**gwykiki** (7.6): surprisingly, a bop

**DirtyRat583** (7.5): i hope all who were able to vote in semifinal 1 and didnt vote for this feel remorse

**Gonza\_90** (7.5): I loved their Eurovision perfonmance

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): bets opening line of all time

**synyyy** (7.5): moment

**celladonn** (7): Extremely powerful opening lyric but the rest of the song doesn't quite live up to it

**DaHumanTorch** (7): "i thought i came but i peed on the dick" has some competition for best opening line

**PAHC** (7): i didnt know they finally made the long-awaited adult lorax sequel

**pig-serpent** (7): "You know, tits and pussy aren't vegan, right?" "How do you figure that?" "Milk and eggs, bitch."

**qazz23** (7): i like some cheese with my salad

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.8): This song's (legendary) opening line has me questioning whether or not the pussy actually counts as meat. Does it? If it does, that make the whole message of this song entirely irrelevant.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Cute bop with a worthy message but also too "heterosexual male" vibes for me

**awry** (6): eating cats does NOT count as green babes

**frogaranaman** (6): LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**nootnoot781** (6): such a memorable first line! i bet it did really well during the eurovision song cont-oh…

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): Cake by the Ocean for annoying people (vegans)

**ricki** (6): i just gasped and clutched my pearls like a middle aged lady at this opening line

**starla\_** (5.1): this song is so stupid but the opening line is way too good

**1998tweety** (5): there are elements of this I like and elements I detest

**anothertown** (5): you just know they were really proud of the first line and then they were like 'ok we can toss the rest of this off in 10 mins'

**camerinian** (5): ok Google search "Vegan Catchphrase T Shirt Etsy"

**cremeebrulee** (5): the rest of this song never reaches the high of the first line tbh

**plastichaxan** (5): this doesn't really have that much going on other than its iconic line but like... it's one line i mean there are other iconic lines here just buried under production

**ReallyCreative** (5): well

**apatel27** (4.9): Too tryhard for Eurovision camp points

**jman457** (4.6): its pretty catchy I guess but kind of an annoying way

**rslashpoopheads** (4): this is very middle school boy in the early 2010s humor

**steelstepladder** (4): Dino nuggies and mac and cheese for life

**TiltControls** (4): Some fantastic lines here! I just wish I liked the song itself a bit more

**wavingwolves** (4): i'm also vegan and i also eat pussy ur not special

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): r/menwritingwomen

**babadork** (3): Is it a rule that the sax players have to be the best part of a Eurovision performance?

**jsonphile** (3): I get it’s a joke song, but…joke just isn’t landing for me. And the music is just kinda annoying

**NecroDolphinn** (3): The first line is iconic and the rest of the song exists.

**Verrem** (3): sounds like some tiktok shit

**astrologicalangelel** (2): I have had this song quoted at me way too many times to appreciate it anymore

**Uberpigeon** (2): i know its a joke song i just think its not funny

**Roxieloxie** (1): he has that twenty one pilots/austin powers 'rap' flow that activates my fight or flight. the saving grace of this is the saxaphone

**runaway3212** (1): this is the same score as the amount of jokes in this "hilarious" song

**DefaultPophead** (0): Was thinking about participating in sexual intercourse, but this song turned me off so hard I don't think I'll be touching another person for the rest of my life.

**imbaby122** (0): +2 because if i didn’t know english i think i would enjoy this song. unfortunately i do know english so -12 yuck gross please never leave this person alone at the produce section.

**slimboyfriend** (0): it’s not even camp because they knew EXACTLY what they were doing here

**starla\_** (8.2): hardstyle?? on my popheads?? we love to see it

**WaneLietoc** (8.1): real music for real heads. Y'all can hate on EDM all you want, but when the aliens come and they only speak in wubs, bloops, and bleeps don't come crying to the rest of us.

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): oontz oontz

**ricki** (2): louder is correct

**CarlieScion** (10): Christine Baranski my beloved

**skargardin** (4): It must be said that the original song wasn't even *that* good to begin with! I will never understand why it's held to such high standards when ABBA's literal entire discography apart from this is there. Anyway, I remember being a tiny bit obsessed with this movie when it dropped but I fear it hasn't aged well, or at least this particular song. Submitted by u/wailord_fan

---

**agentofscranton** (10): certified christine baranskinator for life

**akanewasright** (10): The most legendary shit I’ve ever seen or heard in my life I couldn’t believe it

**anothertown** (10): this is for christine's average

**cremeebrulee** (10): imagine hating this movie or abba

**plastichaxan** (10): this is gonna be robbed but at least it's part of the best movie ever made so

**rslashpoopheads** (10): turned me gay

**runaway3212** (10): this scene turned me gay

**Stryxen** (10): a global #1 smash hit

**WaneLietoc** (10): is this from mamma mia forreal forreal? I saw mamma mia on broadway as a part of an east coast trip. it slapped. this video looked fun.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): this movie made me gay, not even joking… like I saw this as a child and it awakened something in me, I literally left the theatre trying to figure out what changed

**SmileAndTears** (9): she's the best character in the movies and it's not even close

**synyyy** (9): ill assume this is the track that popheads will bring far because of "camp"

**afs** (8.5): idk but daddy does

**fadedblue09** (8.5): ok i quite enjoyed this

**camerinian** (8): Big "your aunt hitting the karaoke at the sports bar after the game finished" energy from this cover and honestly I'm here for it go Susan

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me when my friend tells me he’s skipping school to hang out in the skatepark

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is camp idc and I’m an abba stan

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (8): the movie version over the ABBA version is definitely a choice

**moooo566** (8): does your mother know you picked the lowkey best abba song and then give us the fucking mamma mia version? what the hell

**Roxieloxie** (8): you know i think had socioeconomic factors not been in place and i had been exposed to musicals and shit at a young age I would've been absolutely smitten with them.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.9): those are some... interesting lyrics

**1998tweety** (7.5): the verses unfortunately remind me of Honey I'm Good

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): how we were saved from an ABBA/Mamma Mia episode of Glee, I can only assume divine intervention, because this would have been insufferable

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): the actual scene is a 0 tbh

**TiltControls** (7.5): I've only seen the second film so I don't have context for this song, but it's fun - and at the end of the day it's still a great ABBA track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Would give this a camp 10 if Pierce Brosnan was the one singing it but alas.

**qazz23** (7): decent cover, definitely prefer the original though

**shipperondeck** (7): i am completely unsurprised we go an abba song in here

**welcome2thejam** (7): https://mobile.twitter.com/snlhostsintro/status/1443672902012833821

**awry** (6.5): she put a lot of baranussy in this. maybe i should give mamma mia a watch

**jman457** (6.5): A pretty alright cover of an eh Abba song

**PAHC** (6.5): its giving direct to video movie

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Hot take - I like the vocals on this version more than I do ABBA’s original. Excellent lyricism too btw, R Kelly and all those other creeps should’ve taken notes.

**wavingwolves** (6.1): oh this reminds so much of one of my best friends and the amazing time we had when we watched mamma mia! on theatres.... love you @bestie

**DefaultPophead** (6): It's alright, but there's a reason I don't remember it from the movie.

**frogaranaman** (6): the fact that the movie cover is what got submitted 💀

**gwykiki** (6): sorry diane lockhart

**vayyiqra** (6): I love ABBA

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Wine mom at karaoke energy

**BasedButta** (5.5): this gets really annoying after the first listen

**bridgemoney** (5.5): I'm anti-musical on principle.

**2dina3dworld** (5): I’ve never seen the first Mamma Mia but the whole franchise gives me a visceral reaction

**celladonn** (5): Obviously Mamma Mia is a cinematic classic but I do feel this is one of the least memorable songs from it

**imbaby122** (5): please don’t make me listen to musical theater i left that behind years ago. with that being said this lowkey bangs.

**jsonphile** (5): this was always a pretty mid ABBA song if we’re being honest. And Mamma Mia’s covers are really not that good. Christine Baranski is probably one of the better singers, but all the songs from this stupid movie give off drunk wine aunt energy. I get a lot of people love the cheesiness, but it’s not for me. And yet I let my mom and sister drag me to see Mamma Mia 2 in theaters

**seanderlust** (5): hmm. these lyrics are definitely giving don't stand so close to me. I know this is just an abba cover so it's not their fault but still

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): why does the beginning of this sound like it's going to suddenly break into Selena Gomez & The Scene - Naturally

**apatel27** (4.6): It's doing too much

**babadork** (4.2): I would rather listen to this than the original, but I would never choose to put this on.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): I had a friend in primary school that was a compulsive liar and she made me watch this movie like 5 times in a month and it made me hate it inadvertantly. The original is a 10 tho

**slimboyfriend** (4): why not just submit the original

**thedoctordances1940** (3.1): no thank you

**Gonza\_90** (3): Annoying

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): i remember really enjoying this movie as a child but my entire family hated it and still hate it to this day, so either it's a terrible movie or it's just their inherent bias against musicals speaking

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): FUCK mamma mia

**Uberpigeon** (3): who sent this....... i just wanna know the thought process

**flavasavavandal** (2): love how in the original ABBA are condescending af to make it clear that they mean what they say and then the team behind the sequel to Mamma Mia figured to do away with this. I can at least appreciate Christine being theatrical and dramatic af

**pig-serpent** (0): I think that bad karaoke renditions of abba songs work wonders in the campy atmosphere of the Mamma Mia movie, but as for actual listening I want to hear something that sounds good, and for that the original as well as the stage renditions of this song are right there an infinitely better in every conceivable way.

**starla\_** (0): I hate this movie so much

**steelstepladder** (0): Everything about mamma mia gives me the same feeling as this https://youtube.com/shorts/N5dTcc1eS4w?feature=share

**CarlieScion** (7): would be a 10 if not for the distorted intro vocals and the long ass outro

**skargardin** (6): Well, it seems like didn't go crazy for this song. I think that the skit was its downfall, unfortunately, otherwise, I don't mind this at all! Submitted by u/jman457

---

**jman457** (10): well I just hope this stays to at least a mid day 2. Oshun is so underrated. I feel like they make no noise on our sub despite having one of the best albums of 2018.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This intro had me worried about how the rest of the song would be but I love this sound, might check out this album.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Who are they?? This is great. And they’re like… aliens??

**WaneLietoc** (9): my radio station hosted OSHUN in 2019. great band. even if it needs some chaff cut out this rule.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I really like this but I feel like it's just overshadowed by a lot of really great songs in this rate, and I fear an early exit.

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): the intro better not rob this of a day 3 placement

**akanewasright** (8): This is a very solid R&B song… the final minute doesn’t exist

**frogaranaman** (8): four times two

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): slays

**qazz23** (8): i like the horns in the background along with the multiple vocalists, kinda hate the intro/outro though

**runaway3212** (8): this yass moment

**welcome2thejam** (8): Starting off with that intro when the song sounds like this is too crazy 4 me. Actually I just got to the ending now I get it and I would like to subscribe to this newsletter

**awry** (7.8): did that skit take place at the mother lake

**seanderlust** (7.5): not the outro being a full skit

**synyyy** (7.5): finally a song that IMPROVES... Nvm the outro drags

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): the intro and outro kinda ruin this, but in the middle is a really good track

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this is fun, but the outro goes for a bit long

**DefaultPophead** (7): Lots of fun and I really like it but I can't guarantee I won't skip it next time it plays.

**fadedblue09** (7): This was almost generic till the horns showed up

**ignitethephoenix** (7): their voices are so nice but lyrically I’m not vibing and also the outro is so long

**jsonphile** (7): please stop putting skits in music

**rslashpoopheads** (7): slay

**Stryxen** (7): thot this intro was swish swish

**TiltControls** (7): This is sweet. Also I like the outro but those bells sound like they are x10 louder than the rest of the song though

**afs** (6.5): that intro took five years off my life, then the outro put me in the grave

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): minus 1 because why did they have to include that long ass skit at the end

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.3): Nothing particularly memorable or memorable about this song imo sorry, I love the outro skit though

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): nice song but the ending skit is awful

**moooo566** (6): there's bits of this that are really good and bits of it that are not, can i give it like a 4/8?

**PAHC** (6): they know what is what, but they dont know what is what. they just strut. what the fuck

**plastichaxan** (6): i wish the song didn’t start after like over a minute maybe i would’ve liked it

**vayyiqra** (6): The intro sucks but the song itself is alright

**starla\_** (5.4): this is kinda good kinda annoying

**imbaby122** (5): i have bell trauma (i operate a boat ride at work with bells on it and the kids go crazy with em) so i can’t listen to this song past the first 3 minutes.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): could do without the intro or outro

**babadork** (4.5): This having an intro and an outro puts me in a bad mood.

**camerinian** (4): not to be exactly like the meme but ooooh the mixing ooh I can't stand the mixing

**just\_thonking** (3): Sorry but the knockoff Sunday Candy is not worth sitting through the intro and skit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Oh Jesus Christ, just make your interludes actual interludes instead of making songs worse.

**MassiveThief** (2): annoying from the get-go

**1998tweety** (1): half of this song is absolutely unlistenable and the other half is not great either

**CarlieScion** (3): sometimes hyper pop is bad

**skargardin** (1): The first half of the song I really enjoy actually, even though I'm not exactly a massive fan of hyperpop, but the intro and unnecessarily long outro make this something I frankly never would revisit I'm afraid. Submitted by u/thedoctordances1940

---

**BasedButta** (11): MOVIES FOR GUYS!!!!!

**thedoctordances1940** (11): By far my favourite song in the rate and even if it's my own submission i love this so much and i'd feel horrible not 11ing soooo. frailty is my favourite album ever and this is one of the absolute standouts. The two parts of the song are quite different but both are absolutely amazing in their own right and the opressive wall of sound that bridges them is stunning. There's so much going on in the production in the best way possible and like I just love this song so much so of course I'm gonna be devastated when this goes out day 1 with a 6.437 average and a 2.488 controversy.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this utter COLLAPSE

**hikk** (10): FRAILTY AOTD!!!

**MrMoodle** (10): usually i really don’t like this kind of zoomer tiktok hyperpop but this is really solid, doesn’t feel like it was just made to be hyperpoppy for the sake of being hyperpoppy

**pig-serpent** (10): Jane Remover proved themself one of the most interesting up and coming voices in hyperpop, before deciding they hate that music and pivoting into a glitchy, dream pop album filled with absolutely insane sounding big moments. "Movies For Guys" mixes the best of their production with some of their best songwriting, and as a result it's unlike anything else I've heard and one of my favorite songs from last year.

**runaway3212** (10): this is nct core

**Stryxen** (10): music that makes me dizzy

**throwaway-7650** (10): kodak moment is the 11 (stream frailty!)

**wavingwolves** (10): we love yew forever jane remover

**xavieryes** (10): this song is a fucking messy adventure i love it

**celladonn** (9.5): Hyperpop rights! This song takes you on such a journey

**starla\_** (9.5): this is rym-core and so am I

**afs** (9): omg I didn't know they translated the Weyes Blood song from English to BOYSHIT 😍

**anothertown** (9): this kept surprising me which was great but the overall hyperpop-playlist-core feeling still pervades...

**awry** (9): okay it's the year of our lord 2022 and i'm kinda over hyperpop but i love how this sounds like a callback to 00s indie electro pop in the vein of the postal service/passion pit. the random changes in dynamics and the odd fragmented song structure remind me a lot of velocity:design:comfort as well. tbh i don't even know if i should even treat this as hyperpop

**synyyy** (9): think you misspelled gays there

**jman457** (8.6): i just like this song took me on a journey

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): the breakdown convinced me to raise my score by 0.5

**imbaby122** (8.5): mmmm hardcore glitchy noise just tickles my ears!!!

**camerinian** (8): in a way I feel bad for this song being in this rate, cos I'm sure if I had a chance to give it a dozen or more listens before scoring, it would probably be a 10. Absolute trip

**MassiveThief** (8): 'your clothes' from this album would have been the fastest 11 of my life

**PAHC** (8): unironic comment i should rly listen to frailty

**qazz23** (8): some neat noisy and glitchy stuff, second half is good especially

**seanderlust** (8): this instrumental is bananas. I am in love

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): I really liked this song… until the last third comes in

**DirtyRat583** (7): the intro is what a robot cat would sound like if you squeezed it a bit

**plastichaxan** (7): this song is at its best on its weirder moments but it is a bit boring at times

**TiltControls** (7): Don't love the electronicness of the vocals here, but the song is produced fantastically

**WaneLietoc** (6.7): oh you mean guy ritchie stuff like snatch and lock stock and two smokin barrels?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): I loooved the first part of this song where it sounds like a sauced-up Good Morning Revival track. Then it all kinda falls apart after that but at least the little ballad bit at the end is cool.

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): there's some cool stuff here but overall not a big fan

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Movies? For GUYS??? Now I've seen everything

**babadork** (6.3): I did really like around two minutes of this, so I might check out more of their music.

**itsabop** (6.1): Too all over the place but not bad in parts

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I don’t hate it…but I don’t understand it.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): one day i’ll get into hyperpop

**DefaultPophead** (6): Post-good genius.

**Gonza\_90** (6): This sucks, but it also slaps

**Verrem** (6): not search party

**lagozzino** (5.5): my score started really high but that transition into a whiny mid 00s Adult Alternative song at the end killed it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): i feel so bad for not liking jane’s music…i listened to frailty multiple times but it never really stuck with me and while this song is one of the more notable cuts i still would never choose to listen to it on my own time

**1998tweety** (5): this is the worst and best songs I've ever heard crudely stitched together

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): this is like three different songs in one and none of them are very good

**shipperondeck** (5): wait what happened

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Why do hyperpop songs always sound like they’re caught in an endless loop of irony

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): why couldn't the whole song sound like the last 2 minutes

**ignitethephoenix** (4): gets a little too hyper pop for me

**rslashpoopheads** (4): scream scream scream!

**yearofthesoup** (4): Gen-z hellogoodbye

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the first part was a nice 6 but girl

**ricki** (3): the second that outro started i dropped like 4 points

**Uberpigeon** (3): i need a jane remover remover

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): This is like an electronic, Gen Z “Bohemian Rhapsody,” but for context I hate “Bohemian Rhapsody”

**vayyiqra** (2): sorry marmiteman I hate the vocals it's this specific style I can't stand

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): The superior "Stay"

**PAHC** (8.5): yea this was a great first listen. i wish it was like 2 mins longer tho

**synyyy** (8.5): vocals are a givin but the music is not a givin

**awry** (8): for some reason i've never heard this before, but yeah i love me some goth pop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Very, very pretty even if I’m probably not gonna revisit too many times.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): it’s giving gospel

**Uberpigeon** (8): hey are you emo? you're emo right? no im just asking... do you wear all black is that because you're depressed?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.8): love the industrial-esque production that comes in the second half, and holy shit I loooove that whistle note before the last chorus!

**imbaby122** (7.5): ascended.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): The beginning with just the strings and vocals hits hard, but I don’t think the second half is nearly as good.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Starts off really cool with those eerie floating vocals but kinda loses the vibe once the heavier instrumentation kicks in.

**itsabop** (7): Better than the other Stay in this rate

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): Is this what Angel Olsen decided to turn into her career

**qazz23** (7): good vocals but takes a while to get going

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This sounds like someone took a Christmas hymn and made it pop-rock

**2dina3dworld** (6.2): I’m sorry but when I see the cover of this album, all I can think of is Mr Blobby and the scene with the lookalike trying to hook up with him.

**1998tweety** (6): needed a bit more energy

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): real ones remember the cher lloyd cover of this on x-factor

**MrMoodle** (6): shakespeare sister actually said stay with me hee hee

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i don't know what to think about this one...i think it's good? i think i like it?

**throwaway-7650** (6): the better stay in the rate but incredibly low bar

**starla\_** (5.9): the singing is bad but the actual track slaps so the score is mid

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): this sounds like christian music (derogatory)

**camerinian** (5): this sounds like proto golden buzzer Britain's Got Talent crying montage music

**fadedblue09** (5): What are the odds that another Bananarama song is here

**1998tweety** (10): ok this is purely for nostalgia but this song played in a Homestuck AMV I watched a decade ago and because of that it'll always be a bop to me

**anothertown** (10): sooo i'll be interested to see what ph thinks of this :scared:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Absolutely no idea who tf these people are but I’m having a great time!

**celladonn** (10): When I was in high school and very obsessed with Fueled By Ramen I always thought these guys were the most underrated FBR band, along with Forgive Durden. This definitely holds up

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this gives me ‘original song inspired by x’ era of YouTube

**nt96** (8): oh this is quirky

**pig-serpent** (8): This throwbackish indie pop reminds me a lot of The Dear Hunter. Definitely going to check out this album sometime, I imagine it'll sound quite breezy. I think the budget Brendon Urie is holding is back a little though.

**ReallyCreative** (8): mommy doesn't get drunk, she just has fun

**ricki** (8): miranda cosgrove and drake bell duet

**synyyy** (8): this isn't Taylor's version I assume

**babadork** (6.4): This has always been a band that I thought I should like but never really did.

**frogaranaman** (5): the guy sounds like Brendon Urie

**skargardin** (7): Maybe MLP isn't all bad after all! Actually on relisten I would've scored this higher even because it absolutely slaps. I wonder if it would've done better without the MLP association? Submitted by u/pig-serpent

**CarlieScion** (6): vocals ruining a perfectly good moody song

---

**bridgemoney** (10): Bleep bloop good.

**hikk** (10): u really just have to admit that sometimes brony music gives.

**pig-serpent** (10): I had known about Vylet Pony for years, but Ursa Major is the song that knocked her back onto my radar and made me fall in love with her music. The main synth riff is transcendental and immaculately produced, and Vylet’s voice has evolved into a silky smooth ball of chocolate with an effortless charm.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): raising my score a little bit to offset weird "ew my little pony music" tankers, cause like vylet pony's music is genuinely great and she released one of the best albums of the year

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): I guess they're not neurodivergent and a minor(s)

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): this had no right to go as hard as it did

**starla\_** (9.5): my little pony

**seanderlust** (9.2): BYE not brony porter robinson making an absolute banger

**wavingwolves** (9.1): brony music slays!

**ricki** (9): pretending this is just magdalena bay so i dont have to face the fact that im giving bronie music a 9

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): what is it with bronies and making music thats so much better than it has any right to be

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.8): Loooooovee this tune, good to see the brony music community is still thriving

**1998tweety** (8.5): bops

**afs** (8.5): ursula.

**synyyy** (8.5): pretty good too

**jman457** (8.1): it was annoying me but the ending was really pretty

**PAHC** (8): surprisingly great!! outro is a bit bland tho i fear

**vayyiqra** (8): Ironically sounds more like a Porter song than the song before which is literally by Porter lol

**TiltControls** (7.7): This is super pretty. Will have to check out more of their stuff!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I feel like the reveal post is gonna have its own section for comments that reference Porter Robinson

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): I am not a trans pegasister and therefore not the target demographic for this song but I am glad they are out here living their lives and doing their shit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Is this dubstep or do I have no musical understanding whatsoever.

**DirtyRat583** (7): why is there rainbow dash on the cover

**flavasavavandal** (7): when you spend your entire life avoiding my little pony and then someone ruins that because of a dumb charity rate

**rslashpoopheads** (7): superlove but worse

**runaway3212** (7): stan MLP

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): queen of misfits? Ava Max is shook

**steelstepladder** (7): Can we just rate Discord already

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sorry I discriminate against bronies

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): the internet has made me very afraid of anything related to my little pony but this isn't bad

**imbaby122** (6.5): i love a tune that should only be listened to on a nintendo ds.

**just\_thonking** (6.5): Was the Porter Robinson rate win not enough

**camerinian** (6): so is this MLP fanfic or Porter Robinson fanfic I can't tell

**CrimsonROSET** (6): a bit too much but like if it went down 2 notches i’d really like it

**anothertown** (5): no x

**awry** (5): sorry but those vocals are rough, especially the second vocalist. also "not one c-list protag gone amiss", "feel like i could take down an ursa major"? what are those lyrics lol UPDATE wait this is literally mlp fan music UPDATE 2 +1 point for the beautiful ambient outro... though it's totally out of place here lmao

**DefaultPophead** (5): Is this supposed to be bad or good?

**frogaranaman** (5): is this a fucking My Little Pony song

**MrMoodle** (5): so i’m learning that there are a sizeable number of spotify mlp fan artists? i guess i shouldn’t be surprised given there’s so much visual art but still wtf lol

**shipperondeck** (4.9): this is interesting but i just dont like the voices sorry

**WaneLietoc** (4.2): its not rlly that much my speed.

**Stryxen** (3): very Not for me

**plastichaxan** (2.5): what is this :sob:

**fadedblue09** (2): sounds like a MagBay song

**skargardin** (6): I feel like the potential is there for this song to go bigger, but it just ended up a bit too generic for me. I will admit though that the lyricism is nice and well-written. And hey, it managed to snatch up two elevens so that's something. Submitted by u/fadedblue09

**CarlieScion** (5): boring and self-indulgent

---

**ImADudeDuh** (11): i’ve legitimately cried to this song at least 3 times

**1998tweety** (10): come on vocals

**agentofscranton** (10): this won't get my 11 here but when we inevitably do a musical rate it will, so beautiful

**fadedblue09** (10): My submission 👀 I honestly have no idea how this will do, but I do think it has enough mass appeal and I just wanna see Sara Bareilles make her rate debut

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): I saw Sara sing this song in Waitress live on Broadway and I still think about how awesome that was

**itsabop** (10): This song is gorgeous especially in Waitress, I recommend Alison Luff's rendition

**jsonphile** (10): so I saw Waitress, the musical this is from, a couple of years ago and it was fine. Nothing spectacular, but an enjoyable show. But this song blew me away, an absolute standout in the show. And Sara Bareilles’ version is also amazing, filled with so much emotion and heartbreak. I love Love Song as much as anyone, but for me this should be her defining song.

**ReallyCreative** (10): The absolute flex of releasing an album of you performing the songs from the Broadway show you wrote and later starred in. I say this fully acknowledging if LMM did the same thing I would call it cringe

**ricki** (10): the harm this song has done to the theater kid community will be studied by historians for years to come

**seanderlust** (10): waitress literally has such a good OST - every time I had an opening shift at the Mexican restaurant I worked at for a few years I would listen to "opening up" as I was prepping the horchata and unlocking the patio

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): living eureka california legend i know that's right!!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): put me in the theater kid section

**NecroDolphinn** (9): The guitar surprised me but man it was welcomed. This whole song is surprising in its quality like this song is really great.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Used to be one of the rotten ones and I liked you for that / Now you're all gone, got your makeup on and you're not coming back / Can't you come back

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): sometimes I just really like a good musical number

**TiltControls** (8.5): ratemas inspiration?!

**jman457** (8.3): she made this for the former theater kids (derogatory) in all of us

**afs** (8): I thought this was a lesbian anthem :(

**bridgemoney** (8): Piano ballads need a comeback.

**DefaultPophead** (8): I need to watch this musical...

**imbaby122** (8): one thing about sara bareilles is she’s gonna write a SONG.

**awry** (7.5): i can see what you're doing here, pitting her against regina so close in the playlist... the quirky piano girls are fighting!

**BasedButta** (7.5): holy fuck. I know now what to listen to when i’m… that way.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I love her

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): the og Liability

**synyyy** (7.5): oh cool another ballad. anyway next

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): it verges on being just another generic big Broadway ballad but there's enough emotion in it to be pretty touching

**CrimsonROSET** (7): musical grab bag sweetie

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): this is so sappy i should utterly hate this

**steelstepladder** (6): Is the white girl with a piano the gender swapped version of a white guy with acoustic guitar? Discuss

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s a beautiful pie

**akanewasright** (5): I have a soft spot for the Waitress musical, but I’m not as into this for a few reasons. One of them being that… this is a lame thing to say, but I prefer a lot of the other songs from the show - while I think SUTBM works well as an eleven o’clock number, I gravitate more towards the character building songs like When He Sees Me and What Baking Can Do. But on top of that, making a pop version of the big emotional climax of the story doesn’t work for me. Like the song works on stage because the actress is *acting* it, and everyone in the audience has just seen >!Jenna’s abusive husband find and take the money she’d been saving to try and leave him safely!<, and her reflecting on her life works in that context. This does not work as well out of context, and in particular this recording just does not have a fraction of the emotion of any of the versions I’ve heard from actresses playing the lead in this show. Hell, Sara played this role on Broadway a few times, and she did it better there than on the record. It’s still a decent tune, but this recording left me with middling expectations for the musical back in 2015

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): this sounds like a song i’d have to sing in primary school assembly

**vayyiqra** (5): She has a pretty voice but I don't really like her music

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.8): Love Song is better sorry

**PAHC** (4.5): honestly "I WANT TO SEE YOUR BIG BRAVE" might be a bottom 5 lyric in a 2010s hit

**gwykiki** (4.3): ballads.

**2dina3dworld** (4): im Broadway-phobic unless it’s Chicago

**anothertown** (4): naturally as a great comet stan i hate waitress

**qazz23** (4): this is a bit too ballad-y for me :(

**Roxieloxie** (4): gay?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I do not generally support theatre kid hate because it gives me icky vibes but…I may make an exception here.

**yearofthesoup** (3): corny

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): im literally falling asleep right now

**starla\_** (1.9): I have never liked anything Sara Bareilles does I'm so sorry

**Uberpigeon** (1): this is my fight song take back my life song

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): look maybe it’s over dramatic to give this a 0 but this time it’s personal, I’ve never liked this song and as a theatre person I’ve been terrorized by it for years

**frogaranaman** (7): ain't no way a man has dick better than Trader Joes

**pig-serpent** (7): Some of the lyrics are pretty funny but I think the beat gets boring and those Snails House squeaky noises are obnoxiously loud. I can’t bring myself to give it a bad score though, I think it deserves better than that.

**Roxieloxie** (7): i dont like the layout of trader joes

**synyyy** (7): death grips sampling got nothing on this

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): As someone who only recently started to understand the hype around Trader Joe’s: I get you girl

**1998tweety** (6.5): not for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): if i had a dollar for every song i had to listen to for a rate that involved licking toes i’d have 2 dollars. which isnt a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice

**wavingwolves** (6.5): nctcore. i won't elaborate

**imbaby122** (6): successful trader joe’s promo.

**runaway3212** (6): expected this to have more punch to it but I love it

**TiltControls** (6): I've never been to a Trader Joe's so I can't relate. In actuality though there are some cool moments with production here - I just wished the main loop didn't grate on me after a minute

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A bop is a bop. That’s all there is to say.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): tk braver than any marine

**frogaranaman** (10): /u/TragicKingdom1 I'm still putting this in the Tiktok 2 pastebin

**hikk** (10): deserving of overplay

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Justin carries but the song slaps so we tolerate Laroi

**RandomHypnotica** (10): kid laroi really is the worst part of this song… but it's still a smash idc

**Roxieloxie** (10): i keep hearing this out in public in social events and each time i have more and more fun with it like damn! ill be fucked up if you cant be right here!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I fear this song is still an absolute smash even if I can't tell them apart

**runaway3212** (10): deserved Blinding Light's succes

**thedoctordances1940** (10): a great song who's score i'm boosting a little cause some people will be unnecessarily harsh to it cause of the artists even though if any main pop girl made this song they'd love it.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i genuinely believe this is the catchiest song of all time

**bridgemoney** (9.5): The second best song called stay. (Alessia Cara will always be #!).

**shipperondeck** (9.3): i listen to this on youtube so lastfm doesn't scrobble it for me, im embarrassed to like this song

**DirtyRat583** (9.1): this is like his only good song and it is VERY good

**gwykiki** (9): sorry but i really enjoy it

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): smash sorry

**starla\_** (9): this has Stayed on the charts for so long but I somehow never get bored of it. Also the Kid Laroi is from my city so I gotta support him in this rate.

**wavingwolves** (8.9): not a 10 because txt did it better when they covered it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.8): this song is so good it almost makes me forgive the kid laroi for every other horrible song he’s made

**camerinian** (8.5): I really want this to just fuck off from the charts so I can finally listen to it in peace without contributing to it lingering like a fungus in the top 20

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): if Charli XCX dropped this y’all would be gagging for it

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1395746537326751746/pu/vid/950x696/QZy2-eVBY96AjRCg.mp4?tag=12

**pig-serpent** (8): A catchy and fun pop song that I will never have any emotional attachment to. The music equivalent of an above average marvel movie.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I like the chorus and the melody, and Bieber’s verse actually works well on this one more than Laroi’s. Not the best song in this rate called “Stay” but it’s still an excellent song.

**steelstepladder** (8): Take a shot for every Mid Laroi joke

**TiltControls** (8): I know these two are hardly at the top of PH's list of faves, but this is really solid

**Uberpigeon** (8): AAARRGHHH... OUUGhhhh... GRRR.. ghnnGNNNNN.. forced to give beiber a good score... oiugHHH.... noooo

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): overplayed but good

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i still think that this would be a better as a justin solo song

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): ugh I hate that this grew on me.

**MassiveThief** (7.5): oh boy im excited to see how this does. it's cute and i'm glad it's a record breaking type song.

**afs** (7): thank you for not submitting the can't make a wife out of a hoe song

**akanewasright** (7): Fine, I’ll tolerate both of you for 3 minutes

**apatel27** (7): The build is great even if the lyrics aren't

**BasedButta** (7): this drops the ball at some points but i could see myself dehydrating to this song at a party

**jsonphile** (7): look it’s the only song where The Kid Laroi doesn’t sound terrible and one of the few songs where Justin Bieber sounds like he’s actually putting in effort so I’ll take it

**welcome2thejam** (7): This is a perfect radio song, in that I've heard this an incredible amount of times and I'm still not angry yet when it comes on, which is definitely a point in its favor.

**babadork** (6.7): This is okay, but I wish it was easier for me to pick up on the difference between Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber. They barely sound like different people.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): another Blinding Lights spawn?

**jman457** (6.4): it was a little too meh for how much it was overplayed

**MrMoodle** (6): i forget where i read this but someone said that this song would be way better if justin and kid laroi didn’t split the difference and just gave this to post malone instead.

**ricki** (6): listening to this song outside of tiktoks reuploaded to instagram reels feels wrong

**synyyy** (6): better than I thought actually. still day 1

**vayyiqra** (6): The synth line is good but his vocals are not

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Some artists have objectively bad voices, and yet they're still able to make wonderful music. That's because they're well aware of the limitations of their voices, and they explicity use those limitations to add their own unique affects and personalities to their work. That, I believe, is the mark of a true artist, an individual who uses their own shortcomings to their advantage. The Kid Laroi…… is not doing any of this and should go away immediately. I've only heard his three main singles and I'm already exhausted of his painful sounding yelps and emotionally manipulative lyrics. Make no mistake, this 6 is for Justin and the backing track only.

**slimboyfriend** (5.8): and I thought Ariana’s blaccent was bad

**imbaby122** (5): mid af and overplayed af but honestly imagine the kid laroi x justin bieber collabs in alternate universes… it could be much worse!

**itsabop** (4.5): Somewhere between barely tolerable and okay but certainly not enough to stay

**PAHC** (4.5): i love how there are five votes for this being hyperpop on rym

**anothertown** (4): fucked up vocal comping

**awry** (4): this would be a fun little earworm but 1) the first guy's voice is irritating 2) the other one is justin bieber

**throwaway-7650** (3.5): the worst offender of the "good prod. + bad vocals"

**2dina3dworld** (3): the chorus is kinda cute, as is the synth line, but the rest is not great. I’m more frustrated by the ruined potential than anything else

**yearofthesoup** (3): bland

**WaneLietoc** (2.8): man this one's a running on empty dead end trap. white boys rap about drinking if their girl isn't with 'em over emotional beats. this isn't emo rap its suburban gentrification mindfuck; feels like a real type of California guy. The part where justin comes in and dances with him in the music video is so funny tho. my boys and me do that at BJs all the time.

**flavasavavandal** (2): Justin Bieber, my arch nemesis, just a voice that exudes no personality and detracts from my listening experience, can’t believe he tricked the world into thinking his music was good

**ReallyCreative** (2): beyond being a shameless MIDI-quality copy of Blinding Lights, LAROI's vocals are just not it. There are absolutely worse songs in this rate, but those songs at least made me laugh

**just\_thonking** (1.5): I wish to purge this song from the earth

**Gonza\_90** (1): I refuse to listen to this

**plastichaxan** (1): the way justin could’ve done a somewhat kinda decent song on his own for a change but… no

**astrologicalangelel** (0): you could not pay me to listen to this song again

**nt96** (0): I HATE this song so much. Laroi's wannabe angsty vocals are grating af. The Ohhhwooh Bridge is lazy and shoehorned. The strong language feels like they placed it there just to show how edgy Kid Laroi is, which he isn't. The chorus is boring, lazy, and uninspired. There's nothing redeemable about this song whatsoever, believe me, I counted.

**qazz23** (0): this is quite annoying, really don't like the vocals :(

**Stryxen** (0): oh my god i hate this song. the vocals are horrible and combined with the catchiest but most annoying chorus ever it always gets stuck in my head and i have to try cope with this. I cannot stand the way he throws that high note up every line it sounds so .. unsafe . i want this song to crash and burn. And when he keeps groaning in the prechorus. Makes me shudder

**skargardin** (10): One thing we are certainly NOT going to do is do fresh popheads rate winner Porter Robinson dirty like this?! I thought we loved Porter in this sub, WHAT HAPPENED? I absolutely loove this but unfortunately the antis were just too strong this time. We better make up for this travesty in Winners 3. Submitted by u/suddenlystarlit

**CarlieScion** (8): who let basshunter into this rat

---

**awry** (10): the concept of raves terrifies me but i would rave to this

**frogaranaman** (10): one of the best Porter Robinson songs out there

**hikk** (10): PORTER ROBINSON RATE WINNER 2.0?????????????????????

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): The hardcore schranz drop at 4:18 is probably the hardest fucking drop Porter has ever produced tbh.

**runaway3212** (10): yass porter

**vayyiqra** (10): Going to be robbed for being long but it's great Porter cannot miss

**wavingwolves** (9.8): yes i'm a weeb

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): yassified techno

**welcome2thejam** (9): Porter Robinson DDR entry

**imbaby122** (8.5): the noise scratches an itch in my brain what a ride.

**1998tweety** (8): wait this is good, it takes you on a journey

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): it's a little long, but man does it go off

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Can Porter win two rates this year?? Absolutely not lmao.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this would slay on ddr i just know it

**MrMoodle** (8): i stg electronic producers are the most annoying fucking people on the planet, this dude’s spotify profile says “the technic-Utopia is awakening”, like what makes these people take themselves so fucking seriously lmao. like they think they’re engaged in some weird futuristic dystopian war where their only weapon is electronic music it’s so embarassing. you make dumbass rave music. you are a clown for adults. that is your role and your purpose please stop with this shit. this does slap though.

**pig-serpent** (8): This style of music is very cool and I think Porter Robinson should make more songs like this one. Especially the last 2 minutes.

**shipperondeck** (8): im afraid to score this lower

**throwaway-7650** (8): porter robinson coming for his 2nd rate win !?

**WaneLietoc** (7.9): Oh god it goes on for 6.5 minutes but it's really hype so how about an earnest 7.9 to the lil' champ; love dnb breakdown good work.

**afs** (7.5): needed more angel voices

**PAHC** (7.5): oh i love the slow addition of compression in the outro thats insane

**starla\_** (7.5): fuck yes

**synyyy** (7.5): can't you stop sometimes... also stream geometry dash again

**jman457** (7.3): it built nicely i guess, just a little too long

**BasedButta** (7): that was funny

**DefaultPophead** (7): Prime daydreaming music.

**qazz23** (7): felt this dragged a bit but certainly picks up towards the end

**camerinian** (6.5): drops are underwhelming for how good the buildups are i’m afraid. That outro though? Madness

**ReallyCreative** (6): are the angel voices supposed to be biblically accurate ?

**rslashpoopheads** (6): speed racer

**Stryxen** (6): dragged out quite a bit but not bad… she’s kinda doing too much tho, the brook lynn hytes of edm

**Verrem** (6): after that Lil Texas drop, any drop that doesn't rupture my eardrums sounds weak

**TiltControls** (5.7): I love Porter's stuff under his name, but this isn't doing it for me as much. Though this would slay in DDR or Beatmania or the games of that grouping

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): if Darude - Sandstorm and a SOPHIE song had a baby

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): would be a higher score if it wasn’t a tad tew long…

**RandomHypnotica** (4.8): oh… I do not like this at all… porter sweetie what is this

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): I like the last two minutes but then again it didn’t have to be six and a half minutes, did it?

**gwykiki** (4): my cat did not like this one

**ricki** (4): \*checks watch*

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I am exhausted of edm

**jsonphile** (3): this just keeps going and going

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): Definitely a song with a beat

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Clicked on this artist’s Spotify profile and they looked exactly like I expected.

**fadedblue09** (1): There was absolutely nothing angelic about this

**skargardin** (6): And here's your final Day 1 song! Is the band-phobia on full display? Maybe the other bands in the rate will fare better, tune in to Day 2 to find out! Submitted by u/bridgemoney

**CarlieScion** (4): this is bad and was also bad on glee

---

**bridgemoney** (11): I had to give it to my own pick. Such an addictingly fun banger that I'll never get tired of after hundreds of listens. If anyone else really liked this, listen to the rest of their album Partie Traumatic. Please don't let this corny blog rock band's legacy go to waste.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I always support British cultural appropriation.

**camerinian** (10): this the type of music my future kids are gonna bully me for liking

**celladonn** (10): This was one of my fave ever itunes songs of the week

**cremeebrulee** (10): i love bisexual people

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The iCarly soundtrack is surprisingly relevant to this month’s rates

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): fuck Pitchfork for trying to destroy the Black Kids. This song is perfect.

**lagozzino** (10): Robert Smith somehow reincarnated into the 00s despite still being alive. Seriously I've heard this song many times over the years and just thought it was The Cure this whole time.

**runaway3212** (10): Such a fucking banger!!!!!

**Stryxen** (10): an inspired choice. A HIT

**welcome2thejam** (10): Pitchfork will get what they deserve one day

**BasedButta** (9.5): hype

**just\_thonking** (9): One of my favorite discoveries from the rate

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): holy shit this dude sounds so much like declan mckenna, he has the british indie voice nailed to a T

**NecroDolphinn** (9): Damn this song fucking rules

**Uberpigeon** (9): I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THIS SONG!!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): What is this… I like it

**wavingwolves** (9): this is an 8tracks classic

**SmileAndTears** (8.7): boppity bop

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): I didn't think anyone else remembered that this song existed

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): metro station-core

**synyyy** (8.5): that stupid bridge ruined it

**TiltControls** (8.5): This is fun! Feels very 80s

**WaneLietoc** (8.2): post-louis xiv, post-go team!, post-pipettes. total landfill indie dead end that sorta slaps. yeah the video looks like a channel 4/bbc comedy sketch hell wasteland but its chill. good for this song for existing this band prolly didn't deserve to get p4k bulled. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmM-6A9hVyw oh wait this video proves they should've

**afs** (8): then be his boyfriend dummy

**imtotallyfine\_jpg** (8): As a far Gleek I got to be honest but Blaine Anderson introduced be to this song

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Why are there white people in the group?

**vayyiqra** (8): This sounds so much like the band Hot Hot Heat who nobody else has ever heard of here

**yearofthesoup** (8): v nostalgic

**seanderlust** (7.5): dance! dance! dance! dance!

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): very landfillcoded

**1998tweety** (7): why are they called Black Kids when half of them are white 😭 anyways the song bops a bit

**anothertown** (7): we need to stop having glee songs on here

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Bit weird to call your band “Black Kids” when only two of your five members are black but whatever. Anyway did anyone notice that the drummer’s playing the Amen Break rhythm?

**ricki** (7): if you told me this is the song that inspired the 1975 to start making music i’d believe you

**steelstepladder** (7): I like it a lot as a song but wooooow this guys 00s indie guy voice is off the charts

**jman457** (6.8): typical late 00’s indie rock

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Ever call a song mid only to get it stuck in your head 2 weeks later so you come back to it and still think it’s mid? Yeah…

**frogaranaman** (6): this is the type of song that I'd call a setlist highlight at a midwest house party after hearing six bands drunkenly perform mostly shitty albums that you feel the need to support since your friend knows someone who knows someone in the band

**imbaby122** (6): okay not to add to the pile of glee comments but i’m still not totally convinced this song exists outside the glee universe. this is actually fake.

**qazz23** (6): find the vocals annoying but it's dancey enough

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): false advertising, only 2 of the people in this band are actually black kids smh

**babadork** (5.6): "Look at Me (When I Rock Wichoo)" and "Love Me Already" are better

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): I loved this song in college but once I outgrew Matt & Kim, songs like this just did not stand a chance against my newfound pretentiousness

**rslashpoopheads** (5.5): sounds kinda gay idk

**DefaultPophead** (5): Of course this was on the iCarly soundtrack...

**Verrem** (5): man, what happened to Robert Smith...

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): sounds like robert Smith stumbled onto the set of glee

**CrimsonROSET** (4): this sounds like a the 1975 parody

**MassiveThief** (4): The singer's voice kinda tanked this

**PAHC** (3.5): the vocals are just as good as the title

**starla\_** (3.4): one of the worst songs of this hipster indie pop era

**2dina3dworld** (3): this is 2013 FTP indie core (derogatory)

**flavasavavandal** (3): get this disgustingly mixed glee-core the fuck out of my eardrums

**awry** (2): hunny what is this

**nootnoot781** (2): this is a kooks song.

**shipperondeck** (2): sorry not my style at all

**apatel27** (1.3): This style of music triggers my fight or flight

**DirtyRat583** (1): i hate bands
